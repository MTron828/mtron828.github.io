Chapter 543 – Sheerwing, Stellar Shuttle, Lag!

“If you dare to sacrifice yourself to protect me again, then I’ll kill you, and then I’ll kill myself to give my life back to you!” An Nanjing looked Yang Ye in the eye and spoke with a serious expression on her face.

Yang Ye said, “I only did that because I was confident. Even you know that I have some secrets, and those secrets allowed me to be confident at dealing with Saint Liu Yun. But you don’t have such things. You would definitely die if you were to face Saint Liu Yun, but I wouldn’t. Under such circumstances, how would I live with myself if I did nothing to save you from death?”

An Nanjing asked. “Would you do the same if it was someone else?”

Yang Ye smiled and said, “I definitely wouldn’t if it was Luo Jun.”

An Nanjing fell silent for a short while before she said, “You saved me outside Ancient Domain City that day, and you’ve saved my life again today. I owe your two lives.”

Yang Ye was quite speechless. So that’s what she cared about. He said, “An Nanjing, is it even necessary to calculate it so clearly between the two of us? How about you just save me if my life is in danger?”

An Nanjing said seriously, “I will!”

Yang Ye smiled and said, “Alright, let’s leave it at that. I’ve obtained the World Portrait, and we’re within it right now. In other words, all the profounders within the World Portrait are at our mercy. Unfortunately, Luo Jun has left the World Portrait.”

An Nanjing asked. “Who do you intend to kill?”

“The devil race, those Divine Gold Dragons, and.... In any case, I want to kill everyone I can’t stand the sight of!” Yang Ye spoke with a surging heroic spirit. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

An Nanjing said, “It’s best if you don’t do that!”

“Why?” Yang Ye was extremely puzzled, and he said, “They’ll become a pile of corpses with a wave of my hand!”

“What would you do after you’ve killed them?” An Nanjing said, “Can you kill the Grand Elder of the devil race who’s waiting outside? Or the Dragon Emperor? I’m certain that both of them will disregard everything and kill you if you slaughter all the members of the devil race and Divine Gold Dragon Clan in here. Do you think the Demon Emperor alone would be able to save you from their joint forces?”

Yang Ye was stunned. Truthfully speaking, he really hadn’t thought of that. Now that An Nanjing had spoken about it, he finally remembered that those two extraordinary experts were waiting outside. Even though the old man in Daoist robes was a Monarch Realm expert, he was definitely unable to compare with those two extraordinary experts. Because the old man was only comparable to a third rank Monarch Realm expert, and the two of them were ninth rank Monarch Realm experts!

Yang Ye sighed dejectedly and said, “I thought I could kill to my heart’s content. I never expected that I would still have my hands bound.”

“No one can act as they please without absolute strength!” said An Nanjing.

Yang Ye gazed at the old man and said, “Senior Tu, what treasures are there within the World Portrait?”

The old man opened his eyes and pondered deeply for a moment before he said, “I noticed that you have quite a large amount of treasures, and they are all Dao Artifacts. I presume you wouldn’t be interested in treasures that aren’t Dao Artifacts. So, I’ll just tell you about the Dao Artifacts. There’s only a single Natural Dao Artifact here, and that’s me. Besides that, there are 3 other Dao Artifacts, and they are respectively Sheerwing, Lag, and the Stellar Shuttle.”

When he spoke up to this point, the old man waved his right hand, and then three treasures appeared in front of Yang Ye.

It was a saber, a sword, and a pair of shoes.

The saber was over a meter long, half a palm wide, and thin like a cicada’s wings. Its blade was translucent, smooth, and seemed like a mirror. It was even capable of reflecting their figures.

The sword was around a meter long, two fingers wide, and its blade was covered in strange talisman markings.

The shoes were comparatively ordinary. They were black in color, and there seemed to be nothing unusual about them if based solely on their outer appearance.

Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto the sword, and then it moved to the shoes before he said, “What effects do these shoes possess?”

“The Stellar Shuttle is made from a mysterious rock within a meteor from outer space. It possesses the ability to travel through space. Of course, it’s impossible for it to be called a Dao Artifact if that was all it’s capable of. After all, Exalt Realm experts can travel through space themselves. The Stellar Shuttle possesses two unique abilities. Firstly, it can greatly increase the speed of its wearer. For example, if your current speed allows you to travel 50km in every breath of time, then you can travel 500km in every breath of time when wearing it!

“The second unique ability is it can allow its wearer to pass directly through space. Listen properly, I said pass directly through space. When Exalt Realm experts travel through space, they have to tear space open first, and that requires time. However, the Stellar Shuttle has no need to tear space open, and it can just pass straight through.”

Yang Ye wasn’t the only one who was visibly moved when the old man finished speaking, even An Nanjing was visibly moved. What did the ability to pass straight through space represent? It represented that if those shoes were to fall into Yang Ye or An Nanjing’s possession, then with their strengths and the element of surprise, it was entirely possible for them to immediately annihilate a ninth rank Exalt Realm expert!

Yang Ye showed zero poise as he directly placed the shoes within his spatial ring, and then he thought for a moment, took them out again, and wore them. He’d just worn them on his feet when Yang Ye felt light as a feather, and his figure merely flashed lightly before he arrived over 100m away.

An Nanjing was visibly moved again because that wasn’t caused by Yang Ye’s speed, and it was because Yang Ye had passed through the barriers of space and moved directly through space. Most importantly, there had been no sign of it at all before Yang Ye passed through space. He’d just passed through it like that!

“Haha!! I finally have the little fellow’s ability. I’m definitely going to compete with the little fellow when I see her again!” Yang Ye roared with extremely complacent laughter.

He laughed complacently for a while before his gaze descended onto the sword.

The old man fell silent for a moment before he said, “This sword is the strongest amongst the 3 Dao Artifacts.”

“Oh?” Yang Ye’s interests were aroused, and he said, “Tell me about it!”

The old man said, “Even though it’s an Artificial Dao Artifact, it was renowned throughout the world over 10,000 years ago. It isn’t inferior to Natural Dao Artifacts. This sword has a trait that even Saint Realm experts fear, and it’s the ability to delay time.”

“Delay time?” Yang Ye frowned as he asked. “What do you mean?”

The old man said, “For example, you stabbed this sword at your opponent, and your opponent intended to evade your attack. However, this sword can slow your opponent’s time down. In other words, your opponent could have dodged the attack, but your opponent’s time had been delayed. To put it simply, your opponent would have used a single breath of time to avoid your sword, but after your opponent’s time was delayed, your opponent would need one and a half breaths of time. Understand? Not to mention a breath of time, even an instant is of utmost important in a battle between experts. So, don’t you think this sword is terrifying?”

After he recovered from his shock, a thought suddenly appeared in Yang Ye’s mind. What would happen if I used Void Flash and Lag together?
