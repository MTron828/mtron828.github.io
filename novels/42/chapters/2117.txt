Chapter 2118 – Vanished Spirit Energy!

Until death!

Yang Ye’s thoughts were very simple. Since they wanted to kill him, he naturally planned to kill them!

The monk gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and nodded, “As you wish!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a robust monk appeared near Yang Ye. He had quite a ferocious look on his face, and he seemed extremely fierce.

The robust monk was a Sage!

As soon as the robust monk appeared here, the middle aged man stepped aside. At the same time, the scene here suddenly changed.

At this moment, Yang Ye and the robust monk were in a battlefield within a pocket of space.

While he’d killed a Sage before this, and his strength wasn’t the same anymore, he still didn’t act carelessly. The Buddhist Path had sent a Sage to fight him while knowing that he’d killed a Sage, so they were clearly confident.

There was a gap in strength between Sages too.

In the battlefield, the robust monk glanced at Yang Ye, and then he slammed a punch forward without saying a single word.

Boom!

In an instant, the battlefield shook violently.

At the moment the robust monk attacks, Yang Ye felt a wave of terrifying force assault him, and it made him feel like the sky was collapsing. Even his soul shuddered before its pressure.

The robust monk hadn’t held back at all, and he clearly planned to kill Yang Ye with overwhelming force!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slightly, and then a sword floated before him.

A sword howl resounded, and then the battlefield suddenly collapsed. The terrifying pressure emanated by the Sage collapsed along with the battlefield as well.

The surroundings suddenly fell silent.

Ten breaths of time later, Yang Ye and the robust Sage appeared before the temple once more. Both their faces were extremely calm, and it was impossible to see anything unusual from them.

Suddenly, the middle aged monk appeared at the side. The middle aged monk gazed at the robust monk, and the latter shook his head slightly, “I can’t kill him!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished into the sky.

He couldn’t kill Yang Ye!

So, he left without the slightest hesitation!

At the moment he exchanged blows with Yang Ye, the robust Sage could sense Yang Ye’s strength. Ordinary Sages couldn’t kill Yang Ye at all. Especially that attack Yang Ye launched at him, it was entirely capable of killing Sages. Moreover, it seemed like Yang Ye wasn’t forcefully using a secret technique to obtain such strength. In other words, it was part of Yang Ye’s true strength.

Even though he’d successfully defended himself against that attack, he wasn’t confident in resisting a second, or a third. So, he’d decisively chosen to leave.

Yang Ye was quite surprised by this. He hadn’t expected the robust Sage to leave in such a decisive manner, and he was even planning on trying the sword technique he’d just created! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Master Yang, you’re truly amazing!” Meanwhile, the middle aged monk said, “Looks like my Buddhist Path can’t keep you here. Please feel free to leave!”

Yang Ye asked, “Are you not going to send another Sage?”

The middle aged man shook his head slightly, “That does not conform with the rules.”

Yang Ye smiled, “The Buddhist Path takes rules strictly?”

The middle aged monk replied, “Some rules must be observed. Otherwise, the entire large universe will fall into chaos.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “I noticed that you’re not an absolutely evil person, so allow me to say a little more. Killing too much will result in karma coming for you. It may not come now or in your current lifetime, but it will definitely arrive in your next life. Goodness and evil are always repaid. I hope you understand.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Let’s not talk about such nonsense. I have a question for you. I heard that monkey from the demon race came to the Buddhist Dimension. Do you know where he is now?”

He naturally hadn’t forgotten about the monkey.

The middle aged monk couldn’t help but glance at Yang Ye upon hearing this, “As expected, you know that monkey.”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s not illegal, right?”

The middle aged monk replied, “Of course. However, allow me to say a little bit about that. That monkey killed many disciples of my Buddhist Path, so my Buddhist Path is determined to eliminate him. No one can stop us.”

Yang Ye smiled, “That’s your business.”

He turned around and left.

He’d obtained the information he wanted. Since the middle aged monk had said that, it represented that the monkey was still alive.

The middle aged monk didn’t stop Yang Ye and just let Yang Ye leave.

Once Yang Ye left the Buddhist Dimension, he knew that he only had the Confucianist Path left.

He was about to head there when the space in front of him suddenly trembled, and then Yang Lianshuang’s voice came from there, “There’s a problem in the Human Dimension!”

The Human Dimension? Yang Ye frowned. Meanwhile, she continued, “We need to move away. Come to the Human Dimension.”

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to vanish on the spot.

A day later, Yang Ye arrived in the Human Dimension, and he couldn’t help but frown when he arrived here.

The spirit energy here was scarce!

The spirit energy in the Human Dimension was extremely scarce like it was a dimension on the verge of destruction.

“What’s going on?” Yang Ye frowned. He glanced at the surroundings and vanished on the spot. It didn’t take long for him to be reunited with Yang Lianshuang and the others.

Yang Lianshuang spoke solemnly, “The god race took action!”

“The god race?” Yang Ye asked, “The god race attacked the human race?”

She shook her head, “No, they didn’t send any forces to attack the Human Dimension, and they just used this method of attack instead.”

Yang Ye asked, “Spirit energy?”

She nodded, “I’m sure you’ve noticed that the spirit energy here is vanishing rapidly. The Sages of the human race have started investigating, and they think you helped the god race do this!”

“What?” Yang Ye was astounded, “Me? Are they kidding?”

Yang Lianshuang explained, “To be more precise, they think it was Snowy. They say your Sprite Lord is helping the god race. Just think about it, besides Snowy, ordinary people are utterly incapable of taking away the spirit energy of an entire world.”

Yang Ye said, “It wasn’t Snowy.”

While Snowy could do that… Or it should be said that she should be able to do that, he would never let her. Because taking away the spirit energy of a world would be no different than annihilating the living beings of an entire world, and they would become the public enemy of that entire world. At that time, the experts of the entire Human Dimension would pursue him and Snowy. Moreover, Snowy was kindhearted, and she wouldn’t do something so horrible.

Yang Lianshuang asked, “Did you really not do this?”

Yang Ye glanced at her with a displeased look, “Why would I lie to you?”

She shook her head, “Even if I believe you, the human race won’t. Now, they all think you and Snowy are helping the god race do this, and you’ve become the enemy of the entire human race.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. It’s quite a mountain of blame to shoulder!

Yang Lianshuang said, “Come with me!”

At this moment, Yang Ye was in a boundless mountain range, and the spirit energy here had become scarce too. It would take just a few months for all the spirit energy here to vanish. Moreover, according to Yang Ye’s estimations, besides the paradises and hallowed grounds of the human race, the spirit energy in the entire Human Dimension would probably vanish in a month from now.

It was quite a serious situation!

Yang Ye followed Yang Lianshuang to an ancient city, and he met Su Qingshi and the others here. He was about to catch up with them when Yang Lianshuang dragged him into a hall.

Only Su Qingshi and Yang Lianshuang were here.

Yang Lianshuang said, “I didn’t interrupt your reunion on purpose. This incident is quite serious, and we don’t have time.”

Yang Ye asked, “What do you plan to do?”

“Move!” She continued, “no matter what, we can’t stay in the Human Dimension. The Human Dimension hasn’t fallen into chaos yet, but it’ll take two weeks at most. If the issue isn’t resolved by then, the Human Dimension will fall into absolute chaos. We must leave before that happens. Otherwise, if we’re swept into it, it won’t be beneficial to us at all. Conversely, we may face annihilation.”

Yang Ye thought for a long time and said, “Where will you go?”

She shook her head slightly, “I don’t have a good idea yet. So, I called you here to discuss the matter. Where do you think is suitable?”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “The Dao Path…”

Yang Ye had only said this much when she shook her head, “No!”

Yang Ye was puzzled by this, “Why?”

She explained, “As far as I’m concerned, your relationship with the Dao Path isn’t reliable at all. If something happens, not only will we gain no protection from them, we may even fall into their control instead.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded. What she said made sense. Even he didn’t think his relationship with the Dao Path was reliable.

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “I can’t think of anywhere else. Because of the god race, I’m afraid there isn’t a place in the large universe that will be peaceful!”

Yang Lianshuang replied, “Indeed. So, we have a problem. The human race will definitely stop at nothing to find you. As far as they are concerned, finding you is equivalent to finding your Sprite Lord, and she’s the only way for them to restore the spirit energy in the Human Dimension.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Snowy and I really have no choice but to take the blame for this?”

“What do you think?” She continued, “Who else can you think of? Of course, they know that it was the god race. But the problem is that if the god race doesn’t show itself, they can’t be found at all. Moreover, the human race doesn’t dare to go head-on against the god race with the strength they possess! As far as they’re concerned, the best course of action is to find you and Snowy.”

Yang Ye frowned. He was about to speak when the space in front of Yang Lianshuang trembled. A short while passed before she looked up at Yang Ye, “The spirit energy in the Sky Dimension is vanishing as well. Now, the entire sky race and human race has started to hunt you and Snowy like madmen. Both of you are in huge trouble!”
