Chapter 2309 – Moving Mountains!

The sword!

While Yang Ye was practicing in the saber, he was a sword cultivator!

A formidable sword cultivator!

The old man had overlooked that until now. Because Yang Ye had been constantly using the saber. But just a moment ago, Yang Ye had suddenly used the sword and caught him off guard, causing him to suffer an injury! Even if it wasn’t huge or serious.

But the old man was extremely shocked!

Yang Ye’s saber technique, the Madness Saber Technique, allowed Yang Ye to swing 100 attacks in a breath of time, and all 100 overlapped with each other. It could be said to be at Yang Ye’s limit because every single swing carried his full strength. The Madness Saber Technique excelled in its explosive force in an instant by overlapping so many attacks. It was like chopping a tree at the exact same spot, so it wouldn’t take long for the tree to be chopped down. Conversely, if every single hit didn’t descend on the same spot, it would definitely take much longer to chop down the same tree!

100 strikes in a breath of time was Yang Ye’s limit!

That was what the old man thought, and reality was no different from his expectations. But he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to use his sword to continue the attack, and he never imagined the transition to be so fluid! Because Madness Saber Technique required the support of Profound Primal Energy, and those 100 swings exhausted all of it. That was why Yang Ye left every single time he finished swinging 100 times.

It was because he had no more Profound Primal Energy!

But his sword didn’t use Profound Primal Energy. In other words, Yang Ye was in a completely new state when he raised his sword upon using his Madness Saber Technique.

It could be said to be a move that perfected his technique.

“He injured you!” Suddenly, a voice came from the side.

The old man looked over and saw Butcher. But at this moment, Butcher was in quite an embarrassing state. Butcher’s face had a deep bloody injury, and it was still open, so blood was seeping out incessantly from it. Besides that, there were around 10 more bloody injuries throughout his body. Every single one of them was extremely deep. Besides that, he was holding a big black bag in his hand. However, Butcher’s eyes were filled with surprise right now.

The old man replied indifferently, “I was caught off guard…”

Meanwhile, Butcher walked over to Yang Ye and sized him up. Suddenly, Yang Ye tightened his grip on the chopper and seemed like he was about to attack. However, he didn’t do so in the end and just walked away.

“I keep having the feeling that he’s putting on an act!” The old man continued, “Did you see that? He’s absolutely smart. He refuses to fight those who are too strong, and he refuses to fight when his Profound Primal Energy is depleted too. Dammit! Which madman is that intelligent?”

Butcher replied, “I didn’t expect him to be able to attain the 1st level in such a short while. Moreover, that saber technique… It was something he comprehended himself. Be honest, what do you think of it?”

The old man fell silent for a short while and replied, “It isn’t a huge threat to someone like me. However, if it’s against True Dao Realm or True Void Realm experts… It would be a nightmare for them. Actually, I’m more amazed by his ability to merge the saber and sword as one. That attack with his sword was truly perfection.”

He gazed at Butcher and continued, “This kid is absolutely ruthless, and his combat instinct is formidable too. I’m certain that he fought his way to where he is right now. Otherwise, it’s impossible to possess such instinct in his realm of cultivation, and it’s impossible for him to be so ruthless. In short, you got lucky. Even if that kid can’t surpass the founding ancestor of your sect, I’m certain he won’t bring shame to your sect, and he may even allow the Primal Era’s Primal Saber Sect to be renowned in the world once more and go down in history!

Butcher chuckled and gazed at the old man, “Second Brother, your evaluation of him is very high!”

The slovenly old man spoke softly, “To be honest, after knowing him for so long, I really admire that kid.”

He gazed at Butcher and continued, “Stop acting. You seemed like you were very unwilling to accept him, but you were actually overjoyed then, right?”

Butcher replied solemnly, “I’ll be honest. I really do like him. However, I’m really worried about his Slaughter Dao. Both his sword and saber are focused on slaughter. I’m sure you’re aware that the heavens do not tolerate the Slaughter Dao, and no one on that path has been able to avoid a tragic end!”

“I think this kid will be different!”

The slovenly old man spoke solemnly, “During the Primal Era, there were those who cultivated in the Slaughter Dao, but I’m sure you’re aware that they killed for the sake of killing, and they killed to grow stronger. But this kid uses slaughter to stop slaughter. If it wasn’t for that, Big Sis would absolutely not allow you to take him as your disciple or make me practice with him. In the end, he isn’t bad, he isn’t an unscrupulous person.”

Butcher chuckled, “Of course his character is fine. Otherwise, why would that girl stay by his side? Alright, that’s enough, I’m going to help that kid nourish his body. I’m going to improve that kid’s arms to be the point of the Moving Mountain Realm!”

The old man asked, “You killed that desolate ape?”

Butcher nodded, ‘Actually, I didn’t want to offend that animal, but it just had to come at me. So, I had no choice but to kill it.”

The old man glanced at Butcher and hesitated to finish, “But with your strength…”

Butcher spoke solemnly, “That sly old man lent me a hand!”

The slovenly old man refused to believe it, “He helped you?”

Butcher replied, “I said it was for that kid’s arms, and so he helped.”

The old man frowned slightly, “What is it that he sees in that kid? Or perhaps that kid is his illegitimate child?”

Butcher shook his head, “Forget that. I’m going to see that kid. I have to say that he really gave me a pleasant surprise. Haha!”

Butcher vanished on the spot.

The slovenly old man shook his head and returned to the village’s entrance.

…

In a stone house.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged as he meditated in cultivation. Butcher and Bai Zhixian weren’t too far away. There was a huge pot at the center of them, and Bai Zhixian was ceaselessly placing wood beneath the pot.

A pile of black meat was within the pot.

Bai Zhixian glanced at Butcher and asked, “Senior, what is this?”

Butcher stirred the meat in the pot, “Since you’re Big Sis’ disciple, you’re one of us. While we’re not from the same sect, you can still call me Third Martial Uncle.’

Bai Zhixian nodded slightly, “Third Martial Uncle!”

Butcher explained, “This is the meat of a desolate ape. It’s a descendant of a Primal Demon. If it’s judged based on the realms of cultivation in the outside world, it’s above the True World Realm. While its Primal Demon bloodline is scarce and impure, it still has some of it. So, it’s very beneficial, especially to this kid. This pot of meat will improve his arms by a level, or as my Primal Saber Sect calls it, the Moving Mountain Realm.”

“The Moving Mountain Realm?” Bai Zhixian asked, “A realm of body cultivation?”

Butcher shook his head, “No, it’s a realm of cultivating the arms in my Primal Saber Sect. Very few in my sect have ever cultivated the body, and most of us just cultivate the arms. The stronger your arms are, the stronger your blade will be. So, our ancestors created an arm cultivation technique, and it’s divided into three realms. The Moving Mountain Realm, Raising Ground Realm, and Heavenshaker Realm.”

Bai Zhixian said, “His body is already in the True Dao Realm. Is it beneficial to his saber technique?”

Butcher replied, “Of course. Not only is it beneficial, it’s very beneficial. Actually, I really admire him for being able to cultivate the body to such a level. Body cultivators have it the worst among all types of cultivators, so being able to cultivate his body to such an extent represents that he has suffered a lot!”

Bai Zhixian glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent.

“Alright!” Meanwhile, Butcher said, “Let him eat!”

“I want to eat too!” Suddenly, a young girl appeared nearby. It was Wang Erya!

Butcher glanced at her, “Go on, it’s enough for both of you!”

Wang Erya chuckled, ran over to the pot, and then scooped up a piece of meat and started eating.

Bai Zhixian walked over to Yang Ye’s side and patted him lightly on the shoulder. Yang Ye immediately opened his eyes, and she pointed at the meat in the pot, “Eat.”

Yang Ye gazed at the pot, and then he stood up, walked over, and scooped up a piece of meat. He was about to eat when he seemed to have thought of something, and then he swiftly turned around and passed it to Bai Zhixian.

Bai Zhixian was stunned.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye raised it to her again.

Bai Zhixian just gazed at Yang Ye, and two streams of clear tears gradually seeped out from the corners of her eyes. At this moment, her heart was slowly melting.

“You eat too!” Meanwhile, Butcher suddenly said, “It’s enough for all three of you, and it’s very beneficial to you too.”

Bai Zhixian accepted it from Yang Ye and started chewing gently.

It could be described as tasting terrible, but Bai Zhixian felt that it was exceptionally sweet. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Meanwhile, Wang Erya cursed as she ate, “Butcher, can’t you cook it a little better? How did you make something that tastes so terrible?!”

Butcher replied indifferently, “You don’t have to eat it!”

Wang Erya glared at him, “I won’t once I’m full!”

Butcher was at a loss for words.

It didn’t take long for the entire pot to be shared amongst them.

Once she finished eating, Wang Erya patted her stomach, “I’m going to sleep. Butcher, don’t forget to call me next time!”

She vanished into the distance once she finished speaking.

Bai Zhixian glanced at Wang Erya’s vanishing figure and said, ‘She’s really strong!”

Butcher spoke softly, “Her identity isn’t ordinary at all.”

Bai Zhixian was about to ask more when Butcher gazed at Yang Ye. He withdrew a jade bottle, “This is the Desolate Ape’s blood essence. Feed it to him, and it’ll rapidly activate the energy within him.”

Bai Zhixian nodded, took the bottle, and then poured the blood into Yang Ye’s mouth.

Three breaths of time later, Yang Ye’s blood vessels suddenly bulged up, and a wave of powerful energy surged through him.

Bai Zhixian was shocked and hurriedly gazed at Butcher. Butcher placed his right hand against Yang Ye’s head, and a wave of powerful energy descended upon Yang Ye, causing the energy within him to gradually converge into his arms.
