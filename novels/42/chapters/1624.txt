Chapter 1625 - The Martial Ancestor!

Translator: InVader

Martial Origin System.

Yang Ye had an extremely solemn expression on his face as he gazed at the distant stellar system. Because he sensed numerous powerful auras within it. Moreover, it gave him the feeling that the entire system was like a huge formation.

“The Martial Parade Formation!” Lu Lige suddenly said, “The entire system is a huge formation.”

“Such a huge formation!” Yang Ye asked, “Who created it?”

“Wu Mu.” Lu Lige continued, “The founder of the Wu Clan, and one of the few strongest people in the medium universe of Milky Way System. He was a peerless genius. According to legend, he merely had to take a look and could immediately learn any technique. Moreover, he could even modify them and make them stronger.”

He turned to look at Yang Ye and continued, “Do you know what that represents? It represents that when others fight him, they just have to utilize their technique once and he’ll be able to copy it immediately. Moreover, he’ll be able to immediately modify the technique and use the same technique to defeat his opponent!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “What a monster!”

“That’s not all!” Lu Lige continued, “He’d grasped nine types of intents all those years ago. He’s the person who comprehended the most intents in the history of the medium universe in Milky Way System.”

Nine types of intents! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. It was something that couldn’t be described as just monstrous. However, An Nanjing wasn’t inferior. Because she’d grasped six types of intents now, and she’d even merged them into one. However, her intents became difficult to improve after they were merged into one.

Otherwise, if all her intents were at the Returnal Rank, then it wouldn’t just be terrifying, it would be absolutely terrifying.

At that time, even he wouldn’t be a match for her!

Meanwhile, Lu Lige continued, “Later on, he went into closed door cultivation for a hundred years. He studied techniques from all over the universe and modified them. So, many techniques in the world have been modified by him. It can be said that he alone pushed our medium world’s development forward tremendously. It was also this contribution that made everyone respect him as the Martial Ancestor!”

The Martial Ancestor! A thought had suddenly appeared in Yang Ye’s mind, and it was one where he wondered if the Martial Ancestor or the Unfettered One was more monstrous!

“All those years ago, that era was the Wu Clan’s era!” Lu Lige continued, “The Wu Clan was the strongest during that time, and it was so strong that the other seven clans had no choice but to join forces against it.”

Yang Ye asked, “They joined forces?”

Lu Lige nodded, “Actually, it’s very normal. Let me explain it like this. If any one of them gains a peerless genius capable of reigning supreme through the era, the other clans would definitely join forces against that clan. Otherwise, it’s very likely for them to be crushed, one by one.”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “The Yang Clan had a monstrous genius like that too?”

“Of course!” Lu Lige continued, “It isn’t just your Yang Clan, every one of them had such a monstrous genius in the past. The reason the eight clans reign supreme over the medium universe is because they once had such peerless geniuses. A single peerless genius is able to guarantee at least 10,000 years of life to a clan!”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Let’s not go further into detail. Come, let’s go see the wooden sword and stone tablet.”

“Alright!” As soon as he finished speaking, Lu Lige vanished on the spot, and Yang Ye immediately followed after him.

Martial Origin City.

They arrived at Martial Origin City under Lu Lige’s lead. It was the most bustling city in Martial Origin System, and it was the most populated city as well.

Even though he was mentally prepared, Yang Ye was still shocked by the sight of it.

It was huge!

The city was so huge that it completely exceeded his imagination. Just its walls were almost 2km tall. As for the width of it, he couldn’t even see the end of it.

“Don’t be shocked!” Lu Lige suddenly said, “This is nothing. If you enter the Martial Dimension, the buildings there are the truly shocking ones.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “The Martial Dimension?”

Lu Lige explained, “It’s where the members of the Wu Clan live. It’s not like this place. Not everyone can enter that place.”

He suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, “Are you really from the Yang Clan?”

Yang Ye asked, “Why do you ask that?”

Lu Lige replied, “because I noticed that you know nothing about Milky Way System. But even if you were sent away to temper yourself from a young age, it shouldn’t be to the extent of knowing nothing.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

“Lu Lige!” A voice suddenly resounded.

Yang Ye and Lu Lige turned towards its source, and they saw three men walking in their direction. Yang Ye noticed that Lu Lige’s face had turned gloomy at the sight of those three men.

It didn’t take long for them to walk over to Yang Ye and Lu Lige. The blue robed man who led the group chuckled, “I didn’t expect to encounter you here. I presume you’re here for that wooden sword and stone tablet as well.”

As he spoke, he sized up Lu Lige and continued, “Right, you’re only at the Dualism Realm right now. If you don’t have a Rebirth Fruit, it’ll take over ten years for you to attain the Rebirth Realm by yourself. However, it isn’t that easy to get a Rebirth Fruit!”

“Lu Yuan, are you done?” Lu Lige spoke coldly, “If you done, then fuck off.”

“How dare you!” Meanwhile, the white robed man on Lu Yuan’s right shouted angrily, “Lu Lige! How can you speak to your cousin brother like that?”

“My cousin brother?” Lu Lige laughed coldly, “Lu Lin, I’m not a member of the Lu Clan anymore.”

Lu Yuan shook his head, “Why do you have to act like this? You just have to admit your mistakes to the clan, and you’ll be immediately accepted back into the clan. As for that Rebirth Fruit, it’ll be right within your reach. Moreover, your accomplishments will be limited if you’re all alone without the support of the clan.”

“That’s my problem!” Lu Lige spoke indifferently, “Moreover, my presence doesn’t make a difference to the Lu Clan, right?”

“Fine!” Lu Yuan continued, “We’ll talk about it again next time.” He paused for a moment and continued, “I received news that you stole the Wang Clan’s Earth Spirit with Li Tianjiu. Do you have it with you?”

Lu Lige laughed coldly, “I was wondering why you were acting so differently. So it’s because of the Earth Spirit.”

Lu Yuan said, “I’m refining a defensive treasure, and it needs an equipment spirit. I’m sure you’re aware that Earth Spirits are the most suitable to be made into the equipment spirit of defensive treasures. I’ll get straight to the point. Give the Earth Spirit to me and I’ll get a Rebirth Fruit for you from the clan. Moreover, I’ll help speak on your behalf to get you back into the clan, alright?”

“Do you think I’m an idiot?” Lu Lige spoke coldly, “Lu Yuan, do you think I don’t know what kind of person you are? Besides that, the Earth Spirit isn’t in my possession. It’s with the Yang Clan’s Young Master Yang Yan. If you have the ability, go to the Yang Clan and ask him for it.”

Lu Yuan gazed at Lu Lige for a long time, and then he nodded, “Since you don’t have it, then forget it. Good luck to you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he glanced at Yang Ye, “Young Master Yang Yan has many capable subordinates!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m nothing. My Young Master is the true extraordinary genius. No, he’s a genius that reigns supreme through this era. Just wait and see. When he truly displays his might, you’ll realize how unlucky you are to be in the same era as him!”

Lu Lige was speechless.

“Is that so?” Lu Yuan continued, “So Young Master Yang Yan was concealing that much strength. I’m quite curious now. I really look forward to the moment he displays his strength. Farewell.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and left with the others.

“Be careful!” Lu Lige suddenly said, “That fellow only looks amiable on the outside, and he’s actually a ruthless person. His favorite thing is to treat someone like a brother and then stab that person in the back!”

Yang Ye nodded. He would naturally not underestimate the disciples of any clan. All of them were definitely not inferior in both strength and intellect.

“Let’s go!” Lu Lige continued, “Let’s see if we can discover the secrets of that wooden sword and stone tablet.”

Yang Ye nodded.

Just like that, they arrived before a hall under Lu Lige’s lead. At this moment, many people were gathered before the hall.

A wooden sword and stone tablet were floating at the center of the hall’s entrance.

Yang Ye’s gaze instantly descended onto the wooden sword. The sword was huge. It was around 40 centimeters wide, and it was around two meters long.

It was a huge sword!

There were two lines of words on the huge sword. Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto the line of words on the left.

‘Can you give up the sword?’

Give up the sword? Yang Ye was stunned.

Can I? Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

If I do, then how will I save Little Sky? How will I participate in the Yang Clan’s fight for succession? How will I fight Yang Yan and Yang Danqing? How will I protect my loved ones?

Yang Ye suddenly became quite afraid when he thought up to this point.

He was afraid of losing the sword!

Because if he lost the sword, it represented that he would lose many things, and it may even include his life. After all, if he had no sword, then not to mention killing Zenith Realm experts, even killing Rebirth Realm experts would be quite strenuous for him!

No!

That was Yang Ye’s answer to the question!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at the second line of words, and he was stunned on the spot when he saw it.

‘You think you’ve enslaved your sword, but you do not realize that you’ve been enslaved by the sword.’
