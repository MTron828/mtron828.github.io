Chapter 2125 – Evil Yin Sprite!

The expressions of everyone from the Alliance of All had turned extremely unsightly, or it should be described as pale!

It was like all of them had seen something terrifying!

Indeed, what was happening to the large universe was very terrifying!

There were countless worlds vanishing rapidly throughout the large universe. Every single world was covered in tsunamis, earthquakes, fissures, volcanic eruptions…

If someone stood high up in the starry sky right now, one would be able to see countless stars exploding apart like fireworks. World after world were being destroyed throughout the large universe.

As far as Sages were concerned, destroying a world wasn’t difficult at all, and it didn’t take much effort either. They just had to use the power of nature in that world. For example, make it explode from deep underground and make lava flow to the surface. The ground would be instantly destroyed. Conversely, they could cause tsunamis by triggering the undersea volcanoes…

Who suffered the most from the destruction of every world?

The living beings of the large universe!

Was it cruel?

War was always cruel.

“How dare you!” Suddenly, a furious shout resounded, and then a black robed mysterious figure appeared not too far away from Ding Shaoyao. As soon as the figure appeared, a wave of powerful energy blasted Ding Shaoyao away.

Yang Ye’s reaction was swift, and he hurriedly appeared behind her and caught her from behind. However, as soon as he touched her, his expression had changed drastically.

Bang!

Ding Shaoyao’s figure stopped, but Yang Ye’s figure was blasted over 3km away.

When he finally stopped himself, Yang Ye looked down at himself, and he noticed that his entire body had cracked open!

It was terrifying!

Yang Ye looked up at the mysterious black robed man, Is he a progenitor?

Ding Shaoyao wiped off the blood on the corner of her mouth, and then she gazed at the mysterious figure, “What? You’re showing yourself in the end?”

The mysterious figure said, “Make them stop! Otherwise, I’ll make living worse than death for your god race!”

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “I don’t think you have the ability to do that!”

Everyone looked towards the source of the voice, and they saw a woman walking over slowly.

It was Zhi’er.

She walked over to Ding Shaoyao’s side, and then she gazed at the mysterious figure, “Do you really think we weren’t prepared for you?”

As soon as she said that…

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Electricity started hissing here. Everyone here was shocked, and it didn’t take long for a blood red character to appear in the sky.

It was the ‘杀’ character!

The character for kill had appeared out of thin air in the sky.

As soon as it appeared there…

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Snowy suddenly let out a shrill cry, and she curled up on the ground while holding her head with both paws. She was shuddering while fear filled her eyes. Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly entered the Primordial Pagoda and took Snowy in his arms, “Sno-Snowy, what’s wrong?”

Snowy just held tightly to Yang Ye while ceaselessly rubbing her head against Yang Ye’s chest. Her body was trembling madly as if she’d encountered something horrifying. Moreover, Snowy wasn’t the only one, even Little Sky and the Divine Yin Flame were trembling violently.

Fear!

It was fear!

Yang Ye was instantly in panic!

Suddenly, he looked up at the sky, “Primordial Pagoda!”

As soon as he said that, a ray of golden light descended from the sky and enveloped Snowy, but it didn’t change anything!

What the heck is this? Even the Primordial Pagoda can’t do anything?

It’s definitely that character in the sky!

Yang Ye was about to leave the Primordial Pagoda when he thought up to this point. Suddenly, Tian Xiu said, “Big Brother, give Snowy to me!”

Yang Ye gazed at Tian Xiu and didn’t ask anything. He just passed Snowy to her. Tian Xiu placed her hand on Snowy’s head and spoke softly, “Snowy, don’t be afraid. I guarantee that no one can harm you while I’m here…”

As she spoke, Snowy’s figure gradually calmed down.

Meanwhile, Little Sky and the Divine Yin Flame appeared by Tian Xiu’s side. At this moment, Little Sky’s face was covered in pain, and her eyes had undisguised fear and terror in them!

Yang Ye hurriedly said, “Tian Xiu, help them too!”

Tian Xiu gazed at Little Sky and the Divine Yin Flame, fell silent for a moment, and then looked up at the sky, “Go away!”

She received no reply, and Little Sky and the Divine Yin Flame were still trembling.

Tian Xiu’s gaze gradually turned icy cold, “I-Told-You-To-Leave!”

As soon as she finished speaking, a moment of silence ensued, and then both Little Sky and the Divine Yin Flame gradually calmed down.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief when he witnessed this, and then he asked, “What was that?”

Tian Xiu thought for a moment and said, “I don’t know either. I just sensed something looking at us. Right, it was looking at Snowy, and Big Sister Little Sky, and this flame. It seemed like it wanted to eat Snowy and the others!”

Eat them? Yang Ye frowned. He didn’t thank her and just rubbed her head, “Tian Xiu, help me take care of them. I’ll go have a look outside.”

“Be careful, Big Brother!” Tian Xiu spoke abruptly, “That thing is very formidable. You are probably not a match for it right now.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’ll be careful.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he left the Primordial Pagoda.

At the instant that Snowy, Little Sky, and the Divine Yin Flame were in pain, the mysterious figure outside the Primordial Pagoda had spoken involuntarily, “The Evil Yin Sprite! Impossible…”

When he spoke up to this point, he suddenly vanished into the sky.

The ‘杀’ character in the sky shook violently and wanted to chase after him, but Ding Shaoyao said, “There’s no need to give chase. You can’t do anything to her now.”

The ‘杀’ character in the sky gradually vanished after a moment of silence.

Meanwhile, Ding Shaoyao gazed at Yang Ye, “Is Snowy alright?”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “She’s much better now. What was that?”

Ding Shaoyao replied, “The true bane of Sprites, or it can be called their natural enemy.”

The natural enemy of Sprites? Yang Ye frowned slightly.

He was about to ask about it when Ding Shaoyao said, “I’ll explain it to you later.”

As she spoke, she walked towards the Sovereign of Sky’s group, “I presume the spirit energy in the Human Dimension and Sky Dimension have been restored, right?”

“How did you know?!” The Sovereign of Sky spoke in a low voice. Just a moment ago, he’d received word that the spirit energy in the Sky Dimension had been restored. Moreover, even the spirit energy in the Human Dimension and Demon Dimension had been restored.

Ding Shaoyao spoke indifferently, “Do you know who that was?”

The Sovereign of Sky spoke solemnly, “I have a guess.”

Ding Shaoyao asked, “Now do you understand the reason for all of this?”

The Sovereign of Sky glanced at her, “Why did she do that?”

“That’s quite a stupid question!” Ding Shaoyao continued, “Since you know the reason, leave. There will be a battle between us, but it isn’t now. Don’t worry, you won’t have to wait for too long.”

The Sovereign of Sky gazed at her for a long time and said, “We’ll be waiting!”

He turned around and planned to lead the others away once he finished speaking.

Meanwhile, the Sovereign of Man suddenly asked, “Why aren’t we dealing with them now?”

The Sovereign of Sky glanced at him and replied, “Do you think we can?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he led the experts of the sky race away, and the other experts received the order to retreat as well.

The Alliance of All’s army retreated like a receding tide.

The battlefield returned to peace once more!

Once all of them left, Ding Shaoyao suddenly said, “Tell them to stop.”

Zhi’er nodded, “They have.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Ding Shaoyao gazed at Yang Ye, “Let’s go!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she waved her hand. In an instant, the ground trembled, and then it cracked open before them to reveal a passageway.

All of them went in with Zhi’er and Ding Shaoyao in the lead.

Yang Ye followed them to an underground world, and it surpassed his imagination. It was an empty city.

There were some people in it, but very few. Just around a dozen of them, so it was really an empty city.

Ding Shaoyao suddenly asked, “Are you curious?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She said, “Our people are hidden throughout the world.”

Yang Ye glanced at her. Needless to say, he really admired her. Her level of planning was truly matchless, and Ding Shaoyao could be said to have contributed tremendously in the god race’s ability to take the other races for a ride.

Ding Shaoyao and Zhi’er led Yang Ye to a hall, and there were only three people there.

Zhi’er asked, “Do you have any plans for the future?”

Yang Ye gazed at her and said, “No, I just want to survive.”

Zhi’er said, “Survive? That will be the most difficult thing to accomplish in this large universe soon. It’s really going to fall into complete chaos, and it isn’t just limited between my god race and the other races, there are other powers too. I suggest that you leave the large universe as soon as possible.”

Yang Ye asked, “Leave the large universe? And go where?”

She replied, “Anywhere. It’s fine so long as you’re not in the large universe!”

Yang Ye asked, “What exactly is about to happen here?”

Zhi’er gazed at Ding Shaoyao, and the latter said, “He can’t escape. He has a Sprite Lord, and he’s mixed up in the karma of many powers. They won’t let him leave.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Presently, you can forget about escaping. You should focus your attention on improving your strength!”

Yang Ye nodded. Presently, the important matter at hand for him was improving his strength. He had to improve his strength in all aspects. Because when facing the colossus that was the Alliance of All and some other mysterious organizations, he would probably not even have the right to be cannon fodder if he didn’t possess some strength.

Ding Shaoyao was about to speak when something unexpected occurred. A blood red ‘杀’ character flashed by and entered Yang Ye’s chest.

“How dare you!” Ding Shaoyao roared with fury, “Stop it! Hurry! Snowy’s in danger! That pagoda can’t suppress it!”
