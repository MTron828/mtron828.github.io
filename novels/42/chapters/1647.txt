Chapter 1648 - I’ll Write My Name In Reverse!

Translator: InVader

Dead or alive!

Everyone here was shocked by An Nanjing again!

My god! Those are 23 Zenith Realm experts!

23 Zenith Realm experts! They aren’t ordinary Zenith Realm experts either! They are the 72 warriors of the Yang Clan! They are the Yang Clan’s elites!

None of them had attained the Zenith Realm through the help of external forces. It could be said that every single one of them wasn’t weaker than Yang Xu!

Besides that, there was a Half-Step True Realm expert here as well!

A Half-Step True Realm expert and 23 Zenith Realm experts. Such a force was sufficient to sweep through numerous large worlds. Not to mention large worlds, they could even besiege and kill a True Realm expert.

But An Nanjing was just at the Rebirth Realm!

Just the Rebirth Realm!

Lu Lige glanced at her, and his eyelids twitched. She’s a little heaven defying!

Even though he seemed quite composed, he actually was actually filled with despair.

After all, 23 Zenith Realm experts and a Half-Step True Realm expert would instill despair in anyone!

Yang Ye gazed at An Nanjing for a long time and said, “Dead.”

An Nanjing nodded slightly, and then she gazed at Yang Lang. Her figure immediately vanished on the spot, and she was in front of Yang Lang when she appeared once more. After that, Skysplit swiftly stabbed forward.

Her spear was like a thunderbolt that flashed forward!

Yang Lang’s eyes narrowed slightly. He clenched his right fist and slammed it forward!

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and then both of them were pushed backwards. It didn’t take long for An Nanjing to stop herself, but Yang Lang was still moving backwards, and he only stopped after moving almost 150m back!

Shocked!

Everyone was shocked!

Their gazes had descended onto An Nanjing, and they felt beyond shocked at this moment.

When she completely crushed Yang Xu, they knew that she was very strong, but they hadn’t expected her to be this strong!

After all, Yang Lang was a Half-Step True Realm expert!

However, he’d been at a disadvantage in their collision!

Yang Lang’s face gradually became solemn because An Nanjing’s strength had exceeded his expectations!

Once she stopped herself, An Nanjing’s right leg moved back slightly, and she pressed her toes against the ground while slowly lifting Skysplit in her right hand. After that, she said, “Moon Piercer!”

She pushed against the ground with her right foot and instantly transformed into a ray of golden light. Everywhere she passed, space was instantly torn open.

Yang Lang’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he clenched his right fist tightly. As soon as his fist was fully clenched, the space around him warped, and then he slammed it forward.

Crack!

The space around him cracked open.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing had arrived before him.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded, and then a terrifying wave of energy swept out from where Yang Lang had been standing. However, it took just an instant for the golden light to tear it into pieces.

The surroundings instantly became calm once more!

At this moment, An Nanjing was standing where Yang Lang had been, and Yang Lang was over 300m away! Moreover, his entire right arm had cracked open, and blood was seeping out incessantly. In an instant, his entire arm was covered in blood.

In their second clash, Yang Lang had once again fallen to a disadvantage!

Suddenly, An Nanjing tapped her foot against the ground. In an instant, she seemed like a butterfly that floated off in Yang Lang’s direction. When she arrived around 3m above him, she took Skysplit in both hands and swung it down at him, “Space Slasher!”

Crack!

As soon as her voice resounded, the space in a huge area cracked apart in an instant!

Yang Lang’s eyes narrowed slightly while seriousness filled them. He immediately flipped his palm, and a round black shield appeared in his grasp. After that, he raised it above him!

Clang!

An ear piercing sound of metal colliding resounded, and then Yang Lang was blasted back along with his shield, and he only stopped after being pushed almost 2km away!

“Skysplit!” Suddenly, An Nanjing’s voice resounded again.

Everyone looked over towards her. They saw her body moved slightly to the side, and she held Skysplit tightly in her right grasp as she spun on the ground using the tip of her foot. After spinning an entire 360 degrees, she tossed Skysplit at Yang Lang!

Hiss! Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Skysplit transformed into a ray of golden light as it shot forward, and space was torn into bits in its wake.

Yang Lang’s pupils constricted slightly. He didn’t dare act carelessly in the slightest. A terrifying imposing aura swept out from his body while the black shield in his grasp instantly flew towards Skysplit!

After that, he overlapped his palms and pushed them forward. The space before him overlapped like waves and surged forward!

Bang!

The black shield immediately shattered upon coming into contact with Skysplit, and Skysplit itself didn’t slow down at all as it shot towards Yang Lang.

Hiss!

When it entered the rippling expanse of space, the collision caused that area of space to explode apart. However, Skysplit still hadn’t slowed down at all!

Bang!

Meanwhile, that expanse of space shattered into bits, and then a figure was blasted out of the area.

It was Yang Lang!

Yang Lang’s figure stopped after flying over 3km away. As soon as he fell to the ground, the ground beneath his feet collapsed! At the same time, his figure continued backwards while scraping against the ground.

He finally stopped after being pushed around another 1km back, and then a mouthful of blood sprayed from his mouth.

Silent!

The surroundings were deathly silent!

Everyone gazed at An Nanjing. This time, it wasn’t shock that was in their eyes, it was astonishment.

Rebirth Realm experts fighting Zenith Realm experts wasn’t new in the medium world of Milky Way System, and this included Rebirth Realm experts killing Zenith Realm experts. However, it was extremely rare for a Rebirth Realm expert to defeat a Half-Step True Realm expert.

Moreover, An Nanjing hadn’t just defeated one, she was completely crushing him in battle!

A Rebirth Realm expert was suppressing a Half-Step True Realm expert in battle!

At this moment, everyone was curious about An Nanjing’s identity. Because it was the first time that they’d ever seen her, and they’d never heard of her as well.

Meanwhile, high above in the sky.

Yang Gu and Yang Ceng’s gazes were on An Nanjing. A short moment of silence ensued before Yang Gu spoke solemnly, “I’m afraid even we wouldn’t be able to defeat her with certainty!”

Yang Ceng nodded, “This is probably not her true strength. Her true strength…”

Both of their faces grew solemn.

At the same time, the black robed old man behind Yang Jiang spoke solemnly, “She’s strong!”

Yang Jian gazed at An Nanjing for a long time and said, “Very strong.”

On the other side, Gu Xiu gazed at Yang Xuan and asked, “Who’s she?”

Yang Xuan glanced at An Nanjing before shaking her head.

Gu Xiu glanced at Yang Xuan and didn’t speak another word.

Meanwhile, Yang Lang wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and gazed at An Nanjing, “The Rebirth Realm… Haha! I never imagined that I would one day be suppressed by a Rebirth Realm cultivator. Good! Very good! Each new generation really does excel above the last!”

As he spoke, he took a step forward, and then a faint blood red glow appeared around him. At the same time, blood red lines appeared abruptly on his face!

Blood vessels!

At this moment, the blood vessels throughout his body had swelled up, and then his aura immediately started to rise madly. At the same time, his eyes started to gradually turn blood red.

Bloodline Energy!

The Mad Demon Bloodline!

“He’s using his bloodline!” Yang Gu spoke solemnly, “Yang Lang is going to fight with his life on the line!”

“Of course he is!” Yang Ceng spoke indifferently, “He’ll die if he doesn’t. That little girl is so strong without even using her full strength. If she does use her full strengths… Tsk tsk…” He paused for a moment and continued, “Are we really not going to stop them?”

Yang Gu shook his head slightly, “We can’t stop them under such circumstances. At the very least, we aren’t able to.”

Yang Ceng shook his head and didn’t say another word.

Meanwhile, once he activated his bloodline, Yang Lang’s strength had instantly risen tremendously. A powerful aura surged out from him and made the space around him ripple.

Yang Lang looked up at An Nanjing while madness filled his eyes, “Come on!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot.

An Nanjing’s eyes narrowed slightly as she stabbed her spear forward.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then An Nanjing was blasted almost 1km away. As soon as she stopped herself, a few kilometers of the ground behind her cracked apart, and the cracks were still expanding rapidly!

Meanwhile, Yang Lang vanished once more, and the space in a huge area trembled violently at the same time!

They were ripples in space caused by Yang Lang’s extreme speed!

At the same time, An Nanjing was blasted another 1km away!

“Weren’t you very strong?” Yang Lang started walking slowly in An Nanjing’s direction. Every step he took caused space to tremble intensely.

Yang Ye was about to lend her a hand when An Nanjing shook her head, “I’ll do it myself.”

As she spoke, she stretched out her right hand, grabbed her ponytail, and wrapped it around her neck. After that, she started walking towards Yang Lang while holding Skysplit in her grasp, “If I can’t kill you in three moves, then I! Will write my name in reverse!”

All the spectators were stunned speechless.
