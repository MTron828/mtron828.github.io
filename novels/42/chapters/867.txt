The Dao Order.

At this moment, the members of the Ancient Sword School were in intense battle with Third and Fourth below the Cloud Ascension Stairs.

Third was at the Monarch Realm, and his opponent was Nalan Ying. Both of them had been locked in battle for a long time. Nalan Ying was in a disadvantaged position, and she was only barely able to stand her ground in battle with him.

As for Fourth, there were around 20 corpses on the ground near him, and all of them belonged to the disciples of the Ancient Sword School. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Bang!

An Exalt Realm cultivator of the Ancient Sword School was blasted flying, and then his body exploded apart in midair and transformed into a rain of blood.

“Too weak!” Fourth shook his head and said, “Yang Ye didn’t come, so stop wasting time and just fight me all together!”

“Tsk, tsk. The Exalt Realm disciples of the Ancient Sword School are truly in a horrible state. There actually isn’t a single person who’s a match for that fellow, Fourth, from the Dao Order. Moreover, none of them was able to resist even 3 moves from him. Tsk, tsk. Does the Ancient Sword School have no one capable in the Exalt Realm? Will they just insist on sending these fellows to their doom?”

“How could they not have anyone capable? Isn’t Yang Ye one?”

“Yang Ye? Don’t even mention him, he’s just a coward who’s afraid of death. He would be here if he dared to come. But he still hasn’t arrived until now. He’s probably afraid of coming and dying here. Alas, what a pity. These disciples of the Ancient Sword School are clearly aware that they are no match for him, yet they still insist on fighting him in succession.”

“It’s all that fellow, Yang Ye’s, fault. If you don’t dare to come yourself, then don’t talk big! Now, he boasted but didn’t come, and it made these other members of the Ancient Sword School come give their lives away. I truly look down on such a person!”

“Perhaps he was delayed by something? After all, Yang Ye doesn’t seem like someone who’s afraid of death no matter how you look at him!”

“If he does come, then I, Ning Tao, will fucking eat 5 kilograms of shit!”

Suddenly, the space before the man who spoke those words trembled violently, and then a rift appeared there. After that, a man was tossed out from within it.

Everyone here was stunned.

“Where am I?” The man glanced at the surroundings and was slightly dazed.

“He’s Yang Ye! He’s Yang Ye!” Someone suddenly pointed at the man and roared loudly with happiness and excitement.

Yang Ye!

Everyone here shot their gazes over towards the man.

He was naturally Yang Ye. At this moment, he was quite dazed indeed. Because he’d just charged out of his room before the world around him spun, and then he’d arrived here.

Yang Ye seemed to have recalled something, and he suddenly grabbed that man, Ning Tao, who stood in front of him and said, “What time is it now?”

Ning Tao gulped and said, “It’s... it’s almost dawn....”

“Almost dawn?” Yang Ye was stunned, and then his expression changed, “Fuck! I’m going to be late! Those bastards from the Dao Order wouldn’t think that I’m afraid of them, right? Which direction is the Dao Order at?”

Ning Tao was speechless.

Yang Ye frowned, and then he glanced at the surroundings. Suddenly, he saw Chen Dong and Wu Yanzhong. If Yang Ye still didn’t understand where he was now, then there would really be a problem with his intelligence.

Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto the corpses of the disciples from the Ancient Sword School, and a long time passed before he withdrew his gaze. After that, he glanced at the other members of the Ancient Sword School and said, “I won’t try to apologize. I’ll make the Dao Order pay with the lives of 2 for every single person from the Ancient Sword School that died here today, alright?”

A long moment of silence ensued before one of the disciples from the sword school stepped forward and said, “If you can do that, then I’ll still call you senior brother in the future, and I’ll follow your every command!”

“Me too!”

“Count me in!”

“Me....”

Yang Ye was late and a few dozen disciples of the Ancient Sword School had fallen. So, they were naturally resentful in their hearts. While they knew that Yang Ye had probably been delayed by something, it was an undeniable fact that the sword school had lost a few dozen of its disciples. However, the resentment in their hearts had dispersed quite a bit when they saw Yang Ye. After all, he’d come!

Chen Dong and Wu Yanzhong walked over to Yang Ye, and then Chen Dong patted Yang Ye on the shoulder and said, “Be careful. That fellow’s strength is greater than Nan Ketu!”

Wu Yanzhong spoke as well, “You better not die. Otherwise, our Ancient Sword School wouldn’t just suffer a huge amount of losses this time, it would even be utterly disgraced!”

Yang Ye chuckled, and then he walked over to Fourth and said, “Before I came here, Daoist Gu said that I should just teach the Dao Order’s disciples a good lesson and try my best not to cause any deaths. After all, I’m here to resolve the enmity between me and the Dao Order. In the beginning, I had the exact same thoughts, but now... I think that I should change those thoughts!”

Fourth walked slowly towards Yang Ye as he spoke, “There’s no need to change anything because you won’t have the chance to realize any of them!”

Suddenly, the space in front of Yang Ye wriggled, and then a huge sword appeared in front of him. The sword was extremely large and even taller than him. As for its width, it was almost 50 centimeters! Yang Ye was slightly stunned when he laid eyes on the huge sword because it felt slightly familiar to him.

Meanwhile, Daoist Gu’s voice suddenly resounded in his mind, “That was created by modifying your hammer. I added a few hundred types of materials. Not only has it maintained the effects of that hammer, it’s even able to amplify your sword energy. Besides that, it has no other effects. But it should be absolutely suitable for you. Because you can swing it as a sword and smash with it like a hammer! Unfortunately, I didn’t have a suitable Equipment Spirit for it, otherwise it would be even stronger!”

Yang Ye was overjoyed when he heard this! After all, the Herculean Hammer wasn’t bad in the past because it could amplify his physical strength, and it was even heavy like a mountain. So, an ordinary cultivator wouldn’t even be able to resist a single strike from it. But its only flaw was that it couldn’t be used as a sword. Of course, at his level of cultivation, anything and everything could be used as a sword. However, the Herculean Hammer wasn’t made to be used by a sword cultivator, so it couldn’t carry his sword energy at all!

Moreover, even if it could, wouldn’t it be very troublesome to use a hammer as a sword in battle? After all, a hammer was very different from a sword.

Yet now, the Herculean Hammer had been modified and transformed into a sword. Not only could it be used as a sword, but it could also still be used to hammer others. Just as Daoist Gu had said, it really was suitable for him!

“I’ll call you the Herculean Sword from now on!” Yang Ye chuckled as he grabbed the Herculean Sword’s hilt with his right hand. It had just entered his grasp when Yang Ye’s figure bent forward. Moreover, the Herculean Sword had almost fallen out of his grasp!

Yang Ye was shocked because the Herculean Sword was extremely heavy!

“You can’t even lift your sword?” Meanwhile, there was a wisp of ridicule on the corners of Fourth’s mouth.

Yang Ye paid no attention to him. He just tightened his grip on the sword’s hilt before raising it swiftly. He’d succeeded at raising the sword, but it was very strenuous. Not to mention using it in battle, even walking was a problem for him right now!

What exactly did Daoist Gu add into it? Even cold sweat had started to emerge from Yang Ye’s skin. How terrifying was his physical strength right now? It was comparable to a demon beast at the mid rank Half-Saint Realm, but he was actually unable to even lift this sword with a single hand!

“I don’t have time to waste on you!” Fourth flipped his palm, and a golden rod appeared in his grasp. He shook his wrist lightly, and then numerous rod images enveloped down towards Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he punched with his left fist!

Bang!

A blast of force surged out from his fist, and it caused the space before him to instantly ripple violently. As for the rod images, they were struck to the point of dispersing into nothingness!

However, right when those rod images vanished, a ray of dazzling golden light flashed, and then a golden rod arrived before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s expression didn’t change at all, and he just punched once more with his left fist. His fist smashed against the tip of the rod!

Bang!

An explosion resounded from the point of collision, and then a strand of powerful force came from the rod and entered Yang Ye’s fist. Yang Ye’s expression suddenly changed as he moved backwards repeatedly, and he took almost 10 steps back before he finally stopped.

The expressions of all the other disciples of the Ancient Sword School turned gloomy when they witnessed this scene, and there was even shock in their eyes!

Yang Ye’s physical body was comparable to the body of a demon beast at the Half-Saint Realm. So, it was absolutely terrifying! However, Fourth’s rod had actually been able to push him back!

Yang Ye’s brows knit together slightly as he glanced at his fist, and there was actually a depressed mark on his fist!

“There’s something strange about that rod!” Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto the rod. The rod had suddenly emanated a strand of powerful force earlier, and it had caught him slightly off guard and caused him to be pushed back!

Meanwhile, Fourth had a solemn expression in his eyes, and a long time passed before he spoke solemnly, “As expected of the person who killed Shadow and Nan Ketu. Not to mention that Sword Domain of yours, not more than 5 cultivators in the Exalt Realm throughout the north are able to be a match for you even if they only go against your physical strength!”

When he spoke up to this point, Fourth took a deep breath and said, “If we don’t fight a life and death battle, then we can probably fight for a few days and nights. I believe that you don’t have the time for that, and neither do I. So, how about we decide life and death with a single move?”

Yang Ye raised his head and glanced at the mountain which floated in the air, and he said, “Are you the strongest in the Exalt Realm throughout the Dao Order?”

Fourth shook his head and said, “I can be considered to be the 2nd. But it should be enough to kill you!”

Yang Ye replied, “Many have said the same to me in the past. But all of them are dead now!”

A wisp of a savage expression suddenly appeared on Fourth’s face, “I think that you’ll be the one to die this time!”

Yang Ye said, “Then why don’t you give it a try?”

“HAHAHA!” Fourth suddenly leaped up into the air, and then he looked down at Yang Ye from above, “Yang Ye, isn’t your body very strong? Let me show you what truly strong physical strength is like!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Fourth suddenly shook his golden rod in Yang Ye’s direction!

As soon as that happened, the golden rod suddenly started transforming, and then an enormous golden dragon which was almost 3km long appeared in the sky and covered the surroundings in its shadow.

“A divine dragon! It’s an Equipment Spirit!” Chen Dong had shock in his eyes.

Roar!

The enormous dragon suddenly roared, and a strand of terrifying pressure rained down from the sky. Countless people in the surroundings were struck by the pressure to the point they laid flat on the ground while shivering incessantly!

“Yang Ye, isn’t your physical strength very formidable? Come! Compete with this divine dragon!” Fourth gazed at Yang Ye with a savage expression while madness filled his eyes.

A dragon? Yang Ye was slightly stunned as he gazed at the colossus in the sky.

Would I fear a dragon?

It’s that dragon who should fear me, right?
