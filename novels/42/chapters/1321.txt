Chapter 1322 – I’m Going To Take His Head!

Regardless of whether it was his sword intent or cultivation that dropped, it would be a heavy blow to Yang Ye. Because it meant that his strength would drop tremendously. Yet now, it was very likely for both his cultivation and sword intent to drop.

Once that happened, it would definitely be a calamity for him!

However, even if he did it all over again, he would still choose to ignite his soul. After all, losing a portion of his cultivation and sword intent was better than death.

Yang Ye heaved out a long breath of air, and then he closed his eyes slowly and waited for his sword intent and cultivation to drop. At this moment, his sword intent was at the Rebirth Rank while his cultivation was at the Emperor Realm. But he knew that it wouldn’t be at that level soon.

Suddenly, Yang Ye frowned because the tiny vortex within him suddenly spun. A moment of silence ensued before Yang Ye hurriedly said, “Give me violet crystals.” Yang Ye’s voice was trembling because the tiny vortex had asked for spirit energy. In other words, it intended to help him? Just thinking about that caused hope to burn once more within Yang Ye.

Zi’er was stunned, and then she hurriedly withdrew violet crystals and fed them to Yang Ye. A few breaths of time later, Yang Ye shook his head and said, “This isn’t working. It’s too slow. Quickly get Snowy out here.”

As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, Zi’er hurriedly waved her right hand. In an instant, Snowy emerged from Yang Ye’s chest. At this moment, she was clearly sleeping, and both her eyes were closed.

Zi’er grabbed Snowy and patted her butt lightly. After that, Zi’er pointed at Yang Ye and said, “Give him spirit energy. Quickly, the more the better, and the faster the better!”

Snowy opened her eyes. When she saw the anxiousness in Zi’er’s eyes, she blinked and followed along Zi’er’s hand to gaze at Yang Ye. As soon as she saw Yang Ye’s horrifying state, she instantly shuddered before pouncing onto Yang Ye’s chest. She ceaselessly rubbed her head against Yang Ye’s chest and seemed as if she was asking — how did this happen to you?

Yang Ye didn’t know whether he should laugh or cry, and he could only gaze at Zi’er.

Zi’er hurriedly grabbed Snowy and said, “Stop crying for now. He needs spirit energy. Give him spirit energy. He needs a huge amount of it!”

Snowy raised her little claw and wiped away the tears of spirit energy on the corners of her eyes, and then she didn’t hesitate to fly over to Yang Ye. She wrapped her claws around Yang Ye’s face before pressing her mouth against Yang Ye’s mouth. After that, Yang Ye and Zi’er watched with astonishment as strands of seemingly solid profound energy surged out madly from her mouth and into Yang Ye’s mouth.

Yang Ye’s eyes instantly opened wide because his stomach was expanding at a visible speed. He hurriedly gazed at Zi’er to plead for help, and then Zi’er quickly grabbed Snowy.

Snowy blinked while bewilderment filled her eyes.

Cough!

Yang Ye coughed, and then a strand of spirit energy instantly emerged from his mouth. He gazed at Snowy and laughed bitterly, “It’s too much. Take it slow. Don’t give me so much right away.”

Earlier, the spirit energy that entered him had almost filled him up to the point of exploding.

Snowy revealed a brilliant smile. She flew over to Yang Ye, kissed Yang Ye again, and then spirit energy surged slowly into Yang Ye.

The tiny vortex immediately started spinning when the spirit energy entered him, and then all the spirit energy was completely absorbed by it. It didn’t take long for threads of violet energy to emerge from the tiny vortex. Once the violet energy flowed out, it was swiftly absorbed by Yang Ye’s body. As more and more violet energy was absorbed into his body, Yang Ye noticed that his body was undergoing some sort of change.

However, his cultivation had still dropped to the Quasi Emperor Realm.

But Yang Ye was pleasantly surprised to notice that it didn’t stop further. He’d expected that it was very likely for his cultivation to decline to the Saint Realm. Because when he’d done so in the past and suffered the backlash from it, it would cause him to lose a realm of cultivation or even more. Yet now, his cultivation had actually not declined!

It hadn’t dropped!

Yang Ye was overjoyed! His life would truly be filled with darkness if it fell to the Saint Realm. After all, he had to return to the Radiant Dimension and look for Lady as well. If he became a Saint, how could he return to the Radiant Dimension or go see Lady? Actually, that was quite far away. Even if pressing matters were considered, he wouldn’t be able to resist the Nie Clan if his cultivation fell to the Saint Realm.

Fortunately, it hadn’t!

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s expression changed because his sword intent was starting to undergo a change.

Am I going to drop back down to the Void Rank? Yang Ye’s heart tensed up. The tiny vortex could help him stabilize his cultivation, but it couldn’t stabilize his sword intent!

The Sword God’s Seal!

Yang Ye suddenly thought of the Sword God’s Seal, and then he hurriedly activated it. In an instant, it appeared on his forehead. As soon as that happened, Yang Ye was pleasantly surprised because the sword intent around him started to stabilize. It didn’t take long for his sword intent to grow more and more stable, and it showed no signs of dropping. Around an hour later, Yang Ye truly heaved a sigh of relief.

His sword intent had stabilized!

Both his sword intent and cultivation had stabilized!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and gazed at Snowy. He grinned, grabbed her, and kissed her. This time, it was actually all thanks to Snowy. If Snowy hadn’t provided so much spirit energy to him, then even the tiny vortex wouldn’t have been able to help him. Because his cultivation had been stabilized by relying on countless strands of Primordial Violet Energy. If the spirit energy he provided the tiny vortex was insufficient, his cultivation would definitely drop. At that time, even the tiny vortex wouldn’t be able to turn the situation around.

Snowy wrapped her claws around Yang Ye and rubbed her head lightly against Yang Ye’s face. She was smiling as well when she saw that Yang Ye was fine.

Zi’er heaved a sigh of relief, walked over to Yang Ye’s side, and then held Yang Ye’s hand tightly. Earlier, she was absolutely worried.... Fortunately, Yang Ye was fine.

Yang Ye glanced at Zi’er, glanced at Snowy, and then smiled, “I’m fine now!” He knew that the state he was in just now had terrified them. Especially Zi’er, her face was still covered in tears. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

After playing with Zi’er and Snowy for a while, Yang Ye sat cross-legged and quickly recovered his profound energy with Snowy’s help. Moreover, he returned to his prime as well.

Yang Ye stood up and gazed at Zi’er. A faint palm print still lingered on her right cheek. It was Nie Hun who left it on her cheek. Yang Ye’s face instantly turned gloomy at the sight of it. He’d wanted to kill Nie Hun earlier, but Nie Hun was the strongest, so it was impossible to kill Nie Hun with a single attack. Moreover, once he was locked in combat with Nie Hun, it would definitely waste a huge amount of time. But at that time, time was what he lacked the most.

So, he hadn’t chosen to attack and kill Nie Hun first. As for when he’d ignited his soul, attained the Emperor Realm, and had the strength to kill Nie Hun; Nie Hun had fled so quickly that it was too late for Yang Ye to kill him.

Zi’er took Yang Ye’s hand and shook her head slightly, “I’m fine now.”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and touched her cheek gently. A short while past before a vicious glow flashed through his eyes, “Let’s go!” As he spoke, he took Zi’er’s hand and shot up into the sky.

“This... this isn’t the way back to Dark Hell Continent. Where are you going?”

“I’m going to take the head of that fellow who hit you!”

...

Heaven Pillar Peak.

Nie Hun sat at the seat of the host within a palace hall. The experts of the 3 sects and 6 cities were before him. Actually, it was only 3 sects and 3 cities. Because the Yuan Clan, Yun Clan, and Qin Clan had been annihilated.

The atmosphere here was quite heavy.

It wasn’t a secret that Yang Ye had killed around 10 Voiders of the Nie Clan. In other words, the Nie Clan had suffered heavy losses. Now, the human race had a powerful enemy like the demon race. In short, the human race’s future was worrying.

Actually, the 3 sects and 3 cities were quite displeased with the Nie Clan. Because if Nie Tian hadn’t joined forces with Senior Yuan’s group to kill the experts of Slayer Pavilion, Yang Ye would have definitely not flared up like that. It could be said that the Nie Clan bore the greatest responsibility for the situation becoming what it was. However, they would naturally not speak about it right now.

The Nie Clan had suffered heavy losses. If they acted against the Nie Clan now, then the human race would really have no hope. Moreover, once the demon army breached Heaven Pillar Peak, then not to mention their homes in the Veiled Region, even they would be unable to avoid death and destruction!

Now, it was a moment that required them to be united!

Suddenly, Nie Qing walked in, and her face was quite unsightly.

Nie Hun gazed at her and asked, “What is it?”

Nie Qing spoke solemnly, “The demon race has started to move.”

“I knew Yang Ye had sided with the demon race! It really is as we’d expected!” Nie Hun clenched his fists tightly as he glanced at the experts here, “Everyone, just look. The demon race just happened to attack at a time like this. Why? It’s because of Yang Ye! Yang Ye has betrayed the human race! It was definitely the demon race that made him attack my Nie Clan earlier!”

Lin Qian and the others fell silent, and their faces were quite unsightly. Has Yang Ye really sided with the demon race? If he really has, then it’s definitely a calamity for the human race.

After all, besides Yang Ye’s own strength, he had the Slayer Pavilion and Sword Alliance. Their joint forces couldn’t be underestimated. Especially Yang Ye and the Slayer Pavilion. Could anyone stop them if they concealed themselves and assassinated the people here?

Just thinking about it caused their hearts to grow even heavier.

Meanwhile, Nie Hun suddenly stood up and said, “Everyone, internal issues should be resolved first before external issues can be considered. So, I’ve decided to annihilate the Sword Alliance, Slayer Pavilion, and Yang Ye before putting our full strength to dealing with the demon race. Otherwise, if Yang Ye’s forces stab us in the back while we’re fighting the demon race.... Everyone, I’m sure all of you don’t want to be targeted by a group of assassins, right?”

“I object!” Lin Qian stepped forward and said, “Brother Nie Hun, the demon race’s army is about to attack. If we go attack Yang Ye now, we’ll definitely suffer a pincer attack. If that happens, the situation will be even more disadvantageous to us. So, we should summon all the experts of the Veiled Region to Heaven Pillar Peak and defend it to our deaths. We should protect the human race and not seek revenge from Yang Ye!”

“I agree!” Meanwhile, Old Man Shui from the Sky Wave Sect stepped forward as well, “Our main priority is to defend Heaven Pillar Peak!”

Nie Hun glanced at them and spoke coldly, “That’s true, but have you thought about what we would do if Yang Ye leads his group of assassins to suddenly launch a surprise attack on us while we’re in battle with the demon race? Don’t tell me he wouldn’t. No one can guarantee that!”

Lin Qian and Old Man Shui fell silent.

Meanwhile, Nie Hun added, “Why don’t we do this? We’ll send some forces to capture those fellows in the Sword Alliance, and then use them to threaten Yang Ye so that....”

Nie Hun had just spoken up to this point when something unexpected occurred. A ray of light suddenly appeared here.

The expressions of everyone here changed drastically, and the hairs on Nie Hun’s body even stood on end!
