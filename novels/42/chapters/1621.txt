Chapter 1622 - Rebirth Fruit!

Translator: InVader

Are Zenith Realm experts very strong?

Yang Ye had asked this question earlier. This time, he wasn’t just asking the question. He was asking Lu Lige with facts.

Are Zenith Realm experts very strong?

They were very strong to Yang Ye, of course. He’d never underestimated Zenith Realm experts. The reason he asked is because he wanted to say that while they were strong, Zenith Realm experts weren’t really terrifying. At the very least, they weren’t very terrifying when he used the sword.

Let’s roll back time to 15 minutes before this.

After he destroyed the flaming palm from the Zenith Realm expert, Yang Ye had immediately fled. He raised his physical speed to its limits, so it only took a few breaths of time for him to get far away.

However, that Zenith Realm expert followed closely behind him. Just like that, Yang Ye fled while the Zenith Realm expert chased after him.

Around 10 minutes later, Yang Ye suddenly stopped. As soon as he did, the Zenith Realm expert was 300m behind him.

That Zenith Realm expert laughed coldly, “What? You’re not fleeing anymore? You…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot. The Zenith Realm expert’s pupils had constricted at the exact same moment. He clenched his fists with the intention to attack. However, a terrifying wave of intent pressed down upon him.

Slaughter sword intent!

The Zenith Realm expert was caught off guard, causing his body to stop moving momentarily, and it was this instant which allowed a sword to stab through the back of his neck. His eyes instantly opened wide, and his hairs stood on end. However, he didn’t give up on trying to survive. At the critical moment, he moved his head to the right and sliced his own neck on Yang Ye’s sword.

Hiss!

Yang Ye's sword sliced through half of his neck, but that Zenith Realm expert seized this opportunity to flash over 3km to the side. However, only after moving there did he notice that Yang Ye was still behind him, and that sword was still in his neck!

I’m finished! That was the last thought he had.

Hiss!

A head flew up into the air while accompanied by a fountain of blood.

Dead!

Yang Ye glanced at the headless corpse, sheathed his sword, and then closed his eyes slowly.

Even though he’d killed another Zenith Realm expert, it wasn’t easy at all. That had been his strongest attack, the Sword of Rebirth. Besides that, he’d used the Laws of Darkness, two types of Returnal Rank sword intent, and the Sword Domain!

Even then, he’d almost failed to kill the Zenith Realm expert!

It was all thanks to the Laws of Darkness that he’d succeeded. Because if he hadn’t been attached to that Zenith Realm expert’s shadow, that fellow would have definitely escaped.

Yang Ye had gained a new discovery about the Laws of Darkness. He’d realized that so long as he attached himself to someone’s shadow, he would move along with them!

What did that represent?

It represented that if he attached himself to someone, that person could only dream of escaping him!

Moreover, his Laws of Darkness were much stronger than they had been. So long as he didn’t attack, then even Zenith Realm experts couldn’t detect him while he hid in their shadows. Of course, the precondition was that he didn’t attack. He couldn’t even reveal a trace of his aura!

Even though he’d killed another Zenith Realm expert, Yang Ye still didn’t underestimate Zenith Realm experts. Because he was very well aware that once they didn’t underestimate him and treated him as an equal, then the outcome of the battle would be uncertain.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, glanced at the surroundings, and waved his hand. The head of that Zenith Realm expert immediately flew over to him, and then he vanished on the spot.

…

15 minutes later.

Everyone was looking at Yang Ye. Lu Lige’s eyes had a trace of shock in them. As for the violet robed old man’s group, they had a trace of bewilderment and fear in their eyes. They’d thought Yang Ye was the weakest. Yet now, the brutal reality before them told them that the black robed man before them, who was holding the head of a Zenith Realm expert, may not be the weakest amongst these three geniuses!

Yang Ye casually tossed the head over and said, “Now, it’s three against three. Are you still going to fight us?”

The violet robed old man took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, and then he said, “The Yang Clan, Yang Yan. Good! My Wang Clan will remember this.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished into the distance with the other two Zenith Realm experts.

Meanwhile, Lu Lige suddenly went over to Yang Ye, “How did you accomplish that?”

Yang Ye asked, “What are you talking about?”

“Stop acting dumb!” Lu Lige pointed at the head and asked, “How did you kill him? Don’t tell me that your fist technique did it. While it was strong, it wasn’t sufficient to kill a Zenith Realm expert!”

Yang Ye replied, “It’s a secret. A trump card, understand?”

“Tch!” Lu Lige grunted coldly, “What’s so great about that? If I’m forced into a corner, I can even kill two Zenith Realm experts.”

Yang Ye shrugged, and then he gazed at Li Tianjiu, “What about you? Do you still intend to fight us? If you do, it’s two against one now!”

Li Tianjiu gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “The Yang Clan, Yang Yan. Good, very good! I, Li Tianjiu, will definitely give you double the payback one day.”

As he spoke, he was about to leave. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Double? Hmph! You think too highly of yourself. Allow me to tell you that my Young Master is an extraordinary genius. Not to mention you, can anyone in the younger generation of Milky Way System be a match for him?”

“Hey! Hey!” Meanwhile, Lu Lige suddenly said, “Brother, that’s too much. I have to admit that Yang Yan has some ability but saying he’s unmatched in the younger generation of the Milky Way System is going too far. Not to mention him, even the number one genius of your Yang Clan, Yang Lianshuang, wouldn’t dare to speak about being the number one genius in the younger generation of Milky Way System!”

“Yang Yan? Unmatched in the younger generation?” Li Tianjiu laughed with ridicule, “How laughable. Forget it, I won’t say anything else. Just go back and tell your young master that I, Li Tianjiu, will definitely get even with him and you for this!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the distance.

Yang Ye nodded, and then he turned around with the intent to leave.

Suddenly, Lu Lige obstructed Yang Ye’s path and asked, “The Earth Spirit is in your possession, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Indeed.”

Lu Lige was stunned, “Then why did you dare to swear on your own soul?!”

Yang Ye pointed at his chest, “Because I have a clear conscience!”

Lu Lige was stunned, “You have a clear conscience after all that? You… your conscience is amazing!”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and asked, “How do I get to the Yang Clan?”

“Aren’t you from the Yang Clan?”

“Can’t I get lost?”

Lu Lige felt speechless.

Lu Lige fell silent for a short while, and then he said, “You’re not from the Yang Clan, right?”

He was no fool. After Yang Ye asked him for directions to the Yang Clan, he realized that everything Yang Ye had done seemed like Yang Ye had been intentionally making them go seek out the Yang Clan. Or it should be said that Yang Ye wanted them to look for trouble with Yang Yan.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “How do I explain it? I'm considered to be from the Yang Clan, but I’m not as well.”

“I’m speechless!” Lu Lige spoke angrily, “If you are, then you are; if you aren’t, then you aren’t. What do you mean by that? You’re just giving me a headache!”

Yang Ye replied, “Based on my bloodline, I belong to the Yang Clan, but as far as I’m concerned, I’m not a member of the Yang Clan. Understand?”

Lu Lige glanced at him and nodded, “I understand now. I didn’t expect to meet someone just like me. It’s truly fate!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Someone like you? What do you mean?”

Lu Lige shrugged, “There are eight great clans here. My Lu Clan is one of them. I was once from the Lu Clan, but I’m not any longer.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

He replied, “When I was young, I got a strange disease, and it blocked up my meridians. So, I couldn’t cultivate. I’m sure you’re aware how clans don’t need weaklings. Thus, they removed my name from the Lu Clan and reduced me to a servant.”

Yang Ye sized up Lu Lige, “You gained some sort of fortuitous encounter in the end?”

Lu Lige shook his head, “No, I fucking cleared them by myself, bit by bit. Sigh, that pain… It was truly fucking painful. If I can do it all again, I would rather take my own life than do that.”

Yang Ye asked, “You’re so strong now. Didn’t the Lu Clan invite you back?”

Lu Lige shook his head, “How could they? If I’m a genius on Yang Lianshuang’s level, then perhaps they would make me return to the Lu Clan. Unfortunately, I’m not that monstrous. So, how could they allow someone who holds resentment towards the Lu Clan to return to the clan? Moreover, even if they allowed me to return, I wouldn’t! I have my pride!”

Yang Ye nodded, “One must never lose their pride and backbone.”

He sized up Lu Lige and continued, “I need someone to complete miscellaneous tasks for me. Why don’t you come with me? I guarantee that you’ll gain both wealth and status!”

“Fuck off!” Lu Lige spoke angrily, “You’re full of tricks. You may stab me in the back at any time. Moreover, that wouldn’t even be the worst part, the worst part would be that I may even end up helping you stab me in the back.”

Yang Ye didn’t know what to say.

Meanwhile, Lu Lige suddenly glanced at the surroundings and said, “I know a place that has a treasure. I’ve been coveting it for a long time. However, I wasn’t confident in my ability to get it on my own. Are you interested in joining me?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “No!” As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and left. He only wanted to head to the Yang Clan!

“Why aren’t you interested?” Lu Lige continued, “Do you know what treasure it is? Rebirth Fruits! Rebirth Fruits that can help us advance into the Rebirth Realm!”

Yang Ye immediately stopped when he heard Lu Lige, and then he turned around and gazed at him, “What are you standing there for? Lead the way!”

Lu Lige was stunned.
