Chapter 2245 – This Sword Domain is Trash!

“You don’t have much time?” Yang Ye obstructed her path, “Tian Xiu, what do you mean?”

Tian Xiu glanced at Yang Ye and said, “It’s nothing!”

Yang Ye wanted to say more, but she shook her head, “We don’t have much time. Come with me!”

Tian Xiu vanished into the distance.

Yang Ye frowned slightly. His intuition told him that something was about to happen, but Tian Xiu was unwilling to tell him about it!

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he shook his head and followed her.

Yang Ye followed her past the cemetery. At the end of it was a plain, and it was boundless.

Tian Xiu stopped after walking for a while, and then she tapped her right foot down.

Hiss!

The plain before them suddenly cracked open, and then a stone stairway appeared below them.

She didn’t say anything and just walked down.

Yang Ye followed her.

There was another world under the ground.

In the underground world was a huge square, and this boundless square was made of unknown limestone.

“The void spirit race’s Martial Grounds!” Meanwhile, Tian Xiu spoke softly, “This was where the experts of the void spirit race used to cultivate.”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Tian Xiu, you’re from the voice spirit race, right?”

Her figure trembled slightly, and she fell silent for a short while before she nodded.

“I knew it!” Yang Ye spoke softly. Actually, he’d guessed that a long time ago. But he didn’t dare to confirm it without asking him. Now, it seemed like she was the last surviving member of the void spirit race.

Tian Xiu walked a little bit further, and there was a cushion there. The meditation cushion was covered in dust.

Yang Ye didn’t interrupt her.

A short while passed before she spoke softly, “In the past, there were many here. Some cultivated martial arts while others meditated. Just like that, generation after generation passed, until everything changed one day.”

She closed her eyes slowly.

A short while later, she turned around, “Where’s Snowy?”

Swish!

A ray of white light flashed, and then Snowy appeared before her. A rare smile appeared on her face as she gazed at Snowy, and then she rubbed Snowy’s head, “It’s been a long time!”

Snowy naturally liked Tian Xiu, so she floated over to Tian Xiu’s shoulder and patted Tian Xiu’s head lightly.

Tian Xiu’s smile widened from that.

She glanced at the surroundings and said, “I need some spirit energy to activate the formations here.”

Snowy waved her claw, and countless strands of spirit energy converged here.

Tian Xiu tapped her finger forward, and the spirit energy entered the ground below. After, the entire ground trembled, and then a thin barrier of light appeared here.

Tian Xiu said, “Tell An Nanjing to come outside!”

Yang Ye nodded and asked An Nanjing to leave the Primordial Pagoda.

Tian Xiu glanced at them and said, “Both of you have a flaw, and it’s in your control of your own strength.”

She raised her right hand slowly and pressed it down at them.

In an instant, they felt like the world was pressing down upon them, and it was so powerful they felt suffocated.

She had the power to obliterate the world with just a raise of the hand!

Tian Xiu withdrew her hand and said, “See? My energy fell fully onto both of you, and it didn’t affect the surrounding space at all. Actually, space is like an invisible barrier. Our energy passes through it before arriving on someone else, and space endures a portion of it. If space shatters, it represents that space endured most of your energy.”

Yang Ye and An Nanjing exchanged glances, and Tian Xiu continued, “It’s a technique, a small technique. But it isn’t ordinary. The only way to use it well is to possess an extremely good grasp of space, and a very good grasp of your own strength. As they say, good steel is used on the blade. The steel is your energy, and if it isn’t used on the enemy, a lot of it would be wasted.”

Meanwhile, An Nanjing slammed a punch at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s expression changed, and he hurriedly did the same.

Bang!

Everywhere Yang Ye’s punch passed, space cracked open. But when his fist came into contact with An Nanjing’s fist, his expression changed drastically, and then he was blasted over 1km away!

Yang Ye gazed at An Nanjing with astonishment, “What?”

An Nanjing glanced at her fist and remained silent.

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu gazed at An Nanjing, “As expected of this generation’s Martial God. Your natural talent is rare indeed!”

An Nanjing glanced at Tian Xiu and said, “We actually grasped this in the past, but we didn’t take it seriously!”

Yang Ye nodded. Actually, he had grasped this technique in the past, but just as An Nanjing said, he hadn’t taken it seriously and studied it further.

Tian Xiu spoke softly, “If you don’t use this technique, perhaps only 90% of your energy hits your enemy, but that 10% is actually the key. It’s like stabbing your sword into your opponent’s arm, that may just take your opponent’s arm, but if you stab your opponent’s throat, it’ll be your opponent’s life that you take.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Just like what happened just now. An Nanjing’s strength wasn’t stronger than yours, but all 100% of her strength struck you, and only around 80% of yours struck her. So, you were pushed back. Just that is enough to push you into a hopeless situation. Simply speaking, it’s the little things. A true expert pays attention to the little things, but both of you overlooked it.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand now!”

Tian Xiu spoke softly, “Both of you have your own Daos and your own paths. I can only teach you some small techniques and experience. Of course, they are extremely useful to the both of you. At the very least, it’ll help you avoid taking many wrong turns.”

An Nanjing cupped her fist to Tian Xiu, “Please give us your guidance!”

Tian Xiu nodded, “Attack!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when An Nanjing turned around and punched him.

Yang Ye didn’t have the time to think. All he could do was swing his fist against hers.

Bang!

As soon as they collided, they were pushed 300m back.

An Nanjing was about to attack again when Tian Xiu suddenly said, “I asked you to attack me!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

An Nanjing had a rare blush on her face. But it didn’t take long for it to vanish, and then she gazed at Tian Xiu. A moment later, Elysium appeared in her grasp, and then she flashed over to Tian Xiu before slamming Elysium at her.

However, Elysium was stopped by Tian Xiu’s palm.

It couldn’t move even an inch forward!

An Nanjing frowned at the sight of this.

Tian Xiu flicked it.

Bang!

An Nanjing and Elysium were blasted over 3km away!

Yang Ye’s expression became extremely solemn from the sight of this. Tian Xiu’s strength was a little too terrifying!

An Nanjing’s eyes were filled with a solemn expression too!

Suddenly, Tian Xiu gazed at Yang Ye, and then she waved her hand.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically, and he swung his sword with both hands.

However, his sword hadn’t even been able to descend before it was blasted away by the terrifying force of the attack! Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Tian Xiu walked slowly in Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s direction, “I’m trying to tell you that there are too many geniuses in this world. I was one of them too. Natural talent is something you can never use as a source of confidence or pride. Both of you still have a long way ahead, so you should look further ahead. During this time, both of you must always stay humble. Don’t treat yourselves as geniuses. Just like the rich, the truly rich always say they are very poor, and those with power never say that they do have power.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “Both of you have your own pride and confidence deep in your bones, and that isn’t wrong. But you must think lesser of yourselves, the lesser you think of yourselves, the further you can go.”

In the outside world, many teachers would tell their students how extraordinary they were, and that they should be confident. Confidence wasn’t a bad thing. However, it was different for Yang Ye and An Nanjing.

They looked down upon everyone in the same realm of cultivation as them.

It could be considered as confidence if one wanted to describe it nicely, but if one were to be frank, it was conceit.

Conceit!

It was like a cup of water. If it was full, it couldn’t accommodate more water.

Tian Xiu was emptying out the glass.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing fell silent.

Conceit?

They asked themselves if they were conceited.

The answer was yes.

They had to admit that besides each other, they felt that no one in the younger generation of the large universe could be a match for them.

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu continued, “How far someone can go in the path of cultivation depends on that person’s heart. You must always stay true to your heart because if your heart goes off course, so will your path. It’s like how many people with bad intentions in the world of mortals take paths of evil.”

She walked over to Yang Ye and continued, “After so much theory, let’s try a little practical teaching. Come, use your Sword Domain!”

The Sword Domain!

Yang Ye didn’t give it any thought and released it.

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu waved her right hand.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s Sword Domain shattered and was obliterated while his countenance instantly turned ghastly pale.

At the same time, Tian Xiu shook her head, “This Sword Domain is trash!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
