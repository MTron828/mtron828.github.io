Chapter 1331 – The 10 Halls Are Invincible!

“When the 10 halls gather, they are invincible in this universe!” Mo Xiaoleng spoke solemnly.

“Invincible?” The corners of the Demon Empress’ eyes twitched while disbelief filled them.

Mo Xiaoleng nodded. She raised her hands and drew a circle, “There are a few thousand worlds in our universe. If the hall masters of all 10 halls awaken and converge, then no power or person in thousands of worlds would be able to go against them. This is no legend, it’s a fact. They have such strength!”

The Demon Empress asked, “Have they converged in the past?”

Mo Xiaoleng shook her head slightly, “They almost did.”

The Demon Empress asked, “Why?”

Mo Xiaoleng answered, “They threatened too many people and powers.”

The Demon Empress fell silent because she’d thought of a certain possibility.

Mo Xiaoleng said, “I never expected to encounter a hall master of the Nether Pavilion here, and she should be Blind Maiden who’s ranked at the 3rd position amongst them. So Blind Maiden... is actually so strong.”

The Demon Empress asked, “They are ranked based on their strength?”

Mo Xiaoleng shook her head slightly, “Not really. The top 3 are ranked based on strength, and the rest are ranked based on age.”

The Demon Empress spoke solemnly, “In other words, there are 2 even more formidable hall masters?”

Mo Xiaoleng nodded.

The Demon Empress’ heart shook, “She is already so terrifying, so those 2....”

Mo Xiaoleng said, “The hall master ranked at the 2nd position is comparatively mysterious, and I don’t know who she is. But there are legends about the first. Supposedly, she feeds on the Eye of the Heaven Dao. The Eye of the Heaven Dao in medium and large worlds are extremely terrifying. Especially the Eye of the Heaven Dao created by the Heaven Dao in the large world. It’s truly capable of obliterating the world. Not to mention the large world, even the Eye of the Heaven Dao in medium worlds aren’t something that we can resist.”

The Demon Empress fell silent for a long time before she said, “Since she’s from a large world, then what is she doing here?”

Mo Xiaoleng spoke coldly, “The Nether Pavilion suffered a catastrophe all those years ago in the large world, and it vanished overnight. Many say that they are dead, and many say they fled to another universe. I never expected to actually see one of their hall masters in this medium world that’s sealed off from the outside world. In other words, the other hall masters are in this universe because they don’t split up.”

The Demon Empress asked, “Can she leave this place?”

Mo Xiaoleng looked up at the sky and said, “If it was that intentionally created by that old man in Daoist Robes, then even she would find it difficult to break through those restrictions and leave this world. But the restrictions were clearly not left there on purpose, so it should be absolutely easy for her to leave.”

“She hasn’t left, so it means that she has something to do here?” The Demon Empress frowned, “What is she doing here?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Mo Xiaoleng shook her head, “I don’t know!”

A long while of silence later, the Demon Empress looked towards the distance and said, “Why does Yang Ye know her?”

Mo Xiaoleng looked off into the distance as well, “I want to know the answer to that as well!”

Both of them remained silent for a long time, and then Mo Xiaoleng said, “Let’s go.” As soon as she finished speaking, she immediately turned around and left.

The Demon Empress took a deep and long glance at the direction Yang Ye and Blind Maiden had left towards, and then she led the other 5 Voiders away.

...

After Blind Maiden left, she walked slowly along the seaside. Yang Ye was following behind her, and he kept around 3m between them.

She walked for a while before suddenly stopping, “Don’t follow me.”

But Yang Ye chuckled and walked over to Blind Maiden’s side, “Err, thank you for just now.”

This expression of gratitude wasn’t forced or fake in the slightest. If it wasn’t for Blind Maiden, he would have definitely been forced to risk his life against the Demon Empress, and the battle would definitely either end in his death or his miserable death!

Even if he raised his sword intent to the Quasi Returnal Rank, he was absolutely incapable of killing the Demon Empress and Mo Xiaoleng. Of course, it would be a completely different situation if the Sword Spirit or Qiong Qi woke up! But the Sword Spirit and Qiong Qi had shown no signs of movement until now, and that was the most depressing part. Because so long as one of them woke up, he wouldn’t have to fear the Demon Empress’s group anymore.

Even though Blind Maiden hadn’t opened her eyes when facing him, Yang Ye could sense that she was looking at him. After a moment of silence, Blind Maiden said, “Your natural talent and potential are quite good, and you’re one with great karmic luck, so you’ll definitely be extraordinary in the future. It isn’t advisable to stay here for long, so leave as soon as possible.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she continued forward.

Yang Ye was stunned. He hurriedly ran after her and asked, “Senior, is something about to happen here?”

She remained silent.

Yang Ye said, “Senior, I came here for the Stellar Sword Diagram. You should know where it is, so can you tell me?”

Lady had sent him here for it. So, how could he return empty handed? Moreover, the only person who knew where its whereabouts was Blind Maiden, so he’d hurriedly followed her.

She pondered deeply for a short while before she said, “Its true strength can be brought out if it’s in your hands. But don’t think about it, at least not for now.”

Yang Ye was very puzzled, “Why?!”

She didn’t speak and just continued forward.

Yang Ye glanced at her, hesitated for a moment, and then said, “Err, it’s very important to me. If... if you refuse to tell me, then I’ll bother you every single day.”

She stopped and looked at Yang Ye, “Are you trying to be an annoying rascal?”

Yang Ye was speechless.

Blind Maiden turned around and continued forward, “Even though you’re not a friend of mine, you are friends with Nether Maiden and the others. Since they became friends with you, I presume you’re not a bad person, and I’ve taken you to be a junior of mine because of that. But you can’t act like that with me. Otherwise, while I won’t kill you, I would still beat you.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Blind Maiden continued, “I do know where the Stellar Sword Diagram is, but it isn’t yours now. So telling you is meaningless.”

Yang Ye didn’t continue asking about it because it would be quite insensible to do so.

Meanwhile, Blind Maiden said, “But don’t worry, I’ll tell you where it is when the time comes. After all, its true strength can only be revealed in your hands.”

Yang Ye hurriedly replied, “Thank you!”

Blind Maiden continued forward. It didn’t take long for a small house to appear not too far away from them. The house was made of wood, and it wasn’t huge, but it was very well made. There was a garden and fruit trees around it as well. Seashells were even strung together and hung on the tree along with some wind chimes. When the ocean breeze blew in its direction, the sound of the wind chimes was clear and melodious.

Yang Ye asked, “This is where you live?”

Blind Maiden nodded and walked into the courtyard. Yang Ye followed her in. Even though she hadn’t invited him in, she didn’t stop him.

Blind Maiden walked over to a wooden bench and sat there. There was a round wooden table in front of her, and there were some fruits and pastries on it.

Yang Ye glanced at them, and he noticed that they were the most ordinary fruits and pastries.

Meanwhile, Blind Maiden suddenly asked, “Are all of them well in the Radiant Dimension?”

Yang Ye replied, “They are alright. They are very domineering, so none dare to bully them.” Indeed, Nether Maiden and the others were very domineering in Radiant Dimension. Not to mention the powers of the Radiant Dimension, even those guardians of the Radiant Dimension were extremely fearful of them.

Blind Maiden nodded slightly, “That’s good.”

Yang Ye asked, “Aren’t you going to look for them?”

Blind Maiden shook her head, “I haven’t resolved some business here. I’ll go once I’m done.”

Even though Yang Ye was very curious about it, he sensibly chose to not ask. He was just about to speak when Snowy suddenly emerged from Yang Ye’s chest. Snowy glanced at the surroundings. When she noticed that there was no danger, she immediately emerged from the pocket of space while holding a fruit, and then she raised the fruit towards Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at the fruit. It was the same fruit that Mo Xiaoleng had given Snowy earlier. However, only half of it was left, and it was covered in bite marks.

Yang Ye smiled, rubbed Snowy’s head gently, and said, “You eat it!”

Snowy shook her head and pushed the fruit forward in Yang Ye’s direction.

Yang Ye’s heart felt warm. He didn’t refuse and took a small bite from the fruit, and then he passed it back to Snowy, “I’m full. You eat.”

Snowy blinked and seemed to be asking — you’re full already?

Yang Ye patted his stomach and said, “I’m really full.”

Snowy raised the fruit to Yang Ye’s mouth, and then she started waving her claw slightly.

Yang Ye understood that Snowy wanted him to take another bite. So, he grinned and took one. Snowy’s eyes narrowed when she saw Yang Ye take the bite, and then she revealed a brilliant smile. After that, she started biting on the fruit, and it only took a while for her to finish it.

Yang Ye was rendered speechless by the scene before him.

Suddenly, Blind Maiden said, “That’s a Sprite Lord!”

Yang Ye turned to look at Blind Maiden, and he said, “That young woman who plays with flames said that same. What’s a Sprite Lord?”

Blind Maiden remained silent for a long time, and then she said, “Treat her well.” As soon as she finished speaking, she stood up and walked into the wooden house.

Yang Ye was stunned. Meanwhile, Blind Maiden’s voice came from within the house, “Go home.”

Yang Ye remained silent for a while, and then he said, “Can I take my forces to Sword God Island?” The island was huge, and it had some completely intact buildings and many sword formations. Even though most of them were damaged and incomplete, they could be repaired. In any case, the Sword Alliance had the number one sword formation master on the continent, Jian Ji. Moreover, there was another benefit from heading to Sword God Island, and it was that the Sword Alliance would have a buffer zone if it went to war with the demon race. That buffer zone would be Sword God Ocean.

Blind Maiden’s voice resounded, “No!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

A long moment of silence ensued before her voice arose once more, “There’s something dangerous in the ocean.”

Something dangerous! Yang Ye’s expression instantly changed, She actually said that there’s something dangerous there....
