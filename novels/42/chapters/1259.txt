Chapter 1260 – Let’s Kill Him Together!

A centipede!

An extremely huge centipede stood before Yang Ye and the black ape! How huge was it? Just a single one of its legs was more than 2 times the size of Yang Ye’s entire body, and it had almost 10,000 legs. According to Yang Ye’s estimations, everyone throughout the island would probably be able to see it if it stood up straight.

The black ape was huge, but it was like a child before the centipede!

The centipede was covered in numerous thick and massive ink black scales. Its body ceaselessly emanated an evil and cold aura, and it was extremely uncomfortable. At the very least, Yang Ye was very uncomfortable right now. The aura seemed like it could corrode his body and mind, so it caused him to feel quite bad.

It wouldn’t be so bad if he had his sword intent to resist it for him, but the problem was that he couldn’t utilize his sword intent right now!

Besides that, once the middle aged man returned to his true form, the aura emanated by him in his true form was a few times stronger than before!

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to flee!

Because it was absolutely not something he could resist right now!

Yang Ye had just arrived on the Void Cloud Shuttle when it started moving. Meanwhile, the black ape appeared on it as well. Of course, he’d transformed back to a normal size.

“You....” Yang Ye gazed at him and said, “Shouldn’t you be guarding the rear?”

The black ape glanced at him and said, “Just leave quickly!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

There was no need for Yang Ye to give the order as Yun Banqing had already started making the Void Cloud Shuttle flee.

Yang Ye gazed at Yun Banqing and said, “Head in the Sword God’s Palace’s direction!”

Yun Banqing didn’t ask why and immediately directed the shuttle towards Sword God’s Palace.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye and the black ape looked towards the distance. The centipede was looking at them as well. Both sides stared at each other for a few breaths of time before the centipede instantly transformed into a ray of black light that shot after Yang Ye’s group.

The centipede was massive. It simply seemed like a flying mountain. But the problem was that this ‘flying mountain’ wasn’t slow at all.

Pressure!

While the centipede hadn’t released an aura intentionally, it made others feel heavily pressured by its presence. At the very least, Yang Ye felt slightly suffocated and was almost unable to catch his breath.

Yang Ye asked, “What type of demon beast is that?”

The black ape remained silent for a while before he spoke, “It should be the ancient ferocious beast of legend, the Ten Thousand Legged Centipede. Such demon beasts are born with 1,000 legs and possess extraordinary natural talent. Especially when they reach adulthood, they can grow to obtain 10,000 legs. Even divine beasts like the dragons dare not rashly offend them. See those legs of his? Once you’re trapped by them, then even a Voider Realm dragon might be torn into pieces. Besides that, there’s also its venom. If it touches you, then you’ll either escape with heavy injuries or perish on the spot!”

Yang Ye shrugged, “What do we do now?”

The black ape shook his head, “I don’t know!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Should we... give it back to him? And then make peace?”

The black ape glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Do you think he would make peace with us?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Does he recognize the Sword God’s Seal?”

The black ape replied, “He recognizes nothing! He isn’t even a demon beast from Sword God Island, so why would he?”

Yang Ye looked up at the centipede. As he gazed at the massive pitch black centipede in the distance, Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Why don’t we make peace with him. Let me give it a try!”

Yang Ye walked to the stern of the shuttle, and he was about to speak when the centipede suddenly said, “Human! Damnable human! I’ll eat you alive!”

Besides viciousness, there was also rage in the centipede’s eyes. He’d never imagined that a day would come where he was humiliated by a human. What happened earlier was a humiliation to him, an extraordinary humiliation! Because he’d actually been struck by a human ant! Now, he didn’t care about the pure energy, and the only thing in his mind was how to eat Yang Ye alive!

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched when he heard this. He shook his head and gazed at the black ape, “Let’s talk about how to kill him instead!”

The black ape glanced at Yang Ye and said, “You intend to draw him to Sword God’s Palace?”

Yang Ye nodded. Flee? Where would they flee to? Even if they could flee out of Sword God Island, where would they go after that? Flee back to Doomsday City and make the entire city deal with that fellow? Even if the assistance from the experts of Doomsday City allowed them to kill that centipede, Doomsday City would probably be destroyed. As for the Sword Alliance, it would probably lose at least half of its members.

After all, the centipede was so huge. He didn’t even have to do anything and just press his body down upon Doomsday City, and the entire city would be squashed by him!

Yang Ye had no choice but to fight!

If they had to fight, then he had to draw the centipede to Sword God’s Palace. Because only there could Yang Ye use the sword, and only when he used the sword did his side have a chance to win.

It didn’t take long for the Void Cloud Shuttle to arrive at the ruins of Sword God’s Palace. After they arrived at the depths of the ruins, Yang Ye ordered Yun Banqing to stop, and then he placed 20,000 violet crystals into those pillars. After that, he gazed at her and said, “Shoot him at the critical moment!” He wanted to shoot the centipede incessantly as well, but he couldn’t afford the consumption of violet crystals!

Yun Banqing nodded, “Be careful!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, and then he gazed at the black ape, “Brother Black! Let’s kill him together!”

The black ape glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Let’s kill him!”

“How laughable! Human!” Meanwhile, the centipede laughed coldly. He was about to speak when a pillar of blood suddenly shot up from Yang Ye. A moment later, a ray of blood red sword energy tore through the air and struck the centipede.

Hiss!

It instantly slashed open a bloody injury on the centipede. But even though it had penetrated the centipede’s defenses, it hadn’t gone deep.

“A sword cultivator!” A trace of surprise flashed through the centipede’s vicious eyes, “Human! You’re a sword cultivator, yet you actually dared to come here....”

Yang Ye didn’t give the centipede a reply. His gaze descended onto the injury on the centipede’s body, and then he hesitated for an instant before the Sword God’s Seal appeared on his forehead. He naturally wasn’t planning to improve his sword intent to the Quasi Returnal Rank. After all, the pain from the backlash was something he didn’t want to ever experience again.

Besides being able to improve his sword intent to the Quasi Returnal Rank, it could improve the strength of his sword intent and sword energy by 3 times at least. However, Yang Ye noticed that the speed his profound energy was consumed became quite fast once he utilized the Sword God’s Seal. So, Yang Ye didn’t dare waste time and immediately looked at the black ape, “Let go kill him!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of blood red light that shot towards the centipede.

The black ape didn’t waste his breath, and he immediately charged forward as well.

After Yang Ye and the black ape left the shuttle, Yun Banqing immediately made it move almost 10km back. The battle between Yang Ye and the black ape, and the centipede would affect a huge area, and she didn’t want the shuttle to be affected as well. Once it finished moving back, Yun Banqing immediately locked the turrets onto the centipede and gave her full attention to the task at hand.

After he activated the Sword God’s Seal, Yang Ye’s sword energy and sword intent were at least 3 times stronger. Every single ray of sword energy could slice through the centipede’s defenses with ease. Because the centipede was so massive, he was like a living target for Yang Ye to practice on, and every single swing of his sword would practically never miss.

He wanted to focus on the lethal points on the centipede’s body, like his eyes and throat. But the problem was that the centipede didn’t allow it! The centipede was ceaselessly protecting those lethal points.

It didn’t take long for the centipede to be struck over 100 times by Yang Ye’s sword. Every single attack pierced his defenses, causing him to feel beyond exasperated. He suddenly howled with fury and stood up, and then countless legs enveloped down upon Yang Ye.

The black ape hurriedly howled as he slammed his fist at the centipede, “Watch out! Don’t let him catch you!”

However, it didn’t take long for countless legs to envelop down upon the black ape as well, causing his expression to change and become unable to pay any attention to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly when he saw the legs descend upon him from all directions. He didn’t want to let himself get trapped within them. After all, even the black ape was afraid of it, so he would probably be finished if he got trapped within them.

Yang Ye pondered deeply for an instant, and then he issued a command in his heart. In an instant, 10,000 rays of light shot out from within him, and then a circular sword formation appeared in the air. The swords flashed incessantly around Yang Ye under his control. Because they were enhanced by Void Rank slaughter intent, Rebirth Rank sword intent, and the Sword God’s Seal, those swords were extremely sharp right now. However, Yang Ye’s face had turned gloomy because the swords couldn’t sever those legs and could merely stop them!

How strong! Yang Ye had an extremely solemn expression on his face. Even though the centipede was still a Voider, he was much stronger than the black ape or that Voider from the Yuan Clan.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment before mentally controlling the swords to resist the centipede while he moved back. Meanwhile, the ancient sheath appeared in his grasp. Heaven’s Gravestone was sheathed within it before being swiftly drawn once more!

Om!

A beam of blood red sword energy that carried 200 Heavenrends flashed forward!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Everywhere it passed, all the legs in its path were sliced open with ease. In an instant, it had severed over 100 of the centipede’s legs!

“Human!” The centipede suddenly revealed a savage expression. He immediately controlled a few thousand of his legs to shoot madly at Yang Ye. At this moment, he’d completely abandoned any intent to stop Yang Ye’s swords, and he just allowed them to strike his legs.

Yang Ye’s expression changed when he saw a few thousand legs descending towards him, and he retreated swiftly. At the same time, the Phantom Shield appeared in front of him and obstructed those legs. His sword and ancient sheath weren’t just left by his side, and he was executing Heavenrend after Heavenrend in succession. In just a few moments, a few hundred legs had been chopped off from the centipede’s body.

Roar!

The centipede suddenly roared with fury. He actually abandoned the black ape, and all his legs shot towards Yang Ye instead. They were extremely quick and instantly surrounded Yang Ye before starting to crush down upon him.

The black ape’s countenance instantly turned pale at the sight of this.
