Chapter 2770 – Agreement in the Clouds!

Yang Ye shot up into the sky on his sword.

Countless people were watching that ray of light from within the city.

Presently, Yang Ye was the representative of the Three Dimensional Universe, and it wasn’t exaggerated at all to say that.

Moreover, he was the Three Dimensional Universe’s backbone!

In the hall down below.

“Everyone!” Suddenly, Ding Shaoyao’s voice dragged them back from their thoughts.

The others gazed at her.

Ding Shaoyao spoke softly, “I have a thought!”

Huang Ying said, “Please go ahead, Miss Ding.”

Ding Shaoyao spoke softly, “He can’t fight the entire Four Dimensional Universe on his own, and we cannot put all our hopes on him.”

Huang Ying nodded slightly, “Please go ahead if you have any ideas!”

Ding Shaoyao glanced at the others and said, “We have around 30 Destiny Realm experts here. This can be considered as all the peak experts of our Three Dimensional Universe. I think we should form a squad with 25 peak Destiny Realm experts, a squad that can provide assistance at any moment. What do you think?”

The others exchanged glances and started discussing softly.

A short while later, an old man stepped forward, “Miss Ding, your idea is good, but if that mysterious expert from the End World comes here while we’re gone, what do we do then?”

Ding Shaoyao nodded, “I’ve considered that possibility. According to my knowledge, the true objective of that mysterious expert from the End World is Yang Ye, or to be more precise, the Good Sprite and Evil Beast with Yang Ye. So, it’s very unlikely for him to target us. Moreover, he won’t act at a time like this. Because if he destroys this place, Yang Ye would definitely give up dealing with the Four Dimensional Universe and hunt him down instead. I believe that he won’t take that risk for now.”

The old man thought for a moment and said, “Indeed. Miss Ding, we’ll leave the arrangements to you!”

Ding Shaoyao glanced at them and none had any objections.

Ding Shaoyao nodded, “I’ve asked Senior Chen to set up a formation that leads to the outside world. If it’s necessary, I’ll summon all of you. Please work with me if necessary! Besides that, there’s one more thing. There are some bad rumors being spread throughout the universe. Some are saying doomsday is coming… These rumors have caused panic and unrest throughout the universe, and some are seizing the opportunity created by it to cause trouble. According to my investigation, it includes some people and subordinate powers of the people gathered here today.”

She stood up, “I hope you can make them stop. If it still continues a day from now, I will send the Guardians of the Universe.”

Meanwhile, a middle aged man spoke solemnly, “Miss Ding, it’s just a trivial matter. Isn’t sending the Guardians of the Universe a little too much?”

Ding Shaoyao glanced at the middle aged man, “City Governor Mo, according to my knowledge, your clan seems to reign supreme over others in your city!”

The middle aged man’s expression changed slightly, “Miss Ding, what are you trying to say? Allow me to be frank, there is a difference in strength throughout this world, and my Mo Clan is the strongest in Ink City. Is there a problem with that? Is it wrong to be strong?”

Ding Shaoyao smiled, “Of course not. However, according to my investigation, your clan used some methods to force and coerce the neighboring cities, and you took their spirit veins. During this time, you even killed two city governors and almost slaughtered a city. Is that correct?”

The middle aged man’s face instantly turned gloomy.

The strong were respected!

In this world, it was survival of the fittest. So, his actions weren’t wrong at all. Yet now, Yang Ye’s new order wasn’t like that.

Ding Shaoyao continued, “Do you have anything to say, City Governor Mo?”

The middle aged man spoke solemnly, “My city has a huge population, and it wants to expand and become better. I don’t think my city has done anything wrong.”

Ding Shaoyao nodded slightly and gazed at Huang Ying, “Patriarch Huang Ying, your desolate race is the number one race in the Three Dimensional Universe. What do you think?”

Huang Ying pondered deeply for a moment and gazed at the middle aged man. He smiled, “City Governor Mo, according to what you’ve just said, can my desolate race take over everything your city has?”

The middle aged man’s face instantly turned unsightly.

Meanwhile, Ding Shaoyao suddenly said, “Everyone, survival of the fittest and allowing the strong to do as they please is something of the past. The current order is unlike the past. If you think you’re very strong and that you can do as you please, then you’re absolutely mistaken. Because there’s someone stronger above you.”

She gazed at City Governor Mo, “The situation in the world has just been stabilized, and many rules and things have naturally not been done well. It’s understandable. So, City Governor Mo, there’s a thing known as acknowledging your mistakes and correcting them. What do you think?”

City Governor Mo hesitated for a moment and gazed at a nearby old man.

He was a Destiny Realm expert!

A short while later, the old man gazed at Ding Shaoyao, “Miss Ding, it’s just a trivial matter, so just let it pass, alright?”

Liu Yuan and the others remained silent, and there was a faint cold smile on her face.

This incident had nothing to do with the War Dimension.

“How presumptuous of you!” Suddenly, Huang Ying shouted furiously and glanced coldly at the old man.

The old man was a subordinate of the desolate race.

The old man’s face was gloomy, and no one knew what he was thinking.

Ding Shaoyao sat back down on her seat and took a sip of tea.

Huang Ying glanced coldly at the old man, “Elder Fan, just admit your mistakes?”

The old man fell silent for a moment and smiled, “Patriarch Huang, this isn’t about admitting mistakes. If I’m being honest, everyone here has risked their lives, so why can’t we enjoy some benefits? Why should we risk our lives while the others below just happily enjoy everything? Is that fair?”

“It’s unfair indeed!” Suddenly, a voice came from outside the hall.

Everyone was stunned upon hearing the voice!

It was a familiar voice!

Elder Fan’s countenance had instantly turned pale!

Everyone looked over and saw a man standing at the hall’s entrance.

Yang Ye!

He hadn’t left!

Everyone here instantly came to an understanding.

Yang Ye walked into the hall and gazed at Elder Fan. The latter didn’t dare to meet Yang Ye’s gaze.

Yang Ye said, “Why am I risking my life out there? Is it fair to me?”

Elder Fan lowered his head and remained silent. He didn’t dare to answer Yang Ye.

Yang Ye walked to the side and glanced at everyone here, “I may not be like all of you. I came from a small world, and that world is gone now. In the past, I always thought the strong are respected, and the strong can do anything they want… Of course, it’s a fact. But let me ask all of you something. We may be oppressed by the Four Dimensional Universe or attacked by Destiny at any moment, and they can easily annihilate all of us and the Three Dimensional Universe at any time. How do all of you feel about that?”Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

They remained silent.

Yang Ye grinned, “Isn’t it good to have rules and order? If you bully someone today, you may be bullied tomorrow! Of course, if you’re at a level of strength that can match Destiny, then just forget I ever said anything. But if you don’t have that level of strength, then can you abide by the rules and order I’ve set?”

He gazed at Elder Fan as he finished speaking.

The latter was sweating profusely!

After being in contact with Yang Ye throughout this time, they felt that Yang Ye was actually very easy to get along with!

However, no one would forget how terrifying he was when he acted ruthlessly!

Both the desolate race and Eternal Kingdom didn’t dare to infuriate him because they would have to face his ruthless and bloody side.

Yang Ye moved his gaze away and continued, “Elder Fan, you’ve fought by our side on many occasions, so I don’t want to kill you!”

Elder Fan shuddered, but he heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. He knew he was safe!

Yang Ye looked the old man in the eyes, “You’ll deal with the rest, right?”

Elder Fan hurriedly nodded, “I will, I definitely will!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “That’s good to hear!”

He glanced at the others and said, “We’ve all fought side by side, so I don’t want to be ruthless to one of my own, and I don’t want to make an example of any one of you. However, I don’t want anyone to act rashly.”

The others nodded. Actually, they were quite surprised by how he dealt with this!

Because Yang Ye hadn’t killed anyone. As far as they were concerned, Elder Fan was dead the moment Yang Ye stepped into the hall!

However, they hadn’t expected him not to kill anyone.

Of course, it made them feel quite warm inside because Yang Ye wasn’t that ruthless to his own.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “The war is about to begin, and I’m leaving this place. I don’t want anything bad to happen here, I really don’t!”

Huang Ying spoke solemnly, “It won’t. My negligence caused this.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Brother Huang Ying, you represent the biggest clan, and you have many subordinate powers. Your responsibility is huge!”

Huang Ying nodded, “I understand!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Then take care everyone.”

Yang Ye vanished from the hall.

This time, he’d really left!

In the hall, Ding Shaoyao, who’d remained silent until now, suddenly stood up and walked out of the hall. She looked up into the clouds and could faintly see a ray of light there.

As she gazed at it, she gradually started to stare blankly in that direction. A short while later, she spoke softly, “You better come back!”

…

Yang Ye shot through the starry sky on his sword.

Somewhere high up in the clouds. A woman in front of a Go board suddenly looked up in a certain direction, and she smiled, “Monarch Yan, do you see that? He has left! He plans to take the initiative against your Four Dimensional Universe. Haha…”

A voice resounded before her, “Want to make a bet?”

She smiled, “Yes!”

The voice said, “You don’t even know what the bet is!”

She grinned and remained silent.

A short while later, the voice said, “We’ll bet on whether he can survive past a month! The condition is that you don’t interfere!”

The woman nodded, “Alright!”

She gazed ahead and smiled, “I can’t interfere. Yes, I understand what you mean. I can’t interfere even if you act against him.”

The voice asked, “Is that a deal?”

She smiled, “It is.”
