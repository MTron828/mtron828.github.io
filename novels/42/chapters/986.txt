Chapter 987 – Oblivion Maiden!

Yang Ye asked, “Did she not say anything?”

Shang Qingying shook her head slightly, “She didn’t. She merely said that she had been looking for you for a very long time. She didn’t seem to be lying.”

When she spoke up to this point, Shang Qingying hesitated for a moment and said, “Yang Ye, she seems weak and delicate, and she seems quite pitiable. If you did something to her, then you should be responsible, otherwise I would think badly about you!”

Shang Qingying left once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye was speechless.

“You’re quite charming, aren’t you!?” Lu Wan’er suddenly glanced at Yang Ye.

Yu Wushuang suddenly said, “Of course. Why else would she be looking for him for so long?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Stop being so sarcastic. Let me go and find out what it’s about.”

He started walking towards the door once he finished speaking.

However, Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly once he stepped through the door. Because his field of vision warped, and the scene before his eyes changed. It didn’t take long for him to appear in a gray and hazy world, and Shang Yunxi stood in front of him. There were 4 other old men standing by Shang Yunxi’s side. At this moment, Yang Ye noticed that one of the white robed old men who was with Instructor Zhuo before this had vanished!

Besides that, all of their auras were very unstable while their countenances were extremely pale.

Shang Yunxi said, “Thank you!”

Yang Ye was puzzled.

Shang Yunxi said, “Thank you for staying in the city. Needless to say, we would have lost the city a long time ago if it wasn’t for you. Kid, we aren’t ungrateful people. We’ll remember this debt.”

Yang Ye said, “Senior, if you really think like that, then you can give me 2 more Divine Rank techniques!”

Shang Yunxi laughed as he scolded, “Kid, do you think they are easily obtained? Do you know that even our academy has only 5 Divine Rank techniques? It isn’t that we refuse to give it to you, but those techniques require you to be female or possess special physiques to cultivate. So, it’s pointless to give them to you.”

Yang Ye spoke seriously, “It’s fine if you don’t have any techniques. Then how about some Violet Crystals, Divine Rank treasures, or other precious treasures. I won’t refuse them!”

The corners of their mouths twitched, and they felt like beating Yang Ye up.

Shang Yunxi replied, “Let’s not talk about that for now. I brought you here because I want you to do something for me!”

Yang Ye asked, “Is there anything in it for me?”

Shang Yunxi’s expression turned slightly unsightly. Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “I was joking. No matter what, we’re on the same boat now. I’ll gain no benefit from allowing Ocean of Clouds Academy to fall. Not only would I gain nothing, it would be disadvantageous to me. So, if Senior needs me to do something, I won’t refuse if it’s within my ability.”

Yang Ye naturally understood that he wouldn’t be able to escape unharmed if the academy fell. If it fell, then the Dao Order and Ancient Sword School would definitely be unable to stop Sky Divine Hall and the demon race. At that time, not to mention saving An Nanjing, even surviving would be a problem.

Shang Yunxi and the others’ gazes towards Yang Ye became much warmer when they heard this, and they felt quite grateful in their hearts.

Shang Yunxi said, “Kid, I promise that my academy will definitely help you with anything you need.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Senior, just tell me what you need me to do. Everything else is pointless if this danger we’re facing isn’t resolved.”

Shang Yunxi nodded and spoke solemnly, “I’m sure you’ve discerned the current situation. Our side is far weaker than the Welkin Wolf Clan, Python Clan, and Steel Ape Clan. Moreover, they have Sky Divine Hall on their side. We can be said to have truly arrived at the moment of the decisive battle. If the experts of Sky Divine Hall come at that time, then we would definitely be crushed before their forces!”

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, you have a plan, right?”

Shang Yunxi nodded, “We must get help!”

Yang Ye asked, “Who?”

Shang Yunxi answered, “The Bear Clan!”

“Demon beasts?” Yang Ye frowned, “Would they help us fight against other demon beasts?”

“Sky Divine Hall is helping demon beasts attack humans, so why wouldn’t demon beasts help us fight demon beasts?” asked Shang Yunxi.

“Right!” Yang Ye nodded, “But can Senior convince the king of the Bear Clan?”

“No!” Shang Yunxi shook his head, “I don’t know them well.”

Yang Ye’s face stiffened, “Then what are you trying to say?”

Shang Yunxi answered, “That’s why I brought you here. I hope that you can convince the Bear Clan and make them help us!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and said, “You’re saying that you don’t know the Saints of the Bear Clan, and you want me to convince them to help us against our enemies?”

Shang Yunxi nodded.

“Stop joking!” Yang Ye continued, “All of you don’t know the Bear Clan well, and I don’t know them at all.”

Shang Yunxi flipped his palm, and a black fang appeared in his grasp, “When I first arrived at Pine Prefecture all those years ago, I helped the last king of the Bear Clan by chance, and he gave this to me and said that he owes me a favor. So, you’ll be heading there to make them repay that favor!”

Yang Ye’s expression eased up slightly, “Is it a huge favor?”

Shang Yunxi had quite an unusual expression on his face, but it didn’t take long for him to return to normal, “It’s alright. In any case, it should... it shouldn’t be a problem to make them send 1 or 2 Saints to help us!”

Yang Ye glanced doubtfully at Shang Yunxi, “Senior, why aren’t you going yourself?”

“What if Welkin Wolf Demon King launches a surprise attack while I’m gone!?” Shang Yunxi continued, “All of us dare not leave the city, and besides you, no one else in the city is strong enough to complete this task. So, you have to do it!”

Yang Ye thought for a long time and said, “How long will it take for Sky Divine Hall’s forces to arrive?”

Shang Yunxi replied, “Three days at most! Because we destroyed the teleportation formations in Orbit City, and it will take 3 days at least to repair it! In other words, if you can’t get the Bear Clan to help us in 3 days, then you can bury our corpses!”

Yang Ye glanced at the fang in his grasp, “Will the Bear Clan really do it because of this fang?”

“I dare not guarantee it!” Shang Yunxi continued, “After all, it was a favor owed by the previous king of the Bear Clan. In short, it’s our last chance, so we have to give it a try. Right?”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a long time and nodded, “Then I will.”

Shang Yunxi and the others instantly heaved sighs of relief, and Shang Yunxi said, “Remember that you shouldn’t return if you can’t get help in 3 days from now. Because you would only be giving your life away. Understand?”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “I’ll try my best!”

Shang Yunxi said, “Then set out right now. I’ll send you there!” As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand and Yang Ye instantly vanished on the spot.

Once Yang Ye vanished, Instructor Zhuo who stood by the dean’s side suddenly said, “Is it really good to trick him like that?”

Shang Yunxi’s face froze, and then he shook his head and laughed bitterly, “It really is our last chance. Even if that fellow, Xiong Ba, still holds resentment towards me, it isn’t to the extent of acting against Yang Ye. At the most, he’ll be driven out!”

Instructor Zhuo spoke solemnly, “I think it won’t be that simple. It would be fine if anyone else went, but if it’s that fellow, Yang Ye, he might cause some trouble instead.”

Shang Yunxi sighed softly, “That’s exactly why I made him go. If I sent anyone else, then that person would be terrified at the sight of Xiong Ba, let alone getting us help. Only Yang Ye might have a chance. I just hope he’ll succeed!”

Instructor Zhuo sighed softly, “I hope so!”

“Let’s recuperate as quickly as possible. Perhaps it’ll be the last time we do that!”

...

Outside Ocean of Clouds City.

Yu Wushuang gazed at the woman who was holding a fox in her arms, and she sized the woman up for quite some time before she asked, “What’s your name?”

The woman hesitated for a moment before she spoke, “They call me Oblivion Maiden!”

“Oblivion Maiden?” Yu Wushuang was quite stunned, and there was a wisp of surprise in her eyes, “That’s quite a strange name.”

Oblivion Maiden spoke softly, “Is Yang Ye here?”

“What’s your connection to him?” Yu Wushuang continued, “Tell me and I’ll tell you where he is.”

Oblivion Maiden fell silent for a while, and then she said, “I’ve been looking for him for a long time, a really long time. But he’s too fast, so I haven’t been able to catch up to him. Tell me where he is, alright?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Yu Wushuang asked, “Is he really very important to you?”

Oblivion Maiden glanced at the fox in her arms and nodded.

“That amorous fellow!” Yu Wushuang muttered under her breath, and then she looked at Oblivion Maiden, “He was sent on a mission by the dean, and he’ll be back in 2 days. Why don’t you come into the city with me? I’ll give you a room, and I’ll immediately bring him to see you once he returns. Alright?”

Oblivion Maiden was quite hesitant, but Yu Wushuang continued, “Don’t worry, I know him very well. He’ll definitely take responsibility for what he has done. The reason he has been avoiding you is definitely because of some sort of misunderstanding between both of you. It’ll be fine once the misunderstanding is resolved.”

Oblivion Maiden hesitated for a moment and said, “Will he really come back?”

Yu Wushuang replied, “He definitely will!”

Oblivion Maiden thought for a moment and nodded, “Alright, I’ll wait here for him to come back.”

Yu Wushuang grinned, “Come, let’s head in the city. I’ll introduce you to someone. Perhaps you’ll call each other sisters in the future!”

Yu Wushuang turned around and walked into the city.

Oblivion Maiden glanced at Yu Wushuang, and then she lightly rubbed the fox’s head and said, “A’Li, we’ll be able to return very soon.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she followed Yu Wushuang into the city.
