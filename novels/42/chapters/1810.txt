Chapter 1811 – Evolution!

The reason Qiong Qi and Hou Qing reacted in this way was because they noticed that the spirit energy here had vanished.

Yes, all the spirit energy here had vanished!

At this moment, only air remained here, and there was any spirit energy!

In just an instant, the spirit energy in the entire 1st level had vanished.

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi suddenly said, “It’s that little fellow’s doing!”

Hou Qing naturally understood who Qiong Qi was talking about. It was that mischievous little fellow.

At the 3rd level of the Primordial Pagoda.

At this moment, Snowy’s body was trembling slightly, and she was still inhaling. Every single inhalation she completed would cause a strand of white mist to enter her mouth.

Besides that, Snowy was much different than before. Her body wasn’t just a size larger, even her entire body was covered in faint strands of moving light.

Yang Ye had awakened because of the commotion she caused.

Yang Ye’s eyes were filled with curiosity as he gazed at her. He knew that Snowy was definitely undergoing some sort of change or advancement,

Just like that, around two hours passed before Snowy slowly opened her eyes.

She cracked a smile when she saw Yang Ye, and then she buried her head in his chest.

Yang Ye grinned and rubbed her head gently, “Little Fellow, did you advance?”

Snowy looked up at Yang Ye, blinked, and seemed to not really understand what he meant.

Meanwhile, a voice suddenly resounded, “She didn’t advance, she evolved!”

Yang Ye turned to look towards the source of the voice, and a woman appeared not too far behind him. It was Little Sky.

Little Sky walked over to Yang Ye’s side, rubbed Snowy’s head, and said, “She evolved. She’s very terrifying now!”

“Very terrifying?” Yang Ye said, “What do you mean?”

Little Sky chuckled, “She can suck away an entire small world’s spirit energy by just inhaling once.”

Yang Ye was stunned, “The spirit energy in an entire small world? Really?”

Little Sky nodded, “Of course. Haven’t you noticed? The spirit energy in the 1st level has been completely sucked away.”

Yang Ye closed his eyes and sensed the surroundings. It didn’t take long for him to open his eyes and look at Snowy, and his eyes were filled with shock.

Because he’d noticed that the spirit energy in the 1st level had been completely sucked away.

Meanwhile, Little Sky added, “This little fellow is innately capable of countering all spirit beings. In the future, if you become enemies with a sect or clan, you don’t even have to do anything. You can just tell this little fellow to suck away all their spirit veins. Of course, the precondition is that those spirit veins aren’t protected by experts or formations.”

She rubbed Snowy’s head and smiled, “Spit out the spirit energy. Otherwise, all the living beings in Little Sky Continent will die.”

Snowy cracked a smile and opened her little mouth. In an instant, an extremely dense white mist surged out from her mouth, and then the entire cultivation room was filled with spirit energy again.

It didn’t take long for Little Sky Continent to return to normal.

In the cultivation room, Yang Ye gazed at Snowy while excitement filled his eyes. She’s an absolute treasure!

Actually, Snowy had helped tremendously throughout his journey. Because if she hadn’t provided him an endless supply of spirit energy, then he wouldn’t have been able to grow this quickly.

After all, every single advancement required a tremendous amount of spirit energy. But because he had Snowy by his side, he didn’t have to worry about spirit energy at all. That was also why he’d been able to advance so quickly!

Unfortunately, he hadn’t been able to attain the 2nd stage of the True Realm this time!

It was mainly because of Snowy. The commotion she created had interrupted him.

Meanwhile, Little Sky suddenly said, “I may not need to return to Merak System in order to restore my body.”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Why?”

Little Sky smiled, “Because of your violet energy. I noticed that it’s truly amazing. Absorbing it every day isn’t just repairing my body, it’s even helping me grow.”

Yang Ye asked, “Can you evolve too?”

“Of course!” Little Sky rolled her eyes, “Can’t you do the same?”

Yang Ye laughed with embarrassment. Meanwhile, Little Sky added, “But I still want to return to Merak System.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Yang Ye walked over to her side and spoke softly, “I promise that I’ll take you back, one day. Moreover, I’ll stay there as well. However, I’m sure you’re aware that if I return now, it’ll be a calamity for Merak System!”

Countless people wanted to look for trouble with him. If he returned to Merak System and those fellows went there, then it was obvious that Merak System may vanish from the world. Not to mention Merak System, he didn’t even dare to return to the Yang Clan.

Little Sky nodded, “I understand.”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Trust me. It won’t take long.”

Little Sky rolled her eyes at Yang Ye, “That may not necessarily be the case. You move too quickly ahead, so who knows how much you’ll grow by then? After all, the stronger a person gets, the more problems he’ll encounter. So, you may be in a huge amount of trouble for a very long period of time into the future.”

Yang Ye smiled, “But the day will come when I return to Merak System!”

Little Sky nodded slightly, “I’ll wait for you!”

After talking to her for a while, Little Sky took Snowy with her and left. Even though Snowy wanted to play with Yang Ye, she obediently left with Little Sky. Snowy was afraid of two people, Yang Ye and Little Sky.

Or to be more precise, only Yang Ye and Little Sky could make her listen obediently. Especially Little Sky. Both of them were born from the same world, and Little Sky had been born earlier. So, there was a very strange relationship between them, and they were like sisters.

After Little Sky and Snowy left, Yang Ye sat down cross-legged.

Cultivation!

Charging into a higher realm of cultivation was the process of compressing the profound energy within him, and then allowing the body to absorb even more. It wasn’t a single process. It had to be repeated multiple times until one arrived at the limits of one’s body. Only then was it possible to achieve a breakthrough!

So, it exhausted a huge amount of profound energy. However, Yang Ye didn’t lack profound energy at all!

Besides that, charging into a higher realm of cultivation was dangerous. Because the slightest mistake would result in the body absorbing too much spirit energy, and that may cause the body to explode. One had to control the amount well. So, even Yang Ye didn’t dare to act carelessly.

Yang Ye’s body was very difficult to penetrate from the outside, but it was quite easy to penetrate from the inside.

After all, the internal organs were very weak.

Time trickled by. Yang Ye ceaselessly absorbed spirit energy incessantly every single day, and then he compressed it. In the end, the profound energy would be used to stimulate the potential within one’s body.

Just like that, he repeated the cycle, over and over again.

Six months later.

Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes in the cultivation room.

Huff!

He spat out a mouthful of foul air, and then he stood up. As soon as he stood up, a powerful aura instantly swept out from him, and the space within the cultivation room rippled along with his aura.

But it only took a moment for the aura to surge back into him!

The 2nd stage of the True Realm!

After six months of bitter cultivation, he’d finally attained the 2nd stage of the True Realm!

His overall strength had improved tremendously. If he encountered the Undertaker again, he wouldn’t have to go through that much trouble to kill the Undertaker.

Now, he wanted to find someone to spar with!

A short while later, Yang Ye thought of Qiong Qi.

He didn’t hesitate to go to the 1st level to look for Qiong Qi.

Qiong Qi didn’t refuse Yang Ye’s suggestion.

Yang Ye stood before Qiong Qi with his sword in hand. As for Qiong Qi , his body was bent forward while his front legs were flat on the ground.

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot. At the same time, a brilliant ray of sword energy flashed!

A wisp of surprise flashed through Hou Qing’s eyes, “His speed isn’t bad at all!”

As soon as Yang Ye vanished, a wisp of ferocity flashed through Qiong Qi’s eyes, and then he raised his right claw and slammed it down.

Boom!

An explosion resounded. Qiong Qi was blasted over 300m away while Yang Ye was similarly blasted over 300m away.

Roar!

Qiong Qi suddenly roared with fury, and then he leaped up and descended upon Yang Ye like a huge mountain.

Everywhere he passed, space warped before him.

This pounce wasn’t just powerful, it was extremely fast. Yang Ye was practically unable to react before Qiong Qi arrived in front of him.

Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly. He stomped his right foot down, soared up around 1m into the air, and then slammed his sword down.

Hiss!

It instantly sliced space open the space around it.

Because it was enhanced by two types of Enlightened Realm intents. He didn’t dare hold back when facing Qiong Qi. Even though Qiong Qi hadn’t fought for a long time, Yang Ye didn’t dare underestimate Qiong Qi at all. Even if it wasn’t Qiong Qi’s main body.

After the sword energy tore apart the space around it, a wave of mysterious energy suddenly appeared here. A moment later, the sliced open space was instantly repaired.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s attack had slammed against Qiong Qi.

They collided in the most direct and barbaric manner!

Boom!

A loud explosion resounded, and then Qiong Qi and Yang Ye split apart.

At this moment, they were 1km away from each other!

Qiong Qi and Yang Ye exchanged glances, and then both of them and Hou Qing frowned at the same time.

Qiong Qi said, “Go out there and have a look!”

Yang Ye didn’t say anything and just left the Primordial Pagoda. After that, he looked up at Heaven Pillar Mountain, and then he saw something that made a solemn expression appear on his face.

Yang Ye gazed at it for a long time, and then he gulped while astonishment filled his eyes, “What the heck is that?”

Suddenly, Qiong Qi’s anxious voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Kid! Hide! Hurry up or you’ll be dead!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
