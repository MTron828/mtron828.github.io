Chapter 1961 – Hell Forest!

Recuperate!

Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground and started to use his Primordial Violet Energy to heal himself.

His recovery was absolutely terrifying with the help of the Primordial Violet Energy. In just a short while, his internal injuries had been fully recovered. As for the injuries on the outside, they were insignificant to him.

After that, Yang Ye started to go on night watch every day, and he fought those wyverns to the death.

He didn’t use his sword or Primordial Violet Energy!

So, he was always covered in injuries. However, its effects were very obvious. In the beginning, he was barely able to fight two on his own, and he could only forcefully hold on until dawn. Yet now, he could fight two wyverns.

This entire process was an extremely painful one for Yang Ye. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

However, all that mattered was the results!

Time trickled by.

Just like that, a month passed in Sky Residence City. He went for night watch every single night. Now, he wasn’t just fighting two wyverns on his own, he could suppress them!

Suppress them!

He could suppress two wyverns without using his sword!

The changes in his body were huge.

However, Yang Ye noticed that the strength of everyone in the city was growing.

Some used the wyverns to improve their strength, but some didn’t. For example, Mad Saber, Ling, and a few more leave the city when the sky turned dark, and they only returned after dawn. Moreover, all of them were injured when they returned!

Another two weeks passed!

At this moment, two wyverns weren’t a match for Yang Ye at all.

Besides that, he’d gained something unexpected, and it was that he’d advanced to the 2nd stage of the Enlightened Realm!

Yang Ye was very surprised by it!

A’Man suddenly appeared before Yang Ye and asked, “Is it very surprising?”

Yang Ye nodded.

“It happened naturally!” A’Man continued, “You weren’t just tempering your body as you fought them to the brink of death, you were tempering your mind and soul. Once they arrived at a certain level, it’s like pouring sufficient water into a cup, and the water will naturally overflow once too much goes in.”

I see! Yang Ye smiled. This advancement was quite surprising to him. However, it was a good thing, a very good thing!

Suddenly, A’Man said, “You don’t have to attend to take the night watch tonight!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

The corners of her lips curled up, “I’ll take you out to have some fun!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Once A’Man left, Qin Chuan went over to Yang Ye with envy on his face, “I really envy you!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Qin Chuan explained, “She’s taking you outside so soon. How can I not feel envy?”

“Outside?” Yang Ye asked, “To have fun?”

“Fun?” Qin Chuan chuckled, “You must be dreaming.” He glanced at the surroundings and continued, “I’m sure you noticed that some leave at night, right?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Qin Chuan asked, “Know where they go?”

Yang Ye glanced at Qin Chuan, “Can you stop beating around the bush?”

Qin Chuan chuckled and spoke seriously, “Hell Forest! Those fellows go to the border of Hell Forest. Besides cultivating, there’s another benefit from that, and it’s gathering beast crystals!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “Beast crystals?”

Qin Chuan nodded, “It’s an amazing treasure. Just one of them is comparable to 10 immortal crystals. However, it’s too dangerous. So, amongst the 60 plus people here, only a little over a dozen are qualified to go there.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “But you’re able to go there so soon… You’re amazing!”

Hell Forest!

Yang Ye looked up in the direction of Hell Mountain Range. He could only see its outline from here.

Night.

A’Man’s voice came from afar, “Yang Ye, Yu Jing, Gu Li, and Mo Ke, come with me!”

Yang Ye and the others looked over and saw that A’Man had leaped out of the city.

They hurriedly followed after her!

Outside the city.

A’Man glanced at them, “Just the four of you will be coming this time. It’s the first time that Yu Jing, Yang Ye, and Mo Ke are going to Hell Forest. So, I’ll give all of you a few tips. Firstly, don’t shrink back. The first to shrink back there usually is the first to die. Secondly, know when to stop, and never be greedy. Thirdly, retreat when you should. Don’t try to do it by force. As for when you should shrink back and when you shouldn’t, use your own discretion!”

Mo Ke suddenly asked, “Is it very dangerous?”

“Dangerous?” A’Man laughed coldly, “That place isn’t just dangerous, it’s extremely dangerous. Once we get there, even I won’t be able to take care of all of you. Your fate will be in your own hands!”

A’Man turned around and vanished into the night sky.

Yang Ye and the others exchanged glances and hurried after her.

Hell Forest!

How huge was Hell Forest? Even A’Man didn’t know the answer to that. The trees here were exceptionally tall, and every single one of them was over 100m tall. It could be said that people were tiny like ants once they entered this forest!

As soon as he entered the forest, Yang Ye felt a gloomy atmosphere filled it.

Even though it was nighttime, it didn’t affect their vision. However, they couldn’t see very far while amidst the trees.

Suddenly, A’Man said, “Split up!”

Yang Ye and the others immediately gazed at her. Yu Jing puckered his lips and said, “Big Sis, about that…”

A’Man gazed at him, “What? You’re afraid?”

Yu Jing hurriedly shook his head and spoke seriously, “How could I, Yu Jing, be afraid? I… I just think that it’s better to stay together and watch each other’s backs, right?”

A'Man glanced at them and said, “Remember that you came to the Dead Dimension to grow even stronger. If I help you deal with all danger, then what’s the point of coming here? Gather here at dawn. If you don’t come out of the forest by then, then we’ll meet in our next lifetime!”

A’Man vanished into the night once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye and the others exchanged glances. In the end, Yu Jing shrugged, “Good luck!”

He vanished into the distance.

Mo Ke nodded slightly to Yang Ye, and then he vanished into the night as well.

Only Yang Ye remained.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and it was deathly silent.

He stood there silently on the spot for a while, and then he started walking towards the distance. There wasn’t a single sound coming from the forest. Yang Ye clenched his fists tightly and was vigilant at all times.

Arriving here allowed him to understand many things. The first thing he understood was that he could absolutely not underestimate anything in this place. Because that would only lead to death!

Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye suddenly stopped. He glanced at the surroundings, and his eyes gradually narrowed.

Suddenly, a black shadow shot towards him!

It was extremely fast, much faster than the wyverns!

If it was before he started training with the wyverns, he would have been absolutely incapable of dodging this black shadow. Yet now, while it was extremely swift, it wasn’t enough to exceed his ability to react!

When it arrived before him, an ethereal white dragon claw slammed down against it.

Bang!

The powerful force of the collision blasted the black shadow away, and Yang Ye was pushed backwards repeatedly as well.

At this moment, Yang Ye saw it clearly.

The black shadow was quite strange. Its face was like the face of a human, but its body was like that of a snake, and it had four legs.

Yang Ye frowned, “What is that?”

Suddenly, the monster leaped up and pounced down at him. Yang Ye was about to attack when it suddenly opened its mouth. In an instant, countless streams of black energy surged out incessantly.

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly, and he hurriedly waved his hands.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Everywhere the black energy passed, even space was corroded.

The energy Yang Ye emanated wasn’t able to disperse the black energy. Conversely, it completely corroded all Yang Ye’s energy!

Yang Ye was shocked, and he moved 300m away.

Once he stopped there, he looked down at his hands. Both his hands were being corroded at a visible rate. Yang Ye hurriedly circulated his Primordial Violet Energy, and his hands gradually started to recover.

Meanwhile, a black shadow arrived before him.

It was the monster!

An instant later, a sharp and long black claw stabbed down towards his chest.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted 3km away. As soon as he stopped himself, the monster appeared before him again. Yang Ye was faster than it this time, and his palm slapped at it first!

At the same time, a pitch black shield of light suddenly appeared before it. As soon as Yang Ye’s palm struck the shield, his figure was blasted away.

Meanwhile, the black shadow appeared before him again, and then a sharp claw descended towards his head.

The claw flickered with a ghastly cold glow!

Yang Ye knew that if it struck him, then his head would definitely be clawed open.

While his body was extremely strong, it was absolutely incapable of resisting that claw.

Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly. He slowly clenched his fists and intended to use the Gold Form. However, the monster suddenly stopped, and then Yang Ye watched with bewilderment as it vanished into the night.

What’s going on? Yang Ye frowned. Suddenly, his expression changed, and he turned around…

Hiss!

Yang Ye’s chest was instantly torn open.
