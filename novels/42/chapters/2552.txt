Chapter 2553

A familiar voice!

Yang Ye gazed at the black robed figure with astonishment. The black robed figure was completely covered beneath the black robe, so he couldn’t sense or see anything about the person within!

Who was it?

Meanwhile, the black robed figure took a sword and played with it while asking again, “How much is this?”

Yang Ye cracked a smile, “Two Worldborn Fruits.”

The black robed figure shook their head, “I don’t have those!”

Yang Ye shrugged to display that he was helpless too.

The black robed figure suddenly picked up Eternal Light, “This sword is quite interesting.”

As he spoke, he put it away.

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

The black robed figure said, “In return, lend me this sword for now.”

As he spoke, he suddenly approached Yang Ye and spoke softly, “Run!”

Yang Ye blinked, and then he transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

The experts of the Soul Sect were about to give chase when the black robed figure suddenly waved their hand.

A wave of silver light rippled out.

The Soul Sect’s experts were visibly moved by the strength contained within the silver light. However, they didn’t give up on pursuing Yang Ye. One of them shot up into the air and chased after Yang Ye.

As for the other black robed man, he transformed into countless strands of black energy that rippled toward the silver light!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

As two waves of powerful energy slammed against each other, everything here started to be torn apart, but the two black robed figures at the center of the vortex remained completely unharmed.

Meanwhile, the black robed man from the Soul Sect made a grasping motion, causing the space before him to twist into a vortex. At this moment, the space here had started to condense in his direction.

He was like a black hole that was devouring everything here!

The powerful devouring force from it didn’t just devour the street, it was even trying to devour the entire city!

At this moment, the entire city was alarmed!

It only took a moment for a few powerful auras to arrive here.

A short while later, the Soul Sect’s expert and the other black robed figure were “asked” out of the city, or to be more precise, they were asked to leave the War Dimension!

Both of them didn’t put up any resistance!

They couldn’t!

…

Meanwhile, Yang Ye dashed madly all the way, and it didn’t take long for him to leave the battlefield outside the city.

He hadn’t gone off in search of Xing Biqing and Ye Zhibei. He naturally couldn’t drag them into this. Both of them had their own clans, and if he made them get mixed up in this, it would only put them in a difficult position!

As for the black robed figure from before, Yang Ye had actually guessed that person’s identity, but he wasn’t very certain!

No matter what, it was fine so long as that person was on his side!

Once he fled the city, Yang Ye noticed that he was still being pursued. But it didn’t take long for him to stop because it was only a single person.

One person!

Yang Ye stopped decisively!

Yang Ye gazed at the black robed man while standing among the clouds. He knew the Lord Realm was divided into 3 grades, and this black robed man was definitely not a grade 1 Lord Realm expert. It was very likely that this black robed man was a grade 2 or even grade 3 Lord Realm expert!

He was very strong!

That was Yang Ye’s evaluation of this expert before him!

Earlier, Yang Ye had used all his trump cards, yet he’d still failed to kill the black robed man. He’d truly given it his all! He’d even used his bloodline! However, the black robed man could still fight him with ease.

If it wasn’t for Executor, he wouldn’t even be able to fight this black robed man!

Regardless of whether he admitted it, they weren’t on the same level, and that was a fact!

The black robed man’s figure suddenly became ethereal, and then black energy covered the sky. Every single strand of black energy was a soul!

Souls!

The Soul Sect had a secret technique to raise souls!

It could be said that if Yang Ye didn’t happen to possess a Super Divine Treasure, he would be helpless against these souls! Because even divine treasures found them difficult to harm!

Once these souls appeared here, all of them locked onto Yang Ye, and then countless souls converged upon Yang Ye. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Powerful waves of aura and pressure swept toward Yang Ye, causing him to feel like his internal organs were about to explode!

Boom!

A powerful wave of sword intent suddenly swept out of him!

Lord Realm sword intent!

Once this sword intent appeared, the pressure that was squeezing down upon him was alleviated tremendously. An instant later, Yang Ye vanished on the spot with Executor in his grasp.

A ray of light that was fine as a hair flashed through the air!

Hiss!

Along with the flash of light, the sound of something being sliced open resounded, and then the sword energy arrived before the black robed man.

The powerful sword intent within it sliced apart all the souls before the black robed man!

The black robed man’s figure suddenly became still!

Meanwhile, the sword energy pierced through the black robed man’s figure!

As soon as Yang Ye’s figure stopped behind the black robed man, his expression changed drastically, and then a soul hand appeared behind him.

Yang Ye turned around and swung his sword!

Bang!

The hand exploded apart, but Yang Ye was blasted away too.

Meanwhile, two flying swords flashed!

They emanated dazzling light as they shot at the black robed man. However, they hadn’t even been able to get close to him before they were blasted away by countless souls!

Besides Executor, all of his other swords couldn’t get close to the black robed man.

They stood around 1 km away from each other.

Suddenly, the Soul Sect’s expert stretched out his right hand, and then a pitch black vortex appeared above Yang Ye. An instant later, a towering soul palm stretched out from within the vortex!

Along with the arrival of the huge hand, a powerful and oppressive aura appeared here!

All of it enveloped Yang Ye!

At this moment, Yang Ye couldn’t even breathe!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly while his body gradually turned ethereal. A moment later, Executor left its sheath!

“Destroy it!” Yang Ye shouted with fury as a sword shot up into the air!

The sword swept up into the air like a brilliant sun, and the powerful aura that enveloped Yang Ye was instantly obliterated. Meanwhile, the sword didn’t stop and continued all the way up before stabbing the soul hand above him!

At the same time, the hand grabbed Yang Ye’s sword!

Boom!

The entire sky shook violently while the huge hand trembled as well. Cracks gradually appeared on it, and they grew in number. A few breaths of time later, the hand exploded apart!

Bang! Bang!

Terrifying waves of energy rippled out toward the surroundings. At this moment, both Yang Ye and the black robed man were pushed backward by the aftershock!

The only difference was that the black robed man didn’t take long to stop himself while Yang Ye had been pushed over 10 km away!

As his figure was pushed back, blood kept spraying from his mouth!

Obviously, Yang Ye was at a disadvantage in this collision!

The black robed man stood in midair before Yang Ye while countless strands of black energy surrounded him. More and more of this black energy was emerging from him, and they gradually covered the entire sky!

As for Yang Ye’s sword intent, it was instantly and fully suppressed by the souls!

It was suppression due to the difference in their realms of cultivation!

Suddenly, the black robed man transformed into a black wave that swept at Yang Ye!

At this moment, the entire sky was rippling!

The powerful energy contained within the black wave was sufficient to obliterate the world!

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted slightly because he knew the black robed man was going all out now!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and clenched both his fists!

Executor shook violently while rays of sword energy rippled out incessantly from it!

Yang Ye stomped his right foot down.

Bang!

The space beneath his feet collapsed!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that shot at the black wave!

Hiss!

This expanse of the world started to collapse and be obliterated.

It couldn’t endure the force of their battle at all!

At this moment, Yang Ye felt like his body was being torn apart because he was at the center of the attack from the Soul Sect’s expert!

Rumble!

Explosions and the sound of something being torn apart resounded incessantly through the sky.

The battle here drew the attention of countless experts in the War Dimension. It wasn’t just human experts, even demon experts had been drawn over to it!

On the city walls, two old men were watching the battle between Yang Ye and the expert from the Soul Sect.

One of them who wore a white robe suddenly spoke softly, “The young sect master of the Ancient Sword Sect?”

The violet robed old man beside him nodded slightly, “Yes.”

The white robed old man spoke softly, “He’s outstanding! It’s rare to see someone at his age fight a peak Grade 2 Lord Realm expert!”

The violet robed old man said, “The Soul Sect isn’t ordinary either. Are the higher-ups really sure about letting them do as they please?”

The white robed old man chuckled, “It’s true that the Soul Sect isn’t ordinary. But the situation isn’t the same as it was all those years ago. They can’t do anything while that existence is present!”

As he spoke, he looked up at the scene of destruction in the sky, “Actually, they shouldn’t have treated the Ancient Sword Sect like that. The Ancient Sword Sect did its best during that battle all those years ago. While that Sword Master has passed away, the Ancient Sword Sect still contributed to Eternal Kingdom.”

The violet robed old man shook his head slightly, “It's a cruel world! If that fellow was still alive, then all the powers and even that person would give him some face. If he asked, even we would be unable to refuse his request. Unfortunately, sigh… Everything is forgotten once a person is gone…”

The white robed old man said, “If it wasn’t for the fact that our identities are a little special, I wouldn’t mind lending them a hand. But… sigh!”

The violet robed old man fell silent for a moment, “Then let’s help them!”

The white robed old man gazed at the violet robed old man, and the latter spoke softly, “I seek to be able to rest at ease.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the white robed old man suddenly raised his right hand, and then the sky shook violently in the distance. A moment later, a strand of powerful energy swept out from the city walls!

The violet robed old man pondered deeply for a moment, and then he waved his right hand. A ray of violet light surged up into the sky!
