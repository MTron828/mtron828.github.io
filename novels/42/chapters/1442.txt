Chapter 1443 – Again!

Lian Suyao and the others only reacted when they saw the blood spray. They were horrified, and it was especially so for Lian Suyao.

Yang Ye died just like that?

Yang Ye wasn’t dead, of course. He’d moved 3m back at the instant the saber had cut open his skin.

Yang Ye hadn’t expected her to attack, so he’d only been able to react passively. However, his reaction wasn’t slow. Moreover, he was vigilant towards her, so he’d been able to dodge at the critical moment. But the woman’s attack was truly too swift. So, he’d almost had his throat cut open!

A saber cultivator!

Just like the pig riding young woman, this young woman was a saber cultivator too. However, unlike the pig riding young woman who focused on strength to crush all her opponents, the masked woman in front of him clearly focused on speed!

Needless to say, both the pig riding young woman’s focus on strength and the masked woman’s focus on speed were extremely strong.

Moreover, her attack hadn’t been enhanced by saber intent.

Under such circumstances, she’d still been able to pierce through his defenses with such ease. So, it was obvious how terrifying her attack was!

Yang Ye rubbed his throat. The skin there had been cut open, and the saber only had to go a little bit deeper to cut into his trachea. He glanced at the blood on his palm, and then gazed at the woman. A moment later, his figure vanished on the spot, and he was by the woman’s side when his figure appeared once more. He drew his sword and swung it.

The true form of Heavenrend!

He didn’t ask her why she’d suddenly attacked. All he knew was that she wanted to kill him. Since it was like that, it was pointless to ask all of that.

Yang Ye’s sword descended, and her saber shot forward.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then the masked woman was pushed over 300m away. As for Yang Ye, he merely moved around 10m back. Right when the others thought Yang Ye had gained the upper hand, the masked woman suddenly appeared by Yang Ye’s side.

A ray of cold light flashed.

Hiss!

A strand of blood sprayed from Yang Ye’s right arm, and Yang Ye was already around 100m away.

How swift! Lian Suyao and the others had extremely solemn expressions on their faces. Because the woman’s saber techniques and speed were extremely swift.

Yang Ye’s face was extremely solemn. Her speed had surpassed his expectations a little. His arm would have been sliced off if he had been just a little slower.

There was always someone stronger in this world!

Yang Ye had never felt that he was invincible in the younger generation. He was very clearly aware that the world was huge, and there were countless experts in it. Perhaps there weren’t many geniuses who were more monstrous than him, but there were definitely not just a few as well.

Now, he’d encountered one of them.

“Again!” As soon as the woman finished speaking, she vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted, and then he closed his eyes. As soon as he did, a ray of cold light flashed. At the same time that it flashed, a ray of light from a sword suddenly appeared.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then both rays of light vanished in an instant. Meanwhile, the woman was back where she had been standing a moment ago, and Yang Ye was still on the spot.

Who had won?

A long moment of silence ensued before the masked woman spoke abruptly, “It’s rare to encounter the ability to destroy all techniques with a single attack. Not bad.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she paid no further attention to Yang Ye and just started walking forward.

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared in front of her and said, “I dealt with three attacks from you, but you only dealt with one of mine. That isn’t really fair, right?”

She nodded, “Give it a try then.”

“Of course!” As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of light that shot forward. He didn’t execute Heavenrend. Unless he overlapped two Heavenrends, it was impossible for his attacks to pose a threat to him. After all, she’d proven that when he executed Heavenrend earlier.

Yang Ye’s sword stabbed forward!

It was just a simple stab, and there was nothing special about it.

When the sword arrived before her, the woman swiftly swung her saber. Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword suddenly transformed from a stab to a sideways flick.

Clang!

A clear sound of collision resounded as the woman’s saber shook violently. Moreover, it wasn’t just her saber that shook, even her hand shook as well. Because Yang Ye had suddenly stabbed at the weakest point on her saber, causing the strength and speed it carried to be dispersed by around 90%!

After he dealt with her attack, Yang Ye didn’t stop and stabbed forward extremely swiftly. The tip of his sword stabbed straight at her chest.

At this moment, Yang Ye’s speed was swift to its limits.

Hiss!

Hiss!

Two strands of blood sprayed out. One from the woman, and one from Yang Ye.

At this moment, she was over 100m away, and there was a fine hole in her chest. That strand of blood had come from there.

As for Yang Ye, there was an injury on his arm, and blood was seeping out from it. It was a cut the woman had caused while she retreated. She was too swift, so she’d been able to retreat with ease while striking him!

Her speed was truly too swift. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Amazing!” The masked woman spoke abruptly, “If we have the chance, I’ll fight you again another day.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she started walking off into the distance, and it didn’t take long for her to vanish from their fields of vision.

Yang Ye didn’t go after her. Because it was impossible to kill her unless he executed an overlapped Heavenrend, and even if he succeeded at killing her, his profound energy would definitely be exhausted. After all, he’d exhausted most of it from resisting the miasma. So, if he executed an overlapped Heavenrend, then his profound energy would be exhausted, even if he had the Worldmend Stone!

Of course, he could release the Celestial Demon Wolves. But doing that would be equivalent to exposing a trump card of his. It was best to not rashly reveal a trump card at such a dangerous place. Moreover, even if he released the demon wolves, he may not be able to kill her because she was really too swift.

He could imagine that if she refused to fight and chose to flee, then the demon wolves would definitely be incapable of catching up to her. However, he could try to chase after her if Qiong Qi was willing to help.

In short, it wasn’t wise to expose his trump cards just to kill her. So, Yang Ye hadn’t chosen to try and kill her.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, gazed at Lian Suyao, and said, “Who was that?”

Lian Suyao shook her head, “I’ve never heard of her. She might be a genius from a different territory.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he glanced at the surroundings, “Dawn is almost here. Seize this opportunity to recover.”

Lian Suyao and the others glanced at him, and then they nodded.

At this moment, they felt beyond shocked. Lian Suyao took it comparatively better because she knew who he was. So, she wasn’t that shocked by the strength he revealed. But Xing Lie and Ning Qing were different, they didn’t know who he was. In their eyes, that Voider called Ye Yang actually possessed such terrifying strength.

As it was said, never look down on anyone in the Ominous Territory.

At this moment, Yang Ye thought the same way too. Because if he hadn’t maintained vigilance when facing that woman just now, he might have been caught off guard and killed.

There was around an hour left before the sun rises. This hour was like torture to Lian Suyao and the others. It wasn’t very difficult for them to persist until dawn arrived. The real problem was what would happen after dawn arrived.

Sometimes, humans were the most terrifying existences.

Yang Ye wasn’t thinking about all of that like Lian Suyao and the others were. The scenes of his battle with the masked woman were playing in his mind.

Even though he’d used his ability to locate flaws to deal with her attacks, only he knew how dangerous that battle had been. Because her speed was truly too swift. It could be said that if he hadn’t attained the Voider Realm, then he would have been absolutely incapable of dealing with her attacks.

They were the fastest attacks he’d ever seen!

Actually, he hoped to spar with her. Because sparring with her was tremendously beneficial to him. If he could get used to her speed, then what would that mean? It would mean that his reaction speed would be tremendously improved. At that time, unless an opponent of his could surpass her speed, speed would be of no threat to him!

Sparring with a true expert was very beneficial.

At their level, the most important to them wasn’t formidable techniques but speed and strength. When speed and strength were at a certain level, then not to mention the Laws, even Domains could be overcome by force. After all, the simplest moves were the most terrifying on many occasions.

Just like his battle with the masked woman. They hadn’t utilized sword intent or saber intent, nor had they utilized any Laws. Moreover, they hadn’t utilized any techniques either. They’d just used the simplest attacks.

However, the might of such attacks wasn’t inferior to formidable techniques. After all, he’d executed Heavenrend once, yet it hadn’t been able to harm her at all. On the contrary, utilizing his ability to locate flaws in her attacks had allowed him to injure her instead.

Of course, techniques and the Laws were extremely important as well. But if one’s strength and speed were extremely great, then the might of the techniques one executed would grow tremendously as well.

Strength and speed were the foundation!

Time trickled by. It didn’t take long for a ray of sunlight to appear outside the entrance to the city. The rays of sunlight gradually increased, and the visibility outside the city gradually grew better. At the same time, the miasma within the city grew fainter.

Another short while passed, and then the situation within and outside the city had become just as it had been when Yang Ye arrived here.

Even though miasma was still present, it was much lesser than it had been.

Meanwhile, Lian Suyao suddenly shouted, “Watch out!”

Yang Ye turned around, and he saw a figure dashing swiftly towards them.

The figure was roaring with laughter, and that person’s laughter was filled with happiness, “There really are those who seek death! Hahaha!”

There were three other people behind the figure.

In the eyes of those four fellows, Yang Ye’s group was like a group of sheep that was exposed before a pack of wolves.
