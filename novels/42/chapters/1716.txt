Chapter 1717 - Kill Until Blood Forms Rivers!

Yang Ye stopped and turned around.

Suddenly, a woman appeared before him. She wore a black dress, and there were two black phoenixes with their wings fully spread embroidered on her dress. The phoenixes had quite ferocious expressions, and they seemed ready to devour their enemies!

She couldn’t be considered to be drop dead gorgeous, but she wasn’t ugly either. She was just average. There was a palm-sized black colored claw on her neck, and the center of the claw just happened to cover her throat!

She was holding Yang Gewu’s heart in her grasp.

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment and asked, “Who are you?!”

She pressed down a little.

Bang!

The heart in her grasp exploded apart, and it only took an instant for it to be obliterated.

She shook off the blood and placed her hands behind her back, “You can’t figure it out?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while and replied, “Yang Lianshuang?”

She didn’t speak and just waved her right hand. Two bloody heads instantly appeared not too far away from Yang Ye.

Yang Ye frowned slightly as he didn’t understand what she meant.

She said, “These are the other two experts that the Yang Clan sent to Merak System. I helped you deal with them.”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Why?”

She replied, “I want to work together with you!”

“Work together?” Yang Ye continued, “Against the Yang Clan?”

She replied, “Yes!”

Yang Ye said, “There’s something I still don’t understand. I’ve killed almost all the potential successors of the Yang Clan. Logically speaking, it shouldn’t be a problem for you to become the successor, right?”

She replied, “The Yang Clan won’t let me!”

Obviously, that was no different than admitting she was Yang Lianshuang!

Yang Lianshuang!

The number one genius in the Yang Clan’s younger generation!

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Yang Lianshuang laughed coldly, “Because of the rules set by our ancestor, of course. Do you know what his rule was? He said that the Yang Clan will be destroyed in the hands of a woman, so women are prohibited from becoming the Yang Clan’s patriarch. How laughable! Just because of something he said, the women of my Yang Clan will never have a chance to gain success, and we can only be sacrifices used in marriage alliance between the clan and other clans!”

Yang Ye asked, “Is your desire to be the Yang Clan’s patriarch that strong?”

A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of her mouth, “The patriarch? Is that something great? I, Yang Lianshuang, don’t think it’s great at all!”

Yang Ye asked, “Then why are you doing everything you can to become the patriarch?!”

Yang Lianshuang closed her eyes slowly, fell silent for a long time, and finally said, “After my mother married into the Yang Clan, she only gave birth to me. Because of some complications, she wasn’t able to bear another child. So, that so-called father of mine neglected her because he wanted a boy!”

She suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, “Do you know what happened to my mother?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

A ferocious expression suddenly covered her face. At the moment ferocity filled her face, the black phoenix claw on her throat actually started trembling!

Yang Lianshuang spoke fiercely, “He married another woman, and both my mother and I were completely neglected. It was also from that day that he never visited us again. As for that woman he married, she felt that my mother and I were like a thorn in her eyes, so she tried to kill us on many occasions.”

Her face grew even fiercer, “My mother didn’t hesitate to act like she’d gone mad just to protect me, and she even didn’t allow me to cultivate because she hoped that woman would spare me if I had no cultivation. Unfortunately, she was too naïve. In the end, my mother was tortured to death by the people that woman sent. As for me, I watched from the side, I watched as she died!”

As she finished speaking, Yang Ye noticed her expression become calm once more. It was extremely calm as if it had nothing to do with her.

Yang Lianshuang continued, “I wanted to die, but because someone helped me, I lived on.” She gazed at him, “Do you know what happened in the end?”

Yang Ye replied, “That woman died?”

Yang Lianshuang looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “She had three sons. All of them were considered as young masters of the Yang Clan. One day, I captured all of them and locked them in a room. After that, I captured that woman and that man who abandoned my mother. I made them watch as I tortured their three sons to death. Didn’t he want sons? So, I let him watch as I put an end to his family line!”

Yang Ye glanced at Yang Lianshuang and asked, “Did the Yang Clan not do anything about it?”

She replied indifferently, “I’d taken their heads when the Yang Clan found out!”

Yang Ye asked, “You killed your father as well?”

“He wasn’t my father!” Yang Lianshuang looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Both he and that woman didn’t get to die that easily. I cripples their Dantians, made them kneel before my mother’s grave, and nailed them there. They knelt there until they died.”

Yang Ye asked, “What happened after the Yang Clan found out?”

A smile curled up on the corners of her mouth, “Once they found out, I revealed my natural talent, and the entire clan was shocked. They didn’t just avoid punishing me, they even started spending large amounts of resources to foster me. This is reality! This is the Yang Clan!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye said, “Then why do you want to be the patriarch? You still haven’t told me the reason!”

Yang Lianshuang looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “My mother said something before she died. Why can’t a woman be the patriarch? Why should women always be sacrificed? So, I want to be the patriarch, and I intend to invalidate the Yang Clan’s rule that women can’t be the patriarch.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Yang Lianshuang suddenly said, “Yang Ye, I understand why you don’t trust others. Because I don’t trust others either. The reason I told you all of that is because I want to work together with you! We can only resist the Yang Clan if we work together!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and said, “I can still deal with the Yang Clan, even without you!”

“How naïve!” She laughed coldly, “Yang Ye, if your strength was sufficient to deal with the Yang Clan, I would have made the Yang Clan change its patriarch a long time ago. You know nothing about the Yang Clan’s strength and reserves!”

Yang Ye said, “The Yang Clan has more trump cards?”

Yang Lianshuang replied, “The 6th stage of the True Realm. The Yang Clan has two old geezers at the 6th stage of the True Realm! Besides that, the Yang Clan has a mysterious unit of troops. Only Yang Xiao and those two old geezers know about it, and only they can give it orders. The weakest amongst the members of that unit is at the 3rd stage of the True Realm!”

Yang Ye frowned, “Where did the Yang Clan get so many True Realm experts?”

“Many?” Yang Lianshuang laughed coldly, “Yang Ye, you know nothing about the Yang Clan! As an ancient clan that has been able to survive in Milky Way System for so many years, how could only possess the strength it reveals on the surface? Of course, ordinary True Realm experts are no different than dogs to us. So long as we can deal with those three fellows, the Yang Clan will belong to me!”

Yang Ye asked, “Yang Xiao and those two 6th stage True Realm experts?”

“Yang Xiao?” A cold smile curled up on the corners of Yang Lianshuang’s mouth, “If he fights me in single combat, I’m 70% confident in my ability to kill him. He's absolutely inferior when compared to your father!”

Yang Ye asked, “If not Yang Xiao, then who?”

Yang Lianshuang spoke indifferently, “You’ll know when the time comes. It’s not that I refuse to tell you, it’s because he may not become our enemy. Of course, it’s not certain.”

Yang Ye remained silent.

Yang Lianshuang added, “Yang Ye, you want revenge, and I want control over the Yang Clan. Our objectives don’t conflict with each other. So long as we join forces, we’ll have a chance at achieving our respective objectives. Otherwise, once the Yang Clan takes you seriously and awakens those old geezers, then you’ll definitely die!”

Yang Ye thought for a long time and said, “The Yang Clan intends to use my loved ones in Merak System to threaten me. Do you have a way to deal with that?”

Work together!

He naturally intended to work together with her!

Fight the Yang Clan on his own?

It wasn’t that he didn’t dare to, but it would take a very long time. At the very least, he had to attain the True Realm or gain full control over the Wargod’s arm and make it his own arm. Only then would he have a chance to fight the entire Yang Clan on his own.

He didn’t want to wait for so long, and the Yang Clan wouldn’t let him live for that long!

So, he chose to work together with her.

Yang Lianshuang’s strength was absolutely beyond any doubt. Moreover, she possessed high status in the Yang Clan and knew many things that he didn’t know about.

She said, “I don’t have any special ideas. There’s only one way, and it’s to kill! Kill all the experts from the Yang Clan who’re traveling to Merak System! Kill them until the Yang Clan doesn’t dare to use such a method again!”

Yang Ye said, “I’m afraid that some would get by. Merak System is unlike the Milky Way System. True Realm experts are invincible over there!”

“There’s no need to worry!” She continued, “I know every move that the Yang Clan makes.”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “If we exhaust the Yang Clan’s strength like this, even if you gain control of the clan, it wouldn’t be the same Yang Clan anymore. Right?”

She replied, “Give me 30 years. I’ll make the Yang Clan regain its former glory. Moreover, that’s my business. You don’t have to worry too much about it. Your goal is to resolve the problems that you’re facing right now. I can only provide you with information, and I can’t step forward and help you in the open.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “Be careful of the Ku Clan and Ying Clan!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Yang Lianshuang smiled, “Those stubborn old fools of the clan didn’t hesitate to give up some of the clan’s interests to kill you. It’s sufficient to tempt both the Ying Clan and Ku Clan. For example, some places that contain inheritances or some worlds. I’m not sure of the specifics. In short, you must watch out for them. Their strength and resources are even greater than the Yang Clan.”

The Ying Clan!

The Ku Clan!

Yang Ye took a deep breath. There were always brave people when sufficient rewards were provided! It wasn’t just the Ying Clan and Ku Clan, even the other clans may act against him!

In short, danger was all around him!

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he started chuckling.

Yang Lianshuang asked, “What are you laughing about?”

Yang Ye replied, “I’m laughing at myself. I’m laughing at myself for thinking too much about everything. One shouldn’t overthink things in life. Not to mention the Yang Clan, Ku Clan, and Ying Clan, even if all eight clans come to kill me, why would I fear them? It’s a perfect opportunity to kill to my heart’s content! It’s perfect to kill until blood forms rivers!”
