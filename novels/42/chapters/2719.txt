Chapter 2720 – Countless Sword Sects!

Once Yang Ye said that, a few rays of light shot up into the air, and then four figures appeared nearby.

They bowed to Yang Ye, “Sect Master!”

He glanced at them. He recognized all of them, they were disciples of the sect, and Lu Yunxian was among them.

Yang Ye asked, “Shall we leave?”

They exchanged glances and seemed to be visibly hesitant.

A short while later, Lu Yunxian stepped forward and shook his head, “Sect Master, we can’t leave. Our families and loved ones are still here in the city.”

Yang Ye said, “Tell them to come with us!”

They were stunned by this.

Leave together?

Yang Ye nodded, “I don’t want to interfere in the Eternal Kingdom’s business, but I have to take care of all of you. Both you and your loved ones have no hope of survival if you remain here. Tell them to come here and leave with us for somewhere else.”

They were quite hesitant.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “All of you will die if you stay, so what are you hesitating for?”

Lu Yunxian replied, “I’m afraid War City…”

Yang Ye replied coldly, “Would they dare to refuse?”

Lu Yunxian glanced at Yang Ye and smiled, “Alright, we’ll get them!”

They excitedly entered the city again.

Yang Ye looked up at the sky, “Is the Ye Clan here?”

An old man appeared before Yang Ye. It was the Ye Clan’s ancestor and Ye Zhibei.

The Ye Clan’s ancestor smiled, “Long time no see.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Senior, I’m sure you’re aware of the situation. Allow me to be honest, even if you can keep them out for a few dozen years, it’s pointless, isn’t it?”

The Ye Clan’s ancestor fell silent for a moment and said, “I know, but I still can’t leave. The Xing Clan’s patriarch fell in battle, and that old man from the Lu Clan is seriously injured. We’re lacking experts in the Destiny Realm.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Meanwhile, the old man added, “Besides that, so long as the End World and the other monstrous geniuses like you don’t help the desolate race, it’ll be very difficult for them to break their way in here. Furthermore, if my Ye Clan’s disciples are able to survive this danger, it will be very beneficial to them. So, I’m grateful for your kindness.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand.”

He gazed at Ye Zhibei, “If a day comes when War Dimension is breached and I’m still alive, send me a voice transmission. I’ll come for you and your clan.”

The Ye Clan’s ancestor was overjoyed.

While he had chosen to stay, it was a risky bet. If the Ye Clan survived this hopeless situation, its forces would definitely become extremely terrifying. However, it was a very, very risky bet. After all, once War City was breached, the Ye Clan would vanish from this world. Yet now, they had Yang Ye’s promise, so it represented that the Ye Clan would survive even if Eternal Kingdom lost!

How could he not feel overjoyed from that?

Ye Zhibei was quite visibly moved as well. She glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Thank you.”

This promise could truly be described as something that would save the Ye Clan’s life!

Meanwhile, the others on the city walls had extremely complicated feelings in their hearts.

The Ye Clan received such treatment because it had chosen not to target Yang Ye!

Regret!

Especially the Xing Clan. If they had made Xing Biqing stay, then perhaps their clan would receive such treatment. Unfortunately, they had made her leave!

Now that they’d lost her, they had no right to speak to Yang Ye!

Yang Ye wasn’t the same Yang Ye who had been hunted by the entire Eternal Kingdom!

Meanwhile, Lu Yunxian and the others led a group out of the city. No one in the city stopped them. Even if they wanted to, they didn’t dare to! Both the desolate race and Eternal Kingdom didn’t dare to go head-on against Yang Ye!

Yang Ye ignored the experts on the city walls and gazed at Ye Zhibei, “Farewell.”

He shot up into the air with Lu Yunxian and the others.

The Ye Clan’s ancestor sighed softly as he watched Yang Ye’s group leave, ‘Zhibei, we’re lucky that we didn’t choose to go against him.”

Ye Zhibei’s lips curled into quite a moving smile.

…

Outside the War Dimension.

A group of experts surrounded Yang Ye’s group upon seeing them emerge from the War Dimension. However, they immediately retreated upon noticing that it was Yang Ye.

This fellow couldn’t be stopped, otherwise, it would lead to trouble.

Yang Ye glanced at them and walked away.

Suddenly, Huang Ying said, “Brother Yang.”

Yang Ye stopped, and he continued, “Can you help us? Just this once!”

So long as Yang Ye summoned Snowy, these formations would vanish in an instant. It could be said that the little fellow just had to wave her tiny paw, and everyone in the War Dimension would die! And the desolate race would truly win!

At that time, the desolate race would be the new master of the Eternal Kingdom, and it would set the rules of this place!

Yang Ye glanced at Huang Ying and shook his head, “No.”

Yang Ye vanished into the sky with the others.

Huang Ying’s face was calm because he’d expected that answer.

Meanwhile, Huang Buer suddenly said, “He’s a very unstable element!”

Huang Xuan nodded, “He’s too overbearing. The way he treated us is an insult to our race, and the descendants of our race should never forget this humiliation.”

Yang Ye had openly entered the War Dimension and taken people from there, and that was undoubtedly a form of disregard to the desolate race. Moreover, he’d even threatened them to not harm the sprites of this world. It could be said that he was openly disregarding them!

When had they ever been insulted like this?

Suddenly, Huang Buer shook his head, “Don’t think like that.”

Huang Xuan gazed at Huang Buer, and the latter spoke solemnly, “If our patriarch was here, then perhaps he would have to consider our patriarch. However, our patriarch is gone, so it’s best if we don’t offend him. Not to mention us, even the End World wasn’t able to get the upper hand against him. But that’s fine because he has gotten himself swept into the enmity between the End World and Destiny, and one side will die in the end. Perhaps Yang Ye will vanish from this world soon.”

Huang Xuan nodded. An outcome had to be decided between Yang Ye and those extraordinary figures!

Their job was to watch from the sidelines and reap the rewards!

Meanwhile, Huang Ying suddenly said, “Let’s do this. Once we’re done here, we will have nothing to worry about!”

As soon as he said that, “Countless experts charged at the War Dimension. At the same time, countless formations were activated within the War Dimension. The combined strength of these formations wasn’t any weaker to the formations that the End World had set up that day!

However, the desolate race clearly had a strategy to deal with it, it was to use numbers against it!

They planned to exhaust the War Dimension to death!

…

Meanwhile, Yang Ye stopped in outer space.

Lu Yunxian and the others bowed to Yang Ye, and then the others behind them bowed as well.

Yang Ye could be said to have saved their lives!

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “It was nothing.”

He glanced at them and continued, “What do you plan to do now?”

Lu Yunxian spoke solemnly, “We plan to leave for another world. The spirit energy there may be inferior, but it’s safe, at least. I think we can return once everything in the Eternal Kingdom calms down.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded, “Alright.”

Eternal Kingdom wasn’t very peaceful now, and staying was too dangerous!

Lu Yunxian hesitated for a moment and said, “Sect Master, how are things between you and the End World?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t worry about me, just take care of yourselves.”

Lu Yunxian nodded because they really were incapable of interfering in Yang Ye’s problems. If they did, they would only be causing trouble for him.

Lu Yunxian seemed to have thought of something at this point, and he added, “Right, some of the others started their own sects in other worlds. Even though they are only small sects, I think it’s quite good. Besides that, all of them are using the Ancient Sword Sect’s name.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “All of them built a statue for you, and they tell their disciples that you are the true sect master.”

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “Seriously.”

Lu Yunxian smiled, “Perhaps many disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect will come to the Eternal Kingdom. At that time, they will hear about you! However, they are quite worried.

Yang Ye asked, “What are they worried about?”

Lu Yunxian replied, “They are worried you won’t be happy! However, they said that so long as you need something, they will come no matter where you are! Moreover, they will only acknowledge you as the sect master!”

Yang Ye hadn’t abandoned the Ancient Sword Sect in its time of need, and he’d protected it all the way. Moreover, they could be said to have gone through thick and thin with Yang Ye. So, the disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect thought of Yang Ye as their one and only sect master.

Yang Ye smiled and said, “I don’t mind. If it’s possible, contact them and tell them that establishing a sect is a good thing. However, I really don’t want to see our disciples killing each other!”

Lu Yuntian replied solemnly, “Don’t worry, Sect Master. We will never do that.”

Yang Ye nodded. He seemed to have thought of something and gazed at Lu Yunxian, “Are you thinking of establishing one too?”

Lu Yunxian smiled embarrassedly, “We do plan to do that.”

Yang Ye nodded and smiled, “Alright.”

He flicked a ray of white light into Lu Yunxian’s forehead.

Lu Yunxian was stunned, “What is that?”

Yang Ye replied, “Some of the sword techniques I learned in the past, and some of my comprehension and experience. I hope it’ll be of help to all of you!”

Lu Yunxian was stunned for a moment, and then gave Yang Ye a deep and long bow.

Yang Ye smiled, “Go on, I hope we’ll meet again one day!”

Lu Yunxian nodded, “Take care, Sect Master!”

They turned around and left.

Yang Ye watched them leave in silence.
