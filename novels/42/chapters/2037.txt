Chapter 2038 – Just Fight!

The middle aged man’s expression was extremely unsightly.

A single attack!

Yang Ye had taken his arm with a single attack, and he hadn’t even been able to react!

The gap in their strength was like the gap between the heavens and the earth!

The middle aged man shook his head and vanished on the spot.

…

Yang Ye shot swiftly through the clouds on his sword.

The Weapon Path!

Yang Ye shot swiftly through the clouds according to the map given to him by the middle aged man from the Weapon Path. The clouds were torn open in his wake, and if one looked from the ground, it would seem like someone had torn open a hole in the sky.

The Weapon Path belonged to the large universe too, but it was in its own small universe.

It wasn’t just the Weapon Path which existed like that, all other powers that possessed sufficient strength would always reside in their own independent universe. However, these smaller universes were still within the vast borders of the large universe.

After flying for around three days, Yang Ye stopped.

At this moment, he was in an expanse of outer space, and stars filled his field of vision.

The vast universe!

A huge black vortex stood before Yang Ye, and there was a huge sword in front of it.

The sword was there right in front of the black vortex like it was protecting the vortex.

Yang Ye walked over and noticed a string of words inscribed on the sword—Those who aren’t members of the Weapon Path trespass at their own risk!

At their own risk!

Yang Ye shook his head, “How overbearing!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he tapped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that entered the black vortex.

Once he passed through the vortex, a new world appeared before him.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings while in a slight daze. This world wasn’t any different from the outside world. It was the same blue sky and white clouds.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. Suddenly, an old man appeared before Yang Ye. The old man’s eyes were like a hawk, small and sharp, and there was a trace of gloominess in them. It felt like he was a vicious and vile person!

The old man said, “Young Martial Uncle asked me to get you!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “Young Martial Uncle?”

The old man explained indifferently, “The person who gave you the Weapon Seal. He asked me to wait for you here. Come with me!”

The old man turned around and walked away.

Yang Ye glanced at the old man and followed him.

On the way, the old man said, “This place is called the Weapon Dimension. The Weapon Dimension is linked to the large universe but isolated. If outsiders aren’t authorized by my Weapon Path, then they can’t enter at all. There are six lines in the Weapon Path, and they respectively reside in the north, south, east, west, and center of the Weapon Dimension.”

“What about the last line?” asked Yang Ye. Because the old man had only listed five places.

The old man glanced upwards, “Up there!”

Yang Ye nodded and gazed at the old man. The old man continued, “Our Slaughter Line is situated in the south. According to the theory of the five element stars, the south represents slaughter.”

The old man stopped and pointed towards the distance, “Over there!”

Yang Ye looked up. There was a huge mountain floating upside down over there. The bottom of the mountain had been sliced off, and it was like a top floating around 300m above the ground.

It looked very imposing!

“Gracious Mountain!” Meanwhile, the old man explained, “The main mountain of the Slaughter Line. Now, it’s yours!”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, “Mine?”

The old man nodded, “Yours. However, the precondition is that you can keep it that way.”

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, you’re not from the Slaughter Line?”

The old man shook his head, “No, I just do odd jobs and light fires for the Slaughter Line. In the future, only the two of us will be here. I’ll be in charge of cooking, and you’re in charge of the rest.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “What about the Young Martial Uncle?”

The old man shook his head, “I don’t know.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “If you meet him, tell him that I accept the fact that he tricked me and got me into this. But if the Weapon Path bullies me… For example, if the Weapon Immortal or any other Sage tries to kill me, and he doesn’t help, then I’m going to run.”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “It’s too late to run now!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

The old man replied indifferently, “As soon as you arrived, all the other lines knew of your presence. Now, fleeing will only lead to your death. Even if you escape, your troubles will be endless.”

Yang Ye’s face fell, “I think that Young Martial Uncle of yours is quite wicked!”

Not only did the old man not get angry, he nodded and said, “Indeed!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

“Let’s go!” The old man was at the foot of the mountain when he finished speaking.

Yang Ye shook his head and hurried after the old man.

At the top of Gracious Mountain, a huge square was in front of Yang Ye. It was made from limestone, and it was extremely huge. It was over 10km wide, and there was a huge stone statue at its center.

It was a statue of a middle aged man, and the middle aged man had a sword hanging by his waist. He was looking ahead with an extremely sharp gaze.

“The first Seal Master of my Slaughter Line!” The old man explained, “He perished years ago during the war with the god race.”

The god race!

Yang Ye glanced at the old man and looked off into the distance. There was a huge palace behind the square, and there were two more behind the first one. They were elevated like stairs, so he could see all of them with a single glance.

All three of them were extremely luxurious and imposing. Especially the last one, it was at the top, and there were two huge flying dragons on it. Of course, they weren’t real dragons, and they were carved from unknown rock!

The old man led Yang Ye forward, and it didn’t take long for them to arrive before the first palace. It was completely empty and quiet. Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and he noticed numerous meditation cushions here. There were around 100 of them!

“The Meditation Palace!” The old man explained, “The Slaughter Line focuses on slaughter, so everyone has fierce slaughter intent, and if it’s too fierce, it may corrode our minds. So, the disciples of the Slaughter Line must spend four hours meditating every day to neutralize their desire to kill!”

He suddenly gazed at Yang Ye and asked, “How do you usually neutralize your desire to kill?”

“Neutralize?” Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t.”

The old man was puzzled, “Huh?”

Yang Ye explained, “Why neutralize it? If you have the desire to kill, then release it. It’ll be gone once you release it, right?”

The old man replied, “Releasing it represents killing someone!”

Yang Ye replied, “If you have the desire to kill, it represents that someone has aroused my desire to kill. Since that has happened, I naturally have to kill, right?”

The old man took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, “That does sound right!”

He walked out of the palace once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and followed the old man. It didn’t take long for them to arrive at the second palace.

“This is the Weapon Palace!” The old man spoke while standing at the entrance, “It’s where the Slaughter Line stores all its treasures.”

Yang Ye’s eyes lit up, and he was about to walk in, but the old man suddenly said, “Don’t get happy. The other five lines have plundered everything in there. There’s nothing left in there!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

A short while passed before Yang Ye said, “I don’t understand something. Why is the Weapon Path engaging in internal strife? Why did the Prediction Line attack the Slaughter Line? Why did the other four Lines stand by idly when that happened?”

Yang Ye had asked all the questions he had in his heart.

Since he’d been swept into the internal strife of the Weapon Path, he naturally had to get to the bottom of many things. Otherwise, he would die before he even knew what hit him.

The old man fell silent.

Yang Ye had no intention to give up and just stared at the old man.

A long time passed before the old man said, “Young Martial Uncle will tell you the answer when the time comes. Moreover, it’s pointless for you to know right now. All you have to do now is think about how to survive!”

“Huh?” Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What do you mean?”

The old man said, “Do you think the Prediction Line will let the Slaughter Line rise up again? They can’t do anything to Young Martial Uncle, but what about you? They can do something about you. So, you have to be thinking about how to survive until you participate in the Weapon Path’s competition.”

He turned around and walked off, “Only people with value will be paid attention to, and you have to prove your worth. You’ll only be safer once you’ve proven your worth. Because at that time, Young Martial Uncle won’t allow anyone to play dirty tricks, and if the value you reveal is sufficiently high, then Young Martial Uncle won’t be the only one who protects you. Even the ancestor of our Weapon Path won’t let anyone play any dirty tricks!”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “What if I can’t prove my worth?”

The old man stopped and said, “What do you think?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he walked out of the Weapon Palace and his voice came from outside, “Come, I’ll take you to the last palace!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “This is a really deep hole! However, if you want to trap me, then don’t blame me for doing as I please.”

As soon as Yang Ye walked outside, the old man appeared in front of him again. Yang Ye was about to speak when the old man said, “Deal with the problem in front of us first!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Huh?”

Meanwhile, he suddenly looked up at the square, and loud laughter suddenly resounded from there, “I heard the Slaughter Line has a new Seal Master. Come! Come! Let me have a look and see what kind of trash you are! Don’t worry, I won’t kill you! Hahaha!”

The old man gazed at Yang Ye, and Yang Ye chuckled, “The Weapon Path? Who am I afraid of? Let’s just fight!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of light that shot forward like a bolt of lightning.
