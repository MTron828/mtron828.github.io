Chapter 1869 – Broken Sword!

Danger was present here!

It was a warning from the tiny vortex!

Yang Ye’s face fell.

The Primordial Pagoda rarely warned him, and it hadn’t given him a warning even when he encountered the monkey. However, it was actually warning him. In other words, the place the Asura Exalt wanted to go was absolutely dangerous.

Because the Primordial Pagoda wasn’t the same as it had been all those years ago. Since it sensed danger, it was absolutely terrifying.

The Asura Exalt asked abruptly, “What is it?”

Yang Ye glanced at the Asura Exalt and shook his head, “It’s nothing.”

After the Primordial Pagoda gave him that warning, he didn’t want to go to that place. However, breaking his promises was against his principles. Even though he was shameless sometimes, it depended on the person. If someone else kept their word to him, then he would naturally do the same. Conversely, if someone acted shamelessly, then he would naturally not keep his word!

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he gazed at the Asura Exalt, “You want me to help you break open the barrier?”

The Asura Exalt nodded, “Yes! Is there a problem?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “No, there isn’t. However, I’ll only help you break it open, and I’ll leave as soon as it’s done.”

The Asura Exalt frowned, “You’re afraid I’d kill you to keep you quiet? If it’s that, you don’t have to worry. It isn’t an ordinary place, so there’s definitely countless dangers within it. Thus, a single person can’t clear out that entire place. I invited you with the intent of exploring that place with you!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Sorry, I’ll only break open the barrier!”

The Asura Exalt spoke solemnly, “Yang Ye, I’ve looked into you, and I know a little about your character. You’re a brave and ambitious person. As far as I’m concerned, you wouldn’t give up such an opportunity. But your decision has surprised me a little!”

Yang Ye replied, “Asura Exalt, you returned my second sister’s Quintessence Blood Pearl to me, and I’m grateful for that. So, I’ll say a little more. As far as I’m concerned, the place you spoke about is an extremely dangerous place. So, you can think about whether you really want to go there. Of course, no matter what your decision is, I’ll definitely keep my word and break the barrier for you!”

The Asura Exalt fell silent for a long time before he said, “Then let’s go!”

He would naturally not give up just because of something Yang Ye said.

Yang Ye didn’t say anything else and just followed the Asura Exalt.

It didn’t take long for them to arrive in a place covered in mist, and the Asura Exalt suddenly stopped, “Be careful!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

The Asura Exalt replied, “Watch out of the Xenosprites. They’re extremely mysterious and usually take your head before you can even react.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then his sword appeared in his grasp.

The Asura Exalt glanced at the sword in Yang Ye’s grasp and said, “Countless people want that sword, but they dare not take it. However, you did!”

Yang Ye replied, “It wants to stay with me!”

The Asura Exalt nodded slightly, “True. It’s a divine sword. If it’s unwilling to stay with you, you wouldn’t be able to force it to stay. Alright, let’s continue forward!”

He shot towards the distance.

Yang Ye glanced at the Asura Exalt and followed him.

Around 15 minutes later, the mist around them grew denser and denser.

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s pupils constricted, and then he swung his sword.

As soon as his sword descended, a green claw appeared a few dozen centimeters above his head.

Hiss!

Yang Ye’s sword slashed it into two, and then…

“Screech!” An ear piercing shrill cry resounded around 1km away from Yang Ye, and then a ray of black light shot towards Yang Ye from within the mist.

Yang Ye raised his sword and swung it again!

His attack instantly obliterated the black light, but Yang Ye noticed that specks of black had appeared on the sword. However, it only took a moment for the sword to tremble, and then a ray of golden light flashed before those specks of black vanished.

“As expected of a divine sword!” Suddenly, the Asura Exalt said, “Do you know what that black light was?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

“It was a lethal move of the Xenosprites. It’s extremely corrosive. Even mid-grade Imperial Rank treasures are instantly melted upon contact. But that sword…” The Asura Exalt shook his head at this point and continued, “Your sword is simply the bane of these Xenosprites! Unfortunately, that injured Xenosprite was able to escape.”

Yang Ye said, “These Xenosprites don’t seem very strong!”

The corners of the Asura Exalt’s mouth twitched, “That’s because you have that sword, and we don’t. So, we have to be very careful when we fight them. Because if even a bit of that black light touches us, then even we will be transformed into a puddle of black water within ten breaths of time!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

“Let’s go! We must get there before it gets dark. Otherwise, even stronger Xenosprites will appear.” The Asura Exalt continued forward once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye asked, “Why aren’t we flying?”

The Asura Exalt shook his head, “These Xenosprites are very sensitive to fluctuations of space and profound energy. They’ll swarm over like mad dogs if they sense even the slightest fluctuation.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I see!”

They sped up.

Two hours later, Yang Ye and the Asura Exalt encountered another Xenosprite.

This time, Yang Ye saw its appearance clearly.

Needless to say, it was extremely ugly. Its head was huge like a ball, and it didn’t have any facial features. There was only a thumb-sized eye there. As for its lower body, it had four tentacles that were covered in balls of flesh. Obviously, Yang Ye was disgusted as soon as he saw it!

Screech!

One of the Xenosprites flew off in Yang Ye’s direction. Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath. He just twisted his right foot on the ground and transformed into a ray of light that shot towards it.

Just as the Asura Exalt had said, the corrosive black light was the most terrifying aspect about these Xenosprites. However, Yang Ye didn’t fear the corrosive black light at all. Actually, it wasn’t him but the sword in his grasp.

Around a quarter of an hour later, Yang Ye had killed two Xenosprites.

The Asura Exalt flicked his fingers, and those two Xenosprites exploded apart. After that, two thumb-sized white pearls floated out. As soon as that happened, Yang Ye smelled a refreshing smell.

Yang Ye was quite puzzled, “What is that?”

“Sprite Cores!” The Asura Exalt explained, “The Xenosprites have Sprite Cores, and these cores can improve our cultivation. You’re at the 5th stage of the True Realm now. You should be able to attain the 6th stage by absorbing around 10 of these!”

He flicked those two Sprite Cores over to Yang Ye while he spoke.

The 6th stage of the True Realm! Yang Ye took the Sprite Cores, and he immediately sensed a strand of powerful energy. He felt that the Asura Exalt wasn’t lying, and he really could charge to the 6th stage of the True Realm if he had a few more. Once he attained the 6th stage of the True Realm, his strength would definitely undergo a tremendous transformation!

Yang Ye didn’t consume them. He put them away, and then they continued forward.

As they traveled, Yang Ye and the Asura Exalt encountered more Xenosprites. This time, Yang Ye didn’t feel they were annoying at all, and he was quite excited. Because their Sprite Cores were amazing treasures. So, he’d decided to gather more.

These things were absolutely helpful to An Nanjing, Nether Maiden, and the others.

Just like that, Yang Ye and the Asura Exalt killed as they traveled.

A day later, Yang Ye had obtained around 20 Sprite Cores. The Asura Exalt gained quite a few too. Of course, it was all thanks to Yang Ye’s help. After all, Yang Ye helped him deal with all the black light that were shot at them.

Even though he could do it himself, his method wasted a lot of time. Because his method was to just avoid it…

Two days later, they arrived before a river. The river was very long, and they couldn’t see the ends of it.

Yang Ye asked, “It’s below?”

The Asura Exalt nodded slightly, “I encountered danger here that day, so I went underwater in a moment of desperation. However, I never expected another world to be at the bottom of this river.”

Yang Ye looked down at the bottom of the river. The river’s water was very clear, so he could see right to the bottom. However, there was nothing there. Yang Ye scanned it with his divine sense, but he still didn’t find anything.

It was a very normal river!

That was what Yang Ye thought.

The Asura Exalt smiled, “Come, let’s go down there, and you’ll understand.”

As he spoke, he shot down into the river. Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and followed him. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

It didn’t take long for them to arrive at the bottom of the river. Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, but the surroundings were still very normal. Suddenly, the Asura Exalt tapped his right foot against the riverbed, and then the entire riverbed started to tremble violently. In just a short while, the river water before them split apart, and then a passageway appeared in front of them. The passageway was around 300m in length, and there was a pitch black door at the end of it.

There were two pieces of a broken sword stabbed into the door!

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted into the size of needles when he saw the broken sword.

He recognized it.

It belonged to the Unfettered One!
