Chapter 2820 – Come at Me!

Yang Ye stared blankly at Tian Xiu’s gradually descending corpse.

Streams of blood red were gradually seeping out from the corners of his eyes!

Tian Xiu!

The scenes of the past kept flashing through his mind.

“I’m Tian Xiu, the patriarch of the void race…”

“My people are gone, so what’s the point of living?”

“Come on, let’s leave this universe…”

“Who dares to touch him?”

“What are you talking about?! I’m your sister…”

Yang Ye clenched his fists while his body trembled.

Destiny chuckled before him, “If you care so much about life and death, you will be enslaved by it. You…”

“Fuck you!” Yang Ye howled with fury, and he swung his sword at her with both hands!

The Fate Sword Domain combined with the Fate Sword Dao!

Yang Ye practically unleashed all his strength into this attack!

Destiny raised her sword in front of her.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted extremely far away.

Suddenly, Qi Bitian appeared above Destiny. There was a fierce grin on the corners of her mouth as she slammed her left palm down.

She only knew three moves.

This was the final move!

“Destiny Annihilation!”

It was the name she’d given that move.

Along with the descent of Qi Bitian’s palm, the space below was obliterated inch by inch. It was being truly obliterated to the point even dark matter was being destroyed!

Destiny remained indifferent as she stabbed her sword upward.

Hiss!

It stabbed through the center of Qi Bitian’s left palm.

Bang!

In an instant, Qi Bitian’s entire left arm exploded into bits. However, Destiny was pushed 300m down as well. At the same time, streams of terrifying energy descended incessantly.

Destiny shook her head slightly, “The extremes of strength. Unfortunately, that isn’t enough!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she waved her sword gently.

Hiss!

The energy above her started to collapse inch by inch!

Qi Bitian was about to attack again when Yang Ye suddenly appeared before her. She gazed at him, “Kid, you’re not going to ask me to flee too, right?”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Qi Bitian spoke softly, “Fool! She wants to destroy what she considers to be the Dao, and it includes everything. Even people like us who are included in the scope of that Dao.”

“Dao Annihilation… Annihilation of all things…” Yang Ye suddenly muttered as if he’d lost his soul, “The Dao always leaves an opportunity, and she has seized that opportunity and transcended the Grand Dao. Moreover, she wants to annihilate the Grand Dao… Transcend… No, no, no, no! Ahhhh!”

Yang Ye was practically howling with rage.

Qi Bitian spoke softly, “Kid, don’t force it, just do your best. Even if we can’t escape death in the end, all that matters is that we tried our best.”

As she spoke, she arrived before Destiny. She glanced at Tian Xiu’s corpse that had fallen to the ground, and she grinned, “Sister, I’m coming!”

As soon as she finished speaking, her figure suddenly expanded, and then it exploded. A wave of powerful energy raged at Destiny like a storm.

Boom!

Destiny was pushed back repeatedly. However, along with a swing of her sword, the energy created by the explosion was instantly obliterated.

Destiny waved her right hand lightly, and the area destroyed by the explosion instantly returned to normal.

Meanwhile, Qi Bitian had ceased to exist in this world.

Destiny gazed at Yang Ye and walked slowly in his direction. Meanwhile, Snowy appeared on Yang Ye’s shoulder.

Destiny stopped moving.

She smiled, “Are you going to return to your original form? If you are, I would be quite interested!”

Snowy stared at her while holding tightly to her Sprite Staff. Suddenly, she tossed the Sprite Staff at Destiny.

Destiny shook her head and stabbed at it.

Bang!

The Sprite Stuff instantly exploded into pieces!

A moment later, a sword shot at Snowy.

Snowy didn’t attack again. She knew that she was no match for the woman before her, so she turned around, hugged Yang Ye’s neck, and just stayed close to him.

Right when the sword was around 3m away from Snowy, a fist slammed against Justice!

Bam!

Justice was blasted away!

Snowy turned around, and she saw a petite young girl standing before her. The girl had a pair of long black horns.

Erya!

It was Erya!

Destiny glanced at Erya and smiled, “The Evil Progenitor… The Evil Progenitor at her prime, interesting indeed.”

Erya glanced coldly at Destiny. In the end, she gazed at Yang Ye and Snowy, but her gaze was still icy cold.

Snowy gently touched Erya’s horns. Erya didn’t move away and allowed Snowy to do so. A short while later, Snowy started waving her paws swiftly. She was waving them while pointing at Destiny, and her chubby face was covered in anxiety!

Run!

Snowy was asking Erya to run!

Erya gazed at Snowy and Yang Ye, and two streams of tears gradually flowed down her face. When she saw Erya cry, Snowy started crying as well, and the two little fellows just started crying like that…

Suddenly, a sword flashed.

Erya withdrew something and placed it in Snowy’s paws, and then she turned around and charged at the sword.

It was a tanghulu!

At the moment Erya turned around, a wave of destructive force suddenly swept out of her. It was so powerful that the sky instantly dimmed down before her, and the sword, which had arrived before her now, was instantly blasted back to Destiny.

Destiny stretched out her hand and Justice landed firmly in her grasp. Meanwhile, Erya’s fist was slamming down at her!

Strength!

This punch carried pure strength!

And it was absolutely the greatest in the universe!

Destiny grinned, and there was a trace of battle intent in her eyes. A moment later, she stabbed her sword at the fist.

Bang!

The world shook before their collision.

Destiny was pushed 300m back while Erya didn’t just avoid being pushed back, she even pressed forward, and she slammed another punch at Destiny!

Destiny grinned as she pressed her sword against her forehead. In this instant, the world seemed to become motionless. A moment later, Erya arrived before her, but Destiny vanished on the spot and appeared over 1km behind Erya.

Erya seemed like she’d been frozen on the spot behind Destiny.

A moment of silence ensued, and then the scales throughout Erya’s body started to crack apart and fall off her. After that, her figure crashed to the ground!

Snowy was stunned by the sight of this.

The tanghulu fell from her paw.

Meanwhile, countless below were enveloped in despair!

Despair!

Everyone seemed so tiny before that woman who was like a god, and they seemed so weak! Could anyone in this world stop her?

No one could!

Once she killed Yang Ye, just a single thought of hers would be enough to obliterate the Three Dimensional Universe, just as she’d done to the Four Dimensional Universe!

Death!

All of them could only wait for death to arrive!

She walked toward Yang Ye and Snowy, and a faint smile still remained on her face.

Suddenly, she stopped and turned around. A sword cultivator was walking over slowly from the distant sky.

A sword cultivator!

He wore a cloud white robe, had a sword by his waist, and was just walking over from above the clouds.

It was the Unfettered One!

Destiny grinned, “I’ve been waiting for you!”

The Unfettered One walked over to her, “I went above the clouds, but you weren’t there.”

She smiled, “I just came down here. I forgot to tell you about that.”

He nodded, “That’s fine!”

As he spoke, he took his sword in his right hand and swung it.

A ray of sword energy flashed.

Bang!

An explosion resounded and Destiny was pushed 3km away!

Justice was trembling in her grasp!

Destiny grinned, “The extremes of the Emotionless Sword Dao. Interesting! Try a swing of my sword now!”

As soon as she finished speaking, her figure suddenly became motionless.

The Unfettered One frowned slightly and stabbed at her.

Bam!

The Unfettered One was pushed 3km back, and as soon as he stopped himself, the space behind him cracked open!

The Unfettered One looked up at her, “You’re very strong.”

Destiny’s grin grew wider as she walked slowly in the Unfettered One’s direction. Every step she took created a strand of sword energy beneath her feet, and with every subsequent step, the previous strand of sword energy would overlap with the newly generated strand of sword energy.

A Sword Dao with each step!

Destiny had comprehended numerous types of Sword Daos throughout the countless years of the past, and she’d practically attained the limits of them all, even the Emotionless Sword Dao. Because when that young boy died in the crevice all those years ago, she had no further ties to this world.

Comprehending countless Sword Daos wasn’t the most terrifying thing, the most terrifying thing was her ability to merge them all!

A myriad of Sword Daos merged into one!

Destiny walked until she was just around 30m away from the sword cultivator. At this moment, there was only a single strand of sword energy beneath her feet, but it was unprecedentedly powerful!

She gazed at the Unfettered One and smiled, “Will you face this attack of mine?”

The Unfettered One gradually gripped his sword, but at this moment, he noticed to his astonishment that he was actually incapable of drawing it!

He couldn’t draw his sword!nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The smile on Destiny’s face widened while Justice shook violently and let out a resounding sword howl. She glanced at the Unfettered One and Yang Ye, “Both of you can come at me! Let me see the extremes of the Emotionless Sword Dao and the Sword Dao of Emotion!”
