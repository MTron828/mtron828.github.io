Chapter 2668 – Destiny Dimension!

Yang Ye was quite stunned too!

Snowy had actually merged those three swords!

How did she do it?

Snowy’s eyes lit up when she saw them merge into one, and then she knocked the blade lightly with her paw. After that, she gazed at Yang Ye with excitement all over her face.

Yang Ye grinned and praised her.

Snowy cracked a smile, and then she took the sword out of the wooden house and left on it.

In the wooden house.

The woman in black’s face remained indifferent.

Yang Ye smiled embarrassedly. He changed the topic to prevent her from venting on him, “Anyway, what were those eyes?”

He’d wanted to ask about the eyes for a long time!

She replied indifferently, “Knowing that won’t change anything.”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m just asking. I’m quite curious. It’s fine if you refuse to tell me.”

She really didn’t tell him.

Yang Ye was quite speechless.

He hesitated for a moment and asked, “What about the old man with the bamboo chest? Will he be in danger/”

The woman in black fell silent for a while and replied, “I don’t think so!”

She wasn’t certain!

Yang Ye’s face gradually turned solemn. According to her tone, the old man may be in danger!

Yang Ye asked, “Why did he help?”

Even though he knew the old man, the old man had no reason to help him. If the old man wasn’t helping him, then it may be for the woman in black.

She glanced at Yang Ye, “You’ll find out in the future. Don’t waste your time on that for now. Quickly get me to my Destiny Dimension. I must recover as soon as possible.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “Can I ask if you’ll start slaughtering once you’ve recovered?”

He was quite worried about that. If she did act against him, he would definitely be incapable of stopping her. Even if she was injured, her strength was still very, very extraordinary!

She gazed at him for a long time and replied, “Go figure!”

Yang Ye smiled and didn’t say anything else. He just turned around and left the wooden house.

After being in contact with her for some time, Yang Ye realized that while she had a terrible temper, she had principles that she adhered to. Moreover, if she wanted to kill him, she would have done so already. Based on her character, she would have absolutely done it.

Yang Ye had also realized that the woman in white was likely the reason why the woman in black didn’t kill him!

After all, to a certain extent, the woman in white was her too!

In the wooden house, the woman in black watched Yang Ye leave, and then she closed her eyes slowly.

Yang Ye went to Snowy high above in the clouds. At this moment, she was absolutely overjoyed.

Snowy hurriedly went over to Yang Ye upon noticing him, and then she passed the sword to him.

It was a completely new sword!

No, it should be described as an incomplete sword!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and took the sword, but just a moment later, his expression changed violently. He hurriedly released it, but it was too late.

A sword howl resounded, and then countless rays of sword energy sliced him.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

In an instant, Yang Ye’s entire body was covered in cuts!

Blood sprayed!

Snowy was utterly stunned. A moment later, she tossed the sword away and grabbed Yang Ye.

Yang Ye fell slowly from the sky. Snowy hurriedly pulled on Yang Ye’s ear and brought him to the wooden house.

The woman in black frowned when she saw Yang Ye and gazed at Snowy, “You let him use that sword?”

She nodded repeatedly while tears surged from her eyes.

Of course, they were not tears, it was an endless surge of spirit energy!

The woman’s face darkened, “Have you gone mad? You actually let him use that sword?!”

Snowy kept wiping away her tears with one paw and used the other to wave incessantly at the woman in black while a pleading expression filled her eyes.

At this moment, Yang Ye could truly be described as being on the verge of death!

His injuries were worse than when his bones had shattered earlier! If it wasn’t for the Primordial Violet Energy within him, he would be dead by now. But even with the help of Primordial Violet Energy, his aura was fading!

At this moment, Primordial Violet Energy couldn’t do much to heal him!

His injuries were too severe!

The woman in black glanced at Snowy, shook her head slightly, and then placed her hand on Yang Ye’s forehead. A moment later, a wave of mysterious profound energy rippled out from her palm, and it quickly enveloped Yang Ye’s body.

After that, Yang Ye started to recover rapidly!

Snowy heaved a sigh of relief, but the spirit energy tears in her eyes were still flowing incessantly.

The woman in black waved her right hand, and a sword shot in from outside. A moment later, a sword had appeared before her!

Snowy was furious when she saw the sword, and she flew over and kicked it!

The corners of the woman’s mouth twitched. When she noticed that Snowy planned to hit it again, she grabbed Snowy and brought Snowy before her, “It has nothing to do with the sword. Understand?”

Snowy pointed at the sword. She was furious. She waved her paws quickly to convey that she wanted to destroy that sword!

The sword actually feared Snowy a little and hid behind the woman in black.

The woman felt quite helpless. She gazed at Snowy, hesitated for a moment, and continued, “It has nothing to do with the sword, or you…”

She pointed at Yang Ye’s figure and continued, “It’s because he was too weak. He couldn’t endure this sword at all. Understand?”

Snowy blinked, and then she pointed at herself. She was saying that she’d been able to use it!

The woman in black glanced at Snowy, “That’s because you’re not human!”

Snowy frowned. She pointed at herself, and it was clear she was asking why she wasn’t a human!

The woman in black’s face darkened. She really wanted to beat someone up right now!

Luckily, Yang Ye coughed lightly at this moment. Snowy shuddered upon hearing him, and then she flew over to him, hugged his head, and kept rubbing her head on him!

The woman in black shook her head. How did this fellow become like this? That fellow from all those years ago was truly formidable.

Yang Ye opened his eyes slowly, and he cracked a smile upon seeing Snowy. He rubbed Snowy’s head and asked, “Why are you crying?”

Snowy just hugged him and kept rubbing her head on him!Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Yang Ye was at a loss for what to do.

Around two hours later, Yang Ye had almost fully recovered. He went to the wooden house, and there were three swords before the woman in the house.

The woman in black had split them up again!

Yang Ye sat before her, and Snowy was snoring on his shoulder.

Yang Ye glanced at the swords and asked, “Why?”

She smiled coldly, “Do you know why I split this sword all those years ago? Because it was too strong. Your current strength cannot endure it at all. You were lucky this time. If you’d reacted just a little slower, your body and soul would have been sliced to bits.”

Yang Ye glanced at the three swords and felt a wave of lingering fear. He remained silent for a moment and asked, “Why can Snowy use it?”

She replied coldly, “She isn’t human, she’s a sprite. She’s the greatest sprite of this world, and the kindest. All things do not reject her. So, it can be said that besides those absolutely evil existences, she can practically use all treasures.”

She glanced at Yang Ye and continued, “You can’t be compared with her!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly.

They couldn’t be compared!

It was true because all things in the world were strongly attracted to Snowy.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and asked, “Erya is an ancient beast of evil, the most evil type, right?”

The woman in black fell silent for a moment and replied, “Yes!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “A very, very long time ago, were Erya and Snowy close to each other?”

She gazed at her with slight anxiety.

She laughed coldly, “I’m sorry to disappoint you but they were like fire and water. They fought on sight of each other.

Yang Ye nodded but wasn’t very disappointed because he’d guessed her answer. But he felt it was fine. While they weren’t friends in the past, they were the best of friends now.

They were so close that they could share the same tanghulu!

He firmly believed that nothing in this world could destroy their friendship!

The woman in black said, “What is it? You seem a little happy!”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s nothing. Anyway, I’m almost fully recovered now, so I can go to that Destiny Dimension of yours!”

She replied indifferently, “Aren’t you afraid that I would kill you once I’ve recovered?”

Yang Ye smiled, “If you wanted to kill me, you can do it anytime, right?”

She glanced at him, “I didn’t expect you to know your strength so well.”

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled in silence.

At this moment, he realized that if he didn’t go against her, the woman in black was actually quite easy to talk to. Of course, it wouldn’t end well if anyone went against her!

She moved her gaze away, “Get to the Destiny Dimension!”

Yang Ye nodded and left. Meanwhile, she waved her right hand, and then Past Life and Heaven Executor flew over to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye would naturally not refuse them. He took them and left the Primordial Pagoda.

Outside the pagoda, Yang Ye shot forward on his sword. This time, nothing unexpected occurred.

An hour later, Yang Ye stopped.

He’d arrived!
