Chapter 2567

At this moment, Yang Ye had forgotten what Qi Bitian had said.

The owner of the Hell Sphere had only been able to injure her with it, and she’d annihilated that person with just one hand!

If Yang Ye still remembered those words, he would absolutely not act like this!

Unfortunately, he’d grown a little too overconfident right now!

At this moment, he felt invincible!

Qi Bitian glanced at Yang Ye, “I don’t want to lost my opponent in Gomoku!”

“Haha!” Yang Ye roared madly with laughter, and he laughed for a while before he looked at her, “Let’s fight!”

Bang!

As soon as he said that, an explosion resounded, and Yang Ye was blasted away. As for his Sword Domain Sphere and the sword intent and sword energy within it, all of them had instantly vanished without a trace!

Yang Ye flew extremely far away!

He flew all the way out of the Sword Sect!

At a mountain wall outside the Sword Sect, there was a pitch black hole there. A long time passed before a pair of hands emerged from it.

A short while later, a head emerged!

It was Yang Ye!

Just like that, Yang Ye crawled out slowly!

He was partially paralyzed!

At this moment, Yang Ye’s mind cleared up. He recalled what he’d done, and it was the first time he’d felt so stupid!

Absolutely stupid!

Yang Ye returned to the bamboo house, and Qi Bitian was still there.

She glanced at him and asked, “Shall we continue?”

Yang Ye quickly shook his head, “No, not at all.”

She walked over to him and spoke in a very serious manner, “You’re not weak, it’s I who am too strong. So, don’t feel dejected. After all, I even killed that guy from all those years ago with such ease!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened. Is she comforting me or threatening me?

Qi Bitian sat at the side and continued, “I was watching earlier, and it was really not bad. However, you haven’t mastered the technique, and you need that to use it in battle. Understand?”

Master it!

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand!”

Just as Qi Bitian had said, he wasn’t very skilled in using it, so he couldn’t unleash it in an instant. So, he had to continue training!

Painstakingly!

So, after that, while nothing occurred at the Ancient Sword Sect, Yang Ye remained training in the Primordial Pagoda.

…

In another world.

A woman stood on a vast river, and there was a young girl standing in the distance. She had a white and fluffy little fellow on her shoulder, and there were three huge ships in front of them.

Warships!

Three powerful warships!

Every one of these warships had a long flag on it, and there was a red circle on the flag.

Not too far away from the ships was an island!

The young girl stood on the ocean while wearing a strange thing on her head. The strange thing was making noises, and if one listened carefully, one would notice that the sounds of passion and fervor were coming from it…

She had a very good sense of rhythm as she stepped forward lightly, causing numerous ripples to undulate in all directions.

Meanwhile, the white and fluffy little fellow on her shoulder was wearing the same thing as the young girl. She kept blinking in a very rhythmic manner, and she was holding a rattle drum.

She shook it from time to time!

Thud! Thud! Thud!

Suddenly, a middle aged man in blue uniform appeared on the deck. The middle aged man was holding a black spyglass to observe the young girl.

When he saw her floating above the water, he was shocked and couldn’t believe his eyes. He hurriedly took another look, and a long time passed before he spoke softly, “Magic? Sorcery?”

The young girl shook her head and moved faster while humming from time to time, “The river flows east, the Big Dipper is the star to watch… When there’s injustice on my way, I roar and smash the dragon and ox to death…”

The little fellow on her shoulder kept shaking the rattle drum!

The middle aged man on the warship put his spyglass away and fell silent for a short while, and then he spoke in broken Chinese, “Must be Chinese tricks… Forget her, full speed ahead. This island is ours…”

After that, he stopped speaking in Chinese.

Meanwhile, the warships sped up toward the island!

…

Eternal Border. The desolate race.

In a hall, the Junior Patriarch of the desolate race, Huang Ying, sat before a desk, and there were numerous scrolls laid out on it.

Meanwhile, an ethereal figure suddenly appeared before him.

Huang Ying stopped and asked softly, “He refused?”

The ethereal figure nodded slightly, “As you expected, he didn’t leave, and he’s leading those sword cultivators against the Soul Sect!”

Huang Ying sighed softly and didn’t say anything.

The ethereal figure hesitated for a moment and said, “Junior Patriarch, according to the information we’ve collected, the Soul Sect isn’t ordinary at all, and they have formed an agreement with the other powers of Eternal Kingdom to fight our desolate race in the future.”

“Fight our desolate race?” Huang Ying shook his head and smiled, “That’s quite interesting.”

The ethereal figure replied solemnly, “You must not underestimate them.”

Huang Ying smiled, “Of course I won’t underestimate them or be careless! Right, have we figured out the strength of the Soul Sect?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The ethereal figure replied, “The strongest is their sect master. He's quite mysterious, and we can’t find out his true identity or origins. He possesses a Super Divine Treasure, the Soul Awl. If Yang Ye’s Executor is included, there are five known Super Divine Treasures in Eternal Kingdom. Yang Ye’s Executor cannot be considered as a true Super Divine Treasure, at the very least, it can’t until it’s fully unsealed. But the other four are true Super Divine Treasures. Moreover, besides Yang Ye’s Executor, all the other four may be pointed at our desolate race! So, we must take precautions!”

Huang Ying nodded slightly, “I understand. You may leave now!”

The ethereal figure bowed slightly and left. Meanwhile, Huang Ying added, “Once you return to Eternal Kingdom, pay attention to the Ancient Sword Sect and Brother Yang. Don’t refuse his requests.”

The ethereal figure hesitated for a moment and said, “Junior Patriarch, allow me to be honest. We shouldn’t interfere in this. Moreover, if we interfere, the situation will become worse for him once Eternal Kingdom finds out. At that time, they will have an excuse to openly attack him.”

Huang Ying fell silent for a long time and said, “Isn’t that good. The more chaotic it is over there, the more beneficial it will be for us!”

The ethereal figure was stunned, and then it cupped its hands and left.

Once the ethereal figure left, Huang Ying closed his eyes slowly, “Sorry, I’m Huang Ying, but I’m also the desolate race’s Junior Patriarch…”

…

Eternal Kingdom.

The Central Region.

The Central Region was the core of the Eternal Kingdom, and it was where the head of the divine vein resided. It was the most prosperous area in Eternal Kingdom, and it was the Xing Clan’s territory and where the Eternal Lord resided!

On this day, Xing Biqing went to the restricted area of the Xing Clan. Actually, the restricted area was just a vegetable garden.

Even the Xing Clan’s patriarch couldn’t visit this garden.

All sorts of fruits and vegetables were planted here.

A middle aged man was sprinkling fertilizer in the garden, and he grinned upon noticing Xing Biqing, “Wait a while. I’m almost done!”

Xing Biqing bowed slightly and stood respectfully at the side.

Around two hours later, the middle aged man led her into a small courtyard. He sat before a stone table and took a sip from the teacup on the table.

The middle aged man put down the cup and smiled, “While it isn’t top-rate tea, it was planted with my own hands, so it’s the best for me. It feels great to drink it!”

He gazed at Xing Biqing and continued, “You rarely come to visit me, so tell me. What is it?”

Xing Biqing sat before him, “Uncle, why are you letting the Soul Sect do as they please?”

He shook his head, “You’re wrong, I’m not.”

Xing Biqing glanced at him and spoke softly, “If they didn’t receive your permission, they wouldn’t dare to treat the Ancient Sword Sect like that.”

The middle aged man smiled, “Are you here for that kid?”

She spoke solemnly, “He’s a friend of mine!”

The middle aged man replied, “He’s been in the limelight lately. Right, I know a little about him. He is pretty good.”

She gazed at him and pleaded, “Uncle, can you spare him?”

The middle aged man smiled, “You still don’t understand. This world has its own rules, and there are some rules that we cannot violate. Once we do that, the rules will be lost, and this world will be in chaos. Just like when a wolf wants to eat some sheep, what would the wolf do if we tried to save the sheep? Let it starve to death? We can’t do that.”

He stood up slowly, “If we break the rules, this world will fall into chaos.”

Xing Biqing fell silent for a long time and said, “Uncle, are we really going to join in and split the Ancient Sword Sect with the others?”

The middle aged man glanced at her and said, “If the Ancient Sword Sect is more useful to us than the Soul Sect, then I will choose them. Just like when I suppressed the Soul Sect and prohibited them from emerging into the world. Yet now, the Soul Sect is more useful to us. So, I chose the Soul Sect.”

He looked up at the sky and continued, “The useful remains! Understand?”
