Chapter 373 – Abandoned!

When he spoke up to here, Yang Ye grinned and said, “So, I and these 100 plus brothers behind me won’t be heading down anymore!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye glanced at Mu Jun as well, and then he led the group behind him to the side.

The atmosphere here became slightly odd. Yang Ye and the profounders behind him refused to leave, but the number of human profounders here was too much. So, the profounders from the devil, nether, and demon race were naturally unwilling to see this happen.

However, there was a problem in front of them. That problem was whether they should drive Yang Ye’s group away or Mu Jun’s group!

In next to no time, Mo Ke and the others gazed at Mu Jun. Even though Mu Jun had comparatively more people on his side, only Mu Jun could be a threat to them. Moreover, Mu Jun was all alone! On the other hand, Yang Ye had Xi Luo and Ji Yanshi. Most importantly, Yang Ye had a group of assassins that were watching from the surroundings!

Mu Jun’s face fell when he noticed Mo Ke, Hun You, and the others looking at him. He hadn’t expected that Yang Ye would actually make such a move! The reason he’d stepped forward earlier wasn’t just to annoy Yang Ye, it was also because these human profounders behind him weren’t bad. After all, they’d survived the brutal battle from before. If he could annoy Yang Ye and bring these fellows under his control, then he was naturally extremely happy to do so!

So, he’s stood forward!

Yet now, he’d dug a hole and buried himself in it instead. Fight? That was absolutely impossible! He would naturally not fight desperately with his life on the line against the three races for these human profounders who stood behind him. His life was much more precious! Since he couldn’t fight them, then there was only one path left....

However, right at this moment, Mo Qingyu suddenly arrived at Mu Jun’s side. Mo Qingyu glanced at Yang Ye before she glanced at Mo Ke and Hun You. In the end, she gazed at Mu Jun and said, “Let’s form an alliance?”

Mu Jun was delighted when he heard this, and he said, “Of course!”

He wasn’t willing to fight Mo Ke, Hun You, and the others by himself. But it was different if the Sword Emperor joined his side as well. In other words, at this moment, the strength possessed by his group wasn’t inferior to any other group here!

Sure enough, Mo Ke and Hun You’s expressions turned gloomy. If it was just Mu Jun, then it wasn’t difficult to annihilate all the human profounders standing behind Mu Jun. But if Mo Qingyu was included, then it wasn’t that simple anymore!

“Forget about that!” Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s icy cold voice resounded, and then a strand of violet sword qi shot swiftly like a bolt of lightning towards Mo Qingyu.

Originally, Yang Ye hadn’t intended to attack her right now. But he had no choice because he was truly annoyed by how arrogantly she acted. Since he was annoyed, then it was best to just kill her. In any case, he was going to kill her, so it was better to get it done earlier!

A wisp of disdain flashed through Mo Qingyu’s eyes when she saw this strand of sword qi shoot swiftly towards her. Utilizing sword qi in front of me? Is this fellow’s intelligence getting lower and lower?

However, right at this moment, Mo Qingyu’s pupils suddenly constricted because Yang Ye who was originally standing in the distance had actually vanished on the spot, and he transformed into a black ray of light that shot explosively towards her!

He was too swift, and it was swift to the point that he’d instantly overtaken that strand of sword qi, and then a glowing tip of a sword suddenly arrived at her throat!

Mo Qingyu was shocked. When did his speed become so swift?

It was swift to the point that even Mo Qingyu who’d comprehended Wind Intent was on the verge of being unable to seem his movements clearly!

Even though she was shocked, Mo Qingyu’s reaction wasn’t slow at all. The tip of her right foot spun on the ground, and then a green vortex suddenly appeared from beneath her foot. After that, Mo Qingyu left a string of afterimages behind as she swiftly appeared over 30m away.

At the spot where Mo Qingyu stood just moments ago, Yang Ye flipped his palm, and the Dragonbone sword in his hand left a string of afterimages behind as he pointed it at Mo Qingyu. He said, “This is the so-called Sword Emperor? If the Sword Emperors of the past knew that the Sword Emperor of this era is actually such a piece of trash, I wonder if they would be humiliated to the point of rising from their graves!”

Killing intent flickered in Mo Qingyu’s eyes when she heard this. However, Yang Ye had already shot explosively towards her again.

“Since you want to die, then I’ll fulfill your wish!” Mo Qingyu shouted in a grim voice as her fair hand moved slightly. The ancient sheath floated in front of her before its tip pointed right towards Yang Ye. In the next moment, Mo Qingyu shouted once more. “Instant Death Sword!”

As soon as she finished speaking, the ancient sheath transformed into a ray of light that shot over like a bolt of lightning. It was so swift that Mo Ke and Hun You’s expressions changed, and even Luo Xue revealed a wisp of surprise.

The ancient sheath instantly struck Yang Ye’s stomach and easily broke through his skin before it shot violently into his body.

A wisp of delight couldn’t help but surge onto Mo Qingyu’s face when she witnessed this scene.

However, right at this moment, the ancient sheath suddenly stopped by itself, and then it transformed into a ray of light under the astounded gazes of everyone and withdrew from Yang Ye’s stomach. After that, it transformed into the form of a woman!

The ancient sheath’s spirit gazed at Yang Ye with astonishment, and her eyes were filled with shock. She said, “Who... who exactly are you!?”

Everyone in the surroundings was stunned!

Yang Ye’s heart shook. He knew that the ancient sheath’s spirit had noticed the tiny vortex. A wisp of icy cold killing intent flashed through the depths of Yang Ye’s eyes when he thought up to here. Knowledge of the tiny vortex had major implications, and if it was known to an outsider, then Yang Ye wouldn’t be able to survive even if he had 10 lives!

When he thought up to here, Yang Ye intended to attack. But the ancient sheath’s spirit suddenly said, “Impossible! How could it possibly be in your possession? It’s impossible! Impossible....”

Yang Ye frowned when he heard this. The ancient sheath’s spirit knows about the tiny vortex’s origins? Otherwise, why would she reveal such an expression? What exactly is the tiny vortex to actually be able to make the ancient sheath’s spirit lose her composure like this?

A string of questions was ceaselessly flickering through Yang Ye’s mind, yet he didn’t have a single answer!

After a short while, the ancient sheath’s spirit calmed down greatly, and then she turned around to gaze at Mo Qingyu while a wisp of a complicated expression appeared in her eyes. She said, “Qingyu, I’m sorry, but I’m unable to continue staying by your side. Because I noticed that you’re not suitable to be the Sword Emperor. The title of Sword Emperor should belong to an emperor of the sword!”

Everyone here was shocked once more!

What does she mean? Does the ancient sheath intend to leave its owner? No, it should be said that Mo Qingyu is about to be abandoned? A Sword Emperor that was abandoned by the ancient sheath had never occurred in the history of the continent!

After a brief moment of shock, Mo Qingyu’s expression became extremely unsightly. Being abandoned by the ancient sheath was absolutely like being struck by lightning under a clear sky to her, and it was a huge humiliation!

However, the ancient sheath’s spirit didn’t spare another glance at her. She turned around to look at Yang Ye before she said, “I know that you have a slightly bad impression of me, but if you have my assistance throughout your path of cultivation in the future, then you’ll definitely be able to become a peerless sword cultivator who surpasses the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor. Because I possess the sword techniques, comprehensions, experiences, and inheritances of all the Sword Emperors throughout the history of the continent!”

“You intend to choose me?” asked Yang Ye in a low voice.

The ancient sheath’s spirit nodded lightly and said, “You have the qualifications and the strength. You don’t have to use my strength because the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor never utilized my strength as well. He was willing to let me stay by his side merely because I possessed the sword techniques and experiences of all the past Sword Emperors!”

Yang Ye instantly felt slightly tempted because he really lacked knowledge related to the Sword Dao and sword techniques. If he was able to obtain the sword techniques, comprehensions, experience, and inheritance of all the past Sword Emperors, then it would definitely be extremely beneficial to him! However, Yang Ye was slightly worried, he was slightly worried because of the ancient sheath’s spirit!

“Why have you chosen me!?” asked Yang Ye in a low voice.

“Because of it!” The ancient sheath’s spirit said, “But it isn’t entirely because of it as well. After all, you’re more suitable to be the Sword Emperor, and I merely missed the opportunity to meet you before her!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

When he heard this, Yang Ye took a deep breath before he said, “Since it’s like that, then as you wish!”

He really didn’t want to give up on obtaining the sword techniques and inheritances of the past Sword Emperors. This was an opportunity to him; it was a superb opportunity for him to swiftly become an expert in the Sword Dao. He really didn’t want to give up this chance, even if he slightly disliked the ancient sheath’s spirit!

The ancient sheath’s spirit was delighted when she heard Yang Ye, and then she transformed into the ancient sheathe and floated in front of Yang Ye.

The expression of the faces of Mo Ke, Hun You, and the others became unsightly when they witnessed this scene. Yang Ye’s strength was already formidable, and now that he’d obtained the ancient sheathe and became the Sword Emperor, it was undoubtedly like a tiger that had grown wings. It would become even difficult for them to kill him!

Of course, Mo Qingyu’s expression was even more unsightly. The ancient sheath had abandoned her and even chosen her mortal enemy. How could she possibly accept this?

“AH!!” A hysterical and furious howl resounded as a green vortex instantly enveloped Mo Qingyu. At the same time, almost a thousand green energy swords suddenly floated up into appearance around her!

“Yang Ye! I’ll never rest until I kill you!” A savage voice resounded from within the green vortex.
