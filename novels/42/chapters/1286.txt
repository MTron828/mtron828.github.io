Chapter 1287 – You’re Too Cold!

“Calm down!” Qian Lankong obstructed Yang Ye’s path, “You’ll die if you try that right now. Understand?”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She replied, “There are forces guarding the mountain range, the guardians of the human race in the Veiled Region. Do you know of the guardians?”

Yang Ye frowned, “The guardians?”

Qian Lankong explained, “The guardians are a clan that the human race jointly fostered all those years ago. It guards Heaven Pillar Mountain Range forever. Firstly, it is to guard the sealing barrier there, and secondly, it’s to defend the human race against the demon race. Even though I don’t know how strong they are, they are definitely extremely strong. Because numerous formidable cultivation techniques and combat techniques of the human race were left to that clan. Moreover, there are around 5 Divine Grade spirit veins there.”

Yang Ye said, “You don’t know how strong they are?”

She nodded, “Because their ancestors made a solemn oath that the descendants of that clan are prohibited from leaving Heaven Pillar Mountain Range. As for the reason, I don’t know. However, I have no doubt that it’s extremely strong. At the very least, it isn’t inferior to the Yuan Clan. Because every few years, the younger generation of the 3 sects and 6 cities would head to Heaven Pillar Mountain Range to challenge the geniuses of that clan. However, they’ve never won throughout history!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “What a pity.”

Qian Lankong suddenly walked over to Yang Ye, and she looked him in the eyes, “Do you realize that if you destroy the barrier there and the demon race attacks the human race, then our human race will face calamity? Many will die in a war between the races.”

“What does that have to do with me?” Yang Ye met her gaze and said, “It’s fine so long as the members of my Sword Alliance are alive.”

She looked at him for a long time before she spoke, “You’re too cold-blooded.”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Cold-blooded? Alright, I admit it. But let me ask you something. Would you think the people in the Veiled Region are cold-blooded if they crush my Sword Alliance? Would you? You wouldn’t, right?”

“That’s different!” She said, “The Sword Alliance and Veiled Region both consist of humans. It’s a fight between humans. But if you destroy the barrier, you would be drawing the demon race over to slaughter the human race. Such actions are actions against humanity, and they are disgraceful. Because you’re a woman. A person can be selfish and cold-blooded, but....”

Yang Ye waved his hand and interrupted her, “Let me ask you something else, If they have the chance to make the demon race deal with my Sword Alliance, then do you think the Yuan Clan and those other powers would give up on such an opportunity? They won’t, right? Besides that, if the Slayer Pavilion’s master was still alive, and you had the opportunity to make the demon raise kill him and take revenge, would you give up on such an opportunity? Would you?”

Qian Lankong gazed at him in silence.

Yang Ye continued, “One shouldn’t live by 2 different sets of standards. You can’t do it, yet you want others to. Such people are the most disgraceful. Besides that, it doesn’t matter if it’s the demon race or human race, I treat them all equally. I’m willing to be friends with humans, but I’m also willing to be friends with demons. If the demons want to kill me, then I’ll kill them; if the humans want to kill me, then I’ll kill them as well. I’m sorry, but I don’t have that sense of righteousness to sacrifice myself for the sake of the human race.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

A wisp of ridicule arose on the corners of her mouth, “If you’re selfish, then admit it. Why make it sound like you’re so honorable and noble? While both of you are sword cultivators with extraordinary natural talent, your character is much inferior to Senior Jian Wuji.”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a short while and said, “You’re right. I, Yang Ye, am a selfish person. But that doesn’t have anything to do with you, right?”

Qian Lankong replied, “I’ll definitely stop you if you try to destroy the barrier there!”

Yang Ye replied, “If that day really does come, then no one would be able to stop me, including you.”

They gazed at each other and the atmosphere here became slightly heavy.

A short while passed before Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and spoke indifferently, “Miss Qian, we’re working together. You don’t have the right to talk about my character, and I don’t have the right to talk about you. Because none of us are noble. Even you are, I don’t need you to teach me or ridicule me. As for what you said about stopping me, if that day really comes, then we’ll decide it based on our strength. If you’re strong, you can kill me; if I’m strong, I’ll kill you. It’s just that simple.”

She gazed at him for a short while before she nodded, “You’re right. Both of us aren’t noble, so we don’t have the right to talk about each other. But if you really dare to destroy the barrier, then I’ll definitely stop you, even if I die.”

Yang Ye shrugged, “I’m willing to exchange my life for the lives of some, but when it comes to many, and especially my enemies, I wouldn’t stop no matter how many I have to kill.”

Qian Lankong took a deep and long glance at him before walking forward, “Let’s go to Darkness City, the Slayer Pavilion’s headquarters is there. We have to recall all the members of the Slayer Pavilion because the Yuan Clan and those other powers have already started acting against Darkness City.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “You make the decisions for now.” As soon as he finished speaking, he hurriedly followed her.

Because of what happened earlier, they didn’t speak anymore, and it didn’t take long for them to arrive at Darkness City.

They’d only just entered the city when Yang Ye sensed a few divine senses sweep towards him.

Qian Lankong said, “It’s our own people. This city is in our control, and everyone who enters will be noticed by us.”

Yang Ye nodded. Qian Lankong led him to an extremely ordinary stone house. The stone house was completely empty, and there was only a single pathway that led underground. Yang Ye walked down there with her. All along the way, there were divine senses sweeping them incessantly.

Around 15 minutes later, a palace appeared within Yang Ye’s field of vision.

An underground palace!

There was an underground palace below the stone house, but it wasn’t very large. It only covered an area of a few km. It was completely pitch black, and coupled with the dim lighting in the surroundings, it seemed quite gloomy.

Yang Ye noticed that Qian Lankong who was walking in front of him had moved behind him now, and Yang Ye naturally understood why.

Meanwhile, a dozen black clothed figures walked out of the palace. Yang Ye glanced at them. There were both men and women amongst them, all of them were wearing masks. Moreover, there were all Emperors with thick and deep auras. They were clearly Emperors who’d worked hard to gain their current cultivation.

The 12 black clothed figures walked over to Yang Ye and bowed respectfully before speaking in unison, “Pavilion Master!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, and then he started walking towards the palace. Actually, it wasn’t very difficult for him to pose as the master of Slayer Pavilion. Because the master of Slayer Pavilion had never shown his face. Coupled with Qian Lankong’s cooperation, would anyone dare to say that he wasn’t the pavilion master! But he still didn’t dare act carelessly. After all, it was never wrong to be safe!

Qian Lankong and the others hurriedly followed behind him.

Yang Ye walking ahead as Qian Lankong’s voice resounded abruptly in his mind, “They are the Hall Masters of Slayer Pavilion, and their status is merely inferior to Feng Qiansha and I. Controlling them is equivalent to controlling the entire pavilion. Because they manage many things throughout the pavilion. Of course, their presence isn’t necessary, and you can just choose new hall masters. But it would be very troublesome.”

Yang Ye nodded lightly. Once he walked into the hall, he immediately went over to the end of the hall and sat at the armchair there.

Meanwhile, a black clothed figure stepped forward and said, “Pavilion Master, the clans and sects led by the Yuan Clan have been repeatedly attacking us for some reason. We’ve lost over a dozen Emperors and over 100 Saints.”

Qian Lankong’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “He’s Hall Master Zhao.”

Yang Ye’s expression remained calm as he said, “Hall Master Zhao, order everyone to hide for now and await my command. Besides that, send our forces to watch those sects and cities.”

It was naturally not the time to go to war with the Yuan Clan and the other powers. Because he still hadn’t gained full control over Slayer Pavilion. Moreover, he didn’t have a clear understanding of the resources and reserves possessed by those clans and sects. So, the important matter at hand was to gain full control over Slayer Pavilion.

“Understood!” Hall Master Zhao bowed slightly to Yang Ye and moved aside.

Yang Ye nodded to himself when he saw that. As expected of a trained assassin. He didn’t ask questions when an order was given, and he just executed it! If it was the Sword Alliance, while no one would go against me, there would definitely be people who ask for a reason.

However, all of that couldn’t be helped because the Sword Alliance had just been established, so it naturally couldn’t be in such an orderly state as the Slayer Pavilion.

Yang Ye glanced at the others and said, “From this moment onwards, besides the Lin Clan and the Sky Wave Sect, all the other 3 sects and 6 cities are enemies of our Slayer Pavilion. Gather every single bit of information about them and pay constant attention to their movements. Especially the Yuan Clan, attach most importance to it. Understand?”

All of them nodded, but Yang Ye frowned because he noticed that 1 out of the 12 hadn’t nodded. His gaze descended onto that black clothed figure. Based on the outward appearance of that person’s figure, it was a female.

Meanwhile, that black clothed woman stepped forward.

Qian Lankong’s voice appeared in Yang Ye’s mind again and warned, “Shui Linlang, someone the pavilion master personally brought to Slayer Pavilion. Be careful. She might have noticed something.”

Yang Ye nodded imperceptibly before his gaze descended onto Shui Linlang, “You have something to say?”

“Of course I do!” She looked straight at him, “I have a tiny question. Our Slayer Pavilion accepted a job from the Yuan Clan and the other powers to assassinate that fellow, Yang Ye. It can be said that we’re temporarily working together with them. So, what puzzles me is why the Yuan Clan and those other powers have suddenly acted against our Slayer Pavilion.”

Yang Ye took a step forward and a wave of pressure suddenly appeared here, “You want me to give you an explanation?”

She gazed at Yang Ye for a short while before she said, “Why keep the act up? You’re not the pavilion master!”

As soon as she finished speaking, a terrifying aura surged out from within her.

The aura of a Voider!

Everyone in the hall was shocked!
