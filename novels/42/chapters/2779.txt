Chapter 2780 – She Isn’t the Same!

Along with the arrival of Justice, the surroundings instantly fell silent.

And when they saw the woman in white ignite her soul, the shadow and the others shot backward. It was obvious that they were very fearful.

Yang Ye was shocked and immediately used the Sword Domain to forcefully suppress the flames around her!

She glanced at him, and then she looked up at Justice. A moment later, she shot up into the air while the flames around her gradually vanished.

Everyone looked up.

Justice suddenly shot down from above.

A moment later, two rays of sword energy slammed against each other like shooting stars.

Boom!

Countless rays of sword energy rippled through the space above them, and they shot backward. The sword energy there was truly too terrifying.

But in just a moment, the area calmed down, and then a woman’s figure descended from above!

It was the woman in white!

Blood sprayed like a fountain from her back.

Meanwhile, Justice was descending just around 300m above her head.

Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly charged over to the woman in white. He wrapped his right arm around her waist and sent her into the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye swiftly looked up, and he saw Justice above him!

Yang Ye twisted his neck, and then a black sword appeared in his grasp!

Burial was the bane of Destiny’s swords!

This time, he wanted to see if it had the same effect on Justice!

Yang Ye stomped his right foot down.

Boom!

The space beneath him collapsed!

Meanwhile, he shot up into the sky with sword in hand.

Yang Ye’s sword stabbed against the tip of Justice.

A head-on collision!

As soon as they collided, an ear-piercing sound of collision resounded. It was so sharp that the others’ felt a sharp pain in their eardrums, and Yang Ye even bled from all seven apertures!

Crack!

Suddenly, a clear and resounding sound of something cracking resounded.

The sword had cracked open!

Everyone gazed at the swords. Jian Wudi and the others’ faces instantly turned gloomy.

Because it was Burial that had cracked!

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted from above. Justice didn’t follow up with another attack and just vanished into the sky.

Jian Wudi and the others hurriedly went over to catch Yang Ye. At this moment, his body was covered in injuries, and they seemed like they had cut Yang Ye open.

The shadow would naturally not give up such an opportunity, and he was about to attack when a powerful aura suddenly assaulted him from the right.

The shadow looked to the side, and a figure appeared before him. At the same time, a fist was already descending toward his head.

The shadow clenched his fist and swung a punch as well!

Boom!

The figures immediately split apart upon colliding with each other!

A woman had appeared before the shadow, Yang Busi!

The shadow spoke ferociously when he saw her, “Dammit!”

Since the strongest form of Destiny had interfered earlier, it was the perfect opportunity for him to deal with Yang Ye and Universe City, but he hadn’t expected Yang Busi to appear!𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Suddenly, a voice suddenly resounded from the space before him, “Retreat quickly!”

It was the mysterious expert!

The shadow’s hesitation instantly vanished, and he vanished on the spot with the others.

They vanished in an instant!

Yang Busi didn’t give chase and just glanced at her fist. It was scorched black. She looked into the distance, fell silent for a short while, and then gazed at An Nanjing and the others, “He isn’t ordinary. Tell that kid to recuperate quickly.”

She vanished into the distance once she finished speaking.

Meanwhile, the battle between Tian Xiu, Qi Bitian, and the mysterious expert’s group had come to a stop.

Or to be more precise, Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu had escaped their encirclement!

That was why the mysterious expert had told the shadow to retreat immediately. Because once these two women rushed over, then coupled with Yang Busi, they practically had no chance to win!

So, they’d retreated decisively!

In the starry sky, the mysterious expert looked into the distance, and no one knew what he was thinking.

Suddenly, Shu Wubian said, “They are too strong. If you don’t reveal your true strength, then all of us have no chance against them!”

The mysterious expert spoke softly, “I was merely trying to keep them busy. I never planned to kill them! Even Yang Ye isn’t someone I wish to kill unless I have no other choice!”

Shu Wubian was quite puzzled, “Why?”

Zuo Mu and the others gazed at him as well.

The mysterious expert replied indifferently, “Don’t forget that while we are their enemy, Destiny is their enemy too. Sooner or later, they will fight Destiny.”

Zuo Mu suddenly asked, “Why don’t we join forces?”

The mysterious expert shook his head, “We’re not the same kind of people, and I need the Good Sprite!”

Zuo Mu spoke solemnly, “Give up the Good Sprite, join forces with them, and we will definitely be able to fight Destiny.”

Yang Ye wasn’t alone, he had the entire Three Dimensional Universe, and he even had the help of experts like Tian Xiu and Qi Bitian. It could be said that if they joined forces with Yang Ye, fighting Destiny wouldn’t be impossible!

The mysterious expert shook his head and smiled, “You’re oversimplifying things.”

He pointed above him, “If we join forces with Yang Ye right now, the outcome would be that she would descend from the clouds and everyone will die.”

Zuo Mu asked, “We can’t fight her?”

The mysterious expert replied indifferently, “Do you know who that shadow is? His name is Monarch Yan. If we compare him to the realms of cultivation in our Three Dimensional Universe, then he is truly at the Destiny Transcendence Realm, and he’s even at the peak of it. However, throughout these countless years, he still has been completely suppressed by that woman. Up until this point, his main body doesn’t dare to leave the Four Dimensional Universe. Even during my prime…”

Shu Wubian spoke solemnly, “Then are we supposed to just let this go on?”

The mysterious expert shook his head, “Wait, wait for a perfect opportunity!”

Emperor Li asked solemnly, “When will that be?”

The mysterious expert replied softly, “We, Yang Ye’s group, the Four Dimensional Universe’s group… It depends which side can’t help but fight her first.”

As he spoke, he looked up at the starry sky, “If I’m not wrong, no matter what she’s planning, the time for it is almost here. She may be waiting for the God Sprite… That should be it. Since the very beginning, she has been forcing the Good Sprite and Evil Beast to grow. As she wanted, the Evil Beast has recovered almost 80% of her previous strength. As for the Good Sprite, I think it won’t be long from now. Once they have fully recovered, everything will come to an end.”

Shu Wubian spoke solemnly, “She took my main body, she took the cores of Yin and Yang, and the hearts of the heavens and the earth… Now, she wants the good and evil of this world. What is she trying to do?”

The mysterious expert crossed his arms before him, “We’ll find out once the Good Sprite and Evil Beast fully recover.”

Meanwhile, the shadow suddenly appeared before them.

The shadow spoke solemnly, “All of you couldn’t stop those few women?”

The mysterious expert shook his head, “It’s pointless to say that. Come on, let’s look for a place to discuss our future plans!”

He led the others away once he finished speaking.

The shadow fell silent for a long time, and then he followed them.

Universe City.

At this moment, Universe City had regained its peace and calm, but the atmosphere in the city was extremely heavy.

Because Yang Ye’s fate was unknown!

Some were even spreading the fact that Yang Ye was dead!

It could be said that the entire city had started to panic again.

Over 20 Destiny Realm experts were standing outside the hall.

They were led by Jian Wudi!

At this moment, all of them were waiting!

Of course, they had solemn expressions on their faces too. Because once they received news that Yang Ye was really dead, the entire city would instantly split apart!

Universe City was only stable while Yang Ye remained alive!

The hall was empty.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye laid there on the Ascension Platform, Snowy, Su Qingshi, and all the others were by his side.

The woman in white was lying not too far away to Yang Ye’s right.

Countless strands of Primordial Violet Energy surrounded Yang Ye. Besides that, there was Polaris Energy and various other spirit energies.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye’s injuries to start healing slowly with their help.

However, it was very slow!

It was completely different from how quickly he usually healed!

Of course, unlike before, these injuries had been caused by Justice.

The others heaved sighs of relief when they saw Yang Ye’s injuries healing.

Ding Shaoyao heaved a sigh of relief in her heart as well. Because many were waiting for news on Yang Ye’s condition. She didn’t dare to imagine what would happen to Universe City if Yang Ye perished!

Fortunately, he was awake now!

Yang Ye opened his eyes. Snowy immediately pounced on him. She wrapped her paws around his neck and kept rubbing her head against his chin.

Yang Ye cracked a smile, “Little fellow!”

He stood up slowly with Snowy in his arms.

He glanced at the others and smiled, “I’m sorry for making you worry!”

Su Qingshi shook her head slightly, “All that matters is that you’re alright!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he glanced at the injuries throughout his body!

Yang Ye’s face gradually turned solemn, “What a powerful sword!”

When he went head-on against Justice, he realized that her strength was much more terrifying than he’d imagined!

However, he’d gained a lot from the collision.

He’d discovered a new direction in the Sword Dao after going head-on against her attack.

As they say, every defeat was an opportunity to grow by discovering one’s own flaws. And being defeated by Destiny gave him even greater enlightenment.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at the woman in white, “Is she alright?”

The woman in white opened her eyes and looked up with bewilderment.

The others didn’t speak.

A short while later, the woman in white spoke softly, “She really dared to kill me… She isn’t the same person anymore, and she isn’t the person I used to be.”
