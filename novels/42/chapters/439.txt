Chapter 440 – A Vessel Without Life!

Right at this moment, the Beast Emperor appeared here, and he felt quite speechless at this moment. He knew that Yang Ye would definitely stop at nothing to save his mother upon descending down Passionless Cliff, and then it would definitely alarm the Flower Palace. As expected, Yang Ye really had alarmed the Flower Palace, and trouble had arrived now!

“You’re Yang Ye!” The woman glanced at the Beast Emperor before her gaze descended onto Yang Ye.

“Yes!” Yang Ye looked straight back at her. No matter what, he was going to rescue his mother today!

“Ye’er, don’t be rude. This is mother’s Martial Ancestor.” Meanwhile, Feng Yu suddenly spoke softly to Yang Ye, and then she walked over to the woman and was about to bow to the woman.

However, right at this moment, Yang Ye hurriedly stopped her and said, “Mother, what are you talking about? Is there any Martial Ancestor in this world who doesn’t rescue one of their own? She isn’t worthy of your respect!”

Feng Yu shook her head and said, “If it wasn’t for Martial Ancestor’s presence in the Flower Palace, then I would have been put to death by dismemberment on the day I was brought back to the Flower Palace, and then my soul would be caged. Moreover, it was mother who disappointed the high hopes both Martial Ancestor and Master had for mother all those years ago. It was mother who failed them, and they don’t owe me anything!” As soon as she finished speaking, Feng Yu had started to lower her body slowly.

Right when she was about to kneel down, a gentle gust of wind blew on her and caused her body to be unable to drop down.

“You’re not a disciple of the Flower Palace anymore, and both I and your master have cut all ties with you on that day, so you don’t have to kneel before me!” said the woman.

Feng Yu smiled bitterly and didn’t insist.

Meanwhile, the woman’s gaze suddenly shot towards Yang Ye as she said, “It really is as the rumors said. You’re an extraordinary genius in the Sword Dao. You’ve actually attained the Enlightened Sword Heart and comprehended Slaughter Sword Intent at such a young age. The rarest of it all is that your foundation is so solid, and you even seized the 1st on the Hidden Dragon Rankings for the southern territory. Feng Yu really gave birth to a good son!”

As soon as she finished speaking, the woman shook her head and gazed at the Beast Emperor before she said, “Beast Emperor, I don’t understand why you would help him. Can you explain it to me?”

The Beast Emperor shook his head and said, “Qian Nianci, it’s all over. If this disciple of your disciple hadn’t been tortured by the Flower Palace to such an extent, then perhaps I would tell you the reason and allow your Flower Palace to let bygone be bygones with him. Unfortunately, it’s all over. It’s really over. Qian Nianci, I can say with certainty that it’ll take 100 years at most, or even sooner. At that time, your Flower Palace will definitely vanish from this world!”

The woman’s eyes narrowed slightly, and she was just about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly gazed at the Beast Emperor and said, “Senior, what did you mean when you said everything is over!?”

The Beast Emperor pondered deeply for a moment, and then he shook his head and fell silent.

Yang Ye intended to continue asking about it, but the woman suddenly said, “Go on and leave!”

Yang Ye was stunned. She actually intends to let us leave? What’s the meaning of this? Right when Yang Ye was puzzled and bewildered, the woman glanced at Feng Yu before her figure trembled slightly and vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye gazed at the Beast Emperor with the hopes of obtaining an answer.

“Ye’er, let’s go!” Meanwhile, Feng Yu suddenly pulled on Yang Ye’s hand and said, “Mother misses Little Yao. Take mother to see her, alright?”

Yang Ye suppressed the questions and the bad premonition that arose in his heart just now, and then he nodded and said, “Come, let’s go home!”

After the three of them left, three women in palace clothes appeared at Passionless Cliff.

“Qian Nianci, you shouldn’t have let them go!” One of the women had a displeased expression on her face as she gazed at Qian Nianci. If Qian Nianci hadn’t stopped them just now, then they the three of them would have been entirely capable of annihilating Yang Ye and his mother even in the Beast Emperor’s presence.

“Qian Hui, what’s the point of making a move against them now?” Qian Nianci said flatly, “Even though Feng Yu is a disciple from my line of disciples, she violated the rules of the palace, so I’ve been already fulfilled my duty by keeping her alive until now. The reason I let her go isn’t out of consideration for past ties, and it’s instead because it isn’t necessary for us to fight the Beast Emperor to the death right now!”

“Fight the Beast Emperor to the death? I don’t think so!” Qian Hui grunted coldly and said, “I don’t know why the Beast Emperor was helping them, but I don’t think we would fight us to the death for their sakes. I don’t believe that Yang Ye is capable of producing something that would make the Beast Emperor risk everything and enter into war with our Flower Palace!”

Qian Nianci shook her head and said, “Since the Beast Emperor only intended to help Yang Ye rescue his mother, then we should just let him. Our Flower Palace is facing a great enemy right now, and we really can’t make a single mistake. Moreover, it’s just as the Beast Emperor said, it’s meaningless even if they rescued her now!”

Qian Hui pondered deeply for a moment before a cold glow flashed through her eyes. She said, “But that fellow, Yang Ye, must die. His natural talent in the Sword Dao is comparable to the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor, and he’ll definitely become a formidable enemy of our Flower Palace if he’s given the time to grow.”

“He doesn’t have a chance anymore!” It was the woman who stood between Qian Hui and Qian Nianci who spoke these words. “Both of you aren’t wrong. We shouldn’t become enemies with the Beast Emperor right now, even if our Flower Palace isn’t afraid of him! Of course, we can’t just let this matter go as well. Once we annihilate the Grand Qin Empire, we’ll head to the Grand Myriad Mountains to get even with him! As for that fellow, Yang Ye, we’ll let him life for some time! No matter how great his natural talent is, he’s only at the Spirit Realm, and it’s extremely easy to kill him!”

When they heard the woman, Qian Hui and Qian Nianci didn’t voice their views again, and they just nodded to display their agreement. Obviously, this woman was the leader of the group.

The woman suddenly said, “Who did the Grand Qin Empire send to lead the attack against our Flower Palace!?”

“Bai Qi and Li Si!” Qian Hui said in a low voice, “They stepped into the Monarch Realm not long ago, and they both have Dao Artifacts in their possession. They are very difficult to deal with!”

The woman’s eyes narrowed slightly upon hearing this, and then a wisp of a solemn expression flashed within them. The two of them were naturally not unfamiliar to her. They were the true trusted subordinates of the Founding Emperor! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qian Hui grunted coldly and said, “The Founding Emperor really thinks highly of our Flower Palace by sending the two of them here! He’s really mistaken if he thinks he can annihilate our Flower Palace. This time, our Flower Palace will definitely annihilate all those dogs of the empire. I really look forward to seeing what sort of expression the Founding Ancestor would have when Li Si, Bai Qi, and all those troops die at our Flower Palace!”

“We absolutely can’t be careless!” The woman said in a low voice, “I don’t believe that the Founding Ancestor can’t see through the intentions of the other four sects and us. Since he has chosen to attack after seeing through it, then it’s clearly that he’s confident in his ability just like we are. Even though I don’t know where he gets his confidence from or what sort of trump card he possesses, it’s best for us to be careful and not act carelessly!”

Qian Hui puckered her lips yet didn’t retort. She just nodded unwillingly while she said in her heart, Martial Ancestor is getting more and more cowardly as she ages. What happened to Fairy Qian, Qian Huagu, who dared to kill the disciples of the Origin School and dared to talk back to Master?

With the Beast Emperor’s help, Yang Ye didn’t spend too much time to arrive at the Grand Qin Empire. Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief when he didn’t notice anyone from the Flower Palace pursuing them all along the way, and he’d decided that once he saw Little Yao, he would take her along and leave the southern territory with their mother. Of course, he would bring Su Qingshi and Qin Xiyue along as well....

He really didn’t want to participate in all of this chaos within the southern territory. Since the very beginning, all he’d wanted was to be united with his family. So, when he thought about the days he would have in the future, an unprecedented smile of happiness couldn’t help but arise on his face.

Right when he was about to enter the Imperial Capital, Feng Yu who he carried on his back spoke abruptly. “Ye’er, how long more before we see Yao’er?”

“Very soon!” Yang Ye hurriedly said, “We’ve arrived at the Imperial Capital, and she’s at the Talisman Master’s Association in the Imperial Capital. My Master, Lin Shan, is there with her, so no one in the Imperial Capital would dare to bully her!”

“There isn’t enough time!” Feng Yu shook her head and said, “Ye’er, put me down. I have some things to tell you!”

Yang Ye stopped moving when he heard her, and then a strand of fear suddenly arose in his heart, and then it instantly suffused his entire body. Yang Ye suppressed the feeling in his heart and squeezed out a smile as he said, “Mother, what do you there isn’t enough time. You’re already fine. You’re fine. We’ll be able to see Little Yao soon....”

As he spoke, Yang Ye’s tears couldn’t help but start flowing for some unknown reason....

Feng Yu stretched out her hand to wipe off the tears on his face and said softly, “I’ve been keeping it from you, but Mother is actually dead.”

“What do you mean!?” Yang Ye was in a slight state of confusion. “Mother, you’re clearly alive and well. How could you possibly be dead?”

“She really is dead!” The Beast Emperor suddenly appeared here.

“Senior, what do you mean?” Yang Ye’s gaze was slightly hostile, and his voice carried an enraged tone.

“There’s no vitality within her body, and even her soul was condensed into form by force. Even though she seems like she’s alive, it’s only an illusion. Because there’s Death Energy within her. Once that secret technique that converged her soul disperses, then she’ll become a true member of the dead. Moreover, her soul would disperse completely, and she’ll be unable to enter the cycle of reincarnation! Hah! The Flower Palace is truly cruel! Not only did they kill her, they even refused to give her the chance to be reincarnated!” said the Beast Emperor.

“Senior, you’re really formidable!” said Feng Yu.

The Beast Emperor shook his head, and then stood silently at the side.

Feng Yu stroked Yang Ye’s cheek and said, “The Flower Palace adhered strictly to its rules, and they won’t allow anyone that breaks the rules to live. Don’t avenge me. At the very least, don’t try to avenge me before you possess sufficient strength. Understand? I’m already very satisfied to have been able to see you. Even if my soul disperses, I’m still very satisfied!”

“No! No!” Yang Ye shook his head while pain covered his face, and he said, “I won’t let you die! I won’t! I’ll definitely be able to save you! Let’s go see Little Yao! Our family will be together! No one will be able to split us up again! No one!”

Yang Ye gazed at the Beast Emperor and spoke anxiously. “Senior, since you’re aware of the Flower Palace’s secret technique, then you should know how to remove it, right? Right?”

The Beast Emperor shook his head and said, “It’s useless even if I do. Because her soul has dispersed and removing the secret technique will only make her soul vanish immediately. Of course, it’s the same even if it isn’t removed. There’s Death Energy within her body. In other words, the world has taken her to be one of the dead. Can anyone in this world defy the heavens and change the fate of someone?”
