Chapter 706 – If You’ve Slapped One Cheek, Then Slap The Other!

It was an insult!

When had Qian Mei even been insulted like that? Moreover, it was even in public.

So, a savage expression instantly appeared on her face, and she said, “Ye Yang! I’ll kill you!” She was about to attack while she shouted.

However, Xiaoman who stood by Yang Ye’s side suddenly acted, and a red hammer arrived above Qian Mei’s head before she could even attack Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Qian Yan acted decisively when he saw Xiaoman move, but Tong Fen obstructed him right away.

The atmosphere here suddenly became tense!

Yang Ye chuckled, restrained his smile, and spoke seriously, “Actually, there’s isn’t any great enmity between us. Unfortunately, you’ve acted against me time after time, and you even intended to kill me. I’m a man who doesn’t offend unless offended. So since you’ve offended me, then I have no choice but to show no mercy.”

As he spoke, Yang Ye raised his hand and slapped Qian Mei on the right cheek.

The spectators gasped. He actually dared to slap her!

After all, Qian Mei’s grandfather was an elder of the Fire Spirit Race and a Half-Saint!

Is he not afraid of death?

Qian Mei seemed as if she’d been petrified. He actually dared to slap him? Slap me? Even grandfather has never laid a hand on me!

Once she recovered from her shock, Qian Mei instantly seemed as if she’d gone mad, and she disregarded the hammer above her and intended to stop at nothing to tear Yang Ye into pieces.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Just hitting the right isn’t fair, and it doesn’t look nice.” As he spoke and while Qian Mei was just about to attack, Yang Ye swung his palm against Qian Mei’s left cheek.

This time, Yang Ye seemed to have used a huge amount of strength, and Qian Mei was blasted flying.

“You’re courting death!” Qian Yan roared furiously as he slapped his palm towards Yang Ye.

Tong Fen stood before Yang Ye and slapped his palm forward as well. An enormous explosion resounded from the collision while the space in that area instantly collapsed, and then a pitch black spatial rift swiftly swept towards the surroundings.

The others in the surroundings were horrified by the sight of it, and they hurriedly shot backwards. After all, they would definitely be unable to escape death if they were sucked into the spatial rift!

Fortunately, the Grand Elder acted. He waved his right hand lightly, and then the spreading spatial rift was instantly frozen on the spot, and merely an instant passed before it was completely repaired by the energy of the Laws.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly while a wisp of solemness flashed through his eyes. The Grand Elder is very formidable. At the very least, he’s much stronger than Xuan Ming!“This ends right now. Alright?” The Grand Elder glanced at Qian Yan and Tong Fen before his gaze descended onto Yang Ye in the end.

“Of course!” Yang Ye smiled, “I’m a man. How could I possibly make a fuss about it with a woman?”

The mouths of the others twitched. You realize you’re a man now? Why didn’t you remember that when you hit her just now? Even though they thought like that, not a single one of them stepped forward to criticize him again.

At this moment, they noticed that this fellow, Ye Yang, was a madman. A madman who didn’t think things through at all. So, offending him would make them suffer a fate that was worse than Ao Xieyun and Qian Mei. Of course, most importantly, they’d realized that the Grand Elder intended to protect him....

The Grand Elder glanced at Yang Ye before he withdrew his gaze, and he said, “Since it’s like that, then let’s just leave it at that. Those who intend to continue attending the marriage ceremony can stay behind, and the rest can leave.”

“Grand Elder, could it be that my granddaughter was struck for nothing?” Meanwhile, Qian Yan spoke in a low voice.

The Grand Elder replied, “Since you feel like that, then your granddaughter can slap Ye Yang twice as well. However, she must fulfill the conditions of the bet. Alright?”

“Looks like you intend to protect that human!” said Qian Yan.

The Grand Elder said, “Qian Yan, there needs to be reason when doing anything within our race. You’ve lost, so you must pay a price. If Ye Yang lost, he would have to pay a price as well. Understand?”

Qian Yan fell silent for a while before he smiled, “Good! Very good! The world is always changing. I still have a very long time.” As he spoke, he stretched out his hand and grabbed Qian Mei before both of them vanished on the spot.

“Ye Yang, I swear that I’ll kill you....” At the moment both of them vanished, Qian Mei’s ferocious roar suddenly resounded.

Yang Ye chuckled and didn’t care at all.

Because of the conflict they had with Yang Ye, most of the people here didn’t stay behind. It wasn’t long before only a few people remained, and it included that masked man and the woman who stood by his side.

Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto the masked man, and then his brows knit together slightly because the man made him feel quite uncomfortable.

“Let’s go!” The woman by his side suddenly pulled on his wrist.

The masked man gazed at Yang Ye for a short while before he left with the woman.

After the masked man left, Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and looked at Bai Chen, “What? You intend to continue betting?”

“Who exactly are you!?” Bai Chen gritted his teeth. He’d thought that his Sword Dao was the strongest in the Hallowed Grounds besides Zuo Dengfeng. No, it should be said that he felt he wasn’t even inferior to Zuo Dengfeng. But he hadn’t expected that he would actually encounter someone with Heaven Rank Sword Intent at the Fire Spirit Race....

No one could understand how he felt right now!

Yang Ye said, “I fought Zuo Dengfeng before he left for Profounder Continent. You would definitely not be a match for him if he attained the Monarch Realm. Because his sword was much purer than yours, and his heart towards the Sword Dao was stronger. The reason I’m wasting my breath on you is because you’re a sword cultivator as well. So, I’m doing it out of consideration for the Sword Dao and not you.”

Bai Chen fell silent for a short while before he suddenly gazed at Yang Ye and said, “I’ll defeat you! I definitely will!”

“You’re very welcome to do so if you do it in an open and upright manner!” Yang Ye continued, “However, if you try to play tricks like you had just now, then I guarantee that 100,000 Beasts of Desire will be waiting for you!”

Bai Chen took a deep glance at Yang Ye before he turned around and left.

“You possessed a Natural Treasure and comprehended Heaven Rank Sword Intent. You’re absolutely not an ordinary person, so who exactly are you!?” Meanwhile, the 4th Elder spoke abruptly.

“I picked him up on the ground!” Xiaoman spoke abruptly, “In any case, he’s absolutely not a spy!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. Does she think... I’m an object? She picked me up? That sounds so terrible. Can’t you just say that you rescued me?

Yang Ye replied, “If you think that I’m a spy, then I can leave the Fire Spirit Race once I’ve recuperated. Or you can send me away from here right now.”

“No!” Xiaoman and the Half-Saints shouted at practically the exact same moment.

Yang Ye was stunned!

“You’re mine!” Xiaoman looked Yang Ye in the eyes and spoke in an extremely serious tone, “In our race, it’s a huge humiliation for a woman to be abandoned. If you dare to abandon me, then I’ll kill myself, and kill you!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Xiaoman seemed to have noticed that something was wrong with what she’d said, and she immediately corrected herself, “I’ll kill you, then take my own life. Right, that’s it!”

Meanwhile, one of the elders said, “4th Elder didn’t have any ill intent. He was just quite curious because of the treasure you possessed and the strength you revealed. After all, I presume that even if it’s in the Hallowed Halls, there are very few who can give out a Natural Treasure as their dowry and possess Heaven Rank Sword Intent. Moreover, we really don’t have a good relationship with the Hallowed Halls. Of course, it doesn’t matter even if you’re from the Hallowed Halls. Because the defiant profounders are about to emerge from the seal, so we’ll still join forces with them regardless of how bad our relationship is!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. Looks like I won’t be able to leave the Fire Spirit Race for now. But it’s fine because I haven’t recovered completely. I would really be giving my life away if I left and encountered Xuan Ming’s group.

“Alright. So many things occurred tonight, and it has delayed your wedding night. We old men will stop disturbing the 2 of you!” As he spoke, the Grand Elder and the 4th Elder’s figure shook slightly and vanished on the spot.

“Don’t break Xiaoman’s heart or I’ll kill you no matter who you are!” Tong Fen spoke these words before vanishing on the spot.

...

Xiaoman’s room.

Xiaoman gazed excitedly at the pile of Firecrystals on the table, and she said, “This is 30 years old; this is 100 years old.... Wow! This is 200 years old! Little Yang, we’re rich!”

Little Yang.... Yang Ye’s face darkened. He’d seriously and solemnly refused such a nickname, but Xiaoman disregarded his protests.

Yang Ye shook his head, withdrew a 1,000 year old Firecrystals, and passed it to her. He said, “This is for you, it should be helpful to you!” Besides those Firecrystals which he gave the Grand Elder, he’d won a total of 6 1,000 year old Firecrystals from Qian Yan. He’d given 2 to Xiaoman, so he had 4 more. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

After he found out how important the Firecrystals were, he understood that they were very precious. Because they could create Monarch Realm experts. However, he didn’t feel any reluctance because a few Firecrystals were nothing when compared to his life.

Xiao Man fell silent as she gazed at the Firecrystal.

“What’s wrong?” asked Yang Ye.

Xiaoman suddenly said, “Why are you being so nice to me?”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and he said, “You saved my life!”

She replied, “I was just using you!”

“Using me?” Yang Ye smiled, “How? By marrying me?”

Xiaoman nodded.

Yang Ye smiled and said, “If it’s that, then I forgive you! But I’m quite curious. What exactly made you forcefully drag me here to marry you?”

She replied, “A huge amount of Fire Poison appeared within my grandfather’s body from a problem in his cultivation. So, he wouldn’t be able to live for long. He knew that I would definitely be bullied once he passed away, and I might even be killed. So, he forced me to marry someone. Because so long as a pregnant woman of the Fire Spirit Race doesn’t violate the rules of the race, then no one can harm that woman.

“I’d originally intended to find someone to put on a show and trick him, but I never expected that I would encounter you, and I never imagined that I would even obtain a type of fire element Natural Treasure. It’s the first time I’ve taken the possessions of another, but I had no other choice because it could save my grandfather. I, Xiaoman, don’t want to owe anyone anything in my lifetime, so....”

“So, you’re prepared to give yourself to me. Because you wouldn’t owe me anything then, right?” said Yang Ye.

She nodded in response.

Yang Ye sighed softly, “Silly girl. Do you realize that you saved me? If you killed me at that time, the Nether Ghostflame would still be yours, and you wouldn’t have to feel that you owed me anything. Understand?”

Xiaoman blinked and said, “Why didn’t you say so?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
