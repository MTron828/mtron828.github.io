Chapter 2645 – This is How You Act?

The slaughter intent Yang Ye emanated was simply endless.

It was unstoppable!

No matter how his Sword Domain and sword intent tried to suppress it, they couldn’t suppress his desire to kill.

Two streams of clear tears gradually seeped out of the corners of Yang Ye’s eyes.

No one could understand how he felt right now!

He had never felt so guilty and regretful in his life.

He regretted it!

Truly regretted it!

He regretted dragging Nether Maiden and the others into his problems. He shouldn’t have let them interfere. It was him! If he hadn’t searched for them, they wouldn’t have fallen to this state.

It was the first time he felt so very selfish.

“Brother Yang, this isn’t the time for guilt!” Meanwhile, the black clothed figure spoke abruptly, “We need to save them now and take them away from here. Their souls have been severely injured, but they can still be saved. However, delaying will be extremely disadvantageous to them.”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly upon hearing this, and then he forcefully suppressed his desire to kill!

After all, he was at the Destiny Realm now, not the Lord Realm!

Now, it wasn’t that easy for his slaughter intent to corrupt him.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

A sword shot forward from Yang Ye’s waist, and then the pillars were sliced into bits. Yang Ye waved his right hand, and he sent their souls into the Primordial Pagoda.

Snowy hurriedly started to heal them with Primordial Violet Energy.

Even though their bodies had been destroyed, it was fine so long as their souls remained. Because while it may cause many issues for their cultivation in the future, it was better than death!

The black clothed figure continued, “The disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect are on a different level.”

The black clothed figure vanished on the spot with Yang Ye while speaking.

A short while later, they arrived at another hall. The disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect were being kept here, and their bodies hadn’t been destroyed.

The Nether Lord only wanted the souls of the strong.

Yang Ye and the black clothed figure were about to leave. Suddenly, Yang Ye and the black clothed figure looked down, and they noticed that something seemed to be trembling down there!

The black clothed figure was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly raised his sword and swung it.

Hiss!

The ground of the hall was cut open, and then they saw a middle aged man covered in pitch black chains far below them.

The middle aged man’s hair was extremely long, even longer than his body, and it was scattered on the ground.

Besides that, numerous souls were coiled around him, and they seemed to be devouring him.

The black clothed figure glanced at Yang Ye, and Yang Ye turned around and walked away.

“Help me!” Suddenly, the middle aged man spoke from below.

Yang Ye stopped, “Reason.”

The middle aged man fell silent for a short while and said, “You may need some help now, and I’m very good at fighting!”

Yang Ye asked, “How good?”

The middle aged man looked up, “Wouldn’t you find out once you free me?”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, and then his sword shot down!

Suddenly, the souls around the middle aged man pounced at Yang Ye’s sword. Strands of black energy instantly enveloped Yang Ye’s sword.

The middle aged man suddenly said, “An ordinary sword cannot destroy these animals!”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye raised his right hand slightly.

A moment later, countless strands of sword intent and slaughter intent rippled out of his sword, and then the souls howled in pain and shot backward.

The sword shot forward and struck the chains around the middle aged man.

The chains shook violently but remained completely unharmed!

“This chain isn’t any weaker to a Super Divine Treasure!” The middle aged man spoke abruptly, “Most importantly, there’s powerful Death Energy within it, so it’s so strong that…”

Meanwhile, Executor suddenly flew back to Yang Ye’s grasp.

An instant later, Yang Ye appeared before the middle aged man and swung his sword.

The Domain Sword!

Crack!

The chains around the middle aged man instantly started to crack.

But they weren’t destroyed!

The middle aged man frowned slightly from the sight of this, and his gaze descended onto Yang Ye’s sword, “This sword of yours… It’s Heaven Executor! It’s actually in your possession!”

Yang Ye glanced at the middle aged man because the man actually knew this sword’s true background!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and was about to attack again, but Snowy appeared before him.

The middle aged man was astonished, “The Sprite Progenitor!”

Snowy glanced at the middle aged man, flew over to him, and then gazed at the chain. She blinked, grabbed it, and then just a moment later, the chain automatically released the middle aged man!

Just like that, Snowy dragged the chain into the Primordial Pagoda!

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Just like that, the middle aged man was free.

Now that he was bound no more, the middle aged man raised his hand and cut off two thirds of his hair.

After that, he closed his eyes slowly. A short while later, Death Energy and Yin Energy surged out from within him. Besides that, there was another type of energy, but Yang Ye didn’t recognize it.

“A Death Spirit Cultivator!” Meanwhile, the black clothed figure by Yang Ye’s side spoke abruptly.

The middle aged man opened his eyes and gazed at the black clothed figure, “You actually know about that!”

The black clothed figure nodded slightly, “I merely read about it in ancient texts. I didn’t expect you to actually be one.”

The middle aged man replied indifferently, “I’m afraid there are only three of us Death Spirit Cultivators left in this world.”

The black clothed man asked, “The Nether Lord and Death Lord?”

The middle aged man laughed coldly, “Those bastards are Death Spirit Cultivators, of course. But it’s fine, it won’t be long before only I remain.”

The black clothed figure suddenly asked, “Who are you?”

The middle aged man replied indifferently, “Tai Huntian. Of course, I had a nickname in the past, Bringer of Sorrow.”

The black clothed figure nodded slightly before looking at Yang Ye. Yang Ye said, “What you said earlier… Does that promise still stand?”

Tai Huntian glanced at Yang Ye, “Of course.”

As he spoke, he gazed at Yang Ye’s sword, “This sword of yours…”

Yang Ye said, “I obtained it by chance!”

Tai Huntian glanced at Yang Ye and didn’t say anything.

Yang Ye turned around and swung his sword.

The entire hall was instantly slashed into two!

Meanwhile, a shocking battle was still going on in the distant central area of the Nether World.

Sky Maiden was fighting two experts on her own!

Sky Maiden was fighting two peak Destiny Realm experts on her own there. They were the Nether Lord and Death Lord! Both of them were experts from a distant era!

Suppression!

While she was fighting two on her own, Sky Maiden was completely suppressing them.

The entire area had been blasted apart countless times by their battle.

Once Yang Ye and the others emerged from beneath the ground, Yang Ye looked up into the sky in Sky Maiden’s direction. He was about to take action when a few powerful auras suddenly appeared nearby.

It didn’t take long for a few figures to appear before them.

The group was led by Mr. Jing!

Mr. Jing gazed at Yang Ye and grinned, “I bet you didn’t expect that we would meet again so soon.”

As he spoke, he gazed at Tai Huntian, “I didn’t expect you to get the help of another expert in such a short amount of time. You’re truly extraordinary.”

Tai Huntian glanced at Mr. Jing and gazed at Yang Ye, “Want me to fight him?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Why don’t you put on a small display?”

Tai Huntian chuckled, and then his figure shot explosively at Mr. Jing.

Mr. Jing’s eyes narrowed slightly as he slammed a punch forward!

As soon as his fist shot forward, the space before him warped into a strange vortex, and the vortex moved forward to swallow Tai Huntian!

Mr. Jing grinned, but it only took a moment for his expression to change drastically.

Boom!

A black shadow slammed against Mr. Jing.

Bam!

An explosion resounded, and then something strange occurred. His body had been blasted away, but his soul hadn’t!

A hand had forcefully grabbed Mr. Jing by the throat!

Everyone here was shocked by this scene!

It was absolutely terrifying!

Even Mr. Jing’s face was covered in terror right now, “You…”

Tai Huntian glanced at Yang Ye, “Shall I kill him?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Tai Huntian cracked a smile, and then he opened his mouth and inhaled. Mr. Jing’s soul was instantly sucked into Tai Huntian’s mouth!

Bang!

A wave of terrifying aura swept out from Tai Huntian!

Tia Huntian inhaled greedily, “The soul of a peak Destiny Realm expert is truly nutritious!”

As he spoke, he gazed at the Divine Abode’s master and the others.

The Divine Abode’s master gazed at Shui Wubian, “Notify the End World.”

Shu Wubian nodded slightly, and then he crushed a talisman.

They were calling for help!

“You’re calling for help?” Tai Huntian cracked a smile, “Very good, very good indeed. Haha!”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Leaving them to you isn’t a problem, right?”

Tai Huntian glanced at Yang Ye, “Once I help you keep them busy, the debt I owe you will be repaid.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “No problem.”

Tai Huntian pointed at the two experts who were fighting Sky Maiden high above in the sky, “Don’t kill those two. Keep them for me because I want to kill them myself.”

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “I must kill the Nether Lord myself.”

Tai Huntian gazed at Yang Ye, “Are you trying to negotiate with me?”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “What do you think?”

Tai Huntian cracked a smile, “Trust me, I’ll just step aside and watch the fight!”

Yang Ye glanced at Tai Huntian with a ridiculing smile, “You’re an ancient expert? But this is how you act?”

Tai Huntian’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Do you want to die?”

Yang Ye walked over to Tai Huntian, “You’re an ancient expert and someone with status, yet you treat your words as pure trash?”

Tai Huntian gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “You’re bold, really bold.”

As he spoke, he turned around and walked toward the Divine Abode’s master and the others, “I, Tai Huntian, keep my word. I’ll repay your kindness tenfold today!”
