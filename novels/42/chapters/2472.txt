Chapter 2473 – The Hou!

Let’s do it!

Yang Ye’s face darkened.

My great lord Snowy! We’re no match for that old man!

Snowy waved her tiny fists again!

Yang Ye smiled as he rubbed her head, “You know nothing about our strength!”

Meanwhile, Erya appeared by their side. She glanced at Snowy and said, “Snowy, that old man is very strong. We’re no match for him. So, it’s impossible to steal from him.”

Bitterness immediately appeared on Snowy’s face!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t worry, we’ll meet him again!”

Snowy nodded because that was all they could hope for now.

Erya suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, “Big Brother Yang, I feel like I’ve grown stronger!”

Yang Ye asked, “So?”

Erya cracked a smile, “Why don’t we spar?”

Yang Ye replied, “Why don’t you ask your Big Sister An?”

Erya puckered her lips. An Nanjing? She was still quite afraid of An Nanjing. It wasn’t just in terms of strength, it was mentally too. As far as she was concerned, An Nanjing was someone on par with her grandfather. As for Yang Ye, he was like an elder brother or friend!

Of course, if Yang Ye went into his insane state, then she would dare to offend him either!

Yang Ye directly refused, “I refuse. You can ask your Big Sister An or that dragon and the others!”

Erya had advanced now, so her strength was definitely not just a little stronger. She was probably capable of fighting Five World Realm experts! Most importantly, her defenses, and especially now that she had those scales. While he didn’t know what scales those were, he was very well aware that even Executor would probably find them difficult to pierce!

In any case, fighting her would be very tiring!

Suddenly, Sword Scroll said, “Fight her!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Sword Scroll replied, “Your bloodline has been activated, so you can test it. As for Erya, her strength and defenses have improved, but she doesn’t know how much they’ve improved. So, both of you can use each other to test your strengths!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded, “Fine!”

They entered the Primordial Pagoda.

On the Ascension Platform.

Erya rubbed her palms together as she gazed at Yang Ye with a mischievous grin. If it was possible, she didn’t mind beating Yang Ye up! The reason? Why would she need one?

The other demons were below the platform.

As for Snowy, she was at the rear mountains of the Sword Sect with the fruit she’d received from the old man.

On the Ascension Platform, Erya suddenly said, “Big Brother Yang, be careful!”

As soon as she said that, she leaped up and charged at him!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly when he saw her charge at him. He didn’t dare to be careless against this little fellow, so he immediately commanded a sword to shoot out of the Sword Gourd!

Erya revealed no fear toward that sword, and she just raised her claw and slapped at it. The sword energy was slapped into bits, and the sword was slapped away. But right at this moment, a sword stabbed against her chest!

But it couldn’t stab into her!

Yang Ye grabbed the sword with both hands and twisted it.

Bang!

Erya was blasted to the edge of the platform!

As soon as Erya stopped herself, Yang Ye’s sword arrived before her once more. Her reaction was swift, and she twisted her body sideways to dodge the incoming attack. After that, she just slammed her body at Yang Ye.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted away!

But that wasn’t the end of it. Erya strode forward and appeared in front of Yang Ye before kicking at him.

Yang Ye’s figure suddenly turned ethereal, and then he swung his sword with both hands!

Six swings with the Sword Domain!

This time, Yang Ye was clearly serious. If he didn’t fight seriously in a spar with Erya, then she would absolutely beat him up!

Erya blinked when she noticed the strength of this attack. But she didn’t dodge and just used her head to collide with it!UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Or to be more precise, she’d used her horns!

Just like that, Yang Ye’s sword descended upon Erya’s horns.

Bang!

Space shook violently!

However, it was Yang Ye who was blasted away!

He flew all the way to the rear mountains of the Sword Sect. Or to be more precise, he flew all the way to Snowy.

Snowy blinked, and then she flew over to Yang Ye while concern filled her eyes!

Yang Ye forcefully endured the discomfort he experienced and squeezed out a smile, “I’m fine, I’m fine!”

After that, he vanished on the spot.

Snowy blinked, and then she continued her search for the perfect spot! She was going to plant a fruit!

On the Ascension Platform, Yang Ye and Erya’s battle continued.

After suffering that loss, Yang Ye changed his tactics in battle. He knew he couldn’t afford to go head-on with her! Erya’s horns were absolutely too terrifying! Just a while ago, those horns had gone head-on against his sword, but they were completely unharmed!

But he was using Executor!

On the Ascension Platform, Erya’s figure twisted sideways and dodged Yang Ye’s attack, and then she stomped her right foot down.

Bang!

The Ascension Platform shook violently, and then Erya shot forward like a cannonball at Yang Ye!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then a blood red glow appeared around him!

Bloodline Energy!

Yang Ye noticed that he was completely helpless against Erya without his bloodline. Her physical strength and defenses were just too terrifying!

It seemed like it was made of a Super Divine Treasure!

Once his bloodline was activated, Yang Ye felt like his body was full of energy. A moment later, his figure turned ethereal, and then he swung his sword with both hands!

Six swings with the Sword Domain!

As soon as the sixth swing descended, the space here shook. If the world in here hadn’t been improved by the old man just now, this attack would have destroyed the space within the Primordial Pagoda!

Erya still didn’t dodge it, nor could she. While Yang Ye’s attacks weren’t as strong as hers, his speed was quite a bit faster than hers. Moreover, dodging now would come with worse consequences!

Erya’s head was very hard!

Because she used her head to collide with Yang Ye’s sword again!

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then Erya was blasted away. As for Yang Ye, he was pushed backward repeatedly for over 300m. Moreover, as his figure was pushed back, the powerful force of the impact left a faint mark in space!

His entire body felt numb!

That was what Yang Ye felt right now!

While his attack had succeeded at blasted Erya away, the powerful aftershock of the collision was absolutely uncomfortable!

It was too damn strong! If he hadn’t used his bloodline to strengthen himself, then while this attack would have blasted Erya away, the impact would have killed him as well!

Erya laid there on the ground while howling incessantly.

It hurt!

It hurt for Yang Ye, and it hurt for her too! Yang Ye hadn’t held back at all just now, and he’d even used his bloodline. Even a Five World Realm expert couldn’t resist that with ease, but she’d taken it head-on, and she’d even done so with her head!

Some time passed before Erya crawled up from the ground. She went to the Ascension Platform and spoke with slight displeasure, “Big Brother Yang, don’t you know how to hold back? I feel so dizzy!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched, “Hold back? You little bastard! You didn’t hold back when you attacked me! So, are we going to continue?”

Erya hurriedly waved her hand, “We’re not! We’re not! I’m going to learn how to fight from Big Sister An!” She’d noticed that at most times in her battle against Yang Ye, she was only able to passively receive a beating. While she was very resistant to such attacks, she really didn’t want to just get hit all the time! But Yang Ye was extremely slippery, so her brute force didn’t have a target for it to be used on! Otherwise, she was confident that she could beat Yang Ye down with a single punch!

Yang Ye smiled, “You should learn more.”

Erya nodded, and then she gazed at the other demons, “It’s the same for all of you. You must learn well from me. Come on, let’s go train right now!”

All the demons howled in agony.

Erya’s way of training was hitting them, continuously hitting them… Those days of training were absolutely unbearable! However, it was effective. Two aspects stood out. Firstly, after being hit so much, they learned to dodge, and they stopped going head-on against her. Secondly, their skin grew thicker!

Once Erya led them away, An Nanjing and Sword Scroll appeared beside Yang Ye. Yang Ye spoke softly, “If Erya learns some combat techniques or if she uses the Demon Wings of Death, then even I may not be able to defeat her!”

“A 40% chance!” Sword Scroll spoke abruptly, “If she uses the Demon Wings of Death, you only have a 40% chance to win. Your Divine Treasures and every other external source of strength you possess are useless against her!”

Useless!

Yang Ye nodded. After all, even Executor had hit her a few times just now. But what happened? Erya was completely unharmed! Her body was just too terrifying!

Suddenly, An Nanjing said, “I’m not confident either!”

Yang Ye and Sword Scroll gazed at her, and she spoke softly, “The most formidable form of a demon beast is when they are in their true form. If she can transform, or in other words, if she can return to her true form, then her strength will grow even more terrifying. She’s merely partially transformed right now!”

Transformation!

Yang Ye gazed at Sword Scroll, “Sword Scroll, what’s Erya’s true identity?”

Sword Scroll fell silent for a short while and shook her head, “I thought it was what I guessed she was, a Hou. Because according to the ancient texts, the Hou is fond of devouring demon beasts, especially dragons. It’s the mortal enemy of the dragons. But I’m sure you’ve noticed that Erya doesn’t just want to eat dragons, she eats everything. If she hadn’t gone through life and death with Snowy, she would probably even want to eat Snowy! After all, even the Hou reveres the Sprite Progenitor, but Erya only experiences friendship for Snowy, not reverence. If we ignore their friendship, you’ll notice that she doesn’t fear Snowy at all!”
