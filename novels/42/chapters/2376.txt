Chapter 2377 – The Desolate Race!

Yang Ye and Nanli Meng exchanged glances.

Obviously, the middle aged man was the Primal Emperor.

Dead!

The middle aged man was dead, and it was the black spear that had killed him.

Who was its owner?

Yang Ye and Nanli Meng walked over, and they gazed at the corpse in silence.

An emperor!

A Primal Emperor!

The middle aged man’s strength was absolutely not something a Limitbreaker Realm expert could compare to. But such an expert had still been killed.

How strong would one need to be in order to become truly invincible?

The path of cultivation had no end!

Meanwhile, Nanli Meng bowed slightly to the middle aged man, “Senior, do you have any unfulfilled wishes?”

As soon as she finished speaking, the corpse before them shook!

It was moving!

Yang Ye and Nanli Meng were shocked, and they immediately became extremely vigilant.

The middle aged man’s eyes gradually recovered their color, and then they were no different than the eyes of an ordinary person. He withdrew his gaze and looked at them, sizing them up for a while before his gaze finally descended upon Yang Ye.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The middle aged man asked, “A sword cultivator?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The middle aged man nodded slightly and pointed to the north, “There’s an old friend of mine over there, and he’s a sword cultivator too. Unfortunately, his Sword Dao isn’t suitable for you. Otherwise, you can go try your luck over there.”

Yang Ye smiled and wasn’t disappointed.

The Sword Dao!

He has his own Sword Dao, so he could only learn from the strengths of others.

The middle aged man suddenly asked, “How’s the outside world?”

Nanli Meng hesitated for a moment and asked, “Senior, are you asking about the Eternal Universe?”

He nodded slightly, “Have they fulfilled their promise?”

Nanli Meng asked, “What promise?”

He frowned slightly, “Can the people of Eternal Border go to the Eternal Universe?”

Nanli Meng shook her head.

A wisp of self-ridicule arose on the corners of his mouth, “To think I still held some hope.”

She glanced at him and said, “Senior, what happened during that battle all those years ago?”

The middle aged man shook his head slightly, “It’s meaningless now.”

“Not at all!” Nanli Meng looked him in the eyes, “At the very least, we of the later generations have the right to know, don’t we? There are no records of what happened in Eternal Border. The Primal Era is a blank piece of history to the people of Eternal Border right now.”

The middle aged man fell silent for a long time and said, “Actually, Eternal Border is a battlefield!”

Nanli Meng’s pupils constricted, “It’s a battlefield?”

The middle aged man nodded, “It’s a huge battlefield. The Eternal Universe is the largest, but the smallest too. The Eternal Universe is like a kingdom, it’s the leader of countless other universes, and it’s the most flourishing universe among them. The resources it possesses are the best too. So, they grew increasingly better while the other universes, including Eternal Border, were unable to keep up. For the sake of conserving Eternal Kingdom’s resources… Right, they gave themselves that name. For the sake of conserving Eternal Kingdom’s resources, they severed their ties to all other universes. Simply speaking, they refuse to allow the people of other universes to enter Eternal Kingdom.”

Yang Ye and Nanli Meng exchanged glances, and there was shock in both their eyes.

The middle aged man looked up at the sky, and his gaze pierced through it until he could see a river and a wall.

He withdrew his gaze, shook his head, and smiled, “They didn’t go too far. Of course, they dare not do that. While the other universes can’t compare to them, it doesn’t represent that the other universes do not have any extraordinary experts.”

Nanli Meng spoke solemnly, “Even if such experts appear, the existence of an opportunity will stop them from fighting the Eternal Universe until the end. As for the others, they do not have such strength, so even if they want to fight the Eternal Universe, it’ll be no different than courting death!”

“Indeed!” He gazed at Nanli Meng and smiled, “In the beginning, many saw that opportunity as a form of kindness, and so they didn’t fight back. Unfortunately, not everyone saw it as a form of kindness.”

He looked into the sky and continued, “There’s a race far away from here, the desolate race. They started a war, and they crushed everything before them and attacked Eternal Kingdom. They practically succeeded. Unfortunately, they made a mistake, a huge mistake.”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “What mistake?”

The middle aged man spoke softly, “They slaughtered, they slaughtered without end upon entering Eternal Kingdom, and they killed too many living beings. These included many, many Sprites, and that infuriated the Sprite Progenitor of Eternal Kingdom. So, the Sprite Progenitor that never participated in conflicts suddenly declared war on the desolate race. The Sprite Progenitor personally left Eternal Kingdom and summoned the help of countless Sprites. Moreover, the spirit veins and some great demons of the desolate race switched sides…”

He closed his eyes slowly at this point, “I’ll never forget that scene! The Sprite Progenitor’s participation in the battle brought hope to Eternal Kingdom, the hope of victory. The desolate race’s patriarch, the Desolate Emperor, joined that battle himself. However, Eternal Kingdom was prepared, and they sent around 10 Emperors, over 20 great demons, and a few dozen Sprite Emperors to protect the Sprite Progenitor with their lives. Unfortunately, the strength of the desolate race’s patriarch surpassed everyone’s imagination.”

Yang Ye asked, “The Sprite Progenitor died?”

The middle aged man nodded slightly, “The Sprite Progenitor died, but the desolate race’s patriarch was heavily injured. Moreover, because they killed the Sprite Progenitor, it infuriated the living beings of the entire universe. The spirit of all beings madly attacked the desolate race at that time, including some mysterious ancient creatures. It can be said that the desolate race who had the upper hand instantly lost their advantage. Even the impossibly strong patriarch of the desolate race couldn’t stop their attack. Because even the spirit of all beings on his side was displeased with what he’d done. Coupled with the fact that he and the desolate race had suffered heavy injuries and losses, the Desolate Emperor had no choice but to flee with his race.”

The Sprite Progenitor!

Nanli Meng glanced at Yang Ye. She hadn’t forgotten that this fellow before her had a Sprite Progenitor! While it wasn’t really a Sprite Progenitor yet, it was only a matter of time before the little fellow became one!

Nanli Meng knew that she had to be nicer to Snowy!

Actually, Yang Ye was quite excited when he heard this. A Sprite Progenitor was actually so terrifying. In other words, practically no one would dare to touch Snowy in the future!

Yang Ye grew even more excited at the thought of this, and it should be said that he was happy, happy for Snowy.

In the past, many had targeted her. But once she became a Sprite Progenitor, probably no one would dare to anymore.

Nanli Meng suddenly asked, “Then what happened here in Eternal Border?”

The middle aged man shook his head slightly, “This is the only way to the Eternal Universe. So, we either had to stand with them and submit to the desolate race. In the beginning, we weren’t sure which way to side, but once the desolate race offended the Sprite Progenitor by slaughtering too many living beings, the experts of Eternal Border immediately sided with Eternal Kingdom. While the desolate race had broken into the Eternal Kingdom, their actions were truly despicable. Moreover, the people of countless universes were very well aware that if the desolate race took over Eternal Kingdom, they would definitely do the same as Eternal Kingdom was already doing. Moreover, they may not give others any chance at all.”

Nanli Meng spoke softly, “Both the desolate race and Eternal Kingdom only care about themselves.”

The middle aged man nodded slightly, “We had no choice but to pick a side during that battle. However, countless died after we picked sides. Of course, more than that died throughout the war. Fortunately, the Sprite Progenitor was benevolent, and she sent some people from Eternal Border into Eternal Kingdom before she died. Eternal Kingdom naturally didn’t refuse her, and they promised to allow 10 people from Eternal Border to enter Eternal Kingdom for free every 10 years.”

Yang Ye thought of two words—giving alms.

But it was normal. After all, Eternal Kingdom was too strong! As far as the people of Eternal Border were concerned, that quota of 10 was a form of kindness, great kindness!

Yang Ye shook his head. Eternal Kingdom? If he were being honest, he didn’t care for it at all!

Meanwhile, the middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye, “Can I see her?”

Yang Ye glanced at him and summoned Snowy.

At this moment, she was sleeping. From some point in time, the little fellow had become fond of sleeping. Yang Ye didn’t wake her and just held her in his arms.

There was a wisp of complicated emotions in the middle aged man’s eyes as he gazed at Snowy, “She was just a Sprite Lord, yet I never expected her to be able to evolve into a Sprite Progenitor. It’s quite inconceivable indeed. Moreover, it’s outside of Eternal Kingdom.”

He shook his head and sighed, “It’s her luck, and her misfortune. You must remember that you must not give her to anyone until she truly becomes a Sprite Progenitor. Especially Eternal Kingdom. That Sprite Progenitor possessed supreme status in Eternal Kingdom because she was a Sprite Progenitor already, so no person or power in Eternal Kingdom would act against a Sprite Progenitor. However, this little fellow of yours is still a Sprite Lord. If she falls into their hands, they will definitely use extreme methods to control her.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’ll take good care of her!”

As if she’d heard him, Snowy rubbed her head against Yang Ye’s chest, and then she wrapped her paws around him. Meanwhile, a slight grin was on her face. It seemed like she was dreaming of some kind of treasure.

Because she smiled just like that when she saw a treasure.

Yang Ye rubbed her head and gazed at the middle aged man, “Senior, we’re going to leave now. If you have any treasures… Oh, I mean if you have anything you need us to help you with, then please be frank. We’ll do our best!”
