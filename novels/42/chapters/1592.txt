Chapter 1593 - Those Who Submit Will Be Spared!

Translator: InVader

In the sky above Sky Sky Continent, an expanse of space there was deathly silent.

Suddenly, it started to tremble slightly. A short while later, an extremely fine thread of red energy appeared there. More and more threads of red energy appeared there, and they expanded faster and faster. Two hours later, the red threads of energy formed a net that enveloped the entire continent.

A short while later, a middle aged man in a dark violet robe appeared there, and it didn’t take long for a woman holding a feather fan to appear there as well.

The man and woman were the Nether Judge and the Nether Envoy, Fan Yinyu.

The Nether Judge gazed at Fan Yinyu, “Envoy Fan, you’ve lived here for so long, so you should know it very well. Do you think we’ll be able to conquer this universe without facing any problems?”

Fan Yinyu gazed at him, “What do you think?”

The Nether Judge chuckled, “I think it’ll be absolutely easy!”

“Absolutely easy?” Fan Yinyu laughed coldly, “Judge, do you think Merak System is just an ordinary universe?”

The Nether Judge replied with a question, “What?”

Fan Yinyu looked down and said, “Even though this universe doesn’t have any extraordinarily strong powers, many extraordinary geniuses have appeared here. Even though every universe gives birth to numerous extraordinary geniuses, some of the figures who came from here have even surpassed the limits of my knowledge.”

“Hmm?” The Nether Judge gazed at Fan Yinyu, “What sort of figures were born from this place?”

“The Unfettered One.” Fan Yinyu spoke indifferently, “Judge, you’re a peerless genius, and your strength is even superior to mine. However, if I’m to be honest, if you encounter him while you’re both at the same realm of cultivation, then you’ll definitely die.”

The Nether Judge’s eyes narrowed slightly, “He’s that strong?”

“He isn’t just that strong, he’s extraordinarily strong!” Fan Yinyu continued, “His attainments in the Sword Dao are simply godly. Amongst the people I’ve met, perhaps only Pavilion Master Shaosi can fight him. I could in the past, but he grew too quickly, and his attainments in the Sword Dao grew stronger and stronger. If we’re in the same realm of cultivation, I’m no match for him at all.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “He isn’t the only one. There’s another person. That person’s strength has completely surpassed my knowledge and understanding. Perhaps even Pavilion Master Shaosi is no match for him!”

The Nether Judge’s brows raised, “Who is that?!”

Fan Yinyu replied, “An old man in a Daoist’s robe. Just a clone of his broke through Jian Wuji’s Stellar Sword Diagram and caused Jian Wuji’s death. Such strength is simply terrifying!”

The Nether Judge asked, “Are they still in Merak System?”

Fan Yinyu shook her head slightly, “Both are gone.”

“What a pity!” The Nether Judge spoke indifferently, “I’ll definitely gain a huge amount of experience if I’m able to fight such an expert!”

He glanced at the continent below him and said, “Fortunately, we’ll have much less trouble. Once we’ve conquered this universe, our Nether Pavilion’s strength will definitely rise tremendously. It’s only a matter of time before we regain the strength we had at our prime.”

Fan Yinyu suddenly said, “This universe is a burden to us.”

“I understand, of course!” The Nether Judge said, “Our goal is just the spirit energy of this universe. When the time comes, we’ll take away all the spirit energy in this universe. As for this world, it’s just as you’ve said. It’s a burden to us, so our Nether Pavilion will naturally not take it.”

Fan Yinyu remained silent for a long time, and then she nodded, “I understand now.”

The Nether Judge continued, “Envoy Fan, the Pavilion Master sent you and not the ten Nether Hall this time. The reason for this is very simple. The Pavilion Master doesn’t wish for you and them to engage in internal strife right now. However, the Pavilion Master has said that once the mission here is complete, both your sides can put an end to all enmity between you.”

Fan Yinyu spoke flatly, “I hope so!”

Suddenly, the space in front of them trembled slightly, and then a little girl appeared in front of them.

The little girl was Little Sky.

Little Sky glanced coldly at Fan Yinyu and the Nether Judge, “You’re not welcome here.”

The Nether Judge chuckled, “Three days from now, this place will belong to my Nether Pavilion.”

Little Sky gazed at him and replied, “Let’s wait and see.”

The Nether Judge gazed at Little Sky for a long time and replied, “We shall.” As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot with Fan Yinyu.

Not long after Fan Yinyu and the Nether Judge vanished, a young boy appeared by Little Sky’s side.

The young boy was that boy on the goat.

The boy spoke softly, “We could have killed them.”

Little Sky shook her head, “I haven’t recalled how to unseal my ability to fight. Moreover, it’s pointless to kill them. It’ll just make the Nether Pavilion become vigilant.”

The boy nodded slightly, “Understood.” As he spoke, he gazed at Little Sky, “That fellow, Yang Ye. I’m actually unable to see through his next life. Why is that?”

Little Sky shook her head, “Even I can’t.”

The young boy asked, “Why?”

She replied, “Two possibilities. The first is that he won’t die, and he’ll truly surpass the cycle of reincarnation and attain eternal life. The second is that he’ll be obliterated, and he has no next life.”

The young boy nodded, “Just as I expected.” He paused for a moment and continued, “Does he have some sort of precious treasure in his possession? Because his destiny seems to have been changed. No, that’s not right. He possesses two types of completely different destinies.”

Little Sky nodded, “In any case, that fellow’s future is filled with both fortune and disaster. It’s impossible to determine if it’ll end with fortune or disaster.”

“Indeed!” The boy nodded, and then he looked up at the net of red energy in the sky, “Should we destroy that formation?”

Little Sky shook her head, “Leave it be. We don’t intend to leave anyway.”

She vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

The boy stood silently on the spot for some time, and then he vanished as well.

…

The Sprite Palace.

Yang Ye was back in the Sprite Palace, and he’d brought Lei Lin with him. Besides Lei Lin, he’d brought Xue’er as well. Just as he’d expected, both of them immediately became fond of Sprite Palace.

Especially Lei Lin. She was a Lightning Sprite King, so she was of the same kind as the other Sprite Kings. She had a stronger sense of belonging here.

In the beginning, the Sprite Kings rejected Xue’er slightly. Because she was human and not a Sprite King. However, it didn’t take long for them to gradually accept her. It was thanks to Snowy and Lei Lin of course.

Lei Lin was extremely close to Xue’er while Snowy liked her because of Yang Ye. Xue’er was Yang Ye’s daughter, so Snowy naturally liked her.

In the past, the Sprite Kings either cultivated or played every single day. Yet now, they had one more assignment, and it was to undergo training.

Needless to say, the scene of them being trained was extremely magnificent.

There were over 200 Sprite Kings lined up in an orderly fashion outside Sprite Hall. Tang Huo was in the lead.

Tang Huo waved her hand. In an instant, all the Sprite Kings fell silent. She flipped her palm, and a flat appeared in her grasp. She waved it abruptly, “Attack!”

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Over 200 beams of various light shot up into the sky. Some were beams of fire, some beams of water, some beams of lightning, and there were even some unknown types of energy. In short, it was magnificent, extremely magnificent!

Of course, it wasn’t just magnificent, it was extremely terrifying too.

In any case, Yang Ye shuddered at the sight of it. Because if all those beams of energy were to shoot towards him, then not to mention his physical defenses, even the casket lid might be blasted into bits.

Meanwhile, Tang Huo suddenly said, “Defend!”

As soon as she gave the order, countless shields of light instantly appeared above them. These shields of light formed a multicolored barrier of light, and it completely enveloped the entire Sprite Palace.

At the same time, Yang Ye noticed that countless types of different energy were surging like the tide towards the barrier of light.

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Can I give it a try?”

Tang Huo glanced at Yang Ye and nodded.

Yang Ye looked up at the barrier of light, fell silent for a moment, and then slowly closed his eyes. A moment later, a terrifying wave of sword intent surged out from within him, and then his sword vanished.

The Rebirth Sword!

He was very well aware of the strength that these Sprite Kings possessed. So, he’d immediately utilized the Rebirth Sword. Even though the Rebirth Sword wasn’t as strong as the Sword of Rebirth, it was extremely terrifying.

Bang!

A huge explosion resounded in the sky, and then Yang Ye’s sword returned to his grasp, and then… and then nothing happened. Because his sword energy had vanished, and the barrier of light had merely trembled slightly!

Yang Ye had an extremely solemn expression on his face!

Even though he’d expected it to be very strong, he hadn’t expected it to be that strong!

Actually, it was normal. Even though not all of these Sprite Kings were comparable to Rebirth Realm experts, at least half of them were comparable to Rebirth Realm experts. Moreover, a third of them surpasses ordinary Rebirth Realm experts. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Yet now, they had joined forces. So it was obvious how terrifying they would be!

Tang Huo suddenly asked, “Do you want to give it another try?”

Yang Ye shook his head. He would naturally not ask for insult. Unless he used the Stellar Sword Diagram or the Divine Yin Flame, it was impossible for him to destroy that barrier of light. Of course, the Sword of Rebirth may be able to, but its chances weren’t very great!

Time tricked by. It didn’t take long for three days to pass.

Dawn.

A voice suddenly resounded through the sky above Sky Sky Continent, “Residents of Merak System, those who submit will be spared!”
