Chapter 2177 – Kill!

The small restaurant was bustling!

Everyone before him was a brother of his who he’d gone through situations of life and death with. Previously, he hadn’t gone to meet them because the Alliance of All had a bounty on him, and he didn’t want them to be put in a difficult spot.

While he hadn’t gone to see them, he had never forgotten them!

Some relationships were strong and deep even if they weren’t mentioned!

Drink!

Now that they were reunited, it was just as Yang Ye said. Regardless of enmity or race, there was only one thing for them to do—drink!

The restaurant finally calmed down when dawn was about to arrive.

Yang Ye sat on the ground outside the restaurant, and he was looking up at the sky while leaning against the door frame.

Meanwhile, A’Man appeared by his side.

She sat down, “What do you plan to do?”

My plan? Yang Ye grinned, “What else? I’ll just take it one step at a time!”

She fell silent for a long time and said, “According to my knowledge, the Alliance of All will attack you if you can’t find a way out of this.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I know!”

He glanced at the others in the restaurant and said, “Actually, I’m not worried about myself, I’m worried about all of you. The End Times is coming, and many will be used as cannon fodder. I planned to make all of you stay with me, but I’m sure you’re aware that we’re all from different races, so your clans or sects will be affected by your decision to stay with me!”

A’Man asked, “Is there really no other way?”

Yang Ye gazed at her and smiled, “Snowy has been by my side through thick and thin for so many years. I would never hand her over, even if I die.”

A’Man fell silent.

Yang Ye wasn’t willing to give up Snowy, so this issue was quite impossible to solve!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye stood up and smiled, “Forget that. Let’s just drink tonight! Haha!”

He picked up the wine jug beside him and took a gulp.

A’Man glanced at him and remained silent.

Yang Ye leaned against the wall and looked at the sky. He couldn’t be emotionless like the Unfettered One in the end. The Unfettered One had no ties, so no one could stop him in this world, but Yang Ye couldn’t do the same.

He had his loved ones and friends.

They were all his ties!

Since he had ties, his sword could naturally not reach its limits. It was his flaw! It wasn’t a flaw in his character, but a flaw in his Sword Dao.

Time trickled by, and the sun appeared on the horizon.

Yang Ye glanced at Yu Jing and the others who were sleeping in the restaurant, and then he left.

Once he left, he was about to leave the city when over a dozen people appeared before the city gates, and they were led by a young man.

Yang Ye glanced at them, “Do you need something?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The young man looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Hand over your immortal crystals!”

They were trying to rob him!

“Haha! You’re being robbed!” Suddenly, roaring laughter came from behind Yang Ye.

Yang Ye turned around and saw Yu Jing and the others.

Yu Jing walked over to Yang Ye, “You didn’t even say anything before leaving!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I wanted to let all of you sleep a while longer!”

“Nonsense!” Yu Jing shook his head, and then he gazed at the young man’s group, “What do you want to do with them?”

At this moment, the young man and the others’ expressions had changed. They couldn’t discern Yang Ye’s strength, but they could discern Yu Jing and the others’ strength. They weren’t existences their group could offend!

Yang Ye gazed at the young man, “What were you doing before this?”

The young man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “The Young City Governor of this city!”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, “Why didn’t you go to Nature Sacred Ground once the spirit energy here dried up?”

“Nature Sacred Ground?” The young man laughed bitterly, “We’ll get killed before we can even get there. We’re only able to survive here because there’s no spirit energy here. Because no one will come to fight for spirit energy here. But if we leave and go somewhere else, we’ll probably die before we even know it!”

Yang Ye couldn’t help but frown.

The human race was in greater chaos that he’d expected!

“The human race’s situation is considerably good!” Meanwhile, A’Man suddenly said, “You possess great prestige in the human race, so your order to make all the organizations help each other allowed the human race to be stable in overall. For example, the demon race, devil race, and some other races are on the verge of complete chaos. Even my barbaric race is the same. The Barbaric King can only maintain the main forces of my race. So long as they don’t fall into chaos, my race won’t fall into chaos. But we can’t do anything about the others below that!”

Yu Jing nodded, “It’s the same for my sky race. The comparatively larger organizations are still able to remain at peace, but those below them are in chaos. The Sovereign of Sky’s orders don’t make a difference at all!”

“Y-You’re Yang Ye?” Suddenly, the young man gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at him and nodded.

Thud!

The young man suddenly knelt down, “King of Man, please help us!”

The others by his side knelt down as well!

“King of Man?” Yang Ye frowned.

“It’s you, of course!” Meanwhile, Qin Chuan suddenly spoke, “You’re the leader of the human race, so you’re called the King of Man.”

.

The King of Man!

Yang Ye shook his head and gazed at the young man. He waved his right hand, and they were instantly made to stand by a gust of wind.

Yang Ye found out from the young man that there had been many people in the city. While the spirit energy here was drying up, the city didn’t fall into chaos. But not long ago, an organization called the Flame Sect came to the city and plundered it.

“The Flame Sect?” Yang Ye frowned, “What is that?”

The man spoke solemnly, “The Flame Sect is the strongest here. When the spirit energy here started to dry up, they started plundering spirit energy and immortal crystals all over there. Anyone who dared to resist would be slaughtered. Our city wasn’t the only victim, all the other organizations in the vicinity suffered the same fate!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Didn’t I give the order for all the organizations in the Human Dimension to help each other?”

The young man laughed bitterly, “You’re far away, so how could you possibly know about what they’re doing here?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he gazed at Qin Chuan, “We have six brothers here who’re from the human race. I have a mission for all of you. Patrol the entire Human Dimension, and kill powerful organizations that are plundering spirit energy. Kill as many as there are. I’ll tell Lianshuang to help you. Alright?”

Qin Chuan nodded, “Leave it to us!”

He paused for a moment and added, “Are we really going to kill them? I’m afraid it’ll bring adverse effects. After all, these things occur quite commonly!”

“Kill them!” Yang Ye closed his eyes, “If we don’t kill them now, it won’t be long before the Human Dimension falls into chaos. At that time, even more will die. Since I’ve become the king of the human race, the human race must do as I say. Now, I want the human race to be united, so it must be united. I won’t spare anyone who dares to take advantage of the situation.”

He was very well aware that he didn’t forcefully put out these kindling flames, they would rage through the entire Human Dimension, and the human race would be beyond saving!

Enemies from the outside weren’t as terrifying as those within!

Qin Chuan nodded, “Alright, we’ll get it done.”

He turned around and left with the others.

Yang Ye gazed at the young man, “I’ll deal with the Flame Sect. Take the others with you and go to Nature Sacred Ground. I’ll get people to keep you safe. Try your best to obey the arrangements made for you once you get there.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “It’s a critical moment now, so I can’t give all of you a promise. All I can say is that I’ll try to find a way out for the human race.”

The young man bowed respectfully to Yang Ye, “We believe you!”

He turned around and left with the others.

“If it was in the past, those fellows would be dead!” Suddenly, A’Man said, “You’ve become benevolent now!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “They have no other choice at a time like this, and they aren’t actually wicked people. It’s just life that forced them to do it!”

A’Man nodded, “Don’t forget about the Alliance of All. You have to find a way to resolve that problem!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he gazed at the others, “Brothers, the End Times is coming. Take care of yourself, and come look for me if you ever need help.”

He flicked a spatial ring to all of them.

They were stunned when they saw its contents.

Every single one of them had 100,000 immortal crystals!

100,000 immortal crystals!

It was a huge amount of wealth at a time like this. It could be said that even their own clans and sects may not be able to produce this much.

Now that they had this, they would be able to survive for a long time, even after the End Times arrived!

However, they fell silent as they gazed at the immortal crystals.

It felt heavy!

It wasn’t that they refused to help Yang Ye, they had no other choice!

Qin Chuan and the others could help Yang Ye openly because they were humans, but the others couldn’t. If they helped Yang Ye, it was very likely to cause trouble for their clans and sects. Moreover, the Alliance of All was the human race’s enemy, so they would be branded as traitors if they helped Yang Ye!

Even someone like A’Man didn’t try to take Yang Ye’s side at a time like this.

They were helpless!

Truly helpless!

…

The Flame Sect.

Yang Ye left the city and arrived at the Flame Sect.

It was situated on a mountain, and it seemed quite grand. It wasn’t a small sect.

Yang Ye went to the air above it and stomped down.

Bang!

The entire Flame Sect shook violently. Countless were shocked, and then over a dozen experts appeared before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye asked, “Who’s the sect master?”

A middle aged man stepped forward, glanced at Yang Ye, and asked, “Who are you?”

Yang Ye said, “From now onward, change your ways and stop plundering, alright?”

The middle aged man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “You’re here to look for trouble!”

Yang Ye looked the middle aged man in the eyes, “Yes or no?”

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he said, “Tell them that someone is here to look for trouble!”

An old man by his side nodded and withdrew a transmission stone.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Suddenly, besides the middle aged man, the heads of all the others just suddenly flew up into the air.

The middle aged man was stunned on the spot.

Suddenly, a ray of red light appeared, and then a red palm stretched out from behind Yang Ye and claws at him.

Yang Ye turned around, and he frowned when he saw the person before him, “It’s you!”
