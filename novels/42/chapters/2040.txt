Chapter 2041 – A Thousandfold!

The old man couldn’t help but glance at Yang Ye when he heard this.

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath. He took the card, glanced at it, and said, “Tell me about the Guardian Line!”

The old man nodded, “The Guardian Line is a huge line in our Weapon Path, and its duty is to guard the Weapon Path. They’re quite close to the Prediction Line. If they hadn’t just stood by idly, our Slaughter Line wouldn’t have fallen to such a state!”

Yang Ye immediately came to an understanding when he heard this. Just as the old man had said, the Guardian Line clearly didn’t have good intentions when it gave him this invitation.

Meanwhile, the old man added, “You must be careful of a person when you go there. His name is Nie Yuan. He’s the personal disciple of the Guardian Line’s Seal Master. While he’s part of the younger generation as well, he’s at the Minor Zen Realm. So, you must be careful!”

“The Minor Zen Realm?” Yang Ye gazed at the old man, “What’s that?”

Elder Yuan explained, “The Zen Realm is divided into the Minor Zen Realm, Major Zen Realm, and Half-Step Sage Realm. Based on your strength, ordinary Zen Realm experts are probably not a match for you. However, you must be careful of the Major Zen Realm, and you must not be careless against them. As for Half-Step Sage Realm experts, you can’t rival the strength of such experts right now!”

The Half-Step Sage Realm!

Yang Ye nodded. He knew that the masked old man who stayed by Ji Yue’s side was probably a Half-Step Sage Realm expert, and that old man felt unfathomable to him.

“As for the Sage Realm…” Elder Yuan continued, “You probably don’t have the strength to fight back against such experts right now. But don’t worry, experts at that level will not act against you in the Weapon Dimension. So, you have to worry about Half-Step Sage Realm experts!”

Yang Ye frowned, “Elder Yuan, if a Half-Step Sage Realm expert attacks me, it’s considered bullying, right?”

Elder Yuan shook his head, “It depends on the circumstances. If even a Major Zen Realm expert can’t harm you, then they will definitely send Half-Step Sage Realm experts. In short, you have to be mentally prepared for the possibility!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and asked, “Do I have anyone to rely on?”

“Yes!” Elder Yuan was very certain.

Yang Ye asked, “Who? That Young Martial uncle?”

Elder Yuan replied, “He’s one of them!”

Yang Ye’s eyes lit up, “What about another? Is it you?”

Elder Yuan replied indifferently, “You must be dreaming. I haven’t fought in many years. Actually, strictly speaking, that other person may not be someone you can rely on. Unless you can make that person think that the Slaughter Line has a future and hope. Only then will that person disregard everything and help you!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “In the end, I still have to rely on myself!”

Elder Yuan nodded, “Indeed!”

Yang Ye didn’t say another word. He just left with the invitation.

Meanwhile, Elder Yuan looked down, and nobody knew what he was thinking.

In the sky above Gracious Mountain, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and vanished into the sky.

As far as Yang Ye was concerned, he had no way out, and he could only take this path to its end. However, he wasn’t one to just suffer. How could he possibly work without receiving any payment?

Guardian Mountain.

Yang Ye could see Guardian Mountain from far away. It was a huge mountain. It wasn’t floating in the air like Gracious Mountain, and it was on the ground. The entire mountain was square and very neat. Flying swords were frequently flashing around it.

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment, and then he transformed into a ray of light that arrived at the foot of Guardian Mountain. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

As soon as he arrived there, a young man around the age of 20 appeared before Yang Ye.

The young man shouted, “Name yourself!”

Yang Ye flicked a golden card to the young man. The latter glanced at it, and then his expression changed slightly. He gazed at Yang Ye, “You’re the new Seal Master of the Slaughter Line?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The young man sized up Yang Ye carefully and ridiculed, “A mere Hear Dao Realm can be a Seal Master? Tsk, tsk. The Slaughter Line seems to be…”

Suddenly, his voice stopped because a hand had wrapped around his throat.

The young man’s face instantly turned pale.

Yang Ye raised the young man off the guard, “Am I worthy now?”

The young man stared at Yang Ye and didn’t really seem capable of speaking.

“Stop!” Suddenly, a furious shout resounded.

Yang Ye looked towards the source of the voice. A young man with a sword was glaring at him from not too far away.

Yang Ye ignored the young man and looked at the young man in his grasp, “I asked you a question. Didn’t you hear me?”

The young man stared at him. Obviously, he was confident that he would be safe, or perhaps, he wasn’t afraid of his own safety.

Crack!

The sound of bones breaking resounded.

The young man wasn’t dead, but his entire body had stiffened. Yang Ye had controlled his strength, so while the young man hadn’t died in an instant, he was on the verge of it. Yang Ye just had to use a little bit of strength, just a little bit, and the young man would die.

The young man with the sword had a gloomy expression on his face, and then his sword moved. He was about to attack when a woman in a white dress who seemed to be around the age of 20 suddenly appeared in front of him.

She spoke indifferently, “Stand down!”

The young man spoke gloomily, “Senior Sister Mo You, please permit me to attack and kill him! I…”

Suddenly, Mo You gazed at the young man, “I told you to stand down! Didn’t you hear me?”

The young man with a sword’s expression changed slightly when he noticed that she was slightly furious. He didn’t dare to say anything else and just nodded before moving aside. However, his gaze was still fixed on Yang Ye.

Mo You gazed at Yang Ye, “You’re a Seal Master at any rate. Isn’t it quite beneath you to make a fuss about things with them?”

Yang Ye smiled, “You’re right!”

Yang Ye immediately released the young man once he finished speaking. The young man immediately started coughing violently, but all he coughed out was blood.

Yang Ye walked over to Mo You. Suddenly, the young man looked up at Yang Ye, “I’ll definitely repay you a thousandfold for this humiliation!”

A ray of light flashed.

Hiss!

The young man’s head flew up into the air while accompanied by a pillar of blood.

Thud!

The young man’s head fell to the ground, and his eyes were opened wide. There was disbelief in them because even until the moment he died, he didn’t believe that Yang Ye would dare to kill him here!

It was exactly because he thought Yang Ye wouldn’t dare to kill him that he’d dared to threaten Yang Ye. He wanted to make himself seem a little courageous, but he hadn’t expected that instead of making a show of strength, all it had done was take his life.

He died with everlasting regret!

The young man’s eyes were wide open even after he was dead!

Meanwhile, the woman, Mo You, just gazed at Yang Ye in silence.

Yang Ye walked slowly over to Mo You and said, “You want to attack me?”

Mo You nodded slightly, “I do!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth curled up slightly, “So long as you dare to attack, I guarantee that your head will definitely drop to your feet. I guarantee it.”

Mo You’s eyes narrowed slightly while killing intent surged within them.

Suddenly, roaring laughter came from the side, “So it’s Brother Yang!”

Yang Ye turned to look, and a young man in a luxurious robe appeared there. The young man seemed to be over the age of 20, but he had a small goatee, and it made him seem a little more mature.

The young man walked swiftly over to Yang Ye and smiled, “Allow me to introduce myself. The Guardian Line’s Su Lang. I was the one who sent you the invitation. Come, let’s talk up the mountain.”

Suddenly, the young man with the sword spoke, “He killed someone just now!”

Su Lang chuckled, “That’s not a big deal at all. I kill every day. It’s nothing.” He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Brother Yang, come with me. Let me introduce the other geniuses of my Weapon Path to you!”

Yang Ye glanced at Su Lang and smiled, “Perfect!”

As soon as he finished speaking, they started walking up the mountain. They chatted happily as they traveled, and they seemed like a pair of friends who hadn’t met for many years.

Meanwhile, the young man with the sword spoke angrily, “What does he mean by that? Yang Ye openly killed one of us, but Senior Brother Su intends to turn a blind eye?”

Mo You glanced at the young man, “You’re really lacking in the brain department!”

The young man’s face was quite unsightly, “What are you trying to say?”

Mo You combed her hair behind her ear and spoke softly, “He’s someone that Young Martial Uncle of ours selected, and he chose him to rebuild the Slaughter Line. Or perhaps, it’s to fight the Prediction Line. It can be said that it’s something between them and the Prediction Line. If we attack and kill him, the Prediction Line will definitely be overjoyed. Because they won’t have to worry about Young Martial Uncle looking for trouble with them. At that time, if Young Martial Uncle wants to avenge him, then tell me, besides our ancestor, can anyone else in our Weapon Path stop him from doing as he pleases?”

The young man fell silent.

Mo You continued, “However, Senior Brother Su Lang will definitely not make it easy for him. Even the Prediction Line has to give our Guardian Line some face. Who does Yang Ye think he is? He’ll pay for killing someone here! Let’s just wait and see!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Mo You turned around and vanished on the spot.

The young man glanced at the corpse and shook his head, “You would still be alive if you knew what not to say. But this is good too. If you didn’t step forward to do it, I may have been the one to die. Rest in peace!”

The young man turned around and left once he finished speaking!
