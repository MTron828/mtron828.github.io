Chapter 1743 - It’s Time For The Old To Be Replaced!

The Yang Clan!

Yang Ye didn’t want to run, and he couldn’t.

The enmity between him and the Yang Clan had to be put to an end.

If he waited for the Yang Clan to come for him, then he would lose the initiative, and he would be forced to suffer the Yang Clan’s pursuit. So, he’d decided to attack himself.

Of course, he wouldn’t go to the Yang Clan and fight them head-on. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

With his current speed, the concealment provided by the Sword Domain, and the assistance from the Laws of Speed and the Spatial Laws, even a 6th stage True Realm expert couldn’t find him if he wanted to stay hidden.

…

Heaven Void Continent.

Yang Ye had used the Divine Yin Flame to incinerate Phecda City that day, but the Yang Clan had rebuilt the city in just a few months. It wasn’t difficult for the Yang Clan to accomplish such a feat with its strength.

At this moment, Phecda City was calm and peaceful on the surface, but a storm was brewing.

Silent!

After one of the Yang Clan’s ancestors emerged from his closed door cultivation, he’d immediately started reorganizing the Yang Clan. So, a rebel like Yang Lianshuang and those who followed her were imprisoned.

Besides that, the Yang Clan started using all the resources available to it to find Yang Ye.

Compared to Yang Lianshuang, Yang Ye was the true potential problem for the Yang Clan. After all, Yang Lianshuang just wanted to be the patriarch and not overturn the Yang Clan. But Yang Ye was different. If Yang Ye was allowed to grow stronger, then he would definitely overturn the Yang Clan!

Yang Ye had to die!

As far as the Yang Clan was concerned, there was no room for reconciliation.

At this point, trying to reconcile with Yang Ye and make him return to the Yang Clan was impossible. They would never let him return to the Yang Clan, and they would dare to let him. The Yang Clan was already on the verge of being unable to restrain Yang Ye. Once he grew even stronger and tried to get even then, would anyone in the Yang Clan be able to stop him?

The Yang Clan didn’t have a choice now!

…

Dawn.

When the first glimmer of light appeared on the horizon, a black shadow snuck into Phecda City without making a sound. It was Yang Ye of course.

The fierce tiger wasn’t the most terrifying existence in an ordinary forest; the most terrifying existence in an ordinary forest was the venomous snake that hid in the shadows. Such snakes waited for their prey to arrive by their side, and then they struck a lethal blow.

Yang Ye planned to be such a venomous snake!

He couldn’t fight the Yang Clan in direct combat, so he had no choice but to play tricks!

This time, his main objective was to rescue Yang Lianshuang. So long as he rescued her, he would have more help. So, killing was his secondary objective, and saving her was his primary objective.

The Immortal Phoenix Pavilion.

A woman was seated cross-legged on the bed in a room. Her eyes were closed, and she was cultivating.

She was Yang Ye’s aunt, Yang Xuan.

Suddenly, she opened her eyes, “Who is it?!”

An instant later, a black robed man appeared before her. It was naturally Yang Ye.

Yang Xuan gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before she asked, “Why have you returned here?” Obviously, she recognized him.

Yang Ye replied, “I don’t want to waste my time! Where’s Yang Lianshuang?”

Yang Xuan appeared in front of Yang Ye and said, “If you choose to flee, then based on the strength you possess, the Yang Clan wouldn’t be able to do anything to you. But you’ve returned. Do you really think you can fight the Yang Clan?”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “Where’s Yang Lianshuang?”

Yang Xuan gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before she said, “The Sky Prison! It’s where the members of the Yang Clan who’ve committed serious crimes are kept.”

Yang Ye asked, “How do I get there?”

Yang Xuan shook her head slightly, “You can’t save her, and she doesn’t need you to save her. Listen to me and leave Heaven Void Continent right now. Leave the Milky Way System and go far away. Don’t get yourself mixed up in the Yang Clan’s business.’

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “Since the moment you went to look for me, it was impossible for me to avoid getting mixed up in the Yang Clan’s business. If you really want to help me, then tell me where the Sky Prison is. As for everything else, just save it. Because it doesn’t make a difference!”

She fell silent for a long time before she flicked a ray of light towards Yang Ye, and it entered his forehead.

It didn’t take long for some information to appear in Yang Ye’s mind, and it was the location of the Sky Prison.

“Thank you!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye was about to leave.

However, Yang Xuan suddenly asked, “Where’s your father?”

“Who knows!” Yang Ye vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Yang Xuan remained silent on the spot.

…

The Sky Prison was situated 3km underground beneath Phecda City, and it was considered the number one forbidden area of the Yang Clan. Because those who committed grave crimes in the Yang Clan were imprisoned there. If nothing unexpected happened, all of them would be imprisoned until the day they died.

Yang Ye traveled along the path Yang Xuan provided him and snuck into the prison. It was divided into three levels, and every level had a formation. However, those formations were useless against Yang Ye.

Yang Lianshuang was being held on the 3rd level.

All along the way, Yang Ye noticed that the people being imprisoned here were quite strong, and the weakest amongst them was at the Zenith Realm! However, there weren’t many of them. The 1st level had around ten prisoners, and the 2nd level had even fewer. There were only four prisoners on the 2nd level.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to get to the 3rd level.

There were only two people in the 3rd level, and it was a slovenly middle aged man and Yang Lianshuang.

When he arrived in the 3rd level, both the middle aged man and Yang Lianshuang opened their eyes simultaneously.

Yang Lianshuang said, “You’re here!”

Yang Ye walked out from the shadows, glanced at the surroundings, and then gazed at her. He noticed a black circle of light on the ground below her. Moreover, Yang Lianshuang wasn’t the only one who had such a black circle of light below her, it was the same for the middle aged man as well.

“Energy Prisons!” Yang Lianshuang explained, “It can restrain a person’s profound energy, causing that person to lose his or her cultivation.”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and looked her in the eyes, “Why?”

She gazed at him for a long time before she said, “Looks like you’ve noticed.”

As soon as she finished speaking, a black circle of light appeared below Yang Ye. In an instant, he felt like his profound energy had fallen into deep sleep, and he couldn’t mobilize it no matter what.

Meanwhile, the space around him trembled, and then over a dozen figures appeared here.

The person who led the group was none other than the Yang Clan’s current patriarch, Yang Xiao!

A trap!

It was a trap!

Actually, Yang Ye had felt something was off when he entered the 3rd level. Because he hadn’t encountered any obstruction all along the way. Just think about it. How could the prison for these experts of the Yang Clan be that easy to enter?

At that moment, he’d intended to leave, but it was too late. Because Yang Lianshuang had noticed his presence!

Sure enough, it was a trap! A trap laid out just for him!

Yang Xiao spoke indifferently, “Yang Ye! We’ve been waiting for you!”

Yang Ye ignored Yang Xiao and gazed at Yang Lianshuang, “Why?” He didn’t really understand why she would work with the Yang Clan to lead him into a trap.

She replied with a question, “Why did you come to save me?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “It’s all meaningless now. I just don’t understand why you would help the Yang Clan. Can you tell me why?”

“I’ll tell you!” Yang Xiao suddenly said, “Because she’s the Yang Clan’s successor now. Understand?”

The Yang Clan’s successor! Yang Ye glanced at her. At this moment, he understood everything. So, the Yang Clan had made a compromise, and so had she.

Now, Yang Lianshuang and the Yang Clan were on the same side.

Meanwhile, Yang Xiao suddenly said, “Yang Ye, you’re actually a true genius. If it wasn’t for your father, my Yang Clan would definitely focus its efforts on fostering you, and you’ll definitely be the next patriarch of my Yang Clan. Unfortunately…”

Yang Ye chuckled and glanced at Yang Xiao and all the other experts of the Yang Clan who were present here, “This is quite the force you’ve brought. However, just these few True Realm experts aren’t really enough to kill me. Where’s that ancestor of your clan?”

“He hasn’t emerged from his closed door cultivation!” Yang Lianshuang suddenly said, “It was just a trick. Experts like them only emerge from their closed door cultivation when it’s a moment of life and death for the Yang Clan.”

Yang Ye gazed at Yang Lianshuang, “So, your goal was to lure me here?”

Yang Lianshuang nodded, “Exactly.”

Meanwhile, Yang Xiao suddenly said, “Yang Ye, I have a question. Your father was exiled all those years ago, and we thought he perished. However, it seems like he’s still alive. Since he’s alive, where is he?”

Yang Ye’s father!

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye. After all, Yang Ye’s father was like a god in the Yang Clan all those years ago!

Yang Ye chuckled, “What? All of you intend to kill him?”

Yang Xiao spoke indifferently, “I’m just asking!”

Yang Ye shrugged and didn’t say anything. A moment later, the Primordial Pagoda shook violently, and then the profound energy within him instantly started surging. Once his profound energy could be used again, a ray of light flashed.

Bang!

In an instant, the black circle of light below Yang Ye was blasted apart.

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “That formation is pretty bad!”

Yang Xiao gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then he said, “As expected, it can’t suppress you. But that’s fine. No one will be able to save you today!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand. The walls in the surroundings instantly started moving, and then beams of light shot towards Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly when he saw the beams of light. Because the energy they contained made him feel a sense of danger!

Yang Ye’s left wrist moved slightly, and then a beam of light shattered. However, he was pushed backwards repeatedly. After that, countless beams of light arrived before him and sealed off all his paths of retreat.

Meanwhile, Yang Xiao suddenly gazed at Yang Lianshuang, “Kill him and you’ll be both the Yang Clan’s successor and the next patriarch of the Yang Clan!”

Yang Lianshuang nodded slightly, and then the black phoenix claw on her neck trembled. An instant later, she vanished on the spot.

However, she hadn’t charged at Yang Ye. She’d appeared before Yang Xiao, and then a bolt of black lightning instantly flashed towards Yang Xiao.

Yang Xiao’s expression changed, and he immediately slammed his left fist forward.

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and then Yang Xiao was blasted backwards. He only stopped moving backwards when his figure struck against the wall.

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang started walking slowly in Yang Xiao and the others’ direction, “It’s time for the old of the Yang Clan to be replaced by the young!”
