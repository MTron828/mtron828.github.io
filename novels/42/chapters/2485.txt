Chapter 2486 – No!

Yang Ye was no fool. So, how could he have not noticed that the woman had been acting strangely?

However, he couldn’t be bothered to expose her. Or it should be said that he wanted to give her a chance to change her ways. Unfortunately, she hadn’t cherished that opportunity. Besides that, he really wanted to meet this Elder Li!

Elder Li had the ability to get him into the Ancient Sword Sect!

The beautiful woman and Elder Li frowned when they heard him.

Especially the woman, there was only vigilance left in her eyes.

Yang Ye smiled, “Didn’t you want to rob me? Come on then!”

She gazed at him for a long time, and then she waved her right hand. Three black clothed figures appeared around Yang Ye.

All of them were at the Limitbreaker Realm!

She gazed coldly at Yang Ye, “Kill him!”

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

As soon as she gave the order, both she and Elder Li watched with shock as the heads of all three black clothed experts flew into the air!

They had just flown into the air!

Even the woman and Elder Li hadn’t been able to discern how those heads were taken!

At this moment, the woman’s face was ghastly pale. She knew that they’d bitten off more than they could chew!

As for Elder Li, his face was extremely solemn.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “If I’m not wrong, you chose this place because there aren’t any people here. So, no one would know about anything you’ve done here, right?”

He suddenly gazed at Elder Li, “Don’t bother sending news of this through space. I’ve locked down the space here, so you can’t send anything out!”

Elder Li’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Who are you?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t want to waste my breath on you. I need to get into the Ancient Sword Sect, so give me something that proves I’ve gained a spot!”

“You plan to sneak into the Ancient Sword Sect!” Elder Li’s face was gloomy, “Who are you?!”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Swish!

A ray of light flashed.

Hiss!

Elder Li’s arm flew up into the air while blood sprayed like a fountain!

The beautiful woman’s face turned even paler from the sight of this. She’d still been hopeful earlier. She felt that Elder Li definitely had the strength to fight this young man!

However, the cruel truth before her made it clear that he didn’t!

Elder Li’s eyes were filled with shock. Just a moment ago, he’d actually been unable to sense that sword energy at all!

Was the young man before him at the Five World Realm?

Yang Ye walked slowly in Elder Li’s direction, “I need a spot to join the Ancient Sword Sect. Do I need to repeat myself?”

Elder Li stared at Yang Ye, “Don’t even think about it!”

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled. Meanwhile, Sword Scroll’s voice resounded in his mind, “He has the Ancient Sword Token, just get that!”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Yang Ye nodded. Meanwhile, Elder Li turned around and fled toward the sky. He was extremely swift and instantly arrived over 10km away. However, a ray of sword energy was faster than him!

Hiss!

The ray of sword energy flashed, and then Elder Li’s head fell off his neck.

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and Elder Li’s spatial ring flew over to him. Sure enough, he found a command token in there.

The Ancient Sword Token!

Yang Ye put it away. As for everything else, all of it was trash to him. He may not have learned much from Snowy, but he’d learned to be picky.

As far as Snowy was concerned, there were few things in this world that were up to her standards!

Yang Ye put the command token away and glanced at the beautiful woman, “Why haven’t you tried to flee?”

She laughed miserably, “Can I?”

She took a deep breath and continued, “Before I die, can you tell me who you are?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “No!”

Yang Ye’s sword descended, and her head flew into the air!

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and all the corpses here were turned to ash.

Yang Ye shook his head, “Robbing is risky and should be done cautiously!”

Yang Ye vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye returned to Ancient Sword City. This time, he didn’t return to the inn, and he went to a place called Ancient Sword Hall instead. Once he presented the command token, the manager before the door welcomed him inside!

Yang Ye saw a man and a woman in the hall.

The man wore a white robe, and he immediately glanced at Yang Ye when Yang Ye entered. A moment later, he moved his gaze away.

As for the woman, she nodded slightly to Yang Ye as a way to greet him.

Yang Ye nodded as well and sat at the side.

None of them spoke.

A long time passed before the man suddenly asked, “Manager Xu, when will Elder Li be here?”

An old man walked in and laughed bitterly, “Young Master Mo Yu, I do not know.”

The man called Mo Yu frowned, “You can’t just make us wait here forever, right?”

The old man hesitated for a moment and said, “Let me try contacting him!”

He turned around and left.

Only Yang Ye and the others remained in the hall.

Mo Yu glanced at Yang Ye and asked, “The True Void Realm?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Yes!”

Mo Yu moved his gaze away and didn’t say anything else. It was because he was at the True World Realm.

They weren’t on the same level, so there was naturally nothing to speak about.

The woman, on the other hand, spoke abruptly, “I’m at the True Void Realm too.”

Yang Ye grinned at her, “What’s your name?”

“Yue Qingwu!” She smiled, “What about you?”

Yang Ye replied, “Ye Yang.”

Ye Yang!

She nodded and asked, “Are you from the Ye Clan in the South Region?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m just an independent cultivator!”

An independent cultivator!

“Oh!” She didn’t say more than that.

Yang Ye didn’t say anything either and just waited in silence.

Meanwhile, he asked inwardly, “Sword Scroll, why has the Ancient Sword Sect been keeping the fragments of your body?”

She fell silent for a short while and explained, “It’s still the fragments of a Super Divine Treasure. What else can they do? Toss it away?”

Yang Ye asked, “Is the Ancient Sword Sect’s Master from all those years ago still alive?”

She replied, “Yes. But he was heavily injured by the Desolate Emperor, and even his body was destroyed. It can be said that his strength isn’t what it used to be. Of course, I don’t know how much he has recovered over the years. That’s why I wanted you to sneak in, and then look for an opportunity to steal my fragments.”

Yang Ye nodded, “That’s all we can do.”

Just like that, the three of them waited for around two hours in the hall, and then a middle aged man appeared. They gazed at the middle aged man, and the latter said, “I’m Gu Xiu, an elder of the Ancient Sword Sect. Now, I’m in charge here.”

They bowed slightly to him, and then Mo Yu asked, “Senior, what about Elder Li?”

Gu Xiu replied indifferently, “Something has happened to him, and the sect has started investigating the matter. Now, come with me to the Ancient Sword Sect. Right, show me your Ancient Sword Tokens!”

All three of them produced a token!

Once he verified them, Gu Xiu nodded, “Let’s go!”

Just like that, he led them out of the city.

They shot swiftly through the clouds on their swords. Yang Ye was using an energy sword and not his own swords. It was because he only had Divine Treasures or a Super Divine Treasure to use as his sword, and that would draw too much attention.

Mo Yu glanced at Yang Ye, and then he flicked a sword over to Yang Ye.

A Pseudo Divine Treasure!

Yang Ye gazed at Mo Yu with bewilderment, and the latter spoke indifferently, “You can keep it!”

He naturally had to make friends in the Ancient Sword Sect. While the young man before him wasn’t worth becoming friends with, he could still make Yang Ye side with him. It wasn’t bad to have some lackeys and people to do things for you in the Ancient Sword Sect!

Yang Ye glanced at Mo Yu and shook his head, “I don’t need it!”

Mo Yu frowned, took the sword back, and then said, “How insensible!”

He sped up and left both Yang Ye and Yue Qingwu far behind.

Yue Qingwu flew over to Yang Ye’s side and smiled, “That was a Pseudo Divine Treasure! Why didn’t you accept it?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t need it. Why?”

She sized up Yang Ye and smiled, “Interesting. Anyway, you’re here for the Ancient Sword Sect’s renowned Ancient Sword Scroll, right?”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “The Ancient Sword Scroll?”

She replied with a question, “You don’t know about it?”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Sword Scroll suddenly explained, “It’s a sword scroll that I created. It’s trash to you because your flying swords and Sword Domain have completely surpassed the scope of that technique. Besides that, I know practically everything in the Ancient Sword Sect, and I even know things that those old geezers are unaware of. So, I’ll tell you if there’s anything suitable for you!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright!”

Meanwhile, Yue Qingwu asked again, “You don’t know about the Ancient Sword Scroll?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Of course I do. It’s a divine treasure. But we probably won’t have the chance, right?”

She smiled, “How would we know without giving it a try? Moreover, I heard the Ancient Sword Sect has a Super Divine Treasure, the Sword Hall, Sword Book, and Sword Scroll. The three of them are one. It would be great if I could have the chance to see it. It’s a Super Divine Treasure!”

Yang Ye frowned and spoke solemnly in his heart, “Looks like the Ancient Sword Sect didn’t allow news of it to escape their sect!”

Sword Scroll replied indifferently, “A single Super Divine Treasure can deter many. So, they naturally wouldn’t. The world thinks I’m still in the Ancient Sword Sect right now!”

Yang Ye said, “Forget that. Once I get those fragments, we’ll leave the Ancient Sword Sect. Then Snowy can repair your body once she returns.”

Sword Scroll fell silent for a moment and said, “Thank you!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I should be the one thanking you. Alright, let’s not linger on this.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he opened his eyes, and he saw a huge sword floating in the distant sky.

However, he was stunned by the sight of it.

Wasn’t it the Executor that was in his possession?

What the heck?!
