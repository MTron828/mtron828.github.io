Chapter 2259 – Yang Wudi’s Backup Plan!

The Samadhi Flame!

It was a flame strong enough to incinerate the large universe!

Once it appeared, even Master Tian had a solemn expression on his face. At this moment, even he sensed danger.

Extreme danger!

“Kill!” Suddenly, Yang Ye tapped his right foot down.

Hiss!

The space below his feet turned ethereal, and then a strand of flames flashed.

Master Tian spoke solemnly, “Watch out!”

Meanwhile, an Undead Warrior stepped forward, and then an afterimage flashed.

Bang!

A terrifying wave of energy rippled through space, and then a black shadow was blasted away. That black shadow even had faint flames around it.

Master Tian’s expression changed at the sight of this, and he flashed over to the Undead Warrior and pressed his right palm down toward the Undead Warrior. Countless strands of black energy sprayed out from his palm, but the black energy was obliterated upon approaching that Undead Warrior.

Master Tian’s pupils constricted. He withdrew his palm and said, “I can’t save you!”

The Undead Warrior nodded slightly, and then flames appeared from within him!

Soul ignition!

After he ignited his soul, the Undead Warrior’s aura instantly rose explosively, and it was many times greater than before. A moment later, he slammed his saber at Yang Ye.

Crack!

The space in a huge area cracked open in an instant!

An attack after soul ignition!

Bang!

A rumbling explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was blasted far away.

As soon as he stabilized himself, a strand of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth. At the same time, Yang Ye’s body cracked open and blood flowed out incessantly, but it only took a moment for his wounds to be rapidly healed by the Primordial Violet Energy.

While Yang Ye had been heavily injured by this, the Undead Warrior was gone forever!

At this moment, Yang Ye finally understood what Tian Xiu meant when she said they were very strong. These Undead Warriors weren’t just strong, they weren’t afraid of death! That Undead Warrior had been struck by the Samadhi Flame, but Yang Ye could sense that the Undead Warrior wasn’t afraid at all.

The Undead Warrior wasn’t afraid of death at all!

Yang Ye glanced at the nine remaining Undead Warriors, fell silent for a short while, and then closed his eyes. A moment later, he vanished on the spot.

Suddenly, five Undead Warriors took steps forward and swung their sabers.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Boom!

The others here weren’t even able to see what had happened when Yang Ye was blasted away again.

Meanwhile, the five of them took a step forward again and swung their sabers once more.

Hiss!

The five sabers created five rays of saber energy!

Saber energy that were thin as the hair on an ox!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly while a vicious glow flashed through them, and then his figure flashed while he swung both the Sword Supreme and Sword Precursor forward.

Hiss!

A wave of flames rippled out from his sword. In an instant, the space before him was transformed into an ocean of flames. Meanwhile, the five Undead Warriors’ saber energy arrived within the ocean of flames.

As soon as they came into contact with the Samadhi Flames, they instantly turned ethereal!

However, those rays of saber energy were extremely strong too. At the instant they turned ethereal, they had sliced through the ocean of flames! However, they weren’t able to arrive in front of Yang Ye before being incinerated into nothingness.

Meanwhile, a sword howl resounded from within the ocean of flames, and then a ray of sword energy shot toward them.

The five Undead Warriors suddenly formed a straight line.

Their sabers flashed!

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

In the air, five ethereal sabers suddenly appeared, and then they slashed down.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

At this instant, the entire world was sliced open by their attacks, and the powerful force within them even sliced Yang Ye’s ocean of flames into bits. However, while they may have sliced Yang Ye’s ocean of flames into bits, they were incinerated into nothingness as well.

The Samadhi Flame!

Besides the few divine treasures that were on par with it, there was nothing it couldn’t incinerate.

Master Tian’s expression turned gloomy from the sight of this. The strength of the flames Yang Ye revealed was beyond his expectations!

However, Yang Ye clearly couldn’t do anything to those Undead Warriors!

The five Undead Warriors could overcome his Samadhi Flame, so while they couldn’t harm him, he couldn’t harm them either!

No one could harm anyone!

But at this moment, almost half the experts of the undying race had gone through the portal.

Yang Ye knew he couldn’t delay any longer!

Yang Ye gazed at An Nanjing, and the latter nodded slightly. A moment later, they appeared side-by-side, and then they simultaneously vanished on the spot. Right when they vanished, the five Undead Warriors took a step forward again, and then they swung their sabers in unison.

Their sabers rose and descended at the same time!

Bang!

The space around Yang Ye and the others exploded apart. Countless strands of flames and saber energy sprayed toward the surroundings, and the powerful aftershock of it caused the entire expanse of black holes to tremble.

Retreat!

The experts from the large universe retreated.

Meanwhile, Elder Yuan and the others had extremely solemn expressions on their faces.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s strength was naturally beyond doubt. Both of them were extraordinary geniuses, and their strength was extraordinary too. There were few in the world capable of being a match for them. However, they were being forcefully stopped by those seven Undead Warriors of the undying race.

While they weren’t at a disadvantage, it would be extremely disadvantageous to them if this continued.

Elder Yuan remained silent for a moment, and then he gazed at the Demonspawn. The latter nodded slightly, and then it transformed into a ray of black light that shot at the nine Undead Warriors. However, it hadn’t even gotten close to the battlefield when Master Tian appeared before him.

“You’re courting death!” The Demonspawn howled with fury and slapped his claw at Master Tian. The latter didn’t fear the Demonspawn at all, and a wave of powerful energy instantly rippled at the Demonspawn.

Bang! Bang!

Explosions rumbled through space.

Elder Yuan’s face remained gloomy as he watched. Because while the Demonspawn was strong, Master Tian seemed even stronger. So, while the Demonspawn wouldn’t be defeated, it couldn’t harm Master Tian either!

Elder Yuan gazed at the door of light. There were two more Undead Warriors there, and they were guarding the portal!

Suddenly, Sky Maiden said, “I’ll do it!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she intended to attack, but Elder Yuan shook his head, “No!”

She gazed at him, and he spoke softly, “Even if you go there, you can’t do anything to them. It’s meaningless!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he looked toward Yang Ye and An Nanjing. The battle there was extremely intense. At this moment, Yang Ye and An Nanjing were facing seven Undead Warriors, and their joint forces were something that even Yang Ye and An Nanjing were helpless against!

The undying race was obviously extremely confident in them since they had allowed these Undead Warriors to guard this place!

Elder Yuan frowned slightly and spoke softly, “Is this situation really impossible to resolve?”

Bang!

Suddenly, a powerful strand of energy came from far away, and it was so strong that all the experts here were visibly moved!

All of them separated a little of their attention and directed it toward that powerful energy. It didn’t take long for it to arrive here, and then Master Tian’s expression changed drastically. Because its target was actually those seven Undead Warriors!

It wasn’t an expert from the undying race!

Bang!

It enveloped the Undead Warriors, and coupled with Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s strength, those Undead Warriors were blasted far away!

At this moment, the surroundings fell silent.

Everyone looked toward the battlefield, and it didn’t take long for them to see a middle aged man!

The Martial Emperor!

The previous Martial God of this large universe!

Yang Ye frowned and was quite surprised to see the Martial Emperor. He hadn’t expected him to show up at this moment, and he hadn’t expected him to help. As far as Yang Ye was concerned, the Martial Emperor didn’t pay any attention to the affairs of the world!

The Martial Emperor walked over to Yang Ye and An Nanjing. He glanced at them and smiled, “Both of you are amazing. You’ve attained such strength in such a short while! As expected of the most monstrous geniuses of this large universe!”

Yang Ye was quite puzzled, “Senior…”

The Martial Emperor glanced at the surroundings and gazed at Yang Ye, “Do you know why your father helped me take after Martial Emperor Academy?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

The Martial Emperor smiled, “I made an agreement with him to help you at a critical moment. Of course, if you don’t need my help, you can refuse, and I’ll help you another time.”

Yang Wudi!

Yang Ye slowly closed his eyes. Yang Wudi again! Yang Wudi had really done too much for him!

Meanwhile, the Martial Emperor glanced at the surroundings and said, “I’ve seen who I wanted to see, so staying is meaningless to me now.”

Yang Ye asked, “You’re leaving too?”

The Martial Emperor nodded, “I should.”

Yang Ye asked, “Through the portal?” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“The portal?” The Martial Emperor smiled, “Do you know how the Unfettered One left?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

The Martial Emperor looked up and said, “He left by tearing through space. He forcefully tore through space with his sword and entered the boundless unknown.’

Yang Ye frowned, “It’s that simple?” After all, he could tear open space too.

“Simple?” The Martial Emperor chuckled, “Tearing open space is easy, of course. However, he isn’t just tearing open one expanse of space, he’s tearing open all the space that stands before him… How far is it from this large universe to the initial race’s universe? I don’t know. All I do know is that he may use his sword to forcefully slash his way to the universe of the initial race!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
