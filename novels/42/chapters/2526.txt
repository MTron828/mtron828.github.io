Chapter 2527 – Can I Act First?

Unmatched!

Yang Ye was stunned and asked, “Why?”

Sword Scroll replied indifferently, “You’ll find out soon!”

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, put the scroll away, and then gazed at Elder Xue. She flicked a few more scrolls to him.

Elder Xue explained, “These are all records on the sect’s members, including the inner court disciples, outer court disciples, elite disciples, and some other unique existences. You have the right to give orders to them all. However, you must discuss it with the Grand Elder and me before giving them orders. It’s never a good thing to make any decisions on your own, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Of course!”

Elder Xue nodded and said, “One of the ten top abodes at the rear mountains is yours. There will be 3 Five World Realm experts protecting you at all times. When you leave the sect, the experts of the sect will be protecting you too. You…”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “All of that isn’t necessary.”

She was puzzled, “Huh?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Elder Xue, I don’t need to grow beneath your protection. People who do that cannot avoid becoming reliant on such protection. I don’t want that to happen to me.”

She gazed at him for a long time and said, “Alright, I’ll make the arrangements! Do you need anything else?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Nothing!”

Needless to say, it was the first time he’d received such treatment, and it felt pretty nice!

Elder Xue nodded, “You’re the junior sect master now, so you have many special privileges in the sect. You’ll find out about them in time. Besides that, don’t forget that by becoming the junior sect master, there will be some things that you must deal with. Of course, we won’t allow these things to occupy all your time and delay your cultivation. You’ll only be summoned for certain special things that require your judgment!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright!”

Elder Xue didn’t say anything else and just left with the Grand Elder.

Once they left, Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, “Sword Scroll, are they serious?”

Sword Scroll fell silent for a short while and said, “Since they even gave you Flash, they should be serious!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and smiled, “Sword Scroll, I’m the junior sect master now because of you. So, you better not abandon me once you’ve recovered!”

Sword Scroll shook her head and smiled in the pagoda. She naturally knew that Yang Ye was joking. Actually, she was very grateful. She knew Yang Ye’s character well, and he didn’t like to be bound to anything. However, in order to obtain her main body, he’d chosen to stay here and be the junior sect master!

Perhaps others felt that it was a position which countless dreamed of obtaining, but as far as Yang Ye was concerned, not to mention being the junior sect master, he wouldn’t even be interested in being the sect master!

How nice was it to have complete freedom?

Sword Scroll fell silent as she gazed at the fragments before her.

It was something which had been obtained in exchange for someone’s freedom!

…

Yang Ye left the hall and went to the rear mountains. There were 10 abodes here, and they were situated on the spots where the spirit energy was the densest. Only the higher-ups and some special disciples had the right to possess an abode here.

Now, he had one.

Yang Ye arrived at his abode. It was like a small palace, but it had no decorations. It was very simple. However, the spirit energy here was extremely abundant and merely inferior to the Primordial Pagoda!

Yang Ye entered the pagoda. On the Ascension Platform, there was a pile of fragments before Yang Ye and Sword Scroll.

They were the fragments of Sword Scroll’s main body!

Sword Scroll spoke solemnly, “The essence of these fragments is damaged. I can only repair its form, not its essence!”

Yang Ye asked, “Snowy can, right?”

Sword Scroll nodded, “She can! Once I’ve repaired its form, she will be able to help me repair their essence, and then I can merge with it.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Thank you!”

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “Actually, I had my own selfish considerations too. If you’re able to recover your main body, you’ll be extremely helpful to me. So, gratitude isn’t necessary.”

Sword Scroll glanced at Yang Ye and didn’t say anything else.

Yang Ye withdrew the scroll that contained Flash, and he asked, “Can this secret technique be used to enhance sword energy?”

She nodded slightly, “It’s a very precious technique. Even Five World Realm experts find the speed of your flying swords overwhelming. But if you enhance them with Flash, then not to mention Five World Realm experts, even Lord Realm experts would find them difficult to stop.”

Yang Ye was astounded, “It’s that amazing?”

Sword Scroll nodded, “It isn’t just amazing, it’s absolutely amazing. Only the sect master and junior sect master of the sect are allowed to cultivate it. Of course, disciples who make extraordinary contributions can cultivate it too. The most formidable part of this technique is its ability to improve explosive force. For example, it can instantly improve your flying swords’ speed by around 40%!”

40%!

Yang Ye was visibly moved because his flying swords were already extremely fast!

If they gained another 40% of speed, how terrifying would they be? It could be said that their speed would probably be on the verge of exceeding his control! They would be too quick!

Sword scroll spoke solemnly, “But you must be careful. It’s equivalent to instantly igniting the potential within you, and your body will definitely be exhausted after using it. Sometimes, you may even experience worse side effects. Anyway, it’s definitely nothing good. So, even if you succeed at cultivating it, you should never use it unless you have to.”

Yang Ye nodded. Secret techniques usually had side effects, and the only difference was how severe these side effects were.

Yang Ye left the Ascension Platform. He left Sword Scroll to focus on repairing her main body while he went to the cultivation room and sat down cross-legged.

He opened the scroll, and then the scroll instantly entered his forehead!

A single use scroll!

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled. Obviously, the Ancient Sword Sect attached great importance to the technique!

He closed his eyes slowly, and it didn’t take long for Flash to fully appear in his mind. Besides that, there were many annotations and records of prior experience. It was extremely detailed and comprehensive!

In that way, it made Yang Ye’s cultivation of it much easier!

Flash represented traveling in a flash!

The Ancient Sword Sect was a sect of sword cultivators, and the swords of sword cultivators had to be fast, extremely fast. So, its ancestors had created such a secret technique that instantly improved the speed of a person’s sword for a short while! However, the creator of this technique kept emphasizing that one should never rely on the technique too much and should rely on one’s own speed instead. Because only what someone cultivated themselves was true and real!

Yang Ye fully agreed with that!

As for things like secret techniques and Super Divine Treasures, they were external sources of strength. They could be used, but they couldn’t be relied upon!

Yang Ye didn’t go anywhere once he started cultivating and just focused on the secret technique. Besides studying the secret technique, he cultivated his own secret technique, the Divine Avatar Technique. It was a technique he’d obtained from the desolate race, and he naturally hadn’t forgotten it. It could be considered as one of his trump cards!

Time passed swiftly, and 10 days passed in an instant.

Yang Ye left the pagoda and went to the meeting hall. The Grand Elder was waiting for him.

He’d planned to continue cultivating, but it couldn’t be helped because the Grand Elder wanted to see him!

The Grand Elder nodded slightly to Yang Ye and said, “There’s something you must deal with!”

Yang Ye spoke without thinking, “I’m busy!”

The Grand Elder’s eyelids twitched. Meanwhile, Yang Ye realized he’d misspoke. He’d almost forgotten that he was the junior sect master. So, he smiled embarrassedly and said, “I’m free, I’m free. Please go ahead, Grand Elder.”

The Grand Elder nodded slightly, “There’s been some problems with some of the clans subordinate to us.”

“Our subordinate clans?” Yang Ye asked, “What happened?”

The Grand Elder explained, “Some of their patriarchs died abruptly. Besides that, some of their disciples with extremely good natural talent died horrible deaths. We think someone is acting against the sect!”

Yang Ye asked, “Are there any clues?”

The Grand Elder shook his head slightly, “I’ve taken a look, and I found nothing. Elder Xue and I think that they may be aware of us, so they hid themselves completely once we left the sect. Moreover…”

Yang Ye continued where he’d stopped, “Grand Elder, you think we have a mole?”

Grand Elder nodded, “It’s a possibility!”𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Can I ask about something unrelated?”

He glanced at Yang Ye, “Go on.”

Yang Ye asked, “How great is my authority? Or let me be frank, can I act against the elders and disciples first before explaining myself?”

The Grand Elder’s eyelids twitched, “What are you planning?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m just asking!”

The Grand Elder fell silent for a short while and said, “Strictly speaking, even the sect master doesn’t have the right to just kill the disciples or elders. The sect has its own Judgment Hall, and anyone who must be judged will be punished there. However, special circumstances cannot be excluded, like when a disciple tries to bring harm to the sect, a fellow disciple, or even you. Under such circumstances, you can act first without going through the Judgment Hall!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand!”

The Grand Elder sighed softly, “Ye Yang, you have a hot temper, and you’re decisive and ruthless. However, I hope you can show some patience to your fellow members of the sect. You’re the junior sect master, after all.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t worry, I won’t kill the innocent.”

The Grand Elder nodded slightly, and then he flicked a scroll over to Yang Ye, “These are the clans that are subordinate to us, and their detailed information is within that scroll. You can go have a look. Immediately notify the sect if you encounter danger that’s beyond your ability. We will rush over right away!”

Yang Ye nodded, put the scroll away, and left.

As he watched Yang Ye leave, the Grand Elder sighed softly, “Why do I feel like he’s going to do as he pleases…?”
