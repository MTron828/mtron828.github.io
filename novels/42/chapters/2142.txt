Chapter 2143 – Long Time No See!

War!

As soon as that was said, the surroundings fell silent.

Trouble had arrived more quickly than they’d imagined!

Now, it was time to make their decision.

Yang Ye remained silent. Now, it was time to see their attitudes and decide if he should leave or stay.

Silence filled the hall for a long time, and then Ku Long suddenly stood up, “Tell them to bring it!”

All of them gazed at Ku Long. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Ku Long said, “If we don't stay united now, then we’ll be crushed by them in an instant. After that, we’ll be completely suppressed by them in the Alliance of All. As for Young Brother Yang, they don’t want him, they want the Sprite Lord. They don’t want the Sprite Lord to fall into the human race’s hands. So, we can’t shrink back. Once we do that, we’ll be left with nothing.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “You’re the guardian of our human race. Since we’ve acknowledged you as the guardian, you should protect our human race. However, our human race should try its best to protect you too. Now, all of us will listen to you. If you choose to fight, we’ll fight right now. All of you have no objections, right? If you do have an objection, then please speak up now, and then leave. We won’t stop you!”

It was time to pick sides!

Presently, they had two choices. The Alliance of All or to protect Yang Ye!

In the end, no one chose to leave.

If they left the human race and went over there, they would only be used as cannon fodder! Or it should be said that once they left the human race, then the human race’s status in the large universe would suffer a tremendous decline!

After all, how could anyone survive when the whole didn’t?

Yang Ye glanced at Ku Long and said, “Take me to see the messenger from the Alliance of All!”

The middle aged man nodded and left them out of the hall. In the sky, a man from the sky race was standing there. He was here representing the Alliance of All, and his face fell when he saw Yang Ye.

Yang Ye went over to the man, “Go back and tell the sky race and all the other races that if they want to fight, they can have it. I, Yang Ye, will be waiting.”

The man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Yang Ye, do you want the human race to die with you?”

“Die with me?” Yang Ye chuckled, “If it dies, then it does. It’s not a big deal. However, we’ll drag your alliance down with us. I, Yang Ye, always keep my word. You can attack us at any time, and we’ll be ready to meet you in battle at any time.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and left.

As for Ku Long and the others, they followed closely behind him.

…

Nature Sacred Ground.

Currently, Nature Sacred Ground was the headquarters of the Human Alliance, and the human race could really be controlled there. Because most of the strong organizations in the human race had joined the Human Alliance. Moreover, there were countless other organizations and experts who were ceaselessly joining, including some of the Sovereign of Man’s subordinates.

The Alliance of All didn’t attack the human race!

However, the entire Human Dimension was sealed off by them, and the experts of the human race couldn’t leave.

Nature Hall.

In the hall, there were 17 Sages and Yang Ye. All of them could be said to be the final trump card of the human race. If they died, the human race would die with them. It wasn’t exaggerated at all because a human race without its Sages would definitely be completely divided up by the other races.

“The Alliance of All didn’t attack!” Lin Zhen spoke solemnly in the hall.

Yang Ye nodded, “They just want to exhaust us. As for actually attacking, they definitely wouldn’t dare to do that. Now, there are the three paths, the god race, and some other mysterious powers hiding in the shadows. So, they won’t dare to actually go to war with us, even if they have a huge chance to win.”

Lin Zhen said, “But if this continues, it won’t work for us either. Because they have the initiative. Do you have any ideas?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while and said, “Perhaps this is a good thing for the human race!”

Everyone gazed at him.

Yang Ye explained, “Presently, we’re sealed off by the other races, and this presents us with a chance to rest and recuperate. I’m certain that the god race will not let the matter rest. As for the three paths and some other organizations that are hiding in the shadows, they may take action soon too. So, our human race can do some things during that time.”

Lin Zhen asked, “What?”

“Gather everyone we can gather!” Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “We must gather everyone in the human race. We must get everyone with some strength to Nature Sacred Ground, and then we must nurture them. Gather them and nurture them to make them even stronger. My instinct tells me that if our human race still doesn’t unite, cooperate as a whole, and obey one central command, then we may be obliterated in an instant. However, if the human race unites as once and all of us set out with just a single command, then I believe even the joint forces of the three paths won’t be able to annihilate us quickly!”

Reorganize the entire human race!

That was Yang Ye’s plan. Previously, the human race staying ununited had nothing to do with him. Yet now, to a certain extent, he was in control of the human race. So, he had to think on behalf of the human race. His thoughts were very simple, and it was to unite the human race and its strength, so no matter who their enemy was in the future, the human race would have a fighting chance!

However, it may be quite difficult to accomplish. Everyone had their own selfish desires, so if he wanted all the organizations in the Human Dimension to unite, it would require the help of all the Sages here. The Sages had an extremely high level of prestige in the human race.

None of the Sages here had any objections toward Yang Ye’s suggestion. So, all of them with the help of those Sages, the experts from all the organizations in the human race started to rush over toward Nature Sacred Ground.

The meeting came to an end, and all the Sages left. Only Yang Ye remained in the hall.

Yang Ye walked over to the entrance of the hall and said, “Show yourself!”

A woman suddenly appeared behind him. It was Yang Lianshuang.

She walked over to his side and smiled, “The leader of the human race. You can be considered as the leader of the human race now!”

The leader of the human race!

Yang Ye shook his head, “I never expected this.”

Yang Lianshuang nodded, “It is quite shocking. You were a wanted man in the human race just a while ago, yet now, you’re its leader. The Guardian of the Human Race. How do you feel about this?”

“Feel?” Yang Ye shook his head, “Nothing.”

She spoke solemnly, “Have you thought about why they chose you?”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s definitely because of Snowy!”

“Smart!” Yang Lianshuang smiled, “Of course, it’s not entirely because of Snowy. Your natural talent and potential are things they think highly of too. Besides that, you’re able to ease up the relationship between the human race and god race. However, the true reason is still Snowy. In the future world, Snowy’s importance is absolute, and the human race will have an extraordinary advantage while it has Snowy on its side.”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “You seem to know something!”

She nodded, “I’ve looked through some ancient books, and I found out about something, the End Times!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “The End Times?”

She explained, “I don’t know the specifics. All I do know is that the disappearance of the prehistoric race may be linked to the End Times too, and it seems like it was because they possessed a Sprite Lord that they had been able to survive all those years ago. So, the Sprite Lord is extremely important. Senior Ku Long is probably aware of that too, and that’s why he’s so protective of you!”

Yang Ye smiled, “No matter what, it’s a good thing for me. I’ve given it some thought, and I hope you’ll give me your help.”

Yang Lianshuang nodded, “Of course. I’ll join the Human Alliance and do my best to grab some things in my hands. I won’t let anyone else use you while I’m here.”

Yang Ye nodded, “That’s what I was thinking. I don’t like to scheme and be schemed against, but it doesn’t represent that I like to be used. If it was in the past, I wouldn’t agree. But now, I’ve thought some things through. Just as you’ve said, I must build my own organization. With the human race as the foundation, I’ll definitely be able to establish an extraordinary organization. However, I still don’t want the organization you established to be exposed so soon!”

Yang Lianshuang replied, “I understand. I’ll only show myself, and I hope you’ll go see Shaoyao.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She smiled, “The god race isn’t an enemy to us, right?”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and replied, “I represent the human race now, and the god race may not be able to let go of their enmity from all those years ago!”

“That may not necessarily be the case!” Yang Lianshuang smiles, “It depends on who’s in control of the human race. If it’s you, then anything is possible. Ding Shaoyao isn’t a pedantic person, and her relationship with you isn’t that normal, huh?”

Yang Ye rolled his eyes at her and didn’t answer her question.

Yang Lianshuang spoke seriously, “Actually, take me with you. I have some things that I’d like to discuss with her. We didn’t have the right to discuss things with the god race before this, but now, you represent the human race and control it. At the very least, it’s like that for now. So, we have the right to discuss some things with the god race now.”

Yang Ye was curious, “What do you want to discuss?”

She grinned, “Some things between women. You don’t have to know about it!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Suddenly, Lin Zhen appeared not too far away from the hall, and he glanced at Yang Lianshuang before looking at Yang Ye, “Someone’s here for you!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Who?”

Suddenly, the surroundings fell silent.

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted abruptly because he noticed that everything in the surroundings had frozen. Lin Zhen and Yang Lianshuang seemed like their acupoints had been struck, and they were standing there like statues!

“Long time no see!” Meanwhile, a voice suddenly resounded in Yang Ye’s ears.
