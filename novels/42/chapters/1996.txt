Chapter 1997 – Take It All!

The pitch black cave was perfectly silent.

The hunched old man glanced at the surroundings and was extremely vigilant.

Meanwhile, a voice came from the casket, “That person is gone!”

The hunched old man asked ,”Who was that?”

The voice from the casket said, “That person’s main body isn’t in this world!”

Not in this world!

The old man’s pupils constricted. Who was that?!

…

After he left the cave, Yang Ye shot up into the air, and then the Divine Wings appeared before him. Yang Ye flicked a bead of blood into it. The wings instantly started trembling when the blood touched it, and then the two balls of dark blue flames appeared in the eye sockets of the skull on the back of the wings.

Swish!

The wings transformed into a ray of black light that entered Yang Ye’s forehead. A moment later, a pair of huge wings appeared on Yang Ye’s back. The wings were much larger than Yang Ye’s entire body!

I feel so light! At this moment, Yang Ye felt absolutely light to the point he practically couldn’t feel his body.

Yang Ye issued a command in his heart, and he transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

Two breaths of time later.

A man in green clothes appeared in the sky near Southern Qilin Mountain, and there was a huge pair of black wings on his back.

It was Yang Ye!

Yang Ye took a deep breath as he gazed at the mountain down below. His eyes were filled with shock. It was too fast! His current speed was simply unmatched below the Zen Realm. Not to mention See Dao Realm experts, even Attain Dao Realm experts may die from a single attack of his!

The only flaw was that it consumed quite a bit of profound energy. Just using it for that moment had exhausted around a third of his profound energy. However, it made sense because using such a treasure at his level of cultivation definitely had its drawbacks!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and looked at the mountain below him.

At this moment, it had been occupied by the army of demon beasts, and the aura of demon beasts filled it.

Yang Ye didn’t stay and vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye found A’Man and the others, and they heaved sighs of relief when they saw him.

Qin Chuan asked, “What do we do now?”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment and replied, “Wait, wait until the seal vanishes, and then we’ll leave.”

Mad Saver suddenly said, “I investigated a little just now. We can continue towards the right. That way is fine!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “There’s no need for that. We’ll just hide near here. After all, we still have to go back to Southern Qilin Mountain’s teleportation formation later. Let’s just look for a place to hide, recuperate, and return there once the seal has vanished!”

All of them had no objections.

They found a gorge in the mountain range. It was extremely wide, and it was surrounded by mountains. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground and immersed his mind into his body.

This time, he had to make himself advance to the 5th stage of the Enlightened Realm. Because once the seal vanished, this world wouldn’t have long before it collapsed and vanished. Besides that, it would definitely not be that easy for them to use the teleportation in Southern Qilin Mountain!

He had to prepare for the worst!

This breakthrough was absolutely easy. Because he’d actually been at the 5th stage of the Enlightened Realm since his time in the Asura Grounds, but he just hadn’t allowed himself to advance and wanted to use it to trick his opponents.

Yet now that he had the Divine Wings, his profound energy wasn’t really sufficient, so he’d chosen to advance to the 5th stage of the Enlightened Realm.

A day later, Yang Ye was at the 5th stage of the Enlightened Realm, and he was just a step away from the Dao Realm!

After he advanced, Yang Ye started to merge everything he knew. Sword Fusion, he’d attained that level of cultivation, and his strength underwent a qualitative change when he utilized it. However, he hadn’t fully merged and comprehended it.

His current trump cards were the Burial and Shadow Sword, and then it was Sword Fusion. Sword Fusion wasn’t a technique, it was a state or level, and it was much more powerful than anything he’d learned up until now. While he used Sword Fusion, his techniques like Burial and Shadow Sword would rise a level higher in strength!

His current goal was to perfectly merge all three of them, so his Sword Dao was even more simplified.

At most times, moves and techniques were useless when one was killing.

Just a single move would suffice!

Just like that, time trickled by, and the Dead Dimension was undergoing a tremendous change.

More and more demon beasts, humans, and other beings were converging towards Southern Qilin Mountain. All of them wanted to escape the Dead Dimension!

Two weeks passed swiftly.

Boom!

Suddenly, everyone throughout the Dead Dimension heard a loud explosion, and then countless volcanoes erupted throughout the Dead Dimension while tsunamis drowned the land.

Besides that, the ground in certain parts had started to crack open while lava seeped out from deep below the ground. Furthermore, some towering mountain ranges had started to collapse.

The Dead Dimension was doomed!

Under such circumstances, the entire Dead Dimension fell into chaos.

In the gorge.

Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes because the mountains around them had started to crack apart while the ground was trembling.

A’Man and the others huddled around Yang Ye, and A’Man spoke solemnly while she watched the scene in the surroundings, “Based on the current speed it’s collapsing at, it’ll take three days at most for the Dead Dimension to cease to exist. We must leave via the teleportation formation before then!”

Three days!

Yang Ye stood up, “Come, let’s head back to Southern Qilin Mountain!”

Qin Chuan asked, “Are we going to kill our way back there?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “We’re going to reason with them.”

Qin Chuan asked, “Do you think that they’ll listen to you?”

Yang Ye walked over to Qin Chuan, patted him on the shoulder, and said, “Let me teach you a trick to use when someone refuses to listen to you. You put a sword against that person’s throat. Trust me, at that time, that person will sit down calmly and reason with you!”

Qin Chuan was stunned speechless.

It didn’t take long for them to get back to Southern Qilin Mountain. However, they didn’t ascend the mountain immediately. They weren’t crazy! The puny forces they had were nothing before the army of demon beasts.

Yang Ye made them hide outside the mountain while he snuck all the way to the top of it.

In the hall.

At this moment, there were around 10 figures in the hall. Of course, they were clearly demon beasts.

They were led by a white robed old man, and he held two jade green iron balls!

The old man glanced at the others here, and his gaze stopped on a robust middle aged man, “Blood Demon King, the teleportation formation can still be used, but it requires a huge amount of spirit energy. However, the spirit energy in Southern Qilin Mountain has been completely taken away by those outsiders. Now, we have no choice but to use a huge number of immortal crystals and inner cores to activate the teleportation formation!”

Blood Demon King spoke indifferently, “Brother Gu Ku, inner cores aren’t a big problem. What I care about is how many can the teleportation formation transport away!”

Gu Ku fell silent for a short while and said, “It’s impossible for you to teleport all the demon beasts out of this place. The teleportation formation can do it, but we don’t have enough spirit energy.”

He stood up and looked up at the sky outside the hall, “If those people outside undo the seal around this world, we wouldn’t need spirit energy and could just leave through outer space. However, they probably wish for nothing more than to see us die with this world!”

The Blood Demon King stood up, “Brother Gu Ku, activate the formation now. Let’s send out our people in batches.”

Gu Ku asked, “You’re not leaving first?”

The Blood Demon King gazed out the hall. A dense ocean of demon beasts resided at the foot of the mountain. He gazed at them for a long time, and then he spoke softly, “Let them go first. I’ll be the last!”

Gu Ku glanced at him, and there was a trace of admiration in his eyes.

Yang Ye was about to leave when the Blood Demon King suddenly said, “Show yourself!”

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted slightly. His presence had been discovered!

How did he notice me?

Yang Ye stopped hiding and revealed himself.

All of the others here gazed at Yang Ye but didn’t attack.

“An outsider!” The Blood Demon King sized up Yang Ye and said, “I know you. You escaped from one of my subordinates. It seems a mysterious demon beast helped you then!”

Yang Ye glanced at the Blood Demon King and said, “The reason I’m here is very simple. I want to leave with some friends of mine. I hope you’ll let me do that!”

“I’m afraid we can’t!” Gu Ku spoke indifferently, “We can’t even send away our own people. As for others, just forget it!”

The Blood Demon King suddenly said, “Where’s that demon beast?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t know!” He really didn’t know Zhi’er and the others’ whereabouts. However, he felt that they should have left the Dead Dimension by now.

The Blood Demon King fell silent.

Yang Ye said, “The teleportation formation requires immortal crystals, and I can provide some. Just take it as the fee I pay for the teleportation, alright?”

Gu Ku asked, “How many can you provide?”

Yang Ye counted for a moment and replied, “A few hundred!”

A few hundred immortal crystals was a huge amount of wealth in this place.

The hall fell silent.

A long time passed before Gu Ku suddenly chuckled, “We needed immortal crystals, and someone has come to give them to us. Looks like even the heavens are blessing us.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stretched out his hand and clawed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was clearly prepared for him, and he immediately swung his sword.

A ray of sword energy flashed!

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded, and the entire hall shook violently.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had vanished from the hall.

He’d fled!

Gu Ku’s expression was extremely unsightly.

At the foot of Southern Qilin Mountain, Yang Ye looked up at the mountain, and then he patted his chest. A small white head emerged from there.

Yang Ye pointed at Southern Qilin Mountain, “There’s spirit energy here. Take it! Take it all!”

As he spoke, his gaze turned icy cold, “You refused to let me leave? Then we can all stay here! Snowy! Take it! Suck it all away until they question their life choices!”
