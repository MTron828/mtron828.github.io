Chapter 1311 – A Monster!

Deception!

The young woman was trying to deceive the violet mink!

Yang Ye’s face instantly darkened because she was actually trying to take the violet mink from him, and she was doing so right in front of him.

Yang Ye was just about to speak when the young woman continued, “This world is very small, and the world outside is huge. Come with me and you’ll....”

Zi’er interrupted her and said, “I won’t go with you!”

The young woman was slightly stunned, and then she asked, “Why? Because of this human? Let me tell you that humans love sweet talking others. You’ll definitely regret staying by his side.”

Zi’er glanced at the young woman and said, “That’s my business!”

“No!” The young woman shook her head and said, “As another noble member of the demon race, I can’t watch you continue on this misguided path. I have a duty to save you!”

As she spoke, her gaze descended onto Yang Ye, “She’ll only stop once you’re dead.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she raised his right hand slightly, and then the multicolored snake on her arm suddenly opened its eyes. A moment later, it transformed into a multicolored beam of light that shot forward from her arm.

At the moment that the young woman had raised her hand, Yang Ye’s face had changed drastically. He clenched his right fist and didn’t hesitate to slam his fist forward.

The Brink Laws!

His physical strength at the brink!

The reason he’d immediately executed the Brink Laws with his physical strength was because he sensed danger. The young girl was clearly not an ordinary person. So, he didn’t dare act carelessly or look down upon her. Thus, he’d immediately utilized the Brink Laws.

A terrifying wave of force instantly surged out from Yang Ye’s fist, and it caused the forest in the surroundings to be obliterated.

Bang!

An explosion resounded as Yang Ye’s feet scraped against the ground while his body was pushed back. The violet mink’s expression changed. She flipped her palms and a ray of violet light flashed, causing the space in the surroundings to tremble.

Meanwhile, the young woman suddenly appeared in front of Zi’er, and then space instantly returned to normal.

Zi’er was shocked, and she turned around to gaze at the young woman.

The young woman said, “Our demon race places emphasis on fair battles. If you attack, then you’ll be breaking the rules.”

As she spoke, she glanced at the surroundings. At this moment, the ground in the surroundings was trembling while countless formidable auras were shooting over in their direction. Obviously, the battle had alarmed the other experts of the demon race.

The young woman’s voice suddenly resounded, “No one is allowed to come close. Otherwise, I’ll skin all of you alive!”

No more than a breath of time after she finished speaking, the surroundings had suddenly quieted down. Even though those auras hadn’t left, they didn’t continue rushing towards them.

The violet mink glanced at the young woman, and then she gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at his fist, and there was an extremely solemn expression in his eyes. Because his fist had actually turned red, and his entire arm felt numb. He looked up and saw that the small snake had enlarged countless times. Its body was the width of almost 5 adults. Now, it couldn’t be called a snake but a python!

Yang Ye sized up the python. Now, he finally could clearly discern that the array of colors that covered it was actually all its scales. The multicolored scales were extremely thick. They were a few dozen centimeters thick, and they were even covered in mysterious markings. Besides that, he noticed a pair of multicolored wings on it!

It was a Voider Realm python!

Moreover, it was a Voider Realm python that was even slightly stronger than the Ten Thousand Legged Centipede!

Meanwhile, the young woman spoke abruptly, “Little Wing, get him!”

Hiss! Hiss!

The multicolored python flicked its tongue, and then its huge tail swept towards Yang Ye. Everywhere it passed, space instantly cracked apart and rippled violently. It seemed like space would collapse at any moment. It was an absolutely shocking sight.

The tail hadn’t even arrived before him yet Yang Ye felt a wave of terrifying pressure slam down upon him and tried to crush him into bits. Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly. He flipped his palm and a sword appeared in his grasp. At the same time, the ancient sheath appeared in his grasp as well. He sheathed his sword, and then he suddenly turned sideways and drew his sword when the tail arrived at his side!

Om!

A sword howl resounded through the mountains in the surrounding as Yang Ye’s sword slashed against the python’s tail. The tail and sword shook violently, and then both Yang Ye and the tail were blasted away. But it didn’t take long for Yang Ye’s figure to tremble in midair and stop on the spot. However, the space behind him cracked apart slightly. They were cracks created by the Laws of Space that he’d utilized to shift away the energy that was acting upon him.

“Destroying all techniques with a single strike!” The young woman spoke abruptly, “Not bad.”

Yang Ye had an extremely solemn expression on his face. He was destroying the python’s attack with a single strike, but the python’s strength was truly too great. If it wasn’t for his Epoch Realm body, not only would his attack have been unable to blast the tail away, he might have been struck to death. Fortunately, while the python’s physical strength was formidable, it wasn’t to the extent of being completely superior to his own.

Of course, it was mainly because of his body at the Epoch Realm. If he merely relied on his attainments in the Sword Dao, it would be utterly impossible for him to fight a demon beast at the python’s level. Actually, as far as Yang Ye was concerned, the most terrifying part about the python wasn’t its strength but its defenses. Because his previous attack had actually been incapable of piercing its defenses, and his attack had merely left a mark on the python’s scales!

The multicolored python’s eyes had a trace of seriousness within them as well. Obviously, it was quite shocked by Yang Ye’s strength. Especially when the human before it was just a Quasi Emperor.

Their gazes collided, and then they vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye’s figure transformed into a ray of light that shot towards the python. At the same time, the Sword God’s Seal lit up on his forehead. As soon as that happened, the glow his sword emanated grew even more dazzling. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

A ferocious glow flashed in the python’s eyes. Its figure curled up in midair, and then it seemed like a small mountain as it slammed towards Yang Ye’s attack.

Meanwhile, the young woman glanced at the ancient sheath in Yang Ye’s grasp and the Sword God’s Seal on Yang Ye’s forehead, and then she chuckled, “He has quite a few treasures.”

A ray of light flashed through the sky and slammed against the python.

Bang!

An explosion rumbled, and then both man and python were blasted away again. This time, they instantly flew over 3km away.

Yang Ye coughed softly in midair, and then a wisp of blood instantly seeped out from the corner of his mouth.

Zi’er’s eyelids twitched when she saw the blood coming from the corner of Yang Ye’s mouth, and a violet glow flickered within her eyes. As for the young woman by Zi’er’s side, she had a calm expression on her face. Only her eyes were frequently sweeping at Yang Ye’s ancient sheath and Sword God’s Seal, and then a strange smile curled up on the corners of her mouth.

Yang Ye wasn’t the only one to have suffered injuries, the python was injured as well. A cut that was a few dozen centimeters wide had appeared on its stomach. The scales there had been cut apart and blood was surging out incessantly from the wound. After his attacks were enhanced by Rebirth Rank sword intent and the Sword God’s Seal, it wasn’t difficult for Yang Ye to penetrate through the defenses of the python’s multicolored scales!

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and then raised his head and looked at the python. The python was looking at him as well, and besides a ferocious glow, there was a trace of viciousness in its eyes.

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath at all, and he immediately charged at the python. This time, he didn’t choose to collide head-on with the python, and he chose to dodge and attack instead. Because as far as he was concerned, such a massive demon beast should be extremely slow. But he was disappointed.

The python wasn’t slow at all. Especially when it launched a sudden attack, its speed even caused Yang Ye’s expression to change.

Just like that, one man and one python fought for almost an hour. Both sides were evenly matched, but everyone was very well aware that if the battle went on, then Yang Ye would definitely gradually fall into a disadvantaged state and even be defeated. Because Yang Ye was just a Quasi Emperor. He didn’t have much profound energy. Once it was exhausted, then he wouldn’t be able to fight the python anymore.

That was his weakness!

Yang Ye was naturally aware of that weakness. So, once he pushed the python back, he stopped and looked at the young woman, “What exactly do you want?!”

A smile arose on the corners of her mouth. She pointed at Zi’er and Snowy, and then she pointed at the ancient sheath and Sword God’s Seal, “Give them all to me and I’ll consider letting you live. Right, I’ll only consider it. Don’t keep your hopes high. After all, I don’t have a good impression on you.”

Yang Ye’s face instantly darkened. He gazed at her for a short while before he said, “You really are mad!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he didn’t waste his breath anymore. He issued a command in his heart, and a pair of wings appeared on his back.

The young woman’s eyes lit up when she saw the wings, “You have even more treasures. Hmm, what a pity. It’s far inferior when compared to that sword sheath and that thing on your forehead. However, it isn’t very inferior. I can have some fun with it.”

Yang Ye didn’t continue wasting his breath on her. His figure flashed and vanished on the spot. In an instant, countless afterimages appeared in the surroundings. They densely filled the surroundings, and there were at least 10,000 of them. Every single afterimage seemed real, and it was an extremely terrifying sight. At the same time, countless rays of light appeared in the surroundings. The rays of light crisscrossed and seemed like a net.

Suppression!

Complete suppression!

At this moment, Yang Ye’s speed had far surpassed the python, and his sword could penetrate its defenses. So, the python could only passively suffer a beating when faced with Yang Ye’s absolute speed.

Amongst the moves in the world, only speed had no counter. It was an extremely accurate statement.

The smile on the corners of the young woman’s mouth gradually turned cold at the sight of this. Because the python had started to cry and hiss in pain.

If this continued, even if it could avoid death, the python would still end up being chopped apart.

The young woman didn’t hesitate to walk forward.

Meanwhile, Zi’er suddenly said, “Our demon race places emphasis on fair battles. The demon race will look down upon you if you join the battle!”

A cold smile appeared on the corners of the young woman’s mouth, “Noble demons never care about the views of others.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished on the spot.

Zi’er was at a loss for words.
