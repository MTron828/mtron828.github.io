Chapter 1829 – Overconfident!

As soon as he swallowed it, a wave of bitterness filled his throat, and it was truly horrible.

At this moment, he understood why Snowy wanted to chop up the Spirit Shaping Fruit!

Because even he felt like doing the same now!

The fruit went down his throat and into his body. As soon as it entered his stomach, the terrifying energy within it instantly dispersed throughout his body.

It didn’t take long for his body to start absorbing it swiftly!

Unlike what Yang Ye expected, he didn’t feel uncomfortable at all, and it was very comfortable instead!

In next to no time, Yang Ye noticed that some sort of change was occurring in his body as he absorbed the energy from the fruit.

Suddenly, Hou Qing’s voice resounded in his mind, “Quickly use the Undying Hegemon technique's mental cultivation method to guide the energy!”

Yang Ye quickly did as Hou Qing said.

Bang!

The clothes he wore were instantly incinerated into ashes.

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden and the others, who had been watching, were stunned. It didn’t take long for them to return to normal, and only Nether Maiden and the pig-riding young woman’s expressions were slightly uncomfortable. However, it only took a while for them to return to normal.

All of them noticed that threads of blue light had suddenly appeared around Yang Ye, and they were moving throughout his body like threads.

The pig-riding young woman suddenly said, “That fellow’s body is growing stronger again!”

Nether Maiden nodded slightly, “His body has always been very strong.”

In the past, Yang Ye’s attainments in the Sword Dao were formidable, but his body was equally formidable. It could be said that there was a time when Yang Ye’s body had been stronger than his Sword Dao!

The pig-riding young woman shook her head slightly, “If this fellow’s body rises another level, even 6th stage True Realm experts can only dream of killing him!”

Nether Maiden nodded with agreement. Yang Ye’s body was already very strong. If it rose up to another level, they could imagine how terrifying it would become. Because there was another extremely terrifying aspect about Yang Ye, and it was his recovery!

His heaven defying recovery and abnormal physical strength would absolutely become everyone’s nightmare!

Unless someone could kill him with a single attack, he would be impossible to kill!

Another even more terrifying thing was that he had Snowy. The Energy Pearls which Snowy created could give him an endless supply of profound energy.

In short, it was absolutely terrifying!

Meanwhile, the pig-riding young woman suddenly said, “I can’t let this continue. I have to speed up my cultivation. Otherwise, he’ll leave me far behind.”

Nether Maiden nodded slightly, “Me too!”

An Nanjing didn’t say anything, but her fists had been slowly clenched together.

Yang Ye’s speed of growth was too quick. It was so quick that they felt a huge amount of pressure. Even though they were very good friends with Yang Ye, they were still competing with him. Especially Nether Maiden. She was the first amongst them to get to know Yang Ye, and they’d always been almost equally matched since they met on Profounder Continent. Yet now, Yang Ye’s strength was clearly superior to hers!

She felt no envy, and it was motivation instead!

The pig-riding young woman and Nether Maiden stopped watching Yang Ye. They sat down cross-legged and started cultivating.

Both of them possessed extraordinary natural talent. Now that they had such an extraordinary cultivation room and abundant spirit energy, growing stronger was just a matter of time to them.

The cultivation room fell silent.

The blue energy around Yang Ye was growing in amount, and it was flowing faster and faster.

Needless to say, this session of body refinement had been the easiest in history for Yang Ye. Because he didn’t feel any pain. Conversely, it felt extremely nice, and it was like something was massaging his entire body!

Time trickled by. Around a day later, Yang Ye felt the comfortable feeling gradually lessen.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing’s voice resounded in his mind again, “Swallow the second fruit.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly and swallowed a second Fruit of Rebirth.

As soon as it entered his stomach, countless strands of energy erupted from it, and then the energy started to be absorbed by his body.

Yang Ye utilized the Undying Hegemon technique to guide the energy again.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing added, “If you want to attain the 2nd level, you must make your body undergo a chance, a qualitative change. At any other normal time, it would take dozens of years of cultivation, but you don’t need that now. Because the Fruits of Rebirth can make up for that. However….”

He paused for a moment before he continued, “However, it’s considered as using external forces to achieve an improvement in your cultivation. So, while its results will be better than cultivating normally, there will be a latent problem. You’ll lack that kind of accumulation through time. It may not be a problem now, but it may be quite an issue in the future!”

Yang Ye was visibly grim when he heard this.

He naturally understood what Hou Qing meant. It was like running. If a person immediately went for a marathon without training at all, then perhaps that person may be able to complete it, but that person’s body would definitely suffer serious injuries upon completion.

His current situation was similar to that. Even though there wouldn’t be any problems now, it would be a latent problem, and as time passed, problems may gradually emerge.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing added, “But it’s fine. It isn’t a huge problem. However, you must make some time every day to train your body. Moreover, you must not improve your body further in the short term. You can only continue improving it once your body has fully stabilized.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand.”

Hou Qing said, “Alright, then continue!”

Just like that, Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, focused, and continued using his cultivation technique to guide the energy within him.

After consuming the second fruit, the comfortable feeling had reappeared, and the changes his body was undergoing grew even more obvious.

At the same time, the blue threads of energy around him were flowing even more rapidly!

Just like that, time passed slowly. After two days passed, Yang Ye swallowed a third Fruit of Rebirth!

This time, his body absorbed it extremely quickly, and it was over two times faster than before!

Blood Maiden and Blind Maiden were constantly watching from the side.

They had been watching throughout this time. Because they were afraid something would happen to Yang Ye. After all, no matter what type of cultivation it was, there was a chance of encountering issues. If something happened, they would immediately help him. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Yet now, it seemed like they’d been worried for nothing.

Blood Maiden suddenly said, “He has grown stronger again!”

Blind Maiden nodded slightly, “He’s improving very quickly. Besides the various fortuitous encounters he obtains, he works very hard as well.”

Blood Maiden smiled, “Those with natural talent and luck aren’t terrifying; it's those who are able to suffer and work harder who are more terrifying!”

As she spoke, she gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was a person like that!

At this moment, Yang Ye’s entire body was undergoing a qualitative transformation.

Just like that, time slowly trickled by.

…

Five days later.

Suddenly, Yang Ye opened his eyes.

“Huff!” A mouthful of foul air floated out from his mouth.

Yang Ye stood up slowly, took a deep breath, and then a smile curled up on his face.

Blood Rebirth!

After being modified by the Fruit of Rebirth, his body had finally advanced and attained Blood Rebirth!

The level of Blood Rebirth didn’t just give him extraordinary regenerative abilities, it also provided him with outstanding defensive capabilities. Coupled with the Primordial Violet Energy he possessed, his body was at an absolutely terrifying level!

How terrifying was it?

He naturally had to test it to find out!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at Blood Maiden and Blind Maiden. He was about to speak when Blood Maiden suddenly said, “Wear something first!”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he blushed before quickly withdrawing some clothes and wearing them.

Blood Maiden said, “Congratulations!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I feel like my entire body is filled with energy. I’m going to test it out with Qiong Qi!”

He vanished on the spot.

At the 1st level of the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye went over to Qiong Qi and said, “Brother Qiong Qi, let’s compete with our bodies!”

Qiong Qi glanced at him and said, “Alright!”

He immediately leaped into the air and slammed his body at Yang Ye.

A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, and then he clenched his right fist tightly and slammed it forward.

Bang!

Blood Maiden and Blind Maiden watched as faint golden light arose around Yang Ye’s fist while it slammed against Qiong Qi.

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and then Qiong Qi was blasted over 300m away!

However, Yang Ye’s figure didn’t move at all!

A solemn expression immediately appeared on Blind Maiden and Blood Maiden’s faces.

Even though Qiong Qi hadn’t used his full strength just now, he hadn’t really held back. They knew how strong Qiong Qi was, but he’d still been blasted over 300m back by Yang Ye’s attack while Yang Ye’s figure wasn’t pushed back at all!

Qiong Qi had a solemn expression on his face as well. Obviously, he hadn’t expected Yang Ye’s physical strength to have arrived at such a level.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye glanced at his fist and took a deep breath.

Strength!

At this moment, he felt like his entire body was filled with strength! Boundless strength! If he used the Wargod’s arm, it was obvious that his strength would grow even more terrifying. At that time, just his physical strength would be sufficient to crush a 6th stage True Realm expert!

No! Even his current physical strength was sufficient to crush ordinary 6th stage True Realm experts!

Truly crush them!

Suddenly, Yang Ye summoned Snowy and said, “Try hitting me with the wooden sword!”

He wanted to test how strong his physical defenses were.

Snowy blinked, and then she quickly shook her head.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “It’s fine. I’m really strong now!”

Snowy was still hesitant.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing shook his head.

Qiong Qi asked, “What?”

Hou Qing replied, “He has become overconfident!”

Qiong Qi felt speechless.

Snowy refused to stab Yang Ye no matter what. In the end, Yang Ye had no choice but to take the sword himself and stab his own left arm.

Yang Ye thought he could stop the wooden sword. However…

Hiss!

The sword stabbed through his arm.

Blood sprayed!

Yang Ye was stunned on the spot.
