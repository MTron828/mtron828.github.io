Chapter 1564 - The Phoenix Domain Is No More!

Translator: InVader

At this moment, all the experts throughout the Phoenix Domain were shocked, and they gazed towards Yang Ye’s location.

What’s going on?

That was what everyone wondered at this moment.

At this moment, the area Yang Ye stood at had been transformed into an ocean of flames. Or it should be said that an ocean of flames covered a huge area around Yang Ye. Moreover, waves of fire were ceaselessly surging up into the sky, and it seemed like they sought to incinerate the world.

All the experts here arrived in the air above the ocean of flames, and it didn’t take long for a man to walk out slowly from within the flames.

It was Yang Ye!

At this moment, Yang Ye seemed like he was made of flames! A being truly made of flames!

“Yang Ye!” Mo Jiang stared at Yang Ye and said, “What are you trying to do?!”

Yang Ye suddenly looked up at Mo Jiang. A moment later, Yang Ye transformed into a flaming pillar that shot up into the sky.

A wisp of ferocity curled up on the corners of Mo Jiang’s mouth, and then he slapped his palm down at Yang Ye. A huge claw that blotted out the sky appeared there and slammed down towards Yang Ye.

Suddenly, a ray of sword energy tore through the air. It was just an ordinary ray of sword energy, but it was covered in a layer of dark red flames. The sword energy collided with the huge claw, and as soon as they collided, the huge claw was instantly obliterated like snow dropping into boiling oil!

Meanwhile, the flaming sword energy didn’t slow down and shot straight towards Mo Jiang!

Mo Jiang’s pupils constricted at the sight of this. When was Yang Ye’s sword energy so terrifying?

Suddenly, one of the old men warned, “Be careful of that flame!”

Meanwhile, the flaming sword energy had arrived in front of Mo Jiang. Mo Jiang took a step forward, and then an ink black flame surged out from within him. However, as soon as the ink black flame emerged from within him, all the experts of the Divine Phoenix Clan were stunned by the scene that followed.

Because the ink black flame had immediately turned around and fled!

It had fled!

The Nether Death Flame, a flame ranked as the third in the world, had actually fled!

Mo Jiang didn’t even have time to think. He just unfurled his fists and slapped his palms forward!

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye’s sword energy exploded into bits. However, while the sword energy had been blasted apart, the flames that covered it hadn’t vanished. The flames traveled along Mo Jiang’s hands and started spreading towards his entire body, and then it fully enveloped him.

“AH!!” Shrill and miserable cries resounded incessantly.

It was coming from Mo Jiang!

As they watched Mo Jiang let out those shrill cries, the eyes of some experts from the Divine Phoenix Clan were filled with disbelief. The Divine Phoenix Clan was a clan that specialized in flames. Flames were extremely beneficial to them. Yet now, as the patriarch of the Divine Phoenix Clan, Mo Jiang was actually unable to resist Yang Ye’s flames? What flames were they?

The shrill cries were still resounding incessantly. Mo Jiang’s body had actually turned completely red, and it seemed like he was going to be cooked. It didn’t take long for Mo Jiang to return to his true form. However, the flames were still wrapped tightly around him, and it made Mo Jiang struggle and howl madly in midair!

The experts from the Divine Phoenix Clan were shocked when they saw that Mo Jiang was still incapable of struggling free of the flames after returning to his true form, and one of the old men hurriedly said, “Hurry up and help him!”

Suddenly, Yang Ye swung his sword swiftly. In an instant, countless rays of sword energy shot up towards the sky in a dense mass.

Every single strand of sword energy was enveloped by a layer of dark red flames!

The experts of the Divine Phoenix Clan were astounded. Even Mo Jiang couldn’t resist those flames, so they didn’t dare to allow the sword energy to get close to them. All of them attacked at once.

At the same time, numerous powerful auras approached from all directions. In an instant, over 30 old men arrived here. Some were from the demon race while some were from the human race.

Coupled with the experts from the Divine Phoenix Clan, there were 53 Rebirth Realm experts here!

53!

53 Rebirth Realm experts had released their auras, and Yang Ye’s sword energy was instantly dispersed by them. However, the flames didn’t vanish, and they floated in midair. However, the auras of those Rebirth Realm experts had immobilized in midair!

Meanwhile, the experts of the Divine Phoenix Clan helped Mo Jiang suppress the flames which covered him, but even they couldn’t put it out completely!

The waves of flames around Yang Ye were stretched swiftly towards the surroundings, but they’d been completely suppressed by the Rebirth Realm experts here.

The joint forces of 53 Rebirth Realm experts was absolutely terrifying!

Yang Ye glanced at the sky, “Haha! All of you really think highly of me. 53 Rebirth Realm experts. Hmm? There are humans too? When has the human race joined forces with the Divine Phoenix Clan?”

“Yang Ye!” Suddenly, Gu Mo stepped forward. He looked Yang Ye in the eyes and said, “I thought it was merely enmity between you and the Divine Phoenix Clan, but I never expected that you and the forces behind you would actually act against my entire demon race. Who’s supporting you for the shadows? Why are you attacking my demon race?!”

“Attacking the demon race?” Yang Ye gazed at Gu Mo, “Elder Gu, I don’t really understand what you’re trying to say!”

“You don’t understand?” Gu Mo spoke in a low voice, “Not too long ago, mysterious experts entered our Demon Territory and slaughtered a few tens of thousands of demon beasts. Moreover, they threatened to destroy the demon race if you die.”

Yang Ye frowned. Someone is helping me? Who’s helping me?

Meanwhile, one of the human experts in the sky stepped forward, “Yang Ye, you and the power standing behind you launched a surprise attack on the demon race and almost caused war between our races. Do you realize what the consequences of that would be? If war erupts between our races, you’ll be condemned through the ages!”

Yang Ye gazed at the human Rebirth Realm expert, “And who are you?”

The old man spoke indifferently, “I’m the President of the Human Alliance, Su Dan!”

Yang Ye frowned again. He hadn’t expected the Human Alliance to have joined in as well. There was enmity between him and both the Emperor Sect and War Pavilion, but this was the Human Alliance. This alliance wasn’t something that the War Pavilion and Emperor Sect could control. It was an alliance that was jointly built by all the powerful powers of the human race. So, the War Pavilion and Emperor Sect didn’t have much influence on it!

Yang Ye’s brows were pressed even more tightly together. His intuition told him that this incident wasn’t normal.

Meanwhile, Su Dan suddenly asked, “Yang Ye, is the power standing behind you the Nether Pavilion?!”

The Nether Pavilion!

The expressions of everyone here changed when they heard him. They naturally knew about the Nether Pavilion. After all, it had once been a taboo in Sky Sky Continent!

Meanwhile, Su Dan added, “Haha! Besides the Nether Pavilion, who else could it be? After all, you, Yang Ye, were quite close to the Nether Pavilion in the lower dimension. Since you’ve been trapped here, they naturally wouldn’t stand by idly.”

He suddenly gazed at Gu Mo and the demon beasts in the surroundings before he continued, “Everyone, I think that it’s best to let Yang Ye leave. Otherwise, the Nether Pavilion…”

“The Nether Pavilion?” Suddenly, a middle aged man stepped forward, “So what if it’s the Nether Pavilion? Why would my demon race fear the Nether Pavilion? Yang Ye, there was no enmity between my Heavenly Dragon Clan and the Nether Pavilion, but you slaughtered over 10,000 of my clansmen for no reason. Such enmity is irreconcilable!”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye frowned. The Nether Pavilion is here in the large world?

That doesn’t sound right!

It only took an instant for Yang Ye to reject that thought. If the Nether Pavilion was here, they would have definitely come straight to the Divine Phoenix Clan and not kill the demon beasts of the other clans. Killing the demon beasts of the other clans would only infuriate the entire demon race and make the entire demon race target him. Moreover, if it really was the Nether pavilion, then they would definitely be here by now!

In other words, it wasn’t the Nether Pavilion!

Moreover, the mysterious experts that attacked the demon race may not have been helping him, and they may have been trying to create trouble for him!

Suddenly, Su Dao said, “Everyone, the Nether Pavilion is a huge threat, and my Human Alliance is willing to join forces with all of you in the fight against them.”

“Perfect!” The expert from the Heavenly Dragon Clan nodded. Even the Heavenly Dragon Clan was extremely afraid of the Nether Pavilion, or it should be said that the entire demon race feared the Nether Pavilion. So, the Human Alliance’s willingness to help was naturally good news.

A smile curled up on the corners of Su Dan’s mouth, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “However, we have to deal with Yang Ye first!”

Suddenly, Yang Ye gazed at Gu Mo, “Elder Gu, I don’t want to say anything now, and it’s pointless to say anything. Just take the members of Demon God’s Palace and leave.”

Gu Mo gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then he said, “I can’t leave.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he nodded, “I understand.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he gazed at the experts from the Divine Phoenix Clan, “From today onwards, the Phoenix Domain is no more!”

Once he finished speaking, Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the Stellar Sword Diagram appeared in front of him. In an instant, the scene in the surroundings changed, and then it was transformed into a starry sky.

A moment later, countless strands of stellar sword energy appeared in the sky above the Phoenix Domain. This time, the stellar sword energy was different, and it was fiery red.

A dense expanse of fiery red sword energy descended from the sky. At the same time, the ocean of flames around Yang Ye swept swiftly towards the surroundings.

When they saw the fiery red sword energy that filled the sky, Mo Jiang and the other experts from the Divine Phoenix Clan turned ghastly pale in an instant.

Meanwhile, the ocean of flames had stretched extremely far into the surroundings, and everything in its path was obliterated.
