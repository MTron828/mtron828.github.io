Chapter 1796 – Just Divorce A Man Like That!

In the sky above Martial Heaven City, Wu Mu had an indifferent expression on his face.

As for the experts of the Wu Clan, they were quite anxious. After all, this battle was related to their Wu Clan’s fate.

At this moment, Ying Yu and the others were anxious too. It was Wu Mu, an extraordinary expert from a past era.

If the Undertaker couldn’t deal with Wu Mu, then based on the strength this strand of Wu Mu’s soul possessed, it was absolutely easy for Wu Mu to annihilate many of the True Realm experts on their side.

They couldn’t afford to suffer such losses.

The beast image behind the Undertaker grew clearer and clearer, and his aura grew stronger and stronger. Around five breaths of time later, he suddenly stretched out his right hand. In an instant, a huge ethereal palm appeared in the space above Martial Heaven City. It was huge and at least covered two thirds of the city.

The powerful aura coming from the palm caused the space within the city to warp.

At the same time, all of the experts here felt suffocated.

They couldn’t breathe!

The members of the Wu Clan within the city were shocked by this. They gazed at Wu Mu while they wondered if their ancestor could resist such an attack.

If it was Wu Mu’s main body, then it would definitely not be a problem. But the problem was that it wasn’t Wu Mu’s main body.

Meanwhile, the Undertaker suddenly roared with fury, and then he slammed his palm down towards the city.

As soon as his palm slammed down, the huge ethereal palm in the sky descended from midair as well.

The powerful aura it emanated seemed like it would destroy Martial Heaven City at any moment.

Suddenly, Wu Mu took a step forward, and then an invisible aura rippled up into the air.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then the aura emanated by the palm was instantly dispersed.

Meanwhile, the huge palm had arrived in the air above Wu Mu.

Suddenly, Wu Mu tapped a finger upwards, causing space in a huge area to tremble violently.

Boom!

After that, it sounded like thunder had struck the sky above the city.

The huge palm shook violently before gradually starting to crack open, and it exploded into bits just before it entered the city.

Meanwhile, Wu Mu waved his right hand. In an instant, the energy fragments from the explosion were obliterated.

Rumbling cheers instantly erupted from throughout the city.

However, An Nanjing, Wu Ye, and the others’ faces turned gloomy.

Because they noticed that Wu Mu’s body was growing ethereal.

The Wu Mu before them was just a strand of soul, so its strength was limited. Moreover, the more energy was exhausted, the faster such a strand of soul would vanish.

Ying Yu and the others were clearly aware of this, so there was joy in their eyes.

Suddenly, Wu Mu took a step forward, and then he tapped his finger in the Undertaker’s direction.

Bang!

The Undertaker was blasted over 10km away by a strand of mysterious energy.

Pu!

As soon as he stopped himself, a mouthful of blood sprayed from him. At the same time, everyone noticed that there was a bloody hole on his chest, and blood was seeping out incessantly from there.

However, Wu Mu’s body grew even more ethereal.

The Undertaker wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and looked up at Wu Mu, “As expected of one who got through Heaven Pillar Mountain. Even a strand of your soul is so strong.”

Wu Mu glanced at the Undertaker, “You’re from Heaven Pillar Mountain, so why are you trying to capture my disciple?”

“Because she can force that fellow, Yang Ye, to show himself!” The Undertaker said, “That fellow has a sword from the higher dimension, and it poses a threat to the barrier!”

“That sword….” Wu Mu fell silent for a moment, and then he gazed at the Undertaker, “That sword does pose a threat to the barrier, but if you’re strong, why would you need a sword?”

The Undertaker looked Wu Mu in the eyes, “That’s you. Don’t use your own standards to judge others. Based on my current strength, I have less than a 20% chance to succeed. But if I have that sword, it’ll rise to a 40% chance at least. It’s an opportunity for me, and it’s an opportunity for many in Heaven Pillar Mountain. I won’t give up, and neither will they!”

Wu Mu shook his head slightly, “That sword is an extremely kind and benevolent sword. If it falls into the hands of a good person, that person will definitely obtain great fortune; but if it falls into the hands of an evil person, that person will face endless troubles!”

Ying Yu suddenly said, “Yang Ye isn’t a kind or good person!”

Wu Mu glanced at Ying Yu, “That’s why he faces endless trouble.”

Ying Yu wanted to say something, but Wu Mu paid no further attention to him. Wu Mu gazed at Wu Ye and said, “You did the right thing. Even though she isn’t from our Wu Clan, she’s my disciple. So, she’s no different from a member of the Wu Clan. Use everything the Wu Clan has to protect her, understand?”

Everything!

Wu Ye’s expression changed when he heard Wu Mu. He hadn’t expected his ancestor to actually think so highly of An Nanjing!

He was about to speak when Wu Mu gazed at Ying Yu’s group, and the latter’s expressions instantly changed.

Wu Mu said, “Since you’ve come, then leave something behind!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure vanished on the spot.

Ying Yu’s expression changed drastically from the sight of this, “Retreat! Hurry!”

However, it was too late.

The experts from the Wu Clan watched as around 20 True Realm experts behind Ying Yu suddenly turned ethereal. A moment later, they vanished on the spot like they’d never existed.

Meanwhile, Wu Mu’s body grew even more ethereal.

Wu Mu glanced at An Nanjing, “If that kid, Yang Ye, doesn’t come today, then just divorce a man like that.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure dispersed in midair.

The hearts of all the experts from the Wu Clan sank.

Meanwhile, Ying Yu and the others had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces as well. That final attack from Wu Mu had made them suffer terrible losses, and it was absolutely severe.

Suddenly, the Undertaker gazed at An Nanjing. He didn’t say a word and just shot towards her.

At the same time, Wu Ye’s figure appeared in front of her, “Leave!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stomped his right foot down and shot towards the Undertaker.

Leave? An Nanjing shook her head slightly. How could she possibly leave under such circumstances? She grabbed Skysplit and transformed into a ray of golden light that vanished on the spot, and it only took an instant for her to arrive before Ying Yu’s group.

“Attack!” Ying Yu remained indifferent, and he immediately attacked with the others.

“Kill!” Meanwhile, Wu Wen’s voice resounded abruptly, and then the experts of the Wu Clan attacked.

Just like that, they entered into a fierce battle.

However, the Wu Clan was still at a disadvantage. After all, the Ying Clan had gathered the elites of five clans.

Around an hour later.

Boom!

Suddenly, a loud explosion resounded in the sky, and then a figure was blasted down. It was Wu Ye’s figure.

Even though they were both at the 6th stage of the True Realm, Wu Ye’s strength was much inferior when compared to the Undertaker.

The Undertaker was about to follow up with another attack, but An Nanjing suddenly appeared in front of Wu Ye.

Wu Ye was about to speak when she suddenly said, “Elder Ye, go help Wu Wen and the others. Leave him to me!”

Wu Ye shook his head, “You’re no match for him right now!”

An Nanjing tightened her grasp on Skysplit, “I still have to fight. Elder Ye, you just have to buy time with the others. Our help is on the way!”

Wu Ye asked, “Yang Ye?”

An Nanjing nodded.

Wu Ye asked, “Will he come?”

An Nanjing replied, “Of course!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished on the spot and appeared in front of the Undertaker. A moment later, Skysplit shot forward at him.

A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of the Undertaker’s mouth. He clenched his right fist, and the ethereal beast image appeared behind him again.

Bang!

Skysplit instantly curved. An instant later, the powerful force within his punch blasted An Nanjing over 1km back.

As soon as she stopped herself, the Undertaker appeared in front of her. However, her reaction was extremely fast, and Skysplit swept forward horizontally before the Undertaker could even attack.

The powerful force contained within Skysplit caused space to crack open around her. Meanwhile, the Undertaker’s fist slammed against Skysplit.

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and then An Nanjing was blasted over 300m back while the Undertake was merely pushed around 50m back.

A gap!

A gap in their cultivations!

The Undertaker glanced at her, “Needless to say, you’re a truly extraordinary genius, and you’re not the slightest bit inferior to those monstrous geniuses in Heaven Pillar Mountain. Unfortunately, your cultivation is too low, so you’re far from being a match for me. I don’t want to waste more time, so it’s time to finish this!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a circular blade that was thin as a cicada’s wings appeared in his grasp, and then he appeared before An Nanjing.

An Nanjing’s pupils constricted slightly while her profound energy surged madly. After that, Skysplit stabbed forward swiftly.

Meanwhile, the Undertaker didn’t try to dodge, and he just swung his circular blade at Skysplit.

Just like that, they collided against each other. As soon as they came into contact, An Nanjing’s expression changed drastically, and she intended to retreat. But it was too late.

Hiss!

The circulate blade sliced open Skysplit’s tip, and then it shot straight through…

An Nanjing relied on her formidable instinct in combat to forcefully move her body and leave the spot at the exact same moment that Skysplit was cut open.

However, it was still a little too slow.

Hiss!

An arm flew up into the air, and Skysplit, which had been sliced into two, flew up into the air with it!
