Book 13 — Fight For Succession

“Ancient cultivators?” Yang Ye continued, “Are they not the same as us?”

Qiong Qi shook his head, “The method they cultivate is different from this world, and it’s even different from the people in the medium universes of Milky Way System. They cultivate in a different way, but it achieves the same effect. Everyone is pursuing strength and eternal life.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, and then he gazed at Qiong Qi, “Will you be coming with me to the medium universe or are you returning to the large universe?” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Qiong Qi didn’t hesitate at all, “The medium universe!”

Yang Ye was curious, “Why?”

Qiong Qi replied, “I can’t go back!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Qiong Qi explained, “Actually, Milky Way System is just like this world. You have to overcome a heavenly tribulation to ascend to a medium universe from a small universe. It’s the same when traveling from a medium universe into a large universe. The heavenly tribulation you have to face isn’t like the heavenly tribulation of this world. It’s truly terrifying! Not to mention me in my current state, even if I were at my peak, I wouldn’t be absolutely confident in my ability to overcome it.”

Yang Ye asked, “Does the Milky Way System have a Heaven Dao as well?”

“Of course!” Qiong Qi continued, “Every world has a Heaven Dao, and there’s only a difference in strength between them. That friend of yours, Little Sky, is actually still in her youth. Moreover, she hasn’t formed her own Dao. Otherwise, she wouldn’t need to rely on the strength of all things!”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “Let’s skip that for now. It’s great that you’re coming with me. Because I need help.”

Qiong Qi was extremely strong. Especially now that Qiong Qi still hadn’t recovered fully. Once Qiong Qi had fully recovered, even ordinary Zenith Realm experts would definitely be no match for him.

Qiong Qi nodded, “Let me into that pagoda of yours. I’ll recover more swiftly like that.”

Yang Ye gazed at him, “Didn’t you refuse to go in there in the past?”

Qiong Qi replied, “There are too many experts. Especially now that you’re going to Milky Way System. That place is filled with all sorts of experts. So, I must recover my full strength, or I may be killed at any moment!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “It is very dangerous for you to come with me to the Yang Clan with your current strength.”

“Kid, it’s the same for you. Your current strength is too weak. Work hard on growing stronger!” As soon as he finished speaking, he entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Grow stronger!

Yang Ye slowly clenched his fists. He did need to become stronger. Not to mention the Yang Clan, just the Nether Pavilion and the Lin Clan which Yang Xuan had annihilated weren’t existences that he could resist. If he returned to the Yang Clan at his current level of strength, then not to mention saving Little Sky, he might even lose his own life.

Yang Ye stood silently on the spot for a long time, and then he immersed his consciousness into his body and sent his clone to the cultivation room on the 3rd level.

There were only two people there. Xiao Yuxi and An Nanjing.

At this moment, An Nanjing was seated cross-legged, and a small golden figure was ceaselessly displaying techniques above her.

The inheritance!

An Nanjing hadn’t fully absorbed the Martial God’s inheritance that day. So, she’d started to focus on it after entering this place. It could be said that once she completed this, her strength would undergo a qualitative leap!

As for Xiao Yuxi, she was cultivating as well.

Yang Ye didn’t disturb them and left the Primordial Pagoda. He’d just intended to leave this place when the space before him trembled, and then Yang Xuan appeared in front of him.

Yang Xuan asked, “Shall we leave now?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I still have a place I’d like to visit.”

Yang Xuan asked, “Where?”

Yang Ye looked up at the sky, “The Nether Pavilion!”

The Nether Pavilion was situated in Nether Pavilion System, and the system belonged to the Nether Pavilion. After the Nether Pavilion’s master vanished all those years ago, Nether Pavilion System had split apart. But once the new pavilion master appeared, it was united once more.

A day later, Yang Ye arrived at Nether Pavilion System.

Once he arrived here, he finally understood why the Nether Pavilion invaded Merak System. Because the spirit energy here was truly too scarce, and it wasn’t just slightly inferior to Merak System. It could be said that it would take 100 years at most for the spirit energy here to dry up completely, and then it would become a dead universe.

The Nether Pavilion.

Yang Ye went to the Nether Pavilion on his own. This Nether Pavilion wasn’t the same one on Sky Sky Continent. This was the real Nether Pavilion. The pavilion was almost 5,000km long, and it was built on a mountain that towered over 100km in the sky.

It was imposing!

Extremely imposing!

Yang Ye had just arrived at the foot of the mountain when a black robed figure appeared in front of him, “May I know what you’re doing here?”

Yang Ye immediately understood that they knew who he was.

Yang Ye replied, “Please notify your Pavilion Master. Just tell her that I, Yang Ye, am here to pay her a visit.”

The black robed man fell silent for an instant, and then he said, “Wait a moment!” He immediately vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Around a dozen breaths of time later, he appeared once more in front of Yang Ye, “Come with me!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a string of afterimages as he vanished into the distance.

Yang Ye tapped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that followed after the black robed man.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive before a hall, and then black robed man gestured for him to go in.

Yang Ye nodded slightly and entered the hall. The hall was huge, and there was only a single person in it. The Master of Nether Pavilion.

Just like before, he couldn’t see her appearance.

She spoke abruptly, “Do you need something?”

Yang Ye replied, “I’m going back to the Yang Clan. But I’m all alone. I hope the Nether Pavilion will help me.”

He wasn’t a fool, so he wouldn’t just go against the Yang Clan right after he got back. That would be no different than asking for death. He had to obtain the support of some of the Yang Clan’s members. Only then could he fight Yang Yan and Yang Danqing.

Besides that, he needed external support! He’d found out from Yang Xuan that every single disciple of the Yang Clan that tempered themselves in the outside world would have their own forces. Those forces would be the biggest help they had when fighting for the position of successor.

Because besides the disciples of the Yang Clan who were fighting for the position of successor, no other members of the Yang Clan were allowed to participate in the competition. It was to guarantee absolute fairness and prevent the Yang Clan from splitting apart internally.

Of course, the members of the Yang Clan would still take sides in secret, but they just won’t openly assist those disciples.

In short, the disciples of the Yang Clan who were fighting for the position of successor could only rely on themselves. The powers they formed on their own or the external support they obtained was considered a part of their strength.

Yang Ye was here to see the Nether Pavilion’s Master because he hoped to attain the Nether Pavilion’s support. Fighting on his own? He didn’t fear that. However, it was too tiring. Moreover, his main objective was to rescue Little Sky. If the Nether Pavilion was willing to help him, then his chances would be much greater.

A moment of silence ensued within the hall, and then the Nether Pavilion’s Master said, “Why should we?”

Yang Ye replied, “Don’t you want your Nether Pavilion to enter an even higher level universe? Presently, you have a chance, and that chance is me. You can enter a higher level universe through me.”

“Or we may vanish from this world because of you, right?” She said, “Yang Ye, both of us are very well aware of the strength that the Yang Clan possesses. Even though my Nether Pavilion isn’t weak, it’s far inferior from the Yang Clan. If you win the position of successor, then it would not be bad, but what if you lose? During the fight for the throne in royal families, how many princes are able to live peaceful lives at the end of it? If you lose, would the winning successor let you live? Would my Nether Pavilion be allowed to live?”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “But what if I do win? If I become the Yang Clan’s successor, your Nether Pavilion would be able to instantly enter Milky Way System and even move there. At that time, many experts of your Nether Pavilion will be able to attain the Zenith Realm with the Yang Clan’s help, right?”

She replied with a question, “Why do you think that you can win?”

Yang Ye replied with a question as well, “Why do you think that I can’t?”

She took a step forward, “You’re the one who has to convince me. I don’t have to try and convince myself. Understand?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while and said, “No matter what I say, it isn’t important. The important thing is whether you believe in me, right?”

The Nether Pavilion’s Master should be aware of his strength and even everything he had. So, nothing he said would make a difference. The important thing was whether she believed in him. If she did, then he didn’t have to say anything and she would choose to work together with him; but if she didn’t believe in him and felt that he would never be able to succeed, then it wouldn’t make a difference no matter how he tried to prove himself.”

Silence filled the hall.

Around 15 minutes later, she said, “I hope our cooperation is a pleasant one!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, remained silent for a short while and said, “Likewise!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and left.

Once he left, Fan Yinyu suddenly appeared by the Nether Pavilion’s Master’s side. She looked in the direction of the exit and said, “You’re confident in him?”

The Nether Pavilion’s Master shook her head, “Even though his natural talent isn’t bad, it’s probably not the best in the Yang Clan.”

“I understand!” Fan Yinyu nodded, “Just as he said, it’s a chance for us. A chance to enter an even higher level universe. Such a chance is worth such a gamble.”

The Nether Pavilion’s Master nodded, “Indeed. However, the reason I agreed is because of his character. He’s loyal. So long as we don’t betray him, he will definitely not betray us.”

“Indeed!” Fan Yinyu continued, “He always seeks to maintain a clear conscience. So, we don’t have to worry about him playing tricks on us.”

The Nether Pavilion’s Master ordered, “Go make the necessary preparations!”

Fan Yinyu nodded slightly and was about to leave. However, she suddenly seemed to have thought of something and said, “There’s something that has troubled me for a long time. I hope you can give me the answer I seek.”

The Nether Pavilion’s Master said, “Go on!”

Fan Yinyu asked, “Where did Pavilion Master Shaosi go?” She was naturally speaking about the Nether Pavilion’s former master.

The Nether Pavilion’s Master fell silent for a moment, “She went to look for someone.”

“Who?”

“An old man in a Daoist’s robe!”
