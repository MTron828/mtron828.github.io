Chapter 951 – The Death Of A Saint!

There was a dense ocean of inner cores there. There were over 10,000 of them, and the worst was at the Half-Saint Realm!

How terrifying was it to look at over 10,000 inner cores from Half-Saints?

The 2 publicly acknowledged currencies in the Radiant Dimension were extreme-grade energy stones and inner cores. They were popular currencies throughout the past because they were needed for all things like setting up formations, crafting talismans, and cultivating.

If the inner cores of demon beasts were compared to extreme-grade energy stones, then its value was far superior. Especially the inner cores of demon beasts at the Monarch Realm and above. Because they were prerequisites to set up formations, craft talismans, and refine weapons. Moreover, formations and offensive structures like the grand formation and energy cannons on Ocean of Clouds City required inner cores to be activated. However, the Pine Prefecture had 12 Demon Kings, so how could anyone dare to kill demon beasts at the Monarch Realm and above without any restraint?

Under such circumstances, inner cores were naturally much more precious than extreme-grade energy stones.

A single inner core from a Half-Saint was comparable to the value of a million extreme-grade energy stones, and there was no supply!

So how many extreme-grade energy stones could 10,000 be exchanged for?”

Yang Ye didn’t try to count it. In any case, it was a huge amount that would be sufficient for him to use on himself for a lifetime.

Yang Ye took a deep breath and suppressed the joy and excitement in his heart. He looked towards the side, and the contents of the ‘Treasure Room’ were there.

Compared to the inner cores, the number of treasures from the ‘Treasure Room’ was quite scarce as there were only 10.

However, Yang Ye’s heart started thumping again.

Because the weakest amongst them was at the Saint Rank, and there even was one at the Divine Rank!

Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto the Divine Rank treasure first. It had quite a weird appearance. It was a palm sized green cube. It was completely green, and it was spinning slowly.

Besides the cube, there were 9 other Saint Rank treasures, but all of them were low-grade Saint Rank treasures. At this moment, all of those treasures had moved far away from the cube as if they feared it.

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment before he issued a command in his heart, and he left the space within the ancient sheath. At the same time, he took the green cube out with him. Yang Ye walked over to it.

Suddenly, a ray of dazzling green light erupted from it and smashed towards Yang Ye. Yang Ye’s expression didn’t change at all. His Quasi Void Rank intents swept out from within him and obstructed the green light, and then a moment of silence ensued before an explosion erupted. The dazzling green light was blasted into pieces!

Meanwhile, the green cube suddenly shook violently and grew around 100 times larger before trapping Yang Ye within it.

Yang Ye’s expression changed a little when he witnessed this scene. Because he noticed that the space within the cube had suddenly changed. Its structure had changed! The structure of the space around him had been altered!

Before this, the space around him was normally orientated, but the space within the cube had actually warped and overlapped. Now, the space around him actually didn’t have the orientations of up, down, left, and right. There was only a strange warped and overlapped form of space. Such circumstances were very strange, extremely strange. In any case, Yang Ye had never encountered such a scene in his life!

At this moment, he sensed a terrifying force start pulling against him, and it seemed to intend to warp and fold him as well!

Yang Ye was shocked by this. He hurriedly released his Quasi Void Rank sword intent and slaughter intent. However, he noticed to his shock that they were actually instantly warped upon appearing here. Moreover, they were completely imprisoned by a mysterious force. Besides that, Yang Ye noticed to his astonishment that he was actually unable to move right now!

“What is that?” Yang Ye had a solemn expression on his face. At this moment, he recalled what the Wolf Empress had said in the hall. She’d said that there was a Divine Rank treasure called the Dimensional Cube which could trap him. Moreover, even Saints wouldn’t be able to escape it in a short period. Obviously, the green cube before him was that Dimensional Cube!

If she wasn’t lying, then the Dimensional Cube could even trap saints. Perhaps it would only last for a short while, but that was still extremely terrifying to him! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The strength of a Saint surpassed the energy of the Laws, and it even transcended the world. It could be said that very few things in the world could pose a threat to Saints. However, the Dimensional Cube could affect such Saints, so how terrifying was that?”

Even though the Dimensional Cube was only reacting instinctively and protecting itself, Yang Ye didn’t dare underestimate it at all.

Since his slaughter intent and sword intent were useless against it, Yang Ye released his Sword Domain.

As soon as the Sword Domain appeared, the surroundings were completely covered in pitch black darkness while the tearing force immediately stopped. At the same time, the space around him started to wriggle slowly.

Yang Ye was the overlord within the Sword Domain. So, while the Dimension Cube was strong, it wasn’t being controlled by anyone, so it didn’t have the ability to break open his Sword Domain.

It didn’t take long for the space around him to return to normal while the Dimension Cube returned to its original size. After that, it instinctively intended to flee, but it was forcefully suppressed by Yang Ye’s Sword Domain, sword intent, and slaughter intent. Yang Ye walked over to it and pondered deeply for a long time while looking at it. After that, he flipped his palm, and the Herculean Sword appeared in his grasp before he pointed it at the cube.

“Submit or die!” Yang Ye gazed coldly at it while speaking without a shred of emotion in his voice. He knew that it could understand him.

The cube trembled violently while a strand of green light suddenly erupted from within it. However, it had only just shot forward when Yang Ye’s sword intent and slaughter intent obliterated it.

A ferocious glow flashed through his eyes, “Do you think that I can’t destroy you?”

As he spoke, a strand of Decay Laws appeared on the tip of his sword. In an instant, the air around that spot was obliterated. At the same time, a black spot in space appeared there as well. Moreover, that black spot was about to spread but Yang Ye’s Sword Domain suppressed it.

Yang Ye didn’t know whether his Decay Laws could pose a threat to Saints as he’d never tried it. However, he was confident that it could pose a threat to the cube before him.

As soon as the Decay Laws appeared here, the cube started to tremble. It was terrified!

“I’ll give you one last chance. Submit or die!” Yang Ye’s voice sounded ferocious. At the same time, the tip of his sword moved slightly closed to the cube.

The cube started trembling even more violently.

“You refuse? Then die!” Ferocity covered Yang Ye’s face as he took the Herculean Sword in both hands and swiftly smashed it towards the Dimension Cube. At this moment, it was trembling even more violently as if it was having a seizure!

Suddenly, a ray of violet light flashed, and then the violet mink appeared in front of Yang Ye and stopped him. There was a trace of anger mixed within the anxiety on her face, and she started waving her claws around incessantly!

A long time passed before the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched, “You’re telling me that it was willing to submit a long time ago?”

The violet mink nodded.

Yang Ye was slightly angry, “Why didn’t it display its willingness?”

“Because it can’t speak and was suppressed by you, so it couldn’t move at all. Besides that, it has displayed its willingness. Didn’t you see it trembling? It was begging for mercy!” The violet mink spoke the human tongue out of her anxiousness, and then she immediately regretted what she’d done and glared at Yang Ye with anger and embarrassment.

Yang Ye blushed when he heard her. So I was mistaken....

Yang Ye smiled with embarrassment, and then he gazed at the cube, “Since you’re willing to submit, then come to me!”

“What do you mean come to you!?” The violet mink slapped him on the head, “Drop a droplet of your blood on it!”

Yang Ye was shocked, “That’s all?”

She shook her head, “Of course not. The main reason is that it’s willing to submit to you. If it wasn’t, then it wouldn’t make a difference even if you dropped a million droplets of your blood on it!”

“So that’s why!” Yang Ye nodded, and then flicked a droplet of his blood onto the cube. As soon as the blood touched the cube, it instantly vanished, and then Yang Ye’s frowned a little. A long time passed before Yang Ye’s frown eased up. At this moment, a link had been formed between him and the cube!

Yang Ye dispersed the Sword Domain, sword intent, and slaughter intent before he gestured with his right hand. The Dimensional Cube immediately flew into his grasp, and then he issued a command in his heart. The cube swiftly expanded to a few dozen times larger than it was, and it enveloped him.

“Not only can it imprison and kill others, it can be used defensively as well! It truly is a treasure that combines both offense and defense into one!” A wisp of excitement appeared on Yang Ye’s face as he sensed how solid the space around him was. If he used it to trap someone, then even a Saint would be trapped for some time. In other words, if he used it defensively, then it could resist at least one or two attacks from a Saint!

It could resist the attacks of Saints!

Just thinking about that caused the excitement and joy on Yang Ye’s face to increase. Unfortunately, the rate it exhausted his profound energy at was too terrifying. In less than a breath of time, a fifth of his profound energy had actually been exhausted! In other words, if he used it to trap someone, then he could trap a person for 5 breaths of time at most; if he used it defensively, he could only defend himself for 5 breaths of time as well!

Even though it was a slight flaw in an otherwise perfect treasure, Yang Ye was very satisfied. After all, he was only at the peak of the Monarch Realm, and he would definitely be able to use the Dimensional Cube even better once he attained the Half-Saint Realm.

Yang Ye issued a command in his heart, and the Dimension Cube immediately entered the sea of consciousness behind the center of his brows.

Right when he was about to withdraw and inspect the other 9 Saint Rank treasures....

Bang!

A loud explosion suddenly resounded in the sky.

At this moment, the heavens and the earth were trembling, and then a wave of blood red covered the entire sky before it started raining. It was a rain of blood!

At this moment, the gazes of all the experts throughout Pine Prefecture had been shot towards the direction of Ocean of Clouds City.

A Saint had fallen!
