Chapter 2733 – Trash!

Terrifying!

That was Yang Ye’s first impression!

At this moment, he’d broken out in cold sweat. Even if the woman before him wasn’t on par with Tu, she was definitely not much weaker. No, she was definitely not weaker than Tu!

She’d instantly obliterated First God’s body upon escaping her cage, and such a feat was something only Tu could accomplish!

As for the strongest form of Destiny, that was a given.

At this moment, Yang Ye felt quite a bit of lingering fear. Because if Yang Busi were to target him, he would definitely be dead!

He was really no match for her!

During the era of Destiny, there had been countless geniuses, and she was definitely a genius among geniuses, just like Qi Bitian.

Zuo Mu and the others’ expressions had changed.

They were in trouble!

Big trouble!

They’d gone to great lengths to free this peerless expert, but it was actually Yang Ye’s ancestor!

His ancestor!

Yang Ye’s ancestor!

Was there greater bullshit than this?

Zuo Mu and the others had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces. It was like they’d been forced to eat a pile of shit!

There was nothing more aggrieving and sad than this!

Zuo Mu looked slightly to the side, “All of you leave!”

Leave!

First God didn’t hesitate to turn around and leave. At that instant, he knew that he was no match for this woman. She was someone on the same level as the form of Destiny known as Tu!

Such an old existence wasn’t someone he could go against!

Even someone as proud as Emperor Li chose to retreat.

Only Zuo Mu remained!

Yang Ye glanced at First God’s group, and then he howled with fury, “How dare you attack my Yang Clan! I'll never stop hunting you!”

He charged at them as he shouted.

After all, why wouldn’t he hit them when they were down?

Yang Busi nodded slightly when she heard him, and there was admiration in her eyes.

This descendant of hers had good talent, strength, and courage!

Yang Ye seemed increasingly better to her. After all, he was from her own clan! Moreover, Yang Busi was someone who regarded her clan as absolutely important. So, she was naturally happy to have such a descendant in her clan.

Actually, she paid more attention to An Nanjing, and she liked An Nanjing even more!

Yang Busi restrained her thoughts and gazed at Zuo Mu, “You’re here to stop me?”

Zuo Mu spoke solemnly, “Senior, you broke your promise!”

Yang Busi chuckled fiercely, “I broke my promise? Do you realize that you want me to kill a descendant of my clan?”

Zuo Mu fell silent for a moment, and then he shook his head, “There’s no need to say anything. We were fools.”

Fools!

It would be a lie if he said that he didn’t regret it. Actually, in the beginning, he’d been slightly worried that Yang Busi may be related to Yang Ye. However, Mo Yu had confidently guaranteed that there was no link between them.

And he was of the same mind too. After all, how could people who were born so many eras apart be related?

However, they were related.

Zuo Mu took a step back and cleared his mind of all distracting thoughts while tightening his grip on his saber.

It was a brand new saber!

Yang Busi laughed coldly, and then she swung her saber forward.

At practically the exact same moment, Zuo Mu suddenly drew his saber!

The world cracked open before it!

This attack carried an aura of no retreat.

He had no confidence in winning against an expert like her, but he dared to fight her, and he was even risking his life to do so!

However, he was facing an overlord of an era!

There had been countless geniuses in that era, and Yang Busi and Qi Bitian didn’t represent all of them. However, all of these geniuses were very unlucky.

Because they were born in the same era as Destiny.

Countless peerless existences of that era were forced to bow before Destiny!

Even then, it didn’t stop them from being extremely strong.

As soon as Zuo Mu’s attack descended, he was blasted 30km away!

Suppression!

Absolute suppression!

As soon as he stopped himself, a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth.

Yang Busi spoke indifferently, “You’re quite capable to have survived an attack of mine. But it’s pointless.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she suddenly hurled her saber at Zuo Mu.

It was a very normal attack, but it contained overbearing force!

Zuo Mu pulled his right foot backward and tightened his grip on his saber. When faced with an attack he couldn’t resist, all he could do was fight!

Fight with his life on the line!

Zuo Mu’s saber shot forward and descended!

Hiss!

Zuo Mu’s saber instantly exploded apart, but right when Yang Busi’s saber was about to chop off his head, a pitch black hand suddenly grabbed Zuo Mu’s shoulder and tossed him over 1km away. At the same time, the black hand curled into a fist that slammed against the saber.

Bam!

Yang Busi’s saber was instantly blasted away!

She stretched out her right hand, and the saber returned firmly into her grasp.

She looked into the distance. There was only a hand there, a hand that had emerged from within space!

Yang Busi glanced indifferently at it, “What the heck are you?”

She hurled her saber once more.

The saber tore through the air and everything else before it!

The pitch black hand was clenched into a fist once more, and then it punched forward!

It forcibly stopped Yang Busi’s terrifying attack, but that wasn’t the end of it. The fist shook abruptly, and the saber was blasted away.

Yang Busi remained indifferent as she stretched out her right hand, and the saber landed firmly in her grasp again.

Meanwhile, the black hand suddenly grabbed Zuo Mu and vanished on the spot.

Yang Busi was about to stop it when a pair of eyes soundlessly appeared above her.

She frowned upon seeing them.

The eyes stared at Yang Busi.

Yang Busi ignored the eyes and looked into the distance. It was in the direction Yang Ye had chased First God and the others!

Yang Busi took a step forward, and the space before her turned ethereal and her figure seemed like it was passing through space. But right at this moment, a huge fist suddenly slammed down at her from above!

Yang Busi frowned slightly and shot a glance upward, “Just you wait! You piece of trash!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she took another step with her other foot.

She instantly vanished on the spot.

At the other side.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing were chasing after First God’s group. First God was just a soul now, so he couldn’t fight at all. It could be said that this was the best time for Yang Ye to kill him!

Emperor Li and the other black robed expert were clearly aware of that. So, they didn’t fight Yang Ye and An Nanjing, and they were just fleeing madly!

When Yang Ye fled, they couldn’t catch up to him, and similarly, Yang Ye and An Nanjing couldn’t catch up to them when First God and the others chose to focus on fleeing!

Just like that, one side fled while the other side chased. It didn’t take long for them to return to the 9th layer of space!

In the 9th layer of space, Yang Ye finally caught up to them with the assistance of Snowy’s spirit energy.

Emperor Li stared at Yang Ye. At this moment, he had an extremely gloomy expression on his face. After all, it was an absolute embarrassment to be pursued by Yang Ye like this!

They weren’t afraid of Yang Ye, of course. They were afraid of Yang Ye’s backing, that woman they’d just freed!

What was it like to lift a rock only to drop it on one’s own feet?𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

They’d done just that!

Emperor Li was about to speak when Yang Ye and An Nanjing suddenly vanished on the spot. Emperor Li’s expression changed slightly as he instantly vanished on the spot. At the same time, Sky Saber and the mysterious black robed expert vanished along with him.

Rumble!

In an instant, the 9th layer of space started to tremble violently, and numerous afterimages were slamming against each other incessantly.

As for First God, he didn’t join the battle and just fled. But Yang Ye and An Nanjing were chasing after him!

Because he was the easiest to kill!

Emperor Li, the other mysterious black robed expert, or even Sky Saber weren’t that easy to kill!

First God felt absolutely aggrieved. He, First God, had once been one of the strongest existences in the world. Even though his era couldn’t compare with Destiny’s era, he was still one of the strongest!

Yet now, he was being chased and hunted like a dog!

It was an absolute humiliation!

Emperor Li and the others didn’t abandon First God. At a time like this, every expert they lost was a huge loss to them! Moreover, they were very well aware that Yang Ye would absolutely not stop after he killed First God!

Just like that, both sides fought as they fled!

However, it didn’t take long for Yang Ye and An Nanjing to be suddenly blasted away.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing stopped themselves, and the space ahead of them had cracked open to reveal a pitch black hand.

It was the same hand he’d encountered the other day!

Yang Ye’s face was gloomy. He suddenly stomped his right foot down and appeared before the hand, and then he slashed down while holding his sword with both hands!

Hiss!

Space was instantly sliced open.

Meanwhile, the hand slammed a punch forward, and it struck the blade of Yang Ye’s sword!

A head-on collision!

Boom!

In an instant, Yang Ye was blasted over 1km away. Once he stopped himself, his entire right arm started to tremble violently. Actually, it wasn’t just his arm, even his sword was trembling!

At this moment, Yang Ye couldn’t feel his entire right arm!

The black hand didn’t launch another attack after it punched Yang Ye flying, and it just waved lightly. Emperor Li and the others vanished on the spot.

Just a breath of time after it vanished with Emperor Li’s group, a woman arrived not too far away from Yang Ye.

It was Yang Busi!

She shot a glance where the black hand had vanished and said, “Do you know who the heck that was?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’ve never seen its owner!”

Yang Busi nodded, “Be careful if you encounter it again, and don’t fight it if you can!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Yang Busi replied indifferently, “Because you’re absolutely no match for it!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
