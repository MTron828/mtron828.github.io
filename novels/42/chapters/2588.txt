Chapter 2589

The Divine Abode was a mysterious place, and ordinary treasures were nothing to them.

Even a Super Divine Treasure wasn’t that precious to them!

But a Worldborn Fruit was different!

It was a practically extinct treasure!

The rarer something was, the more valuable it would be!

Suddenly, Zuo Qing smiled, “I apologize for my failure to discern your ability.”

Yang Ye stopped and gazed at her, “So, I can stay and drink here?”

Zuo Qing smiled, “If you want, then of course.”

Yang Ye wanted to say more, but the Ascetic suddenly said, “Don’t be offended. She wasn’t looking down on you. Because not to mention you, even I wouldn’t be able to drink here if I wasn’t a merchant and have accumulated some wealth.”

Zuo Qing grinned and didn’t say anything.

Even though a Worldborn Fruit was extremely precious, it wasn’t precious to the point of making the Divine Abode lower itself to the point of begging Yang Ye to stay!

This was the Divine Abode!

Yang Ye didn’t make too much of a fuss about it and sat down.

He wasn’t that kid who would go too far due to the slightest displeasure.

Now, he looked at everything comprehensively and carefully.

Because he could only rely on himself now. So, it was best to keep a low profile while he didn’t possess sufficient strength! Moreover, it was how the world worked. There were many circles that one couldn’t enter without sufficient strength, and if someone tried to get in by force, the members of that circle wouldn’t even acknowledge and accept that person. However, if one was sufficiently strong, there would be no need to do it by force because they would naturally become accepting!

Just like this very moment!

Zuo Qing nodded to them and left.

The Ascetic smiled, “Put it away.”

Yang Ye gazed at the Worldborn Fruit and grinned while he spoke inwardly, “Thank you.”

Obviously, it was Qi Bitian who’d given him the fruit.

Qi Bitian puckered her lips in the Primordial Pagoda, “I just couldn’t stand the sight of her! It had nothing to do with you!”

Outside the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye didn’t put the Worldborn Fruit away. He sliced it into three and passed two pieces to the Ascetic and Elder Zhu, “I wasn’t joking. Since you’re buying me a drink, I’ll treat you to some fruit!”

The Ascetic glanced at the fruit before him and gazed at Yang Ye, “Young Brother, it’s very precious. It’s precious because it’s rare. If you sell it to the right person, you may even be able to get a divine treasure. So…”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s fate that brought us together. Anyway, I really don’t have anything else that’s valuable enough. Anyway, it’s fate that is making me share this fruit with you, yet you’re telling me about all of that. This isn’t right, don’t you think so?”

The Ascetic glanced at Yang Ye, and he just smiled and gazed at Elder Zhu, “I really haven’t tried a Worldborn Fruit in my lifetime. Let’s have a taste of it!”

Elder Zhu fell silent for an instant, and then he withdrew three white jade cups!

Yang Ye’s eyes lit up when he saw them. His intuition told him that they were treasures!

“Universe Cups!” The Ascetic was quite surprised, “I didn’t expect these things to be in your possession.”

Elder Zhu nodded slightly, and then he flicked two of them over to Yang Ye and the Ascetic, “It’s yours now!”

Yang Ye didn’t really offer much of a reaction to it, but the Ascetic shook his head repeatedly, “Elder Zhu, the Universe Cups are…”

Elder Zhu glanced indifferently at him, “You just have to say something about it. It’s normal for merchants to give a lot of consideration to gains and losses, but can you not do it in front of me? I said it’s yours, so it’s yours.”

He glanced at Yang Ye and continued, “While this kid is quite a sly one, and he’s weak too, but his character isn’t bad. It suits my taste!”

Yang Ye smiled with embarrassment. The reticent old man was quite a nice person.

The Ascetic smiled and gazed at Yang Ye, “Young Brother, you just don’t know about the Universe Cups. It’s equivalent to a divine treasure, and a rare divine treasure too. Even though it’s just a cup, it has a world within it that can hold an entire ocean. Besides that, it’s made of special materials that allows it to hold many rare existences like the legendary Heavenly Water. Right, it can hold Boundless Water too. Of course, doing so is prohibited! So…”

Elder Zhu glanced at the Ascetic with displeasure, “Are you done?!”

The Ascetic shrugged and didn’t say another word.

Meanwhile, Zuo Qing appeared before them again, and she was holding a violet wine jug.

She grinned and placed it on the down, “Please enjoy yourself!”

The Ascetic flicked a spatial ring to her. She took it and was about to leave when the Ascetic suddenly said, “Miss Zuo Qing, the Divine Abode suddenly released this thousand-year-old brew and spread news of it far and wide. Can you reveal why?”

She smiled, “You’ll find out soon.”

She didn’t say anything else and just left.

The Ascetic poured the wine into three cups, “Ignore them for now. Let’s try this wine!”

Yang Ye took a sip. It was sweet. It did carry the bitterness of wine, but it was mostly sweetness combined with a little spiciness.

That’s it?

Yang Ye wondered.

Suddenly, it was like a ball of flames was burning within him, and it felt like his internal organs would be turned to ash!

Yang Ye’s face turned red as he forcefully endured it!

Elder Zhu and the Ascetic exchanged smiles. They ignored him and continued drinking and eating the Worldborn Fruit!

The Ascetic took a bite and greedily sucked in a breath of air, “If I wasn’t worried about spoiling this moment, I would really want to sell this fruit! It would definitely sell for a nice price!”

He gazed at Elder Zhu and continued, “I feel like eating it like this is such a waste!”

Elder Zhu took a bite and ignored him.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s face was growing redder, and his blood was surging!

The Ascetic glanced at Yang Ye, “His bloodline isn’t bad. His ancestor was definitely someone extraordinary. Unfortunately, that isn’t a good thing!”

A strong ancestor was good for some people because they could benefit from the ancestor’s bloodline!

But it was bad for some people too. Because it would be very difficult for them to transcend the bloodline of their ancestors. In other words, it would be very difficult to reverse their bloodline!

Yang Ye was showing signs of it, but no one knew if he would succeed in the end!

Yang Ye’s blood had been fully stimulated, and it was surging.

Yang Ye sat on the chair and forcefully suppressed it. But no matter how hard he tried, his bloodline was surging, and it was growing stronger and stronger, as if it would explode out of his blood vessels at any moment!

Yang Ye gazed at the Ascetic and Elder Zhu. The Ascetic grinned and said, “It isn’t just any ordinary wine. While it isn’t as precious as your Worldborn Fruit, it has some unique effects that your fruit does not possess. Your bloodline should rise by a level thanks to it.”

Yang Ye’s body started to tremble, and even the blood vessels beneath his skin had started to shake!

Yang Ye was shocked and hurriedly circulated his Primordial Violet Energy. The Primordial Violet Energy surged into his blood vessels, and then his blood gradually calmed down.

Around an hour later, Yang Ye felt like his blood had fully calmed down. Now, as soon as he circulated his energy, faint red light would arise around him!

Even when he swung his sword, the red light would remain!

“Congratulations!” The Ascetic smiled, “Your bloodline is at your own peak, the peak of your ancestor. If you are able to reverse it, then you will undergo another transformation. Only then can you be considered to be truly part of the strong.”

Yang Ye scanned his bloodline. At this moment, he felt full of energy!

It was energy that came from his bloodline!

Fight!

At this moment, Yang Ye really wanted to fight and turn the world upside down!

“Calm down!” The Ascetic smiled, “While your bloodline is at your own peak and you’ve fully awakened its full strength, you haven’t reversed your bloodline and formed your own bloodline. So, while your strength has improved slightly, it hasn’t improved that much.”

Yang Ye naturally understood what he meant. The Ascetic was telling him to maintain a low profile!

Even if he could reverse his bloodline, it was still best to keep a low profile in this damnable place!

Yang Ye calmed himself and took another mouthful of the wine. It felt just as before, but this time, his bloodline didn’t undergo any changes!

The Ascetic smiled, “It’s most precious when consumed for the first time! Right, the Divine Abode has one other type of wine, the 10,000-year-old brew. If you can drink that, you may be able to immediately reverse your bloodline.”

Yang Ye’s eyes lit up, “How do I get it? I mean, how do I buy some?”

The Ascetic and Elder Zhu exchanged smiles and remained silent.

Yang Ye glanced at them, “It’s not for sale?”

The Ascetic nodded, “Indeed. I once tried to exchange the Ancient Bell for a cup, but I failed. It’s a very precious wine!”

Elder Zhu suddenly said, “They only exchange it for favors. A cup for a favor, and it’s only open to those acknowledged by them. As far as I know, one person did come here and get a cup!”

Yang Ye asked, “Who?”

Elder Zhu smiled and was about to speak.

Suddenly, Zuo Qing led a man up to the 2nd floor, but they didn’t stop and were continuing upward. However, the man by her side stopped abruptly and gazed at Yang Ye. He grinned when he saw Yang Ye, “Long time no see. Want to have a drink on the 3rd floor?”

Zuo Qing gazed at Yang Ye with astonishment.

Yang Ye was stunned.
