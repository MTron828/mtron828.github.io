Chapter 246 – Extraordinary Dark Horse!

When they saw the black robed man called Lin Xiuran release Sword Intent from within him, countless people in the surroundings were shocked. Sword Intent was the stuff of legends. In the Ascensions Rankings of the past, participants who’d comprehended Sword Intent were very rarely seen, yet two had already appeared this time.

How are we supposed to advance with geniuses like these? At this moment, countless participants felt depressed in their hearts.

On the wall of the Imperial Palace, Qing Yun’zi’s brows knit together lightly when he saw the black robed young man reveal Sword Intent, and then he glanced at Su Qingshi and Yu Heng. However, he saw that both of them had calm expressions as if they knew since the beginning, and it caused his brows to knit together even more tightly.

Yang Ye was slightly surprised as he stood below Arena No.9. However, there as even more interest on his face because up until now, he hadn’t seen a single person that had comprehended Sword Intent. But now, one such person had appeared before him. He wanted to see how the young man utilized the Sword intent.

On the arena, Qin Youran was merely slightly stunned, and then he recovered from his shock and said, “Looks like you want me to send you down!”

The young man held the black iron sword in hand as he walked slowly towards Qin Youran, and he said as he walked, “In my opinion, the haughty always suffer terrible consequences. I think you’re no exception as well. You’re said to be the number two expert in the southern territory’s younger generation. So, your blood is qualified to be fed to my sword!”

“Haha!!” Qin Youran started laughing from extreme rage, and he said, “My blood is qualified to be fed to your sword? Why don’t you come and give it a try?”

The young man nodded. He stopped, closed his eyes, and then suddenly opened them. In an instant, countless sword lights flashed throughout the surroundings, and in just a moment, the entire arena was enveloped by countless sword lights. Of course, Qin Youran who was filled with confidence had been enveloped by it as well!

In the blink of an eye, the sword lights dispersed, and then the two people on the arena were revealed. When they saw these two people, or more precisely, when they saw Qin Youran, the countless participating profounders in the surroundings and those great figures on the Imperial Palace’s wall revealed astounded expressions.

At this moment, Qin Youran’s clothes were completely gone, and his bare body seemed as if it had been cut by a myriad of blades because it was densely covered in bloody marks. Even his face was densely covered in marks of the sword. At this moment, not only had Qin Youran’s face been destroyed, he seemed like he’d just emerged from a pool of blood and was covered in blood!

Even though it was like that, Qin Youran still hadn’t died at this moment!

At this moment, the expressions of Wenren Yue, Leng Xinran, and Yang Ye had become slightly solemn because this instantly executed attack was truly quite terrifying.

A wisp of surprise flashed in Lin Xiuran’s eyes when he noticed that Qin Youran was still alive. He pondered deeply for a moment, and then he seemed to have thought of something and said, “All those years ago, the Founding Emperor possesses leather armor that was crafted from the skin and bones of a Heaven Devouring Python. According to rumor, that leather armor can be fused into the sky to protect the bones and meridians within the entire body. I presume that you’re wearing that high-grade Earth Rank leather armor right now?”

At this moment, Qin Youran didn’t flare up with rage. He twisted his wrist and a pitch black spear appeared in his palm. He slowly raised the speak to point it at Lin Xiuran from afar, and then he said, “Sword Intent combined with a mid-grade Earth Rank technique was actually so swift and fierce. Looks like you wanted to finish me with a single move. Unfortunately, you failed to do so. So, it’s time for you to die now!”

As soon as he finished speaking, an invisible force surged explosively from the spear in Qin Youran’s hand!

Spear Intent!

Countless people in the surroundings were shocked once more when they witnessed this scene. However, it was expected as well because Qin Youran’s reputation in the southern territory was only inferior to Yuan Tong. So, it was very normal for Qin Youran to have comprehended a form of Intent.

When he sensed the Spear Intent, a wisp of a cold smile arose on the corners of Lin Xiuran’s mouth, and then he said, “1st level Spear Intent? That’s slightly insufficient!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the black iron sword in his hand shook lightly, and then Sword Intent that was even sharper and ferocious that before had surged out from it.

In the air, Qin Youran’s Spear Intent was instantly dispersed by this Sword Intent!

2nd level Sword Intent!

When they witnessed this scene, the expressions of Qing Yun’zi and the others on the wall had changed slightly. If it was merely 1st level Sword Intent, then Lin Xiuran’s natural talent could only be said to be not bad. But if it was 2nd level Sword Intent, then it wasn’t just now bad, it was monstrous. 2nd level Sword intent was already sufficient to pose a threat to Qin Youran, Wenren Yue, and the others! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

A wisp of interest appeared in Yuan Tong’s eyes when he saw the 2nd level Sword Intent that Lin Xiuran revealed, and then he said, “2nd level Sword Intent? In this way, it’s going to be interesting.”

In his opinion, the more monstrous geniuses appeared here, the better it was. Because only in that way would his position as the Martial God become even firmer!

Yu Heng nodded slightly and revealed a wisp of a smile while he said in his heart, “As expected of someone selected by Martial Uncle Zui. With such natural talent and strength, he’ll definitely become a top pillar for my Sword Sect!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yu Heng seemed to have thought of something, and he glanced at Yang Ye who stood in the crowd below, yet his gaze merely stayed on Yang Ye for a few breaths of time before it was moved away.

If Lin Xiuran didn’t exist, then he would feel extremely regretful for having missed the opportunity to obtain a disciple like Yang Ye in the sect. However, now that the Sword Sect had Lin Xiuran, the feeling of regret in his heart had naturally faded away.... After all, there was a better replacement!

On the arena, Qin Youran finally revealed a wisp of a solemn expression. Even he couldn’t look down upon 2nd level Sword Intent. He lightly let out a breath of air, and then he took a step forward and said, “I never expected that I, Qin Youran, would encounter the first dark horse in the competition. But don’t worry, you’ll be stopped right here!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the black spear in his hand shook violently, and then an extremely domineering and invisible force surged out from the tip of his spear!

2nd level Spear Intent!

Everyone in the surroundings was shocked once more.

Lin Xiuran’s eyes narrowed, and then he said, “As expected of the number two genius of the southern territory. You’ve actually comprehended 2nd level Spear Intent. Since it’s like that, then let’s see if your Spear Intent or my Sword Intent is stronger!” As soon as he finished speaking, Lin Xiuran stabbed his black iron sword at Qin Youran from afar!

in an instant, countless strands of sword qi shot out explosively from the tip of the black iron sword. These strands of sword qi were like shooting stars that were descending from the heavens, and they emanated sharp whistles as they tore through the sky and shot explosively towards Qin Youran in a dense mass.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched when he witnessed this scene because the technique Ling Xiuran had executed was the Energy Split Sword Technique! Moreover, Lin Xiuran had cultivated it to the highest level. Actually, that was incorrect because it was unable to produce such terrifying might even if it was cultivated to the highest level.

Right when Yang Ye was puzzled, Murong Yao suddenly said, “It’s the true Energy Split Sword Technique. The Energy Split Sword Technique we’ve cultivated is an incomplete copy, and he has cultivated the true low-grade Earth Rank Energy Split Sword Technique. He’s a member of our Sword Sect!”

Yang Ye frowned when he heard this, and then he stopped talking and continued watching the battle.

Qin Youran didn’t dare be careless when he saw the dense expanse of sword qi approaching, and he took another step forward before he suddenly shook his spear. Countless spear images instantly appeared on the arena, and then....

Bang!

Innumerable world shocking and deafening explosions resounded on the arena! Subsequently, the ground on the area started to crack apart, and in less than two breaths of time, a bang resounded while Arena No.1 rumbled and collapsed amidst the astounded gazes of everyone in the surroundings. For a time, dust and dirt suffused the air.

After the dust and dirt dispersed, Lin Xiuran and Qin Youran who were in the ruins of the arena were revealed before the eyes of everyone. At this moment, both of them weren’t standing but lying on the ground instead. The might of Earth Rank techniques was extremely terrifying, and the might of two was even more terrifying. So, both of them were unable to escape the aftershock created by the collision of the two Earth Rank techniques.

“Who won?”

“Both of them have fainted, so it’s probably a tie, right? Otherwise, it would be unfair no matter which one of them is named the winner!”

“Tsk, tsk. I truly never imagined that this independent cultivator, Lin Xiuran, would actually be able to fight Qin Youran to a draw. What an extraordinary dark horse!”

As the crowd discussed animatedly, the judge was slightly troubled because both of them were lying on the ground right now. So, exactly who won?

Right when the judge was troubled, Lin Xiuran and Qin Youran had suddenly moved at the same time.

After a short while, both of them stood up slowly under the astounded gazes of everyone. After they stood up, their gazes locked onto each other at the first possible moment, and then the profound energy within their bodies instantly started surging.

Right when they were about to continue fighting, Li Si suddenly appeared here. He glanced at them before he said, “This battle is considered to be a draw!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Li Si’s figure flashed and vanished on the spot.

Both of them revealed unwilling expressions when they heard this, but they didn’t dare to go against Li Si’s decision. So, they immediately glanced coldly at each other before walking towards opposite directions.

After taking a few steps, Lin Xiuran suddenly stopped moving, and then he turned to look at Yang Ye who stood below Arena No.9. A wisp of a cold smile suffused the corners of Lin Xiuran’s mouth when he saw Yang Ye, and there was even a wisp of ghastly killing intent that flashed in the depths of his eyes. His gaze stayed on Yang Ye for a moment before he turned around and left, and it wasn’t long before he vanished from everyone’s fields of vision.

Yang Ye frowned in the crowd because he’d been constantly observing Lin Xiuran. So, he was looking at Lin Xiuran when Lin Xiuran looked at him. Even though Lin Xiuran had concealed it very well, Yang Ye had still captured the killing intent in the depths of Lin Xiuran’s eyes. This puzzled Yang Ye because he’d never met Lin Xiuran in the past!

However, Lin Xiuran was clearly targeting him, and this caused Yang Ye to be extremely puzzled.

Yang Ye shook his head and stopped thinking about this. Since Lin Xiuran wanted to kill him, then Lin Xiuran was an enemy. Since it was an enemy, then he would naturally not show mercy during the competition. It was just that simple.

Although Lin Xiuran’s strength was extremely formidable, and it was especially so for that sword technique that had heavily injured Qin Youran at the start of the battle. But did Yang Ye have to fear Lin Xiuran? In all honesty, Yang Ye had never feared anyone in the same realm of cultivation, and it was the same even when it was Yuan Tong!

Because Arena No.1 had been destroyed, the Empire had no choice but to establish a new arena. This time, the crowd witnessed how terrifying the Empire was because the enormous arena that stretched almost 300m in all directions had actually appeared on the square in less than two hours of time!

Thus, a new round of battles began.
