Chapter 1681 - Lend Me Your Heads!

Translator: InVader

He didn’t have one!

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he looked up at the sky. The starry sky was deathly silent.

Had the Yang Clan forgotten to give him a talisman?

How could that be possible?!

He gazed at the starry sky for a long time, and then he suddenly chuckled. Now, he truly believed Yang Xuan. There really were many in the Yang Clan who wanted him dead.

The reason Yang Ru wanted to kill him had definitely been because of orders from someone in the Yang Clan. Otherwise, there was no enmity between them, so Yang Ru wouldn’t be stupid enough to offend him for no reason.

The Yang Clan!

“It feels slightly off!” Meanwhile, Lu Lige appeared by Yang Ye’s side. He glanced at the surroundings, “It’s too quiet.”

Yang Ye sized up Lu Lige, “You’ve recovered?”

Lu Lige nodded slightly, “Completely.”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Leave.”

Lu Lige spoke with displeasure, “What are you trying to say? You’re afraid I’ll be a burden?”

Yang Ye nodded, “A little.”

Lu Lige’s face instantly darkened. He fell silent for a long time and shook his head, “I know what you’re trying to say. You don’t want to drag me down with you, but do you think I would leave? Even though you’re stronger than me, I’m at the Rebirth Realm too. Moreover, I can surmount my realm of cultivation in battle as well!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Have you not noticed that the situation isn’t normal?”

Lu Lige glanced at the surroundings and replied, “It doesn’t make a difference to me.”

Yang Ye turned to look at Lu Lige, and he gazed at Lu Lige for a long time before he said, “Alright, I won’t persuade you further. Don’t worry, I’ll definitely bury you if you die!”

Lu Lige shrugged, “Don’t worry, I too will bury you if you die!”

They looked at each other and smiled. Everything was said with just a glance and a smile.

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “Both of you will die!”

Yang Ye turned to look towards the source of the voice. He saw a group of people walking slowly towards them, and the group was led by the eldest young master of the Yang Clan, Yang Jian.

It didn’t take long for Yang Jian’s group to stop.

Yang Jian sized up Yang Ye and said, “In my personal opinion, I really admire you. You’re truly man enough.” He shook his head at this point, “But you shouldn’t have come!”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “I didn’t want to, but it was all of you who forced me to!”

Yang Jian fell silent for a long time and said, “Where there are people, there is strife. Some want you to return in order to incite dissension. The only way to resolve that is to kill you.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t want to die.”

Yang Jian nodded, “No one does.”

Yang Ye fell silent for some time and replied, “Are there benefits for killing me?”

Yang Jian fell silent.

Yang Ye asked, “You can’t say? In any case, I may be dying for sure, right?”

Yang Jian replied, “The one who kills you will instantly advance to the next round and become a candidate to be the successor. Besides that, that person will be awarded with a True Rank treasure.”

A True Rank treasure!“Tsk, tsk. Your Yang Clan is really generous!” Meanwhile, Lu Lige suddenly said, “A True Rank treasure. Treasures at that rank are like a legend in the medium universe of our Milky Way System.”

Yang Ye fell silent. He hadn’t expected that someone in the Yang Clan would actually not hesitate to give out a True Rank treasure in order to kill him. He didn’t know how strong such a treasure was, but it was obvious that it was extremely terrifying.

After all, even Zenith Rank treasures were extraordinary!

A True Rank treasure and the position of candidate to be the successor… How could any of the Yang Clan’s young masters resist such temptation?

Not to mention them, even Yang Ye himself was quite tempted.

Meanwhile, Yang Jian said, “Of course, there’s another reason, and it’s the main reason.”

Yang Ye asked, “What?”

Yang Jian looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “The clan will never let you be the successor.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Yang Jian replied, “Fear. Many are afraid. If you become the successor, they won’t be able to eat or sleep in peace. So, even if others are trying to protect you in secret, you’ll still die this time. Because those who wish to protect you have come to an agreement with those who wish for your death.”

Yang Ye asked, “What agreement?”

“True Realm experts are prohibited from interfering!” Yang Jian continued, “If you’re able to survive when no True Realm experts act against you, then it’s your ability that kept you alive; if you die, then no one can be blamed but you.”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and gazed at Yang Jian, “So, I won’t be able to leave Phecda City no matter what, right?”

Yang Jian looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Yes!”

Yang Ye suddenly chuckled. As he laughed, a ferocious expression gradually appeared on his face, and then he looked up at the sky, “All of you forced me to return. Fine, I came back. Yet now, you want me to die. You think I’m someone you can do as you please with?” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

As soon as he finished speaking, he pointed his sword at Yang Jian’s group, “Didn’t you want to kill me? Come! Are you going to fight me one on one, or gang up on me?”

Suddenly, the man in an ink black robe by Yang Jian’s side stepped forward, but Yang Jian stopped him and shook his head, “Brother Gu Xie, we don’t have to fight him one on one.”

The man called Gu Xie grinned, “I know what you mean. However, let me fight him, alright? I’m sure you’re aware that I’ve never been fond of ganging up on others. So, how about all of you join in if I lose?”

Yang Jian fell silent for an instant before he nodded, “Be careful!”

“Of course!” Gu Xie nodded, and then he walked over to Yang Ye, “There’s no enmity between us, but Yang Jian is my brother, so I have to help him.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he flipped his palm, and a golden rod appeared in his grasp.

Yang Ye nodded, “Then let’s fight.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he tapped his right foot against the ground and transformed into a ray of light. The ray of light tore through the night sky like a bolt of lightning, and the sharp and fierce aura it carried caused Yang Jian and the others to reveal solemn expressions.

Two Zenith Rank intents enhanced by the Unyielding Will. It could be said that even a casual strand of sword energy he released was extremely terrifying.

Gu Xiu had a solemn expression in his eyes as well. He remained silent for a moment, and then he suddenly stabbed his rod forward.

Clang!

An ear piercing sound of metal colliding resounded. In an instant, the space in an area of 3km cracked apart. At the same time, Yang Ye and Gu Xie were pushed back by the powerful force of the collision. However, Yang Ye had stopped himself after moving less than 30m back.

After that, he vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Gu Xie when he appeared once more. At this moment, there was an ancient sheath in his left grasp, and he sheathed his sword before immediately drawing it.

Bang!

The space in the surroundings trembled violently and seemed like it was almost unable to endure the might of this attack.

17 overlapped Heavenrends!

Heavenrends that were enhanced by Unyielding Sword Intent and Unyielding Slaughter Intent!

The young man’s expression changed when he sensed the energy contained within Yang Ye’s attack. His profound energy surged madly while he raised his iron rod to block Yang Ye’s attack.

Bang!

As soon as they collided with each other, the iron rod exploded into bits, and Gu Xie’s figure was blasted over 6km away. However, he was completely unharmed because there was a gold round shield in front of him. The shield had absorbed most of the force from Yang Ye’s attack, so Gu Xie was completely fine.

However, as soon as he stopped himself, Yang Ye appeared before him again, and then Yang Ye drew his sword and swung it once more.

Gu Xie’s pupils constricted slightly, and he pressed a palm against the shield. In an instant, a ray of dazzling golden light erupted from the shield, and it instantly slammed against Yang Ye’s attack.

Boom!

Crack!

A rumbling explosion resounded, and then the space here instantly cracked open. Moreover, the cracks were spreading, and space seemed like it would collapse at any moment. However, the space here was suddenly repaired.

Yang Ye didn’t attack again. He looked up into the sky, and then a cold smile curled up on his face.

Someone was helping Gu Xie. Or it should be said, someone was helping Yang Jian!

He’d intentionally damaged the space here just now. So long as it collapsed, then he would be able to instantly kill Gu Xie. Moreover, he could even rely on the black hole to slaughter the group of Zenith Realm experts behind Yang Jian!

However, someone had instantly repaired the space here when it showed signs of collapsing!

Gu Xie wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “Zenith Rank slaughter intent, Zenith Rank sword intent, and a mysterious energy. Good! You’re really strong and worthy of me fighting you seriously!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took a step forward. In an instant, a terrifying wave of aura swept out from him, and then numerous shadows flashed out incessantly from him. The shadows were extremely swift and instantly surrounded Yang Ye.

Lu Lige hurriedly warned Yang Ye, “Be careful! That’s a Half-Step True Rank technique at least!”

Suddenly, a ray of light tore through the air. In an instant, countless rays of sword energy surged out explosively, and then the shadows were torn apart. At the same time, a sword howl resounded.

A vicious glow flashed through Gu Xie’s eyes. He took the golden shield in his right hand, tapped his right foot lightly against the ground, and transformed into a ray of golden light that shot towards the sword energy and images.

Rumble!

It didn’t take long for numerous sword howls and explosions to resound.

Around 30 breaths of time later, the battlefield fell quiet abruptly.

The images and sword energy gradually dispersed.

Everyone here was staring at the battlefield without blinking. It didn’t take long for a man to appear before their fields of vision.

It was Yang Ye!

Yang Ye was holding a bloody head in his grasp, and it belonged to Gu Xie!

Yang Jian slowly closed his eyes when he witnessed this scene.

Yang Ye casually tossed the head over to Lu Lige and said, “I want to put together a few words. Collect the heads of all those fellows that I’ve killed. I’m going to put a few words together for the Yang Clan!”

Lu Lige glanced at Yang Ye, and then he nodded. It didn’t take long for him to gather all the heads of the experts which Yang Ye had killed just now.

Yang Ye glanced at those heads and shook his head, “They aren’t enough.”

He looked up at Yang Jian’s group and said, “Lend me your heads!”
