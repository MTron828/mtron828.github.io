Chapter 2463 – Dragon Stew!

The moment he saw Erya enter the city, the old man in battle with Yang Ye was absolutely shocked!

He hadn’t expected her strength to actually be this terrifying!

She’d punched a Four World Realm expert death with just one punch!

Was she a greater monster than Yang Ye?

However, he didn’t have the time to pay any attention to Erya because Yang Ye’s barrage of attacks had almost shattered his body!

The old man wanted to flee on many occasions, but Yang Ye just refused to let him escape!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Yang Ye’s swords sliced into his bone and made him bleed with every swing. Finally, his body was gone!

A soul!

At the instant his body collapsed, he decisively abandoned his body and vanished on the spot.

He'd fled!

He fled into the city!

Outside the city, Yang Ye withdrew a World Crystal and swallowed it, and then he started walking toward the city’s entrance.

…

Once Erya entered the city, she glanced at the surroundings, and it didn’t take long for Snowy to appear on her shoulder.

Erya asked, “Snowy, where are the treasures?”

Treasures!Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Snowy glanced at the surroundings, and it didn’t take long for her to point in a certain direction.

Erya nodded and ran swiftly in that direction. Perhaps she was doing it on purpose, but as she ran, the entire city was actually trembling violently, and the ground collapsed beneath her feet!

The entire city was experiencing an earthquake!

Erya ran faster and faster, and only ruins laid in her wake!

Suddenly, countless pillars of light shot at her from all directions. They were dense like a storm and enveloped the space all around her. She didn’t stop at all, but Snowy hurriedly hid herself.

It didn’t take long for those pillars of light to descend.

All of them struck Erya. However, Erya was still running! Any pillar of light that struck her would explode apart like fireworks. But not only were they incapable of slowing her down, she was still growing faster.

Finally, all the pillars of light had vanished, but it didn’t take long for a powerful aura to shoot up into the air from afar. After that, a colossus appeared in the sky.

A dragon!

It was a huge pitch black dragon that blotted out the sky. Waves of aura were ceaselessly seeping out of it, and the aura caused the space in the surroundings to ripple.

There was a middle aged man on its head!

He was the patriarch of the Di Clan, Di Lian!

A true Five World Realm expert!

Di Lian glanced at Erya and frowned slightly, “Who are you?”

Even he couldn’t see through Erya!

Erya was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly appeared by her side. She blinked, and then she soundlessly moved slightly away from him. She couldn’t afford to offend Yang Ye right now!

Di Lian’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye, “The young are really amazing. Yang Ye, you…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye shot up into the air, and a ray of sword energy slashed at Di Lian!

Di Lian frowned when he saw Yang Ye just attack.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword had arrived!

Di Lian tapped his right foot against the dragon’s head, and then he slammed a punch at Yang Ye. At the instant his fist shot forward, a wave of violet energy rippled out from the top of his fist.

It blasted apart Yang Ye’s sword energy, and then Yang Ye was blasted back to where he’d been a moment ago!

However, Yang Ye immediately charged up into the air again.

Di Lian frowned while the desire to kill surged in his eyes.

As far as he was concerned, Yang Ye was really going too far!

Di Lian suddenly vanished from the dragon’s head and charged at Yang Ye!

A powerful aura swept out from him like the tide, and it caused the entire city to tremble!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was growing increasingly insane! However, as soon as they collided, Yang Ye was at a disadvantage!

When she saw Yang Ye and Di Lian getting locked in battle, Erya’s gaze descended upon the black dragon. At this moment, the dragon was looking at her too!

They were in the same realm of cultivation. Both of them were at the peak of the Four World Realm!

Erya licked her lips, and then she shot into the air and slammed herself against the dragon!

The dragon slapped its claw at Erya!

It seemed like it could slap the ground apart!

Erya revealed no fear and just slammed against it.

Bang!

The dragon’s body shook violently, and then it was blasted over 300m away!

At the same time, its claws cracked open and blood sprayed!

Erya didn’t stop. Her figure shot up into the air, and then she slammed her little head against the dragon’s body!

Boom!

She actually blasted through its body!

The powerful force of the collision even blasted the dragon over 10km away! And there was a huge and bloody hole in its stomach!

Just these two attacks of hers had heavily injured the black dragon!

The experts of the Di Clan in the surroundings were stunned by this!

The black dragon was the guardian beast of the Di Clan, and it was from the Primal Era too. Even though it was a little more inferior than the Primal True Dragon, it was still an overlord in the world of demon beasts!

Yet now, such an overlord was being beaten up by that young girl!

It was being beaten up!

Erya didn’t stop. She charged at the black dragon again. This time, there was fear in the dragon’s eyes!

It was slightly fearful as soon as they entered into battle!

It was innate fear!

While it was slightly fearful, it didn’t flee, nor could it. Moreover, as a part of the Dragon Clan, it had its own dignity!

Actually, if it knew about the Primal True Dragon, it would just disregard its dignity!

Dignity was something they had to disregard before existences like Snowy and Erya because their lives were more important!

A vicious glow arose in the black dragon’s eyes. Suddenly, its body spun, and its huge tail swept at Erya. Powerful force swept apart the space throughout the sky!

It was obvious how terrifying the energy it contained was!

Erya suddenly stopped, gazed at the tail, and then she leaped up and slammed herself at it!

A head-on collision!

Erya didn’t choose to avoid the dragon’s attack and had chosen a head-on collision instead!

Both of them slammed against each other!

Boom!

Erya blasted through the dragon’s tail. At the same time, the dragon was blasted away and howled with pain!

A huge bloody hole had appeared in the dragon’s tail! It was the size of Erya’s body!

This time, Erya didn’t stop attacking. She immediately flashed over to the dragon’s back, and then she slammed a punch at it.

The dragon was horrified, and a wave of powerful Dragon Pressure rippled out of it. However, Erya just ignored the pressure. After all, as far as she was concerned, Dragon Pressure was utterly useless!

Not to mention the black dragon, even the Dragon Pressure from the Primal True Dragon, a pure-blooded dragon, was a joke to Erya. Such Dragon Pressure couldn’t even compare to a single glance from An Nanjing!

Just like Snowy, Erya felt both respect and a trace of fear for An Nanjing!

Erya’s fist slammed against the dragon in the end.

Bang!

The dragon was blasted down from the sky and crashed into the city.

Boom!

The entire city shook violently, and then a cloud of dust surged up into the air!

Meanwhile, Erya dived down and stomped her foot on the dragon’s head.

Bang!

The dragon’s head was stomped into bits!

Just like an exploding ball…

After that, Erya suddenly started eating! This time, she ate it raw and didn’t just devour its energy and soul!

Erya wasn’t very fond of human flesh, and human flesh was too little. It felt like she wasn’t even eating anything. However, the flesh of demon beasts was different. Not only was it tasty, it contained energy! The essence of a demon beast was within its flesh, and the essence of a person was within their spirit and energy!

Just like that, countless experts of the Di Clan watched as Erya ate the dragon!

Meanwhile, Snowy appeared nearby. Erya took a few more bites and gazed at Snowy, “Want some?”

Snowy blinked…

Erya thought for a moment, and then clawed at the dragon’s stomach. A fist-sized white pearl appeared in her claw.

The Dragon Ball!

It was the best part of the black dragon!

Erya flicked it over to Snowy, “Take that. It’s very tasty!”

Snowy glanced at the Dragon Ball which was still covered in blood and shook her head. It was too bloody, and she preferred eating clean things!

Erya glanced at Snowy, “It’s a treasure, and it’s really tasty.”

Snowy wiped the Dragon Ball, and then a strand of spirit energy cleaned it completely. Snowy put the Dragon Ball away and pointed at Yang Ye.

Erya glanced at Yang Ye. At this moment, Yang Ye was still fighting the Di Clan’s patriarch, Di Lian.

Yang Ye was at a disadvantage!

Erya withdrew her gaze, “Don’t worry about Big Brother Yang. He grows stronger as he fights, so he’ll definitely defeat that guy!”

Actually, she didn’t dare to interfere.

Yang Ye would attack anyone in sight while he was in this state. Especially now that Yang Ye had become much stronger and could pierce her defenses.

She cherished her life, so she was staying away from him!

That was what Erya thought!

Suddenly, Erya stood up and grabbed the black dragon’s tail, “It’s tasteless. Let’s take it back to the pagoda and enjoy it slowly!”

Just like that, she dragged it into the Primordial Pagoda.

On the Ascension Platform.

All the demons had surrounded the platform.

Eat!

All of them were drooling at the sight of the huge black dragon.

They’d been with Yang Ye for so long that they’d almost forgotten they were demon beasts.

Erya walked around the dragon and said, “Let’s cook it and enjoy it together. Oxxy, you start the fire. Dragon, you cut it up, cut it into smaller pieces. Tiger, you go ask Big Sister Qingshi and the others for things like salt. Qilin, you go get a pot…”

The Martial Qilin was stunned speechless.

A pot?

Where would it get such a huge pot?!
