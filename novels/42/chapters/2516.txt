Chapter 2517 – Sell My Body?

Just as Yao Ye had said, Yang Ye hadn’t fully killed Yao Qing and had left the latter alive!

It was because he’d made a deal with Yao Ye!

Actually, Yang Ye had been caught quite off guard when Yao Ye suddenly entered, but he couldn’t be bothered about that at the time.

If he was exposed, then so be it!

Right when he was about to go all out and slaughter to his heart’s content, Yao Ye had suddenly made a proposal.

It was that he had to let Yao Qing live, and in return, Yao Ye would act like he didn’t see anything!

After giving it some consideration, Yang Ye agreed in the end.

After all, he was here in Eternal Kingdom mainly to help Sword Scroll recover her main body!

Now that he’d been able to leave safely, it was obvious that Yao Ye had kept his word!

Yang Ye’s group returned to the mountain range from before. Meanwhile, the remaining humans throughout War Dimension were here. There were five top experts among them, Xing Biqing, Ye Zhibei, Leng Ao, Lu Jue, and Gu Nie!

All of them were the strongest experts of the younger generation!

At this moment, all of them were gathered together.

The experts of the entire human race accepted them as their leader!

As for Yang Ye, he didn’t want to bother about all of this. After he made arrangements for Mo Ya and the others, he wanted to leave immediately. However, Ye Zhibei and Xing Biqing made him stay. According to them, he needed a golden talisman to leave the War Dimension, and they didn’t have any right now.

Actually, they probably did have some. However, they didn’t want Yang Ye to leave right now!

It wasn’t that they sought to use him, but they felt that the human cultivators really needed his help!

After giving it some thought, Yang Ye decided to stay.

In any case, he really couldn’t leave right now. However, if they asked him to help with the attack on the city, he would absolutely not do it.

He wasn’t here to get swept into all of this nonsense.

Yang Ye remained alone at the side while Xing Biqing’s group was in discussion.

A long time passed before they dispersed, and then Xing Biqing and Ye Zhibei went over to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at them, and Xing Biqing said, “Brother Ye, do you really intend to leave?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She hesitated for a moment and said, “I can get a teleportation talisman for you, but will you return?”

Would he return?

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “I’m not sure.”

He seemed to have thought of something and added, “Miss Biqing, is there any place here that sells divine treasures suitable for demon beasts to improve their cultivations?”

For demon beasts!

All the demon beasts in the Primordial Pagoda were at the peak of the Four World Realm. If they could consume a Chaotic Fruit or Worldborn Fruit now, it wouldn’t be difficult for them to attain the Five World Realm. But the problem was that after Snowy left, those trees started growing fruits exceptionally slowly. The worst part was that besides Snowy, those trees wouldn’t allow anyone to get close to them, and they would attack anyone who got close!

They only recognized Snowy!

So, they had to wait until Snowy returned to consume those fruits and advance!

But Snowy and Erya had only just left! No one knew how they were doing over there!

Xing Biqing and Ye Zhibei exchanged glances when they heard Yang Ye, and then Xing Biqing grinned, “Brother Ye, you want to help that Primal True Dragon attain the Five World Realm?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She spoke solemnly, “There is a way, Origin World Pills!”

“Origin World Pills?” Yang Ye asked, “What’s that?”

She explained, “A medicinal pill Eternal Kingdom made specially for demon beasts, and it helps them advance in the Limitbreaker Realm. However, they are extremely precious. Even in the demon race, only monstrous geniuses or those with extraordinary status are able to obtain one. It’s very difficult for humans to obtain any.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Then haven’t you said all of that for nothing?”

She smiled, “While it’s difficult, it’s not impossible.”

Yang Ye glanced at her, “How?”

She smiled, “Buy them! 300 World Crystals should be enough to get one.”

300!

Yang Ye took a look inside the Primordial Pagoda, and there were around 400 in there! Some of them had been the World Crystals Snowy left behind, and then the rest were either from killing people or the World Crystals he obtained from going to the abyss with Xing Biqing!

400 were just enough to purchase one pill!

It was absolutely expensive!

It was the first time he felt quite poor!

While it was expensive, Yang Ye still decided to buy one. So, he gazed at Xing Biqing, “Where can I get one?”

She replied, “An underground trade!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “In the city?”

Xing Biqing smiled, “Don’t worry, the demon race wouldn’t dare to destroy that place. It isn’t my Xing Clan that protects that place, it’s another mysterious human cultivator. That person is in War Dimension too, but that person is a relatively special existence. Moreover, even the demon race participates in the trades there. No one cares who you are there once you’ve worn a black robe!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Then let’s go!”

Xing Biqing said, “We’ll go with you!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and nodded, “Thanks!”

Just like that, they entered the city again. Of course, they snuck in.

They arrived at the underground trade area, that street. People still had stalls there. Of course, Yang Ye didn’t know if they were actually humans or demon beasts.

This time, they were wearing black robes because it was part of the rules here.

Yang Ye and the others looked around but didn’t notice any Origin World Pills. Meanwhile, Xing Biqing walked over to the end of the street, and a hunched black robed figure stood there.

She flicked three World Crystals to the hunched figure.

The hunched figure took them and said, “Go on!”

She said, “Origin World Pills!”

The black robed figure fell silent for a long time and said, “350 World Crystals each! It’s fixed!”

350!

Xing Biqing frowned slightly and gazed at Yang Ye. The latter thought for a moment and asked, “How many do you have?”

The hunched figure replied with a question, “How much do you have?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and gazed at Xing Biqing, “Miss Biqing and Miss Zhibei, I have something that you may be interested in!”

They exchanged glances. In the end, Xing Biqing asked, “What is it?”

Yang Ye and the others went off to a corner, and then Yang Ye revealed a blood red brush. The brush was the Divine Treasure he’d obtained after killing that expert from the Leng Clan!

Both of them were visibly moved when they saw it!

Divine Treasures were very, very precious.

They exchanged glances. In the end, Xing Biqing said, “500 World Crystals.”Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

While Divine Treasures were precious, they were only worth around 400 plus World Crystals. After all, that amount of World Crystals was sufficient to foster many Limitbreaker Realm experts or even foster 3 Five World Realm experts!

Of course, Divine Treasures were priceless treasures on their own. So, 400 World Crystals may not be able to purchase one. As for the price that Xing Biqing offered, Yang Ye was actually gaining a little from it!

Yang Ye didn’t say anything and just gave it to her. She took it and flicked a golden card to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye asked, “What is this?”

She replied, “A World Card, a card we use to store World Crystals. Don’t worry, so long as you’re within Eternal Kingdom, you can use this to purchase things and withdraw actual World Crystals. Because these cards were made by all the powers in Eternal Kingdom, and every power acknowledges it. So, you can use it to withdraw World Crystals or buy things from any power!”

Yang Ye nodded, “That’s quite convenient!”

500 World Crystals combined with the 400 he had was 900!

900 was barely enough to purchase 3 Origin World Pills!

Yang Ye grumbled, “Why are these pills so expensive?”

She smiled, “They are expensive because they can help demons advance into the Five World Realm. After all, that advancement is a huge gap that many demons are never able to traverse. But it gives them a very good chance to attain the Five World Realm. That is why it’s so precious!”

Three Origin World Pills!

Yang Ye glanced at the World Crystals in the Primordial Pagoda, and he realized they weren’t really enough!

He had to treat all of them equally and help them attain the Five World Realm. If only a few get it, the others would definitely be unhappy!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and scanned the Primordial Pagoda. He had many more Divine Treasures like the Seal of Suppression, the Myriad World Diagram, the Universe Seal, the Sword Supreme, the Sword Precursor, the True Energy Mirror, Executor, the Primordial Pagoda…

Of course, he would never sell them. He needed them, and they weren’t like that brush. Snowy had been improving them, and they surpassed ordinary Divine Treasures! It would be such a waste to sell them as ordinary Divine Treasures!

Moreover, they had a certain level of closeness with him and Snowy. If he sold them, Snowy would definitely be sad, and he couldn’t bear to part with them either!

Sell the fruits?

That was an absolute no. Those fruits were much more precious than the Origin World Pills!

While those fruits couldn’t be consumed right now, they would be priceless once they matured. After all, those fruits could improve the bloodline of demon beasts, and the Origin World Pills could only improve the cultivation!

After thinking for a long time, Yang Ye realized that he really didn’t have anything to sell!

Should I sell my body?

Yang Ye was stunned by this idea of his, and then he gazed at Xing Biqing and Ye Zhibei!
