Chapter 2204 – Who Does He Think He Is?

The Buddhist Path was gone!

While the Buddhist Progenitor was still alive and had taken some core disciples of the Buddhist Path with him, the Buddhist Dimension had been destroyed and its followers had been annihilated.

The news of the incident there spread throughout the large universe.

At this moment, all the living beings throughout the large universe knew of a race.

The undying race!

After the undying race destroyed the Buddhist Path, it didn’t stop and went to the Weapon Path.

However, the Weapon Dimension was empty.

After the Buddhist Dimension was attacked, the Weapon Progenitor had left the Weapon Dimension with the core disciples of the Weapon Path and gone to the Dao Dimension.

However, there were still some ordinary people left in the Weapon Dimension.

All of them were killed!

The Weapon Dimension and Buddhist Dimension had vanished from the world, just like that!

At this moment, the entire large universe started to fall into terror.

…

The prehistoric ruins.

The masked woman, or to be more precise, Dugu Juetian, walked to a square, and five Sprites were in front of her.

The Fire Sprite, Water Sprite, Wood Sprite, Metal Sprite, and Earth Sprite.

Dugu Juetian waved her hands. In an instant, they started to revolve rapidly.

As they revolved, a huge amount of spirit energy suddenly surged out of the endless black holes. The spirit energy converged into a torrent that surged toward the prehistoric ruins. In just a short while, the prehistoric ruins was filled with spirit energy.

Moreover, it was unprecedentedly abundant here.

Suddenly, a mysterious black robed figure appeared not too far away from Dugu Juetian.

There was a small ‘天’ character embroidered on the black robed figure’s chest. It was the same mysterious person who Snowy had felt really close to.

The mysterious black robed figure walked slowly to Dugu Juetian, “I see, so the End Times doesn’t really exist. The spirit energy in the large universe was forcefully extracted by your undying race!”

Dugu Juetian sized up the figure before her and said, “Interesting, so it’s the Universe Sprite.”

The black robed figure said, “Answer me!”

Dugu Juetian grinned, “You’re wrong, the End Time does exist. However, the large universe’s End Times will only arrive in one more era from now. The spirit energy and living beings here will be sufficient to help my race survive until that era arrives. Of course, for the sake of reviving my people, we had no choice but to extract some of the spirit energy in the large universe. But don’t worry, we have no intention to destroy this universe for now.

Meanwhile, the black robed figure suddenly vanished on the spot.

In an instant, the world turned pitch black.

At the same instant, a spear shot up into the air from Dugu Juetian’s back, and it seemed to have torn through something, causing a sharp tearing sound to resound.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then the surroundings returned to normal.

At this moment, the black robed figure was over 10km away.

A spear was stabbed into the ground at an angle by Dugu Juetian’s side.

She glanced indifferently at the black robed figure, “Not bad. You’re slightly stronger than some of the Universe Sprites I’ve met in the past. However, you’re just slightly stronger.”

Once she finished speaking, she waved her right hand. In an instant, the spear by her side rose up from the ground and transformed into a ray of dark light that shot forward. Suddenly, the Universe Sprite vanished into thin air.

Dugu Juetian looked up at the sky, and the undying cavalries behind her were about to pursue the Universe Sprite, but she shook her head, “That isn’t necessary!”

She turned around and left once she finished speaking.

She took a few steps before she stopped again, “I know what all of you are thinking. Go on. However, you’re prohibited from killing Sprites and the Sprite Lord.”

“Thank you, Lord Exalt!” The undying cavalries behind her were overjoyed and vanished into the sky.

The undying race’s source of strength wasn’t just spirit energy, it was death energy too!

They could absorb death energy. The more they absorbed, the stronger they grew. How was death energy formed? From death, of course!

So, as far as the undying race was concerned, the living beings of the large universe were their prey!

…

Void Spirit Continent.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye’s aura was growing more and more unstable, or to be more precise, it was quite violent. There was a golden pagoda that flickered on his forehead.

Yang Lianshuang gazed at Tian Xiu who was standing not too far away from Yang Ye, “Will he be alright?”

Yang Lianshuang was curious about Tian Xiu. Of course, she was fearful too.

The young girl felt really special to her.

Tian Xiu replied, “I don’t know!”

Yang Lianshuang glanced at Tian Xiu, “Can you help him?”

Tian Xiu replied softly, “It’s best if he does this himself.”

Yang Lianshuang was puzzled, “Why?”

Tian Xiu replied softly, “If he can conquer that pagoda on his own, it’ll be very helpful to him when he uses it in the future. If he relied on someone else’s help, then there would be flaws in his control of it.”

Yang Lianshuang nodded slightly, “I see!”

Just like that, time trickled by, and Yang Ye’s aura grew more and more violent.

It was so violent that Yang Lianshuang and the others started to feel even more uneasy.

It was like he was succumbing to inner demons!

However, Tian Xiu wasn’t very worried. There was no problem with Yang Ye’s mental state, so even if he became a demon, it would be because he was staying true to his heart. Yang Ye’s heart was quite insane itself, and he had the Enlightened Sword Heart too.

Three days later.

The golden pagoda on Yang Ye’s forehead suddenly froze on the spot and didn’t vanish anymore.

Bang!

A terrifying aura swept out from within him, and it was so strong it could destroy everything before it.

Suddenly, Tian Xiu waved her hand while roasting a lamb leg.

Just that made Yang Ye’s aura vanish without a trace like it had never been there!

Yang Ye stood up, took a deep breath, and walked over to Tian Xiu. She passed the lamb leg to him, “Eat this, Big Brother!”

Yang Ye took it and swiftly cleaned it down to the bone.

Tian Xiu asked, “How do you feel?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he issued a command in his heart. In an instant, a small golden pagoda appeared above him.

The pagoda just floated above him. But in just a short while, Yang Ye’s face turned pale, forcing him to put it away!

“It’s not bad at all!” Meanwhile, Tian Xiu suddenly said, “It can be ranked in the top five throughout this large universe’s history. Based on your current strength, it’s quite difficult for you to fully control it. However, it can be considered as a life-saving talisman for yourself, so keep it for a critical moment!”

Yang Ye nodded. The Primordial Pagoda had merged into one with him, truly and fully. He could control it now. However, the consumption was shocking! So, he wouldn’t use it unless he had no other choice!

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu stood up abruptly, patted her hands together, and said, “Big Brother, I have to go!”

“Go?” Yang Ye gazed at her, “Tian Xiu, what’s going on?”

He felt that something was really off.

She replied softly, “I’m going somewhere to reclaim something that used to be mine.”

Yang Ye said, “I’ll go with you!”

She shook her head, “Big Brother, you can’t leave this place for now.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

She replied, “Big Brother, this place was once my home, and the souls of countless of my loved ones still remain here. I can’t awaken them yet, so help me take care of this place and their souls, alright?”

Home!

Void Spirit Continent!

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time and said, “A’Xiu, you’re getting more and more mysterious.”

Tian Xiu grinned, “I’m still the same A’Xiu!”

Yang Ye stood up, walked over to her, and rubbed her head gently, “Alright, I’ll wait for you to return!”

She nodded, “Take care!”

She left the Primordial Pagoda once she finished speaking.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye escorted her out of the city, and then she glanced at the continent and said, “Wait a while longer for me!”

She vanished into the sky once she finished speaking.

She was so fast that Yang Ye couldn’t see her movements clearly.

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang walked over to Yang Ye’s side, “She’s really strong!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Indeed!”

Tian Xiu felt unfathomable to him, truly unfathomable. Even a progenitor didn’t give him such a feeling.

She was too mysterious!

Yang Ye shook his head and was about to leave, but Yang Lianshuang suddenly said, “The Buddhist Path and Weapon Path have been destroyed. Their progenitors led their core disciples to the Dao Path. It was the undying race’s doing!”

The undying race!

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Even the Buddhist Path and Weapon Path couldn’t stop them?”

Yang Lianshuang shook her head, “They couldn’t!”

Yang Ye frowned.

Yang Lianshuang added, “Besides that, some other mysterious experts have started to slaughter throughout the large universe. They only kill but do not take anything. They are from the undying race too. Moreover, they are extremely strong to the point even Sages can’t resist them.”

She paused for a moment and asked, “What do you think about this?”

“What do I think?” Yang Ye shook his head, “I just want the Weapon path and Buddhist Path to be annihilated. I’m going to the god race, so be careful!”

Yang Ye turned around with the intent to leave.

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang suddenly asked, “What if the god race refuses to give Snowy back?”

Yang Ye stopped, “What the other races couldn’t accomplish all those years ago, I will. I guarantee that I’ll annihilate the entire god race without leaving even one behind.”

Yang Lianshuang suddenly said, “Shi Tian…”

“Who does he think he is?” Yang Ye slowly clenched his fists, “I’ll bury the entire god race if anything happens to Snowy!”

Yang Ye vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.
