Chapter 342 – Encountering An Acquaintance!

“Hmph! What’s he acting so high and mighty for? It’s like we’re begging him to let us stay by his side!” A profounder grunted coldly and spoke with displeased as he watched Yang Ye’s figure vanish within the Heaven Entrance.

One of them sighed. “But his strength really is formidable. If we stay by his side, then we definitely won’t suffer any bullying. Moreover, our status in Ancient Domain City will definitely be improved. Unfortunately....”

The others fell silent.

After he entered the city, Yang Ye instantly drew the attention of countless gazes. As for the reason, it was naturally because he’d come in through the Heaven Entrance!

“Someone has actually entered through the Heaven Entrance again. Tsk, tsk. Which territory do all of you think he’s from?”

“I think he’s probably from the central territory. After all, besides the central territory, there practically hasn’t been anyone from the other territories that has traversed the Heaven Entrance!”

“That may not necessarily be the case. Perhaps another figure like the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor has appeared in the other territories!”

“The Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor? Stop joking. It’s rare for such a figure to appear even in 10,000 years, and even the heavens would be fearful if a few more figures like that were to appear!”

Yang Ye glanced at them before he withdrew his gaze, and then he walked into the city. Presently, he only wanted to look for a quiet place because he wanted to craft talismans! Not to mention the southern territory, talismans were extremely precious throughout Profounder Continent. Even though monstrous geniuses like Mo Ke didn’t need any talismans of low grades or had any need to fear any Technique Talismans that were low ranked, were few in the entire city had attained the level of strength possessed by Mo Ke and the others!

Especially those profounders who frequently left the city to temper themselves, they definitely required these talismans!

He was naturally crafting these talismans to sell them. He didn’t have any energy stones in his possession, so it was very inconvenient for him regardless of whether he intended to cultivate sword techniques or raise his cultivation. After all, regardless of whether he intended to cultivate sword techniques or raise his cultivation, it consumed a huge amount of energy stones! Especially after the tiny vortex had become his Dantian, he had to consume a few hundred energy stones every single time....

Yang Ye had put away the badge that the old man gave him because wearing it would draw the attention of countless people. He’d worn it previously because he didn’t want to bring trouble to himself, but now it would seem like wearing it was more troublesome!

After walking for a long time in the city, Yang Ye finally found a restaurant, and a woman in a green dress had immediately welcomed him upon entering it. Yang Ye was stunned when he saw this woman, and a wisp of surprise flashed through his eyes. It wasn’t that this woman was extremely beautiful, and it was because she was very familiar instead. It felt like he’d seen here somewhere....

The branch of the Talisman Master’s Association in Rising Sun City. Xiao Yu’er.... Yang Ye recalled her in next to no time, and he realized that she was Xiao Yu’er who he’d come into contact with on multiple occasions!

Xiao Yu’er was stunned as well upon noticing Yang Ye, and then her expression became slightly unnatural!

A wisp of a complicated expression flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes when he saw her. It was only a while ago that I took her to be a friend, but I never expected that I would actually forget her completely along with the passage of time. Could it be that I’m truly too heartless?

Yang Ye shook his head and took the initiative to greet her, and he said, “Young Miss Xiao, I never expected that we would actually meet in Ancient Domain City!”

Xiao Yu’er’s expression eased up slightly when she heard Yang Ye speak to her, and her eyes carried a complicated expression as well while she gazed at him.

Needless to say, she had a good impression of Yang Ye in the past. However, the god of destiny makes a fool of all. An insignificant matter had caused the relationship between them to be destroyed Moreover, Yang Ye had soared into the sky with a single leap and obtained the 1st in the Ascension Rankings when she intended to repair the relationship between them, so he’d become an existence of higher social position that she couldn’t form a relationship with anymore.

Of course, most importantly, her clan had forbidden her from forming any relationship with Yang Ye because the fact that Yang Ye had offended the Origin School, Flower Palace, and Ghost Sect, was no secret. Under such circumstances, would anyone dare to have a relationship with Yang Ye? After all, everyone saw the Talisman Master’s Association and Sword Sect abandon Yang Ye!

Xiao Yu’er sighed and said, “I never expected that I would actually meet Brother Yang here as well. Actually, didn’t Brother Yang head to the Ninth Hell?”

“How did you know that I went there?” said Yang Ye with an astounded tone.

“The souls there can be utilized to strengthen the soul of profounders. So, with the strength Brother Yang possesses, Brother Yang would have definitely not missed such an opportunity!” said Xiao Yu’er with a smile on her face.

So that was why! Yang Ye smiled, and then he glanced at the surroundings and said, “Young Miss Xiao, what’re you doing here?”

“Working!” said Xiao Yu’er.

“Working?” Yang Ye frowned and said, “Young Miss Xiao ought to have no need to do this with your background, right?”

Xiao Yu’er laughed bitterly and said, “Brother Yang, there’s something you’re unaware of. All profounders who enter through the Mortal Entrance and Dog Entrance have to pay to reside in Ancient Domain City, and it’s 50 energy stones a day. Even I am unable to bear such a cost. Without energy stones, then there’s only a single way to live in the city, and it’s to work for free for the powers within the city! I’m in a considerably better situation, but the status possessed by the other profounders from the southern territory.... Alas!”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment and said, “Since they’re in such a bad state here, then why don’t they return to the southern territory?”

“We can’t!” Xiao Yu’er shook her head and laughed bitterly.

“Why?” Yang Ye was puzzled.

“Because we’ll be annihilated upon going too far from the city!” A wisp of a helpless expression flashed in her eyes, and she said, “The profounders from the demon territory, devil territory, and nether territory are all around the city. So, unless we form groups, otherwise, no one dares to leave the city!”

“Less than a thousand are surrounding and killing a few ten thousand humans. How sad!” Yang Ye grinned as he spoke these words. He naturally didn’t feel any pity for these human profounders. After all, if all the human profounders had united when he was outside the city that day, then it would have absolutely not been difficult to annihilate the members of these three territories. Unfortunately, all the human profounders had chosen to watch the show out of consideration for their own interests and because they felt that it didn’t affect them personally!

Now, they were suffering retribution!

Yang Ye would naturally not act as some sort of savior. To put in bluntly, did their fate have anything to do with him? Every single person was selfish, and so was he! Moreover, he didn’t have the strength to be such a savior. He only wanted to do two things right now. The first was to earn some energy stones to cultivate sword techniques, and the second was to improve his strength and seize Karmic Luck for Xiao Yuxi.

Of course, there was one more thing he wanted to do, and it was to rescue his mother! However, he didn’t have the ability to accomplish that for now, so he could only put it aside for now!

Meanwhile, Xiao Yu’er suddenly said, “Brother Yang, you probably came through the Mortal Entrance, right?”

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, and he was stunned for a moment before he said, “Why?”

“With the strength you possess, you probably entered through the Mortal Entrance!” Xiao Yu’er smiled and said, “Good. If Brother Yang doesn’t have a place to go, then you can work here with me. It’s fine, we can even study the Dao of Talismans together as well! I feel embarrassed to speak about it but I’m still a mere Grade Three Talisman Master now....” As she finished speaking, Xiao Yu’er had blushed slightly.

“Work?” Yang Ye shook his head and smiled. “I don’t have the time to work now. Right, Young Miss Xiao, do you want to return to the southern territory or stay here and wait for the Hidden Dragon Pagoda to be opened?”

Even though there had been some conflict between them in the past, Yang Ye still had a good impression of this woman who’d helped him in the past. So, he didn’t mind helping her if it was possible!

Xiao Yu’er was stunned, and then she smiled bitterly and said, “I want to stay here. After all, the Hidden Dragon Pagoda is a paradise of cultivation to all of us who are profounders. Moreover, if my luck is good, I would even get to obtain some Karmic Luck. That’s a form of huge fortune to both me and my clan!”

Yang Ye nodded and didn’t insist. He was just about to say something when a group of profounders had walked into the restaurant. Yang Ye immediately frowned upon noticing them because while he didn’t recognize the rest, he recognized the two figures in the lead of the group. They were none other than the Origin School’s Yuan Tong and the Sword Sect’s Murong Yao!

The group walked over to Yang Ye, and then Yuan Tong glanced at Xiao Yu’er before he gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Let’s have a chat?”

“I’m not interested!” Yang Ye spoke indifferently, and then he gazed at Xiao Yu’er and said, “Young Miss Xiao, give me a quiet room!”

After all, what was there for him to talk about with Yuan Tong? There was nothing!

Xiao Yu’er glanced at Yuan Tong and Murong Yao, and then she glanced at Yang Ye. She hesitated for a moment before she nodded in the end.

She was just about to turn around and leave when Murong Yao suddenly said, “Brother Yang, I hope you can give me some face and allow us to sit down to have a chat, alright?”

Yang Ye shook his head and chuckled lightly. He said, “Murong Yao, I think there’s nothing to talk about between us. I’ve really never been interested in anything related to all of you, and I believe that all of you are definitely not interested in my business. So, this so-called chat is none other than an act to use each other, right?”

Meanwhile, Yuan Tong frowned and said in a low voice, “Yang Ye, I presume you’re already clearly aware of the situation that all of us profounders from the southern territory are in while within Ancient Domain City, right? I know we have an unpleasant past, but you’re still a profounder of the southern territory. I hope that we can put aside our differences for now and allow all the profounders of the southern territory to unite. Only in that way would we be able to survive in Ancient Domain City, and only then would we be able to obtain a place for ourselves in the Hidden Dragon Pagoda!”

“I’m still not interested!” Yang Ye refused decisively. What a joke! Work with them? If a moment of life and death really did appear, then these fellows would probably be the first to run.

Yang Ye wasn’t someone that stubbornly held on to past grudges, and he naturally knew the principle of having strength in numbers. However, the reason he’d refused Yuan Tong wasn’t that he was trying to make a show of strength, and it was because he didn’t trust them instead!

Meanwhile, Yuan Tong suddenly said, “You’re not interested in this matter, but you should be interested in matters related to your mother, right?”

Yang Ye’s expression changed, and he swiftly turned around to look at Yuan Tong!
