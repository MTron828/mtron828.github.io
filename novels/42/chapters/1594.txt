Chapter 1595 - Allow Me!

Translator: InVader

Yang Ye’s face was completely dark. So she thinks I’m a murderous madman!

He glanced at her. At this moment, the brilliant smile on her face had vanished, and it was icy cold now. Moreover, there was ghastly killing intent in her eyes!

Yang Ye knew that Little Sky was really angry.

Little Sky usually didn’t get angry, but even he feared her once she was angry!

As soon as Little Sky gave the order, the Eyes of the Heaven Dao in the sky immediately released numerous bolts of divine lightning that shot down at the spear-wielding man’s group.

Even though Merak System had many Eyes of the Heaven Dao, there were only over 60 in the sky right now. After all, not every single Eye of the Heaven Dao could pose a threat to Rebirth Realm experts. The other Eyes of the Heaven Dao weren’t strong enough, so coming here would be no different than giving their lives away.

Even though there were only 60 plus bolts of divine lightning, the energy they contained caused the faces of the spear-wielding man and the others to become extremely unsightly.

The spear-wielding man stayed silent for a moment, and then he suddenly gazed at Little Sky, “All of you deal with them, I’ll go capture her!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he shot forward in Little Sky’s direction.

Meanwhile, the other black robed figures behind him shot upwards to stop the divine lightning which covered the sky above them.

Little Sky’s face remained emotionless as she watched the spear-wielding man charge at her. Right when the middle aged man was just 30m away from her, a sword howl resounded abruptly, and then a ray of sword energy flashed.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then the middle aged man stopped. Meanwhile, Yang Ye had appeared in front of Little Sky.

Why did he attack?

Actually, it was very simple. He had a good relationship with Blood Maiden and the others, but he had no relationship with the Nether Pavilion itself. Now, the Nether Pavilion wanted to kill Little Sky, and Little Sky was his friend, so he naturally helped her.

Meanwhile, Little Sky glanced at Yang Ye and spoke softly, “I’ve never helped you in battle, so why are you helping me?”

Yang Ye turned to look at her, and then he smiled. He didn’t say anything to her and just turned around before walking towards the middle aged man with a pear.

Little Sky remained silent for a long time while looking at Yang Ye from behind, and then she spoke lightly, “What a silly fellow!”

The middle aged man sized up Yang Ye, and then he shook his head slightly, “You’re no match for me.”

Yang Ye chuckled, “I’d like to give it a try.”

The spear-wielding man nodded, and then he vanished on the spot. He was in front of Yang Ye when his figure appeared again, and then his spear shot towards the center of Yang Ye’s forehead.

Yang Ye closed his eyes. The middle aged man was too fast. He couldn’t see his movements at all. So, Yang Ye couldn’t use his eyes to look at the middle aged man, he had to use his heart.

When the tip of the spear was less than half an inch away from the center of Yang Ye’s forehead, the tip of a sword suddenly struck against the tip of the spear.

Clang!

A clear and resounding clang erupted. The spear shook violently, and its trajectory was altered, causing it to scrape by Yang Ye’s ear. However, the middle aged man suddenly twisted his wrist, and the spear instantly transformed from a stabbing to sweeping motion. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

If it struck him, Yang Ye’s head would definitely fall from his body!

Fortunately, Yang Ye wasn’t slow at all. His figure had bent backwards at the exact same moment that the middle aged man had changed his stab to a sweeping strike, allowing Yang Ye to avoid that lethal strike. At the same time, he tapped his right foot down lightly, and his figure maintained a strange posture as it shot forward.

However, the middle aged man’s spear suddenly stopped, and then it suddenly slammed downwards.

Yang Ye’s expression changed when he noticed this, and his sword instantly changed from an offensive stab to a defensive raise.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s figure was blasted to the ground. Meanwhile, the middle aged man’s spear swept towards the ground.

Yang Ye hurriedly raised his sword to defend himself again.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted over 1km away!

At this moment, there was a wisp of scarlet red on the corner of Yang Ye’s mouth. At the same time, his entire arm was numb. Actually, it wasn’t just his arm, he felt like all his internal organs had been cracked!

He’s really strong! Yang Ye looked up at the middle aged man while a solemn expression filled his eyes. The middle aged man’s strength was much greater than the one-armed woman and one-armed man! Even though he had the Enlightened Sword Heart, the middle aged man’s instinct in battle far surpassed his own!

It wasn’t just the middle aged man’s instinct in combat, the man’s strength and speed far surpassed him too!

If he’d made even the slightest mistake during the battle, then he may have been instantly killed. Because his physical defenses couldn’t go head-on against the middle aged man’s spear. If he was struck by it, he would be crippled even if he avoided death!

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then he closed his eyes slowly. A moment later, the Sword God’s Seal emanated a dazzling ray of light on his forehead, and it didn’t take long for his sword intent to rise to the Returnal Rank.

At the same time, his sword vanished.

The Rebirth Sword!

The Rebirth Sword that was enhanced by two types of intents!

The middle aged man’s expression remained calm, and he stabbed his spear forward.

Bang!

A wave of terrifying energy instantly erupted from between Yang Ye and the middle aged man. It swept towards the surroundings and caused ripples to surge through the surrounding space.

A few breaths of time later, everything returned to normal.

Yang Ye and the middle aged man were still where they’d been standing.

Yang Ye had a solemn expression on his face. Because the middle aged man had crushed his attack with such ease.

The middle aged man’s strength was much greater than he’d imagined!

The middle aged man didn’t speak. He was about to attack when he suddenly looked up, and then his expression instantly changed. Because over 20 of the black robed experts from the Nether Pavilion had perished in battle!

Moreover, the number of casualties were increasing incessantly!

Retreat? This thought appeared in the middle aged man’s mind, but it didn’t take long for him to reject it. If they retreated now, then even more would die. However, if the battle continued, then it was very likely for them to be completely annihilated.

If that happened, even the Nether Pavilion wouldn’t be able to endure such losses!

A moment of silence ensued, and then the middle aged man suddenly gazed at Little Sky before transforming into a ray of light that shot towards her.

At this moment, he was very well aware that the only way to resolve the current situation was to capture Little Sky. So long as she was captured, the battle would be decided.

Little Sky’s face remained indifferent when she saw the middle aged man charge at her. She didn’t do anything, and it was Yang Ye who attacked.

Yang Ye appeared in front of Little Sky again. A vicious glow flashed through the middle aged man’s eyes when he saw Yang Ye standing on front of Little Sky again, “Fuck off!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stabbed his spear at Yang Ye.

At this moment, he didn’t hold back at all.

Crack!

The space at the tip of the middle aged man’s spear instantly cracked open. At the same time, the space around it started rippling violently.

A wisp of ferocity flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, and then a terrifying wave of energy surged out from within him. In an instant, his entire body was suffused by a layer of faint golden light!

The energy of the Demon God!

Yang Ye’s own strength was utterly insufficient to fight the middle aged man, so he had no choice but to utilize the Demon God’s energy.

Once he had the Demon God’s energy surging through him, his strength instantly rose by five times, and even his defenses had grown tremendously.

At this moment, the middle aged man’s spear had arrived in front of Yang Ye. As soon as it did, a wave of invisible force enveloped down towards Yang Ye. Yang Ye instantly felt suffocated, and his entire body felt like it was about to explode!

Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly. He flipped his palm and the ancient sheath appeared in his grasp. He sheathed it, and then he drew it and swung it swiftly.

Om!

A sword howl shot up into the sky, and then another loud explosion resounded. At the same time, the space in a huge area instantly cracked open while the space even further away was rippling like boiling water. It was an absolutely shocking sight.

After around 15 minutes passed, the entire area gradually calmed.

Yang Ye and the middle aged man were standing around 3km apart.

At this moment, blood was seeping out incessantly from the corner of Yang Ye’s mouth. Moreover, his body had cracked open while blood was ceaselessly seeping out from within him, causing him to be drenched in blood.

As for the middle aged man, he was in a much better state. There were only two injuries on his body.

Obviously, the middle aged man had gained the upper hand in the collision.

Little Sky walked over to Yang Ye and spoke softly, “Are you alright?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Do I look like I’m alright?”

This time, he’d almost been blasted into bits. Fortunately, the Primordial Violet Energy within him had been ceaselessly repairing his body. Otherwise, just that collision would have blasted him into bits.

Based on his estimations, the spear-wielding man’s strength had surpassed the Rebirth Realm.

Little Sky touched the injury on Yang Ye’s chest and said, “Even though you’ve suffered such heavy injuries, there are benefits from it.”

Yang Ye nodded. It was true. The battle with the middle aged man allowed him to understand many things. As far as he was concerned, the experience he’d gained from this battle was greater than bitter cultivation for numerous years. He’d always felt that fighting was the best way to improve his strength swiftly.

No matter how one cultivated, one still had to fight in the end.

Suddenly, a middle aged man said, “It ends now.”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure appeared in front of Yang Ye and Little Sky.

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly. He was about to attack, but Little Sky suddenly took his hand and said, “Allow me!”
