Chapter 1962 – The 5th Level!

A pitch black hand had torn open Yang Ye’s chest!

It shot straight through towards Yang Ye’s heart!

Fortunately, his reaction was very quick, and he immediately dodged over 1km away.

Yang Ye glanced at his chest. It had been torn open completely, and his internal organs were clearly visible.

Yang Ye looked up, and the area before him was completely empty!

There was nothing there!

If it wasn’t for the injury on his chest, he would even think that he’d been seeing things.

What the hell was that?

Yang Ye had an extremely solemn expression on his face.

Yang Ye flipped his palm, and Spiritbreaker appeared in his grasp. This time, he had to use his sword. Because he’d almost died just now!

It was too damn dangerous here!

Yang Ye healed on the spot and continued forward. He hadn’t gone far when that monster with the face of a human and body of a snake appeared in front of him again.

Swish!

The monster didn’t dally and immediately shot at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye took a small step back, and then he raised his sword and swung it.

Bang!

It instantly blasted the monster away. Yang Ye was just about to follow up with another attack, but his expression suddenly changed, and then he turned around and swung his sword.

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and Yang Ye was blasted over 1km away.

However, there was nothing in front of him!

The monster had vanished as well!

It was absolutely elusive!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. He knew that the thing which attacked him hadn’t left, and it was watching him.

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he suddenly took a step forward. After that, he looked to the side before swinging his sword.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy shot towards an ancient tree on his right!

Bang!

The tree instantly exploded apart, and a figure flashed out from within it and shot towards Yang Ye!

A vicious glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, and he swung Spiritbreaker in the figure’s direction with both hands!

Hiss!

Bang!

The surroundings suddenly fell silent!

There was a person in front of Yang Ye. The person merely wore a few strips of cloth, and his upper body was bare. All sorts of blood red markings covered the person’s upper body.

That wasn’t even the most important thing. The most important thing was that this man had grabbed Yang Ye’s sword with just his bare hands!

He’d forcefully grabbed and stopped Yang Ye’s sword!

A moment of silence ensued, and then he suddenly slammed his fist at Yang Ye’s face!

Yang Ye clenched his left fist and slammed it at the man’s fist.

Boom!

They immediately split apart and moved backwards repeatedly. But it didn’t take long for them to stop.

Yang Ye glanced at Spiritbreaker, and there was a pitch black claw mark on it!

Yang Ye looked up at the man. Meanwhile, the man suddenly vanished on the spot and appeared in front of Yang Ye. At the same time, Yang Ye swung his sword again.

Bang!

A powerful wave of energy swept out from the man. As soon as Yang Ye’s sword came into contact with it, Yang Ye was blasted away. But it only took a while for Yang Ye to transform into a ray of light that shot at the man.

At the same time, 10 ethereal swords appeared around the man. The swords instantly surrounded the man, and then countless rays of light enveloped his figure.

Roar!

Suddenly, a furious roar resounded from amidst the light, and then a wave of powerful energy shattered the sword energy before the man shot out from there.

Meanwhile, a ray of light just happened to arrive before the man.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded, and they split apart again!

Yang Ye glanced at his chest. There was a palm print there which the man had left behind! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The man was injured too. There were at least five cuts on his body.

At this moment, the man was looking at Yang Ye, and there was a slightly solemn expression in his eyes.

Their gazes met in the darkness, and then they vanished on the spot.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Explosions resounded incessantly.

The mysterious man’s strength simply exceeded Yang Ye’s imagination. The man’s combat instinct and everything else were absolutely formidable.

This battle went on for an entire two hours.

During this period, they kept exchanging blows and suffered injuries.

The sky gradually brightened…

Suddenly, the mysterious man stopped, glanced at Yang Ye, and then vanished into the distance.

Yang Ye frowned slightly. Who was that?

At the exit of Hell Forest.

As soon as he emerged from the forest, Yang Ye saw A’Man and Gu Li.

A’Man sized up Yang Ye and asked, “Encountered the Snake-Humans?”

“Snake-Humans?” Yang Ye shook his head and told her about the mysterious man he encountered.

A’Man’s face fell.

Yang Ye glanced at her, “Do you know who he is?”

She gazed at the forest and replied, “A local.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “A local?”

A’Man explained, “A very long time ago, this place was no different from the outside world. But for some reason, the spirit energy here gradually dried up, the ground collapsed, and volcanoes erupted… As for the living beings in this world and even the people here mostly vanished. However, some of them survived.”

She fell silent for a moment before she continued, “Even the snake-humans and wyverns are survivors from that time. These locals are very hostile towards us. However, they wish for more of us to come here!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She answered, “Our arrival brought some life to this world, our arrival brought spirit energy. They can take spirit energy from us!”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Can’t they leave this place?”

“It’s difficult!” A’Man explained, “All of us have the support of others. So, when we want to leave, our clans will send experts to get us. While we mainly have to rely on ourselves, the experts from our clans will help us deal with quite a bit of the danger. But these locals can only rely on themselves to leave this place, and that’s absolutely difficult.”

“Why?” Yang Ye didn’t really understand, “I didn’t encounter any difficulty getting into this place!”

A'Man chuckled, “It’s very easy to descend a mountain, but what about ascending it? Even if will be instantly killed by the formation around the teleportation formation.”

Yang Ye asked, “Who placed that formation there?”

A'Man shook her head, “I’m not very sure. However, there are two explanations. The first is that it was created by the experts of this world, and the second is that it was created by the experts of the outside world.”

The experts of the outside world!

Yang Ye wanted to ask more, but a figure suddenly ran out of the forest. It was Yu Jing.

Once he emerged from the forest, he fell weakly to the ground and started gasping for breath. His body was covered in claw marks.

Besides that, he was holding two fist-sized pearls.

A’Man glanced at the pearls and said, “You killed two?”

Yu Jing gazed at A’Man and cracked a smile, “I’m amazing, right?”

A’Man spoke indifferently, “I killed five in my first trip to the forest!”

Yu Jing felt speechless.

A’Man looked up at the forest. The last member of their group hadn’t come out yet, and it was Mo Ke.

Time trickled by. Two hours later, A’Man stood up, “Let’s go!”

Yu Jing asked, “We’re not going to wait for him?”

A’Man shook her head slightly, “He won’t be coming back!”

Everyone’s hearts sank when they heard this.

“Both of you should get used to this!” Meanwhile, A’Man added, “Death is a very normal thing here.”

She tapped her right foot against the ground and transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

“She’s not wrong!” Meanwhile, Gu Li suddenly said, “Maybe you don’t really understand why she brought you here and didn’t protect you in secret.”

Yu Jing asked, “Why?”

Gu Li explained, “If she went with Mo Ke, then he definitely wouldn’t have died. However, can she protect him forever? The answer is no. All of us need to grow, and she can’t help us forever!”

He vanished into the sky once he finished speaking.

Yu Jing asked Yang Ye, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “She’s right. We should rely on ourselves. Just like you. Didn’t you survive two snake-humans?”

Yu Jing fell silent for a short while, and then he said, “I feel like I’m slowly changing after I came here!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Yu Jing gazed at Yang Ye, “I would never speak to a human in the outside world. But I have many human friends in this place. Moreover, I noticed that many of my past thoughts were immature and laughable!”

He patted Yang Ye on the shoulder and continued, “Nobility doesn’t come from status or strength, it’s from culture and morals. Just look at Big Sis, while she isn’t beautiful, she is respected by everyone.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Yu Jing continued, “Come on! Let’s head back and have a good rest!”

Both of them vanished on the spot.

Sky Residence City.

As soon as he arrived at Sky Residence City, Yang Ye’s expression changed because the tiny vortex had suddenly started to spin rapidly.

What’s going on?

It didn’t take long for wild joy to surge through Yang Ye!

The 5th level!

The 5th level of the Primordial Pagoda was about to open!
