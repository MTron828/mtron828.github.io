Chapter 2169 – Initial Spirit Star!

Five million immortal crystals!

Even the Weapon Progenitor’s eyelids couldn’t help but twitch. It wasn’t a small amount, yet Yang Ye was demanding such an exorbitant price!

The atmosphere here became quite oppressive.

Now, it was up to the Spirit God to agree or not.

If he refused, the outcome was obvious. They would have to go to war. But if they agreed, they would be making a compromise.

War or compromise!

A long time passed before the Spirit God nodded slightly, “You’re right. The Sprite Lord is a being born of this world, and she definitely would want something in return for helping us. We’ll give you five million immortal crystals!”

He'd chosen to make a compromise!

A smile appeared on Yang Ye’s face. Meanwhile, the Spirit God added, “I hope she’ll be able to find us a way out once you get those immortal crystals!”

“Of course!” Yang Ye smiled, “She’ll do her best!”

“Not just her best!” The Spirit God looked at Yang Ye in the eyes, “She must.”

Yang Ye met his gaze, “If you say so!”

They looked at each other for a long time. In the end, the Spirit God gazed at the Demon God and the others, they nodded slightly. It didn’t take long for them to put together five million immortal crystals.

Yang Ye naturally took them all without refusing!

Once he took the immortal crystals, Yang Ye added, “I have one more request. This isn’t the Spirit Lord’s request but my own… Don’t look at me like that, it isn’t a very difficult condition. It’s just a small matter. I need your information, the information you have about all the organizations in the large universe, especially those organizations hiding in the shadows. Besides that, I need the information you have about the endless black holes. I need all of that!”

The Spirit God frowned slightly, “Why?”

Yang Ye replied, “If we’re looking for a way out, shouldn’t we focus on the endless black holes?”

The Spirit God glanced at Yang Ye, “Alright, we’ll do it!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’ll let you know if I need any other help!”

Yang Ye turned around and vanished into the sky.

The others fell silent.

Meanwhile, the Devil Monarch spoke abruptly, “What an exorbitant price!”

The Spirit God replied indifferently, “If he can find us a way out, then not to mention five million, even fifty million is worth it. Immortal crystals are precious, but our lives are much more precious.”

Meanwhile, the Demon God asked, “What if he fails?”

The Spirit God fell silent for a moment and replied, “Then we’ll make him pay a thousandfold!”

All of them fell silent.

They naturally understood what the Spirit Got meant. But Yang Ye wasn’t easy to deal with now! He’d almost instantly killed the Sovereign of Sky with a single attack. Even if such strength was inferior to a progenitor, it wasn’t that far away anymore!

But Yang Ye was just at the Major Zen Realm!

The Major Zen Realm!

Their hearts grew even heavier when they thought up to this point.

A long time passed before the Spirit God gazed at the Weapon Progenitor, “Senior, what do you think?”

The Weapon Progenitor grinned, “My Weapon Path will not be interfering in these things. All I can say is I hope he’ll be able to find a way out for all of you. Otherwise, our large universe will probably collapse before the End Times even arrive completely!”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

The Spirit God glanced at the surroundings and said, “Everyone, don’t act against Yang Ye and the human race for now, and if he has any requests, just fulfill them if they aren’t too much! So long as he can find us a way out, all losses are worth it!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished into the sky.

A short while later, all of them had left, except the Sovereign of Sky.

At this moment, while he’d lost half his face, the ferocity and madness on his face were still visible on the other intact half.

…

After he left the Weapon Dimension, Yang Ye didn’t choose to return to the Human Dimension. He traveled through space and arrived at an abandoned planet.

Initial Spirit Star!

The planet before him was the former main continent of the Initial Civilization.

He wasn’t just here to look for treasures.

He was here for a way out!

Yang Ye was the leader of the human race now, so he had to be responsible for the human race’s fate. Perhaps he couldn’t save the entire human race, but he would do his best.

Responsibility!

As a man, since he’d taken some things on his shoulders, then he had to bear the responsibility that came with it.

There was a huge formation around the large universe. While it wasn’t completely unrealistic to make the Alliance of All and the three paths work together to activate it, it was definitely difficult. Moreover, he refused to trust the Alliance of All, the Buddhist Path, and the Weapon Path. He wanted to try and see if he could use the human race’s own strength to activate that formation, and then lead the human race out of this large universe and avoid the End Times!

He'd come to the Initial Spirit Star because he wanted to see if he could find a way here!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then his divine sense gradually stretched out. A long time passed before he withdrew it.

He didn’t sense any signs of life!

However, he did notice something. He noticed an abandoned city.

Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was before the extremely grand and ancient city when he appeared again.

Its walls were extremely high, almost 300m tall. He felt like an ant standing before the city of humans and looking at its walls.

Yang Ye entered the city, and it was a scene of desolation. Besides some ancient buildings, there were no signs of life, and those buildings seemed to have existed for countless years. So while they weren’t destroyed, they were in ruins, and they emanated a terrible smell.

Yang Ye remained silent for an instant, and then he flicked a ray of sword energy forward.

Hiss!

It instantly struck against the wall before him. However, the wall wasn’t blasted apart, and merely a mark was left behind there!

It’s so strong! A slightly solemn expression appeared on Yang Ye’s face. Based on his current strength, even a Sage would have found that sword energy difficult to resist!

Based on these buildings before him, Yang Ye could sense how powerful the Initial Civilization had been!

Yang Ye walked around the city, but he didn’t find anything. Right when he was about to leave, Tian Xiu came outside with Snowy in her arms. Yang Ye had quite a strange expression on his face as he gazed at her. Because she didn’t need any help from him to leave the Primordial Pagoda now. Moreover, she didn’t need the pagoda’s permission either. She could just go in and leave when she wanted!

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu suddenly pointed into the distance, “Big Brother, there’s something over there!”

There’s something there?

Snowy had looked over in that direction before Yang Ye could say anything, and then she blinked and gazed at Yang Ye before waving her claws.

There seems to be something there!

That was what Snowy was telling him!

Yang Ye grinned, “Then let’s head over there!”

He paused for a moment and continued, “You two go inside for now, alright?”

Tian Xiu looked up at Yang Ye, “Big Brother is very strong now. You can protect Snowy and me!”

Yang Ye roared with laughter, “Then let’s go!”

As he spoke, he took her hand and walked forward. Tian Xiu glanced at Yang Ye, and there was a trace of an unusual expression in her eyes, but it only lasted for a moment.

Meanwhile, Snowy suddenly appeared on Yang Ye’s left. Just like Tian Xiu was holding Yang Ye’s right hand, Snowy took Yang Ye’s left hand. Just like that, Yang Ye held both their hands as he went forward!

A short while later, Tian Xiu told Yang Ye to stop. There was a huge platform in front of them, and four vicious demon beasts were around it. Of course, they were statues.

The demon beasts were of different shapes, and Yang Ye had never seen any one of them.

They surrounded the platform, and there was a pool of clear water at the center of the platform.

A sacrificial platform!

That was what came to Yang Ye’s mind. The thing before him seemed like a sacrificial platform!

Yang Ye looked at Tian Xiu, “What’s this?”

She shook her head slightly, “I don’t know. I just sense something there!”

Something? Yang Ye walked over to the platform. There were a few strange words inscribed below the platform. Yang Ye had never seen these words in his life, so he didn’t know what they meant. Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and walked forward. He gazed at the statue before him. It was like a wolf, but it was only like a wolf. It had a horn on its head, and it was shaped like a crescent. Moreover, it had just a single eye.

Yang Ye was about to touch it when Snowy suddenly flew to his shoulder and waved her claws swiftly!

Danger!

Yang Ye frowned when he realized what she was telling him. Snowy’s sense of danger was extremely strong. Since she said it was dangerous, it was definitely dangerous. Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to take Snowy and leave the platform.

Yang Ye took a deep and long glance at the platform, and then he took Tian Xiu’s hand, “Let’s go!”

Tian Xiu nodded.

Yang Ye immediately left, but he hadn’t even taken a few steps when Tian Xiu stopped. Yang Ye looked down at her, and she looked up at Yang Ye, “Something is looking at us. It’s behind us.”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He turned around and looked at the platform, but he saw nothing.

Yang Ye looked at Tian Xiu, and the latter said, “It’s still there.”

Yang Ye slowly clenched his fists when he heard this. He naturally didn’t think she was lying to him. So, he immediately activated the Sword Domain.

However, he still saw nothing!

Nothing at all!

At this moment, a solemn expression appeared on Yang Ye’s face!

Suddenly, Tian Xiu said, “It’s coming!”

Snowy blinked, hesitated for a moment, and then went into Yang Ye’s shirt. Only half her head was outside, and her paws were over her eyes.

Yang Ye gazed at Tian Xiu, “Are you sure?”

She nodded, “It’s right in front of you!”

Yang Ye couldn’t help but feel a chill run down his spine.
