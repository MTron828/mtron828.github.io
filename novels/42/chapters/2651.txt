Chapter 2652 – I Surrender!

Destiny’s arrival!

That was Yang Ye’s end goal!

Of course, he was forcing the other forms of the women in white to show themselves.

The woman in white never caused any trouble, and that was the most depressing part for him. Of course, he would probably be dead if she did try to kill Destiny Realm experts.

At the teleportation formation, Snowy inhaled spirit energy madly.

The last time he’d come to the End World, he’d actually sensed that the End World was on the verge of collapse, and it was only a matter of time!

Based on its current state, it would take a few years at most for it to be destroyed. Now, he was speeding up the process!

Of course, the End World’s experts would absolutely not allow that to happen!

It didn’t take long for Snowy to be unable to suck out any spirit energy!

On the other side of the teleportation formation, a mysterious energy had locked down the exit, so Snowy couldn’t sense the End World anymore.

Snowy blinked, tried a few more times, but failed to suck out anything!

Snowy gazed at Yang Ye, and Yang Ye’s face fell. He gazed at the teleportation formation for a long time, and then he left with Snowy.

The End World’s experts clearly refused to show themselves!

Currently, the End World was in quite an awkward situation. Because even peak Destiny Realm experts couldn’t kill Yang Ye, and if they send those truly old geezers at Yang Ye, like Heng Wangu and Zuo Mu for example, they were afraid their presence would draw the attention of Destiny.

They were too strong, so every move they made was likely to be noticed by Destiny.

It could be said that if they weren’t driven into a corner, if it wasn’t time to risk everything for their survival, experts like them wouldn’t rashly take action.

However, the End World would definitely not allow itself to be threatened by him like this.

Even if Yang Ye stopped now, the End World would refuse to stop. Because they would need Snowy soon!

Actually, it was a situation where the party that didn’t fear death would gain the upper hand!

Yang Ye clearly wasn’t afraid of death and was trying to intentionally draw over Destiny so that everyone would die together! But the people of the End World clearly didn’t want to risk their lives on Yang Ye. If they wanted to die, they wouldn’t have hid from Destiny for so long!

Once he left the End World, a middle aged man appeared where Yang Ye had been.

The Divine Abode’s master!

He gazed at the teleportation behind him and asked, “That’s it?”

Experts at their level definitely had tempers!

Actually, the people of the End World had requested to go outside and fight Yang Ye to the death. They didn’t care even if it attracted the attention of Destiny.

Unfortunately, once Destiny did arrive, it wasn’t just a matter of killing a few, it would be groups or even all of them that perished.

Meanwhile, a voice came from the teleportation formation, “Let him run free for a few more days.”

The Divine Abode’s master’s face was gloomy, and he didn’t say another word.

A long time later, he turned around and entered the teleportation formation.

The entire End Dimension returned to calm!

…

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye went over to the Ascension Platform. At this moment, Nether Maiden and the others had regained their consciousness, but they seemed quite weak.

They gazed at Yang Ye upon noticing his arrival, and he hurried over to them, “How do all of you feel?”

Blood Maiden shook her head, “We’re alright, it’s just our bodies…”

Their bodies!

Their bodies had been destroyed, and it was quite harmful to their quintessence. Even though they could rebuild their bodies, it wasn’t as good as the body they were born with.

Yang Ye lowered his head slightly. He wanted to apologize, but he realized that it wouldn’t change a thing.

Blood Maiden spoke softly, “There’s no need to blame yourself.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “It was my stupidity that caused this. I knew they would act against me yet didn’t make sufficient preparations, allowing them to target all of you. All of this could have been avoided. It was my carelessness and stupidity that caused this.”

Blood Maiden floated over to Yang Ye, “You’re not a god, so how could you think of everything?”

Yang Ye wanted to say something else, but the pig-riding young woman suddenly said, “Enough of that. Yang Ye, instead of feeling guilty over here, isn’t it better to improve your strength and help us kill those bastards?”

Obviously, she was very, very unhappy that her body had been destroyed.

Yang Ye nodded, “Of course I’ll take revenge. I…”

“Oh, right!” Suddenly, the pig-riding young woman interrupted him, “I remember that you’re quite rash. While we must get revenge, don’t make unnecessary sacrifices. Understand?”

Blood Maiden nodded slightly, “She’s absolutely right. Don’t do anything that’s beyond you. Understand?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I won’t be rash.”

Blood Maiden gazed at him in silence.

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Don’t worry, Second Sister. I guarantee that I won’t be rash, and I won’t give my life away.”

She nodded, “It’s best if you can remember that.”

She glanced at the surroundings and continued, “We’ll be staying here to rebuild our bodies for now. Right, we need Snowy to help us.”

Meanwhile, Snowy appeared before them. She gazed at them and cracked a smile to display that she was willing to help!

An hour later, Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda.

Once he found out that they were fine, he was finally able to truly relax.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and withdrew the transmission stone.

A short while later, he felt quite disappointed.

The mysterious power didn’t have any information on Qi Bitian and Little Qi!

Tian Xiu! Qi Bitian!

Yang Ye looked up at space, and then a ray of sword energy shot up into the air.

Around an hour later, Yang Ye arrived at an expanse of pitch black space.

It was the Origin World!

Of course, it had been destroyed now, and the area was pitch black. Besides dark matter and dark energy, there was no life here!

Tian Xiu and Qi Bitian had vanished here that day!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. There was a powerful form of devouring force here. Fortunately, it didn’t affect him much.

Yang Ye rose up into the air, and it didn’t take long for him to stop and unleash the Sword Domain. Under the effects of the Sword Domain, he could sense everything here clearly.

Yang Ye’s face gradually turned solemn.

There was some energy remaining here, and it was still destroying the dark space around him!

Yang Ye scanned the surroundings carefully, and he noticed four different types of energy. They were extremely terrifying too. According to his inference, they should belong to the woman in black, Little Qi, Tian Xiu, and the Unfettered One of course.

Yang Ye stood silently there in midair, and then he started to scan the four types of energy slowly. It didn’t take long for him to start following them. A little while later, one of them vanished, and he knew it should belong to the Unfettered One who’d been teleported away.

It was an extremely overbearing and powerful type of energy. Of course, the most important factor was that he’d sensed sword energy within it!

Yang Ye didn’t pursue the sword energy which belonged to the Unfettered One. After all, who knew where he’d been teleported to? Yang Ye continued tracking Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu. The energy they left behind was too strong, so their traces were obvious.

Yang Ye was quite excited because he felt that he could chase up to them if this went on!

Just like that, Yang Ye continued forward.

A long time later, Yang Ye suddenly looked to the side. A figure flashed through the distant darkness.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed, and he unleashed the Sword Domain to envelop the figure. Moreover, he tapped his right foot down and shot toward the figure.

The figure gazed at Yang Ye vigilantly.

Yang Ye glanced at the figure, “Who are you?”

The figure didn’t say a word and just vanished into the distance.

Yang Ye frowned slightly and didn’t give chase.

A long time later, he glanced at the surroundings. He realized that he wasn’t the only one tracking Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu, and there were other powers here. That figure from before may have been from Eternal Kingdom, the End World, or some other power.

He must find Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and continued tracking them.

If they weren’t in a very bad state, then it wouldn’t matter much if others found them. However, if they weren’t in a good state, then they would be in danger if they were found by the experts of the End World!

Yang Ye sped up and continued searching along the traces of energy. The further he went, the more solemn his expression got. Because he noticed that those three forms of energy were growing in strength!

It was obvious how intense their battle had been! Because those three types of energy were twisted together and ceaselessly destroying the dark matter in the surroundings!

Even though they were fighting two on one, the woman in black was no ordinary expert. Moreover, she had an extremely terrifying sword!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and continued forward.

Just like that, a long time passed before Yang Ye gradually sensed those three forms of energy were starting to weaken.

Yang Ye was shocked and continued forward. Some time later, all three forms of energy were very faint.

Yang Ye sped up. Suddenly, he stopped because two of the traces vanished here.

Yang Ye took a deep breath. He didn’t want to think of some outcomes, he really didn’t want to do that!

He continued forward along the last trace of energy.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Around an hour later, Yang Ye stopped again. There was a sword floating in front of him!

It was a sword that was pitch black like ink!

As soon as he saw this sword, Yang Ye was stunned for a moment, and then his face froze, “I’m dead!”

Meanwhile, a hand suddenly moved past Yang Ye’s shoulder and arrived before his throat.

Right when it was about to crush his throat, Yang Ye raised his hands, “I surrender!”
