Chapter 735 – Nether Maiden!

Silver hair, a linen dress, bare feet....

Nether Maiden!

The 1st on the Hallowed Rankings!

Nether Maiden who was ranked at the 1st position on the Hallowed Rankings had always been an elusive figure. So, they’d never imagined that she would show herself here. Moreover, it seemed like she was here to help Snow’s Lament! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Exactly how powerful is Snow’s Lament to actually make Nether Maiden step forward for it?

At this moment, Snow’s Lament grew even more mysterious in their eyes!

Yang Ye hadn’t expected that Nether Maiden would suddenly appear here. She was the strongest opponent he’d ever met, so he would have no chance to defeat her in battle without his sword!

“The members of Snow’s Lament insulted both you and your friend, and then they sent their forces to kill you. They are in the wrong, but you’ve killed a few hundred of their members. No matter how severe an offence it was, they’ve paid enough. So, let the matter rest, alright?” Nether Maiden’s voice was very calm and wasn’t commanding at all. This caused many people in the surroundings to be surprised.

Even though the strength Yang Ye revealed was very formidable and terrifying, none of them felt that he could fight her. So, many were extremely surprised when she spoke with him as if she was discussing the matter with him!

Yang Ye replied, “Are you the master of Snow’s Lament?”

She shook her head slightly and said, “Someone else is its master. I know what you’re trying to figure out. I haven’t stepped forward for their sake, I’ve come here for your sake!”

“For me?” Yang Ye frowned and said, “What do you mean!?”

Nether Maiden replied, “You’ll understand in the future. Besides that, Snow’s Lament isn’t as weak as you think. Of course, you don’t have to fear it with the strength you possess. However, it’s best to stop now if you don’t want to be ceaselessly plagued by trouble while you’re in the city.”

“Why?” Yang Ye was quite curious.

She answered, “Many elders and Half-Saints in the city came from Snow’s Lament, and many other clans and powers have complicated relationships with Snow’s Lament as well. To be honest, you aren’t able to annihilate them with your strength. At least for now.”

“Why tell me all of that?” This was what Yang Ye was the most curious about.

“You’ll understand in the future!” Her figure vanished once she finished speaking these words.

Yang Ye fell silent on the spot for a short while, and then he turned around and left in the end. It wasn’t that what she said had terrified him, it was that he was fully aware that it was impossible for him to continue slaughtering all of these profounders from Snow’s Lament. After all, someone would definitely step forward and stop him by force if he continued. Moreover, he didn’t want to continue wasting time here.

The members of Snow’s Lament heaved sighs of relief when they saw Yang Ye turn around and leave.

Mu Ling heaved a sigh of relief as well because it would definitely be impossible to resolve the matter if it continued.

Along with the departure of Yang Ye’s group, the danger that Snow’s Lament faced was resolved for now. As for whether Snow’s Lament would take revenge, that was something only Snow’s Lament knew.

At the same time, the news of Yang Ye challenging Snow’s Lament on his own instantly swept through the city like a storm. On the very same day, everyone knew that a formidable body refiner had appeared within the city, Yang Man!

Such an ancient method of cultivation like body refinement had appeared once more in the public eye, and it allowed many to realize how terrifying a body refiner was!

Of course, even more wanted to know Yang Man’s true identity, so countless underground organizations started to investigate Yang Ye.

...

Mu Ling led Yang Ye to Lunar Rite Hall’s headquarters. It was a luxurious palace that was even larger and more luxurious than the headquarters of Snow’s Lament. Moreover, its was more heavily guarded as well. Because Yang Ye had sensed a few dozen consciousnesses that were extremely strong sweeping towards him when he entered!

All of them were at the fifth rank of the Monarch Realm at least!

As soon as they entered the hall, a woman came over to welcome them. She was around 30 years of age, her face was bright like the full moon, her features delicate like dew, and her figure was curvaceous and well-proportioned. Moreover, she emanated a very alluring and mature aura.

“You’re Yang Man, right?” The woman walked over to Yang Ye and smiled, “You challenged Snow’s Lament on your own, and you even killed Yu Wushuang and that white robed man. Right, you probably aren’t aware of his identity. Of course, many may not be aware as well. He’s one of the 2 war generals of Snow’s Lament, and his strength is something that is even impossible for the geniuses on the 8th or even 7th ranking on the Hallowed Halls to overcome!”

“Who’re you?” asked Yang Ye.

The woman smiled, “I actually forgot to introduce myself. I’m Chou Yanmei, Lunar Rite Hall’s Vice Hall Master. I’m sorry, the Hall Master should have been here to greet you. Unfortunately, it couldn’t be helped because the Hall Master isn’t here, so I had to represent her instead. I hope you don’t me.”

“Of course I don’t!” Yang Ye smiled, and then he spoke seriously, “I told Mu Ling before this that I don’t really like being bound. So....”

Chou Yanmei smiled and said, “I understand, I really do. Because I don’t like being bound and controlled as well. You’ll enjoy full freedom in Lunar Rite Hall. Actually, it isn’t just you. Most members of Lunar Rite Hall enjoy the same treatment. We’re mainly gathered together to avoid being bullied and to unite when completing missions. In short, your worries are unnecessary. Of course, if Lunar Rite Hall is in danger or its members are in danger, and you have the ability to help, then you must lend a hand.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “That’s alright!”

Chou Yanmei’s smile grew wider when she heard this, and then she withdrew a white card which was made of crystal and passed it to Yang Ye, “This is a Point Card, and there are 5,000 points within it. Moreover, 500 points will be added to this card every single month from now onward. Oh, look at me and my memory. I forgot to tell you that you’ll be one of our Lunar Rite Hall’s 3 Guardians, and your status is only inferior to the Hall Master and the other 2 Vice Hall Masters.”

A wisp of envy flashed through Mu Ling’s eyes when she gazed at the card in Yang Ye’s hand. After all, she would have to complete missions for at least a year to accumulate 5,000 points!

A point card? Yang Ye was delighted and didn’t refuse it. He took the card from Chou Yanmei and said, “Thank you!” After all, the reason he’d come to the Ancient City of Hallows was for the sake of these points!

Chou Yanmei smiled and said, “As Lunar Rite Hall’s Guardian, you’ll have a room of your own here. However, you have to pay 50 points on a monthly basis for it. Of course, you can live outside if you like. In any case, it’s up to you. You can ask Mu Ling if you have any questions. She’ll tell you everything besides her own personal secrets. I have other matters to attend to, so I won’t be accompanying you any longer.” She turned around and left as soon as she finished speaking.

Yang Ye raised his head and glanced at Chou Yanmei while a slight smile arose on the corners of his might. Even Lunar Rite Hall had experts hidden within it! Because his intuition told him that the woman’s strength was even stronger than the white robed man!

Suddenly, Chou Yanmei stopped moving, and then she turned around and said, “I forgot to tell you that you’re ranked at the 10th position on the Hallowed Rankings now since you killed Yu Wushuang. You’ll enjoy the benefits of obtaining 2,000 points every month, and you’re even able to use those points to exchange for some unique cultivation techniques and combat techniques. Of course, the precondition is that you have sufficient points!” Chou Yanmei’s figure flashed and vanished on the spot once she was done.

“I have a question!” Yang Ye suddenly asked once Chou Yanmei left, “I’d thought the strength of those geniuses on the Hallowed Rankings would far surpass Lunar Rite Hall, the Alliance of Sabers and Swords, and Snow’s Lament. But now it would seem like it isn’t like that. Since all 3 groups in the city have members with strengths that surpass the geniuses on the Hallowed Rankings, then why are they still so superior?”

“Do you know about Yang Ye?” Mu Ling spoke abruptly.

Yang Ye and Fu Jinxian were slightly stunned, and the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched as he said, “I’ve heard of him.... What? It’s linked to him?”

Mu Ling nodded in response and said, “The geniuses on the Hallowed Rankings were actually very strong. Not to mention those few at the top, just Zuo Dengfeng wasn’t someone that Yu Wushuang or that white robed man could defeat. As for those ranked above Zuo Dengfeng like He Lianqi, Yun Qingyao, Mo Yixie, or Xiahou Xuan, all of their strengths were truly formidable. Moreover, the words ‘Hallowed Rankings’ were truly superior before they left the Hallowed Grounds! Yet now....”

When she spoke up to this point, Mu Ling shook her head and said, “The current geniuses on the Hallowed Rankings are much weaker.”

Fu Jinxian glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent. Because she understood what Mu Ling meant. Yang Ye had killed numerous geniuses who were ranked on the Hallowed Rankings, and it caused a huge amount of vacancies to instantly appear on the Hallowed Rankings. Since there were vacancies, there would naturally be people who took those positions. However, there was no one to stop them from seizing those positions. In that way, it was much easier for someone to take those positions, and it would naturally make them much weaker than their predecessors!

So it’s my fault, huh? The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched slightly, and then he said, “Right, Chou Yanmei said that I killed Yu Wushuang, so I’m ranked at the 10th position on the Hallowed Rankings, and I would obtain 2,000 points every single month. Where do I go to claim them?”

Mu Ling said, “There’s a row of numbers on your point card, we call that the card number. You just have to register that card number at a brand of the Hallowed Halls, and they’ll automatically add points into your card every single month. I’ll do it for you later!”

“Thank you!” Yang Ye smiled.

Mu Ling replied, “It’s nothing. You can come ask me if you have any questions about the Hallowed Halls. You’ve fought for so long earlier, so I presume you have to recuperate now. I won’t disturb you any longer!” Mu Ling turned around and left once she finished speaking.

“I’m going to see the Patriarch and the others!” Fu Jinxian spoke abruptly.

Yang Ye replied, “Be careful!”

Fu Jinxian nodded and left.

After they left, Yang Ye went to the room that Lunar Rite Hall had prepared for him. He closed the door and withdrew 2 spatial rings which belonged to Yu Wushuang and the white robed man from before.

There were cultivation techniques, combat techniques, and a bunch of random things in the spatial rings. Yang Ye naturally didn’t attach any importance to those things, but there were 2 things that gave Yang Ye a pleasant surprise. They were point cards. Both Yu Wushuang and the white robed man had a point card, and there were quite a bit of points within them!

Yu Wushuang had 12,000 points while the white robed man had 23,000 points! So, it totaled up to 35,000 points! Coupled with the 5,000 points which he’d just gained, he could use those points to gain a Dao Rank technique!

Of course, the greatest treasure he obtained today was that ice shield!

Yang Ye’s room was instantly frozen in ice when he took the ice shield out of the Primordial Pagoda. At the same time, a fist sized and pure white little object that was shaped like a tadpole flashed out from within the shield, and it shot towards the outside at a terribly swift speed.

It was an ice spirit!
