Chapter 2490 – The Emperor of Acting!

Put on an act!

Yang Ye had no choice this time. Because if he defeated the Two World Realm demon beast with ease, it would be really unusual.

Extremely unusual!

At this moment, the Primal Lionwolf had arrived before him!

Yang Ye clenched his right fist and slammed it forward!

He only used 30% of his strength!

It slammed straight against the Primal Lionwolf’s head.

Bam!

The Lionwold was blasted backward, and at practically the exact same moment, Sword Scroll’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Retreat!”

Yang Ye reacted very quickly. He tapped his right foot against the ground and shot backward like a cannonball.

He flew all the way to the cage’s wall before stopping himself.

Kong Ming and the others outside the cage smiled coldly from the sight of this, but it didn’t take long for their smiles to freeze. It was because Yang Ye had crawled up to his feet again!

He was on his feet again!

They were stunned.

“A body cultivator!” Kong Ming stared at Yang Ye. He hadn’t expected Yang Ye to be a body cultivator.

No one had expected it!

After all, body cultivators were rare in every world. Because human bodies were innately weak. Unless it was someone blessed naturally by the heavens, very few would ever cultivate the body!

It was too painful and difficult!

Yet now, they had encountered someone like that.

Yang Ye crawled up from the ground and clenched his fists. His gaze was extremely vigilant as if he was facing a formidable enemy!

The Lionwolf glanced at Yang Ye. Its instinct told it that this man before it was very dangerous, but it was doubtful when it saw Yang Ye’s face. What danger would a human like Yang Ye pose? He was just a body cultivator!

So, the Lionwolf charged at Yang Ye again!

It was very fast, and it was extremely strong too!

Space rippled in its wake!

Yang Ye gritted his teeth and acted like he was resolved to die in this collision, and it didn’t take long for him to charge at the Lionwolf too.

Just like that, Yang Ye and the Lionwolf collided once more.

Bang!

They split apart again.

Yang Ye was blasted away and slammed against the cage, causing it to shake. As for the Lionwolf, it was pushed back repeatedly and slammed against the cage too.

Powerful!

The Lionwolf was quite vigilant at this point. It looked up at Yang Ye, and it saw Yang Ye twitching incessantly on the ground as if he was enduring terrible pain!

The Lionwolf was stunned and wondered if it had killed Yang Ye!

Suddenly, Yang Ye crawled up slowly to his feet. It seemed like he couldn’t even walk steadily at this point, and he almost tripped and fell again.

The Lionwolf glanced at Yang Ye and charged at him once more.

This time, it charged faster and with more force behind it!

The others shook their heads from the sight of this and couldn’t bear to watch. As far as they were concerned, Yang Ye would be turned to mush now!

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the Lionwolf was blasted away. Of course, Yang Ye was blasted away first, and he slammed against the cage, almost blasting it into bits.

Yang Ye laid there on the ground as his body trembled even more violently than before.

The Lionwolf didn’t feel very well either. Force went in both ways, so when it collided against Yang Ye with such force, the force of collision was something that even it couldn’t endure repeatedly. Moreover, others may not realize it, but it knew very well that the young man on the ground over there possessed extremely powerful strength! Moreover, it had a feeling like the young man was holding back!

Was it a misconception?

Yang Ye crawled up shakily, and then he almost fell again once he got on his feet.

He’d stood up again!

Everyone had a weird expression on their faces!

He was on his feet again!

It was the same for the Lionwolf.

He can still stand? But he must be almost spent!

The Lionwolf didn’t allow its thoughts to wander and just charged at Yang Ye once more. This time, it used its full strength and was determined to blast Yang Ye into mush.

Yang Ye gritted his teeth and seemed resolved to die as he leaped up and charged as well.

Just like that, they collided once more!

Boom!

An explosion resounded throughout the cage, and it shook violently.

When everything calmed down, Yang Ye was on the ground, and so was the Primal Lionwolf.

The spectators were stunned speechless.

It didn’t take long for the Lionwolf to get back on its feet. If one looked carefully, one would notice that its body had cracked open. As for Yang Ye, his body was trembling incessantly as if he wouldn’t be able to hold on any longer.

Not long after the Primal Demon got back on its feet, Yang Ye did the same.

The Lionwolf was utterly stunned by this.

He can still get up?

It had used its full strength earlier. As far as it was concerned, it could crush that human to death with absolute ease! Because the human was on the verge of exhaustion!

However, the cruel fact before him was that the human had got up again!

Again!

The Primal Lionwolf was furious!

Its ferocity had been aroused!

The Lionwolf’s eyes were filled with ferocity and viciousness, and it only took a moment for it to charge at Yang Ye again.

At this moment, everyone could sense its rage and viciousness!

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then his face strained. It was like he was using all his strength as he quickly charged forward.

Just like that, they collided once more.

Boom!

A wave of powerful energy erupted within the cage, causing cracks to appear throughout the cage. This time, they didn’t split apart but were locked in combat instead.

Yes!

The man and beast were fighting at close-quarters!

A melee battle!

Fist against claw!

The spectators were dumbstruck. A human at the True Void Realm was fighting a melee battle against a Two World Realm demon beast?

In the Primordial Pagoda, the dragon and the other demons exchanged glances as they wondered what Yang Ye was doing. After all, they knew Yang Ye’s strength very well. Logically speaking, a demon like that would only take a single punch from him!

But he seemed like he wasn’t really a match for it right now!𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The man and demon were still fighting outside the pagoda!

A long time passed before Yang Ye asked, “Sword Scroll, can I stop acting?”

A short while later, she spoke solemnly, “No, you must barely win or the higher-ups of the Ancient Sword Sect will become suspicious.”

Barely win!

Yang Ye shook his head. It felt so troublesome to him. However, for the sake of Sword Scroll’s main body, he had no other choice!

Just like that, man and beast fought for almost an hour before they finally stopped. Yang Ye laid there on the ground while the Lionwolf did the same.

They were exhausted!

It was truly exhausted this time. It had used all its strength, but that seemingly exhausted human refused to go down!

He just wouldn’t go down! Even if he did fall to the ground, he would climb back up again!

Just like this very moment, the human was ceaselessly trembling on the ground as if he couldn’t stand up again. However, it knew very well that so long as it charged over, the human would climb back up and fight it!

It didn’t want to fight anymore!

As if he could sense the Lionwolf’s feelings, the white-haired old man outside the cage spoke abruptly, “That’s enough!”

That’s enough!

Did he get in? Or did he fail?

Everyone gazed at the old man.

The old man waved his hand, and Yang Ye was left behind while everyone else was made to leave.

The outer court elder, Kong Ming, hesitated for a moment and walked over to the old man, “Elder Xu, he’s heartless and doesn’t care about his fellow disciples at all. He’ll bring calamity to us if he’s allowed to stay.”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “He’s a good piece of metal. If we temper him well, he may become a pretty good genius for our sect, and a few dozen years later, he may become a central pillar of our sect.”

Kong Ming thought for a moment and said, “As you say, Elder Xu!”

Elder Xu nodded slightly, “Don’t think too much about it. People with strength and talent usually have a temper, and the young having a temper is pretty normal. Don’t worry, I’ll make him change once he enters the Inner Court. After all, none of the geniuses in the Inner Court have a good temper.”

Kong Ming nodded and left.

The other disciples naturally didn’t dare to stay and left too.

Elder Xu walked over to Yang Ye and asked, “Are you still going to keep your act up?”

Yang Ye remained there motionlessly!

Elder Xu spoke indifferently, “Do you want me to help you loosen up?”

Yang Ye knew that he couldn’t continue the act. He stood up and smiled embarrassedly, “Sorry, Elder Xu!”

The old man glanced at him and spoke indifferently, “The Limitbreaker Realm?”

Yang Ye stopped concealing it and restored his cultivation.

The old man asked, “Your body too?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Elder Xu nodded slightly, “How rare. Tell me, why have you come to my sect?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “I want to learn the Ancient Sword Sect’s best mental cultivation techniques and sword techniques, like the Ancient Sword Scroll and Heavenly Sword Scripture.”

The Heavenly Sword Scripture had been written by Sword Scroll too. It was a powerful sword technique which wasn’t very useful to him. He only mentioned it so he could gain Elder Xu’s trust!

Elder Xu’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Few are aware of the Ancient Sword Scroll, and very few know of the Heavenly Sword Scripture!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “I really want to learn them!”

Elder Xu asked, “Are you from the South Region’s Ye Clan?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Yes, but I’m just an illegitimate child from a branch family. In short, there’s no link between us, and they don’t know about me!”

An illegitimate child!

Elder Xu frowned slightly, “How did an illegitimate child attain such accomplishments?”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, “Um, Senior, can’t I obtain some fortuitous encounters? You’re just asking because you’re afraid I have malicious intentions. But Senior, just think about it, what can I possibly do? My goal is simple, it’s the Ancient Sword Scroll and Heavenly Sword Scripture. If you refuse to let me learn it, I’ll just leave!”

Elder Xu gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “You’re very frank. As for those techniques, if you have the ability, you can learn them all. You’re an Inner Court Disciple of my Ancient Sword Sect now.”
