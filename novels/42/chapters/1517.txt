Chapter 1518 - When Have I Ever Been Afraid Of Risking My Life?!

Translator: InVader

Book 12 — Conspiracy

I don’t think I’ve ever lost!

Yang Ye was stunned on the spot!

Little Sky was very mysterious, extremely even. In the beginning, he thought that she really didn’t know how to fight, but only now did he find out that it wasn’t the case. It wasn’t that she didn’t know how to fight, she just didn’t like to fight, and then she did something extremely amazing and sealed her ability to fight.

Who was she?

He was curious!

Absolutely curious!

Besides being curious about Little Sky’s identity and background, he was curious about her strength. How strong was she? Yang Ye didn’t know the answer, nor could he make a guess, but he knew that she was definitely not weak!

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment before he said, “Little Sky, can you remove the seal and give me a hand?”

Little Sky blinked, and then she shook her head, “I can’t!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She replied, “Because I forgot how to remove the seal!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

Meanwhile, Little Sky added, “Moreover, even if I can, I can’t help you fight.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why is that? Aren’t we good friends?”

She thought for a moment and said, “Do you know why Little Little Sky and the others don’t interfere in the business of your human race and the various other races? Because of a law!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “A law?”

Little Sky nodded, “The law of survival. The universe is like an ecosystem. Every person, demon beast, and other living beings in this universe reinforce and neutralize each other. Simply speaking, everything in the universe reinforces and neutralizes each other. If Little Little Sky and the others interfere, it’ll damage the ecosystem and make it unbalanced. The consequences of that are extremely serious. So, if the various inhabitants of the universe don’t harm the core of the universe, Little Little Sky and the others won’t interfere in your battles.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand!”

She grinned, “Good luck! I’m going to play!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she entered the world within the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then he looked up at the stone stairs. This time, he could only rely on himself! He didn’t choose to ascend it openly. He merged himself into the space here and concealed his aura with the Sword Domain before sneaking up the stairway.

The reason he’d asked Ye Liuyun to announce that he would be ascending to the large world in a month from now was actually to deceive everyone. He was certain that the powers of the large world knew that he would be coming in a month from now. However, he wasn’t going to do that, and he was going to try and enter the large world right now!

He intended to take them by surprise!

Yang Ye snuck up all the way. It went very smoothly, and he didn’t encounter anyone.

However, Yang Ye remained fully vigilant. Even though he’d told the world he would only ascend to the large world in a month from now, no one could guarantee that those powers in the large world would only send experts to guard the Heavenpath in a month from now?

So, he had to be careful!

Around six hours later, Yang Ye suddenly stopped.

There was a multicolored door not too far ahead from him.

Heaven’s Door!

If he passed through that door, it would be equivalent to entering the territory of the large world.

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment, and then he shot through the door. Around 10 breaths of time later, Yang Ye opened his eyes. As soon as he did, he didn’t even have the time to see the surroundings clearly when a furious shout resounded, “Who dares to use the Heavenpath?!”

As soon as the voice finished resounding, a white robed old man appeared before Yang Ye.

At this moment, Yang Ye had finally seen the surroundings clearly. He was on a circular platform. Heaven’s Door was behind him, and an invisible barrier was all around him. It was a partially sealed off pocket of space, and there was another door not too far ahead.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, “This is the large world?”

“You’re that fellow, Yang Ye!” Meanwhile, the white robed old man spoke abruptly in a low voice, “Aren’t you coming in a month from now?”

Yang Ye gazed at the white robed old man, “Are you from the Ma Clan, Emperor Sect, or War Pavilion? Or are you from the Divine Phoenix Clan?”

“The Ma Clan!” A ferocious smile curled up on the corners of the old man’s mouth, “Yang Ye, you just had to come here! Today…”

Suddenly, two terrifying waves of intent surged out explosively from Yang Ye. At the same time, his sword vanished from his grasp.

The old man’s expression had changed drastically when Yang Ye’s sword vanished, and his aura at the Dualism Realm surged out from within him while accompanied by a beam of white light.

Boom!

A loud explosion resounded, and then the old man was blasted away. Mouthfuls of blood sprayed incessantly as the old man flew through the air, and it was a truly magnificent sight!

Even though he’d been struck by Yang Ye’s Rebirth Sword, the old man hadn’t been annihilated in an instant!

He was a Dualism Realm expert, a true Dualism Realm expert that hadn’t been suppressed! If the old man was in the lower dimensions and had been suppressed to the Deity Realm, then Yang Ye’s attack might have been able to kill him in an instant! Unfortunately, this wasn’t the lower dimensions, it was within the territory of the large world, so the old man had been suppressed!

After he blasted the old man away, Yang Ye didn’t stop. He transformed into a ray of light that appeared before the old man, and then he drew his sword and swung it!

Heavenrend!

Three overlapped Heavenrends!

Boom!

The white robed old man hadn’t even been able to recover from his shock when this attack obliterated him!

The might of three overlapped Heavenrends was merely slightly inferior to the Rebirth Sword, but it could similarly pose a threat to Dualism Realm experts!

After he killed the old man, Yang Ye didn’t stay for a moment longer and shot towards the door in front of him. He would definitely not choose to go head-on against the other powers of the large world. So long as he entered the large world and concealed himself, then could anyone find him? At that time, they would be out in the open while he would be hiding in the shadows. So, he wouldn’t have to fear them regardless of how many Rebirth Realm or Dualism Realm experts they had!

He refused to fight them head-on, and he intended to be shameless!

Yang Ye was very fast and instantly entered the door. However, it only took a moment for Yang Ye to fly out of the door, and he flew extremely far away!

It didn’t take long for an old man in a luxurious robe to walk out slowly from behind the door!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly once he stopped himself.

A Rebirth Realm expert!

He hadn’t expected that the large world would actually send a Rebirth Realm expert to deal with him! Needless to say, they really thought highly of him!

The old man sized up Yang Ye, “You’re Yang Ye, right? Haha, I heard you’re coming a month from now. I never expected you to trick us. Fortunately, he sent us a message in time. Otherwise, you might have really been able to enter our large world.”

I was still too slow! Yang Ye slowly clenched his fists. The reason he’d immediately executed the Rebirth Sword and Heavenrend was because he was afraid that the white robed old man from the Ma Clan would send a message to the large world. However, he was still too slow. Now, he was in quite an embarrassing situation.

The gap between him and the Rebirth Realm was too huge. Even if he had sword intent, slaughter intent, and various other powerful techniques, it was still quite difficult to make up for the gap. If the old man was suppressed to the Dualism Realm, then he would have a chance. However, the old man’s cultivation wouldn’t be suppressed here!

Suddenly, the door behind the old man trembled, and then ten old men appeared behind the old man.

Ten Dualism Realm experts!

One Rebirth Realm expert and ten Dualism Realm experts!

Yang Ye nodded, “All of you really do think highly of me!”

“Even a lion gives its all when hunting a rabbit, not to mention that you are no rabbit!” The old man spoke indifferently, “Yang Ye, there was no enmity between you and my Ma Clan, but you insisted on becoming enemies with us. Since that’s the case, my Ma Clan can naturally not allow you to continue existing in this world. After all, if a genius like you is allowed to grow, even my Ma Clan wouldn’t be able to endure your revenge!”

Yang Ye glanced at the old man and the others, “All of you are from the Ma Clan?”

“The War Pavilion!” Meanwhile, two old men stepped forward. One of them said, “Yang Ye, the biggest mistake you made in your life is interfering in the Nether Pavilion’s business. This matter is very complicated. Unless you possess strength that can rival Jian Wuji or the Unfettered One, no one can save you now!”

Yang Ye chuckled and said, “Just the few of you don’t really seem to be enough to kill me!”

The old man in a luxurious robe chuckled, “I know that you definitely have some sort of trump card. Otherwise, you would absolutely not come here. Come, let us see what it is!”

“I too really want to know what it is as well!” That old man from the War Pavilion spoke indifferently, “Since a Semi-Deity like you is able to remain so calm while facing a Rebirth Realm expert and ten Dualism Realm experts, it’s definitely an extraordinary trump card!”

Yang Ye remained silent for a while, and then he nodded, “You’ll find out in a moment!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the Sword God’s Seal suddenly lit up on his forehead.

Boom!

A moment later, a terrifying wave of sword intent surged out from him, and then his aura instantly rose explosively. Two breaths of time later, his sword intent seemed to have arrived at a critical point!

Bang!

An explosion resounded as the space around Yang Ye rippled!

Returnal Rank sword intent!

When facing so many experts and even a Rebirth Realm expert, Quasi Returnal Rank sword intent wasn’t sufficient anymore!

The expressions of everyone here had changed slightly when they saw Yang Ye’s sword intent attain the Returnal Rank, and a trace of seriousness had appeared in their eyes. Because even they didn’t dare look down upon Returnal Rank sword intent!

Even though the old man didn’t reveal a serious expression, there was a trace of caution in his eyes! When the Unfettered One and Jian Wuji roamed unhindered through the large world all those years ago, they’d only possessed Returnal Rank sword intent as well!

However, their cultivation had been higher than Yang Ye. If Yang Ye was at the Dualism Realm… No, even if he was at the Deity Realm, the old man and the others would probably have to stay away from him!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye started walking slowly towards them, “When have I, Yang Ye, ever been afraid of risking my life?”
