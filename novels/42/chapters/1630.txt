Chapter 1631 - The Number One Wargod Through The Ages!

Translator: InVader

Yang Ye gulped, “I can right now?”

“Yes!” The Divine Yin Flame said, “Actually, there are no restrictions to enter the other levels in the pagoda. It’s probably it that intentionally made those levels inaccessible to you.”

Yang Ye naturally understood who the ‘it’ here was, so he asked, “Why?”

The Divine Yin Flame answered, “Because your strength is insufficient. The pagoda contains many things that aren’t from this world. They exceed the scope of this world, and they exceed the understanding of this world as well. You can’t take control or master them without sufficient strength. Just like me. If your body hadn’t grown strong to a certain extent, then you would definitely be obliterated from forcefully utilizing my strength.”

The Divine Yin Flame paused for a moment and continued, “Understand? It isn’t restricting you but protecting you.”

It’s protecting me! Yang Ye fell silent. He didn’t doubt the Divine Yin Flame. Even though the Primordial Pagoda had never conversed with him, he couldn’t deny that it had been always helping him!

Meanwhile, the Divine Yin Flame continued, “It chose you as its master because it has no other choice. But now that it has happened, and you even obtained that person’s acknowledgement, it will only help you and never harm you. However, you have to work hard on growing stronger. Because your current strength isn’t sufficient to truly take control of it, and you can’t help it as well!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Help it? What do you mean?”

The Divine Yin Flame fell silent for a long time before it said, “It was heavily injured when Xiao Qi stole it. So, it has no choice but to attach itself to you and rely on you to recover. I’m sure you’ve noticed that it’s growing stronger as you do. Right?”

Yang Ye nodded. Indeed, the Primordial Pagoda was just a tiny vortex in the beginning. Yet now, it could even suppress Zenith Realm experts. After all, those two Blood Puppets far surpassed ordinary Zenith Realm experts, but they’d been completely suppressed by the Primordial Pagoda.

The Divine Yin Flame said, “Didn’t you want to access the next level? Close your eyes and sense it now. Sense it carefully.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he closed his eyes slowly. Around five breaths of time later, he opened them slowly, “I’ve found it.”

His figure vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

A breath of time later, Yang Ye appeared before a door, and there was a violet gold talisman stuck on the door.

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment, and then he stretched his hand towards it. However, the talisman suddenly floated off the door and stopped in front of Yang Ye.

Creak! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The door before him creaked open slowly.

Yang Ye didn’t go in. He just gazed at the golden talisman in his grasp instead.

Suddenly, an evil aura surged out from within.

Yang Ye’s expression immediately changed. He hurriedly put the talisman away and slammed his right fist forward.

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was blasted almost 10km away, and a wisp of blood immediately seeped out from the corner of his mouth once he stopped his figure.

Yang Ye wiped off the blood and looked up at the door. There was only pitch black darkness, and he couldn’t see anything behind the door.

Is someone in there? Or perhaps a demon beast? Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then his figure flashed and appeared before the pill furnace on the 2nd level. He asked, “What is in there?”

He naturally intended to be cautious. What a joke! Just its aura had injured him, so could it possibly be anything ordinary?

The Divine Yin Flame fell silent for a long time before it replied, “An arm.”

“An arm?” Yang Ye was stunned and asked, “Are you sure?”

The Divine Yin Flame replied, “I am!”

Yang Ye’s face became quite unsightly. Because he’d been injured by just an arm.

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment before he asked in a low voice, “Whose arm?”

“A fellow who was called the Wargod!” The Divine Yin Flame continued, “Actually, he wasn’t just called a Wargod, he was the Wargod. A true Wargod! The number one Wargod through the ages.”

Yang Ye asked, “Then what’s his arm doing here?”

The Divine Yin Flame replied, “He’s dead, that’s why.”

Yang Ye glanced at the Divine Yin Flame and asked, “Even the Wargod can die?”

The Divine Yin Flame replied, “The Wargod isn’t invincible. Moreover, he died in battle. Actually, if he intended to flee, then very few in that world of ours would have been able to kill him. However, he didn’t flee and fought until he took his last breath.”

Yang Ye asked, “What’s his arm doing here?”

The Divine Yin Flame replied, “Master obtained it by chance. Master had intended to refine it into medicinal pills, but some things occurred before he even began. In the end, the Primordial Pagoda was stolen by Xiao Qi…”

Its master! Yang Ye glanced at the Divine Yin Flame. Obviously, the master that the Divine Yin Flame spoke of was the old man in Daoist’s robes!

Meanwhile, the Divine Yin Flame suddenly added, “Do you know why I once told you to come to me after you accessed the 4th level?”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

The Divine Yin Flame answered, “Because you’ll only be able to endure my strength after putting that arm on, and you’ll be able to take me out of here.”

“After I put that arm on?” Yang Ye continued, “Are you sure I can? Are you sure that there won’t be any problems?”

The Divine Yin Flame replied, “There shouldn’t be any serious problems. Because the Wargod’s soul vanished a long time ago. There is no soul within that arm, and only some undying will remains within it. If you can inherit that will, then it’ll be absolutely beneficial to you.”

Yang Ye asked, “Is it powerful?”

“Very powerful!” The Divine Yin Flame spoke in a low voice, “You’re experienced my strength. If you can use that arm, then you’ll be able to fully endure my strength. So, do you think it’s powerful now?”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he turned around and walked away.

Meanwhile, the Divine Yin Flame spoke abruptly, “Where are you going?”

“To change my arm!” Yang Ye spoke excitedly, “Once I change my arm, I’ll attack the Yang Clan. Why would I even need to participate in that fight for the position of successor?!”

The Divine Yin Flame spoke indifferently, “Go on if you want to die!”

Yang Ye’s face froze, “What do you mean?”

The Divine Yin Flame replied, “Your body is still a little too weak. If you try to put that arm on, then it’s very likely that your body won’t be able to endure its strength. So, you must wait for your body to grow stronger before doing that.”

So that’s why! Yang Ye nodded because he did feel that his body was quite weak.

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something and said, “Right, if I want to put that arm on, does it represent that I’ll have to chop off my own arm?”

“No!” The Divine Yin Flame explained, “Master has refined that arm, so only its blood and bones remain. Thus, you just have to change the blood and bones within your arm. Anyway, it’s very simple. You’ll understand when the time comes. As for now, you shouldn’t try yet. Even though your current body is barely able to endure its strength, it’ll be very dangerous. If you fail to endure its strength, then you’ll be finished.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Alright!” Just as the Divine Yin Flame had said, it was best to be safer.

The Divine Yin Flame suddenly said, “Right, didn’t you get a wooden sword?”

“A wooden sword?” Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he recalled the wooden sword, “I did. Why?”

The Divine Yin Flame remained silent for a long time before it said, “That sword isn’t ordinary.”

Yang Ye’s eyes lit up when he heard that. After all, if the Divine Yin Flame called it extraordinary, then the sword was definitely a precious treasure!

As soon as he thought up to this point, Yang Ye quickly bid farewell to the Divine Yin Flame and went to the world in the 1st level.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. He was about to look for the wooden sword when a ray of light suddenly flashed through the sky. Yang Ye looked up and saw a sword flying swiftly through the sky, and a little fellow was on the sword!

It was none other than Snowy!

Yang Ye was about to fly up there when the ray of light suddenly sped up. It grew faster and faster. In less than half a breath of time, the entire sky was actually filled with rays of light. There wasn’t even a gap!

It was caused by the extreme speed that the sword was traveling at!

A solemn expression instantly covered Yang Ye’s face. Because he couldn’t accomplish that. Or it should be said that his speed wasn’t sufficient to accomplish that.

Suddenly, a ray of light flashed, and then a sword appeared before him. It was the wooden sword. Moreover, Snowy was standing on it while excitement covered her chubby face.

Snowy waved at Yang Ye. Obviously, she was telling him to get on.

Yang Ye grinned and was about to get on the sword. However, the wooden sword suddenly shook violently, and then a ray of light flashed.

Boom!

An explosion resounded while Yang Ye’s figure was blasted 3km away!

Yang Ye glanced at his chest. At this moment, there was a very long gash on his chest. It was extremely deep and almost reached his internal organs. If he hadn’t reacted quickly, he may have been sliced into two!

Yang Ye looked up at the wooden sword. Suddenly, it shot forward like a bolt of lightning. Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched at the sight of this, and he was about to flash away from there. However, the wooden sword suddenly stopped moving. It was because Snowy was holding tightly onto its hilt with both her claws!

Meanwhile, Zi’er appeared by Yang Ye’s side. She glanced at the injury on his chest and spoke softly, “Are you alright?”

Yang Ye shook his head, and then he gazed at the wooden sword, “What the heck is it doing?”

Zi’er shook her head and replied, “I don’t know. All I know is that it only lets Snowy touch it…”

Yang Ye gazed at Snowy. At this moment, Snowy seemed to be saying something, and the sword gradually calmed down.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Snowy, move aside.”

Snowy gazed at Yang Ye, and then she blinked. Even though she didn’t know what Yang Ye intended to do, she still shot over to Zi’er’s shoulder.

Yang Ye started walking slowly towards the wooden sword. A moment later, a wave of terrifying intent surged out from him, and it swept towards the wooden sword.

Slaughter Sword Intent!

He intended to use Slaughter Sword Intent to suppress the sword!

Meanwhile, the wooden sword shook slightly.

Boom!

A sword howl resounded, and then a ray of light flashed like a bolt of lightning.

Hiss!

Yang Ye watched with astonishment as his Slaughter Sword Intent was split into two, and then the wooden sword arrived less than a meter away from him.

Yang Ye was astounded. He issued a command in his heart, and a ray of blood red light flashed as a Blood Puppet moved in front of him.

Boom!

Hiss!

A moment later, two figures were blasted away like cannonballs. At the same time, a blood red arm appeared in the sky, and then it slowly descended to the ground.
