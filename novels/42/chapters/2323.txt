Chapter 2324 – Just Kill!

“He has other loved ones!” Meanwhile, Jian You spoke solemnly, “Have you thought about them?”

Loved ones!

Bai Zhixian’s figure stiffened.

Jian You lowered her sword and moved aside. She said, “You must understand that he can’t be like this forever. This is never really him. Moreover, if he recovers his consciousness in the future and knows that you stopped me today, What would he do then?”

Bai Zhixian fell silent.

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared in front of Jian You, and then he swung Invincible at her.

Space was slashed open beneath it!

Jian You didn’t fear it at all, and she suddenly drew the huge sword on her back and swung it.

The saber and sword collided!

Bang!

The ground collapsed!

Meanwhile, Jian You relaxed her grip, and then she placed her right hand on her waist and moved slightly. A ray of sword energy instantly arrived before Yang Ye’s chest.

It was swift like a bolt of lightning!

Right at this instant, Jian You’s expression changed slightly, and she twisted her right foot against the ground.

Hiss!

An afterimage appeared over 100m away!

It was Jian You!

She looked down at her stomach, and there was a faint mark there. Meanwhile, a saber that flickered between being visible and invisible was in Yang Ye’s grasp, but there was a hole in his chest!

Jian You’s sword had pierced through his body with ease!

Jian You looked up at Yang Ye, “Looks like you obtained quite a few fortuitous encounters in the Eternal Secret Realm!”

Yang Ye was about to attack, but Bai Zhixian suddenly said, “That’s enough!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she walked over to him and smiled, “I was too greedy. She’s right, you can’t stay like this. You have so much to do!”

She gazed at Jian You and continued, “I apologize for what happened earlier!”

Jian You put her sword away, and then she walked over to Yang Ye. She sized up Yang Ye and said, “His madness intent has been suppressed, and that is a good thing for us. However, he must cooperate. So long as he does, his sword intent will be able to rise to the True Dao Realm, and only then will he be able to use the sword intent to revive his consciousness and regain his consciousness completely!”

Bai Zhixian nodded, and then she gazed at Yang Ye. She walked over to him, slowly held his face, and she seemed to be slightly transfixed as she gazed at him.

The scenes of the past flashed incessantly through her mind.

A long time passed before she grinned, “Let’s begin!”

Jian You nodded, walked over to Yang Ye, and placed her right hand on his forehead.

Bang!

A powerful strand of sword energy suddenly surged into Yang Ye, and then Yang Ye’s eyes instantly opened wide.

It didn’t take long for a strand of powerful intent to charge out of Yang Ye’s body, the madness intent! Once it appeared, Jian You’s sword intent was obstructed, and the madness intent was even madly attacking her sword intent!

Jian You suddenly said, “Tell him to summon his sword intent!”

Bai Zhixian nodded and gazed at Yang Ye, “Sword intent, summon your sword intent!”

Sword intent!

Yang Ye’s body suddenly shook violently, and his sword intent that had been suppressed deep within his body by the madness intent abruptly started to move. The madness intent immediately grew agitated upon sensing this.

Bang!

A wave of powerful madness intent slammed down at Jian You!

It wanted to kill her!

Jian You frowned slightly and tapped her finger lightly, causing a ray of sword energy to flash.

Hiss!

The madness intent was instantly sliced open.

It was just a form of intent, and without Yang Ye’s support, its strength was limited. Now, it could be said that Yang Ye and Jian You were jointly suppressing it!

Sword intent gradually appeared around Yang Ye as they jointly suppressed the madness intent. It was faint, but it was there!

However, Invincible suddenly shook violently, and then countless vengeful spirits surged out, and they swiftly charged at Yang Ye.

Jian You’s eyes narrowed slightly, and she swung her sword. It instantly blasted the vengeful spirits away, but it only took a moment for them to charge at Yang Ye once more. Moreover, Yang Ye’s body had started to tremble even more.

Jian You frowned at the sight of this, and she gazed at Bai Zhixian, “You deal with them!”

Bai Zhixian nodded, and then she charged at the vengeful spirits. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Bang!

However, she was immediately pushed back. The vengeful spirits were about to attack again when Yang Ye suddenly waved his right hand, and all of them immediately appeared before his palm. However, he didn’t absorb them, and he clenched his fist and swung a punch instead.

Bang!

The vengeful spirits were blasted away, and sorrowful howls resounded incessantly.

At this moment, the vengeful spirits didn’t dare to charge at Yang Ye anymore, but they didn’t leave either. They just roamed silently nearby.

At this moment, they seemed to have understood who was the true master!

Without the vengeful spirits to help it, the madness intent was instantly anxious.

It didn’t continue attacking Jian You, and it surged back into Yang Ye’s body and started to affect Yang Ye’s mind! However, Yang Ye’s sword intent was growing stronger and stronger!

Coupled with Bai Zhixian’s presence, he wasn’t affected by the madness intent!

Everything was developing towards a good outcome, but Jian You’s face gradually changed. It was because the madness intent had started to run wild!

Yang Ye wasn’t able to fully suppress it. After all, he hadn’t regained full clarity of his mind yet.

Yang Ye frowned while he seemed visibly in pain.

Bai Zhixian was shocked by this scene and was about to speak, but the madness intent suddenly started igniting itself!

Bai Zhixian was horrified and hurriedly said, “Stop!”

Jian You’s expression had changed slightly as well. She hadn’t expected the madness intent to ignite itself!

If it ignited itself, then Yang Ye would have to pay the biggest price. Obviously, it had chosen to take everyone down with it!

A moment of silence ensued, and then Jian You was about to stop. However, her hand suddenly trembled, and then she gazed at Yang Ye while a wisp of surprise flashed through his eyes, “What..?”

Bang!

A ray of red light surged out from Yang Ye!

Slaughter intent!

Once the slaughter intent surged up into the air, a strand of sword intent struggled free of the madness intent’s suppression and surged out of Yang Ye as well.

Bai Zhixian and Jian You watched with astonishment as the two intents pounced at the madness intent! At this moment, Yang Ye’s sword intent had risen to the True Dao Realm with Jian You’s help, so when it joined forces with his slaughter intent and pounced at the madness intent, the madness intent was instantly in trouble!

The slaughter intent and sword intent had been enemies before this, irreconcilable enemies, and they’d fought each other for a long time. But at this moment, they’d actually joined forces! It was obvious how much they hated the madness intent!

The madness intent had sealed them up for so long, so how could they just let it go?

Just like that, the two of them watched with astonishment as the slaughter intent and sword intent suppressed the madness intent into Yang Ye’s body!

Yang Ye’s body gradually stopped trembling.

Jian You withdrew her hand and gazed at Yang Ye. Bai Zhixian was looking at him too.

Yang Ye’s eyes were closed tight, and his body was trembling lesser and lesser. Just like that, a long time passed before he finally calmed down completely. At the same time, the slaughter intent and sword intent returned into his body.

They’d returned within him!

Bai Zhixian’s hands were clenched tight. She’d allowed Yang Ye to recover his consciousness, but she had never thought about how she would face Yang Ye once that happened. After all, they had been enemies before Yang Ye lost consciousness!

Bai Zhixian and Jian You watched as Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes.

Bai Zhixian stared at him. At this moment, she felt like her heart was on the verge of jumping out of her chest.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye closed his eyes again, fell silent for a short while, and then turned around and walked away.

Bai Zhixian couldn’t help but call out to him, “Yang Ye!”

Yang Ye stopped, “She’s dead. I’m sorry for being unable to engage in any intimacy at a time like this. Wait for me!”

Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

Bai Zhixian suddenly started laughing. It wasn’t laughter of despair, it was heartfelt happiness.

Jian You gazed at her and felt quite a bit of confusion.

Bai Zhixian looked up at the sky and spoke softly, “That’s what a man should be like… The man I like…”

At this moment, Jian You finally seemed to understand a little.

If a man could be heartless to another woman, it represented that he was very likely to be capable of being heartless to you.

Jian You glanced at her and said, “Come back to the Sword Ruins with me!”

Bai Zhixian asked, “Why?”

She replied softly, “The Immortal Estate may act against you, and use you against him!”

Bai Zhixian hesitated for a moment and nodded.

Just like that, they went to the Sword Ruins.

Meanwhile, Snowy was the first to appear before Jian You, and then it was Sword Scroll, Su Qingshi, and the others.

As soon as she saw Snowy, Wang Erya’s eyes lit up, and then she kept sizing up Snowy with curiosity. Meanwhile, the small Primal Demon started walking slowly in Snowy’s direction.

However, Snowy ignored both of them, flew over to Jian You, and started waving her claws.

Jian You glanced at Snowy and said, “He has recovered.”

Snowy’s eyes lit up, and then she hugged Jian You and kissed her.

Jian You was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, Snowy patted the Sword Gourd, and then they transformed into a ray of sword energy that shot into the sky.

Sword Scroll hurriedly followed after Snowy. Meanwhile, Wang Erya and the small Primal Demon quickly followed them as well.

Zi’er was about to stop them, but Jian You spoke softly, “There’s no need to worry. Even a True World Realm expert won’t be able to do anything to her while that young girl and small ox demon are with her! Moreover, he may need their help! The six clans have existed for so many years, so they definitely have their own trump cards.”

Zi’er hesitated for a moment and nodded.

…

The Shiyuan Clan. Initial City.

Suddenly, a man with a large saber on his back appeared near the city.

He had an emotionless expression on his face as he walked slowly toward the city.

Meanwhile, Shiyuan Xing appeared on the city walls and stared at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, you…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye drew the saber on his back and looked up at Shiyuan Xing, “I’m not here to speak about anything today. I’m just here to kill! Kill until there’s no one left in Initial City!”
