Chapter 1449 – Even Deities Are Trash!

How did Yang Ye feel right now?

Horrified!

The hairs throughout his body were standing on end, and he had quite an unsightly expression on his face. Not only had someone noticed him, that person had arrived behind him without making a single sound.

Calm down!

Yang Ye circulated his sword intent to force himself to calm down, and then he turned around. However, there was nothing behind him.

Nothing at all!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He naturally wouldn’t think that he was hallucinating. If he couldn’t even differentiate between a hallucination and reality, then how could he even call himself a sword cultivator?

That hand had appeared on his shoulder, but it was gone now. In other words, that person had concealed himself or herself.

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then he turned around and continued forward.

He didn’t know who it was, but he knew that the person would definitely appear once more. However, right after he turned around, that hand suddenly appeared on his shoulder again.

Yang Ye turned around and swung his sword.

Hiss!

His attack hit nothing.

There was nothing in front of Yang Ye!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly while seriousness filled them. This wasn’t just strange; it was quite horrifying! He didn’t believe that anyone in the lower dimensions was capable of being so fast that he couldn’t even react.

How is that person doing it? It didn’t take long for Yang Ye’s expression to change. He’d thought of something. What if that person doesn’t just touch my shoulder but attacks instead?

After all, he’d only sensed that person’s presence after the hand touched his shoulder and not when that person appeared behind him. So, the difference was huge. Because it represented that if that person wanted to kill him, then he might have only sensed that person’s presence at the same instant that he died!

Besides that, that person was actually able to notice his presence!

After all, he was using the Laws of Darkness and the Sword Domain to conceal himself. It could be said that if he stood here without moving, then even a Deity wouldn’t be able to notice his presence!

Yet now, that mysterious person hidden in the shadows had noticed his presence.

Yang Ye remained silent on the spot for a long time, and then he turned around and continued forward.

He’d just turned around when the hand appeared on his shoulder again.

Yang Ye stopped, but he didn’t turn around. He just turned his head slightly to glance at the hand. It was slender and slightly pale, but its nails were bright red. Obviously, it belonged to a woman.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Big Sister, I’m just passing through and have no intention to offend you.”

Yang Ye received no answer, but the hand was still on his shoulder.

Yang Ye turned around, but when he did, there was nothing behind him!

Yang Ye’s face darkened, “Do you think this is fun?”

He still received no answer.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he turned around and continued walking towards the distance. This time, the hand didn’t appear on him again. However, Yang Ye knew that woman was definitely somewhere close. But since that woman had no intention to kill him, he couldn’t be bothered to pay attention to her.

Of course, the main reason was that he was helpless against her.

Actually, he could detect her, but he didn’t do it. She clearly didn’t want him to see her, so if he really did make her visible to him, then it might cause some undesirable consequences. Moreover, using that method was very risky, so he didn’t dare to use it rashly.

The method was naturally the Sword Domain. He just had to activate it and the woman would definitely be unable to hide.

However, if she suddenly attacked while enveloped beneath the Sword Domain, then he would be finished if her strength surpassed the scope of the Sword Domain. After all, he only had over two months of lifespan left.

Even though he knew that woman was watching him from the shadows, he didn’t pay any attention to her and just continued forward.

Actually, under normal circumstances, it would take around five or six hours for him to get to the Forest of Darkness, but he wasn’t under normal circumstances right now. If he flew right now, it would be like painting a huge target on his back. He didn’t want to become someone’s punching bag, so he had no choice but to walk.

According to Yang Ye’s estimations, he was around a day away from the Forest of Darkness.

It could be said that it was just a short distance away, but Yang Ye felt like it was extremely far away.

After all, getting there safely was a huge problem!

The further he went, the more solemn Yang Ye’s expression grew.

It was silent!

Too silent!

Since that mysterious hand appeared on his shoulder, it had been too silent. There wasn’t a shred of noise coming from the surroundings. Not only was there no noise, he hadn’t even heard the slightest sound of the wind. It was like he’d walked into the void.

Suddenly, Yang Ye stopped moving because the ground beneath his feet had vanished.

Yang Ye remained silent for an instant, and then he stretched his right hand forward before spinning it slightly. A strand of energy immediately surged out, and then the miasma before him was instantly blasted backwards, allowing him to see the scene before him.

An abyss was before him, a bottomless abyss, and it was filled with miasma. As for the area on the other side of the abyss, it was a mountain which extended beyond the scope of his vision.

Yang Ye sized up the surroundings. It didn’t take long for his gaze to descend to a spot not too far away from him. There was a rope bridge there, and it led to the mountain.

Yang Ye was about to head over through the rope bridge when an ethereal figure suddenly appeared on the rope bridge.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly while his profound energy immediately started to circulate.

Based on the ethereal figure’s body, Yang Ye discerned that it belonged to a man. So, it was clearly not the owner of that hand from before.

Suddenly, the ethereal figure spoke, “I can’t remember how many years have passed. Someone has finally come here.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Yang Ye asked, “You’re human?”

“Of course!” The ethereal figure fell silent for a while, and then it continued, “The Voider Realm? How could you have possibly been able to get here? Oh? No wonder.... You possess two types of Quasi Returnal Rank intents.... No wonder!”

Yang Ye asked, “Who are you?”

“I know you’re very curious!” The ethereal figure continued, “After all, anyone would be curious upon meeting a human here. I’m from the large world.”

The large world! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly while a trace of surprise flashed through them. He hadn’t expected the ethereal figure to be someone who’d come down here from the large world.

Yang Ye sized up the ethereal figure and asked, “You’re in spirit form?”

The ethereal figure nodded slightly, “I know what else you wish to know, so I’ll tell you in one go. The people of the lower dimensions are curious about this place, and the people of my large world are the same. So, we decided to come down here and have a look. We intended to find out exactly what the Ominous Territory was. I’m one of the two who were sent down here.”

The ethereal figure fell silent for a long time, and then he continued, “This place exceeded our expectations, and both of us overestimated our strength. In the end, he died, and only a strand of my soul remains.”

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then he asked, “Senior, may I know what realm of cultivation both of you were at?”

The ethereal figure answered, “The Deity Realm!”

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief when he heard this. It was very normal that a Deity would die here. After all, this place was so dangerous.

However, the ethereal figure suddenly added, “We were Deities here, but we weren’t Deities in the large world!”

Yang Ye’s face stiffened. They weren’t Deities! They were experts that surpassed the Deity Realm!

They were Deities here because their cultivations had been suppressed. Even though their cultivations had been suppressed, they were still experts above the Deity Realm. However, both of them had perished here.

Yang Ye gulped and asked, “May I ask if you fell on the other side of the Yellow Springs River or on this side?”

Yang Ye couldn’t help but clench his fists once he finished asking the question.

The ethereal figure replied, “This side!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath when he heard this. It wouldn’t be a big deal if the ethereal figure had perished on the other side of Yellow Springs River, and the situation wouldn’t be that bad. After all, he wasn’t going to the other side. However, the ethereal figure had died without even passing the Yellow Springs River.

At this moment, Yang Ye really missed someone.

Blind Maiden!

If he had the chance to meet her, he would definitely say — Third Sister, please take me to the Forest of Darkness!

Actually, it was no joke. If he could contact her, he would definitely seek her help. Now, he finally understood that this place was actually not a place that he could stay in. The dangers of this place had far surpassed the scope of his strength.

Perhaps only an expert at Blind Maiden’s level could stay in this place.

Meanwhile, the ethereal figure spoke, “I wish to seek your help!”

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at the ethereal figure, “What do you need?”

As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, a spatial ring flew over to him, “I’m from the Kong Clan in the large world. If you head there in the future, then please pass that spatial ring to the current patriarch of the Kong Clan. He will repay you for it.”

Yang Ye glanced at the spatial ring in his grasp and asked, “Aren’t you afraid that I would take it for myself?”

The ethereal figure replied, “Do I have a choice?”

Yang Ye smiled, “True.”

After all, he’d finally met someone after so long, so he had no choice but to choose Yang Ye.

Yang Ye put the spatial ring away and asked, “Senior, have you been to the Forest of Darkness?”

“The Forest of Darkness?” The ethereal figure asked, “You intend to go there?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Yes.”

The ethereal figure said, “Forget it!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

“Because you won’t be able to get there.” The ethereal figure spoke frankly, “Even though you’re just a Voider, I know that you’re definitely extremely strong and have surpassed the strength of ordinary Deities. However, you must realize that Deities are trash here. So head back.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the ethereal figure grew fainter.

Yang Ye remained silent on the spot.

Even Deities are trash!

That was no joke.

Deities really were trash here!

Yet this was only the outer area!

Why does the lower dimensions have such a terrifying place like the Ominous Territory?

A long time passed before Yang Ye took a deep breath and looked at the mountain on the opposite side of the abyss. Should I continue forward and turn back?

Actually, he had no choice but to go forward.

If his lifespan wasn’t a problem, then he would definitely not take such risks here. However, he had to head to the Forest of Darkness. He would have a chance to live if he went there; but he might lose that chance to live if he didn’t head there.

Suddenly, the vanishing ethereal figure cried out involuntarily with shock, “What’s she doing with you? She.... Run! She....”

Suddenly, a gust of wind swept by, and then the ethereal figure’s voice stopped abruptly.

Moreover, the ethereal figure had vanished in an instant as well!
