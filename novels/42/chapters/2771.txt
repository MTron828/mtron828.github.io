Chapter 2772 – Omni Ruin!

However, she only took a few steps before stopping abruptly.

She shook her head and smiled, “You’re not at your prime yet. Killing you now would be too boring. I’ll wait a while longer!”

She returned above the clouds once she finished speaking.

In the starry sky, Erya looked up with bewilderment on her face.

Her memories had recovered slightly, but she had some other memories too.

These memories made her feel uneasy, and she had an obsession in her heart.

It was a very, very deep obsession!

She felt that she had to do some things, like killing the woman above the clouds!

Erya moved her gaze away and looked ahead. Shu Wubian had vanished, and there were only some shattered branches there.

Erya relaxed her fist and walked off into the distance.

She was all alone.

…

At a certain point in outer space, the battle here was exceptionally intense!

Four women and four demon beasts!

They’d been fighting for many days and nights!

Bang!

Suddenly, a figure was blasted backward repeatedly, and that figure was pushed all the way out of the battlefield.

It was Qi Bitian!

She was the weakest among the four right now. Because she hadn’t recovered her full strength.

Qi Bitian wiped off the blood on the corner of her mouth and grinned, “This is fun! Haha!”

She was still laughing when a figure appeared above the beast, and then a huge claw slammed down upon it!

Sky Claw!

Bang!

The demon beast was blasted down from midair!

But just a moment later, it looked up and howled with fury. After that, its figure spun, and then it slammed itself at Qi Bitian!

Suddenly, Qi Bitian raised both her hands and closed her eyes slowly. Space warped between her palms.

“Mortal Destruction!” A soft shout resounded, and then a pair of palms descended onto the beast.

A head-on collision!

Boom!

The beast was blasted away.

Meanwhile, Qi Bitian took a step forward.

Hiss!

The space in front of her cracked open, and it was cracking rapidly. In just an instant, the cracks had arrived before the demon beast that had been blasted away.

Meanwhile, a figure soundlessly appeared.

It was Qi Bitian!

Boom!

It seemed as if Qi Bitian just stood there, but the demon beast was blasted away again!

Suppression!

Meanwhile, Tu and the others had suppressed the rest of the demon beasts.

A man was watching the battle from somewhere higher up in space.

He was exceptionally tall and huge. He looked human, but he was many times larger than a human. Besides that, his entire body was extremely smooth like a mirror. It wasn’t due to an armor, and it was his body that was like that.

Besides that, his features were somewhat indistinct and very different from ordinary humans.

The man held an extremely long pike in his grasp while watching Qi Bitian and the others!

A long time passed before he suddenly turned around and fell to one knee in a certain direction, “Master, shall I attack?”

A short while later, a voice came from the space before him, “You are no match for them either. I’ll get others to keep them busy. Your goal is Yang Ye and the Three Dimensional Universe. Cang Mo, remember that while Yang Ye’s strength is inferior to you, you must not underestimate him or be careless!”

Cang Mo stood up slowly, “I will definitely take Yang Ye’s head!”

He turned around and left.

“Wait!” Suddenly, the voice resounded, “Take the 12 Demon Guard!”

Cang Mo shook his head, “I alone am enough!”

The voice replied, “I’ve told you not to underestimate him. Didn’t you hear me?”

Cang Mo bowed slightly, “Forgive me!”

Meanwhile, 12 ethereal figures with pikes in their grasps appeared behind Cang Mo. There were men and women among them, and all of them were only slightly smaller in size to Cang Mo.

Cang Mo bowed slightly and left with them.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The area fell silent once more.

Meanwhile, the battle down below was still going on.

Suddenly, a figure flashed by. A moment later, Yang Busy and the others looked to the side, and their faces practically simultaneously turned solemn!

“It’s a clone of the Four Dimensional Lord.” Tu spoke abruptly.

A clone!

Yang Busy glanced at Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu, “Who’s going to deal with him!”

“I will!” Qi Bitian charged over once she finished speaking.

Boom!

A rumbling explosion resounded through the area.

Yang Busi moved her gaze away and looked at Tian Xiu, “Deal with these bastards quickly!”

Tian Xiu nodded, and then she formed a strange seal before her, “Omni Ruin…”

…

In the starry sky, Yang Ye stopped. He wasn’t very far away from the Three Dimensional Universe, and he could still see it if he looked back.

In the end, he decided to stay here.

Because anyone coming to the Three Dimensional Universe would have to get through him!

Yang Ye placed a chair here in the starry sky, and then he sat on it. A sword floated by his side while a sword gourd was hanging by his waist.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Snowy had gathered all the demons at the Ascension Platform.

Snowy pointed at the Primal True Dragon and the others, and then she started waving her paws swiftly.

All of them just gazed at Yang Ye. Of course, they didn’t know what she was saying because she was waving her paws too quickly. But that didn’t affect them. Because they just had to do as Snowy said later.

Grow stronger!

What Snowy said was actually very simple. She wanted to help them grow stronger, so strong that they could help Yang Ye in battle!

Presently, the Primal True Dragon and the others weren’t able to keep up with Yang Ye at all. If they didn’t improve, they could only be kept like pets.

Snowy didn’t want that. Actually, the Primal True Dragon and the others didn’t want that either!

But it couldn’t be helped when Yang Ye, Erya, An Nanjing, and Snowy were just too fast!

They couldn’t keep up!

If they could, they wanted to join the battles too. All of them were ancient demons who were filled with the desire to fight!

Just like that, Snowy stopped refining treasures and helped the demon beasts instead. Besides that, she fostered the Worldborn Fruit and Chaotic Fruit trees. They were huge trees now and were covered in fruits!

The demon beasts had an endless supply of these fruits now!

If cultivation wasn’t enough, divine treasures could push their cultivations higher!

That was Snowy’s strategy!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye sat there on the chair. He was very well aware that the Four Dimensional Universe wouldn’t just give up, nor would the mysterious expert or Destiny!

He had no other choice but to fight until the end!

Suddenly, the space in the distance started to tremble.

Yang Ye looked up with indifference.

The trembling grew stronger. Obviously, something was approaching.

A moment later, the space here started rippling like boiling water.

Meanwhile, Snowy appeared on Yang Ye’s shoulder. He rubbed her head gently and tossed her back into the Primordial Pagoda.

This wasn’t a battle she could interfere in!

In the Primordial Pagoda, Snowy laid there on the Ascension Platform with a helpless expression on her face as she looked up into the air.

She felt that she was very strong!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye gazed forward indifferently. A short while later, over a dozen figures appeared before him, and they were led by Cang Mo. All of them were peak Destiny Realm experts, and the expert who led the group felt a little unfathomable!

Cang Mu and the others stopped 30m away from Yang Ye.

Over a dozen divine senses and auras locked onto Yang Ye, but Yang Ye wasn’t affected by them at all!

Cang Mo sized up Yang Ye, “You’re Yang Ye?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Why? Do you know me?”

Cang Mo replied, “I don’t, nor am I interested in getting to know you!”

Yang Ye grinned, “Then why did you even ask?”

Cang Mo raised his right hand to tell the others to step back.

They were clearly quite hesitant.

Cang Mo glanced coldly at them. They didn’t dare to disobey him and retreated.

Cang Mo gazed at Yang Ye again. He was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly drew his sword and dashed forward. Yang Ye was so fast that he instantly arrived before Cang Mo, and then he slammed his sword down!

Cang Mo raised his pike to defend himself.

Boom!

The space here shook and cracked open!

After he stopped Yang Ye’s attack, Cang Mo swung a punch at Yang Ye’s head with his other hand.

Heavenshield soundlessly appeared on Yang Ye’s right arm, and he swept it toward Cang Mo’s fist!

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and Yang Ye had returned to his chair. But just a moment later, a ray of sword energy flashed.

“Slash!” As soon as Yang Ye shouted with fury, a ray of sword energy slashed down from above Cang Mo!

Cang Mo spun rapidly while sweeping his pike at Yang Ye.

Bang!

Yang Ye was swept back to where he’d come from, but a sword shot through Cang Mo’s chest!

Burial!

That was Yang Ye’s true lethal attack!

Cang Mo looked down at his chest. There was a hole there. He’d defended himself against Yang Ye’s first attack, but he’d failed to defend himself against the flying sword!

The flying sword had pierced his body with ease!

The Sword Gourd trembled by Yang Ye’s waist, and then a sword shot into it.

Yang Ye looked up at Cang Mo. While Burial had pierced through him, Cang Mo seemed to be completely fine!

Cang Mo said, “You must be very curious, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “A little!”

Cang Mo replied, “Because our physique isn’t the same as lowly creatures like all of you!”

“Lowly creatures?” Yang Ye was stunned, and then he roared with laughter. He pointed upward and said, “If your Four Dimensional Universe is that great, would you have been suppressed by a woman and remained afraid of showing yourselves for thousands of years? If you really are that amazing, then go on! Go kill her!”
