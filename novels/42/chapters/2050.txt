Chapter 2051 – Of Course!

Zhong Ye gazed at Yang Ye too.

Everyone watched as Yang Ye looked up into the sky and smiled, “Progenitor, my presence in the Weapon Path doesn’t make a difference. But even then, before I leave, I still would like to say something. Does fairness exist in the Weapon Path?”

A long moment of silence ensued before a voice came from above, “Go on!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Why didn’t you show yourself when the Prediction Line tried to kill me? Yet now, when we the Slaughter Line want to kill them, you’ve shown yourself and want us to stop just like that. Progenitor, do you think it’s fair?”

Young Martial Uncle remained silent.

The others remained silent too. They were silent because they didn’t dare to interject.

Suddenly, Yang Ye added, “Even if I become the Seal Master, only others are allowed to attack me, but I can’t attack anyone in the Weapon Path. So, what’s the point? As far as I’m concerned, it’s pointless. Of course, these are my own complaints. In any case, the Weapon Path would still be the Weapon Path without me.”

He cupped his fist at Zhong Ye and continued, “Senior Zhong Ye, it’s not that I refuse to complete our agreement, but I’m unable to do so. You said that if someone in the Weapon Path dared to bully me, then you would bully them. Yet now, that Half-Step Sage from before is still alive and well. I’m not blaming you, I just feel that if I stay, I wouldn’t know it before I die one day. Farewell!”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away.

He didn’t hesitate at all.

Suddenly, Zhong Ye said, “Wait!”

Yang Ye stopped, and then he gazed at Zhong Ye. Zhong Ye looked up at the sky, “Ancestor, when my Slaughter Line was annihilated, you weren’t in this universe, so I don’t blame you. As for when you stopped me from taking revenge, it was to prevent the Weapon Path from engaging in internal strife, so I don’t blame you too. However, now that I want to rebuild the Slaughter Line, the Prediction Line still refuses to leave us alone. But when I’ve acted again, you’re stopping me once more. Since that’s the case, why keep my Slaughter Line?”

He bowed towards the sky, “As that kid, Yang Ye, said, my presence in the Weapon Path doesn’t make a difference. The Weapon Path will still be the Weapon Path without us.”

He suddenly looked at Han Xian and continued, “From this moment onward, I cease to be a member of the Weapon Path, and I won’t stay in the Weapon Dimension. However, if I encounter you or anyone from the Prediction Line outside of the Weapon Dimension, then I will kill you even if I have to chase you to the ends of the world!”

Everyone from the Prediction Line had an extremely unsightly expression on their faces.

Zhong Ye’s strength was so terrifying. So, if their ancestor wasn’t there to keep him in check, then not to mention the Prediction Line, even the four clans would probably be unable to endure his revenge.

Meanwhile, Zhong Ye gazed at Yang Ye, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye wanted to say something, but Zhong Ye shook his head, “Forget it. It’s aggrieving for me to stay here too. It can’t be helped, our fists aren’t large enough. Let’s go!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand and intended to take Yang Ye with him.

Suddenly, their expressions changed slightly because the scene before them was changing rapidly.

Yang Ye was about to act when Zhong Ye’s voice resounded in his mind, “Don’t resist.”

Yang Ye immediately stopped.

A long time passed before the scene in front of them calmed down. At this moment, they were high above in the clouds. It wasn’t the clouds of the Weapon Dimension. There was an old man with shoulder-length hair seated cross-legged deep within the clouds.

The old man’s figure was only faintly visible, and Yang Ye couldn’t see his appearance at all.

However, Yang Ye had guessed the old man’s identity. It was the Weapon Path’s ancestor.

“Both of you are resentful!” The Weapon Progenitor suddenly said, “Of course I’m aware that it’s quite unfair to both of you. But what do you expect from me? If I stand on your side, then based on your character, both of you would destroy the entire Weapon Path, right?”

They fell silent.

Meanwhile, the Weapon Progenitor added, “Little Ye, you should be very well aware that the Weapon Path can’t endure more internal strife. Because a new era is coming, and not only will the god race appear once more; some other prehistoric races may show themselves too. We aren’t in the same era from the past where everyone was united. All the clans and races govern themselves. If we engage in internal strife, then countless lives in the Weapon Dimension and even my own may be lost. This is no exaggeration!”

Zhong Ye spoke in a low voice, “Ancestor, then why did you allow Han Xian to annihilate my Slaughter Line!”

“That was an oversight of mine!” The Weapon Progenitor explained, “However, do you know why the other lines didn’t interfere when the Prediction Line wanted to annihilate your Slaughter Line? You know a part of the reason, but you don’t know the true reason. The Slaughter Line’s desire for slaughter was too strong. Your disciples looked down on everyone, and they treated themselves as the leader of all lines in the Weapon Path. Your senior brother wasn’t able to manage this well!”

The Weapon Progenitor shook his head, “I did try to warm him, and I did try to stop it. However, he didn’t truly take it seriously. When I went to the ends of space with the progenitors of the Dao Path, Buddhist Path, and Confucianist Path in search of that thing, all those years ago. Han Xian grabbed the opportunity this created and annihilated the Slaughter Line. I never expected that either.”

Zhong Ye spoke in a low voice, “Then why didn’t you punish him?”

The Weapon Progenitor asked, “Is 500 years of imprisonment not enough?”

Zhong Ye frowned slightly. Because he didn’t know about it.

The Weapon Progenitor explained, “I didn’t announce it, so that the Prediction Line wouldn’t be without a leader and get pressured by the other lines.”

The Weapon Progenitor suddenly gazed at Yang Ye at this point, “In the beginning, I thought you just selected him for fun to look for trouble with the Prediction Line. So, I didn’t give him the real Weapon Seal. But I never imagined you to be serious, and I never expected the person you chose to be someone so extraordinary.”

Zhong Ye replied, “I went to the Dead Dimension to try my luck, and it just so happened that I met him.”

The Weapon Progenitor nodded and gazed at Yang Ye, “If I’m not wrong, you have the Dao Path’s inheritance too, right?”

Yang Ye nodded. He didn’t lie about it because playing tricks before a person like this was undoubtedly foolish.

The Weapon Progenitor asked, “What’s your name in the Dao Path?”

Yang Ye told the truth, “The Ninth Sword!”

“The Ninth Sword…” The Weapon Progenitor spoke softly, “Looks like the Dao Progenitor is serious too!”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “Why were you willing to let me join the Weapon Path when I’m from the Dao Path?”

The Weapon Progenitor smiled, “Firstly, there’s a slight connection between my Weapon Path and the Dao Path. While we aren’t allies, our relationship isn’t bad. Secondly, why can’t someone hold the inheritances of two paths?”

Yang Ye asked, “What if the Dao Path and Weapon Path get into battle. Aren’t you afraid that I would help the Dao Path?”

The Weapon Progenitor grinned, “Why should I think like that? As far as I’m concerned, if such a day comes and you side with my Weapon Path, then wouldn’t we gain another powerful expert’s support?”

Yang Ye glanced at the Weapon Progenitor, “I admire your optimism!”

His admiration came from the heart. Many people, including himself, would think negatively at most times. It wasn’t that negative thoughts were bad, it just meant that a person would be comparatively lonely as a result of it.

The Weapon Progenitor sized up Yang Ye and said, “Since both of you are being so serious, then I have to be serious too.” He flicked a golden seal over to Yang Ye, “It’s the true Weapon Seal of the Slaughter Line, and it’s ranked at the 3rd amongst the seals of all six lines. It contains a technique that’s perfect for you.”

Zhong Ye added, “Very perfect!”

Yang Ye glanced at it, and then he said, “I’m not someone who acts insensibly, and I understand the kindness you’re showing me. However, if I stay in the Weapon Path and represent the Slaughter Line, the Prediction Line and the other lines will definitely try to scheme against me. I’m not afraid of that; I’m afraid that if they attack and I fight back, then you don’t allow me to again. If only they can attack me, but I can’t fight back, it’s too aggrieving and against both my Sword Dao and Heart.”

Zhong Ye’s lips twitched. He wanted to say something, but he didn’t say anything in the end.

The Weapon Progenitor suddenly said, “You don’t have to worry. Possessing that represents that you have my acknowledgment, so the other lines won’t look for trouble with you. At the very least, they won’t do so openly. Moreover, after what Zhong Ye did, they will be even more afraid to look for trouble with you!”

Yang Ye shrugged, “I’m still a little afraid!” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Zhong Ye’s eyelids twitched. This kid is up to his tricks again.

Who was the Weapon Progenitor? How could he possibly not know what Yang Ye was thinking?

So, he sized up Yang Ye and flicked a golden talisman to Yang Ye, “It contains a strand of my divine sense. Even though it can’t kill a Sage, even a Sage will be forced to retreat before it. Is that alright?”

Yang Ye smiled and quickly took it, “Of course, of course it’s alright.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and added, “Ancestor, we’re part of the same family now. So, I’m sure you’re able to discern that an evil treasure is following me. It has been following me for a long time, so can you help me destroy it?”

“Would he even dare?” Suddenly, a voice resounded from behind Yang Ye, and then a blood red face appeared not too far behind Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s hairs stood on end. What the heck is this evil treasure?! There’s a progenitor in front of me!

She doesn’t even fear a progenitor?

A chill ran down Yang Ye’s spine!
