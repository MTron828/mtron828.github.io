Chapter 1637 - A Show Of Strength!

Translator: InVader

Yang Ye was no fool, and he’d never thought about challenging the Yang Clan’s Discipline Hall.

However, he had no other choice.

The Discipline Hall had tried to stop him from killing Yang Danqing, and he was determined to kill her because he didn’t want to let her go so that she could scheme against him. At the moment, he knew that the Discipline Hall would definitely not let him off easily. At the very least, they would look for trouble with him.

Sure enough, the Discipline Hall was here again.

What should he do?

Try to seek reconciliation with them? Or beg for mercy? No, both wouldn’t work. He would only be asking for insult by trying any one of those methods. Since that was the case, why should he give them any face?

His objective was very simple, and it was to make a show of strength, an utter show of strength!

He wanted the Yang Clan’s higher-ups to see his potential. When his potential was sufficiently huge, he believed that the Discipline Hall would be helpless against him. Because at that time, the higher-ups of the Yang Clan wouldn’t allow others to harm him.

Of course, the precondition was that he had sufficient potential!

Breaking the Yang Clan’s rules was definitely not something that could be forgiven easily. However, he believed that when he displayed sufficient potential, he could stand above many rules of the Yang Clan.

Shock flashed through the eyes of those three Zenith Realm experts when they saw that Yang Ye actually dared to challenge the Discipline Hall. After all, the Discipline Hall’s status in the Yang Clan was slightly transcendent. It could be said that besides a few in the Yang Clan, everyone else in the Yang Clan, including the young masters were subject to the Discipline Hall’s rules!

It could be said that even those young masters had to give face to the Discipline Hall.

But this fellow before them was actually openly challenging the Discipline Hall!

It was a first!

The white haired old man’s face instantly turned cold, and he stared at Yang Ye, “Do you realize what you’re saying?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I do!”

The white haired old man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then he nodded. A moment later, he vanished on the spot.

At the exact same moment, Yang Ye suddenly drew his sword and swung it.

Bang!

An explosion resounded as Yang Ye’s figure was blasted 3km away. Yang Ye’s figure had just stopped moving when the old man appeared in front of him again, and then a wave of powerful aura slammed down upon Yang Ye like a mountain!

Yang Ye felt suffocated beneath this aura, and his entire body felt like it was about to collapse. At the same time, the space around him had even started to warp and crack open.

He’s so strong! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. The white haired old man was extraordinarily strong! He was much stronger than Yang Kong whom Yang Ye had just fought!

So, Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly at all.

Bang!

Slaughter Sword Intent swept out from within him, and it instantly relieved a large amount of the pressure on Yang Ye. However, the white haired old man suddenly slammed his fist forward.

Yang Ye didn’t even hesitate to swing his sword!

Bang!

The powerful force in the white haired old man’s fist instantly blasted Yang Ye backwards, but the white haired old man didn’t move at all. Yang Ye’s attack hadn’t been able to push him back at all. Moreover, the white haired old man even pressed forward and arrived in front of Yang Ye before slamming his fist at Yang Ye again.

Boom!

Yang Ye was blasted 3km away again. Once he stopped himself, some blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth.

This time, the white haired old man didn’t attack again, and he just gazed coldly at Yang Ye, “Is that all you’ve got?”

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and then he gazed at the old man, “Bring it on!”

Yang Ye’s figure transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

The Sword of Rebirth!

The Sword of Rebirth enhanced by Slaughter Sword Intent!

The ray of light was like a bolt of lightning that instantly arrived before the white haired old man, and a long spatial rift was left behind in its wake.

The space throughout its part had been torn open!

The white haired old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he clenched his right fist. At the instant he fully clenched his fist, a vortex suddenly appeared on his fist, and then he slammed his fist forward.

Boom!

A powerful tornado enveloped the ray of light that Yang Ye had transformed into.

Rumble!

Rumbling resounded incessantly while the space in a huge area started to tremble violently.

The other Zenith Realm experts had extremely solemn expressions on their faces as they watched the battle. Obviously, they hadn’t expected that Yang Ye could actually go head-on against an elder of the Discipline Hall!

After all, those able to assume the position of elder in the Discipline Hall had attained the Zenith Realm a few hundred years ago. Even though such experts hadn’t surpassed the Zenith Realm, their strength was absolutely not something an ordinary Zenith Realm expert could resist!

Yet now, this young master who was just at the Rebirth Realm was actually able to go head-on against an expert who’d attained the Zenith Realm a few hundred years ago!

At this moment, all of them started to become curious about Yang Ye’s identity.

Meanwhile, the battle was still going on.

Rays of sword energy and energy fists were flashing incessantly through the surroundings. Every collision caused space to tremble violently. The space here was actually on the verge of shattering, but the white haired old man instantly repaired it. So, Yang Ye couldn’t utilize a black hole to deal with the white haired old man!

Even though the white haired old man hadn’t been able to save Yang Kong, he knew how Yang Kong had died. Because his divine sense had been able to view the battle between Yang Ye and Yang Kong, and it was just his body that got here a bit too late.

Even though Yang Kong was weaker than him, Yang Kong wasn’t much weaker than him. So, if he allowed Yang Ye to create a black hole here, then even he would probably be unable to endure Yang Ye’s attacks. So, every single time space was about to collapse, the white haired old man would immediately repair it. So long as no black holes were created, then it wouldn’t be a huge problem for him.

The might of Yang Ye’s Laws of Darkness depended upon the size of a black hole. The larger the black hole, the more dark matter and dark energy he would be able to gain control of, and so it would be stronger.

In the beginning, Yang Ye had intended to utilize a black hole to deal with the white haired old man. Unfortunately, the white haired old man didn’t give him a chance to do that. Every single time he was about to shatter space, the old man would immediately repair the space there, causing the battle to feel extremely depressing to Yang Ye!

As they fought and fought, Yang Ye was gradually at a disadvantage. Or it should be said that he was gradually being suppressed.

However, it was normal. After all, the old man’s strength and cultivation far surpassed Yang Ye.

Bang!

Meanwhile, an explosion resounded abruptly, and then a figure was blasted away.

It was Yang Ye.

This time, the white haired old man didn’t follow up with another attack, and he just locked onto Yang Ye with his aura and said, “Your strength is alright. But you want to challenge my Discipline Hall with just that little bit of strength? How laughable!”

Yang Ye glanced at the white haired old man and fell silent.

Meanwhile, the white haired old man added, “However, I’m really quite curious. Because amongst the young masters I know of, none of them possess slaughter intent, sword intent, and the Laws of Darkness. I really want to know which one of the nine young masters you are!”

He glanced indifferently at Yang Ye at this point, and then he continued, “Will you remove that black robe yourself, or should I help you take it off?”

Suddenly, Yang Ye raised his sword and light flickered on its blade. At the same time, a wave of terrifying intent surged out like a torrent from within him. However, it didn’t take long for the intent to surge into the Sword Precursor.

The white haired old man’s face turned cold when he witnessed this. He slowly clenched his right fist, and a vortex flickered on it.

Even though they hadn’t launched their attacks, the space in a huge area around them had started to tremble violently.

The other Zenith Realm experts were visibly shocked. Because it was obvious that Yang Ye was about to execute a powerful move.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s aura was growing stronger and stronger. When it arrived at its peak, Yang Ye suddenly moved. He turned around, drew his sword, and swung it. The space in front of him was instantly sliced open, and then he leaped into the spatial rift.

He’d fled!

Everyone here was stunned by this scene.

He fled?

All of them couldn’t really wrap their heads around what had just happened. After all, just a moment ago, Yang Ye seemed like he intended to fight to the death. Yet now, he’d fled.

The white haired old man’s face was extremely unsightly. He felt like he’d been played. So, he didn’t say a word and just vanished on the spot.

The other Zenith Realm experts here intended to follow the white haired old man, but the old man’s voice suddenly came from afar, “I alone am enough. Go investigate the nine young masters! Reinvestigate all of them!”

The other Zenith Realm experts hesitated for a moment, and then they turned around and vanished on the spot.

Just as the white haired old man had said, they urgently desired to find out who Yang Ye was.

…

Flee!

Yang Ye naturally chose to flee. He was no fool. Fighting the white haired old man to the death was utterly meaningless to him. His objective was Yang Yan. Moreover, besides the white haired old man, there were four other Zenith Realm experts there!

So, it didn’t matter who won in their battle because he wouldn’t be able to gain anything in the end. Under such circumstances, he naturally had to flee. In any case, the white haired old man and the others didn’t know who he was!

Unfortunately, he’d underestimated the white haired old man’s speed and strength.

Around ten minutes later, Yang Ye stopped fleeing because the white haired old man had appeared not too far away from him. At the same time, a powerful aura instantly sealed off the space in an area of 3km.

“Fleeing?” The white haired old man laughed with ridicule, “Weren’t you very arrogant earlier? Didn’t you want to be the first to challenge my Discipline Hall? What? You’re going to flee now?”

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment, and then he said, “Old man, you came alone?”

The white haired old man spoke indifferently, “Am I not enough?”

“You’re alone…” Yang Ye nodded and continued, “Then I won’t hold back.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand and a Blood Puppet appeared both in front and behind the old man.

The white haired old man’s face instantly became extremely unsightly when he saw the Blood Puppets.

The old man stared at Yang Ye, “I thought you would fight me one on one.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“One on one?” Yang Ye shook his head, “You must be dreaming. I’d fight you one on one if I stand a chance, but if I don’t, I choose to gang up on you!”
