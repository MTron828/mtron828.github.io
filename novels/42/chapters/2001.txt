Chapter 2002 – You Won’t Have the Chance!

Kill Yang Ye?

A’Man and the others surrounded Yang Ye while vigilance covered their faces.

The Blood Demon King fell silent,

Meanwhile, Xiao Wuyi continued, “Blood Demon King, you don’t want to do it?”

The Blood Demon King fazed at Xiao Wuyi, “How do I know you aren’t just trying to turn us against each other?”

Xiao Wuyi smiled, “Don’t you want to take this bet? If you win it, you and the demon beasts behind you will leave; if you lose, allow me to be honest, even if you can kill your way out, where can you hide when the world belongs to us?”

The Blood Demon King fell silent once more. Obviously, he was quite hesitant.

A long time passed before the Blood Demon King looked up at Xiao Wuyi, and the latter smiled, “I know what you’re worried about. Don’t worry, the Sovereign of Man is a sovereign in the Human Dimension, and he always keeps his word. Moreover, he has displayed sufficient sincerity. Now, it’s your turn to display your sincerity!”

That sincerity was killing Yang Ye! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Suddenly, a demon beast by the Blood Demon King’s side vanished, and he was above Yang Ye when he appeared again. After that, he slapped his right palm down at Yang Ye, and a wave of powerful energy caused the space around Yang Ye to crack open!

“Fuck off!” A’Man roared with fury and slammed his spiked club upwards.

Bang!

That demon beast was slammed flying.

The surroundings fell silent.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye chuckled and gazed at the Blood Demon King, “I didn’t expect us to become enemies from allies in just a moment.”

The Blood Demon King spoke in a low voice, “Nothing stays the same forever!”

The moment that demon beast attacked, it represented that there was no room for discussion!

Moreover, what he just said was equivalent to really making his stand clear!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he gazed at Xiao Wuyi in the end, “I didn’t expect the Sovereign of Man to still be thinking about me!”

“The Sovereign of Man isn’t the only one!” Xiao Wuyi smiled, “Many other races can’t forget you. Of course, to be more precise, they can’t forget about the sword in your possession! Possessing what you shouldn’t possess will cause death.”

“Is that so?” Yang Ye chuckled, “Why don’t you give it a try!”

Xiao Wuyi gazed at the Blood Demon King.

Meanwhile, A’Man and the others’ profound energy surged, and they were ready to fight at any moment.

“A’Man!” Suddenly, a voice came from the side.

Everyone looked over and saw an old man there. The old man walked over to A’Man and spoke in a low voice, “A’Man, come home with me!”

Yang Ye and the others gazed at her, and she spoke in a low voice, “Uncle Li, I can’t!”

The old man spoke bitterly, “A’Man, we can’t interfere in these things. You’re our clan’s future, so even if you refuse to think about your future, you should consider the clan, right? Your father and young brother too!”

A’Man clenched her fists, closed her eyes slowly, and said, “If I leave now, I will never forgive myself. Uncle Li, go tell that kid he’ll have to take responsibility for our clan!”

Uncle Li wanted to say more, but A’Man waved her hand, “I’ve made my decision.!”

Uncle Li was anxious. Suddenly, he seemed to have thought of something and gazed at Yang Ye, “Young Brother Yang, A’Man is our clan’s future pillar of support, and we really can’t lose her. Please help advise her to leave!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when a middle aged man appeared before them, and his gaze descended onto Qin Chuan. He spoke angrily, “Qin Chuan, get the fuck over here!”

Qin Chuan glanced at the middle aged man, and there was slight fear in his eyes. However, he shook his head, “Dad, I can’t do that this time.”

The middle aged man was furious, “What did you say?!”

Qin Chuan pointed at Yang Ye and the others, “Dad, my brothers are here, so how can you tell me to go over to you?”

The middle aged man’s face was gloomy, but his tone grew much gentler, “You can’t interfere in this!”

Qin Chuan shook his head, “I don’t care. All I do know is that I can’t leave today. Or perhaps, I should say that we have to leave together!”

The middle aged man gazed at Qin Chuan for a long time and spoke gently, “You must realize that you don’t just have brothers, you have your parents and clan.”

Qin Chuan fell silent.

Yang Ye suddenly smiled, “Go!”

Qin Chuan gazed at Yang Ye, and the latter said, “This is trouble I caused in the past, and it has nothing to do with all of you. You don’t have to get tangled up in this.”

“It has nothing to do with us?” Qin Chuan chuckled, “How is it not related to us? That’s enough. Today, we’re either leaving together or dying together.” He gazed at the middle aged man and added, “Dad, I’ve made my decision, so you can go home now!”

The middle aged man slowly closed his eyes, “You unfilial son!”

Qin Chuan smiled, “It can’t be helped. There are some things that I must do!”

The middle aged man didn’t say anything else. He just shook his head and left.

People appeared incessantly and asked someone from Yang Ye’s group to leave, but not a single one of them did!

“Haha!” Xiao Wuyi chuckled, “Yang Ye, I didn’t expect you to have so many loyal brothers.” He gazed at the Blood Demon King, “Blood Demon King, it’s time for you to make your choice.”

The Blood Demon King fell silent for a few moments, and then he suddenly swung his fist at YY.

YY was blasted over 10km away!

Meanwhile, the Blood Demon King didn’t stop. He took a step forward and intended to attack again. However, a ray of light shot towards him, and it was so swift that it merely took an instant to arrive before him.

The Blood Demon King didn’t try to dodge it, and he just slammed his fist forward!

Bang!

Yang Ye’s sword energy was instantly obliterated!

After obliterating Yang Ye’s sword energy, the Blood Demon King took a step forward, and then he slammed his fist at Yang Ye once more. A wave of terrifying energy instantly appeared in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye flipped his palm, and a sword appeared there. After that, he took it in both hands and swung it down.

Bang!

The Blood Demon King’s wave of energy was slashed apart, but Yang Ye was pushed over 300m back.

At the same time, a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of Yang Ye’s mouth!

Suppression!

Suppression due to the gap in their cultivation!

While Yang Ye was completely suppressed, the spectators were extremely shocked.

Because Yang Ye was just at the 5th stage of the Enlightened Realm! But the Blood Demon King was at the Zen Realm!

Xiao Wuyi’s face was quite gloomy. Yang Ye’s speed of growth was truly too shocking. If Yang Ye was allowed to continue growing, he would definitely become a formidable enemy for the Sovereign of Man. As far as he was concerned, geniuses with such potential were best to be dead!

Complicated emotions flashed through the Blood Demon King’s eyes, “You’re much more outstanding than I expected!”

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, “You’re stronger than I imagined.”

The Blood Demon King’s eyes drooped, “Doing this goes against my heart. However, for the sake of these fellows behind me, I have no choice!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took a step forward and suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye. A moment later, he slammed his fist forward.

This time, Yang Ye didn’t dodge it, and he just took his sword in both hands and swung it.

As expected, Yang Ye was blasted away again. The Blood Demon King intended to attack again, but Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot.

Many people were unable to see a trace of Yang Ye anymore.

The Blood Demon King’s pupils constricted slightly, and he slammed his fist forward!

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the Blood Demon King was pushed over 300m back.

Everyone here was stunned by this scene.

A 5th stage Enlightened Realm expert pushed back a Zen Realm expert!

Xiao Wuyi slowly clenched his fists. He was prepared to take action himself!

The Blood Demon King glanced at his palm. There was a deep injury there, and even his bones were visible.

He fell silent for a moment, and then he looked up at Yang Ye. At the same time, Yang Ye had vanished on the spot.

Sword Fusion!

This attack was faster than the previous one, and it was stronger too! Everywhere Yang Ye passed, space was sliced into bits.

A solemn expression appeared in the Blood Demon King’s eyes!

It wasn’t strength that a 5th stage Enlightened Realm expert could possess!

The Blood Demon King restrained his thoughts, took a step back, and clenched his right fist. Ghastly cold light flickered on his fist, and then he slammed it forward!

Hiss!

The space in front of the Blood Demon King was obliterated.

Boom!

A loud explosion resounded abruptly. A moment later, a figure was blasted backwards, and it was Yang Ye’s figure.

As for the Blood Demon King, he was pushed over 300m back too!

Right when Yang Ye was blasted flying, Xiao Wuyi suddenly vanished on the spot. At the same time, A’Man, Mad Saber, and Ling appeared before Yang Ye and attacked simultaneously!

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Three explosions resounded, and then they were blasted away. Blood sprayed from their mouths as they flew.

Xiao Wuyi was a Zen Realm expert!

So, how could they be a match for him?

Xiao Wuyi glanced at A’Man’s group, and then he gazed at Yang Ye. His figure flashed and shot towards Yang Ye again.

He planned to give Yang Ye no chance!

He didn’t want to delay and risk any changes in the situation!

Yang Ye was about to counterattack when A’Man’s group of three obstructed Xiao Wuyi again, but they were casually blasted away by him.

This time, Xiao Wuyi didn’t attack again. He gazed at A’Man’s group, “Since you want to die with him, then I’ll fulfill your wish!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his hand, and countless rays of light instantly shot towards A’Man and the others.

Yang Ye was about to defend them, but the Blood Demon King suddenly obstructed his path.

Yang Ye’s eyes turned blood red, “If anything happens to them, I’ll definitely annihilate every single one of your descendants!”

The Blood Demon King fell silent for a moment and replied, “You won’t have the chance!”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.
