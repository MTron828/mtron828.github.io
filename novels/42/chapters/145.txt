Chapter 146 – Kill!

As the flower vines gradually dispersed, Feng Yi’s pale countenance was revealed behind them.

However, right at this moment, the sound of air being torn apart resounded. Feng Yi turned pale with fright upon hearing this, and terror instantly filled her eyes. Four swords gleamed as they shot over and arrived before Feng Yi at a speed that she was utterly unable to dodge, and then they directly pierced through her limbs and nailed her to the ground.

But this wasn’t the end of it because two more swords shot straight towards her stomach.

“No!” Feng Yi let out a shrill cry.

As if they’d heard Feng Yi, the two swords stopped just half an inch away from her stomach.

She immediately heaved a sigh of relief when she saw them stop, and then she looked at Yang Ye who stood in the distance. The haughty expression in her eyes had completely vanished, and there was only shock and deep fear that remained.

A high-grade Profound Rank technique executed with her strength at the Spirit Realm had actually been resisted by Yang Ye who was merely at the First Heaven Realm. How did he accomplish it? Exactly what trump cards does he still possess? Is he a monster? A string of questions flashed incessantly within Feng Yi’s mind.

“How could you still be alive!?” Feng Yi voiced out the question in her heart.

Yang Ye didn’t answer Feng Yi. He picked out a high-grade Healing Talisman and slapped it on himself before he walked slowly over to Feng Yi. He gazed at Feng Yi who lay on the ground while a wisp of a cruel smile arose on the corners of his mouth. He said, “Do you know why I haven’t killed you?”

“You want me to beg for mercy from you?” A wisp of ridicule arose on the corners of Feng Yi’s mouth as she said, “Yang Ye, I admit that I underestimated you. So, just do as you please. But if you think you can make me beg for mercy from you, then you can dream on!” Spirit Realm experts possessed their own dignity. Even though she was afraid of death, she would absolutely not beg for mercy from Yang Ye. Besides for the reason of maintaining her dignity, she was very clearly aware that begging for mercy was no different than asking for insult!

“You’re really unyielding, huh!” Yang Ye smiled before he raised his leg and stomped on Feng Yi’s stomach.

“AH!!” Feng Yi’s features instantly warped from the intense pain she experienced. After that, her expression became savage while she roared furiously in a hysterical manner. “You Little Bastard! You actually crippled my Dantian! AHHHH!!!”

What did the crippling of her Dantian mean? It meant that even if Yang Ye let her go, she would be doomed to the fate of being a cripple.

Yang Ye wasn’t interested in torture at all, and he’d merely crippled her so that he could rest at ease. Now, the reason he still hadn’t killed her was that he had questions for her. Even though he’d investigated the Flower Palace, he was utterly unable to find out about the strengths of the members of Flower palace. So, he wanted to obtain information related to the Flower Palace from Feng Yi!

“Tell me everything about the Flower Palace and my mother, and then I’ll allow you to die a swift death. Otherwise, I wouldn’t mind torturing you!” Yang Ye spoke indifferently as he looked at Feng Yi who gazed resentfully at him.

Feng Yi gazed resentfully at Yang Ye. Right when Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed, she suddenly said, “The Palace Master is at the Monarch Realm. Beneath the Palace Master, there are 26 Exalt Realm experts and countless Spirit Realm and King Realm experts. Moreover, there’s a Supreme Elder that’s in sealed off cultivation. If she hasn’t passed away while cultivating, then her strength would be even more formidable than the Palace Master!”

Yang Ye frowned because the Flower Palace’s strength had truly exceeded his expectations! It actually possessed a Monarch Realm expert and a Supreme Elder that was even more formidable than a Monarch Realm expert. In other words, even if he attained the Monarch Realm, it would be impossible for him to deal with the Flower Palace.

Perhaps, he could only eradicate the Flower Palace from the world by becoming a Saint Realm expert of legend!

“Do you know why I told you all of this?” Meanwhile, Feng Yi suddenly asked this question.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at her because he was very curious about why she was so cooperative.

“Do you feel despair?” Feng Yi revealed a savage smile. “Do you feel despair from finding out about the Flower Palace’s strength? Yang Ye, even if you work hard for your entire life and become a Monarch Realm expert, it would still be impossible for you to rescue your mother and take revenge. Your mother will be tortured to death by the cold gales beneath Passionless Cliff in the end, and as her son, you’ll be utterly unable to do anything besides watching her being tortured to death. Oh, you can still do one thing, you can go give your life away! HAHAHA!”

Yang Ye raised his head to look at the sky, and when he saw the sky was growing darker, he lowered his head and looked at her before he said, “If you intend to make me break down in this way and watch me fall into despair just like you have, then I want to tell you that you’ve miscalculated. I originally intended to end your life with a single swing of the sword, but I’ve noticed that there’s an even more suitable method for you to die!”

“What? You intend to disgrace me before killing me?” She laughed coldly as she spoke.

Yang Ye couldn’t help but chuckle when he heard this, and then he sized her up. Needless to say, this beautiful woman before him had some assets. However, would he be interested in her?

“I wouldn’t be interested in you even if you strip down completely!” After he said this, Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath again. With a wave of his right hand, the four swords that nailed her to the ground had returned into his Sword Chest, and then he carried her as he flashed towards Death Abyss.

......

At the bottom of Death Abyss.

Even though Feng Yi couldn’t move, her eyeballs could. At this moment, she was curiously sizing up this place that even Exalt Realm experts didn’t dare descend.

After sizing it up for a while, she gazed at him and said, “Little Bastard, what exactly do you intend to do!?”

Yang Ye gestured with his hand, and the spatial ring on her finger flew into his hand. He glanced through the things within it, and he immediately felt slightly disappointed when he noticed that there were only 3,000 plus energy stones within it. This Feng Yi really is poor.

She did possess some cultivation techniques and combat techniques, but he was unable to cultivate al of them. Now, he finally understood why the Flower Palace merely took female disciples. It was because its techniques could only be cultivated by females!

However, it was better than nothing as these treasures could definitely earn a good deal of money for him if he sold them.

“Little Bastard! If you want to kill me, then do it. Why did you bring me here!?” Feng Yi asked once more when Yang Ye remained silent.

Yang Ye’s gaze finally descended onto her when he heard this, and he said, “Weren’t you curious about my secrets? Look, haven’t I brought you to the bottom of Death Abyss that none dare to venture? Save a little of your strength and have a good look at this place. After all, it’s a rare opportunity. No, I should say that it’s your last opportunity!”

Feng YI remained silent for a short while as she gazed at Yang Ye, and then she said, “Truthfully speaking, you’re the most monstrous genius I’ve encountered. But no matter how monstrous you are, you’re unable to threaten the Flower Palace. So, your mother is bound to be tortured to death. You haven’t seen those cold gales, right? Not to mention staying there for a few years, I’m not even able to endure staying there for an hour. Those gales are like blades and even carry baleful Yin energy, so when it blows on a person, it’s like a myriad of blades are slicing that person up. No, it’s even more terrifying than that. When the baleful Yin energy enters the body, it’ll invade the meridians and internal organs, and the pain it causes is truly impossible to describe with words....” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“You want to infuriate me so that I’ll kill you right now?” said Yang Ye.

“Yang Ye, allow me to have a swift death because I was once a fellow sister of the same sect of your mother’s!” Even though she didn’t know what Yang Ye intended to do, she had a very bad feeling at this place, and she kept having the feeling that there was something staring at her from within the violet mist.

“You only realize that now?” Yang Ye’s expression turned slightly ferocious as he said, “When my mother begged you to let my sister and I go, why didn’t you remember that both of you were fellow sisters of the same sect. Why didn’t you think of that when you led that group to the Sword Sect to deal with my sister and me? Why didn’t you remember that when you sent an assassin at me? Why have you only thought about it now? You....”

When he spoke up to here, Yang Ye suddenly stopped, and then he raised his head and glanced towards the surroundings before a wisp of a smile suffused the corners of his mouth. He said, “You’ve heard of the Eighth Rank Darkbeasts, Nightbirds, right? I heard that these Darkbeasts love feeding on the human brain. If you haven’t seen one in the past, then you can see them to your heart’s content tonight.”

When he finished speaking, Yang Ye gestured with his right hand, and the violet mink appeared on his shoulder. After that, he moved backward swiftly.

At the same time, numerous pairs of green eyes lit up within the violet mist.

Swish!

Along with a sharp whistle that resounded through the surroundings, these green eyes suddenly enveloped down towards Feng Yi.

Feng Yi’s eyes opened wide while undisguised terror arose within them. “Little Bastard, I curse....”

Her voice stopped abruptly because she’d been enveloped by those pairs of green eyes.

In less than the time for a single breath, those Nightbirds dispersed, whereas, Feng Yi had vanished and only a pool of blood remained.

After they dealt with Feng Yi, all the Nightbirds shot their gazes at Yang Ye in unison. However, not a single one dared to approach Yang Ye at all. Obviously, they recognized the violet mink on his shoulder!
