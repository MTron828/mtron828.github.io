Chapter 1920 – The 12 Gold Envoys!

Boom!

The entire mountain shook violently while countless rocks fell from it before burying Yang Ye.

Nansi Yin was stunned. After that, she looked towards the side. An old man had appeared not too far away from her. The hunched old man had white hair and held a golden cane in his hand. His face was covered in wrinkles, and he seemed absolutely old!

It was the old man who’d attacked them just now!

A peak 3rd stage Enlightened Realm expert!

The old man hadn’t concealed his cultivation, so Nansi Yin had been able to see through it in an instant.

The 3rd stage of the Enlightened Realm was quite strong even in the large universe. Even though Yang Ye had killed 2nd stage True Realm experts, the gap between the 2nd and the 3rd stage was huge!

Simply speaking, if they didn’t have special abilities or trump cards, 10 2nd stage Enlightened Realm experts wouldn’t be able to defeat a 3rd stage True Realm expert!

Meanwhile, the old man walked slowly towards Nansi Yin. He sized her up, and then his gaze descended onto the brand on her forehead, “A Sage’s inheritance! How lucky!”

Nansi Yin spoke solemnly, “Who are you?!”

The old man grinned, “Don’t try to find out who I am. Once I take your inheritance, I’ll be going into hiding. After all, my strength isn’t sufficient to go against your Nansi Clan!”

Nansi Yin was about to say something, but the old man looked towards Broken Cliff Mountain instead. She looked along his gaze, and she saw the pile of rocks trembling, and then a man leaped up from within them!

It was Yang Ye!

Nansi Yin heaved a sigh of relief when she witnessed this, and the old man frowned instead.

Yang Ye was in quite a sorry state. His hair was disheveled, and his clothes were dirty. He looked like a beggar. However, his gaze was extremely sharp, and there was a very deep mark on his chest.

The old man sized up Yang Ye and said, “Needless to say, you’ve truly surprised me. A human was actually able to cultivate his body to such an extent! You’re truly monstrous!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “You surprised me too. An expert like you actually launched a surprise attack!”

A surprise attack!

The main reason Yang Ye had been blasted away was because the old man had taken him by surprise.

The old man smiled, “Those destined for greatness never bother about insignificant details!”

Yang Ye nodded, “True!”

Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and the old man’s cane shot forward.

Clang!

An ear piercing sound of collision resounded, and Yang Ye was blasted over 1km away.

As for the old man, he didn’t move an inch. However, some cracks had appeared on his cane.

The old man glanced at his cane, and complicated emotions flashed through his eyes. A moment later, he gazed at Yang Ye and was about to speak. However, 10 ethereal swords suddenly appeared around Yang Ye, and then they appeared around him.

Rays of sword energy crisscrossed and enveloped the old man!

“Disperse!” Suddenly, the old man’s voice resounded, and then the surroundings seemed like they’d frozen. After that, Yang Ye’s sword energy dispersed and vanished.

Yang Ye stood with his sword in hand while a trace of seriousness could be seen in his eyes. The old man was stronger than he’d expected!

The old man had a slightly solemn expression as well, “You possess such strength at the 6th stage of the True Realm. Needless to say, if you were in the same realm of cultivation as me, I may not be able to resist two swings of your sword. Unfortunately, you won’t have that chance!”

The old man took a step forward, and then Yang Ye noticed the world around him dim down. After that, a wave of mysterious energy enveloped him, causing his body to instantly feel like it was being pulled in all directions by 10,000 horses!

He felt like he was about to be torn apart!

Yang Ye was shocked, and he hurriedly activated the Sword Domain.

A ray of light flashed around Yang Ye.

Hiss!

It sounded like something had been sliced. An instant later, Yang Ye felt his body lighten, and then the tearing feeling vanished.

“That’s… a Domain…” The old man had a trace of disbelief in his eyes, “I wasn’t really sure earlier, but I never expected it to really be a Domain. You really are an extraordinary genius. If it wasn’t for the Sage’s inheritance, I would really not be willing to become enemies with you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man appeared above Yang Ye, and then he slammed his right palm down towards Yang Ye.

It seemed like the sky was collapsing, and the powerful aura it carried suffocated Yang Ye.

Ruthlessness flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes. He stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that shot up into the sky.

As soon as his sword came into contact with the old man’s palm, an explosion resounded, and then a terrifying wave of energy erupted from the point of collision, causing both of them to be blasted over 3km away!

However, it only took a moment for Yang Ye to vanish on the spot again.

Close quarter combat!

That was Yang Ye’s intention. However, the old man’s strength was shocking. As soon as he got close to the old man, the old man would always push him back, and he was always injured by the force of the old man’s attacks!

The gap between the 3rd stage of the 2nd stage of the Enlightened Realm wasn’t small at all!

Suddenly, the old man stopped and glanced at Nansi Yin, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “I really don’t have the mood to waste more time like this.”

As soon as he finished speaking, his cane vanished, and then he slowly raised his right hand. Suddenly, the clouds above Yang Ye split apart, and then a pitch black finger emerged from there.

Black lightning flickered around the finger!

The space here instantly became slightly ethereal once the finger appeared there, and it seemed like even space couldn’t endure the energy within that finger!

It was that terrifying!

Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly when facing this attack. He tightened his grip on his sword while his profound energy surged madly into it. As his profound energy surged in, the sword started trembling violently while ear piercing sword howls resounded without end.

When the finger arrived around 30m away from Yang Ye, Yang Ye stomped his right foot down.

Bang! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The ground collapsed below him while he relied on the counterforce to shoot up into the air and stab his sword against the tip of the finger!

Boom!

The pitch black finger shook violently while cracks appeared on it. However, a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of Yang Ye’s mouth.

Yang Ye held his sword with both hands as he pushed it against the finger. The veins on his arms bulged, and he was using all his strength. But he was still incapable of destroying the huge finger.

Suddenly, the old man vanished on the spot, and he was above the finger when he appeared again. He stomped it with his right foot.

Bang!

The huge finger crashed down, and Yang Ye was slammed down by the force of it. Right when he was about to slam against the ground, 10 ethereal swords appeared around the huge finger, and then rays of light slashed down upon the finger in various different ways.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

In an instant, the finger was sliced apart into countless pieces.

Meanwhile, a ray of light shot up into the air towards the old man.

A fierce glow flashed through the old man’s eyes. He flipped his right palm and slammed it down.

Bang!

The entire sky shook violently. Yang Ye’s sword energy was blasted apart, and Yang Ye was slammed to the ground.

Viciousness flashed through the old man’s eyes. He was about to attack again when Nansi Yin suddenly said, “15 minutes!”

The old man gazed at Nansi Yin, and the latter looked him in the eyes, “15 minutes. My father and the experts of the Nansi Clan will be here in 15 minutes. You might survive if you run now!”

The Nansi Clan!

The old man seemed hesitant. He glanced at Yang Ye, glanced at Nansi Yin, and then took a deep breath before vanishing into the sky.

He couldn’t kill Yang Ye in a short amount of time. If he couldn’t kill Yang Ye, then Nansi Yin could definitely delay until the experts of the Nansi Clan arrived. At that time, he would definitely die, and it would implicate his family too!

So, he’d decided to flee!

Once the old man left, Nansi Yin gazed at Yang Ye, “Are you alright?”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly. He wasn’t heavily injured, but this battle had allowed him to realize how insufficient his strength was. Regardless of whether it was combat instinct or any other aspect, the old man far surpassed him.

He was lacking in many other aspects, and the most important one was his cultivation!

He had to advance to the Enlightened Realm as soon as possible!

Nansi Yin spoke softly, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye nodded and vanished on the spot with her.

This time, no one stopped them, and they returned to the Human Dimension without encountering any further obstruction.

Yang Ye looked up at the sky while standing below Broken Cliff Mountain, “How long will it take your father to get here?”

Nansi Yin replied, “100 breaths, at most.”

Yang Ye nodded and closed his eyes.

Meanwhile, she hesitated for a moment and asked, “Why don’t you come to the Nansi Clan with me?”

The Nansi Clan? Yang Ye opened his eyes and shook his head, “I have other matters to attend to!”

She glanced at him, bit her lips, and wanted to say something. However, she suddenly looked up into the sky. 15 powerful auras had appeared there, and it only took a moment for them to arrive in the sky above Yang Ye and her.

Nansi Yin’s father was leading the group, and 12 others behind her father were covered in black robes and held blood red sabers while carrying blood red bows on their backs. Moreover, they emanated a horrifyingly cold and gloomy aura!

Yang Ye’s heart shook at the sight of them. Any one of them was at least 10 times stronger than the old man from before!

The Nansi Clan wasn’t ordinary at all!

The middle aged man visibly relaxed when he saw Nansi Yin, and then excitement appeared in the eyes of the old men behind the middle aged man.

A Sage’s inheritance had fallen into their Nansi Clan!

The middle aged man nodded slightly to Nansi Yin, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “Thank you, young brother. Please let me know if you need my Nansi Clan’s help with anything. We won’t refuse if it’s within our ability!”

Yang Ye smiled. He was just about to speak when 12 rays of golden light appeared far away in the sky. A moment later, 12 men in violet gold armor appeared in the sky.

They were led by an old man in a violet robe!

Their auras weren’t any weaker to the 12 black robed men behind the middle aged man.

Nansi Yin’s father frowned, “The 12 Gold Envoys?”

The violet robed old man glanced at Nansi Yin’s father’s group, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “I’m here on the Sovereign of Man’s orders to capture the traitor of our human race, Yang Ye! Don’t try to stop us! Otherwise, you’ll be considered as making an enemy of the Sovereign of Man, and the entire human race will be duty bound to kill you!”

At this moment, everyone gazed at Yang Ye.

The Sovereign of Man wants to capture him?
