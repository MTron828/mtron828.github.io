Chapter 2455 – Fuck Off!

She gazed at Yang Ye and smiled coldly, “Yang Ye, I didn’t expect you to have such a foul mouth. But I hope you can keep it up later!”

Suddenly, the gourd on Yang Ye’s waist trembled, and then a ray of light flashed.

Hiss!

Along with the sound of something being sliced apart, the green cage around Yang Ye vanished without a trace.

The woman’s pupils constricted, “Impossible…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared in front of her.

A sword stabbed forward!

Hiss!

Blood sprayed!

The experts behind the woman were stunned.

A seal had appeared above the woman, and it had forcefully suppressed her cultivation to the Three World Realm!

She stared at Yang Ye as she said, “Leave!”

She was speaking to the people behind her, and it was her last word. As soon as she said that, her head fell off her neck.

Blood sprayed out like a fountain!

As soon as she perished, Erya appeared by Yang Ye’s side and inhaled with her mouth wide open. The woman’s soul and energy were instantly sucked into Erya’s mouth.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had charged at the others!

All of them were Four World Realm experts! However, whenever the Seal of Suppression appeared above one of their heads, that person’s head would fly off into the air! In an instant, three of the six experts lost their heads, and the remaining three had fled to the edge of the sky.

Yang Ye didn’t give chase, but the Sword Gourd on his waist shook, and then a ray of light shot into the sky.

AH!

It didn’t take long for a shrill cry to resound there.

An instant kill!

However, the other two experts managed to escape.

Erya chuckled as she started to enjoy this “feast”.

It didn’t take long for her to finish her meal, and they continued on their journey.

Eternal Border.

Once he returned to Eternal Border, Yang Ye didn’t go straight for Eternal Village but went to the Nanli Clan instead.

As soon as he arrived in the air above it, an old man appeared before Yang Ye. The old man had a vigilant expression on his face, “Name yourself!”

Yang Ye cupped his fist, “Please notify Nanli Meng that an old friend is here to see her!”

“An old friend?” The old man frowned, “Who are you? Why do you want to meet our patriarch?!”

Patriarch? Yang Ye was slightly stunned. When did she become the patriarch?

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and said, “I’m Yang Ye, a friend of your patriarch’s! Please…”

“Yang Ye!” The old man cried out involuntarily, “Y-You’re Yang Ye?”

Yang Ye’s face froze. Am I that scary?

The old man revealed respect on his face when he realized that it really was Yang Ye, and he cupped his fist, “My patriarch isn’t here. As for where she is, I do not know. However, I can contact her and tell her to return.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Thank you!”

The old man nodded slightly, “You can come in and rest while you wait!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and nodded.

Just like that, he entered the Nanli Clan under the old man’s lead.

The old man brought Yang Ye to a room for guests and served Yang Ye some high quality tea before he left.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and closed his eyes slowly. He was about to enter the Primordial Pagoda when he suddenly opened his eyes again and looked toward the door. A beautiful woman in a violet dress was standing there.

She had a calm expression on her face and strands of white hair mixed within her hair, but it didn’t affect her beauty at all.

Yang Ye gazed at her in silence.

She walked over to Yang Ye and sat before him, “You’re Yang Ye!”

Yang Ye nodded.

She said, “I had a disagreement with Nanli Meng before this, and the source of it was you. I wanted to kill you, but she chose to be your friend.”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “Are you the Nanli Clan’s ancestor, Nanli Yin?”

She nodded, “I am.”

Yang Ye said, “She’s more suited to be the patriarch that you are!”

The woman looked Yang Ye in the eye, “I heard you’ve been to the Desolate World.”Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Yang Ye nodded, “Just be frank. I don’t like wasting my time and beating around the bush!”

She spoke solemnly, “I’m sure you’re aware of the war that occurred all those years ago. The war between the desolate race and Eternal Kingdom. Eternal Border took the Eternal Kingdom’s side all those years ago.”

Yang Ye asked, “So?”

She said, “The Sprite Progenitor of that time died at the desolate race’s hands.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “That has nothing to do with me or Snowy!”

She frowned slightly, “Yang Ye, countless people from Eternal Border died during that war, including that Sprite Progenitor…”

Yang Ye interrupted her, “You want me to take Eternal Kingdom’s side?”

She replied with a question, “Shouldn’t you?”

Yang Ye laughed with ridicule, “Is there something wrong with you in the head?”

Her face fell, “What are you trying to say?!”

Yang Ye laughed coldly, “What am I trying to say? Let me be honest then. Which side I take is none of your damn business! Fuck off or I’ll end you right now.”

She was livid, “Yang Ye, do you think Eternal Border and Eternal Kingdom need you? If it wasn’t for the Sprite Progenitor, Eternal Kingdom wouldn’t even spare you a glance. You…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared in front of her, and a sword stabbed against her forehead.

Her expression changed drastically, and her profound energy circulated, causing a strand of Yin energy to surge out from within her. However, the energy was instantly sliced into bits by Yang Ye’s sword, and then his sword pressed against her forehead again!

Nanli Yin’s figure stiffened!

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “You’re only alive because I’m giving Nanli Meng some face. Besides that, I’m friends with Nanli Meng, but I’m not friends with you!”

Yang Ye returned to where he’d been a moment ago and sat down.

Nanli Meng’s face was extremely unsightly. She was about to speak when footsteps came from outside the door, “Brother Yang, long time no see!”

Yang Ye turned around and saw Nanli Meng at the door!

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s been a while!”

He still had quite a good impression of her. Or it should be said that she was like a friend. After all, she’d taken a risk to warn him about many things in the past.

He had to remember this kindness!

Nanli Meng walked over to Yang Ye, glanced at Nanli Yin, and said, “Ancestor, can I speak with him alone?”

Nanli Yin grunted coldly and left.

Nanli Meng sat down, “Some things have happened in Eternal Border while you were gone. Eternal Kingdom extended an olive branch to the experts of Eternal Border, and as far as the experts here are concerned, it’s great news. Because they don’t have to continue struggling bitterly at the Eternal River. So, it’s no different than instantly rising up to the heavens for them.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Do you want to know what I think?”

She smiled, “Go ahead!”

Yang Ye explained, “What Eternal Kingdom is doing is no different than being nice when they need help and treating the people of Eternal Border like ants when they’re of no use again. They’re treating everyone here like people of low status. Actually, they are just using the people of Eternal Border, and the people of Eternal Border have lived long enough to realize that. But they are still willing to accept such a fate!”

Yang Ye shook his head at this point, “For the sake of the so-called Grand Dao and eternal life, they can even give up their pride and honor!”

The Grand Dao and eternal life!

It was like how the people of the mortal world were willing to abandon everything to achieve a certain goal. Protocol? Morality? In the eyes of some people, they were worthless. Money was the only valuable thing to those people!

As for cultivators, only the Grand Dao and eternal life were valuable!

Nanli Meng shook her head, “Brother Yang, just as you’ve said, they are aware of everything. But have you thought about what choice the people of Eternal Border have when they are stuck between the desolate race and Eternal Kingdom? The people of Eternal Border are weaker than them, and weakness represents that they don’t have any right to make other choices.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Forget that. I’m here because I want information on the location of some people.”

She spoke softly, “The Longevity Sect, Freedom Sect, Creation Sect, and Immortality Sect?”

Yang Ye nodded, “And one more person, Xiao Shenwu!”

Nanli Meng fell silent.

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

Nanli Meng spoke softly, “Brother Yang, they are nothing to you now. Killing them or not isn’t a problem to you, isn’t it?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “It’s a huge problem.”

Nanli Meng gazed at him, and he smiled, “I’m a petty person! Very petty! If someone is good to me, I’ll never forget it; but if anyone tries to harm me, then I’ll never forget it either. Right, I repay them a hundredfold, both of them.”

She glanced at him and sighed softly, “If you kill them, Eternal Border will really not have many experts left, and it will have no right to speak for itself before the desolate race or Eternal Kingdom.”

She stood up as she spoke, “Brother Yang, Eternal Border needs some experts!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Are you trying to speak on their behalf?”

She replied, “Sort of!”

Yang Ye smiled, “That’s not very nice of you. You didn’t step forward to speak on my behalf when they were hunting me down. Yet now that I want to kill them, you’re speaking up for them? Moreover, you’re making it seem like I’m being unreasonable. Miss Meng, this isn’t what friends should do. Don’t you think so too?”

She said, “It’s because I’m not friends with them, but I’m friends with you.”

Yang Ye grinned, “Are we really friends?”

Nanli Meng wanted to say more, but Yang Ye shook his head, “I have other matters to attend to, so I won’t disturb you further. Farewell!”

He stood up and walked away.

Meanwhile, Nanli Meng suddenly said, “Brother Yang, there are billions of living beings in Eternal Border! If you kill those top experts, no one will be there to speak up for the weak.”

Yang Ye turned around and gazed at her, “They never thought about any living beings when they tried to kill me. What? Now that it’s time for me to kill them, you’re trying to use all kinds of issues of obligations and morality on me? Miss Meng, allow me to be frank. I’m going to kill all of them. How could those days of being hunted ever be made up for if I don’t kill them all?”
