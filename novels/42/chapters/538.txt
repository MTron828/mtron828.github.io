Chapter 539 – Saint Liu Yun!

When the three of them vanished from the stone steps, the force of gravity on the stone steps instantly vanished, and then all of them heaved sighs of relief before running madly up the stone steps. Even though they weren’t able to obtain Saint Liu Yun’s inheritance, there was definitely a huge amount of treasures in such a large palace. Since they’d come here, how could they possibly just leave empty handed?

The members of the demon race and devil race charged over as well. After all, they hadn’t come here for Saint Liu Yun’s inheritance because Saint Liu Yun was a human profounder. How could a human profounder possibly give his inheritance the devil or demon race? The reason they’d come here was mainly for Saint Liu Yun’s treasures!

How could anyone not be tempted by the treasures which were left behind by a Saint Realm expert?

The only people who didn’t move were those in Luo Jun’s group.

“Mortal Emperor, what should we do now?” Granny Rong spoke in a low voice. She hadn’t gone with Luo Jun’s group because her strength was comparatively lacking. So, she hadn’t had the opportunity to participate in the surprise assault against Yang Ye and An Nanjing. That was exactly why she’d escaped death.

Luo Jun took a deep breath and said, “The World Portrait might fall into the hands of An Nanjing or Yang Ye. It’s meaningless for us to continue staying here. Send for the leaders of the 10 regiments.” When he spoke up to this point, Luo Jun pondered deeply for a moment before he continued. “Order the four Grand Commanders of the Souleater Corps, and the two Pavilion Masters and four Vice Pavilion Masters of the Shadow Pavilion and the Dark Pavilion to get here quickly!”

Granny Rong’s heart shook. She knew that the Mortal Emperor was determined to kill Yang Ye this time.

Luo Jun took a long glance at the end of the stone steps, and then he said, “Fine, I’ll let you bring the World Portrait out for me!” Luo Jun turned around and left as soon as he finished speaking.

Yin Xuan’er watched Luo Jun leave from the stone steps, and her brows knit together slightly.

“Why didn’t you allow me to go join Yang Ye just now?” Lu Jianyao spoke with slight displeasure from Yin Xuan’er’s side. Actually, they’d arrived at the wilds a long time ago, but Yin Xuan’er didn’t allow her to go see Yang Ye, and it made Lu Jianyao feel very displeased.

Yin Xuan’er glanced at Lu Jianyao and said, “Listen carefully. Perhaps Luo Jun is helpless against Yang Ye and An Nanjing. But killing us is as easy as crushing a few ants to him. If you were to go to Yang Ye’s side, then Luo Jun would definitely target you. How would you resist Luo Jun if he were to try to kill or capture you?”

“Wouldn’t I still have Yang Ye and An Nanjing to protect me?” Lu Jianyao spoke softly and seemed to be slightly lacking confidence.

Yin Xuan’er shook her head and said, “Do you know why Yang Ye still allowed you to come here when you’re so stupid and like to push your friends into difficult positions? Even though Yang Ye is a ruthless person that doesn’t show any mercy when he does things, he’s a very loyal person. You were willing to die in order to protect him while he was breaking through that day. So, he really took you to be a friend from that moment onward. That’s the only reason why he’s able to tolerate all the things you do.

But you have to have some awareness. Besides being a burden to him, what else can you do while staying by his side? Since you can’t help him and will only be a burden to him, then why follow him? Think about it yourself.”

Lu Jianyao fell silent while her face became slightly pale.

“Let’s go. If I’m not wrong, then there are definitely a huge amount of techniques and treasures within that palace. We won’t get anything if we’re late!” Yin Xuan’er led Jin Sha and the others up the stone steps.

Lu Jianyao remained silent on the spot for quite some time before she followed them as well.

...

“He’s Saint Liu Yun?” In a hall, Yang Ye gazed with astonishment at a middle aged man who sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion not too far away from him. There was nothing unusual about the middle aged man’s appearance, or it should be said to be extremely ordinary like a commoner who hadn’t cultivated at all.

There was a trace of surprise in An Nanjing’s eyes as well. Obviously, she hadn’t imagined that a Saint Realm expert like Saint Liu Yun would actually seem so ordinary.

“Surprising, right?” The old man in Daoist robes said, “He really is Saint Liu Yun. He was extraordinary all those years ago.”

Yang Ye gazed at Saint Liu Yun whose face was rosy as if he wasn’t dead at all, and then Yang Ye said, “Did Saint Liu Yun vanish along with those other Saint Realm experts from the ancient times, or is he dead?”

The old man shook his head and said, “I don’t know. Don’t ask me about anything else as well because I wouldn’t tell you even if you did ask about it.”

When he spoke up to this point, the old man walked over to Saint Liu Yun and said, “The person you’ve been waiting for is here.”

Yang Ye and An Nanjing watched with solemn expressions in their eyes as a slightly ethereal and translucent figure appeared above Saint Liu Yun.

A soul!

The translucent figure was clearly a part of Saint Liu Yun’s soul.

Saint Liu Yun opened his eyes, and then his gaze descended onto both An Nanjing and Yang Ye. He frowned a little when he saw An Nanjing. “A woman?”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed when he heard this, and then a trace of confusion and uneasiness arose in the depths of his eyes.

The old man in Daoist robes said, “She isn’t an ordinary person. She possesses 6 types of Intents and has attained the 9th level in every single one. Such natural talent is probably outstanding even during your era, right?”

A trace of surprise flashed through Saint Liu Yun’s eyes, and then he carefully sized up An Nanjing before he said, “Sure enough, she really is an outstanding genius. What monstrous natural talent. I never expected that such a genius would have appeared after 15,000 years. Not bad, not bad indeed.” A smile appeared on his face.

After that, Saint Liu Yun glanced at Yang Ye. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“This kid isn’t bad as well. He has attained the 9th level of Sword Intent at such a young age, so he’s quite a genius as well. However, he’s quite inferior when compared to this little girl,” said the old man.

“9th level Sword Intent?” Saint Liu Yun nodded slightly and said, “He is a genius for being able to attain 9th level Sword Intent at such an age. Unfortunately, he can only be considered to be a genius but not a peerless genius.” When he spoke up to this point, Saint Liu Yun’s gaze descended onto An Nanjing. There was a trace of hesitation in his eyes, but it wasn’t long before that hesitation transformed into a firm gaze.

An Nanjing frowned a little from being stared at like that. She didn’t really like Saint Liu Yun for some reason.

“Are you still not satisfied?” The old man said, “If you’re not satisfied with this little girl, then I guarantee that you’ll be unable to find another candidate who satisfies you. Because her natural talent is definitely the best in the world right now.”

Saint Liu Yun nodded slightly, and then he gazed at An Nanjing and said, “Little Girl, are you willing to receive my inheritance? Right, you might not know me, so allow me to introduce myself. My name is Ye Liuyun. I started cultivating at the age of 5, attained the Exalt Realm at the age of 19, the Monarch Realm at the age of 50, and the Saint Realm at the age of 390. During the ancient times, those who were capable of attaining the Saint Realm at the age of 390 or younger could be counted with the figures on just one hand.”

Yang Ye suddenly said, “May I ask if Senior is dead, or are you alive?”

Saint Liu Yun frowned a little and seemed to be quite displeased, but he still explained. “Unless they take their own lives or are killed, otherwise, it’s impossible for Saint Realm experts to die. Because Saint Realm experts have broken through the shackles of lifespan and attained a true state of being eternal with the world. So, this question of yours is very ignorant.”

Yang Ye lowered his head a little when he heard this, and then a cold glow flashed through his eyes.

“I don’t want to inherit your mantle!” Meanwhile, An Nanjing spoke abruptly.

Saint Liu Yun’s gaze descended onto An Nanjing, and then he frowned and asked. “Why?”

An Nanjing said, “I only came here to look for the World Portrait.”

The corners of the old man’s mouth twitched while Yang Ye gazed at An Nanjing with astonishment. The World Portrait? She came here for the World Portrait? Yang Ye didn’t have to think to know that she definitely wasn’t doing it for Luo Jun. Since it wasn’t for Luo Jun, then there was only one other possibility.

She was doing it for him, Yang Ye!

Yang Ye felt he was being quite narcissistic, but that was how he thought about the matter.

“The World Portrait?” Saint Liu Yun glanced at the old man in Daoist robes and said, “I have the World Portrait, but it’s a Natural Dao Artifact, so why should I give it to you? You wouldn’t be thinking of taking it by force, right? Haha, even though I’m just a strand of soul, I can still kill ordinary Monarch Realm experts with ease. However, I can give you an opportunity.”

An Nanjing said, “What are your conditions!?”

Saint Liu Yun said, “Receive my inheritance. After you inherit my mantle, the World Portrait and all the treasures within the palace will be yours. That’s a really good thing to you, isn’t it? Because you wouldn’t lose anything and would just have to receive my inheritance. Not only would it improve your strength, it would even allow you to obtain a Natural Dao Artifact and other treasures.”

An Nanjing glanced at Yang Ye, and then she gazed at Saint Liu Yun and said, “I agree!” Just as Saint Liu Yun had said, there was no harm in doing this.

A smile appeared on Saint Liu Yun’s face, and then he said, “Alright, then fully open up your heart and mind. I’ll enter your sea of consciousness in a moment. Don’t resist me and just stay calm as you receive my inheritance. Understand?”

An Nanjing frowned and said, “I’ve received the inheritance of the Martial God, and it wasn’t like that.” When she received the inheritance of the Martial God, the Martial God had merely transmitted his inheritance into her mind, and she hadn’t been asked to fully open up her heart, mind, and sea of consciousness. After all, if she was to do that and fully give up on resistance, then it would be extremely dangerous if Saint Liu Yun had ill intent.

“The inheritance of the Martial God, it was probably only a portion of it, right? I’m giving you my full inheritance, so it’s naturally not the same!” Saint Liu Yun smiled. “I’m just a strand of soul, so is there any need to fear that I would have ill intent towards you? Moreover, both of you are here right now, so you don’t seem to have any ability to resist even if I did have ill intent towards you, right?”

Yang Ye’s brows knit together even more tightly when he heard this.

An Nanjing didn’t hesitate anymore and nodded. “Alright!”

A wisp of excitement flashed through Saint Liu Yun’s eyes, and he was just about to enter An Nanjing’s sea of consciousness when Yang Ye suddenly stood before An Nanjing and said, “Wait!”

A wisp of ghastly killing intent flashed in Saint Liu Yun’s eyes.
