Chapter 1882 – Yang Ye’s My Father!

A misunderstanding.

Bao’er and the others were stunned by the middle aged man’s sudden change of tone.

Meanwhile, the other middle aged man was puzzled, “Big Brother, who the hell is that? He…”

“Shut up!” The middle aged man in a luxurious robe glared at the other middle aged man, and then he gazed at Yang Nianxue. But when he gazed at her, the angry expression on his face had vanished without a trace and was replaced by an amiable smile.

He grinned, “Young Miss, that was all just a misunderstanding. Er… er… don’t tell your father about it, alright?”

Yang Nianxue blinked, and then she gazed at Bao’er. The latter hesitated for a moment and said, “Of course, it was just a misunderstanding, so we won’t tell him. However, you have to tell us how to get to Heaven Pillar Mountain. We traveled according to this map, but it doesn’t seem correct.”

The man visibly relaxed, and then he glanced at them, “You’re going to Heaven Pillar Mountain?”

Yang Nianxue nodded, “I want to go see my Dad!”

The man’s eyelids twitched. He hesitated for a moment and pointed to the right, “Go in that direction. Based on your speed, it won’t take long.”

Yang Nianxue was quite doubtful, “You’re not lying, right?”

The man replied, “No. I just came from there.”

Yang Nianxue gazed at Bao’er, and the latter nodded, “Thank you. We… we’ll be going now.” She gazed at Lei Lin as she spoke.

Lei Lin understood her, and she immediately waved her hand. A lightning dragon appeared before them, and then they vanished into the distance.

Once they left, the middle aged man asked the man in a luxurious robe, “Big Brother, why?”

The man in a luxurious robe took a deep breath and replied, “Greed! Greed kills! If we really attacked them, our Lin Clan would definitely vanish from this world! It will vanish completely!”

The middle aged man spoke solemnly, “Who’s Yang Ye?”

The man in a luxurious robe glanced at the middle aged man, “A madman… Practically everyone who offended him is dead!”

He’d just come from Heaven Pillar Mountain, so he naturally knew about Yang Ye, and that was why he’d decisively chosen to stop. Offend a malevolent existence like Yang Ye for just a Sprite King? Only an idiot would do that!

Not to mention a Sprite King, he wouldn’t be willing to offend Yang Ye even if it was 100 Sprite Kings!

Because he wouldn’t be alive to use them!

…

The three young girls soared on the lightning dragon.

On the lightning dragon, Yang Nianxue was slightly smug, “Big Sister Bao’er, my Dad is formidable, huh?”

Bao’er hadn’t even replied when Lei Lin hurriedly nodded, “Big Brother is very formidable!”

Bao’er hesitated for a moment and said, “Why… why don’t we head back?”

She understood a little more than them, and she wasn’t as carefree as Lei Lin and Yang Nianxue. At this moment, she’d realized how dangerous the outside world was, and she’d realized how rash and dangerous their actions were!

“Go back?” Yang Nianxue shook her head, “No, I want to look for Dad.”

Bao’er said, “Let’s vote on it! I vote to head back!”

So, they gazed at Lei Lin.

It was how they dealt with a difference of opinion. The minority followed the majority. Now, Lei Lin held the deciding vote.

She bit her pinky and thought for quite some time before she said, “I want to see Big Brother too!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Yeah!” Yang Nianxue revealed a brilliant smile.

Bao’er shook her head helplessly.

Just like that, they continued on their journey.

All along the way, Bao’er started to become quite worried, but she relaxed completely as time passed.

They’d encountered many on the way, and some of those people had ill intent towards them. But when Xue’er said that her father was Yang Ye, all of their attitudes immediately turned around completely!

Yang Ye!

Who was he?

It could be said that he was the most famous existence in the medium universe right now. Especially in Heaven Pillar Mountain. Presently, Yang Ye wasn’t invincible below the Heavenly Exalts anymore, he was invincible below the Ancient Cultivators!

Of course, it wasn’t the most terrifying part about Yang Ye. The most terrifying aspect was his character and how he did things.

He was a madman!

So, once they found out that Yang Nianxue was Yang Ye’s daughter, they immediately smiled and apologized. Moreover, some even helped Yang Nianxue’s group.

That was exactly why the three of them advanced smoothly, and it didn’t take long for them to arrive on the Crimson Plains.

Heaven Pillar Mountain was right after the Crimson Plains!

“Wow! What a huge mountain!” Yang Nianxue spoke excitedly as she gazed at the towering mountain before her, “It’s so huge and tall.”

Bao’er and Lei Lin nodded with agreement. Heaven Pillar Mountain was the largest mountain they’d ever laid eyes upon.

Meanwhile, Yang Nianxue said, “Come! Let’s climb the mountain!”

Bao’er was slightly hesitant, “Er…”

Yang Nianxue waved at Bao’er with both hands, “Big Sister Bao’er, don’t you want to go up there and have a look?”

Bao’er glanced at the mountain. It’s so tall! It’s definitely really fun up there… But will it be dangerous?

Bao’er was quite conflicted.

Meanwhile, Yang Nianxue said, “We have Dad, so what’s there to fear?”

Lei Lin hurriedly nodded, “Right, we have nothing to fear when we have Big Brother!”

Little Laborer! When she thought about the attitude others had towards them all along the way here, Bao’er felt that Yang Ye was definitely doing quite well here. Moreover, Yang Lianshuang and the others were here too, so she felt that it probably wasn’t dangerous.

Yes, it’s not dangerous!

As soon as she thought up to this point, Bao’er wasn’t conflicted or hesitant anymore, and she waved her hand, “Come! Let’s head up the mountain!”

Just like that, they arrived at the foot of Heaven Pillar Mountain.

They were about to enter the mountain when an old man appeared before them. Even though the Elegant Exalt had been killed, her forces still existed, but they had a new leader. So, the lower levels of Heaven Pillar Mountain were still in their control.

The old man was stunned when he saw them, and he thought his eyes were deceiving him.

What the heck?

A Sprite King and two Monarchs?

Yang Nianxue said, “Grandpa, what are you doing?”

The old man sized them up carefully again. In the end, he was certain that he wasn’t mistaken.

The old man hesitated for a moment and said, “May I know who you are?”

Yang Nianxue pointed ahead, “We want to go in and play!”

Play!

The old man’s face twitched. He glanced at them with doubt in his eyes. In the end, he hesitated for a moment and asked, “Do you know the rules?”

He didn’t try to dissuade them. Because as far as he was concerned, they were definitely not ordinary people! What a joke! Would an ordinary person dare to come here? So, the three of them became extremely mysterious to him.

“The rules?” Yang Nianxue blinked.

She was about to speak when Bao’er said, “I know! I know!”

She filled her palm, and an energy stone appeared before the old man, “The entrance fee, right? I understand, I do!”

It was an energy stone, the most ordinary type of energy stone!

The old man’s face became quite weird when he saw it.

“Is it not enough?” Bao’er withdrew 10 more energy stones and passed them to the old man, “Is it enough now?”

The old man was at a loss for words.

Yang Nianxue pulled on the corner of Bao’er’s sleeve and spoke softly, “Big Sister Bao’er, it doesn’t seem to be enough!”

Bao’er was about to withdraw more energy stones when the old man spoke abruptly, “Are you here to play tricks on me?”

His voice was quite gloomy and heavy.

Bao’er and Yang Nianxue exchanged glances. In the end, Yang Nianxue walked over to the old man, hesitated for a moment, and spoke softly, “Let me tell you something. My… my father is Yang Ye! He… he told us to come here!”

“Yang…” The old man was stunned, and then he asked, “Yang Ye?”

Yang Nianxue hurriedly nodded.

The old man gulped and glanced at the surroundings. At this moment, he felt like a pair of eyes were on him.

In the end, he revealed an amiable smile, “I see. I understand. Please head in!”

Bao’er asked, “Don’t we have to pay the entrance fee?”

The old man shook his head, “No!”

Everyone in Treasure Paradise knew how the Elegant Exalt had died! Yang Ye had killed her! So, the new master of Treasure Paradise had immediately given the order that prohibited them from offending Yang Ye!

Actually, besides the ancient cultivators, no one in Heaven Pillar Mountain dared to offend Yang Ye. Even the other remaining Heavenly Exalts didn’t dare to do so!

Yang Nianxue gazed at Bao’er when she heard the old man, “Dad is better than energy stones!”

Bao’er nodded, “Indeed!”

Just like that, they swaggered into the interior of Heaven Pillar Mountain.

Meanwhile, the old man glanced at the surroundings and cupped his fist, “Young Master Yang, our Treasure Paradise has no ill intent towards you. The Elegant Exalt’s actions were her own personal actions, and it has nothing to do with our Treasure Paradise. Please don’t misunderstand!”

He received no reply.

The old man hesitated and continued, “Our Master said that if you’re free, he’d like to meet you and apologize for what happened between you and the Elegant Exalt…”

He still received no reply.

The old man frowned and fell into deep thought, “Has he gone inside?”

…

“My Dad is Yang Ye!” A clear and melodious voice frequently resounded in the interior of Heaven Pillar Mountain.
