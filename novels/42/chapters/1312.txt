Chapter 1313 – The King!

Yang Ye was able to sense that the energy within the golden flame seemed to be absorbed by Snowy.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly recalled that Snowy liked to absorb pure energy, and natural treasures were condensed from all sorts of pure energy. In other words, anything condensed from energy, even natural treasures, could be absorbed by Snowy!

Just thinking about it was horrifying!

If it’s really as I think, then wouldn’t Snowy be a little too terrifying?! She’s like a counter to all beings made of energy!

Suddenly, the young woman grabbed the golden flame, and then she put it away again. After that, she gazed at Snowy with a trace of seriousness in her eyes.

For the very first time, Yang Ye saw seriousness in her eyes. Even when he utilized the Sword Domain earlier, he’d only seen surprise in her eyes. Yet now, he’d seen seriousness in them!

The young woman clearly knew Snowy’s background, and it was definitely extremely terrifying.

Snowy was stunned when she saw the young woman hide the flame, and then she became furious. She clenched her tiny claws tightly while glaring angrily at the young woman, and she gnashed her teeth incessantly while seeming to intend to charge forward and fight the young woman.

The young woman glanced at Snowy, hesitated for a moment, and then flipped her palm. A violet fruit appeared on her palm as she said, “Take this instead.”

The fruit was around the size of an adult’s head, and it was completely violet and covered in faint rays of moving light.

As soon as the young woman withdrew the fruit, the multicolor python’s gaze instantly locked onto the fruit, and it revealed a trace of envy.

Snowy’s gaze descended onto the violet fruit. As soon as she saw the fruit, she blinked before she slowly relaxed her tightly clenched claws. In the end, she waved her claw lightly, and it floated over to her. Snowy licked her lips as she gazed at it and was about to swallow it. However, she suddenly stopped, and then she turned around and looked at both Yang Ye and Zi’er.

She blinked before taking the fruit in her arms and floating in front of them. After that, she held the fruit in one claw while pointing at them with her other claw, and she revealed a brilliant smile.

Yang Ye and Zi’er exchanged glances, and their hearts felt warm. Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head gently, and then he gazed at the fruit. After that, his expression changed.

He’d thought that the fruit was at the Emperor Rank, but he was wrong! It wasn’t at the Emperor Rank; it was at the Void Rank! A natural treasure at the Void Rank!

No wonder Snowy likes it so much! Yang Ye gazed at the young woman. Isn’t she a little too generous? She gave away a Void Rank fruit just like that!

Yang Ye suppressed the shock in his heart and gazed at Snowy who was ceaselessly trying to push the fruit to him. Yang Ye chuckled and rubbed Snowy’s head gently, “Have it yourself. I don’t want it.”

Even though it would definitely help him, he wasn’t that thick-skinned as to take a share of Snowy’s food. It was something the young woman had given Snowy and not him. The young woman would look down upon him if he ate it!

But Snowy shook her head and pushed the fruit towards Yang Ye and Zi’er.

Yang Ye was about to speak when Zi’er took the fruit. She moved her hand slightly and split the fruit into 2 halves. She passed a half to Snowy and said, “Eat it. We’ll have ours later.”

Snowy blinked, nodded, and then took the half in her claws and started to bite it. It didn’t take long for her to finish that half. Once she was done, she licked her claws and seemed to not be satisfied. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. This fellow is an absolute glutton!

After she ate the fruit, Snowy flew over to Yang Ye’s shoulder, rubbed her head against his face, and then closed her eyes. It didn’t take long for her to fall asleep.

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Meanwhile, the young woman suddenly asked, “What’s it doing with you?!”

Yang Ye turned to look at her and said, “Fate.” It really had been fate that had brought them together.

The young woman asked, “Do you know what she is?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

A cold smile arose on the corners of the young woman’s mouth, and her laughter was filled with ridicule.

Yang Ye’s face darkened when he heard her laughter. He was truly quite annoyed by her. If it wasn’t for the fact that he was really not confident in his ability to defeat her, he would definitely bash her up.

“What exactly is she?” asked Zi’er. She’d realized that Yang Ye and the young woman didn’t get along at all, so it was impossible for them to talk normally.

The young woman glanced at Snowy who was fast asleep, fell silent for a short while, and then said, “There’s a saying in the large world — Amongst the myriad of beings that the heavens gave life to, the Sprite Lord reigns supreme. She’s a Sprite Lord. Once she grows a little, she can instantly suck away all the spirit energy on the continent. If she reaches adulthood, then she can instantly suck away the spirit energy in an entire stellar region!”

Yang Ye’s figure stiffened, and Zi’er was stunned as well.

What did it mean to absorb the spirit energy throughout the continent in an instant? It was the spirit energy of the entire continent! If she could really absorb the spirit energy throughout a continent, then it was equivalent to instantly destroying the continent! As for absorbing the spirit energy in a stellar region, it was equivalent to destroying countless worlds!

Yang Ye gulped and turned his head to glance at Snowy. That little fellow can become that powerful?

“Her true ability is much more terrifying that what I’ve just described!” Meanwhile, the young woman added, “Human, it’s fortune for you that she’s following you, but it’s your bad luck as well.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

The young woman replied, “Because many will want to kill you, including me.”

As she spoke, she raised her right hand slightly and was about to attack. Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. Obviously, he hadn’t expected her to attack just like that.

Yang Ye would naturally not just stand there and wait for death to arrive, and the profound energy within him surged. Suddenly, a voice resounded in the sky, “Little Mo, let them come see me.”

It was a woman’s voice.

The young woman frowned slightly upon hearing the voice, and it was obvious that she wasn’t willing to do as the voice said. But she didn’t attack. She just glanced coldly at Yang Ye and said, “Let me tell you that everything you possess is mine. It’s all mine!” As soon as she finished speaking, she waved her right hand, and the multicolored python instantly transformed into a small snake that coiled on her arm before her figure vanished into the distance.

Zi’er spoke softly, “Should we go?”

“Of course!” Yang Ye took a deep breath. He’d been exposed. Flee? Why would he flee? The owner of the voice clearly had no intent to kill him. Otherwise, the Voider Realm demon beasts in the surroundings would have swarmed him. Moreover, he wanted to find out if it was the human race’s Nie Clan that was plotting something or did the demon race really intend to attack the human race!

Yang Ye took Zi’er’s hand and followed the young woman. Yang Ye didn’t know if the young woman was doing it intentionally or not, but her speed was extremely swift to the point she almost shook off Yang Ye and Zi’er. Fortunately, Yang Ye had Blink. Otherwise, she might have really left them far behind.

After flying past countless mountain ranges, a huge city finally appeared within their fields of vision. The city was huge, extremely huge. Just the city walls were over 3km tall, and they were even larger than many mountains.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “The demon race actually has a city as well!”

Zi’er said, “The human race is very smart. Their bodies are incomparable to the demon race, but they are much superior to the demon race in many other aspects. For example, medicinal pills, cities, formations, and various other things. So, the demon race learned from the humans in the end. But it was quite difficult. After all, it’s difficult to change the nature of demon beasts. However, the demon beasts here have clearly learned well.”

Yang Ye nodded. The demon beast wasn’t terrifying, but a cultured demon race was terrifying. They’d seen some demon beasts from afar, all along the way. All of them were very disciplined and were completely unlike the demon race in Pine Prefecture of the Radiant Dimension. The demon race’s overall strength was superior to humans. If they were united and disciples, then the human race would have no further advantages before the demon race.

“Let’s go!” Yang Ye shot towards the entrance of the city while bringing Zi’er along with him.

The city gates were wide open, and there were no demon beasts guarding it. So, Yang Ye just led Zi’er into the city.

It was huge!

Absolutely huge!

The city had very few buildings, and there were merely a few in the surroundings. So, the city was very wide, like a huge plain.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and then continued forward with Zi’er. All along the way, there were demon beasts that glanced at them occasionally, but they merely glanced at Yang Ye’s group and didn’t walk over. It didn’t take long for a palace to appear before them.

Suddenly, a black shadow shot over from afar and descended before Yang Ye and Zi’er.

Bang!

The entire ground shook violently.

Yang Ye and Zi’er stopped moving. A robust man had appeared before them. His figure was extremely robust and at least double Yang Ye’s height. Besides that, his entire body was covered in muscles and filled with strength.

The robust man’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye. A moment later, he vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Yang Ye when his figure appeared again. After that, a fist slammed down towards Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then Heaven’s Gravestone appeared in his grasp before he swung it.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s sword shook violently while he took around 10 steps back. As for the robust man, he’d moved over 30m back. A vicious glow flashed through the robust man’s eyes, and he was about to attack again. However, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was in front of the robust man when his figure appeared again. At the same time, a sword pressed against the robust man’s forehead.

The robust man’s figure instantly stiffened, and he didn’t dare move a muscle.

Meanwhile, a voice resounded from within the palace, “A’Man, I told you. Regardless of whether it’s the human race or the demon race, no one in the younger generation is a match for him. Now, you believe me, right?!”

The robust man cupped his fist at Yang Ye before moving aside.

Yang Ye nodded, and then he led Zi’er into the palace.

There was only a single woman within the hall in the palace, and Yang Ye was instantly stunned upon catching sight of her, “How could this be possible? You are....”
