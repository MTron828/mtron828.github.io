Chapter 2744 – The Sword of Order!

The sword cultivator moved his gaze away and continued forward.

He wasn’t angry. Conversely, he was very happy.

A short while later, the sword cultivator had vanished into the distance.

The boundless starry sky was calm and peaceful.

…

In an abandoned world. A man glanced behind himself, and there was a golden statue over 3km tall behind him!

It was Heng Wangu!

The entire world had been fully absorbed by him.

Suddenly, Heng Wangu turned around, and the space there split open before a voice came from within, “Congratulations.”

Heng Wangu chuckled, “Thank you for your guidance.”

Meanwhile, a strand of black energy suddenly flashed out of the spatial rift. Heng Wangu’s eyes narrowed slightly while a trace of vigilance filled them. However, he didn’t stop it and allowed the black energy to enter his body.

A short while later, his body started to tremble.

A pitch black armor gradually appeared around him.

Heng Wangu gazed ahead and was quite puzzled, “What is this?”

The voice explained, “The Ancient Devil Armor. It will be helpful if you ever fight Yang Ye in closer quarters.”

Heng Wangu nodded and didn’t refuse it.

Yang Ye was extremely formidable in close quarters. Coupled with the fact that he had the swords of Destiny, it could be said that even now that Heng Wangu’s strength had improved tremendously, he still didn’t dare to be careless against Yang Ye.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The voice suddenly said, “Let’s go!”

Heng Wangu nodded slightly and entered the spatial rift. A short while later, it closed and vanished.

Along with Heng Wangu’s departure, the world started to collapse…

The End World.

At a pitch black cave, a sword shook violently, and it was madly absorbing the black energy seeping out from the surroundings.

It was Burial!

Suddenly, a figure entered the cave. It was the Dark Lord, and the Dark Lord said, “Congratulations, Master, on your successful sword trial.”

Trial!

Actually, the End World had attacked Yang Ye just to try the sword!

A voice resounded in the cave, “Heaven Executor isn’t the strongest among her swords, it’s Justice. And there’s the joint form of the four swords… However, since it could shatter a sword of Destiny, I presume it won’t be much more difficult to destroy Justice. But it’s far from enough.”

The Dark Lord asked, “Why didn’t you kill Yang Ye earlier?”

It was what the people of the End World didn’t understand at all. After all, this existence before the Dark Lord had fully suppressed Yang Ye.

The voice resounded, “Do all of you still not understand?”

The Dark Lord frowned slightly, “Please enlighten me, Master.”

The voice explained, “All four forms of Destiny have gone away and have not shown themselves. Why? Because of Yang Ye. They are testing him. But if we kill Yang Ye, we will have to face Destiny. But while Yang Ye remains alive, Destiny won’t show herself. That’s an opportunity for us. Because I need time.”

The Dark Lord spoke softly, “I see!”

The voice added, “I only attacked him to test the strength of my sword. Obviously, it can destroy Destiny’s swords. Unfortunately, if I had the Good Sprite and Evil Beast to be used as the sword’s sprite, then its strength would definitely rise explosively. It’s such a pity!”

The Dark Lord shook her head. If she was being honest, then besides this existence before her, no one could suppress Yang Ye now.

Especially when Yang Ye has a group of experts by his side now!

None of them were ordinary!

The Dark Lord seemed to have thought of something and asked, “What do we do now?”

“Improve your strength!” The voice continued, “Tell Zuo Mu to come here.”

The Dark Lord nodded and left.

A short while later, Zuo Mu entered the cave. He frowned slightly and clearly didn’t like this place.

The voice said, “Do you know why your saber cannot improve?”

Zuo Mu shook his head.

The voice replied, “You have conviction and talent, but you lack something.”

Zuo Mu gazed toward the source of the voice, and it said, “I know you held back, so show it to me!”

Zuo Mu shook his head, “It’s a move I’ve kept only for Destiny.”

Only for Destiny!

The voice laughed coldly, “How laughable! You can’t even kill Yang Ye, so how can you fight Destiny?”

Zuo Mu fell silent.

The voice said, “That’s where you’re inferior. You conceal your ability. Yang Ye always uses his full strength in battle against you, so he’s always challenging his limits. Thus, he is always improving himself. But up until now, you’ve been staying on the same spot, haven’t you?”

Zuo Mu remained silent.

The voice continued, “If you don’t give it your all, how would you surpass your limits?”

Zuo Mu looked ahead, “Who are you?”

The voice fell silent.

The entire cave was silent too.

Zuo Mu asked, “You can’t say?”

Suddenly, a strand of black energy entered his forehead, and then Zuo Mu shuddered, “Y-You’re…”

A few breaths of time later, the cave fell silent.

…

Paradise City.

Paradise City was naturally Yang Ye’s newly-built city. It was quite an ordinary name, Paradise City.

A large hall had been built within the city, and some other halls were being built in succession all around it.

Yang Ye and the others were seated facing each other in the hall.

Presently, there was only the Past Life Clan, the Martial Sky Clan, and the Yang Clan here. Besides that, no one else had come to the city.

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “I’m sure you’re aware of the End World’s rough strength now, so I won’t say much. The most difficult to deal with in the End World is that black hand. Besides that, there’s Emperor Li, First God, Zuo Mu, Sky Saber, and another mysterious black clothed figure…”

Yang Ye paused for a moment at this point.

Because he knew who the mysterious black clothed figure was!

It was the Darkspace’s Dark Lord!

Yang Ye didn’t quite believe it when the mysterious expert on the other end of the transmission stone told him about it. After all, the Dark Lord had always maintained neutrality and had even helped him!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and continued, “Besides them, the End World has one more expert, Heng Wangu. He hasn’t shown himself in a long time, and he’s a very unstable element.”

Yang Ye chuckled at this point and added, “We aren’t in a very good situation. Of course, it isn’t very bad either.”

Meanwhile, the Yang Clan’s grand elder spoke abruptly, “We have the Sprite Progenitor, so we can gather the help of the experts from all over the universe. We’ll have a better chance by doing that.”

Yang Ye nodded. Those people couldn’t be overlooked. Even though they were of no threat to the End World on their own, it would be different if they were gathered together. Similarly, if they took the End World’s side, it would be very bad for his side.

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while, and then he gazed at the Yang Clan’s grand elder, “Grand Elder, I’ll leave that to you. Tell those undecided fellows that if they are willing to overcome this difficult situation with us, I will definitely share the rewards that come from it. However, if they do not help now and just wish to reap the rewards, they are dreaming.”

The grand elder nodded and left.

Yang Ye gazed at Yan Wu, “Brother Yan Wu, I’ll leave the Formation Daoist to you.”

Yan Wu nodded, “I’ll go over now!”

He turned around and left the hall.

Yang Ye indicated that the others should leave, and only he remained in the hall!

Yang Ye returned to the Primordial Pagoda.

On the Ascension Platform, Snowy gazed at the fragments of Heaven Executor and seemed quite unhappy.

Heaven Executor wasn’t the same sword it used to be. Its sprite had been personally fostered by Snowy, but someone had destroyed it!

She couldn’t endure such a thing!

Snowy clenched her paws and seemed like she was about to go to war.

Yang Ye rubbed her head and smiled, “Don’t be angry. In any case, you can repair it, right?”

Snowy nodded and waved her paw. A moment later, the fragments started to converge together rapidly.

A short while later, Snowy suddenly ran over to Erya, and the latter had an absolute headache upon seeing Snowy.

Erya thought for a moment and said, “Snowy, I have very few scales.”

Snowy shook her head and waved her paws to say that she wasn’t here for Erya’s scales.

Erya was quite curious, “Then what do you want?”

Snowy pointed at her horns with excitement all over her face.

Erya’s face immediately darkened. If it wasn’t Snowy who was asking, she would have slammed a punch at the person.

In the end, Erya had no choice but to go to Yang Ye. She was very, very close to Snowy, but she really couldn’t let Snowy do as she pleased to her horns!

Erya went to Yang Ye, and Snowy cracked a smile before pointing at Erya’s horns. She was saying that it was very strong and could go head-on against that sword.

Yang Ye chuckled, “Those horns are very important to Erya. It’ll harm her if we pull them off. Understand?”

Snowy blinked, gazed at Erya, and then waved her paws to say that she didn’t want them anymore.

Obviously, Erya was very, very important to her.

Snowy asked Erya for two more scales before leaving.

Erya gazed at Snowy and said, “Big Brother Yang, that hand was very powerful.”

Yang Ye nodded.

Erya continued, “It felt familiar to me. I’m sure I knew its owner.”

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she looked up at the sky with a slightly bewildered look in her eyes, “I can sense some unknown existences now. All of them are very strong!”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly.

If Erya said they were strong, then they were definitely extremely strong. He knew that he didn’t have much time left.

A short while later, Yang Ye went to the Ascension Platform. Snowy was still forging Heaven Executor!

Yang Ye’s heart suddenly hurt as he gazed at Snowy working so seriously with anxiety all over her face.

He walked over, hugged her gently, and smiled, “Little fellow, if the user isn’t strong, even the strongest strong would be useless.”

He gazed at the almost fully reforged Heaven Executor and said, “It’s not you who is weak, it is me.”

He waved his right hand, and numerous swords flew over to him.

The five element swords, the Sword Supreme, Sword Precursor, Heaven Executor, Past Life, and Great Unknown were all here!

Yang Ye suddenly smiled as he gazed at the swords before him, “I’ve been thinking about a lot these few days. Besides the Sword Precursor, all the rest of you were given to me by someone else. You represent someone else’s Sword Dao, not mine.”

He looked up at the sky, “Heaven Executor focuses on killing, Past Life focuses on purification, Great Unknown is space, Sword Supreme is righteousness, the five element swords are the five elements, the Sword Precursor focuses on the heart… The world is chaotic. I wish to build a new order. Are all of you willing to abandon your past and follow me?”

A sword suddenly entered Yang Ye’s forehead.

The Sword Precursor!

The others did not move!

A short while later, Yang Ye raised his palm, and the blood red Sword Precursor was in it. He chuckled, “From now on, your name is Order. The sword of Order! You rule the order of the world!”
