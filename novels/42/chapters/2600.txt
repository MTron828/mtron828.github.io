Chapter 2601

The fluffy little fellow gazed at the young girl, and the latter continued, “If it succeeds, the wagon with four wheels will be ours, and we can get everything you like.”

The fluffy little fellow’s eyes lit up upon hearing her.

It didn’t take long for her to unconditionally support the young girl’s thoughts and actions!

Just like that, they entered the shop.

Queue up!

They were queueing up as necessary!

Finally, it was the young girl’s turn. A pretty woman was in charge of entertaining the young girl.

The woman smiled and said, “Young girl, what do you need?”

The young girl raised two fingers, “I want 100,000 of those red papers!”

The woman’s face froze.

It didn’t take long for her to grin, “Young girl, are you here on your own? Where are you parents?”

The young girl frowned slightly, “Can’t I be here on my own? Don’t worry, I can take them with me.”

The fluffy little fellow on the young girl’s shoulder nodded to display that there was no need to worry. They could take it all!

They could take anything with them!

The woman glanced at the young girl and little fellow before her, and her gaze stopped on the fluffy little fellow for a short moment.

What a cute pet!

Meanwhile, the young girl became quite impatient, “Hurry up and give it to me. I have to get that big guy!”

The woman moved her gaze away and looked at the young girl, “Young girl, where’s your card? You must give me a card before I can withdraw money for you!”

“Card?” The young girl frowned, “What card?”

At this moment, the woman had slight vigilance on her face.

Meanwhile, the young girl suddenly glanced to the right, and the man to her right passed the woman a card. A moment later, the woman returned the card to the woman, and besides the card, she gave him a thick stack of red paper!

The young girl blinked, and then she gazed at the woman, “Um, I don’t have a card. Right, can you lend me some money? I don’t need much, just like 100,000 of those red papers. I’ll definitely return it to you!”

The woman was speechless.

…

Eternal Kingdom. The War Dimension.

Yang Ye didn’t stay in the War Dimension and went to the abyss north of it.

It was the place Qi Bitian used to reside at!

Yang Ye jumped down, and it didn’t take long for him to reach the bottom.

Meanwhile, two old men appeared before him.

It was Sha Ji and Cang Mu!

Yang Ye asked, “Where is she?”

Cang Mu glanced at Yang Ye, “She’s gone somewhere.”

Yang Ye wanted to ask more about it, but Cang Mu shook his head, “Fighting that day exposed her whereabouts. Now, she isn’t in a good situation, and don’t ask about it either. She can interfere in your problems, but you can’t interfere in her problems. So, leave.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he cupped his hands and left.

Just as Cang Mu had said, if Qi Bitian had enemies, it wouldn’t be something he could interfere in. He would only be a burden to her!

Once Yang Ye left, Cang Mu sighed softly, “We shouldn’t have let her leave!”

Sha Ji spoke coldly, “If it wasn’t for you, I would have killed that kid. If it wasn’t for him, our master wouldn’t have been pursued by Destiny again. After countless years of effort to stay hidden, it was all wasted because of him. I really want to kill him!”

Cang Mu shook his head, “She was very well aware of the consequences, but she still did it. It proves that she thinks highly of him. If you kill him, wouldn’t she have done it all for naught?”

Sha Ji shook his head, “I should have killed him the day he came here. Sigh…”

…

Yang Ye left the abyss.

He didn’t stay in War Dimension and left for the Central Region.

The Xing Clan was the largest clan in the Central Region, and it could be considered as the strongest region of Eternal Kingdom.

Because the Eternal Lord resided here.

As soon as Yang Ye arrived outside Xing Heaven City, an old man appeared before him.

A peak Lord Realm expert!

The old man glanced at him and spoke indifferently, “May I know what the great Sect Master Ye is doing here?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m just an ordinary person. I’m here to see an old friend.”

The old man shook his head, “No one in my clan is a friend of yours!”

Yang Ye spoke frankly, “I want to see Xing Biqing!”

The old man shook his head, “She isn’t free right now, so you can leave.”

Yang Ye glanced at the old man, and then he appeared in front of the latter. The old man’s expression changed drastically, and he was about to attack when countless strands of sword intent and sword energy suddenly condensed around Yang Ye!

The Sword Domain Sphere!

As soon as it appeared, that part of the city walls was obliterated, and then the old man was blasted away. Only his soul was blasted away as his body had been grounded to bits!

The old man gazed at Yang Ye with horror, “You…”

At this moment, he was beyond shocked!

He was a peak Lord Realm expert!

But Yang Ye was only at the Lord Realm. But as soon as they fought, he’d been immediately crushed in the first clash between them!

Yang Ye is already this strong?

Yang Ye glanced at the old man and said, “I’m mainly here to see my friend. Of course, if I can’t see her, then my objective may change. For example, I’ll kill a few people for fun!”

The old man’s face instantly turned unsightly.

Meanwhile, two flying swords suddenly appeared on both sides of Yang Ye.

There was no sword energy or sword intent on them!

But they were absolutely oppressive!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, but he still didn’t see the figure he wished to see.

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “Then I’ll kill!”

As soon as he said that, two sword howls resounded, and the swords shot at the old man’s soul.

The old man was horrified. He wasn’t from the Soul Sect, so he hadn’t grown stronger from losing his body.

How could he possibly resist these two swords?

Suddenly, those two flying swords stopped abruptly, and they were just a meter away from the old man.

Yang Ye looked to the right. A woman was standing there.

Xing Biqing!

Xing Biqing smiled, “Long time no see. You’re much stronger now. Congratulations!”

Yang Ye scanned her and said, “They didn’t make things difficult for you, right?”

She shook her head, “I’m just not being the patriarch anymore.”

Yang Ye nodded, “That’s good to hear.”

She suddenly invited him, “Want to come in?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’d prefer not to.”

As he spoke, he looked into the distance, “Out of consideration for Biqing, I’ll come to the Xing Clan last. I hope you can give me a satisfactory answer when I come back. Otherwise, my sword will teach you how to act.”

Yang Ye gazed at Xing Biqing and continued, “No matter what happens between me and the Xing Clan, we’ll always be friends.”

Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

Three swords followed closely behind him.

Executor was in the lead!

The three swords shot through the sky and sliced it open!

Xing Biqing fell silent on the spot.

She knew that if she hadn’t shown herself, then Yang Ye’s swords would have definitely descended into the city.

Based on his current strength and the Executor which had fully acknowledged him as its master, no one in the Xing Clan besides the Eternal Lord could stop him!

No expert in the Lord Realm could stop Yang Ye!

Xing Biqing sighed softly while worry filled her eyes.

Yang Ye was too strong and too terrifying right now!

Especially when he wielded a Super Divine Treasure. Most importantly, it had acknowledged him as its master. Under such circumstances, normal Lord Realm experts were no match for him, or it should be said that Lord Realm experts were nothing before him!

Only Destiny Realm experts could suppress Yang Ye!

If Yang Ye attacked the Xing Clan, then coupled with the help of his own backing, it could be described as a nightmare for the Xing Clan!

Because once the Eternal Lord was unable to help, the Xing Clan could do nothing but be slaughtered by him!

Xing Biqing sighed and left.

Yang Ye returned to the West Region. He didn’t return to the Ancient Sword Sect, and he went to a boundless mountain range instead.

Yang Ye looked down. The mountain range simply stretched boundlessly beyond the reaches of his view!

Yang Ye moved his gaze away, and then a ray of light descended from the sky.

Hiss!

Sharp sounds of something being sliced apart resounded, and the entire sky seemed as if it had been sliced into two!

It didn’t take long for a pitch black palace to appear before Yang Ye.

The palace floated in midair like a floating city, and it emanated a bone-piercing cold glow.

Meanwhile, a black robed figure appeared before Yang Ye.

It was the woman with the Space Domain from the Soul Sect!

She stared at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, you’re truly brave to actually come here in person. I’m truly…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

The woman’s pupils constricted, and then the space before her shook and compressed upon itself to form a thick spatial wall! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Her attainments in spatial techniques were truly extraordinary!

However, along with a flash of light, the thick spatial wall was obliterated!

A short moment later, a sword arrived before her.

Meanwhile, her figure turned ethereal. Just like that, the sword pierced through her, but she was completely unharmed!

She wasn’t in this space anymore!

She gazed at Yang Ye and laughed coldly, “Yang Ye, do you think you’re the only one who’s growing? I…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared before her, and then a sword appeared in his grasp.

Executor!

It stabbed forward!

The Domain Sword!

It instantly stabbed through her body, but she was still completely unharmed. But just a moment later, the expression on her face changed drastically!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The space where Yang Ye’s sword descended shook before turning ethereal, and then it was obliterated. Once it was obliterated, a huge black hole was formed, but even the black hole was being obliterated. In the end, it was transformed into a void.

Meanwhile, the woman’s body appeared before Yang Ye!

At the same time, Yang Ye’s sword pressed against her throat.

He’d crushed it with overwhelming strength!

She stared at him, “How could you have possibly…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s sword spun slightly.

Hiss!

A gorgeous head flew up into the air while accompanied by an arc of blood.

Yang Ye lowered his sword and shook his head, “I only want to kill today, I have no interest in talking!”
