Chapter 1672 - Take Responsibility?

Translator: InVader

Dragons had a reverse scale and touching it would incur the wrath of the dragon.

What was Yang Ye’s reverse scale?

His loved ones!

Yang Ye had thought that while they held ill intent towards him, he had no need to act against them. After all, while they were using him, he was using them as well. So, he’d never acted against them.

But this time, they actually planned to target Su Qingshi and the others, and that was something he couldn’t tolerate.

So, he’d decisively attacked.

He didn’t care if they were marshals! All he cared about was killing them!

Gu Xiu naturally had to flee. While he was one of the seven marshals, Yang Ye didn’t just possess Zenith Rank slaughter intent, Yang Ye possessed terrifying attainments in the Laws of Darkness and that mysterious woman, An Nanjing.

If he was all alone, it was utterly impossible for him to stop the joint forces of Yang Ye and An Nanjing.

So, he’d decisively chosen to flee!

It didn’t take long for Gu Xiu to stop because Yang Ye had suddenly appeared before him.

Gu Xiu stared at Yang Ye. He didn’t waste his breath and immediately formed a strange seal, and then started chanting incessantly. In next to no time, the shoes beneath Yang Ye’s feet started to tremble. However, Yang Ye suddenly placed them within the Primordial Pagoda!

As soon as that happened, Gu Xiu was stunned. Meanwhile, the shoes appeared on Yang Ye’s feet again. Gu Xiu glanced at Yang Ye, and then he continued chanting. However, the shoes didn’t react at all.

At this moment, Gu Xiu’s expression became extremely unsightly. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye naturally wouldn’t waste his breath because all it would do was waste time. He had to kill Gu Xiu as soon as possible. Because the experts of the Yang Clan would definitely interfere, so he had to kill Gu Xiu before that happened!

A cold glow flashed through Gu Xiu’s eyes when Yang Ye vanished, and then he flicked his palm forward.

Bang!

A terrifying wave of energy surged out like a torrent, and then the space before him started rippling violently.

However, Yang Ye’s sword energy took a mere instant to tear the space apart, and then countless rays of powerful sword energy slammed down towards Gu Xiu.

Rumble!

Numerous explosions resounded. Gu Xiu was pushed backwards repeatedly, and he was pushed over 3km back before he finally stopped himself. At this moment, his entire body was covered in over a dozen injuries, but none were lethal!

As soon as he stopped, Yang Ye appeared in front of him, and then a sword swept down towards his head.

16 overlapped Heavenrends!

Gu Xiu’s expression changed slightly, and then a huge yellow shield appeared above him.

Bang!

As soon as Yang Ye’s attack struck it, the shield cracked apart, and the power force of the collision blasted Gu Xiu away.

Yang Ye immediately stomped his right foot down and shot forward like a bolt of lightning.

Gu Xiu’s expression changed drastically when he saw Yang Ye’s figure vanish. His profound energy surged madly into the huge shield, and then he tossed the shield at Yang Ye.

When it arrived a little over a meter away from Yang Ye, it shook violently and exploded apart.

Boom!

A terrifying wave of energy swept out from the explosion. Yang Ye was the first to bear the brunt of it, and he was pushed backwards repeatedly. But he’d only been pushed over 30m back when he suddenly stomped his right foot down, and he transformed into a ray of light that shot towards Gu Xiu.

Everywhere it passed, the wave of energy was sliced open, and it only took a moment for him to arrive before Gu Xiu again.

At this moment, Gu Xiu had a calm expression on his face, and he didn’t seem fearful at all.

Because an old man had appeared before Gu Xiu.

It was the Discipline Hall’s Master, Yang Lu!

Yang Lu stretched out his right hand and shook it lightly.

Bang!

A wave of energy instantly slammed against Yang Ye’s sword, causing it to shake violently, and then Yang Ye was blasted over 3km away.

Yang Ye looked down at his numb arm, and then he looked up at Yang Lu. His face fell when he saw Yang Lu. It was because he was too slow.

Yang Lu glanced indifferently at Yang Ye, “What are you doing now?”

Yang Ye gazed at Gu Xiu, “He wants to kill me!”

Gu Xiu’s eyelids twitched, “What nonsense! Yang Ye, you attacked me for no reason, and now you’re making false accusations against me? Do you know no shame?!”

Yang Lu glanced at Gu Xiu, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “I didn’t see him trying to kill you, and I only saw you trying to kill me.

Meanwhile, Gu Xiu added, “Hall Master Lu, he isn’t just trying to kill me, he has killed Marshal Qian Hu. Hall Master Lu, please punish him according to the rules of the clan!”

Yang Lu’s eyes instantly narrowed slightly when he heard Gu Xiu, and then he looked down at Yang Xuan’s room. It didn’t take long for gloominess to cover his face. He looked up at Yang Ye and said, “You killed her!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I have.”

Yang Lu stared at Yang Ye, “Do you really think you can do as you please in the Yang Clan?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’ve never thought like that. After all, you’re here.”

Yang Lu asked, “Then why?”

Yang Ye replied, “Gu Xiu and Qian Hu came to me and said that they want to side with me. Actually, it was to control me. However, when they noticed my strength was growing, they felt that they couldn’t control me with ease any longer. So, they wanted to capture my loved ones and use them to threaten me. I was hiding and heard their conversation, so I attacked. That’s what happened.”

Yang Lu frowned slightly when he heard Yang Ye, and then he gazed at Gu Xiu. Gu Xiu was about to speak, but a black shadow suddenly charged up from below. It was extremely swift and instantly arrived in front of Yang Lu, and then a bolt of lightning flashed.

Yang Lu’s eyes narrowed slightly. He immediately raised his fist and punched.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and Yang Lu’s figure was pushed 300m back.

Suddenly, a shrill cry resounded from the side.

Yang Lu looked over, and then his face fell. Because Gu Xiu’s head was flying through the air.

As for the black shadow, that person had transformed into a ray of black light that had shot off into the distance.

“Where do you think you’re going?!” Yang Lu roared with fury and clawed with his right hand. In an instant, an ethereal palm tore through space and claws at the black shadow.

Suddenly, the black shadow stopped, and then it turned around and attacked.

Hiss!

A bolt of lightning flashed.

Boom!

The ethereal palm Yang Lu created was sliced open by the lightning, and the lightning instantly arrived before Yang Lu.

Yang Lu’s eyes narrowed slightly. He clenched his right fist and slammed it forward, causing a terrifying wave of energy to surge out from his fist.

Bang!

The lightning was dispersed, but Yang Lu was pushed over 30m away!

Meanwhile, the black shadow had vanished.

Yang Lu’s face instantly became extremely unsightly. He hadn’t expected that someone would actually dare to kill right in front of him, and that person had even escaped.

He remained silent for an instant, and then he suddenly looked up at Yang Ye. At the same time, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Actually, I didn’t kill Qian Hu, it was that person. That person is the one pulling the strings. That person killed them, so go look for that fellow!”

Actually, Yang Ye was extremely shocked as well.

He hadn’t expected that black shadow to suddenly appear and kill Gu Xiu. But it did make sense. He’d exposed Gu Xiu just now. Regardless of whether Yang Lu believed him, Yang Lu might still investigate Gu Xiu. That person from before was clearly aware of that, so for safety’s sake, that person had chosen to kill Gu Xiu to keep him quiet!

Yang Lu gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he asked, “Why didn’t you do anything just now?”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he quickly shook his head, “I’m no match for all of you!” What a joke! He wished for nothing more than to see Gu Xiu die. So, how could he possibly help?

Yang Lu gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then he asked, “Do you know who that was?”

Yang Ye shook his head again, “I really don’t know. However, that person is the one who was giving Gu Xiu orders from the shadows. So, er… your Discipline Hall should investigate. Because I feel like someone in the Yang Clan wants to rebel!”

“Rebel?” Yang Lu laughed coldly, “Do you think it’s that easy?”

Yang Ye shrugged, “I’m just giving you a kind warning. As for whether you investigate or not, that’s your business. I have other matters to attend to. Farewell.”

As he spoke, Yang Ye turned around and left.

Suddenly, Yang Lu appeared in front of him, “You’re leaving just like that after two marshals died without for no reason?”

Yang Ye shrugged, “That has nothing to do with me… I didn’t kill Gu Xiu. You saw who killed him. You can’t blame it on me, right?”

Yang Lu shook his head slightly and spoke indifferently, “Someone has to take responsibility for it. It's impossible for me to do that, right?”

Yang Ye’s face fell, “Old man, I’m telling you that if you try to force me, then I’ll cause even more trouble for you.”

Yang Lu suddenly said, “There are benefits!”

Yang Ye’s eyes lit up, “Benefits? What benefits?”

Yang Lu replied, “Very good benefits!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Er… about that… Taking responsibility isn’t entirely out of the question…”
