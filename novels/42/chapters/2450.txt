Chapter 2451 – Invincible Body!

She planned to break the sword!

Yang Ye watched as Erya used all the strength within her as she tried to break Executor!

However, how could a Super Divine Treasure be broken just like that?

A vicious glow arose in her eyes when she realized that it wouldn’t break! She suddenly looked up at Yang Ye, and then she hurled Executor at him.

Hiss!

A ray of light flashed!

Her powerful physical strength combined with Executor’s sharpness caused space to be sliced open like paper before it.

Yang Ye didn’t dare to act carelessly and took a step forward.

The Sword Domain!

As soon as the Sword Domain appeared, Executor immediately slowed down, and then he grabbed its hilt.

However, his face was quite pale!

Erya’s strength was too terrifying!

Meanwhile, Erya suddenly vanished on the spot. Yang Ye’s expression changed from the sight of this, and he hurriedly said, “Erya, calm down! Calm down…”

She ignored everything he said!

She arrived before him and clawed at Yang Ye’s head.

Yang Ye didn’t go head-on against it. He tapped the tip of his foot against the ground and moved over 100m away! Erya roared with fury when she saw him retreat, and then she stomped her right foot down.

Bang!

The Ascension Platform shook violently while Erya appeared at the edge of the Ascension Platform, and then she kicked its edge.

Boom!

The Ascension Platform flew at Yang Ye!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly as he took a quick stride forward and stabbed his sword at it. It forced the huge Ascension Platform to a stop!

On the other side of the platform, Erya suddenly leaped up and kicked the platform again!

Bam! Bam! Bam!

Yang Ye and the Ascension Platform were pushed backward repeatedly.

Erya was about to attack again when An Nanjing suddenly appeared in front of her, and the latter just gazed indifferently at Erya!

“Don’t harm her!” Yang Ye’s voice resounded from the side!

As soon as he said that, Erya slammed her claw at An Nanjing.

An Nanjing’s spear shot forward!

It stabbed against the center of Erya’s palm.

Bang!

An Nanjing was pushed almost 300m back, and her right hand was trembling!

An Nanjing frowned slightly.

What is that strength of hers?

Yang Ye spoke solemnly by An Nanjing’s side, “Her strength is still growing! Besides that, watch out for her claws. They can even tear apart Divine Treasures!”

An Nanjing thought deeply for a moment and said, “Let’s join forces!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she put down her spear and dashed at Erya!

An instant later, she was in front of Erya, and she slammed a punch at Erya!

Erya revealed no fear when she saw An Nanjing’s punch approach, and she just clawed at the latter’s fist. However, right when An Nanjing’s fist was about to slam against Erya’s claw, her fist unfurled into a palm and moved slightly to the right. Erya clawed nothing but air, and before she could even pulled her hand back, An Nanjing suddenly grabbed her wrist. An Nanjing pulled Erya toward her and slammed a punch against Erya’s chest!

Bang!

Erya was blasted around 30m away, but An Nanjing was pushed over 300m back!

As soon as she stopped herself, Yang Ye appeared in front of Erya, and the vicious glow in Erya’s eyes grew stronger! She didn’t say a single word and just slammed herself at Yang Ye!

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. He didn’t dare to get hit by Erya’s body. After all, her body was too terrifying!

A ray of sword energy vanished and Yang Ye vanished on the spot!

It didn’t take long for them to get locked in combat!

Both Yang Ye and An Nanjing didn’t dare to fight seriously. Because if they did, it was very likely to hurt Erya. But if they didn’t fight seriously, then they were helpless against Erya! Her physical strength and defenses were simply abnormal! Especially that pair of claws. Both Yang Ye and An Nanjing didn’t dare to go head-on against those claws! Because even if they avoided death, they would be injured by them!

After all, they could even destroy Divine Treasures!

Meanwhile, Oxxy, Sword Scroll, the Primal Vicious Tiger, the Martial Qilin, and the Primal True Dragon were spectating from the side.

Or it should be said that all the demon beasts had their attention focused on Erya.

She was terrifying!

Even the Primal True Dragon was extremely well convinced of Erya’s strength. Both her strength and defense were far superior to it! If it was made to fight Erya, especially when she was in this abnormal state, it knew it had no chance to win!

Erya’s bloodline had a suppressing effect on demon beasts!

Even though she was tiny, she was the elder sister in all their hearts. An elder sister who should never be offended.

As for Snowy, she was the great lord! She could absolutely not be offended!

As she watched the three of them enter a deadlock and Erya growing stronger as the battle progressed, Sword Scroll fell silent for a moment before looking at Oxxy, “Where’s Snowy? Bring her here to make them stop!”

Snowy! Where was Snowy?

Only now did they notice that the great lord herself wasn’t here!

Meanwhile, Oxxy vanished because he knew where Snowy was!

Oxxy flew to the rear mountains of the Sword Sect, and he saw Snowy in the forest there. At this moment, Snowy was snoring above the Chaotic Fruit Trees. The trees were holding her up and rocking her lightly like a cradle.

There were six fist-sized fruits on the trees!

They were about to ripen!

It took Oxxy a huge amount of willpower to move his gaze from the fruits, and then he walked over to Snowy and tapped Snowy’s head with a finger.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Snowy wasn’t affected by it at all and just continued snoring.

Oxxy hesitated for a moment and said, “Trea… sure…”

In an instant, Snowy shuddered and opened her eyes!

Oxxy was stunned speechless.

…

At the Ascension Platform, all three of them were still locked in battle.

Actually, if Yang Ye and An Nanjing were to fight seriously, Erya would probably be finished by now. While her body was extremely strong and so was her physical strength, Yang Ye and An Nanjing weren’t weak! Both of them hadn’t dared to really attack with the intent to kill, nor did they dare to target her vital points. But when they didn’t fight seriously, they discovered that Erya was really too difficult to deal with!

Erya was growing more and more excited as the battle progressed!

Obviously, she was treating them as her sparring partners!

Meanwhile, Snowy arrived on Oxxy’s shoulder.

Snowy’s eyes opened wide when she saw Yang Ye, An Nanjing, and Erya in battle, and they were filled with excitement.

All the other demon beasts were utterly speechless when they noticed her reaction.

Snowy didn’t try to stop them. As far as she was concerned, all of them were just playing!

Meanwhile, Erya was growing more and more excited. Once she slammed both Yang Ye and An Nanjing away with her punches, she suddenly spoke excitedly, “Come on! Bring it! Big Sister An, Big Brother Yang, let’s continue…”

As soon as she spoke up to this point, Erya seemed to have thought of something and hurriedly shut her mouth! She blinked and gazed at them while a bad feeling arose in her.

At the same time, Yang Ye and An Nanjing exchanged glances. Obviously, the little bastard had regained consciousness a long time ago!

An Nanjing suddenly gazed at Erya, and a spear appeared in her grasp. A moment later, she took a step forward and instantly arrived just a few meters away from Erya.

Her spear shot forward!

A spear of belief!

It carried An Nanjing’s matchless belief in the Martial Dao!

Erya’s expression changed drastically, and she swung her right claw at it!

The spear and claw collided!

Bang!

Erya was blasted away, but An Nanjing didn’t move at all!

Meanwhile, at the instant Erya was blasted away, a ray of sword energy flashed!

It slammed against Erya’s body!

Bang!

Erya’s figure flew even faster!

An Nanjing and Yang Ye vanished simultaneously, and Erya howled with sorrow, “Big Sister An, Big Brother Yang, I’m sorry. Let’s stop. It hurts, it really hurts…”

Yang Ye and An Nanjing stopped.

While Erya was strong, even if they were unable to pierce her defenses while they fought seriously, making it hurt was still possible. Moreover, if they fought with the aim to kill, they could pierce her defenses. Of course, they would never do that. But they could still teach her a lesson.

Erya sat on the ground and gasped for air.

She was exhausted!

Yang Ye and An Nanjing walked over to Erya, and Yang Ye asked, “Erya, what happened just now?”

Erya gazed at him, “What do you mean?”

Yang Ye replied, “I’m talking about when you went berserk earlier!”

Erya thought for a moment and shook her head, “I don’t know! In any case, I just really felt like fighting, especially you, Big Brother yang!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Sword Scroll suddenly spoke, “I may be her bloodline!”

Her bloodline!

Yang Ye gazed at Sword Scroll, “What is Erya’s bloodline?”

Sword Scroll fell silent, “I’m not sure.”

Yang Ye was about to say something when An Nanjing walked over to Erya, “From now on, you’ll learn from me!”

Erya was stunned.

Everyone else gazed at An Nanjing.

An Nanjing gazed at Erya, “Brute strength isn’t good.”

Brute strength!

Sword Scroll spoke solemnly, “Miss An is correct. Erya has matchless physical defenses and physical strength, and claws that can tear through Divine Treasures. But she doesn’t know anything about combat techniques, and she only uses brute force in battle. While absolute strength does crush everything, if she does encounter an opponent in the same level like you, Yang Ye, or Miss An, then she’ll be at a huge disadvantage. If she can learn some combat techniques, she would definitely become extremely terrifying.”

Combat techniques!

If Erya learned combat techniques from An Nanjing… Just the thought of it was terrifying!

Erya suddenly stood up, “I refuse! I want to play with Snowy. Snowy, don’t you think so too?”

An Nanjing glanced at Snowy, and the latter who was about to nod immediately shook her head. She was saying that she didn’t want to play, and she had an extremely serious expression on her face!

Erya was stunned speechless.
