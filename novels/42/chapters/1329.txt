Chapter 1330 – All 10 Halls?

The Demon Empress, Mo Xiaoleng, and 5 Voider Realm demon beasts. How could he fight such a force?

He couldn’t fight them even if the entire Sword Alliance fought with him!

So, Yang Ye had no other choice but to come to Blind Maiden.

If even Blind Maiden couldn’t stop them, then he would have no choice but to fight desperately.

Blind Maiden had clearly been quite stunned by Yang Ye’s actions, and it took some time for her to recover from her shock. After that, a wave of invisible force enveloped her arm and pushed Yang Ye’s hands away.

However, Yang Ye hurriedly grabbed her arm again and said, “Big Sister....”

“I’m not your big sister!” Blind Maiden pushed Yang Ye away again.

But just a moment passed before Yang Ye grabbed her arm again, “Third Sister, you’re Nether Maiden and the others’ third sister, so you’re my third sister too. You can’t just watch as I die!” It couldn’t be helped, when he had to choose between his life and dignity, he could only choose his life.

Blind Maiden gazed at Yang Ye for a short while before she said, “Your skin... is quite thick.”

Yang Ye’s face stiffened slightly, but it only took a moment for him to return to normal. Presently, he had resigned himself to acting shamelessly. He immediately replied, “Third Sister, I really had no other choice but to come look for you. Those fellows refuse to fight me in single combat and want to besiege me.... Look, 6 of them are attacking me. They’re really too shameless!”

“Hopeless situations can bring transformation.” As soon as Blind Maiden finished speaking, she pushed Yang Ye away again and turned to look at the ocean.

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. He knew that hopeless situations could bring about transformations, but hopeless situations could also bring death!

“I’m quite disappointed!” Suddenly, the Demon Empress spoke, “Yang Ye, I thought you were different, but I never expected that you would act like everyone else when you face death.”

Yang Ye spoke coldly, “Demon Empress, you’re fighting me 6 against 1, yet you still have the gall to say that? Have a little shame!”

“You want me to fight you in single combat?” The Demon Empress laughed coldly, “Yang Ye, that’s a very good place. Even though I don’t fear fighting you in single combat, I don’t want to give you any chances or waste time.”

As she spoke, the Demon Empress was about to attack. Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched and hurriedly spoke, “Demon Empress, you better think this through.” As he spoke, he walked over to Blind Maiden, “She is....”

“She?” The Demon Empress interrupted Yang Ye and laughed coldly, “Unless Jian Wuji is reborn, no one can save you today.” She charged at Yang Ye once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly while the Sword God’s Seal lit up on his forehead. Actually, he’d merely come to look for Blind Maiden to try his luck. Since she wasn’t willing to help, then he had no choice but to rely on himself. But right when he was about to activate the Sword God’s Seal, Yang Ye was suddenly stunned. Because while he didn’t know if the Demon Empress had done so intentionally or unintentionally, her aura had even enveloped Blind Maiden.

Yang Ye thought for a moment, and then he stood in front of Blind Maiden and spoke angrily, “Demon Empress, this is between us. It has nothing to do with her. So just come at me!”

“Since she’s a human, she should die as well!” As soon as the Demon Empress finished speaking, she slapped her palm forward from afar, and then a wave of terrifying force immediately swept towards Yang Ye and Blind Maiden.

“I’ll fight you to the death!” Yang Ye’s eyes were filled with resolve. He stomped his right foot against the ground, shot up into the sky, and then slammed his fist forward.

Bang!

As soon as they came into contact, Yang Ye’s figure was blasted away in a very exaggerated manner. The Demon Empress was slightly stunned by this as well because Yang Ye wasn’t that weak. What’s going on?

Right when the Demon Empress felt puzzled, the terrifying force she emanated had descended towards Blind Maiden.

Blind Maiden finally acted. She turned around to look at the Demon Empress, and then she stretched out her right hand and waved it lightly. Just that caused the terrifying force to be instantly wiped out. After that, she pushed her right palm forward.

Everyone here watched with astonishment as the space before Blind Maiden shook violently, and then the Demon Empress was blasted 3km away.

The Voider Realm demon beasts and Mo Xiaoleng were stunned. Obviously, they hadn’t expected that to happen.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately, Blind Maiden had acted, or he would really have to fight desperately and risk his life.

The Demon Empress had an extremely solemn expression on her face as she looked up at Blind Maiden, “Who are you?!”

“Humans should die?” Blind Maiden continued, “Don’t forget that you’re human too.”

The Demon Empress stared fixedly at Blind Maiden. A moment of silence ensued before she suddenly clawed at Blind Maiden from afar, and then a huge energy claw tore through space and clawed at Blind Maiden.

When the huge claw appeared, the ocean behind Blind Maiden started to surge before waves of water shot up into the air and into the clouds! It was absolutely shocking!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. Her strength really is quite strong!

After that, he gazed at Blind Maiden. Even though he was quite confident in her, he didn’t know anything about her true strength, so he wasn’t very sure if Blind Maiden could fight the Demon Empress’ group. If Blind Maiden couldn’t, then he would have done something bad because it was equivalent to bringing harm to Blind Maiden.

Once he thought up to this point, Yang Ye had decided in his heart — if Blind Maiden couldn’t fight the Demon Empress’ group, then he would improve his sword intent to the Quasi Returnal Rank and ignite his soul!

Nether Maiden had a calm expression on her face. She twisted her right hand slightly and tapped her finger upwards when the huge claw arrived above her.

Bang!

The huge energy claw shattered into pieces, and then those pieces were obliterated in an instant. It was like they’d never existed.

The corners of the Demon Empress’ eyes twitched slightly, and she was just about to attack again. However, Blind Maiden suddenly tapped her finger in the Demon Empress’ direction.

Om!

The space before Blind Maiden instantly rippled. At the same time, the Demon Empress’ expression changed drastically, and she pressed her palms over each other before pushing them forward.

Bang!

A mouthful of blood sprayed from the Demon Empress as her figure was blasted over 3km away.

“Demon Empress!” The 5 Voiders of the demon race shot towards Blind Maiden. How terrifying was the joint attack of 5 Voider Realm demon beasts? However, Blind Maiden didn’t even spare them a glance. She just waved her right hand, and then Yang Ye watched with astonishment as those 5 Voiders were blasted around 10km away. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye’s jaw almost hit the ground. My god! Those are Voiders! Not Emperors! Voiders! 5 of them! But they were blasted away with just a light wave of the hand! How strong is she?

Blind Maiden was about to attack again. However, Mo Xiaoleng suddenly appeared not too far away from Blind Maiden. There was a golden flame and dark blue flame on Mo Xiaoleng’s palms, and she didn’t waste her breath at all and immediately tossed them. The flames left a trail of fire behind them as they shot towards Blind Maiden.

Blind Maiden’s beautiful brows were pressed slightly together. A moment of silence ensued before she pushed both her palms forward, and then clenched them gently. In an instant, the flames were frozen on the spot.

Suddenly, Mo Xiaoleng appeared behind those flames, and then she formed a strange seal with her hands. The flames instantly expanded rapidly, and they transformed into a huge golden flame dragon and a huge dark blue flame dragon before immediately slamming themselves against Blind Maiden.

Bang!

The area around Blind Maiden was instantly transformed into an ocean of flames.

Mo Xiaoleng revealed a cold smile at the sight of this. But it didn’t take long for her smile to stiffen because the ocean of flames was actually starting to expand.

Bang!

A moment later, it was completely obliterated, and Blind Maiden appeared before her again. At this moment, Blind Maiden remained the same, and she hadn’t suffered any injuries!

“How could this be possible?!” Mo Xiaoleng stared fixedly at Blind Maiden, “You were actually not injured by my Sky Inferno and Nether Ocean!”

Blind Maiden gazed at Mo Xiaoleng and said, “It’s quite surprising that you possess such divine treasures. Hmm? Wait. You’re not from this world. You’re from the outside world. Eh? The bloodline of demon beasts.... No, it doesn’t belong to demon beasts, it belongs to divine beasts. You have the bloodline of a divine beast, and it’s blazing... and capable of rendering you immune to all flames.... You’re from the Divine Phoenix Clan.”

Mo Xiaoleng’s pupils constricted slightly, “Who exactly are you? Why do you know of my clan?!”

The Demon Empress appeared by Mo Xiaoleng’s side, and her gaze was on Blind Maiden as well. Besides bewilderment, there was fear in her eyes as well. Because the strength of the woman before her was simply unfathomable!

Blind Maiden said, “Your Divine Phoenix Clan didn’t participate in what happened all those years ago. So, I’ll let you live.” As she spoke, she gazed at the Demon Empress, “I’ll take your head if you step foot here again.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Blind Maiden paid no further attention to them. She just turned around and left.

Meanwhile, Mo Xiaoleng suddenly asked, “Who are you?!”

“The Nether Pavilion!” Blind Maiden didn’t even look back and just continued forward. Yang Ye hurriedly followed her because he had many things to ask Blind Maiden.

The Nether Pavilion? The Demon Empress frowned slightly. Obviously, she’d never heard of it. She turned around to gaze at Mo Xiaoleng, and she was stunned when she saw the expression on Mo Xiaoleng’s face. Because Mo Xiaoleng’s eyes were opened wide, and there was shock and disbelief in them.

The Demon Empress was even more shocked than Mo Xiaoleng. Because she’d never seen Mo Xiaoleng react like that. Since the very beginning, Mo Xiaoleng had always been extremely confident, and she’d looked down on everything on Dark Hell Continent. Yet now, Mo Xiaoleng was clearly shocked.

The Demon Empress asked in a low voice, “What’s the Nether Pavilion?”

Mo Xiaoleng clenched her fists and remained silent for a long time. After that, she turned to look at the Demon Empress, “Don’t come here again or no one can save you.”

The Demon Empress frowned, “What exactly is the Nether Pavilion?”

Mo Xiaoleng looked up at the sky, “A sect that once instilled fear in all the other powers of the large world. They have 10 halls.”

She gazed at the Demon Empress before she continued, “Do you know how terrifying they are if all 10 hall masters awaken and converge together?”

Mo Xiaoleng took a short breath of air at this point, and then she said, “When the 10 halls gather....”
