Chapter 2543

The black robed man had an extremely unsightly expression on his face!

A formation!

That formation has been an extraordinary formation that the Soul Sect had gotten just to annihilate Yang Ye, and it could annihilate Lord Realm experts with ease!

But it was gone as soon as it was used!

A Divine Treasure!

They’d overlooked that!

Yang Ye had a Divine Treasure that could destroy any formation and barrier!

How could a Divine Treasure given by the old man with a bamboo chest be an ordinary one?

The Universe Seal didn’t focus on offense, and it was a functional Divine Treasure!

After he destroyed the formation, Yang Ye just swung his sword.

Hiss!

It instantly pierced through the black robed man’s forehead. In an instant, his soul exploded apart, but it only took a moment for the fragments to converge once more. But this time, Yang Ye didn’t give it that chance!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

A few rays of light crisscrossed!

In an instant, the black robed man’s soul was sliced into dust!

This time, it didn’t converge once more!

Yang Ye looked down and said, “Did you see that?”

The elite disciples below nodded and swung their swords!

Yang Ye entered the city but ignored the battle between those elite disciples and the experts of the Soul Sect!

This battle was perfect for them as a form of training!

At this moment, the city was empty as most had left.

Yang Ye continued forward, and it didn’t take long for him to arrive before an estate.

Yang Ye knocked on the door!

A short while later, the door opened up!

It was a short and thin old man, and there was fear in his eyes when he saw Yang Ye.

Yang Ye smiled, “Is the Xu Clan’s patriarch in?”

The old man hesitated for a moment and nodded, “Yes, and you are?”

“Escort Sect Master Ye inside!” A voice came from deep within the estate.

The old man gazed at Yang Ye with astonishment. Yang Ye grinned as the old man hurriedly opened the door and invited Yang Ye inside.

Once Yang Ye entered the estate, he noticed that there were very few here. There were less than 20 in the entire estate!

A short while later, Yang Ye entered a hall, and Yang Ye saw an old man within it.

The Xu Clan’s patriarch, Xu Zhen!

Yang Ye cupped his fist toward Xu Zhen, “Patriarch Xu, how are you?”

Xu Zhen sized up Yang Ye with a rather complicated expression in his eyes, “The young truly are formidable!”

He gestured for Yang Ye to have a seat. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Yang Ye took a seat at the side.

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Why hasn’t the Xu Clan left?”

Xu Zhen glanced at Yang Ye and laughed with self-ridicule, “Sect Master Ye, you’re a direct person, so I’ll do the same. We haven’t left because we’re beneath the Soul Sect’s notice! They contacted the six top clans, but they didn’t contact my clan.”

“Why?” Yang Ye was puzzled, “You seem to be a Five World Realm expert, and I sense two other Three World Realm experts here.”

Xu Zhen smiled, “Because I’m almost at my end!”

Yang Ye glanced at Xu Zhen and came to a slight understanding!

The end!

His lifespan was almost exhausted!

Xu Zhen smiled, “As far as they are concerned, it’s better to devour our souls than recruit us.”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Would you accept if they extended an olive branch?”

Xu Zhen looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “I would!”

Yang Ye remained calm, “Why?”

Xu Zhen replied softly, “I know a little about the battle between the Ancient Sword Sect and Soul Sect. Allow me to be honest, as far as I’m concerned, the Ancient Sword Sect has no chance. It isn’t just the Soul Sect that is targeting the Ancient Sword Sect, other powers are joining in too. Of course, my thoughts changed a little when I saw you. You’re not an ordinary person, and the Ancient Sword Sect may still have a chance with you leading it!”

Yang Ye stood up, “Since you have no place to go, then go to the Ancient Sword Sect with your clan’s members. Of course, you can refuse. It’s your decision.”

Yang Ye left the hall once he finished speaking.

Xu Zhen closed his eyes slowly.

Around 15 minutes later, everyone in the Xu Clan left their estate and traveled for the Ancient Sword Sect!

Yang Ye went over to the entrance of the city. The elite disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect were still in battle with the Soul Sect’s experts!

10 vs 10!

It was very fair!

Yang Ye sat at the side and had no intention to interfere!

Needless to say, the quality of the experts from the Soul Sect was very high. All of them were in their soul forms now! In the beginning, both sides had been at a stalemate, but it hadn’t taken long for the disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect to be at a disadvantage.

It was because the experts of the Soul Sect were “impossible to kill”!

Even if the disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect killed one of them, their soul would immediately recover. Under such circumstances, the disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect were at a disadvantage.

Yang Ye didn’t help because a woman in a black dress was standing not too far away.

She didn’t interfere either!

Both of them were just watching!

Meanwhile, the victor of one of the battles was decided.

The expert from the Soul Sect had been careless and had his soul slashed into pieces by the disciples from the Ancient Sword Sect. This time, that sword cultivator didn’t give the soul a chance to condense once more and used a formidable sword technique. 100 rays of sword energy shot at the soul fragments, and if they hit, that expert from the Soul Sect would definitely have his soul sliced into bits!

Suddenly, the woman in a black dress stretched out her hand, and then the 100 rays of sword energy froze on the spot. A moment later, they vanished without a trace!

As for the Soul Sect’s expert, he’d seized the opportunity to restore his soul!

Yang Ye grinned, and then a strand of mysterious energy enveloped the surroundings!

At this moment, everyone stopped fighting!

The woman gazed at Yang Ye, but Yang Ye ignored her, and he just commanded two flying swords to flash out.

Hiss! Hiss!

Two of the Soul Sect’s experts instantly exploded apart!

Meanwhile, the woman suddenly appeared before Yang Ye, and then she pressed her palm down at his chest!

It was a strange ability!

A strange force!

In an instant, the space within the Sword Domain shook violently, and it seemed like Yang Ye’s Sword Domain would collapse at any moment!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye laughed ferociously, “Suppress it!”

As soon as he said that, he stomped his right foot down, and the space within the Sword Domain shook violently. The strength of the Sword Domain stopped the mysterious energy emanated by the woman, and then he raised his right hand and slashed.

11 swings with the Sword Domain!

The last swing descended!

Bang!

It slashed through his Sword Domain and struck the woman, blasting her over 3km away!

Yang Ye didn’t stop. The Sword Gourd shook by his waist, and then two rays of light shot forward.

Hiss! Hiss!

A few more souls exploded apart, and then they were sliced into bits!

The souls were about to try and converge again when the swords sliced them into bits again. This time, they were obliterated and vanished on the spot!

The other experts from the Soul Sect were horrified by this!

The woman suddenly took a step forward, and as soon as she did that…

Bang!

She was blasted away before she could even react!

Flash!

This time, Yang Ye had clearly used the secret technique, Flash, and his speed wasn’t something a Lord Realm expert could compete with!

It was so fast that she didn’t even have the chance to react!

Along with a few rays of sword energy that were almost too fast for the eye to catch, time seemed to have frozen!

Yang Ye sheathed his sword!

The disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect watched with astonishment as the souls of the experts from the Soul Sect just soundlessly vanished on the spot!

All of them had been killed in an instant!

It hadn’t even taken half a breath of time!

8 Five World Realm experts were gone just like that!

The woman’s expression was beyond unsightly. However, Yang Ye was already looking at her, and then her expression changed drastically.

Bang!

A sword howl resounded, and she was blasted over 3km away!

It was more than just fast right now!

The woman had countless techniques and abilities, but she had no chance to use them before Yang Ye’s terrifying speed and strength!

Two threads of blood slowly seeped out from the corners of her mouth, and as she wiped them off, Yang Ye had vanished on the spot.

The woman’s pupils constricted as she pressed her palms together. In an instant, the space around her shook, and then it started to warp!

After that, her figure turned ethereal!

Meanwhile, the sword arrived before her!

Bang!

That expanse of space was obliterated, but the woman was completely unharmed!

Or to be more precise, it was something like Yang Ye’s Sword Domain. She was beyond the space of this world, including black holes. She was independent beyond this world!

It was very mysterious!

Yang Ye gazed coldly at her. He activated the Sword Domain, and he could sense her, but he noticed that he couldn’t do anything to her.

However, she didn’t attack him either. It was because she was no match for him once she returned from this unique state!

The facts proved that even her mysterious abilities were no match for Yang Ye’s absolute strength and speed!

Because Yang Ye’s speed was so swift that she didn’t have a chance to use any of her techniques!

She glanced coldly at him and vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye put his sword away and looked up at the sky, “I’m the Sect Master, and the Ancient Sword Sect is under my protection!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished into the sky with the elite disciples.
