Chapter 2384 – Snowy is Very Angry!

Once Yang Ye killed the Guardian, clamorous noise filled the top powers of Eternal Border.

He’d killed a Guardian!

The Guardians were those who managed the order of a world. Perhaps their strength wasn’t at the top, but their identity was extremely special. Of course, it wasn’t the identity itself that was special, but the organization!

It was an organization which had existed since the ancient times, and they called themselves the Guardians for generations. They did not interfere in conflicts of the outside world and merely protected the world itself. If it wasn’t for them, Eternal Border would have shattered a long time ago.

It could be said that practically all experts would give them face.

It wasn’t the first time someone had openly killed a Guardian, but it had been a very, very long time since them.

No matter what, Yang Ye had once again appeared within their gazes.

However, Yang Ye wasn’t the same Yang Ye they once knew!

White Emperor City.

After he killed the Guardian, Yang Ye went to White Emperor City. The City Governor laughed bitterly when he saw Yang Ye. As far as he was concerned, he felt both joy and worry.

He was happy that Yang Ye was much stronger now, and worried because Yang Ye’s troubles had not been solved!

Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t worry, I’ll deal with everything.”

Meanwhile, Bai Zhixian appeared by Yang Ye’s side. It was she who’d asked him to come here with her.

Yang Ye gazed at her, “You two talk. I’ll wait outside!”

His figure shot off onto the city walls.

As he gazed at her, the old man sighed softly, “Zhixian, since you’re chosen him, I won’t say anything. But you should be aware of the situation that he’s in.”

Bai Zhixian replied softly, “After staying with him, I realized he isn’t a bloodthirsty person. Conversely, he doesn’t even want to kill. But for all kinds of reasons, he has been forced onto the path of slaughter. He isn’t wrong, it’s the world that is wrong. It’s he who doesn’t fit in this world.”

The old man shook his head, “When does a world ever try to conform to someone?”

She smiled, “So, he’s a special person. Of course, you can call him a rash fool too.”

The old man replied solemnly, “According to my knowledge, the experts at Eternal River are rushing back, and many of them are old geezers. These old geezers are able to enter the Eternal River, and they will never give up on that Sprite Progenitor.”

Bai Zhixian closed her eyes slowly, “He won’t give her up!”

Snowy!

She hadn’t known Snowy for long, but she could sense the relationship Yang Ye and Snowy had. It could be said that the little fellow’s status in Yang Ye’s heart wasn’t any lower than them!

So, it was impossible to make him abandon Snowy!

The old man shook his head, “Take care of yourself!”

Bai Zhixian knelt before him, and then she took up and left a short while later.

She’d come to bid her farewells. Of course, it may be forever. If Yang Ye could get through this, it would just be a farewell for now, but if Yang Ye couldn’t, it would be an eternal farewell.

Bai Zhixian didn’t say anything more and just left.

She naturally couldn’t stay here. If she did, the flames of war would burn to White Emperor City. Moreover, she could leave Yang Ye either.

On the city walls, Yang Ye opened his eyes, and Bai Zhixian was by his side.

He took her hand and smiled, “Let’s go!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of light that shot into the sky.

Yang Ye took Bai Zhixian away from White Emperor City, and along with their departure, some divine senses in the surroundings vanished as well.

Their target was Yang Ye, not White Emperor City. They had thought about using it to threaten Yang Ye, but they felt that it wasn’t realistic. If Bai Zhixian was here, then using her to threaten Yang Ye may work. Unfortunately, she was with Yang Ye.

Once those people hiding in the shadows left, a huge net started to form, and its prey was Yang Ye.

Yang Ye went to Sword Sky City.

At the main peak of Sword Sky City, a ray of light descended and dispersed to reveal Yang Ye’s figure. A short while later, the City Governor, Fen Tianyu appeared before Yang Ye. A wisp of complicated emotions flashed through his eyes as he gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s speed of growth was far, far too fast!

Yang Ye cupped his fist to Fen Tianyu and said, “Senior, I’m here to ask about An Nanjing. Do you know anything about her whereabouts?”

An Nanjing!

He naturally hadn’t forgotten her. Now, as far as he was concerned, the most important matter at hand was locating her.

Fen Tianyu shook his head slightly, “She vanished after going to the Divine Martial World. I did send people there, but they couldn’t find her, nor could they find where she went.”

The Divine Martial World!

Yang Ye nodded slightly. He knew that he had to find an opportunity to pay that place a visit!

An opportunity?

Yang Ye shook his head and chuckled. Why would he need that? He could go right now!

Yang Ye thanked Fen Tianyu and was about to leave, but Fen Tianyu seemed to be hesitant to say something.

Yang Ye stopped when he noticed this, “Senior, please be frank if you have something to say!”

Fen Tianyu sighed softly and said, “I have a request. Based on your natural talent and strength, you’ll definitely go to the Eternal River in the future. If you go there, please help me see if my founding ancestor is alive.”

The Eternal Sword Master!

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Alright!”

Fen Tianyu bowed, “Thank you.”

Yang Ye didn’t say another word and just left.

The complicated emotions in his eyes grew denser as he watched Yang Ye leave.

What was a monstrous genius? Yang Ye was it!

Actually, Fen Tianyu felt very lucky. He felt lucky that he’d chosen to become friends with Yang Ye, and that was why besides those powers from the Eternal River, Sword Sky City could be considered as the strongest power in Eternal Border!

Moreover, Sword Sky City and the other powers that remained on the surface of Eternal Border had swallowed the territory of the other clans. Because besides the Nanli Clan, all the other clans had left Eternal Border.

They had to vanish!

Because they didn’t have the strength to go against the other powers!

It could be said that all the powers who hadn’t chosen to go against Yang Ye had gained tremendously because of that decision. Not only had they been able to preserve their strength, they had been able to take a share of the territory which had belonged to those powers annihilated by Yang Ye.

As for the battle between Yang Ye and the powers from Eternal River, it had nothing to do with them. If Yang Ye won, it would definitely be good news for Sword Sky City because they had quite a good relationship with Yang Ye. Moreover, Yang Ye owed them a favor.

However, if Yang Ye lost, they didn’t lose much. Because those powers from Eternal River didn’t have any conflicts of interest with Sword Sky City. Those powers only had a single objective, and it was the Eternal River!

So, no matter what, Sword Sky City would be one of the final victors!

After he left Sword Sky City, Yang Ye shot through space on his sword toward World Mountain.

However, three old men obstructed his path when he was about to get there.

While they were One World Realm experts, their auras were thick and couldn’t be compared to by ordinary One World Realm experts. Especially the gray robed old man who led the group. The old man’s aura was extremely powerful and on par with a Two World Realm expert!

Yang Ye glanced at them and smiled, “Quite a few wish to kill me. I wonder which power you’re from? Please let me know so I know who I’m killing!”

The gray robed old man was calm as he glanced indifferently at Yang Ye, “The Guardians.”

The Guardians!

Yang Ye nodded, “I didn’t expect you to be here so soon.”

“Yang Ye!” The gray robed old man looked him in the eyes, “We Guardians have been protecting Eternal Border since forever, and we’ve rendered great contribution to Eternal Border. All powers and extraordinary experts give us some face, but you slaughtered one of us. You…”

Suddenly, a ray of sword energy tore through the air toward the old man.

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he swung his fist forward!

Bang!

The sword energy vanished without a trace while the old man swiftly pulled his hand behind his back. There was an injury on it!

At this moment, a solemn expression appeared on his face!

Yang Ye walked in their direction as he said, “I killed a Guardian? Let me ask you why I cannot kill you? Because you’re Guardians?”

The old man spoke solemnly, “Yang Ye, you’re breaking the rules. If you act willfully like this, you’ll be pursued and killed by the people of this world!”

“Then I’ll slaughter everyone in this world!” Yang Ye’s face was ferocious, “Old Bastard! Just cut the crap! Your target is Snowy, right? Snowy is with me, so come get her if you dare!”

A sword howl resounded from Yang Ye’s sword sheath!

The three of them gazed at Yang Ye with extremely unsightly expressions on their faces.

The old man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time yet didn’t attack. He crushed a talisman in his grasp instead. A short while later, numerous powerful auras shot over here from afar.

In the Primordial Pagoda. On the Ascension Platform.

A white little fellow suddenly leaped up onto the Ascension Platform. There was a gourd and a mirror hanging by the little fellow’s waist. She shot a glance upward, and then seriousness appeared on her face. She glanced at the surroundings, and then her gaze stopped on the mountains behind Void Mountain before gesturing in that direction.

A short while later, a black shadow shot up into the air, and then Oxxy appeared by Snowy’s side.

Snowy patted Oxxy on the shoulder, and then she raised her paw. An axe appeared in her paw. After that, she passed it to Oxxy, and the latter took it without hesitation!

Suddenly, another Primal Demon appeared on the Ascension Platform. It was the Primal Vicious Tiger. It glanced at Oxxy with a trace of fear in its eyes.

Oxxy’s cultivation wasn’t as high as its, but Oxxy had a Divine Treasure while it didn’t!

Meanwhile, Erya appeared by Snowy’s side too. She licked her tanghulu while sizing up the Primal Vicious Tiger from time to time. It was like she was looking at a delicious feast. Her gaze made the Primal Vicious Tiger extremely uncomfortable. However, it clearly feared Erya and didn’t dare to go against her!

Snowy looked left and right, and it didn’t take long for her to get slightly angry.

It was because the Primal True Dragon hadn’t come!

It actually hadn’t come!

They were going to fight, but it actually hadn’t shown itself. Snowy was very angry!

Oxxy lowered its head slightly. It knew the dragon was in trouble now.

Snowy was about to go over herself when Erya suddenly spoke coldly, “Snowy, calm down. Since that worm is so lazy, it’s a waste to keep it alive. I’ll go eat it and save our spirit energy from being wasted!”

She licked her lips once she finished speaking and vanished into the distance.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

On the Ascension Platform, Snowy blinked and felt that something was off.
