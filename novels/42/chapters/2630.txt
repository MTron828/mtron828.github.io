Chapter 2631

Elder Xue took the head and left.

At the peak of the mountain, Yang Ye looked up at the endless starry sky and spoke softly, “A’Xiu, Little Qi… Both of you better stay safe.”

Yang Ye turned around and left.

Cultivate!

Yang Ye entered his cultivation room and sat down cross-legged before closing his eyes slowly. A moment later, a wave of monstrous slaughter intent appeared within the room!

He was releasing his slaughter intent!

Even though he’d comprehended it, he wasn’t able to control it at all. If he couldn’t control it completely, it represented that his sword intent would be impossible to unleash. Under such circumstances, his strength would undoubtedly be greatly reduced.

Only when his slaughter intent, Slaughter Domain, sword intent, and Sword Domain could be used simultaneously, his strength would be at its most terrifying!

Dual intents and dual Domains!

Now, he planned to take control of his slaughter intent instead of letting it control him!

Moreover, he wanted to master the Slaughter Domain so that he could merge it with his Sword Domain.

They had to be independently improved, but when it was necessary, they had to merge as one.

Boundless slaughter intent filled the room.

Under his control, his slaughter intent didn’t leave the room and converged within the room.

Besides that, his Slaughter Domain covered the area within the room.

Slaughter intent and Slaughter Domain!

At this moment, even a Destiny Realm expert couldn’t survive within this room.

Even Yang Ye himself found his slaughter intent and Slaughter Domain difficult to resist, even with his pure Sword Heart.

If he didn’t have a pure Sword Heart and the Enlightened Sword Heart, he wouldn’t even dare to release his slaughter intent. Because it practically had its own consciousness. If he was too weak, it would definitely take control of him instead!

The entire room was filled with endless slaughter intent. Especially with the Slaughter Domain’s enhancement, the slaughter intent was terrifyingly solid. It was even more terrifying than his current sword intent.

His sword intent was at the Destiny Realm now, but his slaughter intent was almost at the peak of the Destiny Realm.

The strength of his slaughter intent was a direct reflection of the hatred he’d felt in the Origin World!

In the cultivation room, Yang Ye held Executor tight. At this moment, Executor had turned blood red under the influence of his slaughter intent.

An Nanjing was standing at the entrance to the room!

A trace of worry flashed through her eyes as she gazed at Yang Ye.

She’d experienced Yang Ye’s slaughter intent for herself. Once Yang Ye fails to control it, the entire world in the Primordial Pagoda may be in danger.

Suddenly, a mysterious wave of energy appeared here.

The Sword Domain!

An Nanjing heaved a sigh of relief when she sensed it.

Fortunately, Yang Ye was able to suppress it!

But it didn’t take long for her expression to change once more. It was because the Sword Domain had vanished without a trace while the slaughter intent here rose rapidly!

It wasn’t that his Sword Domain was weaker than his slaughter Domain, it was because Yang Ye would side with the Slaughter Domain while under the influence of his slaughter intent. Under such circumstances, the Sword Domain would naturally be at a disadvantage. If his mind was clear, and he sided with the Sword Domain, then his Slaughter Domain would naturally be suppressed.

Now, he had to balance them and make them exist simultaneously!

Meanwhile, on the Ascension Platform. Snowy flew up the platform, and the fragments of Sword Scroll’s body were before her.

At this moment, Snowy was ceaselessly pouring spirit energy into the fragments.

Actually, her method of repairing it was very simple, and it was to fill it with energy!

Her spirit energy was quite special. Especially now that she was a Sprite Progenitor. The fragments started to tremble upon receiving Snowy’s spirit energy, and a short while later, they started to slowly come together on their own.

A smile appeared on Sword Scroll’s face when she witnessed this.

She could finally return to her original form!

Day after day passed.

A long time later, the cultivation room shook violently, and then slaughter intent surged throughout it. An Nanjing’s expression grew increasingly solemn!

It would be a lie if she said that she wasn’t worried.

Just like that, three days passed. Yang Ye suddenly emerged from the room on the fourth day.

An Nanjing was stunned when she saw Yang Ye.

At this moment, one of Yang Ye’s eyes was red while the other was clear. Besides that, his hair was half red and half black!

An Nanjing frowned slightly, “What happened?”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, “It’s the best I can do!”

Partially mad!

It was the state he was currently in.

He couldn’t fully suppress his slaughter intent and Slaughter Domain. If he wanted to make his slaughter intent and Slaughter Domain coexist with his sword intent and Sword Domain, then he had to be affected by his slaughter intent.

It was unavoidable.

Because it was the essence of slaughter intent. The essence of slaughter intent was murder.

Presently, he only had partial clarity of the mind. So, he was partially mad and partially clear-minded.

It was the best he could accomplish.

It could be said that he was in the most dangerous state he could be in. Because the slightest mistake which made his thoughts side with his desire to kill would make him kill. However, the benefits were tremendous as well.

Now, he could use his Sword Domain and Slaughter Domain simultaneously.

With the help of dual Domains and dual intents, ordinary Destiny Realm experts were absolutely no match for him!

An Nanjing asked, “Are you really alright?”

Yang Ye opened his eyes and nodded slightly, “I’m fine.”

Yang Ye followed An Nanjing to the Ascension Platform. Snowy was still restoring Sword Scroll’s main body. She cracked a smile upon noticing Yang Ye’s arrival, and then she abandoned the fragments, hugged Yang Ye’s neck, and started rubbing her head against him.

Sword Scroll felt quite helpless.

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head gently, “Is it difficult to restore her original body?”

Snowy hurriedly shook her head. It wasn’t difficult for her at all!

Yang Ye grinned, “Thanks.”

After playing with Snowy for a while, Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda.

At the peak of the mountain, Yang Ye gazed up into space. He had many, many things to protect, and he had many, many things that he cared about.

He still hadn’t heard anything about Tian Xiu and Qi Bitian!

How are they now?

Suddenly, Elder Xue appeared behind Yang Ye, and she was shocked upon seeing him, “Sect Master…”

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and shook his head, “I’m fine. What is it?”

Elder Xue spoke solemnly, “The desolate race has started to take action.”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “They’ve attacked the Eternal Kingdom?”

Elder Xue shook her head, “They haven’t. However, their army is at Eternal Border, and they’ve blocked the exits of Eternal Kingdom.”

Yang Ye nodded, “How did Eternal Kingdom react to that?”

Elder Xue replied, “The Eternal Lord gave the order for all powers and independent cultivators to converge in the Central Region.”

She hesitated for a moment and added, “Our sect received the order too!”

Yang Ye revealed a wisp of ridicule, “They want us to fight the desolate race?”

Elder Xue remained silent.

Yang Ye looked up at the sky, “Elder Xue, what do you think?”

She shook her head, “Our sect will support you no matter what. It doesn’t matter what your decision is, we’ll follow you even to the death!”

Follow Yang Ye!

Yang Ye had led them through their most difficult moment until now. It could be said that no one’s prestige in the sect could compete with him!

Yang Ye nodded, “Tell the disciples to cultivate well and ignore everything that’s happening in the outside world. Don’t leave the sect during this time as well.”

Elder Xue nodded, “I hope you’ll be careful.”

She turned around and left.

Yang Ye left the Ancient Sword Sect again. This time, he went to Darkspace.

As soon as he arrived here, he sensed countless Darkspawn, but it only took a while for them to vanish completely.

A beam of light appeared not too far away from Yang Ye, and the Dark Lord was within it.

The powerful Dark Lord!

Even now, Yang Ye could still sense how formidable the Dark Lord was.

Yang Ye cupped his fist to the Dark Lord, “Senior, I have a request.”

The Dark Lord fell silent for a moment and said, “Go on!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “May I know how the Origin World is right now?”

The Dark Lord replied, “It has been completely destroyed. It doesn’t exist anymore.”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “What about the two of them?”

The Dark Lord fell silent for a long time and said, “Their fate is unknown.”

Yang Ye frowned, “Unknown?”

The Dark Lord said, “All of us had to stay away when that existence appeared. I hadn’t gone near the Origin World that day, and I was just watching from afar. However, because I was so far away, even I don’t know what happened there in the end. Now, the entire Origin World is in ruins and without any signs of life.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Slaughter intent gradually thickened slightly around him.

Meanwhile, the Dark Lord said, “You should be careful from now on.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye gazed at the Dark Lord.

The Dark Lord explained, “The Origin World is linked to that place. Now that the Origin World has been destroyed, the people there definitely hate you. Because it’s equivalent to destroying their final home. Now that those two are fighting that woman in black and their whereabouts are unknown, it’s very likely that the people from that place will act against you.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “What is that place?”

The Dark Lord explained, “A place that can conceal auras and help them hide from Destiny. Every expert who attains a certain level of strength would go there.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Both you and the Desolate Emperor don’t seem to be from that place!”

The Dark Lord replied, “We can suppress ourselves. We use a world to suppress our cultivation, but many of them don’t have such things.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I see. Thank you for answering my questions.”

Yang Ye turned around and was about to leave.

Suddenly, the Dark Lord said, “Be careful of the Sprite Progenitor.”

Yang Ye frowned, “Be careful of Snowy?”

The Dark Lord explained, “She is the only one who can use the energy of the myriad sprites to conceal that world from Destiny. So, if they want to survive, they will definitely come looking for the Sprite Progenitor.”

A ferocious grin appeared on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “Senior, how do I get to that place?”
