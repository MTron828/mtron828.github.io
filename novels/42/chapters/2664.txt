Chapter 2665 – Fusion!

At this moment, the killing intent in the woman in black’s eyes was simply material!

She had to return to the Destiny Dimension!

She could only truly heal rapidly in there, and it allowed her to avoid certain existences.

She’d finally arrived right before it, yet now, these people were obstructing her. It was obvious how furious she felt right now!

In the wooden house, Snowy quickly nodded to display her agreement upon hearing the woman. After that, she went over to the woman, took her sword, and was about to leave.

The woman suddenly stopped Snowy, “What are you doing?”

Snowy blinked and waved the sword. She was saying that she was going to fight!

The corners of her eyes twitched, “What the heck can you do? You’ll just be killed out there.”

Snowy thought for a moment, and then she placed the sword before the woman to say that she should do it instead.

The woman in black didn’t take the sword, she fell silent instead. A short while later, she gazed at Snowy, “I need spirit energy, give me more. I can’t stay outside for too long, so I must kill them upon leaving this place.”

Snowy hurriedly nodded, and then she opened her little mouth and spirit energy surged madly toward the woman.

Endless spirit energy surged to her. Meanwhile, threads of mysterious spirit energy appeared around her.

Snowy blinked, and her eyes were filled with curiosity. She gazed at the woman in black.

She glanced at Snowy and spoke indifferently, “First Heaven profound energy. It’s the first type of profound energy in the Three Dimensional Universe. It’s practically extinct now.”

Snowy thought for a moment and pointed at herself. She was asking if she could have some.

She could multiply it infinitely!

The woman fell silent for quite some time before she said, “I’ll give you some later!”

Snowy nodded and continued sending spirit energy to her.

She had to help the woman in black recover quickly, only then could the woman in black go outside to help Yang Ye and Erya!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

The situation was very clear.

Overwhelming strength!

Even though he had Erya by his side, the End World’s strength was still overwhelming.

After all, Yang Ye only had Erya’s help.

Based on the current situation, Yang Ye’s side had no chance to win.

However, the woman in black’s voice suddenly resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “One hour. Delay them for an hour and I’ll teach them a lesson!”Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief. Since she was willing to help, it was obviously for the best.

But why an hour?

Dammit!

Can you not put me in such a terrible situation?

Yang Ye cursed inwardly!

An hour?

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. Based on the forces here, not to mention an hour, even 15 minutes was difficult to delay! Moreover, once the battle began, Erya would definitely be in danger. Erya wasn’t invincible right now!

Tai Huntian, Zuo Mu, and that expert hidden in the shadows were absolutely capable of killing Erya!

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment. Right when Erya was about to attack, he suddenly stopped her, and she gazed at him with bewilderment.

Yang Ye grinned, “Let me do it!”

As he spoke, he pulled Erya behind him and walked toward the Divine Abode’s master and the others, “I know I can’t survive this. At any rate, I’m still someone of some status after all my years of cultivation, so I wonder if you’ll let me have one request before I die?”

The Divine Abode’s master laughed coldly, “Yang Ye, it’s a rare moment to see you know your own limitations! Go on, tell us what you want.”

Yang Ye chuckled, and then he gazed at Tai Huntian, “I want to fight him in single combat.”

Tai Huntian’s eyes narrowed slightly.

The Divine Abode’s master glanced at Tai Huntian and gazed at Yang Ye, “Why?”

Yang Ye cracked a smile, “I rescued him that day, but I never expected him to turn against me. I really can’t stand the sight of him. So, I want to fight him.”

The Divine Abode’s master spoke coldly, “Yang Ye, we don’t want to waste time with you. We…”

Suddenly, Tai Huntian interrupted the Divine Abode’s master, “I’ll fight him!”

The Divine Abode’s master frowned slightly, “Senior Tai, delaying gives time for many unexpected turns. We don’t have to waste time on him!”

Tai Huntian laughed coldly, “What can possibly happen? All of us are here. Even Qi Bitian wouldn’t be able to save him. He’s dead! Or perhaps all of you won’t even have to fight because I’ll deal with him myself!”

The Divine Abode’s master wanted to say more, but Tai Huntian suddenly gazed at him, “What? You think that I’m no match for him?”

The Divine Abode’s master shook his head, “Not at all. I just don’t want to delay.”

Tai Huntian replied indifferently, “Don’t worry, killing him won’t take long!”

He shot over to Yang Ye and glanced at the latter, “You rescued me, but I helped you kill one person. We’re already even. Now, you’re responsible for your own fate!”

The space around him shook once he finished speaking.

A moment later, a black shadow shot toward Yang Ye!

It was Tai Huntian!

Along with the arrival of the black shadow, a stand of dense Death Energy enveloped Yang Ye!

It was so dense it was simply unprecedented for Yang Ye!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye drew his sword and swung it.

Even Yang Ye didn’t know how many times he’d actually swung his sword!

He’d immediately used a trump card!

When facing an expert like Tai Huntian, he couldn’t be careless at all, nor did he dare to hold back.

Boom!

At the instant Yang Ye attacked, it was like a thunderclap resounded. The space here shook, and then countless cracks appeared. But just a moment later, the cracks vanished, and space was fully restored.

Meanwhile, Tai Huntian and Yang Ye had split apart!

They were around 300m away from each other!

Yang Ye’s face was turning black. Fortunately, he had countless strands of Primordial Violet Energy flowing around him. While they couldn’t fully dispel the Death Energy, they could resist it!

If he didn’t have the Primordial Violet Energy, he would definitely die!

Meanwhile, an extremely deep injury had appeared on Tai Huntian’s palm, and it was so deep his bones were visible!

Blood flowed incessantly from it!

Tai Huntian’s face was extremely gloomy!

He gazed at Yang Ye’s sword. At this moment, there was solemness and fear in his eyes!

That sword had sliced through his Death Energy. His Death Energy couldn’t resist it at all unless his strength far surpassed Yang Ye. Unfortunately, Yang Ye was at the Destiny Realm right now, and Yang Ye wasn’t weak either!

Moreover, his attainments in the Sword Dao weren’t weak either! Coupled with his dual intents and dual Domains, even an expert like Tai Huntian had to be careful against Yang Ye!

Tai Huntian waved his hand, and the injury there started to heal slowly. While it was very slow, the bleeding had stopped at least. It was being stopped by a strand of black energy!

He walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, “You really do have some strength!”

As soon as he finished speaking, an ethereal face appeared behind him.

It was Tai Huntian’s face!

A spirit!

He’d split his spirit from his body!

Yang Ye tightened his grip on his sword sheath while boundless slaughter intent and sword intent surged into it.

Yang Ye showed no hesitation in a battle against an old geezer like Tai Huntian. If he didn’t rely on Heaven Executor, he would have no chance to win. Because Heaven Executor was a huge threat to Tai Huntian and the others!

They had no choice but to fear it!

Meanwhile, Tai Huntian’s figure suddenly shook, and then the space around Yang Ye was torn open. A moment later, a figure appeared before Yang Ye and clawed at him with two hands!

Actually, it was just one hand that had clawed at him, but one was a real hand while the other was ethereal!

Body and soul were overlapped!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly while his figure moved sideways slightly. A moment later, he drew his sword and swung it!

The Domain Sword!

Hiss!

The hands were instantly sliced open. However, another hand slammed against his chest at the same time!

It was extremely swift!

Yang Ye didn’t attempt to dodge it at all, and he just stabbed his sword forward with both hands!

The sword was longer than a hand!

Tai Huntian was clearly aware of that, so at the instant Yang Ye stabbed at him, he’d moved his hand upward and grabbed Heaven Executor.

Close quarters combat!

Yang Ye felt like his sword couldn’t move at all. Meanwhile, a strand of dense Death Energy and a wave of powerful Soul Energy instantly surged out of Tai Huntian!

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted, and then he let go of Heaven Executor. A moment later, another sword appeared in his grasp!

Past Life!

Yang Ye moved forward and swung a horizontal slash!

Hiss!

The Soul Energy and Death Energy weren’t sliced apart upon touching the Past Life, they just vanished and were obliterated!

The sword shot straight at Tai Huntian’s stomach!

Tai Huntian’s expression changed drastically from the sight of this, and he was about to retreat. However, Yang Ye grabbed Heaven Executor with his right hand and pulled it toward him.

Tai Huntian was shocked. He immediately released Heaven Executor and flashed backward. Meanwhile, Yang Ye appeared in front of him!

Yang Ye was holding a sword in each hand!

Dual swords!

Very few knew that Yang Ye had created his own Madness Sword Technique and Dual Sword Style. At this moment, Yang Ye was using both of them!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Everything was sliced apart in Yang Ye’s wake, and Tai Huntian was pushed back repeatedly. At this moment, he didn’t seem like an expert at all, and he was panicking like a weakling!

Tai Huntian didn’t dare to go head-on against Yang Ye because both those swords were insane!

He was being pushed back repeatedly!

Finally, Tai Huntian’s voice resounded, “Are you still going to continue watching?”

As soon as he said that, a ray of saber energy flashed. At the same time, numerous powerful auras and pressures slammed down at Yang Ye!

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted over 3km away!

Once he stopped himself, a wisp of blood seeped out slowly from the corner of his mouth, and there was an extremely deep saber injury on his chest.

That saber attack had almost split him into two!

The Divine Abode’s master’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Attack together!”

“I’ll kill you!” Meanwhile, Tai Huntian suddenly charged at Yang Ye again. This time, he wasn’t afraid because he had around a dozen experts to support him!

Tai Huntian led the charge with a ferocious expression on his face, “So what if your dual swords are formidable? I have the numbers!”

Meanwhile, a woman in black appeared in front of Yang Ye.

The woman in black gazed coldly at Tai Huntian, and then she waved her right hand. Heaven Executor and Past Life immediately appeared in her grasp. After that, the two swords and her own black sword shook violently, and then they merged together!
