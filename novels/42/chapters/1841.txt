Chapter 1842 – I Heard You’re Strong! I Don’t Believe It!

Explosions resounded incessantly on the dead planet.

Yang Ye’s strength was extremely powerful, so every single punch of his would make over 10km of ground collapse.

However, the planet was truly too huge.

Based on the area he destroyed with each punch, it would take at least ten years for him to shatter the entire planet!

I can’t continue like this!

Yang Ye stopped.

Senior Hou Qing made me punch this dead planet. This means that as far as he’d concerned, my current strength is sufficient to smash it into bits. However, it’s absolutely not in this way. There’s definitely another way!

Yang Ye started thinking at this point.

Strength!

Yang Ye gazed at his hands. At this moment, his hands possessed extremely powerful strength, so shattering the heavens and the earth was entirely possible. However, it had a limit. Simply speaking, he still wasn’t capable of shattering the heavens and the earth.

If he could really accomplish that, then blasting a planet apart could be accomplished with a single punch!

Yet now, he was far from that!

Yang Ye gazed at his hands. Just relying on the strength within his hands was utterly insufficient to blast a planet apart.

Besides my hands… Yang Ye’s eyes suddenly lit up. Besides his hands, he had his body and legs! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Yang Ye slowly clenched his fists when he thought up to this point, and then he slammed his fists against the ground.

Boom!

As soon as they descended, an area of over 30km collapsed into bits, and then a bottomless abyss appeared below him.

Yang Ye was delighted by the sight of this. The method he thought of was on the right path. He hadn’t just used his hands when he swung that punch, he’d used the strength throughout his body. Once he used the strength throughout his body, the strength of his punch had at least tripled!

Suddenly, Hou Qing’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “You’ve finally gotten to this step?”

Yang Ye replied, “Senior Hou Qing, you wanted me to realize that strength doesn’t just come from my fists, it comes from my entire body, right?”

Hou Qing replied, “You’re partially right. Strength doesn’t just come from your fist and body; strength comes from the ground below you and the space around you as well. Or to be more precise, everything can become a source of strength for you.”

Yang Ye was quite puzzled by this, “What do you mean?”

Hou Qing explained, “Use the ground beneath your feet and the space around you. Make them your propulsion force, and then amplify your own strength. Understand all things, modify all things, and use all things. Understand?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment on the spot and said, “I’ll give it a try!”

His figure flashed over 10km away.

Yang Ye closed her eyes and seemed like he’d entered into a meditative state.

He was sensing!

He was standing on the ground, so he could sense the ground, and he could sense the space around him. He did possess the Spatial Laws. However, he didn’t really know how to use them.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing’s voice resounded once more, “You always preferred to stand on the ground when you fight. Why did you do that?”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he said, “Because I can rely on the counterforce from the ground to make my attacks faster and…”

Yang Ye was stunned when he spoke up to this point.

Counterforce!

He could use the counterforce from the ground and space to achieve what Hou Qing had spoken about! Using all things!

As soon as he thought up to this point, Yang Ye looked down at the ground, and then he exerted a little strength with his feet.

Crack!

The ground instantly cracked open, and the area beneath him was gone.

Yang Ye frowned when he witnessed this, “Senior, the ground is too fragile. It can’t endure my strength. I…”

“Fool!” Hou Qing suddenly interrupted Yang Ye, “You should be using the explosive force created at that instant, and not try to accumulate strength like that! So, you must be fast, extremely fast! Absolutely fast! Understand?”

Yang Ye smiled with embarrassment, “I understand!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he moved to the right and fell silent for a moment. Suddenly, he exerted force with his feet, and as soon as he did that, he clenched his fists and slammed them against the ground.

Boom!

A rumbling explosion resounded, and then dust shot up into the air and formed a mushroom cloud.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. At this moment, the ground in an area of over 150km had collapsed completely. A 150km wide bottomless abyss had appeared beneath him!

A wisp of excitement flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, “That was powerful!”

The strength of the punch he just executed could even kill a 6th stage True Realm expert in an instant!

Suddenly, Hou Qing’s voice resounded, “You’re already satisfied?”

Yang Ye asked, “That isn’t my limit, right?”

“What do you think?” Hou Qing continued, “Your body is at the Blood Rebirth stage, and the cultivation technique you cultivated is ranked in the top ten within my shaman race. If that’s the limit of its strength, then wouldn’t my shaman race be absolutely useless?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Hou Qing continued, “Your speed wasn’t fast enough, and the explosive force created wasn’t strong enough. You can do better. At the very least, you have to destroy the ground in an area of over 300km to be considered as barely up to standards! Go on! Continue!”

300km!

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. How far was 300km? It meant that if he returned to Divine Ruins City, then he could obliterate it with a single punch!

Hou Qing suddenly asked, “What? You think it’s inconceivable?”

Yang Ye nodded, “A little.”

Hou Qing replied, “Kid, once you come into contact with higher realms of cultivation, you’ll realize that this is nothing. You’ll understand why those ancient cultivators created a barrier between the large universe and the medium universe. It’s because if they didn’t create the barrier, then a few battles between those experts would obliterate this medium universe!”

Obliterate the medium universe!

Yang Ye looked up at the starry sky above. How strong are they?

A long time passed before Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he looked at his hands. He should be thinking about how to improve his strength and avenge Blood Maiden. As for everything else, it wasn’t something he should think about right now.

Train!

Train like a madman!

Mushroom clouds surged up incessantly on the dead planet. In the beginning, there were only a few clouds, but in the end, even if one stood in the starry sky, one would be able to have a clear view of those mushroom clouds above the planet.

It was because there were too many of them!

Merely utilizing physical strength wouldn’t exhaust profound energy but using too much physical energy would exhaust a person.

However, it was only temporary for Yang Ye. Because he had Primordial Violet Energy!

Just like that, Yang Ye started swinging his fists like a madman.

Three days later!

His hard work wasn’t in vain. His punches were growing stronger and stronger. Now, a single punch of his could shatter an area of 210km.

He didn’t choose to shatter the surrounding space because it was pointless.

Even if space collapsed, cultivators were able to survive in black holes once they gained a certain amount of strength. So, if he fought in the future, he wouldn’t shatter space anymore, and he would try his best to make all his strength converge onto his opponent!

On the planet. Yang Ye swung his fists like a madman, all day and night. While his punches grew stronger and stronger, the planet was covered in holes.

Ten days later!

At this moment, a single punch of his could shatter 270km. Yang Ye intended to continue training, but Hou Qing’s voice suddenly resounded in his mind, “You can’t continue anymore!”

Yang Ye stopped and asked, “Why? I think that I can still improve.”

During this period, he’d gotten slightly addicted to the feeling of swinging his fists.

Hou Qing replied, “This planet is on the verge of collapsing completely. If you continue, you’ll be obliterated along with this planet.”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he glanced at the surroundings, “Sure enough, the dead planet was on the verge of being completely obliterated. No, it was about to collapse completely.

Because he’d blasted apart the entire core of the planet!

Hou Qing said, “Continue on a different planet!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he twisted his right foot on the ground.

Boom!

An area of 270km beneath him was obliterated, and Yang Ye’s figure appeared over 30km above.

At this moment, he was using his strength to increase his speed, and it was on par with his speed when he flew on his sword.

If he combined them, his speed would multiply by at least three times!

After he entered the boundless starry sky, Yang Ye started looking for another dead planet.

Around an hour later, Yang Ye appeared on a different planet.

This planet didn’t have any living beings as well. It was filled with death and silence!

So, Yang Ye started swinging his fists like a madman again.

Punch after punch.

Three days later, he’d punched the entire planet into bits! Now, every single one of his punches could blast open around 300km of the ground! Moreover, he’d used less than three days to destroy the planet!

It seemed very terrifying, but it wasn’t very terrifying. After all, it was a dead planet, and it wouldn’t resist, dodge, or counterattack. Even an ordinary 6th stage True Realm expert could destroy it, but it would take a little longer to obliterate it!

However, a real battle was completely different. People were alive, and they would similarly utilize formidable energy in their attacks, and they would dodge and counterattack as well!

But it was undoubtable that Yang Ye possessed terrifying strength!

Yang Ye didn’t plan to stop just like that. He entered the boundless starry sky and planned to find another dead planet to continue!

Because he felt that he hadn’t reached his body’s limits!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and was about to start searching. Suddenly, he frowned, and then the space behind him trembled. It only took a moment for a black robed man to appear not too far behind Yang Ye.

The black robed man said, “You’re Yang Ye, right?” His voice was quite hoarse.

Yang Ye turned to gaze at the black robed man, “Who are you?”

“Heaven’s Net!” The black robed man said, “An intelligence organization from Heaven Pillar Mountain. Someone paid handsomely for us to find you, so we’ve exhausted quite a bit of effort to find you.”

Yang Ye asked, “And?”

The black robed man clenched his fists slowly, “I heard you’re very strong. I don’t believe it. I’d like to experience your strength for myself!”
