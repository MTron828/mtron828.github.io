Chapter 1219 – I’ll Be There Even If The Sky Collapses!

Everyone here was immobilized by the pressure. It wasn’t just Dugu Tianwei, practically everyone here had despair in their eyes.

The realm above the Emperor Realm was the Voider Realm, and it had been numerous years since such an expert had appeared on Dark Hell Continent. It wasn’t that such experts didn’t exist, it was that they had never shown themselves. Ordinary things were unable to arouse the attention of experts at such a level. So, most people on the continent had unconsciously forgotten their existence.

But they had never imagined that the World Devastator Cult actually possessed a Voider!

Despair!

Everyone including Ye Liuyun felt despair. Yang Ye’s strength was heaven defying and capable of annihilating Emperors in an instant, but he was just a Saint in the end. She was confident that if Yang Ye was given more time, then he would definitely be able to rival Voiders. Yet now.... The gap in their cultivation was too huge!

Ye Liuyun wasn’t the only one with such thoughts, everyone else here was of the same mind.

Bang!

Suddenly, a strand of sword intent swept out from Yang Ye, and then everyone felt relieved and returned to normal.

A voice came from outside the hall, “Rebirth Rank sword intent.... It’s extraordinary indeed.”

All the experts within the hall gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye stood up slowly, glanced at them, smiled, and then started walking out of the hall.

All of them were at a loss for words.

Right when Yang Ye was about to leave the hall, Nan Shuang suddenly walked over to his side. Yang Ye gazed at her while she looked him in the eyes and said, “I... I’ll go with you!”

Yang Ye grinned, “Are you not afraid?”

She gazed at him and told him the truth, “I am!”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a short while before he nodded, “Then let’s go together!”

Meanwhile, Ye Liuyun walked over and stood behind Yang Ye. It didn’t take long for Dugu Jian, Qin Zhuyao, and the others to do the same. In next to no time, everyone within the hall was standing behind Yang Ye.

Yang Ye turned around, glanced at them, and smiled, “Don’t act like I’m going to die. There’s no need to worry, I’ll be there even if the sky collapses!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took Nan Shuang’s hand and walked out of the hall.

The others quickly followed him.

...

In the sky above Doomsday City. An old man in blue and white robes stood proudly in the sky. His figure was ramrod straight, and his eyes were sharp like a blade, causing others to dare not look directly in his eyes.

A ray of light flashed and Yang Ye appeared before the old man.

When Yang Ye arrived before the old man, an invisible aura smashed down towards Yang Ye like a hundred mountains. It was invisible but everyone could feel it.

It was an aura that was countless times stronger than the aura of an Emperor!

Suddenly, Rebirth Realm sword intent appeared in front of Yang Ye, and the old man’s aura was immediately obstructed.

However, the space around Yang Ye and the old man started to ripple violently while arm-thick cracks appeared incessantly around them. Moreover, those cracks were spreading at an alarming rate.

The spectators on the ground below clenched their fists and watched anxiously. No matter what, Yang Ye was their only hope.

A moment of silence ensued before Yang Ye’s Rebirth Rank sword intent and the old man’s aura vanished at the same time.

The old man gazed at Yang Ye and said, “You’re the best in the younger generation throughout the last 10,000 years!”

“You’re too kind!” Yang Ye continued, “You didn’t attack right away, so I presume that you have something to say. Please do tell.”

The old man said, “I was in closed door cultivation, and they suddenly came to get me. Never had I expected that when I emerged and had a look, the Cult Leader and dozens of Emperors had died miserably. Yet all of this was done by a Saint and the Sword Alliance that I’ve never heard of. I was curious, extremely curious. Now that I’ve met you, I have to admit that they didn’t die unjustly. While you’re a Saint, ordinary Emperors are of no threat to you while you possess Rebirth Rank sword intent.

A strange smile curled up on the corners of the old man’s mouth when he spoke up to this point, “But I felt even more pleasant surprise.”

“Pleasant surprise?” Yang Ye was slightly stunned, “You were pleasantly surprised that I killed so many from the World Devastator Cult?”

The old man chuckled, “Something like that.” He glanced at Doomsday City before looking at Yang Ye, “I’m sure you don’t want to fight me here, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Of course!”

“Then come with me!” The old man vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye was about to leave, but Ye Liuyun suddenly shouted, “Sword Master!”

Yang Ye looked down and noticed that everyone was looking at him.

Yang Ye smiled, “Once I leave, Liuyun will manage all affairs within the Sword Alliance. As for the affairs outside the Sword Alliance, Senior Jian Xu will manage them. These are my orders, and no one is allowed to defy them. Liuyun and Senior Jian Xu, you can kill anyone who dares to disobey these orders and report them later.”

“Understood!” Everyone within the city bowed respectfully towards Yang Ye and spoke in unison.

“You’ll definitely come back!” Meanwhile, Nan Shuang suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, “Definitely, right?”

A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “What would you do if I didn’t?”

Nan Shuang hadn’t expected that Yang Ye would ask this question. She was stunned for a moment before she muttered, “I... I don’t know....”

Death silence filled the surroundings once Yang Ye left.

A long time later, Ye Liuyun took a deep breath and said, “Attend to your own duties. Don’t let the Sword Master see the city in a mess when he returns!”

“Yes!” All of them didn’t dare hesitate and immediately agreed. However, the worry in their eyes couldn’t be concealed. Moreover, the eyes of many had even narrowed, and only they knew what they were thinking.

...

High above in the sky, Yang Ye was flying swiftly on his sword, and the space around him was trembling. Meanwhile, the old man wasn’t too far ahead. However, no matter how Yang Ye sped up, he wasn’t able to catch up to the old man. Even if he utilized the Void Flash technique, he still couldn’t catch up to the old man.

The old man was just in front of him, but the old man was so out of reach.

Yang Ye’s face grew solemn. He’d naturally met a Voider Realm expert in the past. That expert who fought Lady at the Radiant Dimension was probably one. However, Yang Ye hadn’t fought that expert. Actually, they had fought, but it had only been that expert’s clone in the beginning, and Lady had shown herself when that expert’s real body had arrived.

So, he didn’t know how strong a Voider was. But he knew that a Void was definitely very strong. However, he was very strong now as well!

If it were in the past, then he would definitely be incapable of fighting such an expert, but he wanted to give it a try now!

After over 2 hours passed, the old man suddenly stopped, and then Yang Ye appeared around 300m behind the old man.

At this moment, they were surrounded by a desert that stretched out for hundreds of thousands of kilometers in all directions.

The old man turned around to gaze at Yang Ye, and he nodded slightly, “Your sword techniques aren’t bad. Especially when they are enhanced by Rebirth Rank sword intent!”

Yang Ye replied, “But I still wasn’t as fast as you!”

“I’ve lived for so many years!” The old man shrugged, “Come! Let me see how strong you are.”

“As you wish!” Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath. Heaven’s Gravestone appeared in his grasp, and then he stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of blood red light that shot towards the old man.

The ultimate version of Death by a Thought!

Yang Ye naturally had to fight seriously when facing such an expert.

The blood red sword energy was extremely swift and instantly arrived before the old man, but it was stopped by 2 fingers.

The old man tapped Yang Ye’s sword, and just those 2 fingers caused Yang Ye to be unable to advance even an inch further.

“A sword of slaughter at the Void Rank! What a surprise!” The old man flicked lightly once he finished speaking.

Om!

The blood red sword shook violently while Yang Ye was blasted away.

“Even though that move wasn’t bad, it’s far from enough!” The old man put both his hands behind his back and spoke indifferently, “Come! Show me your true strength!”

As soon as the old man finished speaking, Yang Ye suddenly arrived before the old man and drew his sword.

200 overlapped Heavenrends!

The ground below the old man instantly collapsed and formed an almost 3km deep hole!

As for the old man, he hadn’t dodged at all, and he’s just raised his hand and tapped it forward.

Bang!

The entire sky shook violently as Yang Ye was blasted 3km away. However, the old man had taken a few steps back as well.

“That attack wasn’t bad! Ordinary Emperors would really be incapable of resisting it.” The old man gazed at Yang Ye with slight surprise in his eyes.

Yang Ye didn’t launch another attack and just said, “Those 2 attacks were my strongest. I’m done.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“I think so too!” The old man nodded, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “Do you know why I didn’t kill you right away?”

Yang Ye replied, “I really do!”

A smile curled up on the corners of the old man’s mouth, “Your body is comparable to an Emperor Realm demon beast, and you possess Void Rank slaughter intent and Rebirth Rank sword intent. Besides that, you have a sword of slaughter at the Void Rank. Right, that sword sheath of yours isn’t ordinary as well. The Sword Alliance you created is still passable as well, and it has huge potential. The most important factor is your natural talent. You’ve attained such accomplishments at such a young age. Your natural talent is absolutely one of the best in the last 10,000 years!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “What are you trying to say?”

The smile on the old man’s face slowly widened, “Do you know why I was cultivating behind closed doors? Because my lifespan is almost exhausted! I know my limitations well. The Voider Realm is my limit. If I want to continue living, then there’s only one way to accomplish that, and it’s to... seize the body of another!”

Seize another’s body!

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, “You want to take my body?”

“Of course!” A smile of madness gradually crept up on the old man’s face, “I’d intended to find someone within my World Devastator Cult, but no one was satisfactory. Fortunately, you appeared. The heaves are truly on my side!”

Yang Ye blinked. A moment later, he turned around and fled.

“Trying to flee? It’s too late now!” The old man stretched out his hand and grabbed while he spoke. Yang Ye was instantly restrained on the spot by a mysterious force. It didn’t take long for the old man to appear before him and smile ferociously, “Don’t worry, once I gain control over your body, I’ll lead your Sword Alliance to become the number one power on the continent. Besides that, I’ll take good care of your women. Hahaha!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man’s soul shot into the center of Yang Ye’s forehead.
