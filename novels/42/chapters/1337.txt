Chapter 1338 – I Just Want To Annihilate The Human Race!

“It’s the Sword Master!”

“He has come out of his closed door cultivation! He’s here!”

“Our human race still has a chance!”

“Sword Master!”

Countless people in Doomsday City seethed with excitement at the sight of Yang Ye. Of course, the main reason was because of what Yang Ye had said.

Does any demon dare to fight me?

It was domineering!

Extremely domineering!

Yang Ye’s words were like a booster that made the despairing hearts of the humans to once again blaze with hope. As they watched Yang Ye face the entire demon race with his blood red sword in hand, their blood boiled.

A wisp of happiness and excitement flashed through Ye Liuyun’s eyes. Because Yang Ye’s arrival had undoubtedly allowed her to see a glimmer of hope.

Meanwhile, the Demon Empress’ eyes instantly narrowed slightly when she saw Yang Ye. Suddenly, Yang Ye pointed his sword at the demon army and said, “Does any demon in the demon race dare to fight me?”

Roar!

Being provoked like that caused countless demon beasts to roar at Yang Ye, and then they gazed at the Demon Empress in unison. Obviously, they were seeking permission to meet Yang Ye in battle.

The Demon Empress gazed at Yang Ye for a short while, and then she withdrew her outstretched hand. Yang Ye was challenging the entire demon race, and the demon race would treat it as a humiliation if they didn’t accept the challenge. Losing the battle wasn’t a problem as the demon race could accept defeat, but not daring to accept a challenge was viewed as an extraordinary humiliation by all demon beasts.

While she could order them to attack right away, the demon race would definitely seem inferior if she did that. Moreover, the demon beasts would definitely feel some resentment towards her while greatly improving the morale of the human race’s forces. Because no demon throughout the demon race had dared to accept Yang Ye’s challenge!

They had to respond to Yang Ye’s challenge.

But who should be sent?

She couldn’t, right? She was confident in herself, but she was the Demon Empress, a Voider! But Yang Ye was just a Quasi Emperor of the younger generation. Even if she defeated him, it would be an undeserved victory. She pondered deeply for a short while was about to speak when a demon beast suddenly arrived before her.

It was a huge demon beast that seemed like a cow, but it had 2 feet like humans. However, every other aspect of it was no different than a cow.

The Demo Empress frowned slightly, “Ox King?”

The Ox King bowed respectfully to her and said, “Demon Empress, I, Ox King, seek permission to accept the challenge.”

The Demon Empress shook her head and said, “Return to your positions!” She knew Yang Ye’s strength very well, and only she and Mo Xiaoleng could defeat Yang Ye. As for the other demon beasts, they would only be bringing humiliation upon themselves. But the battle was related to the morale of the demon race’s army, so they had to win!

The Ox King’s face fell when he heard her, but he didn’t dare to say anything and just left immediately,

Once the Ox King left, the Demon Empress turned to gaze at Mo Xiaoleng, “Little Mo, are you interested in playing with him?”

Mo Xiaoleng remained silent for a short while and said, “He has that little fellow and the spatial mink. My abilities are completely countered.”

The Demon Empress smiled, “Don’t worry. This is a fair fight. He wouldn’t dare to bully you like that!”

“Good! I’ve been wanting to beat him up for a long time!” As soon as she finished speaking, Mo Xiaoleng tapped her right foot lightly against the back of the Cloud Eagle, and then she transformed into a strand of flames that appeared not too far away from Yang Ye.

Yang Ye wasn’t surprised to see Mo Xiaoleng. Because he’d guessed that the Demon Empress would send her. After all, the Demon Empress and Mo Xiaoleng were the only ones within the demon race that were confident in their ability to defeat him. But the Demon Empress was the empress of the demon race and from the older generation, so it was obviously impossible for her to bully someone from the younger generation while the entire world was watching. So, she could only send Mo Xiaoleng.

Mo Xiaoleng spoke coldly, “Your human race is about to be annihilated!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while before he asked, “Does the demon race have to do this?” After all, he had no malice towards the demon race, and if it was possible, he was very willing to live in peace with the demon race.

Mo Xiaoleng replied, “Don’t you think the continent just needs one species?”

Yang Ye glanced at her, and then his gaze descended onto the Demon Empress, “Demon Empress, it’s very likely for that fellow, Nie Wuming, to advance above the Voider Realm. If you enter into war with my human race now, he will reap the benefits in the end!”

“I know!” The Demon Empress looked Yang Ye in the eyes and said, “But I just want to annihilate the human race. So long as the human race is annihilated, I don’t care about anything else! You won’t understand it, and there’s no need to waste your breath. Let’s just fight!”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a long time, and then he said, “Then bring it on!”

Bang!

As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, a golden flame instantly appeared on Mo Xiaoleng’s right palm. As soon as the golden flame appeared, Snowy’s eyes instantly lit up as she stood on Zi’er’s shoulder. She was about to inhale but Zi’er hurriedly stopped her. Yang Ye and Mo Xiaoleng were fighting a fair battle. If Snowy inhaled the golden flame, it would definitely infuriate the demon race. At that time, the demon race would definitely think that it wasn’t a fair fight and swarm Yang Ye!

Snowy blinked when Zi’er stopped her, and her eyes were filled with bewilderment.

Zi’er rubbed Snowy’s head gently and said, “You can’t take it right now, or it’ll cause trouble for him! Understand?”

Snowy nodded while seeming to understand her yet not completely. After that, she gazed at the flame with reluctance.

Actually, Mo Xiaoleng had been looking at Snowy once she withdrew the flame. She was quite afraid that Snowy would try to inhale it. After all, Snowy wasn’t just inhaling the flame, Snowy was taking away its quintessence as well! Fortunately, Snowy had been stopped. In other words, Snowy wouldn’t be helping Yang Ye this time.

Mo Xiaoleng chuckled again when she thought up to this point.

Yang Ye shook his head when he heard her laughter. He really couldn’t stand her strange laughter. So, he didn’t hesitate to raise his hand and swing his sword. A ray of sword energy tore through the air and instantly arrived before Mo Xiaoleng.

Mo Xiaoleng didn’t waste her breath, and she immediately tossed the flame at Yang Ye’s attack.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s sword energy was instantly enveloped by flames and vanished. After that, the golden flame continued forward towards Yang Ye. Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly when facing this flame. He immediately withdrew the ancient sheath and grasped it in his left hand, and then he sheathed Heaven’s Gravestone. After that, he activated the Sword God’s Seal to improve his sword intent before finally drawing his sword when the flame was just around 1m away from him.

Bang!

The golden flame was instantly slashed into two. But Yang Ye’s expression changed because the flames instantly expanded upon being slashed apart, and it transformed into an ocean of flames that enveloped him.

The experts on the city walls revealed grim expressions at the sight of this. Especially Snowy, her eyes were opened wide while rage filled them, and she was about to open her mouth and inhale. However, numerous strands of sword energy suddenly shot out from the ocean of flames, and then the ocean of flames was instantly slashed into pieces. After that, a shadow flashed out. In an instant, the entire sky was filled with afterimages of Yang Ye!

The experts throughout Doomsday City heaved sighs of relief when they saw that Yang Ye was fine. As for the Demon Empress, her face was icy cold. She’d thought that it wouldn’t be very difficult for Mo Xiaoleng to defeat Yang Ye. After all, Yang Ye didn’t have the Sprite Lord and Spatial Mink’s help now. But now it would seem like it wasn’t easy for Mo Xiaoleng to defeat Yang Ye.

Mo Xiaoleng’s eyes instantly narrowed when she saw Yang Ye charge out of the flames, and then another flame appeared on her right palm. At the moment Yang Ye’s figure arrived before her, she immediately twisted her wrist, and the flame on her palm transformed into a wave of fire that assaulted Yang Ye.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then the sky was transformed into an ocean of fire. As for Yang Ye, he was outside the ocean of fire.

At this moment, Heaven’s Gravestone was covered in flames, and it was trembling violently. Obviously, it was in pain.

Yang Ye’s profound energy surged while his Rebirth Rank sword intent surged into Heaven’s Gravestone. It didn’t take long for a ray of light to shoot out from Heaven’s Gravestone, and the flames around it were instantly dispersed.

Yang Ye looked up at Mo Xiaoleng. At this moment, Mo Xiaoleng had a dark blue flame and golden flame in her palms. As soon as both flames were on her palms at the same time, the temperature here had instantly grown hot. Moreover, the space around Mo Xiaoleng had started to become slightly ethereal.

Yang Ye had an extremely solemn expression on his face. He wasn’t like Blind Maiden and couldn’t just disregard the flames. Both of those flames felt extraordinarily dangerous to him. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Mo Xiaoleng gazed at Yang Ye while a cold smile arose on the corners of her mouth. A moment later, she flipped her palms, and the flames instantly left her palms and shot towards Yang Ye. They expanded in midair and only took an instant to transform into 2 huge fire dragons. Once the huge fire dragons appeared in the sky, the temperature here instantly shot up. At this moment, it seemed like the space around them was on the verge of melting.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he took a step forward. Rebirth Rank sword intent instantly appeared before him, and then it started to become compressed.

Bang!

A moment of silence later, a terrifying wave of force swept out towards the huge fire dragons. Space collapsed in its wake as it shot forward and slammed against the huge fire dragons.

Bang!

As soon as they collided, the 2 huge dragons instantly exploded apart, and then countless threads of flames shot towards the surroundings and incinerated the space in their wake.

The army of demon beasts quickly retreated, and the Demon Empress acted quickly as well and dispersed the threads of flames. Because if the flames were to fall into the army, then it would definitely be a calamity. Quite some time passed before the surroundings gradually returned to calm.

Yang Ye and Mo Xiaoleng had moved around 3km back respectively.

There was a trace of seriousness in Mo Xiaoleng’s eyes. Even though she was very confident, she wasn’t conceited. She was very well aware that the man who stood before her was much stronger than she’d expected.

Yang Ye had a serious expression in his eyes as well. Even though Mo Xiaoleng was very young, her strength was extremely terrifying. Especially those flames. Even his Epoch Realm body wouldn’t be able to resist them.

Even though both of them feared each other, the battle still had to go on!

Mo Xiaoleng’s hands moved slightly, and then 2 balls of flames appeared on her palms. They were the dark blue and golden flames from before.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched as he slowly tightened his grip on Heaven’s Gravestone. He was ready to bring his sword intent to the brink at any moment. However, another flame suddenly emerged from within Mo Xiaoleng.

Yang Ye felt speechless.
