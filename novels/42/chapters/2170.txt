Chapter 2171 – Ten Moves!

The mark wasn’t long, and it was only around 3m long. It wasn’t deep either, and it was just a shallow mark. It was impossible to notice if one didn’t look carefully.

Of course, all of that wasn’t the main point, the main point was that it had been left behind by the Unfettered One.

Yang Ye gazed at the man before him. He’d met this man in the past, it was the armless man.

Based on what the Dao Progenitor had told Yang Ye, the man was the dean of Martial Emperor Academy.

The armless man walked over to the door of light, “Do you know what this is?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

The armless man said, “I don’t know either!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, the armless man continued, “It’s a very unusual place. Besides that, three people have been here. Two of them are the Martial Emperor and the person who left that mark!”

Yang Ye spoke without thinking, “What about the last person?”

The armless man smiled, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye glanced at him. Obviously, it was the armless man before him.

The armless man gazed at the door, “Three people, all three of us have been here. But do you know what happened in the end?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

The armless man explained, “The Martial Emperor went in and came out within ten minutes. After that, he gave up his position as dean and chose to live like a villager. As for the other one, he was in there a while longer. He only emerged around two hours later. However, he still did come out from in there. After that, he struck the door with his sword! That attack left that mark on the door, just that mark!”

Just that mark!

Yang Ye could discern something special about those words.

The armless man continued, “This door can be said to be the most mysterious place in our large universe.”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Is this the Star Gate?”

“The Star Gate?” The armless man gazed at Yang Ye, “Do really do know a lot. It should be that prehistoric expert who told you, right?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The armless man shook his head, “You should be more vigilant against them. They aren’t ordinary, not ordinary at all. As for this door, I don’t know if it’s the Star Gate or not. In any case, it isn’t something you can enter right now!”

Yang Ye asked, “Have you gone inside?”

The armless man shook his head, “Those two fellows came back out, so I think it won’t end well for me either.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Even the Unfettered One couldn’t resist whatever was on the other side?”

“Not at all!” The armless man said, “Based on that fellow’s strength, not to mention now, even if all the civilizations in the history of our entire large universe came back, they wouldn’t be able to do anything to him. There are no more than two reasons why he came outside again. One, there was nothing there that aroused his interest. Two, the people in there were strong, but they weren’t strong enough. So, he just left that mark behind. This mark carries two meanings. Firstly, it means he has a little interest in it, and he only left that mark behind because of his interest.”

Yang Ye asked, “What about the second meaning?”

The armless man said, “The second meaning is, what lies at the other side of this door isn’t ordinary at all!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a while, and then he said, “Senior, what do you think about the End Times?”

“What do I think?” He glanced at Yang Ye, “What do I care? It has nothing to do with me!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

The armless man continued, “You’re the leader of the human race now?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The armless man shook his head, “Do you feel like you don’t have enough problems? Or do you think it’s cool to be the leader of the human race?”

Yang Ye replied, “No. It’s just that since I’ve come this far, there are things that I should shoulder!”

A wisp of praise flashed through the armless man’s eyes, “That’s a good way to think. Men can never give up their responsibilities. Alright, forget that. go back to Martial Emperor Academy with me.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The armless man smiled, “Are you interested in taking control of Martial Emperor Academy?”

Taking control of the academy? Yang Ye frowned, “Senior, what are you trying to say?”

The armless man fell silent for a moment and explained, “When the Martial Emperor gave Martial Emperor Academy to me, I wasn’t interested either. However, I had to so that I could make him owe me a favor. Of course, I still have no interest in being the dean. But since you’ve been swept into the conflicts of the normal world, Martial Emperor Academy should be useful to you. If you take control of it, it’ll be very helpful to you and the human race.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why me?”

“Not you!” The armless man said, “You can’t be the dean!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

The armless man continued, “I’m talking about that little girl. If she’s willing, she can take the position of dean at any time. Of course, when she’s the dean, it’s no different than you being the dean. In any case, she’ll be your wife, sooner or later, right?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, the armless man roared with laughter, “You’re really quite amazing. I know a bit about her temper, and you’re really amazing to have been able to get her!”

Yang Ye glanced at him, “Was it Senior Martial Emperor who wanted her to become the dean?”

The armless man shook his head, “It’s my own intentions. Of course, he won’t have any objections. Because no one knows better how suitable she is. Moreover, she has obtained the Martial Emperor’s inheritance, and she’s the only person in the large universe who enjoys a reputation that’s on par with yours. If she chooses to be the dean, she would be able to convince everyone to support her. Now, it just depends on whether she is willing!”

Meanwhile, An Nanjing appeared by Yang Ye’s side.

The armless man gazed at her, and she gazed at Yang Ye and said, “I’m willing!”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Don’t force yourself if you don’t like it. I’m not afraid of anyone!” He naturally knew that he was the biggest reason why she’d accepted it. Because if she took control of the academy, it would be equivalent to Yang Ye possessing extraordinary support.

An Nanjing said, “It’s fine. Don’t worry.”

Yang Ye wanted to say more, but she said, “It’s decided!”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “Alright!”

“Let’s go!” Meanwhile, the armless man said, “I’ll take you there right now. Oh, it’s best if she assumes her position today. Then I’ll have one less burden. Hahaha!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand and vanished on the spot with them.

At the moment they left, Yang Ye and An Nanjing hadn’t noticed that the armless man had glanced at that door of light.

…

Martial Emperor Academy.

The middle aged man brought Yang Ye to Martial Emperor Peak in the academy. It was the main peak here, and it was where the core of the academy resided.

The armless man’s voice resounded throughout the academy, “All students, come to Martial Emperor Peak immediately!”

The dean!

At this moment, clamorous noise filled the academy.

It could be said that even some elders rarely met their dean. Because he was too mysterious. He was so mysterious that while everything knew the Vice Dean, they subconsciously allowed themselves to forget that the academy had a dean!

Now, the dean was back!

It didn’t take long for the students to rush over. It wasn’t just the students, even some elders and instructors had rushed over.

In next to no time, Martial Emperor Peak was bustling.

The armless man stood on the platform in front of Martial Emperor Hall, and there was an old man on his right. It was the vice dean. As for on his left, An Nanjing was there, and Yang Ye was by An Nanjing’s side.

Countless students stood below the platform, and all of them were looking at the armless man with curiosity in their eyes.

The armless man glanced at them and said, “Since I’ve been the dean, I rarely reside in the academy, and the vice dean has been managing everything. I know I’ve been derelict in my duties. Now, I announce that I won’t be the dean from this moment forward.”

Clamorous noise resounded!

He was stepping down!

The dean they hadn’t seen for so long was stepping down as soon as they met him!

All of them were shocked.

Meanwhile, the armless man added, “As for the new dean, I’ve found one for you.”

He gazed at An Nanjing, “I presume she’s not a new face to all of you. From this moment onward, she’ll take the position of dean. Of course, you can step forward if you’re not satisfied. So long as you can defeat her, you can be the dean!”

An Nanjing!

Everyone gazed at An Nanjing. She was naturally not an unfamiliar face to them. After all, she’d been in the academy.

As for being dissatisfied… There probably wasn’t a single person who would feel like that. Even if they did, they wouldn’t dare to step forward! She was an existence on par with Yang Ye, and she could kill Sages in an instant!

The armless man glanced at the surroundings and said, “Looks like you have no objections, then it’s decided. From today onward, she’ll be the new dean.”

He gazed at the vice dean and said, “I’ll be troubling you to work hard for a few more years!”

The vice dean laughed bitterly. He was quite depressed because both the deans were people who wouldn’t really manage the academy. It was how the Martial Emperor did things, and it was how the armless man before him did things too. Moreover, the armless man was worse because he was practically never present in the academy. If the academy hadn’t been in trouble and required the armless man to deal with it, he may have never met the armless man. Yet now, An Nanjing was taking the armless man’s position, and based on the situation, she was probably just like the last two deans!

A busy life!

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “Dean, I can be the dean if I defeat her?”

Everyone looked toward the source of the voice, and they saw a young man around the age of 20. He wore a white robe and had pride all over his face.

“It’s Senior Brother Yun Fan!” Someone exclaimed.

On the platform, the armless man gazed at the vice dean, and the latter said, “A genius who just joined. I forgot to tell you about him. He’s really good, and his natural talent is amazing. During this period that she wasn’t in the academy, he defeated all the seniors in the academy, and it took him less than ten moves each. He’s good in every aspect, except he’s too proud.”

Suddenly, the young man gazed at An Nanjing, and then he raised his thumb before twisting it down, “Ten moves! If I can’t defeat you in 10 moves, then I’ll walk on my knees from now on!”

Everyone here was stunned speechless.
