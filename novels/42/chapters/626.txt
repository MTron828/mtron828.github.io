Chapter 627 – Merge!

Elder Mu withdrew his gaze from the sky, and he glanced over before he said, “Oceanic Emperor, I never expected that an old geezer like you who never participates in the battles on the continent has actually come over as well. I’m really quite curious. What exactly did the Hallowed Grounds promise to actually make three fellows who have one foot in the grave to look for trouble with me!?”

The blue robed old man said, “My oceanic clans really does have no desire to interfere in the matters of the continent, but I’m unable to refuse the reward that the Hallowed Grounds provided.”

Elder Mu grinned and said, “All of you are at the end of your lifespans, so the only thing that can move your hearts is definitely the Divine Spirit Fruit which increases a Half-Saint’s lifespan by 300 years. Let’s cut the crap and just fight. Let me see if I can take another Half-Saint with me.”

The Oceanic Emperor’s eyes narrowed slightly as he said, “Are you that confident?”

“Why don’t we give it a try?” Elder Mu spoke flatly.

How could a Half-Saint have no temper? The Oceanic Emperor was just about to attack when the black robed old man stopped him and said, “A single Divine Spirit Fruit isn’t worth for us to fight with our lives on the line!” As he spoke, he gazed at Elder Mu and continued, “We came here today with a single request, and it’s for all of us to continue adhering to the agreement that Monarch Realm experts can’t interfere. Of course, the agreement will lose effect if Yang Ye attains the Monarch Realm, alright?”

Elder Mu glanced at them and said, “Remember what all of you said. If a Monarch Realm expert acts against him, then I won’t just kill a single person but an entire territory.”

“Aren’t you being a little too confident!?” said the Oceanic Emperor in a low voice.

“How much stronger are you than Luo Dao?” Elder Mu suddenly gazed at the Oceanic Emperor. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The Oceanic Emperor’s expression changed slightly. Perhaps he was a little stronger than Luo Dao, but he had no doubt that he couldn’t kill Luo Dao with such ease....

“Since I could kill him, then why can’t I kill you?” said Elder Mu.

The Oceanic Emperor had quite an unsightly expression on his face. In the end, he just grunted coldly and said fiercely, “Even if you can defeat me, I’ll definitely make you pay a horrible price!”

Elder Mu shook his head and smiled before he said, “Alright, all of that is just a waste of breath. Right, the reason I’m agreeing to your request isn’t because I’m afraid of you. I just don’t want that kid to be dependent on me because he needs to grow. That’s all.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Elder Mu vanished on the spot.

The black robed old man spoke solemnly once Elder Mu left, “His strength is probably at the peak of the Half-Saint Realm.”

“Even though he killed Luo Dao, he has definitely suffered injuries. So, we’ll definitely be able to eliminate him if we join forces, right?” said the Oceanic Emperor.

“Perhaps he wouldn’t be able to take any one of our lives, but he’ll absolutely be able to heavily injure us.” The white haired old man said, “Oceanic Emperor, do you really think a single Divine Spirit Fruit is worth the price we must pay to fight with our lives on the line against a Half-Saint?”

The Oceanic Emperor grunted coldly and said, “If we don’t kill him now, then once he recuperates completely... we wouldn’t be able to kill him even if we wanted to!” As soon as he finished speaking, the Oceanic Emperor instantly vanished on the spot.

“He really hopes that we fight the Undertaker to the death!” The black robed old man spoke abruptly once the Oceanic Emperor had left.

The white haired old man shook his head and didn’t speak a word. He just turned around, took a step, and then just vanished.

“The Hallowed Grounds is everywhere!” The black robed old man spoke softly before he vanished on the spot.

After the 3 of them vanished, another middle aged man appeared here. If the profounders at Ancient Domain City were here, they would notice that he was the City Governor of Ancient Domain City.

He glanced at the surroundings before a wisp of a strange smile appeared on the corners of his mouth, and then he vanished on the spot....

After the City Governor of Ancient Domain City vanished, space fluctuated here once more, and then Elder Mu appeared here again. He glanced at the direction that the City Governor had left towards, and then his brows knit together slightly while a trace of seriousness appeared in his eyes....

...

The Primordial Pagoda.

After 2 days of battle, Yang Ye’s Sword Intent and the comparatively intelligent Sword Intent had gradually gained the upper hand, and this caused the smile on Yang Ye’s face to widen.

Meanwhile, Xiao Yuxi and the others instantly heaved sighs of relief when they noticed Yang Ye’s expression. Yang Ye’s expression had been changing incessantly throughout the past few days. It was sometimes bitter, sometimes surprised, sometimes delighted.... Every single time his expression changed would cause their hearts to twitch.

Because they didn’t know what had happened after the Sword Seed entered Yang Ye’s body, and they didn’t know if he would be able to recuperate completely.... Fortunately, Yang Ye’s face had been covered in a smile since earning in the morning of the 2nd day, and it allowed the worry in their hearts to ease up.

The sword-shaped Sword Intent had started to be pushed back by the joint forces of Yang Ye’s Sword Intent and the comparatively intelligent Sword Intent. In the end, the sword-shaped Sword Intent actually started to flee.

Yang Ye was overjoyed. Of course, he wouldn’t miss such an opportunity and immediately urged his Sword Intent to pursue it. Meanwhile, the comparatively intelligent Sword Intent did the same. Both of them charged madly towards the sword-shaped Sword Intent....

After around 2 hours passed, the sword-shaped Sword Intent suddenly stopped moving and laid down motionlessly in front of Yang Ye’s Sword Intent....

Yang Ye was stunned, and the other Sword Intent was stunned as well and stopped on the spot.

Is it surrendering? After being stunned, such an absurd thought had appeared in his mind. It was quite absurd because would Sword Intent actually know how to surrender?

Meanwhile, the comparatively intelligent Sword Intent which had joined forces with Yang Ye’s Sword Intent had suddenly done exactly the same. It laid down motionlessly before Yang Ye’s Sword Intent.

They seemed to be instinctively displaying something, but it truly perplexed Yang Ye because he wasn’t Sword Intent but a human....

After all, they’d been engaged in a life or death battle just now, yet such a scene had suddenly appeared.

After quite some time passed, Yang Ye finally made a little sense of it.

Both of these Sword Intents had been left behind by experts in the Sword Dao from many years ago, and they couldn’t be considered to be complete Sword Intents. So long as they were destroyed, they would immediately vanish from the world, and they would still suffer such a fate even after they’d devoured so many different Sword Intents.

Because while they’d undergone a huge transformation, it was still unable to change the fact that they were without foundation, so they would vanish upon destruction!

But Yang Ye’s Sword Intent wasn’t the same. It would be limitless while he was still alive.

So, these 2 Sword Intents intended to merge with Yang Ye’s Sword Intent. Yes, they intended to merge and not be devoured. If they were devoured, then their consciousness would be completely wiped away, but if they were to merge, then their consciousness would be preserved. To a certain extent, it meant that they would still be themselves.

Most importantly, if they were to merge with Yang Ye’s Sword Intent, then they wouldn’t be without foundation anymore. They would be eternal while Yang Ye was still alive!

Of course, the main reason why the sword-shaped Sword Intent had acted in this way was that it had no other choice now.... It instinctively made the most beneficial choice to itself when facing danger.

Conversely, the comparatively intelligent Sword Intent had acted in this way because it was much more intelligent. It knew that it would be meaningless even if it devoured Yang Ye’s Sword Intent and the sword-shaped Sword Intent. Because it would cease to exist once it was destroyed just once.

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while, and then he decided to give his guess a try. He madly circulated his Sword Intent and urged it over to the other 2 Sword Intents....

As expected, his guess was correct.

The sword-shaped Sword Intent and the other comparatively intelligent Sword Intent surged towards his Sword Intent....
