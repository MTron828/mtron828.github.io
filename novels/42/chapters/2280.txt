Chapter 2281 – Our Dao is Different!

Killing people, the heart, the father, the mother, the loved ones, and all things!

Yang Ye frowned before the statue!

In his eyes, the dancing woman could still be seen there, but Exalt Yun couldn’t see it.

Exalt Yun frowned slightly when he saw Yang Ye’s reaction.

Suddenly, Yang Ye took a few steps forward, and he grew even closer to the Limitless Sword Scroll.

Yang Ye looked straight at it and said, “Kill people, the heart, the father, the mother, the loved ones, and all things. Such a person kills for the sake of killing, and is nothing more than a slave of slaughter.”

“You’re mistaken!” The voice spoke abruptly, “Strength! Everyone in the world is a slave to strength. Slaughter is just a type of strength. Since you’ve chosen the Dao of Slaughter, why don’t you take it to the extreme? Your heart and sword aren’t pure. If you can make it pure and bring it to the limit, then who in this world can be a match for you?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Slaughtering the world is not my desire.”

The voice asked, “What if the world wishes to kill you?”

Yang Ye looked at the scroll and said, “Then I’ll slaughter the world!”

“Is there any difference?” The voice continued, “There’s no difference. The only difference is that if you make the first move, you have the initiative, and you’ll be in a passive position if others act first!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “How can I offend others without being offended? It’s impossible for everything to go as you want in life, but you can seek to live life without guilt.”

He took two steps back, “As expected of the most precious treasure of Sword Sky City, you’re extraordinary. Unfortunately, our Daos are different. Farewell!”

Yang Ye turned around and left decisively without the slightest hesitation.

The Limitless Sword Scroll was very extraordinary. It had instantly pointed out the flaws in Yang Ye’s Slaughter Sword Dao.

Pureness!

His desire to kill wasn’t pure enough, so his Slaughter Sword Dao wasn’t pure enough either. True slaughter was just as the Limitless Sword Scroll had said, it killed everything. That would allow his Slaughter Sword Dao to rise to its limits.

If Yang Ye could accomplish that, his strength would definitely rise explosively! However, he wouldn’t be himself anymore.

He hadn’t forgotten what Tian Xiu had told him. If he went against his heart for the sake of the Dao and strength, the disadvantages would outweigh the cost.

Exalt Yun’s frown deepened when he saw Yang Ye leave. He was sure that something had happened between Yang Ye and the Limitless Sword Scroll, but he didn’t know what exactly it was.

Suddenly, a ray of light descended before Yang Ye.

It dispersed to reveal the Limitless Sword Scroll.

Exalt Yun’s expression changed drastically from the sight of this, and his eyes were filled with disbelief!

The first time!

It was the first time in countless years that the Limitless Sword Scroll had left the statue.

Countless sword howls suddenly resounded through Sword Sky City, and then rays of light shot through the sky and arrived in the air above Sky Sword Peak. However, they didn’t enter Sky Sword Peak.

They weren’t qualified!

However, three people did enter the mountain. A middle aged man, a beautiful woman in a long dress, and a woman in a green dress appeared around Yang Ye.

Exalt Yun’s expression changed slightly at the sight of them. He was about to bow to them, but the middle aged man shook his head slightly, and then he gazed at Yang Ye with the others.

Yang Ye gazed at the scroll before him in silence.

The woman in a red dress gradually appeared in his eyes.

“It has been tens of thousands of years!” The voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind again, “Millions have been here, but none of them were able to impress me, except you. Do you know why?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied seriously, “Because my talent in the Sword Dao is extraordinary, and I’m a peerless genius that’s difficult to come by!”

“Wrong!” The voice said, “Your talent is only above average, and countless possess talent that was much better than you.”

Yang Ye was very curious, “Then what did you see in me?”

The voice replied, “In the beginning, your Sword Domain; now, your Sword Heart.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “My Sword Heart?”

The voice explained, “Sword cultivators cultivate the heart. Sword cultivators must never lose their heart. Countless sword cultivators become enslaved by the sword and strength as they cultivate. They can disregard their hearts for the sake of the limits of the Sword Dao. But I just noticed that your heart can be summarized with the word “emotion”. If you sever your emotions, your strength would be far more than it is, but you didn’t. That shows that you are still staying true to your heart!”

Yang Ye glanced at the scroll and said, “And?”

The voice said, “Now, you need me; in the future, I will need you.”

Yang Ye asked, “What can you do for me?”

The voice replied, “Many things, like help you regain your Progenitor Realm sword intent!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. If his sword intent could return to the Progenitor Realm, his strength would increase by at least another 30%. While slaughter intent was powerful, he was a sword cultivator, and the Sword Domain was most terrifying when combined with sword intent. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

However, Yang Ye didn’t agree immediately, “What are your conditions?”

The voice fell silent for a short while and replied, “I think that you may be able to enter the Eternal River.”

“The Eternal River?” Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “What is that?”

The voice spoke softly, “A place that took the lives of countless supreme experts. In the last 100,000 years, no one has been able to pass through that river. My lifespan is coming to its end, and if I cannot pass through it, I will turn to dust. Choosing you is a risky gamble I’m taking.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time before he replied, “Alright!”

Swoosh!

The Limitless Sword Scroll suddenly transformed into a ray of light that entered Yang Ye’s forehead.

Bang!

In an instant, a terrifying wave of sword intent surged up into the air from Yang Ye, and his sword intent grew stronger and stronger. In just a short while, it was at the Sage Realm, but it was still rising rapidly.

The middle aged man spoke solemnly, “The sword intent she took thousands of years to cultivate… She’s just giving it away… What is she planning?”

The woman in a green dress tightened her grip on her sword in her right grasp. She looked at Yang Ye with an icy cold gaze, “Am I inferior to him?”

The beautiful woman’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Should we stop this?”

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time. Suddenly, he tapped his finger in Yang Ye’s direction.

A ray of sword energy surged at Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Exalt Yun hesitated to speak, and he didn’t stop them either. The current situation had far surpassed his expectations. He hadn’t expected the Limitless Sword Scroll to acknowledge Yang Ye as its master! It was a divine treasure of Sword Sky City, so it would be fine if Yang Ye belonged to Sword Sky City. But the problem was that Yang Ye wasn’t. So, they could absolutely not allow it to fall into Yang Ye’s hands.

Suddenly, Yang Ye opened his eyes. He hadn’t even done anything when the Limitless Sword Scroll shook violently, and then it devoured the middle aged man’s sword energy. An instant later, a strand of powerful sword energy surged out from it.

The middle aged man’s expression changed slightly, and he immediately raised his sword and swung it.

Bang!

The middle aged man’s expression instantly changed, and then he was blasted 3km away. As soon as he stopped himself, he hurriedly gazed at his sword, and he noticed that it had actually cracked open.

The middle aged man was shocked by this!

He wasn’t the only one, everyone else here was shocked too.

They hadn’t expected the Limitless Sword Scroll to possess such formidable strength. Even Yang Ye was quite surprised as he hadn’t expected it to be that strong!

Meanwhile, a woman in a red dress appeared here. She gazed at the middle aged man and said, “You’re far inferior when compared to your ancestor.”

The middle aged man’s face was quite unsightly, but he didn’t dare to say anything.

His ancestor!

His ancestor was the founder of Sword Sky City, the Limitless Sword Master. The Limitless Sword Scroll had been with the Limitless Sword Master all those years ago.

Meanwhile, the woman glanced at the surroundings and said, “All those years ago, I was merely working together with the Limitless Sword Master, and I didn’t submit to him. I didn’t stay in Sword Sky City because of him either, nor was it because of all of you. Now, I’ve found the person I’ve been waiting for, yet you intend to stop me? Don’t blame me for showing no mercy.”

The experts of Sword Sky City had quite unsightly expressions on their faces at this point.

It was especially so for Exalt Yun. At this moment, he felt extremely regretful. He’d hoped that Yang Ye could uncover the secrets of the Limitless Sword Scroll. After all, it was something the Limitless Sword Master had left behind, so it was definitely extraordinary. But he hadn’t expected that it would choose Yang Ye and plan to leave with Yang Ye. So, it was a terribly bad decision!

The woman in a red dress ignored the others here and gazed at Yang Ye. At this moment, Yang Ye’s aura was still rising incessantly.

His sword intent was growing stronger and stronger!

Finally, his sword intent broke through and attained the Progenitor Realm!

However, it was still rising!

The woman gazed at Yang Ye, and then her gaze slowly descended onto Yang Ye’s chest. She sensed energy that made her heart palpitate coming from inside there.

The woman in a red dress’ eyes narrowed slightly, and no one knew what she was thinking.

Meanwhile, Elder Yun and the others didn’t dare to attack. Yang Ye’s sword intent was at the Progenitor Realm now and coupled with the woman in a red dress who possessed unfathomable strength, they weren’t confident in their ability to deal with them. Especially when the woman had been with the Limitless Sword Master!

Not long after, Yang Ye’s aura gradually calmed down.

Sword intent!

Yang Ye slowly closed his eyes. His sword intent was back, and it was even stronger than before.

A short while later, Yang Ye opened his eyes and gazed at the woman in a red dress. At this moment, she was looking at him too. Their gazes met, and he was about to speak when the entire Sky Sword Peak shook violently. After that, numerous flying swords suddenly shot up into the air from all three main peaks of Sword Sky City.

The eyes of the woman in a red dress narrowed slightly, “The Limitless Sword Formation. Looks like they don’t plan to let you leave!”
