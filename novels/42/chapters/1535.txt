Chapter 1536 - I Can’t Compare To Him At All!

Translator: InVader

The young man had said that because the bodies of humans were far inferior to the demon race. Even though there were many body cultivators in the human race and their bodies were quite strong, there were very few outstanding body cultivators. Because very few could endure such unbearable pain.

So, just a single punch would be sufficient to determine if Yang Ye was a human.

Actually, they couldn’t be blamed for doubting him. Because Yang Ye truly stood out amongst them. He was too small, and he really didn’t seem like a demon beast when compared to the demon beasts around him.

Hu Meng glanced at the young man when he heard this, and then he revealed quite a strange expression.

Yang Ye was stunned as well. He hadn’t expected the young man to make such a request. He thought for a moment and replied, “It’s best if we don’t.”

“What?” A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of the young man’s mouth, “Are you afraid?”

“Coward!” Meanwhile, many demon beasts gazed at Yang Ye, and their eyes were filled with disdain.

In the demon race, refusing a challenge was extremely humiliating. It wasn’t a big deal if the gap between their strengths was too huge, and it would be a humiliation to the person who issued the challenge instead. However, the young man was just a Semi-Deity. So, based on their realms of cultivation, the young man wasn’t high. Thus, they felt disdainful when Yang Ye refused!

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m doing this for your own good! Trust me!”

“I think you’re a human!” The young man stared at Yang Ye, “I can’t sense your aura, so you’re definitely a human who has snuck in to obtain our demon race’s secrets or you have some other…”

Yang Ye suddenly interrupted the young man and said, “Are you ready?”

The young man was slightly stunned. He was about to speak when Yang Ye took a step forward and slammed a punch in his direction.

The young man was shocked when he sensed the force contained within Yang Ye’s punch, and he hurriedly swung a punch of his own.

Bang!

A muffled explosion resounded, and the young man was blasted away. In the air, the young man spat out a few mouthfuls of blood, and he flew for around 3km before he finally slammed against the ground.

Boom!

The ground shook violently while all the demon beasts in the surroundings were flabbergasted!

He’d been defeated in a single collision!

Yang Ye walked over to the young man. The young man was horrified and was about to speak, but Yang Ye waved his hand and the young man’s spatial ring flew into Yang Ye’s grasp. Yang Ye frowned after he scanned the spatial ring’s contents because there were only herbs within the spatial ring and no divine crystals.

Just like the spatial ring he’d obtained from Lan Chi in Colossus City. That spatial ring only had spirit herbs, spirit fruits, and other similar items as well. Even though they weren’t divine crystals, they weren’t bad. Based on their appearance, they weren’t of low quality, and they should sell for a good price!

Meanwhile, the young man on the ground said, “That’s mine!”

“Huh?” Yang Ye looked down at the young man and said, “Why don’t you repeat that?”

“You…” The young man stared at Yang Ye. Coldness suddenly arose in his heart as he gazed at Yang Ye’s emotionless face, and he immediately said, “That… that’s yours…”

Yang Ye shrugged, and then he turned around and walked to the stone pillar. Everyone gazed at Yang Ye as they wanted to know how strong he was.

Yang Ye clenched his right fist and slammed it against the pillar.

Boom!

The pillar shook violently. A moment of silence ensued before a ray of dazzling light erupted from the golden portion of the pillar.

Some of the demon beasts in the surroundings exclaimed, “Golden!”

The others had shock in their eyes. As for the young man who had been blasted away just now, there was a wisp of bitterness on the corners of his mouth.

Yang Ye gazed at Hu Meng and asked, “What does that mean?”

Hu Meng withdrew his gaze from the stone pillar and replied, “It represents that your physical strength is comparable to Dualism Realm experts!” He paused for a moment and continued, “To think that a freak like you is from the Goat Clan…”

Yang Ye gazed at the violet portion of the pillar, “That requires the Rebirth Realm to be lit up?”

Hu Meng nodded, “In theory, yes. However, some beneath the Rebirth Realm have made it light up. But those are the outstanding geniuses of our demon race.”

The Rebirth Realm! Yang Ye gazed at the violet portion and fell into deep thought. He’d used his full strength just now. In other words, his current physical strength was actually just comparable to a Dualism Realm expert. But based on what Hu Meng had told him, there were some geniuses in the demon race who possessed physical strength comparable to Rebirth Realm experts. In other words, his chances of getting the top three in the Meeting of the Clans wasn’t that high anymore!

After all, he couldn’t use his sword here!

Fortunately, he had the Elemental Breaker and Undying Elemental Body. Especially Elemental Breaker. To a certain extent, it could be considered as a counter to demon beasts!

It could pierce through one’s defenses!

So, his punches could cause real damage!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at Hu Meng, “Let’s go!”

Hu Meng nodded, and then he led Yang Ye away. They arrived at an expanse of underground cultivation rooms. The cultivation rooms were built by a clan of demon beasts, and they were extremely huge and numerous. There were tens of thousands of them. Moreover, every single one of them was around 3km in length and width. Besides that, if one required it, one could even ask for sparring partners!

However, it was extremely expensive. But they didn’t accept divine crystals, they required spirit herbs or spirit fruits.

In the Demon Territory, the common currency here was spirit herbs and spirit fruits.

Spirit herbs and spirit fruits were divided into ranks of quality. The Spirit Rank, Heaven Rank, Saint Rank, and Divine Rank. The spirit herbs Yang Ye obtained from Lan Chi and the young man were at the Saint Rank, and there were over 10,000 of them. Actually, it was quite a huge sum. However, it still wasn’t enough. Because just the cultivation rooms were 1,000 Saint Rank spirit herbs each.

Of course, this was a special period in time. Normally, it would only cost a few hundred.

The reason it was so expensive was naturally because many demon beasts had travelled to Heaven’s Vault City lately.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged within a room. Suddenly, Hu Meng entered the room, and Yang Ye gazed at him.

Hu Meng chuckled, “Want to train together?”

Yang Ye thought for a while, “Alright!”

Hu Meng was a nice person, so Yang Ye felt that he could give Hu Meng some guidance.

Hu Meng smiled, “I’m going to attack.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Yang Ye when his figure appeared again. After that, he slammed his fist at Yang Ye. Because he knew Yang Ye’s strength, he didn’t hold back.

When Hu Meng’s fist arrived a few centimeters away from Yang Ye, Yang Ye suddenly pressed his index and middle finger together before tapping it forward lightly, and it struck Hu Meng’s knuckle.

Bang!

Hu Meng instantly relaxed his fist and took numerous steps back. He only stopped after moving around 300m back!

Hu Meng was stunned, and he said, “Why… why did that happen?” He was bewildered because Yang Ye hadn’t used much strength just now.

Yang Ye grinned, “The flaws in your attack! So long as I locate the flaws in my opponent’s attack, I can cause the greatest amount of damage possible with the least amount of effort!”

He possessed the Enlightened Sword Heart, and its ability was to locate the flaws in the attacks of others. So long as he located their flaws, it didn’t matter whether he was using a sword. Moreover, when he pressed his fingers together earlier, he was actually using his fingers as a sword, but he just didn’t enhance it with profound energy and sword intent.

Hu Meng frowned and was very puzzled, “Flaws?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Every single move has flaws of its own. Just like your previous attack. You revealed your flaws. If I was holding a sharp weapon earlier, then not only would I have been able to deal with your attack, I would have been able to use the opportunity to take your life.”

“I understand now!” Hu Meng spoke solemnly, “This thing you’re talking about is something our demon race always suffers at the hands of the human race. Even though many of them are inferior to us in terms of physical strength and defenses, if it’s in terms of agility and that ability to locate flaws which you just spoke about, then we’re far inferior to the human race!”

The human race! Yang Ye shook his head and chuckled to himself. There’s a human right in front of you!

Meanwhile, Hu Meng added, “I can’t learn that technique of the humans!” He glanced at Yang Ye and continued, “How did you locate my flaws?”

Yang Ye remained calm and said, “By learning. I suffered at the hands of a human, so I worked hard to learn from them so that I won’t suffer the same problem again!”

Hu Meng asked, “Since that fellow was able to make you suffer a loss like that, that fellow should be strong. What’s that fellow’s name? Was that fellow one of the extraordinary geniuses of the human race?”

Yang Ye spoke seriously, “No, his name was Yang Ye. He’s a very extraordinary person, and I admire him from the bottom of my heart! He…”

“Yang Ye?” Hu Meng’s eyes suddenly opened wide, and he spoke with astonishment, “You met Yang Ye?”

Yang Ye was stunned, “You know him?”

Hu Meng laughed bitterly, “Is there anyone in our demon race that doesn’t know him?”

Yang Ye gulped, “How did you get to know about him?”

At this moment, Yang Ye was truly curious. His reputation in the lower dimensions was quite great, so it wouldn’t be strange if Hu Meng was from the lower dimensions. It wouldn’t be strange even if Hu Meng was part of the human race in the large world. Because everyone from the human race in the large world knew that he’d fought his way up into the large world!

However, this was the Demon Territory, and Hu Meng was clearly just an ordinary demon beast. But Hu Meng knew his name! RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Hu Meng nodded, “He’s an extremely formidable person!”

Yang Ye nodded and spoke in an extremely serious manner, “He’s formidable, extremely formidable! I can’t compare to him at all!”

Hu Meng was at a loss for words.
