Chapter 1022 – You’ll Feel Despair!

There was no sign of Yang Ye when they finally recovered from their shock, and they howled in unison with voices that were filled with anger.

The man wiped off the drop of cold sweat on his forehead and said, “I never expected that there’s actually someone who’s even more shameless than me in this world! Pursue him! He’s injured and won’t be able to escape!”

As he spoke, the man and the other savages shot off in Yang Ye’s direction.

...

At this moment, Yang Ye had raised his speed to its limits, and since he didn’t have profound energy to protect himself, such speed actually caused severe harm to his body.

However, it allowed him to greatly improve his speed for a short duration!

The woman spoke abruptly with a tone that carried a trace of ridicule, “Your actions earlier made me look at you in a new light, but the facts prove that I was wrong.”

Yang Ye didn’t speed and just continued increasing his speed like a madman.

She continued, “If we can live by fleeing, then your actions can be excused. After all, their strength far surpasses your own. But your current actions of harming your body in order to flee is extremely foolish. Because they’ll catch up in the end. At that time, you wouldn’t even be able to fight back in your exhausted state!”

Yang Ye still didn’t speak, and he just continued increasing his speed!

She added, “Death isn’t terrifying, it’s cowardice that’s terrifying. If there’s fear in a person’s heart, then that person will forever stay an ordinary person!”

At this moment, it was like they’d changed roles. The woman who likes to remain silent had suddenly started to speak while Yang Ye who liked to speak was maintaining silence.

After around 15 minutes passed, Yang Ye finally stopped.

Her voice carried ridicule as she said, “What? You’re not fleeing anymore?”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and he moved over to an ancient tree that would take over a dozen people standing hand in hand to encircle. He picked up a branch and started swinging it incessantly against the tree. Quite some time passed before he was able to carve out a door, and then a few more moments passed as he dug that area out. Next, he slapped his palm forward and obliterated the bits of the tree that he dug out.

After that, Yang Ye placed the woman inside the tree.

She looked him in the eyes and said, “What are you doing!?”

Yang Ye bent down close to the woman and said, “You’ll definitely die if you stay with me. You’re too weak right now. Just stay here. I’ll go fight them to the death after this. If... if my luck is good, perhaps I’ll be able to kill all of them; if my luck is bad, then I’ll naturally be killed. As for you, your fortune will decide if you’ll be able to survive. This is all I can do for you.”

She stared at him without blinking, “You fled so that you could hide me and face them on your own?”

As he gazed at her peerlessly beautiful face, he suddenly stretched out his hand and pinched her smooth face. He grinned and said, “Don’t be too moved by this. I mainly did this because I was afraid that you’d be a burden to me in battle.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye replaced the door he’d carved out to cover the gap, and then he repaired the marks he’d left behind when he carved out that door. It didn’t take long for the ancient tree to look exactly like it had before this, and there were just 2 small holes on it.

Yang Ye could see the woman looking at him through those small holes!

Yang Ye cracked a smile, and then he vanished from her field of vision.

A long time passed within the hole in the tree, and then the woman finally withdrew her gaze. At this moment, there were traces of ripples in her eyes.

“Time....” The woman’s faint voice resounded from within the hole in the tree.

...

Yang Ye traveled back the way he came. Just as he’d said, he was going to fight them to the death. As for fleeing.... He wanted to continue fleeing, but it was just as she’d said, he could flee for now, but he couldn’t flee forever. Because they’d lost the advantage they had, and coupled with the injuries he’d suffered, fleeing under such circumstances was completely pointless and would just waste his strength.

It didn’t take long for the savages to appear in front of Yang Ye.

One of them roared with fury upon noticing Yang Ye, and then he charged forward and stabbed his pike towards Yang Ye’s head.

Yang Ye’s expression remained calm when he saw the pike approaching, and he just punched forward.

Bang!

The pike and the savage’s arm instantly split apart, and the powerful force within his punch blasted the savage flying. The savage flew quite a distance before crashing to the ground. The others focused their gazes on him, and they noticed that his entire body had cracked apart!

All the savages were horrified!

Only the man in luxurious robes was visibly excited.

“Will you fight me in single combat, or are all of you going to gang up on me?” Yang Ye gazed at the man and said, “I’m not joking this time. I’m serious!”

The man in luxurious robes sized up Yang Ye and said, “Interesting. Your control over your physical strength has actually arrived at such a level. Amongst the people I know, no more than 5 are capable of accomplishing that.”

“So you can speak like a normal person!” Yang Ye gazed at the man with astonishment. He’d thought that the man was a savage as well, but a noble amongst the savages. However, he hadn’t expected the man to actually be able to speak like a normal person!

The man’s face darkened, “Do I not seem like a normal person?”

“You’re from the Radiant Dimension?” Yang Ye was quite excited. Because meeting a normal person in this damnable place was truly a cause for joy.

The man nodded.

“How rare!” Joy surged onto Yang Ye’s face, “How did you get to this damnable place?”

The man’s face became quite unsightly when he heard Yang Ye, and a long time passed before he spoke gloomily, “I was tricked.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and added, “What about you?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “I got in here by accident!”

“That makes me feel much better!” The man continued, “Allow me to introduce myself. I’m Shuai Wenyang from the Central Divine Prefecture.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye stated, “Yang Ye, Pine Prefecture!”

“Pine Prefecture?” The man gazed at Yang Ye as if he was looking at a freak, “You’re not from the Central Divine Prefecture?”

Yang Ye asked, “Is that strange?”

“Tsk, tsk....” Shuai Wenyang sized up Yang Ye and said, “You’re only a mid rank Half-Saint, but your control of strength surpasses Saints, and your physical body far surpasses ordinary Saints as well. I’d thought that you were from the Physique Sect, but I never expected you to actually be from Pine Prefecture! Alright, no matter what, I finally have someone to accompany me now. Hahaha!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. He sized up the savages behind the man and said, “So, since you’re from the Radiant Dimension, why are you ordering them to kill me? It made me have no choice but to flee through countless mountains throughout this time!”

“To think you have the gall to speak about that!” Shuai Wenyang suddenly revealed a livid expression, “Are you sure they were there to kill you and not find you?”

Yang Ye was stunned, “Find me?”

“What else!” Shuai Wenyang spoke furiously, “Once I found out about your arrival in this world, I started sending people to search all over for you. But you immediately attack upon encountering the people I sent. Can’t you even give them a chance to say something?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Through the subsequent conversation he had with the man, Yang Ye found out that besides the first group of savages, all the other savages hadn’t been searching for him to kill him, and it was he who’d mistaken their intention. Yang Ye’s lips couldn’t help but twitch when he realized this.

After all, he’d suffered so much for nothing!

He’d been constantly filled with anxiety throughout that period. After all, he’d thought that there were at least over 100 Saints who were pursuing him with the intent to kill!

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment and asked, “Why are there so many Saints here? Moreover, there isn’t any spirit energy here, so how did they attain the Saint Realm without any spirit energy?”

Shuai Wenyang explained, “Firstly, they can’t be considered to be true Saints. There’s quite a gap between them and an actual Saint. Secondly, while there isn’t any spirit energy here, there are things that can allow their body to attain the strength of a Saint. In short, this damnable place is extremely complicated and dangerous.”

“Do you know how to leave this place?” Yang Ye asked the most important question. He absolutely couldn’t stay here for long. After all, An Nanjing, Yu Wushuang, and all the others were still waiting for him. Especially when they weren’t in the safest situation.

Shuai Wenyang nodded in response, and this delighted Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Shuai Wenyang spoke, “Even though I know how to leave this damnable place, I have to tell you the cruel truth. You should give up on such thoughts. Because I would have left this damnable place if it could be done!”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment and asked, “Having a way is better than having nothing!”

Shuai Wenyang shook his head, “Once you witness the situation there, you’ll feel despair, and then you’ll just choose to live in this damnable place with me!”

Roar!

Suddenly, a loud roar resounded somewhere in the distance, and it caused everyone here to bleed from all 7 of their apertures, including Yang Ye!

The savages immediately fell flat on the ground, and they trembled as they howled incessantly with pain. It seemed like they were begging for mercy.

At this moment, Shuai Wenyang had an extremely solemn expression on his face as well, and his eyes were filled with fear and terror.

Yang Ye had an extremely solemn expression on his face as well. What is that? It was actually able to injure me with just a roar, and it even makes me have the impulse to kneel down in submission!
