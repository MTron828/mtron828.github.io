Chapter 1795 – Ancestor Summoning!

You’re all trash!

Hearing that made Ying Yu and the others reveal extremely unsightly expressions!

Especially Ying Yu. After all, everyone had been watching while he’d been completely suppressed by a 2nd stage True Realm expert just now! Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

It was an absolute humiliation to him!

At the same time, he was shocked.

He was shocked by her strength!

He hadn’t expected her to be so strong. After all, she was clearly another monstrous genius comparable to Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang!

Just thinking about facing three monstrous geniuses like these in the future made Ying Yu and the others’ expressions become even more unsightly.

Suddenly, An Nanjing vanished on the spot, and she was in front of them when she appeared again.

The experts from the Wu Clan were stunned by this.

What is she planning?

Does she intend to fight six on her own?

Meanwhile, a wave of powerful intent appeared here. Once the first wave appeared, the second did, and then a third…

In next to no time, six powerful intents had appeared around her!

All of them were at the True Rank!

Six True Rank intents!

Ying Yu and the others’ pupils constricted at the sight of this. They weren’t the only ones, even the Undertaker frowned. Obviously, An Nanjing’s natural talent had shocked him a little.

“Strike!!” Meanwhile, An Nanjing’s voice resounded, and then she grabbed Skysplit with both hands and slammed it forward.

It was enhanced by six types of powerful intents!

Boom!

A rumbling explosion resounded, and then Ying Yu and the others were blasted over 300m back!

An Nanjing was about to attack again when the Undertaker suddenly appeared in front of her, and then a huge fist shot straight for her.

An Nanjing showed no fear at all, and she stabbed Skysplit forward.

Boom!

The fist shattered, but An Nanjing was blasted 300m away before stopping herself, but Skysplit was still trembling.

The Undertaker gazed at her for a while and said, “An extraordinary genius.”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure shook and instantly appeared before her, and then he slammed his fist forward again.

Ferocity flashed through An Nanjing’s eyes, and then she tapped the tip of her foot against the ground and spun 360 degrees on the spot. At the same time, she swung Skysplit.

Bang!

An Nanjing was blasted 300m away, but the Undertaker was pushed 30m back as well.

The Undertaker glanced at his palm. There was a mark on it. He fell silent for an instant and looked up at An Nanjing, “Needless to say, you’re very strong. Unfortunately, you’re far from being a match for me!”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking, and then a wave of powerful force shot towards An Nanjing.

Everywhere it passed, even space warped before it.

Space didn’t shatter and just warped. It was completely warped and even seemed capable of mincing apart anything within it!

An Nanjing’s pupils constructed, and then she took a step forward. As soon as she took that step, six types of powerful intents swept out from her. Just like that, these two waves of powerful energy slammed against each other in midair!

Bang!

The space in a huge area instantly collapsed!

Everyone else here moved backwards repeatedly.

It didn’t take long for space to return to normal. Meanwhile, An Nanjing and the Undertaker’s figures appeared before them.

At this moment, there was a trace of scarlet red on the corner of her mouth!

The Undertaker was about to attack again when Wu Ye suddenly appeared before him.

Everyone gazed at Wu Ye, even the experts of the Wu Clan itself.

Wu Ye was clearly trying to protect An Nanjing!

Wu Ye had been quite hesitant previously, but he stopped hesitating once he witnessed her strength.

Protect her!

Even if they had to pay a certain price, they had to protect her!

Meanwhile, Ying Yu suddenly gazed at Wu Ye, “Brother Wu, is it worth it?”

Wu Ye glanced indifferently at Ying Yu, “Even though she isn’t a part of my Wu Clan, she’s my founding ancestor’s disciple. So, she can be considered as a member of my Wu Clan. Ying Yu, my Wu Clan doesn’t want to interfere in your business with Yang Ye, but I hope that you don’t disturb An Nanjing.”

Ying Yu looked him in the eyes, “We insist on taking her today!”

Wu Ye’s eyes became icy cold, “Why don’t you give it a try!”

“I will!” It wasn’t Ying Yu who said this, it was the Undertaker. As soon as he finished speaking, he soared up into the sky, and a ferocious beast’s phantom appeared behind him. A moment later, he stretched out his right hand and slapped it down at Wu Ye.

Roar!

The ethereal beast phantom behind him suddenly roared at Wu Ye, and then a wave of invisible energy rained down from the sky while accompanied by a huge palm capable of holding up the sky.

At this moment, everyone in Martial Heaven City felt suffocated. Even Wu Wen and the other True Realm experts felt extremely uncomfortable and slightly suffocated.

Ferocity flashed through Wu Ye’s eyes, and then he stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of white light that shot up into the sky. It was extremely swift and instantly slammed against the huge palm.

Boom!

It was like a thunderclap resounding through the sky. Everyone felt dazed by it, and then a wave of terrifying energy erupted from the point of collision. Everywhere it passed, the space in the surroundings rippled violently.

Boom!

Suddenly, an explosion resounded from the center of the wave of energy, and then a figure was blasted out of there.

The experts of the Wu Clan instantly revealed unsightly expressions.

Because it was Wu Ye!

The Undertaker suddenly waved his right hand in midair. In an instant, the wave of energy was torn apart and obliterated by an invisible force. Meanwhile, the Undertaker gazed at Wu Ye.

He didn’t say a word, and he just charged at Wu Ye.

Meanwhile, Ying Yu suddenly gazed at Wu Wen’s group. He fell silent for a moment before ferocity flashed in his eyes, “Don’t hold back and kill them all!”

Lu Yuntian and the others’ expressions changed when they heard this. What is he planning? He plans to annihilate the Wu Clan?!

But it did make sense to them. Because they had the Undertaker’s help right now. Coupled with the fact that their five clans had joined forces, they had the strength to crush the Wu Clan. Moreover, it was the best time to do so.

Ying Yu clearly didn’t want to miss such a perfect opportunity!

Wu Wen clearly understood Ying Yu’s intentions, so he immediately waved his right hand. In an instant, the formation below trembled, and then numerous beams of light shot up into the sky towards Ying Yu’s group.

At the same time, the experts of the Wu Clan shot up into the sky from within the city.

Fight!

An Nanjing naturally didn’t choose to leave. The Wu Clan had fallen into this situation because of her, so how could she leave?

An Nanjing charged at Ying Yu.

Ferocity flashed through Ying Yu’s eyes when he saw An Nanjing charge at him, “Let me see how monstrous you are!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he charged at An Nanjing as well.

Even though the Wu Clan had its defensive formation, they fell into a disadvantaged position as soon as the battle began. Because the Ying Clan’s coalition was a coalition of five clans, and they had the Undertaker too.

Under such circumstances, the Wu Clan’s forces were naturally unable to withstand their attack!

A battle to the death!

It didn’t take long for the Wu Clan’s True Realm experts to fall in succession while Wu Ye was being pushed back repeatedly by the Undertaker.

“Summon our ancestor!” Suddenly, Wu Ye’s voice resounded from the sky.

Wu Wen didn’t hesitate to wave his right hand, “Ancestral Summoning.”

As soon as he gave the order, Martial Heaven City shook violently, and then a beam of pure white light shot up from the center of the city before the ethereal figure of a middle aged man emerged from the beam of light!

Wu Mu!

The Wu Clan’s ancestor. Actually it wasn’t Wu Mu. Wu Mu was the one who revived the Wu Clan, and his strength had surpassed its founding ancestor.

So, the Wu Clan’s Ancestral Summoning summoned Wu Mu instead.

Ying Yu and the others’ expressions changed when they saw Wu Mu. After all, Wu Mu had been a practically invincible existence in the medium universe!

Besides Wu Ye and the Undertaker, everyone else stopped fighting.

Ying Yu and the others naturally didn’t dare to continue their attack until Wu Mu was dealt with.

Wu Mu glanced at the surroundings, and there was a dazed expression in his eyes. But it didn’t take long for his gaze to clear up. In the end, he gazed at An Nanjing and grinned.

An Nanjing bowed slightly to him in silence.

Wu Mu nodded, and then he gazed at Ying Yu. The latter’s expression changed slightly. Meanwhile, Wu Mu gazed at the Undertaker, and then he tapped his finger in the Undertaker’s direction.

Boom!

The Undertaker was blasted over 1km away.

Once the Undertaker stopped himself, he looked up at Wu Mu, and then his expression changed slightly, “It’s you!”

A wisp of surprise flashed through Wu Mu’s eyes, “You recognize me?”

The Undertaker spoke solemnly, “I saw you get through Heaven Pillar Mountain.”

Wu Mu nodded slightly, “I see!”

Meanwhile, a ferocious smile curled up on the corners of the Undertaker’s mouth, “I would immediately leave if it was your main body. But you’re just a strand of soul now.”

As soon as he finished speaking, his body started floating up slowly. At the same time, a powerful aura seeped out from within him.

The aura grew stronger and stronger…
