Chapter 1245 – All Who Have Are Dead!

Yang Ye gazed at the old man, “Can I ask you a few questions before you take my body?”

“You still intend to ask questions when you’re about to die?” The one-armed young man spoke fiercely, “You severed one of my arms just now. Now, I’ll take both of your arms.”

He was about to attack while he spoke, but the old man stopped him, “This body is about to be mine. I don’t want him to be injured!”

The young man didn’t dare to disobey the old man. So, he grunted coldly before turning around to gaze at Yun Banqing, “Since I can’t touch him, I can touch this little girl, right?”

The old man said, “That depends on your junior sister!”

The young man gazed at the beautiful woman in palace attire. Meanwhile, she revealed a smile and said, “Senior Brother, her body will be mine soon. How could I allow you to do anything to her?”

The young man glanced at her and spoke indifferently, “Didn’t you like my Howling Melody Sword? I’ll give it to you later!”

Her eyes lit up, “Really?”

The young man spoke coldly, “Would I lie?”

The smile on her face grew even brighter, “Then it’s decided.” She glanced at Yun Banqing and continued, “However, you have to be gentle. Don’t damager her body.”

The young man’s gaze descended onto Yun Banqing, and he spoke fiercely, “Don’t worry, I will!”

Yun Banqing’s eyes drooped, and she remained silent.

Yang Ye glanced at the one-armed young man, “Only incapable men vent their anger on women. You’re really useless!”

The one-armed young man glared even more ferociously at Yang Ye, “What did you say!?”

Yang Ye replied, “I cut off your arm, so come at me if you want to take revenge! Why bully a woman?”

The one-armed man’s face grew extremely unsightly. Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “You can’t defeat me, so you intend to vent on a woman. Isn’t that a sign of uselessness? The Sword God’s Palace was the number one power on the continent all those years ago, so why has it given birth to such a piece of trash like you? You probably were only able to attain the Emperor Realm by pushing your cultivation up with violet crystals, right?”

“I pushed it up with violet crystals?” The one-armed man spoke fiercely, “You weren’t even born when I swept through the continent!”

Yang Ye replied, “You lived for so long yet are still an Emperor and still act like this? Looks like you wasted your life!”

As he spoke, Yang Ye glanced at the others here and said, “It’s the same for all of you. Just look at yourselves! You’re like walking corpses! Sword cultivators should be unafraid of death, but all of you kept taking the bodies of others just to live, and you’re all living like dogs. To be honest, while all of you are still alive, it’s better to just die.”

This time, all of them had unsightly expressions on their faces.

Yang Ye continued, “I actually felt a little anticipation before this. Because I felt that all of you who survive would at least have things that you persisted on and lines that you wouldn’t cross. But now it seems like you’re just a bunch of trash, and I have no need for such trash.”

“What a joke!” The old man suddenly said, “We’re trash? Kid, I admit that your talent is extraordinary, but allow me to tell you that every single one of the people standing before you was an extraordinary expert that once roamed freely through the world. Their cultivations have dropped because they seized the body of another! As for our act of taking the bodies of others... would anyone give up the chance to survive?”

Meanwhile, the one-armed man laughed coldly, “You just said all that because you want to protect her. Haha! Let me tell you that I’ll take real good care of her!”

“You think too highly of yourself!” Yang Ye glanced at the one-armed man, and then he gazed at the old man, “Didn’t you want to take over my body? Do it!”

The old man gazed at him and said, “Seeing how you’re so calm and composed makes me hesitate a little!”

A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “Are you afraid?”

“Afraid?” The old man chuckled for a while before he looked at Yang Ye, “Would I fear you? Kid, you’re definitely an extremely mentally strong person since you were able to attain sword intent above the Void Rank, and you’re so calm and composed for no reason other than being very confident of yourself. If I was just an Emperor, then I really wouldn’t dare to try and take your body. But allow me to tell you that while my body is that of an Emperor, my soul is that of a Voider.”

Yang Ye’s face instantly turned ghastly pale when he heard this, and there was even terror in his eyes.

The others here instantly revealed cold smiles when they saw Yang Ye react like that, and the one-armed man ridiculed, “I thought that you would be so unyielding, but aren’t you acting just like an ordinary person when facing death? To think you had the gall to talk about us when you’re afraid of death as well!”

“It’s normal to be afraid of death!” The old man was smiling from ear to ear, “Kid, don’t worry, I will definitely not bring shame to this body of yours.” He waved his right hand as he spoke, and the one-armed man and the others immediately moved backwards.

The old man said, “Didn’t you want to ask me something earlier? Come, tell me what it is. I’ll satisfy your last wish!”

Yang Ye glanced at the old man and said, “Are the Sword God’s Seal and Stellar Sword Diagram in your possession?”

“So you’re here for that!” The old man said, “I can tell you frankly that both of them aren’t in my possession.”

Yang Ye asked another question, “Then where are they?”

“They are probably at the main hall. However, no one can get in there. No, once I take your body, and if I’m able to attain sword intent above the Void Rank, then I might be able to enter the main hall!” The old man smiled, “So, you can rest in peace. Because I’ll help you get both of them!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’m not worried at all. One last question, have you seen that expert who destroyed Sword God’s Palace?”

The old man and the others’ expressions changed when they heard Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at them and asked, “What?”

The old man stared him in the eyes and stared, “All who have are dead.”

Yang Ye nodded lightly, “I understand. Do it.”

The old man laughed coldly. Meanwhile, the beautiful woman in palace attire spoke abruptly, “Be careful!”

The one-armed man spoke as well, “I feel that there’s something strange about that kid. Senior Brother, you have to be careful. Don’t let him turn the tables on you.”

“I refuse to believe that the soul of a Saint is stronger than the soul of a Voider!” The old man said, “As for our willpower. Hmph! I’ve cultivated until the Voider Realm, so how could my willpower be weaker than his!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man’s soul left his body and entered through the center of Yang Ye’s forehead.

The others and even Yun Banqing’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye. Even though she was aware of the strength that Yang Ye possessed, the old man had once been a Voider!

Could Yang Ye resist a Voider that was trying to take his body?

Time passed by slowly.

Suddenly, Yang Ye opened his eyes.

Yun Banqing and the others instantly became anxious when they saw Yang Ye open his eyes. The one-armed man and the others didn’t show any excitement or happiness, and they were looking vigilantly at Yang Ye instead.

Yang Ye took a deep breath while excitement and madness filled his eyes, “I succeeded, I succeeded! A new body! A perfect body! Hahaha!”

Yun Banqing’s eyes swiftly opened wide upon hearing him, and her face turned even paler. As for the one-armed man and the others, they heaved sighs of relief. The one-armed man laughed coldly, “He seemed so confident earlier that I thought he could resist you, Senior Brother. But now it would seem like I overestimated him!”

The beautiful woman smiled, “Even though his sword intent is above the Void Rank, he’s still a Saint in the end. How can the soul of a Saint possibly resist the soul of a Voider? Unless the founding ancestor was reborn, then perhaps it would be possible.”

Meanwhile, the one-armed man’s gaze descended onto Yun Banqing, and he smiled with lust, “Little Girl, come, let me show you some affection!”

He was about to act once he finished speaking. However, Yang Ye’s cold voice suddenly resounded, “What? Is your head so full of lust that you’re even disregarding your senior brother?”

The one-armed man was stunned, and then he instantly came to an understanding when he saw the iron chains around Yang Ye’s legs. He turned to glance at the beautiful woman, and then they nodded at each other before forming seals. It didn’t take long for the iron chains to vanish.

Once they vanished, the one-armed man started walking towards Yun Banqing. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly appeared before Yun Banqing. The one-armed man frowned at the sight of this, “Senior Brother, what’s the meaning of this?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Yang Ye glanced coldly at the one-armed man and said, “Do you still want to leave this place?”

The one-armed man was stunned, and then wild joy swept through him, “I almost forgot about that. I presume that Senior Brother has obtained his concealment technique, right?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Yang Ye nodded, and the one-armed man and the others were instantly filled with excitement. We can leave!

They’d been trapped here for countless years, and the only reason they remained alive was to leave. Now, they could finally do so, so how could they not feel excited?

A short while passed before the one-armed man asked, “Senior Brother, how did he do it?”

The others gazed at Yang Ye as well.

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “The reason he was able to conceal his aura wasn’t any technique, it was a type of formation.”

The one-armed man frowned, “A formation?”

Yang Ye nodded, “If it wasn’t for a powerful formation, do you think he would have been able to deceive that existence?”

The one-armed man thought for a moment and said, “That does make sense. That existence’s strength is extraordinary. I’m afraid even some Void Rank techniques wouldn’t be able to deceive her at all, and perhaps only a powerful formation can accomplish that.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Senior Brother, what formation is it?”

Yang Ye glanced at the one-armed man and said, “The Universe Concealment Formation!”

“The Universe Concealment Formation?” The one-armed man frowned, “What is that?”

Meanwhile, the beautiful woman said, “Don’t worry about that. Just let Senior Brother set it up.”

The one-armed man nodded, “Right!”

Yang Ye said, “2 things are required to set up the formation. Violet crystals and swords at the Emperor Rank, so give me all you have. Remember, the more the better. Otherwise, it might fail. Once it fails, I might suffer backlash. Moreover, it might destroy the violet crystals and swords used to set up the formation. So, don’t hide your possessions and give it all to me. Our chance to leave this place depends on it!”

As he spoke, Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “Everything!”
