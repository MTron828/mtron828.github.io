Chapter 2577

Yang Ye decisively abandoned his unrealistic thoughts upon hearing her!

Moreover, how could he do something like robbing the man?

It wasn’t his style!

Yang Ye glanced at the ring. Meanwhile, the middle aged man said, “One Ancient Token!”

Yang Ye glanced at him and asked, “Little Qi…”

Qi Bitian replied indifferently, “I don’t have another!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly and shook his head, “Sorry, I don’t have more!”

The middle aged man wasn’t disappointed and grinned instead, “I’ve gained a lot today.”

He sized up Yang Ye and asked, “Young Brother, is this your first time here?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Yes. May I know your name?”

The middle aged man hesitated for a moment and smiled, “Ye Wenfeng! Of course, they all call me the Ascetic or Ascetic Ye!”

Yang Ye’s eyes were filled with bewilderment as he didn’t really understand, “Ascetic?”

The Ascetic smiled, “You’ll understand in the future.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly and shot a glance into the distance, “Does this bridge have an end?”

The Ascetic replied, “Yes, but your current strength isn’t sufficient to get there.”

Yang Ye asked, “What bridge is this?”

The Ascetic replied, “A nameless bridge. No one knows its true name. At the very least, no one I know is aware of its name.”

He glanced at the surroundings and said, “Don’t leave this bridge. Once you do, you’ll cease to exist.”

Yang Ye frowned slightly and glanced out the bridge, “There’s danger there?”

The Ascetic smiled, “Grave danger. Only death awaits outside the bridge.”

“He’s right.” Suddenly, Qi Bitian’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “There’s something quite strange outside the bridge, so don’t go out there.”

Yang Ye asked without thinking, “Can you?”

“Of course!” Qi Bitian replied, “Where can’t I go?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, the Ascetic glanced behind Yang Ye and shook his head, “Looks like there are no more customers for today.”

He put the ring away and intended to walk away.

Suddenly, Yang Ye asked, “Senior, do you know Eternal Kingdom?”

The Ascetic stopped and nodded, “Of course. Are you from there?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The Ascetic smiled, “There are a few outstanding individuals over there.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Senior, are you not from Eternal Kingdom?”

The Ascetic shook his head, “I’m from the Posuo World.”

He grinned and continued, “I’ve said enough. I hope we meet again!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and walked in the direction behind Yang Ye. It only took a while for him to vanish from Yang Ye’s field of vision.

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly.

“The Posuo World?” Yang Ye asked, “Little Qi, have you heard of it?”

Qi Bitian replied indifferently, “I have!”

Yang Ye asked, “What kind of place is it?”

In the Primordial Pagoda, Qi Bitian sat before the bamboo house and said, “A pretty good world. There’s a clan there, the Posuo Clan. It’s a clan that’s hmm… quite interesting!”

Quite interesting…

Yang Ye felt very speechless, “What do you mean quite interesting? Can you be a little more specific?”

Qi Bitian explained, “A very, very long time ago, some experts chose to fight against Destiny. They wanted to overcome it and achieve greatness. Of course, practically all of these people are dead! Even if some survived, they can’t show themselves in the outside world. But there is a clan that didn’t choose to fight Destiny, they chose to avoid Destiny. The Posuo Clan. They are the most famous clan because their Posuo World can avoid Destiny. Of course, there’s a price to pay, and the price is that their experts can never take that step in their lifetimes. They must stop before they take that step!”

Qi Bitian sighed, “Actually, it’s a very good outcome.”

Yang Ye came to an understanding.

The Posuo Clan had actually just accepted their fate!

But Yang Ye didn’t think that they would really just accept their fate. Because the stronger someone was, the more prideful a person would be, and they were increasingly unlikely to just accept their face!

They could clearly live longer, so why just accept their fate?

Not to mention others, even he was of the same mind!

Of course, the Posuo World had nothing to do with him. It was something he may come into contact with in the future, but it was only in the future!

Yang Ye continued forward.

The bridge was very quiet. Besides the old woman and the Ascetic, he hadn’t met anyone else here.

It was even quieter outside the bridge! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Yang Ye looked out the bridge as he walked. Endless black waters filled his vision. There were no fluctuations, and it was deathly still!

When he asked Qi Bitian, her reply was that she didn’t know, and he could find out by venturing outside himself!

Yang Ye decisively refused that request!

Qi Bitian could go out there, but could he? He had to keep a low profile at a time like this, he had to stray to stay unnoticed as best he could!

Qi Bitian was unreliable and couldn’t be trusted!

Just like that, Yang Ye continued forward, and around an hour later, the sound of fighting could be heard ahead.

Yang Ye sped up, and it didn’t take long for him to stop. It was because the fighting was right in front of him, but he couldn’t see anything!

He was certain it was right in front of him!

After a short moment of hesitation, Yang Ye didn’t use the Sword Domain. If he used it right now, it was very likely to cause trouble for him.

Yang Ye asked, “Can you see it?”

“Yes I can!” Qi Bitian continued, “Two fellows are fighting there! Just a short distance ahead of you!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Then why can’t I see them?”

Qi Bitian replied, “Because you’re weak!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, Qi Bitian continued, “They set up a barrier here, and it’s boundlessly huge on the inside. So, they can fight to their heart’s content, and it’s also the reason you can’t see them. Anyway, just continue forward.’

Yang Ye asked solemnly, “Who’s fighting in there?”

She shrugged, “How would I know? Oh, I understand what you mean. You’re asking why all the people here are so strong, right?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Qi Bitian fell silent for a short while and said, “Little Yang, how much do you know about this world? How much do you know about the origin of the boundless universe? As far as you’re concerned, I’m far beyond your reach because you think I know much more than you, and I’m much stronger than you. But I can tell you that even I am still lost before this universe. Let me give you an example. Our bodies are formed from many extremely tiny cells, right? They are so small that they are impossible to detect with just the naked eye. So, let me ask you this. If they gain consciousness and wish to figure out what they are, do you think it’ll be difficult?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

She continued, “This universe is huge, and very complicated.”

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “Luckily, my goal isn’t to explore the universe!”

Qi Bitian asked curiously, “What is your goal?”

Yang Ye smiled, “To be beyond being bullied by anyone!”

Beyond being bullied!

It was his objective. His final goal was to live a peaceful life with his loved ones. Of course, he wasn’t that na?ve. So, he had to constantly grow stronger, but at most times, he felt very lost. He wondered how strong he had to be?

Of course, there was one other thing. The stronger he got, the more he came into contact with.

If he could gain a little more knowledge of this universe or see a little more of it, it would actually be quite beneficial to him!

In the Primordial Pagoda, Qi Bitian shook her head and said, “Let’s skip that topic. You wanted to know why there are so many strong experts here, right? It’s the Origin of a universe, so it’s very likely for some things to exist here. The traces left behind during the formation of the universe. These elusive and seemingly unreal things are very attractive to those supreme experts. Wait, I mean those people you think are supreme experts! Understand?”

Yang Ye wanted to ask more questions, but she grew impatient. “Can you stop asking questions?”

Yang Ye felt quite speechless, “I was just a little curious!”

Qi Bitian, “Your curiosity is a little too beneath me. You keep asking immature questions!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

A short while passed before Yang Ye continued forward, and the fighting was still going on behind him!

Yang Ye walked for a while before he gradually started to frown, “Little Qi, why do I feel like something is off?”

Qi Bitian asked, “What feels off?”

Yang Ye replied solemnly, “Why do I feel like someone is following me?”

She replied, “You were being followed from the beginning!”

Yang Ye was stunned!

He was stunned for a while before he became extremely vigilant, “Little Qi, why didn’t you tell me about it?”

She replied indifferently, “You didn’t ask!”

Yang Ye was absolutely speechless, “Little Qi, you need to learn how to be a little more reliable!”

He was really speechless. She knew that someone was following him, but she didn’t tell him! She was absolutely unreliable!

Meanwhile, a voice came from behind Yang Ye, “You’ve noticed my presence?”

Yang Ye turned around, and he saw the old woman who he’d met right after arriving on this bridge.

She walked over to him, “You really aren’t ordinary. You were actually able to notice my presence. Looks like you have quite a few secrets!”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “May I know why you’ve been following me?”

She revealed a very cold and gloomy smile, “Why don’t you give it a guess?”

Yang Ye blinked, “To rob me?”

She nodded, “Correct. I never expected you to have an Ancient Token, and you even used it to get a Super Divine Treasure. You’re really wealthy!”

Yang Ye hurriedly shook his head, “No! No, I’m very, very poor!”

She walked over to him. At this moment, they were only a step away from each other.

She pointed at Yang Ye’s chest, “A treasure that has a world of its own. While it isn’t a Super Divine Treasure, it isn’t far away from becoming one. You have quite a few treasures. Don’t worry, I’ll take good care of them all!”

She was about to attack as she spoke.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye hurriedly said, “Senior, I have many more of those Ancient Tokens!”

Her eyes narrowed slightly, “Trying to play some sort of trick?”

Yang Ye quickly shook his head, “I just want to stay alive! Don’t you want it?”

She gazed at him for a long time and asked, “Where are they?”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and pointed at Yang Ye’s chest, “Let’s talk in there? It isn’t wise to talk out here!”

Meanwhile, she placed her right hand on Yang Ye’s chest. She sensed many living beings, but she didn’t sense one of them.

The woman cracked a smile, “I know you’re definitely playing some kind of trick, but it’s alright. I rarely rob people, so I’ll play with you. Let me warn you in advance, if there are no Ancient Tokens once you’re done with your tricks, then I’ll light a lantern with your soul!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she entered the Primordial Pagoda with Yang Ye.

Yang Ye brought her over to the bamboo house, and then he gazed at the young girl who was playing with her ball, “Little Qi, it’s time to prove if you’re really strong or just exaggerating.”

Qi Bitian continued kicking the ball as she spoke casually, “I lose if I attack twice!”
