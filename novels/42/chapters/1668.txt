Chapter 1669 - But That’s Not My Problem!

Translator: InVader

Yang Ye looked over and saw a man in a white robe. The man seemed to be just around the age of 25, and his hair was tied behind his head with a white scarf. Besides that, he was holding a silver spear.

Ming Mo!

The 10th on the Milky Way Rankings!

Ming Mo walked forward in Yang Ye’s direction and stopped not too far away from him. He looked at Yang Xing and asked, “Which one do you want dead?”

Yang Xing chuckled, “Cousin Brother, you really came!”

Ming Mo glanced indifferently at him and replied, “I’ll help you once for your mother’s sake.”

Yang Xing nodded slightly and gazed at An Nanjing, “Cousin Brother, just keep her busy for me. Of course, it’ll be even better if you can kill her. However, don’t underestimate her, she possesses six types of intents!”

Ming Mo turned to look at An Nanjing, “She’s the An Nanjing who suppressed a Half-Step True Realm expert from your Yang Clan while at the Rebirth Realm?”

Yang Xing nodded, “Yes.”

Ming Mo nodded slightly, “I just happen to want to see her strength!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot, and a ray of light simultaneously flashed through the air.

An Nanjing frowned slightly, and then Skysplit shot forward like thunder.

Clang!

An ear piercing clang resounded, and then both An Nanjing and Ming Mo moved backwards repeatedly. Ming Mo stopped himself after moving 300m back, and An Nanjing had moved 600m back instead!

However, Yang Xing and the others revealed solemn expressions because Ming Mo was a Zenith Realm expert!

An Nanjing was just at the Rebirth Realm!

A trace of seriousness appeared in Ming Mo’s eyes, “Not bad. I didn’t expect another extraordinarily monstrous genius to appear in our medium universe. Unfortunately, your cultivation is too low, or I would be helpless against you!”

As he spoke, he tapped his right foot down, and he transformed into a bolt of silver lightning. He swiftly stabbed his spear forward when he arrived less than 3m away from An Nanjing, and an ethereal silver dragon surged out from the tip of his spear.

An Nanjing’s eyes narrowed slightly. She moved her body slightly sideway, pressed her right foot lightly against the ground, and then pushed off from the ground. Her figure instantly shot forward like an arrow leaving the bowstring.

Skysplit slammed against the head of the ethereal dragon which had appeared before Ming Mo’s silver spear.

Bang!

Crack!

As soon as they collided, a loud explosion resounded, and then space cracked open. As for An Nanjing and Ming Mo, they were blasted backwards!

They were pushed over 3km before they could finally stop themselves!

Yang Ye glanced at Ming Mo, and then he gazed at An Nanjing who was about to attack, “Can you handle it?”

She nodded slightly, “I can!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Keep him busy! I’ll be done in a moment!”

“Alright!” As soon as she finished speaking, she transformed into a ray of golden light that shot forward like a bolt of lightning, and Ming Mo’s figure vanished on the spot as well.

It only took a moment for them to be locked in battle.

When he saw that An Nanjing and Ming Mo were equally matched, Yang Ye turned around and gazed at Yang Xing and Lu Yuanzhan. He didn’t waste his breath, and he just vanished on the spot. He was in front of Yang Xing when his figure appeared again, and then he drew his sword and swung it.

16 overlapped Heavenrends!

He stopped holding back this time, and he’d activated the Demon God’s energy within him and released both his sword intent and slaughter intent.

Bang!

The space around Yang Xing and Lu Yuanzhan instantly cracked open, and the powerful force from his attack pushed back all the spectators in the surroundings.

The spectators were shocked by this and hurriedly fled the battlefield.

Yang Xing’s expression changed at the sight of this. He hadn’t expected Yang Ye to be so strong. He didn’t dare act carelessly, and he quickly withdrew the wheel and raised it before himself.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and Yang Xing’s wheel exploded apart. As for Yang Xing’s figure, it was pushed over 3km away by the powerful force that Yang Ye’s attack carried.

Right when Yang Ye intended to follow up with another attack, the three Blood Puppets appeared in front of Yang Ye, and then three powerful auras slammed down at him.

Yang Ye suddenly stomped his right foot down, and then he transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot and appeared behind Yang Xing.

However, right when he appeared behind Yang Xing, a black shadow appeared by Yang Xing’s side, and then a dagger swept towards Yang Ye’s throat.

This time, Yang Ye expected this, so he suddenly changed the direction of his sword as soon as the black shadow appeared, and his sword which was stabbing towards Yang Xing was not stabbing towards the black shadow.

The figure before Yang Ye had clearly not expected Yang Ye to change his target like that and was caught off guard. He had no choice but to hastily swing his dagger at Yang Ye’s sword instead!

Clang!

An ear piercing sound of metal colliding resounded, and then the black shadow was pushed over 1km away.

Once he blasted the black shadow away, Yang Ye immediately sheathed his sword, turned around, and swung it at Yang Xing!

16 overlapped Heavenrends!

16 overlapped Heavenrends that were enhanced by slaughter intent and sword intent!

Yang Xing’s expression changed drastically when he sensed how terrifying Yang Ye’s attack was. He swiftly flipped his palms and countless rays of silver light surged out from his body like an impenetrable net. They instantly enveloped both him and Yang Ye.

However, as soon as they collided with Yang Ye’s sword energy, they seemed like snow falling into hot oil, and they were instantly obliterated.

Bang!

An explosion rumbled as Yang Xing’s figure was blasted over a kilometer away. At the same time that his figure was blasted away, an arm flew up into the air, and he spat out numerous mouthfuls of blood once he stopped himself.

However, Yang Ye had suddenly appeared behind him, and noticing this made Yang Xing’s expression changed drastically once more. He was about to counterattack, but it was too late. A sword had stabbed into his back, but it had stopped after stabbing just a few centimeters in.

At this moment, Yang Xing’s body stiffened, and he didn’t dare move another inch!

Meanwhile, the three Blood Puppets, which were charging at Yang Ye, had stopped, and the area instantly fell silent.

No one had expected Yang Ye’s strength to be that terrifying to the point of capturing Yang Xing in such a short while.

Lu Yuanzhan hadn’t expected it as well. As far as he was concerned, even if Yang Xing was no match for Yang Ye, the gap between them was definitely not huge. However, the facts of the situation told him that the gap between Yang Ye and Yang Xing wasn’t small, it was huge!

Especially Yang Ye’s Laws of Darkness. Even he was extremely afraid of it. Because even a Zenith Realm expert couldn’t take precautions against Yang Ye’s speed when he used the laws of Darkness. Besides the Laws of Darkness which was at the Zenith Rank, Yang Ye’s slaughter intent and sword intent were extremely terrifying too!

In short, Yang Ye’s strength had far surpassed his expectations.

Yang Ye exerted a little strength, and his sword instantly stabbed a few centimeters deeper into Yang Xing, “Tell him to release Lu Lige. I don’t want to repeat myself. Understand?”

Yang Xing’s expression changed repeatedly. In the end, he spoke in a low voice, “Release me first!”

Suddenly, a ray of light flashed.

Hiss!

Yang Xing’s other arm flew up into the air. Even though he didn’t let out a shrill cry, his expression was absolutely unsightly.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye spoke once more, “Didn’t you hear me? I told you to tell him to release Lu Lige!”

Yang Xing fell silent for a short while, and then he gazed at Lu Yuanzhan. Lu Yuanzhan’s expression changed for a moment, and then he suddenly went over to Lu Lige. He placed his right hand on Lu Lige’s head and said, “Release Brother Xing or I’ll take his head right now!”

Yang Xing frowned slightly while a trace of bewilderment appeared in his eyes.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He was about to speak when a voice suddenly resounded in his head, “Kill Yang Xing or I’ll break open Lu Lige’s head right now! Understand?”

Yang Ye frowned when he heard Lu Yuanzhan. What’s he trying to do?

It didn’t take long for him to come to an understanding.

Lu Yuanzhan wanted Yang Xing and him to fight to the death!

If he killed Yang Xing, the others on Yang Xing’s side would definitely not let the matter rest. Because the fight for succession hadn’t started yet. So, if he killed Yang Xing at a time like this, then they would definitely not stop until he was dead!

Suddenly, Lu Yuanzhan’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s head again, “I’ll count to three. If you don’t kill Yang Xing, I’ll kill Lu Lige right now! Three…”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then his sword suddenly pierced through Yang Xing’s stomach. In an instant, Yang Xing’s eyes opened wide, and then the color in them faded slowly.

Yang Ye withdrew his sword, waved his right hand, and placed Yang Xing’s Blood Puppets within the Primordial Pagoda before he gazed at Lu Yuanzhan.

Lu Yuanzhan suddenly started laughing when he saw this, “Haha! Brothers killing each other! Hahaha!”

Suddenly, a voice resounded from within the city, “Seventh Brother!”

As soon as the voice finished resounding, a man leaped out from the village and arrived not too far away from Yang Ye.

It was the Yang Clan’s fourth young master, Yang Ru!

At this moment, sorrow and anger filled Yang Ru’s eyes, “Seventh Brother, I was too late. I was too late!”

As he spoke, he gazed at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye! How ruthless of you! You actually disregarded the fact that we’re brothers! You…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye interrupted Yang Ru and said, “I thought I was shameless, but after I met you, I think I still have much to learn.”

Yang Ru’s expression returned to normal when he heard Yang Ye. A few breaths of time passed before he shook his head and smiled, “Young Master Ye, just wait for Yang Xing’s father and grandfather to come for you. I’ll be leaving first!”

“Fourth Brother, you’re leaving just like that?” Suddenly, a voice resounded, and then Yang Xing appeared not too far away from Yang Ye.

Of course, it was only his soul!

Yang Ru’s expression instantly became extremely unsightly when he saw Yang Xing.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly spoke, “I didn’t strike hard enough, so it didn’t destroy his soul. Oh my! Why is your face so unsightly? Did I spoil your plans? Alas, I’ve definitely spoiled your plans, or your expression wouldn’t be that unsightly, right?”

Yang Ye suddenly shrugged and continued, “But that’s not my problem!”
