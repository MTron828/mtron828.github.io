Chapter 1804 – Body Refinement Technique Of The Shaman Race!

The reason Ying Jing reacted like that was because a sword had stabbed into her chest.

It was naturally Yang Ye’s sword.

Boom!

An instant later, a wave of powerful energy swept out from her, and it immediately blasted Yang Ye over 3km away. As soon as he stopped himself, a few mouthfuls of blood sprayed from Yang Ye. But there was a smile on his face.

The Grand Teleportation Technique!

He’d utilized the Grand Teleportation Technique and Split Second just now.

He’d never used this trump card previously, and he hadn’t used it even when he fought the woman in a red dress and the Undertaker.

Yet now, he had to.

Ying Jing’s strength had far surpassed his imagination. Even the Divine Yin Flame couldn’t harm her. So, he had no choice but to use the Grand Teleportation Technique.

The Grand Teleportation Technique was naturally inferior to the Divine Yin Flame. Ying Jing didn’t dare to come into contact with the Divine Yin Flame, but the problem was that the Divine Yin Flame couldn’t touch her either. Regardless of whether it was the Divine Yin Flame or his wooden sword, they couldn’t get close to her!

But the Grand Teleportation Technique could let him get close to her. Sure enough, she was caught off guard, and his sword pierced through her chest. As soon as that happened, a strand of the Divine Yin Flame entered her body.

However, Ying Jing had actually suppressed it by force and stopped it from exploding within her!

Yang Ye’s expression grew solemn again when he witnessed this scene. He’d still underestimated her! However, she couldn’t do anything to the Divine Yin Flame as well. Because she’d merely suppressed it and hadn’t eliminated it!

Ying Jing gazed at Yang Ye, “That move wasn’t bad.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Thanks for the praise!”

Ying Jing looked towards the distance. The Ying Clan’s experts were down to less than ten experts after being jointly attacked by Yang Lianshuang and the others.

Ying Jing fell silent for a moment, and then she waved her right hand. Numerous blue circles of light suddenly appeared beneath the experts from the Ying Clan. It wasn’t just the experts here, the blue circles of light had even appeared below some youths in Heaven Desolation City.

A moment later, Ying Jing twisted both her palms.

Countless beams of blue light suddenly shot up into the sky. In an instant, those experts from the Ying Clan with blue circles of light beneath them had vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye gazed at Yang Lianshuang, “Can you catch up to them?”

Yang Lianshuang closed her eyes slightly, and then she opened them a moment later and shook her head.

Yang Ye’s face turned gloomy.

Meanwhile, Ying Jing suddenly said, “This clone of mine took a hundred years to create. I never expected it to be destroyed in your hands. Yang Ye, right? I’ll remember you. Trust me, it won’t take long before we meet for real.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Ying Jing’s figure became ethereal, and it only took a few breaths of time for her to vanish in midair.

Once she vanished, Yang Ye gazed at Lu Yuntian and the others. At this moment, their faces were horrifyingly pale.

Ying Jing had sent some of the Ying Clan’s members away, but she hadn’t sent them away.

Lu Yuntian took a deep breath and said, “Yang Ye, I….”

Yang Ye suddenly waved his right hand, “Kill them all!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of light that shot at them.

Yang Lianshuang and the others immediately followed after him.

At this moment, Yang Ye didn’t want to listen to Lu Yuntian and the others’ nonsense. Because it was a waste of time.

At this moment, how could they be a match for Yang Ye and the Wu Clan’s forces.

It only took 15 minutes for only the experts from the Yang Clan and Wu Clan to remain here.

Along with this victory, the five clans would be wiped out from the medium universe. Because even if their 6th stage True Realm experts showed themselves, it wouldn’t be able to change anything!

Moreover, if those experts were smart, they wouldn’t show themselves!

Yang Lianshuang walked over to Yang Ye. She sized him up and asked, “Are you alright?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Nothing major.”

He had the Primordial Pagoda and the Primordial Violet Energy within it, so most injuries weren’t a big deal to him. Unless someone injured him heavily to the point of being crippled or if he was killed in an instant, it was very difficult for him to be killed.

Yang Lianshuang nodded slightly and said, “I intend to press our advantage and eliminate the other clans. It’s the best opportunity to do so because their main forces have been annihilated.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Do you need me to come?”

Yang Lianshuang replied, “It isn’t necessary. Recuperate for now and leave the rest to us.”

Yang Ye thought for a while and nodded, “Alright. But be careful. They still have 6th stage True Realm experts.”

“Of course!” Yang Lianshuang nodded, and then she gazed at Wu Ye, “Senior Wu, are you coming?”

Wu Ye smiled, “Of course!” It was time to reap the benefits, so the Wu Clan was definitely going with her.

Yang Lianshuang hesitated for a moment and said, “Senior Wu Ye, I’d like to make a deal with the Wu Clan.”

Wu Ye was quite curious, “What?”

She explained, “My Yang Clan only wants the cultivation techniques, combat techniques, offensive treasures, and defensive treasures of the five clans. As for their territory, we don’t want any of it. It’ll all go to the Wu Clan. What do you think about this deal?”

Everyone here was stunned upon hearing her.

All the worlds!

After all, how many worlds was that? How much human resources would those worlds include? But Yang Lianshuang didn’t want a single one of those worlds! Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye glanced at her and nodded inwardly. She’s really smart.

Yang Ye naturally understood her true intentions.

The Yang Clan had actually been severely weakened through the recent events. Presently, the Yang Clan was only standing because Yang Lianshuang and him were supporting it. This time, the reason they’d been able to annihilate the Ying Clan’s coalition was mainly thanks to Nether Maiden’s group.

But Nether Maiden and the others didn’t belong to the Yang Clan, and they wouldn’t stay forever!

Besides them, the only other experts the Yang Clan had were Yang Lianshuang and Yang Ye. Simply speaking, the Yang Clan didn’t have the ability to manage those worlds even if it took them. If the Yang Clan tried to do it by force, it would only delay the Yang Clan’s development.

The Yang Clan needed to rest and recuperate. But if it took control of those worlds, it would represent that the Yang Clan would be out in the open again. After all, the experts of the Ying Clan hadn’t been completely annihilated. So, the Yang Clan would be forced into a passive position!

Thus, Yang Lianshuang had decisively chosen to abandon those worlds and continue developing the Yang Clan in secret.

Wu Ye spoke solemnly, “Young Miss Shuang, are you kidding?”

She grinned, “Do you think I would joke about something like this?”

Wu Ye gazed at her for a long time and said, “Alright, my Wu Clan will accept this deal.”

He was no fool, and he understood Yang Lianshuang’s intentions. The worlds may be a burden to the Yang Clan because it didn’t have enough forces to manage those worlds, but they weren’t a burden to the Wu Clan.

Because the Wu Clan hadn’t engaged in any internal strife, and it hadn’t lost many experts. So, the Wu Clan had the ability to manage those worlds. He could imagine that once the Wu Clan took control of those worlds and had them for around a hundred years, the Wu Clan would grow to an unimaginable level!

Even though there were risks of being targeted, it was a chance that he didn’t want to refuse!

Yang Lianshuang grinned. She was about to speak when Wu Ye suddenly said, “But I have a request. I hope to form an alliance between our clans. From now on, our clans will fight together. Alright?”

Yang Lianshuang thought for a moment and said, “Of course!”

Wu Ye grinned, “Young Miss Shuang, I hope we work well together!”

Yang Lianshuang smiled, “Me too! Now, let’s deal with the other clans!”

Wu Ye replied, “We’ll do as you say!”

She nodded slightly and gazed at Yang Ye. Yang Ye understood what she meant, and he gazed at Nether Maiden and the others, “Are all of you free?”

If Yang Lianshuang didn’t have Nether Maiden and the others’ help, even though it would still be possible to crush the other clans, it would be much more troublesome. But if Yang Lianshuang had their help, it would be much easier.

The pig-riding young woman suddenly said, “You have to go to Heaven Pillar Mountain with us once we’re done here.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course.”

The pig-riding young woman shrugged and gazed at Yang Lianshuang, “Let’s go!”

Yang Lianshuang nodded, “Thank you.”

She vanished into the sky once she finished speaking.

The pig-riding young woman and the others immediately followed after her.

Only Yang Ye remained here.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he looked for a place to hide himself. After that, he entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Healing!

Actually, his injuries were quite serious. Because he’d exhausted too much strength just now, and it made his entire body feel extremely exhausted. Especially after he used the Grand Teleportation Technique in battle. It made him feel exhausted to the extreme.

It was also why he hadn’t gone with them.

Healing was naturally a familiar thing to Yang Ye. With the recuperative properties of the Primordial Violet Energy, he recovered at a terrifying rate. In less than two hours, he’d recovered completely.

Right when he was about to leave the Primordial Pagoda, Hou Qing suddenly appeared before him.

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, “What?”

Hou Qing looked Yang Ye in the eyes for a long time and said, “I’ll teach you shaman techniques and my shaman race’s body refinement technique. But you have to let me go once we’re done!”

Shaman techniques!

The body refinement technique!

Yang Ye blinked, “That’s… not a problem!”

Hou Qing looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Swear! Swear on the Sovereign of Man!

Yang Ye was stunned and spoke seriously, “I swear that if I go back on my word, then the Sovereign of Man will die. He’ll….”
