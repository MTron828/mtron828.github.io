Chapter 2461 – You’re so Shameless!

The old man was clearly aware of Yang Ye’s identity. The Di Clan wasn’t afraid of Yang Ye, but it didn’t want to offend this fellow at a time like this. Because even the Di Clan didn’t dare to ignore Yang Ye’s strength.

The white haired old man’s face fell when he heard Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, what are you trying to say? You…”

Yang Ye waved his hand, “I don’t want to waste my breath on you. Tell the experts of the Creation Sect and Immortality Sect to show themselves.”

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “They are guests of my Di Clan now. Yang Ye, you…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

A sword howl resounded.

Bang!

The old man was immediately struck by it!

His body exploded apart, and his soul fled his body at the critical moment and appeared over 1km away.

The old man, who was just a soul now, glared at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, how dare you…”

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy pierced through the old man’s forehead.

The old man’s soul exploded apart!

He was dead!

Yang Ye sheathed his sword and Erya appeared by his side. She glared at him, and he smiled embarrassedly, “Sorry, I used a little too much strength!”

Erya absorbed the spirit and soul, but that attack of his had obliterated the old man completely, so she had nothing to absorb.

Erya felt quite helpless, “Big Brother Yang, you know I’ve been constantly hungry lately. D-Do you think it’s easy for me to ever have a filling meal? I…”

She actually started to tear up!

“Stop!” Yang Ye hurriedly admitted his mistakes, “It was my fault. I guarantee I’ll use lesser strength next time, alright?”

She grunted and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye sighed softly, “What a little lord!”

He started walking into the distance, and it didn’t take long for him to see a huge and grand city. It was extremely tall and simply stretched boundlessly toward both sides. At the top of the city, Yang Ye saw two gilded words—‘帝城’.

Emperor City!

Yang Ye walked over to the city’s entrance. It was shut tight.

Yang Ye stomped his right foot down, causing the entire city to quake!

Meanwhile, a young man appeared before him. The young man wore a gorgeous embroidered robe, had hair that hung down to his shoulders, and held a pitch black spear.

The young man sized up Yang Ye, “It may be our first meeting, but I’ve heard of you. Right, allow me to introduce myself. I’m Di Qing, the Di Clan’s successor.”

Yang Ye glanced at the young man, “A’Leng’s fiance?”

Di Qing shook his head, “That’s over now. A part of it was thanks to you.”

Yang Ye said, “Alright, let’s not waste each other’s time. I’m sure you know why I’m here. So, shall we fight, or will you hand them over?”

Di Qing smiled, “They have sided with my Di Clan, so they are part of my clan now. Thus, we naturally have to fight!”

Yang Ye nodded, “That makes things easier!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye appeared before Di Qing.

Right at the instant Yang Ye appeared before Di Qing, the latter’s spear shot forward rapidly like surging thunder!

Meanwhile, Executor left its sheath!

Hiss!

The spear was instantly sliced into two!

Di Qing’s pupils constricted as he floated over 300m back. He was very fast, so he’d been able to avoid Yang Ye’s lethal strike. However, as soon as he descended to the ground, Yang Ye appeared before him again.

Yang Ye’s sword descended!

Di Qing’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he twisted his right hand and slammed a punch forward!

It was much faster than Yang Ye’s sword!

Bang!

An explosion resounded and Yang Ye was blasted around 300m away!

Yang Ye looked down at his stomach and noticed that it had sunken in. Moreover, his internal organs ached a little.

Yang Ye looked up at Di Qing, “So you don’t use the spear, you use the fist!”

Di Qing grinned, “Can’t I?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course you can!”

As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, he suddenly vanished on the spot, and Di Qing took a step back in response. A moment later, his figure soared up into the air, and then he twisted it sideways before slamming a punch forward.

It wasn’t just fast, it was an extremely powerful punch too!

However, it was slamming down upon Yang Ye’s sword, and Yang Ye was holding Executor!

His fist descended!

Hiss!

A fist flew up into the air!

However, Yang Ye was pushed over 30m back as well!

Di Qing glanced at Yang Ye’s sword and ridiculed, “A Super Divine Treasure! It truly does cut through everything! But I’m really curious, if you don’t have that sword, then wouldn’t you be nothing?”

Obviously, he wasn’t convinced of his defeat. Of course he wasn’t. Yang Ye wouldn’t have been able to slice off his hand without Executor!

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “Trying to provoke me to give up my sword? To be honest, I don’t have to prove anything to you. If you think that I’m bullying you by using a Super Divine Treasure, then you can use one too. Go on!”

Di Qing’s face was quite unsightly! A Super Divine Treasure? The Di Clan didn’t even have one! So, how could he?

Di Qing smiled coldly, “Yang Ye, you’ve truly allowed me to gain a new understanding of the word shameless.”

Yang Ye replied, “You don’t have a Super Divine Treasure, so I can’t use one? Are you being shameless or am I? Since you don’t have one, allow me to give you a different way of fighting fairly. I won’t use my Super Divine Treasure, but you must suppress your cultivation to the True Dao Realm. Because I’m only at the True Dao Realm right now. Let’s fight one on one without any weapons and in the same realm of cultivation. That’s fair, isn’t it?”

The True Dao Realm!

Di Qing’s face grew even more unsightly!

He was a Four World Realm expert right now while Yang Ye was really only at the True Dao Realm! However, even an idiot knew that Yang Ye couldn’t be judged based on his cultivation! If he suppressed his cultivation to the True Dao Realm, it was obvious that he would have no chance at victory!

Di Qing stared at Yang Ye, “You’re so shameless!”

Yang Ye shook his head and put Executor away. After that, he appeared before Di Qing, and the latter’s eyes narrowed as he slammed a punch forward!

Meanwhile, Sword Precursor slashed down in Yang Ye’s grasp!

Five swings with the Sword Domain!

As soon as this attack descended, Di Qing’s expression changed.

Bang!

Di Qing was blasted away, and at the instant that happened, a flying sword suddenly shot out from the Sword Gourd.

It instantly arrived before Di Qing!

Di Qing’s expression changed drastically. While his body had lost balance, he’d still forcefully swung a punch at this critical moment. But a punch executed in a hurry like this was much weaker than it had previously been!

Hiss!

The flying sword pierced through his fist, and Di Qing himself was blasted away and slammed against the city walls.

Di Qing wasn’t even able to recover from his shock when two flying swords stabbed into his shoulders and nailed him on the wall!

A crushing defeat!

Yang Ye walked over to Di Qing and looked up at him. Di Qing stared at Yang Ye without any fear in his eyes.

Yang Ye smiled, “You’re only so fearless because you have people to protect you. It’s the Five World Realm experts of the Di Clan, right?”

Di Qing laughed coldly, “Yang Ye, do you think that you can even kill Five World Realm experts? Or perhaps you think the desolate race will take your side? Yes, you are friends with Huang Ying, but who do you think he will choose when it’s between you and my Di Clan? Even if Huang Ying chooses you, the elders of the desolate race won’t agree to it. You…”

Yang Ye suddenly drew his sword and swung it.

As soon as this attack descended, Di Qing’s voice stopped abruptly. He wasn’t dead. Because an old man had appeared before him, and Yang Ye’s attack had been forcefully stopped by a blue barrier of light!

A Five World Realm expert!

A true Five World Realm expert!

However, the old man was at the Four World Realm right now. It was because the Emperor World wasn’t a mid-level world. If Eternal Kingdom was excluded, then the Desolate World was the only mid-level world throughout this universe, and so it could barely support the presence of Five World Realm experts! But the Emperor World wasn’t a mid-level world!

The old man waved his right hand. The barrier of light exploded apart and Yang Ye appeared around 100m away.

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Yang Ye, there isn’t much enmity between my Di Clan and you, yet you killed one of our Four World Realm experts on arrival. Aren’t you going a little too far?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I don’t want to waste my breath. All I want to know is whether your Di Clan is going to hand over those fellows from the Creation Sect and Immortality Sect!”

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Yang Ye, do you think my Di Clan fears you? You…”

The old man’s voice stopped abruptly because Yang Ye was in front of him.

A sword descended!

It was Executor!

Five swings with the Sword Domain!

As soon as the fifth swing descended, the space here cracked open. Such a world wasn’t able to endure this attack of Yang Ye’s!

While the old man was at the Five World Realm, he’d suppressed his cultivation to the Four World Realm. So, he didn’t dare to go head-on against Yang Ye’s attack. After all, Yang Ye was using the number one sword of Eternal Kingdom!

The old man raised his hands slightly. In an instant, a wave of powerful aura swept out from within him, and at the instant his palms descended, the space here started to ripple.

Boom!

A wave of powerful energy surged out like an erupting volcano!

Bang!

The powerful energy blasted Yang Ye backward repeatedly!

He was pushed over 300m back!

The old man didn’t attack again and said, “Yang Ye, the Creation Sect and Immortality Sect are subordinate sects of my Di Clan now. If you attack them, you’re attacking my Di Clan! Let me just say this right here and now. My Di Clan is protecting them no matter what!”Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Yang Ye suddenly spoke ferociously, “If that’s the case, then I’ll annihilate your Di Clan today!”

Boom!

As soon as he said that, a wave of powerful intent surged up into the air from within Yang Ye!

The madness intent!

Meanwhile, Executor soundlessly entered the Sword Gourd, and it was replaced by the Sword Precursor and Sword Supreme.

Dual swords!
