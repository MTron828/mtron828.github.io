It didn’t take long for Li Qingyi and the others to notice that pairs of blood red eyes had suddenly appeared all around them.

Besides those blood red eyes, Li Qingyi and the others couldn’t see anything else throughout the veil of night.

Their expressions changed slightly, and Fan Meng was even terrified to the point of hurriedly pulling her older sister with her and hiding behind Yang Ye.

It didn’t take long for a woman who rode a flaming lion to appear within their fields of vision!

“The Beastmaster Sect!” The corners of Li Qingyi’s eyes twitched slightly when she saw the woman, and her eyes flickered with shock and ghastly killing intent.

“The Beastmaster Sect is a Silver Rank sect, and it’s a sword enemy of Stellar Sky City. Perhaps their own strength might not be very formidable, but they can sign all sorts of agreements with various powerful demon beasts. Not only are they able to bring forth powerful strength with the assistance of those demon beasts, they are even able to rely on the demon beasts to execute some special joint attacks. You must not underestimate her!” Fan Meng walked over to Yang Ye and spoke softly.

The woman in a violet dress robe the flaming lion to a distance of 100m before Yang Ye and the others, and then she spoke slowly, “Young Miss Li led numerous experts of Stellar Sky City to search for Monkey Wine, yet you sneaked out from the group and traveled 5,000km to Skywind City on your own. That plan of yours almost deceived my sect!”

“I never expected that there would actually be a spy in the forces of my city. Moreover, it seems like that spy’s status isn’t low at all!” said Li Qingyi.

The woman pointed at the surroundings and said, “Because I was aware of Young Miss Li’s arrival, I temporarily subdued all the demon beasts in an area of 50km. Don’t worry, I won’t kill you. A living successor of Stellar Sky City is more valuable than a dead one. So, will you follow me on your own accord, or should I take you with me by force?”

As she spoke, she waved her hand, and then 2 white apes and 5 huge wolves appeared by her side.

All of them were at the Exalt Realm!

Fan Li and Fan Meng’s countenances instantly turned ghastly pale while Lin Ning who laid on the ground shouted, “I surrender. Senior from the Beastmaster Sect, please spare me....”

Lin Ning’s voice stopped abruptly because an energy palm suddenly descended onto his head, causing it to explode apart.

It was Li Qingyi who launched the attack!

Li Qingyi spoke coldly, “Dammit!”

Fan Meng and Fan Li glanced at Li Qingyi while a trace of vigilance appeared in their eyes.

“This is between the Beastmaster Sect and Stellar Sky City. I don’t want to interfere in it!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye walked off while holding Fan Meng’s hand. Meanwhile, Fan Meng held tightly onto Fan Li’s hand while cautiously glancing at Yang Ye as she was very afraid that he would abandon her older sister.

The woman suddenly said, “You’re leaving just like that?”

Yang Ye stopped and turned around to look at her, “What? You want to treat me to some roast meat?” Yang Ye glanced at the flaming lion below the woman while he spoke.

Roar!

The lion roared furiously when it heard Yang Ye, and its roar was filled with boundless rage. Moreover, strands of flames sprayed out incessantly from it and caused the air around it to crackle.

The woman gazed at Yang Ye for a short while before she said, “You seem to be very confident in your strength? Or perhaps you’re very confident in your backing?”

Yang Ye replied, “Based on what you said, your objective is only Young Miss Li. Since it’s like that, why don’t you just let us go?”

She asked, “What if I don’t?”

“Why don’t you give it a try?”

“Then I will!”

As soon as she finished speaking, an explosion resounded as a dark blue python suddenly charged out from the basin by their side. The python was like the size of a hill, its eyes were like 2 watermelons, and it opened up its huge mouth as it shot towards Yang Ye’s group.

Fan Li was horrified, and Fan Meng’s face had turned ghastly pale when they saw the python. She held tightly onto Fan Li’s arm while her eyes were closed tightly.

A cold glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, and he gestured, “Sword! Come to me!”

As soon as he spoke, a sword howl resounded from the sword that hunt on Fan Meng’s waist, and it appeared in Yang Ye’s grasp. Yang Ye stomped the ground with his right foot and transformed into a ray of light that shot up into the air and through the python’s mouth. After that, numerous rays of sword energy criss crossed through the air.

A moment later, Yang Ye descended to the ground, and he stabbed the sword into the ground in front of him.

Pu!

They watched with shock as the dark blue python fell towards the basin below. However, it wasn’t whole anymore when it fell, it was in pieces!

All of them were flabbergasted, including the woman in a violet dress. Her eyes had shock and seriousness in them, and there was a trace of strong fear as well! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Li Qingyi took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye. There was fear in her eyes as well, but there was even more happiness there.

Fan Meng’s eyes glowed as she gazed at him, and they were filled with adoration. On the other hand, Fan Li instinctively took 2 steps back, and besides fear, there was even a trace of reverence in her eyes!

Besides them, even the demon beasts in the surroundings were shocked by Yang Ye’s ability. They stopped roaring and started looking at Yang Ye with vigilance instead. Even the flaming lion beneath the women had strong vigilance in its eyes!

Because that python was at the Exalt Realm!

How could they not be shocked when he instantly annihilated an Exalt Realm demon beast?!

Yang Ye gazed at the woman and asked, “Do you still want to give it a try?”

The woman spoke solemnly, “You’re from the Ancient Sword School?”

“Yes!” Yang Ye didn’t hesitate at all. It wasn’t that he wanted to pretend to be a member of the Ancient Sword School, he just had no choice but to say so. Because while he’d restored his cultivation to the King Realm, his injuries hadn’t been healed at all. His meridians were healing very slowly when being nurtured by his violet profound energy. So, his meridians were still in pieces right now.

Forcefully utilizing sword energy earlier had caused the meridians within his body to warp, and the sharp pain from it was utterly indescribable. If his meridians hadn’t been tempered by Primordial Violet Energy and the Dragon Ancestor’s blood in the past, just utilizing sword energy earlier would have caused his meridians to be turned into powder.

So, even if he seemed to be completely carefree right now, and even seemed like he treated the woman and the demon beasts as ants, he was actually on the verge of howling from the sharp pain from his warped meridians.

But he had no other choice but to continue acting!

The woman in a violet dress wasn’t the only one who felt shocked upon hearing Yang Ye, even Li Qingyi, Fan Li, and Fan Meng were the same. After all, the Ancient Sword School was like a legendary existence in Pine Prefecture. Because the Ancient Sword School was a Platinum Rank sect! Moreover, Platinum Rank sects were the strongest in Pine Prefecture!

The woman in a violet dress asked, “The Ancient Sword School has 9 peaks that are situated throughout Pine Prefecture. May I ask which peak you’re from?”

“The strongest peak!”

“Heavenly Sword Peak!” Fan Meng gasped. Meanwhile, the eyes of Fan Li, Li Qingyi, and the woman opened wide with shock!

“Heavenly Sword Peak has....” She intended to continue with more questions, but Yang Ye suddenly said, “What’s with all the crap? If you want to fight, then do it quickly. To be honest, my sword thirsts for blood!”

As he spoke, he waved his right hand and the sword before him trembled violently before a ray of light shot into the sky. It tore through the sky like a bolt of lightning, and it was dazzling and resplendent!

The woman’s eyelids twitched. She was very afraid that Yang Ye would attack, so she quickly said, “Since you’re from the Ancient Sword School, then Zi Xin would naturally not dare to act rashly. You can leave as you please.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he turned around and walked away. The woman called Zi Xin frowned when she saw him act like that, and then a wisp of surprise flashed through her eyes.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly stopped moving. He turned around to gaze at her, “Wouldn’t I be bringing shame to my Ancient Sword School if I leave just like that? Nevermind. I haven’t killed in a long time, so I’ll feed all of you to my sword!”

Yang Ye was about to act while he spoke, and Zi Xin was horrified by this. She quickly said, “My Beastmaster Sect has no intention to be disrespectful to the Ancient Sword School. Everything that occurred earlier was a misunderstanding. How could I dare to make things difficult for you if I knew that you were from the Ancient Sword School?”

“You expect me to just let bygones be bygones?” Yang Ye spoke ferociously, and the killing intent in his eyes was seemingly material. It seemed like he would carry out slaughter at any moment.

Zi Xin pondered deeply for an instant, and then she flicked with her wrist. A spatial ring appeared in front of Yang Ye as she said, “There are 500 extreme-grade energy stones and the inner cores of 100 Exalt Realm demon beasts in there. Please do accept these small gifts as my apology to you!”

Yang Ye glanced at her before he gestured with his right hand, and the spatial ring flew into his grasp. He said, “If I didn’t have important matters to attend to, then I might have even roasted and enjoyed that lion below you....”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took Fan Meng with him as he turned around and left. Fan Meng, on the other hand, held tightly onto Fan Li.

Li Qingyi hurriedly followed them. Zi Xin was about to say something when she witnessed this scene. However, Li Qingyi suddenly turned around and said, “I’m his woman. Head back to your sect and tell your Sect Master that if he wants to act against my Stellar Sky City, then he has to first think about the consequences....” As soon as she finished speaking, she glanced at Zi Xin with ridicule before swiftly following behind Yang Ye’s group.

Zi Xin’s eyes could almost spray flames from the rage she felt, and her chest was rising and falling rapidly. She was clearly furious.

As she watched Yang Ye’s group vanish beneath the veil of night, Zi Xin took a deep breath and calmed the rage in her heart. Right when she was about to turn around and leave, a thought suddenly appeared in her mind.

She fell silent on the spot for some time, and her brows gradually creased together....

A long time passed before she suddenly opened her eyes, “Dammit! I fell for his trick! He isn’t a disciple of the Ancient Sword School!”

Roar!

Countless furious beast howls resounded once more throughout the tranquil mountain range, and then the entire area started to quake!
