Chapter 2539 – Domain!

After instantly killing the black robed old man, two flying swords shot out from the Sword Gourd.

They shot into the city, and then black heads flew up into the air incessantly.

A few dozen fountains of blood surged up into the air!

It didn’t take long for Qing Yue and the others to return to Yang Ye’s side.

Yang Ye glanced at the ancient city.

Meanwhile, a middle aged man walked over, and he bowed slightly to Yang Ye, “T-Thank you!”

He was the governor of the city, and it was a subordinate power of the Ancient Sword Sect.

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “All of you can go to the Ancient Sword Sect or stay here. Just notify us if they attack.”

Yang Ye vanished on the spot with the others.

He didn’t return to the Ancient Sword Sect!

Yang Ye led Qing Yue and the others to a boundless mountain range that was impossible to see the end of.

There was nothing unusual about it when looked at from high above!

Yang Ye glanced at Qing Yue and the others, “Wait for instructions from the sect!”

Qing Yue hesitated for a moment and said, “Let us follow you!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m fine. Remember that you are all elite disciples of the sect, and you are the future pillars of support in the sect. You need the ability to do things on your own.”

Qing Yue and the others bowed slightly to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye didn’t say anything else and just entered the mountain range.

A short while later, Qing Yue and the others vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye went deep into the mountain range below, and it didn’t take long for him to stop.

He gazed at the mountains in the distance, and then he closed his eyes slowly while a seal appeared before him.

The Universe Seal!

The Universe Seal shot up into the clouds, and then a ray of mysterious energy rained down.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Strange sounds resounded through the area, and then a pitch black city appeared before Yang Ye. At the same time, numerous divine senses instantly enveloped Yang Ye.

“Sect Master Ye, you’ve arrived!” Meanwhile, a voice came from within the city, and then a middle aged man in a dark violet robe walked out of the city.

A Lord Realm expert!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “You’ve really kept your sect well hidden.”

The middle aged man smiled, ‘It can’t be helped. We have to keep a low profile until we’ve gained success, right?”

Yang Ye glanced at the city, “I think we can stop wasting time.”

As soon as he finished speaking, two flying swords shot forward.

With his Lord Realm sword intent to enhance them, their speed and strength had grown even more terrifying!

The middle aged man was prepared for this. So, a pitch black chain suddenly shot out from him before the swords even arrived before him. The chains formed a huge black shield of chains!

Clang! Clang!

Two sharp clangs resounded and Yang Ye’s swords flew back into the Sword Gourd!

The middle aged man chuckled from behind the shield, “Sect Master Ye, it is the world that wished for the Ancient Sword Sect to step down from history, just like the Di Clan did all those years ago. It’s not something a single person can change. Moreover, according to my knowledge, you’re not even from the Ancient Sword Sect, so you can just leave, and my Soul Sect will not target you.”

“You won’t?” Yang Ye grinned, “If I didn’t have some skill, I would have probably died when you schemed against me with those elders of the Ancient Sword Sect, right?”

Yang Ye suddenly took a step forward and swung his sword!

It struck against the chain shield, and it was slashed into bits!

Executor!

Executor could destroy Divine Treasures!

Once he destroyed the pitch black chains, the middle aged man retreated to the city walls. Suddenly, a few powerful auras rippled out.

Yang Ye strode forward and swung his sword once more!

Hiss!

It seemed like it would slice the world apart.

The auras before Yang Ye were instantly sliced apart, but it only took a moment for a few black figures to leap out of the city.

Bang! Bam! Bang!

A few muffled explosions resounded, and then Yang Ye was blasted over 1km away.

As soon as he stopped himself, a spear pierced through space and instantly arrived before him. Yang Ye swung Executor at it!

Bang!

The spear shook violently and cracked open while Yang Ye was blasted away again. As soon as he descended to the ground, a huge palm descended from the sky.

Boom!

The area Yang Ye stood at exploded apart and was obliterated!

However, that wasn’t the end of it. An ethereal figure flashed by, and then a wave of energy swept out from the city. The wave of energy instantly slammed against the obliterated expanse of space.

Boom!

The expanse of space shook, and then a curled up figure was blasted out of it.

It was Yang Ye!

Yang Ye stopped himself 3km away, and the expanse of space before him had been repaired by the Laws of the world.

On the walls of the ancient city, the middle aged man had four black robed figures on his sides.

All of them were at the Lord Realm!

Five Lord Realm experts!

The middle aged man smiled, “Sect Master Ye, you’re too confident.”

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and smiled, “Indeed.”

The middle aged man walked over to Yang Ye, “Sect Master Ye, if I’m being honest, then if it’s a one-on-one battle, then you’re definitely the strongest beneath the Lord Realm in Eternal Kingdom. Not to mention beneath the Lord Realm, even Lord Realm experts are no match for you. But I’m sorry to say that we won’t fight you in single combat. We planned to take your life in the Ancient Sword Sect once the Sect Master emerged from closed door cultivation, but it seems like we don’t have to wait until then.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the others by his side suddenly emanated powerful auras that enveloped Yang Ye.

Yang Ye had an absolute advantage if it was a one-on-one battle against a Lord Realm expert. After all, his strength wasn’t any weaker than the Lord Realm. Moreover, his sword intent was at the Lord Realm now, and he had numerous treasures!

But he was facing five Lord Realm experts now!

Yang Ye wasn’t strong enough to fight five on his own!

But Yang Ye wasn’t alone!

Yang Ye glanced at them, and then a dragon roar resounded while a colossus appeared in the sky.

The Primal True Dragon!

The dragon’s huge body covered the entire city. Moreover, a wave of Dragon Pressure rippled down incessantly from the sky and slammed down against the city.

A peak Five World Realm demon!

The middle aged man’s face instantly turned gloomy when he saw the Primal True Dragon. But that wasn’t even the end of it. Another powerful demon’s aura appeared, and then a demon with an axe appeared behind Yang Ye. It was just the size of a human in the beginning, but it didn’t take long for the demon to grow larger and larger. In just a short while, it was over 300m tall!

It was a towering demon!

It was Oxxy, of course!

Moreover, there was another demon beside Oxxy, it was the Primal Vicious Tiger!

Yang Ye didn’t summon the other demons because just the three of them were enough!

They were completely enough!

Yang Ye glanced at the dragon, “Blast that city apart for me!”

A dragon roar resounded, and the dragon slammed itself at the city.

The middle aged man’s expression changed drastically, “Stop it!”

Two of the black robed figures by his side shot up into the air and charged at the dragon.

Suddenly, Yang Ye took a step forward, and then a mysterious wave of energy appeared in the surroundings!

The Sword Domain!

As soon as the Sword Domain appeared, the middle aged man was shocked, and then two flying swords soundlessly appeared before him.

They’d appeared out of thin air!

At this critical moment, the middle aged man’s body vanished, and only his soul remained. Once he only had his soul, a powerful wave of Soul Energy rippled out from him.

Bang! Bang!

The flying swords were blasted away, and even the space within the Sword Domain surged!

Yang Ye frowned slightly as he wondered what the heck that energy was!

Yang Ye didn’t give it too much thought and just took a step forward before swinging his sword at the middle aged man. The middle aged man made a grasping motion with his right hand. IN an instant, a black hand condensed into form by black energy grabbed Yang Ye’s Executor!

But in just an instant, the black hand was sliced into bits.

A moment later, Yang Ye released Executor, and it transformed into a ray of light that flashed through the Sword Domain.

Bang!

A wave of powerful sword energy erupted within the Sword Domain, and then a soul was instantly blasted into the city.

Yang Ye was about to attack again, but the other two black robed figures didn’t stand by idly. Two waves of black energy erupted within the Sword Domain. Their target wasn’t Yang Ye but the Sword Domain!

They wanted to destroy his Sword Domain!

However, they had clearly overestimated themselves, and as soon as the waves of energy erupted, two flying swords had sliced them into bits!Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye dispersed the Sword Domain, and Oxxy suddenly charged forward.

The Primordial Axe of Creation descended!

Boom!

One of the Lord Realm experts was blasted away!

Meanwhile, the other two black robed Lord Realm experts were keeping the dragon busy, but the dragon was actually able to hold its own against both of them by relying on its powerful physical body!

Yang Ye glanced at the dragon, and then he gazed at Oxxy. Oxxy nodded slightly, and then he hurled the axe at the city.

Hiss!

Everywhere the axe passed, space was blasted into bits!

Right when it was about to enter the city, a strand of black energy shot out from the city and blasted the axe away.

Oxxy hurriedly caught the axe, but as soon as he touched it, he was immediately blasted 3km away!

At this moment, Oxxy’s entire body had cracked open. Especially Oxxy’s right hand, blood was streaming out of it, and its bones were visible!

Meanwhile, a woman in a black dress appeared on the city walls.

The woman glanced coldly at Yang Ye, and then she raised both her hands. In an instant, a wave of mysterious energy enveloped him!

In an instant, Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and there was a trace of disbelief in them!

A Domain!

It was a Domain!
