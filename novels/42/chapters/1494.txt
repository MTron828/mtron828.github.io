Chapter 1495 - A Clear Conscience!

Translator: InVader

Yang Ye instantly revealed a bitter expression when he heard her.

He’d thought that once those two Rebirth Realm experts from the large world were killed, there would be no other human or demon beast here that could pose a threat to them. After all, Blood Maiden was known throughout this place, and the humans and demon beasts here would definitely not dare to come here.

However, he hadn’t expected that another old man would suddenly arrive here.

Obviously, since the old man dared to come here, he was definitely at the Rebirth Realm at least. Moreover, since he’d come by himself, his strength was definitely superior to those two from before.

Stop a Rebirth Realm expert? Yang Ye laughed bitterly. Can I even do that?

He hadn’t tried, but he was very well aware that his chances of success were absolutely slim!

The old man didn’t even spare a glance at Yang Ye. His gaze was constantly locked onto Blood Maiden, “Blood Maiden, we’ve been waiting a long time for you to charge into the Rebirth Realm. We even didn’t hesitate to sacrifice two people so that you could absorb their blood, and then advance into the Rebirth Realm. You didn’t disappoint us. As expected, you couldn’t resist the temptation before you and absorbed their blood.”

It was a trap! At this point, Yang Ye realized that those two fellows had actually been sent here to die. The large world had sacrificed them to make Blood Maiden absorb their blood, and then become unable to suppress her cultivation further!

However, there was one thing he didn’t really understand!

Yang Ye looked up at the old man, “There’s something I don’t understand. Why did you choose to sacrifice two Rebirth Realm experts? You could have just joint forces against her. Why sacrifice two Rebirth Realm experts?”

“The three of us?” The old man shook his head, “You don’t know how strong she is. You know… No less than seven Rebirth Realm experts joined forces against her all those years ago, but do you know what the outcome was? She killed five of them on her own, and the remaining two were heavily injured. They died not too long after the battle. So, not to mention the three of us, even five Rebirth Realm experts may not be able to kill her!”

Yang Ye gasped when he heard this.

Seven Rebirth Realm experts!

She actually killed seven Rebirth Realm experts on her own!

How heaven defying was that?

Yang Ye wasn’t the only one who was shocked, Lian Banzhuang was extremely shocked as well. She knew Blood Maiden was very strong, and it was obvious from how Blood Maiden had killed that demon beast all those years ago. But she hadn’t expected Blood Maiden’s strength to be that terrifying! She’s killed seven Rebirth Realm experts on her own!

The Rebirth Realm! Not the Dualism Realm!

Killing seven Rebirth Realm experts on her own was absolutely terrifying!

Meanwhile, the old man continued, “So, even if we knew where she was, and we knew where the other women from the Nether Pavilion are, we still didn’t send any Dualism and Rebirth Realm experts down here. Because even 10 Rebirth Realm experts would probably be insufficient to kill them. After all, besides the 1st and 2nd Hall Masters, those eyes of their 3rd Hall Master are extremely terrifying as well!”

The 3rd Hall Master!

He was referring to Blind Maiden, of course!

Actually, Yang Ye was very curious about Blind Maiden’s eyes as well. However, he hadn’t asked. Because he felt that it was quite rude to ask. Now that he heard the old man speak about it, he knew that her eyes weren’t ordinary. Otherwise, a Rebirth Realm expert would display such fear towards it.

Meanwhile, the old man added, “Sacrificing two Rebirth Realm experts will make her unable to suppress her cultivation. Once that happens, then not to mention a Rebirth Realm expert, even a Dualism Realm expert can kill her. Because if she wants to advance, she must make a trip through the cycle of reincarnation. She can’t move throughout that process. Just like this very moment. She has entered her own cycle of reincarnation. While it would only be a process for someone with her strength and mental strength, and she’ll even be able to recover in two hours or so. However, so long as she does enter her cycle of reincarnation, it would only take a breath of time for me to kill her.”

The old man chuckled at this point, “So long as she’s dead, killing those others from the Nether Pavilion will be much easier.”

Yang Ye finally came to a complete understanding.

Just as Nether Maiden had said in the past, the experts from the large world weren’t fools. Besides the fact that their cultivations would be suppressed, the reason they hadn’t sent true experts down to the lower dimensions was that they feared Blood Maiden and the 1st Hall Master of the Nether Pavilion. So, their main objective was Blood Maiden. They hadn’t hesitated to wait until now and even send two experts to their deaths, just to kill Blood Maiden!

All of it was done for the sake of killing Blood Maiden!

Yang Ye could imagine how much those experts of the large world feared Blood Maiden. Actually, it made sense. After all, she possessed the might of a Domain!

“It’s over now!” The old man suddenly shook his head and waved his hand, causing a wave of energy to shoot down towards Blood Maiden.

Right as that wave of energy shot towards Blood Maiden, a ray of sword energy tore through the air and struck it, and the wave of energy was instantly obliterated.

At the same time, Yang Ye appeared in front of her. He would naturally not just watch as the old man killed her. If he chose to stand by idly now, then even he would look down on himself. It was like how Nether Maiden and the others hadn’t just watched as White Deer Academy was destroyed by the joint forces of the Evil Faction and the other powers in the Radiant Dimension. At that time, they could have stood by idly and allowed the destruction of White Deer Academy, but Nether Maiden and the others hadn’t done that!

Why?

Because they treated Yang Ye as their friend!

Now, Blood Maiden was in trouble, so how could he just stand by idly. He didn’t dare guarantee that he could stop the old man. But he would try his best. Only then would he have a clear conscience.

Lian Banzhuang hesitated for a moment, and then she went over to Yang Ye’s side.

She could choose to leave, but she hadn’t. Because she was very well aware that if she wanted to leave this place, then she had to stay with Yang Ye and Blood Maiden. Yang Ye and Blood Maiden were the only ones here who could leave this place. She had a very good chance of leaving if she stayed with them. But if she left right now, she would be trapped here forever.

She was gambling! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

For the sake of her freedom, she was gambling with her life!

Yang Ye glanced at Lian Banzhuang and remained silent. He naturally understood her intentions. But help was exactly what he needed right now. She was a Dualism Realm expert and was even stronger than him. So, if he had her help, he would have a better chance at keeping the old man busy until Blood Maiden woke up. Otherwise, it was truly difficult for him to keep a Rebirth Realm expert busy on his own!

Even if his overall strength was much stronger than before, he was still facing a Rebirth Realm expert. Even though the old man had been suppressed to the Dualism Realm, his mental state belonged to an expert at the Rebirth Realm, and it was just his cultivation which had been suppressed. So, the old man’s mastery in battle hadn’t vanished at all.

So, he couldn’t treat the old man as a Dualism Realm expert!

He had to treat the old man as a Rebirth Realm expert!

The old man suddenly started to chuckle when he saw Yang Ye and Lian Banzhuang protecting Blood Maiden, “I never expected I would personally encounter a situation where ants try to stop me. But it’s fine. Since both of you are with her, your relationship is definitely not normal. As far as we’re concerned, everyone related to the Nether Pavilion deserves death.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he pressed his right hand down slowly. Just that action made Yang Ye and Lian Banzhuang’s expressions become extremely solemn. Because they felt like the sky was about to collapse!

A wisp of coldness flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes. He flipped his palm, and the ancient sheath appeared in his grasp. There was a sword within the sheath. After that, he drew the sword and swung it!

Om!

A sword howl resounded, and then a ray of sword energy shot up into the air!

Two overlapped Heavenrends!

At his present realm of cultivation, executing two overlapped Heavenrends was absolutely easy. Moreover, his current physical strength and cultivation made the might of his overlapped Heavenrends much stronger than before!

A sword howl resounded, and a ray of sword energy shot through the air. The pressure from the old man instantly vanished, and the sword energy didn’t slow down at all and instantly arrived before the old man.

Surprise flashed through the old man’s eyes when he saw Yang Ye’s attack, “Your sword technique isn’t bad. Unfortunately, you’re too weak. If you could overlap five, then perhaps it would be a slight threat to me. Unfortunately, you can’t!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stretched out his right hand and waved it lightly. In an instant, Yang Ye’s sword energy was obliterated!

How strong! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly from the sight of this, and his eyes were filled with an extremely solemn expression. Actually, he hadn’t had any wishful thoughts that his attack could harm the old man at all. But he hadn’t expected his attack to be destroyed with such ease. It had truly been absolutely easy, and the old man didn’t seem to have used any strength at all!

Now, he understood the gap between him and a Rebirth Realm expert!

If the old man’s cultivation hadn’t been suppressed, he might not even have the ability to fight back! Even though it was quite a blow to his confidence, it was a fact!

However, Yang Ye couldn’t retreat! Once he did, it represented that Blind Maiden would die!

If there was no one to protect, he would have to flee when he couldn’t win a battle. After all, only a fool wouldn’t flee. However, he had someone to protect right now, so he had to fight even if he couldn’t win!

Meanwhile, the old man shook his head, “Weak! Weak to the point that I’m not interested in fighting you!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then his profound energy started surging madly. A moment later, his figure transformed into a ray of light that shot towards the old man.

A wisp of ridicule arose on the corners of the old man’s mouth, and then he waved his right hand. A wave of invisible energy rippled forward, and it instantly blasted Yang Ye around 3km away.

Lian Banzhuang didn’t stand by idly, of course. She’d charged at the old man as well.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and his profound energy surged madly. At the same time, his Quasi Returnal Rank sword intent and slaughter intent surged like a torrent into the Sword Precursor.

A moment later, Yang Ye closed his eyes.

At the moment Yang Ye closed his eyes, the old man’s expression suddenly changed drastically, and then he swiftly looked towards Yang Ye.

Crack!

A clear and loud crack resounded.

The space around Yang Ye had cracked apart!
