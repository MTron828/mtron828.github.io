Chapter 2313 – Mysterious Place!

The towering giant shook the mountains and earth with every step it took!

Bai Zhixian spoke solemnly, “What is that?”

Butcher replied solemnly, “A Primal Titan! Let’s go!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his expression changed, and then he swung his palm in a slicing motion like it was a saber.

Hiss!

A ray of saber energy flashed.

Bang!

An afterimage was blasted away.

It was the Skywalker Wolf!

The Skywalker Wolf had been following them, and Butcher was aware of that. However, he hadn’t done anything about it because he felt that its target was definitely Yang Ye. If it launched a surprise attack against Yang Ye, it would be perfect for training Yang Ye’s senses toward detecting danger.

So, he hadn’t done anything about it.

But he hadn’t expected to encounter a Primal Titan here! Moreover, the Skywalker Wolf just had to attack at this moment!

Butcher turned around, and he noticed that the Primal Titan was looking at them. His expression instantly changed from the sight of this.

A moment later, the Primal Titan slammed its fist at them from afar!

Butcher’s gaze gradually turned icy cold. He waved his right hand, and the chopper by Yang Ye’s waist instantly descended into his grasp. A moment later, a ray of saber energy surged up into the clouds, and then an extremely long beam of saber energy shot down from the sky.

Life Isolation!

It stretched from the sky to the earth!

Yang Ye had executed this move that day too. However, it was very much inferior in terms of speed, strength, and concentration of saber energy.

It seemed like it could split the heavens and the earth. The Primal Titan sensed danger from it, so it swiftly pulled back its hand and pressed its palms together.

The saber energy descended!

Bang!

The Primal Titan was blasted over 30km back, but Butcher’s saber energy had been stopped between its palms.

Butcher’s eyes narrowed slightly from the sight of this, and there was a trace of solemness in his eyes. He gazed at Yang Ye and Bai Zhixian, and then he said, “Go back to the village from the side, I’ll lead it away. Remember not to use any profound energy or fly because the demons hiding in the area will sense your presence.”

Bai Zhixian nodded, and then she took Yang Ye’s hand and left. She was very well aware that they would be of no help if they stayed. However, Yang Ye refused to leave.

Butcher was stunned by this and smiled, “Kid, you’re not bad after all. But your master doesn’t need your help, so you…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye walked over to him, and took the chopper from Butcher’s grasp while Butcher and Bai Zhixian watched with shock. After that, he took Bai Zhixian’s hand and left.

Butcher was stunned for a moment, and then he cursed, “Were you a bandit in your last life? I haven’t even passed that down to you, yet you…”

Meanwhile, a powerful aura assaulted him from behind. Butcher turned around swiftly and pressed his palms together. In an instant, a long saber appeared in his grasp. This was his real weapon.

Butcher swung the saber forward.

Hiss!

The space in front of him cracked open…

Meanwhile, Bai Zhixian was leading Yang Ye swiftly toward the village. All along the way, an extremely solemn expression covered her face. It was because she sensed numerous powerful auras.

Suddenly, Yang Ye stopped.

She gazed at him, and he pulled her behind him. At the same time, an afterimage flashed toward them.

It was the Skywalker Wolf!

Bang!

A wave of powerful intent swept out from within Yang Ye!

Madness intent!

It surged incessantly into the chopper, and then Yang Ye stomped his right foot down and soared up into the air before swinging the chopper with both hands.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted away, and the wolf was pushed almost 300m back. But it only took a moment for it to pounce at Yang Ye again.

Hiss!

Only afterimages were visible here, and the wolf seemed like it had disappeared.

It was too fast!

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was above it when he appeared once more. An instant later, he swung the chopper rapidly.

Madness Saber Technique!

100 swings in a breath of time!

This time, Yang Ye hadn’t aimed at its head, but its eyes instead. The wolf’s skin was too thick, so his attacks couldn’t penetrate it at all. Only its eyes and nether regions could be chopped!

The wolf had clearly noticed Yang Ye’s intentions, so it immediately closed its eyes. At the same time, Yang Ye’s attack struck its eyes.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Dazzling sparks flickered from its eyes, but Yang Ye’s attack still wasn’t able to cut through its eyelids. At the same time, it slapped its claw at his chest.

Bang!

Yang Ye was slapped away again.

Suddenly, Bai Zhixian vanished on the spot, and then a huge ethereal palm appeared above the wolf. A moment later, it descended swiftly, catching the wolf off guard and hitting it.

Bang!

The wolf was instantly blasted far away. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly appeared above it, and then a ray of saber energy descended.

The wolf looked up at Yang Ye. A vicious glow flashed through its eyes, and then it slapped its claws against the ground.

Boom!

It transformed into an afterimage that slammed against Yang Ye. It didn’t choose to dodge Yang Ye’s attack and had chosen to go head-on against it instead. Because it was very well aware that it would definitely win if this continued.

Yang Ye’s body was inferior to it, and so was Yang Ye’s strength and speed. So, Yang Ye would absolutely be unable to persist for long in a head-on battle!

Of course, the precondition was that its thing wasn’t chopped off by Yang Ye!

Now, the Skywalker Wolf was very, very cautious, and it didn’t give Yang Ye the slightest opportunity to get near to it!

Man and wolf collided in midair once more.

Bang!

A wave of powerful energy rippled out in the sky, and everywhere it passed, everything before it was obliterated. Moreover, the powerful force of it even pushed them back repeatedly.

As soon as he stopped himself, Yang Ye stomped his right foot down, and then he transformed into a ray of saber energy that shot up into the air.

A moment of silence ensued, and then a huge beam of saber energy surged down from the clouds.

Life Isolation!

The wolf howled with fury, and then it leaped up and charged at Yang Ye’s attack.

Boom!

The saber energy descended, and a loud explosion resounded through the sky. An instant later, a howl of pain came from there, and then the wolf was blasted away. It flew all the way until it slammed against a mountain.

As soon as Yang Ye descended to the ground, mouthfuls of blood sprayed from him, and countless cracks appeared throughout his body. Threads of blood started seeping out incessantly from them.

Bai Zhixian was shocked by this and hurriedly took his hand, “Let’s go!”

She was about to walk off into the distance when Yang Ye stopped on the spot. She gazed at him, and she pulled her swiftly toward a different direction.

Meanwhile, behind them.

Rumble!

The rumbling of numerous creatures dashing resounded, and then it didn’t take long for a howl of pain to resound from there.

It was the Skywalker Wolf!

Yang Ye’s battle with the Skywalker Wolf had alarmed the other demons in the surroundings, and so they’d come.

A few breaths of time later, a black shadow flashed out of the forest like a bolt of lightning and vanished into the distance.

It was the Skywalker Wolf!

Behind it were numerous colossi pursuing it. However, they were clearly inferior in speed to it. So, it didn’t take long for it to leave all of them behind.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had brought Bai Zhixian into a boundless mountain.

Yang Ye wasn’t traveling based on direction, he was just fleeing in the direction he sensed no danger. So, it didn’t take long for Bai Zhixian and him to lose their sense of direction. Yang Ye didn’t mind, but Bai Zhixian’s expression gradually became solemn.

Danger!

The rear mountains weren’t a place that she or Yang Ye could be. Their strength was far from sufficient to survive here!

They had to get back to the village!

But how would they do that now?

Yang Ye pulled her along and continued toward the distance. He suddenly stopped after running for a while, and then he pulled her toward a different direction.

Bai Zhixian knew that Yang Ye had sensed a powerful demon. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

While Yang Ye’s mind wasn’t in a very normal state, he was no fool. If he felt that he was no match for something, he wouldn’t fight that existence. For example, in the village, he would seek battle with the slovenly old man, but he would absolutely not try to fight Bai Zhixian’s master, Auntie Vege, nor would he seek out Wang Erya’s grandfather.

At this moment, if he refused to go in a direction, it was absolutely because he sensed a powerful demon in that direction, and it was a demon that far surpassed him in strength!

Moreover, Yang Ye had activated the Sword Domain around them, and their auras were completely stopped from leaking out. His current Sword Domain wasn’t what it used to be, and its ability to conceal could even stop those powerful demons from discovering their presence. Thus, so long as they didn’t use any profound energy or cause a commotion, they were quite safe under normal circumstances.

Just like that, they continued forward, hand in hand.

Bai Zhixian could only allow Yang Ye to lead her forward now. Because she had no other choice. She just hoped that Butcher would be able to get back safely and bring Auntie Vege along in search of them.

Of course, she wasn’t certain that they would come for her and Yang Ye.

They continued forward for some time before Yang Ye suddenly stopped. There was a corpse in front of them. It was huge like a hill, and it was clearly a Primal Demon.

The corpse was headless, and the cut at its neck was smooth as a mirror. It seemed like it had been sliced off by a sharp weapon.

The corpse was covered in weeds, and its lower half was partially buried beneath the earth. Obviously, it had been dead for a very, very long time.

Yang Ye suddenly pulled Bai Zhixian forward. As they walked, shock gradually appeared in Bai Zhixian’s eyes.

Corpses!

Many, many corpses!

There were demons and humans amongst them, and even some strangely shaped creatures. Besides that, there were many eternal treasures on the ground!

Eternal treasures were artifacts that were merely inferior to treasures like the Primordial Axe of Creation.

They were called eternal treasures because most of the eternal artifacts in Eternal Border had come from the Eternal Universe. While they were inferior to the divine treasures Yang Ye possessed, they were still very, very rare. There were only a few such divine treasures in existence, so these eternal artifacts were the best choice for experts at the True Dao Realm and above.

Now, there were many eternal artifacts here!

A few dozen entered her gaze in just a single glance!

Bai Zhixian was utterly stunned!

Suddenly, Yang Ye picked up one of them near his leg, and then he picked up a second, a third, a fourth…
