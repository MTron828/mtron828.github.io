Chapter 2176 – Until We’re Drunk!

The Demon Dimension!

Yang Ye decided to try in the end. Just as the monkey had said, if the monkey could take control of the demon race, then it was definitely good news for him and the human race.

However, Yang Ye felt that they didn’t have very good chances.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to meet Qiong Qi again!

Qiong Qi was at the Major Zen Realm now, in the same realm as Yang Ye.

Qiong Qi sized up Yang Ye and said, “You’ve grown too quickly!”

Yang Ye could be said to have been with Qiong Qi for a very long time. Yang Ye still needed his help all those years ago, yet now, Yang Ye’s had far surpassed him in strength.

While they were both at the Major Zen Realm, Yang Ye’s strength far surpassed him!

It filled him with all sorts of emotions!

Yang Ye sized up Qiong Qi and smiled, “How have you been in the demon race?”

Qiong QI shook his head, “Just normal. I rarely participate in the affairs of the demon race.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He paused for a moment and continued, “Both of you really plan to take control of the demon race?”

Yang Ye replied, “We plan to try. If we really can’t…”

Qiong Qi nodded and said, “Then let’s go meet the Sages of the demon race!”

They vanished on the spot.

Demon God Hall.

Yang Ye, Qiong Qi, and the monkey arrived at the most mysterious location in the Demon Dimension, Demon God Hall. It was where the strongest expert of the demon race, the Demon God, lived. Actually, the Demon God rarely showed himself in the past, or it should be said that he practically never showed himself. But now that the End Times were here, the Demon God showed himself and reorganized the demon race. Moreover, no one in the demon race dared to against the Demon God with the strength he possessed!

As soon as they arrived at Demon God Hall, a middle aged man appeared before them.

The middle aged man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “The Demon God has been waiting!”

Yang Ye shrugged and wasn’t surprised by this. It was a supreme expert that they were facing, so it was impossible for him to be unaware that Yang Ye was in the Demon Dimension!

Yang Ye, Qiong Qi, and the monkey entered the hall. There was a white robed middle aged man standing in the hall. He had thick brows, a square shaped face, and a faint dignified aura.

He was the Demon God!

There were ten other figures by his side. They were Sages of the demon race!

Suddenly, the Demon God said, “I’m quite surprised!”

Yang Ye said, “I have something to discuss with you!”

The Demon God nodded slightly, and then he gazed at the monkey, “If you willingly help our demon race, then we’ll become the number one force in the Alliance of All!”

How strong was the monkey?

Yang Ye didn’t know, but he did. Even he wasn’t confident in his ability to defeat the monkey. The Buddhist Path was that strong, yet it still couldn’t do anything to the monkey. That alone was sufficient to prove how terrifying his strength was!

The monkey replied indifferently, “The demon race has submitted to the Buddhist Path, so I will never do anything for the demon race.”

The Demon God shook his head, “We haven’t submitted, we’re just using each other.”

The monkey looked him in the eyes, “As far as I’m concerned, you have!”

The Demon God glanced at him, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “Then me why you’re here!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I hope the demon race will take my side. I wonder what you think about that.”

The Demon God replied, “Give me a reason!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I have the Sprite Lord, is that a good enough reason?”

“That’s your Sprite Lord!” The Demon God looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “If you’re willing to give her to my demon race, then my demon race can take the human race’s side!”

Yang Ye walked over to the Demon God, “So, there’s no room for discussion?”

The Demon God replied indifferently, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he gazed at the monkey, “Brother Monkey, your Spirit Ape Clan is in my Human Dimension, so return there with me. There’s no need to differentiate between races at a time like this. I’ll give you absolute freedom. You can help the human race if you want, and I won’t force you if you refuse. Moreover, I can guarantee that if the Buddhist Path wants to look for trouble with you or the Spirit Ape Clan, then I’ll always be on your side!”

His thoughts were very simple, and it was to make the monkey stay in the Human Dimension.

The monkey was so strong, so if he was willing to stay in the Human Dimension, it would be an absolutely good thing for the human race. Moreover, the human race was in dire need of extraordinary experts. Besides An Nanjing, he needed even more experts who could shoulder great responsibility, and the monkey just happened to be a suitable candidate!

The monkey glanced at Yang Ye. He was about to speak when the Demon God suddenly said, “Yang Ye, are you really planning to fight the Alliance of All until the end?”

Yang Ye gazed at the Demon God, “It’s all of you who want to fight me to the end!”

The Demon God fell silent for a moment, and then he said, “The End Times is coming. Why don’t all of us just sit down and have a talk about it? If the entire large universe joins forces, I believe we’ll be able to find a way to survive!”

Yang Ye glanced at him. He was quite surprised! He hadn’t expected the Demon God to say that, and the Demon God didn’t seem like he was being insincere!

Yang Ye replied, “You’re right. Unfortunately, the enmity between my human race and the Alliance of All isn’t that easily resolved. I won’t say more. We’ll just take our own paths!”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away once he finished speaking.

Meanwhile, the Demon God added, “Three months. If the Sprite Lord and you can’t find a way out in three months, then we will be taking action!”

Three months!

Yang Ye grinned, “Don’t worry, I’ll find it!”

Yang Ye turned around and left.

Meanwhile, the monkey and Qiong Qi left with him.

Once they left, an old man said, “Why aren’t we taking his side?”

The Demon God closed his eyes slowly, “We’ve already chosen to take the Buddhist Path and Alliance of All’s side. Moreover, the situation may get worse for us if we take his side. He possesses the Sprite Lord, so there’s definitely lots of trouble tangled around him. If we get entangled in it, then we may die before we even realize what hit us!”

The old man spoke solemnly, “The spirit energy in many areas of our Demon Dimension has started to dry up, and conflict is starting to arise between the various clans. They’re all fighting for spirit veins and spirit energy, and even the Demon God Hall may not be able to suppress them!”

He paused for a moment and continued, “Besides us, all the other races are suffering similar circumstances.”

The Demon God nodded, “Three months. If he can’t find a way out in three months, then all conflict will be moved to him. No one can solve this problem, unless he can find a new way to survive for all of us!”

Conflict!

Presently, even the residents of the large universe had started to fight for spirit energy. So, when the End Times really arrive, the fight for spirit energy would grow even more intense. Or it should be said that every living being in the large universe would go mad fighting for spirit energy. At that time, they would need a way to move their attention and conflicts onto something else, and that would be Yang Ye who possessed the Sprite Lord!

Why?

Because the Sprite Lord could restore spirit energy! So, possessing the Sprite Lord was equivalent to possessing spirit energy!

Three months!

As far as the Alliance of All was concerned, it was the maximum period they could wait. At that time, they would attack, regardless of how monstrous Yang Ye was!

Yang Ye naturally understood that too!

After he left the Demon God Hall, Yang Ye gazed at Qiong Qi and the monkey as they stood in outer space, “Senior Qiong Qi, Brother Monkey, do you plan to stay here or go to the Human Dimension with me?”

The monkey fell silent for a long time before he said, “I’ll go with you!”

The Spirit Ape Clan was in the Human Dimension, and he naturally wanted to go to his clan. As far as he was concerned, the Spirit Ape Clan was the only thing he cared about, and he wanted to find a way to survive for them. Thus, he had to make a choice, to side with Yang Ye or the Alliance of All!

Obviously, he’d chosen to take Yang Ye’s side!

Yang Ye smiled when he got the monkey’s answer, and then he gazed at Qiong Qi, “What about you, senior?”

Qiong Qi shook his head, “I’m of no help to you!”

Yang Ye’s future enemies were existences at the Sage Realm or above. So, as far as he was concerned, he would just be a burden to Yang Ye!

Yang Ye walked over to Qiong Qi and said, “Brother Qiong Qi, you helped me so much all those years ago, and I will never forget it. I’m merely inviting you to the Human Dimension because we can stay together during the End Times. No matter what the outcome is, we can fight together until the end!”

Qiong Qi gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “Alright, I’ll do it!”

Yang Ye patted Qiong Qi and gazed at the monkey, “Brother Monkey, it’s the same for you. Don’t go look for trouble with the Buddhist Path for now. No matter what enmity it is, they will be resolved when the End Times arrive. Now, just cultivate well. There’ll be many formidable experts for you to deal with in the future!”

The monkey nodded, “If there’s one thing I’m good at, it’s fighting!”

Yang Ye roared with laughter, and his laughter spread throughout the sky!

…

Two hours later, Yang Ye arrived at an unknown city in the Human Dimension.

It was an empty city right now because the spirit energy here had dried up, and the people in the city had left.

Yang Ye gazed at it for a long time, and then he shook his head and walked in.

He didn’t ask Snowy to restore the spirit energy here. While Snowy could do that, it exhausted Snowy tremendously every single time she did that. Moreover, restoring the spirit energy here wouldn’t make a difference. Because other places would lose their spirit energy, and then the spirit energy here would be taken too!

It was meaningless!

Yang Ye just stopped thinking about it and sped up. It didn’t take long for him to enter a restaurant, and there were around 20 people there!

Yang Ye grinned as he gazed at the people before him, “You’re all here!”

All of them nodded.

The people before him were led by A’Man, and there was Yu Jing, Qing Chuan, Mad Saber, Gu Li, and Ling…

They were all Yang Ye’s brothers who he’d met in the Dead Dimension!

Yang Ye glanced at them and smiled, “No matter what race we’re from, or what enmity our races have, we brothers will drink until we drop!”

Drink until they were drunk!
