Chapter 1501 - I’m So Afraid!

Translator: InVader

The old man’s expression instantly changed when Blood Maiden appeared before him. Meanwhile, Blood Maiden took a step forward, and then the surroundings were instantly transformed into an ocean of blood.

“AH! Who are you?! You…” The old man’s horrified voice came from within the ocean of blood, and it didn’t take long for his horrified cries to become shrill cries.

A short while passed before the surroundings fell silent. An instant later, the ocean of blood vanished, and Blood Maiden appeared in front of Yang Ye. The old man wasn’t dead, but he was on the verge of it.

At this moment, the old man was lying by Blood Maiden’s feet, and he was on the verge of death. Besides that, his eyes were filled with fear as he gazed at Blood Maiden.

Yang Ye gazed at the terrible state that the old man was in, and he shook his head. The old man was once a Rebirth Realm expert, and he was definitely extremely strong, but could he be compared to Blood Maiden?

Moreover, the old man was once a Rebirth Realm expert, but he was just at the Dualism Realm right now. Coupled with the fact that he’d been imprisoned for so many years, his body wasn’t at its peak. So, how could he be a match for Blood Maiden? No, it should be said that he didn’t even have the ability to fight back against her! After all, Blood Maiden was at the Rebirth Realm right now!

The reason she was still at the Rebirth Realm and not the Dualism Realm was that she hadn’t left the Ominous Territory. If she left and entered this place again, then she would be at the Dualism Realm!

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden asked, “Why did you tell me to keep him alive?”

Yang Ye replied, “I wanted to recruit him to fight for me!”

Blood Maiden glanced at him, and then she waved her hand. The old man suddenly let out a shrill cry, and then his figure cracked apart before countless strands of blood flowed into Blood Maiden.

Yang Ye was stunned and asked, “Why?”

She shook her head, “You can’t control such an expert. Even if his soul falls into your hands, he’ll have many ways to kill you. Even though your strength isn’t bad, it’s still extremely inferior when compared to an expert like him. The ability of Rebirth Realm experts is beyond your imagination!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “I thought I could get a powerful expert on my side!”

“You knew he would attack you?” Blood Maiden continued, “Is that why you brought me with you?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m not that great. It’s just best to always be wary of others. I brought you here just in case. I never expected that he would really intend to attack me.”

Blood Maiden said, “Even though you’re a Semi-Deity, he’s a Rebirth Realm expert. You’re like an ant to him. However, you had something that was tempting to him, so he naturally intended to act against you. It’s obvious that a person like him is ruthless and doesn’t live by any principles. So, it’s best to eliminate him. Otherwise, if he stays with you, he’ll bring calamity to you, sooner or later!”

Yang Ye nodded. Blood Maiden made absolute sense. Based on his current strength, he really couldn’t control a Rebirth Realm expert. After all, the old man was many realms of cultivation above him!

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden suddenly said, “I’m leaving!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “You’re going to meet Nether Maiden and the others?”

Blood Maiden nodded, and then she looked at him, “What about you?”

Yang Ye replied, “I’m returning to Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region, and then I’ll be going to the large world!”

“The large world?” Blood Maiden’s eyes narrowed slightly. She remained silent for a long time before she said, “You’ve helped us many times, and especially this time caused their plan to be completely spoiled. They even lost two Rebirth Realm experts because of you. You’re definitely being targeted by them now. It’s very dangerous for you to go there!”

Yang Ye replied, “I have to go no matter how dangerous it is!”

He didn’t know how Zi’er and Snowy were, and he couldn’t rest at ease until he saw them.

Blood Maiden nodded, “You possess extraordinary natural talent, great karmic luck, and fortune. I believe you won’t die earlier.”

Yang Ye asked, “How do I find all of you in the future?” There was actually a reason why he’d asked this question. He was thinking that if he encountered an enemy that he couldn’t defeat, then he would immediately ask for help from them. Based on the relationship he had with them, asking for favors like this wouldn’t be a big deal at all!

How could Blood Maiden not realize what he was thinking? She shook her head and chuckled, “We’ll naturally arrive when we should.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “There’s no benefit from knowing our whereabouts. Because that represents that the Oracle will definitely target you. You can’t endure her schemes right now, and so long as you don’t go to the large world, she probably won’t look for trouble with you. After all, her energy is mostly focused on us sisters!”

Yang Ye rubbed his nose and said, “Fine. See you next time!”

Blood Maiden nodded slightly, and then she patted Yang Ye on the shoulder, “Take care!”

As soon as she finished speaking, her figure transformed into a ball of blood red mist and vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye took a deep breath once she left, and then he left the underground chamber.

Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye arrived at Spirit Village.

As soon as he did, a hand descended on his shoulder.

Obviously, it was Mo Ling. Yang Ye smiled and said, “Long time no see, Miss Mo Ling!”

Mo Ling didn’t speak. She just patted Yang Ye on the shoulder. Obviously, she was greeting him.

Yang Ye smiled, and then he entered the village.

Yang Ye met the village leader, Mo Ke, in a room.

Yang Ye said, “Village Leader Mo Ke, I’m here to tell you that there are no further restrictions in this place. If you want to leave, you can leave at any time through the Eye of the Heaven Dao here.” As he spoke, he told Mo Ke a portion of what happened within the forbidden area of the Ominous Territory.

A long time passed before Mo Ke glanced at Yang Ye with a complicated expression in his eyes, “I never expected you to have entered the forbidden area, and what surprised me even more is that you encountered so much in there.”

Yang Ye smiled, “I didn’t expect it either!”

He really hadn’t thought about passing through Yellow Springs River, but he just happened to have done so. Fortunately, while he’d almost died on many occasions, he’d returned alive in the end. Moreover, his strength had improved tremendously.

Mo Ke smiled and said, “It’s not a bad thing for you.”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Village Leader Mo Ke, since you asked me to come back here, I presume you need something. May I know what it is? I’m quite curious.”

Mo Ke pondered deeply for a moment and said, “I’d intended to make Mo Ling go with you and ask you to take her out of this place. Because she was born here, she isn’t targeted by the Eye of the Heaven Dao. If someone is willing to take her with them, then she can leave this place. Yet now…”

Yang Ye smiled, “Now, there’s no need for that. You can return to your own world.”

Mo Ke nodded and said, “No matter what, thank you for your help.”

He flipped his palm, and a white jade box appeared before Yang Ye, “There are 10 Energy Pearls in here. Every single one of them contains energy that can instantly recover all your profound energy. It won’t be a problem to fully replenish your spirit energy even if you attain the Deity Realm. It should be helpful to you!”

Of course it is!” Yang Ye didn’t refuse it and took the box, and then he said, “Village Leader Mo Ke, I’ll be bidding my farewells if there’s nothing else that you need. Until next time!”

Mo Ke nodded, “Until next time!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, and then he turned around and walked away. When Yang Ye walked out of the village, a hand descended on his shoulder.

Yang Ye stopped and said, “Miss Mo Ling, do you need something?”

She moved her hand to his back and started writing.

‘Thank you!’

Those were the words that Mo Ling had written on his back.

Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t mention it. After all, I got a great deal from all of you too.”

Mo Ling started writing again.

This time, Yang Ye had quite a strange expression on his face. Because the words she wrote were — You’re a good person!

A good person!

Was Yang Ye a good person?

Strictly speaking, he wasn’t. However, Mo Ling said he was. Actually, that wasn’t wrong. After all, most people’s impression of another person was usually not an overall view, and it only depended on how that person treated them. If that person was good to them, then that person was naturally a good person to them. Similarly, if that person was bad to them, then that person was a bad person to them!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and smiled, “Miss Mo Ling, farewell. I hope we meet again.”

Mo Ling’s hand started moving on Yang Ye’s back.

‘We definitely will!”

Those were the words she wrote.

“I really look forward to that! Haha!” Yang Ye chuckled, and then his figure vanished on the spot.

Once Yang Ye left, Mo Ke appeared where Yang Ye had been standing.

“An extraordinary genius!” Mo Ke continued, “Little girl, your natural talent is even better than his. Even though you’ve lost your body, it’s fine. So long as we get back, our Spirit Race will definitely do all it can to rebuild your body.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he looked to his side and spoke softly, “Let’s go.”

He turned around and walked away once he finished speaking.

…

Because of Little Sky, the entire Ominous Territory was undergoing large-scale relocation. Countless people and demon beasts had started to leave the Ominous Territory with Little Little Sky’s help. However, not all humans and demon beasts could leave. Some couldn’t. They were naturally those who hadn’t realized their mistakes.

However, all of that wasn’t Yang Ye’s business. Little Little Sky had to worry about all of that.

Yang Ye didn’t go around the Ominous Territory. He just crushed the teleportation scroll and returned to Ominous City.

As soon as he appeared on the teleportation platform that the Shi Clan had built in the city, a figure appeared in front of him. It was none other than Lian Suyao! FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Yang Ye was about to speak when Lian Suyao spoke solemnly, “You’re in big trouble!”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned and asked, “What trouble?”

Lian Suyao spoke solemnly, “For some unknown reason, many geniuses have descended from the large world. All of them are looking for you, and they say that they want to take your head. You know… many powers are helping them look for you right now. All the famous powers in the lower dimensions are looking for you!”

“The geniuses of the large world? They’re looking for me? To take my head?” Yang Ye was stunned and said, “What’s their cultivation?”

Lian Suyao spoke solemnly, “The Deity Realm!”

“The Deity Realm?” Yang Ye was slightly stunned and said, “Deities are coming to kill me? I’m so afraid!”

Lian Suyao was at a loss for words.
