“Stop!” Suddenly, a furious roar resounded from the sky, and then a ray of golden light flashed. Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly as he clamped the fingers on his left hand together. A golden needle was clamped between his fingers.

Yang Ye’s heart shook as he gazed at it because he’d actually been almost unable to catch it. Moreover, he noticed that the energy within it hadn’t dispersed, and it would continue shooting at him if he were to let go of it!

A white robed young man and 5 old men appeared here.

The young man was around the age of 20. He was extraordinarily handsome, and his appearance was 70% similar to Li Qingyi. However, his countenance was pale to the extreme, and it didn’t seem like the face of a normal person at all. He wore a black leather glove on his right hand, and there were 10 golden needles on it.

There were 5 old men behind the young man, and all of them were at the Monarch Realm!

“Human, are you thinking about attacking my demon race?” The Spirit Ape King glanced at the white robed young man’s group with ridicule in his eyes.

The white robed man glanced at Yang Ye, and then he turned to gaze at the Spirit Ape King, “My Stellar Sky City is in the wrong. We’ll definitely give you an explanation, Ape King.”

“That would be for the best. Otherwise, Stellar Sky City will cease to exist from today onward!” said the Spirit Ape King.

The white robed man nodded lightly, and then he gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Brother, can you let my younger sister go?”

“You’re Li Maozhen!” Meanwhile, Fan Meng pointed at the white robed man while shock filled her eyes.

“Li Maozhen?” Yang Ye frowned a little.

Fan Li who stood by Yang Ye’s side explained, “Li Maozhen is the greatest genius in an area of 150,000km around here. Because he’s the 1st person to attain the Monarch Realm at the age of 20. Most importantly, he even received a recruitment letter from Ocean of Clouds Academy. Ocean of Clouds Academy is a Platinum Rank sect that isn’t inferior to the Ancient Sword School in the slightest. Moreover, their recruitment requirements are on par with the Ancient Sword School!”

“The Monarch Realm?” Yang Ye glanced at Li Maozhen and said, “He’s at the low rank of the Exalt Realm right now, and his cultivation is extremely unstable. It might drop to the Spirit Realm at any moment!”

“Your gaze is truly discerning, Brother!” Li Maozhen coughed a few times and said, “I don’t know what Qingyi did to offend you. However, please let him go. I’m willing to bear responsibility for everything she did.”

“Big Brother....” Li Qingyi’s eyes became misty.

She was just about to say something when Li Maozhen shook his head lightly, “Qingyi, I know that you, Elder Lin, and the others want to save me. However, doing this will only bring calamity to Stellar Sky City. Return the monkey wine to the Ape King!”

“No!” Li Qingyi’s gaze suddenly became firm as she said, “Big Brother, so long as the poison within you is removed, and so long as you recover your strength, then you’ll be able to enter the Ocean of Clouds Academy. If you’re able to join the academy, then even a Demon Commander would be helpless against you.”

Meanwhile, one of the old men who stood behind Li Maozhen said, “Young Master, the Young Miss is right. So long as you remain alive, then even if Stellar Sky City is destroyed today, it’ll definitely rise once more in the future. Even if that Ape King is at the peak of the Monarch Realm, we have no need to fear him with the strength that the 5 of us possess.”

“Is that so?” The Spirit Ape King laughed coldly while strong disdain arose on the corners of his mouth.

Li Maozhen shook his head and said, “If I were to sacrifice all of you to regain my talent, then I wouldn’t be able to rest easy throughout my lifetime. If my heart can’t rest easy, how would I seek the Dao? Moreover, in my opinion, my natural talent and future are fear inferior to all of you in importance. Qingyi, you should know that no one can change my decisions. So, hand the wine over!”

“Big Brother, this is your only chance!” Li Qingyi closed her eyes with pain in her heart.

“If all of you are dead, then would my life have any meaning?” Li Maozhen shook his head.

Li Qingyi fell silent for a long time. In the end, she flipped her palm, and then a white jar which was the size of a watermelon appeared in her grasp. As soon as it appeared, a strand of refreshing fragrance effused out from it, and it caused the spirits of everyone here to be refreshed.

It was especially so for Yang Ye, and his eyes even burned with desire. If he drank that jar of monkey wine, then he was confident that he could instantly step foot into the Exalt Realm and even restore his physical body to the same realm. Perhaps, he might even allow his body to rise a step further and attain a level comparable to Monarch Realm demon beasts. So, he’d almost been unable to refrain from seizing it!

At this moment, he still had Li Qingyi restrained, so he was confident that he would definitely succeed if he were to seize it now. However, he gave up on doing so in the end. Because he would be unable to protect Fan Meng if he did! If he paid a certain price, then he had a very good chance of escaping, but Fan Meng wouldn’t be able to escape at all!

The Spirit Ape King waved his hand, and the wine instantly fell into his grasp. He seemed to heave a sigh of relief as he gazed at it, and a short while passed before he suddenly looked up at Li Qingyi while killing intent flashed through his eyes, “Human, you actually took advantage of the moment I was sleeping to steal the wine that I brewed myself! How would I be able to hold my head up high if I allowed you to return with your life intact?”

The Spirit Ape King was about to attack, but Li Maozhen and the old men stood in front of Li Qingyi.

Meanwhile, Li Maozhen said, “Ape King, my Stellar Sky City is absolutely in the wrong in this matter!”

When he spoke up to this point, he waved his hand, and a spatial ring appeared before the Spirit Ape King, “There are 5,000 extreme-grade energy stones and one Monarch Realm inner core in there. They’re some gifts of mine. I hope you’ll accept it!”

“What if I don’t?” The killing intent in the Spirit Ape King’s eyes didn’t reduce at all. After all, his monkey wine had been stolen by a human, and it was even a human at the Exalt Realm. He would be utterly humiliated if word of this were to spread!

Li Maozhen said, “Then we’ll fight each other to the death!”

“Are you threatening me?” The killing intent in the Spirit Ape King’s eyes was almost material.

Li Maozhen replied, “Perhaps we won’t be able to kill you, but it’s absolutely possible for us to heavily injure you and this mountain range which you protect. You should be clearly aware that if you were to suffer a heavy injury, then countless experts from both the human race and demon race would come looking for you. At that time.... Heh....”

The Spirit Ape King stared fixedly at Li Maozhen. A short while passed before he said, “Human, I’ll remember you!” As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and led the demon beasts away.

Yang Ye seemed to be lost in thought as he watched the Spirit Ape King leave.

After the Spirit Ape King left with the demon beasts, Li Maozhen turned around to look at Yang Ye and said, “Brother, can you let Qingyi go now?”

“1,000 extreme-grade energy stones!” said Yang Ye.

“Who do you think you are?” One of the old men behind Li Maozhen was furious.

Yang Ye squeezed down on Li Qingyi’s throat, and then he lifted her up from the ground. He gazed at Li Maozhen’s group as he said, “This woman almost killed me many times, and she even used me and threatened me just now. Hehe. Wouldn’t I be letting her off too easily if I just release her right now?” Actually, if he wasn’t afraid of causing trouble for the Fan Clan, then he would have taken her head a long time ago!

“Don’t you dare!” That old man was exasperated.

A ferocious smile appeared on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “Do you want to give it a try?”

The old man was about to speak when Li Maozhen stopped the old man, and then he waved his hand. A spatial ring appeared in front of Yang Ye. Yang Ye didn’t hold back and immediately took it. After that, he withdrew the extreme-grade energy stones within it and started eating.

The corners of their mouths twitched when they witnessed this scene. Obviously, Li Maozhen and the old men had never expected Yang Ye to actually eat extreme-grade energy stones!

“You’ve got your energy stones, so shouldn’t you let our Young Miss go?” That old man spoke in a low voice while killing intent flashed through the depths of his eyes.

“Do you think I’m an idiot?” Yang Ye continued, “You want me to let her go now so that all of you can pounce on me as a group?”

The old man spoke gloomily, “Then what do you want!?”

“Give me 15 minutes!” As he spoke, Yang Ye continued stuffing energy stones into his mouth.

Li Maozhen suddenly said, “Brother, you’re at such a young age yet possess such extraordinary strength. You should be very famous in the area, but I’ve never seen you. Are you from the outside world?”

Yang Ye glanced at Li Maozhen and said, “Your strength and natural talent are really good. Unfortunately, your days are numbered. If it was in the past, then I would have been able to save you. After all, you’re quite agreeable to me. But I can’t even protect myself now. So, you can only pray for luck!”

He wasn’t lying. If it was in the past, then it wouldn’t be a problem at all for him to eliminate a little bit of poison with the Primordial Violet Energy he possessed.

The expressions of Li Maozhen and the old men behind him changed slightly upon hearing Yang Ye. On the other hand, Li Qingyi’s delicate figure trembled as she said, “You... you can eliminate the poison within my older brother?”

Yang Ye replied, “I could in the past!”

“Please save my brother!” Li Qingyi’s eyes had a pleading expression within them, “My Stellar Sky City is willing to pay any price!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Yang Ye shook his head, “I can’t even protect myself now!”

Li Qingyi intended to continue but Li Maozhen said, “Qingyi, forget it. It’s fate!”

Yang Ye said, “You seem to have accepted your fate!”

Li Maozhen said, “I’m dying no matter what. Since it’s like that, why should I choose to spend my days in pain? After all, I don’t have much time left. If I were to spend the limited time I have in pain, then wouldn’t I be really stupid?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Indeed!”

As he spoke, he released Li Qingyi. Because he was at the high rank of the Spirit Realm now, and his body had been repaired by the violet profound energy he possessed.

Yang Ye had just released Li Qingyi when that old man intended to attack. However, Li Qingyi stopped the old man and said, “He killed a Monarch Realm expert with a single swing of his sword earlier!”

The expressions of Li Maozhen and the others changed slightly when they heard her, and they gazed at Yang Ye with slight astonishment.

Swish!

Suddenly, a ray of light flashed through the sky, and then a young man who wore green clothes and carried a black sword chest appeared within their fields of vision.

Fan Meng cried out involuntarily, “The Ancient Sword School!”

“It has been a few dozen years now. I never expected that someone would actually dare to pretend to be a member of my Ancient Sword School within Pine Prefecture. I heard that you’re even a sword cultivator. How interesting. I hope you aren’t too weak. Otherwise, my time would have truly been wasted. Take this!” As soon as the young man finished speaking, everyone saw sword images suddenly cover the entire sky!

8th level sword intent! The Exalt Realm! Fan Meng’s face instantly turned ghastly pale when she noticed the young man’s strength.
