Chapter 1583 - Drag It Into The Pagoda!

Translator: InVader

The spatial battlefield was collapsing and being destroyed, and it took around 15 minutes for the surroundings to gradually calm down.

Yang Ye and the one-armed woman were standing facing each other. They were extremely close apart and no more than ten centimeters away from each other. If one looked at them from a little farther away, one would think that their bodies were pressed together.

A moment of silence ensued, and then the one-armed woman suddenly spoke softly, “You’ve won.”

As soon as she finished speaking, her body gradually became ethereal, and it didn’t take long for her figure to vanish without a trace.

Right after her figure vanished completely, Yang Ye’s entire body suddenly cracked apart. It was definitely an extremely terrifying scene to behold. Yang Ye’s face and entire body started to crack swiftly at a visible speed.

Right when his body was about to crack completely into pieces, a ray of violet light surged out from within him, and then countless strands of Primordial Violet Energy seeped out from the Primordial Pagoda. As soon as the Primordial Violet Energy appeared within his body, the cracking throughout his body had started to slow down, and then his cracked body started to heal.

Yang Ye’s eyes were closed tight while blood flowed out incessantly from the corner of his mouth. At the same time, there was a tiny stone on the center of his forehead.

At this moment, that stone was gradually vanishing.

It was the Heaven’s Eye Rock that Little Sky had given him!

Was Yang Ye’s Sword of Rebirth stronger than the one-armed woman’s Sword of Rebirth?

Of course it wasn’t!

The one-armed woman had created the Sword of Rebirth, so no one in this world was more skilled at it than her. The reason Yang Ye won was firstly because he had the Sword Domain, and he’d used it earlier. Even though she hadn’t utilized sword intent and made him unable to suppress her with the Sword Domain, the Sword Domain wasn’t just able to suppress sword intent.

In the past, the reason he hadn’t dared to utilize the Sword Domain to suppress enemies who were stronger than him was that once their attacks surpassed the limits of his Sword Domain, he would have to pay a painful price! He would have to pay with his lifespan!

But he couldn’t be bothered about that during this battle. He was very well aware of the Sword of Rebirth’s might. If he didn’t utilize the Sword Domain to weaken it, he would definitely die from her attack! He’d used the Sword Domain to suppress her, and it caused her Sword of Rebirth to be drastically weakened. However, it was still far from sufficient. At the critical moment, he’d even used the Heaven’s Eye Rock that Little Sky had given him.

Even with the Heaven’s Eye Rock and the Sword Domain, he’d almost been obliterated by her attack!

There was a gap between him and her, and he was very well aware of that gap in strength. Since the battle began, he’d noticed that gap. Regardless of whether it was their attainments in the Sword Dao or any other aspect, the one-armed woman was superior in all of them.

Even though he’d almost died at the hands of the one-armed woman, there were some benefits from this. For example, he’d realized and understood where his Sword Dao was lacking!

Consolidation!

Or to be more precise, it lacked accumulation. The one-armed woman had a much better grasp of the Sword Dao than he did, and that was the main reason why he was constantly suppressed by her in battle. The only way to accomplish that was through accumulation. Currently, his attainments in the Sword Dao weren’t very consolidated. It was normal because he hadn’t experienced much at his age, so it wasn’t realistic for him to be able to accumulate that much experience.

Fortunately, the battle he had with her had allowed him to discover his future path in the Sword Dao.

An hour later, Yang Ye’s injuries were practically completely healed. Unless his opponent could kill him in an instant, the Primordial Violet Energy from the Primordial Pagoda could heal him as quickly as possible. That was the truly extraordinary aspect about him!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he vanished on the spot.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to hear the sound of fighting, so he sped up.

Suddenly, a huge explosion resounded, and then a figure flew in his direction.

Yang Ye’s expression changed at the sight of the figure, and he hurriedly went over to catch the figure. Because it was An Nanjing!

Once he arrived behind her, Yang Ye placed his hand on her back. But as soon as his hand came into contact with her back, his expression changed. Because a wave of powerful force traveled through her body and onto his hand.

Bang!

An Nanjing and Yang Ye were pushed over 30m further before they finally stopped!

An Nanjing turned to look at Yang Ye, “You won?”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he looked ahead. An Nanjing’s opponent was a black robed man. It was one of the three black robed men who were by Fan Yinyu’s side earlier.

“Let’s fight together!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye intended to attack.

However, An Nanjing shook her head, “Let me do it myself. Go help them instead. Their opponents are much stronger than my opponent!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Can you deal with him?”

“Trust me!” An Nanjing continued, “I need someone strong to practice on. I can’t go all out against you, but I can when I’m fighting him!”

Yang Ye hugged her lightly, “Be careful!” He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

He was quite confident in An Nanjing. Moreover, he knew her character well. She wasn’t someone to stubbornly insist if she knew she couldn’t do something. If the black robed man really wasn’t someone she could fight, she would definitely not insist.

Once Yang Ye left, An Nanjing tightened her grip on Skysplit, and then she gazed at the black robed man. She tapped her right foot down and transformed into a ray of golden light that shot forward.

The battle erupted!

Even though all of them were fighting in spatial battlefields, they weren’t fighting a chaotic battle. They were divided into countless battlefields.

It was normal because if they fought a group battle at one spot, then even this expanse of space would definitely collapse.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to stop. Nether Maiden, Oblivion Maiden, and Ice Maiden were not too far ahead of him. Their opponent was two black robed men.

These auras emanated by these two black robed men were much stronger than the previous black robed man. Even their joint forces weren't sufficient to gain an advantage over the two black robed men. Moreover, the three of them actually showed signs of being suppressed.

Yang Ye was able to lend them a hand, but Nether Maiden’s voice suddenly resounded in his mind, “Go help Fourth Sister and the others! Hurry!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and then he transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot. Because there was a trace of anxiety in Nether Maiden’s voice.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to stop again. Around 3km ahead was a huge golden dragon that was swinging its tail madly. As for the golden dragon’s targets, it was Boundary Maiden, the pig riding young woman, and Light Maiden.

Three against one!

However, even if it was three against one, the three of them were still completely suppressed by the huge golden dragon. The huge golden dragon was so strong that even the pig riding young woman didn’t dare go head-on against it!

It could be said that its strength even surpassed Qiong Qi. Of course, Qiong Qi hadn’t recovered completely. If Qiong Qi fully recovered, then the huge golden dragon would probably be no match for Qiong Qi. After all, Qiong Qi was so proud about himself…

“What are you still standing there for?! Hurry up and help!” Suddenly, the pig riding young woman’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind.

Yang Ye was slightly stunned. She really doesn’t hold back at all!

Yang Ye didn’t continue watching, and he charged at the golden dragon. However, he hadn’t even been able to arrive in front of it before a claw slammed down in his direction.

Yang Ye’s expression changed. He didn’t dare act carelessly. He swiftly drew his sword and swung it!

Five overlapped Heavenrends!

Boom!

An explosion resounded. The claw was blasted back, but Yang Ye was instantly blasted around 3km away.

Yang Ye had stopped his figure 3km away, but his hand was still trembling, and the sword in his grasp seemed like it would fall down at any moment!

“This dragon is the Heavenly Dragon Clan’s previous patriarch! Be careful!” Meanwhile, the pig riding young woman’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “It’s so strong that it’s capable of crushing the sky and splitting the ground. Even Second Sister wouldn’t dare to underestimate it.”

The Heavenly Dragon Clan’s previous patriarch! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He hadn’t expected this dragon to actually be from the Heavenly Dragon Clan!

Fan Yinyu is really capable! She was actually able to make the previous patriarch of the Heavenly Dragon Clan willingly fight on her behalf!

Roar!

Meanwhile, the huge golden dragon roared with fury, and then its huge tail swept forward. Because it was so huge, its sweeping tail instantly covered the expanse of space that Yang Ye and all the others were in.

They either had to retreat or go head-on against it.

It was impossible for them to retreat because it was too swift. So, they had no choice but to go head-on against it!

“Attack with us!” As soon as the pig riding young woman finished speaking, she raised her saber and swung it at the dragon tail. Meanwhile, Boundary Maiden and Light Maiden charged towards the tail as well.

Yang Ye naturally didn’t stand by idly. He immediately transformed into a ray of light that charged over as well.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Numerous muffled explosions resounded, and then Yang Ye and the mothers were blasted flying.

Pu!

As soon as he stopped himself, a mouthful of blood sprayed from Yang Ye’s mouth. Yang Ye wasn’t the only one who spat out blood, the pig riding young woman and the others were the same. At this moment, all three of them had pale countenances. Obviously, they were injured.

Yang Ye looked up at the huge golden dragon, and there was an extremely solemn expression in his eyes. The huge golden dragon’s defenses were abnormally strong, and it was almost comparable to the casket lid!

Suddenly, the tail swept towards them again.

Everywhere it passed, space started rippling and seemed to be on the verge of collapse! It was an absolutely shocking sight!

Yang Ye and the others’ expressions changed.

The pig riding young woman and the others were about to attack. However, Yang Ye suddenly sheathed his sword and charged towards the tail. When he was about to arrive before the tail, he clenched his right fist and slammed it forward.

The Elemental Breaker!

Boom!

The pig riding young woman and the others watched with astonishment as the dragon’s tail instantly shot backwards upon coming into contact with Yang Ye’s fist. At the same time, the dragon’s colossal body actually started to tremble violently. It seemed like it was shivering. Moreover, besides rage, there was a wisp of visible pain in its eyes!

The pig riding young woman gazed at Yang Ye, “When did that fellow become so strong?”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye glanced at his fist. He hadn’t expected his punch to be that strong.

“Hey! You can drag that big fellow into the pagoda!” Suddenly, Little Sky’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he gazed at the huge golden dragon.
