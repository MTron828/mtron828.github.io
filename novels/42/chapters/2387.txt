Chapter 2388 – Haughty Primal True Dragon!

Divine Martial World.

It didn’t take Yang Ye long to arrive at Divine Martial World with the Myriad World Diagram. Yang Ye was quite shocked by its speed of teleportation, but the location gave Yang Ye quite the trouble!

At this moment, he was on a wide stage, or to be more precise, he was in an arena. Countless people were in the surroundings, and all of them had their gazes on him!

A woman with a sword in hand was standing before him.

She too was looking at him right now.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and his gaze stopped on her in the end. She had a good figure, especially her legs, they were very long and pale. Because she was only wearing a pair of leather shorts, her long legs were fully visible before his eyes.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Uh, sorry for disturbing you!”

He turned around with the intent to leave, but the woman suddenly tapped her foot down, and then sword energy arced like a crescent and flashed over to Yang Ye.

The sword energy dispersed to reveal her figure.

“Crescent Arc Flash!” Someone exclaimed with surprise, “I never expected Senior Sister Ye to have cultivated it to such an extent. Amazing, truly amazing.”

“Of course! Senior Sister Ye is the most outstanding disciple in our North Charge Sect.”

“He actually dared to get into the arena to challenge her. He… Eh, I’ve never seen him before!”

She sized up Yang Ye and asked, “What’s your name?”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s just an accident. Farewell!”

Yang Ye tapped his right foot down and shot up into the air. Meanwhile, the woman was stunned for a moment, and then she shot up into the air and went after Yang Ye.

In the clouds, Yang Ye frowned when he sensed her following him, and he stopped on the spot. Meanwhile, she appeared before him.

Yang Ye asked, “Do you need something?”

She sized up Yang Ye and asked, “You’re a sword cultivator?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She grinned, “In Divine Martial Continent, where everyone cultivates in the Martial Dao, there are very few sword cultivators. I’m in a good mood, so I can give you some guidance.”

Yang Ye was stunned.

She continued, “Come, swing your sword and let me see your skill!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “It isn’t necessary right?”

“Not necessary?” She was stunned and spoke angrily, “Kid, do you know that it’s a huge fortuitous encounter to you? Cut the crap and let me see how strong you are.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and took a step forward, and then a sword was pressing against her forehead.

She was stunned on the spot.

Yang Ye lowered his sword and walked away. Suddenly, she appeared in front of Yang Ye and bowed, “I’m sorry for failing to discern a senior like you.”Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Yang Ye glanced at her, “What’s your name?”

She hurriedly said, “Ye Xiaotian, the North Charge Sect is my home!” Her eyes were filled with pride as she finished speaking.

Yang Ye felt speechless.

She hesitated for a moment and said, “Senior, um… Would you like to visit my sect?”

The North Charge Sect!

Yang Ye glanced at the area below and asked, “Is the North Charge Sect powerful?”

“Of course!” She was immediately filled with energy, “The North Charge Sect is the strongest in a at least 500,000km around here, and my father’s a Limitbreaker Realm expert!”

She glanced at Yang Ye and continued, “Um, Senior, are you at the Limitbreaker Realm?”

Yang Ye smiled, “The True Dao Realm!”

“Impossible!” She was quite agitated, “Normal True Dao Realm experts can’t even resist a single move of mine, so how could you possibly be one? As far as I’m concerned, you’re at least a One World Realm expert!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Forget that. Anyway, your father is the master of the North Charge Sect, right?”

She nodded, “Why?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Can you take me to see him?”

He was here to look for An Nanjing. However, he couldn’t contact her right now. So, he could only see help from others.

Ye Xiaotian was slightly hesitant when she heard him, and Yang Ye smiled, “What is it?”

She hesitated for a moment and asked, “Why are you looking for my father?”

Yang Ye grinned, “To see if he can help me with something. Of course, it won’t be for free. I’ll repay him. Well, just forget I said anything if you can’t.”

He turned around and walked away.

She hesitated a while longer. In the end, she said, “I’ll take you to him, but can you give me some guidance in the Sword Dao?”

Yang Ye grinned, “Of course!”

She cracked a smile, “Senior, please come with me!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he went to North Charge Sect with her. He sized up the surroundings. The sect wasn’t too big, but it wasn’t small either. No matter what, if he could gain their help, it would be a good thing for him.

Ye Xiaotian led Yang Ye to a large hall, but they were stopped at the entrance.

It was a black clothed old man who’d stopped them.

Ye Xiaotian said, “Uncle Mo, I want to see my father!”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye, and then gazed at Ye Xiaotian, “Your father is with guests. I can’t let you disturb him right now!”

“Guests?” She frowned slightly, “What guests?”

The black clothed old man smiled, “The master of the Skywalker Sect.”

Ye Xiaotian hesitated for a moment and gazed at Yang Ye. The latter smiled, “It’s fine. I can wait.”

She was about to speak when the old man suddenly asked, “And who is this?”

His gaze had descended onto Yang Ye.

Ye Xiaotian hurriedly replied, “This is…”

“A friend!” Yang Ye smiled, “I’m her friend!”

A friend!

Ye Xiaotian glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Yeah! Uncle Mo, he’s a friend of mine.”

She gazed at Yang Ye, “How about you rest in my courtyard first? We can come again once my father is done!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright!”

Ye Xiaotian turned around and left. Yang Ye nodded slightly to the old man and followed her.

The old man glanced at Yang Ye, and no one knew what he was thinking.

Ye Xiaotian led Yang Ye to her abode. It wasn’t a very huge courtyard house, but it was very exquisite, and there were numerous formations in the surroundings.

She opened the door of a room for Yang Ye, “Senior, you can rest here for now. I’ll go over and wait for my father to be done. I’ll immediately notify you once I know more.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Thanks!”

Ye Xiaotian cracked a smile and left. Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “I took a look, and I noticed that your sect isn’t a sect that focuses on the sword. So why did you choose the sword?”

She stopped and gazed at Yang Ye with slight excitement, “Because it’s cool. Just think about it, sword cultivators flying through the world on their sword while carrying out righteous deeds. Killing all evil they come across, and then leaving coolly on their sword. Isn’t it really cool?”

Yang Ye felt quite speechless.

She was cultivating in the sword just because it was cool?

Ye Xiaotian smiled, “Senior, do you think I’m very childish?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Not at all. It’s a single sword, but there are a million paths. Since you like this path, then do it and work hard for it.”

Her smile grew even more brilliant after receiving Yang Ye’s affirmation, and she bowed respectfully to him, “Thank you for the guidance, Senior. It has truly enlightened me. Right, I’ll be leaving for now.”

She turned around and left swiftly.

Yang Ye shook his head. Righteousness? It was a good thought, but reality was cruel!

Yang Ye was about to close the door when a black clothed old man appeared before him.

It was the old man from before.

Yang Ye glanced at him, “Do you need something?”

The old man sized up Yang Ye and said, “The son of the Skywalker Sect’s Master is her fiancé.”

Fiancé?

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he smiled, “I’m afraid you’ve misunderstood. We’re just friends, very normal friends!:

The old man replied indifferently, “The Skywalker Sect isn’t of the same opinion, especially my Young Miss’s fiance. So, for your safety’s sake, it’s best if you stay away from her.”

The old man vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye shook his head, closed the door, and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

At the rear mountains of Void Mountain, Snowy was at the Primal True Dragon’s territory, and both Oxxy and Erya were behind her.

The Primal True Dragon was advancing!

After the battle that day, the dragon had shown signs of advancing.

Snowy, Erya, and Oxxy were watching it. The aura it emanated was growing increasingly stronger, and its size was growing too. The Primal True Dragon had been 3km long before this, but as its aura grew, its body was growing too. Besides that, Dragon Pressure appeared throughout Void Mountain.

Dragon Pressure!

Needless to say, it was extremely terrifying. Especially to other demon beasts like Oxxy who possessed an inferior bloodline. Even the Primal Vicious Tiger felt extremely oppressed by it.

Only Erya and Snowy were completely unaffected!

The Primal True Dragon’s figure gradually became 6km long, and then its aura started to stop growing.

The Two World Realm!

This dragon was a demon at the Two World Realm!

Yang Ye was about to show himself when the dragon suddenly gazed at Erya, and then Dragon Pressure slammed down upon her!

Provocation filled the Primal True Dragon’s eyes!

Revenge!

Erya had almost eaten it that day, and it had never forgotten that enmity. Now that it had grown much stronger, its first desire was revenge!

Snowy blinked and wondered what it was planning.

Meanwhile, Oxxy shook his head and moved behind Snowy.

As for Erya, she licked her tanghulu when she noticed the dragon’s gaze, and then she passed it to Oxxy. Oxxy hurriedly took the tanghulu from her. He wanted to say something, but he decisively moved aside when he noticed the expression on Erya’s face.

Meanwhile, the Primal True Dragon slammed its claw at Erya!

Erya licked her lips while a strange smile arose on her face, and she gazed at the dragon like it was a feast!
