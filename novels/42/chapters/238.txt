Chapter 239 – Beiming Youyu

Their figures flashed onto the extremely large arena at the center, and then they bowed to Li Si before they withdrew to the side.

As he gazed at Yuan Tong, Li Si had a complicated look in his eyes.

How good would it have been if this monstrous genius appeared in the Empire. Unfortunately, he’s a member of the Origin School. If the Empire doesn’t make a move against the Origin School while it possesses such a monstrous genius within it, then the Origin School would definitely become stronger and stronger in the future. At that time, the fate of the Empire would be worrying! Li Si sighed lightly in his heart before he turned around to look at the crowd, and he gestured in midair to indicate that the crowd should quiet down.

After the crowd fell silent, he said, “Everyone, I presume everyone recognizes Yuan Tong who’s standing behind him, and I presume everyone has a clear understanding of his strength. Because there was one extra person when the groups were divided up, my Grand Qin Empire, the six great powers, and the Talisman Master’s Association have unanimously decided to allow him to directly advance into the next round. Of course, if someone present here has any objections or refuses to accept this, then you can challenge him on the spot. So long as you defeat him, you can directly advance as well!”

When they heard this, the crowd below the arena shook their heads to display they had no objections. What a joke! Challenge Yuan Tong! Wasn’t that like courting death? Conversely, they truly approved of this decision. After all, none of them were willing to be in the same group as Yuan Tong.

Li Si nodded slightly when he noticed that there were no objections, and then he said, “Since it’s like that, then I announce the second round has officially begun!”

After that, the participants from every single group started to draw lots, and then they ascended the arenas to battle their respective opponents.

After a few intense battles, the first minor climax in the battles had arrived, and it was because the Grand Qin Empire’s Qin Youran had ascended the arena!

Qin Youran’s opponent was a robust young man. The young man held an enormous iron hammer.

At this moment, the young man seemed to be aware of how formidable his opponent was, and his expression was extremely solemn. However, he didn’t choose to admit defeat right away. In the opinion of any profounder, losing wasn’t terrifying, and it was admitting defeat before losing that was terrifying! Of course, he was even more afraid of losing face. He couldn’t afford to directly admit defeat in front of so many people, and he felt that he had to exchange at least a few moves with his opponent!

Qin Youran gazed at the robust young man and said indifferently, “Attack, otherwise, you wouldn’t have another chance!”

A wisp of rage flashed in the robust young man’s eyes when he heard this. This Qin Youran is truly too arrogant.

As soon as rage arose in him, the robust man stopped hesitating, and he shot rapidly towards Qin Youran. After that, he stomped lightly with his feet, causing his figure to soar into the air, and then he held the enormous iron hammer with both hands before he smashed it down forcefully towards Qin Youran’s head!

Bang!

A low and muffled bang resounded, and then the robust man was blasted out of the arena and smashed down onto the ground.

The crowd beneath the area was instantly stunned upon witnessing this scene because many hadn’t even seen how Qin Youran attacked.

Qin Youran glanced at the crowd while a wisp of disdain flashed in his eyes. Because fighting these fellows was truly a waste of time to him, and only the two women from the two Palace and Yuan Tong were worthy opponents for him.

Meanwhile, the judge at Arena No.1 recovered from his shock and hurriedly announced. “Zheng Junyuan has lost, Qin Youran wins!”

“How formidable! After all, Zheng Junyuan is at the sixth rank of the First Heaven Realm, yet he was unable to resist a single strike of Qin Youran’s. Qin Youran’s strength is truly too terrifying!”

“Yeah, we’re doomed. We’re in group No.1 as well. My god, I hope I don’t encounter him!”

“Directly admit defeat upon encountering him. It isn’t shameful to directly admit defeat in front of him....”

In the vicinity of Arena No.9, Yang Ye glanced at Qin Youran before he withdrew his gaze, and then he shot his gaze towards Arena No.8 because Murong Yao had ascended the arena.

Murong Yao’s opponent was a disciple from a clan. He was called Li Han, and he was at the seventh rank of the First Heaven Realm. Just like the robust man from before, Li Han had a solemn expression as well. After all, Murong Yao was a disciple of the Sword Sect. When he found out his opponent was from the Sword Sect, Li Han knew that he would definitely lose. There were disciples amongst the clans and independent cultivators who could defeat disciples from the sects, but it didn’t represent that he could!

Just like the robust man, even though he knew he wasn’t a match for her, Li Han still didn’t admit defeat right away. With a flip of his palm, a sword appeared in his hand, and then his profound energy surged madly into it. At a certain moment in time, Li Han’s figure flashed, and he instantly arrived in front of Murong Yao before his sword moved at a tricky angle to stab at her throat.

Li Han naturally didn’t dare hold back when facing a disciple of the Sword Sect. So, he’d brought his own speed and the speed of his sword to its limits, causing numerous profounders in the surroundings to be unable to see his figure clearly.

However, right when his sword was an inch away from Murong Yao’s neck, he suddenly stopped moving. Because the tip of a sword had suddenly arrived at his neck and even pierced slightly through his skin, causing a drop of blood to fall on the tip of the sword.

“You’ve lost!” Murong Yao withdrew her sword before she gazed at the judge.

“The Sword Sect’s Murong Yao is victorious!” The judge announced immediately.

“What a swift strike of the sword! Li Han’s sword was already extremely swift, but I never expected that Murong Yao would be swifter. Li Han is really misfortunate to actually encounter a disciple of the Sword Sect. He deserves to lose for utilizing a sword before a disciple of the Sword Sect!”

“This beauty from the Sword Sect is really formidable. Did you see how she attacked? With that speed, not to mention blocking it, it’s even impossible to catch sight of it! Fortunately, I’m not in the same group as her. Those fellows in group no.8 are going to suffer!”

"...."

After she descended from the arena, she arrived by Yang Ye’s side, and then Murong Yao said, “It’s about to be your turn, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he said, “Your sword is really swift. Even I feel slightly afraid of it!”

Yes, Murong Yao’s sword was the swiftest amongst all the sword cultivators he’d encountered. If she’d comprehended Sword Intent, then once the speed of her sword was boosted by Sword Intent, its might would definitely be extremely terrifying.

Murong Yao shook her head and said, “So what if it’s swift? I’m still not a match for you! After all, you’ve comprehended Sword Intent! You should be aware that the suppression of Sword Intent is even more obvious when it’s utilized against sword cultivators.”

When she spoke up to here, Murong Yao paused for a moment, hesitated briefly, and then said, “Can you tell me how you comprehended Sword Intent?”

Actually, she didn’t want to ask. After all, asking about things like this was a huge taboo. However, she really wanted to gain knowledge about Intent like the Sword Intent.

Yang Ye smiled and said, “Actually, the key to comprehending Sword Intent is in the word ‘comprehension’, and it places emphasis on the mental state. When the mind is enlightened and the time is right, then you’ll naturally comprehend it. Otherwise, no matter how hard you try, it would probably be difficult to comprehend such Intent.”

Actually, he didn’t know much about Sword Intent as well. The reason he’d comprehended it at that time was because of the change in his mental state. As for this sort of change in the mental state, he was unable to give a clear explanation about it!

“A change in the mental state?” Murong Yao muttered in a low voice.

“Arena No.9, the Sword Sect’s Yang Ye against the Beiming Clan’s Beiming Youyu!” Right at this moment, the judge for Arena No.9 suddenly announced loudly.

Murong Yao restrained her thoughts when she heard this, and then she gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Good luck!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he leaped onto the arena. When he arrived here, countless people in the surroundings gazed at him. Yang Ye was naturally not an unfamiliar person to all these participants because they’d joined forces to pursue him on Ascension Mountain Range!

Meanwhile, a woman that wore a blue dress leaped up onto the arena. She was extremely beautiful and had a slender figure.

As soon as she ascended the arena, she instantly drew some of the gazes away from Yang Ye.

She disregarded those gazes, and she gazed at Yang Ye and said, “I know you!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he said, “Looks like you tried to chase me down and kill me as well!”

Beiming Youyu shook her head and said, “I didn’t!”

Yang Ye shook his head. With a flip of his palm, Violet Spirit appeared in his hand. However, right when he was about to attack, Beiming Youyu suddenly said, “Qing Hai and Nangong Yan were killed by you, right?”

Yang Ye’s expression changed when he heard this, and he said, “Who exactly are you?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

He’d annihilated that entire group of people that day, and this woman was absolutely not amongst that group. Could it be that she was watching from the shadows? But that doesn’t make sense. With the little fellow’s ability, no one can hide before me, and this woman before me naturally can’t as well!

Beiming Youyu glanced at Yang Ye, and then she said, “I’m Hai Xue. I wonder if Brother Yang still remembers me?”

“Hai Xue?” Yang Ye was stunned, and then he sized her up before he said with astonishment, “How could that be possible!?”

Yes, this woman, Beiming Youyu, was like a completely different person from Hai Xue. Even their appearances and bearings were completely and utterly different!
