Chapter 1584 - How Dare You Hit Me!

Translator: InVader

Drag it into the pagoda? Yang Ye was quite hesitant. No, he was actually very hesitant. The huge golden dragon was no ordinary dragon. So, if he were to drag it into the Primordial Pagoda, what if the pagoda couldn’t suppress it? He would really be courting death then!

Once the Primordial Pagoda failed to suppress it, then it would be really difficult to deal with the dragon.

However, would the Primordial Pagoda fail?

Were there any demon beasts that the Primordial Pagoda couldn’t suppress?

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and then he made his decision.

Drag it in!

Once he succeeded, it would be equivalent to gaining an extraordinarily powerful expert on his side!

However, he couldn’t drag it in just because he wanted to. His goal right now was to beat it half dead. Only then would he be able to drag it into the pagoda!

Once he made his decision, Yang Ye gazed at the pig riding young woman and the others, “Beat it up! Beat it to death!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye stomped his right foot down, and he relied on the counterforce to shoot forward like a cannonball.

The pig riding young woman and the others wouldn’t just watch, of course. They immediately followed after him.

The Elemental Breaker combined with force rebound!

Yang Ye was using the Elemental Breaker technique and the ability to rebound force within his opponent’s body. Every single punch he swung on the dragon would cause its body to tremble violently.

At this moment, Yang Ye’s physical strength was definitely extremely strong. Because it was being boosted by the Demon God’s energy. Of course, his strength was much inferior when compared to the golden dragon. Moreover, his strength wasn’t sufficient to pierce through the huge golden dragon’s defenses. However, he didn’t need to pierce through its defenses!

He used Elemental Breaker’s special characteristic to send force straight into the dragon’s body, and then he used the technique to rebound force to detonate the force he’d sent into the dragon.

Simply speaking, it was real damage. He’d disregarded its defenses and caused real damage to the golden dragon. Under such circumstances, the huge golden dragon was naturally unable to endure Yang Ye’s attacks.

As Yang Ye slammed his fists down over and over again, the huge golden dragon was pushed back repeatedly. No, it didn’t even have the strength to move back. Because Boundary Maiden had sealed off the area around it. If it was before Yang Ye arrived, the huge golden dragon would have definitely destroyed the barriers she created. However, it was kept busy by Yang Ye, the pig riding young woman, and Light Maiden. So, it couldn’t spare any attention to breaking the barriers created by Boundary Maiden.

Even though the huge golden dragon was at a disadvantage right now, Yang Ye and the others still didn’t dare to be careless at all. Because it was too strong. Not to mention the pig riding woman’s group of three, even Yang Ye didn’t dare to go head on against it. Yang Ye was gradually wearing it down, bit by bit. He intended to do so until it was completely exhausted! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

15 minutes later.

Roar!

The huge golden dragon suddenly roared, and then its huge tail swept madly through the spatial battlefield.

Yang Ye and the others were terrified by this scene, and they felt happy instead. Because the dragon was getting anxious.

At this moment, they chose to avoid its attacks. Around 15 minutes later, they attacked again. Now, the huge golden dragon was completely suppressed by them, and it was clearly extremely tired.

Suddenly, the pig riding young woman said, “Attack its vital points!”

Yang Ye hurriedly said, “No!” His objective was to drag the dragon into the pagoda while it was alive and not after it was a corpse.

They gazed at Yang Ye, “Why?”

Yang Ye replied, “Keep it busy for a while longer. I need it for something.”

The pig riding young woman and the others hesitated for a moment before nodding. Even though they didn’t know what Yang Ye wanted to do, they still chose to listen to him.

After wearing it down for another hour, the huge golden dragon was practically only able to suffer a beating. Of course, it wasn’t entirely because of Yang Ye. After all, besides the pig riding young woman, both Boundary Maiden and Light Maiden were at the Rebirth Realm. They were extraordinary geniuses, so how terrifying would they be once they were at the Rebirth Realm?

It could be said that if they weren’t keeping it busy and engaged in battle, Yang Ye would be no match for the huge golden dragon if he were to fight it on his own. It was impossible even if he used the Elemental Breaker technique and the ability to make his energy rebound.

A short while later, Yang Ye seized a moment when the huge golden dragon wasn’t paying attention to him and wrapped his arms around its tail. After that, the tiny vortex revolved madly. In an instant, the dragon’s tail was sucked into the Primordial Pagoda. Meanwhile, the huge golden dragon seemed to have sensed something, and it started trembling madly. However, Yang Ye held tightly onto its tail and slowly dragged it into the Primordial Pagoda.

Meanwhile, the pig riding young woman and the others were flabbergasted by this scene. What’s he doing?

Suddenly, Yang Ye gazed at them and said, “What are you standing there for? Hurry up and help me!”

The pig riding young woman was stunned, and then she asked, “How?”

Yang Ye replied, “Beat it up with everything you have! Bash it up!”

They exchanged glances, and then all of them charged at the golden dragon. With them joining the battle, the golden dragon instantly divided a part of its attention to deal with them. Meanwhile, Yang Ye had dragged around 10% of the dragon into the pagoda.

However, it was very strenuous for Yang Ye!

The huge dragon’s strength far surpassed his own, so it was absolutely difficult to drag it into the pagoda. Coupled with the dragon swinging its tail around madly, it exhausted even more of his energy. At this point, he was almost incapable of pulling it further.

Yang Ye immersed his consciousness into his body and shouted, “Little Sky, help me! Hurry! I’m almost exhausted!”

He was really on the verge of exhaustion.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Little Sky glanced at the golden dragon tail which was being swinged incessantly, and then she gazed at Zi’er, “It’s too big. I can’t pull it in!”

Zi’er glanced at Little Sky, “Do you have any ideas?” Zi’er didn’t really know Little Sky well, but she knew that the little girl was no ordinary little girl. She’d witnessed that overbearing display Little Sky had made earlier.

Little Sky sized up the tail and said, “I don’t have any good ideas. We can only try to drag it in.”

As she spoke, she flew over to the tail, and then she grabbed it and started pulling. But it didn’t take long for the tail to swing about and flick her away.

Zi’er was at a loss for words.

Little Sky blinked. Suddenly she vanished on the spot. It didn’t take long for her to arrive at the 2nd level. After that, she went over to the pill furnace. The Divine Yin Flame was within the pill furnace. However, the Divine Yin Flame was in deep sleep right now.

Little Sky chuckled, “Lend me a little of your flames! I’ll count to three. If you don’t agree, then just nod. I’m starting the countdown. Three! Two! One! Oh! You agree!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she grabbed a bunch of flames. As soon as it entered her grasp, her hand trembled, “Hot!”

As soon as she finished speaking, her figure vanished on the spot.

It didn’t take long for her to appear on the 1st level again. After that, she walked towards the tail while holding the flames in her hand. There was a cold smile on her face as she said, “How dare you hit me!”

She tossed the flame forward, and it struck the tail.

Roar!

In the world outside, the huge golden dragon suddenly started emanating shrill cries while shaking violently. It didn’t take long for it to actually enter Yang Ye’s body while he watched with astonishment.

The pig riding young woman and the others were flabbergasted by this scene.

Yang Ye immersed his consciousness into his body. At this moment, the huge golden dragon was moving madly within the pagoda, and there was a ball of flames on its tail.

It was just a ball of flames, a fist sized ball of flames.

But it was exactly such a ball of flames that made living worse than death for it.

Shrill cries of pain resounded incessantly within the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye said, “That should be enough. It’ll die if this continues.”

Little Sky nodded. She waved her hand, and the flame instantly flew into her grasp.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched at the sight of this. After all, it was the Divine Yin Flame! Even he didn’t dare to touch it. That day when he was enveloped by those flames, it was under the condition that the Divine Yin Flame was awake. At that time, the Divine Yin Flame could control its flames from hurting him. Yet now, the Divine Yin Flame was in deep sleep, so he absolutely didn’t dare to touch its flames right now!

Yang Ye asked, “Isn’t it hot?”

“Hot?” Little Sky blinked, “A little.”

A little… Yang Ye shook his head and paid no further attention to her. He felt that she was as mysterious as the Primordial Pagoda, so it wasn’t strange no matter what happened!

Yang Ye asked another question, “When will it wake up?”

Little Sky glanced at the ball of flames in her grasp and replied, “Soon.”

She suddenly gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Actually, if you’re able to control these flames, you’ll definitely be extremely formidable!”

Yang Ye shrugged, “I wish!”

The Divine Yin Flame’s strength was something he’d experienced for himself. If he could fully control it, then even Rebirth Realm experts would be nothing before him! Unfortunately, he didn’t have the ability to control it at all. Even if he had the ability, the Divine Yin Flame wouldn’t necessarily allow it!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at the huge golden dragon, “Serve me, or… Hehehe…”

At this moment, Yang Ye was happy, of course. The dragon’s strength was absolutely formidable. So, if he could subdue it, then he wouldn’t have to fight Rebirth Realm experts on his own any longer.

Roar!

Meanwhile, a dragon howl resounded, and then the dragon slammed its body down at him, Little Sky, and Zi’er.

Yang Ye laughed coldly at the sight of this, “You dare to act arrogantly towards me while you’re in the Primordial Pagoda?”

Little Sky had a mischievous smile on her face as well while anticipation filled her eyes. Normally, she didn’t want the Primordial Pagoda to ill-treat demon beasts. However, this was no ordinary moment. The golden dragon had flicked her away with its tail, and it made her quite angry.

However, the Primordial Pagoda did nothing when the huge dragon was just 30m away from them.

What’s going on? Yang Ye wasn’t really able to maintain his calm anymore.

Meanwhile, Little Sky blinked, and then she started to step back.

The golden dragon was getting closer and closer, but the Primordial Pagoda was still not doing anything.

Some beads of cold sweat had emerged on Yang Ye’s forehead, “Bro, you can’t do this!”
