Chapter 2116 – Limitless!

This time, Yang Ye’s destination was the Buddhist Path!

Yang Ye left the prehistoric ruins and arrived in the boundless expanses of space.

The Buddhist Path was in the Buddhist Dimension, and its entrance was in the Demon Dimension.

The Buddhist Dimension was considered a paradise, and it was created to be independent of the large universe. Powerful formations guarded its surroundings, so perhaps only Progenitor Realm experts were capable of forcing their way through the spatial fort around it.

Yang Ye was completely incapable of that.

So, Yang Ye went to the Demon Dimension first.

Because he had the map of the large universe and the location of the four paths which the Dao Path gave him, it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to locate the entrance to the Buddhist Dimension. However, he was quite surprised because there was a demon beast guarding it.

Even though it hadn’t shown itself, Yang Ye could sense its aura.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “I’m here representing the Dao Path to pay a visit to the Buddhist Path…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye stopped abruptly because a terrifying aura had enveloped him. At the same time, a huge claw stretched out from the sky and slammed down at him.

It was like a descending mountain, and it was absolutely shocking!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly while the desire to kill flashed within his eyes.

A sword howl suddenly resounded, and then a ray of light shot up into the sky.

Boom!

The huge claw exploded apart. At the same time, a furious howl resounded from a huge mountain not too far away from Yang Ye.

Coldness curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, and then he vanished on the spot.

Hiss!

The mountain suddenly split into two at the center.

Right when Yang Ye was about to charge over to the mountain, a colossus rammed itself at him.

Boom!

A loud explosion resounded, and then the mountains at the side were obliterated.

At this moment, Yang Ye had returned to where he’d been standing a moment ago, and there was a huge beast in front of him.

It was like a hawk, but its head was like a tiger. Its eyes were the size of watermelons and carried a ferocious glow.

There was a bloody injury on his chest, and it was simply bottomless. At this moment, blood was seeping out incessantly from there.

Yang Ye glanced at it and said, “I’m Yang Ye, and I’m paying a visit to the Buddhist Path on behalf of the Dao Path…”

Yang Ye’s voice stopped abruptly because the huge beast had charged at him.

It just attacked!

Yang Ye slowly clenched his fists, and then Judgment appeared in front of him. A moment later, he grabbed Judgment and flashed forward like a bolt of lightning.

Hiss!

A string of blood sprayed from the top of the beast’s head, causing it to howl with pain. However, it didn’t stop, and it turned around and slapped its claw at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye didn’t try to dodge it. He twisted his right foot against the ground and shot forward like a bolt of lightning.

Hiss!

It sliced through the beast’s claw with absolute ease, and then it didn’t slow down at all as Yang Ye instantly arrived above the huge beast. After that, he raised his sword and hacked downwards.

If it struck its target, it would definitely open up a bloody gash in the huge beast’s head, and the beast was clearly aware of that. So, it immediately shrunk back and dodged Yang Ye’s attack. While its head had evaded Yang Ye’s attack, its body hadn’t been able to do the same. So, the sword hacked the huge beast’s shoulder.

Hiss!

A string of blood sprayed as the beast howled once more with pain!

Yang Ye didn’t stop. He seemed like a butterfly that was fluttering incessantly all around the huge beast, and as he moved, his figure was accompanied by pillars of blood that sprayed out incessantly from the beast.

It wasn’t at the Sage Realm, but it was at the peak of the Major Zen Realm, and its defenses could be described as being extremely terrifying. Coupled with its size, while Yang Ye’s sword could pierce its defenses and make it bleed a lot, he wasn’t able to cause any lethal harm to it.

However, Yang Ye was in no rush. He planned to just wear it down, but by bit. In just a short while, a river of blood had formed on the ground.

As for the huge beast, it was growing weaker and weaker.

If this continued, it would be worn out to death.

Around 15 minutes later, its legs were sliced off by a ray of light, and then it crashed to the ground.

A sword howl resounded, and then Yang Ye descended before it. Suddenly, a voice came from afar, “Master Yang, please show mercy!”

Yang Ye looked over and saw a middle aged man in a monk’s robe walking slowly in his direction.

A Sage!

Yang Ye sized him up and said, “Give me a reason!”

The man pressed his palms together and bowed slightly to Yang Ye, “Master Yang Ye, as they say, saving a life is more valuable than building a pagoda with seven levels. It may be a demon beast, but it’s still a living being. If you’re willing to put down your sword and spare it, it’s a huge merit for you.”

Yang Ye replied, “It wanted to kill me first. So killing it is within my rights of self-defense, right?”

The man said, “It’s only trying to kill you because its orders are to protect this place. Master Yang, you trespassed here without an invitation from my Buddhist Path, and that’s why it attacked you!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I see. Looks like it’s my fault.”

Yang Ye put his sword away.

The man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “They say you’re an unreasonable person, but it seems to me that you’re very reasonable!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Not at all. Since you’re being reasonable with me, I’m naturally being reasonable with you. Right, I’m here representing the Dao Path, I wonder if the Buddhist Path welcomes this visit of mine. If you don’t, I can leave immediately.”

The man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Since you’re here on behalf of the Dao Path, how can my Buddhist Path not welcome you. Master Yang, please come with me.”

He turned around and left.

Yang Ye glanced at the man and followed him.

Roar!

Suddenly, the demon beast roared with fury at Yang Ye while it laid there on the ground.

Yang Ye gazed at it and said, “Why don’t you try making another sound!”

A ferocious glow flashed within its eyes, but its expression changed when it saw a sword appear in Yang Ye’s grasp, and the ferocious glow transformed into fear.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Be good. Understand?”

Yang Ye turned around and left once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye followed the man to the Buddhist Dimension. The first impression it gave him was a place full of temples. Besides that, there were many people in the Buddhist Dimension. However, Yang Ye was surprised to realize that all of them believed in Buddha.

“Believers!” Meanwhile, the man smiled, “Everyone in the Buddhist Dimension believes in my Buddhist Path.”

Yang Ye nodded, “There are so many of them!”

The man grinned, “Master Yang, we’re here.”

Yang Ye stopped. There was a temple before him, and it was called Divine Word Temple.

The man smiled, “Master Yang, please stay here for now.”

Yang Ye asked, “How long?”

The man replied, “Just a day. Many geniuses of my Buddhist Path have heard of your arrival, and they’ve admired you for a long time. So, now that you’re here, they would like to seek guidance from you. I hope you’ll provide them with guidance when the time comes.”

Yang Ye glanced at the man and smiled, “Of course, I’d like to meet the geniuses of the Buddhist Path too.”

The man pressed his palms together, bowed slightly to Yang Ye, and left.

Yang Ye grinned, and then he entered the temple.

There was a huge statue in the temple, and it was the statue of the Buddhist Path’s ancestor.

Yang Ye glanced at it, and then he pressed his hands together, bowed slightly, and then sat cross-legged at the side.

He planned to try peaceful means before using force!

Since the Buddhist Path was being courteous to him, he naturally had to do the same.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground and closed his eyes.

Cultivate!

Presently, he didn’t want to waste even a moment. Because he’d obtained a huge amount of knowledge in the prehistoric ruins, and he hadn’t absorbed all of it yet. For example, the control of energy in the world, and fortifying his own cultivation.

All of it had to be completed one step at a time.

Now, he kept making Snowy cultivate with him. Because according to the prehistoric expert, Snowy shouldn’t be just a cute face, and her natural talent wasn’t something that just anyone could compare to. So, if she could cultivate seriously, her future would be limitless.

Make Snowy cultivate on her own? That was impossible. But if she was asked to cultivate with Yang Ye, then it still could be discussed. Of course, she would constantly alternate between cultivating and playing.

Tian Xiu refused to remain alone while Snowy cultivated, so she made Yang Ye teach her too. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

However, what happened next utterly puzzled Yang Ye.

Because Tian Xiu couldn’t cultivate!

Yang Ye stood before Tian Xiu with her hand in his grasp. A long time passed before he shook his head, “Impossible. There’s actually no Dantian in you. How is this possible? It’s impossible!”

Normally, everyone had a Dantian, but Tian Xiu really didn’t have one. Moreover, Yang Ye noticed that Tian Xiu rejected spirit energy, including his violet energy!

As soon as his violet energy tried to enter her body, it would be instantly bounced out of her. In the end, his violet energy couldn’t enter her at all. For some unknown reason, it couldn’t enter her at all. It was like an invisible barrier was blocking it!

Yang Ye frowned, “What’s going on?”

She spoke softly, “What is it?”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “You don’t have a Dantian. Right, it’s something that people usually have!”

“A Dantian?” She blinked, “Why must I have one?”

Yang Ye was stunned when he heard this.

No Dantian!

At this moment, Yang Ye thought of something.

At many times, not having it meant really not having it. But there was also the possibility that it meant being… limitless!

Without any limits at all!
