Two True Realm experts and 72 Zenith Realm experts!

That was the group that had surrounded Yang Ye!

At this moment, Yang Ye realized that the Yang Clan was prepared to disregard its honor in order to kill him.

He had to kill his way out!

He had to kill his way out of the Yang Clan!

If he wanted to survive, the only way was to kill his way out.

Amongst the 72 warriors, it was the Green Armor Unit that attacked first. 30 golden arrows shot down from the sky like 30 shooting stars. In the end, they shot towards Yang Ye from multiple angles, and they completely locked down all paths of retreat for him!

At the same time, 20 spear-wielding Zenith Realm experts in golden armor charged at Yang Ye, and there were 22 cultivators on demon beasts following behind the spear-wielding experts.

All 72 warriors were attacking at once!

In the past, their joint forces had even killed a True Realm expert. They weren’t individually comparable to a True Realm expert, but their joint forces were capable of killing True Realm experts with ease!

Yang Ye tightened his grip on the wooden sword. When the golden arrows arrived just a little over a meter away from him, he tapped the tip of his right foot against the ground and spun on the spot. At the same time, his sword swept out horizontally!

Om!

A sword howl resounded, and then a beam of flaming sword energy flashed out from the wooden sword.

Hiss! Hiss!

The flaming sword energy instantly obliterated the arrows. However, the 20 gold armored cultivators had arrived around Yang Ye, and then 20 spears stabbed in Yang Ye’s direction.

At this moment, all 20 of them seemed like they were acting as a single whole!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he swung his sword horizontally. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Hiss!

A circular strand of sword energy flashed out from the tip of his sword.

Bang!

Numerous explosions resounded through the surroundings. His sword energy that carried two types of unyielding intents blasted the 20 cultivators over 1km away. However, the 22 mounted cultivators had arrived before him, and the cultivator who led the group rode his demon beast straight at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye looked that cultivator in the eye, and then he stomped his right foot down and vanished on the spot.

Hiss!

A moment later, a ray of blood red light flashed, and that cultivator’s head flew up into the air. Meanwhile, Yang Ye had shot into the group of cavalries, and a slaughter began!

Or to be more precise, it was a one-sided slaughter!

Why?

Because practically none of them could resist a single swing of Yang Ye’s sword. Especially when Yang Ye was using the Laws of Darkness while holding the wooden sword. Practically anyone targeted by Yang Ye’s wooden sword would lose his or her head in a moment later.

Yang Ye’s strength was sufficient to kill Zenith Realm experts with ease. Now, he was using the wooden sword, and it had provided a huge increase in strength to him. Because the sword energy released from the wooden sword was much stronger.

As for how sharp the wooden sword was… It could be said that it could cut anything before it! Nothing could stop the wooden sword!

In just a few breaths of time, 10 Zenith Realm experts had lost their heads. However, it wasn’t easy for Yang Ye. Their spears had stabbed many holes open in Yang Ye’s body. Fortunately, his body could endure it. Coupled with the Primordial Violet Energy that he possessed, his life wasn’t in danger at all.

Yang Shen and the old man by his side watched Yang Ye for a long time. Suddenly, the old man by Yang Shen’s side said, “That kid is truly a peerless warrior.”

Yang Shen glanced at his own hand. For some reason, his hand was actually unable to repair itself. Or to be more precise, it couldn’t repair itself as soon as possible. It was like a strand of mysterious energy was stopping his hand from healing quickly.

He fell silent for an instant, and then he gazed at Yang Ye. Even though his gaze was calm, there was icy coldness within his eyes.

Meanwhile, the old man by his side said, “That kid is suitable to be our Yang Clan’s guardian. Unfortunately…”

Yang Shen glanced at the old man and said, “The stronger he is, the greater his natural talent is, and the better his potential is, the more he needs to die.”

The old man said, “The higher-ups didn’t act against him when he first returned. Why?”

Yang Shen turned to gaze at Yang Ye, “Even though his strength wasn’t bad when he just returned, we didn’t take him seriously. Because when compared to Yang Xian and Yang Jian, there was a huge gap between them. However, we never expected that his strength would grow stronger and stronger… As for the potential he revealed, it instilled fear in us.”

The old man nodded slightly, remained silent for a moment, and asked, “What about those people who want to protect him?”

“It’s fine!” Yang Shen spoke indifferently, “No one can protect him today?”

The old man asked, “Why?”

Yang Shen gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “Because that person has tacitly consented to this!”

The old man’s eyelids twitched, and then he gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and sighed softly, “What a pity. Such a genius can’t be of use to our Yang Clan!”

Yang Shen spoke indifferently, “He’s extremely vengeful, just like his father. If he’s allowed to become one of the Yang Clan’s higher-ups and gain authority in the clan, we can’t guarantee that he won’t try to get even with us then. So, it’s best for him to be dead. As for him being a genius, it isn’t difficult for our Yang Clan to foster a genius!”

The old man shook his head slightly and didn’t say anything. It was pointless to say anything right now. Of course, it never did because he was on Yang Shen’s side.

At this moment, Yang Ye was completely absorbed in the battle, and there were over 20 bloody heads around him. However, there were five golden arrows stuck on him. Besides that, there were no less than 10 stab wounds on his chest!

At such a moment in battle, he’d fully abandoned his defenses. If he tried to defend himself, he would only be suppressed. So, he had no choice but to risk suffering injuries in order to kill his opponents. So long as he didn’t lose his head or suffer lethal injuries, then he had no fear of ordinary injuries.

But if his opponents suffered just a single hit from him, it would result in their death!

So, suffering injuries to kill his opponents was the way Yang Ye was fighting right now!

The battle was still going on, but Yang Shen’s face had turned gloomy. He’d thought that the 72 warriors would be able to kill Yang Ye because Yang Ye was already covered in injuries. But he hadn’t expected that while Yang Ye was covered in injuries, Yang Ye just refused to die, and he even seemed to be growing stronger as the battle continued!

Meanwhile, the old man by Yang Shen’s side spoke abruptly, “We can’t let him continue killing them.”

Yang Shen nodded slightly, “Attack!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man by his side vanished on the spot.

Bang!

A wave of powerful energy suddenly appeared above Yang Ye, and then a black spear stabbed down towards Yang Ye’s head.

The powerful energy it contained instantly cracked open the space around Yang Ye!

When he noticed the spear descending from above him, Yang Ye immediately stabbed his sword upwards.

Clang!

As soon as they came into contact, the spear was instantly blasted into pieces. However, the powerful energy carried within the spear caused Yang Ye’s figure to tremble, and then his right arm cracked open in an instant. At the same time, the ground beneath his feet instantly collapsed.

Meanwhile, at the exact same moment that Yang Ye had stopped the spear with his sword, a golden spear stabbed into his back. At the same time, two golden arrows stabbed his knees. Especially, those two arrows, they’d pierced through his knees!

However, Yang Ye was still standing!

Something worth mentioning was that while the wooden sword in his hand had killed many, there wasn’t even a trace of blood on it!

At this moment, there were 25 warriors from the 72 warriors around Yang Ye. As for the archers from the Green Armor Unit, none of them was dead. They’d been supporting the others from afar and hadn’t truly joined the battle. So, none of them had been lost in battle!

Yang Ye stood on the spot with his sword in hand. He glanced at the experts around him, and a ferocious smile curled up on the corners of his mouth, “Continue!”

The expressions of the others changed. Especially the surviving members of the 72 warriors. At this moment, there wasn’t just a trace of fear towards Yang Ye in their hearts, they were terrified of him.

He was ruthless!

Being ruthless towards others wasn’t really ruthless! But being ruthless to one’s own self was true ruthlessness!

Yang Ye was extremely ruthless to himself!

The old man at the True Realm gazed at his hand. His hand had cracked open, and it had been caused from going head-on against Yang Ye. He looked up at Yang Ye, and it didn’t take long for him to look at the wooden sword in Yang Ye’s grasp.

Even though Yang Ye was strong, Yang Ye wasn’t so strong that even the old man had to fear him.

It was the wooden sword!

The sword made Yang Ye’s strength powerful to an inconceivable level!

A moment of silence ensued, and then the old man gazed at Yang Shen, “Let’s do it together. We can’t give him a chance.”

Yang Shen nodded slightly, and then he waved his right hand, “Kill!”

As soon as he gave the order, he transformed into a black shadow that vanished on the spot.

Meanwhile, the old man vanished on the spot as well.

Once the two True Realm experts here attacked, the remaining experts from the 72 warriors immediately vanished on the spot as well.

Their figures hadn’t even arrived before Yang Ye when their powerful auras slammed down towards Yang Ye like a dark cloud. The auras of two True Realm experts and numerous Zenith Realm experts. Their joint auras instantly dispersed Yang Ye’s intents.

At this moment, Yang Ye felt suffocated beneath their auras.

Yang Ye glanced coldly at them. He slowly raised his left hand to his chest, and then…
