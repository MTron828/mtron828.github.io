Chapter 1554 - Charging Into The Deity Realm!

Translator: InVader

Yang Ye had never feared anyone in a one on one battle.

He’d intended to give the old man some face. After all, the old man wasn’t bad, and the old man had even tried to help during his battle with Ku Moye. However, he hadn’t expected Gu Yinglong to be unwilling to stop.

You refuse to stop?

That’s fine. Let’s just fight! I’m not afraid of you!

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath on Gu Yinglong, and he just shot forward in Gu Yinglong’s direction.

Gu Yinglong didn’t waste his breath either. He instantly charged in Yang Ye’s direction, and they both entered into combat again.

The other demon beasts on the ground below exchanged glances. They’d never imagined that even an elder of the Demon God’s Palace would be unable to stop Yang Ye and Gu Yinglong from fighting. However, it did make sense. Gu Yinglong had always enjoyed a superior position in the demon race, and he’d always been like a legend. However, Yang Ye had clearly struck him back down to the ground.

After all, the demon beasts from various clans were watching from below, and they’d witnessed the battle between Yang Ye and Gu Yinglong. Most importantly, Gu Yinglong had been at a disadvantaged position in the battle.

The outcome wasn’t the main point, and the most important thing was keeping up appearances!

So, he was naturally unwilling to stop when Gu Mo asked him to.

Gu Mo shook his head as he watched Yang Ye and Gu Yinglong fight. He wasn’t angry, of course. He’d been young, and he had a temper, so he understood what Yang Ye and Gu Yinglong felt right now.

He knew that it was impossible to persuade them to stop right now. However, he was even more well aware that if the battle continued, then it would definitely transform into one where life and death had to be decided. So, he had to act.

A moment later, Gu Mo vanished on the spot.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded, and then both Yang Ye and Gu Yinglong were pushed around 1km back by a wave of mysterious energy.

Gu Mo was between them.

Yang Ye’s face was extremely solemn as he glanced at his arm. At this moment, he couldn’t feel it anymore.

How strong! Yang Ye gazed at Gu Mo. Besides Blood Maiden, no other Rebirth Realm expert Yang Ye had met could compare to the old man standing in front of him. As for him, not to mention now, even if he could use his sword, he may not be able to defeat the old man.

Gu Mo glanced at them and said, “The Imperial Rankings on Sky Sky Continent will be renewed soon. At that time, both of you will represent our demon race to fight for those rankings. If you want to compete, then see who gets a better ranking for our demon race. Now, save your energy!” His voice carried an indisputable tone.

Yang Ye shrugged and remained silent.

Gu Yinglong glanced at Yang Ye, and then he bowed slightly to Gu Mo, “Forgive me for my offense.”

Gu Mo nodded slightly, “You’re a genius of the Heavenly Dragon Clan, and I understand that you’re confident and proud. However, you must understand that the world is huge, and there are countless experts in it. So, we can’t underestimate any opponents. Underestimating anyone might result in you losing your life.”

Gu Yinglong cupped his fists, “I will remember that.”

Gu Mo waved his hand, “Go on!”

Gu Yinglong nodded, and then he vanished into the sky.

Gu Mo gazed at Yang Ye, “You’re really not bad, and you really surprised me.”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m just alright!”

Gu Mo nodded slightly, “However, Gu Yinglong didn’t use his full strength. Of course, I know that you didn’t use your full strength as well. No matter what, you’re all geniuses of our demon race, so you can’t fight to the death because of a moment of conflict.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I won't offend him if he doesn’t offend me.”

Gu Mo glanced at Yang Ye and said, “You’re at the Semi-Deity Realm?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Gu Mo said, “Congratulations!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

Gu Mo said, “Because you’re going to attain the Deity Realm.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

“Don’t be a fool!” Meanwhile, Man Shi appeared by Yang Ye’s side and said, “Because of the prizes. The first gets many prizes, and one of them is a precious treasure of our demon race, the Ginseng Fruit. You’ll have a huge chance to attain the Deity Realm once you consume it.”

The Deity Realm! Yang Ye slowly clenched his fists. He clearly didn’t have to fear Dualism Realm experts right now, or it should be said that Dualism Realm experts couldn’t pose any threat to him. However, Rebirth Realm experts were a huge threat to him. If he didn’t improve his sword intent with the Sword God’s Seal, he wouldn’t be able to fight them at all!

Moreover, even if he raised his sword intent by force, he wasn’t able to kill Rebirth Realm experts!

The Deity Realm!

If he could attain the Deity Realm, then his strength would rise tremendously. At that time, he was certain that even if he didn’t raise his sword intent by force, he would still be capable of fighting Rebirth Realm experts.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at Gu Mo, and then he chuckled, “So, what does the first get?” He’d almost forgotten about that! He’d forgotten that there were prizes for the first,

Gu Mo replied, “There are three prizes. The Ginseng Fruit, cultivating for three months in the Divine Phoenix Clan’s Hallowed Grounds, and tempering your body in the Pool of a Thousand Lightnings in Demon God’s Palace. Your body isn’t at its limits. If you enter the Pool of a Thousand Lightnings, it’ll be able to temper your body to its limits.”

Yang Ye asked, “I won’t be able to advance further?” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Gu Mo shook his head, “If it was any other demon beast, then it wouldn’t just be possible, they would definitely advance to a higher realm or even two. However, your body is too strong, so it’s extremely difficult for it to rise to a higher realm. The Pool of a Thousand Lightnings is only able to temper your body to its limits. Even then, it’s really good. Because your body will become on par with Gu Yinglong.”

Yang Ye nodded. Actually, he knew that it was extremely difficult for his body to undergo another transformation right now. Regardless of whether it was one’s cultivation of profound energy or the body, it grew more and more difficult as one went further ahead.

Gu Mo asked, “Do you want to consume the Ginseng Fruit first, enter the Pool of a Thousand Lightnings, or cultivate in the Divine Phoenix Clan’s Hallowed Grounds first?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while and said, “The Pool of a Thousand Lightnings!”

It was best to head to the Divine Phoenix Clan after his strength improved. Because everything might not go smoothly once he got there.

Gu Mo nodded, “Come, I’ll take you there!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his hand and vanished on the spot with Yang Ye.

The Meeting of the Clans had come to an end, and Yang Ye’s name… No! The name Xiao Yang had swept through the Demon Territory. Just taking the first in the Meeting of the Clans was extraordinary, but Yang Ye had even gained the upper hand in a battle against Gu Yinglong. So, the name Xiao Yang had swept through the Demon Territory like a plague.

Moreover, the Goat Clan became the center of the demon race’s attention because of Yang Ye. Yang Ye’s status in the Goat Clan was merely inferior to the patriarch right now.

…

Yang Ye followed Gu Mo to the Pool of a Thousand Lightnings on Demon God’s Mountain. The Pool of a Thousand Lightnings was a pool of lightning where the experts of the demon race had gathered divine lightning in, and it was naturally to temper the demon beasts of the demon race.

Yang Ye had quite a solemn expression on his face as he stood before the pool of lightning. There were countless arcs of lightning confined within the pool by a mysterious force. Even though they weren’t as powerful as the divine lightning which the Heaven Dao sent down from the heavens, it still couldn’t be underestimated.

Gu Mo said, “Go in!”

Yang Ye asked, “Just like this?”

Gu Mo asked, “What else?”

Yang Ye smiled with embarrassment, “I thought there would be some sort of protective measures.”

Gu Mo shook his head, “The pool is there to stimulate your body. If your body is protected, then how would it be stimulated? Remember that you shouldn’t use any energy to protect yourself, and you should make your body relax as much as possible.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he jumped into the pool.

Thump!

The entire pool started to bubble when Yang Ye entered it.

At this moment, it felt absolutely ‘comfortable’ to Yang Ye. Anyone who’d been shocked by electricity would be able to understand this feeling he had.

Countless bolts of lightning started to surge madly through Yang Ye’s body!

Gu Mo gazed at Yang Ye and nodded slightly while a trace of admiration appeared in his eyes. He knew how strong the Pool of a Thousand Lightnings was. Ordinary demon beasts would start howling madly upon entering it. Even Gu Mo himself had almost jumped out when he entered it all those years ago. But Yang Ye didn’t even frown!

Not to mention the human race, even the demon race had very few with such willpower!

Actually, it wasn’t pleasant at all. However, as far as Yang Ye was concerned, it was much weaker when compared to the pain he suffered from the backlash of his sword intent.

The backlash he suffered from his sword intent was so overwhelming that he wished he was dead!

So, the little bit of pain he experienced from the Pool of Thousand Lightnings was really nothing.

Time trickled by. In the blink of an eye, ten days had passed.

Suddenly, Yang Ye opened his eyes, and then he leaped out of the pool

Gu Mo suddenly appeared before him and asked, “How do you feel?”

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he sensed the changes in his body. A long time passed before he said, “There have been some changes, but they aren’t very obvious!”

“Of course!” Gu Mo continued, “Because your body is extremely strong as it is. So, the changes you experienced don’t feel so pronounced. However, your body has actually undergone a transformation. Your body is at the peak of the Undying Realm now, and it’ll be comparatively easier for you to improve your body further into the next realm.”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Contentment leads to happiness!”

“It’s good that you think that way!” Gu Mo smiled, and then he flicked a fist-sized fruit at Yang Ye, “Consume it now. I’ll protect you.”

Yang Ye took the fruit and said, “Senior, I want to advance on my own.”

“You don’t need my help?” Gu Mo continued, “The Eye of the Heaven Dao isn’t easy to deal with.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Let me do it myself!”

Gu Mo gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then he nodded, “Alright. Be careful!” He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Once Gu Mo left, Yang Ye took a deep breath and vanished on the spot.

It was time to charge into the Deity Realm!
