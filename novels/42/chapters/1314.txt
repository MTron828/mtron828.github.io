Chapter 1315 – The Human Race Is Finished!

“Terrible young woman?” The demon empress was slightly stunned, and then she chuckled, “That word is quite suitable for her. Her name is Mo Xiaoleng. She’s a young woman who fell from the sky.”

“She fell from the sky?!” Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed, “She’s from outside this world?”

The empress grinned and said, “She should be. Even I don’t even know anything about her background, and I’ve never asked her. I’ve just treated her as my younger sister. Right, don’t offend her. Her temper is extremely hot. Actually, I’m not the one who the demon beasts in my demon race fear the most, she is. After all, offending me will result in some punishment, at most. However, offending her, tsk tsk....”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “I’ve already offended her!”

“Is that so?” She grinned, “Then I can only wish you good luck.”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “I hope we don’t become enemies.”

Even though she seemed very amiable and even friendly, Yang Ye wasn’t a fool who would think that she was normal. After all, could an ordinary person take control of the entire demon race while being a human herself?

She smiled, “You never know. Just let nature run its course!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Farewell.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around and left.

The empress watched him leave. No one knew what was running through her mind.

“Why didn’t you choose to kill him?” Meanwhile, a voice suddenly resounded in the hall, and it was that young woman from before.

The empress glanced at her and replied, “Why should I kill him?”

The young woman answered, “You know why!”

The empress said, “There are 4 existences amongst the human race that are a huge threat to the demon race. One of them is that old fellow from the Nie Clan. You should know who the other 2 are. But they have other objectives in this world, and so long as we don’t disturb them, they won’t pay any attention to the battle between the demon race and human race. As for the last person, it’s him, Yang Ye. Right?”

The young woman spoke in a low voice, “Even though he’s slightly weak right now, he’ll be very strong in the future!”

“Actually, he isn’t weak right now.” The empress walked over to the young woman’s side, took her hand, and walked towards the exit, “That thing on his forehead is the Sword God’s Seal. Obviously, he has been to Sword God Island. Even though I’m curious why that person didn’t kill him, it isn’t important to us. The important thing is he possesses Rebirth Rank sword intent. If he activates the Sword God’s Seal, his sword intent will rise above the Rebirth Rank. Coupled with the fact that he possesses the Sword Domain to suppress the Laws of Time, he’ll be able to pose a threat to us.”

The young woman said, “But we can still kill him, right?”

The empress walked out of the hall, and then she looked up towards the distant sky. There were a few white clouds up there. A short while passed before she said, “But we’ll have to pay a huge price! Moreover, such a genius definitely has great fortune, and his trump card might be even more terrifying than the Sword God’s Seal. If we act rashly, we might fail to kill him and suffer heavy losses instead.”

When she spoke up to this point, she looked down and gently rubbed the young woman’s head, “Moreover, why should we kill him? He’ll be more helpful to us if he’s alive. After all, he would be absolutely unwilling to let the Nie Clan use him. But if he resists, it’ll definitely make him become enemies with the Nie Clan. So, it’s better to let the Nie Clan deal with him. Regardless of who wins, it’s still a good outcome for our demon race, right?”

The young woman fell silent.

The empress suddenly said, “You really like that small pet of his?”

The young woman replied, “That’s a Sprite Lord!”

The empress smiled, “I’ll help you get it if I have the chance!”

“No!” The young woman looked the empress in the eyes and said, “Unless it comes willingly, I’ll definitely bring a calamity down upon your demon race in the future.”

The empress frowned slightly, “What exactly is it?”

The young woman fell silent for a long time before she answered, “An extremely, extremely powerful existence.”

The empress was at a loss for words.

...

After he left the city, Yang Ye rushed towards Heaven Pillar Peak. Of course, he didn’t fully believe the demon empress. He was no fool, so perhaps she’d said that so he would fight the Nie Clan to the death, and then allow the demon race to reap the benefits. However, he knew that the Nie Clan definitely had some sort of secret motive.

However, he wasn’t very certain. But he knew that if the Nie Clan really wanted to seize a treasure that was possessed by the demon race, then it would definitely act soon.

In short, regardless of whether the demon race really intended to attack the human race, or the Nie Clan was scheming something, it wasn’t good for the Slayer Pavilion, the Sword Alliance, and him. Especially when the Slayer Pavilion and Yang Ye had joined the human race’s forces. It would be difficult for them to leave even if they wanted to. If he was all alone, he could go anywhere in the world. However, the Slayer Pavilion and Sword Alliance were behind him, so the slightest mistake might bring calamity to the Slayer Pavilion and Sword Alliance.

Suddenly, Yang Ye and Zi’er stopped because the young woman, Mo Xiaoleng, had appeared not too far away from them.

Yang Ye’s face fell. She isn’t still thinking about taking my treasures, right?!

Mo Xiaoleng pointed at Snowy who was sleeping on Yang Ye’s shoulder and said, “Give her to me and I’ll give you treasures in return.”

Yang Ye remained silent.

Mo Xiaoleng flipped her palm, and the golden flame appeared there, “This flame is very powerful, and it can be ranked in the top 10 of all natural treasures. If you think it isn’t sufficient, I have more.” As she spoke, she flipped her left palm, and a dark blue flame appeared there, “This one is very powerful as well, and it’s ranked in the top 10 too. I’ll exchange both of them for her. 2 for 1, you gain.”

Yang Ye glanced at the flames on her palm. Needless to say, they were definitely precious treasures. If he could obtain them, then if he used them alongside his sword intent, their strength would definitely be absurd. However, would he exchange Snowy for them? Of course he wouldn’t!

Yang Ye shook his head, “She’s a friend, she’s family to me. Nothing can compare to her. Understand?”

She glanced at him and said, “You don’t think it’s enough?”

Yang Ye gazed at her and said, “Even if you offer me some sort of heaven defying weapon of the gods, I still wouldn’t make the exchange. Besides that, I have to tell you that she doesn’t belong to me. I don’t have the right to trade her like goods, and I won’t. If she’s willing to go with you, then I definitely won’t stop her.”

Zi’er glanced at Yang Ye while tender affection filled her eyes. While she stayed by Yang Ye’s side all those years ago, the thing she loved the most about Yang Ye was that he’d never treated her like a pet, and he’d never felt that she belonged to him. Since the beginning, Yang Ye had never tried to take possession for her, and he’d done all sorts of things for her instead.

Yang Ye was a selfish person, but at the same time, he was a man of principle. She believed that even if Snowy was just an ordinary little fellow, Yang Ye would still not make the trade with the young woman before them.

The young woman shook her head when she heard Yang Ye and said, “But she isn’t willing to go with me!”

Yang Ye replied, “Then I can’t do anything about that.”

The young woman said, “But she listens to you. You can make her stay with me. Doesn’t that work?”

Yang Ye asked, “Why would I do that?”

The young woman replied, “I like her!”

Yang Ye was astounded, “You like her, so I should give her to you?”

The young woman frowned as she replied with a question, “Isn’t that how it should be?”

Yang Ye’s face froze, and quite some time passed before he shook his head and said, “That... that logic of yours. It’s truly too amazing.” Needless to say, Yang Ye really had to hand it to her. Because the way she thought was truly extraordinary. She liked it, so it should be hers, and she even spoke of it like it was so natural and right. Such logic....

The young woman didn’t speak further. She just stared at Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye became vigilant when he noticed his gaze. After all, the bad tempered young woman before him wasn’t someone nice, and she might just try to kill him and seize his possessions.

Unexpectedly, the young woman didn’t act. She just withdrew a violet fruit and said, “This is for her. Tell her that she can come look for me if she wants more. I have a huge amount of them.” As soon as she finished speaking, she pushed it forward lightly, and the violet fruit flew over to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at her, hesitated for a moment, and then took it. He would definitely refuse if it was for him, but she was giving it to Snowy. He knew that Snowy would definitely accept it. After all, Snowy would never make things complicated, and she took everything she liked!

Snowy was absolutely pure and naïve!

Yang Ye cupped his fist towards her, “Allow me to thank you on her behalf.”

The young woman glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Leave right now.”

Yang Ye was stunned and asked, “Why?”

She replied, “I’m afraid I wouldn’t be able to stop myself from killing you!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. At this moment, he’d realized that the young woman had always wanted to kill him!

Yang Ye shook his head, didn’t waste his breath with her, and intended to leave. However, she suddenly spoke, “If you can’t protect her, then give her to me. Right, you don’t have to come with her because I won’t protect you.”

Yang Ye turned around and glanced at her, “Have you been beaten up?”

A cold smile arose on the corners of her mouth, “Who would dare to do that?!”

“One day, I’ll smack you butt until it’s all red and swollen!” As soon as he finished speaking, he took Zi’er in his arms and vanished into the sky.

As she watched Yang Ye’s figure vanish, the cold smile on the corners of her mouth started spreading, and then strange laughter resounded.

...

Yang Ye didn’t stay in the demon race’s territory. He took Zi’er along with him as he raised his speed to its limits. Moreover, the demon beasts seemed to have received the demon empress’ orders, so no demon beast tried to stop him.

In less than 2 hours, Yang Ye had left the demon race’s territory and arrived at the desert outside Heaven Pillar Peak.

Yang Ye immediately frowned when he arrived at the desert because a dense array of huge cannons had appeared on the walls of Heaven Pillar Peak, and there were over 10,000 of them. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Those not of my race definitely hold ill intent towards us!” Suddenly, a voice resounded from the top of Heaven Pillar Peak.

As soon as the voice finished resounding.

Bang!

Thick beams of golden light suddenly erupted from the cannons, and around 10,000 beams of golden light shot through the sky like shooting stars before entering the mountainous area that belonged to the demon race.

Yang Ye’s hands shook slightly at the sight of this, “The human race is finished.”
