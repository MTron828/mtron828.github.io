Chapter 2799 – You Don’t Understand!

Good and evil!

The world was divided between good and evil. Some were evil and some were good, but it was impossible for him to eradicate all evil.

However, his order was there to suppress evil!

The world needed order, or to be more direct, it needed laws!

What would a world without laws look like?

Everyone would have nothing to worry about and do as they pleased… It would lead to a loss of conscience, destruction of morality, and the warping of human nature.

A world like that would be hell on earth!

Yang Ye had come all the way here from Profounder Continent, and it had been an absolutely tiny world. It could be said that he was once as weak as an ant, and so he could really understand how helpless the weak felt in a world where the strong reigned supreme.

The strong did as they pleased and the weak could only accept their fate.

As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, the Sword Precursor kept trembling!

Sword howls rippled through the starry sky!

The Sword Dao of Order!

Actually, he’d comprehended the Sword Dao of Order in the past. No, it should be said that he’d merely comprehended its framework in the past. But now, he’d truly comprehended it!

It didn’t just represent establishing order but truly comprehending what order was!

At this moment, the woman’s words hadn’t just failed to crush his mental state, it had allowed him to firm his convictions!

The woman looked down from above. She just gazed at him for a long time before she smiled, “The Sword Dao of Order. Interesting indeed.”

Yang Ye looked right at her, “Why don’t you try an attack of mine?”

Take an attack of his!

He spoke very calmly, but it contained a strand of confidence.

Monarch Yan glanced at Yang Ye with a rather complicated expression on his face. In the past, he’d said something similar to her. At that time, he’d been confident like Yang Ye.

He felt that there was nothing in the world that he couldn’t overcome.

The facts proved that reality was much crueler than what one expected!

She looked down at Yang Ye while a faint smile appeared on her face, “An attack from you?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She smiled and nodded, “Alright!”

As soon as she finished speaking, an ethereal figure soundlessly took form above Yang Ye.

It was a clone of her!

Yang Ye frowned slightly because she still refused to use her main body against him!

She seemed to know what he was thinking and smiled, “It’s not because I look down on you… Oh, wait. Actually, I do, and that’s why my main body isn’t here. Go on, swing your sword!”

Yang Ye glanced at her and vanished on the spot.

A ray of sword energy flashed.

It was the Fate Sword Dao.

Decider of Fate!

The woman didn’t swing her sword. She just stretched out two fingers and clamped down.

The sword stopped!

Yang Ye’s sword stopped, and the sword energy he emanated instantly vanished.

There wasn’t much distance between Yang Ye and the woman, but his sword couldn’t move at all.

His sword technique, Decider of Fate, had been stopped by just two of her fingers!

However, there was no dejection in Yang Ye’s eyes. He twisted his right hand, and the sword shook while the woman’s grip on it seemed to loosen slightly.

She grinned before him and shook her fingers.

Bam!

Yang Ye was instantly blasted over 300m away!

Yang Ye looked down at his sword, and he saw that it had cracked open. If his blood wasn’t ceaselessly surging into it, the sword would have shattered by now!

The woman smiled, “Do you know why I could stop your attack with such ease?”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Because you’re strong!”

She smiled, “That’s just one of the reasons. As for the other, it’s because your Fate Sword Dao is still lacking. While you had the determination to decide our fate with one attack, it cannot compare to your mental state when truly facing a hopeless situation. When you truly feel like you have no chance to survive, the strength of that attack will truly be at its greatest, and only then will it be able to pose a tiny threat to me. As for now, while it is at its initial stages, it’s quite immature!”

She turned around and left.

But just a moment later, she stopped and gazed at Yang Ye, “How about using your Sword Dao of Order against me? Oh, that won’t do. While it has taken form, you haven’t learned how to use it.”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “With your strength, destroying the Three Dimensional Universe should be absolutely easy!”

She played with Justice between two fingers as she said, “I promised her that I wouldn’t destroy the Three Dimensional Universe with my own hands. I’m sure you understand that we sword cultivators cannot go against our hearts. Moreover, I really respect her.”

She gazed at Yang Ye’s stomach, “I’ll be booking that Sprite Progenitor.”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “I’ll slaughter anyone who touches her!”

The woman grinned, and then her figure gradually turned ethereal.

Monarch Yan suddenly said, “You can kill him!”

Based on her strength, she possessed the strength to annihilate Yang Ye without giving him any chances. Her strength was so formidable that even the joint forces of Yang Ye and Monarch Yan couldn’t resist her.

In this universe, the Dao came first, then the heavens.

Now, she had surpassed them both.

She glanced at Monarch Yan, “The saddest thing in this world is being unable to sense danger.”

Monarch Yan looked her in the eyes, “Many strong experts suffer in the end because they are conceited.”

She grinned, “You don’t understand how lonely it is!”

She’d vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto Monarch Yan, “Do you understand now?”

Monarch Yan, “You know… when I became the lord of the Four Dimensional Universe, I was like her too. I felt that nothing was a threat to me anymore. However, the facts of the current situation prove that I was just looking out of a well.”

He gazed at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, you can’t kill her!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “It doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter if I can kill her, the important thing is that I will try.”

Monarch Yan looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “If we weren’t on different sides, I would be willing to be friends with you. Unfortunately, one of us, and one of our universes are bound to vanish.”

As soon as he finished speaking, his body started to burn.

At this instant, the starry sky started to surge and ripple!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly.

At this moment, there was no Monarch Yan in his mind, only the scene of the woman stopping his sword.

He’d challenged her in order to seek defeat!

He’d attained the Sword Dao of Order, but just as she’d said, he didn’t really know how to utilize it. Moreover, he realized that his Fate Sword Dao had flaws. Because when he used it recently, it wasn’t as strong as it had been that day.

He'd challenged the woman so that he could locate those flaws in his Sword Dao!

And he’d found them!

The mental state he was in when he first utilized it and the mental state he was in now were completely different! A truly hopeless situation and an imagined one was completely different!Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The Fate Sword Dao depended on the mental state!

As for the Sword Dao of Order, he realized that he had no idea how to use it! Of course, he had gained something. He refused to try and create some kind of mental state!

He would just do as he should and not work hard on seeking out anything!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes because Monarch Yan was in front of him. He just watched Monarch Yan approach. A moment later, he drew his sword.

This attack was practically instinctive.

There was no determination to decide on their fate, and it was just an ordinary attack. Because Monarch Yan’s strength was utterly incapable of forcing him into a hopeless situation!

Bang!

However, it was such an ordinary attack that obliterated the fiery lightning around Monarch Yan and even blasted him over 30km away.

As his figure shot backward, space was obliterated in layers, and the destruction was spreading rapidly in all directions.

Once Monarch Yan stopped himself, he looked down at his stomach, and he saw a deep injury there. It had pierced through his stomach.

He pondered deeply for a moment and looked up at Yang Ye, “This attack of yours is better than before.”

It was natural!

It wasn’t as forced as it had been, and it was just an attack.

Return to simplicity!

Yang Ye glanced at his sword and took a step forward. He instantly arrived before Monarch Yan. The latter raised his hands, and then two bolts of fiery lightning surged out from his palms like volcanic eruptions.

Yang Ye still swung his sword as before. It was like a light breeze brushing by the face, or water flowing through the mountains… It was simple, casual, and natural.

A completely natural attack!

Hiss! Hiss!

The fiery lightning were sliced apart. At the same time, a sword shot out from Yang Ye’s waist and slashed at Monarch Yan. This time, the latter didn’t try to dodge it and raised his left hand to stop the sword. At the same time, his right hand carried a bolt of fiery lightning as it slammed at Yang Ye’s stomach.

Hiss!

Bam!

Yang Ye was blasted away, but Monarch Yan’s arm was split open at the center.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye gently pressed his left hand down, and his figure stopped immediately. He looked over to Monarch Yan, and he saw the latter’s hand had returned to normal!

At Monarch Yan’s level of cultivation, regrowing broken limbs was absolutely easy. Of course, it didn’t mean that he was completely unharmed. The attack had harmed him quite a bit.

Yang Ye glanced at the Three Dimensional Universe down below. At this moment, he’d lost his patience and didn’t want to let the battle drag on anymore.

Yang Ye moved his gaze back to Monarch Yan. Suddenly, the latter said, “Come! Let me see how strong your Fate Sword Dao, Demonic Sword Dao, and Sword Dao of Order are!”

As he spoke, he raised his right hand, and a pitch black lotus appeared on his palm.

Monarch Yan spoke softly, “This wasn’t prepared for you, but I really can’t do anything to you.”

The black lotus suddenly started spinning.
