Chapter 2115 – Let’s Go Deal with Some Fate!

At the moment Yang Ye left the Weapon Dimension, countless people couldn’t help but heave sighs of relief.

They were naturally aware that Yang Ye hadn’t left before this. The Weapon Path clearly didn’t want to continue creating conflict with a genius who could kill Sages. Even though the Weapon Path had more Sages and even stronger Sages, they couldn’t send those Sages to fight Yang Ye.

They would be going a little too far if they did that.

The Weapon Path and Dao Path weren’t at the point of fighting to the death.

Yet now that Yang Ye had left, the incident had come to an end. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Once he left the Weapon Path, Yang Ye saw the middle aged man, the guardian of the Weapon Dimension, at the entrance of the Weapon Dimension.

Yang Ye grinned, “I’m sorry to disappoint you. I’m alive!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished into the sky.

His next destination was the Buddhist Path!

Yang Ye didn’t go straight for the Buddhist Path, and he went to the prehistoric ruins instead.

As far as he was concerned, his visits to the three paths weren’t that urgent. In any case, the Dao Path didn’t give him a time limit, and what he needed most right now was to improve his strength.

He’d traveled to the prehistoric ruins to seek guidance about some things.

As soon as he entered the ruins, he saw the casket.

“Congratulations!” The voice came from the casket, “You’ve attained the Major Zen Realm, and your strength has arrived at a new height.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “I’m sure my strength is nothing to you!”

“Not at all!” The voice continued, “While we’re not weak, we aren’t as strong as you think.”

Yang Ye smiled and said, “I’ll be direct. I’m here because I’m here to seek guidance from you about how to utilize the energy of the five elements. I wonder if you’re willing to teach me!”

The mysterious expert in the casket possessed absolutely terrifying skill when it came to the utilization of the five elements, but his ability in that aspect was quite weak. This weakness caused him to be unable to fully bring forth the strength of his newly-created sword technique!

The mysterious expert fell silent for quite some time before saying, “Looks like you’re truly become enlightened.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

The mysterious person replied, “A person’s potential is boundless, but energy is limited. When our energy cannot be improved further, we must learn how to ‘rely’. Rely on all the other types of energy which we can use. As for how to rely on it and how to use it, that’s another problem.”

The mysterious person paused for a moment and continued, “Actually, Sprites, Sprite Kings, and Sprite Lords are the best at utilizing the energy of the world.”

Sprite Lords!

Yang Ye immediately thought of Snowy. Seek guidance from Snowy?

Such a thought had only just appeared in his mind when Yang Ye rejected it. Snowy hated cultivating, and she didn’t have a clear understanding of her own abilities. At most times, she just used her abilities by instinct.

Simply speaking, she would only think about eating when she was hungry, and she didn’t know what eating was when she wasn’t hungry. So, even if she could use the energy of the world, it was out of instinct, and she would definitely give him a bewildered expression on her face if he asked her how she did it.

Meanwhile, the mysterious expert added, “My race especially sought guidance from some Sprite Lords to find out how to control the energy of all things. So, we do have quite a bit of experience when it comes to this.”

Yang Ye glanced at the casket, “Do you have conditions?”

The mysterious expert replied, “I do. However, you can’t fulfill them now. If you’re willing, you can promise that you’ll help me with something in the future.”

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

The mysterious expert replied, “It’s meaningless to tell you now. In short, if you think it’s beyond your ability, you can refuse to help. Alright?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I don’t have a reason to refuse, right?”

The mysterious expert replied, “Then it’s a deal!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright!”

The mysterious expert said, “All things have a spirit of their own. So, if you want to borrow their strength, you must first learn ‘spirit merging’. ‘Spirit merging’ is merging into them. There’s a huge difference between forcefully relying on their energy and them willingly assisting you. It would probably be very difficult for anyone else to achieve ‘spirit merging’, but it isn’t difficult for you. You have a natural advantage because you have a Sprite Lord. Spirit merging is absolutely simple for you while you have her help!”

Snowy!

Yang Ye asked, “What should I do?”

The mysterious expert didn’t say anything in response. Meanwhile, the scene before Yang Ye’s eyes suddenly changed. A moment later, he’d arrived in a gray world.

This world had violent winds, rainstorms, lightning, tsunamis, the five elements… In short, all sorts of natural forces and energies could be found here. Actually, these forces weren’t very terrifying to experts at Yang Ye’s level. Of course, his goal was to learn how to use these forces and fuse them into his sword, so that the strength of his attacks could be fully displayed!

As the mysterious expert provided him with guidance, Yang Ye had more and more admiration for the people from the prehistoric times.

A streamlined system!

The prehistoric experts had a standard set of methods for every type of energy. If there were methods available, then learning them was only a matter of time. If it was anyone else, it may take a very long time to fully learn, but Yang Ye didn’t take that long. Why? Because he had Snowy by his side. Those various types of energy didn’t reject him at all, and it was even to the extent that they took the initiative to get close to him once Snowy appeared by his side!

So, Yang Ye could be said to have truly benefited from Snowy’s presence.

Time trickled by. Under the mysterious expert’s guidance and Snowy’s help, Yang Ye’s ability to use the energy of all things was advancing by leaps and bounds. Yang Ye wasn’t the only one who was growing, Snowy had grown tremendously as well.

Presently, even a Major Zen Realm would find her impossible to kill. No, she had the strength to kill a Major Zen Realm expert on her own.

According to the mysterious expert, if Snowy was willing to cultivate, then so long as she cultivated seriously, she was entirely capable of being on par with a Sage. Unfortunately, Snowy wasn’t willing to cultivate. Yang Ye was the main reason she was cultivating right now. As far as she was concerned, cultivating with Yang Ye was playing with Yang Ye. So, she was willing to cultivate. But she would go mad if she was asked to cultivate on her own.

Just like that, a month passed by. Under the guidance of the mysterious expert, Yang Ye’s had undergone a complete qualitative transformation from inside out.

In the gray world, Yang Ye sat cross-legged on a huge rock, and Judgment was in front of him.

Yang Ye’s eyes were closed, and he was in a meditative state.

On his shoulder, Snowy had her eyes closed too, and she was imitating Yang Ye. However, she opened her eyes and snuck a peek at Yang Ye from time to time.

A long time later, Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes. At the instant he did that, Judgment suddenly shook violently, and then a ray of light vanished into the sky.

Bang!

Something exploded apart.

The ethereal world collapsed!

Yang Ye opened his eyes in the hall.

Meanwhile, the mysterious expert said, “That attack wasn’t bad!”

Yang Ye grinned, “I think it isn’t bad too!”

The mysterious expert said, “It just lacks some things. However, those things aren’t things that you can grasp right now. You need to go through a process of growth!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Thank you for your guidance.”

The mysterious expert said, “If you don’t mind, you can leave that Sprite Lord here with me. In just a year, she’ll undergo a tremendous change. As for staying with you… Allow me to be honest, it’s a little waste of her talent. Sprite Lords shouldn’t just be there to be cute!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Yang Ye hadn’t even said anything when Snowy raised her paws and waved them dismissively at the casket.

She refused!

She’d refused decisively!

Snowy gazed at Yang Ye and displayed that she would absolutely not stay.

This damnable place wasn’t fun at all!

Yang Ye smiled, and then he gazed at the casket, “Snowy and I appreciate your good intentions. But I’m sure you’ve noticed that she wants to stay with me.”

The mysterious expert said, “You’re truly extraordinary to be able to make a Sprite Lord stick with you like this. No one in my race has ever been able to accomplish that.”

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head and smiled. After that, he gazed at the casket, “Senior, how about we do this? I’ll frequently bring Snowy back here to cultivate, then you can guide her, and you can guide me!”

The mysterious expert replied, “Alright!”

Yang Ye was naturally happy that the mysterious expert hadn’t refused. He didn’t know how strong this prehistoric expert was, but he knew the mysterious expert in the casket was definitely very strong. Since the expert was willing to provide guidance to them, it was a very, very good thing for both Snowy and him.

Snowy didn’t care at all. She really didn’t care about growing stronger because having fun was most important to her.

Yang Ye cupped his fist in the direction of the casket, “Thank you. Senior, I have many other things to deal with, so I’ll be bidding my farewells now!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye took Snowy in his arms and left.

Snowy glanced at the casket, and her eyes were scanning the surroundings. She seemed to be planning something. Meanwhile, Yang Ye patted her on the head and glared at her.

As soon as she started doing that, Yang Ye knew what she was planning.

Snowy pointed at the casket and blinked.

It’s a treasure!

That was what she was telling him!

Yang Ye patted her on the head, “You can’t think about that even if it is a treasure. Understand?”

Snowy started waving her claws about to display that it was a great treasure!

Yang Ye pinched Snowy, “Let’s go take treasures from somewhere else, alright?”

Snowy’s eyes lit up and seemed to be asking—Where?

A smile curled up on Yang Ye’s lips, “The Buddhist Path. I heard those baldies have lots of treasures. Let’s go deal with some fate.”

The Buddhist Path!
