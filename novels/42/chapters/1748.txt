Chapter 1749 - Kill Him!

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s sword started to move.

Everyone watched as Yang Xiao’s arms and legs were chopped off. After that, two black swords nailed Yang Xiao’s limbless body to the ground.

“How dare you!” Some of the True Realm experts on Yang Xiao’s side immediately charged at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at them, and then the head of the True Realm expert at the front of the group flew up into the air.

That True Realm expert was merely at the 1st stage, so he couldn’t resist Yang Ye’s Split Second at all!

Once they saw Yang Ye kill another True Realm expert in an instant, the others stopped and didn’t dare step forward.

Meanwhile, the Ku Clan and Ying Clan’s experts had stopped.

Even Yang Xiao had fallen into Yang Ye’s hands, so they would naturally not continue fighting. Because at this moment, Yang Xiao had lost the ability to fulfil his promise to them!

Unless they saved Yang Xiao!

However, unless Yang Ye willingly released Yang Xiao, no one here could save Yang Xiao from Yang Ye.

Because it would only take an instant for Yang Ye to kill Yang Xiao right now!

Yang Xiao didn’t reveal any fear as he gazed at Yang Ye who stood before him, “Yang Ye, don’t you care a lot about your loved ones? Haha! I really want to see how you’ll look when you get back to Merak System and see your women, daughter, and sister are dead. It’ll definitely be a magnificent sight! Hahaha!”

“How sad!” Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang spoke abruptly, “Yang Xiao, in life, winning should be accomplished in an upright manner; and a loss should be accepted openly. I thought you were a prominent figure, but now it would seem like you’re worse than a dog.”

A prominent figure!

It was alright to stop at nothing to accomplish one’s objective, but there should be limits. At the very least, when one loses, one shouldn’t threaten their opponent’s family to feel happy about themselves. Such people were incompetent!

It was like the keyboard warriors of the world. They were incompetent. They couldn’t see a better side of the world, so they were eternally stuck in their narrow view of the world. The success of others incurred their curses, the wealth of others incurred their curses as well.

Such people cursed others to feel happy about themselves.

But in actuality, they were the most useless and most pitiable.

At this moment, Yang Xiao wasn’t able to defeat his opponent, so he was using such a method to feel happy about himself!

He was pitiable and useless!

Yang Xiao’s expression turned extremely unsightly when he heard Yang Lianshuang. Because it had struck right at his heart!

He felt embarrassed!

Such embarrassment felt like doing something despicable and being exposed in public!

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang gazed at Yang Ye, “Give him a swift death!”

“A swift death?” A fierce smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “That’ll be letting him off too easy!”

He gazed at Yang Xiao and continued, “Do you know what it’s like to be skinned? You definitely don’t. But don’t worry, you’ll find out very soon. I’ll slice it off in layers, just like removing the skin of a fruit. I’ll slice off a thousand layers. It’s definitely possible with my skill with the sword!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye started.

Just like that, everyone watched as Yang Ye started skinning Yang Xiao.

…

Meanwhile, far away in Merak System. At this moment, two unwelcome guests had arrived at Merak System.

They wore black robes, and they held sabers in their hands. They were two of the Yang Clan’s Sentinel Guard.

“This is Merak System?” The black robed old man on the left suddenly said, “As expected of a low level stellar system. It isn’t just small, the spirit energy here is so scarce too.”

The black robed old man on the right said, “The people here are even weaker!”

The old man on the left nodded slightly and said, “Do you think the patriarch has dealt with Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang?”

The old man on the right spoke indifferently, “He wouldn’t have acted if he wasn’t certain. Since he has, he’s definitely confident in his ability to deal with them. So, we just have to slaughter the people of this system and report back!”

The old man on the left nodded slightly, “True!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took a step forward, and then a terrifying aura swept out from within him. The aura slammed down towards Sky Sky Continent. However, the aura hadn’t even been able to get close to Sky Sky Continent before it vanished into thin air.

At this moment, their expressions changed.

They looked towards the distance, and they saw a person there. Their expressions changed drastically when they saw that person.

One of the old men cried out involuntarily, “How… how could it possibly be you…?”

Suddenly, a ray of cold light flashed.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Their bodies instantly stiffened on the spot, and then their bodies were sliced into a few thousand pieces.

The surroundings became calm once more!

At this moment, an absolutely bloody scene was playing out in the city. Yang Xiao was nailed to the ground, and Yang Ye was ceaselessly skinning Yang Xiao. Every single swing of Yang Ye’s sword would cause a layer of Yang Xiao’s skin to fall off, but it was an extremely thin layer that was practically translucent!

Death by a thousand cuts!

Actually, it couldn’t even be called that because it was much more terrifying than that!

No one here stopped Yang Ye. Yang Xiao’s subordinates did desire to save Yang Xiao, but they didn’t dare to do anything. After all, besides Yang Ye, Yang Lianshuang was here too.

If they attacked, they would definitely die.

Yang Lianshuang glanced at Yang Ye and didn’t stop him. Anyone could discern that Yang Ye was on the verge of going berserk. If she were to stop him now, she would incur his hatred. Even though she didn’t fear him, she didn’t want to become enemies with Yang Ye just for Yang Xiao.

As for the Ying Clan and Ku Clan, they would definitely not stop him.

At this moment, Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang were in control of the entire situation, so attacking wouldn’t make any difference.

No one stopped him, so Yang Ye just sliced off Yang Xiao’s skin, bit by bit.

Yang Xiao was quite unyielding. During this entire process, he didn’t beg for mercy or let out a single shrill cry. After all, he was someone in a position of superiority, so he had some backbone.

It didn’t take long for Yang Xiao’s appearance to become beyond horrifying, and it could be said that besides his eyes, there wasn’t a single whole part throughout Yang Xiao’s body.

It was bloody and horrifying!

The Ying Clan and Ku Clan’s experts stared at Yang Ye. Their eyes were filled with fear, and besides fear, there was a trace of terror!

Ruthless!

Yang Ye was too ruthless!

When facing someone like Yang Ye, one had to either kill him immediately, so he had no chance to make a comeback; or don’t become enemies with him! Otherwise, once he was given an opportunity, he would definitely take revenge like a madman.

Yang Ye was about to swing his sword again when the expressions of everyone here changed. A moment later, Yang Ye was blasted away, and he flew almost 10km before he finally stopped. A trace of blood immediately seeped out from the corner of his mouth when he stopped himself.

Everyone looked towards the distance. An old man had suddenly appeared there.

Many people here were stunned when they saw the old man.

Even the experts of the Yang Clan were stunned, and their eyes were filled with bewilderment.

Who’s that?

Suddenly, the leader of the Council of Elders, Yang Lin, suddenly cried out involuntarily, “Uncle Xiang! You’re Uncle Xiang!”

Uncle Xiang!

Yang Xiang!

The expressions of the experts from the Ku Clan and Yang Clan changed when they heard this. Besides them, Yang Lianshuang’s face had turned slightly gloomy as well.

Yang Xiang!

One of the two 6th stage True Realm experts of the Yang Clan!

Even though many people in Milky Way System didn’t know Yang Xiang’s name, his name was renowned throughout the medium universe a thousand years ago.

However, once he entered into closed door cultivation, news of him gradually vanished from the medium universe, and that was why many people in the Yang Clan didn’t recognize him now.

Yang Xiang wore a linen robe. His hair was snow white, and his face was covered in wrinkles. He seemed like an old man at the end of his life.

Yang Xiang glanced at Yang Xiao and said, “I said that unless it’s a moment of life and death for the Yang Clan, you should never disturb me.”

Yang Lianshuang glanced at Yang Xiao. Obviously, Yang Xiao had somehow summoned Yang Xiang.

Yang Xiao wanted to say something, but he wasn’t able to spear a single word right now. Because he didn’t have a mouth anymore! Not only did he lack a mouth, even his tongue had been cut off!

Meanwhile, Yang Lin hurriedly went over to Yang Xiang and told Yang Xiang what had happened here.

A long time passed before Yang Xiang gazed at Yang Xiao, “Trash! You actually weren’t able to deal with two juniors, and you even got help from outsiders! You really deserve death! As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand.

Bang!

Yang Xiao’s body exploded apart.

Yang Xiao was no more!

After he obliterated Yang Xiao, he gazed at Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang, “A kingdom has its laws, and a family has its rules. Even though you’re both members of my Yang Clan, you’ve gone against your superiors and thought you can overturn the Yang Clan! Your crimes deserve death!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand, and a terrifying aura instantly swept towards Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang.

Yang Lianshuang fell silent for a moment, and then she gazed at Yang Ye. Yang Ye had looked at her as well.

Their gazes met for a moment, and then Yang Lianshuang said, “Kill him!”

As soon as she finished speaking, her hair instantly turned ink black. It wasn’t just her hair that had turned ink black, even her eyes had turned ink black. Besides that, her hands had actually transformed into a pair of pitch black claws.
