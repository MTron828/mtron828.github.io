Chapter 1806 – Undying!

Needless to say, Yang Ye was almost killed. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The Divine Yin Flame hadn’t held back at all, so the temperature of the flames almost incinerated Yang Ye completely. Fortunately, at the critical moment, he activated the blood armor that he got from the woman in a red dress. He would have died without it.

Even then, the armor had almost been unable to stop the Divine Yin Flame!

In the cultivation room, Yang Ye laid weakly on the ground, and his entire body was burnt.

Yang Ye opened his eyes and glanced at the Divine Yin Flame, “Don’t do that again.”

The Divine Yin Flame was quite embarrassed, “I misunderstood. Er… are you alright?”

Yang Ye spoke angrily, “Do you think I’m alright?”

The Divine Yin Flame was at a loss for words.

Around two hours later, Yang Ye’s body recovered to normal with the help of the Primordial Violet Energy. After that, he was immediately enveloped by the Divine Yin Flame again.

It didn’t take long for his face to gradually warp.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing’s voice resounded in his mind, “Calm your heart, recite the mental cultivation method, and circulate the flames through your meridians.”

Yang Ye hurriedly focused and did as Hou Qing said.

A month passed like this.

During this period, tremendous changes had occurred throughout the medium universe. At this moment, only three of the eight clans remained.

The Ying Clan, Wang Clan, Li Clan, Qin Clan, and Lu Clans had vanished from the medium universe.

Presently, the Wu Clan was undoubtedly the strongest amongst the powers that remained out in the open. Because the Wu Clan had taken the worlds belonging to all the five clans. As for the Yang Clan, it had silently vanished from public view.

As for the Ku Clan, it didn’t do anything until now.

Time trickled by, and another month passed in the blink of an eye.

As for the time in the Primordial Pagoda, almost two years had passed now.

Yang Ye was still enveloped in flames within the cultivation room, and both Hou Qing and the smaller version of Qiong Qi were by his side.

Qiong Qi suddenly asked, “How’s he doing?”

Hou Qing glanced at Yang Ye and said, “His mind is so strong that it’s truly rare to come by.”

Qiong Qi asked, “What do you mean?”

Hou Qing explained, “I thought he wouldn’t be able to endure it. But I never expected him to endure it until now. This fellow is absolutely ruthless to himself!”

Qiong Qi nodded slightly and said, “If I’m being honest, this kid’s natural talent isn’t very good. But he has something that many other geniuses don’t, and that’s his ruthlessness. He’s ruthless to others, but he’s even more ruthless to himself.”

Hou Qing said, “As far as many are concerned, natural talent is the most important, but that’s not true. No matter how great one’s natural talent is, if one doesn’t possess sufficient willpower and a strong mind, that person will become ordinary, sooner or later. Conversely, even if one’s natural talent isn’t good, but if one is willing to work hard, persist, and be ruthless to oneself, then that person’s future accomplishments will definitely be extraordinary!”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “This kid is a person like that, and he possesses great fortune. I truly can’t imagine the level he’ll grow into!”

Qiong Qi replied, “Let’s wait and see!”

Around two hours later, the Divine Yin Flame around Yang Ye suddenly started to disperse, and then Yang Ye’s figure gradually appeared before them.

Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye opened his eyes slowly, and then he stood up. His clothes had been turned into ash. He looked down at his body, and he noticed that his skin was bronze.

Yang Ye remained silent for an instant before he recited the mental cultivation technique. In an instant, faint golden light emerged from all over his body!

The Peerless Hegemon!

After almost two years of bitter cultivation, he’d finally attained the 1st level of the Undying Hegemon technique. Now, he was entirely capable of using just physical strength against 6th stage True Realm experts. Of course, it didn’t represent that he was invincible.

For example, he absolutely didn’t dare to use his body to go head-on against the woman in a red dress from Moment Mountain. Besides her, Ying Jing’s clone was extremely strong as well. In short, he didn’t have to worry about ordinary 6th stage True Realm experts.

“Your foundation isn’t bad at all!” Meanwhile, Hou Qing spoke abruptly, “It’s truly rare for a human to improve their body to such a level.”

Yang Ye smiled. He’d suffered a tremendous amount of torture to cultivate his body to such a level! Fortunately, while he had suffered that much torture, his body had grown strong.

In the past, his body had been his greatest trump card!

Hou Qing suddenly said, “Right. Kid, I almost forgot. If you go to the large universe, it’s best if you don’t use the Undying Hegemon technique in front of humans. Otherwise, you’ll be in big trouble.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

“Because the human race and shaman race don’t have a good relationship!” Qiong Qi spoke abruptly, “Or I should say that they’re hostile towards each other. If you allow the human race to find out that you’ve cultivated a technique of the shaman race, you’ll definitely be in huge trouble. However, you probably wouldn’t care!”

Yang Ye grinned, and then he gazed at Hou Qing, “No matter what, thank you.”

Hou Qing shook his head, “There’s no need for that. I had no other choice anyway.”

Unless Yang Ye willingly allowed him to leave, he couldn’t escape the pagoda, even if his strength returned to its peak. As soon as he entered the pagoda, he was bound to suffer a miserable fate!

After talking with Qiong Qi and Hou Qing for a while, Yang Ye wore a new set of clothes and left the pagoda.

At this moment, he was in the Ying Clan. Or it should be said that he was at the Wu Clan.

As soon as he returned to the outside world, the space before him shook, and then a woman appeared in front of him. It was Yang Lianshuang.

She sized up Yang Ye and said, “You’ve grown stronger again!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Just a little!”

She glanced at the surroundings, “Come with me!”

Yang Ye nodded.

It didn’t take long for them to leave Heaven Desolation System.

Heaven Void Continent.

Yang Lianshuang brought Yang Ye to the old headquarters of the Yang Clan. Even though she hadn’t taken back the worlds that once belonged to the Yang Clan, the Wu Clan didn’t take the Yang Clan’s worlds. Wu Ye knew the limits he shouldn’t cross.

Yang Lianshuang said, “What are your thoughts about the Yang Clan’s future?”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “What are you trying to say?”

She glanced at the continent below them and said, “The Yang Clan can’t keep up with our footsteps. Once I leave, if no new outstanding genius appears in the Yang Clan, yet they possess treasures that don’t conform to their strength, it’ll bring calamity to them!”

She shook her head and continued, “The Yang Clan needs to rest and recuperate. It needs to accumulate its strength. We’ve obtained the cultivation techniques and combat techniques of the five clans, so if we keep a low profile and develop for a few dozen years, the Yang Clan’s strength will definitely surpass the Wu Clan and Ku Clan.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand what you mean.”

Both of them would leave in the end. Once they did leave, the Yang Clan’s apocalypse might arrive. Needless to say, Yang Ye admired Yang Lianshuang quite a bit. She had courage. She was able to just give up on so many worlds, and that was something that ordinary people wouldn’t be able to do!

Yang Lianshuang chuckled, “Alright, let’s head back!”

She vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye glanced at the continent below and vanished on the spot.

The ancient city.

Once he returned, Yang Ye didn’t cultivate. He accompanied Su Qingshi and the others instead. He’d neglected them a little lately.

Actually, he really wanted to put them all in the Primordial Pagoda, but he didn’t do that in the end. Because it wasn’t the safest place.

Or to be more precise, staying by his side was very dangerous. He’d practically never stopped encountering danger all along the way. Moreover, if Su Qingshi and the others lived in the Primordial Pagoda, they would be able to sense everything he encountered.

He didn’t want them to live a life full of worry!

Night.

At the back of the city, Yang Ye stood on the top of a mountain, and Nether Maiden was by his side.

They just stood there.

A long time passed before Yang Ye suddenly gazed at her, “Thank you for helping.”

The Yang Clan wouldn’t have been able to defeat the Ying Clan’s coalition without Nether Maiden and the others’ help.

Nether Maiden shook her head slightly, “It was nothing.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Right, you said that you needed my help? What is it?”

She fell silent for a long time before she replied, “Actually, we might not need it.”

Yang Ye asked, “What do you mean?”

Nether Maiden replied, “Our goal is Pavilion master Siyou. If she has gone to the large universe, then we will go up there too. But our current strength is clearly insufficient to accomplish that. So, we need to use your wooden sword. We’ll have a better chance of succeeding with it.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “If she isn’t in the large universe, then we’ll continue our search in the medium universe. However, we’ll go up there sooner or later. After all, everyone strives to go higher and further!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I see.”

Meanwhile, Nether Maiden said, “When can you leave?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Three days from now. I have to deal with some matters here.”

Nether Maiden nodded, “Alright, we’ll wait for you!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Yang Lianshuang suddenly appeared before him.

She had a solemn expression on her face, “We have a problem.”

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

Yang Lianshuang spoke solemnly, “Many people from Heaven Pillar Mountain are looking for you!”

Heaven Pillar Mountain!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “So they’re here….”
