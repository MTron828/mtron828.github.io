Chapter 2363 – A True Heart Leads to an Invincible Sword!

Snowy was visibly stunned.

As for Yang Ye and Sword Scroll, they were beyond shocked!

Who was this man?

The Primordial Axe of Creation and the Primordial Pagoda weren’t much to him?

They were treasures that countless went mad to obtain!

But they weren’t much to him!

Both Yang Ye and Sword Scroll didn’t think that he was exaggerating. It wasn’t necessary. Moreover, the man didn’t just possess Eternal Energy, he had a Primal True Dragon!

A person like him would disdain to lie!

Meanwhile, the middle aged man continued, “Actually, I’m not very interested in all of you. If it wasn’t for this little fellow, you wouldn’t have gotten here. However, I’m a little interested in all of you now.”

Yang Ye said, “Please be frank, Senior.”

The man replied, “I’ve lived for very, very long. So long that even I’ve forgotten how long it has been. I don’t think your arrival here is a coincidence. I don’t care who set this all up, but if someone included me in their schemes, I have to do something.”

Suddenly, a pitch black sword sheath appeared before Yang Ye.

It was over 1m long, and it was very simple. It looked like an ordinary sword sheath.

Yang Ye gazed at the man but didn’t take the sheath. He said, “According to what you’ve said, someone is controlling our lives? Or perhaps, someone is controlling everything?”

The man replied with a question, “Who isn’t?”

Yang Ye frowned, and the man continued, “Shrink your concept of the world and take a look at it. Who do you think controls the destiny of the fish in a pond? Or look at it at a larger scale. Who controls the destiny of the commoners in a kingdom? How are you so sure that you’re not one of the fish in the pond?”

He paused for a moment at this point and continued, “The stronger you get, the stronger you’ll sense some inconceivable existences. I’m sure you’ve heard of destiny. You’re probably unable to come into contact with that level right now, but as you grow stronger, you’ll realize that some things may be impossible to touch or see, but it doesn’t mean they do not exist. Of course, nothing is absolute, and it may just be my mistake. However, it’s not important, isn’t it?”

Yang Ye glanced at the man and said, “You’re overthinking it.”

“Huh?”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, “Why think so much about the future? What’s most important is treading my current path well. As for destiny, I think I should just do my best and let the heavens decide. What do you think?”

“Interesting!” There was slight amusement in his voice, “Those words make you worthy of this sheath. As for whether you’re worthy of its sword, it depends on whether your words were sincere.”

Yang Ye glanced at the sheath and asked, “Where’s its sword?”

The man replied, “Look for it on your own!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The man continued, “Let me ask you something very common. Why do you cultivate the sword?”

Yang Ye replied, ‘It can kill and protect.”

“Haha!” The man suddenly roared with laughter.

Sword Scroll pulled on Yang Ye’s sleeve. The latter nodded slightly and gazed at the man, “Senior, I’ll be taking my leave now.”

He took Snowy in his arms, and then took Wang Erya’s hand and walked toward the exit.

Suddenly, the man’s voice resounded from behind him, “Let me give you a piece of advice. A true heart leads to an invincible sword.”

A true heart leads to an invincible sword!

Yang Ye’s figure stopped for a moment, and he said, “Thank you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he left the palace with the others.

Only the man remained here.

The man suddenly started laughing, and as he laughed, two streams of tears seeped out from his eyes.

The tears would not stop!

In the past, a child and an old man once had a conversation like this:

“Kid, why do you cultivate the sword?”

“I can protect my father and mother!” He hesitated for a moment and added, “And the girl I like!”

“Alright, then from now onward, I, Jian Wudi, take you as my disciple.”

Countless years later.

The child wasn’t a child anymore. He was one of the strongest people in the world. He arrived at the ends of the sky, and his eyes were filled with confidence. He was absolutely confident that he could enter the door which no one had ever succeeded at entering. Because he was really very strong!

He stopped, and a voice came from there, “Is the sword more important, or is your mother, father, and the girl you like who are more important?”

The man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Are you trying to spoil my mental state?”

The voice fell silent for a long time before it said, “Draw their appearance for me and I’ll let you through!”

The man was stunned.

Their appearance?

Their appearance?

Mother and father’s appearance? The appearance of my beloved Dao Companion?

The man was stunned on the spot, and then his hands and body started to tremble.

His parents and beloved had died a long, long time ago. When had they died? How had they died? It had been too, too long to the point he’d forgotten, he’d even forgotten their appearances.

The sword was the only thing in his world!

However, he still remembered something, and it was that he’d abandoned everything for the sword.

Including everything he wanted to protect!

Because they had become burdens to his Sword Dao.

He severed everything that stood in his path!

Bonds? Friendship? Love?

They were nothing before the path of eternal life!

The middle aged man was still laughing in the palace, but as he laughed, he cried, and as he cried, he laughed.

…

Yang Ye and Sword Scroll left the underground palace and arrived back above ground. Yang Ye gazed at Sword Scroll, “What is it?”

It was Sword Scroll who’d pulled him out of there just now.

She spoke solemnly, “He’s absolutely not ordinary, and he aroused horror within me!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t think too much about it. If he had ill intent, we wouldn’t have been able to fight back at all, right? As for what he gave us, even if he has some ulterior motives, who cares? In any case, we just have to do what we should do.”

She glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Nothing troubles you.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Not at all. It’s just that I have no other choice.

Sword Scroll fell silent.

Just as Yang Ye had said, no matter what the man wanted, they had no choice. Because they couldn’t just return the Eternal Energy and Dragon Ball, right? In any case, it was all something for the future!

A short while later, Sword Scroll glanced at the surroundings and said, “I want to move the entire Northern Sword Sect into the Primordial Pagoda. What do you think?”

Yang Ye asked, “What’s the point of that?”

She replied, “We can create our own organization, a true power. Trust me, we can build a formidable organization within the Primordial Pagoda, and we’ll prioritize quality over quantity.”

An organization!

Yang Ye was immediately interested. Sky Maiden and the others possessed extremely good natural talent, so he could gather all of these talented people together, and coupled with the Primordial Violet Energy within the Primordial Pagoda, Snowy’s presence, and that cultivation room, their speed of cultivation would multiply.

Besides that, he could recruit some formidable demon beasts. After all, they would definitely be willing to join him since he had Snowy by his side.

Sword Scroll immediately summoned Oxxy when she saw that Yang Ye had no objections!

Move the Northern Sword Sect!

No one was managing this place now, and no one wanted it. After all, practically all the treasures here had been taken.

So, it didn’t take long for Oxxy to move the entire Northern Sword Sect into the Primordial Pagoda.

Meanwhile, Su Qingshi and the others started making arrangements within the pagoda, and Sword Scroll joined them. After all, she had to study those sword formations. Thus, only Yang Ye, Snowy, and Wang Erya remained outside. As for Oxxy, it was acting as a laborer and obeying the orders of Su Qingshi and the others.

The Primal True Dragon, on the other hand, was wandering around the pagoda, and it was very satisfied with this place.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye looked toward the right, and there was a middle aged man there. Besides that, there were two men and a woman there too. It was the same group of three Yang Ye had met earlier.

Yang Ye’s gaze stopped on the middle aged man because he was actually a Limitbreaker Realm expert!

The Limitbreaker Realm!

While he didn’t fear such experts now, he couldn’t underestimate them or act carelessly against them.

When he saw Yang Ye look in his direction, the middle aged man nodded at Yang Ye, and then he walked over, “I’m the patriarch of the Southern City’s Li Clan, Li Xianyan. I was once an elder of the Northern Sword Sect.”

Yang Ye nodded and waited for him to continue.

Li Xianyan hesitated for a moment and gazed at Snowy, “Young Brother, is she a Sprite Progenitor?”

A Sprite Progenitor!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Why?”

Li Xianyan couldn’t help but clench his fists when he heard Yang Ye, and then he said, “Can you give her to me?”

Give her to him!

Yang Ye chuckled, “That sword told you about her, right?”

Li Xianyan replied, “You don’t have the strength to protect her. If you’re willing to give her to my Li Clan, you can ask for anything from us.”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, “I refuse!”

Li Xianyan’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then a powerful wave of pressure pressed down upon Yang Ye.

The pressure of the Limitbreaker Realm!

Once the powerful pressure appeared, the space here warped. Because it couldn’t endure the pressure at all. However, Yang Ye was completely unaffected by it.

Li Xianyan frowned from the sight of this. He realized that the young man was much stronger than he’d expected!

Li Xianyan was about to attack when a sword suddenly appeared before him, and it trembled violently before transforming into a man.

It was the sword from the jade pendant!

The man glanced at Li Xianyan, “I made you come because I fought with your ancestor through life and death, and I thought that I should take care of the Li Clan a little, so I asked you to side with him. But I never expected you to try killing him and stealing from him. Are you an idiot?”

Li Xianyan glanced at the man and said, “Side with a True Void Realm cultivator? Are you sure you’re alright?”

The man gazed at Li Xianyan, “This is your last chance!”

“He doesn’t have one!” Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “I just happened to want to see if I can kill a Limitbreaker Realm expert.”

A sword howl resounded!
