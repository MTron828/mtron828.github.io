Chapter 1257 – You Wouldn’t Try To Repay Me With Your Body, Right?

A Voider!

What was a Voider!

It was equivalent to the top force in this world!

Yang Ye knew that Yun Banqing wouldn’t make irresponsible remarks, so he gazed at her to indicate that she should continue.

Yun Banqing said, “See that turret at the top? The method to forge that turret has been lost in this world. It can be said that our world isn’t capable of creating such a ship anymore. Even the Sword God’s Palace probably exhausted painstaking effort to create just one! Only the Sword God’s Palace was capable of creating one!”

Yang Ye walked over to it, stretched out his hand, and touched it. It felt icy cold to the touch. Yang Ye hesitated for a moment before slamming his fist forward.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded but the Void Cloud Shuttle didn’t move at all, but Yang Ye was pushed around 10m back instead.

Shock flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, “How strong! It can probably even resist the attacks of Voiders!”

Yun Banqing said, “Besides its shocking defensive capabilities, its offensive capabilities are absolutely terrifying as well. If you’re willing to use your violet crystals on it, then it’s actually equivalent to a Voider.”

“Let’s head in and take a look!” As soon as he finished speaking, both he and Yun Banqing leaped up into the Void Cloud Shuttle. It had a very level deck, the ground was covered in all sorts of mysterious symbols, and there was a control room at the center of the ship.

They walked into the control room. There were numerous buttons and a control panel in the control room. Yun Banqing pointed at the control panel and said, “This should be used for controlling its direction. As for the rest, I don’t really know much. However, I’ll be able to figure it out if I’m given some time.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Violet crystals aren’t a problem. If it really can pose a threat to Voiders, then it’ll be an immense help to us.”

She said, “Actually, there’s another use for it, and it’s to fly through space. Ordinary Imperial Cloud Shuttles can’t travel through space, but a Void Cloud Shuttle can.”

She suddenly turned to look at Yang Ye when she spoke up to this point, and then she continued, “Was what you told the black ape true?”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he understood what she meant. He immediately nodded, “It was true.”

She asked, “Are you really confident in being able to leave this world?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m not. But I have to give it a try!”

As he spoke, he grabbed Yun Banqing’s shoulder and leaped off the shuttle. After that, he waved his right hand and put it away. He said, “Let’s study it later. Now, let’s go look for that big fellow.”

Yun Banqing nodded, and they left the pavilion.

Outside the pavilion, Yang Ye stood there and gazed silently at the surroundings. No one knew what he was thinking.

“Actually, this place can be used as the Sword Alliance’s base of operations,” said Yun Banqing. While many areas here had been damaged, there were many whole areas as well. For example, the buildings here were built using special materials, so ordinary Emperors were utterly incapable of damaging them. Moreover, there were formidable formations protecting the space here. For example, even the battles between Yang Ye and the Voider from before or the battle with the black ape hadn’t damaged the space here. Even if it was slightly damaged, it was repaired in a moment.

In short, if the Sword Alliance’s headquarters was established here, then it would definitely be extremely beneficial because many things are already readily available here.

Yang Ye nodded as he’d had a similar thought. However, it was impossible right now. Why? Because of that mysterious expert....

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Let’s go!”

Yun Banqing nodded. They left Sword God’s Palace and headed out of the area. Because of his sword intent, the sword formations along the way were completely useless against them, and it didn’t take long for them to arrive at the area that was in ruins.

As they traveled through the area, the sound of battle resounded from afar. Yun Banqing gazed at Yang Ye, but Yang Ye shook his head, “There’s no need to pay any attention to them!”

As he spoke, he continued forward.

Yun Banqing followed him and said, “I thought you would want to head over and take a look!”

He replied, “Fighting here would be for no reason other than treasures or some sort of enmity. Regardless of which one it is, it has nothing to do with us.”

“Why did you help me on the shuttle here?” Yun Banqing asked, “I’ve been curious for a long time.”

Yang Ye said, “Because we’d become acquainted with each other, so I wasn’t able to stand by idly and watch you die.”

Yun Banqing glanced at him and lowered her head slightly, “If it wasn’t for you, the fate I would face.... You merely lifted a hand, in your opinion, but in my opinion, it’s a debt I’ll owe for eternity. I know that saying thank you is meaningless, so I....”

Yang Ye joked, “You wouldn’t try to repay me with your body, right?”

She was slightly stunned, and then she fell silent.

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “I was joking. To be honest, you don’t really have to care about that. In any case, you’ve joined the Sword Alliance, so you’re one of my own now. Since you’re on my side, there’s no need to be so courteous with me. If I need your help in the future, I won’t hold back as well!”

She nodded slightly, “Alright!”

Yang Ye smiled, and then he suddenly stopped moving. He looked towards an area of the ruins and said, “Do I have to make you show yourselves?”

A moment of silence ensued, and it didn’t take long for 2 middle aged men and a woman to appear before Yang Ye and Yun Banqing.

An Emperor and 2 Quasi Emperors.

A middle aged man in a black robe sized up Yang Ye and Yun Banqing before he asked, “Based on the direction both of you came from, you came from Sword God’s Palace, right?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The 3 of them exchanged glances, and then the black robed middle aged man said, “You can enter Sword God’s Palace now?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Indeed.” Because now that the Sword God’s Seal was gone, anyone could enter it now. However, it was pointless because he’d taken everything.

Meanwhile, Yun Banqing suddenly said, “Perhaps you’ll be able to find some treasures if you go now. We’re too weak and didn’t dare go too far.”

The middle aged man glanced at her and said, “You didn’t obtain any treasures?”

Yun Banqing nodded.

The middle aged man glanced at Yang Ye and Yun Banqing, “Leave your spatial rings behind and you can fuck off.”

Yun Banqing immediately shook her head upon hearing this. She’d only said that because she wanted them to leave as soon as possible. She could be considered to be giving them a chance to live. Unfortunately, they didn’t appreciate her kind intentions.

Yang Ye gazed at the middle aged man and asked, “Are you sure you want our spatial rings?”

The middle aged man replied, “You don’t want to fuck off?”

Yang Ye chuckled. A moment later, a ray of light flashed, and then Yang Ye appeared behind the middle aged man while the middle aged man’s figure stiffened.

It didn’t take long for a strand of blood to spray out from the center of his forehead. Yang Ye waved his right hand and put the corpse away. While he couldn’t refine more Sword Servants now, he could do it once his strength improved.

The other man and woman were stunned when they saw the middle aged man being killed in an instant. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Yang Ye paid no attention to them. He gazed at Yun Banqing and said, “Let’s go!”

She nodded and walked off with Yang Ye. It didn’t take long for them to vanish from the man and woman’s fields of vision.

Once Yang Ye and Yun Banqing left, the woman’s voice trembled as she spoke, “He... he’s a sword cultivator.”

The man nodded, “He is.... I never expected a sword cultivator to actually come here. He was so young yet was actually able to kill an Emperor in an instant. That....”

When he spoke up to this point, both the man and woman’s eyes opened wide at the same time.

“He’s the Sword Alliance’s master, Yang Ye!”

“He’s the Sword Alliance’s master, Yang Ye!”

They spoke simultaneously.

They looked at each other for a long time before the woman took a deep breath, and shock filled her eyes as she said, “He’s definitely Yang Ye! He definitely is! Otherwise, there’s no other young sword cultivator who’s that strong!”

The man nodded with a solemn expression on his face, “He definitely is!”

The woman’s eyes were still filled with shock, “He actually dared to come here....”

Meanwhile, the man suddenly said, “Remember that we should act like we never saw him!”

She was puzzled, “Why?”

He spoke solemnly, “The Sword Alliance is extremely influential throughout the continent, and Yang Ye is so terrifying. He came here in secret, so if we are to spread the news of his presence here.... What if it displeases him? Do you think we would be able to live?”

She nodded solemnly, “I understand!”

The man glanced at the surroundings and said, “I’d thought we’d found someone to rely on, but I never expected that he would be instantly annihilated like that. Our strength isn’t sufficient for us to survive here, so I’ve decided to return to the oceanic shuttle. What about you?”

She hesitated for a moment and nodded, “Alright!”

...

While they traveled, Yun Banqing asked, “Why didn’t you kill them?”

Yang Ye replied with a question, “You wanted me to kill them?”

She chuckled and didn’t speak further.

It didn’t take long for them to leave the ruins and travel to the mountain range where the black ape resided. As soon as they arrived there, the black ape appeared before them.

The black ape immediately gazed at Yun Banqing and said, “Leave this little girl here!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she nodded in response.

Meanwhile, the black ape continued, “She can go to the gorge that I reside in. My aura lingers there, so most demon beasts would dare not enter that area.”

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and then 5 Emperor Realm Sword Servants appeared here, “Miss Yun, your safety should be guaranteed with these 5 puppets by your side. Just wait for us there.”

She nodded and said, “Be careful.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course!” As soon as he finished speaking, he gazed at the black ape, “Let’s go!”

Both of them nodded and shot towards the distance.

Yang Ye couldn’t help but ask while they traveled, “How strong is that demon beast who’s guarding the Energy Convergence Pool?”

The black ape replied, “How strong do you think he is after bathing in the pure energy within the pool all day and night for so long?”

Yang Ye asked, “How many Voider Realm demon beasts are there throughout the island?”

The black ape replied, “2! Me and him!”

Yang Ye asked another question, “What type of demon beast is he?”

The black ape fell silent for a short while, and then he answered, “I don’t know!”

Yang Ye was speechless.
