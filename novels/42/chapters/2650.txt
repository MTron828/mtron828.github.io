Chapter 2651 – I’ll Play You to Death!

Shameless!

Yang Ye was no match for them, so he was using such methods to threaten them. It was shameless!

And they really didn’t dare to attack without restraint because of this.

They only dared to suppress Yang Ye with their auras yet didn’t dare to attack him anymore. Because if they did that, this world wouldn’t be able to endure it. Once they made this place collapse, and that woman in white showed herself, then all of them would probably die here.

Even though they were confident and had the numerical advantage, even ten times their forces would perish before Destiny!

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted back by their combined auras!

But just a moment later, Yang Ye charged at them again.

They were afraid of destroying this world but Yang Ye wasn’t. Or it should be said that he was destroying this place on purpose. He clearly planned to take them down with him!

If the woman in white came, he may be able to survive, but if it was the woman in black or some other form of Destiny, even he would die!

However, he’d disregarded his survival a long time ago. All he wanted to do now was fight them to the death!

Even though their auras were strong, it wasn’t quite realistic to try killing Yang Ye with their auras alone. Especially when Yang Ye was holding Heaven Executor’s complete form!

Yang Ye charged at them again. Every swing of his sword would affect the world around them.

Every time this happened, the Divine Abode’s master and the others’ eyelids would twitch.

Suddenly, Shui Wubian spoke coldly, “If he’s not afraid, why should we be afraid?!”

As soon as he said that, a wave of mysterious energy appeared here.

The Water Domain!

Once the Water Domain appeared, countless strands of Boundless Water appeared in the sky, and a wave of powerful energy rippled through the world around them.

Suddenly, two types of mysterious energy appeared within the Water Domain!

The Slaughter Domain!

The Sword Domain!

Once these two types of Domains appeared, the Water Domain was instantly suppressed. At the same time, a ray of sword energy flashed!

Hiss!

Space was sliced into bits wherever it passed!

Shui Wubian’s expression changed, and he didn’t dare to go head-on against Yang Ye’s attack at all. He immediately flashed over 1km away to create distance between them.

However, Yang Ye refused to let him escape and chased after him.

Shui Wubian’s face instantly turned gloomy from the sight of this. He glanced at the Divine Abode’s master and the others, “If even he’s unafraid, what are we afraid of?!”

As he spoke, he charged at Yang Ye.

Their expressions changed repeatedly. They were naturally displeased to be threatened like this, but they were worried too. What if Destiny really showed herself? What would they do then?

Destiny!

It was a blade that just floated there above their heads, and they had no choice but to fear it! They had to worry about it!

Meanwhile, Shui Wubian had entered into battle with Yang Ye.

“He’s intentionally luring Destiny here!” The Destiny Realm expert known as Xu Yue spoke solemnly, “He wants to use Destiny to eliminate us!”

The Divine Abode’s master nodded, “I know.”

Xu Yue asked solemnly, “So are we going to fight or not?”

The Divine Abode’s master fell silent for a long time before he shook his head, “Not now! Xu Yue, please head back to the End World and get something for us!”

Xu Yue was stunned for a moment, and then he smiled. He glanced coldly at Yang Ye and vanished into the sky.

Meanwhile, Shui Wubian grew increasingly shocked as his battle with Yang Ye went on. Because Yang Ye’s sword was truly too terrifying. He didn’t dare to go head-on against any of Yang Ye’s attacks because that sword could slice through his Water Domain with absolute ease!

So, if the Divine Abode’s master and the others didn’t join the battle, Shui Wubian was being completely suppressed!

However, while Yang Ye had the whole form of Heaven Executor, it was quite difficult for him to kill Shui Wubian. After all, Shui Wubian was a peak Destiny Realm expert, and if the latter risked his life in battle and kept fighting evasively, it would be very difficult for Yang Ye to kill him.

At this moment, Yang Ye seemed to have noticed that Shui Wubian was buying time!

He knew that they had a plan to deal with him!

After he blasted Shui Wubian back with a swing of his sword, Yang Ye didn’t choose to attack again. He glanced at the surroundings and was about to leave. However, the Divine Abode’s master and the others stopped him.

The Divine Abode’s master laughed coldly, “What? You’re trying to run now?”

As he spoke, he and the others raised their hands. In an instant, a strand of invisible energy locked down the area around Yang Ye.

They’d trapped him!

Yang Ye glanced coldly at the surroundings with indifference on his face.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The Divine Abode’s master laughed coldly, “Yang Ye, you’ve courted death today.”

As he spoke, he looked up at the sky, and a figure was shooting over here.

It didn’t take long for the figure to appear nearby. It was Xu Yue who’d left earlier!

Xu Yue gazed at Yang Ye with a cold smile on his face, “Yang Ye, your doom is nigh!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand. A crimson red seal instantly floated above Yang Ye. In an instant, the space in a huge area started to shrink and become fortified!

Space was being fortified!

A short while later, the space around Yang Ye was fortified to the point it was like steel!

Right when they were about to attack, Yang Ye suddenly attacked first, or it should be said that he swung his sword!

Yang Ye grabbed his sword with both hands and stabbed it forward.

Hiss!

The sword stabbed into space. In an instant, the space in a huge area around Yang Ye cracked open, and then in just a moment, the space there collapsed and was obliterated!

Moreover, the crimson seal which was fortifying the space here instantly cracked open. It had endured most of the strength of Yang Ye’s attack!

The Divine Abode’s master and the others were stunned by this!

Actually, they’d far underestimated the strength of Yang Ye’s sword!

The special characteristics of this sword and the strength it contained wasn’t something a Super Divine Treasure could compare to. As for fortifying the space here, this sword had even been able to eliminate the quintessence of the Heaven Dao itself, so how could it not destroy some space?

So long as it didn’t exceed the scope of Three Dimensional Space, nothing could stop this sword!

Only the legendary Four Dimensional Space may be able to stop its blade!

After he shattered the surrounding space with a swing of his sword, Yang Ye charged at them. He didn’t hold back at all, causing the world around him to turn ethereal as his sword shot through the air.

This world was really unable to endure his sword!

The Divine Abode’s master and the others’ expressions were extremely unsightly. It could be said that if they fought back, this world would probably be destroyed.

They exchanged glances. In the end, they retreated, but Yang Ye didn’t stop. He charged at them again.

Just like that, Yang Ye started chasing them around!

Countless experts of Eternal Kingdom were stunned by this scene.

It was too insane!

Just like that Yang Ye chased them all the way to the End Dimension, or to be more precise, he’d chased them back to the End World.

When he arrived outside the End World, Yang Ye had already lost any shred of sensibility he had left, and he was even going to chase them there.

Suddenly, Snowy appeared behind him and held on tight to stop him from going inside.

He could chase them up to this point, but he would be in trouble if he went any further!

Those fellows wouldn’t fear being discovered by Destiny while they were in there.

Yang Ye calmed down slightly when Snowy started pulling him back. He glanced at the teleportation formation and recalled that he couldn’t go inside! He would definitely die there if he went in!

Calm down! Calm down!

Yang Ye took Snowy in his arms and walked to the side, and then he sat down cross-legged and worked hard on calming himself.

Snowy rubbed her head lightly against Yang Ye’s chin. She felt extremely sad as she looked at the state Yang Ye was in.

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head gently and slowly calmed down. He glanced at the teleportation formation which led to the End World and seemed to be lost in thought.

A long time later, Yang Ye looked ahead, and there were two swords floating there.

Heaven Executor! Past Life!

He hadn’t used Past Life earlier. It was a trump card of his, so he felt he should keep it and use it at a critical moment. Only then could he catch his enemies off guard!

Meanwhile, Snowy suddenly pulled Yang Ye into the Primordial Pagoda.

In the Primordial Pagoda, where Erya was. Erya’s aura was quite unusually powerful.

It was so powerful that even Yang Ye’s heart palpitated slightly before it.

Snowy pointed at Erya while worry filled her eyes.

Yang Ye was quite worried too. Was Erya’s growth normal or was it not?

Suddenly, Erya opened her eyes, and they were scarlet red!

She glanced at Yang Ye, and this glance of hers made his heart tremble!

Meanwhile, Snowy hurried over to Erya, and then she covered Erya’s eyes while shaking her head repeatedly.

She was telling Erya not to scare them like that!

A short while later, Snowy removed her paws, and Erya was quite normal now.

Erya rubbed Snowy’s head gently and gazed at Yang Ye, “Big Brother Yang, give me a while longer. Something is condensing within me, and one third of it is about to finish condensing soon. So long as that’s done, I will come outside and help you kill them all!”

Yang Ye walked over to her and spoke softly, “W-Will you become abnormal then and even try to kill me?”

Even though he was joking, Erya’s glance had been quite terrifying.

He was really afraid that Erya would cease to be the Erya he knew!

Erya glanced at him with displeasure, “Don’t worry, Big Brother Yang. Even if I kill myself, I would never harm you and Snowy.”

Yang Ye felt quite warm inside. He rubbed her head gently and said, “I believe you!”

After chatting with Erya for some time, Yang Ye and Snowy left the Primordial Pagoda. Yang Ye went over to the teleportation formation which led to the End World, and then he just stood there with his sword in his right hand while Snowy stood on his shoulder.

A short while later, Snowy suddenly opened her mouth, and then strands of spirit energy ceaselessly emerged from the teleportation formation.

Yang Ye had a ferocious expression on his face, “I’ll play all of you to death!”

As he spoke, he shot a glance up into the sky, “Destiny! I refuse to believe that you won’t show yourself!”
