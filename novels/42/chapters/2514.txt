Chapter 2515 – I’m Afraid!

Yang Ye walked into the city with his sword in hand, and the one-armed man wasn’t too far away!

Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto the man.

At this moment, the one-armed man was staring at Yang Ye, and then he suddenly stomped his right foot down when Yang Ye was around 30m away from him.

Bang!

He shot up into the sky, and his figure seemed to turn ethereal. It didn’t take long for a huge pitch-black wolf to appear before Yang Ye.

“A Primal Demonwolf!” Mo Ya exclaimed with shock!

The Primal Demonwolf in the sky gazed coldly at Yang Ye, “Human, you’ve forced me to show my true form.”

Yang Ye glanced at the Primal Demonwolf and was about to attack, but he suddenly frowned, “Are you sure?”

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Ye nodded, “Alright!”

Boom!

A soon as he said that, a ray of golden light shot up into the air.

At the same time, a dragon roar resounded through the city!

A colossus appeared above the city. It was so huge that it practically covered half the city. Moreover, a strand of powerful dragon pressure rained down from above, causing countless demons to shudder!

A Primal True Dragon!

The entire demon race was stunned by its appearance!

It was a real Primal True Dragon!

The Primal Demonwolf stared at the dragon, “You’re a demon of my demon race, so…”

However, the dragon didn’t waste its breath on him and just charged at the Primal Demonwolf.

The entire sky shook before it!

Boom!

Countless demons watched as the dragon slammed the wolf away, but that wasn’t the end of it. The dragon’s huge tail swept forward and swept the wolf over 10km away!

However, the wolf counterattacked as well.

Just like that, they entered into battle in the sky.

While the dragon was at the Four World Realm, it wasn’t any weaker to the Primal Demonwolf who was at the Five World Realm! Not only that, it even suppressed the wolf. The dragon’s body was clearly much stronger than the wolf!

It was because they were of a different rank!

Mo Ya suddenly asked, “Is that dragon yours?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and replied, “It’s a friend of mine!”

A friend!

As far as Yang Ye was concerned, the dragon and the others were all his friends.

Demon beast and human friends! It was actually not rare. However, it was quite inconceivable for a human to be friends with a Primal True Dragon. After all, the dragons were extremely proud, and it was especially so for a Primal True Dragon, they were proud to the bone.

As far as Mo Ya was concerned, it was absolutely impossible for a Primal True Dragon to be friends with a human!

Meanwhile, the dragon had completely suppressed the wolf, and victory was perhaps just a matter of time!

The Four World Realm against the Five World Realm!

Actually, Yang Ye could kill the Primal Demonwolf. However, he couldn’t expose too much of his strength. Otherwise, killing the wolf would be absolutely easy. Just like how he hadn’t even used Executor until now. If he used Executor, he could definitely take the wolf’s head with absolute ease!

Unfortunately, he was restrained by many things here, so he couldn’t use his full strength!

Bang!

Suddenly, an explosion resounded, and then the wolf crashed down from midair and slammed into the ground outside the city.

The dragon shrunk and returned to Yang Ye’s side.

Yang Ye asked, “What do you think?”

The dragon shook its head, “Too weak. He wasn’t enough for a proper battle!”

The dragon entered the Primordial Pagoda after it finished speaking.

Not enough!

Yang Ye shook his head and grinned. He felt that the dragon sounded very close to Erya.

Erya!

That little fellow was much more terrifying than the dragon. If she were here, the wolf would probably be beaten up so much that it would start to question reality!

Yang Ye glanced at the wolf who had returned to human form and asked, “Does the demon race still want to play?”

The wolf stared at Yang Ye, and a wisp of blood flowed out slowly from the corner of his mouth!

Suddenly, a voice came from above the city wall, “Since we’re playing, we should have lots of fun!”

Yang Ye looked over, and he saw a man with a pair of horns on his head standing on the city walls.

The man was in human form with a pair of horns on his head, and he wore a loose ink green robe while his arms were hidden within his sleeves.

Yang Ye glanced at the man and nodded, “I’ll accompany you to the end!”

The man suddenly vanished.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted over 3km away from the city!

Meanwhile, the man with the horns was standing where Yang Ye had been a moment ago!

Yang Ye glanced at his stomach. At this moment, his entire body had cracked open!

Blood was spraying out of him!

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and looked up at the man with the horns. He’d finally encountered an extraordinary genius!

His spirits soared!

Yang Ye twisted his right foot lightly against the ground.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy flashed!

The man frowned slightly, and he dodged backward. As soon as he did that, two flying swords suddenly shot through the spot he’d been standing on!

Meanwhile, the young man raised his hand and slammed a punch forward!

It just happened to slam against a sword.

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and then the man was pushed around 30m back. However, two more flying swords shot at him before he could even stop himself!

It was a perfect chain of attacks!

He wasn’t given even a moment to catch his breath!

The man frowned slightly, and then he gently pushed both his palms down.

Bang!

A wave of invisible force suddenly erupted from the space around him, and it instantly blasted the swords away!

A moment later, he took a stride forward and swung a punch!

Bang!

This punch caused the clouds in the sky to instantly vanish without a trace!

It wasn’t just the clouds, even the air in a huge area had been sucked away, and only a void was left behind!

At this moment, a solemn expression appeared on Yang Ye’s face. The strength contained within this punch was something he’d only seen from a single person, and that was Erya! Only Erya could accomplish this with pure physical strength!

Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly. A sheath appeared in his left grasp, and then he drew his sword and swung it!

In an instant, he drew and swung his sword 10 times!

10 overlapped attacks with the Sword Domain!

At the instant he completed the final swing, the space in the surroundings suddenly froze.

Crack!

A moment later, it exploded apart and formed a huge pitch black hole in space!

Boom!

Their attacks swept against each other within the black hole. In an instant, the black hole surged while countless strands of dark matter trembled and exploded apart. The powerful force of the collision almost obliterated the city. However, at the critical moment, a strand of mysterious energy enveloped the city and saved it from destruction!

In the black hole, sword howls and explosions resounded incessantly.

At this moment, the entire War Dimension was shaking!

Just like that, around an hour passed before the black hole calmed down.

Yang Ye and the man were standing opposite each other with around 30m between them!

Suddenly, two flying swords shot out from Yang Ye’s waist!

Hiss! Hiss!

The flying swords were extremely fast and instantly arrived before the man. However, the man reacted quickly, and he dodged to the side and swung a punch before they even arrived!

His fist was an all-round attack!

And it covered an entire area!

The punch blasted Yang Ye’s flying swords away, but another sword descended from above him!RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

This sword wasn’t Executor, and it was just an ordinary sword!

Besides when he killed the old man in the House of Indulgence, Yang Ye had never used Executor in the War Dimension, nor did he dare to use it. It was too shocking, and it may expose his identity!

The man remained calm when facing this attack, and he just tapped his finger forward. The muscles throughout his body bulged in an instant, and a strand of powerful energy erupted from the horns on his head.

Bang!

A rumbling explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was blasted backward by over 1km!

Meanwhile, the pitch black expanse of space around them exploded apart again!

The man was about to attack again when Yang Ye suddenly vanished. The man frowned slightly and slammed a punch forward.

Pure strength!

Needless to say, the man’s strength wasn’t any weaker to Erya. As far as Yang Ye was concerned, if Erya fought this man, then Erya would have a slightly higher chance at winning. After all, Erya’s strength made his heart palpitate, but the man’s strength was only terrifying to him. While the man hadn’t returned to his true form, Erya had never done so either!

Moreover, who knew what Erya’s true form was… or how terrifying it was…

Yang Ye had arrived before the man, and he swung his sword!

This time, it was the Sword Precursor!

After 10 swings, one more swing followed them!

11 swings!

11 overlapped attacks with the Sword Domain. The world dimmed down before it! And Yang Ye’s face instantly warped because he was enduring extreme pain!

The man clenched both his fists when facing this attack.

Boom!

A moment later, a wave of monstrous pressure swept out from within him. At the same time, his fists slammed forward from behind the wave of pressure!

This punch slammed directly against Yang Ye’s final swing!

Bang!

Sword and fist immediately split apart upon coming into contact.

Yang Ye was blasted away while the man suffered the same. He was blasted all the way into the city, and space was instantly obliterated in his wake!

They were equally matched in this collision!

Once the man stopped himself, he looked up at Yang Ye from within the city, “I can sense that you haven’t gone all out. You seem to be worried about something, or do you think I have no right to face your full strength?”

My full strength?

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and cracked a smile, “If I use my full strength, I’m afraid that I’ll slaughter everything in this city.”
