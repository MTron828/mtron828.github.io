Chapter 2616 – Origin World!

Yang Ye was naturally unaware of the way to the Origin World. After all, Qi Bitian had sent him there the last time!

He'd never gone there himself!

But he knew that these people here definitely knew how to get there.

At this moment, he wasn’t in a very normal state due to the fact that Snowy and the others had been taken.

He was capable of anything right now!

The experts from the other powers here were clearly aware of that too!

Yang Ye was a madman without a shred of sensibility, and he would act rashly in this state. Obviously, they didn’t want to shoulder the consequences for the Origin World!

It didn’t take long for some of the Destiny Realm experts here to take action!

A huge teleportation formation appeared beneath Yang Ye’s feet!

It was extremely huge! It was over 300m wide!

A few breaths of time later, the formation shook, and then Yang Ye vanished within it.

The others in the shadows heaved sighs of relief when they saw Yang Ye vanish!

That madman wasn’t in a normal state anymore, and he would fight people to the death if he was allowed to stay a while longer!

Actually, some of the powers here felt quite fortunate. They felt lucky that the Sprite Progenitor had been taken by the Origin World. Because if it had been taken by them, they would have offended this madman, and it would probably result in them never having another moment of peace!

Now, the Origin World was in trouble!

…

A long time passed before Yang Ye opened his eyes. At this moment, he was in the Origin World.

Or to be more precise, he was on that bridge!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then ferocity instantly covered his face. A moment later, he stabbed his sword down with both hands.

Hiss!

The bridge cracked open!

“How dare you!” Suddenly, a furious shout resounded in the air above Yang Ye, and then a towering palm descended from the sky and clawed at Yang Ye’s head!

Yang Ye looked up, and then a ray of sword energy shot up into the air.

Bang!

The huge palm was blasted into bits!

Meanwhile, an old man appeared before Yang Ye, and his expression changed upon seeing Yang Ye, “It’s you!”

He naturally recognized Yang Ye!

It was all because of this fellow that the entire Origin World had suffered a calamity it didn’t deserve!

Everyone had been horrified by that incident!

Now, this fellow was here again!

The old man stared at Yang Ye, “What are you doing here again?!”

Yang Ye laughed coldly, “What am I doing here? I’m here to kill!”

Yang Ye charged at the old man.

The old man’s eyelids twitched. He waved his right hand lightly, and then a pitch black beam of light surged out from his palm.

However, the pitch black beam of light was obliterated by a swing of Yang Ye’s sword!

Yang Ye was swift and shot directly at the old man, and then his sword stabbed forward once more!

The Domain Sword!

The old man’s pupils constricted, and then his figure turned ethereal. The sword pierced through his ethereal body!

However, it wasn’t the old man’s real body as he’d appeared over 1km away!

At this moment, the old man’s face was quite gloomy, “Yang Ye, this isn’t a place for you to go berserk. If you leave now, I can…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared before him again!

Yang Ye’s sword descended!

At the same time, a few flying swords shot at the old man.

The old man’s face became unsightly, but he didn’t attack. He just retreated 3km away!

It was because he was a Destiny Realm expert!

It was because a Destiny Realm expert had attacked Yang Ye that the young girl had shown herself, and once that young girl arrived… It caused two powers to eternally vanish from the Origin World!

Most importantly, the bridge had almost been completely destroyed!

Even the Boundless Water beneath the bridge had almost obliterated this world because of the bridge’s destruction!

So, even if he was furious, he didn’t dare to attack Yang Ye.

The old man stared at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, what the heck do you want?!”

Yang Ye walked toward the old man, “Snowy. Oh, right. You call her the Sprite Progenitor. If anything happens to them, I swear that I’ll annihilate this entire place!”

The Sprite Progenitor!

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “You’re here for the Sprite Progenitor!”

Yang Ye stopped, glanced at the surroundings, and then gazed at the old man, “I don’t have much patience!”

Actually, he was on the verge of losing control.

Snowy, An Nanjing, and Erya could all be considered to be his reverse scales!

He refused to let anyone touch them!

The old man gazed coldly at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, that Sprite Progenitor isn’t your personal property, you…”

“Fuck you!” Suddenly, Yang Ye howled with fury, and then a ray of blood red sword energy flashed on the bridge!

The old man’s face instantly darkened. At this moment, his temper flared as well.

The old man stomped his right foot down and transformed into a shadow that shot at Yang Ye!

Boom!

A rumbling explosion resounded above the bridge. An instant later, a figure was blasted away!

It was Yang Ye!

Yang Ye flew over 1km away before he stopped himself. The old man gazed coldly at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, I’ll give you a chance. Leave now or…”

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and spoke ferociously, “Leave? Fuck your ancestors! If you don’t hand over Snowy and the others right now, then I’ll kill all of you!”

Yang Ye’s figure transformed into a ray of light that charged at the old man.

The desire to kill arose in the old man’s eyes!

He was a dignified Destiny Realm expert, so how could he not be furious when Yang Ye was insulting him like that?

The old man stopped thinking about the consequences and charged at Yang Ye.

Bang! Bang!

Explosions resounded throughout the air above the bridge!

The battle between Yang Ye and the old man drew the attention of some experts, and their expressions turned unsightly when they saw that it was Yang Ye!

The maleficent existence was here once again!

They naturally weren’t afraid of Yang Ye, they were afraid of the expert who backed Yang Ye!

Everyone had backing, and practically all who were without it were dead. But Yang Ye’s backing was a little too powerful!

That young girl had almost obliterated this world!

The battle was still going on above the bridge!

Suppression!

While Yang Ye’s strength was extremely terrifying, it was still quite insufficient against a Destiny Realm expert!

Suppression of the realm of cultivation!

Boom!

An explosion resounded and Yang Ye was blasted away!

He flew over 10km away!

The old man descended slowly from midair. He descended to the bridge while strands of destructive aura ceaselessly rippled out from him!

The old man’s face turned icy cold as he gazed coldly at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, it’s not too late to fuck off right now. Otherwise, even that person who backs you won’t be able to save you!”

Yang Ye spat out the blood in his mouth and looked up at the old man. He laughed ferociously, “Leave? No, it’s only just the beginning. Come on! Let’s continue!”

Executor started to tremble in Yang Ye’s grasp!

Moreover, Yang Ye’s blood started to surge as well!

Bloodline Energy!

At this moment, Yang Ye had fully unleashed his Bloodline Energy.

The old man gazed coldly at Yang Ye, “You asked for this, so don’t blame me for killing you!”

His figure slowly soared into the sky while he waved his hands. Countless strands of water surged up into the air from the surroundings, and then the Boundless Water condensed into arrows. A moment later, he shook his hands slightly in Yang Ye’s direction.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The arrows of Boundless Water shot through the air toward Yang Ye!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly. An instant later, countless strands of sword intent and sword energy appeared!

The Sword Domain Sphere!

Once the Sword Domain Sphere appeared, the arrows of water around him were sliced into bits!

Suddenly, the old man slammed his fist at Yang Ye!

Bang!

The sword energy and sword intent around Yang Ye vanished without a trace while Yang Ye’s figure was pushed back repeatedly as well!

The old man didn’t stop there. His figure shook, and then a wave of powerful energy swept through the bridge!

At this moment, the entire bridge shook!

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted, and he swung his sword with both hands.

The Domain Sword!

It carried his full strength!

As soon as it descended, a powerful explosion resounded through the bridge, and then two figures were blasted toward either side of the bridge!

It was Yang Ye and the old man!

But it didn’t take long for the old man to stop himself!

The old man looked down at his chest, and there was an extremely deep injury there. Blood was ceaselessly seeping out of it!

If he’d been just a little slower, he may have been sliced into two!

The old man was livid. He looked up at the sky and said, “If we don’t eliminate him today, then based on his shocking talent, he’ll definitely become a latent problem for our Origin World!”

A moment of silence ensued, and then a voice resounded from the sky, “Then kill him!”

Once he received an answer, the old man gazed at Yang Ye and smiled fiercely, “Yang Ye, today’s the day you die.”

He seemed to have thought of something at this point and made a clawing motion toward the air in front of him. The space there suddenly split open, and then a fluffy little fellow appeared in the old man’s grasp!

It was Snowy!

At this moment, terror covered Snowy’s face, and her little body was trembling.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Snowy immediately started crying upon noticing Yang Ye!

The old man smiled ferociously at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, you care a lot about this animal?”

As soon as he finished speaking, a bolt of lightning suddenly appeared in his right hand, and then it instantly enveloped Snowy!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Snowy immediately let out a shrill and miserable cry. She shook madly while unprecedented horror arose in her eyes!

However, the old man didn’t stop. A dagger appeared in his grasp, and he spoke fiercely, “Yang Ye, watch closely!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he swung it lightly against Snowy’s forehead.

Hiss!

Snowy’s forehead was sliced open, and a strand of blood surged out!
