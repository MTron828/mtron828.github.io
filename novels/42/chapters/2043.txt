Chapter 2044 – I Reign Supreme!

The Unfettered One had left it here!

Yang Ye was quite shocked because he hadn’t expected the Unfettered One to have actually been to the Weapon Dimension!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and looked at the mountain wall. The words the Unfettered One had left behind were — Amongst the myriad of Sword Daos, I reign supreme!

Yang Ye fell silent when he read this.

Previously, the Unfettered One had said — Amongst the 3,000 Grand Daos of the world, my Sword Dao reigns supreme.

Yet now, it was — amongst the myriad of Sword Daos, I reign supreme!

I reign supreme!

“As expected of our ancestor!” One of them suddenly sighed with emotion, “Even though our ancestor doesn’t focus on sword cultivation, our ancestor probably feels that no one in the world can compete with him in the Sword Dao!”

Yang Ye glanced at that young man and didn’t say anything. Obviously, the young man wasn’t aware that it wasn’t their ancestor who’d written those words.

Or it should be said, the Unfettered One hadn’t alarmed anyone when he arrived at the Weapon Path!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at the mark beside those words. Yang Ye frowned when he saw the mark.

It wasn’t ordinary!

That was what he felt!

The mark the Weapon Progenitor left behind had secrets within it, just like Su Lang had said.

Everyone here fell silent. They stared at the mark, and so did Yang Ye.

A short while later, Yang Ye suddenly walked over to the mountain wall, and then he looked up at the mark. At this moment, when he looked at it from up close, he saw it even more clearly than before. As he gazed and gazed at it, Yang Ye suddenly noticed it move abruptly.

It moved!

The mark was moving swiftly.

It was a sword technique!

After looking at it for some time, Yang Ye noticed that it was displaying a sword technique, a slightly strange sword technique. The reason he felt it was strange was because he’d never seen a technique like it. Even the sword techniques which the old man in Daoist’s robes gave him didn’t have any that were similar to this sword technique!

So, Yang Ye couldn’t help but become immersed in his comprehension!

Two hours later, Yang Ye obtained a single conclusion — it wasn’t just a sword technique!

The mark before him didn’t just contain a sword technique, it contained something else as well.

Yang Ye wasn’t the only one who was immersed in his comprehension, the others had clearly noticed something too, and they’d become immersed in it.

Su Lang’s face was quite calm. Any sword cultivator who’d attained their strength by relying on themselves would be able to notice that there was something else in the mark, but noticing it was one thing, and comprehending it was another.

He gazed at Yang Ye. As far as he was concerned, Yang Ye was the most likely to be able to comprehend it.

At this moment, Yang Ye’s eyes were closed.

Comprehend!

At their level, cultivating didn’t really help much, and comprehension was the most helpful to them!

Just a single sudden comprehension was comparable to 10 or even 100 years of bitter cultivation!

But if they couldn’t achieve comprehension, then even cultivating for 100 years may not do anything for their cultivation!

In Yang Ye’s mind, a figure had started to swing the sword according to the mark on the wall. The movements were very simple, or they should be said to be very monotonous. It was just very simple stabbing, slashing, chopping, flicking… All of them were basic movements in the Sword Dao, and even a child who had just started learning to Sword Dao would know how to do them!

Return to simplicity!

It was a principle that Yang Ye had understood many years ago. So, he knew that it was absolutely not just trying to tell him that his Sword Dao should return to simplicity, and it should carry deeper meaning!

As for what it was, Yang Ye hadn’t figured it out yet.

At this moment, the sky was gradually turning dark, but they still didn’t leave. They continued trying to comprehend it, and it didn’t take long for the second day to arrive.

Just like that, three days passed.

Suddenly, Yang Ye stood up. Su Lang’s gaze immediately descended upon Yang Ye. He was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly cursed, “What the hell! I can’t figure it out! I give up!”

Yang Ye left angrily once he finished speaking.

Meanwhile, Su Lang suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye and smiled, “Brother Yang, you’re leaving just like that?”

Yang Ye shrugged, “What else can I do? Continue wasting time here?”

Su Lang stared at Yang Ye, “Brother Yang, you probably discovered something, right?”

Yang Ye asked, “I discovered something?”

Su Lang spoke in a low voice, “Brother Yang, we agreed that if you succeeded at comprehending anything, you have to give my Guardian Line a copy!”

Yang Ye replied, “But I didn’t comprehend anything! Sigh, my comprehension ability is low. It really can’t be helped, it can’t be helped at all!”

Su Lang stared at Yang Ye and seemed like he wanted to see through Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s expression was calm, and there was nothing strange about his expression.

A few breaths of time passed before Yang Ye smiled, “Brother Su Lang, can I leave now?”

Su Lang spoke in a low voice, “Brother Yang, why not make another friend?”

Yang Ye was stunned and asked, “Aren’t we friends?”

Su Lang took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, and then he said, “Good luck!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Thanks!”

Yang Ye walked around Su Lang and left.

Su Lang’s face was gloomy, and no one knew what he was thinking.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to leave Guardian Mountain, and he immediately returned to Gracious Mountain. In Gracious Hall, Yang Ye sat down cross-legged and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Train with the sword!

Yang Ye started to wave his sword about in the cultivation room.

His sword was very slow, extremely slow even. He was like a child who’d just learned the sword. But Yang Ye had a solemn expression on his face. Moreover, it was growing even more solemn as time passed. A short while later, Yang Ye stopped, and he just stared ahead. There were some marks on the space before him, they were marks made by the sword.

Yang Ye stared at those marks, and a long time passed before he spoke softly, “I see!”

Soul!

The Sword Soul!

Swords had spirits, and the spirits were born from the swords themselves, like its own consciousness or intelligence. Normally, high quality swords would give birth to their own consciousness, but while they had a consciousness, they didn’t have a soul. The soul here was different from the Sword Soul Techniques of the past!

The soul here was the soul of the sword itself!

A spirit and a soul!

It was a soul bestowed upon a sword. In the past, his sword had been extremely strong, but it didn’t have a soul. It was like a person who only had a body but lacked a soul. A person like that was just an empty shell.

A sword with a spirit yet without a soul was just a sharp sword, and it was merely just a little bit stronger.

But to a certain extent, a sword with a soul wasn’t just a sword!

Sword Soul!

Bestowing a soul upon a sword!

That was the secret the Weapon Progenitor had left behind. The reason the Weapon Progenitor hadn’t just bluntly recorded it was that he wanted the disciples of the Weapon Path to comprehend it themselves. Only something one comprehended on one’s own would truly belong to oneself.

What a person comprehended themselves provided them the deepest form of comprehension and understanding!

How to bestow a soul upon a sword?

Actually, it wasn’t difficult, yet it wasn’t easy either. At the very least, that was what Yang Ye thought.

Forging a sword for a sword was a state, and it wasn’t just getting a soul for a sword. It was a realm, a realm in the Sword Dao.

The Sword had intent, a spirit, and techniques. He’d practically grasped all of that, but a sword’s soul was something he’d never considered. However, he’d used Sword Soul Techniques in the past. However, those techniques were completely different from the soul that the Weapon Path’s ancestor was referring to!

His Sword Soul Techniques had been executed with his soul, but the Sword Soul here was purely the soul of a sword!

Train and comprehend!

He needed to train and comprehend. Those movements in the mark were a reference for him. Besides that, the mark contained a trace of something else, and it may be the Weapon Progenitor’s Grand Dao.

However, Yang Ye couldn’t figure it out.

He just trained like a madman!

Every day after that, Yang Ye trained over and over again until night came, and then he would meditate and comprehend!

Time flashed by.

In the Primordial Pagoda, a year had passed in an instant, and Yang Ye had been meditating in the cultivation room for a few months now.

Yang Ye had never been a genius like An Nanjing who could just instantly comprehend things. His strong point was his ability to endure suffering and face it without any fear.

Just like that, another month passed.

Suddenly, Yang Ye opened his eyes, and then he stood up. A moment later, a sword appeared in his grasp, and then he started waving it.

Slash, chop, stab, flick…

It was just these simple movements, over and over again, and he trained for almost 10,000 times before he finally stopped. Yang Ye gazed at the trembling sword in his hand while a smile curled up on the corners of his lips.

He’d succeeded!

After over a year of bitter training and comprehension, he’d finally figured it out and grasped this type of Sword Soul!

In essence, the Sword Soul was a technique. Of course, it was an advanced technique, and it was a realm in the Sword Dao. It was a type of mentality. If one insisted on explaining it in words, then even Yang Ye himself couldn’t give a proper explanation. Because he’d merely just grasped, and it was clearly not such a simple realm!

Simply speaking, the Sword Soul could improve the might of his sword techniques by at least 30% to 40%!

Even though it was just 30% to 40%, it was extremely terrifying! It could be said that he could fight Major Zen Realm experts now. Of course, if he fought senior existences at the Half-Step Sage Realm, then his current strength was clearly insufficient!

The gap in their realms of cultivation was too huge!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and chuckled, and then he left the Primordial Pagoda. Suddenly, Elder Yuan walked into the hall. He sized up Yang Ye and said, “Your strength has improved quite a bit!”

Yang Ye glanced at Elder Yuan and asked, “Senior, what realm of cultivation are you in?”

“My realm of cultivation?” Elder Yuan shook his head, “I’m a nobody.”

As he spoke, he flicked an invitation to Yang Ye, “A Life and Death Invitation. The Prediction Line’s second-ranked genius, Ku Rongtian sent it to you. He wants to fight you to the death on the Life and Death Arena of the Prediction Line!”UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m
