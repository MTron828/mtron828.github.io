Chapter 607 – Lei Lin!

Hiss!

Suddenly, a strand of dazzling and resplendent lightning shot out from the ball of lightning, and the four Natural Treasures were instantly blasted 300m away upon coming into contact with it.

Hiss!

Another bolt of lightning shot out. It was extremely swift and instantly arrived before the four Natural Treasures, and then it smashed against them, causing them to be blasted another 300m away.

Yang Ye watched with astonishment as the four Natural Treasures suddenly converged together and fused into an enormous sword....

“The Sword of Elements!” Yang Ye gulped. These four fellows actually merged together on their own to deal with that ball of lightning! What exactly is that ball of lightning? It was actually able to make these four fellows to put aside the hostility they felt for each other and join forces?

Yang Ye was shocked and puzzled!

After they formed the enormous sword, it actually shot forward by itself without Yang Ye controlling it, and it collided with the ball of lightning.

Meanwhile, a gap suddenly appeared on the ball, and then a beam of white lightning sprayed out from within it and collided with the enormous sword.

Bang!

The space around the point of collision trembled violently while waves of energy swept out incessantly. Meanwhile, the four Natural Treasures were blasted away once more!

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted when he witnessed this scene. What sort of monster is this ball of lightning?

“Oh!” Right at this moment, a voice resounded from within the ball, and it made the corners of Yang Ye’s eyes twitch while he grabbed the wooden sword in his hand.

The four Natural Treasures returned to Yang Ye’s side, and they didn’t dare attack anymore. They just converged together as if they’d formed an alliance.

The ball of lightning surged and warped before a little girl who wore a red Dudou and had her hair done in pigtails appeared in front of Yang Ye. She had beautiful features, and her large eyes were clear and pure. She seemed extremely cute.

Yang Ye was stunned. What the heck is this?

The little girl’s eyes lit up when she saw the four Natural Treasures, and then she spoke in a clear and melodious voice, “Tasty!” As soon as she finished speaking, a bolt of lightning appeared beneath her feet, and then she was in front of Yang Ye. Next, she stretched one hand towards the Violetcloud Lightning while the other went towards the Nether Ghostflame.

Both the Nether Ghostflame and Violetcloud Lightning immediately started trembling violently, and then they flashed into the Primordial Pagoda....

The little girl blinked when she grabbed nothing but air, and then she grabbed at the Greenwood Spirit and Ninth Hell Cold Gale. The two of them hadn’t reacted as quickly at the Nether Ghostflame and Violetcloud Lightning, so they were immediately caught. After that, Yang Ye watched with astonishment as the little girl moved them towards her mouth....

She’s going to eat them.... Yang Ye was quite stunned by this!

Yang Ye didn’t allow her to eat them. He stretched out his hand and grabbed them as well because he didn’t know whether he would be able to recover them once the little girl swallowed them....

Yang Ye and the little girl were each holding half of the Greenwood Spirit and Ninth Hell Cold Gale.

The little girl gazed at Yang Ye, and then she spoke in that clear and melodious voice, “You’re not tasty!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s eyes twitched as he said, “Be good. You can’t eat them.”

The little girl blinked and said, “You intend to take my food from me. You’re a baddie!” The little girl swung her little fist that wasn’t even a third of the size of Yang Ye’s fist.

Even though her fist was tiny, there was a ball of lightning covering it. Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly when he noticed that ball of lightning, and he smashed his fist forward as well and collided with that ball of lightning.

Bang! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

An enormous explosion resounded as both Yang Ye and the little girl took quite a few steps back. Yang Ye revealed shock in his eyes because his fist had actually been scorched by the lightning....

“It hurts!” The little girl puckered her tiny mouth and seemed to be upset. Yang Ye felt sorry for her when he noticed this. After all, she only looked like she was around 2 or 3 years of age. But in the next moment, two bolts of lightning suddenly shot out from her eyes and instantly arrived in front of him.

Yang Ye’s expression changed a little. He swung out a strand of sword qi that was enhanced by 10th level Sword Intent against those two bolts of lightning.

Bang!

The lightning exploded into pieces while the sword qi didn’t lose any momentum as it shot towards the little girl.

The little girl blinked, opened her mouth, and spat. A ball of lightning flashed out, and then it grew larger and larger. In an instant, it was over 300m in diameter, and it completely enveloped Yang Ye’s sword qi before smashing down towards Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted at the sight of this. What exactly is that? It was actually able to destroy 10th level Sword Intent!

Yang Ye suppressed the shock in his heart and took a step forward as he activated his Sword Domain. The ball of lightning instantly exploded apart into countless strands of electricity that dispersed into the surroundings. At this moment, the little girl finally revealed fear in her eyes.

Yang Ye walked over to her, and then pinched her cheeks as he said, “What’s your name?”

“Lei... Lei Lin....” The little girl was clearly quite afraid of Yang Ye, and she even stuttered.

“Why do you want to eat them?” asked Yang Ye.

“Hungry... I’m so hungry....” The little girl’s eyes had actually moistened, but her tears seemed to be blue in color.

Yang Ye’s face darkened. She’s hungry? She intends to eat Natural Treasures because she’s hungry? My god! Those are Natural Treasures! How can she just eat them?

“You.... Let me eat them, alright?” She gazed at Yang Ye while revealing a pleading expression.

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched while he withdrew a Heaven Rank spirit fruit, and he said, “How about this?”

The little girl took one, placed it against her nose, and took a sniff. Her eyes lit up, and she nodded, “Alright!” As she spoke, she immediately placed it in her mouth, and it wasn’t long before it vanished completely....

After she finished it, she stretched out her little hand and blinked at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was quite generous, and he withdrew even more Heaven Rank spirit fruits and gave them to her. The little girl was simply overjoyed. She took them and kept sending them to her mouth, and it wasn’t long before she’d finished all of them. After that, she stretched out her little hand again....

Just like that, Yang Ye kept on giving while she kept on eating, and it wasn’t long before she’d consumed over 300 Heaven Rank herbs and fruits. Moreover, she seemed like she still wasn’t full....

Even though Yang Ye had a huge amount of Heaven Rank herbs and fruit, it still really hurt for him when she kept eating like this. However, he still let her continue because his ‘sacrifice’ wasn’t wasted at all. At this moment, she wasn’t hostile to him anymore, or it should be said that she’d become much closer to him. Because no electricity appeared around her while she came close to him.

Around 2 hours later, the little girl wiped her mouth. Meanwhile, Yang Ye hurriedly withdrew 2 more spirit fruits and passed them to her. The little girl smiled sweetly and said, “I’m full!”

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. Even though he had a huge amount of Heaven Rank herbs and fruit, he was afraid that she would be a bottomless hole that could never be full! Fortunately, she was finally full....

Yang Ye placed those fruits in her hand and said, “Keep them and eat them slowly because I’m leaving.”

The little girl blinked, and then she hurriedly grabbed Yang Ye’s hand as she shook her and said, “Don’t leave. I’m... I’m afraid of being hungry....”

Yang Ye’s face twitched. What does she think I am? A sack of food?

Meanwhile, she suddenly pulled Yang Ye’s hand and started running towards a certain direction. Yang Ye was taken by surprise, and he was almost dragged to the ground....

What terrifying strength! What exactly is she? Yang Ye was shocked.

In next to no time, they arrived before a stone tablet, and then she pointed at it. Yang Ye hesitated for a moment before he walked over to it. The stone tablet instantly emanated a golden glow, and then a row of words appeared on it.

“I’m the image left behind by the Dragon Ancestor, and I await here for the Dragon Ancestor’s descendants. But I never expected that no descendant of the dragon race actually arrived here after 50,000 years of waiting. Has my dragon race ceased to exist, or have the defiant profounders escaped the seal? 50,000 years of waiting exhausted all my energy, and I’ll vanish for eternity tomorrow

“I have no choice but to place the Dragon Ancestor’s inheritance within this stone tablet. I hope the descendants of my dragon race will be able to inherit it. If someone not from the dragon race arrives here, then please take care of my dragon race once you obtain this inheritance. So long as you’ve obtained the inheritance of the Dragon Ancestor, then you can become a King of the dragon race. If you’re a defiant profounder.... Haha, then everything would be meaningless....”

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts while his emotions surged in his heart. He hadn’t imagined that the 8th level would actually be where the inheritance of the Dragon Ancestor resided. Unfortunately, not a single dragon of the dragon clan had been able to arrive here, and he’d benefited from it in the end. Yang Ye truly wondered if the Dragon Emperor would cough up blood upon finding out about this!

What does becoming a king of the dragon clan represent? Yang Ye shook his head. He suddenly seemed to have thought of something and turned around to gaze at Lei Lin as he said, “How long have you been waiting here?”

Lei Lin lowered her head and said, “Very long....”

Yang Ye couldn’t help but feel pity for her, and he rubbed her head. In an instant, a strand of electricity shot through his body and numbed his entire body. Lei Lin blinked, and then she waved her hand. The electricity surging throughout Yang Ye’s body vanished instantaneously.

Yang Ye gulped down. Is she the god of lightning? Her entire body is covered in electricity, and it’s even very terrifying!Lei Lin pointed at the stone tablet as if she was telling Yang Ye to head over.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment before he walked over to the stone tablet. Even though it might be dangerous to accept the Dragon Ancestor’s inheritance, he didn’t want to give up on it. Or it should be said that he would refuse to give up if there was even a chance of improving his strength!

As soon as he touched the stone tablet, a strand of golden light suddenly surged out from within it. The golden light instantly enveloped Yang Ye, and then threads of red liquid appeared within the golden light before surging towards Yang Ye’s body....

As soon as the threads of red liquid came into contact with Yang Ye’s skin, they broke through Yang Ye’s skin without being obstructed at all and surged into his body....

“AH!!!” Yang Ye suddenly let out a shrill cry when the red liquid surged into him, and then his skin started to change. A pure gold scale suddenly appeared on Yang Ye’s foot, and then a second, a third....
