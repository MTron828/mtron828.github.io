Chapter 1697 - I’ll Be Back!

At this moment, there was a golden bracer on Yang Ye’s arm, and there was a tiny ‘邢’ character on the bracer.

His hand was trembling, it was trembling violently.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s face was savage and warped. It seemed like he was enduring some sort of tremendous pain.

“What’s that?!” An Nanjing stared at Yang Ye’s right arm as she asked this question.

Qiong Qi fell silent for a moment, and then he replied, “The Wargod’s arm, the Wargod that once reigned supreme through the world.”

An Nanjing asked, “The Wargod? Was he strong?”

Qiong Qi nodded, “Very strong!”

An Nanjing nodded slightly, and then she gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye held the head in his hand as he started walking in Yang Xiao and the others’ direction. When he arrived around 30m from them, he casually tossed the head over to them, “So True Realm experts are this weak!”

Yang Xiao gazed at Yang Ye for a short while, and then he gazed at Yang Ye’s right arm. He wasn’t the only one. Yang Gu and the others were looking at Yang Ye’s right arm as well. Obviously, the arm was the reason that Yang Ye’s strength had risen to such a terrifying extent!

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Xiao said, “I never expected you to possess such a trump card. Unfortunately, it’s still an external source of strength and doesn’t belong to you. If I’m not wrong, you’re definitely unable to endure its strength, and you’re actually enduring tremendous pain. It’ll take an hour at most. After that, I wouldn’t have to kill you because you’ll die from the energy of that arm.”

Yang Ye laughed ferociously, “All of you’ll die before that happens!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot, and he was before Yang Xiao when he appeared again. After that, he slapped his palm at Yang Xiao.

Yang Xiao’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he took a step forward and tapped two fingers towards Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s palm and Yang Xiao’s finger came into contact while everyone watched.

Boom!

An explosion resounded. Yang Xiao was blasted over 3km away, and both his fingers were obliterated.

Yang Gu and the others were astounded! They hadn’t expected that Yang Ye’s strength had actually arrived at such a level!

Yang Gu and the others weren’t the only ones who were astounded. Yang Xiao was quite surprised as well. He hadn’t expected Yang Ye to be strong enough to injure him. After all, the gap between him and Yang Ye was huge. As far as he was concerned, it was impossible to close that gap with external sources of strength.

However, even he couldn’t resist Yang Ye’s current strength!

Yang Xiao’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye’s right arm again, “What is that arm?”

“An arm that’ll take your life!” As soon as Yang Ye’s ferocious voice resounded, he vanished on the spot again. At the same moment, Yang Xiao swiftly took a step back, and then he slapped his right palm forward.

The powerful energy within his palm instantly created a shocking vortex in space. However, when Yang Ye’s palm descended, the space there shattered in an instant, and then Yang Xiao was pushed back repeatedly from within the black hole.

Suddenly, the black hole started to spin. In an instant, the black hole transformed into a black colored vortex, and it swept Yang Xiao into it.

Yang Gu and the others’ expressions changed drastically at the sight of this, and they were about to attack.

Bang!

However, a loud explosion suddenly resounded from within the vortex, and then space was repaired by a strand of mysterious energy.

Yang Gu and the others hurriedly gazed at Yang Xiao, and their faces fell when they saw him. Because there was a trace of scarlet red on the corner of Yang Xiao’s mouth. Besides that, there was an injury created by a sword on Yang Xiao’s chest.

Yang Xiao had actually been injured!

Yang Gu and the others were absolutely shocked by this!

Yang Xiao was one of the strongest experts in this world, but what about Yang Ye? Yang Ye was just a Rebirth Realm cultivator!

The Rebirth Realm!

A Rebirth Realm cultivator had actually been able to injure the Yang Clan’s patriarch! If they hadn’t witnessed it with their own eyes, they would never believe it. However, the facts before them told them that Yang Ye had accomplished that.

Yang Gu and the others gazed at Yang Ye. There was killing intent in their eyes, undisguised killing intent!

This time, they weren’t fearful of Yang Ye, they were quite afraid.

Truly afraid.

Yang Ye was only at the Rebirth Realm, yet he possessed such strength. Even though he was relying on external sources of strength, it still belonged to him. Once he attained the Zenith Realm, then wouldn’t Yang Ye be able to kill True Realm experts like he was slicing through vegetables?

At this moment, they’d formed enmity with Yang Ye, so Yang Ye would definitely take revenge in the future. Thus, if Yang Ye didn’t die today, they could imagine that they would have to die in the future.

So, Yang Ye had to die!

Yang Gu and the others weren’t the only ones that had such thoughts, even Yang Xiao did. He really hadn’t taken Yang Ye seriously before this. After all, he had the ability to do that. Yet now, he knew that if he allowed Yang Ye to continue growing, then the Yang Clan would definitely have a formidable enemy in the future!

Yang Ye had to die!

As soon as he thought up to this point, Yang Xiao slowly clenched his fists. Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Yang Xiao when he appeared again. After that, he clenched his right fist and slammed it down at Yang Ye.

A powerful wave of force instantly obliterated the space around him, causing the surroundings to instantly fall into darkness.

“Mantra Point!” Suddenly, Yang Xiao’s voice resounded in the black hole. An instant later, a wave of powerful energy swept out from the black hole, and then the black hole was torn up into pieces.

Rumble!

Explosions resounded incessantly through the black hole, and it took over a dozen breaths of time for space to return to normal.

An Nanjing slowly clenched her fists while she stared at that expanse of space in the distance. There was worry in her eyes.

It didn’t take long for space there to fully return to normal, and both Yang Ye and Yang Xiao appeared before everyone.

They were around 3km away from each other, and both of them looked fine on the outside.

Just like that, around 10 breaths of silence ensued before Yang Xiao gazed at Yang Ye’s right arm again, “What arm is that?”

He’d asked a similar question earlier, and Yang Ye hadn’t answered him. Now, he’d asked again. Obviously, he was extremely curious about the arm. Of course he was. Because Yang Ye was able to fight him by relying on that arm.

Yang Ye didn’t answer Yang Xiao. He just stomped his right foot down and shot forward. This time, his target wasn’t Yang Xiao but Yang Gu’s group.

Yang Gu and the others’ expressions changed at the sight of this. They weren’t Yang Xiao who could resist Yang Ye in his current state. Even though they were extremely fearful, none of them retreated. They were True Realm experts at any rate, so they had mental fortitude and courage.

Yang Gu immediately slammed his cane forward.

Yang Ling and the others behind Yang Gu attacked simultaneously as well. How terrifying were the joint forces of four True Realm experts?

A gigantic expanse of space shook violently! It was absolutely shocking!

Yang Ye didn't slow down at all. Viciousness flashed through his eyes as he clenched his right fist and slammed it forward.

A wave of powerful force surged out from his fist and rippled forward. In just an instant, a huge expanse of space collapsed, and then Yang Gu and the others’ expressions changed drastically in response. Because Yang Ye’s strength was the most terrifying when he was within a black hole.

Fortunately, the newly collapsed expanse of space was instantly repaired.

It was Yang Xiao! Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

He naturally had to help. Because Yang Ye was within a black hole, and True Realm experts were nothing to Yang Ye while he was in a black hole. Yang Ye could kill them at will! Even though the Yang Clan was a huge clan, it couldn’t afford to lose True Realm experts.

Or it should be said that the Yang Clan had lost enough True Realm experts. If Yang Gu and the others perished here, then the Yang Clan would have truly suffered severe losses.

At this moment, Yang Ye had appeared 3km away. His face was completely warped, and his right hand was still shivering. Actually, if one looked carefully, one would notice that it wasn’t just his right hand which was shivering, his entire body was shivering.

Even though it was just an arm, its original owner had been an extremely terrifying existence while he was still living. Yang Ye’s current strength was too inferior to the arm’s original owner. So, he wasn’t able to endure its strength at all.

Now, he was enduring it with his willpower!

But he was almost on the verge of failing to endure it!

Suddenly, Yang Xiao leaped up into the air and arrived above Yang Ye, and then he slapped his palm down at Yang Ye.

A huge black palm descended from the sky and seemed to intend to smack Yang Ye into bits.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye looked up at the huge palm above him, and then he stomped his right foot down, shot up into the air, and slapped his palm at the huge palm.

Boom!

Yang Xiao’s attack was slapped into bits. Yang Ye didn’t attack again after he did that. His figure flashed over to Qiong Qi instead, “Let’s go!” His voice was very hoarse.

Qiong Qi was stunned for a moment, and then he slapped his claws down and shot off towards the starry sky with Yang Ye and An Nanjing on his back.

“Stop them!” Yang Xiao’s voice resounded, and then his figure transformed into a beam of light that charged at Yang Ye’s group. Yang Gu and the others hurriedly followed after Yang Xiao.

Suddenly, Yang Ye slapped his palm downwards in their direction.

Bang!

A wave of powerful force surged down from above. Yang Xiao was instantly pushed backwards repeatedly. He wasn’t the only one, Yang Gu and the others suffered a similar fate.

They stopped themselves after being pushed numerous kilometers back. Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s group had vanished into the depths of the starry sky.

At the same time, Yang Ye’s ferocious voice resounded from far away, “Yang Clan! I’ll be back! I definitely will!”
