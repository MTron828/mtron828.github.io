Chapter 2801 – Dead!

The Fate Sword Dao!

It was an extreme form of the Sword Dao, and its strength couldn’t be fully unleashed until one was in a true moment of life and death.

It could be said that the more dangerous it got, the stronger the attack would be!

At this moment, he felt threatened, so his sword intent and aura were growing even more terrifying.

Monarch Yan naturally didn’t stop his assault. He couldn’t even if he wanted to. Because Yang Ye’s sword would strike him no matter what.

Monarch Yan commanded the black energy to overlap around Yang Ye, turning the area around Yang Ye into an expanse of pitch black…

That expanse of space had been forcibly wiped out of existence!

Yang Ye’s sword intent rippled out of him incessantly. Besides sword intent, there was slaughter intent and the Sword Domain!

Even then, he couldn’t expel the black energy and was only able to barely keep it away. But based on the rapid speed the black energy was devouring everything, it would take over a dozen breaths of time at most for the black energy to reach him.

Yang Ye’s sword intent and slaughter intent gradually lessened, and his Sword Domain was on the verge of shattering.

However, the sword intent and slaughter intent he emanated was growing increasingly stronger!

Because it was growing increasingly dangerous!

The black energy was growing closer and closer while Yang Ye’s aura and sword intent were growing stronger and stronger.

Monarch Stared at Yang Ye. Yang Ye’s Fate Sword Dao could be said to be at 30% strength right now, and according to his estimations, if the black energy were to get close to Yang Ye before it arrived to around 70% strength, then Yang Ye would definitely die!

At the center of the energy, Yang Ye frowned because he noticed that his Sword Domain was failing him. The Sword Domain was crumbling before the black energy even got close to him.

The Death Energy, Yin Energy, and Foul Energy were truly overbearing!

Now that all three had been merged into one, his sword couldn’t destroy them at all.

The entire area entered into a rare moment of quiet. The energy around Yang Ye was getting closer and closer to him, and they were just a little over 1m away from him. As for the sword intent and slaughter intent he was emanating, they couldn’t stop the energy at all.

Yang Ye suddenly swung his sword.

Hiss!

The energy before him was sliced apart, but Yang Ye hadn’t even been able to leave the area before the energy returned to its previous state!

The energy was extremely close to him now!

As for Yang Ye’s sword intent and slaughter intent, they still couldn’t overcome the black energy!

A short while later, the energy had enveloped Yang Ye.

Monarch Yan heaved a sigh of relief from the sight of this. He’d exposed his trump card, and he’d been able to kill Yang Ye in the end.

However, a sword howl suddenly revived the worries Monarch Yan had been relieved of just a moment ago.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Horrifying sounds of something being sliced apart resounded before Monarch Yan.

He watched as the black energy was sliced into countless tiny pieces by rays of sword energy. At the same time, a ray of sword energy shot toward him!

The Fate Sword Dao!

At the instant the black energy had fully enveloped him, Yang Ye truly sensed the aura of death, and he practically instinctively drew his sword.

It was the Life and Death Technique!

Either the black energy was obliterated or he would die.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Obviously, the Fate Sword Dao had the advantage.

After he sliced up the black energy, Yang Ye didn’t stop and seized the opportunity to attack Monarch Yan.

This attack of his could be described as the peak of his attacks!

Monarch Yan’s pupils constricted because it was stronger than any other attack he’d faced from Yang Ye.

If he couldn’t stop it, he would die!

A pike appeared in his right grasp, and he touched his left index and middle finger against the center of his forehead, “Spirit Ascent!”

Boom!

As soon as he said that, a terrifying aura swept out from him, and it wasn’t any weaker to the aura of Yang Ye’s attack!

Obviously, he’d used some kind of secret technique to forcibly increase his strength!

The attack arrived, and his pike shot forward.

Bang!

A deafening explosion resounded through the starry sky, and then a figure was blasted away.

Monarch Yan!

As his figure flew backward, mouthfuls of blood sprayed from him in succession. His body was covered in injuries as if he’d been sliced open by a thousand blades!

As for Yang Ye, there was half a pike stabbed in his left shoulder, and there was energy coming from it that was ceaselessly damaging his body.

Fortunately, Yang Ye had Primordial Violet Energy and Snowy, so he didn’t fear the energy!

Yang Ye shook his shoulder.

Hiss!

The pike shot out from him, and his injury healed in practically an instant!

However, the aura he emanated had returned to normal.

The Fate Sword Dao wasn’t able to display its might without him being in a situation of life and death.

“The Fate Sword Dao! It’s amazing indeed! Cough…” Monarch Yan spoke abruptly from afar, “Your Three Dimensional Universe is truly full of geniuses.”

There was slight envy in his eyes.

The Three Dimensional Universe had Destiny, the sword cultivator in cloud white robes, and Yang Ye. Fortunately, the strongest among them, Destiny, had no intention to protect the Three Dimensional Universe anymore.

Otherwise, only despair would be left for the Four Dimensional Universe.

Yang Ye walked slowly to Monarch Yan. He still felt some respect for Monarch Yan because the latter had kneeled to Destiny for the Four Dimensional Universe’s sake. Just that was worthy of respect.

But while he respected Monarch Yan, he still intended to kill him!

They were on different sides!

Suddenly, Snowy appeared before Yang Ye. Yang Ye was quite surprised by the sight of her, “What are you doing out here?”

Snowy blinked, cracked a smile, and then pulled her paws in opposite directions. A fiery red bolt of lightning appeared between her paws.

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Monarch Yan’s expression was extremely unsightly from the sight of it. It naturally hurt for him. Because that bolt of divine lightning had been with him for countless years. Moreover, it was a precious treasure of the Four Dimensional Universe.

Yet now, it was gone!

It was equivalent to giving it to Snowy for free!

Suddenly, Yang Ye sent Snowy back into the Primordial Pagoda and vanished on the spot.

Monarch Yan’s pupils constricted. All he could see was a ray of sword energy.

Monarch Yan clenched his right fist slowly. As soon as it was fully clenched, blood seeped out from all over his body. The injuries he sustained earlier were still there. After all, he didn’t have Yang Ye’s terrifying recovery!

When Yang Ye’s sword arrived before him, Monarch Yan suddenly slammed his fist forward.

It was like a volcanic eruption, and a wave of powerful energy erupted from it.

Hiss!

The energy was instantly sliced into two. At the same time, Monarch Yan was blasted away while leaving an arm behind.

Yang Ye looked up at Monarch Yan’s figure in the distance. He was about to attack again when Monarch Yan’s voice resounded abruptly, “Activate the formation!”

A formation?

Yang Ye frowned. Suddenly, a huge barrier of light soundlessly appeared behind Monarch Yan, and then Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically as she shot backward.

Because a beam of light was surging at him from the center of the barrier of light.

It was so fast that it far surpassed his expectations!

Yang Ye practically instinctively swung his sword.

Bang!

The beam shook violently, but Yang Ye was blasted far away. Moreover, the beam still didn’t shatter and was ceaselessly forcing him backward!

Yang Ye pressed his sword against the beam, and the powerful energy it contained ceaselessly slammed against Yang Ye’s sword. His entire arm started to crack open slowly, and it wasn’t just his arm, even his sword was cracking.

A black sword shot out from Yang Ye’s waist, and it slashed the beam of light.

Bang!

The beam of light shook violently, but it didn’t shatter. Meanwhile, Yang Ye had retreated far away and was in the Three Dimensional Universe again. He was in the sky above Universe City.

Countless looked up at Yang Ye, and their expressions changed when they noticed the state he was in!

Suddenly, Yang Ye stomped his right foot down.

Bang!

The sky shook, and he held the Sword Precursor with both hands as he slammed it against the beam of light.

Hiss!

The sword sliced into the beam of light, but just a moment later, it exploded.

Boom!

Yang Ye was blasted to the ground by the explosion. As soon as he landed there, the ground beneath him collapsed into a huge abyss!

The beam of light was extremely powerful!

Yang Ye glanced at his right hand, and he couldn’t feel it anymore.

Meanwhile, a huge barrier of light appeared in the air above them. It was like a mirror in space, and it just stood there across the sky and enveloped the ruins of Universe City.

A formation!

The Three Dimensional Universe wasn’t the only one with a formation, the Four Dimensional Universe had one too. Moreover, its might was absolutely formidable!

Yang Ye gazed at Ding Shaoyao who was standing by his side, and she spoke solemnly, “Can you stop that formation?”

Yang Ye glanced at it and shook his head. He could go against it, but the problem was that doing so would allow Monarch Yan to do as he pleased. Under such circumstances, they would still suffer a crushing defeat!

Besides him, no one else could fight Monarch Yan!

Yang Ye glanced at the huge barrier of light and said, “Move everyone to Eternal Border!”

Ding Shaoyao nodded, and then the Destiny Realm experts fighting throughout the surrounding skies retreated.

Meanwhile, the huge barrier of light in the sky started shaking violently.

Yang Ye summoned Snowy and pointed at the huge barrier of light. She glanced at it, hesitated for a moment, and then pointed at it.

Yang Ye’s face fell.

The formation’s core and foundation weren’t here, they were in the Four Dimensional Universe. So, besides brute force, the only other way to destroy the formation was to travel to the Four Dimensional Universe. If they were in the Four Dimensional Universe, Snowy could destroy it from its core!

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something at this point and gazed abruptly at Ding Shaoyao, “Where’s my ancestor?”

He hadn’t seen Jian Wudi from the moment he emerged from his meditative state.

Something was off!

Ding Shaoyao pondered deeply for a moment and said, “He’s gone!”

Yang Ye was stunned!
