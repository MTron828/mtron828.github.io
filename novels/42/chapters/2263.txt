Chapter 2264 – I Don’t Want to Die Yet!

At this critical moment, a palm suddenly pressed down on An Nanjing’s shoulder, and then a voice entered her ear, “I-I don’t want to die yet!”

An Nanjing stopped.

The faint flames around her were extinguished.

It was Yang Ye who’d said those words!

She turned to the side and saw a ghastly pale face.

Yang Ye took her hand and cracked a smile, “D-Don’t do something stupid. I-I don’t want to die yet. Alright?”

She gazed at him for a long time and nodded, “Alright!”

Meanwhile, ten arrows shot over from afar.

An Nanjing turned to the side and swung Blazing Fury in a horizontal sweep.

Bang!

The arrows were stopped in their path, but An Nanjing and Yang Ye were blasted over 3km away.

Meanwhile, those ten experts were about to attack again when Yang Ye suddenly pulled An Nanjing behind him, and the Sword Supreme in his grasp let out a sword howl.

The figures of those ten experts stiffened slightly.

They hadn’t forgotten how Yang Ye had slaughtered their companions!

Yang Ye raised his hand slowly and pointed his sword at them, “Continue if you want to die!”

They didn’t cower before him!

They drew their bows at the exact same time and released their arrows. Ten arrows simultaneously flashed forward like shooting stars.

Yang Ye’s ghastly pale face turned ferocious at this instant, and he stomped his right foot down.

Bang!

The space beneath him instantly collapsed!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye relied on the counterforce to shoot forward. The arrows were instantly obliterated before him, and he appeared above one of them.

The Sword Supreme descended!

At the instant that happened, a mouthful of blood sprayed from Yang Ye’s mouth.

The Sword Domain!

He’d used the Sword Domain again!

Hiss!

The black robed expert didn’t even have the chance to resist before he was instantly sliced into two. But at the exact same instant, numerous arrows appeared before Yang Ye. At the critical moment, Yang Ye moved his head to the side and dodge two of them, but the rest pierced through his chest.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted far away!

As soon as he stopped himself, a few more arrows shot at him.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing appeared before Yang Ye, and she waved Burning Fury in a horizontal sweep.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

The arrows were blasted away, but so were Yang Ye and her.

The 9 remaining experts didn’t stop. They drew their bows again and planned to release another volley at Yang Ye and AN Nanjing. However, a few black shadows suddenly descended from the sky.

They were Master Tian and the nine Undead Warriors!

An Nanjing’s face fell from the sight of this.

Now, they really had no chance.

Meanwhile, a black robed figure appeared before them.

It was the Universe Sprite!

She closed her eyes slowly and said, “Tell him to take good care of Snowy and the Sprites of this large universe. Otherwise, I won’t forgive him, even in death!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

She slowly raised both her hands once she finished speaking.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

In an instant, the space here started rippling, and then countless strands of energy converged from all over the world. More and more converged until it was like a myriad of rivers converging into the ocean as they converged into the Universe Sprite.

If someone looked down from outside the large universe, one would notice that the large universe was being destroyed at a visible rate.

She was taking the last bit of spirit energy and power the large universe had!

An Nanjing gazed at her with astonishment, “You…”

The Universe Sprite removed her mask slowly, and beneath it was an ethereal face. This ethereal face had a bleak smile on it, “In any case, the large universe is dead, and I’m just killing it completely. From now onward, this large universe will cease to exist.”

As soon as she finished speaking, her body turned completely ethereal.

Boom!

A moment later, a terrifying wave of energy swept out from her, and she instantly vanished.

The energy instantly swept over to Master Tian’s group and enveloped them.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Rumbling explosions resounded incessantly.

The Universe Sprite had used herself as the medium to converge the last remaining energy within the large universe. It could be said to have instantly sped up the speed at which the large universe was dying. Actually, it hadn’t just sped it up, it had killed the large universe completely.

However, she’s used that energy to release an absolutely destructive wave of energy!

It was so strong that it caused that expanse of space to turn into an expanse of death.

There was no matter at all there, only destruction.

However, Master Tian’s group hadn’t been annihilated.

The nine archers were gone, but Master Tian and the nine Undead Warriors were still alive. Especially those nine Undead Warriors. Their joint forces were even capable of killing Xiao Lou.

While they had survived, they were heavily injured!

The Universe Sprite’s attack was no different than a self-detonation!

Master Tian wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and looked up at Yang Ye and An Nanjing, “Yang Ye, I didn’t expect Lord Xiao Lou to die at your hands!”

Yang Ye didn’t say anything as he stood behind An Nanjing. At this moment, he was madly utilizing Primordial Violet Energy to heal himself. As for An Nanjing, she stood before him and gazed coldly at Master Tian’s group without revealing the slightest fear.

Master Tian walked closer to them and said, “Who can save you now?”

Bang!

Suddenly, a strand of flames appeared here.

Master Tian’s expression changed slightly, and he instantly moved 3km away!

A ball of flames floated not too far away from Yang Ye.

It was the Samadhi Flame.

Master Tian had a wisp of fear in his eyes as he gazed at the Samadhi Flame. While Yang Ye had used the Samadhi Flame in the past, he’d only used its strength, and that was far inferior when compared to the Samadhi Flame itself. The Samadhi Flame itself felt dangerous to Master Tian.

The Samadhi Flame transformed into a middle aged man, and the middle aged man had blazing flames around him. He glanced at Yang Ye and said, “I’m leaving!”

Yang Ye opened his eyes to gaze at the Samadhi Flame, and the latter pondered deeply for a moment and said, “If it were just them, I wouldn’t mind paying a certain price. Unfortunately…”

It shook its head and transformed into a ray of light that vanished into space.

It had left!

The Samadhi Flame had chosen to leave!

Yang Ye remained silent.

The Samadhi Flame had an agreement with him to stay with him for a few years. But it had left now. He didn’t hate the Samadhi Flame because it was a very normal thing to do. It would never die with him.

Now, only An Nanjing was left here!

Of course, he still had Snowy, Su Qingshi, and the others who were within the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he gazed at An Nanjing. In his heart, he felt helpless, extremely helpless.

An Nanjing could leave, but she chose to stay. Now, they were probably going to die together. Yang Ye had done all he could to fight against the undying race.

“Kill!” Suddenly, a furious howl resounded from far away.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing looked over, and they saw countless charging over. They were the others who hadn’t been able to escape. All of them charged at Master Tian’s group.

A cold glow flashed through Master Tian’s eyes, “Ants!”

He was about to attack once he finished speaking, but the stomach of the cultivator at the front of the group suddenly started swelling up.

Boom!

A moment later, a terrifying wave of energy swept at him!

Self-detonation!

He hadn’t expected that fellow to detonate himself. But just a moment later, a cold smile arose on Master Tian’s lips. Self-detonation? They were still ants to him, even if they detonated themselves!

However, countless others started detonating themselves as well!

Master Tian was stunned!

One after the other started detonating themselves, and countless waves of energy erupted like volcanoes at Master Tian’s group.

Master Tian’s group weren’t the only ones who were stunned, Yang Ye and An Nanjing were stunned too.

Self-detonation!

All of them had chosen to detonate themselves!

Self-detonation was no joke, it would lead to absolute obliteration! Yet they had actually chosen to detonate themselves!

The detonation of a single one of them was naturally no threat to Master Tian’s group. After all, it was impossible for them to compare with the Universe Sprite who’d converged the energy of this large universe. But what if countless detonated themselves!

Even Master Tian was visibly moved by this scene. Not to mention the current state he was in, it would be difficult for him to resist even at his prime!

Suddenly, the nine Undead Warriors appeared before Master Tian, and then they took a step forward and swung their sabers.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Nine rays of saber energy flashed. Everywhere they passed, everything was sliced open. However, too, too many were detonating themselves, so the converged force of this was absolutely impossible for them to slice apart in an instant!

In an instant, Master Tian’s group were enveloped by the force of the explosions.

Bang! Bang!

Explosions resounded incessantly.

However, the self-detonations didn’t end. One after the other were still charging at Master Tian’s group and detonating themselves.

Only the sounds of explosions resounded incessantly throughout the world!
