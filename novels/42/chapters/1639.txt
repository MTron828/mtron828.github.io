Chapter 1640 - Beastform!

Translator: InVader

Swift!

Exceedingly swift!

Yang Ye finally understood how powerful Zenith Rank treasures were. Because his speed had really been at his limits just now. It could be said that if he activated the boots, then ordinary Zenith Realm experts couldn’t compete with his speed.

Experts able to attain the Zenith Realm represented that they’d attained the limits of their ability in all aspects. However, there were differences in strength between Zenith Realm experts. So, what did that represent? It represented that not all Zenith Realm experts were truly at the zenith. It meant that not all of them had truly reached their limits.

It was like two tigers. If one grew up in the forest but the other grew up in captivity, then while they were both tigers, which one would win in a one on one battle?

The answer was obvious.

The boots clearly were at the true zenith. So, unless he encountered one of those Zenith Realm experts who had attained the true extremes of their ability, he could fully surpass the speed of all other Zenith Realm experts. The only sad part was that he could only gain such speed once a day.

However, he was satisfied.

Because it could play a decisive role at the critical moment or even save his life.

Yang Ye knew that Gu Xiu had done something to the boots, but he didn’t do anything to it because he didn’t want to alarm Gu Xiu.

Since they wanted to use him, then he could use them as well.

After he recovered his profound energy, Yang Ye went to see Snowy and Zi’er. At this moment, Snowy was flying around while holding onto the wooden sword. As for Zi’er, she was cultivating.

Regardless of whether it was Zi’er, Xiao Yuxi, Zhuang Weiran, Su Qingshi, or the others, all of them were working hard on their cultivation. Perhaps they couldn’t help Yang Ye, but if they didn’t cultivate, then they would definitely be unable to stay by Yang Ye’s side for too long.

Lifespan!

They weren’t the only ones. It was the same for everyone else in the world. If they didn’t want to die, then they had to work hard on cultivating and attain a higher realm of cultivation in order to gain more lifespan.

Snowy waved her claw when she saw Yang Ye, and the wooden sword instantly brought her over to Yang Ye. After that, she flashed over to Yang Ye, and then she wrapped her claws around Yang Ye’s face and rubbed her head against his cheek.

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head gently, and then he gazed at the wooden sword that was floating not too far away from him. As if it noticed his gaze, the wooden sword shook abruptly, and light flickered on it.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched at the sight of this, and he quickly made his profound energy surge. Meanwhile, Snowy appeared on the wooden sword, and she patted it gently with both claws.

It didn’t take long for the wooden sword to calm down slowly.

Yang Ye glanced at it, and then he glanced at Snowy, “Why is it so hostile towards me?”

He really couldn’t figure out what was wrong with the wooden sword because it wanted to hit him on sight.

Snowy flew over to Yang Ye and started waving her claws about.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye’s face to become quite unsightly. Because Snowy said he had slaughter intent, and that was why the sword was hostile towards him!

What the hell! Yang Ye cursed in his heart. It’s trying to be righteous?!

Yang Ye glanced at the wooden sword, and then he gazed at Snowy, “Help me ask it why it chose to come with me if it hates me.”

Snowy blinked and flew over to the wooden sword. A short while passed before she flew over to Yang Ye again, and then she started waving her claws again.

A short while passed, and then Yang Ye’s face grew even more unsightly.

He’d thought the wooden sword had come with him because of what he’d said that day, but that wasn’t it at all. The reason it had left with him was because he had something that drew its attention.

Obviously, it was the Primordial Pagoda!

It had come with him because of the Primordial Pagoda and not him!

Yang Ye glanced at the wooden sword. He hadn’t expected it to have actually been able to sense the Primordial Pagoda’s presence.

Where did this wooden sword come from?

What rank of quality is it? It’s definitely far above the Zenith Rank!

Yang Ye shook his head and restrained his thoughts. Thinking about all of that was pointless, and he didn’t want to waste his time on the wooden sword. Even though his strength would rise tremendously if he could take control of the sword, the problem was that it would definitely not allow him to take control of it for now.

He could use force on the demon beasts, but he didn’t want to use force on the sword. Or it should be said that he wanted to use his own strength to subdue it and not rely on the Primordial Pagoda to accomplish that. Swords weren’t like demon beasts. A good sword would rather break than bend!

Yang Ye played with Snowy for a while, and then he left and went to see Qiong Qi who he hadn’t seen for a long time.

“Kid, you’ve grown stronger again.” These were the first words Qiong Qi said to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at Qiong Qi, “How much of your strength have you recovered?”

Qiong Qi replied, “90%!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Yang Ye puckered his lips and said, “Brother, don’t blame me for being frank. You have recovered 90% of your strength, but as far as I’m concerned, your current strength is only equivalent to an ordinary Zenith Realm expert. So, even if you recover your full strength, you’ll be equivalent to a Zenith Realm expert that has truly reached the zenith in every aspect. It makes me wonder if the standard of experts in the large universe is low, or are you weak…?”

“Nonsense!” Qiong Qi shouted angrily, “What do you know?! Do you know what recovering my full strength means?”

Yang Ye quickly asked, “What does it mean?”

“It means I can fucking utilize my divine ability!” Qiong Qi spoke angrily, “Every powerful demon beast has their own divine ability. Do you know what mine is?!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t. Tell me. Let’s see if it’s powerful.”

“Beastform!” Qiong Qi continued angrily, “My divine ability is Beastform. After I transform, my body will grow more than ten times larger. Besides that, my defense and speed will rise tremendously. At that time, trash like Zenith Realm experts wouldn’t even be able to take a single slap of mine! Besides that, I have another divine ability.”

Yang Ye quickly asked, “What is it?”

Qiong Qi grunted coldly, “I’m not going to tell you. It’s my trump card! I have to keep it a secret! If we become enemies, I wouldn’t even have a trump card. I have to take some precautions against you!”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he said, “Qiong Qi, that hurts me quite a bit. Look, since the day we met, we can be considered to have gone through thick and thin together. So…”

“Just cut the crap!” Qiong Qi waved his claw, “You’re extremely shameless. You might betray me at any moment. So, I have to take some precautions.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi continued, “You didn’t come here to talk. Tell me why you’re here.”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “I’m sure you’re aware that the fight for succession is about to begin. So, I may need your help.”

Qiong Qi fell silent for a moment and said, “Kid, you have to be careful. Even though the experts here can’t compare to the experts of the large universe, they aren’t weak. Even during my prime, I didn’t dare to underestimate some of the experts here. For example, that fellow, Wu Mu, from the Wu Clan. Even if he came to the large universe, he would definitely be an extraordinary figure.”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “I know. I’m still quite weak, and that aunt of mine and those people standing behind her have ill intent towards me. So, Brother, I’m in quite a dangerous situation.”

Qiong Qi glanced at Yang Ye and spoke indifferently, “What does that have to do with me?!”

Yang Ye didn’t know what to say.

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi added, “Kid, you aren’t really strong, but your ability to cause trouble is truly formidable. Let me warn you in advance, I’ll run if the trouble you cause is too serious.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Brother, you’re the only one I can rely on. I’ll be killed if even you run away.”

Qiong Qi spoke angrily, “Don’t act like you’re so pitiable. You’re extremely tenacious. You would still be alive even if I’m dead.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Qiong Qi waved his claw, “Every time I see you, I feel like I’m going to suffer from misfortune. Get away from me.”

Yang Ye’s face was utterly dark. But when he thought about it, it did make sense. Qiong Qi really had almost died on many occasions because of him.

Yang Ye felt quite guilty when he thought about this, and then he said, “Brother Qiong Qi, I’m sorry. Staying with me really is…”

Qiong Qi suddenly said, “Don’t try to play the emotion card on me. Fuck off or I’ll attack!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s expression changed, and then he vanished on the spot and arrived in the outside world.

As soon as he arrived in the outside world, Yang Xuan appeared before him.

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

Yang Xuan spoke in a low voice, “Yang Yan and the others are aware of your identity.”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed, “How did they find out?”

Yang Xuan shook her head, “I don’t know.”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “If they know, then they know.”

Yang Xuan hesitated for a moment and said, “There’s one more thing…”

Yang Ye asked, “What?”

Yang Xuan fell silent for a moment and said, “You have to stay calm, alright?”

Yang Ye's eyes narrowed slightly while a bad feeling arose in his heart.

Meanwhile, Yang Xuan said, “Yang Yan has hung Little Sky’s soul outside Phecda City. He said that he’ll dismember her to death if you don’t show yourself.”

Yang Ye looked Yang Xuan in the eye for a long time, and then he turned around and left.

Suddenly, Yang Xuan obstructed Yang Ye’s path, “Don’t be rash. They’re drawing you out on purpose. Many experts are definitely lying in ambush outside the city. If you do, they’ll definitely annihilate you. So, give priority to the overall situation!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she waved her right hand and five Zenith Realm experts instantly appeared around Yang Ye.

Yang Ye walked over to Yang Xuan, “Move… aside…”

Yang Xuan looked him in the eye, “No!”
