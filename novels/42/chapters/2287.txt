Chapter 2288 – Snowy’s Treasures!

Sword Scroll remained emotionless and no one knew what she was thinking.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and suddenly looked up. He cracked a smile, “Aren’t you afraid of death? You’ve gotten so close to me!”

Bang! Bang!

Two terrifying intents swept out from within him, and a sword slashed down from above the beautiful woman’s head.

The Sword Domain combined with both intents!

The beautiful woman’s expression changed drastically, but she was prepared for this. Numerous blood red flowers appeared around her, and they seemed bloody and gorgeous like they were made from blood itself! When Yang Ye’s sword descended, they swiftly transformed into rays of blood red light that exploded apart.

BOOM!

The beautiful woman was blasted far away, and there were petals all around the area before Yang Ye.

As soon as she stopped herself, a few mouthfuls of blood sprayed from her mouth, and then a ray of sword energy suddenly appeared above her.

Another attack!

Her pupils constricted as she flipped her palms. In an instant, a blood red crystalline flower bloomed on her palm, and then countless rays of red light moved along her body and surged up into the air.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

In an instant, the space around them was obliterated.

Bang!

Another explosion resounded, and then the woman was blasted away.

Another mouthful of blood sprayed from her when she stopped herself. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot.

She glanced at the surroundings, “My Luoli Clan will withdraw if you still don’t help!”

As soon as she said that, Hanyuan Shu and the others vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye frowned slightly, and then he swung his sword in a circle around him.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted far away.

The joint forces of four True Dao Realm experts!

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and a ferocious expression filled his eyes, “Come! Let’s continue!”

The four of them didn’t waste their breaths and just charged at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyes were blood red while countless strands of sword intent and slaughter intent swept out from him. However, the auras of the four True Dao Realm experts around him completely suppressed the intents he released!

He was being completely suppressed!

It didn’t take long for them to arrive before him.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted away.

It was utter suppression!

They didn’t stop and charged at Yang Ye again.

Snowy was absolutely anxious from the sight of this. She flew over to Sword Scroll and pointed at Yang Ye with a face full of anxiety.

Sword Scroll glanced at Snowy and said, “There’s a price to pay for being rash. Let him experience that price.”

Snowy clearly understood her and glared fiercely at her. After that, she gazed at the four of them, glanced at the Sword Gourd, and hesitated. She was a little against fighting.

Bang!

Suddenly, Yang Ye was blasted away and blood sprayed from his mouth.

Snowy was furious from the sight of this, and she slapped the Sword Gourd. In an instant, a ray of sword energy shot out from it, and it tore through everything before it!

The black clothed old man who was about to pursue Yang Ye suddenly turned around, and the sword energy was in front of him.

The old man’s expression changed and slapped his palm forward.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the old man was blasted away!

The old man glanced at his palm as he stood far away. It was gone, and the sight of his missing palm shocked the old man. He looked up at Snowy, and the latter blinked and pointed at the old man.

A sword howl resounded, and then a ray of sword energy slashed at the old man, causing the latter’s expression to change slightly as he clenched his left fist and slammed it forward.

Bang!

The sword energy still remained, but the old man was blasted away.

Snowy was delighted by the sight of this, and she planned to point at him again. However, the old man suddenly appeared before Snowy and slapped his palm at her.

Snowy was stunned, and then she shook the Sword Gourd. In an instant, another ray of sword energy flashed out of it while accompanied by a sword howl that resounded through the surroundings. The black man was immediately blasted away once more!

The old man looked down at his chest once he stopped himself, and he noticed a deep gash in his chest. Blood was surging incessantly like a fountain from within it.

At this moment, the old man had an unprecedentedly solemn expression on his face. He gazed at Snowy, or to be more precise, he gazed at the Sword Gourd in Snowy’s paws. Suddenly, Snowy raised her pawn and pointed, causing the old man’s expression to change, “Deal with that little bastard first! Don’t let that gourd fall into Yang Ye’s hands!”

He charged forward once he finished speaking.

The gourd!

Hanyuan Shu and the others glanced at Snowy, and then Hanyuan Shu abandoned attacking Yang Ye and charged at Snowy.

Obviously, they’d noticed what had happened over there, and they knew it wasn’t Snowy who was strong, it was the gourd. If that gourd fell into Yang Ye’s hands, then the consequences…

Snowy panicked when she saw Hanyuan Shu charge at her, and so she waved her paw wildly, causing another ray of sword energy to shoot at Hanyuan Shu. However, Hanyuan Shu and the old man had joined forces, so both the rays of sword energy were suppressed. A short while later, Hanyuan Shu was able to keep the two rays of sword energy busy while the old man flashed over to Snowy and slapped his palm at her.

Snowy shuddered. She slapped the Sword Gourd with everything she had, but no other sword energy came out from within it.

Ferocity filled the old man’s eyes, “Die!”

His palm descended.

Sword Scroll was about to help when her expression suddenly changed and disbelief filled her eyes.

“AH!” A shrill cry resounded, and a figure was blasted away.

It was the old man!

The old man stopped himself around 10km away, and his entire left arm and his body below it were gone.

Snowy had a gourd tied to her waist, and she was holding an ethereal axe in her paws.

Snowy was trembling as she held it. She was very afraid.

The old man glanced at his body, gulped, and then looked up at Snowy. His voice trembled as he asked, “H-How many divine treasures do you possess?”
