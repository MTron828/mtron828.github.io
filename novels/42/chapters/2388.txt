Chapter 2389 – Erya the Terrifying!

Yang Ye and Sword Scroll didn’t stop the fight because they wanted to see if they could figure out Erya’s true identity.

What was her origins?

Both of them were very curious!

Meanwhile, the dragon’s claw had arrived above Erya, and powerful Dragon Pressure was simply capable of destroying everything.

Suddenly, Erya formed claws with her hands, and then she stomped her right foot down and shot up into the air. An instant later, a small claw slammed against the center of the Primal True Dragon’s claw!

The difference between the dragon claw and the small claw was like the difference between a human and an ant. It was amusing and absurd!

However, such a small claw had forcefully stopped the dragon claw. Moreover, at that same instant, the Dragon Pressure was obliterated completely/

No, it hadn’t been obliterated!

It had been devoured!

Yang Ye noticed to his shock that Erya had completely devoured all the Dragon Pressure! At the same time, the dragon claw cracked open!

The Primal True Dragon was shocked and planned to pull its claw back. However, Erya stomped her right foot down, and she formed a beautiful arc as she arrived before the dragon.

She just gazed at it, face to face, and being stared at by Erya made the dragon panic slightly. However, it was very well aware that begging for mercy wouldn’t work right now. It could only fight!

Glory or humiliation depended on this battle!

The Primal True Dragon howled with fury and slammed its head at Erya. The powerful impact of it caused the space in the sky to tremble violently.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Erya didn’t try to dodge it and just slammed a punch at the dragon.

Bang!

The punch forced the Primal True Dragon to a stop, and the scales throughout its body actually exploded apart at the exact same moment!

Blood sprayed!

Erya suddenly became excited when she saw the blood. Actually, she could be said to have gone into a frenzy. She flashed over to the dragon’s back and punches rained down upon it.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Every punch she swung would make the Primal True Dragon shrink slightly! During this time, the dragon did try to fight back. Unfortunately, no matter how it fought back, it was futile before Erya’s punches!

As her punches rained down upon it, it grew smaller and smaller, and its body was covered in injuries!

In just a short while, the dragon had returned to its normal size. Suddenly, Erya stopped punching, and then opened her mouth and sucked the dragon into her stomach!

Yang Ye and Sword Scroll’s expressions changed drastically when they witnessed this, and even Snowy was stunned. She ate it? She really ate it?

Meanwhile, a chill ran down Oxxy’s spine!

Yang Ye and Sword Scroll appeared before Erya at practically the exact same moment. She blinked when she saw them, “Big Brother Yang! Big Sister Sword Scroll!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Erya, it’s still a child. Children should just be taught a lesson when they’re mischievous. Right?”

She smiled, “Why teach them a lesson when you can just eat them, then they won’t be mischievous anymore. Isn’t that great?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Give me some face and let it go!”

Meanwhile, Snowy went over to her and touched Erya’s stomach. After that, she gazed at Erya while obviously asking her if it was tasty!

Yang Ye slapped Snowy on the butt. The little fellow was still asking her if it was tasty at a time like this… Yang Ye really wondered how fearless Snowy was.

Snowy cracked a smile at Yang Ye, and then she gazed at Erya. She pointed at Erya’s stomach to tell Erya that she couldn’t eat the dragon.

Erya puckered her lips, “But I’m very hungry!”

Snowy thought for a moment and stretched out her paw toward Erya. There was a tanghulu there.

Erya felt quite helpless. She took it and spat toward the side, and a ray of golden light shot out from her mouth. The Primal True Dragon had been spat out on the ground!

At this moment, it was in a miserable state. Its entire body was covered in injuries, and there wasn’t a single intact scale on it. Besides that, no one knew what it had encountered within Erya’s body, but it seemed to be on the verge of death. It may have died if it was spat out just a moment later!

Yang Ye glanced at Erya, and he knew she was really eating the dragon!

She wasn’t joking!

Yang Ye didn’t blame her. After all, she was no human, and so she couldn’t be judged based on human standards. In the demon race, powerful demons would absolutely not allow other demons to provoke them, and if a weaker demon provoked a stronger demon, it was definitely no different than asking for death! As for the Primal True Dragon, it had really been asking for death. Of course, Yang Ye could understand its feelings. After all, it was a Primal True Dragon, so it naturally had to fight back when it was bullied like this!

Unfortunately, Erya was stronger!

Erya licked the tanghulu, hesitated for a moment, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “Big Brother Yang, you won’t let me eat this fellow, then can you find me something else to eat? Tanghulus can’t fill my stomach at all!”

They weren’t filling!

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “Erya, do you like to eat demon beasts?”

Erya hurriedly nodded. She pointed at the Primal True Dragon, “Demons like it will fill my stomach, and they’re very tasty too. I’ll even grow stronger from eating them. Big Brother Yang, how about you just let me eat it?”

The Primal True Dragon’s body twitched, and it fainted from fear!

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Erya, you can’t just try to eat someone else because you’re hungry, right?”

She felt quite helpless, “But I’ll be very hungry if I don’t eat them.”

She glanced at the dragon and continued, “Moreover, I think it exists to be my food!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Snowy blinked and gazed at the dragon.

It’s for Erya to eat?

Actually, Snowy was very curious, she was curious about whether the Primal True Dragon was really as delicious as Erya made it seem? And she was considering giving it a try!

If the dragon knew what Snowy was thinking, it wouldn’t have just gone unconscious from fear, it would have died from fear!

Snowy didn’t just eat it, Snowy would eat its spirit, and that was more terrifying than Erya!

A chill ran down Yang Ye’s spin when he heard her. The Primal True Dragon was for her to eat?

Meanwhile, Sword Scroll’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s head, “It’s normal. It’s the food chain. In the eyes of wolves, sheep are there for them to eat. Right?”

The food chain!

Yang Ye gazed at Erya again. He had no doubt that Erya was higher up on the food chain than the Primal True Dragon!

Yang Ye sighed softly. Actually, he didn’t know what he should do with her nature. The demon world had its own laws of survival, and so did the human world. Using the laws of the human world on Erya was clearly unsuitable. However, since she was with him, he had the responsibility to make her at least a little “human”. Fortunately, she had the conscience and humanity of a human. Otherwise, it would have been impossible for her to become friends with Oxxy or spare the Primal True Dragon!

However, it wouldn’t work if he allowed this to continue for long!

“Big Brother Yang, I’m going to play with Snowy!” Meanwhile, Erya spoke abruptly, and then she waved at Snowy and pranced off into the distance.

Snowy cracked a smile at Yang Ye, and then she followed after Erya. Oxxy naturally followed right behind Snowy.

Oxxy felt both respect and fear toward Erya. However, as far as he was concerned, Erya was actually very good. Oxxy felt the Primal True Dragon wasn’t bad either, but it didn’t know how to keep a low profile!

Only Yang Ye and Sword Scroll remained here.

They glanced at the dragon on the ground and felt quite helpless.

Yang Ye walked over to it and placed his palm against its stomach. Primordial Violet Energy surged incessantly into it, and the dragon immediately seemed much better.

Yang Ye shook his head and gazed at Sword Scroll, “What is Erya’s true form? Even a Primal True Dragon was completely suppressed by her!”

Sword Scroll fell silent for a long time and said, “She may be from before the Primal Era, a…”

She stopped abruptly at this point.

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “What?”

Sword Scroll shook her head, “It’s impossible, absolutely impossible. Those creatures went extinct a long time ago. They have practically never been seen even in the Eternal Universe, so it’s impossible for one to be here in Eternal Border!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. He was just about to pursue an answer when he suddenly looked up, and then he returned to the outside world.

The door was being knocked!

Yang Ye opened it, and Ye Xiaotian was outside.

Ye Xiaotian smiled, “Senior, my father said he will see you now.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Thanks!”

She grinned, “It’s nothing! Come with me!”

As they traveled, she seemed to have thought of something and hurriedly said, “Senior, my father’s temper isn’t very good, so when you…”

Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t worry, my temper’s very good!”

She nodded, “That’s good to hear!”

It didn’t take long for them to enter a hall, and Yang Ye saw two middle aged men there. The middle aged man in the seat of the host wore a loose robe, and he seemed quite chubby, but there was a dignified expression on his face.

The other middle aged man was on the right of the host, and he wore a black robe. The black robed middle aged man had glanced at him when he entered just now.

There had been a trace of killing intent in that glance!

Yang Ye frowned and wondered why the middle aged man had the desire to kill him!

Meanwhile, the host spoke abruptly, “Xiaotian, you can leave. I want to have a talk with your friend!”

She hesitated for a moment and said, “Father, he’s my friend, so don’t try to scare him!”

The middle aged man smiled, “Of course!”

She only relaxed when she saw him smile, and then she turned around and left.

Once she left, the hall suddenly fell silent.

Yang Ye broke the silence first, “Senior, I’m here because I’d like your sect’s help. Of course, it won’t…”

“Help?” Suddenly, the black robed middle aged man laughed with ridicule, “You’re seeking help from the North Charge Sect? Who do you think you are? An ant at the True Dao Realm actually speaks of seeking help from the North Charge Sect. Do you even know your own limitations? Or perhaps your parents never taught you how to act? And they didn’t…”

A ray of light flashed!

The middle aged man’s voice stopped abruptly because a sword was pressed against his forehead!

Both middle aged men were stunned by this.

Yang Ye pressed his sword forward, causing it to pierce into the middle aged man’s flesh, and so blood flowed from his forehead.

Yang Ye looked the black robed middle aged man in the eyes, “This is something I learned on my own. Do you think it’s effective?”

He pushed his sword in a little more as he spoke.

Blood sprayed!
