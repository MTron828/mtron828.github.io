Chapter 1337 – Do Any Demons Dare To Fight Me?

The demon race was attacking!

Around a day later, the demon race’s army appeared a few dozen kilometers away.

The experts of the Sword Alliance had extremely solemn expressions on their faces as they gazed at the army. Actually, they should be said to have quite unsightly expressions on their faces. After Ye Liuyun shared information about the demon race throughout the city, they knew how terrifying the demon race’s army was. But now that they’d seen it with their own eyes, they realized that it was even more terrifying than described in the information. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Even if they were a few dozen kilometers away, the imposing aura from the army caused everyone throughout Doomsday City to feel oppressed.

The human army’s aura was far inferior to the demon army.

However, the humans didn’t fall into chaos. Because Ye Liuyun had already prepared them for this. So, they knew how formidable the demon race’s army was. Even though it was even stronger than they’d imagined, they were mentally prepared, so none were terrified by the army of demon beasts.

Ye Liuyun stood at the front of the group on the city walls. The Voiders of the 3 cities, 3 sects, and the Sword Alliance were standing behind her. As for her right and left, it was the Emperors of Doomsday City. As for the other Quasi Emperors, they were on the city walls as well, but they weren’t the main forces, and they were in-charge of providing backup.

Quasi Emperors were clearly not qualified to participate in such a battle.

At this moment, the army of demon beasts didn’t attack Doomsday City, and they just stopped a few dozen kilometers outside the city and seemed to be waiting for something.

Ye Liuyun had a solemn expression in her eyes as she gazed at the army in the distance. The army’s discipline was much better than she’d imagined. The army had stopped in the distance without moving or making any noise. Every single clan of demon beast was separated by a certain amount of distance. It didn’t look special if one looked casually, but if one looked carefully, one would notice that it actually seemed like a tactical formation that humans used.

Demon beasts that weren’t disciples and only knew how to charge forward weren’t terrifying at all; they would be terrifying if they were even more disciples than humans like the army before them.

“Miss Ye, why aren’t they attacking?” asked Lin Qian. During this time that he’d stayed in Doomsday City, he’d found out about the status Ye Liuyun had in Yang Ye’s heart and within the city. So, while she was just a Quasi Emperor, he didn’t dare to be impolite. Moreover, Ye Liuyun’s ability made him admire her as well.

Ye Liuyun fell silent for a short while before she said, “There are 2 possibilities for that. The first is that they intend to deter us and crush our mental defenses. The second possibility is that they are waiting. They are waiting for a moment to strike or something else.”

Lin Qian asked, “What should we do?”

“Just wait with them!” Ye Liuyun spoke in a low voice, “That’s the only thing we can do.” Her voice carried a trace of helplessness.

Presently, the human race’s strength was very inferior to the demon race. If they relied on the formations in Doomsday City, then they would be able to barely resist the demon race for some time. But if they didn’t have Doomsday City to rely on, then the human race would definitely be no match for the demon race.

Human Voiders could manage a close quarter battle, but the human Emperors might be completely crushed.

So, the demon race had the initiative. If it wanted to fight, the human race would have no choice but to fight; if it retreated, the human race would have no choice but to stop attacking. It couldn’t be helped. The human race couldn’t go head on against the demon race at all.

Lin Qian nodded and said, “Where’s Brother Yang?”

Ye Liuyun replied, “Still in closed door cultivation. Don’t worry, Senior Lin, he’s the master of the Sword Alliance, so he’s more concerned about our fate than anyone else.”

“I’m not worried about him running from a battle!” Lin Qian smiled, “I just feel that our morale is quite low, and he’ll definitely be able to boost our morale.”

Ye Liuyun smiled, “That’s true!”

Yang Ye was invincible in the hearts of everyone. Because none had ever seen him lose. Moreover, they’d watched him instantly annihilate Voiders with ease. It could be said that Yang Ye was the main reason why all the people in Doomsday City dared to fight the demon race to the death. Because they had hope while they had Yang Ye on their side!

Yang Ye’s influence hadn’t been gained in a day, and it had been accumulated gradually over time. Presently, Yang Ye wasn’t just the Sword Alliance’s pillar of mental support, he was the pillar of mental support for the entire human race!

Meanwhile, someone spoke abruptly, “The demon race seems to be moving!”

Ye Liuyun and the others looked up, and they saw the army of demon beasts pushing forward towards Doomsday City. Their march wasn’t quick, and it should be described as quite slow, but their march was orderly and extremely disciplined. As the army of demon beasts walked slowly in the city’s direction, a terrifying aura swept forward. The experts of Doomsday City instantly felt suffocated by the oppressive pressure coming from the army.

Ye Liuyun spoke solemnly, “Raise your defenses!”

As soon as she finished speaking, the experts on the city walls immediately released their auras to defend against the aura coming from the army of demon beasts. Even Lin Qian and the other Voiders released their auras. Because it was utterly impossible for just the auras of Emperors to resist the aura of the demon race’s army. So, they had to lend a hand.

The auras of both armies collided in the air outside Doomsday City, causing violent waves to ripple through the area. As the army of demon beasts marched closer towards the city, the aura emanated by the human army started to fall into a disadvantaged position. Moreover, many Emperors on the city walls had started to move backwards repeatedly.

Ye Liuyun’s voice resounded through the entire city, “Everyone! Fight together!”

It didn’t take long for auras to shoot up into the air throughout the city, and then they slammed down at the aura emanated by the army of demon beasts. How many residents did Doomsday City have? Almost 100 million. Their auras were mostly very weak, but when so many auras converged together....

Bang!

Countless auras converged into one, and it instantly dispersed the aura emanated by the demon race’s army. After that, it was like a monstrous wave of pressure that slammed down towards the army of demon beasts.

The demon race’s army stopped.

Roar!

A furious roar suddenly resounded from the army, and it didn’t take long for countless roars to resound incessantly. In just a moment, the entire army of demon beasts was roaring with fury.

The roars were like thunderclaps that shot up into the sky. At the same time, the entire army of demon beasts released their auras. Auras shot up into the air and surged towards Doomsday City.

Bang!

As soon as the auras collided, the space in the area rumbled and collapsed. A huge black hole was formed in the sky, and countless pillar-thick spatial rifts surrounded the black hole. The spatial rifts were spreading incessantly towards the surroundings. In just a breath of time, the entire sky was covered in cracks that seemed like a spider web.

A long time later, the spatial rifts and the black hold started to be repaired slowly.

Meanwhile, the armies stood in confrontation, and the battle was about to break out at any moment.

The demon race didn’t attack, and its army just stopped on the spot. The army of demon beasts didn’t even release their auras. Since the demon beasts didn’t attack, the humans couldn’t be any happier.

Lin Qian spoke in a low voice, “What are they doing?”

Ye Liuyun replied, “They are waiting!”

Lin Qian was puzzled, “For what?”

Ye Liuyun shook her head slightly, “I don’t know.” As she spoke, she gazed at Lin Qian and the others, “Everyone, no matter what happens, you have to stop the Voiders of the demon race once the battle begins. You absolutely can’t allow the Emperors on our side to face their Voiders. Otherwise, the consequences will be unimaginable!”

Lin Qian and the others nodded. They naturally understood all of that. After all, the reason the human race had lost miserably in the Veiled Region was because they weren’t able to stop the Voiders on the demon race’s side. Soldiers fought soldiers; generals fought generals. If soldiers were made to fight generals.... Wasn’t that like sending them to their deaths?

After the short collision just now, there was no further action from the demon race. Even though their army had no intention to attack right now, the humans didn’t dare lower their guards at all. Everyone on the city walls and within the city had vigilant expressions on their faces, and they were ready to fight at all times.

Time passed by slowly. In the blink of an eye, the veil of night had arrived. However, the demon race still didn’t move at all.

Late at night. Everyone within Doomsday City was tense, and a wave of invisible pressure was pressing down against their hearts.

At dawn, on the next day. When the first glimmer of sunlight descended to the ground, the entire ground started to tremble violently. It didn’t take long for the expressions of everyone throughout Doomsday City to turn grim.

It was demon beasts! A dense expanse of them!

A dense expanse of demon beasts had appeared all around the city. There were all sorts of demon beasts. Not only did they fill the ground, there were even many types of flying demon beasts in the air.

There were at least a few million of them!

At this moment, the entire city was completely surrounded by demon beasts. Moreover, an endless wave of demon beasts was surging towards the city from afar.

Everyone within the city turned pale.

Even Ye Liuyun who’d been extremely calm until now couldn’t help but turn slightly pale. After all, the human race didn’t have even the slightest advantage right now.

“So they were waiting for the entire army!” Lin Qian’s face was extremely unsightly. If it was just the elites that attacked the city, then the humans had a chance if they remained united. Yet now, the demon race refused to do that, and they’d dispatched the forces of their entire race to eliminate any chance the humans had!

If the human race hadn’t engaged in internal strife, then the joint forces of Dark Hell Continent and the Veiled Region might have a chance. Yet now, how could the strength of the human race stand a chance against the united forces of the demon race?

All the humans had despair on their faces. What was despair like? It was like this current situation.

Ye Liuyun glanced at the surroundings, and she immediately laughed bitterly when she noticed the despair on their faces. No matter what she said or how she tried to inspire them, it was useless in such a situation.

Suddenly, a huge Cloud Eagle appeared in the distance. There were 2 figures on it, the Demon Empress and Mo Xiaoleng.

As soon as they saw the Demon Empress and Mo Xiaoleng, the countless demon beasts here instantly roared. How grand was such a sight?

At this moment, the heavens and the earths hook!

The Demon Empress gazed at Doomsday City, remained silent for a short while, and then she raised her hand and said, “From this day onward, only the demon race will exist on Dark Hell Continent.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she was about to give the order to attack. Suddenly, a sword howl resounded throughout Doomsday City, and then a blood red ray of light shot up into the sky. It flashed through the sky before descending to the ground outside the city.

A voice resounded, “Do any demons dare to fight me?”
