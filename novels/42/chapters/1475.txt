Chapter 1476 – A Sick Woman!

At this moment, he finally understood why she was so terrifying.

Yellow Springs River!

He’d passed through Yellow Springs River without realizing it. The cultivation of cultivators wasn’t restricted on the other side of the river. The experts here could attain realms of cultivation above the Deity Realm.

This is why nobody comes back from the other side of Yellow Springs River!

How huge was the gap between the Deity Realm and Dualism Realm?

He didn’t know the answer in the past. But he did now. Even though he wasn’t a Deity, the python and the others were! However, they were no match for her.

They were completely crushed!

Even with the strength they possessed, all of them had been completely crushed by her, and they practically couldn’t even fight back!

However, all of them and especially the Ancient Emperor Python were equivalent to peak Deities! Moreover, they were the type of peak Deities that hadn’t relied on any external forces to attain their current strength!

But they couldn’t even fight back against her!

As for Yang Ye, it was worse. He may not even be able to defeat the python in single combat. Even though Heavenrend was strong, it couldn’t kill the python in an instant, let alone the woman. It wasn’t a threat to her at all. Two overlapped Heavenrends had merely penetrated her skin!

They couldn’t fight her, and it was impossible for them to defeat her!

If Yang Ye could utilize the Stellar Sword Diagram, then perhaps he could try to defeat her. But the problem was that he couldn’t use it right now! Actually, he could activate it, but would he dare to? Of course he wouldn’t! If he did that, then perhaps he would be the first to die.

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. Needless to say, he’d really courted death. At this moment, he recalled the river he’d passed through while fleeing. Obviously, that was Yellow Springs River. Unfortunately, he was quite muddled from being chased by the towering giant for so long, so he hadn’t even thought of Yellow Springs River. Thus, he’d ran through it!

Now, he’s brought death upon himself!

The woman didn’t care what Yang Ye was thinking about. After she blasted the python away, she was about to attack Yang Ye again. However, Yang Ye suddenly spoke, “Big Sister, can I surrender?”

She was slightly stunned, and then she actually revealed quite a ferocious expression, “You called me big sister? Am I very old? Am I?!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, she suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye. Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically, and he instinctively stabbed his sword forward. However, two fingers clamped down on his sword instead.

She gazed at him and asked, “Am I very old?”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched slightly. She seems to really care about that.

He scanned her carefully, and then he spoke seriously, “No, you’re not old at all. You’re extremely young, extremely beautiful, extremely....” He didn’t know what else to say. It wasn’t because he was saying something that went against his beliefs, and it was merely because he really didn’t know how to compliment women.

Even though she was wearing a plain robe, she really was very beautiful, and he wasn’t lying about that.

She stared at him and said, “Then why did you call me big sister?”

“It was a display of my respect for you!” Yang Ye spoke seriously, “I’m just showing my respect. Right, er... I need to explain. I only came here because I got lost. I... I’ll leave right away, and I won’t disturb you again.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around and walked away.

Suddenly, the woman appeared in front of him. She stared at him and said, “How laughable! You want to leave after coming here? I don’t know why Qi Rusuan didn’t kill you, but it’s fine because it’s the same if I kill you!”

She was about to attack when Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Why? Why do you insist on killing me because I’ve come in here? There has to be a reason, right?”

He was very curious about this. There was no enmity between him and the woman, but she insisted on killing him. That was quite unusual and didn’t make sense!

“Everyone who comes in from the outside deserves death!” As soon as she finished speaking, her figure vanished on the spot, and she was in front of Yang Ye when she appeared again.

Yang Ye’s expression changed. Even though he was no match for her, he wouldn’t just stand there and wait for death to arrive. He was about to attack when her hand suddenly stopped in midair, and then she frowned. A short while passed before her expression gradually eased up and became gentle. It didn’t take long for her to look exactly like she had been when Yang Ye had first met her.

There was no coldness on her face, and her eyes were filled with tender affection. She seemed like a pretty girl from a humble family.

“Honey!” She grabbed Yang Ye’s hand in a very natural manner, and she spoke happily, “You... you’ve finally returned. Suxin missed you!” As she spoke, she wrapped her arms around him and hugged him tightly. She seemed as if she was afraid that Yang Ye would vanish.

Yang Ye was completely stunned. What the heck is going on?

Meanwhile, she suddenly released him and held tightly onto his hand, “Honey, let’s go home. Let’s go home and never be separated again. Come!”

As she spoke, she’d started walking towards the cottage while pulling Yang Ye along.

She’s sick!

Ha gazed at her for a long time and obtained such a conclusion. She didn’t seem like she was acting at all. Because he actually saw tears in her eyes. Since she wasn’t acting, then she was definitely sick!

As far as he was concerned, it was a good thing. Because she seemed to have no intention to attack him. So long as she didn’t, he would have the chance to escape.

Yes, escape!

She was a Dualism Realm expert. She wasn’t an existence that he could go against. After all, the Dualism Realm had far surpassed his current realm of cultivation. Even surmounting his realm to do battle had its limits. He wasn’t so strong that he could just surmount every realm of cultivation. Perhaps he could fight her once he attained the Deity Realm. But it was utterly impossible right now.

Yang Ye had a very clear understanding of his own strength, and he knew that he could only choose to flee from her!

However, he didn’t dare to flee right now. She was holding onto him. If he fled now, agitated her, and made her become how she had been a little while ago, then he would be in trouble.

Just like that, she pulled him into the cottage. The cottage seemed quite simple from the outside, but it wasn’t on the inside. It was actually decorated quite luxuriously, and it had everything one would need.

She pulled him to the side of the bed, and then wrapped her arms around his arm before resting her head on his shoulder. She spoke softly, “Honey, why did it take you so long to return? Did you forget me?”

Yang Ye was about to speak when he suddenly felt something cold on his shoulder. He turned to look and saw that she’d suddenly started to cry.

Yang Ye naturally felt no pity for her. What a joke! She wasn’t his, and she wasn’t crying for him! He was just thinking about how to escape.

He hadn’t forgotten where he was. This was the forbidden area of the Ominous Territory!

He had to run!

His strength wasn’t sufficient to survive here at all. Fortunately, he’d encountered this woman that wasn’t so normal. If he’d encountered another Dualism Realm expert, then he would definitely be dead.

Dualism Realm experts!

Even Qiong Qi’s current strength would definitely be insufficient to fight them!

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “Do... do you still remember what happened just now?”

“Earlier?” She looked up at Yang Ye, “Wasn’t I waiting for you?”

She doesn’t remember! Yang Ye took a deep and long glance at her. Now, he was sure that she really was sick.

Meanwhile, she rested her head on his shoulder and spoke softly, “Honey, why did it take you so long to return? Do you know how lonely I’ve been while waiting by myself for you to return?”

Yang Ye asked, “Why didn’t you leave this place?”

She shook her head, “It’s impossible. It’s impossible to leave.”

Yang Ye asked curiously, “Why?”

She shook her head, “Because only death awaits. Honey, don’t try to leave anymore. Let’s... let’s just live out the rest of our lives here in peace. Alright?”

Only death awaits? Yang Ye frowned. The people here are at the Dualism Realm. Just this woman before me possesses such terrifying strength, yet she doesn’t dare to leave. In other words, there’s definitely some sort of restriction here that imprisons them.

If that’s the case.... Then who is that strong to imprison Dualism Realm experts?

The Ominous Territory felt even more mysterious to him!

Of course, he didn’t have the mood to care about all of that. His mind was focused on how to escape this damnable place and head to the Forest of Darkness! If he wanted to escape this damnable place, the first step was to escape this woman!

But the woman was holding him tightly and seemed absolutely afraid that he would leave.... He could struggle free, but what if it agitated her and made her return to how she had been a little while ago!

Bad luck!

Horrible luck!

Yang Ye smiled bitterly. After all, he had no intention to go to the other side of Yellow Springs River, but he hadn’t expected himself to get here by chance. Now, it was easy to enter but difficult to leave!

Suddenly, weak breathing came from Yang Ye’s shoulder. Yang Ye turned to look, and he noticed that the woman had actually fallen asleep while lying on his shoulder.

She fell asleep? Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he felt delighted. Because it was an opportunity for him. It was naturally an opportunity for him to escape.

Kill her?

It wasn’t a realistic thought! It wasn’t realistic at all! Experts at her level were extremely sensitive to danger. So, he just had to reveal the intent to kill, and it would definitely alarm her!

So, he’d chosen to flee.

Yang Ye placed his right hand on her hand, and he was about to gently move it aside when Suxin suddenly opened her eyes, and then she raised her head and looked him in the eyes.

She had an icy cold expression and an icy cold gaze.

Yang Ye’s face froze.
