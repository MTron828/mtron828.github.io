Chapter 927 – You Really Are So Cruel!

“Are... are you sure?” Yu Wushuang looked Yang Ye in the eyes. Even though she knew that Yang Ye was about to go to extremes, she hadn’t imagined that he would actually do something that was so extreme. After all, if they opened the gates and allowed demon beasts to enter the city, then the slightest mistake would result in the complete annihilation of the city’s residents!

Yang Ye grinned, “Do I seem like I’m joking?”

Yu Wushuang took a deep breath and said, “Listen. Opening the gates and allowing the demon beasts to enter is indeed capable of arousing a sense of danger in everyone. But... but you have to understand that if we fail to control it well, then the demon beasts we let in might work together with the demon beasts outside. At that time, the city would really be breached. Moreover, there’s another possibility, and it’s that our actions might cause an opposite effect. It might infuriate everyone in the city. Once they’re infuriated and someone fans the flames, then we would be facing demon beasts from the outside and a rebellion on the inside. We would truly be finished then!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Looking at you reminds me of a friend of mine. You’re intelligent just like her, and you’re a monstrous genius just like her. At that time, I did all the fighting and killing, and she dealt with everything for me back home. Now that I think about it, it really was all thanks to her, and she really must have suffered.”

“Don’t change the topic!” Yu Wushuang was quite displeased the Yang Ye had changed the topic, and she immediately glared at him. Meanwhile, she spoke once more while Yang Ye was just about to speak, “Is... is that friend of yours’ female?”

Yang Ye nodded as ripples surged through his eyes, and he seemed to be recalling the past.

Yu Wushuang glanced at him and muttered, “Oh.”

After that, she lowered her head slightly, and no one knew what she was thinking.

A short while passed before Yang Ye spoke, “Wushuang, your worries make sense. Once the gates are opened and the demon beasts are allowed to enter, then we would be digging our own graves if we don’t manage it well. Besides that, what you said about the residents of this city becoming infuriated is correct as well. You’ve considered everything well, and your worries make absolute sense. However, have you thought about whether we have another choice right now?”

Yu Wushuang was slightly stunned. Only when Yang Ye reminded her did she realize that they really didn’t seem to have another choice!

Yang Ye turned around to look at the army outside the city walls, and he said, “We asked for their help just now, but they refused. So, I’m going to make them beg me to defend the city. Open the city gates!”

“Open the gates!” Yang Ye’s voice was enhanced by his profound energy, and it resounded throughout the northern city walls. All the outer court students were slightly stunned, and their eyes were filled with shock and bewilderment. However, it didn’t take long for the city gates to open slowly.

Even though they didn’t know why Yang Ye was doing that, they didn’t ask about it or hesitate!

That was the trust they had for Yang Ye!

A small gap had just been opened in the city gates when countless demon beasts charged through it, and it only took less than 2 breaths of time for a few hundred demon beasts to charge into the city!

“That’s enough, right?” Yu Wushuang asked with a trembling voice.

Yang Ye shook his head slightly. The ancient sheath was in his left grasp, and an intent sword was sheathed in it.

Just like that, another 5 breaths of time passed, and almost 3,000 demon beasts had charged into the city.

“Close the gates!” Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s voice resounded abruptly, and then a ray of sword energy slashed down from above the city walls and descended right before the city gates. The dozens of demon beasts which were about to charge into the city were immediately chopped into 2.

However, it didn’t stop the demon wolves behind them from charging forward.

Om!

Swords howls resounded successively and incessantly from above the city walls, and countless rays of sword energy swept down from above. In the end, they actually formed a line that connected the ground to the area above the city walls, and they formed a barrier of sword energy that obstructed the path into the city, causing countless demon wolves to be stopped outside the city!

In the beginning, some wolves dared to use their bodies to collide with the barrier of sword energy, but it didn’t take long for them to dare not charge forward again. Because every single one of them that came into contact with it was instantly minced into mush.

Three breaths of time later, the city gates were closed, and the sword energy dispersed.

After the wolves charged into the city, they immediately started charging at Yang Ye and the others who stood on the city walls.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy flashed, and then the heads of a few dozen wolves flew up into the air. After that, the pressure of a strand of terrifying sword intent rained down from above the city walls and pressed down upon the wolves. Countless wolves were horrified and didn’t dare take a step forward.

A ray of sword energy flashed once more. This time, it didn’t flash into the pack of wolves, and it descended onto the ground before the wolves and a bottomless trench was instantly split open there.

“Cross this line and die!” Yang Ye gazed coldly at them and spoke without a shred of emotion.

Aowu!

A wolf at the Half-Saint Realm was exasperated, and it leaped up into the air. At the same instant that it did, a ray of sword energy flashed through its neck, and then its head flew up into the air.

The other wolves which were about to charge forward as well instantly froze on the spot.

Yang Ye gazed at the wolves and spoke indifferently, “Do any others want to give it a try?”

Aowu!

One of the wolves howled, and then the pack instantly turned around and charged off into the distance.

Everyone on the city walls had solemn expressions on their faces as they watched the wolves charge off. Even though it was only a small number of wolves, they weren’t weak, and most of them were at the Exalt Realm. Besides that there were even many at the Monarch Realm and a quite a few at the Half-Saint Realm. If such a pack of wolves were to charge into the densely populated city, then even an idiot could imagine what would happen....

Yang Ye gazed at Yu Wushuang who remained silent by his side, “You think I’m cruel?”

Yu Wushuang remained silent.

Yang Ye continued, “As I said before. If the city is breached, then most of us from the academy would be able to survive. Because the city can only be considered to be affiliated with the academy, and it isn’t the academy’s true base of operations. So, the academy wouldn’t make us defend the city until our deaths. In the opinion of the academy’s higher-ups, we’re far more valuable than the city. So, if they don’t come here and help defend the city, then the final outcome would be one where they sacrificed their lives to drag the wolf army down with them....”

When he spoke up to this point, Yang Ye raised his head and looked towards the distance. There were shrill cries starting to resound from there. He said, “Letting some die now is better than allowing the entire city to be slaughtered.”

Yu Wushuang suddenly raised her head to look at him, “But what if they rebel?”

“What if they rebel?” Yang Ye chuckled, “Then there’ll be no need to defend the city. We’ll open the gates completely and allow all the demon beasts to enter. After that, we’ll watch them fight the demon beasts to the death before reaping the benefits!”

“You....” Yu Wushuang was shocked by Yang Ye’s plan. She hadn’t imagined that Yang Ye actually had such plans. What would opening the city gates completely represent? It represented that countless would die!

Moreover, there were children, utterly helpless people, and countless innocents amongst them.

A long time passed before Yu Wushuang couldn’t help but state, “You... you really are so cruel!”

Yang Ye suddenly turned around to look at her. He didn’t speak and just gazed at her, and there was indifference in his eyes.

Yu Wushuang’s heart trembled when she noticed that Yang Ye was looking at her like someone he didn’t know. She wanted to say something, but Yang Ye had withdrawn his gaze, and he didn’t speak a word.

Yu Wushuang’s face instantly turned pale!

Earlier, Yang Ye knew that she didn’t really like his plan when he saw her remain silent, and that was why he’d explained it to her. Yu Wushuang was fully aware of Yang Ye’s character after being by his side throughout this period, and he knew that he only explained himself to those he considered to be one of his own. As for those he didn’t, he couldn’t be bothered to pay any attention to them.

Even though Yang Ye was quite nice and amiable at most times, she knew that Yang Ye was extremely proud deep within. He was only nice and amiable to those he acknowledged.

Yet now, Yang Ye had refused to explain himself to her. So, what did that mean?

Yu Wushuang was about to say something when numerous shrill cries resounded from afar, and it didn’t take long for hundreds of human experts to appear within their fields of vision. These human experts ran madly in their direction while dozens of demon beasts were right behind the group.

“Save us....” Countless people shouted from amidst the group. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Yang Ye just watched coldly from above the city walls and didn’t move at all. As for the outer court students and the others, they didn’t act at all without Yang Ye’s orders.

It didn’t take long for the group of people to arrive below the city walls. However, the wolves stopped because that trench Yang Ye created just now was right in front of them.

Cross this line and die!

They hadn’t forgotten those words!

The wolves glanced at the humans which they’d chased until here, and there was a trace of unwillingness in their eyes. However, they turned around and left. In less than 2 breaths of time, all the wolves had vanished from their fields of vision.

It didn’t take long for numerous shrill cries to resound from afar, and that wasn’t the only place. Actually, shrill cries were resounding from many parts of the city.

Only a few thousand wolves had charged into the city, and it was simply incomparable when compared to the number of residents in the city. However, it was the wolves who were slaughtering the humans and not the other way around!

Why?

Because most humans weren’t united at all! When they faced the wolves, their first thought wasn’t how to join forces against the wolves, it was how to flee instead!

Just like these fellows who stood before Yang Ye. There were numerous Exalt Realm cultivators amongst them, and there were even quite a few at the Monarch Realm. If they joined forces, then it might have been that group of wolves which had to flee instead. After all, there were only a few dozen wolves amongst the group!

However, they hadn’t done that because none of them was willing to risk their lives and fight the wolves!

Suddenly, a young man leaped up onto the city wall, pointed his finger at Yang Ye, and roared furiously, “Your strengths are entirely sufficient to kill those beasts! So why didn’t all of you act? Why didn’t you? Besides that, why were those demon beasts able to enter the city? Aren’t all of you defending the city? What the fuck are all of you doing here? Huh!? Say something! Huh? Are you dead?”
