Chapter 2074 – The Might of a Sage!

It fears her? Yang Ye fell silent for a long time and asked, “Why?”

The evil treasure replied with a question, “Can’t you sense it?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “While I’m aware that she isn’t ordinary, I can’t discern what’s extraordinary about her.”

The evil treasure said, “That’s the difference between you and us. Natural beings have a natural instinct towards danger. As for her, after living for so many years, it’s the first time someone has made me feel like this!”

Yang Ye asked, “Do you know about her background?”

This time, he was really quite curious about Tian Xiu’s background.

The evil treasure fell silent for a long time before it said, “I can’t discern anything.”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and smiled, “Forget her, let’s talk about you. Seriously, can you stop targeting me?”

The evil treasure fell silent.

After waiting for a while and receiving no reply, Yang Ye shook his head, Looks like it isn’t up for discussion!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he vanished into outer space.

As soon as he entered outer space, his expression changed, and he turned around and swung his sword.

Bang!

A wave of powerful energy exploded apart, and it blasted him over 3km away.

Yang Ye looked up, and he saw an old man there. The old man’s back was slightly hunched, and there were deep wrinkles on his face, but his gaze was extremely sharp.

A Sage!

The old man was a Sage!

The old man spoke indifferently, “You’re quite difficult to find! I knew a human Sage would never kill a genius of the human race! Sure enough, he didn’t!”

Yang Ye asked, “The Sage Alliance?”

The old man said, “Looks like you know quite a bit. Yang Ye, we’ll give you a chance. Hand over that treasure from the Dao Path and you can leave.”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “Aren’t you afraid that the Dao Progenitor will come for you in the future?”

“How na?ve!” The old man laughed with ridicule, “You’re still trying to use the Dao Progenitor’s name to scare us at a time like this. Yang Ye, do you still not understand?”

Yang Ye asked, “Understand what?”

The old man smiled, “The battle between Paths has already begun. If you die, we can only conclude that the Dao Progenitor chose the wrong person. As for taking revenge, trust me, he won’t waste time for a dead person.”

Yang Ye smiled, “So, I can’t die then!”

The old man stretched out a hand, “Hand it over and you can leave!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Do you think I would believe you?”

A smile curled up on the old man’s face, “You’re quite smart! Since that’s the case, I have no choice but to waste some energy!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand. In an instant, a planet over 50,000km away trembled, and then countless rays of starlight surged out from it and arrived above Yang Ye.

Yang Ye looked up at the starlight, What is this technique?

As if he knew what Yang Ye was thinking, the old man explained, “Star Gathering. Yang Ye, if you’re able to stop this move, then I’ll write the word ‘amazing’ for you.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he pressed his right palm down in Yang Ye’s direction. In an instant, all the starlight descended upon Yang Ye.

At this moment, Yang Ye felt a wave of unprecedented pressure. Just the pressure suffocated him, and even the Sky Dragon couldn’t alleviate the situation. Moreover, if he didn’t have the Sky Dragon, it may have crushed him to death!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, and then a wave of mysterious energy appeared here.

The Sword Domain!

Once the Sword Domain appeared, the starlight immediately slowed down.

“The Sword Domain?” A cold smile appeared on the corners of the old man’s mouth, “Interesting indeed!”

Suddenly, Yang Ye took a step forward, and then around 100 ethereal swords appeared here. They started to make a waving motion, and then the space in the Sword Domain started to ripple as well.

The old man frowned from the sight of this, and then his pupils constricted, “The five elements! You’ve actually grasped the true essence of the five elements!”

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Suddenly, the swords in the Sword Domain started moving even faster, and rays of light covered the interior of the Sword Domain. They enveloped all the starlight.

Besides that, the sword energy was completely different from before because they contained the energy of the five elements.

They didn’t mince up the starlight, and they just modified the starlight, like they were decomposing the starlight.

When spring arrived, flowers bloomed; when autumn arrived, flowers wilted.

Five element sword energy!

He’d learned it from the Inheritance Stone he obtained. However, he’d merged the energy of the five elements into his sword energy. At this moment, his sword didn’t focus on killing as it had in the past, and it focused on modification!

Modification!

Three breaths of time later, the starlight had dimmed down. Five breaths of time later, they’d vanished completely.

However, Yang Ye’s countenance had turned slightly pale.

It wasn’t difficult for him to control the energy of the five elements, and the difficult part was using it to modify his sword energy and the world within the Sword Domain. It was quite strenuous for him to accomplish that. Fortunately, the results were very good. It was even greater than his Invincible Sword Formation, but it was just a little exhausting!

“How rare!” Meanwhile, the old man spoke abruptly, “I didn’t expect you to have actually come into contact with that step. However, you probably received guidance from someone, right?”

Yang Ye looked up at the old man, “Weren’t you going to write for me? Where is it? Come on, I’m waiting!”

“What?” The old man laughed coldly, “I don’t have anything for you, but I can teach you how to write the word for death!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he raised his hand in Yang Ye’s direction, and then he slapped it down. The space around Yang Ye immediately collapsed while Yang Ye’s body even cracked open in an instant!

Even the Sky Dragon couldn’t help him withstand it!

Yang Ye suddenly howled with fury, and then three rays of sword energy surged forward and instantly arrived before the old man. A cold smile curled up on the corners of the old man’s mouth. He stretched out his right hand, and a thin barrier of light appeared on his palm. He just used his palm to stop Yang Ye’s attack!

The old man laughed coldly, “Not bad, but you’re still too young!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

He shook his head once he finished speaking.

Bang!

The powerful force from his attack instantly blasted Yang Ye away. Yang Ye hadn’t even stopped himself when the old man appeared before him, and then he slammed a punch at Yang Ye.

The powerful force it carried caused space in a huge area to crack open! As for Yang Ye who was the target of the attack, his body cracked open and blood sprayed from all over his body. Fortunately, the Sky Dragon’s energy was protecting his body, so his body hadn’t exploded apart in an instant!

However, if he was struck by another attack like that, it was obvious that he would be transformed into a pile of mush.

At the critical moment, Yang Ye issued a command in his heart, and the Weapon Seal of the Slaughter Line appeared in front of him. The old man’s fist struck it, and a wave of powerful energy erupted from it.

Boom!

The old man was blasted over 100m away, and Yang Ye was blasted over 30k away!

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and then he looked up at the old man.

This is the strength of a Sage?

He’d thought that the gap between them wouldn’t be that huge, but the cruel reality before him told him that it was huge, extremely huge.

Actually, he didn’t know that if news of what happened here today were to spread, his name would definitely shock the entire large universe. After all, a Dao Realm expert had been able to exchange blows with a Sage. Even if it couldn’t be described as unprecedented, there were definitely less than five people capable of accomplishing such a feat in the past tens of thousands of years!

“Yang Ye, you’re truly a genius!” Meanwhile, the old man suddenly said, “I’m not someone who likes to waste his breath, but you’ve really shocked me. I was really inferior to you at your age. Unfortunately, you’re too young, so you don’t have the right to fight me yet.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he raised his right hand slowly and was about to attack again. However, he suddenly looked up, and then he gazed at Yang Ye again. At this moment, a middle aged man had appeared by Yang Ye’s side!

Zhong Ye!

It was Zhong Ye!

Yang Ye said, “It’s you!”

Zhong Ye smiled, “Are you that surprised?”

Yang Ye nodded, “A little!”

Zhong Ye shook his head slightly, “I was the one who brought you to the Weapon Path, and it was I who made you go to Martial Emperor Academy… I think that I should do something or I wouldn’t be able to rest in peace.”

He turned to look at the old man, “The Sage Alliance?”

The old man spoke indifferently, “Zhong Ye, if I’m not wrong, your progenitor told you not to interfere, right?”

Zhong Ye nodded, “He did. However, it can’t be helped. There are things that I must do.”

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “You intend to go against the Sage Alliance?”

Zhong Ye chuckled, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “After today, I’ll probably be locked up for some time. After all, I still belong to the Weapon Path, and there are rules that I have to follow.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Zhong Ye sighed softly, “I can only help you this one time. You’ll have to take care of yourself from now on.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly grabbed Yang Ye’s shoulder and tossed Yang Ye away, causing Yang Ye to vanish from both his own field of vision and the old man’s.

Zhong Ye turned around to gaze at the old man, “They say the Sages of the Sage Alliance are some of the strongest Sages. Come, let me experience it for myself!”

The old man glanced at the direction Yang Ye had vanished towards and asked, “You think he’ll be able to survive?”

Zhong ye walked slowly in the old man’s direction, “I don’t know. Even if he dies a moment later, I still have to do this. His fate is his business, and whether I chose to help him or not is my business.”

Zhong Ye vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.
