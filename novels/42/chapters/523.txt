Chapter 524 – Vassal!

Greenwood Palace.

“It’s all thanks to you, Xuan’er, that my Greenwood Clan was able to turn the situation around and put an end to the rebellion. We’re best friends, so I won’t speak too many words of thanks. Just let me know if you need my Treant Clan’s help in the future.” Shu Xin sat on a throne made of vines while she smiled and spoke to Yin Xuan’er.

Many elders of the Treant Clan who were present here nodded when they heard Shu Xin. The Nine-Tailed Fox Clan was much stronger than the Treant Clan, so if they could ally themselves with the Nine-Tailed Fox Clan, then it would definitely be an extremely good thing for the Treant Clan.

Yin Xuan’er smiled and said, “Xin’er, aren’t you going to thank my husband? I wouldn’t have been able to repel the experts of the Exalted Han Empire if it wasn’t for him!”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye hurriedly said, “There’s no need to thank me, no need at all. It was something I ought to have done, really....”

The gazes of many treants descended onto Yang Ye. They had a good impression of this human before them because it was exactly he who’d killed the experts of the Exalted Han Empire and the Patriarch of the Scholar Tree Clan, and that was why the Greenwood Clan was able to turn the situation around. It could be said that the Greenwood Clan would have perished if it wasn’t for this human!

Shu Xin’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye. She was filled with curiosity towards Yang Ye. Because he possessed such terrifying strength at such a young age, and he was even the Sword Emperor of this age. It made her wonder if the appearance of such a genius amongst the humans was a blessing or calamity to the demon race.

Shu Xin remained silent for a moment before she glanced at Yin Xuan’er, and then she nodded to Shu Jin who stood by her side. The latter hesitated slightly before she nodded, turned around, and left. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Only a little while passed before Shu Jin returned, and she was carrying a small green bottle in her hand.

The expressions of many treants in the surroundings changed upon laying eyes on that bottle. Some seemed to intend to say something, but Shu Jin glared fiercely at them and stopped them from speaking.

Shu Xin took the small bottle from Shu Jin, and then she walked over to Yang Ye and said, “Young Master Yang, words aren’t enough to express my gratitude nor am I able to repay your kindness. There are 3 drops of Life Water here. It’s just a small display of my Treant Clan’s gratitude, so I hope that you don’t refuse.”

Life Water! Yin Xuan’er was visibly moved, and she said, “Xin’er, how generous of you! You’re actually giving this fellow Life Water which is only inferior in value to the Greenwood Spirit within your Treat Clan. Even I’m slightly jealous now!”

“If you want it, then I’ll give you a drop later, Xuan’er!” Shu Xin smiled.

Yin Xuan’er shook her head and said, “There are only 10 drops of this every 1,000 years, and it’s extremely precious to your Treant Clan, so how could I possibly ask for it from you? In any case, giving it to him is like giving it to me. There’s no distinction between the two of us!” As she spoke, she received the green bottle on Yang Ye’s behalf and sized it up incessantly.

Yang Ye said, “Life Water? Can it improve one’s strength?”

Yin Xuan’er rolled her eyes at Yang Ye and said, “Even though it can’t improve a person’s strengths, it’s much more precious than treasures which improve a person’s strength. Regardless of how heavy your injuries are in the future, or even if the meridians or bones throughout your body are shattered, you’ll still be able to recover immediately upon consuming a drop of this.”

“It’s that miraculous?” Yang Ye wasn’t able to maintain his calm anymore. He’d originally intended to refuse because of the Greenwood Spirit, but now, he felt that anyone who refused the Life Water was an idiot!

Shu Xin suddenly said, “Right, Young Master Yang, I have a request!”

Yang Ye’s heart twitched when he heard this, and he said, Here it comes!

Shu Xin didn’t wait for Yang Ye to refuse or agree before she said, “The Greenwood Spirit is a precious treasure of my Treant Clan, and it’s of utmost important to my Treant Clan. So, I hope Young Master Yang is able to return it to us. You’ve done a great kindness to my Treant Clan, so if Young Master Yang needs anything, then my Treat Clan will agree to anything besides the Greenwood Spirit that is within my Treant Clan’s ability. Please!” As soon as she finished speaking, she made a full bow to Yang Ye.

All the treants within the hall shot their gazes towards Yang Ye as well.

Yin Xuan’er stopped playing with the Life Water as well, and she shot her gaze towards Yang Ye as well.

Yang Ye smiled bitterly because what he was worried about the most had occurred in the end. He said, “Miss Shu Xin, to be honest, even though the Greenwood Spirit is a precious treasure that’s useful to me, I’m really not shameless enough to take possession of it by force. Even you saw it for yourself. It was the Greenwood Spirit that flew into my body. What I’m trying to say is that it isn’t that I’m unwilling to return it to you, but the Greenwood Spirit itself is unwilling to leave.”

Shu Xin’s beautiful brows knit together slightly while the other members of the Treant Clan revealed slightly hostile expressions. They only had a single thought in their hearts, and it was that this rather agreeable human actually intended to take possession of the Greenwood Spirit by force!

Yang Ye said, “I know all of you don’t believe me, but that’s the facts of the matter.” Yang Ye was rather depressed at this moment. Indeed, no one would feel happy from being regarded as a thief. He knew that the reason the Greenwood Spirit was staying within his body was mainly because it had taken a liking to the tiny vortex. But the problem was that he was unable to explain all of it to these treants!

Many treants in the surroundings were filled with indignation when they heard such a shameless answer from Yang Ye. If Yang Ye hadn’t helped them earlier, and if it wasn’t because of the strength that Yang Ye possessed, many treants would have probably attacked by now.

Meanwhile, Yin Xuan’er suddenly said, “Xin’er, he should be telling the truth!”

Shu Xin gazed at Yin Xuan’er with a puzzled expression.

Yin Xuan’er glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Is ‘it’ the reason?”

Yang Ye knew what Yin Xuan’er was speaking about, and he immediately nodded.

Yin Xuan’er gazed at Shu Xin and said, “Xin’er, you might really be unable to get it back. I can guarantee that he isn’t trying to take possession of your Greenwood Spirit. As for the reason, he probably won’t tell you it. As for me, I can’t tell you as well. Otherwise, he’ll definitely kill me. I’m truly sorry. I never expected that this would happen as well!”

Shu Xin smiled bitterly. If Yin Xuan’er wasn’t a good friend of hers, then she might really suspect that they were working together to trick her and take the Greenwood Spirit. She chose to believe Yin Xuan’er in the end. Moreover, her intuition told her that this fellow called Yang Ye wasn’t such a person. Even though they’d only known each other for a short while, she knew that he was a very proud person. If he really wanted to take the Greenwood Spirit by force, then he would absolutely not give her such a long explanation!

But could it be that I really have to give away the treasure of my Greenwood Clan? Not to mention that she refused to agree to that, even the entire Treant Clan would probably not agree to it.

“Are you not going to do something?” Yin Xuan’er glared at him and said, “Even though it wasn’t intentional, you still can’t avoid the fact that you’re still partially responsible, right?”

Yang Ye smiled bitterly and said, “I’m not trying to act shamelessly. Even though this pearl is very good indeed and is very useful to me, to be honest, it isn’t precious enough that I have to act shamelessly to obtain it. Alright, I really am partially responsible. How about we do this? Miss Xin, name a price, and I’ll buy this pearl, alright?”

“Buy it?” Shu Jin was furious. She glared at Yang Ye and said, “That pearl is like a Natural Treasure. You want to buy a Natural Treasure with money? How laughable! Do you know what a Natural Treasure is? Do you know what it is?!”

“I do.” Yang Ye nodded. Truthfully speaking, he naturally did. He had 3 Natural Treasures within him, so how could he not?

“You do? I don’t think you do!” Shu Jin spoke furiously. “Every single Natural Spirit is favored by the heavens and the earth. You can’t even imagine how precious they are. You....”

When she spoke up to this point, Shu Jin’s voice had stopped abruptly, and she gazed at Yang Ye with astonishment. To be precise, she was looking at the ball of flames and a bolt of violet lightning on Yang Ye’s palms.

Bang!

A violet gale appeared out of nowhere, and the Ninth Hell Swordwings appeared on Yang Ye’s back.

3 Natural Treasures!

All the treants in the surroundings were dumbstruck as they gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye said, “Look, I really do know. I’m not trying to show off, and I just want to tell all of you that while your Greenwood Spirit is precious, it really isn’t precious to the point that I have to act shamelessly to take it by force. I know that I’m in the wrong, so tell me what I have to do so that you’ll give up on this pearl. If you really refuse to give up on taking it back, then to be honest, I will have no choice but to flee.”

“You....” Shu Jin’s body trembled with fury.

Shu Xin waved her hand and said, “It’s fine. Young Master Yang’s strength is extraordinary, and my Treant Clan can’t afford to offend Young Master Yang. So we’ll just give it to you as repayment for your kindness of saving our Treant Clan!” If it was any other person, then she would naturally not take the initiative to give the Greenwood Spirit away. But she was helpless against Yang Ye, completely helpless.

She still hadn’t forgotten the scene when Yang Ye killed Chen Teng just now!

Yang Ye felt slightly embarrassed when he heard this. He had no choice but to look towards Yin Xuan’er in the end as he hoped that she would have a way to deal with this.

Yin Xuan’er rolled her eyes at Yang Ye, and then she gazed at Shu Xin as she pointed at Yang Ye and said, “Xin’er, what do you think about his strength?”

Shu Xin was stunned, and then she glanced at Yang Ye and fell into deep through for a while. She said, “He’s very strong. I’m afraid that there aren’t many in the entire demon race who can go against him.”

Yin Xuan’er smiled, and then she looked at the other treants in the surroundings and said, “He’s the Sword Emperor of this era. His natural talent even slightly surpasses the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor from all those years ago. I guarantee that it won’t be long before he’ll definitely become unparalleled throughout the world just like the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor was all those years ago. Everyone, the Greenwood Spirit is precious indeed, but it’s only an object in the end. Do you think that a favor from a future extraordinary expert or an object like the Greenwood Spirit is more precious?”

The treants in the surroundings fell silent. If they hadn’t watched Yang Ye kill Chen Teng in an instant just now, they would definitely not believe Yin Xuan’er. Yet now, they couldn’t deny that this human before them was very strong. Most importantly, he was very young and only around the age of 20!

Yin Xuan’er gazed at Shu Xin and said, “Xin’er, you have to realize that the Treant Clan doesn’t possess a Monarch Realm expert!”

Shu Xin’s entire body trembled when she heard this. She understood what Yin Xuan’er meant. If a clan didn’t possess a Monarch Realm expert or the protection of a formidable power or expert in this world which was about to fall into great chaos, then that clan could be annihilated or enslaved by others at any moment!

Shu Xin fell silent.

Right at this moment, a ray of green light flowed out slowly from within Yang Ye, and Shu Xin revealed an excited expression when she saw it. Because the Greenwood Spirit was taking the initiative to communicate with her. After all, the Greenwood Spirit had rarely communicated with her grandmother while it was in her grandmother’s possession.

A short while later, dense shock could be seen in Shu Xin’s eyes.

After the green light vanished, Shu Xin didn’t hesitate to speak immediately. “Young Master Yang, I want to make my Treant Clan a vassal of yours. I hope you don’t refuse!”

“Huh!?” Yang Ye was stunned.

It wasn’t just Yang Ye, even Yin Xuan’er and all the treants here were stunned.
