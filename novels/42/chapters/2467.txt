Chapter 2468 – Bloodline Awakening!

The middle aged man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “A bloodline!”

Bloodline!

He was naturally capable of discerning that Yang Ye’s aura had risen explosively because of Yang Ye’s bloodline and not the madness intent!

The middle aged man naturally knew the power of bloodlines well. It was something like a divine technique. The stronger a person’s ancestor was, the greater the bloodline would be, and the energy it contained would naturally be stronger. Of course, it depended on how much of it the user had activated!

But Yang Ye seemed to have not truly activated it at all!

The middle aged man restrained his thoughts, stretched out his hands, and waved them lightly.

Hiss!

The space before Yang Ye rippled like water, and then waves of powerful energy rippled out from it!

The energy was so strong that if it appeared in the outside world, it would obliterate the space in a huge area throughout Eternal River with absolute ease!

Suddenly, Yang Ye looked up, and the veins on his arms bulged. They were huge, and they were emitting blood red light!

Yang Ye stomped his right foot down.

Bang!

The world shook, and then Yang Ye swung his sword with both hands.

Hiss!Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This attack could split apart the world!

As soon as it descended, the space before Yang Ye was split open, and so was the energy that the middle aged man had unleashed!

The middle aged man frowned. Yang Ye’s strength had been enhanced to a level that exceeded his expectations!

Suddenly, a ray of light arrived before him, and the middle aged man clamped down lightly with two fingers and clamped the sword energy. He didn’t say a word and just twisted his body sideways to slam it against Yang Ye.

Suddenly, Yang Ye raised his knee.

Bang!

A figure was blasted away! It was Yang Ye!

His strength was still quite inferior when compared to the middle aged man!

However, Yang Ye’s figure instantly shot up after being blasted away, and he charged at the middle aged man again! This time, Executor suddenly entered the Sword Gourd, and then two swords appeared in his grasp!

The Sword Supreme and Sword Precursor!

Dual swords!

The Madness Sword Technique!

200 swings descended in a breath of time! How fast was it? How dense was it?

However, the middle aged man wasn’t troubled by it at all because he just used his powerful strength to repulse Yang Ye.

Overwhelming strength!

But every time he was blasted back, Yang Ye would charge again, over and over again!

A solemn expression gradually appeared in the middle aged man’s eyes.

Yang Ye wasn’t just using two swords but three. Because the sword within the Sword Gourd would fly out from time to time!

The middle aged man started to truly treat Yang Ye as an equal in battle!

In the Primordial Pagoda.

The demon beasts, Snowy, and Erya were seated on the Ascension Platform. They were all looking outside, and it was naturally because of the pagoda. So long as the pagoda willed it, everyone within it could see the outside world at all times.

Anxiety!

Snowy was very anxious because the middle aged man seemed very strong, and Yang Ye was constantly being blasted away!

Erya patted Snowy lightly and consoled her, “Don’t be afraid, Big Brother Yang will be fine.”

Snowy gazed at her, and then she waved her paws. She was asking Erya to help Yang Ye.

Erya laughed bitterly, “Snowy, I can’t help now. Big Brother Yang has gone insane, and he may even attack me if I try to help him!”

Snowy seemed to have thought of something and vanished on the spot. It didn’t take long for her to find An Nanjing in the mountains behind the Sword Sect. At this moment, An Nanjing was watching the battle outside, and Nameless was in her grasp!

She was ready to take action at any moment!

Snowy gazed at her anxiously and pointed upward.

An Nanjing glanced at Snowy and said, “He’s fine! Go eat!”

Eat? Snowy had a bitter expression on her face. After all, how could she have the appetite to eat right now?

Meanwhile, An Nanjing suddenly patted Snowy’s head, “He’s very strong, and he can be stronger! Trust him!”

Very strong!

Snowy looked up at the sky. She just happened to say the middle aged man slammed his fist into Yang Ye’s stomach, and then Yang Ye was punched away.

Snowy immediately started crying when she witnessed this.

…

On the Ascension Platform, Erya was still eating from the pot. However, she frequently shot glances up above. She was naturally not a heartless person, and she was ready!

She would immediately take action if Yang Ye’s life was in danger!

She was right within Yang Ye, so it would only take a moment for her to attack!

As for the other demons, they could only watch. Perhaps only the Primal True Dragon had the strength to fight against a Five World Realm expert, and the others couldn’t resist a Five World Realm expert at all.

It was suppression due to the gap in their realms of cultivation!

…

Outside the pagoda.

Yang Ye was blasted away again, but it only took a moment for him to charge at the middle aged man again!

The middle aged man and everyone else hadn’t noticed that the red light around Yang Ye was growing stronger!

Meanwhile, the blood within Yang Ye seemed to start boiling.

Yang Ye’s strength was growing increasingly stronger too!

The middle aged man had obviously noticed the increase in Yang Ye’s strength, and he knew that if he allowed this fight to drag on, then Yang Ye would be the one who suppressed him instead!

The middle aged man tapped his foot down and floated backward. A moment later, a golden disc appeared in his grasp. It was extremely thin like the wings of a cicada, and it was practically translucent! Suddenly, he formed a strange seal with both hands, and then rays of golden light rippled out from the disc!

If one looked carefully, one would notice that the golden light was actually a myriad of fine blades, and they were so fine they were practically invisible!

The blades shot at Yang Ye like a storm!

A Divine Treasure!

The golden disc was a Divine Treasure! A Five World Realm expert using a Divine Treasure was absolutely capable of fully bringing forth the might of it!

In the Primordial Pagoda, An Nanjing frowned slightly while her spear trembled slightly. It seemed to have sensed its owner’s desire to fight!

Meanwhile, Erya had stopped eating too, and the tip of her foot was gently rubbing against the Ascension Platform!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

At this moment, Yang Ye instinctively sensed danger! He took a step back, and then slowly raised both swords. At the same time, his figure started to turn ethereal, and then his swords descended!

Dual swords with the Sword Domain!

Ten swings! While they weren’t overlapped, they surged forth at the same time, so the force they carried was absolutely terrifying!

Hiss! Hiss!

Sharp sounds of something tearing open resounded. It wasn’t just space, it was a wave of powerful energy that was being sliced open as well!

Rumble!

The space throughout the entire world within the barrier started to collapse, inch by inch. Even the barrier itself started to tremble violently, and then numerous cracks appeared on it!

Zhao Wuji and the others witnessed this scene, and their faces grew extremely unsightly. Besides that, they felt absolutely shocked!

The Five World Realm!

The middle aged man in the barrier was a true Five World Realm expert! However, even such an expert couldn’t kill Yang Ye? So, how strong was Yang Ye?

Mo Liang suddenly asked, “Should we leave?”

“Leave?” Zhao Wuji’s face was quite pale, “Where will we go? Eternal Kingdom may have agreed to take us in, but have you not noticed? They don’t plan to open up the Universe Wall, and do you think our strength is sufficient to open the wall? It’s impossible! If the expert of Eternal Kingdom fails to kill Yang Ye, then we’ll do it ourselves. Yang Ye would be at his weakest then, so our joint forces will definitely be able to annihilate him!”

The others behind him nodded to display their agreement!

At this moment, Yang Ye should almost be at his limit. So, even if Yang Ye won, he would be severely injured! They definitely had the strength to kill him then!

They got ready to attack at any moment while they waited!

In the barrier, space collapsed inch by inch, but the barrier still remained! However, there were many cracks on it!

Yang Ye and the middle aged man had suffered varying degrees of injuries. Yang Ye’s injuries were more severe while the middle aged man’s injuries were lighter. However, Yang Ye’s recovery was fast! Very fast!

Their battle was almost at its end!

In the barrier, Yang Ye laid on the ground while the middle aged man leaned against a wall. His body was covered with cuts from a sword!

Yang Ye’s tenacity had utterly exceeded his expectations!

Suddenly, Yang Ye crawled back up, and the middle aged man’s eyes narrowed slightly from the sight of this. At the same time, he clenched both his hands, but they weren’t clenched that tight.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to walk toward the middle aged man with swords in his grasp, and the madness intent on him hadn’t just remained, it was even growing in denseness!

Yang Ye was also emanating a blood red glow, and it was not slaughter intent, it was a bloody glow!

The blood beneath his skin was surging even more violently!

It had started to undergo a qualitative transformation!

The middle aged man closed his eyes slowly, “My Eternal Kingdom is in danger while you live!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly stood up, and then an extremely powerful aura swept out from him before he charged at Yang Ye!

Crack!

The cracks on the barrier of water around them instantly started growing!

He was over-exhausting himself!

At this moment, the middle aged man was using a powerful secret technique to over-exhaust his body!

It was an attack that was much stronger than any attack he’d unleashed before this!

Suddenly, Yang Ye howled with fury.

Boom!

A wave of powerful blood red light surged out from him!

His bloodline had finally been activated!

In the Primordial Pagoda, Sword Scroll stared at Yang Ye, “Let me see how strong your clan’s ancestor was!”
