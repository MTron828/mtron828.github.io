Chapter 290 – The Beast Emperor!

The violet mink’s eyes opened wide as it stared fixedly at the middle aged man who stood before it. Obviously, it was shocked by this middle aged man’s abilities.

Yang Ye was shocked as well! In the past, he was aware that this mysterious middle aged man’s strength was extremely formidable, but he’d never imagined that this middle aged man’s strength would actually be terrifying to such an extent! Because the middle aged man hadn’t done anything from the beginning, and he’d just spoken the word ‘stop’ in a flat tone. After that, the 100 terrifying violet energy swords that were controlled by the little fellow had been stopped just like that....

What sort of ability is this? Exactly what sort of strength does this middle aged man possess? Is he at the Exalt Realm? Or perhaps the Monarch Realm?

Yang Ye suppressed the shock and questions in his heart as he said, “Senior, we meet again!”

The middle aged man grinned, and then the energy swords in front of him vanished directly as if they’d never been there. This caused Yang Ye to be even more shocked!

Yang Ye said in his heart, This middle aged man’s strength is definitely not inferior to Daoist Zui and the Founding Emperor!

A wisp of surprise flashed through the middle aged man’s eyes as he gazed at Yang Ye, and then he said, “4th level Sword Intent, the peak of the First Heaven Realm’s ninth rank, a physical body that’s on par with a Spirit Rank Darkbeast, and even the Enlightened Sword Heart. Human kid, you’ve really surprised me!”

Yang Ye shook his head and didn’t reply to this. He said instead, “I wonder why Senior has come here this time?”

“To meet it!” The middle aged man gazed at the violet mink while a wisp of a complicated expression flashed through his eyes. He said, “As expected of one that’s favored by the heavens. You’re already halfway into the Spirit Rank at such a young age, and you even possess such mysterious innate spatial abilities! Is this because of your bloodline? It truly is a cause for envy!”

The violet mink blinked and didn’t say anything!

The middle aged man wanted to say something, but he hesitated for a long time and didn’t speak of it in the end. He merely sighed heavily, and the helplessness and unwillingness in it was something that even Yang Ye could sense clearly!

When he saw the middle aged man act in this way, Yang Ye started calculating in his mind. This middle aged man’s strength is definitely not inferior to Daoist Zui and the Founding Ancestor. If I’m able to form a relationship with such an expert or make him owe me a favor, then I’ll have another trump card and even more confidence when I face the Flower Palace in the future!

When he thought up to here. Yang Ye stopped hesitating and immediately decided and said, “Senior, I presume you haven’t come twice to look for the little fellow merely to meet the little fellow, right!?”

When he spoke up to here, Yang Ye paused for a moment before he continued. “If Senior needs our assistance, then so long as it’s within our ability, both the little fellow and I can give it a try!”

A strand of bright light flashed in the middle aged man’s eyes when he heard this, and he said with slight excitement, “Are you serious?”

When he finished speaking, he continued. “Can you represent it?”

Yang Ye smiled, and then he gazed at the violet mink. The later flashed over to Yang Ye’s shoulder, and then it rubbed Yang Ye’s ears with its little laws in an extremely intimate manner!

The middle aged man’s expression changed slightly when he witnessed this scene, and then he glanced deeply at Yang Ye before he said, “Human kid, you’re really making me more and more curious about you! Tell me, what are your conditions!?”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “It would be best if Senior told us what you need from us first!” He wasn’t stupid. Wouldn’t he be courting death if the middle aged man wanted him and the little fellow to do something that was heaven defying?

“What a cautious fellow!” The middle aged man chuckled and said, “Don’t worry! I won’t ask the two of you to do something that exceeds the scope of your abilities! I merely want to ask how it came to the southern territory!” As soon as he finished speaking, the middle aged man gazed at the violet mink! Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Yang Ye frowned. He naturally didn’t believe that the middle aged man had come looking for them merely to ask this! After a long period of deep thought, Yang Ye said, “Senior, this is probably not the full extent of your objective, right!?”

“Smart human!” The middle aged man grinned, and then he gazed at the violet mink and revealed a solemn expression as he said, “Under the circumstances where no experts have weakened the seal, it shouldn’t and couldn’t appear in the southern territory. However, the problem is that it has appeared here! In other words, there’s another method besides traversing the seals that can be utilized to move through the various territories!”

“It’s probably not difficult to traverse the seals with the strength Senior possesses, right?” asked Yang Ye.

“It isn’t difficult!” The middle aged man said, “However, if I leave the southern territory, then my Darkbeast Empire would probably be instantly annihilated by the humans! Moreover, I’ll have to try and overcome the Heavenpath in the near future, and no matter if I succeed or fail, I wouldn’t be able to appear in the southern territory again! At that time, the myriad of Darkbeasts in my Darkbeast Empire would probably be enslaved by the humans!”

Yang Ye said with surprise, “Senior intends to migrate all the Darkbeasts from the Darkbeast Empire to the other territories?”

The middle aged man nodded and said, “Even though Darkbeasts and humans are living in harmony right now, the humans will definitely act against my Darkbeast Race in the future. With the greedy nature of humans, how could they not be tempted by the Inner Cores we Darkbeasts possess and the countless natural treasures within the Grand Myriad Mountains? They’ll definitely act against my Darkbeast Race. The reason they haven’t until now is because of my presence, but once I’m gone, then the Grand Myriad Mountains would probably become the backyard of the humans!”

Yang Ye smiled bitterly when he heard this. Even though he was a human as well, he had no choice but to admit that this mysterious middle aged man made sense! Because how could anyone not be tempted by the countless natural treasures of the heavens and the earth within the Grand Myriad Mountains and the Inner Cores of the Darkbeasts from the Darkbeast Empire?

The middle aged man said in a low voice, “If the two of you are able to bring my Darkbeast Race to the other territories, right, it’s best if it’s the demon territory. But if you’re able to accomplish that, then this Emperor will agree to anything!”

When he heard the words ‘this emperor’, Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched, and he said, “Senior is the Beast Emperor of the Darkbeast Empire?”

The middle aged man nodded and said, “We Darkbeasts don’t go back on our word like you humans do. I’ll definitely do as I’ve said!”

Yang Ye instantly gasped when he heard the middle aged man acknowledge his guess. No wonder this middle aged man’s strength was so terrifying. So, he’s actually the owner of the Grand Myriad Mountains!

After feeling shocked, Yang Ye couldn’t help but feel excited because if the little fellow was able to help the middle aged man, then wouldn’t it mean that the Beast Emperor owed him a huge favor?

When he thought up to here, Yang Ye turned to look at the violet mink. However, the violet mink brought him back to reality because it shook its little head before their gazes to display that it was unable to accomplish it.

A wisp of disappointment that was impossible to be concealed had flashed through the Beast Emperor’s eyes when he saw the violet mink shake its head, and then he muttered in a low voice. “Could it be that the heavens really want to doom my Darkbeast Race?”

Yang Ye frowned. He pondered deeply for a short moment before he said lightly, “Little Fellow, how did you get here?”

When he heard Yang Ye, the Beast Emperor gazed at the violet mink as well. Obviously, he wanted to know the answer as well!

A layer of red instantly covered the violet mink’s little face when it heard Yang Ye, and then its eyes immediately started to spin about. Obviously, it didn’t want to answer this question....

Yang Ye rubbed the little fellow’s head and said, “Stop playing around. It’s very important to us!”

The violet mink puckered its face, and then it started to wave its little claws....

After a period of conversation, Yang Ye finally understood why the violet mink had appeared in the southern territory! The reason was actually that it was playful....

The general idea was that a battle had occurred in its clan at the demon territory, and that battle caused a mysterious spatial vortex to appear in her clan. The violet mink had been curious and playful, so it entered the spatial vortex when its loved ones weren’t paying attention....

After that, when it appeared once more, it was at this unfamiliar place, the southern territory!

Yang Ye didn’t know whether he should laugh or cry after he figures out what the little fellow meant. This little fellow actually even dared to enter a spatial vortex. Spatial vortexes are so dangerous that even an Exalt Realm expert would probably not dare to casually enter a spatial vortex!

The Beast Emperor shook his head and smiled as well. Obviously, he hadn’t expected that the little fellow had got to the southern territory in such a way.... He could create a spatial vortex as well, but would anyone dare to enter it? He was clearly aware of the dangers and terrors that resided within spatial vortexes, and the slightest mistake could cause even an Exalt Realm expert to be instantly torn into pieces! Even if one were to survive out of luck, who knew where one would be teleported to by the spatial vortex?

In short, his intentions to migrate the Darkbeast Race could be said to have ended in failure! The Beast Emperor shook his head with a helpless expression on his face, and he was just about to leave. However, right at this moment, the violet mink suddenly flashed over to the Beast Emperor, and then numerous ripples floated towards the Beast Emperor. After that, the Beast Emperor’s eyes gradually opened wider....

After a short moment, the Beast Emperor gazed at Yang Ye. He gazed at Yang Ye for a short while before he gazed once more at the violet mink, and then he said, “I believe you. Because since you chose him, then he’s absolutely not an ordinary person!”

When he spoke up to here, the Beast Emperor pondered deeply for a moment before he said, “Can my Darkbeast Race become a vassal of your clan in the demon territory?”

There were countless formidable demon beast clans in the demon territory, and these demon beast clans were absolutely not existences that the Darkbeasts of the Darkbeast Empire could compare to! If the Darkbeasts were to rashly enter the demon territory without any backing, then they would definitely become the slaves of those demon beast clans. If it was like that, then wouldn’t it be better to take the initiative to become the vassal of a formidable demon beast clan? Even though they would be a mere vassal, they would have their dignity!

This time, the violet mink fell silent. If it was according to its opinion or the opinion of those old fellows in its clan, then it was absolutely impossible! Because the bloodlines of these Darkbeasts was too inferior! An inferior bloodline represented that these Darkbeasts possessed low potential, and low potential represented that their future accomplishments would be low....

To put it simply, it was slightly embarrassing to take these Darkbeasts from the southern territory as its clan’s vassal....

The reason the violet mink hadn’t refused was that it knew what these Darkbeasts and this middle aged man meant to Yang Ye! Yang Ye’s strength was really too weak, and these Darkbeasts and this middle aged man just happened to be able to help Yang Ye....
