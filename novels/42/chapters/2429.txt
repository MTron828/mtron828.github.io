Chapter 2430 – I Really Want to Eat You!

Snowy and Yang Ye were stunned.

What the heck is she doing?

Suddenly, Yang Ye felt sharp pain come from his thigh, and he was about to kick her off, but he was afraid of harming her and hurriedly stopped himself.

Meanwhile, Snowy hugged Erya’s hand and used all her strength to pull Erya away.

Erya glanced at Snowy, and she was stunned upon seeing Snowy. It didn’t take long for the crimson red in her eyes to gradually dim down, and then she released Yang Ye’s thigh and squatted at the side.

There were two rows of deep teeth marks on Yang Ye’s thigh.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

If she’d used just a little more force, that piece of his flesh would have probably been bitten off.

Yang Ye circulated his Primordial Violet Energy to heal the injury, yet he noticed to his shock that the Primordial Violet Energy couldn’t heal it at all!

In the end, he only succeeded upon using the Eternal Energy.

“Big Brother Yang!” Meanwhile, Erya walked over to him and spoke while keeping her head down, “Sorry!”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly and rubbed her head. But he just happened to rub her little horns. Erya suddenly looked up at him and just gazed at him.

Yang Ye asked softly, “What is it?”

She gazed at him for a long time and said, “It’s nothing.”

Yang Ye squatted down and asked, “Erya, what happened?”

She cracked a smile, “I think I attained the Four World Realm!”

The Four World Realm!

Yang Ye sized up Erya. Sure enough, she was at the Four World Realm!

Yang Ye was delighted. Erya’s combat strength was extremely powerful, so now that she was at the Four World Realm, she was absolutely not an existence that ordinary Four World Realm experts could resist!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and asked, “Why did you bite me?”

She blinked and answered, “I’m very hungry!”

Meanwhile, Snowy hurriedly passed a tanghulu to her, but she shook her head, “That won’t fill my stomach!”

Snowy was stunned.

Yang Ye spoke seriously, “Erya, you seemed very unusual earlier. Even if you were hungry in the past, you would never bite me. But you didn’t seem like the Erya I knew just now.”

Erya lowered her head.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Erya, what’s going on?”

She shook her head, “I don’t know either. I-I just felt very hungry, and I wanted to eat anything I saw. Especially you, your flesh is very fragrant. I-I really want to eat you.”

She glanced timidly at Yang Ye and continued, “Big Brother Yang, you won’t beat me, right?”

Yang Ye shook his head and spoke seriously, “Erya, I don’t know what you are, but you must promise me that you can’t harm anyone else in this pagoda. We are all your friends, right?”

Erya nodded and replied seriously, “I won’t harm all of you, I never will!”

Yang Ye grinned, “Good. As for being hungry, don’t worry, many will be here to kill us soon. At that time, you can eat anyone you like.”

Erya’s eyes lit up, “Really?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course!”

She blinked, “Big Brother Yang, but I’ll be eating people!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Some people must never be eaten, even if you’re hungry; but some should be eaten.”

She cracked a smile, “I understand now!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he left the pagoda with Snowy.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda, Huang Ying glanced at Snowy who was on Yang Ye’s shoulder. Snowy blinked at Huang Ying, and then she waved her paw. Obviously, she was greeting him. As far as she was concerned, Huang Ying wasn’t an enemy since he was with Yang Ye.

Huang Ying was stunned by this, and he wondered if the Sprite Progenitor was greeting him! A moment later, he recovered from his shock and nodded slightly as a form of greeting.

The Sprite Progenitor wasn’t like what he’d imagined!

Huang Ying restrained his thoughts and gazed at Yang Ye, and then he laughed bitterly, “Brother Yang, they’ll all go mad if you let her come outside!”

Yang Ye said, “I think we should seize the initiative!”

Huang Ying asked, “You have an idea?”

Yang Ye smiled and gazed at Snowy, and the latter nodded. She glanced at the surroundings, and then she sniffed lightly.

Hiss!

IN an instant, the mysterious energy throughout the surroundings trembled, and then the energy and spirit energy in the surroundings surged toward Snowy. Moreover, the mountains in the surroundings started trembling, and then the spirit energy within them surged to Snowy as well!

Extracting spirit energy!

Huang Ying’s eyes narrowed slightly as he’d recalled something. All those years ago during the war between the desolate race and Eternal Kingdom, the desolate race had countless formidable formations too. However, they were useless once the Sprite Progenitor joined the battle.

All formations in the world required spirit energy to be maintained and used, and they were utterly useless without spirit energy. While the Sprite Progenitor didn’t know formations well, she knew spirit energy well. She could extract the spirit energy in the formations, and they would be useless without that spirit energy!

As for Snowy, while she hadn’t truly become a Sprite Progenitor yet, she had the ability to extract spirit energy.

Just like that, Yang Ye and the others watched as countless torrents of spirit energy were devoured by Snowy, and the formation soundlessly vanished.

Snowy burped and smiled brilliantly at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye rubbed her head, “Go inside and get some rest.”

Snowy nodded. She rubbed her head against Yang Ye’s head, and then she returned to the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye gazed at Huang Ying, “Brother Ying, let’s go!”

Huang Ying nodded. Suddenly, he looked to the side, “Brother Yang, we can’t.”

Yang Ye looked over, and he saw a young man walking slowly in their direction.

It was Huang Ye!

There were six other figures behind Huang Ye, and these included the Initial Emperor, Beichuan Xiu, Hanyuan Ting, and Luoli Ming. All of them were Four World Realm experts now. It was normal because they were extraordinary geniuses, and they had been extremely strong before this. Now that they had access to Huang Ye’s resources, it was absolutely easy for them to attain the Four World Realm.

Besides them, there were two other middle aged men at the Four World Realm.

7 Four World Realm experts!

Huang Ye walked over to them and grinned, “Ninth Brother, long time no see.”

Huang Ying grinned, “Where’s my eldest brother? If I’m not wrong, he should be here too, right?”

Huang Ye glanced to the right, “Isn’t he just over there?”

Huang Ying looked over, and a man walked over slowly from there. It was Huang Tianxing. Ye Gou was following behind Huang Tianxing.

The small black demon beast was not too far away from Huang Tianxing’s right. At this moment, it was glaring at Yang Ye with undisguised killing intent and viciousness. Obviously, it still remembered Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at it and just ignored it!

The small black demon beast was exasperated from being ignored by Yang Ye, and it bared its fangs at him. However, it seemed to fear something and didn’t dare to charge at Yang Ye.

Huang Ying glanced at Huang Tianxing, and Yang Ye noticed that there was a wisp of solemness in Huang Ying’s eyes.

Meanwhile, Huang Ye suddenly said, “Ninth Brother, Eldest Brother and I never expected you to dare to make this play. Making friends with Yang Ye doesn’t just allow you to make friends with an extraordinary expert, you’ll gain the help of a Sprite Progenitor. But don’t you think that’s a little too much wishful thinking?”

Huang Ying replied indifferently, “I’m just giving it a shot!”

Huang Ye grinned, “Right, we can’t let the stalemate continue, and we should decide on a winner. Come on, let me and Eldest Brother see the trump cards you’ve gathered over the years. After all, you would definitely not dare to do this without an amazing trump card, right?”

Huang Ying grinned and gazed at Yang Ye, “Brother Yang, I’ll leave my eldest brother to you, alright?”

Yang Ye glanced at Huang Tianxing and remained silent.

His intuition told him that the serious man before him wasn’t easy to deal with, or he should be described as a ruthless person.

Huang Ying added, “Brother Yang, if you can suppress my eldest brother, then we’ll be able to get through this tribulation.”

Yang Ye still remained silent.

Huang Ying laughed bitterly, “Brother Yang, deal with him and I’ll owe you a favor, alright? I’m not an ungrateful person, so I’ll never forget this favor I owe you.”

Yang Ye smiled, “I don’t understand something. You seem like you don’t want to face him?”

Huang Ying nodded, “Indeed, but not because of fear.”

Yang Ye asked, “Then why?”

Huang Ying laughed bitterly, “Because he’s my actual elder brother. We have the same mother! If I killed him, my mother would never forgive me, and it’ll be the same if he kills me.”

Same mothers!

Yang Ye nodded, “I see.”

He gazed at Huang Tianxing, “Leave him to me. You deal with the rest, alright?”

Huang Ying cupped his fist at Yang Ye, “Thank you!”

Huang Ying gazed at Huang Ye, “Brother Huang Ye, it’s time we put an end to the enmity between us.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand, “Soldiers are raised for battle! Show yourselves!”

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

In an instant, numerous black shadows soundlessly appeared in the surroundings. After that, they charged at Huang Ye’s group.

All of them were Four World Realm experts!

Huang Ying gazed at Huang Ye and grinned, “Brother Huang Ye, you possess one of the ten great physiques, but I still don’t know which one it is. So, show it to me today. Let me see how formidable one of the ten great physiques is!”

Huang Ying vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

An instant later, an extremely powerful aura and pressure swept toward Huang Ye.

The peak of the Four World Realm!

It was the aura of a true peak Four World Realm expert, and space was torn apart before it!

Huang Ye chuckled, “Then I shall!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stomped his right foot down and shot forward. The pressure and aura he emanated wasn’t any weaker to Huang Ying.

Meanwhile, an aura locked onto Yang Ye. Yang Ye looked up, and it was the small black demon beast by Huang Tianxing’s side.

Yang Ye stretched out a finger and gestured at it. The demon beast’s eyes almost split open with rage, and it charged at Yang Ye.

It grew larger and larger as it charged at him, and its aura grew increasingly stronger as well. When it arrived just a few meters away from Yang Ye, it had grown around 10 times larger!

The peak of the Four World Realm!

The demon beast opened its mouth and attempted to bite Yang Ye.

Its mouth was huge, and its fangs were really long!

Suddenly, Erya appeared in front of Yang Ye, and then she started smiling as she gazed at it.

She smiled so happily and so sincerely!

It made a chill run down Yang Ye’s spine!
