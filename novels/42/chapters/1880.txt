Chapter 1881 – He Even Hits Himself!

It was the Elegant Exalt’s voice!

Yang Ye looked over and saw a woman had appeared not too far away from him. She was one of the five Heavenly Exalts, the Elegant Exalt. There were around 10 others behind her. Yang Ye didn’t recognize them, but based on their auras, he had no doubt that they were top experts.

It was an ambush!

It was an ambush for him!

Yang Ye glanced at the Elegant Exalt and said, “My intuition tells me that your true goal isn’t to avenge your elder brother. Right?”

The Elegant Exalt’s eyes narrowed slightly. She was about to speak when Yang Ye added, “You’ve lived for so many years, so I refuse to believe that you’re a fool. You should be very well aware if I had anything to do with your brother’s death, and you should be very well aware of the strength I possess. However, you’re still trying to kill me. That’s not normal at all!”

The Elegant Exalt pondered deeply for a moment and replied, “Is that important?”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “Tell me who it is, and I’ll spare you!”

She chuckled in response, “You’ll kill me? Yang Ye, everyone here is in a higher realm of cultivation than you. There’s a formation here too. So…”

Suddenly, the space in an area of 500m trembled slightly, and then a ray of light flashed.

Hiss!

The head of a middle aged man beside the Elegant Exalt suddenly flew up into the air.

Blood sprayed out like a fountain!

Everyone here was stunned, including the Elegant Exalt. She hadn’t expected Yang Ye to instantly kill someone in front of her.

At this moment, a trace of fear had risen within all the experts here. Of course, they felt even more disbelief!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye started walking slowly in their direction, “I’ll give you one last chance. Tell me who’s pulling the strings, and I’ll leave.”

The Elegant Exalt gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “I’ll have a chance to survive if I don’t tell you!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she waved her hand. In an instant, the barrier of light in the sky suddenly started trembling, and then countless rays of light shot down from the sky like a meteor shower.

At the same time, she stared at Yang Ye, “Attack!”

As soon as she gave the order, the experts here charged at Yang Ye.

Their auras were the first to arrive before Yang Ye.

Suddenly, Yang Ye closed his eyes, “Sword!”

As soon as he said that, 36 ethereal swords appeared around him, and then the space in an area of 500km around him trembled. An instant later, rays of light filled the area!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Countless rays of sword energy crisscrossed.

The Sword Domain!

The Invincible Sword Domain!

Just like that, this continued for around a quarter of an hour, and then the rays of light gradually dispersed. At this moment, only Yang Ye and the Elegant Exalt remained.

She gazed at Yang Ye with a slightly blank gaze, “What was that…?”

“A sword formation!” Yang Ye turned around and walked away once he finished speaking!

“A sword formation…” She muttered softly on the spot, and then her figure gradually turned ethereal before finally vanishing on the spot.

In the boundless starry sky.

Yang Ye stood there with his eyes closed, and he was in deep thought.

As he recalled the past, he had a stronger feeling that someone was targeting him. Since he arrived at Heaven Pillar Mountain, it was first the Night Emperor and the Red Robed Heavenly Exalt. Now, it was the Elegant Exalt… So, someone was definitely pulling the strings!

Someone capable of ordering them around was definitely one of the three ancient cultivators or an expert with strength comparable to one of the three ancient cultivators!

Who is it? Yang Ye pondered deeply for a long time, and then he shook his head. He decided to stop thinking about it. Because no matter who it was, he was certain that person would definitely show himself or herself again. Now, that person was aware of his true strength, so if that person was going to attack, that person would definitely have to attack personally or use someone comparable to an ancient cultivator!

Besides that, Yang Ye hadn’t forgotten that he had to go to the upper universe, and it was a place filled with experts!

A short while later, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and left.

He didn’t head back to Heaven Pillar Mountain, and he’d gone towards the outside world. He was heading for the Yang Clan.

…

Some time had passed since Yang Ye left for Heaven Pillar Mountain, and he really missed Su Qingshi and the others. Now, he was free, so he could go visit them.

The ancient city.

The Yang Clan obeyed the orders that Yang Lianshuang had given them before leaving, so they still hadn’t re-entered the outside world.

They were keeping a low profile and growing here!

That was the Yang Clan’s strategy, and Yang Ye approved of it. Because both him and Yang Lianshuang would be going to the upper universe. Once they left, if the Yang Clan didn’t have any other new geniuses, then the Yang Clan would definitely be in an extremely dangerous situation.

After all, the Yang Clan didn’t have many top-rate experts left after the internal strife it went through.

In a garden within the ancient city. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Suddenly, a talisman flew up into the air, and then a clear and melodious voice resounded, “Explode!”

As soon as the voice resounded, the talisman trembled slightly before exploding apart. In an instant, countless multicolored rays of light exploded out from it like a rain of fireworks! It was gorgeous!

Meanwhile, a young girl suddenly appeared in the garden. She was around the age of 18 or 19. She wore a dress with flower petals embroidered on it, and a small ponytail hung down her back. She was cute yet wild at the same time.

There was a little girl who seemed around the age of 4 or 5 standing on her left. The little girl had two ponytails hanging down behind her head, and lightning flickered incessantly through her body.

On the young girl’s right was another young girl who seemed to be around the age of 14 or 15. She wore a tight green dress, and a thin green cape. There was a sword hanging on her waist!

As they watched the dazzling rain of light, the little girl on the left clapped and cheered, “Big Sister Bao’er, two more!”

The young girl was Bao’er!

Bao’er grinned and gently rubbed the little girl’s head. She said, “Lei Lin, give me some lightning when I craft talismans later. It’ll make the talismans even stronger and beautiful!”

Lei Lin hurriedly nodded, “Okay!”

Meanwhile, Bao’er looked at the young girl on her right and said, “Xue’er, you seem like something’s troubling you?”

The young girl with a sword was Yang Ye’s daughter, Yang Nianxue.

Yang Nianxue pondered deeply for a moment and replied, “I want to go look for Dad!”

“The Little Laborer…” Bao’er spoke softly, “It’s probably impossible. The place he’s at right now is definitely extremely dangerous. Your mother won’t let you go!”

Yang Nianxue tightened her grip on her sword and said, “I’m at the Monarch Realm now! I’m very strong!”

She gazed at Lei Lin, “Lei Lin, I’m very strong, right?”

Lei Lin bit her pinky and hesitated for a moment, “You… you aren’t as strong as me…”

Yang Nianxue blushed, and then she glared at Lei Lin. Lei Lin was a Sprite King, so her speed of growth was extremely fast. Moreover, she could control lightning. So, not to mention the Monarch Realm, even those at the Deity Realm couldn’t defeat her!

Bao’er couldn’t help but roar with laughter when she heard Lei Lin.

Meanwhile, Yang Nianxue suddenly said, “Big Sister Bao’er, why don’t we sneak off to that place called Heaven Pillar Mountain?”

“Sneak there?” Bao’er blinked, “That isn’t very good, right?”

Yang Nianxue smiled, “Why not? You’re so strong. So, can anyone harm us?”

Bao’er thought for a moment, and then she gazed at Lei Lin, ”Lei Lin, are you coming?”

“Yes!” Lei Lin nodded.

She’d always followed Bao’er’s decisions.

Bao’er rubbed her chin and thought for a moment before she said, “Auntie Qingshi and the others will definitely not let us go. So, if we want to go, we must sneak out. How do we sneak out?”

Yang Nianxue and Lei Lin stared at Bao’er without blinking, and their eyes were filled with anticipation.

Bao’er had the most tricks up her sleeve!

A short while later, Bao’er’s eyes lit up, “I know!” She withdrew two talismans and said, “These are Concealment Talismans. They can conceal our auras. However, they last for a very short while, so we have to be quick!”

Yang Nianxue and Lei Lin immediately gazed at those talismans.

Even though there were experts protecting them in secret, Bao’er’s tricks somehow succeeded, and the three little fellows managed to sneak out of the city without alerting anyone.

At a corner outside the city, all three of them had excitement in their eyes.

Bao’er withdrew a map and scanned it. In the end, she pointed at a point on the map, “It’s right there. Come, let’s go. Lei Lin, summon lightning and take us there!”

Lei Lin nodded, and then she waved her hand. In an instant, a small lightning dragon appeared before them. Bao’er and Lei Li’s figure shot onto it, and then Lei Lin quickly did the same.

“Let’s go!” Lei Lin patted the dragon, and it transformed into a bolt of lightning that vanished into the clouds.

Around an hour later.

The entire city… No, the entire Yang Clan was filled with noise.

The three little lords were gone!

In an instant, all the experts of the Yang Clan left in search of them.

…

Lei Lin’s lightning dragon was extremely fast. They shot through the clouds while leaving rumbling thunderclaps in their wake. It was quite a shocking sight.

They were causing a huge commotion!

Needless to say, they weren’t trying to hide at all, and the divine sense of experts frequently swept past them.

After some time, they suddenly stopped because two middle aged men had appeared before them.

“Tsk tsk…” The middle aged man on the left gazed at Lei Lin, “Big Brother, I didn’t expect to see a Sprite King here!”

“It really is a Sprite King!” The middle aged man on the right wore a luxurious robe and had a trace of excitement in his eyes, “She’ll be perfect as an Equipment Spirit!”

Yang Nianxue glanced at them, and then she gazed at Bao’er, “Big Sister Bao’er, what do they want?”

Bao’er hesitated for a moment and said, “They may be thinking of robbing us!”

“Robbing us?” Yang Nianxue’s eyes lit up, “Is it the same thing that you always do with us?”

Bao’er nodded, but her expression was quite unsightly. She knew much more than Yang Nianxue and Lei Lin, so she naturally understood the situation that they were in. At this moment, she felt a little regret. Earlier, she’d only thought about how fun it would be, but she hadn’t considered how extremely dangerous the outside world was.

What should we do?

At this moment, she felt quite helpless.

Yang Nianxue was about to speak when the middle aged man on the right suddenly waved his hand and clawed at them.

Bao’er’s expression changed slightly when she saw the middle aged man attack, and she gazed at Lei Lin. Lei Lin patted the lightning dragon, and it instantly transformed into a bolt of lightning that shot towards the middle aged man.

A wisp of disdain arose on the corners of the middle aged man’s mouth, and he waved his right hand lightly. In an instant, the lightning dragon was obliterated.

Bao’er and the others were stunned by the sight of this.

Bao’er’s countenance was slightly pale as she gazed at the middle aged man, “A True Realm expert…”

“Little girl, you have quite the discerning gaze!” The middle aged man laughed coldly and was about to attack again.

Suddenly, Yang Nianxue spoke in a trembling voice, “I’m.. I’m warning you. Don’t be rash. My Dad is very strong…”

Bao’er hurriedly nodded, “Extremely strong. If.. if he gets angry, he even hits himself!”

Lei Li nodded as well, “Big Brother is extremely fierce, even the sky turns red before him!”

The middle aged man chuckled, “He’s that strong? What’s your dad’s name?”

Meanwhile, the man in a luxurious robe frowned, “Why waste your breath on them?”

The middle aged man nodded, and then he clawed at them again.

A wave of powerful aura instantly enveloped them, causing them to feel like a huge mountain was pressing down on them, causing even breathing to feel difficult for them.

Suddenly, Yang Nianxue shouted, “My Dad’s Yang Ye! His name is Yang Ye! His name is Yang Ye…”

As soon as she said those words, the claw suddenly stopped in midair.

The middle aged men exchanged glances. In the end, the man in a luxurious robe hesitated for a moment and asked, “Er… Miss, is your father the Yang Ye who uses a sword?”

Yang Nianxue quickly nodded.

Meanwhile, Bao’er suddenly spoke in a trembling voice, “That Yang Ye, whose eyes and entire body turn red when he gets angry. He… He… Just don’t bully us. If he gets angry, he’ll kill himself, then kill both of you. No! No! He’ll kill both of you, then kill himself. He…”

As she spoke and spoke, her voice started to tremble severely.

After they heard Yang Nianxue and Bao’er, the middle aged men exchanged glances, and they saw an extremely solemn expression in each other’s eyes.

A short while later, the middle aged man in a luxurious robe took a deep breath, and then he gazed at Yang Nianxue while forcing out a brilliant smile, “Young Miss, all… all of this is just a misunderstanding…”
