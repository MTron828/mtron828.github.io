Chapter 1567 - Kill Yang Ye Within 30 Moves!

Translator: InVader

The devil race was very strong, and it wasn’t inferior to the demon race at all. However, the devil race could only be considered to be unlucky to have offended Yang Ye.

Around a breath of time after Yang Ye vanished, Mo Jiang’s figure vanished as well.

Gu Tian was puzzled, “Is he…?”

Gu Mo shook his head, “He wouldn’t do something foolish like fighting Yang Ye in a one on one battle.”

Gu Mo glanced at the others and added, “Once all of you return to your clans, immediately use all your resources to find out who was pulling the strings. Since they want to use our demon race as pawns, then we’ll make them pay a terrible price.”

As he finished speaking, Gu Mo’s face turned icy cold.

The demon race was clearly in extreme danger this time. If the Nether Pavilion really came, it represented that the demon race would enter into battle with the Nether Pavilion, and the demon race would definitely suffer severe losses during the battle!

They didn’t want to fight Yang Ye to the death, and they really couldn’t afford to fight the Nether Pavilion!

Gu Tian nodded, “Our fellow demons can’t just die for nothing!”

…

Not long after Yang Ye left, he suddenly stopped because Mo Jiang had appeared in front of him.

Mo Jiang stared at Yang Ye, “You can’t kill Xiaoleng!”

“How laughable!” A cold smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “I can’t kill her because you said so?”

Mo Jiang slowly clenched his right fist, but it didn’t take long for him to release it, “Yang Ye, I know that you hate her for bringing your friends to the large world. But do you know that your friend would be dead now if it wasn’t for her. She refused to let us imprison the Sprite Lord, but she didn’t have the authority to change anything. As for after we extracted its consciousness, we intended to destroy it to put an end to all future troubles, but she took it and fled with it. If it wasn’t for her, your friend and the Sprite Lord’s consciousness would have vanished from this world!”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, “If it wasn’t for her, Zi’er’s whereabouts wouldn’t be unknown. If it wasn’t for her, Snowy wouldn’t have been reduced to her current state. She caused all of this.” When he spoke up to this point, Yang Ye opened his eyes and stared at Mo Jiang, “Either she or your Divine Phoenix Clan has to die.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye intended to leave, but Mo Jiang suddenly said, “If you insist on killing her, then we can just fight to the death and cause our mutual destruction. I’ll send her a message to destroy the Sprite Lord’s consciousness right now!”

Om!

A sword howl resounded, and then a strand of sword energy tore through the air and instantly arrived before Mo Jiang.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and Mo Jiang was blasted away.

Yang Ye stared at Mo Jiang, “Are you threatening me?”

Mo Jiang spoke in a low voice, “Yang Ye, Xiaoleng is my clan’s only hope. If you kill her, my clan will have no hope and future. Since it has no hope and future, what’s the point of us staying alive? If you kill her, my entire clan will head down to the lower dimensions. Even if all our Rebirth Realm experts die, we’ll make you pay a terrible price.”

Mo Jiang flicked a scroll to Yang Ye, “This is a map of the Demon Territory and Xiaoleng’s position. Decide yourself whether you’re going to kill her or not.”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure transformed into a wave of fire that vanished into the distance.

Yang Ye remained silent on the spot for a moment, and then he took the scroll and vanished on the spot.

Around three breaths of time after Yang Ye vanished, a man and a woman appeared there.

The man held a saber while the woman held a sword, and both of them lacked an arm.

The woman suddenly asked, “Why didn’t we just kill him?”

The man replied, “Master said he doesn’t have to die yet!”

She fell silent for a moment, and then she said, “That kid is an extraordinary genius. Even our joint forces won’t be able to kill him in five years from now.”

The man asked, “What about now?”

She spoke indifferently, “I’ll take his life in 30 moves!”

The man fell silent for a long time, and then he said, “White Earth, you’re the only one who has fought both the Unfettered One and Jian Wuji. Is it possible for him to surpass them?”

She remained silent for a long time before she said, “If it’s in the same realm of cultivation, then his strength has surpassed Jian Wuji, and it should be slightly inferior to the Unfettered One.”

The man asked, “Jian Wuji is inferior to him?”

The woman, White Earth, shook her head slightly, “Jian Wuji’s natural talent isn’t weaker to theirs at all. However, his path isn’t one where he bares his edge to all, and he always holds back when in battle with others. However, the Unfettered One and Yang Ye are different. They give it their all in battle. So, if they truly encounter each other in battle, Jian Wuji would be at a disadvantage. Because he’s always trying to give others a chance.”

The man said, “You said that there’s a gap between Yang Ye and the Unfettered One. What’s the difference between them?”

“Pureness!” She continued, “The Unfettered One’s Sword Dao is pure, but Yang Ye’s isn’t. He has too many ties and burdens. However, Yang Ye stays true to his heart, so his heart towards the sword is without flaw and obstruction. Moreover, he possesses slaughter intent. He isn’t purely on the path of the sword, and it’s more suitable for him to be considered to be on the path of evil.”

The man remained silent for a long time, and then he said, “Master said that you, the Unfettered One, and Jian Wuji are the strongest sword cultivators in our universe. Now, there’s Yang Ye as well.”

She lowered her head slightly, “If Master doesn’t kill him now, it may not be possible to kill him in the future.”

The man shook his head slightly, “Master has her own plans. We just have to do as she says. Let’s go!”

As soon as he finished speaking, both of them vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye stopped around 5,000km away, and Little Sky was in front of him.

Yang Ye asked, “Someone was following me just now?”

Little Sky nodded.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly because he actually hadn’t noticed it!

Little Sky said, “Don’t put on such a face. They were much stronger than you. It’s normal for you to have been unable to notice them!”

Yang Ye’s eyebrows were raised, “Much stronger than me?”

“Of course!” Little Sky nodded, “If those two fellows wanted to kill you, you would be dead. Unless that flame of yours lends you a hand. Otherwise, even that lousy diagram of yours wouldn’t be able to save you!”

“Lousy?!” Yang Ye’s face darkened, “That’s the Stellar Sword Diagram. It’s extremely powerful. Didn’t you see how powerful it was?”

Little Sky shook her head, “Lousy diagram. It’s ugly, and I don’t like it!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Yang Ye shook his head and spoke seriously, “Little Sky, you said that they were much stronger than me? What do you mean?” He wasn’t trying to brag but if it was a one on one battle, then he didn’t fear Rebirth Realm experts at all. But Little Sky said that they were much stronger than him, so he didn’t really believe it.

Little Sky replied, “They are stronger than you. They are on the verge of advancing above the Rebirth Realm. No, actually, they’ve advanced above the Rebirth Realm. However, they are restrained by this world, so they’re still at the Rebirth Realm. But their strength has far surpassed the Rebirth Realm. Right, it’s just like that Blood Maiden you met in the lower dimensions. They aren’t any weaker to her. Of course, she seems to have not fully recovered her true strength. In any case, you aren’t a match for them no matter what.”

They are on par with Blood Maiden! Yang Ye’s pupils constricted slightly. He knew Blood Maiden’s strength well. Even Rebirth Realm experts were trash before her! But those two people who were following him were actually on par with Blood Maiden!

Who have I offended now?

Yang Ye couldn’t figure it out no matter how he racked his brains. It was definitely not the War Pavilion, Emperor Sect, or demon race. Because if it was them, those two experts would have killed him by now. Since it wasn’t them, then who?

Meanwhile, Little Sky suddenly walked over to Yang Ye and patted Yang Ye’s stomach lightly, “Take care. If you really are killed one day… Don’t worry, I…”

Yang Ye said, “You’ll avenge me?”

She shook her head and spoke seriously, “I’ll bury you!”

Yang Ye’s face froze, and then he shook his head, “Little Sky, that really makes me sad. If someone wanted to kill you, I would definitely stop them; and if you’re killed, I would definitely avenge you.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Little Sky was stunned on the spot, and then she stamped her feet and spoke softly, “I don’t even know how to fight, how would I avenge you? The most… the most I can do is ask Little Little Sky and the others to help avenge you. No, Little Little Sky is too weak. Hmm, who should I call? Right…” Her eyes lit up, “The Sky Devil Beast. That fellow is powerful. Even a hundred Yang Ye’s can’t defeat him. However, that fellow seems to be sleeping. I wonder if he woke up. Right, I’ll go look for him soon!”

As soon as she finished speaking, her figure vanished on the spot.

…

All along the way, Yang Ye shot forward at maximum speed. He was naturally not rushing to save Mo Xiaoleng, and he merely wanted Snowy’s consciousness which she had.

He absolutely wouldn’t allow anything to happen to Snowy’s consciousness!

That was why he’d taken the initiative to travel to the devil race’s territory!

As for those experts that were following him and that person who was scheming against him, he couldn’t be bothered to pay any attention to them. All he wanted to do was save Snowy’s consciousness and find Zi’er. As for everything else, he didn’t want to pay any attention to it.

Two days later, Yang Ye was finally teleported to the Devil Territory through a teleportation formation in the Demon Territory.

It was his first time here. Fortunately, Mo Jiang had given that scroll to him, and it contained some basic information about the devil race and Mo Xiaoleng’s current location.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and vanished towards the distance.
