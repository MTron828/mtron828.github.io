Chapter 1000 – Did I Say That You Could Go?

Was the man in embroidered clothes strong?

In Yang Ye’s opinion, the man was very strong, extremely strong. He was much stronger than Qing Daofu. If it was at any other time before this, even if he could defeat the man, it would be absolutely impossible for Yang Ye to kill the man with such ease.

Yet now, Yang Ye possessed numerous equipment at the Divine Rank, and he even utilized a Divine Rank technique and Void Rank sword intent. Under such circumstances, his strength had risen significantly. So, not to mention that the man was only a high rank Half-Saint, Yang Ye was confident in his ability to go face the man directly in combat even if the man was a Saint!

The reason that the man in embroidered clothes had been killed in an instant without any ability to resist was because the man had been careless.

From the beginning until the end, the man in embroidered clothes had looked down upon Yang Ye with a sense of superiority. If it wasn’t for that, it would be absolutely impossible for him to have been killed in an instant with such ease when he had the black dragon’s assistance!

Of course, Yang Ye was confident in his ability to kill him even if the man in embroidered clothes hadn’t underestimated him!

“Human! You’re courting death!” The black dragon roared with fury when he saw Yang Ye kill the man in embroidered clothes, and he swung his enormous figure in Yang Ye’s direction.

The terrifying force and Dragon Pressure which came from the black dragon’s enormous body caused numerous mountains behind Yang Ye to be blasted into powder!

However, Yang Ye remained motionless on the spot!

Yang Ye suddenly roared, “Fuck off!”

As soon as he spoke, Yang Ye activated the bloodline he inherited from the Dragon Ancestor, and an invisible wave of pressure swept forward towards the huge black dragon. Everyone here watched with astonishment as the might of the Saint Rank dragon actually weakened more than 10 times in an instant upon being enveloped by the invisible pressure which Yang Ye emanated. At the same time, the black dragon started to slow down, and it didn’t take long for the black dragon to be forced to a stop in midair.

The spectators were astounded by the sight of this!

Even Zhu Yuan and Welkin Wolf Demon King’s eyes were opened wide at this moment, and they seemed like they’d seen a ghost.

Meanwhile, Oblivion Maiden’s jet black brows were knit together as well, and there was a trace of bewilderment in her eyes.

At this moment, the black dragon’s eyes were filled with shock and bewilderment as well. Besides that, there was a trace of fear within them as well. Because he sensed a strand of pressure just now, it was a strand bloodline pressure!

Bloodline pressure!

He was at the Saint Realm, so his bloodline had been improved and transformed. Besides an Ancestral Dragon, there was no other dragon that could cause him to suffer suppression from bloodline pressure. However, he’d actually been suppressed by bloodline pressure, and it was even from a human!

“Human! Why do you have the bloodline of my Dragon Clan!?” The black dragon gazed at Yang Ye with vigilance and fear.

A glow of excitement flickered in Yang Ye’s eyes when he noticed that the Dragon Ancestor’s blood was actually effective against the black dragon. Because it meant that most dragons would be suppressed by his bloodline, and it meant that this huge fellow in front of him wasn’t that troublesome to deal with anymore.

Yang Ye suddenly stretched out a finger and pointed it at the huge black dragon, and he roared with fury, “Do you know who I am!?” His voice was like a thunderclap that terrified countless cultivators and demon beasts.

The black dragon’s eyelids twitched, and then he spoke fiercely, “Human! I admit that your bloodline can affect me, but if you think that you can rely on that bloodline to defeat me, then I have to say that you’re dreaming.”

“How presumptuous!” Yang Ye roared, “I’m the Scion of the Dragons who the Patriarch personally appointed, and my status is equivalent to the Patriarch. You actually dare to speak to me like that? Are you trying to get skinned alive and suffer having your tendons pulled out!?”

“The Scion of the Dragons?” A wisp of bewilderment flashed through the black dragon’s eyes. A long time passed before he spoke in a deep voice, “Human! Stop talking nonsense! When did my Dragon Clan ever have a Scion?”

When he spoke up to this point, the black dragon’s voice became cold, “Do you know what consequences await you for misusing the name of my Dragon Clan?”

Yang Ye asked, “Then tell me why I have the bloodline of the Dragon Clan!”

The black dragon spoke in a low voice, “Maybe you forcefully extracted it from a member of my Dragon Clan and fused it with your own bloodline!”

“How stupid are you?” Yang Ye ridiculed, “Just think about it. Whose bloodline would I have to extract in order to affect you with my bloodline?”

“The Patriarch at least....” The black dragon’s pupils constricted when he spoke up to this point. Because he noticed that it was impossible. Extract the bloodline of the Dragon Clan’s patriarch? Not to mention Pine Prefecture, there wasn’t anyone in the Central Divine Prefecture who had the ability to do that! In other words....

Yang Ye knew that it was working when he noticed the change in the black dragon’s expression, and he hurriedly said, “If the Patriarch hadn’t willingly given me his bloodline, could anyone have been able to extract his blood?”

The black dragon was still quite doubtful, “Then why have I never heard about this Scion of the Dragons?”

“That’s because it’s a classified secret of our Dragon Clan!” Yang Ye continued, “The patriarch gave me a secret mission to complete. Anyway, it isn’t something you need to know. Understand? Right, the patriarch said that if I am to encounter trouble, then all dragons of our clan must help me unconditionally!”

When he spoke up to this point, Yang Ye pointed at Welkin Wolf Demon King, “Now, help me kill him!”

Welkin Wolf Demon King’s eyelids twitched when he heard this, and he hurriedly looked at the black dragon. He was horrified when he noticed that the black dragon seemed to be hesitating, and he quickly said, “You absolutely can’t believe him so easily. If he really is that so-called Scion of the Dragons, then based on your strength and status in your clan, how could your patriarch have not told you about him? Moreover, even if the patriarch of the Dragon Clan appointed someone as a Scion of your clan, how could it possibly be such a weak person?”

The black dragon fell silent for a long time. In the end, he gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Human! I still refuse to believe that you’re that Scion which you say you are.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

“Intuition!” The black dragon looked Yang Ye in the eyes and said, “I have no reason to refute anything you’ve said. However, my intuition tells me that you aren’t who you say you are.”

His intuition!? The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched, and then he said, “So?”

The black dragon pondered deeply for a while, and then he said, “You’ve killed the young master of the Lu Clan’s branch family. So, you have to come with me! Don’t worry, you’ll just be making a trip with me. Once we return to the Central Divine Prefecture, it’ll become clear whether you really are a Scion of my Dragon Clan. If it’s true, then not to mention a branch family of the Lu Clan, even the entire Lu Clan would dare not harm you!”

Yang Ye’s face fell, and he said, “Do you realize that doing that would spoil the patriarch’s plans!?”

He wanted to just kill the black dragon and refine him into a Sword Servant. After all, he was 50% confident in his ability to kill the black dragon with the help of the bloodline pressure he possessed. However, he didn’t dare to act on such a thought. Because if he were to fight the black dragon right now, then Zhu Yuan and Welkin Wolf Demon King would definitely attack as well. Moreover, while the huge black dragon wasn’t a big threat to him, the black dragon was a huge threat to everyone else in Ocean of Clouds City!

So long as the black dragon disregarded everything and slammed his body against the city, then at least half the residents of the city would perish!

Thus, Yang Ye had no choice but to use his brains to turn the situation around!

The black dragon replied, “Then produce something that proves you’re the Scion of my Dragon Clan. So long as you can produce proof which convinces me, then I’ll help you unconditionally. Otherwise, you have to come back to the Central Divine Prefecture with me!” It was naturally impossible for the black dragon to help Yang Ye fight Welkin Wolf Demon King just because of something Yang Ye had said.

“Proof!?” Welkin Wolf Demon King laughed coldly, “If he did have proof, he would have produced it a long time ago, and he wouldn’t have been wasting his breath until now. In my opinion, he definitely obtained that bloodline through forbidden methods.”

The black dragon’s gaze towards Yang Ye turned slightly hostile when he heard Welkin Wolf Demon King.

Suddenly, Yang Ye started laughing, “I didn’t want to reveal it, but I have no other choice. Black dragon, if the patriarch’s plans are spoiled because I’m exposed, then you’ll be an eternal traitor of my Dragon Clan, and even the death of all your relatives wouldn’t be sufficient to atone for it!”

As soon as he finished speaking, numerous golden scales suddenly surged out from within Yang Ye, and it didn’t take long for them to cover Yang Ye’s entire body. Moreover, 2 golden dragon horns grew out from his head!

Draconification! It was an ability he obtained when he gained the inheritance of the Dragon Ancestor all those years ago. It was a huge help to him in battle in the beginning, but as his strength and physical body was improved incessantly, the amount of help it provided him had become practically insignificant. So, he practically didn’t utilize it anymore. Now, he had no choice but to try and use it to trick the black dragon!

Everyone here was stunned when they saw Yang Ye transform like that, and it included Welkin Wolf Demon King. He hadn’t expected that Yang Ye could actually transform like that. At this moment, Yang Ye simply seemed like a being that was half man and half dragon!

“An... an inheritance of my Dragon Clan....” The black dragon’s eyes were filled with shock, “Human! You... you actually obtained an inheritance of my Dragon Clan. You... you....”

The inheritance of the Dragon Clan was usually given to dragons alone. But he hadn’t imagined that this human would have actually obtained an inheritance of the Dragon Clan, and he felt quite a bit of disbelief.

Yang Ye said, “Black dragon, do you need further proof?”

The black dragon gazed at Yang Ye while a wisp of complicated emotions flashed through his eyes. In the end, he shook his head slightly and said, “Even if you aren’t that Scion which you say that you are, there’s definitely a deep relationship between you and my Dragon Clan. So, I’ll help you today!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the black dragon turned his head and roared at Welkin Wolf Demon King, and then he charged in Welkin Wolf Demon King’s direction!

A wisp of ferocity flashed through Welkin Wolf Demon King’s eyes, and then he immediately returned to his original form. He transformed into a huge black wolf that wasn’t any smaller than the black dragon!

The dragon and wolf didn’t fight in the sky, they entered a pocket of space instead. Because regardless of whether it was the black dragon or Welkin Wolf Demon King, both of them didn’t dare to offend the Heaven Dao at a time like this. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief in his heart when the black dragon and Welkin Wolf Demon King entered into a pocket of space. He withdrew his gaze and looked at Zhu Yuan instead.

The corners of Zhu Yuan’s eyes twitched, and then he glanced at Qing and Li Yun who was a Sword Servant now. Zhu Yuan pondered deeply for a moment before he said, “Yang Ye, my Dao Order will get even with you in the future. I’ll give face to the Ancient Sword School and Ocean of Clouds Academy today, and I won’t make a fuss about it with you for now. Disciples of my Dao Order, come with me!”

As he spoke, he was about to tear space open and leave with the disciples of the Dao Order.

“Did I say that you could go?” Suddenly, Yang Ye’s voice resounded in the air above the city.
