Chapter 1940 – I‘m Very Vengeful!

Yin Hou had definitely noticed something!

Moreover, it was clearly linked to him!

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time before he gazed at Li Jiang, “Have you notified the shaman race?”

Li Jiang shook his head, “Only Lady Yin Hou can contact the Shaman Dimension across the boundary. We can’t. So, the Shaman Dimension knows nothing!”

The Endless Ocean!

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he said, “Let’s go see the Sovereign of Sky!”

Yin Hou had been attacked in the Sky Dimension, so the sky race had to give them an explanation!

Li Jiang nodded, and then they went to Sky City.

Yang Ye and Li Jiang arrived before Sky Palace, but an old man obstructed their path.

Li Jiang stepped forward, “I’m Li Jiang from the shaman race. I wish to seek an audience with the Sovereign of Sky.”

The old man glanced at Li Jiang, “Go back to where you came from!”

Li Jiang’s face fell, and he hurriedly said, “Lady Yin Hou and us were ambushed while passing through the Endless Ocean. Presently, Lady Yin Hou has been captured by them. I…”

The old man suddenly interrupted Li Jiang, “What does that have to do with my sky race?”

Li Jiang spoke solemnly, “We were ambushed in the Sky Dimension. Doesn’t the sky race have to take responsibility?”

The old man ridiculed, “How laughable. Countless others pass through my Sky Dimension via all sorts of methods every single year. Are you telling me that it’s my sky race’s fault if something happens to them?”

Li Jiang still wanted to say something, but Yang Ye suddenly said, “We want to see the Sovereign of Sky!”

“See the Sovereign of Sky?” The old man laughed coldly, “Who do you think you are?”

Yang Ye gazed at the old man for a long time and said, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye turned around and left once he finished speaking.

Li Jiang quickly followed after him.

Once Yang Ye left, the old man frowned, and then he closed his eyes slowly and spoke softly, “He hasn’t left. He’s still in Sky City. Hurry!”

…

Li Jiang spoke solemnly, “Brother Yang, is this incident related to the sky race?”

Yang Ye replied, “I’m not sure, but it seems like it’s quite complicated. Contact your sister and Li Wu, and then immediately find a way to get back to the Shaman Dimension.”

Li Jiang hurriedly asked, “What about you?”

Yang Ye replied, “I’m going to save Yin Hou!”

Save Yin Hou!

Yang Ye was a person who avenged enmity and repaid kindness. Yin Hou had been kind to him, so now that she was in danger, he naturally wouldn’t stand by idly!

Li Jiang said, “I’ll go with you!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Your current mission is to find your sister and Li Wu, and then take them back to the Shaman Dimension and notify the shaman race. Because this incident is definitely not just that simple.”

Li Jiang hesitated for a moment and said, “Be careful!”

Yang Ye nodded, “You too. Right, don’t use the same way. It’s best to take a remote path.”

Li Jiang nodded, “Take care!”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye left Sky City and traveled towards the Endless Ocean.

Yin Hou had vanished there, so it was definitely linked to Gu Nie!

Meanwhile, Hou Qing’s voice suddenly resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Kid, thank you!”

Yang Ye shook his head and remained silent.

Even though he hadn’t known Yin Hou for a long time, she’d taken really good care of him. Perhaps it was because he’d said that he was Hou Qing’s disciple. However, that wasn’t important. What was important was that she’d helped him tremendously!

Men should repay their debts and avenge their enmity while they were still alive!

Meanwhile, Hou Qing said, “It would take at least three Dao Realm experts to capture her. But your current strength isn’t just incapable of fighting a Dao Realm expert, even killing a 4th stage Enlightened Realm expert would be difficult for you. So, return to the shaman race for now!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye said, “I want to give it a try. Otherwise, I would look down on myself if I just left!”

Hou Qing didn’t say anything else.

Not long after Yang Ye left Sky City, he suddenly stopped.

“You’ve noticed my presence?” A voice suddenly resounded from behind Yang Ye.

Yang Ye turned around, and he noticed that it was the old man who’d obstructed Li Jiang and his path earlier.

Yang Ye said, “If I’m not wrong, you should know about what happened to Yin Hou.”

The old man nodded, “I do!”

Yang Ye asked, “Can you tell me about it?”

The old man smiled, “Of course. Actually, perhaps you’re not aware of it but she isn’t our target, you are!”

“Me?” Yang Ye frowned, “What do you mean?”

The old man smiled, “The Sovereign of Man’s sword! Many were tempted when you revealed the Sovereign of Man’s sword! Allow me to explain it to you. These people include the sky race, spirit race, devil race, and human race. Oh right, the shaman race too!”

He shook his head and smiled, “Some of them want to take it for themselves, and some have even simpler desires. They just don’t want it to return to the Sovereign of Man’s possession.”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Hou Qing suddenly said, “He’s buying time!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I know.”

He gazed at the old man, “Why did all of you act against Yin Hou’s group?”

“She’s a barrier for us!” The old man continued, “If she didn’t try to protect you and left herself, then nothing would have happened to you. Unfortunately, she noticed some things, and just refused to leave and even tried to notify you. So, we had no choice but to act against her.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Now, I understand everything.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he looked up at the old man, “You seem to be at the 3rd stage of the Enlightened Realm?”

The old man nodded, “I know you’re an extraordinary genius, and the 3rd stage of the Enlightened Realm isn’t sufficient to do anything to you. So, I’ve notified the others. They’ll be here in 30 breaths of time. Even though I can’t kill you in that amount of time, it's easy for me to keep you busy for that duration. What do you think?”

30 breaths of time!

Yang Ye chuckled, “Allow me to be honest. You think too highly of yourself!”

Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot, and he was above the old man.

After that, a pure white dragon claw appeared around Yang Ye’s right hand.

A ferocious glow flashed within his eyes, and then he raised his right hand and slammed it down. As soon as he did that, a wave of mysterious energy appeared here.

The Sword Domain!

The old man instantly felt himself being suppressed by the Sword Domain. Coupled with Yang Ye’s descending attack, the dual sources of pressure caused the old man’s body to warp.

The old man stared at the attack above him. He knew that he’d severely underestimated the human who stood before him.

The old man’s desire to live made him fight back before death. A powerful aura surged out from him, and Yang Ye’s attack had descended!

Bang!

The space in a huge area was instantly obliterated, and a black hole appeared!

Obliterated!

As for the old man, he’d been obliterated as well!

Yang Ye glanced at his palm while he stood within the pitch black expanse of space, and then he vanished on the spot.

Around ten breaths of time later, a black robed man suddenly appeared where the old man had been standing.

The space here had returned to normal.

The black robed man glanced at the surroundings and spoke softly, “No matter how strong someone is at the 6th stage of the True Realm, how strong can he be?”

The black robed man vanished on the spot.

The Endless Ocean!

After he killed the old man, Yang Ye immediately raised his speed to its limits.

Yin Hou’s capture was definitely related to Gu Nie who guarded the Endless Ocean!

However, it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to stop. Because a woman in a white dress appeared in front of him.

Yang Ye’s face fell. He was about to say something when she suddenly said, “She asked me to give you a message. Leave immediately.”

“Leave?” Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “Which parties in the sky race participated in the attack on Yin Hou?”

The woman replied indifferently, “I don’t know.”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “Isn’t the sky race worried about creating trouble between your sky race and the shaman race?”

She walked over to Yang Ye, “Do you still not understand? You’re everyone’s target! Yin Hou was only targeted because she wanted to protect you. If she didn’t try to protect you and chose to flee instead, then even three experts on her level wouldn’t be able to capture her!”

Yang Ye flipped his palm, and the Sovereign of Man’s sword appeared in his grasp. He smiled, “Is this sword really that good? Everyone is coming for it?”

The woman suddenly asked, “Do you know its true use?”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “What is it?”

She explained, “It was created by the joint forces of countless almighty figures, and it has many effects. One of it is the ability to destroy barriers, it can destroy all barriers. There’s a barrier between the sky race and human race, but that sword can destroy the barrier! Simply speaking, its owner possesses the initiative to attack any other race.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “It has one more ability, but I don’t know if it’s true.”

Yang Ye asked again, “What is it?”

She replied solemnly, “According to rumor, it can converge the strength of all the dimensions and slaughter the gods.”

Slaughter the gods? Yang Ye looked down at the sword in his grasp and spoke solemnly, “While it’s extraordinary, it doesn’t seem to be as powerful as you say. Of course, it can break through barriers!”

She suddenly asked, “Does it have a sword spirit?”

“Yes!” Yang Ye replied, “But…”

Yang Ye’s voice stopped abruptly. Because he noticed that it had never spoken to him. However, there was an even bigger problem, and it was that the sword seemed to have a consciousness.

“It’s just the sword's instinct!” Meanwhile, the woman continued, “Its sword spirit was heavily injured in the battle that occurred all those years ago, and it has fallen into an endless slumber. You’ve merely come into contact with a trace of its instinct. That’s why it fell into the hands of the Sovereign of Man and you. Otherwise, allow me to be honest. While the Sovereign of Man is strong enough to wield it, it would probably not spare you a single glance!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when the woman added, “You’ll die if you don’t leave the Sky Dimension!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She replied, “My father is aware of your presence. If it wasn’t for Xiao Qi, you would be dead by now!”

Yang Ye asked, “Your father wants to kill me?”

She replied, “He does!”

Yang Ye chuckled and gazed at her, “Tell him that I’m vengeful, very vengeful.”

He left once he finished speaking.
