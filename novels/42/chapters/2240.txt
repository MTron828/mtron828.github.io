Chapter 2241 – Arriving at the God Realm!

At the door of light within the endless black holes, a ray of sword energy flashed.

It dispersed to reveal Yang Ye’s figure.

There was a wisp of scarlet red on the corner of his mouth.

Yang Ye wiped it off and glanced at the door of light. Nobody pursued him out of it.

“Kid!” Meanwhile, the Demonspawn’s voice appeared in Yang Ye’s mind, “The undying race isn’t ordinary. I sensed two extremely powerful auras just now, and they were both beyond you.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why didn’t they attack?”

The Demonspawn replied, “How would I know?! However, it’s best if you don’t go there again. Your ability to conceal your aura is amazing indeed, but it isn’t almighty.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly. While he hadn’t been able to find out about his father, he had gained something from this trip, and it was a better understanding of the undying race.

The strongest expert of the undying race was probably its patriarch, and then it was that person, Lord Xiao Lou. The three wise men were below Lord Xiao Lou.

Yang Ye didn’t know how strong Lord Xiao Lou and the patriarch was, but just those three wise men were extremely terrifying!

He’d even used the Samadhi Flame earlier, yet he still hadn’t been able to kill Master Yuan!

Now, he had a rough understanding of the undying race.

Its strength wasn’t something this large universe could resist at all!

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he glanced at the door of light and left.

…

Void Spirit Continent.

In Void Spirit Hall, Yang Ye sat at the seat of the host, and Yang Lianshuang and Elder Yuan were below him.

The atmosphere in the hall was quite heavy.

A short while passed before Elder Yuan spoke solemnly, “It seems like the undying race’s strength is far greater than we imagined.”

Yang Ye nodded, “The larger universe is impossible to defend.”

Impossible!

Based on the current situation, the large universe couldn’t resist the undying race at all. Even if the entire large universe joined forward, it was still impossible. Not to mention now, even if the forces of the large universe were at their prime, they probably still wouldn’t be a match for the undying race.

Elder Yuan asked, “Do we have a way out?”

A way out?

Yang Ye spoke softly, “The only way out is to leave the large universe, but the only way to accomplish that is to activate that formation here. However, the undying race clearly plans on using it to leave too.”

Elder Yuan spoke bitterly, “So there’s no way out?”

Yang Ye stood up and said, “We do have no way out.”

The hall fell silent.

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang said, “There’s one more thing that we have to deal with. Countless people are rushing here, people from all the races. Because they are from different races and gathered here together, many disturbances arise in the city from time to time.”

“Disturbances?” Yang Ye frowned slightly, “They still have the mood to fight against each other at a time like this?”

Yang Lianshuang shook her head, “It can’t be helped. Where there are people, there are disputes. Now, people of many races are gathered in the city.”

Yang Ye replied, “Kill, kill a few more and they’ll be quiet.”

Yang Lianshuang spoke solemnly, “No, they’re already in chaos, and it’ll get worse if we resolve this by killing.” She paused for a moment and continued, “They’re really in chaos. All of them are terrified and intense. The slightest mistake may cause them to do something drastic.”

Elder Yuan nodded, “Lianshuang is right. They are filled with terror now, so we can’t kill. Otherwise, it’ll become even more chaotic.”

Yang Ye replied, “Then what do you think we should do?”

Yang Lianshuang and Elder Yuan exchanged glances. In the end, Yang Lianshuang spoke softly, “You do it. No matter what, you just have to stabilize them. So long as they don’t fall into chaos, we can rest at ease as we fight the undying race. Otherwise, the next time the undying race comes, they will probably instantly turn on us or cause trouble.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while, and then he said, “Come with me!”

He walked out of the hall once he finished speaking. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye went to the city walls, and Yang Lianshuang summoned countless before him. It was a dense crowd that stood before him.

All of them were looking at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “You’re afraid of the undying race. To be honest, I’m afraid too. Because they are very strong, extremely strong. They are so strong that even I think we have no chance!”

All of them exchanged glances and didn’t know what Yang Ye meant.

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang frowned because she felt that this would throw the people into even greater chaos.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, ‘I am very afraid, but what can I do about it? The undying race would let us go just because I’m afraid. Allow me to be honest, everyone here, including me, may die here in the end.”

Meanwhile, someone below suddenly asked, “Then what do we do?”

“What do we do?” Yang Ye said, “What do you think?”

Clamorous noise resounded incessantly down below.

“I know!” Yang Ye suddenly said, “Many of you want to run, but just go outside and have a look. How many people are still alive out there? The undying race has slaughtered all the living beings throughout the large universe. Allow me to be honest, if I flee, I may have a slight chance. After all, the undying race wouldn’t pay such a huge price to hunt me down. But what about all of you? Do you think they would let all of you escape?”

All of them remained silent.

Yang Ye’s voice gradually grew louder, “I’m here today to tell all of you that I, and everyone one of you, have no way out. Yet all of you are still scheming against each other in the city. What’s the point? It won’t be long before we’ll all die here, so what’s the point of doing all of that?”

Meanwhile, someone suddenly asked, “Is there really no hope at all?”

Yang Ye shrugged, “I’ve been to the undying race’s territory. They have even stronger experts there, and if those experts come, all of us will mostly die.”

Meanwhile, someone suddenly asked, “Will you flee?”

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye.

Would Yang Ye flee?

Yang Ye shook his head, “I won’t. Because there are people I care about here, and I’ve promised someone that I would protect this place.”

That person said, “You will die!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’ll drag them down with me, as many as I can. Since I’m going to die anyway, why wouldn’t I drag a few more with me?”

He glanced at them and continued, “Of course, I know that many of you are still dreaming of fleeing once the undying race arrives. However, I want to tell you that the undying race doesn’t just plan to kill everyone here, they plan to destroy the entire large universe. At that time, the spirit energy here will dry up, so even if you flee and escape the undying race, you won’t be able to escape death. It’s just a matter of when you die. So, instead of dying like that, it’s better to die valiantly in battle. What do you think?”

“Yes!” Meanwhile, a man suddenly shouted, “Yang Ye’s right. Since only death awaits, it’s better to die valiantly. I’m not going to run, I’ll just wait for them to come and detonate myself. Every one I kill counts. I want the undying race to know that we aren’t cowards!”

“Yes! Let’s fight them to the death!”

“I’m going to take them with me too!”

Countless people howled from down below.

At this moment, all of them showed no fear on their faces, there was only resolve.

A person’s fear had limits, and once it passed that limit, it would be fear no more. When a person knew they would die, there was nothing that could scare them!

Yang Ye had said all of that so they understood this. Once they understood it, they stopped being afraid.

Countless people in the city were filled with determination. They seemed like they were going to fight the undying race to the limit.

Fear had been transformed into strength!

Yang Ye didn’t say anything. He just turned around and left.

After Yang Ye’s speech, the fights in the city lessened drastically, and they seemed to grow more united now. Regardless of what enmity they had between them, they understood that they would die together.

Since they were going to die, the enmity of the past was pointless. Moreover, immortal stones weren’t that precious to them anymore.

Within the Primordial Pagoda in Void Spirit Hall, Yang Ye was seated before the Bodhi Tree, and An Nanjing was by his side.

Just like that, time trickled by.

A month passed in a blink of an eye.

At this moment, besides Void Spirit Continent, the people in all other places had been practically annihilated.

The entire large universe was covered in death.

Now, there were only two places in the large universe that hadn’t been slaughtered by the undying race, Void Spirit Continent and the God Realm.

The God Realm.

Shi Tian sat within God Hall. Suddenly, he opened his eyes, “They’re here?”

Outside the God Realm.

500 undying cavalry suddenly appeared, and they were led by Master Yuan. Dugu Juetian was by his side.

All of them were seated on Nefarious and had spears on their backs. Their auras were merged together, causing a powerful wave of pressure to slam down upon the God Realm.

Master Yuan glanced at the God Realm and spoke indifferently, “This is the god race that once ruled over the large universe? It’s not just a little bit inferior when compared to the void spirit race!”

He paused for a moment and continued, “They have some ability, so don’t be careless and underestimate them.”

“Understood!” Dugu Juetian nodded slightly and raised her right hand.

“Kill!” The undying cavalry suddenly hurled their spears forward, and 500 spears tore through space as they shot into the God Realm.

Boom!

The formation that enveloped the God Realm instantly exploded apart.

The God Realm was fully revealed before the undying race’s army.

In the God Hall, Shi Tian stood up slowly, “Let me see how strong the undying race really is! Summon the Divine Generals!”
