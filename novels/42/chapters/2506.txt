Chapter 2507 – Danger!

Come down here!

Yang Ye was dazed when he heard this, and he almost jumped down. However, it didn’t take long for him to shake his head, and that absurd thought in his mind vanished without a trace.

There was a trace of vigilance in his eyes when he looked down the abyss again.

Ye Zhibei and Xing Biqing glanced at Yang Ye, and they were quite shocked. They hadn’t expected him to recover so quickly.

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “What was that?”

Xing Biqing replied, “A Bewitcher. We call it a Bewitcher because it’s a devil that can bewitch a person. It’s from the ancient era.”

Bewitcher!

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “The area down below isn’t ordinary!”

Xing Biqing nodded, “We don’t have to go too far below. There are too many unknown things down below, and even we aren’t confident in being able to overcome it all.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’ll lead the way!”

Yang Ye was about to head down there, but the voice suddenly came from below again.

Yang Ye frowned, and then he shouted at the abyss, “You come up here!”

Ye Zhibei and Xing Biqing gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye smiled embarrassedly, “It kept telling us to go down there, and it was annoying!”

Xing Biqing nodded slightly, “Let’s go!”

They jumped down the abyss and descended slowly.

The lower they went, the lower their visibility was.

After descending around 300m, Yang Ye noticed that there were some scraps floating in the air. There were even some World Crystals. However, there weren’t many of them, just a few!

Xing Biqing waved her right hand and put them away, “We’ll divide them up later, alright?”

Yang Ye and Ye Zhibei naturally had no objections.

They continued downward, but they slowed down quite a bit, and grew much more vigilant.

Around 10 minutes later, shadows started to flash below them.

Yang Ye asked, “What are those?”

Xing Biqing replied, “Vengeful spirits, the spirits of the people who died here. Their souls are unable to escape this place or destroy themselves. So, as time passes, they become vengeful spirits. Be careful, their resentment is very strong.”

As soon as Xing Biqing finished speaking, a few vengeful spirits charged at them.

Yang Ye was about to take action when Xing Biqing tapped a finger forward. A few golden talismans shot out, and they transformed into a few rays of golden light that shot at the vengeful spirits.

Rumble!

Along with a few explosions, the vengeful spirits were repulsed. However, a pitch black face suddenly appeared near them.

The pitch black face started at them but didn’t attack.

Xing Biqing spoke indifferently, “Move aside!”

The black face suddenly opened its mouth. In an instant, a wave of powerful black energy swept out of its mouth and enveloped them!

Yang Ye frowned slightly, and he flicked a strand of sword energy forward.

Hiss!

It instantly sliced open the black energy, and then a shrill cry resounded from afar. After that, the black energy vanished without a trace.

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “They should be aware that they are no match for us, so why do they still attack us?”

“They seek death!” Xing Biqing spoke indifferently, “Death is the only release for the souls that are trapped here.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why can’t they leave?”

Xing Biqing shook her head, “I’m not very sure, but according to my inference, it should be because there is some sort of barrier or formation here that targets souls!”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. There were some vengeful spirits here, but they hadn’t attacked his group. While some sought death, some wanted to live.

They continued down. As they went deeper, the World Crystals floating in the air grew in number. Up until now, they had picked up around 20 World Crystals. Besides that, they saw some damaged weapons. The best of them had actually been Divine Treasures, but there were very few of them. Moreover, the weakest among the rest were Pseudo Divine Treasures. However, they were all damaged and weren’t very useful!”

Suddenly, Xing Biqing pointed at a mountain wall in the distance, “Look!” There was a cave there.

Yang Ye asked, “Shall we have a look?”

Xing Biqing hesitated for a moment and nodded. They went over to the mountain wall and entered the cave. The cave was pitch black inside. Xing Biqing flicked a few Lunarlight Stones into the air, and instantly lit up the area.

They walked further into the cave, and it didn’t take long for them to stop at the deepest part of the cave. There was a middle aged man with hair that hung down to his shoulders, and he was seated there cross-legged.

The middle aged man was seated on a meditation cushion, but there were no signs of life in him.

There was a spatial ring in front of him, a thick ancient scroll, and a golden needle that was thin as a strand of hair.

The needle was very fine and almost invisible to the eye!

Xing Biqing spoke abruptly, “He’s dead!”

Yang Ye nodded. Yang Ye’s divine sense had swept the middle aged man, and it hadn’t detected any signs of life.

“The Lord Realm!” Xing Biqing spoke solemnly, “Or perhaps above the Lord Realm. I wonder who he is and why he died here.”

Ye Zhibei sized up the middle aged man and said, “His lifespan was exhausted!”

The middle aged man hadn’t been killed, he’d reached the end of his lifespan and perished.

Dead!

They fell silent as they gazed at the middle aged man.

Death!

It would come for everyone, one day! The longer a person lived, the greater that person’s fear of death may be. Every person had the will to live. However, when one’s lifespan was exhausted, one had to die even if one didn’t want to. How helpless and terrified would a person feel at that moment?

How many people could truly remain unbothered by death?

A short while passed before Yang Ye spoke softly, “This senior left three things here. Obviously, he was leaving it for those who came after him. It proves that while he was unwilling and reluctant, he was able to accept it.”

Xing Biqing nodded slightly, “Since he was able to attain such strength, he was absolutely not ordinary. Unfortunately, he lost to the Grand Dao and time itself!”

They bowed slightly to the middle aged man’s remains, and then Xing Biqing asked, “How do we divide these things?”

How?

Yang Ye glanced at the spatial ring, and he detected around 150 World Crystals within it. He thought for a moment and said, “I only want World Crystals. You two can split the rest, alright?”

World Crystals!

Actually, all he lacked was World Crystals. As for treasures, he had all sorts of divine treasures and had no need for more.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

He lacked World Crystals the most!

Ye Zhibei and Xing Biqing exchanged glances. In the end, Xing Biqing glanced at the needle and scroll, “If they are sold in an auction, they will be sold for at least 600 World Crystals. If the 150 World Crystals in that spatial ring are included, it’s a total of 750 World Crystals. So, you should get around 250.”

She flicked around 50 World Crystals to Yang Ye, and Ye Zhibei did the same.

Yang Ye didn’t refuse it and took them!

Once they watched Yang Ye take the crystals, they took what they wanted.

All of them were very satisfied with the distribution of spoils.

They bowed slightly to the middle aged man again, and then they left the cave and set up a barrier at the entrance of the cave.

An expert had perished here.

So, he deserved to rest in peace.

They continued downward.

Meanwhile, Xing Biqing suddenly said, “My goal is a Divine Treasure down below. It’s an armor that surpasses ordinary Divine Treasures. You can consider it half a Super Divine Treasure.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly and gazed at Ye Zhibei, “What about you?”

She replied, “The same!”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he smiled, “Both of you won’t start fighting later, right?”

Xing Biqing smiled, “No, we will settle it peacefully.”

She gazed at Yang Ye, “What about you? Are you tempted?”

Yang Ye replied, “A little. But since both of you want it, I’ll let you have it!”

Xing Biqing smiled, “Are you telling the truth, or lying to us?”

Yang Ye replied, “Then how about you let me have it?”

She shook her head and smiled, “I can’t do that!”

Yang Ye smiled, “You gave me an inner core the other day, and brought me here now. I’ve gained a lot. A person can never be too greedy.”

She glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent, but she felt a little more acknowledgement toward Yang Ye.

No one liked an insatiable person!

Moreover, after being in contact with Yang Ye, she realized that this illegitimate child of the Ye Clan was very easy to talk to at most times. He was someone worth making friends with.

Meanwhile, Ye Zhibei glanced at Yang Ye and didn’t say anything.

Just like that, they continued down, and it didn’t take long for Xing Biqing, who was leading the group down, to stop.

Yang Ye looked down, and he saw an armor, a fiery red armor, floating at the end of his vision.

It was just floating there, and there was nothing around it.

Yang Ye noticed that Xing Biqing and Ye Zhibei had rather solemn expressions on their faces right now.

Yang Ye looked down again, and it didn’t take long for his expression to gradually become solemn as well. He could faintly see a shadow soundlessly drifting there, and the first feeling he had upon laying eyes on it was danger!

Danger!

At this moment, he finally understood why Xing Biqing wasn’t confident in coming here by herself!

This place was really very dangerous!

Meanwhile, Xing Biqing suddenly said, “I’ve been here once. However, I almost lost my life. I don’t know what it is, but it’s very strong, and it’s very mysterious too. Even though I’m much stronger than I was that day, I’m still not confident in my ability.”

Yang Ye looked at the armor down below. At this moment, he suddenly thought of Snowy. If she was here, she would just have to wave her paw, and that armor would obediently come over to him!

Unfortunately, the little fellow wasn’t here!
