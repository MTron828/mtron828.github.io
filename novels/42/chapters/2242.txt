Chapter 2243 – Mysterious Expert!

Help the undying race?

The surroundings fell silent.

Both the god race and the undying race hadn’t expected Shi Tian to propose such a deal.

Meanwhile, Shi Tian added, “My god race has just around 100,000 people, and such an amount is nothing before the billions throughout the large universe. If you insist on annihilating us, then we have 27 Sages, and they are the divine generals of my god race. Besides that, we have the spirit of our ancestor and me, Shi Tian. I guarantee that you’ll lose at least half of the undying cavalry you’ve brought here today.”

A smile curled up on his face at this point, and he continued, “Even without those divine generals and the spirit of our ancestor, just I alone can kill half your army.”

Master Yuan fell silent.

Shi Tian added, “At that time, even if you annihilate my god race, Void Spirit Continent would still exist. I’m sure you’ve witnessed Yang Ye’s strength and talent. If he joins forces with An Nanjing, and the Universe Sprite helps him too, I’m certain that even your life would be at risk, let alone this army of yours. I’m sure you’re aware that I’m not exaggerating!”

Master Yuan looked Shi Tian in the eyes, “Yang Ye can’t stop my undying race!”

Shi Tian smiled, “I know. But he’s absolutely capable of making the undying race pay a certain price, right?”

Yang Ye!

The scene of Yang Ye taking his arm flashed within Master Yuan’s mind.

That young man who was only a Sage!

Meanwhile, Shi Tian pointed at the members of the god race, “See that? My god race only has around 100,000… No, even less than that remaining. As far as we are concerned, all that matters is that our god race doesn’t go extinct. As for your undying race, just around 100,000 people from my god race are no threat to your undying race, and killing all of us won’t make a huge difference either. So long as you’re willing to spare us, I’m willing to help you. With our help, it wouldn’t be difficult to eliminate Void Spirit Continent, wouldn’t it?”

Master Yuan and Dugu Juetian exchanged glances, and then they fell silent for a long time. In the end, Master Yuan glanced at the God Realm.

Just as Shi Tian had said, there weren’t even 100,000 in the God Realm.

100,000!

The undying race killed more than that every day.

Meanwhile, Shi Tian suddenly said, “You don’t have the authority to make that decision?”

Master Yuan glanced at Shi Tian and said, “I’m considering it!”

Shi Tian smiled, “If I’m not wrong, the undying race’s true objective isn’t my god race or Void Spirit Continent. Because based on the current circumstances, you’ve already conquered the entire large universe. Your true objective is to leave this large universe, and you want to eliminate all life here before you do that. Right?”

Master Yuan pondered deeply for a long time and said, “I agree to your proposal.”

Shi Tian’s eyes narrowed slightly, “I want to know if you’re authorized to make this decision!”

Master Yuan glanced at Shi Tian, “Don’t worry, I have the authority to decide whether to kill or spare a mere 100,000. Of course, the precondition is that you don’t act against my undying race. But I think you don’t have the courage to do that!”

Shi Tian asked, “What if Yang Ye makes a compromise too?”

“Him?” Master Yuan laughed coldly, “We gave him many chances, but he refused them all. He’s openly resisting my undying race, so he must die to protect my undying race’s prestige!”

Shi Tian spoke solemnly, “When will you be attacking? Or perhaps now?”

Master Yuan shook his head slightly, “Not now!”

Shi Tian was puzzled, “Why?”

Master Yuan glanced at him, “Allow me to be honest, my undying race came for your god race first because Void Spirit Continent isn’t that easy to annihilate. Even if our current forces can annihilate them, I’m afraid only a few of us will survive.”

Shi Tian asked, “What if you include my god race?”

“It still isn’t enough!” Master Yuan continued, “According to our knowledge, Yang Ye has the backing of a mysterious expert. That person is extremely strong, so our higher-ups have given the order to leave Yang Ye alone for now.”

The mysterious expert!

Shi Tian’s eyes narrowed slightly. The god race knew a little about that too, but they didn’t know who it was either!

“But it won’t be long now!” Meanwhile, Master Yuan added, “Just stay here. We’ll notify you when we’re attacking Void Spirit Continent.”

Shi Tian said, “I have a suggestion.”

Master Yuan gazed at him, “What?”

Shi Tian spoke indifferently, “Void Spirit Continent is led by Yang Ye. If we can kill him in an instant, then their forces will collapse. If we can’t kill him, he’ll give your race a huge amount of trouble.”

Master Yuan nodded slightly, “I’ll notify you when the time comes. I hope you’ll put on an act with us!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished into the sky with the undying race’s army.

The sky above the God Realm gradually returned to normal.

Countless people heaved sighs of relief in the city down below!

Meanwhile, there was a trace of sorrow in Ding Shaoyao’s eyes. The once mighty god race had no choice but to beg for survival before the undying race, and the god race didn’t feel insulted by that.

How arrogant was the god race all those years ago? They had almost been annihilated by all the other races and the four paths, yet they didn’t choose to surrender. They had fought to the death. Yet now…

Now, the god race didn’t just lack the strength it once possessed, it lacked the pride and dignity it once had!

She restrained her thoughts and walked over to Shi Tian, “The undying race will turn on us at a moment’s notice!”

Shi Tian glanced at Ding Shaoyao and replied, “Our forces are insignificant to them. Moreover, their objective isn’t our god race or Yang Ye. They are looking far, far away. So, we have a very good chance to survive this danger.”

Ding Shaoyao suddenly asked, “What if they go back on their word?”

Shi Tian’s eyes narrowed slightly, “I’m betting they don’t.”

Ding Shaoyao sighed in her heart.

Because Shi Tian was placing the god race’s fate in the undying race’s hands!

Meanwhile, Shi Tian added, “I know what you’re thinking. But we have no other choice. The undying race is too strong. Even if we join forces with Yang Ye, it’s impossible for us to resist them. Resisting them will only lead to our annihilation. No matter what, I can’t allow the god race to be annihilated in my hands.”

Ding Shaoyao fell silent.

Meanwhile, Shi Tian suddenly said, “I have something for Zhi’er and you!”

Ding Shaoyao gazed at him, and he spoke softly, “Besides my own kin, I don’t believe anyone else. I will never entrust the hopes of our entire race on someone else.”

He slowly closed his eyes once he finished speaking.

…

At a certain point in space above the God Realm, a black shadow left without making a sound.

A long time passed before the black shadow arrived in the sky above Void Spirit Continent, and it dispersed to reveal Yang Ye’s figure. Yang Ye had immediately rushed over when he heard the undying race was attacking the god race.

It wasn’t that he really wanted to help them, he just wanted to see if he could find a chance to kill Master Yuan during the battle. However, he hadn’t expected this to be the outcome. The god race and undying race had suddenly stopped fighting, and they actually formed an agreement to kill him first!

It was such a farce!

Yang Ye had never imagined that it would turn out like this, and he hadn’t imagined that Shi Tian would do that.

No matter what, he was in huge trouble now!

Yang Ye returned to Void Spirit Hall.

Yang Ye summoned Elder Yuan and Yang Lianshuang there.

Elder Yuan gazed at him, “Are you serious?”

He nodded, “I watched it happen myself. It’s absolutely true!”

Elder Yuan asked, “Then what do you plan to do?”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “We can’t even deal with the undying race, and now we have to face the god race too. To be honest, I don’t have a very good idea. However, I have a bad one, and it’s to annihilate the god race first!”

Annihilate the god race first!

Yang Lianshuang shook her head, “That’s exactly what the undying race wants. It’ll be the perfect opportunity for them to reap the rewards.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Meanwhile, Elder Yuan suddenly asked, “Can you contact that expert who’s protecting you?”

That expert who is protecting Yang Ye!

When Void Spirit Continent was in danger, the mysterious expert from beyond the door of light had been stopped, and that person was clearly helping Yang Ye. Moreover, that person was extremely strong.

Elder Yuan still had hope in his heart because of that person!

“That mysterious expert?” Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “To be honest, I don’t even know who it is!”

He was telling the truth. While he knew someone was helping him, he didn’t know who it was. He didn’t know at all, nor could he think of anyone. Amongst the people he knew, the Unfettered One possessed such strength, but the unfettered one had no reason to help him. Moreover, the Unfettered One wasn’t someone who liked to hide. He always made his presence known!

Elder Yuan frowned, “Then who could it be?”

Suddenly, their expressions changed drastically, and then a strand of slaughter intent swept out from Yang Ye. However, it was suddenly suppressed back into him.

At the same time, a wave of powerful energy pressed down upon them and rendered them immobile.

Even Yang Ye couldn’t move at all!

A vicious glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, and he was about to summon the Samadhi Flame, but a hand suddenly pressed down on his head, “I guarantee that I can crush your head before that flame can come outside.”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and the voice continued, “I’ll give you one final chance. Submit to my undying race and I’ll spare you. I’ll even give you command of our army. If you refuse, I’ll obliterate you in an instant. No one can save you now, not even that mysterious sword cultivator.”
