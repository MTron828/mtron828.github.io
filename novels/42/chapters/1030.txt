Chapter 1031 – Lady!

Asura Queen’s master?They are asking for her forgiveness?

They aren’t enemies but master and disciple?

Yang Ye was quite stunned at this moment.

Bang!

Suddenly, the spirit energy in the surroundings suddenly surged madly in Yang Ye’s direction, and then they entered the woman.

Yang Ye was shocked because he noticed that the spirit energy in an extraordinarily huge area was surging towards him and entered the woman. Moreover, he noticed that the spirit energy actually had threads of violet energy mixed within it. Yang Ye knew that it was probably the Quintessence Violet Energy of this world!

The woman slowly started to float up from Yang Ye’s back.

As spirit energy surged endlessly into her, Yang Ye noticed that the injuries on her bare feet and hands were actually healing.

Yang Ye glanced at her, and then he moved backwards slowly and was about to leave. However, Asura Queen suddenly obstructed his path.

“A human?” Asura Queen’s voice resounded from beneath her mask. While her voice was calm, Yang Ye was able to sense coldness within it.

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Don’t worry. I’ll be leaving right away!”” Presently, he only wanted to return to the academy as soon as possible and not waste any time here.

Asura Queen continued, “The Tree of Creation vanished because of you?”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he knew that it was impossible to leave peacefully anymore. Yang Ye had always upheld the principle of seizing the initiative to gain the upper hand, so he swung his sword swiftly, and a strand of sword energy shot forward from the tip of his sword. However, it was blasted apart by an invisible force before it could even arrive before Asura Queen.

However, Yang Ye was a few thousand kilometers away!

His speed far surpassed Saints when boosted by the Laws of Speed and the Dark Sword Wings.

Asura Queen’s eyes narrowed slightly, and she was about to pursue him. However, she suddenly stopped while a trace of bewilderment appeared in her eyes. Because Yang Ye who’d just fled had returned abruptly!

“I... I think that we should talk about it!” Yang Ye spoke in a very serious manner, “Fighting and fleeing won’t be able to solve the problem, right?”

Asura Queen’s eyes still carried a trace of bewilderment. However, it faded quite a bit when she looked not too far behind Yang Ye. Because a black clothed figure had suddenly appeared behind Yang Ye.

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched when he sensed the arrival of the black clothed figure. He’d thought that his speed was swift, but he noticed that it was far inferior to Light Maiden! It wasn’t just his speed, there was even a huge gap in their strengths.

Her attacks were so swift that even he couldn’t see them!

So, he had no choice but to get back here. In any case, Asura Queen hated humans, so she might dislike the sight of Light Maiden and kill Light Maiden first. Yang Ye was quite curious about whether Light Maiden or the number one expert of the prefecture, Asura Queen, was stronger!

“Another human!” Asura Queen’s voice carried undisguised coldness and killing intent!

Light Maiden paid no attention to Asura Queen and gazed at Yang Ye instead. At this moment, Yang Ye’s pupils constricted, and then an explosion resounded from him. After that, he was pushed over 300m back.

He looked down when he stopped himself, and there was a mark on the sword armor!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly while an extremely solemn expression appeared within them. Light Maiden’s attack speed was too terrifying, and he might have been instantly killed if it wasn’t for the sword armor!

“It’s impolite to not reciprocate!” Yang Ye roared furiously as he transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot. He was in front of Light Maiden when he appeared again. At the same time, Yellow Swings stabbed straight at her head! However, a barrier of light suddenly appeared in front of him when his sword was about to come close to her, and it stopped his sword!

Clang!

Yellow Springs shook violently. But it only took an instant for Yang Ye to pull it back slightly and stab forcefully again.

Bang!

This time, the barrier of light wasn’t able to stop Yang Ye’s sword and was blasted apart.

“Your control of strength isn’t bad!” Light Maiden spoke abruptly before gesturing. The shattered barrier of light suddenly transformed into numerous blades of light that shot towards Yang Ye. They were truly too swift to the point Yang Ye couldn’t dodge them at all! Fortunately, he’d been in a highly vigilant state since the battle began, so Void Rank sword intent had surged out from him when she attacked. At the same time, the sword armor he wore transformed into countless rays of light that shot towards those blades of light!

The blades of light were instantly drowned beneath the swords from Yang Ye’s armor!

Bang! Bang!

Numerous explosions resounded incessantly, and it didn’t take long for the blades of light to vanish while Yang Ye’s sword needles continued forward towards Light Maiden!

“Void Rank sword intent!” There was a trace of surprise in Light Maiden’s eyes. She waved her hand lightly, and then countless beams of light suddenly shot forward. They were extremely powerful and instantly dispersed the sword intent on those sword needles before blasting them back towards Yang Ye!

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted. He waved his right hand, and those sword needles immediately returned to him and transformed into the sword armor that was around him just a moment ago. At the same time, numerous blades of light suddenly appeared around him, and they left him no room to escape. After that, they instantly enveloped him!

However, the shadow behind the black robed woman suddenly wriggled, and then Yang Ye appeared behind her before his fist shot towards the back of her head!

Light Maiden’s figure stiffened for an instant. Obviously, she hadn’t expected Yang Ye to suddenly utilize the Laws of Darkness. However, she didn’t panic, and a ray of light suddenly surged out from within her and shot towards Yang Ye’s fist when Yang Ye’s fist was about to strike her head.

Bang!

The ray of light was instantly blasted apart, but it only took an instant for countless blades of light to suddenly smash against Yang Ye and blast him flying.

Yang Ye glanced at himself. At this moment, his sword armor was covered in marks, and he finally understood why the woman had said that even 10 Saints couldn’t be a match for Light Maiden while there was light. It was because anywhere with light was filled with energy that she could use!

If he didn’t possess Void Rank sword intent and the sword armor, then he wouldn’t be a match for her at all!

Suddenly, Asura Queen spoke, “You’re Light Maiden from the Nether Pavilion!”

However, Light Maiden disregarded Asura Queen and gazed at Yang Ye, “Covered in Divine Rank treasures.... One who relies on external sources of strength is nothing worth mentioning!” She was about to attack again when she spoke up to this point.

Suddenly, Asura Queen raised her hand and slapped it in Light Maiden’s direction!

A huge palm tore through space and clawed at Light Maiden. The tiny isle below Light Maiden instantly collapsed, and the powerful force of Asura Queen’s attack caused the space in a huge area around Light Maiden to warp severely.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched when he witnessed this scene. As expected of the number one expert of Pine Prefecture! But is she not afraid of causing the Heaven Dao to target her? After all, Light Maiden is a Saint too!

Bang!

Meanwhile, numerous beams of light rained down from the sky, and they struck against the huge palm. Both attacks trembled violently, and then suddenly exploded apart. Countless waves of energy swept towards the surroundings, and the powerful aftershock from their collision caused huge waves to surge up on the ocean below!

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. He paid no further attention to them and turned around with the intention of leaving. However, the woman whom Asura Queen called master suddenly appeared in front of him.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

She glanced at him, and then she gazed at Light Maiden, “Leave!”

Asura Queen immediately abandoned her intention to continue attacking when she heard the woman, and then she walked to the woman’s side like an obedient disciple. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye was simply stunned by this scene.

Light Maiden said, “He must die!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened. Isn’t she a little too overbearing? I merely comprehended the Laws of Darkness, yet she insists on killing me!? Yang Ye could only imagine what would happen if Light Maiden knew that he’d killed Shadow Maiden!

The woman’s voice remained calm, “I said leave!”

Light Maiden was rather stubborn, “What if I refuse?” After all, she was a member of the Nether Pavilion, so why should she care about the opinion of others?

The woman nodded lightly, and then she raised her right hand and grasped it in Light Maiden’s direction. A shocking scene appeared. The light in an area of over 10,000km suddenly vanished at a noticeable speed, and it took less than 3 breaths of time for no light to exist in that area. While light still remained in the distant sky, it was like that light was obstructed by something and couldn’t descend here!

A Domain! Yang Ye was astounded because it was the might of a Domain! It was the first time he’d seen a true Domain besides his own!

“A Domain....” There was astonishment in Light Maiden’s voice, and it was accompanied by a trace of terror, “You... you’re the one they call the Lady who roams the world!”

The woman waved her right hand, and a mouthful of blood sprayed from Light Maiden before her figure was blasted flying. In the blink of an eye, Light Maiden had transformed into a black dot that vanished into the sky.

The woman’s ghastly voice resounded through the world, “I’ll give Nether Pavilion face and won’t kill you. You’re prohibited from stepping foot into Pine Prefecture from now onwards, otherwise, I’ll obliterate you!”

Meanwhile, tempestuous waves were surging through Yang Ye’s heart. A Domain! I saw a Domain! So a Domain is that terrifying!

At this moment, Yang Ye realized that it wasn’t his Sword Domain that was weak, it was he who hadn’t truly grasped its ability!

Meanwhile, the woman suddenly turned around to look at Yang Ye and said, “We should resolve our business now!”

“What business?” Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. Does she intend to get even with me now that we’re safe?The woman spoke calmly, “I remember you said that we’ll fight in single combat once we escape. If you win, then we’ll let bygones be bygones, and if I win, then I can do anything I wish to you. Now, you can strike the first blow!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched, and a short while passed before he laughed bitterly, “I admit defeat!” What a joke! Even Light Maiden couldn’t resist a single attack from the woman. As for him? He couldn’t even defeat Light Maiden!

The woman nodded lightly, but she didn’t say anything and just fell silent.

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “I don’t understand something. Since you’re Asura Queen’s master, then why were you locked up there? Moreover, you were even sealed?”

She shook her head slightly, “I sealed myself!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She gazed at him, pondered deeply for an instant, and said, “I’m too powerful, and this world isn’t able to endure it!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

The woman said, “Since you’ve admitted defeat, then I’ll make my request. I can spare you, but I want that tiny pagoda of yours!”

Yang Ye’s expression instantly changed violently when he heard her. He gazed at her for a short while, and then he suddenly transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

Asura Queen took a step forward when she witnessed this scene, and she was about to go after Yang Ye. However, the woman stopped Asura Queen and said, “I’ll do it!”

As soon as she finished speaking, her figure vanished on the spot.
