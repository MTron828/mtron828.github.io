Chapter 2237 – Kill a Progenitor!

Yang Ye pressed his sword against the Buddhist Progenitor’s forehead while staring at the latter, “What do you mean?”

The Buddhist Progenitor said, “What we killed that day wasn’t his true body. No, I should say that he cultivated a clone, so unless all of them are killed, he isn’t truly dead. According to my knowledge, one of his clones still exists.”

Yang Ye asked, “Where is it?”

The Buddhist Progenitor looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Let me go!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time before he said, “Alright!”

The Buddhist Progenitor spoke solemnly, “It’s at the undying race.”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Sorry, I didn’t finish speaking just now.”

The Buddhist Progenitor was puzzled, “What do you mean?” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

A smile curled up on Yang Ye’s mouth, and it was quite ferocious, “Alright, in your dreams!”

Hiss!

As soon as he finished speaking, his sword stabbed in the Buddhist Progenitor’s forehead, and blood sprayed.

The Buddhist Progenitor’s eyes opened wide while the vitality within him surged out into the surroundings.

“You…” He stared at Yang Ye with eyes filled with resentment.

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath on the Buddhist Progenitor and just waved his sword.

Hiss!

The Buddhist Progenitor’s head flew into the air.

Blood sprayed out like a fountain!

Even the Buddhist Progenitor’s soul had been destroyed by this.

He was truly dead without even the chance of rebirth!

Yang Ye gazed at the remaining people here. At this moment, they were looking at him, and then they knelt before him.

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Flee!”

They didn’t hesitate to flee toward the surroundings.

Yang Ye gazed at the altar. He waved his sword, and a strand of blood red sword energy tore through the air. Right when it was about to strike the door of light, a spear suddenly tore through the air and slammed against his sword energy, causing it to explode apart.

Yang Ye looked over and saw a woman had appeared there.

Dugu Juetian!

She stared at him, “Yang Ye, are you really in that much of a hurry to die?”

As soon as she said that, over 100 undying cavalry appeared behind her, and all of them had a Nefarious below them.

“Die?” Yang Ye chuckled, “I don’t want to die.”

He glanced at her and the undying cavalry, and then he said, “I’m leaving now. Do you intend to attack me?”

He patted the Sword Supreme against his left palm while he spoke, “Allow me to be honest, just these forces are probably not enough even for me to kill.”

Her eyes narrowed slightly, “Is that so?”

As soon as she finished speaking, almost 300 undying cavalry appeared around Yang Ye, and they surrounded him.

She looked him in the eyes, “What about now?”

Meanwhile, a woman suddenly appeared on Yang Ye’s right.

An Nanjing!

It was An Nanjing!

She looked Dugu Juetian in the eyes, “You can get 200 more!”

Dugu Juetian gazed at An Nanjing. She just gazed at her, and the latter met her gaze.

An Nanjing and Yang Ye!

Kill them?

Even if these experts of the undying race could kill Yang Ye and An Nanjing in the end, they would pay a terrible price, an extremely terrible price. She didn’t want to pay that price. So, an even stronger expert of the undying race was required to kill them.

Soldiers fought soldiers, but making soldiers fight a general would lead to tremendous losses!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye smiled, “Since you’re not attacking, then we’re leaving.”

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the Buddhist Progenitor’s head was transported into the Primordial Pagoda before he left with An Nanjing.

The undying cavalries’ eyes were filled with the desire to kill, and some even wanted to attack, but Dugu Juetian stopped them.

She glanced at Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s figures, “Lord Xiao Lou is about to come here. He won’t be alive for long.”

…

Yang Ye and An Nanjing left the area, and it didn’t take long for them to meet Shi Tian and Ding Shaoyao.

Ding Shaoyao glanced at Yang Ye and An Nanjing, “You were impulsive. We’ve alarmed them now, yet we still haven’t figured out their secrets.”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “Sorry, I couldn’t help myself. I have other things to attend to. Farewell.”

Yang Ye and An Nanjing vanished on the spot.

Shi Tian frowned slightly, “What the heck was that?!”

Ding Shaoyao spoke softly, “That’s how he is. Sometimes, he’s easy to get along with, but sometimes, he’s very difficult to get along with.”

Shi Tian grunted coldly, and he felt extremely unhappy. Because Yang Ye just did as he pleased and didn’t give him or Ding Shaoyao any respect.

…

In the starry sky, An Nanjing spoke softly, “You’re against the god race?”

Yang Ye replied, “I’m not against them, it’s just that they didn’t really form an alliance with us to have an ally, they want to use us.”

An Nanjing was puzzled, “Then why did you agree to it?”

Yang Ye grinned, “We can use each other.”

Yang Ye paused for a moment and continued, “Actually, Dugu Juetian is right. A race that isn’t united will vanish from this universe. Numerous races lived together in this large universe, but they fought incessantly. So, they brought all of this upon themselves. It’s the same for our human race too. In the end, it’s our own self-interests that is our downfall. All of us want to get the best for ourselves, and we fail to be selfless. Even now, those who are still alive aren’t thinking about being united, they are fighting and killing each other.”

An Nanjing fell silent.

Yang Ye took a deep breath and continued, “Dugu Juetian said that if I were willing to step forward, the human race wouldn’t have fallen to the state it’s in right now. But she’s wrong. I can save the human race now, but I can’t save it forever. I can’t change how selfish the human race is, just like how they abandoned me in the face of danger after I tried to help them.”

He laughed with self-ridicule, “In the end, the human race merely used me, and it would be the same even if someone else was in my place. When faced with life and death, most only think about themselves. So long as they survive, the fate of others has nothing to do with them, right?”

An Nanjing spoke softly, “There’s no need to think so much about that!”

“Of course!” Yang Ye smiled, “As far as I’m concerned, my job is to protect my loved one. Their safety is all that matters to me!”

He glanced at the surroundings, “I plan to travel to the undying race.”

She asked, “For your father?”

Yang Ye nodded, “That clone of my father’s is still there, and I want to go have a look!”

She spoke solemnly, “It’s dangerous!”

Yang Ye replied, “Don’t worry, I’m not going to look for trouble with them. With the Bodhi Tree and Sword Domain to conceal my aura, it should be fine while I don’t expose myself. Besides that, even a few progenitors can’t stop me from fleeing now. I also have one more trump card with me.”

He was naturally talking about the Samadhi Flame!

He hadn’t used the Samadhi Flame during the battle earlier, and it could be considered as his biggest trump card right now.

An Nanjing fell silent for a long time and said, “I’ll go with you!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Let’s go!”

They vanished on the spot.

At the door of light deep within the endless black holes.

Yang Ye snuck over to the door of light, glanced at the surroundings, and then snuck in. He didn’t just go through to the other side like that. The door of light was a teleportation formation. If he just walked through, it was very likely to activate, and then he would be exposed. So, he had to wait.

It didn’t take long for a few undying cavalry to appear near him. They walked into the door of light, and then Yang Ye immediately transformed into a shadow that attached itself to an undying cavalry’s shadow.

In the door of light, Yang Ye carefully concealed himself with the Sword Domain and didn’t dare act rashly.

The undying race had peerless experts, and they weren’t experts that Dugu Juetian could compare to. So, he had to be careful!

A short time later, Yang Ye and them arrived in the undying race’s territory.

Just like the first time he arrived here, it was dark, and the spirit energy here was much scarcer than the large universe. Besides that, death energy filled the surroundings.

By contrast, this place seemed more like it was in the End Times, or it should be called the apocalypse!

Yang Ye soundlessly left the undying cavalries, glanced at the surroundings, and entered the pitch black city.

It was where he’d obtained the Sprite of Slaughter.

It was also where his father had forcefully teleported him away!

Yang Ye looked off into the distance. There was a tower there, and it was extremely tall to the point he couldn’t see its top. Four strands of black energy were floating around it, and they carried powerful energy. Even if he was so far away, Yang Ye could still sense it clearly.

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he snuck off into the distance. It didn’t take long for him to sneak into the tower. It was quite dark within it, and he could barely see things. Yang Ye looked up and was about to climb the tower when a man walked down slowly from the stairs.

He wore a loose robe, had hair that was dragged against the ground, and there was a red mark on his forehead. Besides that, a black iron claw floated by his right hand.

Yang Ye hurriedly held his breath and hid himself in a dark corner.

However, the man suddenly looked in Yang Ye’s direction while a slight arc curled up on his lips, “Lord Xiao Lou said someone had come in, and I didn’t really believe it. I didn’t expect it to be true. Interesting, interesting!”
