Chapter 117 – The League Of Doom

“You want to establish a force of your own?” After she heard Yang Ye’s plans, Qin Xiyue who lay in Yang Ye’s embrace asked with a slightly astounded expression. Obviously, she was slightly surprised by Yang Ye’s thoughts.

Yang Ye nodded and said, “What? Is it not possible?”

“That’s not the problem!” Qin Xiyue shook her head and said, “Do you know how much wealth is needed to establish an organization? Besides that, sourcing talented people and the required connections are a problem as well. Have you considered all of that?”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “I’ve naturally considered that. How about this? I’ll take care of the wealth, and you manage the human aspect. Alright?”

“Little Brother, it isn’t a small amount of wealth!” Qin Xiyue spoke in a serious manner.

“I’ll deal with it!” Yang Ye said with a low voice, “You just have to help me manage this matter. Of course, as repayment, I’ll try my best to cooperate with you and rescue your mother. Alright?”

“You’re serious?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Of course!”

Qin Xiyue went silent for a short moment, and then she said, “Deal. Let me be clear, you have to provide sufficient wealth, otherwise, I’m helpless to accomplish what you desire.”

Yang Ye smiled when he heard her agree, and he said, “Don’t worry, I won’t make you pay out of your own pockets!”

“What sort of organization do you intend to establish? Is it an intelligence organization or one that specializes in assassinations?” asked Qin Xiyue.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “In terms of intelligence, that intelligence organization of yours is sufficient. I want to establish an organization that specializes in assassinations.”

“May I ask why you intend to establish such an organization?”

“It’s best that you don’t know. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have the confidence to do it!” Yang Ye spoke in a flat tone. If the woman found out that he was establishing this organization to go against the Flower Palace, then the Qin Xiyue would probably think that he was mad.

Qin Xiyue rolled her eyes at Yang Ye, and then she didn’t continue asking about it. In her opinion, it was enough so long as this man was willing to cooperate with her and rescue her mother.

“Since we’ve already entered into a sincere cooperation, then you can tell me your real name, right?” said Qin Xiyue.

Yang Ye couldn’t help but laugh when he heard this. This woman really is discerning and knew that I used a fake name.

He hesitated for a moment before he said, “Yang Ye from South Peace City.”

“Qin Xiyue, a member of the Grand Qin Empire’s imperial household, and I’m currently Yang Ye’s lover!” Qin Xiyue blinked before as she spoke.

“Can you be a little more serious?”

“Little Brother, have you not heard that men only like bad girls?”

Yang Ye. “....”

After resting for an hour, Qin Xiyue’s injuries had recovered completely. She stood up, gazed towards the distance, and said with a serious expression, “Little Brother, earlier, that Jun Lin said that the Tomb of Emperor Zhou has appeared. I think it’s best for us to go have a look.”

“Why?” Yang Ye was puzzled, and he asked. “Don’t forget that we’re being pursued right now.”

Qin Xiyue nodded and said, “Little Brother, even though Big Sister doesn’t know why you intend to establish an assassination organization, but it’s clear that this is extremely important to you. Since it’s important, then we can’t establish an inferior organization. If we want to establish a formidable organization, then we need resources like cultivation techniques, combat techniques, Dark Treasures, and so on and so forth. There should be no shortage of these things in the Tomb of Emperor Zhou. So, don’t you think we should plunder it?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment, and then he smiled as he said, “That does make sense. Come, let’s go take a look at that Tomb of Emperor Zhou!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a violet light suddenly flashed. The violet mink that was in Yang Ye’s Vortex Dantian had appeared on Yang Ye’s shoulder.

At the same time, Yang Ye’s expression changed, and he didn’t give it even a moment of thought before executing the Gale Steps technique to shoot backward explosively. After that, he drew his sword and swiftly slashed down towards the corner of the wall that seemed completely empty.

Clang!

Right when Yang Ye’s sword descended, a pitch black dagger suddenly appeared in midair, and it blocked Yang Ye’s strike. At the same time, a black shadow gradually appeared at the corner of the wall.

After blocking Yang Ye’s sword strike, the shadow swiftly retreated explosively. However, the black shadow didn’t directly vanish beneath the night sky and stood over 30m away in front of Yang Ye instead.

Yang Ye didn’t follow up with another attack. He had a solemn expression as he gazed at the black shadow standing before him. The black shadow’s strange movement technique was truly too terrifying, and he had no choice but to fear it.

Before this, this person’s surprise attack had failed while the human cavalries were in battle with the Darkbeasts. Yang Ye thought that this assassin had given up on assassinating him or was waiting for another opportunity to use, but he’d never expected that this assassin would make an appearance at such a time. Was it intentional?

Qin Xiyue gazed at the black shadow and seemed to have thought of something, causing her pupils to constrict while her expression turned solemn. At the same time, a whip appeared in her hand.

“You’re able to control Darkbeasts, and it’s that Darkbeast on your shoulder who noticed me, right?” The black figure spoke with the voice of a woman, and it was extremely clear and melodious.

It’s actually a woman? Yang Ye was slightly surprised, and then he laughed coldly and said, “I can answer this question of yours, but you have to answer a question of mine as well, alright?”

“I’m unable to tell you who wants to kill you!” She seemed to know what Yang Ye wanted to ask about and directly refused.

Yang Ye laughed coldly and said, “Then do you think I would answer your question?”

After a few seconds of silence, the black shadow said, “The next time I attack will be the moment of your death!”

As soon as she finished speaking, the black shadow’s figure gradually vanished into the veil of night.

Yang Ye frowned when he saw the black shadow vanish. He’d originally intended to use the little fellow to capture the black shadow, but now it would seem like this way of thinking was too naïve. The black shadow’s possession of that strange movement technique allowed the black shadow to stand in an invincible position. After a few clashes with the black shadow, not to mention capturing the black shadow, he wouldn’t even know the black shadow’s gender if she hadn’t spoken!

“They are the League of Doom!” Right at this moment, Qin Xiyue spoke in a low voice.

“The League of Doom?” Yang Ye frowned and asked. “You know her origins?”

Qin Xiyue nodded and said, “She probably belongs to the League of Doom. It’s an organization that has given an extreme headache to the six great powers and the Grand Qin Empire. Their forces can be said to cover the entire southern territory, and so long as you’re able to pay their price, then they would even dare to assassinate the Master of the Origin School.”

“They even dare to assassinate the Master of the Origin School?” Yang Ye was shocked in his heart. The Master of the Origin School was at least an existence at the Exalt Realm or Monarch Realm, yet the League of Doom even dared to assassinate an expert of such level. Aren’t they a little too formidable!?

Qin Xiyue spoke in a low voice. “Their organization’s members are divided into Mortal Assassins, Earth Assassins, Heaven Assassins, Blood Assassins, and Ultimate Assassins. All those years ago, they dispatched an Ultimate Assassins to assassinate a Half-step Monarch Realm elder of the Origin School. After a period of five years, that Half-step Monarch Realm elder was successfully killed by that Ultimate Assassin, and this incident caused a stir in the entire southern territory.”

Yang Ye gulped down a mouthful of saliva. The Ultimate Assassins are actually so terrifying.

He suppressed the shock in his heart and asked. “Then didn’t the Origin School take revenge?”

Qin Xiyu shook her head and said, “How could they not take revenge? At that time, for the sake of taking revenge on this organization, the Origin School joined forces with the Flower Palace and Ghost Sect, and they even paid a huge price to convince my Grand Qin Empire to cooperate with them. However, not to mention taking revenge, the joint forces of four extraordinary powers were actually unable to capture even a single member of this organization! After a period of time, the Origin School had no choice but to give up on dealing with the League of Doom.”

“Even the Origin School was helpless against them?” Yang Ye was shocked in his heart once more. The Origin School was the strongest amongst the six great powers, yet such a power was actually helpless against an organization of assassins? Isn’t this organization a bit too terrifying?

“Who knows?” Qin Xiyue smiled and said, “On the surface, it seemed like the Origin School had given up on dealing with this organization. However, in truth, perhaps the Origin School had already infiltrated this organization!? Little Brother, exactly who did you offend that they would actually pay such a huge price to assassinate you!?”

“I want to know the answer to that question as well!” said Yang Ye. He really did desire to know the answer. He, Yang Ye, had killed all his enemies that he could kill, and the only enemy he couldn’t eliminate was the Flower Palace. But would the Flower Palace have to pay assassins to kill him?

Qin Xiyue spoke with a serious expression. “Little Brother, no matter who it is that wants you dead, you must be careful. This organization never gives up until they succeed in the assassination. In other words, since the moment the assignment was accepted, then unless the organization itself removes the assignment, otherwise, that person will constantly try to assassinate you until you die!”

Yang Ye frowned. This assassin really was a headache to him. Because the assassin retreated upon failure and refused to fight him to the death, so he was always in a passive position. If it wasn’t for the little fellow, then he might really have no choice but to hide in Talisman Peak. Because the assassin’s movement technique was truly too terrifying.

When she saw Yang Ye’s brows knit together tightly, Qin Xiyue said with a smile, “Little Brother, there’s no need for you to be worried as well. With this mysterious little fellow by your side and coupled with your strength, then unless they dispatch an Earth Assassin, otherwise, a Mortal Assassin would be utterly unable to harm you at all!”

“Right, with the little fellow by my side, even if I’m in a passive position, I stand at an invincible position. Let’s pay no further attention to this attention and head to the Tomb of Emperor Zhou!”

Qin Xiyue nodded with a smile on her face. Just like that, Yang Ye and Qin Xiyue inquired in the city about the location of the Tomb of Emperor Zhou, and then they immediately headed over.
