Chapter 940 – In My Opinion, You, Yang Ye, Are An Ant!

Editor: Conspiracing

Yu Wushuang was shocked speechless by the scene before her eyes, and it took her quite some time to recover, “You... you attained Void Rank sword intent?”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, and the space before him instantly returned to normal once his eyes were fully closed. A short while passed before Yang Ye opened his eyes again, and it was normal this time.

He shook his head and said, “How could it be that easy to attain? I merely gained some comprehension and strengthened my sword intent by quite a bit. Right, you know about Void Rank sword intent?”

Yu Wushuang nodded, “I heard about it from my father!”

Yang Ye asked, “Your father is a Saint?”

She replied, “Of course. Right, he’s best friends with your master, Daoist Gu.”

Yang Ye said, “I’ll definitely pay him a visit if I have the chance. Right, something happened to the disciples of the Ancient Sword School?”

Yu Wushuang answered, “Let him tell you!”

As soon as she finished speaking, a one-armed man who wore green clothes and carried a sword chest on his back walked into the room.

“Senior Brother Wu?” Yang Ye was quite surprised because the man was the Slow Sword, Wu Yanzhong. Moreover, Yang Ye noticed that Wu Yanzhong’s aura was very weak while numerous blade injuries of various sizes covered his body. Obviously, he was injured.

“We have a problem!” Wu Yanzhong revealed a gloomy expression on his face.

It didn’t take long for Wu Yanzhong to explain the sequence of events to Yang Ye.

After they received his request for help, the disciples of the Ancient Sword School who were at the Monarch Realm had immediately rushed towards Ocean of Clouds City, and there were over 3,000 of them. Normally, they would have been able to arrive at the city a few days ago. However, they were ambushed by a group of black clothed men of unknown origin while they were on their way to the city. They were caught off guard, and a few hundred of them perished in an instant!

The disciples of the Ancient Sword School immediately launched a counterattack, but they noticed to their astonishment that those black clothed men were truly formidable, and they lost even more of their companions after an intense battle with the black clothed men. In the end, if they hadn’t relied on the advantage in speed they possessed when flying on their swords, they would have probably been annihilated there....

Yang Ye gazed at Wu Yanzhong and asked, “You’re saying that there were only 13 of them?”

Wu Yanzhong’s face was quite unsightly, but he nodded with ‘great difficulty’ in the end.

Yang Ye asked, “All of them were just ordinary Half-Saints?”

Wu Yanzhong’s face wasn’t unsightly now, it was completely dark. A long time passed before he laughed bitterly and said, “Brother Yang, please stop asking about them. I wouldn’t know where to put my face if you do!”

Yang Ye and Yu Wushuang had solemn expressions on their faces when they heard him.

The disciples of the Ancient Sword School who’d come this time were the elites of the sect. Even though most of them were at the Monarch Realm, they were existences who could surmount their realms of cultivation to kill their opponents! Ordinary Half-Saints and Monarchs weren’t really different in the eyes of those elites from the Ancient Sword School. Moreover, there were over 50 Half-Saints in the group!

Over 50 Half-Saints and around 3,000 Monarchs had actually been forced to flee for their lives when facing just 13 experts.

Of course, Yang Ye had no intention of looking down on the disciples of the Ancient Sword School. Because he was very clearly aware that if they could fight those 13 black clothed men, then the disciples of the sword school would have definitely not fled. Since they’d chosen to flee, then it proved that those 13 black clothed men weren’t existences that they could defeat!

Fighting an enemy to the death while being clearly aware that the gap between their strengths was huge couldn’t be considered as bravery, it was stupidity!

“They are really strong!” Meanwhile, Wu Yanzhong suddenly said, “Besides Senior Sister Lu, Senior Brother Chen Dong, and you, no one else below the Saint Realm throughout our Ancient Sword School is capable of being a match for any one of them. Unfortunately, both Senior Brother Chen Dong and Senior Sister Lu hadn’t come with us. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have fallen into such an embarrassing situation.”

Yang Ye asked, “Where are the disciples of our sword school now?”

“Outside the mountain range!” Wu Yanzhong spoke in a low voice, “As soon as we arrived at the outer area of the mountain range, we noticed that the sky of the entire mountain range is covered by a powerful restriction, so we couldn’t fly at all and had no choice but to walk. After we entered the mountain range, we weren’t just pursued by those 12 people, we were even besieged by the wolves of Welkin Wolf Mountain Range. I seize the opportunity created by the chaos and was protected by our other brothers in order to escape and rush to the city.”

When he spoke up to this point, he took a step forward and said, “Brother Yang, please act immediately. If you’re too late, then I can only imagine how many brothers we would lose.”

Yang Ye gazed at Yu Wushuang and said, “Don’t tell anyone that I left the city. Just say that I’m in closed door cultivation if anyone asks!”

“I understand!” Yu Wushuang nodded, “Be careful!” She didn’t stop Yang Ye. Even though those 13 black clothed men were definitely extremely strong, she was confident in Yang Ye. If Yang Ye intended to flee, then unless he was pursued by a Saint, even Lou Qianxiao and the other 4 top geniuses of the prefecture could only watch as he escaped. After all, Yang Ye had comprehended the Laws of Speed!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he withdrew his gaze and looked at Wu Yanzhong, “Lead the way!”

Just like that, Yang Ye and Wu Yanzhong left the city in secret, and they dashed towards the mountain range. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Yang Ye’s brows suddenly knit tightly together when he entered the forest, and he stopped abruptly upon arriving at an empty plain.

Wu Yanzhong asked with bewilderment, “Brother Yang, what’s wrong?”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Leave!”

Wu Yanzhong’s expression changed slightly. He was no fool, so he naturally knew that they were in trouble.

“I never expected that another genius besides Lu Wan’er has appeared in the Ancient Sword School!” A voice resounded abruptly, and then 13 black clothed figures suddenly appeared here and surrounded both Yang Ye and Wu Yanzhong. Besides the 13 black clothed figures, Yang Ye saw one more person, and it was that man who wore a ghost mask. Yang Ye seemed to have realized something when he saw the man who wore the ghost mask.

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment, and then his gaze descended onto the black clothed figures. They were extremely mysterious because they were floating, and their bodies seemed indistinct like souls. Most importantly, Yang Ye couldn’t sense their auras at all.

“It’s them!” Wu Yanzhong immediately revealed a solemn expression when he saw them.

Yang Ye said, “Looks like killing the disciples of the Ancient Sword School wasn’t your Sky Divine Hall’s true motive. Your true objective was me.”

Wu Yanzhong’s face turned slightly pale when he heard Yang Ye. At this moment, how could he not realize that their true objective wasn’t the disciples of the sword school, and they’d only ambushed the disciples of the ancient sword school to draw Yang Ye out of the city. As for why he was able to escape and flee to the city, it was probably because they’d allowed him to!

Wu Yanzhong gazed at Yang Ye and spoke bitterly, “I’m sorry!”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “It’s I who should say sorry. All of you wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for me. Alright, I don’t like to waste my breath or be sentimental. Since we’re from the same sect, then we should live and die together. Right?”

Wu Yanzhong nodded, “Indeed!”

“Yang Ye, Ye Yang. Haha. I never expected that you’re that Yang Ye who challenged the Dao Order. I truly never expected you to come to the Ocean of Clouds Academy to be an instructor!” The man wearing the ghost mask said, “The Ancient Sword School first had Lu Wan’er, and not it has you as well. Looks like it’s going to rise up in the world. Unfortunately, they won’t have the chance to succeed. Because you’re going to die!”

“You just can’t stop spouting nonsense!” As soon as he finished speaking, a ray of light flashed and instantly arrived before the man wearing a ghost mask. However, one of the black clothed men suddenly appeared in front of the masked man. The black clothed man waved his right hand, and a black vortex appeared out of thin air before soundlessly sucking away Yang Ye’s sword energy in an instant!

The masked man laughed coldly, “Yang Ye, no matter how strong you are, you’ll definitely die today. Do you know who they are? They are the 13 Shadows of the Nether Pavilion in the Central Divine Prefecture! Even though they’re only Half-Saints, their joint strength is boundlessly close to that of a Saint. Not to mention you, even Lu Wan’er would definitely perish before them!”

The Nether Pavilion!

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted slightly when he heard that name. The Nether Pavilion was naturally not unfamiliar to him. Because Nether Maiden said that she was from the Nether Pavilion. Even though he didn’t know why the Nether Pavilion was in the Radiant Dimension while Nether Maiden was on Profounder Continent, he had no doubt that it was definitely an extremely terrifying existence.

Nether Maiden had proved that, and these black clothed men had proved that as well!

Suddenly, the black clothed man who led the group spoke abruptly, “Where’s You Wuying?”

“You Wuying?” Yang Ye frowned a little. He hadn’t expected them to ask about her whereabouts.

Meanwhile, the masked man suddenly said, “Yang Ye, Consort You is the reincarnation of the Nether Pavilion’s Shadow Maiden. They came to Pine Prefecture in order to take her back. So, quickly hand her over and end your own life. Otherwise, even death would be difficult for you!”

Yang Ye paid no attention to the masked man. He gazed at the black clothed man who led the group, “Do you know Nether Maiden?”

“Her highness, Nether Maiden!” The black clothed man who led the group spoke with slight surprise, “Why do you know her name!?”

“So she’s fine!” Yang Ye heaved a slight sigh of relief.

Meanwhile, the black clothed man suddenly spoke solemnly, “Tell me why you know her name!”

“We can be considered to be friends!” Yang Ye spoke the truth. He wasn’t lying because they really were friends.

“How dare you!” The black clothed man roared, “Are you even worthy of being her highness’ friend? How laughable! I don’t want to waste my breath on you. Quickly hand over her highness, the Shadow Maiden. Otherwise, I’ll obliterate you right now!”

Yang Ye’s face fell, “Brother Wu, leave and lead the members of our sword school to the city!”

Wu Yanzhong wanted to say something, but Yang Ye looked him in the eyes and said, “You’ll only be a burden to me!”

Wu Yanzhong’s face froze. Quite some time passed before he spoke bitterly, “It’s not nice to be so frank.” As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of light that shot towards the distance.

The black clothed men were about to attack, but Yang Ye suddenly said, “Don’t you want to know where your Shadow Maiden is?”

The masked man suddenly said, “He can’t be allowed to leave!”

The black clothed man who led the group suddenly turned to look at the masked man, “Are you giving me an order?”

The masked man’s figure shook slightly, and he hurriedly said, “I dare not. But....”

“There are no buts!” The black clothed man said, “Even though we agreed to help your Sky Divine Hal eliminate Yang Ye in exchange for taking her highness, Shadow Maiden, back with us, we didn’t agree to help you kill anyone else.”

The masked man was at a loss for words.

Yang Ye suddenly said, “I don’t believe that. All of you would kill me regardless of whether I tell you where she is, right?”

The black clothed man, “That’s not wrong!”

Yang Ye said, “I refuse to accept that!”

“But what can you do?” The black clothed man spoke with disdain, “In my opinion, you, Yang Ye, are an ant!”
