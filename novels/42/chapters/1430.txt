Chapter 1431 – The Ominous Territory!

A day later.

Besides Wildlands Stellar Region, all the other stellar regions had retreated from the worlds which once belonged to Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region.

Not only had they retreated, they had even dispatched their forces to express their willingness to submit to Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region.

That surprised Yang Ye and Zhuang Weiran a little. Both of them hadn’t expected those stellar regions to surrender like that.

Are my words that influential?

Actually, those stellar regions had no choice but to surrender. Because even if Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region didn’t look for trouble with them, the other stellar regions would. Because their current strength couldn’t even compare to a one star stellar region. It could be said that besides Wildlands Stellar Region, each of the other stellar regions which participated in the attack on Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region only had around one Deity left.

The reason they chose to surrender to Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region was that no other stellar region dared to accept their surrender.

After all, everyone knew that they’d offended Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region. So, if they accepted those stellar regions, it would be equivalent to taking the enmity between those stellar regions and Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region.

Who would dare to do that?

Not to mention anything else, just Yang Ye alone could deter a three star stellar region.

Just think about it. If he activated the Stellar Sword Diagram in a stellar region.... Perhaps its might wouldn’t be sufficient to destroy a stellar region, but it was more than enough to destroy a single medium world. Not to mention that Yang Ye had three extremely strong beasts by his side.

So, no one would offend Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region for so little benefit.

Thus, if those stellar regions wanted to survive, they had no choice but to surrender to Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region. The reason they hadn’t replied before this was because they felt something might have happened to Yang Ye. After all, based on Yang Ye’s current cultivation, he would definitely be unable to endure activating such a heaven defying treasure like the Stellar Sword Diagram. So, they still held on to a shred of hope.

However, once Ye Liuyun passed Yang Ye’s message to them, that shred of hope within their hearts had been destroyed.

Yang Ye was still alive!

After they found out about that, they stopped hesitating.

...

Wargod Hall.

There were only three people here. Yang Ye, Zhuang Weiran, and Ye Liuyun.

“Amongst the stellar regions that have surrendered, there are a total of 370 plus small worlds and 6 Deities. As for Semi-Deities, there are over 100 in total.” Ye Liuyun spoke slowly, “If we take them all in, our Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region’s strength will be in the top five of the three star stellar regions!”

Yang Ye gazed at her and asked, “Only the top five?”

Ye Liuyun rolled her eyes at him, “What else? The first?”

Yang Ye smiled with embarrassment, “I think that we should be almost on par with a four star stellar region.”

Ye Liuyun shook her head, “That’s because you don’t know much about these lower dimensions. Do you know... all the worlds beneath the large world are considered the lower dimensions. But do you know how huge the lower dimensions are?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Don’t ask me. Just tell me.”

She explained, “The lower dimensions are extremely huge. Its size is beyond your imagination. A Deity once exhausted 10 years of time yet was still unable to locate the ends of the lower dimensions. In the end, someone divided the lower dimensions into territories — the Eastern Territory, Western Territory, Southern Territory, and Northern Territory. We’re in the Eastern Territory. There are over a dozen three star stellar regions in the Northern Territory, but there’s only a single four star stellar region. That four star stellar region is quite far away from us. Even if stellar teleportation formations are utilized, it would take around three days to get there!”

Yang Ye felt quite embarrassed. He’d always thought that the lower dimensions were extremely small. But it turned out that it wasn’t small, and he was just looking up at the sky from the bottom of a well.

“Actually, there’s one more territory!” Meanwhile, Zhuang Weiran spoke abruptly, “The Ominous Territory!”

Yang Ye and Ye Liuyun gazed at her, “The Ominous Territory?”

Zhuang Weiran nodded slightly, “It’s quite mysterious, and comparatively dangerous. Very few know about it. Actually, it’s extremely few.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “The Ominous Territory?”

She explained, “Its origins can’t be traced. All we do know is that it’s extremely dangerous, and countless Deities have died there. However, many experts still head there. Because there are too many fortuitous encounters waiting to be found there.”

“Fortuitous encounters?” Ye Liuyun asked, “There’s a lot of treasures there?”

Zhuang Weiran nodded slightly, “The Celestial Demon Lord’s inheritance and my father’s inheritance were obtained there. Right, those two Celestial Demon Wolves are from there as well.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why have you suddenly mentioned that territory?”

Zhuang Weiran remained silent for a while, and then she said, “I hope you’ll go there.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Zhuang Weiran spoke solemnly, “There’s a forest there, the Forest of Darkness. At the depths of that forest is a spring, the Spring of Life. The Dew of Life flows within the spring, and it can increase lifespan.”

It can increase lifespan! Yang Ye was visibly moved.

What did he lack the most right now?

Lifespan!

Even with the Primordial Pagoda in his possession, it was difficult to attain the Semi-Deity Realm within three months. So, he had to increase his lifespan and gain more time to cultivate.

Ye Liuyun asked, “Isn’t it very dangerous?” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Zhuang Weiran gazed at Yang Ye and said, “With your strength and the three of them, you can go anywhere in this world. However, you absolutely can’t be careless in the Ominous Territory. Even with the Celestial Demon Lord’s strength, and even when he had the assistance of those two Celestial Demon Wolves and that Celestial Demon, he still didn’t dare to go deep into the Ominous Territory or stay for long.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t worry, I won’t underestimate my enemies.”

Many had underestimated him in the past, and his sword had turned them into souls of the dead. So, he would absolutely not underestimate anymore.

Zhuang Weiran nodded slightly, “If it wasn’t because of your lifespan, I wouldn’t have told you about the Ominous Territory. It’s not because I think you’re weak, it’s because you’re too fierce. I really can’t imagine what would happen once you head there, and the situation there can’t be compared to the world outside it.”

Yang Ye’s face was completely dark because she was saying that he was really good at causing trouble!

As if she knew what he was thinking, Zhuang Weiran spoke softly, “I’m not afraid that you’ll cause trouble. I’m afraid that others will provoke you. You’re too unyielding and refuse to suffer any losses. So, you won’t hold back if others offend you, and that’s exactly why it’s easy for trouble to arise.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “That’s my fault....”

“Of course it isn’t your fault!” Zhuang Weiran shook her head slightly, “Your character is the reason you’ve been able to gain such attainments in the Sword Dao. A sword cultivator should have an edge and be fearless, and that’s just what your character is like. So, your Sword Dao improves rapidly. Because you fear no one and no problem. No matter how strong your enemy is or how great their backing is, you still dare to draw your sword. Simply speaking, you never suppress your sword, and you definitely draw it when it should be drawn. Many sword cultivators aren’t able to accomplish that.”

Just as Zhuang Weiran had said, the main reason Yang Ye’s attainments in the Sword Dao improved so rapidly was that he’d never suppressed his sword.

Sword cultivators stressed on the cultivation of the mind and heart. If one’s desires remained unimpeded, the Sword Dao would thrive.

Yang Ye’s desires had always been unimpeded. Because he’d never suppressed them. He’d drawn his sword when he should. That was exactly why his Sword Dao grew at an unparalleled pace.

As for the growth of his slaughter intent....

Actually, the growth of slaughter intent was very simple. It was achieved by killing.

If an ordinary person was allowed to kill a few hundred thousand people, then perhaps even an ordinary person could comprehend slaughter intent.

Meanwhile, Ye Liuyun suddenly asked, “When will you be traveling to the Ominous Territory?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a while, and then he said, “I still have two things to do. I’ll go there once I’m done.”

Ye Liuyun said, “One of them is Wildlands Stellar Region. What about the other?”

The other stellar regions that occupied the worlds which once belonged to Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region had returned them, and they’d even surrendered to Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region. However, there had been no reply from Wildlands Stellar Region, so they definitely had to deal with it.

Yang Ye replied, “I owe someone a favor. I have to repay it a little at least.”

Ye Liuyun asked, “Azure Cloud Merchant Group?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Liuyun, don’t be too smart. I won’t talk to you anymore if you’re always like this.” After all, she seemed like a worm in his belly that knew everything!

Ye Liuyun grinned and said, “You do have to deal with that, or you would be quite ungrateful.”

Yang Ye nodded. Nangong Qin had helped him tremendously. Yet now, she’d been punished because of him. So, he naturally had to help her. Otherwise, he really would be quite ungrateful like Ye Liuyun had said.

Ye Liuyun asked, “When are you leaving?”

Yang Ye answered, “Now!” He had less than three months to live, so he naturally didn’t dare to waste any time.

Zhuang Weiran said, “Azure Cloud Merchant Group is a merchant group which belongs to a single clan, the Nangong Clan. The Nangong Clan has a medium world and over 100 small worlds. It’s a three star stellar region as well. Even though it isn’t as strong as Wildlands Stellar Region or Celestial Demon Stellar Region, their influence is something that both Wildlands Stellar Region and Celestial Demon Stellar Region can’t compare to. After all, there are truly too many stellar regions working together with them. Especially their network of information, it can be considered the greatest in the Eastern Territory!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Discuss the matter with them once you get there. You’re there to help Nangong Qin and not fight, right?”

Ye Liuyun covered her mouth and chuckled.

Yang Ye’s face was dark. Because he seemed like a troublemaker to her.

Actually, Zhuang Weiran’s worries were very understandable. She’d known Yang Ye for some time, and she knew his temper quite well. It could be said that it was very easy for someone with Yang Ye’s character to cause trouble. It was absolutely true because Yang Ye’s troubles had never ended.

The corners of Zhuang Weiran’s mouth curled up when she noticed the expression on Yang Ye’s face, “Alright, I’m not going to complain further. Go on.”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly walked over to her and wrapped his arm around her waist. He spoke softly, “Weiran, remember what I said when we fought the Celestial Demon Lord? At that time, I said that you have to promise me something if we survived.”

Zhuang Weiran nodded slightly in response.

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth curled up, and he spoke softly, “I....”

Only Zhuang Weiran knew what Yang Ye had said, but it had caused her face to suddenly turn slightly red.
