Chapter 2609 – Who Do You Think You Are?

After they left the Ancient Sword Sect, they left Eternal Kingdom and arrived at Eternal Border!

The entrance to the Void World wasn’t in Eternal Kingdom.

Yang Ye couldn’t help but sigh with emotion upon returning to Eternal Border.

Presently, it wasn’t as prosperous as it had been. It had suffered from internal strife, and it had no right to speak amongst the other worlds in the universe!

Now, it was bound to become a battlefield for the desolate race and Eternal Kingdom.

Obviously, the people here were aware of it. So, practically most of them had left Eternal Border for other worlds.

It was quiet!

Extremely quiet!

Blood Maiden spoke softly by Yang Ye’s side, “War is about to come.”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Fight! Fight until this world is gone, only then will they be happy.”

Yang Ye suddenly looked to the side when he spoke up to this point. A woman had appeared on his right.

A woman in a white dress.

Yang Ye was stunned by the sight of her.

Beautiful!

It was Yang Ye’s first impression!

She was breathtakingly beautiful!

That was the second feeling Yang Ye had!

Yang Ye couldn’t describe her beauty with any words. It should be said that he felt that no words in this world could describe her beauty.

Yang Ye wasn’t the only one, even Blood Maiden was dazed by her beauty.

Blood Maiden was drop dead gorgeous too, but she actually felt inferior before the woman!

Suddenly, Executor shook within Yang Ye, and then a sword howl resounded, causing Yang Ye to return to his senses.

He was extremely shocked as he gazed at her again!

She had actually caused him to become dazed!

That shouldn’t have happened!

He was a sword cultivator, and both his Sword Dao and Sword Heart were pure, so it was absolutely impossible for him to be dazed by beauty!

It was very unusual!

Blood Maiden returned to her senses too, and a solemn expression covered her face!

Meanwhile, the woman in white gazed at them.

She had a tall and slender figure with a red dot between her brows. Of course, the most striking part of her was her eyes. Her eyes were calm and clear, causing others to find it difficult to move their gazes away from her eyes!

Something worth mentioning was that her pupils were gray!

Yang Ye and Blood Maiden were extremely vigilant!

The woman sized up Yang Ye and said, “I heard what you said. You’re happy to see this world be destroyed?”

Yang Ye replied, “Not at all.”

She asked, “Then what are your thoughts?”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

She glanced at the surroundings, “This place will turn into a battlefield soon, and then it will vanish. 90% of the living beings here will be annihilated.”

Yang Ye glanced at her, “You’re from Eternal Border?”

“Eternal Border?” She paused for a moment, and then she nodded, “Sort of. I witnessed the birth of this world. From nothing to something, and then it prospered before finally suffering decline…”

Yang Ye said, “Isn’t that because they failed to show restraint? Or I should say, isn’t it part of the laws of the universe?”

She suddenly chuckled.

The world dimmed in comparison before her smile.

The woman glanced at Yang Ye, “Life and death are laws of the universe, but this world isn’t about to vanish because of the universe’s laws, it is due to man instead.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Isn’t that part of the universe’s laws too?”

She suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, and she just looked at him for quite some time.

A long time later, she walked over to the Eternal River and touched it lightly with her right hand, “You’re right, it is a part of the universe’s laws.”

She gazed at Yang Ye once more.

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s figure stiffened, and then Executor charged out of him and appeared before her.

Yang Ye was astounded!

She gazed at Executor for a short while before pressing two fingers against its blade and moving them slowly down its blade. As her fingers moved, the sword intent and slaughter intent on Executor vanished completely!

Her gaze stopped at the tip of the sword. The sword’s tip wasn’t there.

It lacked a part of itself!

She flicked it back to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at her with bewilderment, and she said, “It wasn’t called Executor in the past, it was called Heaven Executor. It has had a few masters now, and I’m very disappointed in them all. As for you, you surprised me a little. I’ve fully unsealed its strength for you, and half of its spirit is about to awaken. At that time, it will regain a trade of its true form.”

“Half? A trace?” Yang Ye frowned, “What do you mean?”

She walked slowly toward the distance, “Scan it carefully!”

Yang Ye glanced at her and grabbed Executor, and then he closed his eyes slowly. A short while later, Yang Ye’s hand trembled, and then he opened his eyes, “Impossible!”

The sword wasn’t real!

Actually, it should be said that the sword wasn’t complete!

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Its tip?”

She replied, “Heaven Executor’s core is in its tip. Its main Sword Spirit resides in its tip too. The Sword Spirit within this sword isn’t complete.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “It was broken by Destiny, right?”

She nodded, “Yes!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why didn’t Destiny just destroy it?”

The woman smiled, “Man is the true culprit, nor sword. The sword’s actions are guided by the man. It was called Heaven Executor in the past, but in the hands of people, it became Executor, a weapon of slaughter.”

Yang Ye said, “It’s still a weapon of slaughter in my hands.”

She smiled, “You’re a little different.”

She suddenly shot a glance into the sky, “It’s time to go.”

Her figure gradually turned ethereal.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly asked, “What’s your name?”

She glanced at him, “One.”

One!

Yang Ye was stunned.

One?FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

What the heck?

Yang Ye wanted to ask a little more, but she had vanished.

A short while later, Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “There really are all sorts of existences hidden throughout the universe!”

Blood Maiden nodded, “She felt very strange to me, but I can’t put a finger on it!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Forget that, let’s go look for Eldest Sister!”

She nodded and vanished on the spot with Yang Ye.

Yang Ye hadn’t noticed that once he placed Executor back within the Primordial Pagoda, a small thing soundlessly appeared on it. It seemed very excited and moved along the blade. A short while later, it was at the tip of the sword. Suddenly, a strand of mysterious energy appeared on Executor, and the little thing shook violently as if it was struggling and resisting. However, it only lasted for an instant before it merged completely with the sword.

The seal on Executor had been undone, but another mysterious seal had been placed on it!

…

The Void World.

Yang Ye and Blood Maiden traveled through a teleportation formation on World Mountain and arrived at the Void World. The reason he hadn’t used the Myriad World Diagram was because this teleportation platform was safer.

He couldn’t tell which part of the Void World that the Myriad World Diagram would send him to!

Yang Ye didn’t know much about the Void World. After all, he’d never been here. However, according to Blood Maiden, there were some powerful beings here.

Blood Maiden pointed at a distant mountain range, “According to my investigations, the Void World has a space called the Void Space, and there are endless Void Planets there. I think Eldest Sister may have gone there.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Blood Maiden replied solemnly, “Her unique ability is to devour, and those Void Planets have no life on them. I think she has gone to devour them. I could still contact her before this, but for some reason, I lost communication with her later on.”

Yang Ye asked, “You’ve been there?”

Blood Maiden shook her head, “I couldn’t. There are some void beings here, and that place is a forbidden area in this world.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “I asked for your help because I want you to help me fight them.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Then you’ve come to the right person. I’m quite good at fighting!”

Blood Maiden smiled, “Let’s go!”

They vanished on the spot.

But it didn’t take long for them to stop. Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “We’re being watched!”

Blood Maiden nodded.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and cupped his fist toward the sky, “I’m Yang Ye, the Sect Master of Eternal Kingdom’s Ancient Sword Sect. Please allow us passage…”

Suddenly, the space before Yang Ye warped, and then a black shadow swept out from it. The shadow instantly enveloped Yang Ye, and then Yang Ye vanished!

The black shadow vanished as well!

Blood Maiden’s expression changed drastically from the sight of this. Suddenly, the space before her was torn open, and then Yang Ye emerged from within it.

Yang Ye gazed at her and smiled with embarrassment, “My name isn’t that useful.”

He glanced at the surroundings, “We’re just here to find someone, not to fight.”

“Find someone?” A hoarse voice resounded, “Outsiders are not welcome here, so fuck off.”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. Suddenly, the hoarse voice said, “Wait! You said your name is Yang Ye?’

Yang Ye nodded, “It is. I wonder if you can give me some face?”

“Hmph!” The voice grunted coldly, “Give you face? Who do you think you are?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
