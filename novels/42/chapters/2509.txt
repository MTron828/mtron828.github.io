Chapter 2510 – I Make the Decisions in the Ye Clan!

They returned to the city, and then Ye Zhibei left. A short while later, Xing Biqing sent him a huge gift.

200 World crystals and 2 Lord Realm inner cores.

It was his compensation!

Yang Ye didn’t refuse it and accepted it all.

Yang Ye swallowed an inner core while five World Crystals laid there before him. They were burning and the energy within them was ceaselessly surging toward him.

Meanwhile, once he’d swallowed the inner core, another strand of pure spirit energy erupted from within him.

Charging into the next realm of cultivation!

He was charging into the Three World Realm. So long as his body attained the Three World Realm, his cultivation could do the same. At that time, his strength would rise by another level.

This time, Yang Ye didn’t rush things and carefully sensed the state of his body.

After absorbing all the energy, he felt that the energy was replenishing his body. Actually, his body was at a certain level, and unless he obtained special fortuitous encounters, undergoing a qualitative transformation was utterly impossible.

All he could do was improve his body upon his existing foundation!

As he sensed the fine changes in his body, Yang Ye was extremely happy. It felt like a sprint breeze brushing against his face. It was calm and warm, and extremely comfortable.

Just like that, a few days passed before a strand of aura swept out from within Yang Ye!

Yang Ye stood up, and as soon as he did, the aura vanished without a trace.

The Three World Realm!

His body was at the Three World Realm now, and even his cultivation was at the Three World Realm.

The strength to destroy three worlds!

Actually, he couldn’t be described as being at the Three World Realm. After all, both his cultivation and body were at the Three World Realm.

Yang Ye left the cultivation room, went up to the clouds, and issued a command in his heart.

Swoosh! Swish!

Two rays of light soundlessly appeared far away!

Flying swords!

Yang Ye grinned. After his body and cultivation improved, both his soul and body had strengthened tremendously. Now, his flying swords were at least 30% faster than before!

While it was just 30%, it represented that if he faced a Five World Realm expert now, he would have no need for his Divine Treasures and the Sword Domain. He could kill a Five World Realm expert with just his flying swords!

Maybe even instantly annihilate a Five World Realm expert!

Sword cultivators were unlike other cultivators. At most times, sword cultivators needed just a single attack to kill their opponent! Of course, there were also many times where a single attack wouldn’t result in a kill, and it resulted in their own deaths instead!

But Yang Ye was different, he still had his body even without the sword!

A sword cultivator and body cultivator!

Besides his flying swords, Yang Ye tested the Sword Domain and Heavenrend. Presently, he could use Heavenrend and overlap it 10 times with the Sword Domain!

If he overlapped 10 attacks with Heavenrend in the Sword Domain, then it was absolutely powerful!

Presently, he was completely capable of facing Five World Realm experts!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda as his door was being knocked.

Yang Ye opened the door, and he saw Ye Zhibei!

She sized up Yang Ye, “The Three World Realm?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She nodded slightly, “I’ve notified the clan that you’re returning today!”

Yang Ye asked, “To acknowledge the clan’s ancestors? I can’t accept doing that.”

She glanced at him and replied, “That isn’t necessary. You’re just returning to meet everyone and receive their acknowledgment, so that the world will know that you are part of my Ye Clan.”

Yang Ye glanced at her and smiled, “I don’t understand something. Why do you insist on taking me to the Ye Clan? The Ye Clan doesn’t need someone like me, does it?”

She shook her head slightly, “You’re wrong.”

She walked over to the side and had a seat, and she took a bite of her cucumber before she continued, “The clans and various powers throughout Eternal Kingdom don’t just compete in resources and reserves, we compete in the younger generation too. Because the younger generation represents a clan’s future. All those years ago, the Di Clan’s greatest monstrous genius perished, and that’s why they were driven out. Of course, there were other reasons too. However, it was the main reason. Because others felt they had no future. A clan is strong when their young is strong!”

Yang Ye asked, “So, the Ye Clan will be in great danger without you, right?”

She replied indifferently, “The older generation rarely fight each other. Because the Eternal Lord is there to keep them from it. However, conflict is unavoidable. So, the various powers and clans diverted such conflict to the younger generation. Even a clan as powerful as the Xing Clan would have to shrink back without Xing Biqing. Because no matter how strong the Eternal Lord is, the division of many resources is decided by the younger generation.”

Yang Ye gained a rough understanding at this point!

Because it had to fight the desolate race, such a method had appeared in Eternal Kingdom. The older generation didn’t fight each other, and the younger generation decided everything. Obviously, the various powers throughout Eternal Kingdom had agreed to this method.

After all, they had the desolate race waiting to attack them. If they fought too much, it would be the desolate race that benefitted in the end, and they would lose everything!

But if the younger generation fought, it would be within their control, and it wouldn’t cause them to suffer severe losses!

Needless to say, it was a pretty good method! However, it depended on their geniuses.

Ye Zhibei added, “If my Ye Clan acknowledges you as a member of the Ye Clan, then the other powers will do the same. Because we have acknowledged you.”

Yang Ye came to an understanding at this point.

It was a trade!

As for whether Yang Ye really was a member of the Ye Clan, it wasn’t that important anymore!

Of course, as far as the Ye Clan was concerned, it would be great if Yang Ye really did belong to the Ye Clan. But if he didn’t, it was fine. In any case, his presence was equivalent to giving the Ye Clan another extraordinary genius to deter the other powers of Eternal Kingdom!

It was beneficial for both parties!

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time and said, “Let’s go!”

She understood what he meant, so she nodded and left the House of Indulgence with Yang Ye.

Once they left the House of Indulgence, while Xing Biqing hadn’t come, Emerald had come on her behalf to send them off.

Emerald said, “My young miss has gone home, and she’ll only be returning to the War Dimension in a few days. She asked me to send you off!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “It’s fine!”𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ye Zhibei suddenly said, “It’s necessary!”

Yang Ye was puzzled. Meanwhile, Emerald produced two golden talismans, and she passed them to Yang Ye and Ye Zhibei. Ye Zhibei didn’t refuse. She took them and crushed one of them.

Swish!

In an instant, a golden teleportation formation appeared nearby!

Ye Zhibei spoke indifferently, “We can’t leave the War Dimension without them!”

She walked into the teleportation formation, and Yang Ye walked in as well. A short while later, they vanished on the spot.

Outside the War Dimension.

Yang Ye and Ye Zhibei suddenly appeared out of thin air in the sky.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, but he didn’t notice anything familiar from the War Dimension. Or to be more precise, he couldn’t sense the War Dimension anymore.

As if she knew what he was thinking, Ye Zhibei explained, “Only special people can enter the War Dimension, so it’s usually in a concealed state. Even a Lord Realm expert cannot enter by force. The two talismans were teleportation formations. If someone within the War Dimension sought to leave, then that person would have to purchase one of these teleportation talismans. It’s around 10 World Crystals each, and we need two for every time we head outside. One to go out, one to get back in!”

Yang Ye suddenly said, “That’s such a scam!”

She glanced at him and said, “The Xing Clan is the richest. Because they won many special privileges for the War Dimension, they’re absolutely wealthy.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Then I have to hold on tight to Miss Biqing!”

Ye Zhibei didn’t say anything and just shot toward the distance.

Yang Ye shrugged and followed her.

In the sky, Yang Ye shot forward on his sword, and Ye Zhibei was right by his side.

As they traveled, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Your return to the Ye Clan is just a process, and you don’t have to meet anyone but the patriarch.”

Yang Ye asked, “What about after that?”

Ye Zhibei spoke indifferently, “And then we’ll leave and return to the War Dimension. As for the future, we’ll talk about it in the future. What do you think?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded, “Alright!”

Ye Zhibei said, “The other powers have their eyes on you right now, especially the Leng Clan. So, returning to the Ye Clan with me represents that it’s an issue between the Ye Clan and the Leng Clan now. They will definitely come to my Ye Clan. So, just ignore everything when that happens. I’ll deal with it.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “It won’t cause any trouble for the Ye Clan, right? If it’s troublesome, I can deal with it myself!”

She shook her head, “It’ll just amount to an argument. If they really want to fight, I’m not afraid of their Eldest Young Master.”

Yang Ye said, “I don’t like to trouble other people.”

She nodded and said, “Then if there’s a fight, you can fight it!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

They sped up, and it didn’t take long for them to enter the South Region. As soon as they arrived in the South Region, a gray robed old man appeared before them. The old man was a Five World Realm expert!

The old man bowed slightly to Ye Zhibei, “Eldest Young Miss, the patriarch has given the order that you should return alone!”

Yang Ye glanced at the old man and remained silent. Obviously, the old man was speaking about him!

Ye Zhibei frowned slightly, “What’s the meaning of this?”

The old man hesitated for a moment and replied, “The Leng Clan’s Patriarch is in our clan!”

Ye Zhibei replied indifferently, “And?”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and hesitated to speak.

Yang Ye smiled, “Miss Ye, since I’m not welcome in the Ye Clan, then I’ll be leaving!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he was about to leave when Ye Zhibei suddenly said, “That isn’t necessary!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she said, “I make the decisions in the Ye Clan!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

The old man laughed bitterly and said, “Eldest Young Miss, the Patriarch said that it isn’t necessary to make enemies of the Leng Clan for a single person. It isn’t worth it.”

Ye Zhibei glanced at the old man and gazed at Yang Ye, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Since the Ye Clan doesn’t welcome my arrival, then let’s…”

Ye Zhibei suddenly interrupted Yang Ye, “I told you, I make the decisions in the Ye Clan.”

She gazed at the old man, “From this moment onward, “I’m removing my father from his position as patriarch!”

Yang Ye was flabbergasted.
