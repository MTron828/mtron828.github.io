Chapter 1607 - You’re Like A Dog If You Have No Strength!

Translator: InVader RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Spare the Lin Clan?

There wasn’t anything wrong with his head. Just as he’d said, would the Lin Clan spare him or Snowy if they fell into the Lin Clan’s hands? The answer was a definite no. He was very well aware that clans like the Lin Clan would only wag their tails like dogs if a person was strong, but if a person was weak, then they wouldn’t show any mercy!

Benevolence to the enemy was cruelty to oneself!

Besides that, the Lin Clan dared to target Snowy, and he absolutely couldn’t tolerate that!

A wisp of praise flashed through Yang Xuan’s eyes when she heard Yang Ye. She patted him on the shoulder, “Good, very good. The men of my Yang Clan should be vengeful!”

Yang Ye didn’t know what to say.

Suddenly, the Lin Clan’s Patriarch shot towards outer space in an effort to escape.

Once he heard Yang Ye, he knew that it was impossible to make Yang Ye spare the Lin Clan. So, he’d decisively chosen to flee.

A cold smile curled up on the corners of Yang Xuan’s mouth when she saw the Lin Clan’s Patriarch flee. A moment later, she vanished on the spot, and it didn’t take long for an explosion to resound from far away. After that, the entire expanse of space here trembled violently.

Two breaths of time later, she was back in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye asked, “He’s dead?”

Yang Xuan lifted up her brows, “What else?”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. This auntie of mine is quite formidable!

Meanwhile, the seven violet armored experts who’d left earlier had appeared by Yang Xuan’s side. They bowed slightly to her and moved behind her.

“Your bloodline…” Meanwhile, Yang Xuan suddenly tapped a finger against Yang Ye’s chest, “You have the Yang Clan’s bloodline, so why is it deathly silent?”

She frowned when she spoke up to this point. Suddenly, her pupils constricted slightly, “How can this be possible? Your bloodline is actually being suppressed?!”

The other ten experts here immediately gazed at Yang Ye when they heard this, and their eyes were filled with disbelief!

The Yang Clan’s Mad Demon Bloodline has been suppressed?

How can that be possible?

Yang Xuan gazed at Yang Ye for a long time. Suddenly, she grabbed Yang Ye by the shoulder and vanished on the spot with him.

At the peak of a mountain.

She stared at him, “That treasure is with you, right?”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. She knows about the Primordial Pagoda? How does she know that?

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment before he said, “How did you know?”

“As expected!” She slowly closed her eyes. A long time passed before she opened her eyes and gazed at him, “Do you know why your father was exiled?”

Yang Ye shook his head in response.

She explained, “It was because of that treasure. No one knows what it is. But when it appeared in our world, it was accompanied by phenomenon of the heavens and the earth. Countless experts were alarmed by its appearance, and even our Yang Clan’s ancestor was alarmed by it. In the end, it fell into your father’s hands!”

Yang Ye asked, “And then?”

She spoke solemnly, “After that, his profound energy suddenly vanished without a trace, and he became a cripple. No matter how he cultivated, he couldn’t gather profound energy, and he couldn’t control that treasure as well. In the end, an extraordinary genius like him was reduced into a cripple.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Do you know that he was the number one genius of the Yang Clan? If nothing had happened to him all those years ago, then the Yang Clan would have been his. The other members of the Yang Clan would dare not fight him while he is present there!”

His profound energy was completely sucked away! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He knew that it was definitely the Primordial Pagoda’s doing because it was the same thing that had happened to him!

Meanwhile, Yang Xuan continued, “The Yang Clan will never allow a cripple to be its successor. Actually, he should have died, but too many people were supporting him. So, in order to avoid incurring public wrath, the clan exiled him in the name of training him.”

Yang Ye said, “That’s very normal, right? If you don’t have strength, you should give up your position. I think it’s very normal.”

“Nonsense!” Yang Xuan suddenly grabbed Yang Ye’s shirt and spoke angrily, “Do you know that the yang Clan had 25 large worlds, hundreds of medium worlds, and thousands of small words at that time. It was your father who conquered 70% of them! They belong to your father, and they belong to you. So, you must return and take back what belongs to you!”

She let go of him as she spoke, but she still glared fiercely at him.

Yang Ye shook his head, “Big Sister…”

Yang Xuan suddenly said, “You better call me auntie if you don’t want a beating!”

Yang Ye’s face twitched. He thought for a moment before he said, “Err… I think that even if that father of mine fought and helped the Yang Clan gain half of what it possesses, it had nothing to do with me. After all, it wasn’t me who did it. I…”

She suddenly said, “You don’t want to go back, right?”

Yang Ye hurriedly nodded. He really didn’t want to go back. To be honest, he had no desire for power. The Yang Clan was a huge vortex, and he didn’t want to be swept into it. Moreover, he wasn’t suited to managing a clan.

Yang Xuan laughed coldly, “How naïve!”

Yang Ye asked, “What are you trying to say?”

She spoke coldly, “Do you know how many people in the Yang Clan want your life?”

Yang Ye frowned, “Why?”

“Why?” She smiled coldly as she spoke, “Once your father was reduced to a cripple, countless people in the Yang Clan wanted him dead. But do you know why he still didn’t die after he became a cripple? Because no one dared to touch him! Those people who fought with your father had utter respect for him. It can be said that if your father wanted to rebel, they wouldn’t hesitate to follow him!”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “Some people in the Yang Clan are afraid that they’ll support me?”

“You’re not that stupid!” Yang Xuan spoke coldly, “The worlds your father conquered all those years ago have mostly fallen into the hands of his siblings. Do you think they will just return them to you? If you’re useless just like your father became, then they may not pay any attention to you. After all, no one wants to incur enmity for no reason. However, you’re not useless. You’re a genius even if you’re put in the Yang Clan. Under such circumstances, how could they possibly allow you to live?”

Yang Ye frowned. Meanwhile, Yang Xuan continued, “If I’m not wrong, some may be on the way to eliminate you.”

Yang Ye gazed at Yang Xuan, “I really don’t want to be swept into the issues of the Yang Clan.” Even though he would definitely be heading to Milky Way System because he’d promised the old man in Daoist robes that he would send Xiao Qi back there, he didn’t want to go to the Yang Clan.

He was very well aware that once he was swept into that vortex, he would never have any peace.

Yang Xuan gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then she nodded, “Fine, I won’t force you.”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned. She’s that easy to convince?

Meanwhile, Yang Xuan suddenly gazed at Snowy who was standing on Yang Ye’s shoulder. Snowy blinked when she noticed Yang Xuan looking at her, and then she hurriedly wrapped her claws around Yang Ye’s neck. Obviously, she was quite afraid of this mysterious woman before her.

Yang Xuan spoke in a low voice, “A Sprite Lord!”

Yang Ye asked, “Does Milky Way Stream have a Sprite Lord too?”

Yang Xuan looked up at the sky, “The universe is huge. In this huge universe, all sorts of civilizations have been born. All of them are different, and their methods of cultivation and cultivation systems are different. However, they all converge towards the same goal.” She gazed at Yang Ye, “Do you understand what I mean?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Just be frank.”

She raised her right hand and clenched it slowly, “Strength. Regardless of which civilization it is or what method they use to cultivate, they pursue strength! They pursue life!”

Yang Ye nodded. He naturally understood how important strength was. In this world where the strong were respected, one would be like a dog if one had no strength!

Meanwhile, Yang Xuan suddenly said, “Since you refuse to go back, then I’m leaving.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished on the spot before Yang Ye could say anything.

That was easy. Yang Ye was stunned. He hadn’t expected that auntie of his to be so easily convinced.

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he shook his head and left.

Yang Ye returned to the Sprite Palace. In the following days, Sky Sky Continent returned to calm. As for his auntie, Yang Xuan, she seemed to have left the continent. In any case, Yang Ye didn’t see a sign of her.

Three days later, two black robed experts suddenly appeared in the starry sky above Sky Sky Continent.

The black robed man on the left asked, “Is this the place?”

The black robed man on the right nodded, “Yes!”

The black robed man on the left nodded slightly, “Let’s go!”

As soon as he finished speaking, both of them vanished on the spot.

The Sprite Palace.

Yang Ye was playing with Snowy when his expression suddenly changed. A moment later, he appeared above Sprite Palace. At the same time, Little Sky appeared by his side.

There were two black robed figures standing in front of them.

Little Sky and Yang Ye had extremely solemn expressions on their faces because both the black robed figures were Zenith Realm experts.

Meanwhile, the black robed figure on the left spoke abruptly, “It really is the Mad Demon Bloodline… You’re Yang Ye, right?”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed, “You’re from the Yang Clan?”

The black robed man on the left replied with a question, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he said, “I have no desire to fight for the position of successor, and I have no intention to return to the Yang Clan. So…”

“Haha!” Meanwhile, the black robed man on the left suddenly chuckled and said, “That has nothing to do with me. All I know is that my Master ordered us to pull out weeds by the root. So, you, that younger sister of yours, and that daughter of yours… In short, everyone related to you must die!”
