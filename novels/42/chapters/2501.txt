Chapter 2502 – An Instant!

A Lord Realm inner core!

Yang Ye’s main goal was to improve his physical strength. So long as he could raise it sufficiently, he wouldn’t have to continue suppressing his cultivation.

Inner cores were perfect to improve his physical strength!

Especially powerful inner cores!

There were many occasions that he wanted to just kill the dragon. Because if he consumed its inner core, his body would definitely rise to the Four World Realm! After all, it was a true Primal True Dragon!

Of course, it was just a thought!

Besides that, there was a question that always lingered in Yang Ye’s mind. He wondered if that violent little girl, Erya, had an inner core!

He felt that he should ask her!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and walked over to the black robed figure. He pointed at the inner core and asked, “How much?”

“120 World Crystals!” replied the black robed figure. The person’s voice was hoarse, and it was obvious that the person had intentionally changed it.

120 World Crystals!

Yang Ye frowned when he heard this. It was very expensive! And he only had around 70 right now!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and asked, “Can you make it cheaper?”

The black robed figure replied indifferently, “It’s fixed!”

A fixed price!

“I’ll take it!” Suddenly, a voice came from the side.

Yang Ye looked over and saw a woman in a dress with a veil covering her face. He could only see her eyes, but just her eyes and figure alone told him that she was definitely gorgeous!

The woman walked over to the black robed figure and flicked a spatial ring over.

The black robed figure glanced at it before quickly taking it and leaving.

The inner core remained on the spot.

While inner cores were precious, and it was especially so for Lord Realm inner cores, they were only precious to demon beasts and body cultivators. They were quite useless to most people. Otherwise, it would definitely not be a mere 120 World Crystals!

Yang Ye felt that it was quite a pity. But it couldn’t be helped because he was too poor!

This time, he realized how useful money was!

Yang Ye shook his head and was about to leave when the woman spoke abruptly, “Please wait a moment.”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Huh?”

She flicked the inner core over to Yang Ye, “That’s for you!”

Yang Ye frowned, “Why?”

She replied, “How about we go somewhere else?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and nodded.

They returned to the hotel, and they sat down before a table on the first floor. Emerald hurriedly served two cups of high quality tea that was much, much better than the tea Yang Ye had previously!

The woman said, “I’m Biqing, from the Xing Clan. This hotel is under my Xing Clan.”

The Xing Clan!

The number one clan in the Eternal Kingdom!

Yang Ye drank a mouthful of tea and said, “Miss Biqing, tell me why we’re here!”

She placed the inner core on the table and said, “You’re very strong, and I want to be friends with you.”

Yang Ye glanced at her, “I’m quite surprised by how direct you are!”

She replied, “The strong respect the strong, and they want to make friends with the strong too. This inner core is a token of my good intentions. Of course, it won’t affect anything if you refuse it. You’ll still be you, and I’ll still be me. Even if we can’t be friends, we shouldn’t become enemies, right?”

Yang Ye gazed at the inner core for a long time and said, “Taking things for free isn’t my style, but refusing is even more against my style.”

He took the inner core, “Thank you, Miss Biqing.”

Xing Biqing nodded slightly and left without saying anything else.

She wanted to draw Yang Ye over to her side, but she couldn’t treat him like an ordinary expert. Sword cultivators, and especially powerful sword cultivators were extremely proud. So, being impatient with them would spoil everything instead!

It was best to become friends first then act slowly!

She was in no hurry!

Yang Ye took another gulp of tea and said, “Sword Scroll, the geniuses of the War Dimension are quite extraordinary!”

She was at the Five World Realm!

A real Five World Realm expert!

But her age was around his! The most terrifying part was the way she did things!

She had both strength and technique!

Sword Scroll asked, “Why didn’t you refuse?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Why should I?”

Sword Scroll replied indifferently, “Favors are always troublesome!”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s rare for someone to show goodwill to me, so I’m not very used to it. Anyway, it’s fine. No one in this world can avoid owing a few favors!”

Sword Scroll didn’t say anything.

Now that he’d obtained the inner core, Yang Ye returned to his room and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

In the cultivation room, Yang Ye consumed the inner core.

As soon as it entered him, a wave of extremely pure energy swept through his body!

It was extremely pure!

That was what Yang Ye felt!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s body was like a sponge that madly absorbed the energy coming from the inner core. Just like that, his muscles and bones started to shrink!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda, at the top floor of the hotel. A woman stood by the window in a huge room, and a large portion of the city could be seen from here!

She was Xing Biqing!

Elder Xing was behind her!

Xing Biqing suddenly asked, “What did you find out?”

Elder Xing replied, “His identity is suspicious.”

“Hmm?” She gazed at him, “Tell me!”

Elder Xing explained, “He’s from the Ancient Sword Sect, and he’s an inner court disciple there. Something worth mentioning is that just a few days after he joined the Ancient Sword Sect, he immediately challenged the inner court’s test and succeeded. According to the information we received from the Ancient Sword Sect, he’s an illegitimate child from a branch family in the Ye Clan. The Ye Clan has numerous branch families. As for illegitimate children… It’s impossible to investigate. Moreover, as soon as our people entered the Ye Clan’s territory, they started monitoring our people. The only way is to use even higher levels of authority to investigate him.”

“That isn’t necessary!” She replied indifferently, “There’s no need to investigate his background. Doing so will only arouse aversion in him. Especially if he really is an illegitimate child!”

Elder Xing nodded, “True. Anyway, if it’s true, then this is quite interesting. He had a bad temper, and he’s extremely decisive and ruthless. As far as I’m concerned, it may be true because only an illegitimate child would grow up in an environment capable of fostering such an extreme character!”

Xing Biqing nodded slightly, “It is quite extreme. People like him are very vengeful, and he’s a sword cultivator too. Moreover…”

She gazed at Elder Xing, “Were you able to see through him during that battle?”

Elder Xing shook his head, “I couldn’t. But he absolutely possesses the combat strength of a Five World Realm expert! Moreover, even I sensed danger when he attacked. To be honest, if we were to fight…”

She asked, “What would the outcome be?”

Elder Xing replied solemnly, “50-50!”

Equally matched!

Xing Biqing nodded slightly, “Based on his natural talent and strength, he should be famous in Eternal Kingdom, but he doesn’t have the slightest reputation. I presume he has been exercising forbearance. Why? Is it because he's afraid the Ye Clan will target him? That shouldn’t be it. Not to mention an illegitimate child, the Ye Clan would even foster someone from the worst birth if that person possesses such talent.”

She gazed at Elder Xing again, “Has Ye Zhibei taken any action?”

Elder Xing shook his head, “Not yet. But she should be watching him.”

Xing Biqing nodded slightly, “Let’s just leave it like this for now. I’m going to the west to have a look. I’ll go speak to him again once I return!”

“The west?” Elder Xing spoke solemnly, “There’s been movement there again?”

Xing Biqing nodded and vanished on the spot.

Elder Xing had a solemn expression on his face!

…

At a high building somewhere on the battlefield, a woman sat on its roof with a cucumber in her grasp, and she was frequently taking bites out of it. She was very satisfied!

She was Ye Zhibei.

Suddenly, a black clothed figure appeared behind her.

The black clothed figure spoke solemnly, “Young Miss, he didn’t join the Alliance of Independents. He went to the House of Indulgence instead. According to my investigation, Xing Biqing has spoken to him.”

Ye Zhibei bit the cucumber, chewed it, and swallowed before she said, “Has the clan not replied?”

“They have!” The black clothed figure spoke solemnly, “The Patriarch has investigated. Our clan has a total of 172 illegitimate children, and 150 of them are still alive and in the clan. However, none of them are called Ye Yang.”

She asked, “What about the other 22?”

The black clothed figure hesitated for a moment and replied, “They are dead.”𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

She asked, “How?”

The black clothed figure replied solemnly, “They died miserable deaths. They were killed by the young masters of their branch family. One of them was even cut up and fed to a dog!”

Ye Zhibei stopped what she was doing, fell silent for a moment, and said, “Sentence the person who did that to death!”

The black clothed figure hesitated for a moment and said, “Eldest Young Miss, the main clan usually doesn’t interfere in the branch families. This…”

She replied indifferently, “Are they not part of the clan?”

The black clothed figure said, “Of course. They receive protection from our main clan, they are naturally part of the clan.”

Ye Zhibei said, “Since they are part of the clan, is there a problem with me interfering in their business?”

The black clothed figure nodded, “Alright, I’ll head back and deal with it.”

Ye Zhibei stood up, “Those illegitimate children are still members of our clan. Immediately head back and open a Martial Hall just for the illegitimate children, and allow all of them to join it immediately. Kill anyone who tries to stop this from happening! Give them a path up and tell them that if they reach the requirements, I, Ye Zhibei, will allow them into the main clan to become a part of it!”

The black clothed figure nodded, “Understood! Eldest Young Miss, do you have any other orders?”

She ate the last bit of cucumber and said, “Don’t investigate Ye Yang further.”

The black clothed figure replied solemnly, “What if he’s using our clan’s name to…”

She replied indifferently, “A peak Four World Realm expert of the Leng Clan went to him earlier, and he killed that expert with a single attack.”

The black clothed figure’s expression changed drastically, “That’s impossible…”

She glanced at the black clothed figure and said, “He doesn’t need to use our Ye Clan. Based on his strength, he doesn’t have to use any power. But since he says he’s an illegitimate child of my Ye Clan, then he is one.”

She looked up into the distant sky and continued, “Even if he isn’t, we should treat him as if he is!”
