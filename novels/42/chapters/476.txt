Chapter 477 – Gone?

Right at this moment, delight suddenly flashed on Medusa’s face because her backup had arrived!

Over 200 profounders flashed over from afar and arrived here in an instant. Every single one of them was at the King Realm, at least. In just a short moment, they’d completely surrounded Young Miss Ning’s group under the command of the bald man who led their group.

Young Miss Ding’s face sank.

“Ding Shaoyao, I’ll give you one last chance. I’ll spare the lives of all your guards if you were to be obedient and come with me. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being merciless!” said Medusa in a low voice.

The woman called Ding Shaoyao glanced at the surroundings while a wisp of a resolute expression flashed through her eyes, and she said. “Everyone, I’m sure you’re all aware of the Skydevil Sect’s style. They will definitely not spare all of you even if I agree to her demands. Split up and flee from this moment onward. Your fate will depend entirely on your own fortune. Don’t worry, my promises from before are still valid even if you suffer misfortune and perish!”

When she spoke up to here, Ding Shaoyao flipped her palm, and a talisman appeared there. She shouted furiously. “Flee!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she exerted a little strength with her hand, and the talisman instantly exploded apart before she vanished on the spot!

“It’s a Random Teleportation Talisman! Dammit!” Medusa was instantly furious when she witnessed this scene, and she said, “Kill them! Don’t let a single one get away!”

Those guards recovered from their shock, and then they immediately gave up on resisting and flashed towards the surroundings. However, most of them were killed, and only less than 20 had charged out of the encirclement. But whether they could fully escape was still a problem before there was a whole group of profounders chasing after them!

“My Lord, what should we do now?” asked the bald man in a low voice.

Medusa had quite a ferocious expression on her face. Victory was right within her grasps, yet she hadn’t imagined that woman would actually possess a Random Teleportation Talisman. It was actually all because she’d been careless. After all, she could have locked down this expanse of space if she hadn’t acted carelessly, and it would cause the Random Teleportation Talisman to lose its effects. Unfortunately, she thought Ding Shaoyao intended to fight desperately to the death. How could she have imagined that Ding Shaoyao would actually give the order to flee and be the first to actually do it!?

“Don’t chase after those useless pieces of trash. Order everyone to search an area of 100km around us. Even though Ding Shaoyao is a Spirit Realm profounder, she doesn’t have any combat strength because of her physique. So, tell them that there’s no need to fear her. Of course, they shouldn’t act carelessly as well. After all, we can’t guarantee that she doesn’t have any life-saving measures in her possession!” said Medusa with a gloomy expression.

The bald man nodded, and then he glanced at Yang Ye and said, “My Lord, what about him....”

Medusa’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye. She gazed at Yang Ye for a moment before she suddenly cracked a smile and said, “Young Master, you seem very unfamiliar. I presume you aren’t from the Ocean of Anarchy?”

Yang Ye said, “I’m not interested in the enmity between the powers here, and I’m merely passing by and just happened to stumble across this incident. I presume you’re from the Ocean of Anarchy, so may I ask you how to get there?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Medusa asked. “Young Master, why are you heading to the Ocean of Anarchy?”

Yang Ye frowned. Meanwhile, Medusa suddenly said, “Just continue on forward, and you’ll be able to arrive at the Ocean of Anarchy after you pass through Still Ridge. But you have to be careful because Still Ridge is filled with numerous Darkbeast, and there’s no lack of Exalt Rank Darkbeasts amongst them. I’m afraid it’ll be difficult for you to pass through Still Ridge with the strength you possess. So, why don’t you come with us. At least we’ll be able to take care of each other on the way. What do you think?”

“There’s no need for that. I’m in a rush, so I’ll be bidding my farewells!” Yang Ye nodded a little to the two of them, and then he walked forward. This woman and the Skydevil Sect were clearly not anything good, so he didn’t want to have anything to do with them. It wasn’t that he was afraid, but he just didn’t want any trouble.

“Wait!” Right at this moment, the bald man suddenly stopped Yang Ye.

Medusa’s brows knit together a little, and she glanced at the bald man with displeasure. With the experience and knowledge she possessed, she was practically sure that while this man was at the Spirit Realm, he definitely possessed some sort of trump card or an extraordinary identity. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to stay so indifferent when facing an Exalt Realm expert.

That was exactly why she allowed Yang Ye to leave. She wasn’t afraid of him, but she didn’t want any trouble as well. In any case, she would gain nothing from killing him.

Yang Ye stopped and turned around to gaze at the bald man as he said, “What?”

The bald man took a deep glance at Yang Ye before he said to Medusa, “My Lord, do you remember that person who the Sect Master asked us to look out for? You weren’t in the sect at that time, so you didn’t see the portrait that the Sect Master had, but I did! I didn’t recall it immediately just now, but now that I’ve thought about it, I noticed that the person in the portrait is extremely similar in appearance to him. If I’m not wrong, then he’s definitely the person who the Sect Master is looking for. We can’t allow him to leave!”

Medusa said, “Are you sure?”

The bald man nodded and said, “That person in the portrait wasn’t carrying a sword chest on his back, so I wasn’t able to recognize him right away. But now it seems like besides the sword chest on his back, he’s completely similar in likeness to that person in the portrait. So, I’m sure that he’s the person who the Sect Master is looking for. The Sect Master said that if we found him, then we absolutely shouldn’t alarm him and should notify the Sect Master first. I presume that he should be extremely important to the Sect Master. So, we absolutely can’t allow him to leave!”

Medusa pondered deeply for a moment, and then she gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Young Master, I presume you heard all of that, right?”

At this moment, Yang Ye’s heart was filled with bewilderment. That bald fellow doesn’t seem to be lying, but why would the sect master of the Skydevil Sect have a portrait of me? Could it be that....

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something, and his gaze turned icy cold.

“Young Master, I presume you won’t reject coming to the Skydevil Sect with me, right?” Medusa spoke indifferently while the golden whip in her hand seemed to have come to life and was vibrating slightly. Earlier, she’d let him go because she wasn’t aware of his origins and didn’t want to cause trouble for herself. But now, she naturally couldn’t let him go since her sect master was looking for him!

“I’ll go to there, but not with you!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s figure flashed and shot explosively towards Medusa.

At this point, it was pointless to continue wasting his breath, so he’d attacked directly. He hadn’t intended to attack her before this because he really didn’t want to cause trouble for himself. After all, the most important matter at hand was to travel to the central territory. Unfortunately, she didn’t intend to let him go. Since it was like that, then he could only deal with these fellows who were blocking his path.

Medusa’s face fell when she saw Yang Ye attack her because it was simply an insult to her when a Spirit Realm profounder actually took the initiative to attack her. She stopped holding back and flicked her wrist, causing the whip in her grasp to shoot swiftly towards Yang Ye like a golden snake.

Yang Ye smashed his fist towards the whip that assaulted him.

Bang!

Medusa’s whip was instantly blasted flying, and it shocked her. Obviously, she hadn’t expected that Yang Ye’s strength would actually be so great and would actually be able to blast her whip back. Once she recovered from her shock, all Medusa felt was fury. Because the attack of a dignified Exalt Realm expert like her had actually been blasted back by a Spirit Realm profounder, and she felt that it was an utter humiliation!

“You’re courting death!” Medusa waved her hand, causing the golden whip to expand in midair and transform into an almost 300m long python, and the python shifted its body to smash down forcefully towards Yang Ye.

A combat technique! Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly. He gestured with his hand and Dragonbone appeared within his grasp, and then he grabbed it with both hands as he slashed it horizontally. In an instant, countless threads of sword qi shot forward explosively and collided with the golden python. Space immediately surged violently while countless waves of energy overlapped each other and swept towards the surroundings!

Medusa revealed undisguised shock from her eyes when she witnessed this scene. Was that an attack from a Spirit Realm profounder? It was even able to destroy my high grade Earth Rank combat technique! Fortunately, it was only sword qi that wasn’t enhanced by Sword Intent. This young man has probably not comprehended Sword Intent, otherwise....

Right at this moment, a ray of light flashed. A strand of violet sword qi had instantly arrived before Medusa, and she didn’t even hesitate to wave her hand casually and strike it with her whip.

Bang!

An explosion resounded as the sword qi dispersed while Medusa’s whip broke as well. After the sword qi dispersed, a strand of red light flashed out from there, and it didn’t slow down at all as it shot towards her. Medusa was staring blankly at her broken whip, and then her expression changed drastically when she saw that strand of red light. She shouted with astonishment. “Sword Intent! Material Sword Intent! What sort of monster are you!?”

Even though she was shocked, Medusa’s reaction wasn’t slow at all. She swiftly waved her right hand and clenched it, causing the strand of red light to be instantly frozen on the spot, and then it instantly rumbled and dispersed in midair.

Right at this moment, Medusa’s pupils constricted while coldness arose from the back of her neck. Medusa relied on the combat experience she’d honed through numerous years to swiftly stomp her right foot on the ground and vanish on the spot. However, it was still a little too late, and a bloody cut which was over 10 centimeters long had appeared on the back of her neck.

Medusa glanced at Yang Ye with astonishment. She completely disregarded the injury on her neck, tore space open, and flashed towards the distance at an extremely swift speed. She vanished from Yang Ye’s field of vision in less than a breath of time.

Yang Ye was stunned. She’s gone just like that? I haven’t even used my full strength!

A short while later, Yang Ye shook his head while he felt quite speechless. He hadn’t expected that a dignified Exalt Realm expert would actually flee from battle. However, Yang Ye noticed a problem which he faced. It was that he was really helpless against Exalt Realm experts if they were determined to flee. Just like when Medusa fled just now. All he could do was watch her flee....

I seem to have forgotten that there’s another person here!

Yang Ye turned around to gaze at the dumbstruck bald man whose eyes were filled with shock, and then he shook his head. What was it like to court death? This was exactly it! Because the bald man wouldn’t have to die if he hadn’t talked too much. Unfortunately....

A ray of light flashed, and then the head of the bald man who was a fifth rank Spirit Realm profounder flew into the air!

It was really not difficult to sweep through all profounders at the same realm of cultivation with the 8th level Slaughter Sword Intent he possessed!

Yang Ye put his sword away, and then he turned around to look towards the side before he said, “Are you still going to continue hiding there?”
