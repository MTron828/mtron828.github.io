Chapter 2323 – Instant Kills!

Chopping meat!

Wang Erya had watched Butcher chop meat, and it was just like what Yang Ye was doing this very moment. But Yang Ye wasn’t chopping any animal meat, it was human meat!

The surroundings were terrifyingly silent, and only the sound of chopping could be heard!

Bai Zhixian gazed at Yang Ye but didn’t stop him. Because she was very well aware of what awaited them if they fell into the Immortal Estate’s hands.

If he didn’t act ruthlessly against them, they would be ruthless to him!

In just a short while, Wang Yanxian had been transformed into a pile of mush.

True human mush!

The experts of the six clans were surprisingly calm before such a scene, and no one knew what they were thinking.

Yang Ye wasn’t the same Yang Ye they knew!

They didn’t know what he’d experienced in Eternal Secret Realm, but there was one thing that they were certain about, Yang Ye wasn’t the same Yang Ye they knew. Yang Ye could simply be described as unfathomable right now!

“Everyone!” Suddenly, Shiyuan Xing stepped forward, “Are you thinking of giving up?”

They gazed at him.

He laughed coldly and continued, “If we don’t eliminate him now, would we have a chance in the future? If we don't join forces now, shall we wait for him to attack and destroy us one by one? Or perhaps you think he’ll spare us?”

All of their expressions gradually turned icy cold.

Just as Shiyuan Xing said, they actually had no other choice. Either Yang Ye or they died. Because even if they begged for mercy from him, Yang Ye wouldn’t spare them.

Either Yang Ye or they had to die!

Once they thought up to this point, their hesitance vanished and was replaced by determination to kill. Practically all their experts were here, so it was the best time to kill Yang Ye.

So, when they gazed at him again, there was undisguised icy cold killing intent in their eyes.

Yang Ye stopped. A pile of mush was beneath his feet.

He walked over to Bai Zhixian while holding Invincible in his grasp!

Shiyuan Xing glanced at Bai Zhixian and said, “Patriarchs, kill Yang Ye with me. The rest of you capture Bai Zhixian.”

As soon as he gave the order, the six True Void Realm experts’ auras swept out and slammed down upon Yang Ye.

They planned to suppress him with their auras!

At the same time, all six of them followed behind their auras! How terrifying were the joint forces of six True Void Realm experts? Just their auras could make Eternal Immortal City tremble!

They didn’t hold back and clearly wanted to annihilate Yang Ye with absolute strength!

Yang Ye’ face was calm as he stood in front of Bai Zhixian. When their auras arrived around an inch away, Yang Ye suddenly grabbed Invincible with both hands and swung it.

Bang!

Their auras were instantly chopped apart, and the powerful might of his attack forced all six of them to a stop. Meanwhile, the 17 other True Dao Realm experts had charged at them!

Their target was Bai Zhixian!

Bai Zhixian’s face was calm and completely unaffected by this!

Suddenly, Yang Ye hurled Invincible at those 17 experts.

Hiss!

A ray of blood red light flashed.

The True Dao Realm expert who led the charge wasn’t able to dodge it, and he was immediately chopped into two! Meanwhile, Yang Ye had appeared in front of Invincible. He grabbed it with both hands, took a stride forward, and then slashed!

Hiss!

Another True Dao Realm expert was instantly obliterated!

He didn’t even have room to fight back!

Once he swung that attack, Yang Ye released Invincible and kicked the back of the blade with his right foot.

Hiss!

Invincible instantly tore through the air. A drastic change occurred in the expression of the True Dao Realm expert who’d just charged over to Yang Ye, and he swiftly stabbed his spear forward.

It carried his full strength because he was very well aware that he would die if he couldn’t resist this attack!

However, despair filled him at the instant his spear came into contact with Yang Ye’s saber!

Bang!

The spear exploded apart, and a ray of blood red flashed.

Hiss!

That True Dao Realm expert was instantly chopped into two, and blood accompanied by internal organs sprayed.

“Capture Bai Zhixian!” Suddenly, Shiyuan Xing howled with fury, and then he charged at Bai Zhixian with the other True Void Realm experts. Their auras completely locked down the space around the area she resided in.

Wang Erya blinked and was about to attack. However, Yang Ye suddenly appeared in front of Bai Zhixian.

Shiyuan Xing and the others’ expressions changed drastically when they saw Yang Ye, but they didn’t choose to shrink back!

They couldn’t do that at a time like this!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye slowly moved his legs toward both sides, and then he swung the saber!

Bang!

As soon as it descended, Shiyuan Xing and the others were instantly pushed backward.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that shot up into the air. It shot into the clouds, and then a strand of powerful pressure appeared throughout Eternal Immortal City.

It was absolutely destructive pressure!

The expressions of all the experts from the six clans turned extremely unsightly!

Yang Ye was actually this strong!

Suddenly, a beam of saber energy that was around 3km long descended from the clouds!

Life Isolation!

While it was more than 10 times smaller than before, its might was much greater!

It had been condensed!

After he condensed its strength, not only had it grown stronger, it was faster to execute too. Of course, that only applied to him because his strength was limited, so he had to condense it!

The expressions of everyone here changed upon catching sight of the saber energy.

The world was chopped into two!

Shiyuan Xing’s expression changed drastically. He and the other five patriarchs grouped up.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Five towering palms accompanied by powerful auras surged up into the air toward the saber energy.

Boom!

The palms were instantly obliterated while the auras vanished without a trace. The saber energy descended straight down.

All six of them were horrified. They didn’t attack again and just fled from the spot.

The saber energy struck the ground.

BOOM!

Eternal Immortal City was instantly chopped into two!

Yang Ye descended to the ground by Bai Zhixian’s side. His countenance was slightly pale as that attack had exhausted a huge amount of his strength.

Yang Ye gazed at Shiyuan Xing, and the latter’s expression changed drastically. He immediately ordered, “Retreat!”

He turned around and fled once he finished speaking.

The True Dao Realm experts of the Shiyuan Clan followed behind him!

Earlier, he didn’t have a clear understanding of Yang Ye’s strength. As far as he was concerned, no matter how heaven defying Yang Ye was, it was impossible for Yang Ye to resist so many experts after such a short amount of time in the Eternal Secret Realm. Thus, in his opinion, they had a chance to annihilate Yang Ye.

But now it seemed like he’d been dreaming!

Yang Ye wasn’t an existence that True Void Realm experts could resist!

So, he’d decisively chosen to flee!

Shiyuan Xing wasn’t the only one, the other patriarchs had immediately decided to flee as well!

However, Yang Ye didn’t choose to let the matter rest!

He hurled his saber at the closest True Dao Realm expert.

It tore through the air!

A ray of blood red saber energy flashed from behind the head of a True Dao Realm expert.

Hiss!

That True Dao Realm expert was instantly sliced into two!

But that wasn’t the end of it. Yang Ye stomped his right foot down and transformed into an afterimage that vanished into the sky.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

In an instant, shrill cries resounded incessantly through the sky, and accompanying those shrill cries were bloody heads that rained down from the sky!

The True Dao Realm!

All the True Dao Realm experts from the six clans had perished!

However, their patriarchs had escaped. If Yang Ye went after them, he could catch up to a True Void Realm expert, but he didn't. He chose to kill these True Dao Realm experts!

Because they were easy to kill!

Blood dyed the ground red.

Yang Ye descended before Bai Zhixian, and Invincible seemed even more bloody than before. Moreover, the blood in the surroundings suddenly converged to it, and the remnants of those dead experts’ souls and their resentment were absorbed by the vengeful spirits within Invincible’s handle!

So long as lives were taken in battle, Invincible and the vengeful spirits would grow stronger! Especially the vengeful spirits. The more baleful energy and resentment they absorbed, the stronger they would get!

Meanwhile, the door of light behind them trembled, and then they watched as the small Primal Demon ran out from within it.

Wang Erya ran over to the small Primal Demon and patted it on the head, “Big guy, you only arrived after the battle is over? Seriously?”

The Primal Demon felt speechless.

Suddenly, Bai Zhixian looked to the side. A woman in a linen dress and a huge sword on her back was walking slowly in their direction.

Bai Zhixian frowned slightly at the sight of her.

It was Jian You.

She’d witnessed the entire battle, and she was extremely shocked right now. Yang Ye had changed too, too much!

Bai Zhixian asked, “Who are you?”

Jian You glanced at Bai Zhixian and said, “They asked me to come here and help restore his consciousness.”

Restore his consciousness! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Bai Zhixian’s expression changed slightly, “Y-You can do that?”

Jian You glanced at Yang Ye and nodded, “I can use a secret technique to improve his sword intent to the True Dao Realm. When it temporarily attains the True Dao Realm, it may be able to suppress his madness intent. If it succeeds, his consciousness will be restored!”

Suddenly, Bai Zhixian said, “I refuse!”

Jian You gazed at Bai Zhixian, but the latter ignored her. She just took Yang Ye and Wang Erya’s hands, and then she started walking off into the distance. However, it only took a while for her to stop because Jian You had appeared before her.

Jian You asked, “Why?”

Bai Zhixian held tightly onto Yang Ye’s hand, “Move aside!”

Jian You’s eyes narrowed slightly, and she’d placed her hand on her sword’s hilt. However, Yang Ye suddenly drew his saber and swung it at Jian You.

The huge sword behind Jian You immediately shot forward!

Bang!

Saber and sword collided, and the space before them exploded apart!

However, both of them hadn’t been pushed back at all!

Bai Zhixian stared at Jian You, “Erya, if she attacks again, then kill her for me. Alright?”

Erya blinked, and then glanced at Jian You, “Alright!”

She naturally took Bai Zhixian’s side. Because her grandfather had told her to stay with Yang Ye and Bai Zhixian, and to treat them as friends!

Jian You gazed at Bai Zhixian, “Why?”

Bai Zhixian closed her eyes slowly, “I just don’t want him to leave. Don’t force my hand!”
