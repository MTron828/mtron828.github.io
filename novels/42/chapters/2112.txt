Chapter 2113 – Accompany Him in Death!

To apologize or not to apologize?

Han Xian was facing a choice, a difficult one.

Wouldn’t he be utterly humiliated if he apologized?

But what if he didn’t?

That Sage would be dead. In that way, he would be considered to have stood by idly as one of their own died. Even though the Weapon Path’s lines fought against each other, the Weapon Path had to stand united against outsiders at a time like this. Because Yang Ye was representing the Dao Path!

So, as far as Han Xian was concerned, the choice Yang Ye gave him was intentionally made to put him in a difficult situation!

Yang Ye cracked a smile and slowly pressed his sword forward. In an instant, a drop of blood appeared on the old man’s forehead and rolled down his face.

Yang Ye smiled, “Han Xian, is it a very difficult decision to make? Or perhaps you think that I dare not kill him?” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Han Xiao stared at Yang Ye, “You’ve really surprised all of us. I…”

“I’m not interested in wasting my breath on you!” Suddenly, Yang Ye shouted furiously, “Three breaths of time. If you don’t apologize by then, then I’ll chop off this Sage’s head. One, two, three…”

As soon as Yang Ye counted to three, his hand was about to move, but Han Xiao suddenly said, “Yang Ye, it was I, Han Xian…”

Hiss!

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s sword flashed by, and the old man’s head flew up into the air.

The expressions of everyone here instantly turned ferocious, and Han Xiao seemed like he’d been stuffed full of shit!

After he killed the Sage, Yang Ye looked up at the sky, “I, Yang Ye, have had too many enemies in my lifetime. So, another Weapon Path doesn’t make a difference. If you don’t like it, feel free to come look for me in the Dao Path. Anyone can challenge me at any time. However, we won’t decide on a victor, we’ll decide on who lives.”

As he spoke, he pointed his sword at Han Xiao, “Old Dog Han, are you happy now? Are all of you happy now?”

Yang Ye turned around and left.

Because of Zhong Ye, he didn’t really feel any hostility toward the Weapon Path. Unfortunately, he wasn’t facing Zhong Ye but Han Xian, Han Xian whom he had enmity with in the past. So, the situation had developed to such an extent.

Just like that, Yang Ye walked step by step and vanished from their fields of vision.

Right when Yang Ye vanished, a middle aged man appeared here. He glanced at everyone and smiled, “My little junior brother is too young and doesn’t know how to act. I hope you forgive him if he has offended you in any way.”

“Dao Ling!” Han Xian suddenly grinned, “Amazing. Congratulations, your Dao Path has gained another genius.”

The man called Dao Ling smiled and said, “Not at all. I heard he was once the Seal Master of the Slaughter Line. Oh, thank you for helping my Dao Path by pushing him away. Otherwise, if he represented the Weapon Path to visit my Dao Path, my Dao Path would have had a huge headache. Fortunately, all of you pushed him away and helped my Dao Path. I represent the Dao Path and extend my Dao Path’s gratitude to all of you. Hahaha!”

He vanished into the sky once he finished speaking.

The experts of the Weapon path had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces.

Yang Ye didn’t leave the Weapon Path immediately. He naturally couldn’t leave immediately. He was covered in injuries. Who would take responsibility if something happened to him after he left the Weapon Path now? If he stayed, the Weapon Path had to guarantee his safety. Because if something happened to him here, the Weapon Path would definitely be partially responsible at the very least.

Yang Ye went to the main peak of the Slaughter Line and walked slowly towards the hall at the back. As soon as he entered it, he fell flat on the ground.

He didn’t have any strength left in him.

He was truly exhausted!

He’d used all his strength in that battle, and not a single inch of his body was whole right now.

However, he’d gained a lot in this battle too!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, and the Primordial Violet Energy within him was madly repairing his body. As for himself, he was recalling the battle with the old man. The biggest reason why the old man had lost to him was the way he fought. He fought without any regard for his life, and the old man couldn’t endure such a way of fighting. But Yang Ye had the Sky Dragon and Primordial Violet Energy, so he could keep up with the consumption of such a battle but the old man couldn’t.

However, he’d noticed his own weaknesses too.

His combat instinct and control over energy were weaker than the old man, far weaker. The old man’s attainments were far superior. If he hadn’t fought without any regard for his life and caused the old man’s technique to be of not much use, he would have definitely lost.

Besides that, Yang Ye noticed that he had a clearer understanding of many things after this battle.

Especially the Sword Dao!

While he did cultivate the body, his Sword Dao was his core. He’d comprehended a lot in this aspect during the previous battle.

Even though he cultivated his body, the Sword Dao was his core, and he’d comprehended a lot during the battle.

Experts at the Sage Realm could use the energy of the world and even stand above it. Moreover, they could control the energy of numerous elements. But Yang Ye noticed that one’s own body was still the foundation.

No matter what energy one controlled, one had to use the body as a medium! So, at its core, cultivation was the cultivation of the body, mind, and heart.

The brain, body, and heart. Of course, there was the soul too. As for the consciousness and spirit, it was part of the brain too.

It was definitely a new discovery for Yang Ye.

In short, the battle had allowed Yang Ye to realize how much he was lacking, and he noticed that there was a lot he hadn’t understood previously.

Time trickled by, and Yang Ye’s body was almost fully healed by the Primordial Pagoda. However, Yang Ye didn’t leave. He entered the cultivation room instead.

In the cultivation room, Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground like an old monk in meditation. He was making a comprehensive summary of everything he’d comprehended. His intuition told him that if he could organize everything clearly and absorb it, his strength would undergo a qualitative transformation!

In the outside world, Han Xian arrived high above in the clouds, and an old man was seated cross-legged not too far away from him.

It was the Weapon Progenitor!

Han Xian walked over to the old man and bowed respectfully.

The Weapon Progenitor suddenly said, “You’ve made things even more complicated!”

Han Xian remained silent.

The Weapon Progenitor continued, “I know you’re unhappy because your disciple was killed in the Dao Path, and you wanted to get an eye for an eye. But you must realize who came this time.”

Han Xian spoke in a low voice, “I didn’t expect him to be that strong!”

The Weapon Progenitor said, “Yes, no one expected him to be that strong. It was really quite surprising, quite surprising indeed!”

Han Xian said, “Ancestor, did you summon me here because you’ve made a decision?”

The Weapon Progenitor nodded slightly, “My Weapon Path will be truly humiliated if he’s able to leave safely this time. Moreover, he’s hostile towards my Weapon Path now. So…”

The Weapon Progenitor frowned abruptly at this point, and he looked up into the distance, “I didn’t expected an unwelcome guest!”

Han Xian turned around, and he saw an armless man walk slowly in their direction.

Han Xian frowned and was about to speak, but the armless man suddenly gazed at him, “Fuck off.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he didn’t seem to have done anything, but Han Xian was blasted over 10km away.

Han Xian’s eyes were opened wide and filled with disbelief as he stood far away from them.

The armless man ignored Han Xian and walked over to the Weapon Progenitor. He sat before the Weapon Progenitor and said, “Yang Ye’s is one of mine!”

The Weapon Progenitor spoke indifferently, “And?”

The armless man smiled, “The young can fight as they please. If he loses and dies, it was because he lacked strength. But if the older generation schemes against him. Yes, I’m talking about you. If you scheme against him…”

A smile curled up on his face, “If you dare to scheme against him, I’ll scheme against your Weapon Path. I guarantee that besides you, everyone in the Weapon Path will die. No one will be left!”

The Weapon Progenitor grinned, “Do you have the ability to do that?”

The armless man chuckled, “You already know the answer.”

The Weapon Progenitor’s eyes narrowed slightly. He gazed at the armless man for a long time, and then he grinned, “I didn’t expect the Dean of Martial Emperor Academy to be supporting Yang Ye. This makes me quite curious. Doesn’t Martial Emperor Academy refrain from interfering in the outside world and its conflicts? What? Aren’t you afraid that Martial Emperor Academy will vanish from this world?”

The armless man spoke indifferently, “Vanish? Hah! Do you really think the Martial Emperor is dead?”

The Weapon Progenitor frowned slightly.

The armless man stood up and said, “Weapon Progenitor, let me be honest. If I didn’t have something else to do, I wouldn’t mind playing with your Weapon Path, or even all four paths. Let me say this one more time, Yang Ye can die, but he can’t die at the hands of you progenitors. If any of you act against him, then once he dies and I have nothing else to worry about…”

A smile curled up on his face, and it was quite terrifying, “Even I’m afraid of myself when I go crazy.”

He turned around and left.

However, he stopped after just taking a few steps, and he said, “Yes, you’re right. I am threatening you. That fellow with the sword is the only reason my hands are tied, and the only reason my hands are staying tied is because Yang Ye is still alive. But if he dies, everything will become meaningless to me. At that time, I’ll make this entire large universe accompany him in death.”

He roared with laughter and vanished into the sky.
