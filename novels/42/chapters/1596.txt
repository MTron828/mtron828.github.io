Chapter 1597 - The Lord Of The Heaven Dao!

Translator: InVader

Yang Ye’s expression changed as well. He hadn’t expected the Nether Judge to choose self-detonation! If an expert like the Nether Judge detonated himself, how terrifying would the explosion be?

The young boy and Qin had solemn expressions in their eyes. The boy immediately took a step forward, and then he stretched his right hand forward, “Rebirth!”

In an instant, a black vortex appeared on his right palm, and then it grew larger and larger. In an instant, it covered an area of numerous kilometers!

Explosions were resounding incessantly within the huge black vortex. At the same time, it was trembling violently as if it would explode at any moment. Just like that, this went on for a very long time. Finally, the huge black vortex exploded apart, and countless waves of violent energy swept madly towards the surroundings.

Meanwhile, Qin suddenly stretched out both her hands and spoke softly, “Void!”

In an instant, the terrifying wave of energy stopped abruptly, and then Yang Ye watched with astonishment as they were actually obliterated. The entire area instantly returned to calm!

Meanwhile, Fan Yinyu and the others had vanished.

Little Sky had an indifferent expression on her face.

She remained silent for a long time before she gazed at the boy and Qin, and then she said, “Rest well. The war may have only just begun.”

The boy nodded slightly, and then he turned around and vanished on the spot.

Qin walked over to Little Sky and spoke softly, “All of them are so strong.”

Little Sky nodded in response, “I know.”

Qin continued, “Little Sky, you have to recall how to fight as soon as possible.”

Little Sky looked up at the sky and remained silent for a long time, “All those years ago, I felt my strength was too powerful, and I would harm the myriad of living beings here if I fight. So, I sealed my ability before going into deep sleep. Now it seems like I was truly quite immature.”

“At least you realize now!” Meanwhile, Yang Ye walked over to Little Sky and said, “Little Sky, you’re innately kindhearted, and that’s not wrong. However, you must understand that just kindness is useless in this world. You don’t like to fight, but it doesn’t mean that others won’t try to hit you. Kindness is something you can hold on to, but you can’t overdo it.”

Little Sky nodded slightly. Suddenly, she looked at Yang Ye and asked, “What will you do if those women from the ten Nether Halls come next?”

Yang Ye was stunned. He hadn’t thought about such a possibility. What will I do if Blood Maiden and the others are sent next?

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then he said, “I’ll try to persuade them.” The Nether Pavilion was very strong, but Little Sky’s side wasn’t weak either. It could be said that if the Nether Pavilion insisted on invading this universe, then the final outcome would definitely be one where both sides suffer heavy losses.

Moreover, Blood Maiden and the others may be sacrificed!

That was something he didn’t want to happen!

Little Sky walked over to Yang Ye’s side and patted him on the shoulder, “I don’t want to harm your friends too. But if they want to plunder this universe, then I won’t hold back.”

She turned around and left once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye remained silent on the spot. He understood Little Sky’s temper quite well. Even though she was usually quite carefree, she was someone who was very principled. He didn’t know whether Little Sky was the Lord of the Heaven Dao, but she really cared about this world.

It could be said that Merak System was her ‘reverse scale’!

Meanwhile, Qin suddenly walked over to Yang Ye. His expression changed slightly when he saw her walk towards him. Because he felt quite uncomfortable, and it felt like he should fear her slightly.

Qin glanced at Yang Ye and asked, “You’re afraid?”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and shook his head, “You won’t harm me, right?”

Qin gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then she said, “The aura of killing you possess is very strong, and even the aura of viciousness you emanate is very strong!”

Yang Ye nodded, “It is!”

Qin remained silent for quite some time before she spoke, “Little Sky is a good person.”

Yang Ye glanced at her, “What are you trying to say?”

Qin replied, “Don’t harm her!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Do I seem like I want to?”

Qin gazed at him for a long time, and then she said, “Little Sky is willing to be friends with you, so she definitely trusts you tremendously. But… but you don’t look like a good person.”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Meanwhile, Qin continued, “Sorry, I’m a little frank. You really don’t seem like a good person.”

Yang Ye’s face was completely dark, and he felt like hitting her.

Qin spoke softly, “What I’m trying to say is that you should tell those friends of yours not to look for trouble with Little Sky. Because Little Sky is very kind, so they shouldn’t bully her. Moreover, Little Sky is very, very strong. If she recalls how to fight, then all of those friends of yours might die.”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “How strong is she?”

Qin thought for a moment and replied, “I’m not very sure. In any case, she's very, very strong.”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched slightly. Isn’t that the same as saying nothing?

Meanwhile, Qin continued, “While… while you’re quite weak, I can sense that you’re not ordinary. If… if it’s possible, help Little Sky when the time comes.”

Yang Ye replied, “You seem to be very close to her!”

“Of course!” Qin continued, “Little Sky is my best friend. If it wasn’t for her, I would be dead. I’m not the only one. She had many, many more friends. However, some of the strong ones have left this place. Otherwise, that Nether Pavilion… Hmph!”

Yang Ye asked, “She has many other strong friends?”

Qin nodded, “Of course. She has lived for extremely long, so she naturally knows a huge number of people. If they knew that she was in trouble, they would definitely come back to help her. Unfortunately, no one knows where they’ve gone.”

When she spoke up to this point, she shook her head and said, “No matter what, I’ll kill anyone who bullies her!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Qin turned around and vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye remained silent on the spot for a very long time, and then he turned around and left.

It didn’t take long for the news of Merak System being invaded to spread throughout Sky Sky Continent. So, panic swept through the continent. As for the powers of the continent, the first thought they had wasn’t to join forces against the invaders, and it was to start gathering their members and restricting them from leaving.

Fighting against the invaders?

No, as far as they were concerned, the most important thing right now was to preserve their strength. In any case, there would be others to fight against the invaders.

As for Little Sky, she had no intention to seek their help. Actually, she understood that even if she tried, they wouldn’t help. Moreover, even if they did send their forces, they may scheme against each other instead!

In short, Little Sky couldn’t rely on the clans and sects of the continent.

…

Sprite Palace.

Little Sky sat on the seat of the host while Snowy stood on her shoulder, and the other Sprite Kings were in the area below.

Little Sky glanced at the Sprite Kings and said, “Are all of you unhappy that I didn’t let you join the battle today?”

Meanwhile, Snowy suddenly clenched her claws and nodded repeatedly.

She’s wanted to fight from the beginning, but she didn’t get an order from Yang Ye or Little Sky, so she didn’t show herself. Little Sky and Yang Ye had purposefully instructed her that she should absolutely not show herself unless she received their instructions.

Snowy was very obedient towards Yang Ye and Little Sky. Actually, only Little Sky and Yang Ye were able to make Snowy listen to them.

Meanwhile, the Sprite Kings imitated Snowy and clenched their fists as well, and then they revealed unhappy expressions on their faces!

The corners of Yang Ye’s eyes twitched at the sight of this.

These Sprite Kings didn’t like to fight, but now that Little Sky had motivated them to fight, all of them wished for nothing more than to fight!

Little Sky rubbed Snowy’s head and said, “Don’t be impatient. Relax, all of you. It won’t be long before all of you will get to fight.”

Snowy hurriedly nodded while excitement filled her large eyes.

Yang Ye shook his head at the sight of this. Little Sky has really taken Snowy down the wrong path!

In the next few days, everything was very calm. However, Yang Ye knew that the Nether Pavilion would definitely not stop.

Normally, powers like the Nether Pavilion would definitely not be discouraged from just a little trouble. They’d underestimated Little Sky, yet now, they had gained an understanding of Merak System’s strength. So, if they came again, it was obvious that their forces would definitely surpass the last group in both quality and quantity.

It was even to the extent that the Pavilion Master of Nether Pavilion may come!

Yang Ye didn’t stay idle during this time.

He cultivated!

The battle with the spear-wielding man had allowed him to gain a deep understanding of how lacking he was.

Even though he had numerous treasures and dual intents, they weren’t sufficient when facing some true experts.

This time, Yang Ye got An Nanjing to spar with him. Even though they wouldn’t fight desperately against each other, they would exchange the experience and comprehension they possessed without holding back at all! So, their spars allowed both of them to obtain tremendous gains.

Three days later, Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda.

Once he left the Primordial Pagoda, he went out of Sprite Palace, and a woman covered in a strong aura of blood was standing not too far away from him.

It was Blood Maiden.

Yang Ye asked, “Has the Nether Pavilion decided to give up?”

She shook her head, “Impossible!”

Yang Ye frowned, “I can only tell you that Little Sky isn’t as simple as you’ve imagined!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Blood Maiden nodded slightly, “We’ve investigated her. I’m here to tell you to leave this world as soon as possible. I’m serious. Don’t get mixed up in this.”

Yang Ye asked, “What are you trying to say?”

Blood Maiden remained silent for a long time, and then she said, “She may be the Lord of the Heaven Dao!”

Yang Ye replied, “I know. I want to know why aren’t you giving up? Do you really intend to fight until both sides suffer heavy losses?”

Blood Maiden gazed at Yang Ye, “The Nether Pavilion may really give up if she wasn’t the Lord of the Heaven Dao. However, we will absolutely not give up now. Moreover, our Nether Pavilion isn’t the only one, there are other strong powers that intend to come to Merak System.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Blood Maiden looked him in the eyes, “Do you know what treasure is superior to a treasure that surpasses the ranks of quality?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Blood Maiden said, “The Lord of the Heaven Dao.”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
