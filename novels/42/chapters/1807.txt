Chapter 1808 – Give It Back To Me!

Yang Ye had intended to fight her on his own. Because he wanted to test his own strength. But he hadn’t expected her to summon help.

She’d actually summoned help!

Under such circumstances, Yang Ye would naturally not fight her in single combat.

A group battle!

Yang Ye had decisively chosen to gang up on her!

As soon as they heard Yang Ye, Yang Lianshuang and the others were stunned, and then they exchanged glances before attacking in unison.

A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of her mouth when she saw Yang Lianshuang and the others attack, “A bunch of ants at the 1st stage of the True Realm dare to attack me?! You’re courting death!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she waved her right hand, and a powerful wave of energy swept towards Yang Lianshuang and the others.

A black chain pierced through space and slammed against the aura.

Boom!

The aura was blasted apart.

It didn’t take long for all of them to arrive before the old woman.

As soon as they exchanged blows, the old woman’s expression changed.

It had become extremely solemn!

She’d thought that a genius like Yang Ye should be very rare. But the facts before her told her that they weren’t rare at all, and they were numerous instead. All of the women before her were existences like that!

As soon as they collided, the old woman and her mysterious beast were suppressed.

They couldn’t even fight back!

The old woman was practically incapable of fighting back against Yang Ye and the others!

She grew more and more shocked as they fought. In the end, Yang Ye and the others watched with astonishment as she actually sat on the beast and transformed into a ray of black light that vanished into the sky!

She’d fled!

All of them were stunned. They hadn’t expected her to flee!

A few breaths of time later, Yang Lianshuang said, “She was smart. She would have died if she didn’t flee!”

Even though she was at the 6th stage of the True Realm and wasn’t an ordinary 6th stage True Realm expert, all of them were capable of surmounting their realms of cultivation to do battle. Not to mention their joint forces, even just Yang Ye was enough to fight that old woman.

Meanwhile, Nether Maiden suddenly said, “We don’t have to worry too much about people like her. The people we have to truly worry about are those ancient cultivators. They can’t be judged by convention at all.”

Ancient cultivators!

The first people that came to mind were Li Taibai and the woman in a red dress. Li Taibai’s strength was obvious, and ordinary 6th stage True Realm experts were nothing before him.

As for the woman in a red dress, he’d experienced her strength. Moreover, Yang Ye wasn’t the only one, Nether Maiden and the others had experienced her strength too.

If it wasn’t for the Martial Envoy, they may have been crushed by the woman in a red dress. But the woman hadn’t even recovered her peak strength!

Meanwhile, Nether Maiden added, “Many old geezers are hidden throughout Heaven Pillar Mountain. Their only objective is to charge through the barrier above Heaven Pillar Mountain, enter the large universe, and search for an even higher system of cultivation. But the barrier there isn’t something that just anyone can get through. However, your wooden sword is capable of inflicting a huge amount of damage to the barrier there. So, they won’t give up on obtaining it!”

Yang Ye gazed at Nether Maiden, “What are you trying to say?”

Nether Maiden looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Our trip to Heaven Pillar Mountain will be very dangerous.”

Yang Ye smiled, “And?”

She replied, “I’ve been thinking about it for a long time. I think you shouldn’t go there right now. Because if you do, you’ll definitely become the center of attention there. At that time, everyone will be targeting you, and the trouble you encounter will never end.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “There are some things that are impossible to run from. If I don’t go there, they’ll use other methods to force me to show myself. For example, by targeting all of you, targeting the Yang Clan, or even targeting the Wu Clan. They’ll target everyone related to me and force me to show myself. Such circumstances would force me into a passive position instead. Since that’s the case, it’s better to just go to Heaven Pillar Mountain and seize the initiative!”

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang nodded, “Actually, you’re right. Since it’s impossible to avoid, then face it. No matter what, we’ll be by your side. We have a chance even if we go up against an ancient cultivator!”

Yang Ye glanced at her and smiled, “Needless to say, I feel very touched.” He paused for a moment and continued, “But I’ve decided to go on my own.”

The pig-riding young woman spoke with displeasure, “What? You think we’re burdens?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “That’s not what I mean. Just think about it. If all of you come with me, and those fellows from Heaven Pillar Mountain find out, then what will they do? They’ll definitely form groups as well. I’m sure you don’t want to face over a dozen 6th stage True Realm experts at the same time, right?”

Yang Lianshuang frowned slightly, “So you think we should split up?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Actually, if I’m being honest… If I’m all alone, then even five 6th stage True Realm experts won’t be able to do anything to me if I’m determined to flee. Moreover, coupled with my unique movement technique, I can even kill them instead. So, I’ve decided to split up with all of you, and we can meet up in Heaven Pillar Mountain. Of course, I’ll contact you if I need help. As for all of you, you’ll hide in the shadows and become a trump card of mine!”

He was a sword cultivator, but he could be an assassin too.

When he did become an assassin, he would be his enemies’ nightmare. Because his current speed was something that even 6th stage True Realm experts couldn’t match. But if he was within Yang Lianshuang and the others, then he couldn’t act like an assassin!

So, he’d decided to travel alone!

A long moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Lianshuang nodded, “It does make sense. However, are you really sure?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’m sure.”

Yang Lianshuang said, “Alright, then let’s split up and meet up in Heaven Pillar Mountain.”

Yang Ye glanced at them, and his gaze descended onto An Nanjing in the end, “Are you going to follow them or me?”

An Nanjing fell silent for a moment and said, “Them!”

“Why?” Yang Ye was quite surprised. He’d expected her to go with him.

She glanced at him and said, “I want to go with them and discuss the Martial Dao.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Alright, let’s meet in Heaven Pillar Mountain!”

An Nanjing nodded, “Be careful!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course!” He gazed at Nether Maiden and the others, “Everyone, I’ll see you in Heaven Pillar Mountain!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot.

A few breaths of time later, a sword howl resounded over 5,000km away.

Meanwhile, Nether Maiden said, “He doesn’t want to drag us down with him!”

All of them nodded.

Even though they could surmount their realms of cultivation to do battle, it still wasn’t enough to face those old existences from Heaven Pillar Mountain. If Yang Ye stayed with them, it was obvious that they would become the focus of attention with Yang Ye.

At that time, countless experts would be targeting them.

But their current strengths were absolutely incapable of enduring being targeted by those experts. Not to mention that there were ancient cultivators targeting Yang Ye as well!

The pig-riding young woman asked, “Will he be alright?”

An Nanjing shook her head, “He’s very tenacious!”

Yang Lianshuang nodded, “I think so too!”

Nether Maiden nodded slightly, “Let’s go. We’ll wait for him in Heaven Pillar Mountain!”

As soon as she finished speaking, all of them vanished on the spot.

…

After they split up, Yang Ye shot forward on his sword. He didn’t conceal himself because he wanted the world to know that he was all alone. Or to be more precise, he wanted everyone from Heaven Pillar Mountain to focus on him and not target Nether Maiden’s group.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to stop because an old man holding a short saber appeared before him.

Yang Ye asked, “Heaven Pillar Mountain?”

The old man nodded, “The wooden sword….”

“Wooden sword my ass!” Yang Ye suddenly interrupted the old man, and then he appeared in front of the old man while a speck of cold light appeared just a few inches away from the old man’s forehead.

The old man’s pupils constricted slightly. Obviously, he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to attack right away, and he hadn’t imagined that Yang Ye’s attack would be so swift! Luckily, while Yang Ye’s attack was swift, it wasn’t so swift to the point that he couldn’t react against it.

Right when the sword was about to pierce through the old man’s forehead, Yang Ye felt a wave of powerful force come from the Sword Precursor.

Clang!

Along with a clear and resounding clang, Yang Ye was blasted backwards repeatedly. At the same time, his expression changed because a saber had arrived just half an inch before his forehead!

Yang Ye didn’t have the time to think. He forcefully moved his body to the side and made it shoot by his face. Meanwhile, his sword swept horizontally. However, it missed.

At this moment, the old man was 300m away from him!

The old man sized up Yang Ye and said, “Your combat instinct and reaction aren’t bad!”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “You’re not bad yourself!”

They exchanged glances, and then they simultaneously vanished on the spot.

Boom!

A rumbling explosion resounded, and then the entire area started trembling violently. Numerous rays of saber energy and sword energy flashed and tore the space here into pieces!

Around ten minutes later, Yang Ye and the old man stopped abruptly.

A ferocious smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth as he twisted his wrist. He was just about to attack when the space behind the old man suddenly trembled, and then two extremely powerful auras appeared here. It didn’t take long for two old men to arrive here.

6th stage True Realm experts!

They exchanged glances, and then they gazed at Yang Ye.

Suddenly, Yang Ye pointed his sword at the saber-wielding old man and spoke with fury, “Give me back the wooden sword or I won’t stop until I kill you!”

The saber-wielding old man was stunned speechless.
