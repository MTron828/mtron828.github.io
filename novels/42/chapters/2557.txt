Chapter 2558

Leave!

Yang Ye was quite excited because if he could take her with him, then the Soul Sect would be trash!

It would take a single swing of her palm!

She was an extraordinary source of backing!

Meanwhile, the young girl was tempted by Yang Ye’s suggestion as well.

However, a voice came from not too far behind her, “No!”

Yang Ye looked up into the darkness, and he saw an old man walking out slowly from there. The old man went over to the young girl and bowed slightly, “Master, if you leave, the world outside won’t be able to endure your presence. You know that well!”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye hurriedly said, “I-I have a world in me, the Primordial Pagoda!”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye, “It’s just a mid-level world, and the world outside is a high-level world. Even a high-level world cannot endure my Master, let alone that mid-level world of yours!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Meanwhile, the young girl spoke abruptly, “Can I suppress my cultivation?”

Yang Ye blinked, “You can!”

The old man was stunned. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

She nodded slightly, “It shouldn’t be a problem!”

She gazed at the old man as she spoke.

The old man shook his head slightly, “It’s too dangerous!”

Dangerous!

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. Yang Ye wondered if he meant that it would be dangerous for her, or if she would be a danger for the outside world!

She shrugged, “I’ve been here for far too long. I’m really bored!”

The old man bowed slightly, “Master, you’ve endured it here for so long. Is this short amount of time really worth it?”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Senior, I’ll take good care of her out there. I…”

“Take care of her?” Meanwhile, a powerful aura enveloped Yang Ye, “How will you do that? You can’t even take care of yourself. Besides that, don’t think I don’t know what you’re planning. Do you know what will happen if Master heads outside? You don’t!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

Meanwhile, the young girl spoke abruptly, “I guarantee that I won’t fight, alright?”

The old man wanted to say more, but the other old man suddenly stepped forward, “Sha Ji, just let our Master go outside for a stroll.”

Yang Ye gazed at the old men. Both of them wore black robes, and he couldn’t differentiate them at all.

The old man called Sha Ji gazed at the other black robed man, “Cang Mu, don’t you know what the consequences are? Master will…”

Cang Mu shook his head slightly, “Master just has to avoid fighting. She’s been with us old geezers for countless years, and she has truly suffered. So, let her go have a look at the outside world. Moreover, there are countless experts in this era and in this universe, so going to have a look at them isn’t a bad thing!”

Sha Ji wanted to say more, but the young girl had already started suppressing her cultivation.

It took her an entire two hours!

She was constantly growing weaker!

She finally stopped when the old men nodded!

Yang Ye was utterly flabbergasted!

It had taken this long just to suppress her cultivation!

So, what was her cultivation?

Once her cultivation was suppressed, she gazed at Yang Ye and pointed at his body, “Shall I go inside?”

She didn’t wait for Yang Ye to answer her and just entered the Primordial Pagoda.

As soon as she went inside, Yang Ye staggered for a moment and almost fell to the ground.

Yang Ye was shocked. At that instant, he felt like he’d suffered a heavy blow, and a wave of heaviness surged through him.

It was because of the young girl!

Yang Ye gazed at the two old men, and they were looking at him too.

Meanwhile, Cang Mu suddenly said, “She’s just going out to have some fun. Understand?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand!”

Cang Mu added, “If you make her fight outside, your enemies will die, but you will die too.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Cang Mu shook his head, “There are many things I cannot explain to you. You just have to know that you should never let her fight unless there’s no other way. It’s for her own good, and yours!”

Yang Ye glanced at the old man and nodded.

Yang Ye didn’t leave immediately, and he advanced to the Five World Realm before leaving.

When he was about to leave, the old men appeared before him again.

Cang Mu pointed above them, “See those Divine Treasures?”

Yang Ye hurriedly nodded while feeling inwardly overjoyed. Are they going to give them to me?

Meanwhile, Cang Mu poured a bucket of cold water on him with these words, “Once she’s had enough fun, all of them will be yours once you bring her back! You can’t have them yet, understand?”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Just like that, Yang Ye left while feeling disgruntled.

He’d thought that he was taking a powerful expert with him, and she could be his guardian. But now it seemed like she may not be his guardian but his bane instead!

She couldn’t help him in battle!

If she did, he would die!

What the heck was that?!

At the bottom of the abyss.

The two old men watched Yang Ye leave in silence, and a long time passed before Sha Ji suddenly asked, “Why?”

Cang Mu spoke softly, “Did you see that sword cultivator from the other day?”

Sha Ji fell silent.

Cang Mu continued, “This era isn’t our era anymore, and it doesn’t belong to Master either. But we can’t underestimate this era either. It isn’t a bad thing to let her come into contact with this era. Moreover, even if that kid is weak and doesn’t have the right to fight for the right to enter that door in the future, don’t forget that he has the Sprite Progenitor and Evil Progenitor with him. It isn’t bad for our Master to get to know them!”

Sha Ji shook his head slightly, “I’m afraid that while it isn’t a bad thing, it may not be a good thing either!”

Cang Mu fell silent.

Along with the departure of their master, the abyss fell deathly silent.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

The young girl curiously sized up the surroundings, and it didn’t take long for her to arrive at the Primal True Dragon’s territory. The dragon was lying there, and it opened its eyes and glanced at her upon noticing someone entering its territory.

She glanced at the dragon and asked, “Are you a dragon?”

The Primal True Dragon was stunned speechless.

She walked over to it, sized it up slowly, and then shook her head, “What a weak dragon, and such a weak bloodline. You’re far, far too inferior when compared to that dragon from all those years ago!”

The dragon was furious!

It was an insult!

A wave of powerful Dragon Pressure swept out from the dragon and pressed down upon her!

The dragon hadn’t tried to kill her. While it didn’t know why she was here, it knew that since she was here, that represented that she knew Yang Ye. So, it had “held back”.

The young girl didn’t try to get away from it and just allowed the pressure to descend upon her. Or to be more precise, it just vanished upon arriving around her.

It vanished completely.

The dragon was stunned by this scene.

She shook her head and left.

Once she left the dragon’s territory, she went over to the Chaotic Fruit Tree. She was quite curious as she gazed at the tree, “Your fruits are barely passable.”

She waved her right hand, and one of the fruits on the tree flew into her grasp. After that, she took a bite…

At this moment, the tree was furious!

Even Yang Ye didn’t dare to just take its fruits!

A wave of powerful energy rippled out from the tree, and its target was the young girl.

She took another bite from the fruit, glanced indifferently at the tree, and then just allowed the energy to slam against her.

A breath of time later, she was still standing there eating the fruit.

The tree trembled for quite some time before gradually calming down.

She took another fruit and left.

The tree didn’t dare to make a single sound.

Once she left the Chaotic Fruit Tree, she went to the Worldborn Fruit Tree. Her gaze descended upon its fruits, and it didn’t take long for her to finish eating the Chaotic Fruits. She was about to pluck a Worldborn Fruit when one of them suddenly left the tree and floated over to her.

She just took it as if it was a matter of course and started eating. It didn’t take long for her to finish it. Meanwhile, another fruit floated over to her.

She took the fruit, glanced at the tree, and then waved her right hand. A strand of mysterious energy enveloped the tree!

It formed an independent pocket of space!

A world of its own!

At this moment, the Worldborn Fruit was trembling!

Because at this moment, it wasn’t restrained by the Three Dimensional Universe anymore. While it hadn’t transcended the scope of the Three Dimensional Universe, it wasn’t restrained by the laws of the Three Dimensional Universe. It could grow freely without any upper limit!

It was overjoyed!

It could be said that once Snowy returned and nurtured it well, it would transcend its limits and become an existence comparable to Super Divine Treasures.

It was something that countless living beings dreamed of!

The facts proved that knowing how to act as a tree was important!

She’d taken two of its fruits, and it had given them to her in such a sensible manner. So, she felt that she had to do something in return!

She left while eating the second fruit, and it didn’t take long for her to arrive near the pool of lightning.

A young girl was lying there. It was Lei Lin.

Lei Lin was nibbling on a ball of Lightning Essence!

Lei Lin glanced at the young girl, and then she pointed at the Lightning Essence and spoke in a melodious voice, “Want some?”

The young girl glanced at Lei Lin and shook her head.

She hesitated for a moment and raised the fruit in her grasp toward Lei Lin, “Want some?”

Lei Lin shook her head, and then she went over to the young girl and asked curiously, “What’s your name?”

What’s my name?

The young girl thought for quite some time and replied, “Qi…”

Lei Lin blinked, “Qi?”

The young girl frowned and thought for a long time before she said, “Qi Bitian. The Three Dimensional Universe’s heavens has nine levels, and I’m one level higher than that.”

Qi Bitian!
