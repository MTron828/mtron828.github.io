Chapter 2206 – Let’s Die Together!

Yang Ye’s words were undoubtedly like a spear that stabbed into their hearts. The annihilation of the god race was a thorn in their hearts which could never be removed.

Including Zhi’er, her face had instantly turned cold when she heard him.

However, they didn’t know how Yang Ye felt right now.

Yang Ye suddenly released his right grip, and his sword shot forward like a bolt of lightning.

Zhi’er’s expression changed drastically from the sight of this. Suddenly, a middle aged man appeared in front of her, and he stretched his right hand forward.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s blood red sword was blasted back to him.

It was the patriarch of the god race, Shi Tian!

Shi Tian glanced indifferently at Yang Ye, “Annihilate my god race? Who do you think you are?”

Yang Ye grinned, “Then let’s give it a try!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s sword trembled, and as it trembled, strands of monstrous slaughter intent surged out from him. In an instant, the entire sky above the God Realm was turned blood red.

Slaughter intent!

Boundless slaughter intent filled the surroundings!

Progenitor Realm slaughter intent? Shi Tian frowned.

Suddenly, Yang Ye took a step forward, and a mysterious wave of energy instantly enveloped the city.

The Sword Domain!

The slaughter intent grew even more terrifying beneath his Sword Domain.

“Shatter!” Meanwhile, Yang Ye took a step forward.

Bang!

Shi Tian and the others watched as the city exploded apart. An instant later, countless rays of sword energy rained down like a storm.

“How dare you!” Shi Tian roared with fury and slammed his right hand forward.

The sword energy Yang Ye emanated was instantly obliterated while Yang Ye’s Sword Domain shattered.

That was how powerful a single punch of his was!

Yang Ye didn’t attack the city again and gazed at Shi Tian instead. Obviously, if he wanted to annihilate the god race, he had to deal with Shi Tian first!

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath and just transformed into a bolt of lightning that shot at Shi Tian. Just a moment later, he was in front of Shi Tian. A wisp of disdain flashed through the latter’s eyes as he slammed his fist forward again!

However, a small golden pagoda suddenly appeared above Yang Ye.

A moment later, it transformed into a ray of golden light that entered Yang Ye’s body. In an instant, a faint layer of golden light surrounded Yang Ye, and even his blood red sword was covered in a layer of faint golden light.

Shi Tian’s expression changed when he sensed this!

Bang!

The others watched as Yang Ye’s sword descended.

Bang!

Shi Tian was blasted over 30km away, and space was torn open in his wake.

It was extremely shocking!

Zhi’er and the others’ expressions changed drastically from the sight of this!

As far as they were concerned, no matter how monstrous Yang Ye was, he couldn’t compare to Shi Tian. When Shi Tian reigned supreme over the world all those years ago, even Yang Ye’s ancestors may have not been born. However, they hadn’t expected him to be so strong!

If Shi Tian couldn’t defeat Yang Ye… Just thinking about it made their expressions grow even more unsightly.

Everyone in the large universe knew about Yang Ye’s temper!

He was a madman who was capable of anything!

After he pushed Shi Tian back, Yang Ye didn’t stop. He grabbed his blood red sword with both hands and stabbed it into the ground.

Bang!

In an instant, a terrifying wave of energy surged into the ground, and it spread toward the surroundings. In just a short while, the ground beneath the city collapsed. Countless members of the god race were horrified and fled to the surroundings!

Zhi’er clenched her fists when she witnessed this.

Yang Ye was serious!

He really planned to take the god race down with him!

“You’re courting death!” Shi Tian howled with fury and charged at Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, the small pagoda appeared above Yang Ye again. An instant later, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that slammed against Shi Tian.

A head on collision!

Bang!

As soon as they collided, an explosion resounded, and the space around them collapsed and it spread swiftly to the surroundings. In just a short while, the entire God Realm was in pieces.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye gazed at the Sages of the god race, and then he flicked his sword, causing it to instantly vanish.

The Sages were horrified by the sight of this!

Yang Ye planned to annihilate them first!

Shi Tian naturally realized that too. So, the blood red sword hadn’t even arrived in front of the Sages before Shi Tian stopped it.

Shi Tian stopped it with his right hand. Even Shi Tian didn’t dare to underestimate the force carried within the sword.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly appeared in front of him while the Primordial Pagoda floated above his head.

Yang Ye grabbed the blood red sword and twisted it.

Bang!

Yang Ye relied on the Primordial Pagoda to blast Shi Tian over 30m away. But he didn’t attack Shi Tian again, he just turned around and swung his sword.

Hiss!

It instantly annihilated one of the nearby Sages!

However, when Yang Ye was about to launch another attack, a terrifying aura swept over, so Yang Ye turned around and swung his sword.

Bang!

As soon as his sword descended, Yang Ye felt a wave of powerful energy enter his body. So he immediately used the Primordial Armor, but he was still blasted over 30km away!

As soon as he stopped himself, the space below him cracked open.

Meanwhile, Shi Tian started walking slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, “I underestimated you, but…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared behind Shi Tian!

Backstab!

The Sword Domain combined with Backstab!

It was swift to the limit, and with the enhancement provided by the Primordial Pagoda, it was unprecedentedly strong too.

However, Shi Tian’s reaction was extremely quick. He’d turned around as soon as Yang Ye appeared behind him, and he slammed his fist forward. A black glove soundlessly appeared on his fist, and a wave of powerful force rippled forth from his fist, causing space in a huge area to crack open.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword descended.

Bang!

As soon as they came into contact, a terrifying wave of energy erupted from the point of collision. Both Yang Ye and Shi Tian were blasted backward.

Bang!

As soon as he stopped himself, a ferocious expression flashed on his face, and then he grabbed his sword with both hands and stabbed it into the ground. He took a step forward, and the Sword Domain appeared. At the same time, a dense expanse of blood red sword energy appeared around him. They formed a dense rainstorm that shot toward the surroundings.

At this moment, it was like a meteor shower was raining down on the God Realm!

“How dare you!” Shi Tian roared with anger, and he emanated a terrifying aura as he charged at Yang Ye.

Suddenly, the golden pagoda above Yang Ye transformed into a ray of golden light that slammed against Shi Tian.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded and Shi Tian was blasted away. However, the Primordial Pagoda was blasted back to Yang Ye as well. At the same time, Yang Ye’s countenance turned extremely pale!

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he grabbed the Primordial Pagoda and slammed it forward.

Bang!

The remains of the city were smashed into an expanse of ruins, and countless experts of the god race were obliterated.

“You’re courting death!” Ferocity instantly covered Shi Tian’s face.

Suddenly, Yang Ye started walking slowly in Shi Tian’s direction, “I’m courting death? Who the fuck do you think you are? Everyone from the god race, hear me now! If I don’t see Snowy, I’ll kill all of you! All of you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stomped his right foot down and charged at Shi Tian.

In his grasp was the blood red sword, and the Primordial Pagoda was above him! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Meanwhile, an old man and a middle aged man were watching from afar.

It was Heaven Secret and Zhong Ye!

“I really pity him!” Heaven Secret shook his head, “He just re-emerged into the world, yet he encountered such a madman.”

Zhong Ye spoke softly, “Yang Ye is actually so strong now!”

Heaven Secret shook his head, “It’s not Yang Ye who’s strong, it’s Shi Tian who has grown weak. He was just revived, so his strength hasn’t recovered to its peak. But Yang Ye is at his peak. Moreover, that kid doesn’t just have the Primordial Pagoda, he has the Primordial Pagoda and the Sword Domain. So, even if he can’t kill an injured progenitor right now, a progenitor can’t do anything to him either.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “But that fellow doesn’t just possess the strength of a progenitor, the most terrifying part is that he’s such a madman! Have you noticed? He came here to take the god race down with him! Truly take them down with him! He’s able to ignore everything, but the god race can’t afford to do the same, no one can afford to do the same. The Buddhist Progenitor and Weapon Progenitor’s current attitude toward Yang Ye is one where they want to avoid offending him if possible. But Shi Tian offended him!”

Zhong Ye suddenly asked, “Will Shi Tian make a compromise?”

The old man looked up and asked, “What do you think?”

Bang!

Suddenly, Shi Tian was blasted away, and Yang Ye charged at him.

Meanwhile, Shi Tian said, “Yang Ye, do you want me to annihilate everyone in Void Spirit Continent right now?!”

Yang Ye stopped.

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and gazed at Shi Tian, he raised his sword slowly at Shi Tian and said, “Go! Go if you dare!”

Shi Tian’s eyes instantly narrowed while slaughter intent surged in his eyes.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye started walking slowly in Shi Tian’s direction, “Nothing ever goes perfectly in the world. I, Yang Ye, would rather die than succumb to threats. If worse comes to worse, you die, I die, and everyone dies! I’m not afraid of you!”
