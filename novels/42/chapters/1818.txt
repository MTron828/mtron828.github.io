Chapter 1819 – The Battle Begins!

A bloodbath!

Ye Ning’s face turned gloomy when he heard Yang Ye. He gazed at Yang Ye for a short while before he nodded, “Since that’s your decision, then die!”

He immediately vanished on the spot.

A moment later, he was in the sky, and then he tapped his finger down in Yang Ye’s direction.

In an instant, a huge vortex appeared above Yang Ye, and then an enormous finger that was over 300m long emanated boundless pressure as it flashed out from the vortex.

The powerful energy contained within it caused the ground to crack apart and collapse. At the same time, the entire city started to tremble as if it couldn’t endure the might of the finger.

It was extremely shocking!

Yang Ye tightened his grip on the wooden sword, and then he slowly closed his eyes. In an instant, two terrifying waves of intent swept out from him, and they surged into the wooden sword.

A sword howl shot up into the sky.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye tapped his right foot down.

Bang!

The space beneath his foot shook while Yang Ye’s figure transformed into a ray of light that shot towards the enormous finger.

Everywhere he passed, space was sliced open like paper!

Just like that, the sword energy stabbed against the tip of the finger!

Bang!

In an instant, an explosion reverberated like a thunderclap!

The wooden sword and the enormous finger shook violently, and then Yang Ye was slammed down!

A wisp of viciousness flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, and he grabbed the wooden sword in both hands before twisting it!

Hiss!

His figure shot forward with his sword and pierced through the finger.

Bang!

The finger exploded apart while sword energy shot up into the sky.

In an instant, Yang Ye had arrived before Ye Ning, and the terrifying energy contained within his sword caused the space around Ye Ning to crack open.

Ye Ning gazed coldly at Yang Ye. When Yang Ye’s sword was just around 3m away from him, he suddenly raised his hand and waved it lightly.

Hiss!

A ray of ghastly cold light flashed.

Bang!

An explosion resounded and Yang Ye was blasted over 1km away.

Once he stopped himself, Yang Ye looked down at his trembling hand, and then he looked back up at Ye Ning. There was a slightly solemn expression in his eyes.

Strong!

The old man before him was an existence that ordinary 6th stage True Realm experts couldn’t compare to at all.

Meanwhile, Ye Ning glanced at Yang Ye and said, “You really are a monstrous genius, and you have some ability. I may really not be a match for you once you grow further, yet now, I can fight numerous people like you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took a step forward and raised his right hand. A moment later, he pressed it down.

The space above Yang Ye suddenly started to shrink along with the descent of Ye Ning’s palm, and then it started to press down upon Yang Ye like a mountain.

Yang Ye flipped his right wrist and a ray of light shot up into the air. At the same time, he transformed into a ray of light that shot upwards.

Brute force!

Rumble!

Rumbling resounded, and then the space above Yang Ye collapsed. Countless waves of energy erupted towards the surroundings, and it instantly made a mess of the sky.

Around 30 breaths of time later, the sky gradually returned to calm.

At this moment, Yang Ye and Ye Ning were over 1.5km away. Both of them were covered in injuries. Yang Ye’s injuries were comparatively serious. His shirt had vanished, and his entire upper body had cracked open!

However, Yang Ye’s face was extremely calm. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Because at this moment, he was in the Hegemon Body state, so he couldn’t sense anything throughout his body. Moreover, the Primordial Violet Energy within him was still ceaselessly repairing his body. So, while he was covered in injuries, they weren’t a huge problem to Yang Ye.

Ye Ning’s body had around a dozen injuries. All of them were very close to lethal points on Ye Ning’s body. Especially the cut on his throat. If he hadn’t dodged quickly, it would have slit his throat open.

Ye Ning gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he said, “A formidable body, sharp sword energy, and an abnormal recovery…. Needless to say, you’ve truly surprised me. If you were at the 4th stage of the True Realm, I wouldn’t be a match for you. Unfortunately, you’re only at the 2nd stage!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he shot up into the sky, overlapped his palms, and slapped them down in Yang Ye’s direction.

Bang!

The space above Yang Ye started to ripple. Waves of powerful energy slammed down like mountains in Yang Ye’s direction. At the same time, a huge black palm suddenly emerged from that expanse of space, and then it slammed down in Yang Ye’s direction!

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he held the wooden sword tightly with both hands. His profound energy surged into it while his two intents swept out and surged into the sword as well.

Meanwhile, he stomped his right foot down and soared up into the air.

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that shot up into the sky. Everywhere he passed, space was completely minced apart, and the powerful sword intent he emanated made countless spectators look away!

It was sharp!

At this moment, everyone in the city sensed a wave of sharp sword energy!

It seemed to intend to pierce through the world!

The powerful sword energy instantly obliterated the aura emanated by the palm, and then Yang Ye stabbed the palm.

Boom!

They collided in midair and an explosion rumbled like a thunderclap.

Boom!

The huge palm shook violently, and then it exploded apart. It transformed into countless fragments that rained down from the sky while Yang Ye was blasted to the ground by the energy from the explosion!

Blood Maiden and Blind Maiden, who were in battle with the experts from the Night Assassins organization, frowned when they noticed this.

They were worried!

They weren’t the only ones, Yang Lianshuang and the others were quite worried too.

Suddenly, a figure shot out from the ground.

It was Yang Ye!

Yang Lianshuang and the others heaved sighs of relief when they saw him.

Ye Ning’s expression became extremely unsightly when he saw Yang Ye emerge from the ground.

He’d thought that attack of his would have been able to heavily injure Yang Ye even if it couldn’t kill Yang Ye. But now it seemed like Yang Ye hadn’t been heavily injured at all.

Defense! Recovery!

The reason Yang Ye could fight him was mainly Yang Ye’s defense and recovery. Even though Yang Ye was just a 2nd stage True Realm expert, his physical defenses were something that even Ye Ning found difficult to pierce! Moreover, Yang Ye didn’t just possess formidable physical defenses, his recovery was even more terrifying!

Yang Ye was an opponent who was very difficult to defeat!

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and looked up at Ye Ning, “Come! Let’s continue!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

Split Second!

Actually, it wasn’t a huge threat to 6th stage True Realm experts. However, that was under normal circumstances. It wasn’t normal circumstances right now. He wasn’t just using his Enlightened Rank intents, he was using the wooden sword and Wargod’s arm.

Under such circumstances, Split Second’s strength could be described as having reached a completely new height. That was also why it could pose a threat to 6th stage True Realm experts!

At the moment Yang Ye’s figure vanished, Ye Ning’s expression changed, and he slapped his palm forward.

Yang Ye’s sword arrived just as his palm shot forward!

Boom!

The light dispersed and Yang Ye was blasted over 1km away. As for Ye Ning, he was blasted around 300m back by the force within Yang Ye’s attack.

Ye Ning glanced at his palm. There was a blood hole in it.

A moment of silence ensued, and then Ye Ning looked up at the wooden sword in Yang Ye’s grasp, “As expected of a divine treasure from the large universe. It’s so strong.”

He flipped his right palm once he finished speaking, and a pitch black iron rod appeared there.

At this point in the battle, he noticed that he had to use a weapon. Because his body couldn’t endure the attacks from Yang Ye’s wooden sword. If he continued to fight Yang Ye barehanded, then he may be exhausted to death!

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath. He just swallowed two Energy Pearls before shooting forward in a flash of light.

A battle of attrition!

He was actually fighting a battle of attrition. Because he couldn’t kill the old man in an instant. Even if he used the Grand Teleportation Technique, he still wasn’t confident in his ability to do so. Most importantly, if he used the Grand Teleportation Technique now, then it meant he would be rendered incapable of fighting anymore.

Based on the state he was in right now, forcefully utilizing the Grand Teleportation Technique would cause him to lose the ability to fight. At that time, even a Rebirth Realm expert could kill him with ease!

So, it wasn’t that he wanted to fight a battle of attrition, he had no other choice!

Presently, it just depended on which one of them could last longer!

Just like that, they entered into a fierce battle again.

They weren’t the only ones. Blood Maiden and the others were in fierce battle with the members of Night Assassins as well. This time, they weren’t able to gain the upper hand, but they weren’t suppressed as well. They could only be said to be fighting on equal ground!

However, anyone with a discerning gaze could notice that if the battle dragged out, then Blood Maiden’s side had a better chance at victory. Because the battle seemed much easier for them.

Boom!

Suddenly, a huge teleportation formation appeared in the sky, and then numerous powerful auras emerged.

Yang Ye’s expression instantly darkened when he witnessed this.
