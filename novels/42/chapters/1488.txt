Chapter 1489 - I’ll Beat You Until You’re Crippled!

Translator: InVader

The Semi-Deity Realm!

If he attained the Semi-Deity Realm, then his lifespan problem would be resolved. Moreover, his strength would improve tremendously.

While he knew that there would definitely be disadvantages from forcefully advancing with the help of external forces and especially when he’d just advanced to the Voider Realm, he had no other choice.

Whether he could leave this place and whether the Spring of Life existed in the Forest of Darkness was still unknown.

So, he had no choice but to charge into the Semi-Deity Realm.

The potential issues created by this could be gradually resolved over time. After all, he had Primordial Violet Energy, so he wasn’t really worried about it. At the very most, it would just take some time.

The reason he’d entered the Primordial Pagoda to charge into the Semi-Deity Realm was that he was afraid his advancement would cause a commotion in the outside world. It would definitely cause quite a commotion when he advanced. If that commotion drew the attention of a powerful demon beast or human, then his actions would be no different than courting death. Moreover, it would take less time within the Primordial Pagoda.

After all, a single day in the Primordial Pagoda was equivalent to ten days in the outside world.

There was one other benefit, and it was that the Eye of the Heaven Dao wouldn’t appear if he advanced within the Primordial Pagoda. If he was in the outside world, a heavenly tribulation would definitely descend once he advanced.

In the 3rd level, Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground. Once the Fire Spirit Fruit entered his body, a wave of pure fire element energy instantly surged through his body like a tidal wave.

The energy wasn’t just pure and powerful, it was extremely hot as well. Fortunately, his internal organs and meridians could endure it. Because he was at the Undying Realm now!

Time trickled by. The aura Yang Ye emanated grew stronger and stronger. Moreover, his body emanated faint flames.

Xiao Yuxi had stopped cultivating. She sat slightly ahead of him, and her gaze had a trace of worry in it as she looked at him.

She naturally knew about the state Yang Ye was in. This breakthrough was of utmost importance to Yang Ye. It would be great if he succeeded, but if he failed, then Yang Ye would be in an extremely bad situation.

This time, Yang Ye might die if he failed!

Yang Ye’s aura was growing stronger and stronger.

A day later.

Boom!

A terrifying wave of energy erupted from him, but it didn’t take long for the energy to vanish into thin air.

Xiao Yuxi immediately stood up, and then she stared at him without blinking.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to open his eyes.

Xiao Yuxi hurriedly asked, “Did you succeed?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Just a little bit more, just a little bit!”

Xiao Yuxi’s face dimmed down, and then she cracked a smile, “It’s fine, we still have a chance!”

“Of course we do!” Yang Ye smiled, and then he closed his eyes. After that, the tiny vortex within him started spinning madly, and then countless strands of Primordial Violet Energy instantly surged out from the tiny vortex!

Yang Ye would naturally not give up just like that!

Even if he was going to give up, he would do it when he had no other choice. As for now, so long as he had the ability, he intended to fight to the end!

As Primordial Violet Energy appeared within him, the aura he emanated grew even stronger than before. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

In the 1st level of the Primordial Pagoda, Little Sky who was traveling through the world in the 1st level had suddenly stopped. She shot a glance upward and spoke softly, “It seems like someone is advancing!”

Big Blackie and Little Blackie were by her side, and they just glanced at her and remained silent.

After Yang Ye entered the Ominous Territory’s forbidden area, they could be considered to have lost the ability to help Yang Ye. So, Little Sky had dragged them around the place instead. They naturally had no complaints about that.

Little Sky looked up at the sky and remained silent for a long time. After that, she withdrew her gaze and spoke softly, “It’s definitely that fellow again. If he advances here, there won’t be a heavenly tribulation… Isn’t that equivalent to cheating?” As she spoke, she gazed at Big Blackie and said, “Big Blackie, don’t advance here when you’re breaking through in the future. Understand?”

Big Blackie gazed at Little Sky, and there was a questioning gaze in its eyes.

Little Sky grinned, “Actually, many humans think the heavenly tribulation is something that the heavens created to punish people. That isn’t correct. If the heavens wanted to punish people, it could send tribulation lightning down when you’re extremely weak. At that time, would you be able to fight back against such powerful tribulation lightning? But the heavens didn’t. Why? It’s because the heavens have no intention to restrict the development of all things in the world!”

She shook her head when she spoke up to this point, “But if everyone cultivates, it’s a huge consumption of the world. Especially those powerful humans and demon beasts. Every advancement they attain will exhaust a huge amount of spirit energy in the world. If they are allowed to take without restraint, then a world would vanish in less than 100 years.”

Big Blackie and Little Blackie both had confused expressions in their eyes. Obviously, they didn’t really understand what she’d said.

Meanwhile, Little Sky continued, “Restraint! The world must have restrictions. It’s like order. If there are no restrictions and order, then the world would be destroyed by its inhabitants. The reason I don’t want you to advance here is because demon beasts and humans that experience heavenly tribulations are much stronger. It isn’t just reflected in their strength; it’s even reflected in the mental state. If you advance here, while you won’t encounter danger from a heavenly tribulation, your strength and mental state would be far inferior to the humans and demon beasts that have experienced their own heavenly tribulations. Moreover, you might even grow the mentality to continuously resort to such trickery!”

Big Blackie and Little Blackie exchanged glances, and then they shot a glance up at the sky. In the end they gazed at Little Sky. Obviously, they were asking why Yang Ye was advancing in here.

Little Sky patted Big Blackie’s head gently and smiled, “He isn’t the same. He’s a sword cultivator who faces his heart directly. He’s very well aware of what he’s doing. He won’t deceive himself, so he won’t have any problems when it comes to his mental state. As for his strength, it’s an even smaller problem. Heavenly tribulation can temper someone, but ordinary heavenly tribulations are completely meaningless to him. Because his strength has far surpassed the heavenly tribulation for Semi-Deities.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Little Sky stood on Big Blackie’s back and said, “Let’s forget him. This world is so huge, let’s go have a look! I want to see how this world was formed. I’m really curious!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she tapped her foot lightly against Big Blackie. Big Blackie wasn’t infuriated by it at all. Conversely, Big Blackie nodded meekly and started walking forward with Little Blackie.

Just like that, Little Sky hummed an unknown tune as she continued forward under Big Blackie’s lead.

In the 3rd level.

At this moment, Yang Ye’s aura was powerful to an extremely terrifying extent. His aura even caused Xiao Yuxi’s heart to palpitate slightly!

At this moment, Yang Ye was madly devouring the remaining energy from the Fire Spirit Fruit, and he was even using his own Primordial Violet Energy to stimulate his cultivation.

With the effects of both these energies, his aura was growing stronger and stronger. At this moment, his aura wasn’t weaker to some Deities.

Actually, even though he wasn’t at the Deity Realm, his body was comparable to the body of a Deity! If he wasn’t judged as a sword cultivator and was judged as a body cultivator instead, then he was a Deity. That was also why he could lift the casket lid to fight a Dualism Realm expert!

One day later!

A wave of terrifying aura erupted from Yang Ye’s body. But it didn’t take long for that aura to surge back into his body.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye opened his eyes, and a ray of bright light flashed through them!

Xiao Yuxi hurriedly asked with a slightly trembling voice, “Have you succeeded?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and sighed softly, “Sigh…”

Xiao Yuxi’s face instantly turned ghastly pale. She immediately walked over to him, took his hand, and spoke softly, “it’s fine. No matter what, I’ll be here for you!”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly wrapped his arms around her waist, and then kissed her gently on her forehead. He smiled, “Sigh, I merely advanced to the Semi-Deity Realm. I wanted to advance to the Deity Realm. What a pity.”

Xiao Yuxi’s delicate figure trembled when she heard him, and then she looked up at him. Her eyes revealed undisguised joy, “Is… is that true?”

Yang Ye nodded and smiled, “I’m a Semi-Deity now! I finally don’t have to be so filled with terror in this damnable place!”

Meanwhile, Xiao Yuxi suddenly kissed Yang Ye. Yang Ye was slightly stunned by this. Obviously, he hadn’t expected her to take the initiative like that. Right when he was about to kiss her back, she suddenly bit his lip. Yang Ye naturally didn’t feel any pain from that, and he just looked down at Xiao Yuxi who seemed to be blushing slightly. He smiled, “Are you angry?”

She shook her head, “It’s fine so long as you’re alright!”

“It’s only temporary!” Yang Ye spoke in a low voice. He hadn’t forgotten where he was. If he was in the outside world, his current strength was even sufficient to look down upon Deities. But in this place… He merely had the ability to keep himself alive!

Xiao Yuxi hugged him tightly and spoke softly, “No matter what, I’ll be by your side! Always!”

Yang Ye’s heart felt warm. He hugged her around her waist. Xiao Yuxi, Su Qingshi, Zhuang Weiran, Little Yao… All of them were Yang Ye’s motivation to fight!

Not to mention glory and wealth, he could even give up eternal life and his sword for them!

Of course, he understood that if he were to give up his sword, then he may lose them instead!

Yang Ye stayed by Xiao Yuxi’s side for a while, and then he left the Primordial Pagoda.

20 days had passed in the outside world.

However, time wasn’t that important to him anymore.

The lifespan of a Voider was around 13,000 years, and a Semi-Deity had around 20,000 years. In other words, he had around 7,000 years now!

Even though 7,000 years seemed like a huge amount, it could actually be exhausted by utilizing the Stellar Sword Diagram just once!

However, he definitely didn’t dare to rashly utilize it now!

Yang Ye emerged from beneath the ground and glanced at the surroundings. He was just about to leave when a terrifying aura descended upon the area he stood on!

It didn’t take long for an old man to appear in front of him.

It was none other than Demon Wu!

How did he find me? Yang Ye was stunned. But it didn’t take long for him to come to an understanding. Because he hadn’t utilized the Sword Domain to conceal himself once he emerged from the ground.

Demon Wu had a ferocious expression on his face as he gazed at Yang Ye, “That woman isn’t here now, so let me see who can stop me from killing you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he charged at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye cracked his neck, flipped his palm, and the casket lid appeared in his grasp, “Old bastard! I’ll beat you until you’re crippled!”
