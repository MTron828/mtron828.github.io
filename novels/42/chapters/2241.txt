Chapter 2242 – Kill Yang Ye First!

In the sky above the God Realm.

The army of the undying race had arrived, and the 500 undying cavalry stood neatly there. All of them had a powerful Nefarious below them.

They were led by Dugu Juetian and Master Yuan.

Death energy filled the entire God Realm.

Perhaps the undying cavalry weren’t very strong alone, but if they fought as an army, they were very, very terrifying.

After all, they were an army.

Even Yang Ye would absolutely not dare to fight a few hundred undying cavalries. They were trained well, and they’d experienced countless battles together. So their tacit understanding could only be described as terrifying.

At this moment, they were standing together with their auras all merged together, even their breathing was in sync.

In the city.

Countless looked up at the army above, and there was seriousness and fear in their eyes!

Swish!

The sound of air being torn open resounded.

An instant later, Shi Tian appeared before Master Yuan. There was a wisp of solemness in his eyes as he gazed at the army before him.

The god race once possessed a powerful army, but it was still inferior to the undying cavalry when it was at its prime.

Shi Tian restrained his thoughts and gazed at Master Yuan, “May I know your name?”

Master Yuan grinned, “One of the undying race’s three wise men, Master Yuan.”

Shi Tian nodded, “Shall we spar?”

Master Yuan smiled, “It’s a good plan. If you can kill me, then the danger your race is facing will be undone. It just happens that it’s exactly what I want too. If I kill you, killing the rest of the people here will be absolutely easy.”

Shi Tian said, “Then bring it!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stretched out his hand, and the scene around Master Yuan instantly changed.

A boundless starry sky.

At this moment, they were within a boundless starry sky.

Master Yuan glanced at the surroundings and smiled, “You’re quite capable.”

He tapped his finger forward once he finished speaking.

Hiss!

The space in front of Shi Tian cracked open abruptly, and it grew larger at an increasing rate. In the blink of an eye, the space around Shi Tian had completely cracked open!

An invisible force was mincing the space around Shi Tian.

However, Master Yuan frowned because Shi Tian had suddenly appeared 300m behind him. At the same time, a huge fist slammed down at the back of his head.

Everywhere it passed, space cracked open, inch by inch. It was an extremely shocking sight!

Master Yuan didn’t turn around and just clenched his right fist.

Bang!

A strand of black energy swept out from his back, and it enveloped his fist. As soon as their attacks collided, space in a huge area exploded apart.

Shi Tian took a step forward, and then he slammed his fist at Master Yuan, “Earthbreaker!”

Boom!

A powerful wave of energy swept forward.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The space before Shi Tian collapsed inch by inch, and a powerful wave of energy swept toward Master Yuan like a storm. It was so strong that Master Yuan’s bones started to make cracking noises.

Master Yuan was about to attack when Shi Tian suddenly took a step forward and slammed a punch at Master Yuan, “Heavenshatter!”

Boom!

A wave of powerful energy rippled forth from his fist, and it was extremely swift. It took just an instant to arrive before Master Yuan and collide with Master Yuan’s attack. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

At this moment, Master Yuan’s expression changed drastically.

Bang!

A strand of black energy instantly swept out of Master Yuan and exploded apart. The force of it instantly blasted Master Yuan away.

As soon as he stopped himself, Shi Tian took a step forward and tapped a finger at Master Yuan from afar, “Nirvana!”

Hiss!

The space around Master Yuan suddenly started burning.

An unknown flame was burning Master Yuan and the space around him!

In just an instant, Master Yuan’s body turned ethereal as if it was about to be obliterated!

At this moment, Master Yuan’s expression was unprecedentedly solemn.

He didn’t dare to act carelessly and twisted his right hand.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Strands of black energy rippled forth like venomous snakes. In an instant, countless strands of black energy filled the battlefield. At the same time, the space here seemed like it had been struck by lightning and was trembling incessantly.

Boom!

A moment of silence ensued, and then the space in a huge area collapsed.

A boundless black hole appeared in the starry sky. The starlight in the surroundings had been completely eradicated, and the surroundings had turned deathly silent.

However, Master Yuan and Shi Tian were still alive.

But they weren’t in a good condition.

At this moment, Master Yuan’s body was slightly ethereal, and his countenance was extremely pale; Shi Tian’s body was covered in cracks instead.

Both of them had been injured from the collision.

A long time passed before the space here returned to normal.

Master Yuan glanced at Shi Tian and said, “As expected of a patriarch, your strength is formidable. Unfortunately, it’s far insufficient to face my undying race.”

He twisted his right foot against the space below him.

Hiss!

The space below him cracked open, and he vanished.

Shi Tian frowned slightly while viciousness flashed through his eyes, and he raised both his hands. In an instant, the space around him shook like an earthquake was running through it. Meanwhile, a fist which carried boundless black energy arrived above him. If it struck him, his head would explode into bits.

“Destroy!” Meanwhile, Shi Tian clenched his fist and slammed it upward.

Bang! Bang!

Their attacks exploded apart, and Master Yuan was pushed backward. At the same time, Shi Tian stomped his right foot down and shot up into the air.

Master Yuan’s expression changed slightly. His death energy circulated madly within him before surging out incessantly and converging on his fist. A moment later, he slammed his fist forward.

Bang!

A wave of terrifying black energy surged out from his fist, and Shi Tian was forced to a stop. A moment of silence ensued, and then Master Yuan slammed his fist forward again.

Bang!

Endless black energy rippled forward and slammed Shi Tian down.

Meanwhile, Master Yuan didn’t stop, and he slammed his right fist at Shi Tian again.

Three punches!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Countless strands of black energy surged down at Shi Tian, and every one of them could obliterate a world.

Meanwhile, a vicious glow flashed through Shi Tian’s eyes, and he stretched out his right hand and clenched it.

Crack!

The surrounding space which had just repaired itself cracked open once more. At the same time, a ray of dazzling golden light erupted from Shi Tian’s palm, and it transformed into a beam of golden light that shot up into the air and slammed against the boundless black energy.

Rumble!

Numerous loud explosions resounded incessantly.

Meanwhile, in the sky above the God Realm, the experts of the god race were in confrontation with the undying cavalry.

Ding Shaoyao stood at the front of the group, and there were only 20 people behind her. Ten of them wore white robes, and the other ten wore black holes.

Dugu Juetian looked up at the distant starry sky and said, “Looks like your patriarch is a little stronger than I expected!”

Ding Shaoyao shot a glance upward and spoke softly, “I’m really curious. The undying race has been killing everywhere it goes. When will you ever stop?”

“That’s none of your business!” Dugu Juetian replied indifferently, “You should worry about your god race’s fate.”

Ding Shaoyao replied softly, “It’s just death at most. There’s nothing to worry about.”

“I see you’ve accepted your fate!” Dugu Juetian smiled, “Once we’re done here, just Yang Ye and Void Spirit Continent will be left. Once we get rid of him, my undying race’s work in this large universe will be complete.”

Yang Ye!

Ding Shaoyao’s eyes narrowed slightly, but she remained silent.

Bang!

Suddenly, a loud explosion resounded from the battlefield in the distance, and then the starry sky there dimmed down. An instant later, two figures descended to the sky above the God Realm.

They were Master Yuan and Shi Tian!

Who won?

At this moment, everyone from the god race was worried. If Shi Tian lose, then the undying race would be able to annihilate them with ease; if Shi Tian won, then the god race would still have a chance!

Based on their outward appearances, both of them seemed completely unharmed, and only their countenances were slightly pale.

It was impossible to discern who had been victorious!

Shi Tian glanced at Master Yuan’s group and grinned, “The undying race will probably have to pay a small price to annihilate my god race today. Not to mention anyone else, just I alone am able to kill at least half of these undying cavalry, right?”

Master Yuan frowned slightly. If it was a while ago, he wouldn’t believe that Shi Tian possessed such strength. Yet now, he had to. Shi Tian was stronger than him.

He’d been at a disadvantage in their fight.

The undying race wanted to annihilate the god race, but the precondition was that losses were kept to a minimum.

Suddenly, Shi Tian said, “Why don’t we make a deal?”

Master Yuan gazed at Shi Tian, and the latter smiled, “My god race is already at a very weakened state, and we only have around 100,000 left. That much of death energy doesn’t make much of a difference to your undying race. So, how about you give us a path out of this. In exchange, my god race and I will help you annihilate Yang Ye. In that way, your undying race would have paid a very, very small price for your success. What do you think?”

Ding Shaoyao’s pupils constricted when she heard this, and her eyes were filled with disbelief.

Ding Shaoyao wasn’t the only one, Master Yuan and the others were stunned too.
