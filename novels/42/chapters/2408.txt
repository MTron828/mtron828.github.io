Chapter 2409 – Ants!

Jian You glanced at An Nanjing while feeling quite shocked in her heart.

Imposing aura!

There was an indescribably imposing aura on An Nanjing, and it felt confident, extremely confident!

It was like she could even kill a god!

A mysterious and amazing woman!

That was what Jian You thought of An Nanjing!𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Jian You restrained her thoughts and looked up into the sky. So long as Yang Ye could take the sword, then her mission would be over.

Moreover, her clan wouldn’t have to ever shoulder this responsibility anymore.

Her responsibility was to protect the sword until it found its owner.

In the past, she’d placed her hopes on Snowy because she felt that it was very likely for Snowy to take it with her. After all, Snowy was a Sprite Progenitor. Unfortunately, the sword hadn’t shown itself because of Snowy. That disappointed her a little. Yet now, it was actually on the verge of leaving on its own!

That was something she had never expected!

No matter what, she refused to let anyone spoil this. Because so long as the sword left the Sword Ruins, everything would stop being any of her business.

Jian You held her huge sword in her right grasp while looking up into the sky, and her gaze gradually turned icy cold.

…

Yang Ye descended all the way with Snowy on his shoulder.

When he was going in search of treasures, he naturally had to take Snowy with him.

Yang Ye descended all the way for a period even he wasn’t sure of, and then his feet finally touched the ground. Snowy scanned the surroundings with slight curiosity and anticipation. She had spoken with the sword in the past. At that time, she’d asked it to come out and play. Unfortunately, it seemed to be incapable of leaving.

Now, it probably could!

Yang Ye led Snowy ahead, and it didn’t take long for him to stop. There was a pitch black casket not too far ahead.

Snowy pointed at it.

Yang Ye smiled and walked over to it. It wasn’t a huge casket, and it was covered in strange symbols. Besides that, there were hair-thin black threads around it. These threads enveloped the casket like a ball.

The sword sheath in Yang Ye’s grasp was trembling.

Suddenly, the casket trembled. At the same time, the symbols around it started to light up along with the shaking of the sword sheath. After that, a low sword how seeped out from within the casket.

Snowy pointed at the casket again and gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at it for a long time, and then he raised his sword and swung it.

Bang!

Yang Ye and his sword were blasted away, but the casket didn’t even shake.

Snowy blinked and was quite stunned. A short while later, she flew over to Yang Ye with eyes filled with concern.

Yang Ye rubbed her head and smiled, “I’m fine!”

As he spoke, he looked at the casket. Its hardness had exceeded his imaginations. After all, his sword was a Divine Treasure, but it had actually been unable to leave a mark on the casket!

Suddenly, Snowy flew over to the casket and slapped it.

Bang!

The casket shook violently, and then it trembled while seeming to be afraid of something.

Snowy blinked and sniffed lightly.

Hiss!

The casket instantly turned ethereal, and it trembled even more violently.

Right when Snowy was about to inhale again, the casket suddenly sent out ripples. Obviously, it was communicating with her.

Snowy blinked and patted it lightly to say that it should open up.

The casket hesitated for a moment, and Snowy immediately opened her mouth in response. Suddenly, it shook, and then opened slowly.

A sword howl resounded, and it shot through the ground and into the clouds.

At this moment, everyone throughout Eternal Border heard it.

Countless experts looked toward the Sword Ruins, and it didn’t take long for some of them to think of something. Their expressions changed drastically, and they rushed in the Sword Ruins’ direction.

The Sword Ruins. Underground.

At the instant the casket flipped open, a sword flew out from within, and then it transformed into a ray of light that entered Yang Ye’s forehead.

In an instant, his body stiffened, and then the scene before him started to change.

Three breaths of time later, a black robed sword cultivator appeared before him.

The sword cultivator walked in Yang Ye’s direction and said, “If you wish to obtain this sword’s acknowledgement, then you must pass 12 sword cultivators!”

As soon as the man finished speaking, a ray of sword energy shot at Yang Ye’s forehead.

It was extremely swift to the point it exceeded Yang Ye’s reaction speed!

Yang Ye instinctively swung a punch forward!

Hiss!

A sword pierced through his harm, and Yang Ye was blasted away with it.

The Sword Ruins.

Jian You’s face gradually turned gloomy at the top of the mountain. It was because countless auras had appeared in the surroundings.

Countless experts were here.

An Nanjing shot a glance into the sky, and then she tightened her grip on the black spear.

Suddenly, a black robed old man appeared 300m away from them.

The old man glanced at them and said, “Jian You, I’m a Guardian of this world. Is Yang Ye inheriting that sword?”

That sword!

There was a sword in the Sword Ruins, and everyone knew about it. However, no one knew how strong it was. But now, along with that sword howl, they did.

It was very strong!

It could fall into anyone’s hands, but absolutely not Yang Ye’s.

Once it fell into Yang Ye’s hands, it would be a calamity to Eternal Border.

Jian You nodded, “Yes!”

The black robed man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Jian You, can you give me face and don’t let him get it? So long as he doesn’t get it, we guarantee that no one will break the rules of the Sword Ruins!”

Jian You shook her head slightly, “That sword is beyond my clan’s control!”

The black robed old man spoke solemnly, “Jian You, you should be aware of the enmity between us and Yang Ye. It isn’t just the Guardians, even the other powers won’t let him live. If you help him, it’s no different than going against all the powers of Eternal Border.”

Jian You replied indifferently, “If you have the ability, you can make that sword go with you. So long as you can accomplish that, I won’t say anything about it!”

The black robed old stated indifferently, “Jian You, out of consideration for your Jian Clan, I’ll give you one last chance. If you don’t stop him, then I’ll destroy the Sword Ruins.”

Jian You raised the huge sword by her side, “Give it a try!”

As soon as she finished speaking, countless strands of sword intent converged like a torrent toward her from all over the Sword Ruins. In an instant, her aura started to rise explosively while her sword intent started to increase madly as well.

The black robed old man’s gaze gradually turned icy cold, and then he raised his right hand and slammed it down. In an instant, the ground throughout the Sword Ruins started to tremble.

Suddenly, An Nanjing left the ground.

The black robed old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and a wisp of icy cold killing intent flashed within them. He’d been on guard against her from the very beginning, so he clenched his right fist slightly and twisted it.

Bang!

An Nanjing was stopped on the spot, and a huge spatial vortex appeared around her.

The old man was trying to mince her apart!

A wave of powerful energy was ceaselessly mincing apart everything there, including the ray of light An Nanjing had transformed into earlier. Right when the light was about to be obliterated, a spear suddenly shot out of the vortex.

Bang!

The vortex exploded apart, and then the spear slammed against the old man.

Boom!

The old man was blasted over 3km away. As soon as he stopped himself, An Nanjing appeared before him, and then her fist descended at his face.

Her fist!

The imposing aura it carried was countless times more terrifying than the aura of the world, and it was simply horrifying!

The old man was shocked. While he knew she was very strong, he’d still underestimated her strength.

The old man didn’t dare act carelessly in the slightest, and he immediately twisted his right hand, causing a pitch black rope to flash out and circle up before slamming down at her.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Explosions resounded incessantly through the sky, and then a spear blasted the black rope into bits.

Hiss!

The spear tore through the air and shot at the old man.

A wisp of ruthlessness flashed through his eyes as he slapped his palm forward.

Bang!

The world trembled before his palm.

It carried the strength to destroy three worlds!

However, the spear before him wasn’t any weaker to this. As soon as they collided, the old man was pushed backward repeatedly.

Suddenly, another spear shot at the old man.

The old man was shocked and slapped his palm forward again!

Hiss!

The spear pierced through the old man’s entire arm, and the powerful force within it blasted him 3km away. As soon as he stopped himself, An Nanjing appeared before him again. This time, she didn’t use her spear and just swung a kick at him.

Bam!

The old man didn’t even have the ability to dodge or defend himself against it, and so her kick slammed straight against his chest.

Crack!

At this moment, the old man’s chest and internal organs cracked open, and his figure was kicked away.

An Nanjing was about to attack again when two powerful auras suddenly slammed down at her from both sides!

Two more Three World Realm experts!

Coupled with the black robed old man, there were three Three World Realm experts now!

Moreover, there were countless more experts watching from the shadows!

In the clouds, An Nanjing stretched her right hand behind her head and wrapped her ponytail around her neck. After that, she closed her eyes slowly, “Ants!”

Bang!

A powerful aura swept out from within her!

The world trembled before her!
