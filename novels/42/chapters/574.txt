Chapter 575 – The Violet Mink’s Voice!

“Continue moving to the southern territory!” That was An Biru’s answer.

The black clothed woman hesitated for a moment before she said, “Biru, do you think the southern territory has any chance? Even if Yang Ye isn’t dead, what would he be able to do when facing over 10,000 Exalt Realm experts and countless profounders at the Spirit Realm and King Realm?”

An Biru stood up and said, “Do you think he would fulfil his past promise to us if we returned to Luo Jun’s side right now? He wouldn’t! The only reason he raised such conditions were none other than to obtain my An Clan and put on a show for everyone else. It’s to show the southern territory that he’s magnanimous and would forgive them. But the reality of the situation is that we’ll have no choice but to be cannon fodder upon siding with him again. Even if he is able to unite the continent in the future, we’ll only be suppressed and even destroyed by him!”

After she finished speaking, An Biru walked towards the door, and she stopped upon arriving before the door. She said, “No one likes to be betrayed. Luo Jun isn’t a broadminded person. There’s also another reason why he has raised such conditions, and it’s because he intends to take revenge on me! There’s one more thing you have to realize, Aunt. This is our last chance to choose sides, and the slightest mistake would really cause our Southern An Clan to be annihilated!”

The black clothed woman sighed lightly as she watched An Biru leave....

...

The Primordial Pagoda.

At this moment, Yang Ye was really in quite bad shape. That injury on his chest was filled with the mysterious energy of the Laws. Even if the Greenwood Spirit was repairing it incessantly, it was completely useless, and he would have probably died by now if it wasn’t for the Primordial Violet Energy within him.

However, the Primordial Violet Energy within him wasn’t in its truest form. So, it could only delay the growth of his injury but couldn’t heal it!

After she brought Yang Ye into the Primordial Pagoda, she held her scepter in her hand while she spoke in a tongue that didn’t belong to Profounder Continent. The scepter in her hand gradually emanated dazzling and resplendent blue light before the energy within the entire 1st level of the Primordial Pagoda started surging madly towards Yang Ye.

It wasn’t long before the little girl was pleasantly surprised to notice that the enormous injury on Yang Ye’s chest was actually starting to gradually heal as the energy surged madly into him.

“This princess was right! That woman’s Law Energy was only able to affect that world. The world within the Primordial Pagoda has its own Laws, and they instinctively reject the Laws of the outside world, so her Law Energy has lost its effect here. Haha! This princess is such a genius....” The usual icy coldness on the little girl’s face had vanished when she saw the injury on Yang Ye’s chest healing slowly, and her face was covered in a brilliant smile instead.

The energy in the surroundings didn’t stop and started to surge towards Yang Ye in an even larger volume. However, the little girl’s countenance had become slightly pale.

Bang!

A terrifying aura suddenly erupted from Yang Ye.

The fourth rank of the Exalt Realm!

As the unending energy repaired his body, Yang Ye had attained the fourth rank of the Exalt Realm as well. However, that wasn’t the end of it. The little noticed that the energy in an area of 500km around Yang Ye was gradually being exhausted.

She waved her hand, and the extreme-grade energy stones Yang Ye possessed appeared here before over 30,000 of them started to burn into flames and transformed into strands of energy which surged into Yang Ye’s body.

Pu!

A mouthful of blood sprayed from the little girl’s mouth. However, she didn’t give up and continued chanting in that mysterious tongue.

Before long, almost 90% of that pile of extreme-grade energy stones had been burnt into ashes. The energy here grew ceaselessly in volume while Yang Ye seemed like a terrifying vortex which caused the unending energy in the surroundings to surge into him. At the same time, Yang Ye’s aura gradually grew more and more terrifying....

Bang!

An aura that was two times more terrifying than before erupted from within Yang Ye. This aura swept out towards the surroundings like a gale, and it instantly caused ripples to undulate throughout the space in the surroundings.

The fifth rank of the Exalt Realm!

The blue light emanated by the little girl’s scepter gradually dispersed while she slowly fell from midair, but a pair or arms grabbed her when she was just about to crash to the ground.

Yang Ye asked in a slightly anxious tone as he gazed at the little girl’s pale countenance, “Are you alright?”

Yang Ye hadn’t noticed something at this moment, and that was that the little girl’s body was material and not ethereal as it had been in the past!

The little girl shook her head and said, “I executed a forbidden technique, so I’ll have to fall into deep slumber for some time. This is all that I can do for you. You have to understand that you’re still too weak. If you’re weak, then you’re bound to be bullied and suffer unfair treatment. I know you’ve been working very hard, but you have to work even harder. Understand?”

Yang Ye nodded as he stretched out his hand to wipe off the blood on the corner of her mouth. The little girl frowned slightly because she’d never been touched like that by another person. However, when she noticed the gentle emotions in Yang Ye’s eyes, her brows couldn’t help but ease up.

Right at this moment, a ray of violet light flashed before the violet mink appeared here.

The violet mink instantly pounced into Yang Ye’s arms and ceaselessly rubbed her head against his chest. As if she’d thought of something, she turned around and glared angrily at the little girl because the little girl had confined her earlier, causing her to be unable to help Yang Ye and have no choice but to watch as Yang Ye was injured by that petal.

Yang Ye rubbed the little fellow’s head and said, “She did it for your own good. It would be completely meaningless for you to come out there under such circumstances. Understand?”

The little fellow instantly revealed an aggrieved expression.

Yang Ye kissed her on the forehead and said, “I know you were concerned about me, but I would definitely go mad if anything were to happen to you. You’re more important than my life to me, so you absolutely can’t allow anything to happen to you. Understand?”

The little girl grunted coldly in a soft voice and seemed to be quite displeased. However, her voice was very soft so both Yang Ye and the little fellow hadn’t noticed it.

“No!” Suddenly, the little fellow opened her mouth and spoke. Her voice was very pleasant like the melodious cry of a bird. After she said that, the little fellow blinked before she jumped into Yang Ye’s arms while ceaselessly hitting Yang Ye with her little claws. It was like she was embarrassed.

Yang Ye was completely stunned, and he just stared blankly at the little fellow. He hadn’t imagined that the little fellow could actually speak now.... In other words, the little fellow has succeeded in receiving the inheritance and can take human form?

“Cough!” Right at this moment, the little girl suddenly coughed lightly. Yang Ye hurriedly looked over and saw the little girl had an exhausted expression on her face. Moreover, it seemed that it was almost impossible for her to keep her eyes open anymore.

Yang Ye was shocked in his heart and hurriedly asked, “Are you alright?”

The little girl glanced at him and said, “I’m going to fall into deep sleep, and I might have to sleep for a few hundred years....”

“What?” Yang Ye was surprised, “A few hundred years?”

The little girl said, “I’ve exhausted too much of my core strength, so this is the best outcome I could hope for. The only way to help me awaken quickly is to gain access to the 2nd level of the Primordial Pagoda and give me a ‘Rejuvenation Pill’ from there. Otherwise, I might really have to sleep for a few hundred years!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“I’ll access the 2nd level as soon as possible so you can awaken earlier. I guarantee that!” Yang Ye forced out a smile as he said, “After all, I promised that I would take you home!”

The little girl took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye before she closed her eyes.

Yang Ye couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed by sadness when he saw the little girl in such a weak state....

“I vow to become strong!” Yang Ye’s voice rumbled like a thunderclap throughout the 1st level of the pagoda.
