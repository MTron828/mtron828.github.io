Chapter 1846 – Shut Up!

The hall fell silent.

Everyone stared at Yang Ye without blinking. Some had fear in their eyes, but even more were visibly bewildered. Because they didn’t know why Yang Ye was attacking the Secret Sect.

Many members of the Secret Sect were unaware of what Su Mu, Ling Xiu, and Lin Weiran had done to Yang Ye that day.

Su Mu stared at Yang Ye. A short while passed before he spoke softly, “After I found out that your body wasn’t taken, I knew that this day would come. But I didn’t expect it to come so quickly!”

Yang Ye asked, “So you should be pleasantly surprised, right?”

Su Mu said, “Yang Ye, I was behind everything that was done to you that day. The others from the Secret Sect weren’t aware of anything, and they hadn’t participated. Please let them live!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Why should I?”

Su Mu replied, “They are of no threat to you. Moreover, they hadn’t done anything to harm you.”

“I’m willing to fight with you, Sect Master!” Suddenly, a young man stepped forward, “Sect Master, so long as we stay united, why should we fear him? We…”

Suddenly, his voice stopped abruptly.

Everyone watched with astonishment as the young man’s head suddenly fell off his neck.

Blood sprayed like a fountain!

All of them were astounded!

Yang Ye gazed at Su Mu and was about to attack, but a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of Su Mu’s mouth. At the same time, the vitality within him started vanishing rapidly.

Yang Ye frowned at the sight of this.

Su Mu stared at Yang Ye, “It was I, Su Mu, who betrayed you, and it has nothing to do with the others from the Secret Sect. Please spare them!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the color in his eyes vanished.

“Sect Master!” Everyone shouted while sorry filled their eyes.

Yang Ye turned to glance at them. Their expressions changed drastically while vigilance appeared on their faces.

Suddenly, a woman appeared before Yang Ye.

It was Yun Qian.

She looked him in the eyes, “I don’t know what happened between you and the Sect Master, but he’s right. Many people throughout our Secret Sect aren’t aware of the enmity between you. Even me. So, it has nothing to do with them. Don’t slaughter them, alright?”

Yang Ye glanced at her. Suddenly, he turned to look at Su Mu’s corpse. A ray of white light floated out from it, and then a figure appeared before everyone.

They recognized the figure.

It was Lin Weiran! However, it was clearly not her main body!

Lin Weiran sized up Yang Ye, “You’ve actually grown to such an extent.”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “I’ll get even with you once I get to the large universe!”

“You may not be able to get there!” She continued, “Perhaps you’re still unaware! Presently, many people are aware that the Sovereign of Man’s sword is in your possession. So, even many experts from the large universe are prepared to take a risk and come down here to look for you.”

Yang Ye said, “That’s probably all thanks to you, right?”

Lin Weiran nodded slightly, “Sort of. Right, do you know why I refused to take possession of that sword when I knew of its background and how outstanding it is?”

She didn’t wait for Yang Ye to answer and continued, “Because I know my own limits. If I take it, I’ll suffer endless problems. As for you, you’ll suffer worse problems. If you’re a kindhearted person, then perhaps your problems won’t be that serious. Because the Sovereign of Man will definitely not kill you, and he will just take his sword back. But you just happen to not be a kindhearted person, so based on his character, he’ll definitely kill you. You…”

“Shut up!” Yang Ye slammed his fist forward.

Lin Weiran’s voice stopped abruptly.

A breath of time later, she gazed at Yang Ye, “Good luck.”

As soon as she finished speaking, her figure became ethereal and vanished on the spot.

At the same time, Yang Ye vanished from the hall.

Everyone here stared blankly at Su Mu’s corpse. All of them felt lost right now.

What should the Secret Sect do now?”

…

After he left the hall, Yang Ye contacted Yang Lianshuang, and then he vanished into the sky.

Heaven Pillar Mountain. In a forest deep within the mountains.

Trees densely covered the entire mountain range. The branches and leaves were like a veil that almost fully blocked out the sunlight.

A ray of light flashed down from the sky and entered the forest.

As soon as he descended to the ground, Yang Lianshuang appeared in front of Yang Ye.

She sized up Yang Ye and said, “You’ve improved quite a bit!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I came to tell you that I’m going to the interior of Heaven Pillar Mountain!”

Yang Lianshuang’s expression instantly became solemn, “Do you know what kind of place that is?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Not really!”

She explained, “It’s the 3rd most dangerous place in Heaven Pillar Mountain!”

“Only the 3rd?” Yang Ye asked, “What about the 1st and 2nd?”

She replied, “The 1st and 2nd are the places where the three top Ancient Cultivators and four Heavenly Exalts reside. You’ve heard of them, right?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Yang Lianshuang said, “There are many periods in time when the interior of Heaven Pillar Mountain is even more dangerous than the places those experts reside. Because you don’t know who’s coming down from above. They may not be very strong, but they may be experts that even surpass the three top Ancient Cultivators and the four Heavenly Exalts!

Yang Ye said, “But it’s filled with fortune and opportunity, right?”

She replied, “You’ve made your decision, right?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She said, “Then be careful!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Yang Ye said, “You and the others have to be careful too. Notify me immediately if anything happens.”

Yang Lianshuang said, “Don’t worry. We won’t forget about you if we’re in danger!”

Yang Ye smiled, and then he vanished into the sky.

Once Yang Ye left, a woman suddenly appeared by Yang Lianshuang’s side.

Yang Lianshuang asked, “Why didn’t you meet him?”

She shook her head and remained silent.

Yang Lianshuang gazed at her, “You look very weak and gentle, but I can sense that you’re extremely dangerous.”

The woman looked up at the sky, “A very long time ago, a voice frequently appeared in my mind. At that time, I thought there was someone in my mind. In the end, I realized that I was wrong. That voice belonged to me.”

She withdrew her gaze and continued, “If it’s possible, I hope he never goes up to the large universe. Because the people there are even more realistic and cruel than they are here. Unfortunately, I know that it’s impossible.”

Yang Lianshuang gazed at the woman, “Who are you?!”

The woman looked at Yang Lianshuang, “A reincarnated!”

…

Two days later, Yang Ye met the leader of Heaven’s Net.

Yang Ye glanced at him, “How should I address you?”

The man replied, “Just call me ‘Dark’!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Brother Dark, have you fought a true ancient cultivator?”

Dark shook his head slightly, “No, but I’ve seen them. Their strength is absolutely beyond your imagination. It’s truly capable of obliterating the world!”

Yang Ye asked, “Is even their strength insufficient to head up into the large universe?”

Dark replied, “Don’t underestimate the barrier. It’s as terrifying as those ancient cultivators. In the past, it was comparatively better because very few would head up to the large universe. So, the experts up there didn’t pay much attention to it. However, as more and more ascended, they started strengthening the barrier. Presently, it’s much stronger than it had been all those years ago.”

He paused for a moment and gazed at Heaven Pillar Mountain, “Moreover, don’t forget that an even more terrifying existence resides on the mountain.”

Yang Ye asked, “What?”

“That dragon!” Dark spoke solemnly, “A dragon which doesn’t belong to this world!”

A dragon! Yang Ye remembered now. Dark was probably talking about the Candle Dragon, the dragon which had helped Xiao Qi steal the Primordial Pagoda!

Meanwhile, Dark suddenly said, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye nodded.

“You have to change!” Dark said, “Countless people are looking for you right now!”

He flicked a black robe over to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye didn’t refuse and wore it before going to the foot of Heaven Pillar Mountain with Dark.

There was a huge door at the foot of the mountain.

Yang Ye followed Dark to the door, and a white haired old man appeared before them.

The old man didn’t say a word.

Yang Ye was puzzled. Meanwhile, Dark flicked two fist-sized violet crystals and a golden card to the old man.

The old man waved his right hand, and he took the crystals before looking at Yang Ye.

Dark said, “Give him the card!”

Yang Ye nodded and tapped lightly. A golden card flew over to the white haired old man.

The old man glanced at it, nodded slightly, and vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye gazed at Dark, “There’s an entrance fee?”

Dark replied, “A Quasi Enlightened Realm expert didn’t pay once. Do you know what happened?”

Yang Ye asked, “What?”

Dark pointed towards the right. There was a stone pillar there, and a head with its eyes open was hanging from it.

Dark said, “That’s what happened.”

He didn’t speak further and walked forward.

Yang Ye glanced at the head. A short while passed before he shrugged, “How terrifying!”

He followed Dark once he finished speaking.
