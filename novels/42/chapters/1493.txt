Chapter 1494 - Law And Order!

Translator: InVader

Everyone gazed at Little Sky with disbelief. That little girl is greeting the Eye of the Heaven Dao?

However, what happened next made their jaws almost drop to the ground. Because the descending divine lightning suddenly stopped, and then all of it returned to the Eye of the Heaven Dao. After that, the Eye of the Heaven Dao actually moved slightly in the sky. If one treated it as a head, then it was nodding. In other words, it was replying to her greeting!

Everyone here was stunned. Especially Yang Ye. The Eye of the Heaven Dao is actually greeting her!

Meanwhile, Little Sky suddenly floated up towards the Eye of the Heaven Dao. Yang Ye quickly stopped her when he saw her do that.

Little Sky grinned at him, “Don’t worry. Little Little Sky is very kind. It won’t harm me!”

Kind… While Yang Ye was stunned on the spot again, Little Sky had arrived before the Eye of the Heaven Dao. After that, she stretched out her hand and touched it. Not only did it show no signs of resisting, it seemed very happy instead.

Di Jiang and Zhao Yun weren’t the only ones who were extremely shocked by this, even Blood Maiden was surprised.

The Eye of the Heaven Dao!

In the hearts of all cultivators, it was an absolutely terrifying existence. Even Rebirth Realm experts didn’t dare to look down on the Eye of the Heaven Dao. Or it should be said that they feared the Eye of the Heaven Dao. Especially an Eye of the Heaven Dao like this one which was comparable to the Eye of the Heaven Dao in the large world. Such an Eye of the Heaven Dao could kill Rebirth Realm experts!

Even they didn’t dare to get close to the Eye of the Heaven Dao!

However, they hadn’t imagined that a young girl would actually greet the Eye of the Heaven Dao. Moreover, they couldn’t believe their eyes when they saw that young girl actually dared to touch it. But the even more inconceivable part was that the Eye of the Heaven Dao actually allowed her to touch it!

It was the Eye of the Heaven Dao!

Di Jiang and Zhan Yuan’s eyes were filled with bewilderment and a trace of vigilance as they gazed at Little Sky.

Blood Maiden’s eyes were similarly filled with bewilderment. Obviously, even she had never witnessed something like this!

In the sky, Little Sky touched the Eye of the Heaven Dao and spoke softly, “Little Little Sky, all three of them are very strong, and you’re definitely unable to defeat them if they join forces. Even if you succeed, you’ll definitely be injured. So, just ignore them and let them fight. Alright?”

The Eye of the Heaven Dao suddenly emanated a faint ray of light, and it seemed to be talking to her.

A moment of silence ensued before Little Sky suddenly turned to look at Blood Maiden and the others, “It can ignore you, but you can’t destroy the space here. So, if you want to fight, then jointly create a pocket of space, and then fight there. That’s not a problem, right?”

Di Jiang took a deep and long glance at Little Sky, and then he said, “We don’t have a problem with that!”

They naturally didn’t have a problem. If they did and the Eye of the Heaven Dao attacked them, then they would be in trouble. They wouldn’t fear it at any other time because while they didn’t dare to destroy it, it couldn’t do anything to them as well. After all, this Eye of the Heaven Dao was only comparable to the Eye of the Heaven Dao in the large world, and there was still a small gap between them.

Yet now, Blood Maiden was here too! If she joined forces with it, then they wouldn’t have a chance to win at all.

Little Sky nodded, and then she gazed at Blood Maiden. Blood Maiden glanced at her as well and spoke indifferently, “No problem!”

Little Sky sized up Blood Maiden, “You’re really amazing. You’ve actually developed your Blood Domain to such an extent…”

Blood Maiden looked Little Sky in the eyes, “You’re really amazing too. I can’t even see through you!”

Little Sky chuckled, and then she turned to look at the Eye of the Heaven Dao. Meanwhile, the Eye of the Heaven Dao suddenly looked down at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched at the sight of this. Did it notice my Blood Sentence?

Sure enough, Little Sky suddenly floated down to him, and then she lightly tapped his forehead. In an instant, a ‘血’ character floated up from Yang Ye’s forehead.

The Eye of the Heaven Dao instantly started trembling at the sight of it, and it seemed to be about to attack Yang Ye.

Little Sky asked, “You killed an Eye of the Heaven Dao in the past?”

Yang Ye nodded. He couldn’t deny it because that ‘血’ character was the proof of it!

A moment of silence ensued, and then Little Sky suddenly grabbed the ‘血’ character above Yang Ye. Yang Ye watched with astonishment as she actually managed to grab it, and then she rubbed it lightly, causing it to instantly transform into blood red threads which vanished in the air.

Little Sky patted her hands together and looked up at the Eye of the Heaven Dao. She waved at it and said, “Little Little Sky, you can leave. I’ll come visit when I have the time.”

The Eye of the Heaven Dao moved down and up a little, and then it gradually became ethereal. In the blink of an eye, it vanished in midair.

Once the Eye of the Heaven Dao vanished, Blood Maiden took a deep and long glance at Little Sky, and then she turned to look at Di Jiang and Zhan Yuan. She didn’t waste her breath, and she just transformed into a ray of blood red light that shot up into the air. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Di Jiang and Zhan Yuan glanced at Little Sky, and then they transformed into beams of light that shot up into the sky.

It didn’t take long for the space here to start trembling again. However, it was much weaker. Obviously, they’d created a pocket of space as their battlefield.

Meanwhile, Little Sky was about to return into the Primordial Pagoda, but Yang Ye stopped her.

Yang Ye asked, “You know the Eye of the Heaven Dao?”

Little Sky nodded, “I do. I used to play with it a lot. It’s really fun. It’s able to release a huge amount of lightning, and they are even in all sorts of colors.”

The Eye of the Heaven Dao is fun… Yang Ye’s face twitched, and then he laughed bitterly, “Since you knew it, then why didn’t you tell me? It’s guarding that door. Since you know it, then don’t you just have to say the word and it’ll let us pass through?”

“I only recalled just now!” Little Sky had a slightly innocent expression on her face, “I only recalled that when I sensed it just now!”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a long time before he asked, “Have you really lost your memories?”

“Yes!” Little Sky nodded, “But if I’ve encountered them in the past, then I recall many things when I see them. But if I don’t encounter them, then I can’t recall anything. Oh my, it’s all because I went to sleep. I can’t keep sleeping from now on.”

Yang Ye said, “Little Sky, who are you?”

He was really extremely curious about her identity and background. She was truly too mysterious. She could be friends with the Eye of the Heaven Dao. In short, she was a mystery!

Little Sky blinked when she heard Yang Ye, “I’ll tell you when I remember, alright?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and nodded, “Alright!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he hesitated for a moment and said, “Can you make that Eye of the Heaven Dao help my friend?”

If Blood Maiden had the Eye of the Heaven Dao’s help, she would definitely win.

Little Sky shook her head, “I can’t.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She explained, “Little Little Sky is the Eye of the Heaven Dao. It represents a form of law and order. Since it's law and order, it has to be fair. If it arbitrarily interferes in the battles of humans, then the consequences would be unimaginable. Because at that time, it would represent that the law and order here were in chaos. So, it won’t interfere in the battles between the races in this universe.”

Yang Ye said, “But I heard that the Eye of the Heaven Dao is controlled by some powers in some worlds. How do you explain that?”

She replied, “Not every place has law and order. Or perhaps, it can be said that when a power’s strength surpasses the Eye of the Heaven Dao, they may stand high above it and create a new form of law and order. However, there are no powers like that in this universe. Even if the Eye of the Heaven Dao in some small worlds may work together with some powers, it’s on the basis that the person they are targeting is someone who’d committed a serious crime. You’re a good example. If you were the one fighting those two fellows just now, Little Little Sky would have definitely made you its prime target.”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Little Sky continued, “There’s another reason why I made it leave. Those two fellows are very strong, and that woman is extremely strong too. If they join forces, it’ll be extremely dangerous for Little Little Sky. But that fool never uses its brain on most occasions. So, I had no choice but to help it. Now, everyone has made a compromise.”

Once he heard this, Yang Ye understood why she’d come out here. She was worried that Blood Maiden and the others would join forces against the Eye of the Heaven Dao. Actually, it was possible. Because the Eye of the Heaven Dao had immediately attacked everyone here. So, they may join forces to deal with it first!

Just as Little Sky had said, if Blood Maiden and those two experts from the large world joined forces, then dealing with that Eye of the Heaven Dao would really not be a huge problem!

Yang Ye looked up at the sky and said, “Who do you think will win?”

Little Sky spoke as if it was obvious, “That woman, of course!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Why?”

Little Sky shrugged, “I don’t know. In any case, I think she’ll win. Moreover, it probably won’t take very long. Alright, I’m going back in to enjoy myself. Be careful.” As soon as she finished speaking, her figure shot into Yang Ye’s chest.

Bang!

Suddenly, the entire area shook violently like a huge explosion had occurred. Yang Ye was shocked and hurriedly looked up. He saw a woman walking down slowly from the sky, and there were two pillars of blood surging incessantly towards her from the area behind her.

It was Blood Maiden, of course.

Yang Ye asked, “Where are they?”

She replied, “See those two pillars of blood behind me?”

Yang Ye glanced at them. At this moment, they were ceaselessly surging down from the sky and entering Blood Maiden.

Blood Maiden added, “It’s their blood!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Blood Maiden said, “I can’t suppress my cultivation any longer. I have to advance right now. Protect me and don’t let anyone disturb me! Alright?”

Yang Ye hurriedly patted his chest and guaranteed, “Don’t worry, no one can disturb you while I’m here!”

Protecting her was naturally not a problem for him right now. Those two Rebirth Realm experts were dead, so no demon beast or human expert would dare to come here now.

Blood Maiden nodded slightly, and then she slowly closed her eyes. After that, her aura suddenly started to become violent.

Obviously, she was going to charge into the Rebirth Realm!

However, a grey robed old man suddenly appeared in the sky.

The grey robed old man’s gaze descended onto Blood Maiden, “Sure enough, it’s as the Oracle expected. You would absorb their blood. Hahaha! The blood of two Rebirth Realm experts is extremely pure. No wonder you aren’t able to suppress your cultivation anymore!”

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden glanced at the grey robed old man. But it only took a moment for her to withdraw her gaze. After that, she gazed at Yang Ye, “Remember what you just said?”

As soon as she finished speaking, she paused for a moment and added, “Men should keep their word!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words!
