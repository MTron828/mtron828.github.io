Profounder Continent. The territory of the oceanic clans.

At this moment, all the Half-Saints of Profounder Continent had gathered in the sky here, and their gazes were extremely solemn as they looked at the small island below them that had a teleportation formation on it.

Elder Mu and Lu Yan stood at the front of the group, and a man completely enveloped in black energy stood by their side! That man was the demonic figure who was sealed beneath the Heavenly Lightning Pool!

“We have no chance!” A voice sounded out from within the mass of black energy.

Lu Yan glanced at him and said, “Fan Ke, don’t tell me you’re going to surrender?”

“Surrender?” Fan Ke laughed with ridicule and said, “I was sealed by those bastards from the Hallowed Grounds and Outer Heavens for 100,000 years! Surrender? How stupid would I be to do that?”

Lu Yan chuckled and said, “Don’t worry, this teleportation formation can only transport 100 at a time. So, unless all of them are top-rate experts of the Hallowed Grounds. Otherwise, we’ll kill as many as they send here!”

“What if the high-grade Half-Saints of the Hallowed Grounds are the ones that come?” asked Fan Ke.

“We’ll just fight. If worse comes to worse, it’s only death. Don’t tell me that you’re afraid?” said Lu Yan.

Fan Ke replied, “Let me tell you in advance that if it’s the top-rate experts of the Hallowed Grounds that come here, then I’ll turn around and leave right away. I’m not afraid of death. But there’s no need for me to die for your sakes. I’ll always have a chance while I still have my life!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Suddenly, a ray of blue light erupted from the teleportation formation below them. The experts of Profounder Continent seemed like they were facing a formidable enemy when they witnessed this scene, and they instantly became tense.

It didn’t take long for Supreme Exalt He to appear on the teleportation formation.

The Half-Saints of Profounder Continent were about to attack, but they were stopped by Lu Yan.

Supreme Exalt He glanced at the surroundings and laughed with ridicule, “Is this all Profounder Continent has? Yet you dream of fighting against my Hallowed Grounds? How truly laughable! If it wasn’t for the defiant profounders, annihilating all of you would only take an instant!”

“Don’t tell me you came here just to brag?” Lu Yan spoke indifferently.

Supreme Exalt He glanced at Lu Yan and said, “No matter what, we were once from the same continent, so we don’t want to take things too far. I’ll give all of you a chance today. If you’re willing to surrender, then my Hallowed Grounds will let bygones be bygones. Moreover, we’ll even allow the members of your respective clans and sects to enter the Hallowed Grounds. Remember, this is your last chance. If you let it go, then only annihilation awaits all of you!”

Many Half-Saints were immediately tempted.

A cold glow flashed through Lu Yan’s eyes when he witnessed this scene, and he was about to act when Elder Mu stopped him.

Elder Mu shook his head and said, “Keeping disloyal people with us is like a calamity waiting to happen. Let them go now. It’s better than allowing them to stab us in the back when we fight the Hallowed Grounds.”

Lu Yan hesitated for a moment, and then he nodded.

It didn’t take long for a Half-Saint to step forward, and he said, “My Clear River Sect is willing to head to the Hallowed Grounds!”

As soon as that Half-Saint stepped forward, it didn’t take long for another to do the same, “My Endless Sect is willing to head to the Hallowed Grounds....”

“My Gu Clan is willing....”

It didn’t take long for all the Half-Saints besides the Half-Saints from the devil race, demon race, and oceanic clans to choose to represent their clans and sects to surrender to the Hallowed Grounds.

Elder Mu and Lu Yan’s faces were quite unsightly. They were aware that many would definitely choose to surrender under the pressure they experienced from the huge number of experts possessed by the Hallowed Grounds and defiant profounders. But they hadn’t imagined that there would actually be so many. Profounder Continent had lost at least 70% of its Half-Saints in just this short period!

So, how would it fight the defiant profounders and the Hallowed Grounds now?

The smile on Supreme Exalt He’s face grew wider and wider instead. He wasn’t afraid of fighting Elder Mu and Lu Yan right now because he was standing on the teleportation formation, and he could leave Profounder Continent in an instant. Moreover, his actions had caused many people to become disloyal to Profounder Continent. So, if Elder Mu and Lu Yan were to attack him now, then it was very likely that those Half-Saints would turn on Elder Mu and Lu Yan!

He was completely unafraid!

Right at this moment, an old man suddenly stepped forward. Lu Yan and Elder Mu’s expressions instantly changed when the old man stepped forward.

“Even your Ding Clan intends to surrender?” said Lu Yan in a low voice.

The old man hesitated for a moment before he said, “Senior Lu, everyone has their own aspirations. I hope you’ll give my Ding Clan a chance to live!”

“Ding Yuan, Ding Shaoyao won’t agree to this!” said Lu Yan.

Ding Yuan said, “I’m the patriarch of the Ding Clan!” As he spoke, he turned around to face Supreme Exalt He, and then he bowed slightly and said, “Supreme Exalt He, even though we’re not Half-Saints, we hope to be able to surrender to the Hallowed Grounds, and both fight and die with the Hallowed Grounds. I wonder if Supreme Exalt He is willing to accept us.”

“Of course, you are very welcome on our side!” Supreme Exalt He smiled and said, “If all of you are willing, even those that aren’t at the Half-Saint Realm may come to the Hallowed Grounds with your clans and sects. All of you won’t have to be in a constant state of anxiety there, and you don’t have to worry about the defiant profounders as well. Because the Hallowed Grounds is your greatest support!”

Many people weren’t able to remain calm when they heard Supreme Exalt He!

“My devil race is willing to surrender....” Suddenly, the Half-Saint of the devil race stepped forward and said, “I wonder if the Hallowed Grounds is willing to accept my devil race!”

“You’re most welcome....”

It didn’t take long for practically everyone from Profounder Continent to surrender.

A short while passed before Supreme Exalt He gazed at the Demon Saint, and he said, “What about the demon race?”

Lu Yan and Elder Mu gazed at the Demon Saint. The latter glanced at those who’d surrendered and said, “All of you’ll regret your decision!”

One of the Half-Saints spoke in a deep voice, “Demon Saint, you’ve seen the current situation. We have no chance to win. The Hallowed Grounds merely wants to kill Yang Ye. We truly don’t have to be buried along with Yang Ye.”

The Half-Saint from the devil race spoke as well, “Demon Saint, I know that you have a good relationship with Yang Ye. But do you really intend to allow the entire demon race to be annihilated because of that? The defiant profounders have emerged from the seal. If we don’t surrender, then how will we fight them? Only the Hallowed Grounds can keep us safe!”

The Demon Saint shook his head and said, “I’ll give all of you one last piece of advice. You should know Yang Ye’s character very well. So long as all of you leave Profounder Continent today, then all of you’ll become his enemies. All of you’ve seen how ruthless he is against his enemies. Moreover, he will absolutely not give any of you a chance if you leave Profounder Continent!”

“Yang Ye?” Supreme Exalt He laughed coldly and said, “He’s only a Monarch Realm profounder. What can he possibly do even if he attains the Half-Saint Realm? Demon Saint, Lu Yan, the Undertaker, and every other profounder on Profounder Continent, I’ll give all of you 5 days to consider my offer. If you don’t head to the Hallowed Grounds and surrender in that time, then my Hallowed Grounds will flood the entire continent with your blood. We won’t leave a single soul alive!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he started leading them into the teleportation formation.

As he watched the members of Profounder Continent being ceaselessly teleported through the formation, Elder Mu frowned and spoke in a serious tone, “All of this is slightly strange. Based on the current state in this world, those beneath the Half-Saint Realm are completely useless. Yet now, the Hallowed Grounds is actually even willing to accept those below the Half-Saint Realm. That’s really quite unusual!”

Lu Yan spoke coldly, “In any case, they’ll face horrible consequences. Just wait and see.”

Fan Ke spoke abruptly, “We haven’t even fought yet so many of your forces have left. We don’t even have a fighting chance now!”

“If you want, you can surrender to them right now as well!” Lu Yan spoke indifferently. Actually, he looked forward to seeing the entire continent surrender to the Hallowed Grounds. Because Yang Ye wouldn’t be tied down here if that happened. With the protection both he and Elder Mu could provide Yang Ye, they could still survive even if the Hallowed Grounds and defiant profounders attacked the continent!

“You seem to be so composed. I presume you definitely have a backup plan. I’d like to see what it is!” replied Fan Ke.

“Then just wait and see!” said Lu Yan.

...

The Hallowed Grounds. The underground world.

Yang Ye received news of it as soon as the members of Profounder Continent surrendered to the Hallowed Grounds.

In a hall.

Xiao Ying said, “See? The defiant profounders didn’t have to do anything. Just the Hallowed Grounds crushed more than 70% of your forces. Moreover, they didn’t even have to lift a finger. Do you think that you can fight the Hallowed Grounds and defiant profounders now?”

Yang Ye replied, “That’s their choice. However, some still chose to stay with me, like the demon race. I naturally wouldn’t care about the fate of those who betray me, but how can I abandon those who’re still following me?”

Xiao Ying gazed at Yang Ye for a short while before she said, “You really do surprise me. Alright, since you want me to help you, I’m really curious why you’re so confident that you’ll be able to convince me and make me fight the defiant profounders and Hallowed Grounds to the death by your side!”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment and said, “Xiao Ying, do you want to head to the Outer Heavens!?”

“Who doesn’t?” She said, “But I’m sorry, I don’t think you have the ability to accomplish that. Moreover, I think that besides the method which the defiant profounders and the Hallowed Grounds intend to use, there’s no other person or method in this world that can break open the Heavenpath. So, I won’t help you fight them!”

Yang Ye walked slowly towards her, and he looked directly into her eyes as he said, “What if I said that I can break open the Heavenpath. Would you believe me?”

“Continue trying to trick me! Go on!” said Xiao Ying.

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched, and he spoke in a very serious tone, “I can attain the Saint Realm!”

She spoke coldly, “Continue trying!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened. He didn’t waste his breath again, and he directly stretched out his hand and took her hand instead.

Xiao Ying’s expression changed, and she was about to attack him when her eyes suddenly opened wide, and her entire body started to tremble slightly. “Quintessence Violet Energy?”

As she spoke, she twisted her hand and grabbed Yang Ye’s hand instead, and it seemed like she yearned for more Primordial Violet Energy.

However, Yang Ye pulled his hand away and said, “You believe me now, right?”

“How could you possibly possess Quintessence Violet Energy!?” Xiao Ying stared fixedly at him.

Yang Ye replied, “That’s not important. The important thing is that I’m not just able to become a Saint myself, I can allow you to become one as well. So, do you still intend to refuse?”

Suddenly, Xiao Ying flashed over to Yang Ye, and then she grabbed him by the throat and said, “Let me become a Saint right now. Otherwise, I’ll twist your throat apart!”
