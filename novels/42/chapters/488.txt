Chapter 489 – An Xiaonan!

Night. Yang Ye arrived at the docks before that manager from the merchant group immediately appeared in front of him.

“Why are you only here now? The ship would have left in 15 more minutes!” The manager spoke with slight anger.

Yang Ye was just about to say something when the manager waved his hand and pulled Yang Ye up the enormous ship that spanned a length of over 1km, and he spoke while walking. “Our merchant ship usually prohibits the entrance of outsiders. However, you seemed like a good person to me and were in a rush to travel to the central territory, so I felt sympathetic and allowed you to board the ship. However, the high-ups would definitely suspect something if someone extra were to suddenly appear on the ship. So, I’ve prepared an identity for you. You’re my nephew from this moment onward, understand?”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. I seemed like a good person? It was probably my top-grade energy stones that looked good, right!? Yang Ye nodded and said, “I’ll obey all of Manager Yun’s instructions!”

At this moment, all he wanted was to avoid the pursuit of those four sects of the Ocean of Anarchy. He would still have to avoid such a huge group of experts even if he were at the Exalt Realm, let alone the Spirit Realm!

Yang Ye felt that his strength wasn’t bad amongst his peers, but he didn’t think that he could be invincible in the Exalt Realm as well. Confidence was a good thing, but conceit was no different than courting death.

Manager Yun’s expression eased up greatly when he heard Yang Ye, and he said, “The 1st level is where the goods are stored, and there are experts guarding it. Don’t go there or you’ll definitely die. The 2nd level is where the servants rest. You aren’t a familiar face to them, so don’t go there as well, otherwise, it might cause some trouble. As for the 3rd level....”

When he spoke up to this point, Manager Yun’s expression became solemn as he said, “The 3rd level is where the Young Miss and Young Master rest. You absolutely must not go there. If you were to offend them, then you won’t be able to survive no matter how many lives you have!”

Yang Ye smiled and said, “Manager Yun, how about we do it like this. I’ll just follow you, and I’ll just do whatever you say. Alright?”

Manager Yun nodded and said, “Hmm, you’re really sensible kid! You’re really promising!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

The ship was very large. It was over 1km long, over 300m wide, and it went very high up as well. There were numerous talisman markings all around the ship, and it was exactly these markings that made it so that this ship could be moved with energy stones instead. This ship could be sailed so long as it had energy stones, as for the consumption of energy stones and the speed of the ship, that depended on the grade of the markings!

Besides possessing the ability to move the ship, the talisman markings could be utilized to form a defensive formation and various offensive formations. After all, there were all sorts of dangers in the boundless ocean.

According to Manager Yun, the defensive formation was something that even a fifth rank Exalt Realm expert couldn’t break through, whereas, the offensive formation could slaughter Exalt Realm experts like dogs if one possessed sufficient energy stones!

Yang Ye was quite surprised when he heard this. This ship is that strong? It can slaughter Exalt Realm experts like dogs? Manager Yun really looked down upon Yang Ye for a while when he noticed Yang Ye’s surprise, and he said that Yang Ye had grown up in the southern territory and possessed no knowledge, so he intended to help Yang Ye widen his knowledge so as to avoid losing face at the central territory.

Yang Ye didn’t mind Manager Yun’s disdain, and he even modestly sought guidance. So, Yang Ye gained a huge amount of information from their conversations.

As they conversed with each other, they’d arrived on the ship without even realizing it. However, they were stopped by a guard at the ninth rank of the Spirit Realm when they were about to step foot onto the ship. But Manager Yun had spoken a few words and gave 2 top-grade energy stones to the guard before the guard smiled, nodded, and allowed the two of them to ascend the ship.

Manager Yun provided Yang Ye with a random room, and he asked Yang Ye to stay there and not go anywhere else. After that, he left.

The room wasn’t large, and there were some miscellaneous items in it. It was obvious that it was an unused room. Yang Ye didn’t mind it. He just sat cross-legged on the ground and started to cultivate. At this moment in time, he didn’t want to waste any time at all, and he intended to cultivate as long as he had the time!

Because he truly didn’t have a sense of security in this world without possessing formidable strength!

A while later, he suddenly heard footsteps from the hallway, and it caused Yang Ye to frown. Meanwhile, the door to the room was opened before Manager Yun walked in with another person. The person he brought was a young man around the age of 17. He was a handsome man in a wide blue robe. The young man was slightly stunned when he saw Yang Ye, and he had clearly not expected someone else to be here.

“Right, both of you stay right here and don’t go anywhere else. Understand?” As soon as he finished speaking, Manager Yun turned around and left, and only Yang Ye and the young man remained within the room.

Yang Ye thought for a moment before he came to an understanding. The young man was probably in the same situation as he was, a stowaway! When he thought up to this point, Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and continued cultivating with his eyes closed.

The young man seemed to be quite vigilant towards Yang Ye, and he remained quite far away. Only his gaze was constantly on Yang Ye. Yang Ye opened his eyes and glanced over when he sensed this gaze, and then his gaze descended onto the young man’s chest in the end. With the strength he possessed, just a glance at the young man before him had allowed him to discern that this was no young man, and it was a woman dressed as a man. However, it wasn’t his business at all. She was just a stowaway like him, and they just happened to meet here!

“Hey, are you from the southern territory?” The ‘young man’ remained silent for a long time before he spoke abruptly.

Yang Ye opened his eyes, glanced over, and then nodded.

“Then you definitely know An Nanjing!” The ‘young man’ spoke with slight excitement.

Yang Ye’s expression changed a little but the ‘young man’ continued. “Is she really invincible amongst those of the same realm of cultivation? Is she really capable of killing Exalt Realm experts? Right, did she really inherit the inheritance of the Martial God?” The ‘young man’ seemed to be quite excited and had unconsciously walked over to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye nodded when he noticed that there was nothing unusual about the ‘young man’s’ expression. He was quite amused in his heart because he hadn’t expected that An Nanjing’s reputation would be so great to actually have admirers. However, it made sense to him because An Nanjing was a woman that many men couldn’t compare to, so it was normal for women to admire her.

The ‘young man’ grew even more excited when ‘he’ saw Yang Ye nod and said, “Good! As expected of the person that I, An Xiaonan, admire. Right, I heard that the Sword Emperor, Yang Ye, has knelt before her as well, is that true?”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched, and he clenched his right hand before he said calmly, “You know Yang Ye?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Does anyone in the southern territory not know him?” An Xiaonan said, “It isn’t just the southern territory, his reputation has even started to spread through the Ocean of Anarchy. He can even be considered to possess a little fame in the central territory as well. I investigated him after I arrived at the southern territory. His strength isn’t bad and didn’t insult the title of Sword Emperor. However, I truly look down upon him!” As she finished speaking, An Xiaonan’s face was covered in disdain.

A slight smile had gradually appeared on Yang Ye’s face as he listened to her, but his smile had suddenly frozen on his face when he heard the last few words she spoke. Yang Ye glanced at her and spoke with a calm expression. “Why do you look down upon him?”

“He’s narrow-minded, vengeful, cuts others down like flies, and does everything according to his own personal whims. The slightest displeasure he experiences would end with him killing someone or annihilating their entire family. I really don’t know how such a person could become the Sword Emperor. In my opinion, the name, Sword Demon, suits him much better. Right, I heard he’s extremely perverted as well. He clearly has a Dao Companion yet seeks out women everywhere.... Should I not look down upon such a person who can’t concentrate on a single lover?” An Xiaonan clenched her fists tightly as she spoke furiously.

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched, and he had quit an unsightly expression on his face.

“Hmph! If I encounter a person like him, I’ll definitely castrate him so that he can’t bring disaster upon the women of this world!” An Xiaonan tightened her clenched fists and spoke in a furious tone.

“Can you defeat him?” Yang Ye spoke flatly.

“My grandfather can!” An Xiaonan paused for a moment and continued. “My father can as well. Right, my uncles as well! Oh, my older brother should be able to defeat him too!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. He shook his head and paid no further attention to her.

An Xiaonan seemed to be very interested in chatting and continued. “I purposely travelled to the southern territory this time to see An Nanjing. Unfortunately, I wasn’t even able to catch a glance of her. How infuriating! Fortunately, I heard she has gone to the central territory. Hehe, I’ll definitely be able to meet her once I arrive at the central territory. At that time, I’ll definitely ask her why she’s so formidable!”

Yang Ye was just about to speak when he sensed that the ship had started to move, and this allowed Yang Ye to heave a slight sigh of relief in his heart. Fortunately, no mishaps have occurred, otherwise, I’d have to waste even more time here. At this moment, he couldn’t afford to waste any time at all. Every single minute longer he stayed here was another minute that Luo Jun had to seize the World Portrait!

If Luo Jun succeeded, then the consequences would be unimaginable!

Actually, Yang Ye didn’t want to be in such a passive position. But it couldn’t be helped because he was the weaker party, and he could only passively react and retaliate against whatever Luo Jun threw at him. However, if he were able to obtain the World Portrait, then he could turn the entire situation around!

But Yang Ye was aware that it was definitely extremely difficult to obtain the World Portrait because the central territory was the Exalted Han Empire’s territory. Even though Monarch Realm experts couldn’t act against him, the Exalted Han Empire still had a huge amount of Exalt Realm experts! It wasn’t difficult for him to kill one or two Exalt Realm experts now. After all, he possessed numerous Dao Artifacts! But could he go against a dozen or even more Exalt Realm experts?

He definitely couldn’t! In short, his strength was still too weak! If he could attain the Exalt Realm or the peak of the Spirit Realm, then he would be in a much better situation! Because he wouldn’t have to be so worried when he utilized Dao Artifacts once he attained the peak of the Spirit Realm!

An Xiaonan suddenly said, “Eh, why do you look a little like Yang Ye?”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched, and then a cold glow flashed through the depths of his eyes.
