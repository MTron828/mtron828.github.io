Chapter 2056 – I’m Afraid I’ll Get Addicted!

Gao You was stunned when he heard Yang Ye. He was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly stopped and looked up at the sky.

Two rays of light shot down from high above.

A short while later, a woman in a green dress appeared before them, and there was another woman in a violet dress by her side.

The woman was Li Shui’shui.

Yang Ye frowned slightly upon seeing her. What’s that annoying girl doing here?

Meng Yin and Gao You’s expressions changed slightly at the sight of them. They hurriedly went over, and Gao You smiled, “Senior Sisters, are you here to read too?”

The woman in a green dress nodded slightly with quite a cold expression on her face.

Li Shui’shui glanced at them and smiled, “What? You’re here to read too?”

Gao You shook his head slightly. He glanced at Yang Ye and said, “We’re here to get even with him!”

“Get even with him?” Li Shui’shui was stunned and asked curiously, “Why?”

Gao You grinned, “It’s nothing. We just made a bet with this new librarian a few days ago. We bet that he won’t live more than three days, and today’s the third day. So, we’re here to deal with that!”

Li Shui’shui blinked and said, “You mean both of you are here to kill him?”

Gao You shook his head slightly, “Killing costs student points.” He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Help us save our points and kill yourself, alright? You’ll be able to avoid suffering too.”

Yang Ye glanced at them, and then he gazed at Li Shui’shui, “I have a question. Is the cost of killing in this damnable place just some student points?”

Li Shui’shui smiled, “You can’t kill them. If you do, it isn’t just a few student points that you’ll lose, you’ll be severely punished as well. Because you’re not a student of the academy. But if they kill you, they can resolve the matter with student points!”

Yang Ye couldn’t help but frown when he heard this.

Suddenly, Li Shui’shui added, “But if you leave this place and go somewhere else… In other words, if you leave the academy, then the academy won’t interfere. Because the academy has stated that if a student goes out of the academy and gets killed, it’s because the student lacks strength and deserves to die!”

“Looks like you’re very confident in yourself!” Suddenly, Gao You smiled, “Why don’t we go out and fight to the death?”

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “I really, really don’t understand. The conflict between us is quite minor, so why do you have to try and kill me?”

As far as he was concerned, they should have received a good education, so their mentality and intelligence were definitely not inferior.

Gao You smiled, “Are you begging for mercy?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Talking to you makes me feel like you’re making me as stupid as you.”

Gao You’s face became icy cold, “Cultivators should eliminate anything that makes them feel unhappy. You made us unhappy that day, so it may create inner demons for us one day. In order to prevent that, we naturally have to eliminate you!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “I see. If that’s the case, let’s go.”

Yang Ye gazed at Li Shui’shui, “Help me take care of the library, alright?”

She blinked, “Do I get anything from doing that?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “No.”

He walked into the library and brough Tian Xiu out of the pagoda. He rubbed her head and said, “Help me take care of this place, alright?”

She spoke softly, “Can Snowy accompany me?”

Of course she couldn’t!

After all, that evil treasure was still had its eyes on him. Yang Ye was about to speak when Tian Xiu spoke softly, “How long will it take you to get back?”

Yang Ye smiled, “A short while.”

She nodded, “Okay.”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Aren’t you afraid?”

She looked up at Yang Ye, “Afraid of what?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and smiled, “Nothing.” He withdrew a sword, the Sword Supreme, and placed it on the stone table, “Keep this to protect yourself.”

Tian Xiu didn’t refuse and nodded, “Alright!”

Yang Ye rubbed her head and walked out of the tower. He naturally wasn’t worried about Tian Xiu. She was extremely mysterious, and he had the feeling that even if he attacked her, he probably wouldn’t be able to kill her.

It was a very absurd feeling. Because she seemed like an absolutely ordinary person. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

However, that was what made it extraordinary.

Tian Xiu watched Yang Ye vanish into the sky. After that, she glanced at the sword on the stone table and tapped it lightly. It trembled slightly and seemed to be responding to her.

Tian Xiu turned and glanced at the surroundings. Suddenly, a wave of powerful force appeared out of thin air and pushed her out of the tower.

The Worlds library naturally had a spirit of its own, otherwise, the academy would never just allow a single person to take care of it. Moreover, it wasn’t just strong, so the academy was willing to let just a single person take care of it.

But at this moment, the library clearly didn’t welcome Tian Xiu’s presence.

Outside the tower, Tian Xiu stared at the library, and a short while passed before she sat on the ground. She put her arms around her knees and fell silent. Meanwhile, the Sword Supreme flew over to her and shook slightly.

She looked up at the Sword Supreme and asked, “Why do others hate me so much?”

The Sword Supreme shook to respond to her.

A short while passed before Tian Xiu spoke softly, “Is it because they’re afraid of me?”

…

Yang Ye and the others left Martial Emperor City and arrived in the boundless starry sky. Dazzling stars filled the surroundings. They were like specks of sand in the ocean as they stood here, they were so tiny.

Yang Ye gazed at Meng Yin and Gao You, “Go on!”

“You first!” Gao You smiled, “Otherwise, you may not have a chance.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a sword started to float above his palm. It was Judgment. Now, his cultivation had risen tremendously, so it wasn’t that difficult for him to use Judgment anymore.

Once Yang Ye drew his sword, Li Shui’shui’s eyes lit up, and the woman by her side had a solemn expression on her face. She wasn’t the only one, Gao You and Meng Yin had solemn expressions on their faces too.

An expert’s strength was evident once the expert made a move!

At this instant, they stopped looking down on Yang Ye. But at this moment, Yang Ye’s sword vanished.

A ray of light which was thin as a hair flashed through space.

Gao You’s hairs were standing on end, and then his profound energy surged madly within him. A ray of dazzling light swept out from within him, but as soon as it came into contact with the ray of light, a hole was instantly sliced open in it.

Hiss!

The sound of space being torn open resounded.

A few moments later, the surroundings returned to calm.

Everyone gazed at Gao You, and the latter gazed at Yang Ye, “You…”

He hadn’t even finished speaking before his body cracked open like a shattered ceramic pot, and he instantly transformed into pieces that shot off into space.

Meng Yin’s face instantly turned pale at the sight of this.

Meanwhile, Li Shui’shui used her elbow to bump the woman on her side, “Big Sis Wo You, what do you think? I wasn’t lying, right?”

The woman glanced at Li Shui’shui and remained silent.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye gazed at Meng Yin, and the latter said, “I admit defeat!”

Admit defeat? Yang Ye was stunned and said, “Aren’t you worried about your mental state? What if it causes inner demons?”

Meng Yin glanced at Yang Ye and said, “You’re formidable, and we were ignorant. We made a big deal out of nothing, so please forget it ever happened.”

Yang Ye smiled, “In the beginning, you thought I was easy to kill, so a few words of mine became a “troubling thing” to you, and it would become inner demons if you didn’t kill me. Yet now that I’m stronger than you, there’s no such thing?”

Meng Yin fell silent.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye shook his head, “In the end, it was all because of strength. If you have sufficient strength, even if you slap a person or spit on a person, that person wouldn’t be a problem. But if you don’t have strength, even if you don’t say a word, someone may kill you because they just don’t like seeing you. As they say, the strong do as they please, and the weak accept their fate!”

Yang Ye gazed at Meng Yin when he spoke up to this point, and the latter transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the distance. It only took an instant for her to enter Martial Emperor City.

Meanwhile, Li Shui’shui suddenly asked, “Why didn’t you stop her?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Her death doesn’t change anything for me. Moreover, too much killing will lead to addiction. I’m afraid that I’ll get addicted.”

Li Shui’shui’s face stiffened, “Aren’t you afraid that she’ll take revenge?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Why don’t you dare to take revenge?”

Li Shui’shui’s face stiffened again. Why? It was simple. She was no match for Yang Ye.

That was just one reason, the other reason was that there was no irreconcilable enmity between them. Since it could be just deescalated, why wouldn’t she do that?

Meanwhile, Yang Ye snapped his finger, and a ring flew over to him. It was Gao You’s spatial ring.

Yang Ye didn’t take a glance at it before putting it away, and then he turned around with the intent to leave.

However, Li Shui’shui suddenly said, “We’re going to explore the secrets of a place, do you want to come?”

“No!” Yang Ye turned around and walked away.

Li Shui’shui suddenly shouted, “There are Originite there!”

Yang Ye stopped.
