Chapter 2419 – Xiao Shenwu!

After Yang Ye left, a woman appeared there in the sky above the Sword Ruins.

It was Nanli Meng.

She gazed at the sky with a solemn expression on her face.

The old man was at least a peak Three World Realm expert, but such an expert hadn’t even been able to resist a single attack from Yang Ye!

Not even one!

How strong was Yang Ye?

Nanli Meng didn’t know the answer.

A long time passed before Nanli Meng shook her head, “A calamity for Eternal Border!”

She turned around and left.

She knew Yang Ye’s temper well. He was an absolutely ruthless person, and he was ruthless to the bone. If someone was good to him, he would never forget it, but if someone was bad to him, he would never forget it as well!

Fortunately, the Nanli Clan hadn’t participated in any of this!

…

White Emperor City.

A young man was seated on the ground outside the city, and a round table was before him. There was a jug and two wine cups on it.

The young man was the Seventh Prince of the desolate race, Huang Yan!

Suddenly, Huang Yan looked up into the sky. A ray of cold light flashed there, and then a man in green clothes appeared not too far away from him. The man in green clothes had a sword in his right hand and a bloody head in his left.

Huang Yan’s eyes narrowed slightly when he saw the head.

Yang Ye walked over to the young man and tossed the head over, “I heard you wanted to see me. It’s not my style to come empty-handed, so I brought you a little gift. Do you like it?”

Huang Yan glanced at the head and smiled, “You’re too kind. There’s no need for a gift. However, reciprocating is a must, so I’ll give you a gift too.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand at the city. In an instant, a huge ethereal palm appeared in the sky above the city, and then it crashed down!

If it descended, the entire city would be obliterated!

Suddenly, a ray of sword energy shot at the palm. However, Huang Yan immediately swung a punch when it appeared.

Bam!

The sword energy was forced to a stop.

Huang Yan grinned, “Brother Yang, you should accept this gift!”

The huge palm above the city was descending, but just an instant later, it exploded apart and was obliterated!

Flying swords!

More than one of them!

Huang Yan glanced at the Sword Gourd by Yang Ye’s waist, “A pretty good treasure, and you use it well!”

Yang Ye sat down before him, “You’re the seventh prince, and Erya ate a third prince. I’m quite curious, how many princes are there?”

Huang Yan smiled, “There are 37. However, only nine came this time. Of course, only eight remain now.”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “You’re mistaken!”

Huang Yan was puzzled, “Huh?”

Yang Ye didn’t say a word and just swung his sword.

A sword howl resounded through the sky, and just the sword howl tore the sky apart.

Huang Yan’s expression had instantly changed when Yang Ye drew his sword.

Horror!

That was what Huang Yan felt right now. At the instant Yang Ye drew his sword, Huang Yan knew that he’d terribly underestimated this man who had the Sprite Progenitor!

This attack wasn’t something a Three World Realm expert could resist!

While he was horrified, his reaction wasn’t slow at all. At the instant Yang Ye swung his sword, a black lotus had suddenly bloomed from within Huang Yan, and then it instantly closed and enveloped him within it!

A Pseudo Divine Treasure!

The black lotus was a defensive Pseudo Divine Treasure. Moreover, it had been given a seal by the experts of the desolate race. So, when the seal was included, even if it couldn’t compare to a Divine Treasure, it wasn’t far off.

So, Huang Yan was very confident in it.

However, he didn’t know what kind of existence the sword in Yang Ye’s grasp was.

The sword descended!

Hiss!

Yang Ye’s sword didn’t even stop for a moment before the black lotus exploded apart, and then Yang Ye’s sword sliced straight through Huang Yan.

Huang Yan’s figure instantly stiffened, and he gazed at Yang Ye with a blank look in his eyes, “That sword…”

Yang Ye grinned, “Executor!”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away once he finished speaking.

Huang Yan’s figure suddenly split open, and then blood and internal organs sprayed all over the ground.

He was dead!

After he killed Huang Yan, Yang Ye suddenly shot up into the sky. It didn’t take long for him to arrive high above, and numerous powerful auras were shooting off into the distance!

They were fleeing!

They were the experts of Eternal Border who were watching from afar, and they’d decisively chosen to flee once Yang Ye noticed their presence!

However, Yang Ye didn’t spare them. Two flying swords shot through space.

Hiss! Hiss!

Along with two sounds of something being sliced open, two heads flew up into the air in the distance, and then blood rained down from above!

Instant kills!

Both swords had instantly killed a Three World Realm expert each!

Yang Ye turned around. There was one last Three World Realm expert fleeing madly in the distance.

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and issued a command in his heart. A flying sword instantly appeared there.

Hiss!

Everywhere the sword passed, space was instantly sliced into bits.

That expert in the distance seemed to have sensed the sword, and a wisp of bitterness arose on his lips. He stopped on the spot and closed his eyes.

He couldn’t defend himself against it at all.

As soon as he sensed it, he knew that he was done for!

Suddenly, a black ray of light slammed against the sword.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then the ray of light dispersed while the sword itself was blasted away.

Yang Ye glanced to the right, and a middle aged man was looking at him from there.

The Initial Emperor!

The middle aged man was the Shiyuan Clan’s Initial Emperor.

Initial Emperor gazed coldly at Yang Ye in silence.

Yang Ye grinned. He was about to attack when Initial Emperor suddenly attacked. A wave of powerful fist intent swept at Yang Ye like a storm. Moreover, numerous powerful auras appeared around Yang Ye, and these auras rapidly slammed down at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He drew his sword and swung it.

Hiss!

A ray of light swept out with Yang Ye at its center, and it instantly sliced apart those auras.

However, Initial Emperor and the others had vanished!

The ancestors of the five clans!

They hadn’t chosen to fight Yang Ye to the death, and they’d chosen to avoid him instead!

They had no choice. Yang Ye’s strength was too terrifying! Even they didn’t dare to fight him to the death because even if they won in the end, it would be a pyrrhic victory. Once that happened, it would only benefit someone else.

So, they chose to avoid him!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, fell silent for a moment, and then vanished on the spot.

Around an hour later, Yang Ye arrived at the Nanli Clan, and Nanli Meng immediately appeared before him.

Nanli Meng sized up Yang Ye and smiled, “Congratulations! Now, very few throughout Eternal Border dare to offend you!”

Yang Ye grinned, “Miss Nanli, long time no see.”

She chuckled, “Go on, tell me why you’re here!”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “The Guardians, the ancestors of the five clans, and those fellows who fled from the Sword Ruins that day. I want to know where they are.”

Nanli Meng fell silent.

Yang Ye smiled, “You can’t tell me?”

She smiled, “Brother Yang, you’re putting me in a difficult position!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “I’ll owe you a favor, alright?”

A favor!

Nanli Meng fell silent.

Yang Ye wasn’t the same person he used to be, so a favor from him was quite valuable.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

It should be described as being very valuable!

However, she shook her head, “Brother Yang, I can’t pick a side this time. My Nanli Clan is staying out of this. I’m sorry.”

Yang Ye glanced at her and nodded, “Alright, I understand.”

He turned around and walked away.

Suddenly, Nanli Meng said, “Brother Yang.”

Yang Ye stopped and gazed at her. She hesitated for a moment and smiled, “The Abyss World, Xiao Shenwu, Xuan Xiao, Wan Weihu, the desolate race, and the Di Clan. Watch out for them. Good luck!”

She turned around and left.

Yang Ye repeated those names in his heart and said, “Thank you!”

Yang Ye’s figure transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

Meanwhile, down below. Nanli Meng glanced at the sky, and no one knew what she was thinking.

Meanwhile, a beautiful woman appeared by her side. It was the ancestor of the Nanli Clan, Nanli Yin.

Nanli Yin spoke indifferently, “You still took his side in the end!”

She smiled, “I just helped a little.”

Nanli Yin spoke solemnly, “It may bring calamity to our clan.”

Nanli Meng glanced at her, “Don’t worry, I’ll protect the clan.”

She grinned, and then she vanished into the distance.

Nanli Yin remained silent on the spot.

…

Myriad World Mountain.

One of the teleportation formations here trembled, and then a young man in a white robe walked out from within it.

The man glanced at the surroundings, and then he looked up at the sky. He closed his eyes slowly, and a long time passed before he grinned, “It is the aura of a Sprite Progenitor. Interesting.”

As he spoke, he glanced at the surroundings, “Eternal Border. I wonder how many people here still remember me, Xiao Shenwu! Hahaha!”
