Chapter 582 – Slaughter!

“You actually dared to kill a member of my Hallowed Grounds!” Su Wu’s expression became slightly ferocious. There was also deep shock besides the killing intent within his eyes. If Yang Ye didn’t know about the Hallowed Grounds, then he could understand it as fearlessness from ignorance. However, Yang Ye was clearly aware of how terrifying the Hallowed Grounds was yet still dared to strike a killing blow, so he truly wondered where Yang Ye got the courage to commit such an act!

The woman revealed shock in her eyes as well. That fellow actually dared to kill someone from the Hallowed Grounds? After all, when they arrived at Profounder Continent, even those old geezers who had cultivated for a few thousand years acted amiably and didn’t put on airs at all when facing them!

Corpse Ancestor was quite surprised as well, but he was even more pleasantly surprised. He said, “Kid, you’re really interesting. You even killed members of the Hallowed Grounds without the slightest hesitation. Do you know that even if it was during the ancient times of over 15,000 years ago, no one dared to disobey the commands of the members of the Hallowed Grounds that showed themselves on the continent!?”

“Do you think they would let me go if I were to spare them today?” said Yang Ye.

“They wouldn’t!” Corpse Ancestor said, “They’d kill you to make an example of you. Moreover, everyone related to you and even all the profounders of the southern territory would be slaughtered by them. Because the Hallowed Grounds tolerates no offence. All who offend it die!”

Yang Ye shrugged and said, “Doesn’t that answer your question? Since reconciliation is impossible, then why should I keep him alive? Isn’t it better to seize this opportunity and kill as many as I can!?”

“Hahaha! Well said!” Corpse Ancestor roared with laughter and said, “Kid, you really shouldn’t be called the Sword Emperor. You should be the Sword Demon!”

“You’ll die a horrible death!” Meanwhile, Su Wu spoke ferociously.

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “I don’t know whether I’ll die, but I do know that you’ll definitely die.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s figure suddenly vanished on the spot, and he was already in front of Su Wu when he appeared once more. The latter’s expression changed violently when he saw this, and then countless symbols surged out explosively from within him. However, those symbols suddenly stopped on the spot after they’d just emerged from him.

“It’s the Sword Domain! He has comprehended the Sword Domain! Su Wu, watch out!” The woman spoke with astonishment from the side.

Unfortunately, it was too late as Yang Ye’s Sword Ruler had smashed forcefully against Su Wu’s head.

Bang!

Su Wu’s head instantly exploded into pieces, and countless strands of blood and brain sprayed towards the surroundings.

Yang Ye put the Sword Ruler away, gazed at Su Wu’s corpse, and then he shook his head and said, “Old bastard, are all the members of the Hallowed Grounds this weak?”

“It’s you who is too strong!” Corpse Ancestor spoke truthfully, “It would probably be difficult for you to find a match in the same realm of cultivation even during my era!”

Yang Ye shrugged, and then he flashed explosively towards the woman. She was horrified by this and was about to draw her sword. However, she noticed to her shock that she was actually unable to draw it. In just this instant, the Sword Ruler had descended down to her head, and then it was blasted apart like a watermelon.

“I thought that you would be merciful to women!” Corpse Ancestor spoke abruptly.

“Merciful to women? To an enemy?” Yang Ye shook his head and said, “How stupid would I have to be?”

“Indeed!” Corpse Ancestor nodded and agreed, “If I hadn’t been an idiot all those years ago, then I wouldn’t have been reduced to such a state! Kid, even though you happily slaughtered them just now, have you thought about what you would do if the Hallowed Grounds dispatches experts against you?”

Yang Ye said flatly, “I’ll take appropriate actions when they come!”

Corpse Ancestor shook his head and said, “The Hallowed Grounds’ strength is beyond your imagination. Let me put it like this. You might only be able to go against it by converging the strength of the entire continent. However, do you think that the demon race, devil race, or Luo Jun would help you? I don’t think so. Especially Luo Jun, he would probably wish for nothing more than to see you die!”

“The Hallowed Grounds isn’t that terrifying. At least it isn’t to you!” Meanwhile, the Sword Spirit’s voice suddenly resounded in Yang Ye’s mind. “Their Half-Saint Realm experts aren’t able to easily enter the continent because those experts and my second master created a barrier between the continent and the Daemon Catacombs. Experts at the Half-Saint Realm and above are prohibited from entering the continent from the Daemon Catacombs!”

“Why?” asked Yang Ye.

“Because it would destroy the balance in the continent. At the same time, it’s so that those Half-Saint Realm experts couldn’t abandon their responsibilities,” said the Sword Spirit.

So that’s why! Yang Ye said, “Your main body is within the Hallowed Grounds?”

“Yes!”

Yang Ye continued, “In other words, we have to head to the Hallowed Grounds, and then take your main body away from right under the noses of those Half-Saint Realm experts?”

“Yes!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched as he said, “Do you think that I can defeat a Half-Saint right now?”

“We can sneak in...,” said the Sword Spirit.

Yang Ye’s face darkened. He suddenly felt that promising the Sword Spirit to retrieve her main body was a mistake. He didn’t have to be fearful at all because their Saint Realm experts couldn’t come over to the continent. After all, he was a fifth rank Exalt Realm expert now, so even if he couldn’t defeat a Monarch Realm expert, he felt that fleeing shouldn’t be a problem by relying on the Stellar Shuttle and the Sword Domain.

However, if he were to head over to the Hallowed Grounds with the current strength he possessed, then he might have to face those Half-Saint Realm experts, and he would have no chance against them!

“The members of the Hallowed Grounds are aware that the seal has loosened, and they intend to gather all the experts of the continent to strengthen the seal. However, they’re utterly unaware that all their efforts are in vain. I’m able to sense that some defiant profounders have awakened, and they are just waiting for even more to awaken. Otherwise, they would have probably charged out of the seal by now! If we’re late, then the consciousness of my main body will definitely be obliterated by them! At that time, I’ll cease to exist!” said the Sword Spirit.

“So, you mean that everything the Hallowed Grounds’ doing is in vain?” Yang Ye frowned.

She said, “Not entirely. If Luo Jun is able to unify the continent, then there might be a slight chance if the Faith Energy of the entire continent combined with the Mortal Emperor Sword and Mortal Emperor Seal were utilized to strengthen the seal. However, it’s obviously impossible for him to unify the continent. Firstly, it’s because of your presence and the fact that he’s an enemy of yours. Secondly, even if you don’t stop him, it’s impossible for him to unify the entire continent in a short period of time unless both you and An Nanjing assist him.”

Yang Ye laughed coldly. “Do you think that’s possible?”

The Sword Spirit sighed softly, “Luo Jun’s greatest mistake was to become enemies with you for the Flower Palace’s sake. If he didn’t become enemies with you, then he would absolutely be able to unify the entire continent in a short period of time with both An Nanjing and your help. Even if he couldn’t unify the continent, if all of you join forces once those defiant profounders break through the seal, you may not necessarily have no fighting chance against them. Unfortunately, you’ve become enemies.”

Yang Ye said, “I’m no savior, and I’ve never thought about being one. In my opinion, I kill anyone who intends to kill me, regardless of whether that person is a hero or a savior. Don’t worry, I’ll definitely rescue your main body if I can. That wouldn’t just help you, it would help me as well. I presume that executing Heavenrend with your main body and the ancient sheath would definitely yield extraordinary results, right?”

“It won’t disappoint you!” said the Sword Spirit.

Yang Ye smiled, and then he opened his eyes and gazed at Corpse Ancestor. “Don’t you love killing? Are you interested in killing to your heart’s content with me?”

“You intend to look for trouble with Luo Jun?” said Corpse Ancestor.

Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t you want to?”

“Haha! Let’s go kill to our heart’s content! I’ve been wanting to absorb blood for a long time! HAHAHA!” Corpse Ancestor flashed explosively towards the distance.

Yang Ye took a deep breath, stomped the ground with his right foot, and then transformed into a black ray of light that vanished into the distance.

“As expected, men really are neglectful fellows!” Qin Xiyue grunted with displeasure when she saw Yang Ye leave. After all, she’d finally met him after so long, yet he’d left without even saying hi to her.

Xiao Yuxi glanced at Qin Xiyue. She didn’t say anything, but a sharp strand of Saber Intent surged out from within her.

Qin Xiyue refused to display weakness, and her black whip appeared within her grasp.

Both of them revealed the intent to fight on the city walls.

Ding Shaoyao said, “Do the two of you think that it’s easy for Yang Ye? No, it isn’t easy at all. Not to mention the Exalted Han Empire, he has to face the revenge of the forces which stand behind those three fellows as well. We can’t give him much help, so I hope that both of you don’t force him to become worried about the relationship between all of you as well.”

Xiao Yuxi withdrew her gaze and shot it towards the distance.

Qin Xiyue grunted coldly and put away her whip as well.

Ding Shaoyao shook her head. Yang Ye is really going to have a headache in the future.

...

Luo Jun’s army was garrisoned over 50km away from Ancient Domain City.

“Are you sure that the Hallowed Envoys were killed by Yang Ye?” Luo Jun gazed at the armored man standing before him.

The armored man nodded and said, “I am. The three of them were practically unable to resist even two moves of his. According to my estimations, Yang Ye is probably at the fifth rank of the Exalt Realm now.”

The others here gasped when they heard this. Exactly how brave is that fellow? Does he dare to do just about anything? He’s a complete and utter madman!“Hahaha!!” Luo Jun started laughing instead and said, “Yang Ye is digging his own grave! He actually dared to kill members of the Hallowed Grounds? They will definitely not let him live! Now, I don’t even have to do anything because the Hallowed Grounds will deal with him for me.”

The others instantly realized this as well when they heard Luo Jun. Indeed, the forces of the Hallowed Grounds stand above the entire continent! Would they let the matter rest since Yang Ye killed their members? If nothing unexpected happens, then Yang Ye will have to face endless revenge from the Hallowed Grounds. But with the Hallowed Grounds’ strength, they would probably only have to launch a single attack to make Yang Ye die a graveless death!

Bang!

Right at this moment, an enormous explosion suddenly resounded.

“Mortal Emperor! The situation is bad! Yang Ye and that skeleton have entered the army and are madly slaughtering our forces!”Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com
