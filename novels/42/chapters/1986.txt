Chapter 1987 – Horrifying!

A change of clean clothes!

“Hahaha!!” Everyone exploded with laughter when they heard Yu Jing.

Qin Chuan chuckled, “Bastard, you’re still such a clean freak even in death!”

Yang Ye chuckled as well.

Meanwhile, the demon beasts had arrived!

“Kill!” Viciousness covered Yang Ye’s face as he turned around and swung his sword. A ray of sword energy shot forward, and the demon beasts at the front of the group were instantly sliced into two.

“Kill them!” The others behind Yang Ye charged forward like madmen.

It was a bloody battle!

Countless demon beasts charged at them, but the frenzied attacks they launched made it so that practically all the demon beasts which charged into the path were dead. It didn’t take long for a small hill of corpses to form.

However, those demon beasts were still charging fearlessly.

Some distance away, a petite young girl stood with her hands behind her back. There was a huge beast lying by her side. It just laid there quietly with its head by her feet.

There was a white robed old man beside her too.

The woman was looking ahead. It was in the direction of Yang Ye’s group.

She was Zhi’er. However, she wasn’t the same person anymore. Both her bearing and appearance had changed dramatically, and she seemed mature now!

Zhi’er was mature and cold now!

She suddenly asked, “Uncle Guan, what do you think of him?”

The old man pondered deeply for a moment and asked, “Which aspect?”

She replied, “Everything!”

The old man answered, “He possesses such strength at his age, so he’s on par with some of the geniuses of our god race. The most precious part is how loyal he is. His character and disposition are excellent. I suggest that you help him and form goodwill between us!”

She glanced at the old man, “Uncle Guan, is that what you really think?”

The old man replied, “If it was before this, I wouldn’t suggest you do that. Yet now, while he’s a human, based on how he does things, he isn’t someone ungrateful. So, you can help him if you want!”

She looked up into the distance. Yang Ye and the others seemed to be on the verge of being unable to hold on any longer. Even Yang Ye’s body was covered in injuries.

A moment of silence ensued, and then she looked down at the Royal Crocodile.

The latter understood her intentions. It immediately stood up and leaped into the ocean of demon beasts.

Roar!

This roar horrified countless demon beasts!

In an instant, all the demon beasts stopped and looked at the Royal Crocodile!

Bang!

Suddenly, a huge demon beast descended before the Royal Crocodile. It was the demon beast with the body of a person and the head of an ox!

The demon beasts exchanged glances, and then the Royal Crocodile’s tail swept forward. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Bang!

Everyone watched with astonishment as the demon beast in front of the Royal Crocodile was swept away, and it flew over 30km away before crashing to the ground. Its entire body cracked apart into pieces!

All the demon beasts were stunned, and so was Yang Ye’s group. It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to glance at the surroundings, and he saw a familiar figure in the sky!

Zhi’er!

She glanced at him and vanished without saying a word.

The Royal Crocodile hurriedly went after her. Meanwhile, all the demon beasts here fell silent. They exchanged glances, but none dared to attack.

Meanwhile, A’Man’s voice came from Yang Ye’s side, “Let’s leave first!”

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and led them away.

Yang Ye and the others sat cross-legged deep within the mountains.

At this moment, less than 30 of them were left!

Since they left Sky Residence City, they’d lost half of their members, and the remaining half were heavily injured.

Yang Ye waved his right hand and 5 immortal crystals appeared before every one of them. While they were curious about where Yang Ye got so many immortal crystals, they didn’t ask or refuse it, and they just took the immortal crystals.

Yang Ye sat down cross-legged and started recuperating as well.

A day later, A’Man suddenly stood up and gazed at a man by her side, “Is it done?”

The man nodded, “We lost a total of 32 brothers!

32!

All of them had extremely gloomy expressions on their faces.

A’Man closed her eyes slowly, and a long time passed before she opened them again, “We came here from the large universe for the sake of tempering ourselves, but I’m sure all of you’ve noticed as well. Something seems to have occurred in this place, and it has fallen into utter chaos. It isn’t suitable for us to temper ourselves here anymore. So, are all of you going to head back?”

“Head back?” Qin Chuan laughed bitterly, “Big Sis, you know that it’s impossible to head back right now!”

Yang Ye asked, “What do you mean?”

Qin Chuan replied with a bitter tone, “The teleportation formations are only opened once every 5 years. Moreover, those old fellows in the outside world have to join forces to open it, and they’ve agreed to open it every 5 years. There are 6 months left before the teleportation formations are opened again. But if we don’t have their help and rely on ourselves, then perhaps we’ll have to cultivate for 10 more years before we’ll have a chance to leave this place!”

Once every 5 years! Yang Ye frowned, “Can’t any of you contact the outside world?”

Qin Chuan shook his head, “Only they can contact us, and we’re unable to contact them.”

Suddenly, Ling said, “Even if they want to contact us, they can’t anymore!”

Everyone gazed at Ling.

Ling floated up slowly and glanced up at the sky, “This place has been enveloped by a mysterious formation. Now… no one can leave or enter this place!”

“What do you mean?” Qin Chuan walked over to Ling, “It has been sealed up by someone?”

Ling fell silent for a moment and replied, “Someone used a formation to seal the Dead Dimension! Why would the people of the Dead Dimension do something like this?”

Yang Ye glanced up at the sky. He didn’t see anything, but he could sense it. There was something different about this world.

“We’re finished!” Qin Chuan’s face was covered in despair, “I haven’t even gotten married!”

The others shook their heads and chuckled.

Someone suddenly asked, “What do we do now?”

All of them gazed at A’Man and Yang Ye. A’Man hesitated for a moment and replied, “We should head to Southern Qilin Mountain. There are more powers from the outside world over there. Moreover, based on the information I previously obtained, the organizations there and a few supreme experts have joined forces. I think we should go to them. We’ll only be able to survive 6 months if we work together. Once the people outside realize that they’re unable to contact us, they will definitely find a way to get to us!”

Southern Qilin Mountain!

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye. Yang Ye had a certain level of status in their group now.

It wasn’t just his strength; it was also what Yang Ye had done earlier.

Obviously, Yang Ye was the strongest amongst them, and if Yang Ye fled himself, he would have definitely been able to escape. After all, it was impossible for the demon beasts to stop a sword cultivator who was focused on escaping!

However, Yang Ye hadn’t fled, and he’d stayed behind with them! Of course, Yang Ye’s strength was the most important aspect.

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and said, “Then let’s go to Southern Qilin Mountain!”

No one had any objections.

They immediately set off. For the sake of not attracting attention as they traveled through the boundless mountain range, Yang Ye and the others chose to travel on foot. After all, they would be too visible in midair.

A’Man spoke softly by Yang Ye’s side, “Who was that who helped us just now?”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and replied, “Forgive me!”

The god race’s return was too shocking, and it would probably be bad for them if he exposed their presence.

A’Man nodded slightly, and then she fell silent. Actually, she possessed extensive knowledge, so she’s guessed some things. However, she didn’t dare say for sure. What she actually cared about was Yang Ye’s identity. If Yang Ye was from that race which she’d thought of… Then it would be a huge problem!

They sped up and didn’t encounter any trouble all along the way. However, they did encounter many mysterious and powerful auras. Fortunately, the owners of those auras didn’t come looking for trouble with them. Otherwise, they would have probably been forced into many terrible battles!

A day later, Yang Ye’s group finally arrived at Southern Qilin Mountain.

At this moment, there was a faint barrier of light around the mountain, and there were around 100 flying swords circling the mountain. Besides that, there was a dense expanse of demon beast corpses at the foot of the mountain, and there were human corpses amongst them too.

“Looks like Southern Qilin Mountain was attacked as well!” A’Man spoke softly, “But it seems like they were able to defend themselves!”

Yang Ye looked up, and his gaze descended onto the flying swords. Every one of them was extraordinary.

A’Man said, “Let’s go!”

As soon as she finished speaking, A’Man led them towards the top of the mountain. However, it didn’t take long for the flying swords around the mountain to shoot down and surround them.

Everyone’s expressions turned gloomy at the sight of this.

Meanwhile, a middle aged man and a group of people appeared before them, and their expressions grew even gloomier at the sight of the middle aged man.

A’Man spoke in a low voice, “You!”

The middle aged man was Dire Wolf of the Dire Wolves!

They hadn’t expected him to be here.

Dire Wolf glanced at them and laughed viciously, “I didn’t expect all of you to survive the attack of so many demon beasts. However, it looks like many of you died!”

A’Man spoke indifferently, “Fuck off!”

“Fuck off?” Dire Wolf chuckled, “A’Man, do you know why those demon beasts attacked Sky Residence City like that?”

A’Man frowned.

Dire Wolf pointed at himself, “Because I told the black wolves I command to lead those demon beasts there! Unfortunately, I never expected them to fail to annihilate…”

Dire Wolf had suddenly taken a few steps back. It was because A’Man and the others’ eyes had turned red with bloodlust.

The deaths of over 30 of their brothers had actually been caused by this fellow!

“You want to kill me?” Dire Wolf chuckled, “Why don’t you try?”

A’Man stared at Dire Wolf but didn’t attack. It was because their objective was to seek protection from Southern Qilin Mountain and killing would get them in big trouble!

“Don’t have the balls?” A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of Dire Wolf’s mouth, “Right, you don’t have any balls. Hahaha!”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly placed his right hand against his forehead, and then he slowly pulled out a sword.
