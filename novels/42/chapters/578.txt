Chapter 579 – The Daemon Catacombs!

“Finally someone who isn’t ignorant!” Even if he was facing a ninth rank Monarch Realm expert, the young man didn’t reveal even a trace of respect on his face. Moreover, Luo Tian didn’t mind it at all. Conversely, he revealed an amiable smile when he confirmed the young man’s origins.

The faces of Luo Jun and the others fell when they witnessed this scene. What exactly is their background?“Why... why have you emerged into this world?” asked Luo Tian.

The young man said, “The forceful descent of a Saint Realm expert into this world caused the seal on the defiant profounders to loosen. So, my Hallowed Grounds urgently requires a huge number of experts to assist us in strengthening the seal. We weren’t really hopeful because the spirit energy in this world was already dry to such an extent, but I never imagined that someone in this world actually inherited the position of Mortal Emperor. The Mortal Emperor, the Mortal Emperor Sword, the Mortal Emperor Seal, and the Karmic Luck of the world are very useful!”

“The seal has loosened!” Luo Tian’s expression changed as he said, “Is that true?”

The young man said, “Of course. Otherwise, why would we come to this place?”

As he spoke, he gazed at Luo Jun and said, “Since you’re the Mortal Emperor, then immediately summon all the experts of the human race at the Exalt Realm and above, and then immediately follow us to the Hallowed Grounds. We’ve already sent our forces to contact the demon race, devil race, and nether race. I believe that they’ll be heading to the Daemon Catacombs soon!”

Luo Jun frowned and gazed at Luo Tian. Luo Tian said in a heavy voice, “Over 100,000 years ago, a group of defiant profounders appeared on the continent, and they almost destroyed our world. At that time, a group of experts joined forces and were finally able to suppress those defiant profounders at a place called the Daemon Catacombs. After that, the descendants of those experts resided there and guarded the defiant profounders for generations.”

When he spoke up to this point, Luo Tian paused for a moment before he said, “At that time, all the inhabitants of the continent agreed that once the Heaven Dao Command Token was produced, then all powers and races had to listen to its holder’s commands. Otherwise, they would be regarded as traitors, and the Hallowed Grounds would be allowed to descend into our world and annihilate that traitor.”

So there was another unknown power on the continent.... Luo Jun felt quite uncomfortable in his heart. He’d thought that the Exalted Han Empire was practically like an extraordinary overlord throughout the continent, but never had he imagined that a place called the Hallowed Grounds existed on the continent. Moreover, based on how his ancestor was acting, the Hallowed Grounds’ strength was probably superior to the Exalted Han Empire!

How could he, the dignified Mortal Emperor, be willing to obey the orders of others?

Luo Jun was just about to refuse when Luo Tian’s voice suddenly resounded within his mind, “I know that you’re unwilling. However, not to mention that our Exalted Han Empire is unable to resist the Hallowed Grounds, we would probably be unable to resist them even if we joined forces with the demon race and devil race. Do you know why our Exalted Han Empire had been able to repulse the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor all those years ago? It wasn’t because of the experts of our empire, and it was because someone from the Hallowed Grounds stepped forward to stop him, so the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor gave the Hallowed Grounds face and didn’t annihilate my Exalted Han Empire!”

Luo Jun was shocked. He’s always thought that the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor had retreated because he wasn’t a match for the Exalted Han Empire, but he’d never imagined that it was actually because of the Hallowed Grounds!

It’s a force that even the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor feared?How terrifying is it exactly?

Meanwhile, the young man gazed at Luo Jun and said, “Time is of the essence. We don’t have much time to waste. Quickly gather all the Exalt Realm experts of the human world and then head to the Hallowed Grounds with us. You possess the Mortal Emperor Sword, Mortal Emperor Seal, and can even converge the Faith Energy of the human world. That’s extremely useful to us!”

Meanwhile, Luo Tian said, “Hallowed Envoys, it isn’t that we refuse to cooperate, but I’m afraid that we’re unable to do so!”

The young man frowned and said, “What do you mean?”

Luo Tian gazed at Luo Jun, and Luo Jun understood his intentions. He immediately said, “I’m quite embarrassed to say that while I’m the Mortal Emperor, I’m unable to command the entire human world for now. For example, this southern territory is resisting my Exalted Han Empire right now, and it intends to fight my empire until the end. So, I can only gather the Exalt Realm experts of my Exalted Han Empire at most. I’m powerless to command the southern territory!”

The powers of the southern territory clearly intended to fight him to the end. Even though he wasn’t afraid of them, he might not need to waste a single soldier to conquer the southern territory with the help of the Hallowed Grounds! So, a smile couldn’t help but arise on the corners of Luo Jun’s mouth.

The young man frowned. He hadn’t expected that the Mortal Emperor had actually not unified the human world. A Mortal Emperor without the Faith Energy of the entire human world wasn’t very useful to the Hallowed Grounds.

“Isn’t that very easy to resolve?” meanwhile, the other man who held a spear in his hand said, “Your army is already here, so just march over and crush them. Don’t tell me that the southern territory can resist your forces!”

Luo Jun said, “But wouldn’t that cause a huge amount of losses amongst the experts of the human world? Moreover, the Faith Energy I receive would probably reduce greatly if I were to annihilate all the profounders of the southern territory, right?”

Meanwhile, the only woman in the group spoke abruptly, “You intend to use us to conquer the southern territory?”

Luo Jun smiled and said, “I’m sure all of you’ve noticed that I was prepared to annihilate the southern territory. However, out of consideration for the fact that our human race should work together, I hope that the three of you would persuade those powers of the southern territory and make them surrender. After that, we can work together against the defiant profounders. Of course, if the three of you aren’t willing, then I’ll temporarily give up on attacking the southern territory and lead the elites of my empire to the Hallowed Grounds right now!”

The young man in the lead waved his hand and said, “Only by allowing you to gather the Faith Energy of the entire human race would you be extremely helpful to us. It wouldn’t do work even if a single territory is left out. The profounders of the southern territory are bound by duty to resist the defiant profounders. Even though we don’t want to interfere in the matters between all of you, the important matter at hand is to seal the defiant profounders. So, they must submit unconditionally to you no matter what and allow you to control the Faith Energy of the entire human world!”

Luo Jun was overjoyed when he heard this!

“Come, let’s go meet the profounders of the southern territory!” The young man turned around and walked out of Luo Jun’s dwellings.

Right at this moment, Luo Jun spoke abruptly, “What if they refuse?”

The young man stopped for a moment and said, “No one dares to disobey the Hallowed Grounds’ command. If they refuse, then we’ll annihilate them.” He walked off after he finished speaking.

The man with a spear and the woman followed him out.

The smile on Luo Jun’s face gradually widened when he heard this, and then he couldn’t help but roar with laughter in the end.

...

Outside Ancient Domain City.

“I’ll give all of you two hours to open the city gates and surrender. Otherwise, today will be the day that all of you are buried!” The young man floated in midair as he gazed coldly at Ancient Domain City, and his voice which was enhanced by his profound energy resounded throughout the city.
