Chapter 1778 – Above The True Rank?

Who did Yang Ye think of?

The Unfettered One!

If it was a powerful sword cultivator, it was naturally the Unfettered One.

Meanwhile, Su Mu added, “His attainments in the Sword Dao were truly terrifying. I’ve never seen someone as formidable as him.”

Yang Ye asked, “He’s called the Unfettered One, right?”

Su Mu gazed at Yang Ye, “You know him?”

Yang Ye nodded, “He’s from Merak System, just like me.”

“No wonder!” Su Mu nodded slightly, “He came to my Secret Sect to challenge our previous sect master. After our sect master lost to him, our sect master asked him to help seal the head. So, he went there.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why didn’t he do it?”

Su Mu replied, “He only attacked it once. The head spoke arrogantly when he went to see it. The head said he would let the Unfettered One hit him three times. But the Unfettered One only attacked once. That attack almost obliterated the head.”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Su Mu continued, “Unfortunately, he didn’t do anything else after that and just left.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Su Mu had quite an unnatural expression on his face. In the end, he shook his head and said, “He said that he refuses to bully an incomplete person!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Su Mu said, “Our previous sect master requested his help again, but he ignored our previous sect master’s request.” He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Young Brother, this is the wooden sword’s origins. This enmity has nothing to do with you, but it is linked to the wooden sword. Since the wooden sword is with you now, you’re unable to escape all of this.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Su Mu explained, “That head doesn’t hate my Secret Sect the most, he hates this sword the most. Once he escapes, the first thing he destroys may be this sword. But the sword is with you now. So, do you think you’ll be able to escape? Unless you abandon this sword, of course!”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Su Mu walked over to Yang Ye, “This is how karma works. When you obtain something, its karma coils around you. Just like my Secret Sect. We allowed the karma of the wooden sword and that head to coil around us in order to obtain the treasures from the large universe. So, my Secret Sect has to suffer this tribulation!”

Yang Ye said, “You’re very right. If there’s a cause, there’s an effect. But Senior, your strength far surpasses my own, and your Secret Sect’s overall strength surpasses my strength by countless times. If even you are helpless against that head, then what can I do? I’m not trying to run away from this problem, but I really can’t help!”

Su Mu spoke in a low voice, “I know.”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Su Mu suddenly gazed at him, “So, I’ve decided to use the Secret Sect’s full might to help you improve your strength and unseal this sword!”

Yang Ye was stunned when he heard this.

Use the entire Secret Sect’s strength to help me improve my strength? Just to help me unseal the wooden sword?

Meanwhile, Su Mu added, “Don’t look at me like that. I’m serious!”

Yang Ye glanced at Su Mu, “The condition is that I help seal the head?”

Su Mu nodded, “Besides that, you have to join the Secret Sect!”

Join the Secret Sect? Yang Ye shook his head, “Sorry, I belong to the Yang Clan!”

Su Mu replied, “I know. That isn’t a problem. You can hold two identities at once. My Secret Sect won’t stop you, but if my Secret Sect needs your help in the future, you just have to help within the scope of your ability!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time before he nodded, “Alright!”

It was a very good thing for him, so he would naturally not refuse it.

Su Mu nodded slightly and flipped his right hand, a dark green robe appeared in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What’s that?”

Su Mu replied, “The uniform of an elder in my Secret Sect. From this moment onward, you’re an Honorary Elder of my Secret Sect, and no one can give you orders.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “An Honorary Elder? Why?”

Meanwhile, the black robed old man spoke abruptly, “It’s naturally to help you avoid trouble. If you wear that, the disciples of the Secret Sect won’t look for trouble with you. Of course, we’re not afraid that something will happen to you, we’re afraid something will happen to them!”

How terrifying was Yang Ye's strength? While the Secret Sect had numerous geniuses, and all of them were top-rate geniuses, their genius wasn’t enough before Yang Ye. Besides that, Yang Ye wasn’t a person who was easy to deal with. So, their solution was to stop others from looking for trouble with him!

Yang Ye rubbed his nose. Do I look like someone who likes to cause trouble?

Normally, he never caused trouble!

Meanwhile, Su Mu gazed at the old man, and the latter nodded slightly before looking at Yang Ye, “Young Master Yang, come with me.”

Yang Ye asked, “Where are we going?”

The old man replied, “The Martial Pavilion. Every sect master of my Secret Sect will leave behind their experience and comprehensions there. They were once the monstrous geniuses of the medium universe. So, I believe that it should be helpful to you!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright!”

Meanwhile, Su Mu suddenly gazed at Yun Qian, “Yun Qian, you go too!”

Yun Qian was slightly stunned, and then she quickly said, “Thank you, Sect Master!”

Just like that, the black robed old man left them out of the hall.

Meanwhile in the hall. After Yang Ye and the others left, a black shadow suddenly appeared behind Su Mu.

The black shadow spoke solemnly, “Are you really going to place all our hopes on him?”

Su Mu replied with a question, “What else can we do?”

The black shadow asked, “Why?”

Su Mu fell silent for a moment, and then he said, “Because that sword is willing to follow him. It’s so proud that even the past sect masters of our Secret Sect have been unable to subdue it. Even Wu Mu couldn’t subdue it. Yet now, it’s willing to follow someone. Do you think that person is ordinary?”

The black shadow spoke in a low voice, “Just because of that?”

Su Mu shook his head slightly and withdrew a scroll, “All the information about him is in it. Take a look!”

The scroll flew over to the black shadow while he spoke. A long time passed before the black shadow spoke solemnly, “He’s outstanding!”

Su Mu nodded, and then he looked up at the sky. There was a trace of worry in his eyes, but it didn’t take long for the worry in his eyes to be transformed into icy coldness.

…

The Martial Pavilion.

The black robed old man led them to a pavilion. The pavilion wasn’t huge, and it only had three levels. Actually, it seemed quite small.

“This is a forbidden area of my Secret Sect!” The black robed old man spoke abruptly, “Ordinary members of the sect aren’t allowed to enter this place. Even I’m not allowed to enter it. Go on in!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he entered the first level with Yun Qian.

As soon as they walked in, an old man in a luxurious robe appeared before them.

Yang Ye’s face became solemn when he saw the old man.

A 6th stage True Realm expert!

The old man was actually a 6th stage True Realm expert!

The old man sized up Yang Ye and Yun Qian, and then he said, “Mind your actions in here!” He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye and Yun Qian exchanged glances. In the end, they started walking forward.

It didn’t take long for them to stop. There were three pillars of light in front of them, and there was a memorial tablet on each of them.

Yun Qian’s gaze descended onto the tablet at the center, “I choose this one.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Yun Qian replied, “Because this sect master is female.”

Yang Ye gazed at the pillar. Sure enough, there was a name there — Ling Xiu!

“She was the 14th sect master of my Secret Sect!” Yun Qian spoke solemnly, “She attained the 6th stage of the True Realm at the age of 40!”

At the age of 40! Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. That’s absolutely monstrous talent!

Meanwhile, Yun Qian walked over to the pillar, and then sat cross-legged on the ground. In an instant, the pillar of light lit up, and then a woman in a cloud white dress appeared before it.

The woman seemed to be around the age of 20. She wasn’t drop dead gorgeous, but she had a dignified aura.

After she appeared here, Yang Ye noticed that Yun Qian had become quite nervous.

Ling Xiu’s gaze descended onto Yun Qian. She sized up Yun Qian, and then she frowned slightly. Yun Qian’s countenance instantly turned ghastly pale upon witnessing this scene.

A moment of silence ensued, and then Ling Xiu shook her head, “Your natural talent is too low!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she intended to return to the pillar of light.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “What do you think about my natural talent?”

She gazed at Yang Ye. An instant later, she said, “Ordinary!”

Suddenly, a sword appeared before Ling Xiu’s forehead.

“How dare you!” Meanwhile, a furious shout resounded, and then the old man from before appeared here. At this moment, the old man in a luxurious robe was glaring angrily at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye ignored the old man and looked Ling Xiu in the eyes, “What do you think of this attack?”

She looked Yang Ye in the eyes for a few moments, and then she replied, “It’s very weak!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, she added, “But if I was in the same realm of cultivation as you, then I wouldn’t be able to resist it!”

The old man gazed at Ling Xiu when he heard this, and his eyes were filled with shock. He was naturally shocked. After all, Ling Xiu had been a sect master of the Secret Sect and a peerless genius!

Yet now, she said that she was inferior to Yang Ye if they were in the same realm of cultivation!

Yang Ye put his sword away and bowed slightly to Ling Xiu, “I apologize for the offense. I have no ill intent towards you. I just want to say that natural talent can’t decide a person’s future, and we shouldn’t judge a person’s future based on that person’s natural talent!”

Ling Xiu gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then she asked, “You’re a disciple of my Secret Sect?”Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Yang Ye shook his head slightly.

Ling Xiu frowned while bewilderment appeared in her eyes.

Meanwhile, the old man suddenly said, “Sect Master Ling, he isn’t a disciple of our Secret Sect. He… he’s an honorary elder of our sect. Because that wooden sword chose to follow him!”

Ling Xiu gazed at Yang Ye, “Your sword intent has attained the True Rank, yet you’ve chosen to forget it. I presume you’ve obtained the guidance of an expert. Now, do you want to allow your sword intent to surpass the True Rank and attain a higher level? Right, your slaughter intent too!”

Yang Ye’s eyes instantly narrowed when he heard this.

Sword intent and slaughter intent above the True Rank!
