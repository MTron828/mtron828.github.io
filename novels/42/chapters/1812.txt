Chapter 1813 – I Have A Fist! Want It?

It was Yang Ye, of course.

When he noticed them, Yang Ye hadn’t hesitated to follow them immediately.

He naturally didn’t intend to spare them.

As far as he was concerned, the members of the Ying Clan were a potential problem. Because he was very well aware that while they were in hiding now, they would definitely target the Yang Clan in the future. However, Yang Lianshuang and him hadn’t been able to find them, so they had no choice but to put it aside!

But he hadn’t expected to actually encounter them here.

Since he’d encountered them, he naturally had to kill them!

He’d sword on his soul that day!

Moreover, weeds had to be pulled out by the root!

Not to mention that they were planning to target Nether Maiden and the others.

Ying Ke and the other old man’s expressions became cold when they heard Yang Ye, and Ying Ke spoke fiercely, “Where the hell did you come from, little bastard! You….”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Ying Ke when his figure appeared once more. An instant later, he slammed his fist at Ying Ke.

“How laughable!” A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of Ying Ke’s mouth, and then he waved his right hand. A strand of powerful energy sprayed out.

Ying Ke revealed ridicule because he’d discerned that the black clothed man before him was just a 2nd stage True Realm expert.

Such an expert was nothing before him!

However, he didn’t underestimate his opponent and used 70% of this strength. After all, there was no lack of monstrous geniuses in Heaven Pillar Mountain.

At the moment Ying Ke waved his hand, Yang Ye’s right hand suddenly stopped, and then a wooden sword appeared in his grasp.

Chills ran down both Ying Ke and the other old man’s spines when they saw the wooden sword.

Yang Ye!

At this moment, the same name had appeared in both their minds!

Ying Ke’s reaction was absolutely swift. As soon as Yang Ye’s sword appeared before him, he didn’t even try to stop his attack before flashing away. However, Yang Ye’s speed suddenly multiplied by at least 10 times!

The Grand Teleportation Technique!

Yang Ye naturally wouldn’t choose to hold back when facing Ying Ke and the other old man, and then exchange hundreds of blows with them. It was meaningless and stupid! After all, if he did that, it wouldn’t just be a waste of time, it increased his chances of being exposed. Once he was exposed, it would be difficult just to get away!

Moreover, he still had to travel to Divine Ruins City!

This attack could be said to be at Yang Ye’s limits!

Coupled with the fact that he’d launched the attack from a close distance, Ying Ke hadn’t even been able to react before Yang Ye’s sword pierced through his forehead.

Hiss!

Blood sprayed from Ying Ke’s forehead.

Dead!

A 6th stage True Realm expert had been killed in an instant!

Meanwhile, the other old man just ignored Ying Ke and shot towards the distance.

However, Yang Ye suddenly stomped his right foot down and instantly vanished on the spot.

Split Second combined with the Grand Teleportation Technique!

Split Sect was extremely swift on its own. Now that it was enhanced by the Grand Teleportation Technique, its speed was entirely capable of posing a threat to 6th stage True Realm experts. After all, even Ying Jing’s clone hadn’t been able to stop his attack!

Hiss!

As soon as Yang Ye vanished, a ray of light suddenly shot through the old man’s forehead over 30km away, and it was accompanied by a string of blood.

The old man’s figure stiffened on the spot.

A moment later, the light dispersed, and Yang Ye appeared before the old man. However, his figure crashed to the ground once he appeared there.

Over exhaustion!

Just Split Second exhausted a huge amount of energy. Now that it was used with the Grand Teleportation Technique, the exhaustion of profound energy was simply terrifying. Even at the 2nd stage of the True Realm, he could barely execute it twice!

At this moment, it wasn’t just his profound energy that had been exhausted, even his body was exhausted. Presently, he couldn’t even defeat a Zenith Realm expert!

After resting for a while, Yang Ye quickly withdrew two Energy Pearls and swallowed them. They instantly transformed into countless strands of spirit energy that were immediately absorbed by the Primordial Pagoda. In the end, threads of violet energy entered Yang Ye’s body. Once the violet energy appeared within him, they were instantly sucked away by his body!

Under the recuperative effects of the Primordial Pagoda, his body recovered at a terrifying speed.

Around two hours later, Yang Ye opened his eyes slowly.

At this moment, he’d recovered fully.

Yang Ye gazed at the corpses before him, fell silent for an instant, and then waved his right hand. They were instantly transported into the Primordial Pagoda. At the same time, Yang Ye entered the Primordial Pagoda as well.

In the 3rd level, Yang Ye gazed at the corpses before him, and then his sword intent swept out and instantly enveloped them.

Refinement of Sword Servants!

He hadn’t refined Sword Servants for a very long time because ordinary puppets were useless to him. Yet now, there were two 6th stage True Realm experts before him, so they would be very useful if they were refined into Sword Servants.

However, he wasn’t confident in his ability to succeed. After all, they were 6th stage True Realm experts!

Fortunately, his sword intent was at the Enlightened Rank!

Even then, he’d still failed in the beginning. But he didn’t give up!

After failing over and over again, he finally succeeded at refining one of them in the morning of the 3rd day. However, he was quite disappointed to realize that its strength couldn’t compare to a true 6th stage True Realm expert.

But it was normal because it was a corpse.

A day later, the other corpse was refined into a Sword Servant.

Once he was done, Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda and shot towards Divine Ruins City. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

…

Divine Ruins City.

The city was situated below Heaven Pillar Mountain, and it was one of the four cities here.

At this moment, there was a faint barrier in the air above the city, and it covered the entire city.

It was the renowned Heaven Ruin Formation, and ordinary 6th stage True Realm experts weren’t able to damage it at all!

At this moment, there was a blue vortex at the entrance to the city.

Only entry was allowed!

In the city. Heaven Pavilion.

At this moment, over 200 people were gathered around Heaven Pavilion. All of them were 5th stage True Realm experts! Even though they were just at the 5th stage of the True Realm, their combat strength was absolutely capable of rivaling 6th stage True Realm experts.

Besides them, there were other experts hiding in the shadows. But those experts hadn’t shown themselves.

The reason they’d surrounded Heaven Pavilion was because Nether Maiden and the others were in there.

Of course, the main reason was still Yang Ye!

Everyone knew that Yang Ye was in Heaven Pillar Mountain. But Yang Ye hadn’t shown himself. Even those extraordinary figures here couldn’t find Yang Ye. It was at this time that news about Yang Ye’s relationship with Nether Maiden’s group started spreading.

After all, Nether Maiden and the others hadn’t concealed their identities when they went to help Yang Ye, so it was absolutely easy to find out.

The reason they hadn’t attacked was because there were four corpses outside the pavilion right now, and all of them belonged to 6th stage True Realm experts.

Those women in Heaven Pavilion weren’t ordinary!

Suddenly, a black robed old man walked over to the entrance. A woman appeared out of thin air before him. It was Nether Maiden.

The black robed old man sized up Nether Maiden, and he said, “We hold no intent towards you and your companions. We’re only here for Yang Ye. We’ll leave immediately if you reveal Yang Ye’s whereabouts to us.”

Nether Maiden glanced at them and said, “I don’t know!”

Their faces fell when they heard her.

Meanwhile, the old man added, “I know that while you’re just at the 1st or 2nd stage of the True Realm, your strength is sufficient to fight 6th stage True Realm experts. But you should take a good look around you and see how many 6th stage True Realm experts are here.”

Nether Maiden shook her head, “I really don’t know where he is!”

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Do you intend to become enemies with all the experts in Heaven Pillar Mountain?”

Nether Maiden’s face fell, “I told you! I don’t know!”

The old man gazed at her for a long time, and then he turned around to gaze at the people behind him, “I’m sure you’ve all realized that they will never expose Yang Ye’s whereabouts. So, I suggest that we join forces. Would we have to worry about them not telling the truth once we capture them?”

Everyone gazed at Nether Maiden when they heard the old man.

A smile curled up on the corners of the old man’s mouth, and he gazed at Nether Maiden, “We’ll give you one last chance. Are you going to tell us or not?!”

Nether Maiden gazed at the old man for a short while, and then she turned to look into the pavilion, “Second Sister, what do you think?”

A moment later, a ray of red light flashed.

At the same time, the old man’s expression changed drastically. He slapped his right hand forward, and a wave of terrifying energy swept forward.

Hiss!

However, the red light instantly blasted his energy into bits.

Boom!

An instant later, the old man’s figure was blasted over 3km away!

Meanwhile, the stench of blood suddenly appeared here. At the same time, a woman in blood red clothes appeared by Nether Maiden’s side.

It was Blood Maiden!

The second sister of the Nether Pavilion!

Blood Maiden glanced at the surroundings, and viciousness filled her eyes, “I don’t have Yang Ye! I do have a fist! Want it?”

Suddenly, a beam of black light shot over from afar, and it instantly arrived before Blood Maiden.

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and then Blood Maiden was blasted over 1km away!

A solemn expression instantly appeared on Nether Maiden’s face.

“Haha!” Suddenly, a chuckle resounded, “If Yang Ye doesn’t show himself today, then I’ll tear off your clothes and hang you outside the city walls.”

Everyone looked towards the source of the voice, and someone exclaimed with surprise upon seeing who it was, “It’s him! Tsk, tsk! I didn’t expect even someone like him to be tempted by that wooden sword!”
