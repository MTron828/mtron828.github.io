Chapter 2405 – I Refuse!

An Nanjing glanced at A’Leng and slowly clenched her fists.

Yang Ye grinned, “Miss A’Leng, you’re not planning on getting it by force, right?”

She pulled her hand away, glanced at her palm, and spoke softly, “To be honest, I did have such a thought. You may not be aware of it but this sickness of mine is impossible to cure even with Primordial Violet Energy. Primordial Violet Energy is only able to slow down its progress.”

She glanced at him and continued, “But if I have Primordial Violet Energy with me, I’ll have much, much more time. In that way, I’ll have time to look for another way.”

Yang Ye smiled, “So, you plan to use force, right?”

She gazed at him for a long time and cracked a smile, “Young Master Yang, are we friends?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Friends?

They couldn’t be considered as friends!

A’Leng chuckled, and then she suddenly started coughing. It took her a while to stop coughing.

She smiled, “Young Master Yang, I really admire your character!”

She stood up slowly as she spoke and looked up at the sky, “Young Master Yang, I have a small warning for you before you leave. I wonder if you’re willing to hear it?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Go on!”

She suddenly looked down at Snowy who was on Yang Ye’s shoulder. Snowy seemed to have sensed something and gazed at A’Leng.

Snowy blinked to display she was wondering what A’Leng wanted.

A’Leng gazed at Snowy for a long time and said, “The Sprite Progenitor! Young Master Yang, if she stays with you, then I can honestly tell you that both you and her won’t have a happy ending. She can’t be considered a Sprite Progenitor yet, but she will definitely become one. That’s why many powers, the very, very ancient type of powers, will absolutely not let her escape their grasps.”

She looked toward the north and continued, “There’s also the Eternal River and Eternal Kingdom which lies beyond it. Do you know that countless powers in Eternal Kingdom are waiting, waiting for a new Sprite Progenitor to be born.”

Yang Ye frowned and was slightly bewildered, “They are waiting for a new Sprite Progenitor to be born?”

A'Leng nodded, “If it hadn’t been for the Sprite Progenitor, Eternal Kingdom would have been destroyed during that war. But the desolate race wasn’t annihilated during that war, so Eternal Kingdom is afraid that they’ll return. Thus, they need the Sprite Progenitor. They would have a much, much greater chance at winning if they had the Sprite Progenitor on their side!”

She gazed at Yang Ye at this point, “As for the desolate, if they find out that you have a Sprite Progenitor, what do you think they would do? They would stop at nothing to seize it or kill it! What they cannot obtain must be killed! Other powers wouldn’t dare to kill the Sprite Progenitor, but the desolate race would!”

“The desolate race?” Suddenly, An Nanjing asked, “Are they very strong?”

A'Leng glanced at An Nanjing and smiled, “Very!”

An Nanjing shook his head slightly and gazed at Snowy, “Don’t be afraid, him and I will protect you!”

Snowy cracked a smile, flew over to An Nanjing’s shoulder, and then rubbed her head against An Nanjing’s face!

Snowy was naturally not afraid! Who had he ever feared? She had so many Divine Treasures, lackeys, and both Yang Ye and An Nanjing!

Most importantly, she had Tian Xiu!

Tian Xiu had promised to protect her! And Tian Xiu was very, very strong!

In short, Snowy felt that she was very, very safe!

Meanwhile, A’Leng walked over to An Nanjing, glanced at the latter, and said, “Miss An, why allow yourself to be swept into all of this? Your future is absolutely promising with what you have!”

An Nanjing looked A’Leng in the eyes, “Because I like it!”

A’Leng gazed at An Nanjing for a long time before she shook her head and smiled, “Do as you wish!”

She gazed at Yang Ye, “Young Master Yang, I hope we’ll meet again! Good luck!”

Yang Ye didn’t say anything and just left with Snowy and An Nanjing.

Once they left, A’Leng suddenly spoke softly, “The Martial God Physique, she…”

Suddenly, Left Sword seemed hesitant to speak, “Young Miss…”

A’Leng asked, “What is it?”

She hesitated for quite some time before she said, “Are Young Master Yang and Miss An really strong?”

A’Leng nodded, “Very strong. If I’m not wrong, that Young Master Yang is intentionally suppressing his cultivation. The longer he does that, the more terrifying it would be when it finally erupts. Not to mention the future, even now, ordinary Three World Realm experts can’t harm him. As for Miss An…”

A’Leng’s eyes narrowed slightly, “The Martial God Physique! Her physique is one of the ten great physiques just like mine! So, what do you think?”

Left Sword seemed quite hesitant like she had more to say.

A’Leng frowned slightly, “What is it?”

Left Sword lowered her head slightly and said, “Young Miss, Right Sword told the Eldest Young Master about the Primordial Violet Energy, and they said that if you don’t use force to get it, they will once Young Master Yang and Miss An leave!”

“How dare she!” A’Leng suddenly shouted with fury.

Left Sword’s face turned pale, and she immediately fell to her knees.

A’Leng glanced at Left Sword and looked up at the sky, “I hope we get there in time! Senior Heaven and Senior Earth, come with me.”

Her figure vanished on the spot.

…

Once they left Divine Martial City, it didn’t take long for Yang Ye and An Nanjing to stop abruptly.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

A young man was standing not too far ahead of them, and there was also a woman and a robust man.

Yang Ye recognized the woman and the robust man, because they were Right Sword and the Three World Realm expert, A’Da!

Yang Ye gazed at the young man, and the latter spoke indifferently, “I want the Primordial Violet Energy you have, so please give it to me.”

Yang Ye asked, “Is this A’Leng’s doing?”

The man looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “You don’t have much time. Three breaths of time. If you don’t hand it over in three breaths of time, then you can leave your lives behind!”

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s figure appeared above the young man, and a ray of sword energy slashed down from above him!

Three swings with the Sword Domain!

The young man’s expression changed drastically, but his reaction was absolutely swift. He’d formed a seal with both hands at the instant Yang Ye’s sword descended, and then a powerful yellow ray of light surged out of him.

Bang!

An explosion resounded. The yellow light exploded apart immediately, and the young man was blasted over 1km away!

As soon as he stopped himself, his pupils constricted while he instinctively dodged to the side.

Hiss!

While he’d moved away, his right hand had been chopped off by a flying sword!

Right Sword’s face turned pale from the sight of this.

The robust man was about to attack when a spear tore through the air. A vicious glow flashed through his eyes as he swung his right hand forward. In an instant, a thick and long iron chain slammed against the spear.

Bang!

The world shook violently!

Suddenly, An Nanjing appeared before him, and then she whipped her leg at him.

The robust man didn’t dodge and slammed his palm at her kick instead!

A head-on collision!

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and then the robust man was slammed over 300m away!

A moment later, a spear instantly arrived before him!

The robust man shouted with fury and slammed his fist forward.

Bang!

He was blasted away once more. Meanwhile, An Nanjing soundlessly appeared before him…

Suppression!

As soon as they fought, the Three World Realm expert was suppressed by An Nanjing!

Meanwhile, after he sliced off the young man’s arm, Yang Ye didn’t stop. His figure transformed into a ray of light that shot at the young man.

The young man was horrified and hurriedly withdrew a green shield. However, it shattered as soon as it came into contact with Yang Ye’s sword. A moment later, the sword descended and pressed against his forehead.

The sword didn’t stop and was about to pierce into the young man’s forehead when a voice resounded, “Brother Yang, please show mercy!”

The sword stopped!

Yang Ye turned around, and he saw a woman walking over slowly. It was A’Leng, and an old man and an old woman were behind her.

A’Leng walked swiftly over to Yang Ye, glanced at the young man, and then cupped her fist at Yang Ye, “Brother Yang, I’m sorry about this.”

Yang Ye ignored A’Leng and looked to the side. An Nanjing and the robust man were still fighting, but at this moment, he was being completely suppressed and was without the ability to fight back!

His defeat was just a matter of time!

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and looked at A’Leng, “Miss A’Leng, I need an explanation!”

She laughed bitterly, “I’m sorry, they came here because of me. So, allow me to apologize. I hope you’ll give me face and let them go!”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a long time and was about to lower his sword. However, the young man suddenly spoke angrily, “A’Leng, who does he think he is? What right does he have to make you speak like that?”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “I’m telling you, we’re taking the Primordial Violet Energy. If you refuse to hand it over, then you and everyone close to you will die a graveless death. You…”

Hiss!

The young man’s voice stopped abruptly!

A sword had pierced his forehead!

A'Leng’s eyes narrowed slightly while the atmosphere instantly became tense.

Yang Ye sheathed his sword!

Yang Ye gazed at A’Leng and grinned, “Sorry, Miss A’Leng, I won't be giving you face today. Do you have a problem with that?”
