Chapter 2682 – Tu!

Meanwhile, Snowy patted Past Life. She was telling it to stay quiet and don’t disturb them.

Past Life fell completely silent.

It had been in the Primordial Pagoda for some time, so it knew very well who these two little devils were.

It was a Super Divine Treasure, and practically nothing in this world could harm it. However, these two little fellows just happened to be exceptions!

It couldn’t afford to offend them!

Meanwhile, Snowy waved her paws again.

A long time later, Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “Little fellows, go back inside. Don’t worry, I’ve figured some things out.”

He placed the Divine Crystal in Snowy’s paw, “Trust me, I’ll be fine.”

Snowy immediately jumped into Yang Ye’s arms when she saw that he was refusing to use spirit energy, and she kept rubbing her head against him.

Erya lowered her head slightly and no one knew what she was thinking.

Yang Ye hurriedly grabbed Erya’s hand and spoke softly, “Erya, you should be aware that I’m training here, and I’m confident. So, don’t do anything rash!”

Erya’s temper was growing worse with every passing day, so he was quite afraid. Because once her temper flared, she was capable of anything!

Erya glanced at Yang Ye, and her eyes were slightly scarlet, but they gradually cleared up.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief from the sight of this.

Erya glanced at the surroundings. In the end, she patted Snowy’s head and spoke softly, “Let’s trust him. He’ll be fine!”

Around an hour later, Erya finally succeeded at persuading Snowy to return to the Primordial Pagoda.

But the two little fellows were still worried, and they just watched Yang Ye from the Ascension Platform.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye glanced at his body, it was covered in injuries. Fortunately, his body was very strong. Moreover, it had a certain level of self-healing ability. Of course, it was nothing compared to the Primordial Violet Energy!

After all, even an ordinary person would recover from shallow injuries in a few days!

Two days later, Yang Ye’s injuries were much better, and he walked toward the wooden figures again.

He didn’t use the Divine Crystal. Not because Snowy and Erya were wrong, they were actually correct. He was certain that he could heal with Divine Crystals.

But he didn’t choose to do so in the end!

Because he wanted to push himself!

He wanted to really push himself this time!

Under the circumstance that he couldn’t use Divine Crystals, he had to try his best to avoid injuries and seriously consider every attack!

Yang Ye arrived within the hall again, and the three wooden figures were before him.

Right when he was about to walk over, footsteps came from outside the hall!

Yang Ye was shocked and turned around quickly. A woman was walking in slowly from outside!

She wore a grayish white robe with a hemp rope around her waist. A grayish white wine gourd hung there on the rope, and it was covered in many marks. It seemed really old!

Her hair was very short and only extended slightly below her ears.

As for her appearance, it wasn’t drop-dead gorgeous, but she wasn’t ugly either.

Besides that, she was wearing a pair of straw sandals. Each one of them had two pure white flower patterns on them. The flowers were very strange!

Yang Ye was visibly vigilant, or it should be said that he seemed like he was facing a formidable opponent!

Yang Ye was clearly her target. She just walked over to Yang Ye and asked, “Your name is Yang Ye?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Senior…”Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

She interrupted him, “I heard you’re very arrogant?”

Yang Ye hurriedly shook his head, “Of course not. I keep an absolutely low profile!”

She grinned, “Is that so?”

Yang Ye quickly nodded.

Meanwhile, she pointed at his chest, “Remember, my name is Tu. I slaughter the heavens and the gods. Now, I’m here to beat you up!”

She suddenly slammed a punch at his chest.

Yang Ye was ready, and he’d swung his sword the instant she attacked.

Meanwhile, she suddenly relaxed her fist and squeezed lightly. She squeezed down upon Past Life, and then Yang Ye noticed Past Life was out of his grasp.

The woman squeezed down a little more, and then Past Life was instantly bent and sounded like it was cracking!

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

She shook her head slightly and casually tossed the sword into the ground.

The sword shook madly…

She gazed at Yang Ye and swung a punch. Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically as he moved sideways to dodge it. However, her punch still slammed down against his chest!

A mouthful of blood sprayed from Yang Ye, and then his figure was flying. He flew all the way out of the ruins and arrived in the desert from before.

She took a step forward in the hall, and she was in front of Yang Ye.

In the desert.

She grabbed Yang Ye by the shoulder and then kicked him in the stomach.

Bam!

Yang Ye was kicked away, and he was back in the hall when he finally crashed to the ground.

It just happened to be the exact spot from where he’d been kicked away earlier!

Suddenly, Erya shot up into the air from within the pagoda.

Outside the pagoda, the woman glanced at Yang Ye’s stomach and pressed her right hand down lightly.

Bang!

Erya crashed down from the air and slammed onto the Ascension Platform. At the same time, a strand of mysterious energy had locked down the entire pagoda!

They could see everything that was happening outside, but they couldn’t go outside anymore!

Outside the pagoda.

The woman gazed at Yang Ye, and then she slammed a punch at his stomach.

A few mouthfuls of blood sprayed from Yang Ye as his figure was blasted away once more.

His figure was like a cooked prawn that had curled up completely!

Bang!

Yang Ye crashed into the desert again. As soon as he crashed there, the short-haired woman was in front of him again…

Just like that, he was blasted back and forth countless times until he finally lost consciousness.

At the entrance to the dilapidated hall, Yang Ye laid there like a corpse, and the short-haired woman was just seated there on the stone stairs by his side. She had her figure rested against the stairs while one of her legs was crossed over the other. She was watching the sunset in the distance while frequently gulping down from her wine gourd.

The sky gradually dimmed.

Meanwhile, the short-haired woman stood up and glanced at Yang Ye’s unconscious figure. She said, “I heard there’s a very arrogant sword cultivator. I have to go look for him. So, we’ll end things here for today. I’ll come see you again next time.”

She walked off into the distance.

The woman’s figure gradually vanished beneath the setting sun. Meanwhile, a song could be heard from afar, “Oh, heavens high above! Oh, gods of man! Why are all of you so weak…?”
