Chapter 2229 – Sword Core!

A short while later, Yang Ye walked out of the hall, and An Nanjing was by his side.

She glanced at Ding Shaoyao and remained silent.

“Let’s go!” Ding Shaoyao vanished once she finished speaking.

A moment later, Yang Ye and An Nanjing followed her.

Meanwhile, in the hall, Yang Lianshuang spoke softly, “What is the god race trying to do?”

“Don’t worry!” Elder Yuan smiled, “No matter what they are trying to do, both of them won’t be in danger.”

Yang Lianshuang gazed at Elder Yuan, “Why?”

Elder Yuan looked out of the hall, “Because regardless of whether it’s the undying race or the god race, they’ll have to pay a terrible price to kill the two of them. It’s a price that both sides don’t want to pay. Moreover, Miss Ding used to be friends with Yang Ye, so I believe she won’t harm him.”

Yang Lianshuang said, “But the god race is most important to her!”

Elder Yuan nodded and spoke softly, “That’s what I admire the most. In the face of the race’s interests, her own feelings should be put aside. Just because we like someone, we can’t just disregard our family for that person, right?”

Yang Lianshuang gazed at Elder Yuan, “Where I come from, many people do that. When they lose their loved ones, despair and sorrow filled them, and so they choose to end their own lives. But they never consider that all the pain and sadness would be passed on to their parents!”

Elder Yuan shook his head, “How immature!”

Yang Lianshuang replied, “It’s immature indeed!”

Meanwhile, Elder Yuan glanced at Yang Lianshuang, “Where are you from?”

Yang Lianshuang pondered deeply for a moment and replied, “A very far away place. It’s much more peaceful than this place.”

Elder Yuan asked, “Will the undying race go there?”

She thought for a moment and replied, “I don’t think so. It’s too far away. Moreover, the people there are very weak. So, unless the undying race searches intentionally, they wouldn’t even notice that place. After all, even spirit energy is pitiably scarce there.”

Elder Yuan nodded and left without saying a word!

Yang Lianshuang frowned slightly, “The undying race wouldn’t go there, right?”

…

Yang Ye and An Nanjing followed Ding Shaoyao’s group to the God Realm. At this moment, it was concealed by a mysterious formation. So, if it wasn’t for Ding Shaoyao leading the way, he wouldn’t be able to notice its presence even if he stood before it.

Upon entering the God Realm, Yang Ye noticed that it was filled with a solemn aura.

Obviously, the undying race felt like a huge problem for even the god race.

Ding Shaoyao and Zhi’er led them to a hall, and just a middle aged man was there.

Shi Tian!

The middle aged man was the patriarch of the god race, Shi Tian.

Shi Tian gazed at Yang Ye, and then his gaze paused on An Nanjing before he gazed at Yang Ye again, “What do you think about the undying race?”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “Just get to the point. Since the god race wants to form an alliance, I’m really curious about what kind of alliance it will be!”

Shi Tian looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “There must be a commander when two armies go to war. While we’re allied, I have the right to command your forces. Do you have a problem with that?”

Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes and looked straight at Shi Tian, and his eyes were blood red.

Yang Ye said, “Why?”

Shi Tian said, “Because my god race is stronger than you!”

Ding Shaoyao frowned slightly when she heard Shi Tian.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly chuckled, “The god race is stronger than us? Patriarch Shi Tian, where are you getting the confidence to say that?”

Shi Tian spoke indifferently, “So there’s no room for discussion?”

Yang Ye grinned, “Indeed!”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away. An Nanjing didn’t hesitate to follow him.

However, Yang Ye stopped after taking a few steps, and he said, “Patriarch Shi Tian, this formation of yours is powerful, and it’s hidden very well. However, allow me to be honest. Do you think it can keep you concealed from the undying race?”

Shi Tian replied indifferently, “Perhaps all of you would be dead before they even find us.”

Yang Ye chuckled, “The undying race won’t target me first!”

“Is that so?” Shi Tian continued, “Are you that sure?” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Yang Ye replied, “They’ve tried twice, but what was the outcome?”

Shi Tian said, “If you didn’t have help from someone, everyone in Void Spirit Continent, including you, would be dead now!”

Yang Ye looked Shi Tian in the eyes, “So you do know that I have help! I thought you didn’t!”

Shi Tian frowned slightly when he heard this. Yang Ye’s tone really displeased him.

However, Yang Ye ignored him and just walked away.

Shi Tian suddenly said, “The two of you are all alone here right now!”

It was obvious that it was a threat.

Yang Ye stopped, gazed at An Nanjing, and said, “Jing’er, how many can you kill while I’m sparring with Patriarch Shi Tian?”

An Nanjing pondered deeply for a moment and said, “All the Sages!”

Yang Ye shrugged and gazed at Shi Tian, “Patriarch Shi Tian, do you want to give it a try?”

All the Sages!

So long as Yang Ye was keeping Shi Tian busy, An Nanjing could definitely kill all the Sages here. Now, even a progenitor couldn’t stop her. While she wasn’t at the Progenitor Realm, her strength was sufficient to kill one!

Besides experts on the Unfettered One and Void Spirit Maiden’s level, there were practically few in this world who could best An Nanjing in a one on one battle!

The atmosphere in the hall became quite tense.

Shi Tian gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and was about to speak when Ding Shaoyao spoke abruptly, “How about we do this? Let’s not obey each other, and we’ll stay as equals and make decisions through discussions. Presently, the undying race seems to be doing something, and so this period of time is our chance. If we fight each other now, I’m sure the undying race will be the happiest. What do you think?”

Shi Tian glanced at Ding Shaoyao and didn’t say anything.

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Miss Ding, can you still make decisions in the god race?”

Ding Shaoyao gazed at Shi Tian, and the latter fell silent for a long time before he said, “Approved!”

Regardless of whether he wanted to admit it, Yang Ye and An Nanjing weren’t existences that he could annihilate with ease. But for the sake of the god race, he had to join forces with Yang Ye. Only then would they have a chance to survive!

Otherwise, the moment the undying race’s army arrived would be the moment the god race was annihilated.

Ding Shaoyao nodded slightly and gazed at Yang Ye, “My god race will send someone to meet with Miss Yang Lianshuang and Elder Yuan to discuss how we arrange and deploy our forces against the undying race. However, before that, I hope we can make a deal with you. A deal that will benefit everyone.”

Yang Ye asked, “What deal?”

“Primordial Violet Energy and spirit energy!” Ding Shaoyao looked him in the eyes, “Patriarch Shi Tian hasn’t recovered completely, and he needs Primordial Violet Energy to do it. Besides that, my God Realm has a formation here, but we don’t have sufficient spirit energy to activate it. We hope to gain Snowy’s help to do that.”

Yang Ye asked, “And what can you offer in exchange?”

Ding Shaoyao glanced at An Nanjing, “Besides Elysium, the Wargod of my god race had two other things. I think that Miss An’s strength will definitely rise tremendously if she obtains them!”

An Nanjing gazed at Ding Shaoyao, and the latter said, “Please come with me!”

She turned around and walked away.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing followed her.

Meanwhile, Shi Tian remained silent in the hall, and no one knew what he was thinking.

Zhi’er said, “Father, that’s how he is.”

Shi Tian shook his head slightly, “It’s normal for the strong to have a temper. I’m thinking about the god race’s future! Actually, all those years ago, I wanted to make peace with the other races and the four paths, but it was too late when I took over as patriarch. Our god race lost that battle, and now that we’ve returned, we have to face the undying race. That race…”

Zhi’er asked softly, “Father, how much do you know about them?”

Shi Tian replied softly, “I know a little. All those years ago, the void spirit race was stronger than my god race at our primes, yet they were still annihilated by the god race!”

Shi Tian took a deep breath, “We have to prepare a way out for our race.”

Zhi’er gazed at him with astonishment, “Father, you…”

Shi Tian replied softly, “No matter what, the god race cannot go extinct here!”

…

Yang Ye and An Nanjing followed Ding Shaoyao to a room, and there were two things in it.

One of them was a shield. It was square and pitch black. The head of a ferocious beast was at its front, and numerous mysterious symbols were at its back. The symbols emanated a horrifying aura.

Yang Ye asked, “What’s that?”

“Elyzium!” Ding Shaoyao spoke solemnly, “One of the precious treasures of the god race. It’s impenetrable, and even progenitors cannot destroy it.”

Meanwhile, An Nanjing shook her head, “I do not need defense!”

Ding Shaoyao smiled, “It’s a shield of war, so it isn’t used defensively. It’s used to attack! Or to be more precise, it can be used both offensively and defensively.”

An Nanjing didn’t say a word. She just waved her right hand, and the shield descended before her. An Nanjing took it in her grasp. In an instant, the shield shook violently, but An Nanjing remained unmoved. She just gazed at the shield, but she squeezed down harder and harder. A short while later, the shield calmed down.

Ding Shaoyao glanced at her, and then she gazed at the second thing, “This is Elyxium. Miss An, you’re fond of close quarter combat, so it’s perfect for you. As for what these bracers can do, you can slowly study it later!”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “You possess all sorts of divine treasures, so you wouldn’t even want the treasures of my god race. However, there’s something that may arouse your interest!”

Yang Ye asked, “What?”

Ding Shaoyao said, “The Sword Core.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “The Sword Core?”

Ding Shaoyao explained softly, “There is the Sword Heart, sword intent, and Sword Soul, so the Sword Core naturally exists too. If you possess it, then besides those few experts, no one else in this world will be able to harm you. Even our patriarch wouldn’t be able to harm you!”
