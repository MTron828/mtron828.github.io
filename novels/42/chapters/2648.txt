Chapter 2649 – Past Life is Yours!

Outside the door, the woman in white sat on the rock while the sword, Past Life, remained in her grasp.

She just slid it past the surface of the water while her gaze was utterly calm.

Meanwhile, an old man with a bamboo chest on his back appeared nearby.

The old man glanced at the door and asked, “Isn’t it a little too early?”

She grinned, “Not at all. After all, we too don’t have much time left.”

The old man fell silent.

She said, “I hope he doesn’t disappoint me. Otherwise, I don’t have any other choice!”nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The old man spoke softly, “If he really satisfies you…”

She smiled, “That’s a very good thing.”

The old man sighed softly and didn’t say another word.

Meanwhile, behind the door.

Yang Ye walked forward slowly while his gaze was slightly blank, and he stopped after walking for some time.

There was a scene before him again.

It was Zi’er!

In a forest, a violet shadow flashed past him. A moment later, the violet shadow returned to him, and it was a violet little fellow.

The little fellow gazed at Yang Ye for a while, and then it entered the Primordial Pagoda.

A slight grin appeared on Yang Ye’s face when he witnessed this.

After that, it was An Nanjing, Snowy, the women of Nether Pavilion…

He saw everyone who’d once been in his life.

He really missed it!

He missed it all!

Meanwhile, the woman in white appeared by Yang Ye’s side.

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she said, “This is the border of the Four Dimensional Universe.’

Yang Ye asked, “What do you mean?”

She smiled, “I mean you can change everything here, even the future.”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and she continued, “If you want, you can change your mother’s fate, your fathers too. In this place, you can reverse the past and the future.”

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “Is this a test?”

She grinned, “Sort of.”

Yang Ye said, “If I know it’s a test, what’s the point of it?”

She replied, “Try it!”

Yang Ye gazed at her and remained silent.

She smiled and didn’t say a word.

A long time later, Yang Ye shook his head, “I want to go back!”

She gazed at him, and Yang Ye said, “Can I go back?”

She pointed ahead, “If you continue forward, you can see your future and even the future of the Three Dimensional Universe. At that time, you can do many, many things. Like learn how to deal with the people of the End World or be mentally prepared for what is to come.”

Yang Ye said, “You want me to continue forward?”

She smiled, “Just a few more steps away, you can see what will happen to you in the end. Is that not a good thing?”

Yang Ye looked up into the distance, and a scene appeared there. It was his current conversation with the woman, and it was just slightly slower than what was happening right now. If he took just a step forward, he could see what would happen next.

The future?

Yang Ye shook his head, “While I’m quite curious, I know that I’ll definitely die if I go forward.”

A trace of disappointment appeared in her eyes.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “Moreover, knowing the future isn’t that good.”

She gazed at him and he smiled, “I think the meaning in life is that the future is full of possibilities. If I know what the future holds, what is the point of living now?”

He wasn’t fond of that feeling. That feeling where everything was predetermined. If he knew a lot about his own future, he would do many things that would go against his current thoughts.

Was that a good thing?

No!

As far as he was concerned, it wasn’t. Because he wouldn’t be the same person anymore.

It was like if he could change the future now, what about his past self? Would he have killed his past self? All of these things were in the past, and instead of caring about that, it was better to take care of the people he had right now.

She gazed at Yang Ye in silence.

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Of course, my intuition tells me that going further will definitely lead to something bad. That’s my true thoughts.”

She gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before she stretched out her hand, and then Executor flew into her grasp. She pressed her index and middle fingers together before swiping Executor gently with them.

Executor shook violently.

A sword howl resounded through this boundless border before the Four Dimensional Universe, and then the tip of Executor appeared before Yang Ye!

It had a tip now!

The woman spoke softly, “Heaven Executor! It can only be called Heaven Executor when it has its tip.”

She passed it over to Yang Ye while she spoke.

Yang Ye accepted it and asked, “Why? Because I didn’t continue forward?”

She grinned, “No.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Then why?”

The woman smiled, “The past, present, and future. You didn’t choose your past because you knew it was in the past. You didn’t choose the future because the future is unknown to you. Since it’s unknown, there are possibilities. While your fate isn’t predetermined, the future is full of possibilities. Simply speaking, you’re still the same person.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t really understand.”

She said, “The Destiny Realm. It’s a realm I named…”

She shook her head, “You don’t have to know about that now. You’ll find out when the time is right.”

Yang Ye asked, “One last question. Why did the Desolate Emperor die?”

She smiled, “He chose to pry into the future, and then he was killed by some existences.”

“Some existences?” Yang Ye glanced at her, “You didn’t do it?”

She chuckled, “If I wanted to kill him, why would I have to go to such lengths? He may be strong, but he can’t resist a few swings of my sword.”

Yang Ye was stunned.

She asked, “Shall we go?”

Yang Ye said, “I have another question. My master… Chen Xuanan…”

She replied softly, “I have a vague memory of him. I think he chose the past. Unfortunately, he hadn’t cherished it, and what’s lost always remains in the past. But because of those feelings he displayed, I decided to save him. Unfortunately, I failed to fully save him.”

She waved her right hand, and the book in Yang Ye’s Primordial Pagoda appeared in her hands, “Remember, the Grand Dao always leaves space for one to escape it. Actually, everyone is that “one”. However, whether you can grab that is up to you.”

She waved her right hand, and then she vanished on the spot with Yang Ye.

By the river.

Yang Ye walked side by side with the woman in white, and she said, “Let me tell you about my other forms. You’ve met my form that wears a black dress. She’s irritable, reticent, and her sword is called Phantom. It’s a very formidable sword. If you encounter her, be careful. It’s best if you don’t come into contact with her while you’re at this level of strength. As for the other two… Hmm, let me tell you about Heaven Executor’s master.”

She suddenly shook her head and smiled, “There doesn’t seem to be anything to say. Because if you do encounter them, the consequences won’t be very good.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

The woman stopped and flipped her palm, and a sword appeared in her grasp.

It was Past Life!

She passed it to Yang Ye, “This sword has the power of Past Life. The soul of anyone it cuts will instantly vanish from the world. It isn’t just humans, any sprite that touches it will vanish from the world. Of course, that isn’t absolute. There are some existences who are quite formidable. For example, Qi Bitian from all those years ago. She forcefully resisted the power of Past Life within my sword.”

Yang Ye glanced at her, “You’re giving this to me?”

She nodded, “I am.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “H-How can I accept this…?”

While he said that, he didn’t hesitate to take it from her.

After all, only an idiot would actually refuse it!

Once he took the sword, Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “I will kill people with it.”

She smiled and didn’t say anything.

Yang Ye glanced at her, “Er, you seem to be a little too good to me. I’m not very used to this.”

She blinked, “Am I?”

Yang Ye had quite a weird expression on his face. He kept having the feeling that she was scheming something.

She’d explained things to him and given him her sword. It made him wonder if she’d fallen for him!

She asked, “Why? You don’t want it?”

Yang Ye hurriedly shook his head, “I want it, of course I want it.”

She grinned, “Then go on. It’s time for you to leave.”

Yang Ye glanced at her and left. He suddenly stopped after walking for a while, and he said, “Regardless of what your reasons are, thank you.”

He transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

Once Yang Ye left, the old man with a bamboo chest appeared nearby.

The old man with the bamboo chest had quite a complicated expression on his face, “Your kindest form chose a fellow who has peak slaughter intent…”

She spoke softly, “It can’t be helped. I don’t have much time left, and the people of this world are so good at causing trouble!”

The old man spoke solemnly, “That one?”

She nodded slightly.

The old man sighed softly, “True. Since we cannot create new life in peace, it will start with destruction! That fellow may not be good at many things, but causing trouble and killing is something he’s very good at!”

Yang Ye shot through the sky on his sword.

There was a sword by his waist, and there was another on his back!

One was Heaven Executor, and the other was Past Life!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive at the End Dimension.

Yang Ye traveled toward the End World, and it didn’t take long for him to arrive at the teleportation formation which led to the End World.

A ferocious grin curled up on his face, “Kids, your grandpa is here to send you to your next life!”
