Chapter 1490 - The Nether Pavilion?

Translator: InVader

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye raised the casket lid and slammed it at Demon Wu.

The intent to kill filled Demon Wu’s eyes. He didn’t waste his breath at all, and he just immediately clenched his right fist and slammed it against Yang Ye’s casket lid.

Boom!

The space here instantly trembled violently, and then both of them were blasted flying.

Yang Ye stopped after flying 300m away while Demon Wu stopped after flying a little over 200m away.

Based on what had just happened, it seemed like Yang Ye was at a disadvantage!

However, Demon Wu’s face had become solemn, and he stared at Yang Ye, “You’ve attained the Semi-Deity Realm!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I just did. Surprised?”

“A Semi-Deity is still an ant!” Demon Wu spoke fiercely, and then he appeared in front of Yang Ye before slamming his fist towards Yang Ye again.

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath. He just raised the casket lid and swung!

Boom!

Both of them were blasted away again, but it only took a moment for them to charge at each other once more.

It didn’t take long for explosions to resound incessantly here.

They were locked in fierce combat, but not one of them could gain the upper hand over the other.

Around two hours later, both of them stopped.

Demon Wu gazed at Yang Ye with an extremely unsightly expression on his face. Because he noticed that he couldn’t do anything to Yang Ye. The energy of Yin and Yang was much stronger than Yang Ye’s physical body. Even if Yang Ye had the casket lid to shield himself, the energy of Yin and Yang could still injure Yang Ye. However, he’d noticed something about Yang Ye which was even more terrifying than the casket lid.

It was Yang Ye’s recovery!

Yang Ye’s recovery was too terrifying. Yang Ye had clearly been injured during the battle, but it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to be completely fine again!

Demon Wu felt powerless!

He felt truly powerless!

During the last battle, his frenzied attacks could heavily injure Yang Ye, yet now, he couldn’t heavily injure Yang Ye anymore. Besides the tremendous increase in Yang Ye’s strength, there were two other reasons. Firstly, the casket lid was truly too strong. Secondly, Yang Ye’s recovery was too swift!

Demon Wu gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then his figure flashed and vanished on the spot.

If this continued, then even if he could kill Yang Ye, he would be forcefully crippled in the battle. If that happened in this place, it would be no different than bringing death upon him. So, he’d decisively chosen to leave. There was no deep-rooted enmity between them. In the end, it was only because Yang Ye had stopped him from killing Lian Banzhuang, and that was why he’d aroused the intent to kill Yang Ye!

If he could kill Yang Ye and only pay a small price, then he wouldn’t mind it. Yet now, he was very well aware that he had to pay an extremely heavy price to kill Yang Ye. It was clearly not worth it to do that. So, he’d chosen to leave.

Yang Ye didn’t chase after Demon Wu. Because it was pointless. Demon Wu couldn’t kill him, and he couldn’t kill Demon Wu. A gap still existed between his current strength and the strength of a Dualism Realm expert. However, that gap could be closed with the casket lid. Dualism Realm experts couldn’t kill him while he had the casket lid to defend himself!

However, he couldn’t kill Dualism Realm experts as well!

Even if he used the Rebirth Sword, he still wouldn’t be able to kill Demon Wu. Unless he attained the Deity Realm and executed the Rebirth Sword, or was able to overlap more Heavenrends, then perhaps he might be able to kill Demon Wu. Even if he failed to kill Demon Wu, he could still pose a threat to Demon Wu!

Yet now, he still couldn’t. All he could do now was protect his own life. But he was very satisfied with that. Presently, he was only a Semi-Deity, but Dualism Realm experts couldn’t do anything to him. That was extremely heaven defying. After all, there were an entire two realms of cultivation between him and the Dualism Realm!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, glanced at the surroundings, and then vanished towards the distance.

He didn’t have to worry about his lifespan anymore, so his next goal was to leave this place.

His goal was to return to Clouds of Heaven Continent, and then head to the large world to look for Zi’er and Snowy!

Yang Ye sped up, but he didn’t travel out in the open. He used the Sword Domain to conceal himself. The Sword Domain improved along with his realm of cultivation. He was a Semi-Deity now, so the Sword Domain had naturally improved as well. Now, unless a Dualism Realm expert searched explicitly for him, even Dualism Realm experts couldn’t detect his presence!

Yang Ye ran for a while, and then he suddenly stopped. He glanced at the surroundings and said, “Show yourself!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a woman suddenly appeared not too far away from Yang Ye.

She was none other than Lian Banzhuang.

Yang Ye frowned, “You’re following me?”

She replied with a question, “You’re heading to that door?”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “How did you know?!” At this moment, he was rather surprised because Little Sky had told him about that door, but he hadn’t expected Lian Banzhuang to know about it as well.

She replied, “No one here doesn’t know about it!”

Yang Ye asked, “What do you mean?”

She replied, “This place isn’t huge. After staying here for so long, everything here can’t escape our notice. That door is the same. But do you know why none of us head there even if we know it exists?”

Yang Ye asked, “Someone is guarding it?”

She shook her head, “You’re only partially correct. It isn’t a person that’s guarding it, it’s the…”

She looked him in the eyes and continued, “It’s the Eye of the Heaven Dao, the Eye of the Heaven Dao that’s on par with the large world. An Eye of the Heaven Dao that can even kill Rebirth Realm experts!”

The Eye of the Heaven Dao! Yang Ye’s pupils constricted. It’s protected by an Eye of the Heaven Dao that can even kill Rebirth Realm experts! No wonder Little Sky said I would die.

It was an existence that could even kill Rebirth Realm experts, so how could he avoid death? But he was also puzzled by how Little Sky had left this place all those years ago!

Meanwhile, Lian Banzhuang said, “Even though our individual strength isn’t sufficient to break open the space here, it isn’t a problem for us if we join forces. However, we don’t. Because if we dare to do that, then the Eye of the Heaven Dao would appear. But our strength isn’t sufficient to resist that Eye of the Heaven Dao which can even kill Rebirth Realm experts!”

Yang Ye said, “I’m really quite curious. Why have all of you been imprisoned here?”

She fell silent for a long time and said, “Greed!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Lian Banzhuang shook her head, “If you intend to leave through that door, you can forget it. Now that you don’t have to worry about your lifespan, you can cultivate here instead. Based on your natural talent and strength, it will only take a few years for you to be able to leave by force. At that time, even the Eye of the Heaven Dao would dare not stop you!”

Yang Ye asked, “Like the Unfettered One?”

She nodded, “All those years ago, even the Eye of the Heaven Dao feared him. Your natural talent isn’t inferior to him, so if you’re given a few years, you can accomplish that as well. Yet now, you can’t even endure the pressure emanated by that Eye of the Heaven Dao!”

“I don’t have time to waste here!” Yang Ye shook his head. He had many things left to do. Waste a few years here? He couldn’t afford to!

Lian Banzhuang said, “You won’t be able to get past that door!”

Yang Ye smiled, “You can achieve anything if you try. No matter what, thank you for the warning.”

Yang Ye continued forward once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye walked for a while, and then he suddenly stopped. Because he noticed that she was following him. He turned to look at her, “What are you doing?”

She replied, “I want to see how you try and achieve it!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment, and then he continued forward. Actually, he had no way to pass through the door. However, he’d still decided to go have a look. He believed that everything would fall into place! There were many things that seemed to be impossible, but once one really tried to face those things, one would notice that there were quite a few methods to resolve the problem.

Meanwhile, Lian Banzhuang asked, “You’ve comprehended a Domain?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Yang Ye nodded. He had no intention to conceal that.

Lian Banzhuang glanced at him and said, “I’ve only met three people who’ve comprehended Domains. You’re the third. Needless to say, all of you are extraordinary geniuses. Truly extraordinary geniuses.”

Yang Ye smiled, “One of them is me, the other should be the Unfettered One. What about the last one?”

Lian Banzhuang’s face became extremely solemn when she heard him. She was about to speak when the thick smell of blood appeared around them.

Lian Banzhuang and Yang Ye’s expressions immediately changed. A moment later, both of their bodies were suddenly immobilized. After that, their veins started to bulge as if they were about to explode.

Lian Banzhuang suddenly cried out with shock, “Crap! This is her territory!”

Yang Ye gazed at Lian Banzhuang, “Who?”

Lian Banzhuang’s face was ghastly pale while a wisp of bitterness arose on the corners of her mouth, “Remember the other person I told you about? Besides the Unfettered One, there’s another person from the outside world who can leave this place. However, for some unknown reason, she hasn’t left, and she has been staying here. The place she resides became a forbidden area here. I never expected that we would have entered that area…”

As she finished speaking, her voice was filled with despair.

Yang Ye paid no attention to Lian Banzhuang. He just madly circulated his sword intent and slaughter intent to resist the mysterious energy. However, he noticed that both of his intents weren’t able to let him return to normal.

Meanwhile, Lian Banzhuang suddenly spoke bitterly, “Don’t bother. You asked me who the third person was, that person is the person who’s attacking us right now. As soon as she arrived here all those years ago, she immediately killed the strongest person here and absorbed that person’s blood. At that time, we witnessed the strength of her Domain. The Blood Domain. She has grasped a Domain called the Blood Domain, and she calls herself the Blood Maiden.”

The Blood Maiden? Yang Ye who was trying to resist the mysterious energy around him was suddenly stunned.
