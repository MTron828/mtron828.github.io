Chapter 2334 – Everyone in this City Dies!

Leave the Primordial Pagoda behind!

Bai Zhixian’s face fell when she heard the old man. Yang Ye needed the Primordial Pagoda the most. If he lost it, his injuries would take much, much longer to heal!

The Primordial Pagoda could absolutely not be given away!

Bai Zhixian gazed at Jian You.

Jian You glanced at the old man and said, “Are you sure?”

The old man grinned, “If it wasn’t because of your Jian Clan, I wouldn’t just ask for the Primordial Pagoda. After all, we never leave potential troubles behind when we do things. However, since the Jian Clan has stepped forward, I still have to give you some face. Leave the Primordial Pagoda behind and you can leave! That’s the biggest concession I’m willing to make!”

Suddenly, Jian You walked slowly toward the old man.

The old man frowned from the sight of this.

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded, and then a ray of sword energy flashed. An instant later, a huge sword slammed down from above the old man.

Jian You had attacked!

Crack!

As soon as it descended a huge expanse of space with them at the center collapsed, and then countless rays of sword energy flashed out from there.

Sword energy filled the sky!

The old man’s eyes instantly turned icy cold when he saw her attack, and then he twisted his right hand. In an instant, his entire right arm was covered in a thick layer of black scales, and then he raised it against her sword energy.

Clang!

An ear piercing explosion resounded, and the old man was pushed over 300m back. But before he could even stop himself, Jian You had appeared in front of him again, and then another attack slammed down upon him.

Overwhelming strength!

The strength this attack carried was at least double the last one!

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he waved his right hand horizontally, causing a wave of powerful force to ripple out like an erupting volcano.

Boom!

Along with an explosion, the entire sky exploded. At the same time, two figures were blasted away. But it didn’t take long for Jian You to stop, and then she appeared before the old man once more. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The old man’s expression changed from the sight of this.

Jian You took her sword in both hands and slammed it down, causing a wave of sword energy to ripple out. Everywhere it passed, space was obliterated before it.

A wisp of gloominess flashed through the old man’s eyes. A black rod suddenly appeared in his right grasp, and then he swung it horizontally.

Hiss!

Rod images filled the sky.

Bang!

Sword and rod collided, and then the sky shook violently and transformed into a pitch black hole. Suddenly, Jian You released her grasp, and then rays of sword energy rained down madly upon the old man!

They were fast!

Absolutely fast!

Even Bai Zhixian wasn’t able to see Jian You’s figure. As for the speed of her sword, it was absolutely impossible to catch sight of. It was speed that far surpassed her.

In that expanse of space, no figure could be seen, only sword energy!

Just like that, around 100 breaths of time passed, and then explosions resounded before a figure was blasted out of the expanse of sword energy. That figure flew almost 3km away!

It was the old man!

At this moment, the old man’s body was covered in blood red injuries!

His expression was extremely unsightly as he looked up into the distance, and a woman was standing there.

Jian You!

Her sword was too, too fast, and even he couldn’t endure it!

Meanwhile, Jian You glanced at the old man and said, “My Jian Clan may have suffered a decline, but it isn’t an existence that just anyone can bully. If you dare to obstruct our path, then I, Jian You, will kill you in the name of the Sword Ruins.”

She put her sword away once she finished speaking.

She gazed at Bai Zhixian and the others, “Let’s go!”

Bai Zhixian nodded and led the others toward White Emperor City.

“Jian You!” Suddenly, the old man spoke solemnly, “Do you think that you can protect them?”

Jian You glanced at him and replied, “He’s heavily injured and unconscious now, and he’s in a hopeless situation. But what if he doesn’t die and survives this calamity?”

The old man stared at her, “He’ll never survive. The Immortal Estate won’t let him, and neither will those people. Jian You, if you insist on protecting him, you should know the consequences!”

Jian You closed her eyes slowly, “I know the consequences, but all of you will never know the consequences you’ll face if he dies!”

She vanished into the sky once she finished speaking.

The old man’s face was horrifyingly gloomy.

He didn’t fear Jian You, but he didn’t want to get injured with her, and then allow the others hiding in the shadows to reap the benefits. He wasn’t the only one who was targeting Yang Ye, and there were too many who wanted a share of the spoils!

The old man remained silent for a long time, and then he vanished on the spot.

Give up?

Of course he wouldn’t.

…

With Jian You there to escort them, they finally arrived at White Emperor City. An old man was standing on its wall, and it was Bai Zhixian’s father. The old man sighed softly when he saw them, and no one knew what he was thinking.

Bai Zhixian walked over to him, “Father.”

He glanced at Yang Ye, and then gazed at her, “Have you really decided?”

She nodded, “I have.”

He sighed softly, “You’re betting our entire White Emperor City!”

She looked him in the eyes, “Father, even if he never existed, the Immortal Estate would never spare us, would they?”

The old man replied softly, “At least we would have room to maneuver.”

She shook her head, “No matter what, I have no way out of this now.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “I can’t abandon him at a time like this, I can’t!”

The old man gazed at her for a long time and sighed softly, “Take him inside. I’ll deal with the rest.”

She nodded slightly and gazed at the others, “Let’s go!”

Su Qingshi bowed slightly to the old man, “Thank you!”

Once she finished speaking, she led the others behind Bai Zhixian. However, she stopped again after taking a few steps, and she gazed at Jian You, “Miss Jian You, thank you. If we survive, we won’t refuse if you need our help in the future.”

Jian You glanced at her and replied softly, “Take care!”

Su Qingshi nodded slightly and left.

The old man gazed at Jian You, “I didn’t expect him to actually be able to make you leave the Sword Ruins.”

Jian You replied softly, “City Governor, this matter is a calamity, yet it is also a blessing to your White Emperor City.”

The old man asked, “What do you mean?”

She shook her head slightly, “Take care.”

She vanished into the sky, and a ray of sword energy flashed through it.

As he watched the sword energy vanish, the city governor of White Emperor City closed his eyes slowly.

A storm was coming!

…

Jian You suddenly stopped far away in the sky, and Sword Scroll wasn’t too far away from her.

Sword Scroll spoke solemnly, “While I don’t want to force you, it’s very difficult for him to get through this without your help.”

“My presence won’t make a difference!” Jian You looked her in the eyes, “Sword Scroll, I’ve used up all the influence my Jian Clan has. I still have my own responsibilities and duties. If it wasn’t for you and Snowy, I would have never left Sword Ruins or allowed myself to get swept into the conflicts of the outside world. As for whether he can get through this, it depends on his own fortune.” She vanished into the sky once she finished speaking.

Sword Scroll shook her head on the spot.

Just as Jian You had said, she’d done enough.

Sword Scroll looked up at the sky and was slightly lost as she wondered how they would get through this!

…

White Emperor City. In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye laid in the cultivation room while Primordial Violet Energy ceaselessly repaired his body. As it did, his body was growing much better. However, even Primordial Violet Energy would take around 10 days to heal him.

Because his injuries were too, too heavy. It could be said that he’d been crippled by them!

Of course, it would only take a day inside the Primordial Pagoda itself!

However, whether they could even get through this day was unknown to them!

Moreover, even if Yang Ye recovered, could he really stop the torrent of experts that was surging in their direction?

After all, they had no backup!

In the cultivation room, the atmosphere was heavy, and all the girls were here.

Bai Zhixian gazed at Yang Ye for a long time. Suddenly, she stepped forward, “Leave him alone with me for some time, alright?”

The others gazed at her because it was a little too much to ask.

Bai Zhixian spoke softly, “Please!”

Su Qingshi glanced at her, and then she gazed at the others, “Let’s go outside!”

Qin Xiyue had a hot temper and was about to say something, but Su Qingshi shook her head. The latter puckered her lips and swallowed what she was about to say.

It didn’t take long for all of them to leave. However, there was a little fellow lying on Yang Ye’s chest.

It was Snowy!

Bai Zhixian went to Zi’er because only she could restrain the little fellow. Otherwise, the little fellow’s wrath was absolutely terrifying in the pagoda.

Zi’er glanced at her, and then walked over to Yang Ye and patted Snowy. Snowy was curled up on Yang Ye’s chest and had her head buried in it. She shook her butt at Zi’er to display that she didn’t want to be disturbed.

Zi’er glared at Snowy and smacked her butt. Snowy shuddered and was furious, but when she turned around and saw Zi’er, her furious little face turned into that of an aggrieved child, and she shot Zi’er a pitiable look.

Zi’er felt bad. She rubbed Snowy’s head, and then took Snowy in her arms and left the room.

At this moment, only Yang Ye and Bai Zhixian were left here.

Bai Zhixian sat by the bed and stroked Yang Ye’s face gently while looking at him with slight infatuation.

A long time passed before Bai Zhixian suddenly started undoing her dress.

Meanwhile, in the outside world.

An invisible wave of pressure suddenly enveloped the entire city.

Everyone in the city looked up with astonishment.

“Hand over Yang Ye. Refuse and everyone in this city dies!” An icy cold voice resounded through the sky.

In a hall within the city, the city governor walked over to a statue and knelt down slowly, “This unfilial descendent has no choice but to disturb you, ancestor.”

Crack!

The statue suddenly cracked open.
