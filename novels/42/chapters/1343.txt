Chapter 1344 – Above The Voider Realm!

An old man had suddenly appeared behind the Demon Empress. Yang Ye, the Demon Empress, and Mo Xiaoleng recognized the old man.

It was the ancestor of the Nie Clan who’d vanished for half a month, Nie Wuming!

At this moment, Nie Wuming’s hand had pierced through the Demon Empress’ stomach, and blood was spraying incessantly from there.

“Aunt Xiao!” Mo Xiaoleng’s shocked and furious voice resounded from below, and then 2 balls of flames transformed into pillars of flame that shot towards Nie Wuming.

Nie Wuming moved close to the Demon Empress’ ear, and a cold smile arose on the corners of his mouth as he said, “Demon Empress, after a thousand years of fighting, you’ve lost!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly shook his right hand.

Bang!

The Demon Empress was blasted away!

After that, Nie Wuming gazed at the flames that had arrived before him. There was a wisp of ridicule on the corners of his mouth as he gazed at them, and then he stretched his right hand forward and shook it slightly.

Bang!

The pillars of flames instantly exploded in midair. The flames that shot towards the surroundings suddenly started to tremble, and then they were instantly obliterated in midair.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched at the sight of this. Has that fellow’s strength... advanced above the Voider Realm?

Meanwhile, Mo Xiaoleng’s face was covered in shock. Obviously, she hadn’t expected Nie Wuming’s strength to arrive at such a level. Besides Snowy, even Yang Ye and the Demon Empress couldn’t destroy them with ease. Yet now, Nie Wuming had actually destroyed her flames with absolute ease.

Mo Xiaoleng gazed coldly at Nie Wuming and said, “You’ve surpassed the Voider Realm.”

“Exactly!” Nie Wuming glanced at the surroundings while a smile arose on the corners of his mouth. The smile on his face gradually grew wider. In the end, he started roaring madly with laughter, “After thousands of years of planning, I’ve finally surpassed the Voider Realm. Hahaha!”

After laughing for a while, he glanced at everyone here before finally looking at the Demon Empress who was on the verge of death, “Demon Empress, isn’t it terribly aggrieving? Because you should have surpassed the Voider Realm. Unfortunately, you were a step behind!”

At this moment, both the human race and demon race had stopped fighting. Of course, it was the demon race that had stopped first. The Demon Empress was on the verge of death, so how could they continue the attack? As for the human race, they were naturally happy to see the demon race halt the attack on them. After the previous battle, the human race had suffered heavy losses, and the survivors were practically exhausted. So they needed to rest.

As for counter-attacking, Ye Liuyun and the others wanted to, but the human race didn’t have the strength to do that. The Demon Empress was on the verge of death, but the demon race’s army wasn’t.

When the Demon Empress crashed down from the sky, the army of demon beasts immediately charged over and surrounded her.

At the center of the demon beasts, the Demon Empress’ countenance was pale while blood ceaselessly flowed out her chest. Yang Ye glanced at her and knew that she was beyond saving. Because her internal organs had been shattered, and the only reason she was alive was her formidable strength. She’d utilized her cultivation to forcefully seal up her fading vitality.

Of course, it was only temporary!

Cough!

The Demon Empress coughed lightly, and then a wisp of scarlet red instantly seeped out from the corner of her mouth. She looked up at Nie Wuming while a smile curled up on the corners of her mouth, but her smile was quite bleak, “Indeed, I was a step behind and lost everything. Nie Wuming, you’ve won after a thousand years.”

Nie Wuming gazed at the Demon Empress as he said, “Demon Empress, even though we’re mortal enemies who’ve fought both openly and secretly throughout these years, I have to say that your existence prevented me from feeling bored and lonely. Now, I’m going to break through the restrictions and head out to the outside world to seek the supreme Grand Dao, but you’re about to die.”

“Isn’t that very normal?” The Demon Empress grinned, “The winner lives and the loser dies. It’s a truth that has never changed for eternity. It’s just such a pity.”

Nie Wuming asked, “What’s a pity?”

The Demon Empress turned to glance at Doomsday City, “It’s a pity that the human race of this world was about to vanish. Just a moment longer and my husband’s dream would be fulfilled.... Just a little longer, and his lifelong dream would be realized.... Just a little longer....”

As she finished speaking, her voice grew weaker, and the color in her eyes faded.

“Roar!” Countless demon beasts howled in unison.

Right when the color in her eyes had almost faded completely, she suddenly raised her hand and spoke in a weak voice, “My demon race, hear me! Retreat immediately to the Veiled Region and seal it. The demon race is prohibited from stepping foot into Dark Hell Continent in the next 1,000 years, and it’ll continue until... until a new king... appears....”

When she spoke up to this point, she stared blankly at the sky while her hand dropped down slowly, “I’ve been waiting thousands of years for this moment....”

As soon as she finished speaking, the Demon Empress’ hand hit the ground, and the color in her eyes had completely faded. However, there was a smile hanging on the corners of her mouth, and she seemed to have gained her release.

Roar!

Countless demon beasts knelt on the ground in unison, and then howls of sorrow resounded incessantly.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye remained silent, and so did Nie Wuming.

The Demon Empress was their enemy, but there was no right or wrong between them. They just had different standpoints.

A short while passed before the Cloud Eagle took the Demon Empress’ corpse and flew up into the air. Meanwhile, the demon beasts on the ground started to retreat. It was her final order before her death, so no demon beast would disobey it. The army of demon beasts had arrived like a storm and left swiftly like one as well. In next to no time, they’d vanished from everyone’s fields of vision.

However, their sorrowful howls could still be heard clearly.

Even though the demon race had retreated, Yang Ye’s expression was still extremely solemn. Because while the demon race had left, Nie Wuming was still here. At this moment, the threat Nie Wuming posed to them wasn’t inferior to the demon race’s army.

At this moment, Nie Wuming paid no attention to Yang Ye, and he gazed at Mo Xiaoleng instead. The demon race’s army had retreated, but she hadn’t left, and she was still staring at him.

Yang Ye gazed at Mo Xiaoleng as well. His intuition told him that there was something off about her. Even though Nie Wuming was strong, she was no ordinary person. Especially because she was from the large world, so who knew what sort of trump cards she had.

Suddenly, Mo Xiaoleng looked up at Yang Ye and said, “How about we join forces to kill him?”

Nie Wuming’s eyes instantly narrowed when he heard her.

Yang Ye was slightly stunned when he heard her. He hadn’t expected her to say that, but it didn’t take long for him to come to a slight understanding. He remembered that the Demon Empress had once told him how Mo Xiaoleng had descended from the sky and was saved by her. Moreover, Mo Xiaoleng had always had a very good relationship with the Demon Empress. Now that the Demon Empress had been killed by Nie Wuming, Mo Xiaoleng probably wanted to avenge her!

As soon as he thought up to this point, Yang Ye nodded decisively. Nie Wuming’s current strength was clearly much stronger than the Demon Empress. So, his strength wasn’t sufficient to resist Nie Wuming at all. Now that Mo Xiaoleng wanted to join forces with him and kill Nie Wuming, it was exactly what he wanted.

“Attack!” As soon as Mo Xiaoleng spoke, 3 flames appeared around her. It didn’t take long for them to form a huge tri-colored dragon. The temperature here instantly skyrocketed when the dragon appeared, and it didn’t take long for the space in the surroundings to start becoming ethereal. The huge dragon shot up into the air under Mo Xiaoleng’s command and charged at Nie Wuming.

Yang Ye didn’t stand by idly. His Rebirth Rank sword intent surged madly into Heaven’s Gravestone, and then he stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that shot up into the sky towards Nie Wuming.

Regardless of whether it was Yang Ye or Mo Xiaoleng, they hadn’t held back at all, nor did they dare to hold back.

A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of Nie Wuming’s mouth when he saw Yang Ye and Mo Xiaoleng’s attacks charge at him, “Ants!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took a step forward, and then both Yang Ye and the huge tri-colored fire dragon were frozen on the spot. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The Laws of Time!

“Quickly activate your Domain!” Mo Xiaoleng’s voice resounded from below. As soon as she finished speaking, a mysterious force appeared here, and then everything instantly returned to normal. The fire dragon and Yang Ye instantly arrived before Nie Wuming and enveloped him.

Bang!

A moment of silence ensued before a wave of terrifying force appeared in the sky. It didn’t take long for both the tri-colored fire dragon and the glow on Yang Ye’s sword dispersed. At the same time, Yang Ye’s figure was instantly blasted 3km away.

Ye Liuyun and the others’ expressions instantly fell at the sight of this.

Yang Ye and Mo Xiaoleng’s faces turned gloomy as well. Because Nie Wuming was much stronger than they’d expected!

“Ants!” Meanwhile, Nie Wuming laughed coldly, “Can anyone on this continent even fight me?”

Yang Ye clenched tightly onto Heaven’s Gravestone. He was very well aware that Mo Xiaoleng and his strengths were utterly incapable of competing with Nie Wuming who’d surpassed the Voider Realm. The only way was to draw him over to Blind Maiden and let her deal with him. Even though he didn’t know how strong she really was, her strength was definitely much more terrifying than Nie Wuming.

However, he’d given up on such a thought.

Why?

Because he didn’t want her to look down on him. He was friends with Nether Maiden, true friends. However, Blind Maiden couldn’t be considered as his friend. Blind Maiden had helped him earlier out of consideration for Nether Maiden. Once was fine, but if he did it over and over again, it was really too humiliating. It wasn’t just humiliating for him; it would be humiliating for Nether Maiden as well!

He had to deal with Nie Wuming on his own!

Yang Ye took a deep breath while his profound energy surged madly within him. At the same time, Rebirth Rank sword intent surged madly into Heaven’s Gravestone, causing it to tremble violently while rays of light shot out incessantly from it.
