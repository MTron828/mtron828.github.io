Chapter 1934 – Your Fate is Yours Alone!

Snowy wanted the Sky Stairs!

Yang Ye was stunned. Suddenly, Snowy started waving her claws swiftly! She grew more and more excited as time passed…

A short while passed before Yang Ye gazed at the stairs.

It didn’t take him long to understand why she wanted it.

Spirit stones!

It wasn’t made from ordinary rocks, and it was made from a type of extremely pure spirit stones.

They were like immortal crystals, and the purity of the spirit energy within them was even greater than immortal crystals!

Rich!

The sky race was truly rich!

That was what Yang Ye felt.

Meanwhile, Snowy pointed at the Sky Stairs, and then she pointed at Yang Ye’s abdomen. Obviously, she was telling Yang Ye to move it into the Primordial Pagoda.

Move it into the Primordial Pagoda? Yang Ye laughed bitterly. He wanted to! But the problem was, could he?

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head gently, “We can’t take that. Because it belongs to someone else. They’ll attack us if we do, and we can’t defeat them right now. Understand?”

Snowy blinked, and then she waved her claws. She was asking him if they really couldn’t win against them!

Yang Ye nodded in an extremely serious manner.

Snowy glanced at the Sky Stairs with reluctance, and then she went into the Primordial Pagoda.

Meanwhile, Li Wu suddenly asked, “What was that?”

She’d met Snowy in the past. It was that same little fellow who’d try to trick her python into leaving her!

Meanwhile, Li Jiang suddenly said, “A Sprite Lord!”

Yang Ye gazed at Li Jiang with slight surprise.

Li Jiang said, “The shaman race has a library, and it has records of all the Sprite Kings in the world, and some other stories. There is the history of the various races, some legends, some secret realms, and Sprite Lords. It’s the first time I’ve seen one!”

A library!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and gazed at Yin Hou, “Senior, can I go take a look at that library once we return?”

She nodded slightly, “Yes!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Yin Hou suddenly said, “They’re here!”

Yang Ye and the others looked over, and they saw numerous rays of light shooting up into the air from afar. Those rays of light were shooting towards them.

The geniuses of the various races!

It didn’t take long for the light to disperse, and then many people appeared here. However, everyone stood really far away from each other, and some even stayed hidden in the shadows.

“Don’t force yourself to ascend further up the Sky Stairs!” Meanwhile, Yin Hou suddenly said, “It was created by the leader of the sky race, the Sky Emperor. The Sky Emperor created it for unknown reasons, but some have gone up there and never returned while some returned but went mad. However, there were also some who obtained great fortune. Some advanced on the Sky Stairs, some even advanced a few realms in succession, and some obtained cultivation techniques or treasures. In short, it’s a mysterious thing, and it’s your own fortune that will determine if it’s luck or misfortune that you gain from it!”

The Sky Stairs!

Yang Ye looked up. It stood towering within the starry sky. There was nothing special about it, and he could even see the end of it. However, just as Yin Hou had said, he could sense that there was something strange about it!

Suddenly, a white haired old man appeared before the stairs.

The old man glanced at the surroundings and said, “No matter which race you’re from, you can ascend the Sky Stairs. There are no rules, and you’re responsible for your own fate once you start ascending it. Now, begin!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man vanished on the spot.

It didn’t take long for a figure to flash and descend on the Sky Stairs, and then the figure started ascending it swiftly. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Once there was a first, it didn’t take long for a second and third to appear.

Yin Hou suddenly patted Yang Ye’s shoulder and said, “Take care of these three little fellows!”

Yang Ye glanced at them and smiled, “We’ll take care of each other.”

Yin Hou nodded slightly, “Be careful!”

Yang Ye nodded. He didn’t say another word, and he just appeared on the Sky Stairs with Li Jiang and the others.

It was very soft!

That was Yang Ye’s first thought. Standing on the Sky Stairs was like standing on cotton, and it was extremely soft!

He fell silent for a while before he gazed at the others, “Let’s go!”

He started walking forward slowly, and the others followed behind him. While Yang Ye wasn’t from the shaman race, they were practically treating him as their leader.

The Sky Stairs had a total of 999 stairs. If they walked, it would take quite some time to get to the top.

Yang Ye had intended to fly, but when he saw a young man being obliterated upon flying up, he decisively abandoned that thought.

It was best to walk!

It was healthier anyway!

In the beginning, everyone was walking quite normally, but Yang Ye gradually noticed that something was off.

Because some of the people ahead of him hadn’t just slowed down, their bodies had started to tremble violently. Some even stopped on the spot. They looked ahead with blank expressions in their eyes, and it seemed like they’d lost their souls!

Yang Ye reminded solemnly, “Be careful!”

The others nodded in response.

Yang Ye sped up slightly. At this moment, they were at the center of the stairway, and the people around them were gradually reducing in number.

Suddenly, Li Jiang stopped.

Yang Ye turned to look. He was about to speak when Li Jiang’s eyes opened wide, and he seemed to have seen something that aroused disbelief in him.

Yang Ye frowned. He was about to wake Li Jiang when a voice came from the side, “If you don’t want him to die, then it’s best if you don’t wake him!”

Yang Ye turned towards the source of the voice, and he saw a young man in a luxurious robe over there.

The young man glanced at Li Jiang, “He has been taken into an illusion. Whether it’s a blessing or a curse will depend on his own fortune.”

“An illusion?” Yang Ye was puzzled, “Who took him in there?”

The young man replied, “The vengeful souls that are bound to the Sky Stairs. There are countless vengeful souls here.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he continued forward swiftly.

Vengeful souls!

Yang Ye frowned slightly. He glanced at the surroundings, but he didn’t see any vengeful souls.

Meanwhile, Li Wu suddenly remembered, “Be careful!”

Yang Ye nodded, and they continued forward. A short while later, after they traveled around 100 steps up, Li Jiang’s sister, Li Tong, stopped on the spot.

Just like Li jiang, Li Tong stood on the spot with her eyes open wide, and they were blank.

Yang Ye glanced at Li Wu, “Are you going to continue?”

Li Wu nodded slightly, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he advanced forward with Li Wu. Presently, the number of people left around them was decreasing steadily, and there were only a handful in front of them.

Meanwhile, Li Wu suddenly asked, “Will you be going back to the Human Dimension?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “I think so! Why?”

Li Wu glanced at him, “Will we become enemies in the future?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “So long as you don’t come to kill me, I won’t try to kill you.”

Li Wu asked, “Will you fight for the human race?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “I don’t think I will. Because so long as I return to the Human Dimension, I’ll definitely be pursued with the intent to kill.”

Li Wu said, “Then stay in the Shaman Dimension!”

Yang Ye replied, “But I’m human!”

She looked him in the eyes, “We were once human too. Of course, we are still human. However, we’re a different race in the eyes of humans.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Li Wu continued, “After this universe gave birth to life, and especially after it gave birth to our human race, the human race engaged in countless internal strife. Every single winner of those battles would consider the losing side as a different race and annihilate them, and they’d say that they did it for the interests of the entire human race!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “If the human race is annihilated one day, then it’s very likely because the human race brought upon its own downfall.”

Li Wu nodded as she fully agreed.

The human race developed very quickly, but it was a race that was extremely good at engaging in internal strife. Even the most glorious race couldn’t endure constant internal strife!

Meanwhile, Li Wu said, “So, if there’s no place for you amongst the humans, come to the shaman race. With Lady Yin Hou’s support, there’ll definitely be a place for you in the shaman race.”

Yang Ye smiled. He was just about to say something when Li Wu suddenly stopped, “It’s my turn!”

Yang Ye swiftly turned to look at her, and her eyes were closed.

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly on the spot, “Senior, can you sense anything?”

A short while passed before Hou Qing replied, “I don’t sense anything!

Yang Ye’s face instantly fell! Even Hou Qing couldn’t sense anything!

Hou Qing said, “Kid, you don’t have to worry too much about it. While it’s mysterious, it isn’t very dangerous. The geniuses of my shaman race have been here in the past, and they returned safely after obtaining a huge increase in strength. So, just take it easy!”

Yang Ye nodded. He didn’t say anything else and just continued forward. He was less than 1,000 steps away from the end.

There were only five people in front of him, three men and two women. There were also three more people behind him.

In the beginning, everyone walked very quickly. Yet now, every single one of them was walking very slowly, extremely slowly.

Yang Ye continued forward. He walked over 100 steps up before he suddenly stopped, and his eyes opened wide…
