Chapter 2576

This time, Yang Ye was truly speechless!

She was the most unreliable person in history!

Yang Ye sat down and laughed bitterly, “Little Qi, so you’re not sure where we are?”

In the Primordial Pagoda, Qi Bitian felt quite guilty because she really didn’t know where they were! Because she had merely sensed the Origin but had never been there!

So, she wasn’t really sure where they were!

Yang Ye was utterly speechless as he stood there on the bridge. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

He would rather believe the ghosts of this world than believe her again!

Meanwhile, Qi Bitian suddenly said, “Why don’t you have a look around? What if we’re in the right place?”

Yang Ye rolled his eyes and glanced at the surroundings. In the end, his gaze stopped on the black water down below.

Black water!

An endless expanse of it!

Yang Ye asked, “What is that?”

Qi Bitian replied, “I don’t know!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Yang Ye remained silent on the bridge for a short while, and then he stood up. He was about to leave the bridge on his sword, but footsteps suddenly came from nearby!

Yang Ye looked over, and he saw an old woman walking slowly in his direction.

She was holding a black cane, and a pitch black serpent was at the top of it.

Her back was slightly bent, her hair snow white with threads of black, and she walked very slowly. It was like she would fall at any moment.

Yang Ye naturally wouldn’t treat her as an old woman on the verge of death!

Yang Ye gazed at her vigilantly. Meanwhile, she’d arrived before him, and he asked Qi Bitian, “Little Qi, is she dangerous?”

Qi Bitian blinked in the pagoda, “According to your standards or mine?”

Yang Ye spoke angrily, “Mine, of course!”

She replied, “Very dangerous!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, she glanced at Yang Ye, and she frowned upon noticing him, “That shouldn’t be!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “What shouldn’t be?”

The old woman replied, “You shouldn’t be here. Or to be more precise, it’s impossible for you to be here. How strange!”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and asked, “Senior, what is this place?”

She replied with a question, “You don’t know?”

Yang Ye smiled embarrassedly, “I-I don’t know…”

She glanced at him, shook her head slightly, and started walking off.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and hurried after her. He asked, “Um… Senior, where am I?”

She didn’t answer him.

Yang Ye fully displayed his skill at being shameless, “Um, Senior. I got here by accident, so I really don’t know anything about this place. Please help me!”

She stopped, glanced at him, and said, “This isn’t a place you should be at!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “But the problem is that I don’t know how to get back.”

She shook her head, “Young man, since you were able to get here, you’re definitely not ordinary. Fine, I’ll just treat it as a way to gain some goodwill. This is Voidsky, the Origin of a universe!”

She walked off once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye had more questions, but she’d vanished into the distance.

She’d vanished soundlessly!

The Origin of a universe!

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Little Qi, you didn’t bring me to the wrong place this time!”

Qi Bitian grinned in the pagoda, “Of course! Who am I? How could I make a mistake?”

Yang Ye grinned and glanced at the surroundings, “Little Qi, I think this place is very dangerous. Why don’t we leave?”

“Never!” Qi Bitian suddenly said, “I finally got here, and I haven’t even had fun… Wait! I meant I haven’t even taken a look around! Don’t you want to know how the situation is like in the Origin of Eternal Kingdom?”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “I want to live!”

She replied, “I guarantee that you won’t die, alright?”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and nodded, “Fine, then let’s go take a look around!”

Now that she’d guaranteed his safety, it represented that his life wouldn’t be in danger anymore. Since that was the case, he could go around!

Yang Ye didn’t fly on his sword. His intuition told him that it was best not to do that. He chose to trust his intuition!

Yang Ye walked off into the distance. He didn’t see anyone, and on both sides of the bridge was utterly still water!

It was very strange!

Yang Ye was extremely vigilant because he didn’t feel safe here at all!

Meanwhile, Qi Bitian was looking at the surroundings with great interest and curiosity from within the pagoda.

Suddenly, Yang Ye stopped. There was a middle aged man not too far away from him. The middle aged man wore a loose robe, and there was a black table before him. On the table were a few rings.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man saw Yang Ye, and there was a trace of surprise in his eyes. But it didn’t take long for the surprise to vanish. He grinned at Yang Ye and asked, “Would you like to buy something?”

Buy something!

Yang Ye walked over, and he saw around 20 spatial rings on the table.

Yang Ye glanced at him, “Can I take a look?”

The middle aged man smiled, “Of course!”

Yang Ye glanced at them, and then he was stunned!

Divine Treasures!

At least a divine treasure was within each and every one of them!

That wasn’t even the main point. The main point was that he’d noticed a Super Divine Treasure in the violet ring!

A Super Divine Treasure!

It was a palm-sized golden bell covered in golden symbols, and there was a Buddhist symbol on the top of it.

Yang Ye gulped and asked Qi Bitian, “Little Qi, do you know what that is?”

Qi Bitian shrugged in the pagoda, “I don’t. I’m not all-knowing. But it isn’t that bad, and it should be perfect for you!”

For him!

Yang Ye hurriedly calmed himself and gazed at the middle aged man, “U-Um… How much for the violet spatial ring?”

The middle aged man grinned, “You have quite the eye. It’s the Ancient Bell, a Super Divine Treasure. It’s a pretty good defensive treasure.”

Yang Ye nodded, “It’s pretty good indeed. But how much is it?”

The middle aged man smiled, “One Ancient Token or one Soul Crystal.”

Yang Ye’s face froze.

Ancient Token? Soul Crystal? He’d never heard of them!

Fortunately, he had Qi Bitian!

In the Primordial Pagoda, Qi Bitian explained, “You have no chance! Ancient Tokens are a type of key to unlock a certain place. Only a few in this world possess such keys. As for Soul Crystals, they are a crystallization of the soul. Of course, they aren’t the crystallization of ordinary souls. Souls that can form Soul Crystals are… Right, in any case, only an expert like the Soul Sect’s Master has a chance of forming a Soul Crystal when he dies. It’s only possible, not certain. Understand?”

Yang Ye spoke flatly, “Can’t you just say that I can’t afford it?”

Qi Bitian nodded and said, “You really can’t. Only that sword of yours is valuable. However, I can afford it!”

She flicked a coin that seemed just like a copper coin onto her palm.

An Ancient Token!

Qi Bitian chuckled, “I obtained this from a guy many years ago. I planned to unlock the place myself. Unfortunately, I went a little too far and got myself in trouble, so I didn’t have a chance to go! However, I didn’t toss this thing.”

An Ancient Token!

Yang Ye gulped, and then he revealed an unprecedentedly brilliant smile, “Little Qi, um… Can you…”

She asked, “You want it?”

Yang Ye hurriedly nodded, but it only took a moment for him to shake his head, “No, I’m just borrowing it from you, and I’ll return it in the future. Alright?”

She blinked, “One for three, alright?”

“That’s daylight robbery!” Yang Ye jumped at her, “Little Qi, you’re acting like a bandit!”

Qi Bitian shook her head, “Since you refuse, then forget it!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Little Qi, we’ve known each other for some time, right? You can’t do business like that… You have to give some consideration to our friendship, right?”

She replied indifferently, “I’m already being very nice. Just think about it, even I haven’t tossed this thing away, so do you think it’s ordinary? Go ask around and see if anyone would be willing to lend one of these to someone else!”

Yang Ye said, “Aren’t you afraid that I wouldn’t return it to you?”

She replied indifferently, “You’re no match for me!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened. Can you not be so direct?”

Yang Ye asked, “Aren’t you afraid that I wouldn’t be able to return it?”

“Don’t you have a Sprite Progenitor?” Qi Bitian continued, “If you can’t afford to return it, she will definitely be able to. Because she is the richest existence in this world. Even that old man with the bamboo chest won’t be as wealthy as her in the future!”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “Why?”

Qi Bitian replied, “She can perform Sprite Ascension. Even I am willing to become friends with her. There is no harm in that!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Alright, Snowy will return it to you!”

When he thought of Snowy, Yang Ye suddenly felt that he was very wealthy!

Qi Bitian flicked the coin into the air, and then an Ancient Token appeared before Yang Ye!

The middle aged man’s eyes lit up from the sight of it, and his smile grew wider!

Yang Ye placed the coin on the table and pointed at the spatial ring.

The middle aged man nodded and hurriedly passed it to Yang Ye. Yang Ye accepted it with quite a bit of excitement!

A Super Divine Treasure!

It was a Super Divine Treasure!

He'd obtained one just like that!

It felt quite unreal to Yang Ye!

The middle aged man suddenly said, “I still have another violet ring, and its level isn’t any inferior to the Ancient Bell. Do you want it?”

Yang Ye’s face stiffened!

A short while passed before Yang Ye asked, “Little Qi, do you have one more?”

She shook her head, “I don’t!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Little Qi, have you ever robbed someone?”

Qi Bitian replied, “This guy before you isn’t any weaker than the Soul Sect’s Master. According to my analysis, if you try to rob him, then your chance of survival is 0%!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
