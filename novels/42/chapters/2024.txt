Chapter 2025 – The Ji Clan!

A Misunderstanding?

Yang Ye was stunned on the spot. He sized up the old man while quite a weird expression appeared on his face. Is my reputation that great?

The old man heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Yang Ye stop attacking, and then he said, “Young Brother, it really is a misunderstanding. I didn’t know who you were. If I did, I would have never attacked you.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

“Why?” The old man laughed bitterly, “Young Brother, do you know what your actions in the Sky Dimension represent to my devil race?”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “It’s linked to the sky race?”

The old man said, “You trampled upon the geniuses of the sky race, and such a magnificent feat is something even the top geniuses of my devil race can’t accomplish. So, your name has spread through my devil race. My devil race has no ill intent towards you, and what just happened really was a misunderstanding!”

Yang Ye asked, “Just because of that?”

The old man nodded, “As I mentioned before, my devil race has no ill intent to you. You can leave whenever you wish!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

It was a display of goodwill from the devil race!

Yang Ye glanced at the old man, “Farewell!”

Yang Ye turned around and intended to leave. Suddenly, the old man said, “According to my knowledge, the Sovereign of Man is targeting you, so it’s best to be careful. If you don’t have anywhere you need to be, you can stay in my Devil Dimension. Don’t worry, while the Sovereign of Man is strong, this is the Devil Dimension!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I appreciate that, but I have something to do. Farewell!”

Yang Ye didn’t stay a moment longer and vanished on the spot.

The old man laughed bitterly when he saw Yang Ye leave. He hadn’t expected this fellow before him to be Yang Ye!

Yang Ye!

It was a name that no one in the large universe had never heard of! The main reason he’d stopped attacking was because that existence from the devil race had given the order to not offend Yang Ye.

The enemy of my enemy is my friend!

The sky race had an enemy with such potential, so it was naturally a good thing for the devil race!

Of course, there was another reason, and it was that he wasn't confident in his ability to kill Yang Ye. Not only that, he might even be killed instead!

Based on the collision between them just now, Zen Realm experts couldn’t stop Yang Ye anymore!

The old man shook his head and chuckled, “He’s much stronger than expected!”

…

At the entrance of Devil Well, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and planned to leave. However, he suddenly frowned and looked towards the side, “Isn’t it just a Sage’s inheritance? Do so many people have to covet it?”

A man walked out from the space there. He seemed to be around the age of 20, but he was very young and wore a loose robe.

Yang Ye sized up the man. He was very handsome, with bright eyes and snow white skin. Besides that, his figure beneath his robe was extremely slender. With just a single glance, Yang Ye discerned that it was a woman disguised as a man.

She was holding a folding man.

“Just a Sage’s inheritance?” The woman shook her head and smiled, “Brother Yang, what you just said… really makes us all feel embarrassed. Do you know what a Sage’s inheritance represents? It represents a practically smooth path until the Sage Realm. Even your charge into the Sage Realm will be much easier because you’ll have all sorts of unique advantages.”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “You recognize me?”

She smiled, “Of course, who doesn’t know you in the large universe?”

Yang Ye said, “If you have something to say, then be quick. I’m in a rush.”

She smiled, “You’re probably in a rush to return to the Sky Dimension and save that friend of yours, right?”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “You seem to know quite a bit!”

She didn’t answer him and said, “Brother Yang, do you really think the Sovereign of Sky will release your friend if you give him that inheritance?”

She shook his head and continued, “He definitely won’t. He won’t let you grow. According to my knowledge, he had exposed your whereabouts to the Sovereign of Man. Even if the Sovereign of Man doesn’t kill you, you’ll die once you get to the Sky Dimension. Brother Yang, you’ve offended two of the four Sovereigns. You’re quite amazing!”

Yang Ye said, “I don’t have time for you psychological games. Just be frank. Understand?”

She restrained her smile, “I want to work with you. I’ll help you save your friend, and I’ll give you information. You’ll always be a step ahead of the Sovereign of Man with my information.”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “What if I refuse?”

She was slightly stunned. Obviously, she hadn’t expected Yang Ye to ask this question, but it only took a moment for her to crack a smile, “Brother Yang, I was able to find you with such ease!”

A threat!

Yang Ye chuckled, “Are you threatening me?”

She waved her hand. In an instant, four black clothed figures appeared around Yang Ye.

All of them were at the Zen Realm!

She spoke indifferently, “Brother Yang…”

A sword appeared in Yang Ye’s grasp, and he waved it at them before pointing it at her, “Trust me, I can kill you in an instant, even if you bring 5 more Zen Realm experts!”

She shrugged, “I don’t believe you!”

The auras of the Zen Realm experts instantly locked onto Yang Ye.

Suddenly, a wave of mysterious energy appeared here.

The Sword Domain!

As soon as that happened, the auras around Yang Ye were suppressed, and Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

At the moment Yang Ye vanished, the four figures vanished as well.

Suddenly, Yang Ye was in front of the woman, and 36 ethereal swords appeared around her. The four Zen Realm experts were around the ethereal swords!

At this moment, they didn’t dare to move at all.

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “Do you believe me now?”

There was no fear on his face. She glanced at the surroundings and smiled, “As expected of the number one sword cultivator in the large universe. You’ve even comprehended the Sword Domain. Hmm? This should be a sword formation right? It looks like it’s even capable of killing a Zen Realm expert in an instant!”

She gazed at Yang Ye and smiled, “Are you trying to tell me that we can work together, but we’re equal?”

Yang Ye issued a command in his heart, and the swords and Sword Domain vanished.

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “No, I’m trying to tell you that regardless of who stands behind you, don’t threaten me. I’m quite an oversensitive person. If someone threatens me, I get agitated easily, and then I want to kill!”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away.

Suddenly, a voice came from the side, “My younger sister doesn’t know how to speak. Brother Yang, please excuse her!”

Yang Ye stopped and looked over. There was a woman there. She had a veil over her face, and she was seated on a wheelchair. An old man with a mask that covered half his face stood behind her. He was holding the wheelchair and slowly pushing her towards Yang Ye.

The woman behind Yang Ye hurriedly went over. She was about to speak when the veiled woman shook her head slightly.

The other woman fell silent.

The masked old man pushed the veiled woman over to Yang Ye, “Ji Yue, the human race!”

Yang Ye sized up the woman before him and said, “You’re much more sincere than your younger sister!”

She spoke softly, “She’s young, it limits her knowledge. Please don’t mind her!”

“Of course!” Yang Ye continued, “We can work together, but cooperation depends on sincerity. Now, I’ve seen a little of yours, so tell me what you want. We can work together if we can come to an agreement; we can go our separate ways if we can’t. What do you think?”

She nodded slightly, “Alright! Brother Yang, have you heard of Emperor Xuanyuan?”

Yang Ye nodded, “He’s an outstanding figure who once led all the races against the god race!”

The veiled woman nodded, “All those years ago, there were four supreme clans, and they were the strongest clans in the human race. They were the Xuanyuan Clan, Jiang Clan, Ji Clan, and Gui Clan. But in the end, the Xuanyuan Clan rose to supremacy, and the reason for that was mainly that sword. That sword which was forged by over a dozen Progenitors.”

Yang Ye asked, “You want my sword?”

She shook her head slightly, “That sword doesn’t belong to the Xuanyuan Clan. She has her own spirit, and she’ll choose who to follow. If she doesn’t choose my Ji Clan, then even if my Ji Clan obtains her, it’ll only be a cause for potential trouble!”

Yang Ye asked, “Then why have you come to me?”

She replied, “Emperor Xuanyuan sealed my Ji Clan’s Guardian Divine Beast, the Five Element Qilin, all those years ago. After his death and the Sword Precursor vanished, my Ji Clan’s divine beast has been unable to see the light of day. We did seek help from the Sovereign of Man, but his requests were too much. My Ji Clan wasn’t willing to pay such a huge price, so we’ve come to you now!”

Yang Ye fell silent.

The veiled woman said, “It’s probably difficult for you to save him from the Sovereign of Sky on your own. However, if you have my Ji Clan’s assistance, you’ll have at least a 90% chance. If it ends in failure, just forget everything I said, alright?”

Yang Ye asked, “I just have to release that Five Element Qilin of yours?”

She nodded slightly.

Yang Ye fell silent for quite some time before he said, “Alright, I agree.”

She said, “You can go to the Sky Dimension first. My Ji Clan’s experts will be there once you get there!”

Yang Ye didn’t say anything else and just vanished on the spot. But when he left, he shot a glance at the masked old man.

Once Yang Ye left, the veiled woman asked, “Uncle Jiang, what do you think of him?”

The masked old man fell silent for a while before he said, “Not bad! Our Ji Clan will have a great future with him by our side!”

The veiled woman spoke softly, “What a pity!”

Everyone here vanished a while later.

Right after they left, a black robed man suddenly appeared here. The man spoke softly, “The Ji Clan… This young master is really so difficult! I wouldn’t have accepted this damn job if I knew.”
