Chapter 2605

The slaughter in Darkspace was still continuing!

Yang Ye was killing like a madman!

Presently, he could kill the Darkspawn. Of course, he had to pay a certain price.

Since the very beginning, he’d killed countless Darkspawn, but he knew that there were much, much more out there!

As time passed, Yang Ye noticed that the Darkspawn weren’t the most terrifying thing here.

It was fear!

The fear toward the future and time!

Because there was no concept of time or light here.

Every time he wondered when this would end, some negative emotions would form within him!

Agitation! Uneasiness! Bewilderment!

Yang Ye gradually noticed that his greatest enemy wasn’t the Darkspawn but himself!

Because the slightest mistake in this boundless darkness would result in his defeat.

At most times, the only person capable of defeating you is yourself.

Yang Ye tried his best to calm down once he realized this.

He had no way out of this place, nor did he know how to escape this place!

So, what should he do at a time like this?

Beg for mercy?

That was absolutely impossible!

Yang Ye’s choice was very direct, and it was to kill his way out!

Kill!

Once he’d set his goal, Yang Ye’s negative emotions were wiped away!

Yang Ye charged all the way forward. This time, it wasn’t the Darkspawn that were attacking him, and he was taking the initiative to hunt them down! He wanted to kill everything he could hear!

Even though he had to pay a price for killing each of them, he gradually grew stronger and stronger. He’d grown accustomed to all their methods of attack, and his combat instinct had grown tremendously in this hopeless situation. Besides that, his sword was even faster, sharper, and more ruthless!

Every swing of his sword was lethal!

It could be said that besides the fact that his cultivation remained the same, his ability had improved tremendously in every other aspect! Especially his reaction. It was like the difference between the heavens and the earth now!

It was a reaction speed and ability that he’d forcefully honed through this battle!

Eternal Kingdom.

The mountain range where the Ancient Sword Sect’s forces were hiding.

Blood Maiden left the mountain range and looked up into the sky. At this moment, the sky was covered in a thick layer of dark clouds.

All the disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect had left the underground world and arrived on the mountain range.

Blood Maiden looked coldly at the sky.

She displayed no fear!

Meanwhile, a voice resounded, “You’re not from the Ancient Sword Sect, so you can leave at any moment. We won’t stop you!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Sword Scroll spoke abruptly by Blood Maiden’s side, “Leave with Nether Maiden and the others. We…”

Blood Maiden glanced at Sword Scroll, “We’ve always thought of him as a younger brother, so his business is our business. Now that he isn’t here, I, his older sister, will have to shoulder his responsibilities for him!”

She looked up at the sky and said, “If you want to fight, then bring it!”

A few powerful auras swept down from above…

The Origin of Eternal Kingdom.

Qi Bitian had overturned it on her own that day. Now, it was gradually returning to calm. However, the destroyed bridge hadn’t been restored!

The Boundless Water beneath that area of the bridge would frequently surge and roil!

A middle aged man looked down from the bridge, and no one knew what he was thinking.

The middle aged man was the Desolate Emperor!

A long time passed before he grinned, “As expected of someone from that era! Her strength is truly heaven defying!”

Suddenly, a black robed figure appeared behind him.

The black robed figure said, “Patriarch, the Lu Clan sent Yang Ye into Darkspace, and his fate is unknown. Meanwhile, Eternal Kingdom has sent its forces to crush the Ancient Sword Sect. According to our analysis, the Ancient Sword Sect won’t last for long. It’s because the War Dimension has joined the Eternal Kingdom’s forces in the attack!”

The War Dimension!

The desolate emperor chuckled, “I didn’t expect them to make the War Dimension help! Interesting indeed!”

A short while later, the desolate emperor said, “Can we find out if Yang Ye is still alive?”

The black robed figure shook its head, “We cannot get in contact with that world. However, I have an idea. If he’s alive, you can save him, and then make him fight the forces of Eternal Kingdom first. It’s very beneficial for us!”

The desolate emperor closed his eyes slowly, and then the space around him shook.

Some time passed before he opened his eyes, and then he shook his head and smiled, “How tenacious!”

Darkspace.

At this moment, Yang Ye was still slaughtering!

He didn’t know what time it was or where he was. At this moment, only one thought filled his mind—kill!

Kill like a madman!

Now, the Darkspawn weren’t the ones hunting him, and he was hunting them instead.

The roles had been switched!

In the beginning, the Darkspawn were extremely ferocious and vicious when facing him. However, they were retreating before him!

They were brutal, but Yang Ye was worse!

It was like how a spring reacted to force!

Yang Ye couldn’t walk very stably anymore. He was holding a blood red sword as he staggered forward. It was because he sensed fluctuations of energy coming from there!

If someone was here, that person would be absolutely astounded by the state Yang Ye was in!

It was truly horrifying!

At this moment, Yang Ye’s entire body was covered in scars. Especially his face, it was completely destroyed! He was beyond recognition!

Even though he had the Primordial Pagoda, because he was taking the initiative to attack and was fighting incessantly, even the Primordial Pagoda couldn’t restore all his injuries. After all, his injuries were increasing faster than they recovered!

Suddenly, Yang Ye stopped. A moment later, Yang Ye twisted his body sideways and swung his sword at an angle!

It was fast, accurate, and deadly!

Yang Ye’s attacks vividly portrayed those aspects now!

Along with that swing, something was cut down by his side. A moment later, a shrill cry resounded over 1km away. A short while after, the shrill cry grew softer until it vanished completely!

Yang Ye continued forward!

Meanwhile, some blood appeared on his throat. If he’d been just a little slower, he may have had his throat slit!

He'd already done the best he could just now!

The Darkspawn were so fast and elusive that it made them extremely terrifying. Even Yang Ye couldn’t fully dodge them. Perhaps it would be possible if he was at his prime, but he was severely injured right now!

Yang Ye continued forward with the blood red Executor in his grasp. He couldn’t stop. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to, but he really couldn’t. The Darkspawn would only fear him while he was moving!

Once he stopped, they would swarm him!

If he wasn’t brutal, vicious, and mad now, his enemies would do it to him instead!

Actually, Yang Ye didn’t feel that bad anymore!

Because it was the first time he’d truly fought to his heart’s content like this!

Once his sword intent and Sword Heart had transformed, Yang Ye had rarely fought to his heart’s content. Especially not a battle of life and death!

If he wanted to fight to his heart’s content out there, he had to look for a Destiny Realm expert!

Of course, the battle wasn’t over. He was very well aware that while he was enjoying the battle, survival was most important!

Continue forward!

A long time passed before even walking became quite difficult for Yang Ye!

Suddenly, a few obscure auras shot at him!

Yang Ye stopped, and then a ray of sword energy erupted like a crescent of light!

A miserable shrill cry resounded!

However, an arm flew up into the air along with the dazzling ray of sword energy!

…

Eternal Kingdom.

Countless flying swords ceaselessly shot up into the air above a mountain range!

They were led by a woman in a blood red dress.

Blood Maiden!

Nether Maiden and the others were behind her.

Besieging the Ancient Sword Sect!

At this moment, all the powers of Eternal Kingdom were besieging the Ancient Sword Sect. However, something worth mentioning was that no Destiny Realm experts were here!

Obviously, they were afraid of the expert who backed Yang Ye.

Even though there were no Destiny Realm experts here, the strength of the Eternal Kingdom’s powers and Soul Sect wouldn’t have any problem annihilating the Ancient Sword Sect’s forces!

Or it should be said that it would be very easy for them!

A huge demon stood not too far away from Blood Maiden.

It was a pitch black ape!

It had another identity, the Demon Commander of War Dimension!

Blood Maiden undoubtedly seemed extremely tiny before the colossus in front of her.

They didn’t waste their breaths at all!

The Demon Commander suddenly swung a punch at her!

The world collapsed before it!

Meanwhile, an ocean of blood covered the sky.

The entire sky was an ocean of blood!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Explosions rumbled like thunderclaps through the entire sky, and every one of them caused the ocean of blood to turn slightly more ethereal!

Meanwhile, a few Demon Generals from the War Dimension had charged at the disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect.

Corpses covered the entire area!

Darkspace.

Yang Ye supported himself with his sword. His left arm was gone, and blood was surging out like a fountain from him!

His blood had almost flowed dry!

Even the Primordial Pagoda couldn’t heal him.

After all, he was bleeding, not just losing water!

Suddenly, Yang Ye cracked a smile, and it was quite horrifying.

He ignored the state his body was in and suddenly stood up, and then a ray of sword energy flashed!

Hiss!

At the instant he descended, a shrill cry resounded, and then something seemed to fall down!

Yang Ye licked the blood on Executor and spoke in a slightly insane manner, “Bring it!”

As soon as he said that, he charged forward with sword in hand!

Suddenly, the blood that he’d bled and left behind earlier suddenly started to tremble. Moreover, all the blood within Yang Ye’s body instantly fell silent.

A moment later…

Bang! Bang!

All the blood within Yang Ye started to explode apart!
