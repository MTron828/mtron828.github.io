Chapter 1267 – 3 Vs 1!

At the critical moment, the Phantom Shield appeared on Yang Ye’s nape and stopped the dagger.

Clang!

The Phantom Shield shook violently!

Even though the Phantom Shield had stopped most of the force within the dagger, it had still caused Yang Ye to feel slightly dazed. Meanwhile, a spear tore through space and instantly stabbed against Yang Ye’s chest. Yang Ye didn’t dare use the Phantom Shield to block the spear because there was another Voider behind him!

Bang!

Yang Ye’s figure shook violently from the impact and was pushed back repeatedly. However, the spear hadn’t been able to stab through his skin, and it only managed to crack the skin in the area. Meanwhile, a black robed old man suddenly appeared behind the spear, and he slapped his palm against it.

Pu!

The spear instantly pierced Yang Ye’s chest and took Yang Ye flying with it. Meanwhile, at the instant his figure started flying backwards, a dagger had suddenly appeared at his nape. This time, it was clearly much stronger than before. Because the practically translucent dagger tore through the space in its path.

Yang Ye swiftly bit the tip of his tongue, and the intense pain allowed his mind to clear up immensely. Once he noticed the dagger behind him, Yang Ye issued a command in his heart, and the Phantom Shield moved to block the dagger. At the same time, he swiftly sheathed his sword before drawing it once more. Because a hammer that carried dazzling light had arrived before him.

The sword and hammer collided!

Bang!

The blood red sword and iron hammer shook violently before the hammer was blasted away. As soon as the hammer flew away, a black robed old man suddenly appeared before Yang Ye, and he grabbed the spear in Yang Ye’s chest. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly grabbed the spear in his chest as well.

Both of them exchanged glances, and then Yang Ye suddenly pushed the spear into his body. At the same time, the black robed old man pushed the spear into Yang Ye’s body as well. However, the old man’s expression instantly changed when he noticed that Yang Ye was actually not stopping it from piercing through him and was pushing it through himself instead.

At the instant it pierced through Yang Ye’s body, Yang Ye used the force to press forward towards the old man while emanating a blood red ray of light. The old man’s pupils constricted at the sight of this, and his eyes were filled with astonishment. At this moment, he couldn’t dodge at all, nor did he have the time to dodge, so he could only watch as the sword slashed at him.

At the critical moment, a practically translucent dagger suddenly stabbed the right side of Yang Ye’s sword, causing the sword to immediately deviate and strike the old man’s shoulder instead of his head.

Hiss!

The old man’s right arm flew off into the air. At the same time, his left palm shot forward and slammed against Yang Ye’s chest.

The Phantom Shield didn’t obstruct this palm strike because that dagger which kept appearing out of nowhere had appeared before Yang Ye’s throat!

Clang!

Bang!

The Phantom Shield had stopped the dagger, but Yang Ye was blasted away by the old man’s palm strike. Right at the instant his body started flying backwards, a grey robed old man with a hammer in his grasp appeared above Yang Ye, and then the hammer carried powerful might as it smashed down towards Yang Ye. Meanwhile, the currently one-armed old man had another spear in his grasp now, and he transformed into a ray of light that stabbed at Yang Ye’s chest!

It was extremely swift, and it arrived in front of Yang Ye before he could even react.

A wisp of ferocity flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes as Rebirth Rank sword intent surged out explosively from within him. However, it had just emerged when it was suppressed by the imposing aura of 3 Voiders. Since he couldn’t use his sword intent to suppress the old man, Yang Ye had no choice but to enhance his sword with sword intent and stab it forward.

Clang!

The blood red sword shook violently from the collision while the hammer cracked open, and the old man holding the hammer was blasted 300m away. Meanwhile, the black robed old man’s spear had arrived in front of Yang Ye. Yang Ye didn’t have the time to pull his sword back, but he’d expected that. So, he’d put away the ancient sheath at the same time that he stabbed his sword forward, and he clenched his left fist before slamming it at the spear!

The Brink Laws!

Strength at the brink!

His body was at the Epoch Realm right now, so how powerful would his attack be when he brought his strength to the brink?

His fist had just struck the tip of the spear when the spear was instantly blasted into bits, and the powerful force within his fist slammed down towards the old man.

The old man’s pupils had constricted to the size of needles when the spear shattered. But his reaction wasn’t slow, and a ray of dazzling light immediately appeared on his left palm as he slapped it at Yang Ye’s fist.

Bang!

Pu! Pu!

An explosion resounded. The black robed old man spat out 2 mouthfuls of blood while his figure was blasted away from the force of the collision.

At the moment the old man’s figure flew backwards, or it should be described as the moment Yang Ye swung his fist forward, a dagger had swept towards Yang Ye’s eyes. Yang Ye was prepared for this, and the Phantom Shield obstructed the dagger. However, right when the dagger stabbed the Phantom Shield, Yang Ye’s hairs stood on end and a feeling of danger made him instinctively press his chin down swiftly.

His chin had just pressed down towards his chest when a strand of blood seeped out from his throat. Because a dagger had suddenly appeared there, and it had just happened to pierce open the skin on his throat. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

2 daggers!

If he hadn’t pressed his chin down and clamped down on that dagger, it wouldn’t have just pierced his skin but sliced off his head instead.

Because this Voider could pierce through his physical defenses!

All 3 of the Voiders here would pierce his defenses, and the owner of the daggers was the strongest. Because Yang Ye still hadn’t seen that expert’s figure until now!

Yang Ye didn’t think any further. After he clamped down on the dagger with his dagger, he stomped his right foot down and shot up into the air. He’d just flown up when a huge palm crashed down from above. But Yang Ye didn’t stop, and the sword in his grasp emanated dazzling light as he continued his upward charge.

Hiss!

Yang Ye shot up with his sword in hand and stabbed the huge palm. His sword was merely obstructed for an instant before his figure shot through the huge palm. It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to transform into a ray of light that entered the space before him and vanished on the spot.

The black robed old man and grey robed old man didn’t pursue him, and they had an unprecedentedly solemn expression on their faces.

A long time passed before the black robed old man spoke in a low voice, “The information we received was severely erroneous. He isn’t a Saint but a Quasi Emperor, and his body isn’t at the Divine Shift Realm but the Epoch Realm.”

“He probably obtained fortuitous encounters in Sword God’s Palace!” The grey robed old man spoke solemnly, “As a sword cultivator, he actually dared to head to Sword God’s Palace and was able to return alive. Wait! His physical strength is so formidable, so he probably didn’t even use the sword there. His natural talent is truly extraordinary. Not only are his attainments in the Sword Dao so formidable, even his body is that powerful!”

The black robed old man nodded, “I’d thought that it would be absolutely easy with the 3 of us joining forces against him. But I never expected that... we are actually lucky to have come together. Otherwise, under the circumstances that we severely underestimated his strength, we might have been killed by him!”

The grey robed old man replied, “Even though I didn’t dare to be certain that he was the one who’d killed my Yuan Clan’s young master and a Voider, how could we possibly act carelessly? After all, that old fellow from the World Devastator Cult never returned. I’d thought that he had someone assisting him, but now it would seem like the Voider from my Yuan Clan might have died at his hands. He has the strength to kill Voiders!”

Both of their faces fell.

After all, it was quite inconceivable to hear a Quasi Emperor possessing the strength to kill Voiders. If they hadn’t witnessed Yang Ye’s strength themselves, they would absolutely not believe it.

The black robed old man said, “He’ll be vigilant now, so it’ll probably be difficult for us to kill him now! Why don’t we just head to Doomsday City?”

The grey robed man shook his head, “He’s the reason why the Sword Alliance is strong. If he’s dead, we can destroy the Sword Alliance in an instant; if he’s alive yet we destroy the Sword Alliance, then he who has nothing to worry about anymore would be a huge problem for our Veiled Region. I presume your Ye Clan definitely doesn’t want such a monstrous genius to be targeting your clan from the shadows, right? Besides that, we intend to share the Sword Alliance between ourselves and not destroy it.”

“Just the 3 of us are probably unable to kill him!” The black robed old man spoke in a low voice, “His sword is at the Void Rank, that defensive treasure of his is at the Void Rank as well.... Especially that defensive treasure....” He suddenly stopped speaking. Because that defensive treasure was one of the Yuan Clan’s precious treasures.

The grey robed old man’s face was gloomy, “Don’t worry, I’ll take it back myself.”

The black robed old man asked, “Where is she?”

The grey robed old man glanced at the surroundings and said, “She has probably gone to pursue Yang Ye.”

The black robed old man frowned, “She’s being too impatient.”

The grey robed old man said, “She has never failed to assassinate her targets. So, she’s naturally anxious after failing this time.”

The black robed old man asked, “What should we do now?”

The grey robed old man pondered deeply for a moment and said, “His strength is extraordinary, and just the 3 of us are probably unable to kill him. Send word for the High Abyss Sect and the Lin Clan to send their forces. If even 5 Voiders can’t kill him, then we can just take our own lives! Let’s go assist her. We can’t give Yang Ye any time to breathe!”

They vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

A few tens of thousands of kilometers away, Yang Ye rode his sword down into a vast forest, and his face turned slightly gloomy as he looked at the spear on his chest.

3 Voiders!

He didn’t have to guess to realize that they were definitely from the Veiled Region!

He hadn’t expected that the Veiled Region would have acted so quickly. Moreover, he was their target! 3 Voiders! They clearly didn’t plan on giving him any chance to survive!

They really think highly of me! Yang Ye took a deep breath. He’d considered the possibility that the Veiled Region would send someone to assassinate him. After all, he was the Sword Alliance’s master, and the Sword Alliance would collapse once he was dead. But he hadn’t expected them to send 3 Voiders at once!

They’d sent 3 Voiders to kill a Quasi Emperor!

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed, and then he turned around and slammed his fist forward.

Bang!

An explosion resounded as the space before him shook violently. It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to notice the space around 30m ahead ripple slightly.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and a ferocious expression instantly curled up on the corners of his mouth when he noticed that there was no one in the surroundings, “You dared to come here alone! You must be really brave!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of blood red light that vanished on the spot.
