Chapter 845 – Am I Cruel?

Editor: Conspiracing

All of them looked towards the source of the voice, and they saw a black robed man walking through the sky towards them with a black spear in his hand. Every single step he took caused space to tremble before him, and it seemed like space itself couldn’t endure his footsteps!

Yu Cangping was furious, and he was about to attack, but the woman from Martial Enlightenment City suddenly moved over to greet the black robed man.

“Senior Xiao Yu, what are you doing here?” The woman was rather respectful.

Senior!

Yu Cangping and the others were shocked when they heard this word. They knew that Young Miss Ming was from the Ocean of Clouds Academy, so since she called him senior, then it meant he was from the academy as well!

“Oh, it’s Junior Sister Ming Zhan Xue!” Xiao Yu nodded lightly before he gazed at Yang Ye, “Someone destroyed my Dao Order’s Hell’s Coffin. As a disciple of the Dao Order, how could I not come here?”

Ming Zhanxue gazed at Yang Ye with slight astonishment, “He... he’s that disciple of the Ancient Sword School!”

A disciple of the Ancient Sword School!

Yu Cangping and the others instantly revealed grim expressions when they heard this. After all, they hadn’t imagined that this ugly young man was actually from the Ancient Sword School!

Regardless of whether it was the Ocean of Clouds Academy, the Dao Order, or the Ancient Sword School, every single one of them were existences that they couldn’t afford to offend! As for their revenge, they naturally wanted to get it. Especially Yun Renxing because he’d lost his son, so how could he be willing to just give up on taking revenge? However, he understood that he absolutely couldn’t act against Yang Ye. Otherwise, the entire Broken Saber Villa would be annihilated in an instant!

Xiao Yu laughed coldly and said, “While the Ancient Sword Sect has always been enemies with my Dao Order, there really hasn’t been anyone who dared to destroy the Hell’s Coffin of my Dao Order. Even the Sword Emperor, Lu Wan’er, who’d said to be a genius that’s rare to come by in 10,000 years wouldn’t dare do so. However, I never imagined that someone with no reputation at all would dare to! Does your boldness come from skill or is it ignorance?”

Ming Zhanxue moved aside because she couldn’t afford to offend someone from the Dao Order. But in the same way, she couldn’t afford to offend someone from the Ancient Sword School as well. The only thing she could do was remain silent and help no one. Otherwise, if she dared to help this fellow from the Dao Order, then countless disciples of the Ancient Sword School would definitely make life worse than hell for her once she returned to the academy!

Yang Ye patted Fan Meng on the head and said, “Both of you enter the city first!”

Fan Meng glanced at Xiao Yu and the others before she nodded. She knew that she would be of no help if she stayed.

“Looks like you really know how to enjoy yourself!” Xiao Yu laughed coldly, “Don’t worry, I won’t kill you right away. I’ll make you watch what happens to the 2 of them. I’ll allow you to realize what’s the consequences of daring to insult my Dao Order!”

Yang Ye gazed at Xiao YU with disdain, “Men should settle things with their fists, yet you intend to use women. If the Dao Order is filled with trash like you, then all I can say is that I’ll all who come!”

“You’ll kill all who come? Hahaha!” Xiao Yu roared with laughter for a while, and then he said, “When did another arrogant sword cultivator appear in the Ancient Sword School? Since you’re so confident, then why don’t we make a bet? 10 moves! If I can’t defeat you in 10 moves, then you will kneel down before Stellar Sky City and shout that your Ancient Sword School is inferior to my Dao Order, alright? Similarly, if you’re able to resist 10 moves of mine, then I’ll be the one who kneels and shouts that my Dao Order is inferior to your Ancient Sword School!”

Xiao Yu was very well aware that the incident related to Yang Ye had aroused the attention of the Dao Order’s higher-ups. It could be said that the person who resolved the matter and brought glory to the Dao Order would definitely receive the recognition of its higher-ups. Moreover, there would absolutely be no lack of rewards! So, that was why he’d proposed such a bet!

Once Yang Ye lost and shouted that the Ancient Sword School was inferior to the Dao Order, then he had no doubt that his name would spread throughout Pine Prefecture! Moreover, he would be rewarded by the Dao Order! It could be said to be like killing two birds with one stone!

“Alright!” A smile appeared on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth. Xiao Yu wanted to bring glory for the Dao Order, and he similarly wanted to bring glory to the Ancient Sword School. Because only then would the higher-ups of the Ancient Sword School assist him from the shadows and stop those old living fossils of the Dao Order from acting against him!

“Wave Obliterator!”

Yang Ye had just finished speaking when Xiao Yu’s spear had instantly transformed into a ray of black light which shot towards him. The spear tore through space all along the way, and the powerful aura it contained caused some of the demon beasts in the surroundings to immediately kneel on the ground. Moreover, the space around it seemed to be unable to endure the force it carried, and the space actually started to show signs of cracking apart!

When the spear arrived less than 2m away from him, Yang Ye finally clenched his right fist and smashed it forward! Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

A gust of wind surged out and smashed against the spear.

Bang!

A huge explosion resounded as the black spear smashed apart Yang Ye’s attack and didn’t slow down at all as it continued towards Yang Ye. A slight smile arose on the corners of Xiao Yu’s mouth when he witnessed this scene. However, it didn’t take long for it to freeze while it grew wider.

Because his spear had stopped just a few centimeters away from the center of Yang Ye’s forehead, and Yang Ye’s hand was holding onto it!

Everyone here was astounded, including Xiao Yu!

“I’ve resisted an attack of yours, not try mine!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye stomped the ground with his right foot, and then his figure vanished on the spot. He was in front of Xiao Yu when he appeared once more, and it astounded the latter.

Xiao Yu had never expected Yang Ye’s speed to be that swift, and he was about to retreat. However, rumbling suddenly resounded in his ear!

Xiao Yu hadn’t even been able to react before he felt sharp pain come from his body, and then his figure crashed down from midair!

Bang!

Xiao Yu’s figure smashed against the ground, causing it to tremble violently while countless cracks stretched out from beneath him.

Everyone here was petrified by this scene.

Xiao Yu had lost just like that. He lost without even being able to resist a single attack from Yang Ye!

Ming Zhanxue’s eyes were filled with shock and disbelief. Perhaps others weren’t aware of how terrifying Xiao Yu was, but she’d witnessed it with her own two eyes. Xiao Yu had once surmounted his realm of cultivation to kill a Monarch Realm expert, and it had even been a mid rank Monarch Realm expert! But she’d never imagined that such a monstrous genius would have been unable to even resist a single attack from Yang Ye!

Besides Ming Zhanxue, Li Qingyi was beyond shocked as well.... After she recovered from the shock she experienced, all that was left was terror. After all, she’d threatened Yang Ye repeatedly in the past.

Yu Cangping and Yun Renxing had extremely solemn expressions on their faces as well. While they were Half-Saints, they still felt extremely fearful when facing such monstrous geniuses. After all, monstrous geniuses usually couldn’t be judged by convention, especially monstrous geniuses from Platinum Rank powers!

Yang Ye held the black spear in his hand as he walked over to Xiao Yu. At this moment, Xiao Yu was still alive, but it seemed like something heavy had smashed against his body, causing it to be deformed. If it wasn’t for the strength he possessed, he would be dead by now!

Yang Ye looked down at Xiao Yu as he spoke indifferently, “You’ve lost, so fulfil your promise!”

Xiao Yu stared fixedly at Yang Ye, and while there was resentment in his eyes, it was mostly terror which filled his eyes.

“Don’t look at me like that!” Yang Ye continued, “I don’t like people who go back on their word. Especially when they are my enemy. I’ll say it again, you’ve lost, so start shouting!”

How could Xiao Yu dare to do that? So long as he did, then the Ancient Sword School wouldn’t even have to act against him because just the Dao Order would make living worse than death for him!

Yang Ye waved his right hand and the spatial ring on Xiao Yu’s hand flew into his grasp, and then he nodded lightly upon inspecting its contents. He said, “Not bad, you have over 10,000 extreme-grade energy stones. Needless to say, you disciples of the Dao Order are truly rich. Right, while this spear is only at the high-grade of the Dao Rank, it’s not bad. It just happens to suit me!”

When he spoke up to this point, Yang Ye tapped the spear against Xiao Yu’s right leg.

Crack!

The clear and melodious sound of bones breaking resounded.

“AHHH!” Xiao Yu’s eyes opened wide and so did his mouth as a shrill cry shot into the sky!

“I do really respect some opponents!” Yang Ye said, “But I don’t respect some people like you who like to threaten others with women. I heard your Dao Order is quite cruel. It just so happens that I want you to see if I’m cruel or not!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye tapped once more with the spear.

Crack!

The bones and meridians within Xiao Yu’s left leg shattered apart. At this moment, he wasn’t even able to shout anymore.

Yang Ye didn’t speak, he just tapped once more with the spear. This time, it struck Xiao Yu’s left hand, and then he tapped it against Xiao Yu’s right hand.

The bones and meridians within Xiao Yu’s limbs had been completely shattered, and his face had warped severely from the intense pain he experienced.

“Besides the fact that you broke your promise, the most important reason why I’m treating you like this is because you don’t respect women!” Yang Ye continued, “While they aren’t my women, they are my friends. It’s fine to disrespect me because I would kill you at the very most. But if you disrespect my friends, then I’ll make even death become something difficult for you to attain!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye tapped once more with the spear, and it struck between Xiao Yu’s groins.

Xiao Yu’s eyes were bloodshot, and they simply seemed like they were about to pop out from their sockets. This time, there was only terror left in his eyes, boundless terror.

It wasn’t just Xiao Yu, even Ming Zhanxue, Yu Cangping, and the others had terror in their eyes.

While Yang Ye’s methods were cruel, it was nothing to them. After all, they were powerful figures, so which one of them hadn’t killed in their lives? However, the problem was the person Yang Ye was torturing!

He was torturing a disciple of the Dao Order in public, and it was like openly slapping the Dao Order’s face!

Needless to say, if Yang Ye survived the trip back to the Ancient Sword School, then the Dao Order’s reputation which it had maintained for tens of thousands of years would be lost in a day!

Clink!

Suddenly, the tune of a zither resounded. It was clear and melodious, and it was like the tune of an immortal brushing through the world, causing the clamorous noise in the surroundings to instantly die down.

All of them looked towards the source of the tune, and they saw a white robed woman who had a veil covering her face standing on the walls of Stellar Sky City. The woman was seated cross-legged, and an ancient white jade zither rested on her lap. Moreover, her fair fingers were playing it gently....

The tune of the zither was soft in the beginning, like a stream that was flowing slowly, and it was pleasing to the ear and gladdened the heart. However, it gradually sped up like a storm, and it didn’t take long for it to quicken to the point it was like a tempest that surged through the world!

It didn’t take long for her hands to stop moving, and the tune of the zither immediately vanished.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

At the exact same moment, numerous explosions resounded through Yang Ye’s body as he stood below the city, and it only took an instant for him to be covered in blood!
