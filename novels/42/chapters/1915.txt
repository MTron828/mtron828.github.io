Chapter 1916 – You’re Very Strong Too!

She’s under my protection!

His voice was very calm, but it carried a type of deterrent force that was beyond doubt.

Yang Ye knew that from the moment he’d agreed to escort her to safety, he would face a lot of trouble.

But he still agreed.

Both him and Snowy had benefited greatly from the old man, and he naturally had to repay the old man’s kindness. Besides that, he was sort of friends with Nansi Yin now, so he was really unable to just stand by idly.

Nansi Yin’s gaze was fixed on Yang Ye.

Confident and overbearing!

That was what she noticed from Yang Ye. She had a feeling that Yang Ye didn’t fear anything, and he was always that confident!

Actually, as a sword cultivator, strength wasn’t always the most important; the most important thing was the heart. If the heart held fear, one would be a coward even if one was strong. Sometimes, confidence comes from strength.

However, most times, confidence had nothing to do with strength. The strong were cowards too!

Because they worried about this and that. A bound sword would never be free to be drawn as the heart willed it!

But Yang Ye wasn’t like that.

So, he had an imposing aura, an imposing aura of fearlessness and matchlessness!

Nansi Yin walked over to Yang Ye’s side and said, “My father and the experts of my clan will alarm the shaman race’s experts if they enter the Shaman Dimension, and then the experts of the shaman race will obstruct them. So, we must leave the Shaman Dimension!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Let’s go!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he flicked his finger and an ethereal sword appeared below Nansi Yin’s feet. Right when they were about to leave, a terrifying aura slammed down from above.

Someone else was attacking!

Yang Ye looked up. He saw a huge palm descend from above them. It had emerged from the clouds, and it was slamming down at them. The power energy it carried caused both Nansi Yin and him to feel suffocated beneath it!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, and then a ray of light shot up into the sky.

It seemed capable of piercing through the sky!

The rays of light stabbed straight through the palm, causing it to shatter and rain down as pieces of energy.

Meanwhile, a black robed man appeared before them.

The black robed man said, “Hand over the inheritance and I’ll leave immediately!”

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath and just swung his sword. A ray of light instantly arrived before the black robed man.

Meanwhile, the black robed man stretched out his right hand. There was a palm-sized mirror there. As soon as Yang Ye’s sword energy struck it, it shook slightly, and then a ray of light shot out from it and instantly arrived before Yang Ye!

Reflection!

Surprise flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes. He didn’t give it another moment of thought, and he just swung his sword, causing the sword energy to be obliterated before him.

Meanwhile, the black robed man said, “Miss Nansi, I have no intention to go against the Nansi Clan. Leave the inheritance behind and you can leave.”

Nansi Yin spoke indifferently, “You already are!”

The black robed man fell silent. A short while passed before he gazed at Yang Ye, “Your strength is extraordinary, so I presume you’re not any ordinary person. However, do you know how many people desire that inheritance? I presume you’re an extraordinary figure since you possess such strength at your age, so why lose your life here?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Actually, you don’t have to say all of that. Since you want it, come get it.”

The black robed man fell silent for a moment, and then he transformed into a string of afterimages that shot towards Yang Ye.

Yang Ye drew his sword and swung it.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the black robed man was blasted to where he’d come from while Yang Ye had been pushed around 1km back too.

As soon as Yang Ye stopped himself, the black robed man vanished on the spot again. An instant later, a shadow appeared above Yang Ye, and then a black palm slapped down towards his head. The space around Yang Ye warped severely under the pressure from the palm, and it clearly displayed how powerful the attack was.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Sword!”

As soon as he commanded, 10 ethereal swords appeared around him, and then they enveloped him and the black robed man.

Rays of light crisscrossed!

Meanwhile, Nansi Yin stared at the battlefield.

Boom!

Suddenly, it exploded apart, and then a black shadow was blasted away from it.

Nansi Yin visibly relaxed at the sight of this.

At the same moment that the figure was blasted away, a strand of sword energy appeared before it.

Close quarters combat!

This was Yang Ye’s true goal. He didn’t use powerful techniques like the Sword Domain, Split Second, or Heavenrend because they exhausted him too much. They didn’t just exhaust his profound energy, they exhausted him physically too. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Even though he had immortal crystals and could swiftly replenish his profound energy, based on the situation they were in right now, both Nansi Yin and him may die within that short moment he needed to recover his profound energy.

He had to kill his enemies while using the least amount of his strength!

He was fighting a battle of attrition!

The black robed man was clearly not an ordinary expert, but his nightmare arrived when he started fighting Yang Ye in close quarters. Yang Ye’s ability to fight in close quarters was horrifying. Every single swing of his sword was extremely tricky to defend again, and the most terrifying part was his strength. Even 6th stage True Realm demon beasts couldn’t compete with him in physical strength!

The black robed man was being pushed back!

After fighting Yang Ye in close quarters, the black robed man was being pushed back repeatedly. He was completely and utterly suppressed!

Bang!

Suddenly, a loud explosion resounded, and the black robed man was blasted away.

At that exact same instant, Yang Ye tapped his finger forward. The space around the black robed man was instantly sliced apart, and then a ray of light shot out from there and struck the black robed man.

Bang!

The black robed man was blasted far away. As soon as he hit the ground, Yang Ye appeared before him again, and then a ray of light slashed down.

Even though he’d been heavily injured, the black robed man clearly wouldn’t just wait for death to arrive. A mirror suddenly appeared above him, and then a ray of golden light surged out from it.

Boom!

Yang Ye was caught off guard and was pushed away. However, he stopped himself after moving just 300m back. The clothes above his chest had been blasted into pieces, but his body was completely fine.

There was another thing that was terrifying about Yang Ye, and it was his physical strength and defenses!

The black robed man spoke with disbelief, “Impossible… You…”

His voice stopped abruptly because a ray of sword energy had arrived.

The mirror in his hand transformed into a ray of golden light that shot up into the air, but he hadn’t noticed that the sword in Yang Ye’s grasp had been changed.

Spiritbreaker!

Yang Ye had exchanged his previous sword for the Spiritbreaker!

Boom!

The golden light from the mirror seemed like snow that collided with hot oil when it was struck by Yang Ye’s sword, and it instantly vanished without a trace. Yang Ye’s sword slammed down, and the mirror exploded apart into bits that rained down from the sky.

However, Yang Ye’s sword didn’t stop there.

“No!” A shrill and miserable cry resounded, but it only took a moment for it to stop abruptly.

Hiss!

The black robed man’s figure was split into two, and his internal organs sprayed all over the ground!

The surroundings fell silent!

There was a trace of solemness in Yang Ye’s eyes as he gazed at the corpse before him.

Even though he’d killed the black robed man, it didn’t represent that the black robed man was weak. Conversely, the black robed man was very strong, and he knew that those who came next would definitely be stronger and stronger.

The black robed man wasn’t the end, he was just the beginning!

Yang Ye lowered his sword and looked at Nansi Yin, “Let’s go!”

She nodded and walked over to his side. Yang Ye didn’t fly on his sword, and he just started walking slowly with her.

Even though he hadn’t exhausted much strength just now, he still had exhausted some of it. So, he’d consumed an immortal crystal. Moreover, he was even using the Primordial Violet Energy to heal his body.

While being struck by that mirror wasn’t lethal to him, it still wasn’t a painless experience.

In short, he had to stay at full strength at all times!

They didn’t walk very quickly, or it should be said to be quite slow. Based on their current speed, it would probably take more than a month to leave the Shaman Dimension. That was exactly why the people hiding in the shadows weren’t in a hurry to attack. But if Yang Ye flew on his sword, someone would have attacked by now!

That was Yang Ye’s true intentions!

Meanwhile, Nansi Yin suddenly asked, “Will we be able to get out of the Shaman Dimension?”

Yang Ye shrugged, “I’m not very sure. Er, so if your father does come, are you sure he’ll be able to take you back?”

She nodded, “My Nansi Clan’s Soul Attendants will definitely come with him. Perhaps even some old fellows in closed door cultivation will come too. In short, if he comes, then unless the Shaman Progenitor of the shaman race shows himself or some other Sage does, we’ll definitely be safe!”

Yang Ye said, “Looks like your father is very strong!”

Nansi Yins smiled, “He’s extremely strong. He can casually kill 10 experts like that black robed man from before!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened. Does she know how to talk?

Meanwhile, Nansi Yin smiled embarrassedly, “Actually, you’re very strong too. Perhaps you’ll be even stronger than my father when you’re at his age!”

Yang Ye smiled. He was about to speak when he suddenly looked up. The ground not too far ahead had suddenly cracked open, and then a pitch black hand stretched out from below.

What the hell? Yang Ye frowned.
