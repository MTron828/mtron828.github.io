Chapter 2459 - The Blade’s Soul!

A single swing that went all the way to the bottom!

The entire mountain had been sliced into two, causing an endless cloud of smoke and dust to shoot up into the air.

As for the remnant soul of the Freedom Sect’s ancestor, it had vanished without a trace!

Countless experts from the Freedom Sect fled madly in all directions.

Yang Ye didn’t spare them. A ray of light instantly flew out of the Sword Gourd, and then shrill cries resounded throughout the distant sky.

Meanwhile, Erya appeared here.

She would go over and devour everyone Yang Ye killed.

The more she ate, the stronger she became!

Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye turned around and left.

Behind him was an expanse of ruins and countless corpses.

Practically all the Limitbreaker Realm experts of the Freedom Sect had been annihilated!

It didn’t take long for the news of Yang Ye’s deeds in the Longevity Sect and Freedom Sect to spread.

The entire Eternal Border was shocked!

The most shocked were naturally the remaining two supreme powers, the Creation Sect and Immortality Sect!

They hadn’t expected Yang Ye’s strength to be at such a level after returning to Eternal Border!

He was killing Four World Realm experts with ease!

Those two sects weren’t the only ones who were shocked, the experts throughout Eternal Border were shocked.

There were even rumors that Yang Ye had attained the legendary Five World Realm.

Some were happy, others were filled with worry. The happy were naturally those who wanted to watch the show, and the worried were naturally those powers like the Creation Sect and Immortality Sect. Because they were very well aware that Yang Ye would be coming for them.

Sure enough, Yang Ye arrived at the Creation Sect two hours later.

However, it was completely empty when he arrived!

They’d fled!

Yang Ye frowned. He glanced at the surroundings and swept it with his divine sense, but he sensed no signs of life.

A cold smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, and then he swung his sword.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Rays of sword energy entered the Creation Sect below and instantly transformed it into ruins!

Yang Ye left, and it didn’t take him long to get to the Immortality Sect. However, just like the Creation Sect, there wasn’t a soul in sight!

They’d all fled!

Yang Ye laughed coldly, “It won’t make a difference no matter where you flee!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and left. But a ray of sword energy shot down into the Immortality Sect!

Boom!

The entire Immortality Sect was transformed into ruins!

Yang Ye went to the Nanli Clan again. In the room, Yang Ye placed 10 World Crystals before Nanli Meng, “I need information on their whereabouts!”

She asked, “Why don’t you just look for the people of Eternal Kingdom?”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “I will, but I plan to deal with these people from Eternal Border before that.”

Nanli Meng sighed softly, “I’m sure you realize that they are no threat to you. Of course, I’m not trying to speak on their behalf. Your revenge is within reason, and even I may do the same. But…”

“There’s no need for buts!” Yang Ye suddenly interrupted her, “Miss Meng, I presume you’re not the only one with access to a special information organization in Eternal Border. I just don’t want to trouble myself with it, so I came to you. If you refuse, just be frank and I’ll get someone else to help me. Let’s just stop wasting each other’s time. I’ll be honest, I’ve completely lost my patience. And don’t even try those high and mighty principles with me. I’m afraid I’ll lose control and do something bad!”

She frowned slightly, “Are you threatening me?”

Suddenly, An Nanjing appeared by Yang Ye’s side. She gazed at Nanli Meng and walked over to the latter, “Him and I won’t have a problem slaughtering your clan. Want to give it a try?”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Nanli Meng’s eyes narrowed slightly. She was about to speak when Yang Ye stood up abruptly, “Miss Meng, there’s another thing which I want to know. Did the mysterious organization you’re from hunt me too?”

Nanli Meng’s face became quite unsightly.

Yang Ye smiled coldly, “Looks like they did. But it does make sense. I was weak and had a Sprite Progenitor, so how could they possibly not target me?”

Nanli Meng spoke solemnly, “Yang Ye, are you really going to continue killing?”

Yang Ye walked over to her, “Miss Meng, to be honest, I don’t want to listen to your nonsense anymore. The friendship we formed in the Primal Ruins has been destroyed by your nonsense. I don’t want to waste my breath on you, so I’ll be frank. I can let bygones be bygones with that organization that stands behind you, but I need the information I want. Is that a problem?”

He'd really lost all patience!

Nanli Meng gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and flicked a talisman over to Yang Ye, “It’s a transmission talisman. I’ll investigate their whereabouts immediately and notify you once I have the information!”

Yang Ye took it and said, “Don’t make me wait too long!”

He turned around and walked away, but he suddenly stopped at the door, “Miss Meng, allow me to be honest, you spout too much nonsense. I hope you don’t do that when we meet again. I’m serious, I don’t have the time to listen to all of that.”Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Nanli Meng remained silent in the room, and no one knew what she was thinking.

…

Yang Ye left the Nanli Clan and went into space before entering the Primordial Pagoda.

On the Ascension Platform.

Yang Ye stood at the center of it while Oxxy, Erya, Sword Scroll, Snowy, the Primal True Dragon, the Primal Vicious Tiger, and the Martial Qilin stood around him!

All who could fight were here!

Yang Ye glanced at them. The demons were all at the Four World Realm, and they weren’t ordinary Four World Realm experts. Especially Erya and the Primal True Dragon, they could even fight Five World Realm experts. Of course, it was under the circumstances that the Five World Realm expert’s strength was suppressed to the Four World Realm. Even Erya and the Primal True Dragon couldn’t go against true Five World Realm experts. Actually, even Yang Ye wasn’t confident in his ability to do so.

Would Erya, An Nanjing, and him have a chance against a true Five World Realm expert?

Sword Scroll gave him the answer he sought.

Yes!

Even if it was a Five World Realm expert, their joint forces had a very good chance at killing such an expert. Because all three of them weren’t ordinary experts, and they had either Divine Treasures or Super Divine Treasures coupled with various powerful inheritances.

It wouldn’t be difficult for their joint forces to kill a true Five World Realm expert. But if it was a one on one battle, then it would be quite difficult. They would have a 30% chance at most!

As for the Primal True Dragon and the others, Five World Realm experts were beyond them. However, ordinary Four World Realm experts were no match for them.

Improve their strength!

That was what Yang Ye wanted!

Yang Ye gazed at Sword Scroll, “Do you have any ideas on how to improve their combat strength? Normal methods and not those that will cause side effects.”

Sword Scroll replied, “The most effective method is for Snowy to grow more Chaotic Fruits. Their combat strength will grow as they eat them!”

Sword Scroll had quite complicated emotions in her heart. These demons were really lucky because they were eating Chaotic Fruits like candy… Since the ancient times, perhaps they were the only ones able to enjoy something like that.

Snowy blinked and hurriedly nodded. However, she seemed to have thought of something and glared at the Primal True Dragon! Oxxy and the others had advanced the other day, but the dragon hadn’t. As far as Snowy was concerned, the dragon was a lazy bum! A lazy bum who just ate but didn’t do work!

The dragon howled with agony in its heart when it saw Snowy glare at it.

My great lord Snowy! The Four World Realm and Five World Realm are completely different things!

Unfortunately, Snowy didn’t understand all of that. All she knew was that the dragon hadn’t advanced after eating a fruit!

The Primal True Dragon felt utterly helpless!

Yang Ye gazed at Erya, “Erya and Oxxy, you two learn from An Nanjing, understand?”

Erya nodded, “I will.”

Since she started learning from An Nanjing, even Erya herself felt that she’d changed a lot. Or it should be said that she’d grown much stronger, and she didn’t just use brute force as she had in the past!

It could be said that if Erya used the Demon Wings of Death, even Yang Ye and An Nanjing wouldn’t dare to fight her carelessly.

Actually, the Primal True Dragon was strong too, but it was completely hidden beneath Erya’s shadow.

After arranging everything in the pago, Yang Ye left it, withdrew the Myriad World Diagram, and went to the Northern Desolate World.

The Northern Desolate World!

He had something to do there!

Yang Ye went to the area beneath the Northern Sword Sect, and he saw the mysterious man still there in the hall.

The mysterious sword cultivator was Chen Xuanan!

Chen Xuanan glanced at Yang Ye, “You’re here!”

Yang Ye said, “You knew I would come?”

Chen Xuanan nodded, “You’re here for that sword, right?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Executor!

Executor only had 20% of its strength unsealed, and that wasn’t enough for Yang Ye. Moreover, as a Super Divine Treasure, its current state was really quite weak!

A Super Divine Treasure should look the part!

Actually, besides being a little sharper, Executor didn’t have anything special about it!

Chen Xuanan nodded slightly, “Yes, it should be stronger.”

Executor suddenly left the Sword Gourd and floated before Chen Xuanan.

Chen Xuanan gazed at it and closed his eyes slowly. The sword gradually started to tremble.

It was being unsealed!

Yang Ye knew that he was unsealing it!

Just like that, a long time passed before a dazzling sword howl resounded from it!

The sword howl shook the world!

The powerful sword howl caused the space in a huge area around the Northern Sword Sect to quake!

A short while later, Executor floated over to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye noticed a strand of light that was thin as a hair flowing slowly on the sword’s blade.

“50%!” Chen Xuanan explained, “I unsealed its strength to 50%. Your current strength is just nice to control that amount.”

Yang Ye nodded and pointed at the light on the sword’s blade, “What is this?”

Chen Xuanan smiled, “Executor’s Blade Soul. I didn’t dare to unseal it before this because I was afraid you couldn’t control it. Now, your strength should be sufficient for that!”

The blades of swords had spirits too?

Yang Ye was stunned.
