Chapter 2474 – I Have Nothing Else to Say!

Not afraid of Snowy!

Yang Ye suddenly thought of something when he heard this. When he introduced Erya and Oxxy to Snowy, Oxxy displayed innate fear and respect for Snowy, but Erya didn’t!

Erya was merely curious!

Erya didn’t try to constantly flatter Snowy like the others did, and her relationship with Snowy was very, very friendly. They were true friends.

A short while later, Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “Forget that. As far as we’re concerned, Erya is Erya, and she will always be Erya, right?”

Sword Scroll nodded. Erya was a child, a child who’d been raised by humans. Her view of the world, life, and good and bad were almost identical to that of humans. Perhaps that was why the old man with the bamboo chest was willing to help Erya!

Regardless of whether it was demon beasts, humans, or any other living beings, they were like a blank sheet of paper when they were just born. If humans drew on that paper, they would naturally have views that were closer to humans, but if they grew up with demon beasts, they would have a completely different character.

Yang Ye gazed at An Nanjing, “Teach her more combat techniques. If she has your instinct in combat and that abnormal body of hers, then even both of us together would probably not be a match for her!”

He wasn’t joking! It was a sincere comment!

Erya’s strength and physical defenses were so powerful, they could almost induce despair in him. If she had An Nanjing’s combat instinct too, it was obvious that both he and An Nanjing would be no match for Erya!

He didn’t feel it was embarrassing to be no match for Erya. As far as he was concerned, she was a friend. It was the same for An Nanjing. It didn’t matter if Erya or An Nanjing were stronger than him, he would sincerely feel happy for them!

He wasn’t someone who couldn’t bear to see his friends and loved ones surpass him!

Yang Ye bid farewell to An Nanjing and Sword Scroll, and then he went to the cultivation room. He withdrew the Universe Seal there!

The strength to destroy 10 worlds!

It could break through any formation and barrier too!

Actually, it was equivalent to a Super Divine Treasure.

If he suddenly used it in battle, he would be absolutely capable of giving his opponent a huge “pleasant surprise”.

Yang Ye flicked a drop of blood into the seal, and then a link between them was formed. At the same time, the method to utilize it appeared in his mind!

He had quite a few Divine Treasures now, and his goal was to use them perfectly.

Treasures were still a part of a person’s strength!

Around two hours later, Yang Ye suddenly looked up, and then he left the Primordial Pagoda.

Outside the pagoda, the Universe Wall ahead suddenly trembled, and then a man in armor walked out from behind it.

The man glanced at the surroundings and gazed at Yang Ye, “Who are you?”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “Why don’t you guess?”

The man’s gaze turned icy cold, “Do you want this day next year to be the day of your death’s anniversary?”

Swoosh!

A ray of sword energy flashed.

Hiss!

The man’s figure stiffened on the spot. His eyes were opened wide and filled with disbelief.

An instant later, his head fell off his neck.

Blood sprayed like a fountain!

Disbelief still filled his eyes. Even until the moment of his death, he couldn’t believe that he’d died just like that! He was a peak Four World Realm expert, but he hadn’t been able to resist a single attack!

At the moment of his death, he figured out something, and it was the identity of the person before him.

It was Yang Ye!

Yang Ye glanced at the Universe Wall. If he wanted, he could go inside right now. He naturally planned to visit Eternal Kingdom. After all, Snowy had an inheritance to collect over there!

The Sprite Progenitor had told Snowy that once she went over there, she would be the master of Sprite Palace. No, the Sprite Master of it. Moreover, he wanted to see what Eternal Kingdom was like! Besides that, Tian Xiu was over there too!

However, his strength had to be improved a little before he did venture there. Otherwise, if he went right now, he may never come back. Eternal Kingdom feared the desolate race and didn’t dare to send more Five World Realm experts. Even if they did send some, those experts would stay by the Universe Wall and dare not make an appearance in Eternal Border itself. Because once Five World Realm experts showed themselves in Eternal Border, the desolate race would definitely kill them!

However, if he went to Eternal Border, it was obvious that he would definitely die.

Yang Ye returned to the Primordial Pagoda and went to Sword Scroll, “I need to ask for your guidance. How do I improve my body right now?”

His body!

He had to improve his body now, and then improve his cultivation. Only then could he guarantee that nothing wrong would occur when he advanced. But improving his body was a troublesome thing.

His body was just at the True World Realm, and improving it to the Limitbreaker Realm was very difficult!

Sword Scroll thought for a moment and replied, “Your body’s foundation is very good, so it shouldn’t be too difficult to improve. Besides that, you must improve another thing. I think you can develop your Sword Domain further!”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The Sword Domain!

Yang Ye nodded. It was true, he had to improve the Sword Domain too. While the Sword Domain was very powerful right now, his enemies were much more powerful than they had been in the past!

His body, cultivation, and Sword Domain!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “I’ll start with my body!”

Once he improved his body, he could improve his cultivation! At that time, once his body and cultivation were strong enough, he could study the Sword Domain properly!

One step at a time!

Sword Scroll nodded, “You should take it one step at a time. Your foundation is very good, and that’s your advantage. Once your body is improved as well, your cultivation will naturally rise. However, we’ll have to research how to improve your body further. Right, didn’t the old man with the bamboo chest give you a bottle of blood the other time? There should be more blood in there!”

The blood of a God!

Yang Ye’s eyes lit up because he’d almost forgotten that! He’d only used a single drop from that bottle, and it was that bottle which brought his body to its current realm. But after that, he’d actually forgotten it due to many reasons.

Yang Ye hurriedly withdrew the bottle, and there were quite a few drops left in there!

Yang Ye swallowed all of them!

He had the Mad Demon Bloodline to protect him, so he didn’t fear the energy in this blood at all.

As soon as the blood entered his body, a strand of extremely pure energy dispersed throughout his body.

A burning sensation started to spread within him!

His body had started to absorb the energy, and it was gradually undergoing some sort of transformation!

A transformation!

As for the heartrending pain from before, he didn’t experience it. Because his blood restrained the violent energy contained within the blood, all of it was restrained by his blood! Time trickled by, and a long time passed before Yang Ye’s body shook. If one looked carefully, one would notice that his body was tightening!

It was growing tighter and tighter!

Three days later.

Boom!

A powerful aura rippled out from Yang Ye. The space around him rippled like a rock had fallen into a pool.

Pure physical strength!

Yang Ye had absorbed all the energy in the blood, and his body was at the World Lord Realm right now!

The World Lord Realm in the body! It wasn’t enough for Yang Ye at all! At the very least, he needed it at the Limitbreaker Realm!

The desolate race!

Yang Ye had decided to seek help from the desolate race. They were such a huge race, so they definitely had ways to improve the body.

As far as he was concerned, his main goal was to improve his strength!

Yang Ye left the pagoda, glanced at the corpses before the Universe Wall, and then hesitated for a moment before taking one of them. It was the corpse of Sword Sky City’s ancestor.

His relationship with them wasn’t bad.

Yang Ye was about to leave when the wall suddenly shook, and Yang Ye frowned from the sight of this. A short while later, a voice came from behind it, “You’re Yang Ye, right?”

That fellow isn’t showing himself? Yang Ye wondered and said, “It’s me!”

The voice said, “The governor of White Emperor City is in my Eternal Kingdom’s hands!”

Yang Ye replied, “So what?”

The voice asked, “Don’t you want to save him?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course I do, but I’m very well aware that only a living person can save anyone. If I go to you now, I’ll just die with him.”

The voice suddenly said, “He’ll die if you don’t come here!”

Yang Ye smiled and said, “There’s no need for threats. Let me put it like this. If anyone close to me or linked to me dies, then I’ll take the Sprite Progenitor and side with the desolate race. I’ll make her summon the spirit of the world to attack Eternal Kingdom with the desolate race!”

The voice suddenly turned icy cold, “How dare you!”

Yang Ye laughed with ridicule, “Why wouldn’t I dare to? Tell that Eternal Lord of yours, if anything happens to the governor of White Emperor City, then I’ll definitely lead the Sprite Progenitor to attack Eternal Kingdom with the desolate race! As for whether I dare to do that, you go and investigate me for yourself! When have I ever feared anything in my lifetime? When have I ever been afraid to do something? If you think I dare not, then kill him!”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away.

“Yang Ye!” The voice resounded abruptly, “Perhaps we can talk…”

“I have nothing else to say!” Yang Ye didn’t even turn back and just vanished into the distance.
