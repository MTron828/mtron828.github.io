Chapter 1667 - Have You Prepared Coffins For Your Whole Family?

Translator: InVader

Yang Xuan stared at Yang Ye, “It’s a trap for you. Yang Xing is extremely vengeful. You took his Blood Puppets and killed his subordinates, so he’ll never let the matter rest. You’re the real reason they acted against Lu Lige. So, if you go to the Lu Clan, you’ll be jumping into a trap! Understand?”

Yang Ye walked over to her and looked her in the eye, “Then what do you think I should do?”

Yang Xuan spoke in a low voice, “Ignore it! So long as you don’t leave Phecda City, all schemes will be powerless against you!”

“Ignore it?” Yang Ye suddenly chuckled, “Even though he was merely at the Rebirth Realm, he still rushed over when I was in trouble. Yet now, he’s suffering because of me, and you’re asking me to ignore it?”

Yang Xuan remained silent for a few moments and said, “Prioritize your main goals. Understand?”

“No!” Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “You said there’s no familial love in the Yang Clan, and I can understand that. However, don’t use that on me. If someone doesn’t betray me, then I will never betray them. Lu Lige never betrayed me, so how can I betray him? Moreover, he’s in this situation because of me. If I ignore him for the sake of the Yang Clan’s succession battle, then I would really be worse than a dog!”

Yang Xuan was about to say something, but Yang Ye suddenly said, “I’ll ask you one last time! Tell me where the Lu Clan is! I’m serious! Don’t spout another word of nonsense. Alright?”

Yang Xuan gazed at him for a long time, and then she flicked a white ray of light into the center of his forehead, “That’s a map of the medium universe in Milky Way System, and the locations of the eight clans are marked on it. Besides the eight clans, many dangerous places are marked too…”

She suddenly stopped when she spoke up to this point because Yang Ye had vanished on the spot.

After he left, Gu Xiu and Qian Hu immediately appeared by Yang Xuan’s side.

Gu Xiu spoke in a low voice, “That fellow isn’t very easy to control!”

Qian Hu said, “Why control him? Isn’t he doing exactly what our master wants? The more chaos he causes, and the more ruthless he is, the better it is for our master, isn’t it?”

Gu Xiu shook his head slightly while a wisp of worry flashed through his eyes, “I’m afraid he’ll grow beyond our control…”

A cold smile curled up on the corners of Qian Hu’s mouth, “So what if he does? Can he compete with our master?”

Gu Xiu seemed to relax slightly when he heard this, “True…”

Meanwhile, Yang Xuan remained silent as if she hadn’t heard them.

…

After he got the map from Yang Xuan, Yang Ye didn’t stay a moment longer and left Heaven Void Continent as quickly as he could.

Once Yang Ye left the city, a man smiled from within the city. He was the Yang Clan’s fourth young master, Yang

As he gazed at the sky, Yang Ru waved his folding fan lightly and said, “Seventh Brother, this is all I can do for you. Whether you can kill him or not will be up to you and the Lu Clan’s successor.”

Yang Ru turned around and vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

…

After he entered outer space, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he tapped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that vanished towards the left.

The Lu Clan.

The Lu Clan was situated in Skyfire System. It was quite far from the Yang Clan, and even a Zenith Realm expert would take two days and two nights to fly there from the Yang Clan.

Yang Ye didn’t conserve his profound energy as he traveled, and he pushed his speed to its limits.

A ray of light seemed like a shooting star as it shot through the boundless starry sky, and an extremely long spatial rift was left behind in its wake.

Skyfire System. Skyfire Continent.

Skyfire Continent was the main world of the Lu Clan, and it was the Lu Clan’s headquarters.

Skyfire City.

Skyfire City was the busiest city under the Lu Clan, and it was the largest city on Skyfire Continent. At this moment, its entrance was much busier than normal because a young man was hanging from its entrance.

It was Lu Lige!

The members of the Lu Clan naturally knew who Lu Lige was. Or it should be said that Lu Lige was slightly famous in the Lu Clan. After all, he had cultivated to the Rebirth Realm without relying on the Lu Clan, and his saber intent was at the Returnal Rank!

Actually, many people from the Lu Clan felt slight admiration towards him, and it was even to the extent that the higher-ups of the Lu Clan had the intent to accept him back into the clan.

However, no one had expected that Lu Lige had offended the successor of the Lu Clan, Lu Yuanzhan!

Even though Lu Lige was a genius, he was much more inferior to Lu Yuanzhan. Because Lu Yuanzhan was at the Zenith Realm, and he was even ranked at the 17th position on the Milky Way Rankings.

The 17th!

It was an extremely terrifying number. There were millions and billions of geniuses throughout the medium universe of Milky Way System, so being able to be ranked at the 17th position amongst them was sufficient to display how terrifying his potential and strength were. The successor of the Lu Clan was the next patriarch of the Lu Clan, so the Lu Clan would definitely do all it could to foster its future patriarch.

A man appeared at the entrance to the city. It was Yang Xing.

Yang Xing looked up at Lu Lige, “Do you think Yang Ye will come to save you?”

Lu Lige slowly opened his eyes. He glanced at Yang Xing, “Bastard! If you want to kill me, then kill me! Why talk nonsense?”

A cold smile curled up on the corners of Yang Xing’s mouth, “You have quite the temper. However, it’s useless. As for your desire to die. Don’t worry, you will definitely die. However, you have to watch Yang Ye die first. You can only die once he’s dead. Of course, if he doesn’t come, then I’ll send you to hell first!”

“Brother Xing, will Yang Ye really come?” Suddenly, a voice came from afar, and it didn’t take long for a man in an embroidered robe to appear at the entrance to the city.

It was the successor of the Lu Clan, Lu Yuanzhan!

Yang Xing gazed at him, “Brother Yuanzhan, just ignore what’s happening today. I can deal with it on my own!”

Lu Yuanzhan was visibly displeased, “Brother Xing, hearing that makes me unhappy. Even though we’re not linked by blood, we’re close like brothers. Your business is my business.”

Yang Xing hesitated for a moment and said, “I’m very moved by the fact you were willing to give me Lu Lige. I’m serious. Brother Yuanzhan, don’t interfere in this matter so as to avoid causing trouble for the old geezers of your clan!”

Lu Yuanzhan grunted coldly, “Just ignore those old fellows. Brother Xing, there’s no need to say anything. If you hadn’t lent me a hand that day, I would have died at the hands of that demon beast. So, don’t worry. I’ll definitely use all my strength to help you seize the position of successor in the Yang Clan!”

Yang Xing hesitated for a moment and nodded, “Thank you!”

Even though he said that, he was laughing coldly in his heart. How could he not be aware that Lu Yuanzhan had other reasons to help him like that? He needed Lu Yuanzhan’s assistance, and Lu Yuanzhan similarly needed his assistance! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Because the position of successor in the Lu Clan wasn’t a permanent position. So long as the other young masters of the Lu Clan rose to prominence, then it was very likely that they would beat him down. So, Lu Yuanzhan was seated at the top of the ladder in the Lu Clan, and he needed powerful assistance from outside the Lu Clan!

They were using each other!

Not to mention these young masters, even the eight clans did the same between each other!

Lu Yuanzhan nodded slightly when he heard Yang Xing, and then he gazed at Lu Lige, “Lu Lige, needless to say, you’re really extraordinary. However, you’re stupid as well. You actually dared to return to the Lu Clan. Do you really think the clan wants you back?”

He laughed coldly and continued, “You’re dreaming. Did you know that the clan wanted to kill you from a very long time ago? Do you know why? Because every step forward you take is a slap on the clan’s face. So, do you understand now?”

A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of Lu Lige’s mouth, “Indeed. My growth is an embarrassment for the clan. Haha…”

Lu Yuanzhan smiled coldly, and then he turned to look at Yang Xing, “Brother Xing, do you think Yang Ye will come?”

Yang Xing spoke indifferently, “Based on my investigations of him, he should come.”

Lu Yuanzhan nodded slightly, “I heard he has a woman by his side, and she’s extremely strong…”

Yang Xing smiled, “Don’t worry. There’ll be someone to deal with her.”

Lu Yuanzhan glanced at Yang Xing and smiled, “Looks like you’ve made sufficient preparations.”

“Of course!” Yang Xing smiled, “I refuse to repeat Yang Yan’s mistakes!”

Lu Yuanzhan smiled, “Good. Don’t worry, I’ll help you.”

Yang Xing nodded slightly, “Thank you!”

Lu Yuanzhan smiled, and then he turned to look at Lu Lige, “Then let’s wait!”

Time trickled by. In the blind of an eye, a day had passed, but Yang Ye still hadn’t arrived.

Noon.

Lu Yuanzhan gazed at Yang Xing and smiled, “Brother Xing, looks like your cousin brother isn’t coming.”

Yang Xing spoke indifferently, “Looks like while he seems to be rash, he thinks things through!”

As he spoke, he looked up at Lu Lige, “Lu Lige, you’re a cripple now. Living is suffering for you. Since it’s like that, I’ll do a good deed and send you off.”

“Wait!” Suddenly, Lu Yuanzhan gazed at Lu Lige and smiled, “Lu Lige, do you regret helping Yang Ye?”

Lu Lige gazed at Lu Yuanzhan, “I make friends with my heart, so it has nothing to do with regret. If he comes, I’ll be happy; if he doesn’t, I’ll be happy as well. Because I know that he’ll definitely avenge me one day. Besides that, if I fucking survive, I’m going to twist of your head and make it my chamber pot!”

Lu Yuanzhan’s eyes narrowed slightly, “You may not have a chance to do that!”

As he spoke, he was about to attack.

However, a ray of light suddenly flashed through the air. It didn’t take long for it to descend to the ground, and the light dispersed to reveal the figure of a man.

It was Yang Ye, of course!

Yang Ye walked slowly in Yang Xing’s direction as he said, “Yang Xing, have you prepared coffins for your whole family?”
