Chapter 1880 – Stellar Ward!

Around 15 minutes later, Yun Bi led Yang Ye to the foot of a mountain. There was a pool there. But the water in it was quite strange because it was crystal blue.

Yang Ye gazed at her, and the latter grinned, “Sky Devil Pool. It isn’t water but stellar energy that’s within the pool!”

“Stellar energy?” Yang Ye was stunned, and then he turned to look at the Sky Devil Pool. After looking carefully, Yang Ye noticed that it was indeed stellar energy. However, it was slightly different from the stellar energy he usually saw!

Yun Bi said, “This stellar energy is the purest form of it found deep within outer space. Because we gathered stellar energy and exhausted a huge amount of manpower to purify it, allowing it to be devoid of even a trace of impurities. If you absorb this purest form of stellar energy, your body will definitely rise to a new height.”

Yang Ye was astounded, “All of this is for me?”

Yun Bi’s face stiffened slightly, but it only took a moment for it to return to normal. She glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Of course not. You just have to attain Divine Strength. This stellar energy was gathered through the hard work of my ancestors, and it was gathered to foster more geniuses.”

She glanced at Yang Ye and didn’t speak further.

Yang Ye smiled embarrassedly, “I was just joking!”

She nodded slightly, “To display my race’s sincerity, I’m willing to help you improve your body first.” She waved his right hand slightly. In an instant, the stellar energy within the pool started to bubble.

Yang Ye asked, “Aren’t you afraid that I would go back on my word?”

She looked him in the eyes, “Will you?”

Yang Ye replied, “What if I do?”

She spoke indifferently, “Maybe you can try!”

Yang Ye smiled and didn’t speak further. He just entered the pool

Bang!

As soon as he entered it, the entire pool trembled, and it didn’t take long for countless strands of stellar energy to converge towards him.

Comfortable!

Extremely comfortable!

That was how Yang Ye felt right now. After the stellar energy entered his body, it was swiftly absorbed by his body.

The Stellar Ward!

At this moment, Yang Ye thought of the Stellar Ward technique!

He’d learned the Stellar Ward technique in Merak System. In the beginning, it was extremely useful to him. But as time passed, it became insignificant, and so he slowly forgot it.

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then his profound energy suddenly started to circulate.

He’d decided to cultivate the Stellar Ward technique again. Of course, the original Stellar Ward technique was naturally useless to him. After all, his current physical body was much stronger than the effects of the Stellar Ward technique!

So, he intended to modify and improve the Stellar Ward technique!

Time trickled by. Yang Ye was absorbing more and more stellar energy, and crystal blue scales were gradually appearing on him. More and more scales were appearing. From just a small area, they’d spread to cover his entire body.

In the end, Yang Ye’s entire face was covered in crystal blue scales, but it didn’t take long for them to start turning ethereal. In the end, they gradually vanished. Actually, they hadn’t vanished, they’d turned translucent!

Translucent!

The scales covering Yang Ye’s body had become translucent!

Yun Bi frowned slightly. Because Yang Ye was absorbing more and more stellar energy.

As she watched the stellar energy in the pool grow lesser and lesser, Yun Bi’s frown deepened. At this moment, she felt slight regret. Because even she didn’t dare rashly use the pure stellar energy in the pool.

It was too precious!

Yet now, Yang Ye was absorbing it without restraint, and he seemed like a bottomless pit!

Around half an hour later, Yun Bi decided to stop him when she saw that he was still absorbing the stellar energy in the pool. However, Sky Devil Pool suddenly calmed down.

Yang Ye had stopped absorbing the stellar energy!

Yun Bi heaved a sigh of relief in her heart. Because if Yang Ye continued, then she would have no choice but to stop him. Fortunately, he’d stopped on his own.

Suddenly, Yang Ye opened his eyes.

A ray of crystal blue light flashed through his eyes!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to stand up. He took a deep breath and clenched his fists. In an instant, crystal blue light flowed throughout his body. The crystal blue light were like fine threads that flickered and coiled throughout his body!

Yun Bi asked, “What’s that?”

Yang Ye glanced at the crystal blue light on himself and smiled, “A technique!”

She nodded slightly, “It’s not bad!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and gazed at Yun Bi, “Senior, I’d like to seek guidance from you!”

At this moment, he felt like his entire body was filled with strength, and he wanted to know how far the gap between him and the top experts of this world was.

Yun Bi was the patriarch of the Sky Devils, so even if her strength couldn’t compare to those three ancient cultivators in Heaven Pillar Mountain, it was definitely not much inferior.

Yun Bi gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before she asked, “Are you sure?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’d like to give it a try!”

She nodded slightly and waved her right hand. In an instant, they vanished on the spot.

A few breaths of time later, they arrived high above in the air. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

She said, “Come! Attack me!”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “Senior, you attack first!”

Yun Bi asked, ‘Are you sure?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She nodded, and then she vanished on the spot. Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically when she vanished.

At the instant she vanished, he suddenly noticed that the entire sky was covered in specks of black light. A moment later, the black light rained down upon him like a storm!

It was capable of obliterating the world!

That was what Yang Ye sensed from it!

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he took a step forward. As soon as he did that, the space in an area of 500m around him shook violently. At the same time, 36 ethereal swords appeared around him.

“Slash!” As soon as he gave the order, rays of light instantly covered the area of 500m around him!

Around 15 minutes later, everything returned to normal.

Yang Ye was still there, and so was Yun Bi.

At this moment, Yun Bi had quite a solemn expression on her face. She gazed at him for a long time and said, “Unbelievable!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “You’re much stronger than I imagined!”

Yun Bi shook her head slightly. Even though she hadn’t used her full strength just now, she hadn’t gone easy on him. Because she knew how strong he was, and she wanted to make a show of strength. However, she hadn’t expected him to actually be able to defend himself against her attack!

Yang Ye’s strength had truly exceeded her expectations.

After all, the gap between her and Yang Ye wasn’t small at all!

Yun Bi’s strength had exceeded Yang Ye’s expectations as well. When she launched that attack, he knew that he wouldn’t be able to stop it without relying on his Invincible Sword Domain.

There was still a gap between them!

A short moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Ye gazed at Yun Bi, “Senior, my body had grown stronger, so I should be able to help your race now, right?”

She shot a glance at the sky, “There’s a huge barrier around this world, and it has imprisoned us for countless years… Now, it’s time for it to vanish.”

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, is your strength not enough to destroy that barrier?”

“I can!” She looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “I can destroy it, but I’ll become extremely weak once I’m done. I’m sure you understand what the consequence of that is!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand.”

He flipped his palm, and the golden sword appeared in his grasp, “Shall I destroy it now?”

She shook her head slightly, “Not now. My race isn’t prepared. We’ll face a huge amount of trouble once you destroy the barrier.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “Give me two weeks, alright?”

“Two weeks!” Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Senior, I have countless enemies. Perhaps I wouldn’t even be alive by then. So, are you sure you want to wait until then?”

She chuckled, “Besides those old bastards, no one else in this world can kill you.”

Yang Ye smiled and said, “Since you’ve made your decision, I won’t say anything. I’ll return in two weeks. Farewell!”

Yang Ye didn’t stay a moment longer, and he vanished into the sky.

Once Yang Ye left, Yun Bi’s face gradually fell. A long time passed before she shook her head, “The human race… is really blessed!”

…

Yang Ye didn’t stay in the 11th level.

Outside Heaven Pillar Mountain.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and left.

Yang Ye shot swiftly through the boundless starry sky.

His target was the Elegant Exalt, of course. He’d naturally not forgotten her. She had to die. Otherwise, she would hide in the shadows like a venomous snake and wait for an opportune moment to give him a lethal strike!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive on that star which the Elegant Exalt lived on.

As soon as he descended to the ground, Yang Ye immediately frowned.

Because a huge barrier of light had suddenly appeared in the sky above him, and countless rays of light were flickering through the barrier. At the same time, Yang Ye sensed no less than 10 mysterious auras lock onto him.

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “Yang Ye! I’ve been waiting for you!”
