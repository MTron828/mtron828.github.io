Chapter 1627 - The Martial Dao!

Translator: InVader

Yang Ye was naturally unable to leave because four old men at the Zenith Realm had surrounded him.

Yang Ye smiled with embarrassment, “What do you want?!”

“Come with us!” Meanwhile, the man in a luxurious robe suddenly walked over, “You will, right?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Of course!”

Kill his way out of this place?

He would attempt that if he was an idiot. He was in Martial Origin System. So long as he dared to kill one of them, a huge group of Zenith Realm and Rebirth Realm experts would definitely appear before him. Most importantly, he sensed that they didn’t have the desire to kill him.

Otherwise, he would die no matter what!

“Let’s go!” The man turned around and intended to leave once he finished speaking.

However, a ray of white light suddenly flashed from Yang Ye’s chest, and then a woman appeared.

Yang Ye was stunned when he saw her because it was An Nanjing.

Yang Ye asked, “What are you doing out here?”

She gazed at the stone tablet, “It!”

Yang Ye followed her gaze and saw the 3m tall black stone table that was floating not too far away from them. There was only a single character on it.

‘武!’

Martial? Yang Ye frowned slightly. He was about to speak when An Nanjing suddenly walked over to the stone tablet.

The man in a luxurious robe was about to do something when he saw this, but one of the old men by his side stopped him. The old man turned to look at An Nanjing while a wisp of surprise flashed through his eyes. It didn’t take long for him to seem to have noticed something, and the surprise in his eyes had transformed into excitement, “Notify the Grand Elder.”

One of the old men behind him nodded and vanished on the spot.

The man in a luxurious robe was slightly stunned. He glanced at An Nanjing while a trace of bewilderment appeared in his eyes.

Suddenly, an old man in a linen robe appeared here. The man in a luxurious robe quickly bowed respectfully, “Grand Elder.”

The old man in a linen robe nodded slightly, and then he gazed at An Nanjing. A wisp of surprise appeared in his eyes when he laid eyes on her, but it didn’t take long for the surprise to transform into shock, and then the shock in his eyes transformed into a solemn gaze.

An Nanjing ignored everyone and just walked over to the stone tablet, and then she just stared at it without blinking.

15 minutes passed.

Two hours passed.

Four hours passed.

An Nanjing was still staring at it.

Meanwhile, only Yang Ye, Lu Lige, and the members of the Wu Clan remained here. Everyone else had been forced to leave.

Lu Lige suddenly asked Yang Ye, “Who is she?”

Yang Ye glanced at An Nanjing and replied, “A loved one.”

Lu Lige nodded slightly, “She’s quite extraordinary.”

“Of course!” Yang Ye nodded. Actually, even he didn’t know how strong An Nanjing really was. Because he had never seen her fight with her life on the line. However, he knew that she was definitely not weak. Especially after she fully absorbed the Martial God’s inheritance.

Lu Lige asked, “How much longer is she going to just stand there?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t know. Why?”

Lu Lige was about to say something when An Nanjing’s figure suddenly moved. She flipped her palm and Skysplit appeared in her grasp, and then she waved it lightly. In an instant, another character appeared on the stone tablet!

‘道!’

Now, there were two characters on the stone tablet ‘武道!’

The Martial Dao!

Everyone here was stunned and didn’t understand why she’d done that.

Crack!

Suddenly, a clear and resounding crack arose, and then the stone tablet cracked open. A ray of white light flashed out from within it, and then it dispersed to reveal an ethereal figure.

The ethereal figure seemed to be around the age of 30, yet his hair was snow white. He wore a luxurious robe and kept his hands behind his back, and his eyes were deep like the boundless starry sky. As he stood there, he made others feel like they were facing the universe, and it made them feel tiny like specks of dust!

The expressions of the Wu Clan’s members changed drastically when they saw the figure, and then all of them knelt down in unison, “Ancestor!”

Ancestor!

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he sized up the middle aged man. He’s the Martial Ancestor, Wu Mu?

Lu Lige’s eyes were opened wide as well, and they were filled with disbelief. Obviously, he hadn’t expected to meet that legendary figure from all those years ago. Even though it was just a strand of the Martial Ancestor’s soul or spirit, it was still that legendary figure!

Wu Mu didn’t even spare a glance at the members of the Wu Clan. His gaze immediately fell onto An Nanjing, and the latter met his gaze without showing any signs of fear.

Wu Mu gazed at An Nanjing for a long time, and then he nodded, “The descendants of my Wu Clan are inferior to you!”

The Grand Elder and the other members of the Wu Clan had quite unsightly expressions on their faces when they heard this, but they didn’t even dare to raise their heads.

In their hearts, Wu Mu was like a god to them.

Meanwhile, Wu Mu continued, “The Martial Dao. I presume you’ve understood the meaning behind the stone tablet I left behind.” He paused for a moment and continued, “From this moment onward, she’s my successor. All restricted areas, cultivation techniques, knowledge, and resources of the Wu Clan are open to her.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he flicked a thick book over to An Nanjing, “A collection of my cultivation experience in the past. It should be useful to you.” As soon as he finished speaking, his figure started to disperse. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

An Nanjing glanced at the book, and then she bowed slightly to the vanishing figure of Wu Mu, “Thank you!”

The Grand Elder and the others glanced at An Nanjing, and then their gazes stopped at the book in her grasp.

Yang Ye noticed that there was a trace of fervor in their eyes when they gazed at that book. Besides that, there was even a trace of greed!

The experiences of the Martial Ancestor during the time he cultivated!

It was a divine treasure to people like them who pursued the Martial Dao! It could be said that if news of its existence were to spread, then countless experts would come to fight for it!

Not to mention others, even the members of the Wu Clan who were standing here right now had such intentions.

An Nanjing glanced at the book, and then she gazed at the Grand Elder, “I won’t take what belongs to the Wu Clan. I’ll return it once I’ve finished reading through it.”

The members of the Wu Clan were stunned when they heard her, and then they felt overjoyed. As for the Grand Elder, he shook his head and said, “Young Miss, you’re our ancestor’s successor. Since our ancestor gave it to you, then it belongs to you.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “But I do have a request. I hope you’ll allow me to make a copy, alright?”

An Nanjing glanced at the book and nodded, “OK!”

The Grand Elder was visibly relieved, “Thank you!”

He paused for a moment and continued, “Young Miss, I’m sure you heard our ancestor. Our patriarch is in closed door cultivation right now, but I can guarantee that my Wu Clan will do everything as our ancestor just said. From this moment onward, my Wu Clan will stand behind you, and we’ll be your greatest support!”

An Nanjing was stunned. She thought for a moment, and then she gazed at Yang Ye. Obviously, she wanted to enter the Wu Clan and learn its techniques. After all, the civilization here was of a much higher level than Sky Sky Continent.

It was a fortuitous encounter for An Nanjing, so Yang Ye would naturally not oppose it. He immediately nodded to display his agreement.

An Nanjing turned to look at the Grand Elder once she gained Yang Ye’s approval, “Alright!”

Even though she hoped to learn the techniques of the Wu Clan, she wouldn’t hesitate to refuse if Yang Ye didn’t agree to it. Because Yang Ye was the most important to her.

The Grand Elder glanced at Yang Ye, and then he gazed at an old man behind him, “Lead her to the Training Hall. Remember that she possesses the highest level of authority.”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Err… Can I go with her?”

He wasn’t joking, and he really wanted to go. The techniques of the Wu Clan were definitely extremely formidable, and there were definitely some that were even stronger than his Heaven Obliteration and Sword of Rebirth.

Lu Lige quickly added, “I’d like to go too!”

The Grand Elder glanced at them, and then he gazed at An Nanjing, “Please follow him!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

An Nanjing glanced at Yang Ye and said, “I’ll go have a look. Tell me when you’re leaving.” As soon as she finished speaking, she left with the old man.

Once An Nanjing left, the Grand Elder glanced at Lu Lige, “Can you give us some privacy?”

Lu Lige was about to speak when the Grand Elder suddenly waved his right hand, and then Lu Lige vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye was stunned.

The Grand Elder gazed at Yang Ye, sized him up, and asked, “You’re from the Yang Clan?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The Grand Elder pondered deeply for a moment and continued, “To be honest, I have a bad impression of the Yang Clan’s members.”

Yang Ye glanced at the Grand Elder. He isn’t thinking about attacking me, right?

“But!” The Grand Elder continued, “My Wu Clan promised to allow it to be taken by the one destined for it. It’s a sword, a matchless divine sword. In the hands of a sword cultivator, it’s like adding wings to a tiger. However, if you take it, then you must shoulder some things. Are you willing to do that?”

Yang Ye spoke vigilantly, “What things?”

The Grand Elder fell silent for a long time before he asked, “Do you really want to know?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Of course!”

The Grand Elder looked him in the eye for a long time, and then said, “I refuse to tell you!”
