Chapter 672 – Mageforce Shield!

Ding Shaoyao heaved a sigh of relief when she saw Yang Ye. At the same time, a feeling of powerlessness arose in her heart. After all, numbers and strategy were useless before absolute strength. Just like this incident. If Yang Ye hadn’t arrived, then everyone from the southern territory would have probably been slaughtered!

“It’s you!” Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto Qin Bufan.

Qin Bufan said, “I wasn’t the one who killed your forces. Of course, I’m not afraid of you, I just don’t want to fight an unnecessary battle.” He would have been confident in his ability to kill Yang Ye if Yang Ye didn’t possess the Stone of Suppression, but Yang Ye did. So, he wasn’t confident in his ability to kill Yang Ye right now.

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze, and then he gazed at the black clothed man and said, “You were the one?”

A wisp of disdain arose on the corners of the black clothed man’s mouth when he noticed that Yang Ye was just an Exalt Realm profounder. He was just about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly spoke, “Your expression has told me the answer. So, you can pay with your life!”

Yang Ye’s intent sword swiftly left its sheath once he finished speaking, and a strand of violet sword energy instantly arrived before the black clothed man. The black clothed man was shocked by this as he hadn’t expected that this ant at the Exalt Realm would actually dare to attack just like that, and he’d never imagined that this sword qi would actually be so swift to the point he didn’t even have a chance to dodge. So, he had no choice but to cover his palms with profound energy and smash them against the violet sword energy!

Yang Ye said in his heart when he saw this scene, Idiot!

His sword energy contained 6 overlapped Heavenrends and the 1st stage of Critical Strike. Such an attack was capable of killing ordinary Monarch Realm experts with ease, yet this defiant profound actually utilized his hands to resist it. So, he was clearly courting death!

The black clothed man’s pupils constricted when the violet sword energy was just a few centimeters away from his palm, and he revealed astonishment in his eyes. He wanted to pull his hands away, but it was too late.

Hiss!

The violet sword energy sliced through the black clothed man’s palms without suffering any obstruction at all, and then it continued towards his chest.

Bang!

He was blasted over 1km away before crashing to the ground, and his figure smashed open a huge crater there.

All the profounders of the southern territory were dumbstruck!

They’d personally witnessed the strength of that black clothed man, and even Monarch Realm experts couldn’t resist him! However, his hands were severed with a single swing of Yang Ye’s sword....

Is Yang Ye really at the Exalt Realm?

Ding Shaoyao truly heaved a sigh of relief when she witnessed this scene. She had no doubt that Yang Ye had become stronger. At the same time, she was extremely shocked because while Yang Ye hadn’t attained the Monarch Realm, he was growing stronger and stronger, and he wasn’t inferior to a Monarch Realm expert at all! How did he do that? How strong would he be if he attains the Monarch Realm?

“You’re even stronger than before!” Meanwhile, Qin Bufan spoke abruptly in a low voice.

Yang Ye didn’t answer Qin Bufan. He suddenly stomped his right foot on the ground, and he relied on the counterforce to shoot forward like a cannonball. Not even half a breath of time passed before Yang Ye arrived where the black clothed man fell, and then an enormous black fist blasted out from within the crater.

Yang Ye’s brows knit together a little while his intent sword swept forward, and an explosion resounded as it slashed the fist into half.

Meanwhile, the black clothed man had flown out from the crater. At this moment, there was a deep gash on his chest, and even the internal organs within him were clearly visible. He had a savage expression on his face because he hadn’t expected that he would be injured by an ant at the Exalt Realm. That was undoubtedly a huge insult to an extraordinary expert from 100,000 years ago like him!

Yang Ye’s brows were slightly knit together because he noticed that while the black clothed man’s hands were severed and there was a huge gash on his chest, the black clothed man didn’t seem to be affected by it at all!

Can there defiant profounders really not be killed? Are they really so heaven defying?

“You’ve succeeded at infuriating me....” The black clothed man had just started speaking when Yang Ye attacked again. He sheathed his sword, drew it, and a beam of sword energy instantly arrived before the black clothed man!

The black clothed man was slightly stunned. Just like before, he hadn’t expected that Yang Ye would actually attack without saying a single world, and he was caught off guard again. Fortunately, his reaction wasn’t slow, and he immediately placed an enormous black shield in front of him.

Bang!

The shield shook violently as the black clothed man moved over 30m back, and then Yang Ye watched with astonishment as his sword energy transformed into specks of blue energy that entered the shield!

“Eh? It’s actually the Mageforce Shield!” Right at this moment, Qin Bufan exclaimed and said, “Tsk, tsk. It’s a shield that’s even able to absorb the attacks of Half-Saints. It was definitely useless to me all those years ago. But heh.... In this world without Saints, a defensive Dao Artifact capable of absorbing the attacks of Half-Saints. Heh.... Give it to me and I’ll save your life today, alright?”

“You’re courting death!” The black clothed man paid no attention to Qin Bufan. He roared furiously as he suddenly kicked the shield with his right leg.

Bang!

The shield transformed into a ray of black light that smashed towards Yang Ye!

Yang Ye drew his sword and stabbed, and the tip of his sword struck the Mageforce Shield.

Clang!

The intent sword and the shield shook violently while Yang Ye took 2 steps back, and his arm felt quite numb. Yang Ye was surprised by this because his current physical body wasn’t inferior to a ninth rank Monarch Realm expert, but he hadn’t imagined that the black clothed man’s strength would actually be that great.

Bang!

The black clothed man suddenly appeared behind the shield, and then he kicked it. The enormous force of his kick pushed Yang Ye back repeatedly. He moved another 10m back before he suddenly stomped his right foot on the ground, and then he suddenly twisted his right hand, causing a formidable force to blast the black clothed man flying!

A wisp of burning desire flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes as he gazed at the enormous black shield. After all, it was a defense Dao Artifact that was even capable of absorbing the attacks of Half-Saints, it would undoubtedly become another trump card against Half-Saints for him if he could obtain it. So, Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to stretch his hand forward and grab it!

Bang!

Suddenly, a beam of blue light erupted from the shield and blasted against Yang Ye’s hand. His expression changed a little as he took a few steps back repeatedly, and he only stopped after moving over 100m back. Meanwhile, the skin on his right palm had actually been scorched slightly black, and his entire arm even felt numb!

A trace of surprise flashed through his eyes as he gazed at his palm. That shield is actually so strong?

“That shield isn’t something for this world of yours. It was forged from stellar metals that are found in outer space, and even Half-Saints would find it difficult to destroy. Moreover, it can absorb most of the attacks it receives and store the energy contained within those attacks. The more energy it absorbs, the stronger it’ll become. It isn’t a threat to Saint Realm experts, but it’s capable of being endlessly troublesome for Half-Saints!” Qin Bufan spoke abruptly.

“That’s an awesome treasure!” Yang Ye’s smile grew wider.

“Unfortunately, you won’t be able to obtain it unless he gives it to you willingly!” said Qin Bufan.

“Why?” Yang Ye was puzzled.

Qin Bufan explained, “Because he has placed his Spiritual Brand within it, and he’s immortal to a certain extent. At the very least, you’re definitely incapable of killing him. Since you can’t, then you can’t eliminate the Spiritual Brand within it, and you won’t be able to take control of the Mageforce Shield without accomplishing that. Understand?” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“That’s why you aren’t seizing it from him, right?” Yang Ye glanced at Qin Bufan, and then he walked over to the black clothed man while holding an intent sword in his grasp.

“Smart!” Qin Bufan said, “Let me remind you that you can’t kill him!”

Yang Ye replied, “I still want to give it a try!”

Qin Bufan shrugged and said, “Then go ahead and try!”

“You’re courting death!” Meanwhile, the black clothed man suddenly roared furiously. His face was completely ferocious while an imposing aura surged madly out of him like a storm. The space around him started to tremble violently while a glowing circle of energy suddenly swept out from within the shield. The circle of energy grew larger and larger while its speed increased progressively. Merely an instant passed before it arrived in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed while a cold glow flashed through them. He swiftly drew his intent sword, and a ray of violet sword energy swept forward.

Surprise flashed through Qin Bufan’s eyes when he saw this attack because the energy contained within it was more than 3 times stronger than before!

Bang!

The sword energy and blue light collided, and then a moment of silence ensued. In the next moment, the blue light seemed like snow that fell into boiling oil and was instantly dispersed by the sword energy before the sword energy smashed against the Mageforce Shield. However, the sword energy instantly transformed into specks of blue light that were completely absorbed into the shield!

“Haha!!” The black clothed man roared madly with laughter and said, “Even a Half-Saint can’t damage my Mageforce Shield, so how could an ant at the Exalt Realm like you possibly accomplish it?”

When he spoke up to this point, a ferocious expression suddenly covered his face, and he said, “I have to say that you’ve really succeeded at infuriating me, and I’ll make living worse than death for you!”

“Where’d you get the confidence to say that?” Yang Ye laughed coldly as his figure suddenly vanished on the spot, and he was already behind the black clothed man when his figure appeared again. This time, the black clothed man was prepared, and the Mageforce Shield immediately moved behind him when Yang Ye appeared there.

At this moment, the intent sword in Yang Ye’s grasp had been replaced by the Sword Ruler. At the same time, Yang Ye’s entire arm had been draconified, and he held the Sword Ruler with his dragon claw as he swiftly smashed it against the Mageforce Shield. A string of sparks sprayed towards the surroundings while the shield and black clothed man were both blasted flying, and they flew for always 300m before they finally stopped moving!

“Looks like that shield of yours can only absorb attacks executed with profound energy, and it can’t absorb physical strength!” As soon as he finished speaking these words, Yang Ye’s figure had arrived before the black clothed man, and then he swiftly stomped his foot against the man’s head.

A shrill cry resounded from between the black clothed man’s lips while his entire body transformed into a black ray of light that was blasted almost 3km back!

Yang Ye stretched out his hand and grabbed the Mageforce Shield. The shield shook violently and almost shook itself free from Yang Ye’s grasp. Fortunately, Yang Ye hurriedly used his other hand to grab it as well.

“You can’t take control of it!” said Qin Bufan from the side.

“Is that so?” Yang Ye laughed coldly, and then he tossed it into the Primordial Pagoda....
