Chapter 90 – You’re Not A Disciple Of The Sword Sect!

Besides those four beautiful women, there was also an old man with snow white hair in the hall that was standing at the seat of the host. Moreover, four middle aged men and a woman were standing on the old man’s right. Yang Ye didn’t know the four middle aged men and the old man, but he knew that woman. Because it was Su Qingshi.

When Yang Ye walked into the hall, the gazes of everyone descended onto him. In the beginning, Yang Ye was bewildered about why that Sword Commanding Elder would want to see him, but when he saw Feng Yi now, he’d instantly came to an understanding.

They’d come with ill intent!

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and he walked forward to bow to the old man in the lead. He said, “Outer Court Disciple, Yang Ye, greets the Sword Commanding Elder!”

The white haired old man nodded slightly, and then he looked at Feng Yi’s group and said, “All of you’ve come from afar, so I presume you’re slightly tired. Qingshi, take these four distinguished guests to have a rest!”

Su Qingshi’s beautiful brows knit together slightly. She glanced at Yang Ye, and then hesitate for a moment before she walked over to Feng Yi and said, “Please follow me!”

When she noticed that the old man refused to allow them to stay here, one of the beautiful women behind Feng Yi was slightly displeased. She was just about to speak when Feng Yi shook her head towards that woman and said, “We’ll be troubling you then!”

Su Qingshi nodded lightly, and then she turned around and led them out of the hall. However, a wisp of worry flashed in her eyes when she passed by Yang Ye and took a glance at him.

Feng Yi glanced at Yang Ye as well. However, her eyes didn’t carry any worry, and there was only ridicule.

Yang Ye’s heart sank when he noticed this. Right at this moment, the old man who was in the lead looked at Yang Ye and asked. “Your mother is a disciple of the Flower Palace?”

Yang Ye suppressed the uneasiness in his heart, and then he cupped his fists and said, “Yes!”

“The Flower Palace wants the Sword Sect to hand you and your sister over to them. What do you think about this?” The old man went straight to the point.

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he smiled with self-ridicule and said, “Sword Commanding Elder, since you’ve already made your decision, then is my opinion important?”

The old man went silent when he heard Yang Ye’s words that carried slight resentment. If it was up to him alone, he wasn’t willing to hand a disciple of the Sword Sect over to another because this would cause all the disciples of the Sword Sect to feel disappointed. However, he had no choice this time. Because the Flower Palace’s strength was much stronger than the Sword Sect, and the Flower Palace had a very good reason this time!

However, if he did hand Yang Ye over, it would definitely disappoint numerous disciples of the Sword Sect!

Meanwhile, a hawk nosed middle aged man on the old man’s right said, “Senior Brother Yu Lin, our Sword Sect is already like fire and water with the Ghost Sect now, so it’s truly inadvisable for us to form enmity with the Flower Palace. Moreover, the Flower Palace has such a good reason. If we don’t hand them over, then not only will enmity arise between our Sword Sect and the Flower Palace, it will leave a bad impression to others. This is truly unwise!”

After he finished speaking, the middle aged man turned around to look at Yang Ye, and he said, “Kid, we’re both strangers to each other, and I wasn’t trying to go against you by saying all of that. I just said that for the Sword Sect’s sake. If you’re able to survive and want to take revenge in the future, then you can come looking for me. I’m called Chi Huo!”

Yang Ye nodded, and he spoke in a neither humble nor arrogant manner. “I’ll commit your name to memory. If I’m able to survive, then I’ll definitely look for Senior Chi Huo and ask for an explanation!”

When they heard this, the four middle aged men and Yu Lin glanced at Yang Ye with surprise. We really underestimated this young man just now!Chi Huo glanced at Yang Ye with admiration and said, “Kid, your courage and bearing are really not bad. If it wasn’t for the sake of the Sword Sect, I wouldn’t want to send you off to your death!”

Yang Ye asked abruptly. “Senior, allow me to make a bold move and ask you, what was the meaning behind the Founding Ancestors’ establishment of the Sword Sect all those years ago?”

Chi Huo frowned and said, “What’re you trying to say?”

Yang Ye said slowly, “Why do so many people want to join a sect? Because not only would one obtain plenty of cultivation resources upon joining a sect, it represented a form of honor as well. It represented that one wouldn’t be bullied by others in the future. To make a simple example, if I headed to the mortal world and those clans of the mortal world found out that I’m a disciple of the Sword Sect, then even if I’m merely an outer court disciple, they would still treat me with respect.

“Since the Founding Ancestor was matchless in the world and no one in the world could bully him at that time, then why did he still establish the Sword Sect? I think that besides passing down his inheritance, it was also because he wanted his disciples to become united. Because only by being united would they be able to avoid being bullied by others once he was gone.

“In short, it’s unity. A sect can only avoid being bullied by being united. My life isn’t precious at all, and it doesn’t matter if I die. However, if Seniors hand me and my younger sister over, then what would the disciples of the Sword Sect think? What would the people in the outside world think?

“Seniors, do all of you think anyone will join a sect that can’t protect its own disciples? Would anyone see it as an honor to become a disciple of the Sword Sect? Would anyone work hard and fight for this honor anymore?” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye took a deep breath.

He didn’t want to die, and he didn’t want his sister to die even more. He wanted to rescue his mother, so he had to strive to obtain a chance to survive. If he strived for and obtained this chance, then he would have an opportunity; if he didn’t strive for it, then he wouldn’t have the slightest opportunity.

Everyone within the hall went silent. Yang Ye had spoken a great deal, but only a single sentence had moved then, and that was the sentence where he said that no one would join a sect that couldn’t protect its own disciples. All of them had no choice but to admit that these words really made sense.

However, if they didn’t hand Yang Ye over, then how would they give the Flower Palace an explanation? After all, they were in the wrong in this matter. If they didn’t hand Yang Ye over, then it could be said to be similar to slapping the Flower Palace on the face. At this moment, it was truly unsuitable for the Sword Sect to form enmity with the Flower Palace, or it should be said as it wasn’t worth for the Sword Sect to form enmity with the Flower Palace for an outer court disciple.

When they thought up to here, Chi Huo and the other three middle aged men by his side looked at Yu Lin.

Yu Lin nodded slightly, and then he looked at Yang Ye and said, “Yang Ye, your words do make sense. The reason my Sword Sect possesses its current status is exactly because of unity. So, my Sword Sect won’t abandon its own disciples!”

Right when Yang Ye was delighted, Yu Lin said, “However, Yang Ye, you’re not a disciple of my Sword Sect!”

The smile on Yang Ye’s face froze, and he said, “Sword Commanding Elder, could it be that you intend to expel me from the Sword Sect before handing me over to the Flower Palace?”

Yu Lin shook his head and said, “If I really did that, then would it be any different from directly handing you over to the Flower Palace? What I mean is, you’re not a disciple of my Sword Sect at all.”

Yang Ye said in a low voice, “I’ve already passed the Outer Court Exam!”

Yu Lin said, “Do you have the token of an Outer Court Disciple of my Sword Sect?”

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted when he heard this. When he heard the old, he suddenly recalled that he hadn’t participated in the competition between the new outer court disciples because of the incident at his home, thus he’d missed the moment when the elders of the Sword Sect distributed the uniform and token of the outer court disciples. Moreover, he’d forgotten about this matter after he returned to the Sword Sect. So, in other words, he really wasn’t a disciple of the Sword Sect!

After a long time, Yang Ye shook his head and started laughing. He glanced at all of them and said, “So, it turns out that seniors had really made your decisions a long time ago. How laughable that I thought there would be a chance to turn the situation around. How laughable!”

Yu Lin sighed. Actually, he didn’t want to make such a decision. But he had no choice to act in this way for the sake of the Sword Sect. The Sword Sect was unlike how it was in the past. Even though it was still one of the six extraordinary powers, no matter if it was in terms of its experts at the top or the disciples at the bottom, all of them couldn’t compare to the Flower Palace.

Moreover, the Ghost Sect was hostile like fire and water with the Sword Sect. So, if the Flower Palace suddenly moved from a neutral position to standing on the Ghost Sect’s side, then it would undoubtedly be a calamity for the Sword Sect.

As for what Yang Ye said about causing the other outer court disciples to be disappointed, such a situation wouldn’t appear because Yang Ye and his younger sister would vanish soundlessly!

“Sword Commanding Elder, can you only hand me over and let my younger sister go?” Yang Ye raised his head to look at Yu Lin before he asked this question.

Yu Lin shook his head and said, “The Flower Palace wants both of you!”

When he heard this, Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he slowly closed his eyes. In the next moment, Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes, and then an invisible imposing aura suddenly erupted. When this imposing aura appeared, the sword in Yang Ye’s hand suddenly let out a sword howl.

Yang Ye’s gaze swept slowly past the four middle aged men before finally descending onto Yu Lin, and he said, “From this moment onwards, I, Yang Ye, am a disciple of the Sword Sect no more!”

When he heard Yu Lin wasn’t willing to let his younger sister go, Yang Ye had truly given up on the Sword Sect.

When the five of them noticed the imposing aura that erupted from Yang Ye’s body, their expressions changed violently, and their faces were covered in shock and disbelief.

Yu Lin seemed to have lost his soul, and he muttered in a low voice. “How could this be possible? How could this be possible? It’s actually Sword Intent….”

“Haha!! Good! It’s best not to join a sect like the Sword Sect! Haha!!” Right at this moment, an old man roared with laughter as he walked into the hall, and there was a little girl following by the old man’s side. This little girl was none other than Bao’er!
