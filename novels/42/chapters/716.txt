Inferno Mountain Range.

The Sword Spirit gazed at Yang Ye as she asked in a low voice, “Are you sure you want to give it a try?”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “A Half-Saint Sword Servant will be extremely useful to me. I have to try no matter what.”

She cautioned, “Be careful. Give up if it’s really impossible. Otherwise, it’ll cause a huge amount of damage to your soul and mind.”

“Don’t worry, I’ll give up if it’s impossible!” Yang Ye walked over to the corpse of that Half-Saint, and then his soul and Spiritual Energy transformed into rays of green light that shot into the center of the corpse’s brows. As soon as they entered, an extremely powerful energy of the soul and Spiritual Energy surged out from within the corpse and moved along the energy of Yang Ye’s soul to enter through the center of Yang Ye’s brows.

Yang Ye’s face instantly turned ghastly pale while he was visibly in pain.

Even though that Half-Saint was dead, the energy of his soul and Spiritual Energy hadn’t dispersed because the Sword Spirit had preserved them, and it was only much weaker than it used to be and its will had been eliminated. Even then, it wasn’t something that an ordinary Monarch Realm expert could suppress. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

If Yang Ye was an ordinary Monarch Realm expert, then just this short period of time would have been sufficient to damage his soul and cause him to lose his mind!

Regardless of whether it was the strength of his soul, mind, or will, all of them far surpassed an ordinary Monarch Realm expert because of the Sword Intent he possessed. That was why he could endure the impact of the Half-Saints Soul Energy and Spiritual Energy.

In order to truly convert the corpse into a Sword Servant, he had to use his Soul Energy and Spiritual Energy to form a soul and spiritual brand within the corpse. Of course, it wasn’t that simple. Because regardless of whether it was a Half-Saint or an ordinary profounder, their Soul Energy and Spiritual Energy would resist instinctively.

It was a process, a painful process. Especially because he was facing a Half-Saint!

Time passed gradually just like that, and Yang Ye’s countenance grew more and more paler while beads of sweat started to cover his forehead. On the other hand, the corpse was trembling slightly.

Suddenly, the Sword Spirit’s expression changed. She waved her hand lightly, and then 3 rays of light appeared below Yang Ye, the corpse, and her own feet. After that, all 3 of them vanished on the spot.

Less than 3 breaths of time after they vanished, Qian Yan, Chi Huo, and Guardian Lin appeared where Yang Ye was just moments ago.

The white haired old man glanced at the surroundings, and he remained silent for a short while before he said, “Elder Yu’s aura, and the aura of someone who isn’t human remains here. Yang Ye might have help!”

He has help!?

Qian Yan asked, “Is it a Half-Saint?”

The white haired old man shook his head and said, “I don’t know. All I know is that he was able to kill Xiahou Xuan who was ranked at the 3rd position on the Hallowed Rankings, was able to make Xuan Ming’s group be helpless against him, and was able to launch a surprise attack and kill Elder Yu. He’s absolutely not an ordinary person. Besides that, we have to be especially careful against his ability to conceal his aura. Send out your Spiritual Energy and form a profound energy barrier around yourselves as well. Don’t let him turn the tables again!”

Qian Yan and Chi Huo nodded. Even though Yang Ye was only at the Monarch Realm, they didn’t dare underestimate him in the slightest!

“Split up and search for him. Don’t attack once you locate him and wait for us to converge on your location. We must strive to kill him with a single strike and give him no chance to survive. Besides that, both of you must be careful. Remember what I said!” The white haired old man’s figure shook slightly before he vanished on the spot.

Qian Yan and Chi Huo’s figures shook and vanished on the spot as well.

Within one of the volcanoes. The Sword Spirit brought Yang Ye and the corpse along with her and stopped on a huge rock. An expanse of surging lava resided a few kilometers below them, and surging waves of heart shot up from below. Fortunately, these waves of heat were blocked off by the Sword Spirit’s sword energy.

“Hmm?” Suddenly, the Sword Spirit exclaimed softly while she looked down towards the surging lava. The lava was surging like a wavy ocean, and it ceaselessly slapped against the pitch black rock walls in the surroundings. Moreover, some things could be faintly seen to be moving about beneath the lava.

“There are living beings beneath the lava!” The Sword Spirit’s beautiful brows knit together slightly.

Bang!

Suddenly, a huge explosion resounded, and then a flaming dragon that was over 1km long and completely formed from lava shot into the air.

It’s at the Monarch Realm!

Yang Ye opened his eyes but the Sword Spirit suddenly said, “Continue what you’re doing! Leave the rest to me!” As she spoke, she tapped her right foot lightly against the huge rock, and then she floated up like a leaf. She seemed indescribably nimble and graceful.

The Sword Spirit floated in midair as she gazed at the flaming dragon. She didn’t seem to have moved at all, yet a sword formed from energy appeared before her. She took the sword’s hilt in her fair hand, and then she spoke softly, “Mortal Sword!”

As soon as she spoke, the Sword Spirit vanished along with the sword, and they transformed into a ray of light that shot explosively towards the flaming dragon.

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted because he noticed that he was actually incapable of differentiating the Sword Spirit from the sword in her hand. To be precise, he felt like she was the sword, and the sword was her. She’d become one with her sword!

Sword Unification?

Yang Ye watched as the ray of light collided with the flaming dragon, and merely an instant passed before the ray of light shot into the flaming dragon before emerging from its tail.

The flaming dragon stopped on the spot, and a moment of silence ensued.

Bang!

It exploded on the spot and transformed into countless streams of lava that splashed towards the surroundings.

“How formidable!” Yang Ye withdrew his gaze yet the scene from before was still playing in his mind. The speed the Sword Spirit revealed just now wasn’t inferior to his Lightspeed Technique at all, and it might even be faster. Most importantly, its might wasn’t inferior to the 3rd stage of the Critical Strike technique!

Besides that, the Sword Spirit didn’t possess any Sword Intent or profound energy, and she was merely relying on speed and strength. However, it was exactly such an attack that possessed such terrifying might. How strong would it be if I executed that with Sword Intent, Critical Strike, and Lightspeed?

He had no doubt that it would absolutely far surpass the strength of 15 overlapped Heavenrends. Of course, it would be an entirely different outcome if he could overlap 20 or even more Heavenrends!

If he took his enemies by surprise, he could even kill a Half-Saint with a single strike!

I should talk with her once I’m done with this! Yang Ye discarded the distracting thoughts in his mind and started to concentrate on dealing with the Soul Energy and Spiritual Energy of the corpse.

The Sword Spirit stretched out her hand and waved it lightly. Just this casual wave of her hand caused numerous arm thick swords to densely cover the air before her, and less than 2 breaths of time passed before almost 20,000 swords had appeared! All of them shot over to the surface of the lava before swiftly forming a circular formation that covered the surface of the lava.

“Suppress!” She shouted lightly before pressing her hands downward.

Countless rays of light erupted from within the circular sword formation, and then howls of pain instantly resounded from within the lava. The enormous figures beneath the lava charged incessantly against the sword formation, causing it to rumble. Unfortunately, it remained solid as a rock, and it wasn’t long before those beings beneath the lava stopped attacking and started swimming towards the depths of the lava!

The Sword Spirit gazed at the lava for a short while before she flicked her finger, and then a thread of sword energy which was as thin as the hair of an ox shot into the lava. Around 15 minutes passed just like that, and then she frowned slightly because it still hadn’t reached the bottom.

Another half an hour passed, and then her expression changed slightly because it was destroyed by a mysterious force!

“What’s wrong?” Yang Ye’s voice suddenly resounded.

She turned around and looked over, and she saw an old man standing by Yang Ye’s side. It was exactly the old man at the Half-Saint Realm from before.

She asked, “You succeeded?”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “I would definitely die if I hadn’t attained the Monarch Realm. But once I attained the Monarch Realm, I’m capable of resisting the Soul Energy and Spiritual Energy of Half-Saints. Of course, it was mainly because his soul and spirit both had their will eliminated. So their resistance was only instinctive, and thus it wasn’t too difficult for me.”

“That was because he wasn’t very strong!” She continued, “If it were your master, Elder Mu, or Lu Yan, then you would have instantly lost your mind upon coming into contact with their Soul Energy and Spiritual Energy.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly and didn’t continue lingering on this topic. He gazed at the lava and said, “You had a solemn expression on your face just now. Is there something terrifying beneath the lava?”

She replied, “There are at least over a thousand Monarch Realm beings down there, and it’s very likely for Half-Saint Realm beings to present there as well.”

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly, “How could that be possible? Over 1,000 Monarch Realm experts, and even Half-Saints.... How could the Fire Spirit Race fear the Hallowed Halls if they possessed such terrifying strength?”

She said, “I don’t know. But think about it. They would have probably been annihilated countless times in the past if they only possessed the strength you’ve seen on the surface. Moreover, Xuan Ming’s group from the Hallowed Halls didn’t dare to trespass into their territory as well. I presume that the Fire Spirit Race probably has some sort of trump card. That trump card might be something else, or it might be this mountain range of volcanoes.”

Yang Ye’s heart sank slightly. There were over 10,000 volcanoes throughout the mountain range. If every single volcano had that many experts living beneath the lava, then the Fire Spirit Race would be truly terrifying!

“We much look for my main body as soon as possible!” She suddenly said, “I can sense that it’s already on the verge of being unable to suppress the defiant profounders. Once they charge out of the seal, they might try to destroy my main body as soon as possible because it’s a huge threat to them.”

“We’ll leave once Qian Yan is dead!” said Yang Ye.

“Someone is coming!” She suddenly raised her head and looked up, “It’s a Half-Saint. He’ll be here in 10 breaths of time at most!”

Yang Ye glanced at his new Half-Saint Sword Servant, and then a wisp of ferocity appeared in his eyes!

“Just at the right time....”
