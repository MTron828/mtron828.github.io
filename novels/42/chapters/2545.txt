Chapter 2546

Suddenly, the woman in a black dress attacked.

She soundlessly appeared before Nether Maiden, and then the space around Nether Maiden started rippling strangely. After that, strands of mysterious energy rippled out from the space there!

Nether Maiden had nowhere to go!

She didn’t try to go anywhere. She just stretched out her right hand and twisted it lightly.

Crack!

The space around her instantly collapsed, and the mysterious energy collapsed with it!

However, that was just the beginning!

A strand of powerful mysterious energy suddenly enveloped Nether Maiden!

A Domain!

The woman’s Space Domain!

At the instant the Space Domain appeared, the woman pressed her palms together, and then the shattered space around Nether Maiden actually strangely started to condense!

People couldn’t see space, but they could sense it!

Nether Maiden sensed a powerful wave of pressure!

It wasn’t just the spatial energy of this world, it was the spatial energy of another type of space!

Nether Maiden frowned slightly and pressed her right palm down slightly. The space in the surroundings shook, and then a powerful energy of reversal appeared.

Spatial Reversal!

Nether Maiden was using her heaven defying abilities to reverse the space here, she was trying to return it to its original state!

The space here wasn’t normal anymore under the effects of the woman in a black dress.

Once her powerful energy of reversal surged through it, the space around Nether Maiden gradually started to recover, and the sight of this made the woman in a black dress frown.

Her Domain was actually being reversed?

The woman in a black dress suddenly pushed her palms lightly toward the side!

Bang!

The space here exploded apart and a powerful wave of energy exploded out like a torrent, causing Nether Maiden to be pushed almost 300m back!

As soon as Nether Maiden stopped herself, the woman appeared in front of Nether Maiden, and her palm slapped down at Nether Maiden’s chest.

The woman in a black dress was able to accomplish this because she wasn’t in the same space as Nether Maiden.

They were in two different spaces!

At the moment her right palm slapped Nether Maiden’s chest, a wave of powerful yet strange energy slammed against Nether Maiden. However, it was the woman in a black dress whose expression had changed. It was because she noticed to her shock that her vitality was vanishing rapidly, and Death Energy had appeared within her!

Bang!

They separated a moment after clashing against each other!

They stood around 100m away from each other. At this moment, the woman in a black dress’ beautiful face had wrinkles on it. Moreover, her black hair had some strands of white hair in it! Moreover, the white hair was spreading!

The woman in a black dress was astounded. She closed her eyes slowly, and then her body turned ethereal!

This time, Nether Maiden frowned because she couldn’t sense the woman’s aura at all!

Nether Maiden could see the woman but couldn’t sense her!

Since she couldn’t sense the woman, she was naturally incapable of reversing the woman’s vitality!

Both of them were extremely unusual!

They gazed at each other, and their eyes were filled with fear.

Nether Maiden didn’t dare to act carelessly. The woman before her possessed a Space Domain, and her spatial techniques were extremely mysterious. The slightest mistake may lead to her death!

As for the woman in a black dress, she didn’t dare to be careless as well. If she hadn’t reacted quickly just now, she would have probably died just now!

However, this stalemate didn’t last for long, and it didn’t take long for them to charge at each other.

This time, they didn’t use their unusual abilities. Because they noticed that if they did that, they wouldn’t be able to fight each other!

Nether Maiden feared the woman’s Space Domain, and the woman feared Nether Maiden’s ability to reverse things. If Nether Maiden used her ability, the woman in a black dress would have no choice but to flee into space… So, no one would be able to fight if they used their respective abilities!

Thus, they chose to fight in melee combat!

Melee combat!

Meanwhile, the sword cultivators of the Ancient Sword Sect and the experts of the Soul Sect were in battle.

The pig-riding woman had selected a Lord Realm expert!

Three strikes!

With just three strikes, she’d blasted that Lord Realm expert out of the Ancient Sword Sect!

Every single swing of her saber carried absolutely destructive and powerful force, and it was simply comparable to the Primal True Dragon’s strength! Moreover, since she was a saber cultivator, the might of her attack seemed simply capable of slashing the sky in half!

As for the elite disciples of the sect, now that they had Divine Treasures, they were entirely capable of fighting Lord Realm experts!

The facts proved that Yang Ye’s decision was correct. Because if they didn’t have those divine treasures, they would be utterly incapable of fighting Lord Realm experts!

But now that they did have those divine treasures, those elite disciples’ combat strength had risen tremendously!

Sword Scroll didn’t join the battle. She just stood before the hall and watched coldly!

People were dying every moment!

There was a piece of soul wood in her grasp!

Meanwhile, the Soul Sect gradually gained an advantage over the Ancient Sword Sect!

In the beginning, the Soul Sect felt that after the Grand Elder and the other experts of the Ancient Sword Sect had left, only Yang Ye, Gu Nan, and a few others were strong enough to fight them. Moreover, once they kept Yang Ye busy, there wasn’t anyone especially strong left in the Ancient Sword Sect.

But they hadn’t expected Yang Ye to use all the resources available to the Ancient Sword Sect, allowing those disciples’ combat strengths to rise tremendously. But the most unexpected thing to them was Nether Maiden and the pig-riding woman’s presence!

Nether Maiden was keeping the woman in a black dress busy, and the pig-riding woman was entirely capable of fighting against two on her own!

At a point in space outside the sect, a black robed figure gazed coldly in the Ancient Sword Sect’s direction.

It was the Soul Sect’s Soul Exalt!

The Soul Exalt chuckled, “How stubborn.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand, and then a few dozen black robed men appeared here.

The Soul Exalt spoke indifferently, “I didn’t want all of you to show yourselves, but it seems like I must make all of you put on a display of our strength!”

“Understood!” They bowed slightly to him and charged at the Ancient Sword Sect.

The Soul Exalt closed his eyes slowly, “Show yourself!”

As soon as he said that, a woman in a red dress appeared behind him.

The Soul Exalt shook his head and smiled, “I didn’t expect Yang Ye to have so much help! You’ve been following me because you don’t want me to join the fight, right?”

The woman remained silent, but an ocean of blood appeared in the surroundings!

A Domain!

A Blood Domain!

It was no Pseudo Domain, it was a real Domain!

A wisp of solemness appeared in the Sect Exalt’s eyes when he sensed this.

…

At the void in the sky above the Ancient Sword Sect.

Yang Ye and the Guardian of the Soul Sect were standing in confrontation from afar!

But countless flying swords were flashing around them!

Sword cultivators!

The Guardian was a sword cultivator, and a powerful one too!

The Guardian’s sword intent was at the peak of the Lord Realm, and that was much stronger than Yang Ye’s sword intent!

Moreover, the Guardian’s attacks were very strange and special. It was because the Guardian’s sword wasn’t being powered by physical energy, it was powered by the energy of the soul!

The Sword Soul, or it should be called soul swords!

Yang Ye had come into contact with Sword Soul Techniques too, but what he’d learned all those years ago couldn’t compare to this at all!

The Guardian before him was using a true Sword Soul Technique!

Bang!

Along with two rays of light slamming against each other, the entire void shook, and then countless fragments of energy shot toward the surroundings!

Yang Ye took a step forward, and then his Sword Domain enveloped the area!

Obviously, he didn’t intend to waste more time!

Meanwhile, the Guardian suddenly said, “The Sword Domain? Come on! Let me test it for myself!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his soul suddenly left his body!

A sharp and ear-piercing sword howl resounded!

The sword intent the Guardian emanated was even more terrifying than before!

Yang Ye gazed at the Guardian, and then he suddenly vanished on the spot. At the same time, a ray of sword energy tore through the air!

Everywhere it passed, the space here started to collapse, inch by inch!

Meanwhile, the Guardian suddenly closed his eyes slowly, and then his sword pierced into his forehead! Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Union of sword and soul!

Bang!

A dazzling ray of sword energy erupted like a scorching sun.

The space throughout this expanse of the void collapsed completely!

Around 10 breaths of time later, two figures appeared in the sky above the sect.

It was Yang Ye and the Guardian!

They stood facing each other with around 30m between them.

The Guardian’s body was gone, and only his soul remained, but it was translucent!

As for Yang Ye, there was an obvious trace of scarlet red on the corner of his mouth!

The Guardian stared at Yang Ye and said, “The young are truly extraordinary! Come, try an attack of mine!”

As soon as he said that, a sword soundlessly shot out from his forehead, and the sky above the entire Ancient Sword Sect was covered by black energy!

Sword energy!

But it was black in color!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, and a sword sheath appeared in his left grasp. Executor was within it!

Yang Ye drew it and swung it!

As soon as his sword descended, the black sword energy before him shattered into bits!

Suddenly, the Guardian appeared before Yang Ye and stabbed once more. It was swift as a bolt of lightning!

Yang Ye was about to counterattack when a black robed figure soundlessly appeared behind him, and this black robed figure was holding a sword too!

Two swords stabbed at Yang Ye!

Two Lord Realm experts!

Or to be more precise, it was two Guardians of the Soul Sect!

Yang Ye’s expression instantly changed. He hadn’t expected the sword behind him!

This surprise attack had truly taken him by surprise!

Right at this critical moment, an invisible barrier appeared behind Yang Ye, and it isolated Yang Ye from the sword behind him!

Yang Ye was stunned for a moment, and then he smiled.

A woman in a green dress was standing in the distant sky.
