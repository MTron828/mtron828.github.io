Chapter 2444 - A Man!

A single attack!

While the old man was at the Four World Realm, was he an ordinary Four World Realm expert?

He clearly wasn’t!

The old man’s strength couldn’t be judged as being at the Four World Realm!

As far as the old man was concerned, Yang Ye’s intent to defeat him with a single attack was a joke.

Ridicule gradually appeared on the corners of the old man’s mouth, and it was about to spread when the ridicule there froze.

It was because a pair of black wings had appeared behind Yang Ye!

Yang Ye didn’t give the old man any time to think, and a ray of light flashed.

Hiss!

Something seemed to be torn open here. At the same time, the old man’s figure curled forward and was blasted over 10km away!

A'Leng and Huang Ying were stunned.

He’s that strong?

Needless to say, they were shocked by the strength Yang Ye displayed with this attack.

Both its strength and speed were many levels greater than it had been from any of Yang Ye’s previous attacks! It was also why even the old man hadn’t been able to avoid it and was struck by it.

But the old man was still alive!

While he wasn’t dead, there was a very deep injury from his forehead to stomach, it was extremely deep! It could be said that if the old man had been just a little slower, just a tiny bit, his body would have been lost.

Because that attack would have sliced him into two!

After all, Yang Ye’s sword was Executor! So, not to mention a Five World Realm expert, even an expert above the Five World Realm would bleed from being hit by it!

The old man wiped off the blood on his face and looked up at Yang Ye. At this moment, his face was indescribably ferocious!

A dignified Five World Realm expert like him had actually almost died to a single attack from an ant!

A humiliation!

An absolute humiliation!

The old man stared at Yang Ye, “Two Super Divine Treasures. I have to say, I’m really surprised. But your profound energy is probably exhausted, right?”

Yang Ye’s body was trembling incessantly as he held his sword with both hands, and he’d fallen into a mad state.

However, for some reason, he didn’t attack the old man.

The old man laughed with ridicule, and then he charged at Yang Ye.

Super Divine Treasures weren’t that easy to use. Yang Ye’s strength wasn’t enough to use them at all, let alone two of them. So, the old man was certain that Yang Ye wasn’t capable of executing another attack like that!

A’Leng and Huang Ying appeared before Yang Ye, and then they vanished on the spot.

Bang! Bang!

Two powerful auras shot at the old man.

The old man grunted coldly when he saw them charge at him, and then he pressed his hands down.

Bang! Bang!

Two explosions resounded, and then both of them were blasted away. But right at this moment, the old man’s pupils constricted because he saw another ray of sword energy!

It was exactly like the flash from before!

It was too fast, so fast that even the old man couldn’t avoid it.

Hiss!

The old man was blasted away again, and he flew over 30km away.

As soon as he descended to the ground, his palms exploded apart, and his body started to collapse inch by inch while blood sprayed into the surroundings!

The old man was shocked by this, and he couldn’t be bothered to hold back anymore.

Bang!

A powerful aura swept out from within him, and the space here instantly shook violently.

The Five World Realm!

At the critical moment, the old man didn’t dare to suppress himself anymore and returned to the Five World Realm. As soon as he did that, he forcefully suppressed the sword energy Yang Ye had left within him, and his practically collapsing body was preserved!

The Five World Realm!

Once his strength returned to the Five World Realm, he immediately glanced at Yang Ye’s group.

There was undisguised killing intent within his eyes!

Suddenly, an old man with a jade staff appeared before Yang Ye’s group.

Huang Ying was delighted by the sight of him, “Heavenly Exalt!”

The desolate race had three exalts, the Heavenly Exalt, Earthly Exalt, and Mortal Exalt! The Mortal and Earthly Exalts weren’t on his side, but the Heavenly Exalt was. Because the Heavenly Exalt was in the same branch of the desolate race as him!

The Heavenly Exalt glanced at the Mortal Exalt and spoke indifferently, “You’re broken the rules!”

The Mortal Exalt’s face was extremely unsightly!

Five World Realm experts couldn’t join the battle but Four World Realm experts could! Yet now, the Mortal Exalt had returned to the Five World Realm. So, strictly speaking, he’d broken the rules. Because if he didn’t return to the Five World Realm, Yang Ye’s attack would have destroyed his body.

Once his body was destroyed, it would be a huge loss for him!

“Not really!” Suddenly a middle aged man appeared by the Mortal Exalt’s side.

It was the Earthly Exalt!

The youngest among them too!

Huang Ying’s face fell at the sight of this. Obviously, the Earthly Exalt who hadn’t declared his stand until now was clearly not on his side!

The Earthly Exalt chuckled, “Heavenly Exalt, the patriarch said that Five World Realm experts are prohibited from interfering in the race’s affairs, and we cannot act against others of our race. However…”

He suddenly gazed at Yang Ye and smiled, “According to my knowledge, he isn’t from our race!”

At this moment, Yang Ye had recovered his consciousness. It was naturally because of Snowy and An Nanjing. Yang Ye glanced at the Earthly Exalt and remained silent.

The Mortal Exalt was stunned when he heard this, and then he smiled, “Indeed. He isn’t from the desolate race, so it isn’t against the rules, right?”

The Heavenly Exalt immediately frowned.

Meanwhile, Huang Ying walked over to the Heavenly Exalt and said, “Ancestor, Yang Ye is a friend of mine. He came with me because he trusts me, so please…”

The Heavenly Exalt suddenly shook his head, “I can’t save him!”

The Earthly Exalt and Mortal Exalt had joined forces, so he couldn’t save Yang Ye! It wasn’t that he refused to help, he couldn’t! That was what he was trying to say!

Huang Ying’s face instantly became quite unsightly.

He couldn’t help!

Huang Ying gazed at Yang Ye, and Yang Ye remained silent.

Nobody knew that right at this very moment, there was a hall deep beneath the ground, and a middle aged man without any limbs suddenly looked up. A short while passed before he grinned, “Is the desolate race that big of a deal..?”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye tightened his grip on his sword. While he was being targeted by two Five World Realm experts, Yang Ye’s face was extremely calm.

Death?

Yang Ye wasn’t afraid at all! Moreover, as far as he was concerned, even if he had to die, he wouldn’t die a coward.

He and his sword would never shrink back!

The Mortal Exalt couldn’t wait any longer and was about to attack, but Huang Ying suddenly spoke, “Wait!”

Everyone gazed at him.

Huang Ying walked over to them and said, “Are both of you really going to attack them?”

The Mortal Exalt laughed with ridicule, “Do you think we’re joking?”

Huang Ying closed his eyes slowly. A short while later, he flipped his right hand and a golden token appeared there.

The Earthly Exalt and Mortal Exalt frowned at the sight of it.

Huang Ying gazed at the command token and said, “The Desolate Path Token! When I was 24, I obtained it during a competition of our race. It gives me the special authority to make a Five World Realm expert of our race to help me.”

The Mortal Exalt’s face turned quite unsightly!

Actually, it was a way of rewarding the geniuses of their race. He’d had a similar token years ago, but he’d used it already! When one wasn’t at the Five World Realm yet, the help of such an expert was huge! He hadn’t expected Huang Ying to have kept it until now.

Suddenly, the Earthly Exalt laughed, “You seem to have forgotten then Five World Realm experts aren’t allowed to fight each other.”

Internal strife!

As far as the entire desolate race was concerned, the competition between Huang Ying and the others was just trivial. It was a form of tempering them. However, if even the Five World Realm experts of the desolate race fought against each other, it wouldn’t be trivial at all, it would be internal strife and internally exhausting the strength of their race. Thus, Five World Realm experts were prohibited from interfering in their race’s affairs. They were far away from authority, and they were prohibited from engaging in any form of internal strife!

No one dared to violate this rule! Someone had in the past, and that person still remains imprisoned until this day!

It could be said that if the desolate race wasn’t deciding on its crown prince, these Five World Realm experts wouldn’t have shown themselves at all.

“Internal strife?” Huang Ying chuckled, “Of course I’m aware that it’s prohibited! But what if I just ask the Heavenly Exalt and another elder to escort my friend out of here? If you stop them, then you’ll be the one starting internal strife!”

The Earthly Exalt’s eyes narrowed slightly, “A single Desolate Path Token can only make a single Five World Realm expert help you do a single thing. If you do this, you’re going to die once the Mortal Exalt and I suppress our cultivations.”

Huang Ying grinned and gazed at Yang Ye, “Brother Yang, I can’t take you around Desolate City anymore. Take care!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he raised the token and was about to speak, but the Heavenly Exalt suddenly asked, “Are you really going to waste all your hard work?”

Once Huang Ying didn’t use the token to help himself, it represented that Huang Ying’s journey was over. Because the Heavenly Exalt could never stop both the Earthly Exalt and Mortal Exalt!

Huang Ying grinned, “I really can’t just throw him into a trap like this, and I can’t just stand by idly as he dies.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and smiled, “This token was one of my trump cards, and I planned to use it at the critical moment to help me through all of this. But I didn’t expect that two of the three exalts in my desolate race were against me. Destiny really does play tricks on all of us! Brother Yang, take care!”

As he spoke, he crushed the token.

Hiss!

It transformed into a ray of white light that shot into the air. At the same time, Huang Ying’s voice resounded, “Sky Lord, I need your help!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the Sky Lord appeared before them again.

Huang Ying bowed slightly to the Sky Lord, “Please escort my friends out of the Desolate World!”Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

So long as they left the Desolate World, even the Earthly Exalt and Mortal Exalt wouldn’t dare to look for trouble with Yang Ye. They couldn’t remain at the Five World Realm out there, and the experts of Eternal Kingdom were outside too!

Sky Lord gazed at Huang Ying for a long time, and then he smiled, “Congratulations, you pass.”

The Earthly Exalt glanced at Huang Ying, “He’s not cold-blooded and ungrateful, I have no objections.”

He vanished into the sky once he finished speaking.

The Mortal Exalt glanced at Huang Ying, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “Fearless before powerful enemies and calm before death. You’re a man! Welcome to the desolate race.”

He vanished on the spot.
