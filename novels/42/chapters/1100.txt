Chapter 1101 – Compensation For Emotional Distress And Tuition!

Yang Ye gazed at Li Xueqing and spoke calmly, “I’m not asking you for it!”

Li Xueqing laughed coldly, “All the Cloud Shuttles throughout Sky Capital City are under my control now!”

Yang Ye ignored her and gazed at Bai Xiangyao. The latter pondered deeply for a moment, and then she asked, “Young Master Yang, where are you heading?”

Yang Ye replied, “Thousand Crane Dimension!”

“Thousand Crane Dimension?” Bai Xiangyao was slightly stunned, and then she said, “You can travel with Young Miss Ye. She’s returning to Apex City, and she just happens to be passing by Thousand Crane Dimension.”

Yang Ye asked, “That woman from before?”

Bai Xiangyao nodded.

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment, and then he nodded, “Alright.” The Cloud Shuttles weren’t ordinary things, and they weren’t under Bai Xiangyao’s control anymore, so it wasn’t nice for him to cause her too much trouble.

Bai Xiangyao grinned and said, “Come with me. I’ll send you there!”

Yang Ye nodded, and he intended to turn around and leave. Meanwhile, Li Xue Qing suddenly obstructed his path.

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “What?”

Li Xueqing said, “Apologize to me!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

Li Xueqing’s face became gloomy, “Apologize to me!”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a short while, and then he couldn’t help but chuckled, “I’m really very curious about why I should apologize to you. Give me a reason, alright?”

“I can’t stand the sight of you!” Li Xueqing contained, “Is that reason enough?”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “Based on your words and actions, I know that the power standing behind you is definitely not weak, and you should be someone who was spoiled and pampered since a young age. People like you are haughty and conceited, and they think they are the center of the universe. They think that everyone has to please them and act according to their will. If something doesn’t go as you will it, then you’ll be unable to stand the sight of that person. But you just so happen to have no ability at all. Your reliance is either your father, or grandfather. Am I right?”

“You’re the 1st who has dared to speak like this to me!” Li Xueqing’s eyes narrowed slightly and said, “I guarantee that you’ll be the last!”

At this point, she moved aside and said, “Kill him.” Her goal was to kill him. Because she didn’t want others to know how embarrassingly she’d acted just now and spread word of it.

However, the old man behind her hadn’t even acted when her eyes opened wide. Because Yang Ye had appeared in front of her. At the same time, Yang Ye’s hand had clamped down tightly on her throat.

“How dare you!” The old man’s expression changed drastically, and he shouted furiously, “Quickly let go of my Young Miss!”

Bai Xiangyao’s expression had changed slightly as well, and she quickly spoke, “Young Master Yang, please don’t act rashly.” She knew Yang Ye’s temper and character well, and she knew that he was one who knew no restraint.

Yang Ye glanced at Bai Xiangyao and said, “Don’t worry, Miss Bai. I had a sudden urge to give her a lesson.”

Yang Ye turned his head to gaze at Li Xueqing, and then he said, “See? If you don’t have any ability, then your life might be in another’s hands at any moment. As for your father or grandfather, do you think they can save you at a time like this?”

“If... if you dare to kill me, then... then my grand....” Li Xueqing glared angrily at Yang Ye and seemed to intend to say something. However, Yang Ye suddenly slammed her against the ground!

Bang!

Her face instantly collided against the ground, and an explosion resounded as the ground cracked apart while strands of blood sprayed out from the point of collision.

“AHHH!” A shrill cry instantly resounded.

“How dare you!” The old man was furious, and he disregarded everything and immediately slapped his right palm towards Yang Ye. A ray of brilliant light greeted that palm of his. It had only just come into contact with his palm when the old man’s expression changed drastically. Because the ray of light had pierced straight through his palm and shot through his shoulder as well!

A stream of blood sprayed out from him!

The old man was shocked and said, “Who... who exactly are you!” After all, Yang Ye had pierced through his palm with a single attack, and Yang Ye was only a Half-Saint. This time, the old man was shocked to the extreme. At the same time, he understood that he and his young miss had bit off more than they could chew again.

Yang Ye glanced at the old man, and then he lifted Li Xueqing up. At this moment, her beautiful face was covered in blood, and her features were distorted as well.

“You! AH!!! I’ll kill you!” Li Xueqing gazed at Yang Ye and howled madly. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly slammed her against the ground again.

Bang!

Blood sprayed towards the surroundings as the ground cracked further, and Li Xueqing’s shrill cries resounded once more. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“You....” The old man was horrified, and he seemed like he was about to attack. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly gazed at him and said, “Attack me and see what happens!”

The old man’s heart shook. He hesitated for an instant, and he didn’t dare to attack in the end. However, it was naturally impossible for him to just watch as Li Xueqing was tortured like that. He immediately said, “My Young Miss was insensible, and I apologize for her offense. Please do forgive her.”

He was no fool, this fellow before him possessed such terrifying strength and was just a Half-Saint. Such geniuses definitely possessed extraordinary backgrounds.

“If I didn’t possess sufficient strength, you would have allowed your young miss to do as she pleased; but now that I do, you concede and apologize? If it was before this, then perhaps I would have accepted your apology, but it’s too late now.”

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze, and then he lifted Li Xueqing up again, “Is your head clearer now? If it isn’t, and if you still can’t discern the situation clearly, then I’ll help you clear it up. Alright?”

“You... what exactly do you want!” Li Xueqing gazed at Yang Ye with terror in her eyes. She was truly quite afraid of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye said, “Do you understand the principle that I spoke of just now?”

“What... what principle?” As soon as Li Xueqing finished speaking, her head was slammed against the ground again.

Bai Xiangyao couldn’t bear to watch, but she didn’t say anything and just looked away.

The old man’s profound energy surged while rage appeared on his face. However, he didn’t dare to attack in the end. In the end, he could only shoot a pleading gaze at Bai Xiangyao. However, Bai Xiangyao clearly didn’t want to interfere, so she immediately acted like she hadn’t noticed his gaze.

Yang Ye lifted her up and said, “Do you remember now?”

“I... I remember....” Li Xueqing’s voice carried terror in it as she spoke, “I... I don’t have strength, so my life might be in the hands of another at any moment.... I... I really understand now. Don’t... don’t hit me anymore.” She actually started to cry at this point.

Li Xiangyao finally couldn’t continue watching anymore and said, “Young Master Yang....”

Yang Ye shrugged, “Alright, now it seems like I’m the bad guy.”

He released her and said, “Since you’ve understood, then there’s no need to continue this lesson. Now, let’s talk about the cost. Your threats caused severe harm to my mind and heart. Such harm can’t be healed without 500 violet crystals. As for the lesson I just gave you so that you understood how to act, I exhausted a huge amount of my mental strength. The fees for such tuition costs at least 500 violet crystals.”

At this point, Yang Ye stretched out his hand and said, “The total is 1,000 violet crystals. Thank you!”

Bai Xiangyao was speechless.

Li Xueqing was stunned as well. As soon as she recovered from her shock, she immediately glared angrily at Yang Ye, “One... one thousand violet crystals.... You....”

“You think it’s too little?” Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Alright, give me 1,500 then.”

“I.... You....” She glared angrily at Yang Ye. No one knew whether it was because of her anger or the injuries on her mouth, but she actually couldn’t finish a full sentence.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “What? Do you feel that’s too little as well? Then....”

“No!” Li Xueqing suddenly interrupted Yang Ye, “I... I don’t think it’s too little....”

Yang Ye stretched out his hand, “Then hand it over!”

Li Xueqing said, “I... I don’t have that much with me!”

Yang Ye replied, “Then we’ll continue your lesson!”

Li Xueqing’s expression changed drastically when she heard him, and she hurriedly said, “I can withdraw them.... I’ll withdraw them here.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Then do it quickly. I’m in a rush.”

Li Xueqing glanced at Yang Ye, and then she withdrew a gold card and passed it to Bai Xiangyao. Bai Xiangyao glanced at her, and then she turned around and left. In next to no time, Bai Xiangyao walked over and passed a spatial ring to Yang Ye, “There are 1,500 violet crystals in there!”

Yang Ye nodded lightly, and then he took it while a slight smile curled up on the corners of his mouth. If these 1,500 violet crystals were included, then he had 4,000 right now. That was a huge sum.

Bai Xiangyao said, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye nodded. Meanwhile, Li Xueqing suddenly asked, “What... what’s your name?”

Yang Ye gazed at her and said, “What? You intend to get even with me later?”

Li Xueqing didn’t dare look him in the eyes and spoke softly, “No... no....”

Yang Ye smiled and said, “It’s fine. If you want to look for trouble with me, you can come to White Deer Academy at any time. Right, my name is Xuwu Shen!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye walked off in a very carefree manner.

“Xu... Xuwu Shen....” Li Xueqing clenched her fists slowly.
