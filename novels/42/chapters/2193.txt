Chapter 2194 – Battle With a Progenitor!

The Weapon Dimension!

The Weapon Dimension instantly fell into chaos when the god race’s army arrived.

But it didn’t take long for an invisible wave of pressure to appear in the sky above the Weapon Dimension. An instant later, an old man appeared not too far away from Shi Tian.

It was the Weapon Progenitor!

The Weapon Progenitor glanced at Shi Tian, “We really were careless all those years ago.”

“Careless?” A cold smile curled up on the corners of Shi Tian’s mouth, “All of you really were careless. Now, isn’t it time to repay the debt you owe my god race?”

He waved his right hand once he finished speaking.

In an instant, the experts behind him charged into the Weapon Dimension.

Suddenly, countless experts appeared here.

Sages!

49 Sages!

They were led by the Buddhist Progenitor and the Dao Progenitor.

Besides that, the Evil Progenitor and Devil Progenitor were there too.

Four progenitors!

Once they found out that Shi Tian had been revived, it was impossible for them to have made no preparations.

They were allied together!

Presently, all three paths and the Alliance of All had formed an agreement to become allies that lived and died together. They’d agreed to fight the god race together. Of course, there was Yang Ye too. Yang Ye was a monstrous genius that they didn’t have the ability to kill anymore.

If they really wanted to kill him, they would have to pay a painful price!

It was a price that they could pay if the god race didn’t exist. However, the god race did exist. So, even if they knew that they couldn’t let Yang Ye continue growing, they were powerless to stop him.

Shi Tian’s eyes narrowed, “Your reaction is really quick.”

After he was revived, he’d planned to take them by surprise and annihilate the Weapon Path first. But he hadn’t expected them to have taken precautions.

Meanwhile, the Buddhist Progenitor pressed his palms together and praised Buddha before he said, “Shi Tian, everything that happened in the past. Why not look to the future? The large universe and all the races can live in harmony. You…”

“In the past?” Shi Tian had a ferocious expression on his face, “You old baldy! All of you annihilated hundreds of our cities and practically annihilated my god race, yet you’re saying it’s all in the past now?”

Shi Tian slammed a punch forward.

Bang!

A powerful wave of pressure rippled out, and the entire Weapon Dimension almost collapsed before it!

Meanwhile, the Buddhist Progenitor suddenly released a ray of golden light, and it flashed and obstructed Shi Tian’s attack.

Meanwhile, Shi Tian suddenly laughed coldly, “So all of you are injured!”

“Aren’t you too?” The Buddhist Progenitor replied indifferently, “You were heavily injured all those years ago and almost died. How much have you recovered now?”

Shi Tian’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he seemed to be considering something.

The Buddhist Progenitor spoke indifferently, “All those years ago, you were unmatched in the world. But after falling into deep sleep until now, you’re still the same person from back then, but all of us aren’t the same anymore. Even if we’re heavily injured, our joint forces can annihilate you. However, we’ll have to pay a price. If your god race really wants to die with us, then we’ll accompany you at any time!”

Die together!

Shi Tian slowly clenched his fists. If he attacked now, he really could bring them down with him. However, the god race would probably face annihilation.

In the end, Shi Tian glanced coldly at them and left with the experts from the god race.

“You won’t have to wait too long!” Shi Tian’s voice resounded through the sky.

The surroundings fell silent.

Presently, the Alliance of All and the three paths were in an extremely bad situation. They’d suffered a terrible price while trying to kill Yang Ye, but Yang Ye was still alive. Now, Yang Ye was growing stronger. The worst part was that the god race was back, and there was the End Times too. Now, the internal conflict between their forces was growing worse too.

They had no spirit energy!

Everyone wanted spirit energy!

Presently, it was a dog eat dog world, and only the strong survived. The weak had no ability to survive, and they could only be robbed and killed!

Stop it?

It was impossible to stop it. If they were stopped from plundering others, then how would they survive? Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Meanwhile, someone suddenly asked, “The Sprite Lord is in the god race’s hands?”

The Weapon Progenitor nodded slightly, “Indeed!”

The Buddhist Progenitor spoke softly, “We can’t seize that Sprite Lord for now. But it’s fine. That madman will definitely look for trouble with the god race, and the opportunity he creates for us while he keeps the god race busy will be beneficial for our recuperation.”

The others nodded.

Everyone knew how important the Sprite Lord was to Yang Ye. Since the god race had taken it, Yang Ye would definitely not let the matter rest.

Yang Ye.

At this moment, Yang Ye was in the starry sky.

The starry sky was boundless.

Yang Ye traveled through it on his own. A long time passed before he stopped, and a palace stood not too far ahead of him.

Nether Palace!

It was the headquarters of the Nether Pavilion.

Yang Ye walked slowly to it. Meanwhile, a black robed man appeared not too far away from him.

The black robed man shouted fiercely, “Who are you?”

Hiss!

A ray of blood red sword energy flashed.

In an instant, a layer of blood red mist covered the area, and the black robed man’s head flew up into the air.

It only took a moment for over a dozen terrifying auras to sweep toward Yang Ye.

Yang Ye took a step forward, and then a strand of slaughter intent surged out from him.

Boom!

The terrifying auras were instantly obliterated.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had entered Nether Palace, and there were 13 mysterious black robed figures in front of him.

They were about to attack when a voice resounded, “Let him pass!”

They turned around and moved to the side.

Meanwhile, a woman appeared not too far away from Yang Ye. It was Shao Siyou.

She sized up Yang Ye and smiled, “What? Want to take revenge?”

Meanwhile, a blood red sword suddenly appeared before her forehead, but it stopped when it just touched her forehead.

Shao Siyou was holding his sword with a mysterious energy, causing it to be unable to move an inch forward.

She gazed at him, “You are much stronger than before. However, you think you can kill a progenitor? You’re still too young!”

Bang!

As soon as she finished speaking, Yang Ye and his sword were blasted over 1km away. But it only took an instant for him to appear behind her, and then a sword stabbed into her back. However, it hadn’t really stabbed into anything.

Shao Siyou was over 1km away, where Yang Ye had been standing an instant ago.

Meanwhile, she stretched out her right hand. In an instant, strands of dark energy converged like a storm.

Yang Ye issued a command in his heart.

A sword howl resounded, and then rays of blood red sword energy appeared here.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

The entire area was filled with explosions. The strength they revealed blasted both of them over 10km away. However, as soon as he stopped himself, Yang Ye appeared in front of Shao Siyou again.

A blood red sword suddenly descended from above her.

Shao Siyou’s expression remained unchanged as she slapped her palm up.

Bang!

Yang Ye was pushed back again, but at the same time, Shao Siyou suddenly vanished. She was in front of Yang Ye when she appeared again, and then a ray of cold light shot toward Yang Ye’s throat.

Yang Ye’s reaction was extremely swift. However, he didn’t choose to block the attack, he just stabbed his sword forward.

A life for a life!

Shao Siyou didn’t dodge it, and the cold light sped up instead. Because she was confident that her dagger would slice Yang Ye’s throat first.

Just as she’d expected, it struck Yang Ye’s throat.

Hiss!

However, a thin layer of armor appeared there.

The Primordial Armor!

It fully stopped her dagger while Yang Ye’s sword stabbed against her chest.

Bam!

Shao Siyou was blasted away. Yang Ye was about to follow up with another attack when a black palm suddenly slammed down at him.

Yang Ye raised his sword and swung it!

Bang!

The black palm was instantly blasted apart while Yang Ye was pushed back again. At the instant that happened, Yang Ye waved his right palm, and a ray of blood red light slammed down at Shao Siyou like a bolt of lightning.

Meanwhile, an afterimage suddenly slammed against the blood red sword energy.

Boom!

The sword energy exploded apart. An instant later, Shao Siyou appeared in front of Yang Ye, and then a ferocious smile curled up on the corners of her mouth. At the same time, a pitch black palm slammed down at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was about to counterattack when it suddenly grew stronger, and an invisible wave of pressure appeared on Yang Ye. It almost crushed him.

It was extremely terrifying!

Suddenly, a mysterious force appeared here.

The Sword Domain!

As soon as it appeared, Shao Siyou’s expression changed slightly. A moment later, countless rays of blood red sword energy sliced the mysterious energy into bits, and then the sword energy enveloped her!

Boom!

A moment of silence ensued before Yang Ye’s sword energy exploded apart. At this moment, Shao Siyou was already 30km away.

She looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Interesting. I’ll fight you again once I’ve recuperated.”

She vanished on the spot with the other experts of the Nether Pavilion.

She was temporarily avoiding him!

After fighting him for a while, she noticed that she really couldn’t do anything to Yang Ye right now. Even if they continued and she won, it would be a pyrrhic victory. She was heavily injured, and she couldn’t allow Yang Ye to make it worsen.

So, she chose to leave!

Yang Ye’s face was extremely ferocious at this point, and he swung his blood red sword forward.

Boom!

The Nether Palace ahead of him was instantly obliterated!

Helpless!

He felt extremely helpless!

He couldn’t stop her from leaving at all!

A long time passed before Yang Ye took a deep breath and spoke softly, “Second Sister, Qin Chuan, Yu Jing, Brother Monkey… Give me a little more time, just a little. I’ll use the blood of the Alliance of All and the two paths as an offering to all of you!”
