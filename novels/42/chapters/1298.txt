Chapter 1299 – The Nie Clan!

The sword howl had just suddenly appeared here, and then a ray of sword energy that was fine like a hair flashed through the air.

“Yuan Jing! Watch out!” Senior Yuan roared with fury as a terrifying aura instantly surged out from within him. Even the space in an area of around 10km trembled violently before the aura he emanated.

At this moment, it seemed as if space was boiling!

Meanwhile, a black clothed figure appeared in front of Senior Yuan, and a palm slapped down towards him.

“Fuck off!” Senior Yuan slapped his palm forward. The heavens and the earth seemed to tremble before it, and the black robed figure was blasted 3km away.

“A puppet!” Senior Yuan’s expression changed drastically when he struck the black robed figure back, and he turned around to look at Yuan Jing.

“AH!” A shrill cry resounded abruptly. Senior Yuan watched with horror as a sword stabbed into the center of Yuan Jing’s forehead. At the same time, daggers stabbed into Yuan Jing’s nape and throat.

“NO!” Senior Yuan’s eyes almost split apart with rage. He pressed his palms together and pushed them in Yang Ye’s group’s direction.

Bang!

The space around Yang Ye’s group instantly rumbled and collapsed. A powerful mysterious force and the suction force of a spatial rift was about to obliterate Yang Ye and the others. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Suddenly, a ray of violet light flashed, and then the expanse of space that Senior Yuan collapsed had been instantly restored. Even though space had been restored, the terrifying attack that Senior Yuan executed hadn’t vanished, and the force within it blasted Yang Ye and the others 3km away. In the end, they were only able to destroy that force by joining forces.

However, a wisp of blood had seeped out from the corners of their mouths.

All 3 of them had extremely solemn expressions on their faces. They hadn’t expected Senior Yuan’s strength to be so terrifying. Even Yang Ye had never expected this. While he knew that the old man was extremely strong, he hadn’t expected the old man to be that strong. The old man’s strength wasn’t any weaker to the Ten Thousand Legged Centipede on Sword God Island. Yang Ye felt quite fortunate when he realized how terrifying the strength that the old man possessed was. He felt fortunate that he’d made the right decision just now.

He’d planned to assault Senior Yuan just now. But now it would seem like even their joint forces launched as a surprise attack would probably be incapable of annihilating Senior Yuan in an instant. Once they failed to kill him as soon as possible and allowed both Senor Yuan and Yuan Jing to join forces, then not to mention killing Senior Yuan, they wouldn’t have even been able to kill Yuan Jing!

“Good! Very good! Yang Ye!” Senior Yuan spoke ferociously, “First you launched a surprise attack against my Yuan Clan and made all of us rush here. However, once we got here, you made your forces launch surprise attacks against the other clans and sects. But once they returned to their sects and clans, you returned for a second attack! What a plan! Everyone says that you, Yang Ye, are more bold than wise, conceited, and act willfully. They say you’re a fool! Haha! If you’re a fool, then wouldn’t all of us be worse than a fool?!”

Yang Ye gazed at Senior Yuan for a short moment before he said, “Kill him!”

As soon as he spoke, Shui Linlang and Qian Lankong instantly vanished on the spot. At the instant they vanished, a blood red sword appeared in Yang Ye’s grasp. At the same time, the Sword God’s Seal appeared on Yang Ye’s forehead. The blood red sword shook violently before Yang Ye’s figure vanished on the spot.

A ray of blood red light, that was fine as a hair, flashed through the air. Space was instantly torn apart before it, and the sharp sword energy it carried caused countless people in Yuan Heaven City to dare not look at it.

Senior Yuan couldn’t seek help while the violet mink was here. So, why wouldn’t Yang Ye seize the opportunity to kill him? Even though the old geezer before Yang Ye possessed extremely terrifying strength, he had 2 Voider Realm assassins and a Voider Realm Sword Servant on his side. If he was included, it was equivalent to 4 Voiders. If it was 4 against 1, then would they have to flee?

If they killed Senior Yuan now, then those clans and sects would be without a leader for some time. At that time, Yang Ye would have the chance to crush them, one by one!

Senior Yuan’s eyes narrowed slightly when he saw Yang Ye attack. Even though a ferocious expression could be seen in his eyes, there was also a trace of seriousness there. Obviously, his mind was still clear right now. If anyone were to still look down upon Yang Ye at a time like this, that person would definitely be a moron.

Senior Yuan glanced at the surroundings. He knew those 2 assassins were hiding in the surroundings. He pondered deeply for an instant before he suddenly raised his hands, and then the space around him warped along with the movements of his hands. However, it didn’t take long for space to instantly return to normal! Senior Yuan was shocked. Obviously, it was the violet clothed young woman.

Since space had returned to normal, Senior Yuan’s plans to warp space in order to stop Qian Lankong and Shui Linlang had instantly failed.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword arrived in front of Senior Yuan. At the same time, a strand of terrifying sword intent pressed down upon him. Moreover, the auras of 2 Voiders appeared at the same time!

The 3 waves of pressure that slammed down upon him caused Senior Yuan’s entire body to tremble. Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword had arrived before the center of Senior Yuan’s forehead.

However, right when Yang Ye’s sword was about to stab into the old man’s forehead, the old man moved his head slightly to the side and avoided Yang Ye’s attack. At the same time, a furious shout resounded, “Sky Annihilation!”

Bang!

A terrifying aura suddenly surged out from within Senior Yuan, and then an energy palm exploded in midair and formed a shockwave that swept towards the surroundings.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

3 muffled explosions resounded around Senior Yuan. Shui Linlang and Qian Lankong who were hidden in space and hadn’t been able to attack yet were instantly blasted away. As for Yang Ye, he was pushed around 1km back. However, just a moment passed before Yang Ye’s figure transformed into a ray of blood red light that slashed down at Senior Yuan.

Senior Yuan’s eyes narrowed slightly. He stretched out his hand and a silver iron rod appeared in his grasp, and he waved it at Yang Ye. Right when the iron rod collided with Yang Ye’s sword, Yang Ye’s sword suddenly angled slightly to the side and stabbed against the side of the iron rod’s tip. In an instant, the iron rod shook violently, causing Senior Yuan’s entire arm to feel numb while the iron rod almost left his grasp.

Destroying all techniques with a single strike! Senior Yuan was shocked. He was about to attack when Yang Ye’s sword angled towards the side again, and it arrived below the iron rod before being flicked up.

Clang!

Along with a clear and resounding sound of collision, the iron rod in Senior Yuan’s grasp was flicked out of his grasp and shot into the air.

Senior Yuan was shocked. Meanwhile, Yang Ye had let inertia move him and stabbed swiftly at Senior Yuan’s chest. It was extremely swift to the point the old man couldn’t dodge anymore. Because it was too close, and Yang Ye was too swift!

Senior Yuan remained calm and composed. The fingers on his right hand curled inward to form a claw, and then he clawed at Yang Ye’s sword. However, Yang Ye’s sword suddenly stopped, and at the instant Senior Yuan was about to hit his sword, Yang Ye’s sword moved abruptly once more. He launched a slanted stab at Senior Yuan’s pinky!

Senior Yuan’s expression changed drastically. He wanted to pull his hand back, but it was too late. Yang Ye’s sword pierced through the old man’s pinky with ease, and then it swiftly pierced through the old man’s palm before Yang Ye flicked it up lightly.

Hiss!

Half of Senior Yuan’s palm flew up into the air while followed by a trail of blood. Meanwhile, a dagger suddenly appeared at Senior Yuan’s nape. But right when it was about to stab into his nape, Senior Yuan suddenly pressed his left hand downward.

Bang!

The space around Senior Yuan instantly expanded and blasted the dagger away. At the instant that dagger was blasted away, a ray of violet light flashed before the space around Senior Yuan instantly returned to normal.

Senior Yuan’s face became extremely gloomy when he noticed this. Because many of his techniques couldn’t be utilized now, and it was especially so for those techniques related to space. They were practically useless. But if he didn’t utilize spatial techniques, he would be utterly incapable of locating the 2 assassins that were hiding around him.

He was in a passive position!

An extremely passive position!

At the moment that the dagger was blasted away, Yang Ye’s sword had appeared before Senior Yuan again.

Senior Yuan’s face was quite unsightly as he gazed at Yang Ye. If it was a one on one battle, then he would naturally not fear Yang Ye. Yet now, he had to divert his attention to those 2 assassins while facing Yang Ye. Under such circumstances, he didn’t dare to use his full strength against Yang Ye. But if he didn’t use his full strength....

Earlier, the reason he’d lost half his palm was because he’d saved some strength to deal with the assassins.

I have to retreat! It only took an instant for Senior Yuan to decide. It was very likely that he would die if he stayed and fought them. Because Yang Ye’s strength wasn’t much weaker to him, and once those 2 assassins were included, the strength Yang Ye’s side possessed had completely surpassed him. The best outcome from letting the battle continue was taking one of them down with him!

He naturally didn’t want to die right now!

Once he made up his mind, Senior Yuan slapped his left palm forward, and an energy palm shot forward and collided with Yang Ye’s sword. However, the energy palm wasn’t able to stop Yang Ye, and it was instantly blasted apart by Yang Ye’s sword.

Meanwhile, Senior Yuan seized the opportunity to shoot towards the sky.

“Fleeing?” A ferocious smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth. He issued a command in his heart, and a black robed figure descended from the sky and shot towards Senior Yuan. It was Yang Ye’s Voider Realm Sword Servant, of course. He hadn’t made it join the battle as a precaution for the possibility that Senior Yuan fled.

Senior Yuan’s eyes narrowed slightly when he saw the Voider Realm Sword Servant charge down towards him, and a wisp of ferocity flashed through his eyes. He slammed his left palm upwards.

Bang!

The Sword Servant was blasted around 300m back. Meanwhile, Yang Ye had arrived in front of Senior Yuan, and Heaven’s Gravestone shot towards the center of Senior Yuan’s forehead. At the same time, 2 daggers appeared before the old man’s nape and throat. Besides that, Yang Ye’s Rebirth Rank sword intent, and the auras of both Shui Linlang and Qian Lankong had pressed down upon Senior Yuan.

The violet mink didn’t stand by idly as well. The space above Senior Yuan suddenly started to overlap in layers and press down upon the old man.

4 forces pressed down upon Senior Yuan, causing his body to bend while cracking resounded throughout it.

It was a lethal attack!

Suddenly, a huge palm emerged from the sky and clawed lightly. Senior Yuan was instantly pulled out, and the joint attack of Yang Ye and the others hit nothing but air.

Yang Ye’s face instantly became gloomy. He looked up and saw a woman had appeared in the sky.

At this moment, the woman’s gaze was on him, and she withdrew a command token, “Heaven Pillar Mountain Range’s Nie Clan!”

“Fuck off!” As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, a beam of sword energy shot up into the sky in the woman’s direction.
