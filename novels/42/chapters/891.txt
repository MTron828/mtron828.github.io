Chapter 892 – I Can’t Stand The Sight Of You!

Translator: InVader

Editor: Conspiracing

Bang!

A figure was blasted flying, and it was Yu Feng’s figure!

One move! One move again!

At this moment, they weren’t shocked anymore, they were utterly astounded. After all, Yu Feng was at the peak of the low rank in the Exalt Realm! But such an expert had actually been unable to even fight back!

How strong is he!?

Yu Feng was completely dazed when he crashed to the ground. Because he hadn’t seen how Yang Ye attacked at all before his figure was blasted flying.

Quite some time passed, and he was just about to stand up when Yang Ye arrived in front of him and grabbed his hair. Yang Ye said, “Looks like you really don’t need any education!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he raised Yu Feng up and smashed him against the ground.

Bang!

This continued for a few hundred times.

In the beginning, Yu Feng was still letting out shrill cries. But in the end, he didn’t make a single sound anymore.

It didn’t take long for Yu Feng’s body to be transformed into a pile of mush while his head still remained in Yang Ye’s grasp.

Yang Ye casually tossed the head away, and then he glanced at Xia Bingwei’s group and said, “See? If you don’t know how to keep a low profile, then it’s very likely for that to happen to all of you.”

Xiao Bingwei and the others instantly shuddered. This time, they were truly terrified.

“You’re very right!” Suddenly, a man walked over from afar. He wore a black robe, and there was an over 10 centimeter long scar on his neck. It was quite a hideous sight. At this moment, his eyes were fixed on Yang Ye, and there was horrifying killing intent within them!

There was a green robed man by the black robed man’s side, and he had a cold expression on his face and a sword chest on his back.

“Cousin Brother....” Tears immediately erupted from Xia Bingwei’s eyes when she saw him, and she immediately leaped into his arms and held tightly to him. Her tears truly surged even strongly than a river!

Leng Yuran and the others’ expressions changed drastically when they heard her, and they gazed at the black robed man with astonishment. They hadn’t imagined that the black robed man was the legendary Feng Wuchao!

While Feng Wuchao wasn’t as famous as the 5 great geniuses of the prefecture, he was extremely well known in an area of hundreds of thousands of kilometers around Ocean of Clouds City. Even though he was only at the Monarch Realm, he’d once fought a Half-Saint as well!

Leng Yuran and the others were quite strong, but the gap between them and a Half-Saint was still extremely large. So, Feng Wuchao was definitely an existence who they could only look up to. That was exactly why they didn’t dare stand by idly and had lent a hand to Xia Bingwei’s group.

Now that they saw Feng Wuchao in the flesh, it was absolutely a lie if they said they weren’t afraid. But while they were afraid, they didn’t leave. They moved closer towards Yang Ye and indicated their intent to support Yang Ye until the end.

The black robed man slowly stroked Xia Bingwei’s back while he consoled, “Don’t be afraid. No one can bully you while I’m here!”

Xia Bingwei cried as she pointed at Yang Ye. However, she quickly withdrew her hand when she noticed Yang Ye’s gaze, and then she didn’t dare speak another word and just cried.

How terribly was she bullied to be in such a state? The black robed man’s face grew even gloomier, and he raised his head to look at Yang Ye before he said, “I’ve never had the heart to scold her since she was young, but you actually hit her. Haha! Tell me, how do you want to die?”

Yang Ye gazed at Xia Bingwei and said, “Did I bully you?”

Obviously, Yang Ye was still quite deterring and terrifying because she merely glanced at him yet didn’t dare speak a word.

Yang Ye shrugged and said, “Actually, I did it for her own good!”

“You hit her for her own good?” Feng Wuchao was furious, “Good! Very good! I know what an arrogant fellow is like now!” When he spoke up to this point, he pushed Xia Bingwei away lightly, and then he walked towards Yang Ye, “Now, I want to do something for your own good as well!”

Feng Wuchao was about to attack when a voice suddenly resounded from afar, “Madman, who offended you? You seem so furious?”

As soon as the voice finished resounding, a woman arrived here. She wore a black dress and held a black umbrella while a playful smile hung on her face.

Fen Wuchao spoke in a low voice, “Mo Xinyu!”

The woman called Mo Xinyu grinned, and then her gaze lingered on Xia Bingwei for a moment before she said, “Interesting. Someone actually dared to hit that precious cousin sister of yours.” When she spoke up to this point, she turned to look at Yang Ye and said, “You did it?”

Yang Ye nodded while he sized up Mo Xinyu as well. Needless to say, both she and Feng Wuchao were really not bad. Both of them were at the peak of the low rank in the Exalt Realm, but their strengths were absolutely far superior to some Monarch Realm experts.

A fierce smile arose on the corners of Mo Xinyu’s mouth, “I hate men who hit women! No matter why you did it, you still deserve death!”

As soon as she finished speaking, her umbrella started spinning before a few dozen rays of silver light shot explosively towards Yang Ye.

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the silver rays of light were completely dispersed in an instant.

Mo Xinyu and Feng Wuchao’s eyes narrowed slightly when they witnessed this scene.

“Brother Feng, Young Miss Mo, looks like you’ve encountered an expert!” Meanwhile, a green clothed man who carried a sword chest on his back spoke abruptly, “I didn’t intend to interfere, but I truly agree with Young Miss Mo. No matter why, it’s wrong to hit a woman!”

As he spoke, he suddenly pressed his middle and index fingers together before pointing them at Yang Ye. A ray of light shot into the sky from the sword chest on his back, and then it slashed straight towards Yang Ye like a bolt of lightning!

Peak 9th level sword intent! Mo Xinyu and Feng Wuchao had solemn expressions in their eyes when they witnessed this scene.

However, Yang Ye stretched out 2 fingers and clamped down lightly. Just like that, the sword which carried 9th level sword intent was clamped between his fingers.

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Your sword intent isn’t condensed sufficiently, and it isn’t fast enough as well! You have to practice more....”

All of them were speechless.

This time, it wasn’t just a solemn expression that filled their eyes, it was an extremely solemn expression, and it was especially so for the man with the sword chest.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye flicked his fingers, and the sword transformed into a ray of light which shot back towards the man. His expression changed, and then profound energy within him instantly surged into his right hand. After that, his hand swept forward and took hold of the sword’s hilt.

Om!

The sword trembled violently while his right hand cracked apart. Moreover, he was even pushed back by the powerful force carried by the sword.

“You....’ The green clothed man gazed at Yang Ye with astonishment once he finally stopped himself. At this moment, his confidence had collapsed because he’d almost been unable to resist even a single attack from Yang Ye.

Feng Wuchao spoke in a low voice, “Who are you!?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Why don’t you guess!”

“There’s no need to guess. You aren’t a participant of the test at all!” Suddenly, a voice resounded, and an old man appeared here.

“Elder Xi!” The others here quickly bowed respectfully to the old man, and even Feng Wuchao’s group was no exception. While Elder Xi was only an elder of the outer court, his authority in the outer court was huge. So, how could they dare to offend him?

Yang Ye glanced at the old man and asked, “Who are you?”

The old man laughed with ridicule and said, “You don’t even recognize an elder of the outer court like me. How laughable! How dare you sneak into my academy!? You would absolutely be unable to accomplish this on your own. So be truthful and tell me if you have other companions!”

Yang Ye turned around to look at Leng Yuran before he asked, “Are the elders of instructors more powerful in the outer court?”

Leng Yuran glanced at Yang Ye, and he hesitated for a moment before he said, “The instructors. The instructor manages the entire outer court and enjoys a position that’s above the elders! You... you know the instructor of our outer court?”

“So the instructor’s status is above the elders....” Yang Ye nodded and said, “Actually....”

“Actually, he’s a student who has come to participate in the recruitment test!” A voice appeared abruptly out of thin air, “He wasn’t earlier, but he is now!”

Elder Xi’s expression changed, “That’s against the rules!”

However, there was no reply from the voice.

Elder Xi’s face grew even more unsightly!

Yang Ye looked up into the sky, and then he grinned, “Alright, I accept!” He knew that the person who spoke should be aware of his identity, and the reason that person had made such a decision was probably because that person didn’t want him to use the situation as an excuse to beat up a member of the academy.

Elder Xi gazed at Yang Ye and spoke gloomily, “Looks like you have some backing in the academy!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s alright!”

Elder Xi gazed at Yang Ye with a gloomy expression on his face, “Don’t even think that you can act arrogantly because you have backing in the academy. The outer court belongs to me, Xi Manfeng. Not to mention whether you’ll be able to pass the test, even if you do, I can still get you killed. As for your backing.... Hmph! Do you think that I don’t have any backing in the academy?”

The smile on Yang Ye’s face gradually vanished as he said, “Do you really have to be like that?” He knew that the reason the old man intended to do that was none other than because that mysterious person from before had overruled him. So, the old man was venting on Yang Ye instead. Such lack of tolerance....

“No!” A cold smile arose on the corners of Xi Manfeng’s mouth, “But I can’t stand the sight of you! You’re Ye Yang, right? Just you wait....”

“Looks like we don’t have to do anything!” Feng Wuchao laughed coldly, and then he turned around and flashed off with Mo Xinyu and the others.

Leng Yuran suddenly said to Yang Ye, “You’re finished!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Leng Yuran replied, “The outer court doesn’t have an instructor now, so the outer court elders can be said to possess absolute authority. So, aren’t you finished because you’ve offended him? Besides that, the academy has been in contact with Welkin Wolf Mountain Range for so many years, so that elder definitely knows the Demon Commander of the mountain range. He wouldn’t even have to wait for you to enter the academy before he deals with you. He just has to notify the Demon Commander, and you’ll definitely die a graveless death....”

Roar!

Leng Yuran had just finished speaking when a roar resounded from afar, and then a Monarch Realm wolf demon led over 40 Exalt Realm wolf demons in a dash from afar....

Their target was Yang Ye’s group!
