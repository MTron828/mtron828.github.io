Chapter 1922 – It’s Time to Go!

Yang Ye’s face remained calm. He’d expected the Nansi Clan to leave.

Even though the Nansi Clan did owe him a little, it would absolutely not go against the Sovereign of Man for him. As for what Nansi Tian had said earlier about not refusing if his request was within the Nansi Clan’s ability, he hadn’t taken it seriously at all.

He never placed his hopes on others.

The only thing that did surprise him was Nansi Yin’s actions!

He hadn’t expected her to do that for him.

The violet robed man and the others didn’t attack. The old man gazed at the middle aged man who led the group from the Shaman Hunter Clan, “The Sovereign of Man has issued a warrant for his capture, so please hand him over to me and allow me to take him back!”

The middle aged man frowned slightly, “He doesn’t just possess the shaman race’s bloodline, he has cultivated their techniques too, and he even killed members of my clan. My Shaman Hunter Clan is determined to kill him!”

The old man smiled, “Don’t worry, we have the same objective. The Sovereign of Man won’t let him live. We’re only taking him back because the Sovereign of Man wants to ask him something.”

The middle aged man fell silent for a long time and said, “We’ll go back with you!”

A wisp of displeasure flashed through the old man’s eyes, but he didn’t refuse. The Shaman Hunter Clan was an existence that even the Sovereign of Man had to give face to.

The old man restrained his thoughts and gazed at Yang Ye, “I presume that you won’t just let us capture you. So, go on and use your trump card. Remember that you only have a single chance!”

Yang Ye glanced at them and chuckled. He didn’t say another word and just took a step forward. He was about to activate the Invincible Sword Domain.

It was his trump card, but he had to use it now.

All of their cultivations far surpassed his own. So, if he didn’t use it, he wouldn’t have even the slightest chance to win.

Of course, even if he did use it, he wasn’t very confident in being able to survive.

Right when Yang Ye was about to activate the Invincible Sword Domain, a voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Kid, it’s time for me to go.”

Yang Ye stopped. It was Qiong Qi’s voice!

A moment later, Qiong Qi appeared above Yang Ye’s head.

The violet robed old man and the others frowned when they saw Qiong Qi. A moment later, the middle aged man from the Shaman Hunter Clan spoke solemnly, “You… you’re the Demon King, Qiong Qi?”

Qiong Qi glanced at the middle aged man. Meanwhile, the middle aged man said, “No, a Demon King shouldn’t be so weak. You… you’re not your main body, you’re just a clone!”

Qiong Qi ignored the middle aged man and gazed at Yang Ye, “What do you feel after coming to the large universe?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Nothing much. The only thing I feel is that I’m a little too weak!”

“It isn’t just a little!” Qiong Qi continued, “You’re extremely weak. If you don’t use your trump cards, you can’t defeat anyone here; even if you use those trump cards, you won’t be able to kill them all.”

Yang Ye fell silent because Qiong Qi wasn’t wrong!

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi said, “While you’re a human and I’m a demon, I have to say that you’re really to my liking. You’re not that hypocritical and full of righteousness like other humans. While it’s kind of against the rules, I really can’t just stand by idly and watch something like this happen.”

The violet robed old man suddenly said, “You don’t seem to have the ability to do that!”

Qiong Qi glanced at the old man, and then he looked up at the sky, “He should be here now!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a black speck of light appeared in the sky. The light grew larger and larger. In the end, a robust middle aged man appeared here. The man was two times taller and larger than an ordinary person. His upper body was bare, muscular, and seemed filled with strength!

Most importantly, as soon as he arrived, everyone here felt a wave of pressure!

The middle aged man’s gaze immediately fell on Qiong Qi, and then he walked over and took a knee, “My King, I’m Shou Ning!”

Qiong Qi nodded slightly, and then he glanced at the old man in violet robes, “Kill him!”

The middle aged man didn’t say a word and just swung his fist at the old man.

As soon as Qiong Qi gave the order, the old man’s expression changed drastically. He decisively chose to attack first, and a wave of powerful aura swept out from him and slammed down upon Qiong Qi and the middle aged man.

However, as soon as the middle aged man’s punch shot forward, the old man’s aura vanished without a trace. An instant later, his body exploded apart and was transformed into a pile of mush!

“A Dao Realm expert!” The middle aged man from the Shaman Hunter Clan stared at Shou Ning while fear filled his eyes!

A Dao Realm expert?

Yang Ye gazed at Qiong Qi, and the latter explained, “The Dao Realm is above the Enlightened Realm, and it’s divided into the Hear, Know, See, and Attain Dao Realms. They represent hearing the Dao, knowing the Dao, seeing the Dao, and attaining the Dao.”

Yang Ye nodded to display his understanding.

Qiong Qi gazed at the experts from the Shaman Hunter Clan and the Sovereign of Man’s subordinates, “Are you still not going to fuck off?” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The middle aged man from the Shaman Hunter Race glanced at Qiong Qi, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “This isn’t the end of this!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot with the others from the Shaman Hunter Clan.

The 12 Gold Envoys and the others that the Sovereign of Man sent immediately left as well.

With a Dao Realm expert here, they knew that they could never kill Yang Ye.

Qiong Qi asked, “Are you wondering why I didn’t kill all of them?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Qiong Qi explained, “They would have been obliterated by now if we were in the Demon Dimension. Even if it’s the Shaman Dimension, I would have killed all of them. However, this is the Human Dimension. If I slaughter all of them, it’ll break some agreements between the human race and demon race!”

Yang Ye smiled, “No matter what, thank you. So, did your main body not come?”

Qiong Qi shook his head slightly, “If my main body comes here, it’ll alarm some old fellows in the human race. At that time, we’ll be facing even more trouble. I don’t have much time. Kid, come to the Demon Dimension if you can’t survive in the Human Dimension.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course!”

Qiong Qi nodded. He didn’t say another word and just vanished into the sky with Shou Ning.

Qiong Qi was gone!

Needless to say, Yang Ye was quite reluctant. He’d been with Qiong Qi for quite some time, and Qiong Qi was like a master and friend to him. Now that Qiong Qi was gone, he didn’t know when they would meet again!

A long time passed before Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, gazed at Broken Cliff Mountain, and then vanished on the spot.

The Shaman Dimension again!

This time, his destination was Yin Gorge. He planned to find Yin Hou, and then go to the Sky Dimension.

The Sky Dimension!

After he entered the Shaman Dimension, Yang Ye concealed himself to avoid necessary trouble. Around six hours later, he finally arrived at Yin Forge.

Yin Gorge wasn’t very huge, and he could see the end of it. The mountain was covered in black mist, and it even emanated a cold and gloomy aura.

Yang Ye sized up the mountain and gorge, and then he asked, “Senior, is she easy to deal with?”

Hou Qing replied, “She’s alright!”

“She’s alright?” Yang Ye had quite a strange expression on his face. Because Hou Qing’s voice carried some hesitance.

Yang Ye looked up at the mountain. Is his information reliable?

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and walked towards the mountain. It didn’t take long for him to enter it, and then he immediately felt a cold aura here. It was bone piercing and icy cold like he’d walked into a pit of ice!

When he was about to arrive at the top of the mountain, a powerful aura descended and locked onto him. After that, Yang Ye couldn’t move a muscle.

A Dao Realm expert!

Meanwhile, a voice came from the top of the mountain, “As a human, you possess the shaman race’s bloodline, and you’re even cultivated my shaman race’s body refinement technique. Human, who are you? Why have you come here?”

Yang Ye replied, “I’m Yang Ye. I was told to come see you.”

The voice asked, “Who?”

Yang Ye issued a command in his heart, and the command token Hou Qing gave him floated up into the air. A moment later, it vanished.

The surroundings fell silent. Two breaths of time later, a woman suddenly appeared in front of him.

The woman wore a black dress studded with all sorts of strange flowers. It didn’t just end on her dress, even her right face had an unknown black flower on it, causing her beauty to have a sense of mystery to it!

Yin Hou!

Yang Ye knew that she was Yin Hou.

She walked slowly to Yang Ye and looked him in the eyes, “Where did you get that?”

Yang Ye replied, “A senior gave it to me and asked me to come see you!”

She asked, “Where is he now?”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “I’m sorry, I can’t tell you that!”

Her eyes narrowed slightly while gloomy cold light flickered in them.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched at the sight of this, and then he hurriedly said, “It’s not that I refuse to tell you, it’s he who doesn’t want to tell you!”

He felt that Hou Qing should carry that burden and deal with it himself! He really couldn’t endure it himself!

A short while passed before she asked, “He’s still alive?”

Yang Ye nodded, “He is. But he’s heavily injured, and he’s in a safe place now.”

He naturally wouldn’t tell anyone else about the Primordial Pagoda.

She fell silent for a while, and then gazed at him, “Who are you to him?”

Yang Ye was stunned. It was a difficult question for him, and he thought for a while before he answered, “I can be considered to be his disciple!”

Hou Qing had taught him the techniques of the shaman race and given him the shaman race’s bloodline, so it wasn’t too far-fetched to consider Hou Qing his master. After all, he couldn’t say Hou Qing was his friend!

Ghastly cold killing intent flashed through her eyes, and then Yang Ye felt something press down on his throat before suffocation assaulted him.
