Chapter 2600

Yang Ye walked outside, and there were around 10 people in the air.

The group was led by an old man at the Lord Realm, and Yang Ye just happened to recognize the old man.

It was a Lord Realm expert he’d met in the Lu Clan!

An expert from the Lu Clan!

There were two black robed men by his side, and the rest were clearly not from the Soul Sect as well.

Meanwhile, Sword Scroll appeared by Yang Ye’s side. She glanced at them and said, “The Lu Clan, Leng Clan, Xing Clan, Heaven’s Avatar… They’re all here!”

This time, all the powers of Eternal Kingdom were attacking openly.

Yang Ye nodded slightly.

The experts of the Xing Clan were here!

But not the Ye Clan!

Yang Ye fell into deep thought.

The old man from the Lu Clan frowned from the sight of Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, you’re actually back!”

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and looked up at the old man with a grin on his face, “I’m sorry to disappoint you!”

The old man shook his head, “Not at all. Since you’re back, then we’ll deal with you too! It saves us time, so…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

A ray of sword energy shot up into the sky.

The old man’s pupils constricted, and then he clenched his right fist and slammed it forward.

Boom!

A wave of powerful energy erupted like a volcano and rippled forward.

The entire sky rippled!

However, along with the arrival of the sword energy, the fist energy was sliced apart into bits.

Bang!

A moment later, the sky shook, and a figure was blasted away.

The old man!

While his figure shot backward, two flying swords flashed through the air, and the old man’s head flew up into the air.

Blood sprayed in a beautiful arc. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The entire sky fell deathly silent!

All the experts here gazed at Yang Ye with astonishment!

A short moment later, a voice resounded, “Retreat for now.”

As soon as the voice resounded, the others were about to leave. But Yang Ye suddenly shook his head, “All of you should stay!”

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Rays of sword energy shot through the air like shooting stars!

“AH!” Shrill cries resounded incessantly through the sky.

In just a few breaths of time, the entire sky was covered in fragments of corpses!

Sword Scroll was stunned by the sight of this!

Yang Ye’s strength felt unfamiliar to her right now!

Yang Ye stood there in midair while two swords floated silently by his side!

They were the Sword Supreme and Sword Precursor. At this moment, they were enveloped by his sword intent.

They were greatly enhanced by Yang Ye’s sword intent, and it could be said that they were strong because of him. He wasn’t using their strength to be strong!

The swords were still the same swords, but their strength wasn’t the same!

As for Executor, he hadn’t used it yet!

It wasn’t necessary when facing these experts!

Yang Ye returned to the underground area and went to Blood Maiden, “Second Sister, help me take care of this place.”

She glanced at him, “You’re going to seek them out?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She said, “That is unwise!”

Yang Ye smiled, “This isn’t over. If I stay here, this place will be the battlefield. More and more of their experts will come here. So, I must take the initiative to attack. If I’m out there, their attention will be on me. In that way, this place will be safer.”

Blood Maiden fell silent.

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something and said, “Second Sister, take Nether Maiden and the others with you and leave this place. Eternal Kingdom and the desolate race are about to go to war, so don’t get yourselves mixed up in it.”

She glanced at him, “You called us here!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “I regret my decision.”

She shook her head slightly, “Forget that. Just do what you must do, and then come back to us. We need your help with something.”

She turned around and left.

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while, and then he was about to leave. Suddenly, Sword Scroll said, “I received a message from Lianshuang!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Lianshuang?”

Sword Scroll nodded slightly, “I don’t know how she did it. She said that Snowy and Erya are being very mischievous, and so she is forced to send them back here!”

“Mischievous?” Yang Ye was stunned, “What did they do there?”

Sword Scroll shook her head, “I don’t know the specifics. All I do know is that they are being very mischievous. Right, they miss you too. So, they may return soon.”

Return!

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time and said, “That’s good news. I miss them too. Maintain contact with them. I’ll go get them when they return!”

Yang Ye turned around and left on his sword.

Sword Scroll glanced at the direction Yang Ye had left toward, and she felt slight anticipation.

She looked forward to Snowy’s return!

Snowy’s return represented that she would be able to return to her true form.

At that time, she would be able to truly help Yang Ye, and not like what she was doing now. Now, she could only help him manage the sect’s affairs.

She really looked forward to it!

In the underground area, Blood Maiden arrived at Nether Maiden and the others’ abode.

Blood Maiden glanced at them and said, “Alright, I’ll be frank. Big Sister… may be in trouble.”

All of their expressions instantly turned unsightly.

…

Yang Ye left the mountain range. But he didn’t go straight for the Soul Sect or the Eternal Kingdom’s other powers. He went to War Dimension.

He met Ye Zhibei there.

They sat by the peak of a mountain.

Yang Ye suddenly said, “Thank you!”

Ye Zhibei shook her head, “I was just looking out for the clan. The facts prove that none of the other powers have gained anything, and they’ve even lost many forces too. So, our Ye Clan has gained much more than them.”

She gazed at Yang Ye, “Don’t blame Biqing. She has withdrawn herself from her position as successor.”

Yang Ye's right hand trembled slightly, and he fell silent for a long time before he said, “Because of the Ancient Sword Sect?”

Ye Zhibei nodded, “Even though we are future successors of our clans, I’m sure you know that so long as the seniors of the clan remain, we can never truly gain control of our clans. She tried to persuade the Xing Clan. Unfortunately, they refused to listen. So, in order to avoid getting stuck between her clan and you, she gave up her right to become the next patriarch.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “The Xing Clan didn’t make things difficult for her, right?”

Ye Zhibei shook her head, “No. But now that she’s out of the clan’s core, it actually may be a good thing for her. After all, she doesn’t really care about being the patriarch.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “What about you? What do you plan to do now?”

Yang Ye replied softly, “I plan to resolve some things.”

Ye Zhibei glanced at him and remained silent.

Around an hour later, Yang Ye bid farewell to her and went to War City.

As soon as he entered the city, a woman appeared before him.

It was Lady Liu Yuan of the War Dimension.

She’d repulsed the Soul Exalt with ease that day!

Liu Yuan glanced at Yang Ye, “I told you that both you and the Soul Sect aren’t welcome here.”

Yang Ye said, “I’m not here to cause trouble.”

Liu Yuan shook her head, “No, you still must leave.”

Yang Ye raised a finger, “10 minutes, I’ll leave after that. Alright?”

She glanced at him and left.

Yang Ye entered the city and went to the underground trade area. He met the mysterious expert in that dark house.

The mysterious expert asked, “May I know why you’re here this time, Sect Master Ye?”

Yang Ye replied, “I want the location of all the Soul Sect’s secret bases. Or I should say I want to know where their main base is. I want the exact location!”

Silence filled the house.

A long time passed before the mysterious expert said, “Can’t you just exercise a little forbearance?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “There are some things that I must do.”

The mysterious expert said, “If you go too far, you may suffer the attacks of some people.”

Yang Ye smiled, “They will attack sooner or later. Moreover, if I don’t do anything now, they will act even sooner.”

He was certain that Eternal Kingdom was aware of what Qi Bitian had done in that world.

He planned to rely on the deterrence that was created to accomplish some things!

He wouldn’t have another chance like this!

Yang Ye wasn’t trying to rely on Qi Bitian. But a person should know how to act according to the situation and use everything available to him.

Only a fool wouldn’t take advantage of such an opportunity!

Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye left War City.

On the city walls, Liu Yuan watched Yang Ye leave with an indifferent expression on her face.

There was an old man behind her. It was the old man who’d helped Yang Ye that day.

The old man shook his head slightly, “What a pity!”

Liu Yuan closed her eyes slowly. The War Dimension was always in need of formidable experts, and Yang Ye was undoubtedly the best choice. If Yang Ye remained in the War Dimension and received their fostering, he would definitely become the strongest warrior of Eternal Kingdom!

He was truly strong!

Especially now!

Even she wasn’t certain that she could defeat Yang Ye.

If the old man knew what she thought, he would definitely be absolutely shocked.

Because she was known as the strongest in the War Dimension.

She’d always been the strongest since she entered the War Dimension!

As for why they felt it was a pity, it was because War Dimension hadn’t just lost an extraordinary warrior, that warrior may become a powerful enemy of theirs.

The War Dimension protected Eternal Kingdom!

Presently, the battle between Eternal Kingdom and the Ancient Sword Sect could only be considered as internal strife, but no one could guarantee that Yang Ye would never become an enemy of the entire Eternal Kingdom!

A long time passed before Liu Yuan sighed softly and walked away.

Outside the city, Yang Ye looked up at the sky and seemed to have thought of something, causing a smile to curl up on his lips. A short moment later, he vanished on the spot.

…

At an unknown place.

People were coming and going on the streets.

A young girl with a ponytail stood by the street, and she was wearing a t-shirt with a floral design, skinny jeans, and pure white shoes.

There was a fluffy little fellow holding a rattle drum on her shoulder.

At this moment, they were staring into the distance. There were five people lined up there to withdraw money.

Meanwhile, the young girl suddenly pointed at a counter at the front of the line, “The paper comes from there. Right, the currency of theirs. The red paper, the red paper that can be used to buy many things.”

The fluffy little fellow blinked and nodded. Her crystals weren’t very useful here, and it was those red papers that were better!

Meanwhile, the young girl said, “I asked the other day. That wagon on four wheels required 900,000 of their currency. In other words, we need to get around 100,000 of it. Right, we don’t want the green paper because those will require double the amount. The red paper is more valuable.”

As she spoke, she tapped her foot down and stared at the counter, “Snowy, I have a bold idea. If it succeeds…”
