Chapter 1218 – Above The Emperor Realm!

Suddenly, a ray of blood red light flashed, and then a blood red sword stabbed into the center of the middle aged man’s forehead.

His eyes opened wide while his figure moved backwards repeatedly, and his eyes were filled with terror.

Yang Ye stood up slowly. He paid no attention to the middle aged man and gazed at Snowy instead. Yang Ye was moved by the sight of Snowy shivering in his arms. She’d been imprisoned by the Welkin Wolf King in the past, and it made her extremely timid. But even though she was extremely afraid, she hadn’t chosen to hide herself this time.

Yang Ye’s gaze grew even gentler when he thought up to this point. He rubbed her head gently and spoke in a gentle tone, “Don’t be afraid. No one can harm you while I’m here.”

Snowy raised her head slowly and gazed at him when she heard his voice. As soon as she saw him wide awake, her lips shivered before tears started streaming out of her eyes. At the same time that she started crying, the spirit energy in the surroundings instantly grew denser and denser!

Yang Ye stroked her face lightly and smiled, “Stop crying, you’ll look ugly if you keep crying!”

Snowy started crying even more.

Yang Ye was speechless.

After crying for a while, Snow suddenly recalled something. She turned around and glared at the middle aged man before waving her claws swiftly.

Yang Ye who was an expert in the tongue of beasts instantly discerned that she was complaining to him.

Yang Ye looked up at the middle aged man. While a sword was stabbed in the man’s head, the man still wasn’t dead. He was looking at Yang Ye. Besides terror, there was disbelief in the middle aged man’s eyes. Because besides a trace of blood that remained on the corner of Yang Ye’s mouth, there seemed to be no injuries on him.

As if he knew what the middle aged man was thinking, Yang Ye patted his chest lightly and said, “See that? The physical body of an Emperor Realm demon beast. It isn’t even a problem for this body of mine to take an Emperor Rank technique head-on.

As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, he waved his right hand, and the blood red sword instantly flew out of the middle aged man’s forehead and into his grasp. Once the sword was gone, a string of blood sprayed out like a fountain from the center of his forehead, and only a moment passed before the middle aged man’s eyes closed slowly.

At the moment his eyes closed completely, countless strands of spirit energy surged out from within him. Snowy didn’t hold back at all. She immediately opened her mouth and sucked, and all the spirit energy within the middle aged man instantly entered her mouth.

Yang Ye waved his hand and the spatial ring on the middle aged man’s hand flew into his grasp. But he immediately frowned upon checking its contents. Because there weren’t even 5,000 violet crystals within the spatial ring. There was a huge number of miscellaneous items, but besides the folding fan, he wasn’t interested in those miscellaneous items at all.

As the leader of a cult, you’re actually so poor. Tsk, tsk.... Yang Ye shook his head and gazed at the folding fan. Suddenly, a beam of white light surged out from within it and shot towards Yang Ye. However, it had only just appeared before it was instantly shattered by Yang Ye’s sword intent.

“You really do possess intelligence of your own!” Yang Ye sized it up. At this moment, it was shivering because it was being suppressed by Yang Ye’s Rebirth Rank sword intent.

The folding fan was completely jade white. When Yang Ye looked carefully at it, he noticed that the frame of the fan was made by the bones of an unknown beast. Besides that, the fan itself wasn’t made of paper, it was made of soft leather. It was extremely soft and smooth like the skin of a baby.

There were strange symbols inscribed on both sides of the fan, and when Yang Ye’s profound energy surged into the fan, the symbols instantly emanated a dazzling beam of light that shot up into the sky!

As he gazed at the beam of light that shot up into the sky, a grin curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “Not bad!”

Yang Ye placed the folding fan in his spatial ring, flipped his palm, and the blood red shield appeared there. It was naturally the shield he’d obtained from the Head Snatcher. Yang Ye was extremely surprised by the ability of the shield because it had blocked off his ultimate version of Death by a Thought and Heavenrend. Moreover, it had done it in succession!

As soon as the blood red shield appeared, the smell of blood assaulted Yang Ye’s face. However, it was nothing to Yang Ye.

The shield was circular, completely blood red like Heaven’s Gravestone, and it seemed like it was forged from blood. There was a handle at the inner side of the shield, and it was just nice for it to be held with one hand. Besides that, there wasn’t anything special on the shield. However, Yang Ye knew that while the shield and fan were Emperor Rank treasures, the shield was definitely superior to the fan.

Yang Ye pondered deeply for an instant before he flicked a drop of blood into it. In an instant, the shield seemed like it had come to life. Suddenly, a blood red ray of light erupted from it, and then a thin blood red barrier of light covered the shield. As for the shield beneath the barrier, it was like an ocean of blood. Blood was surging within it, and it was a shocking sight to behold.

“Not bad! Not bad indeed!” A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth. The shield was extremely suitable to him. With the shield combined with the physical defenses he possessed, he could practically become immune to the attacks of Emperors.

Yang Ye put the shield away, gazed at Snowy, and smiled, “Violet crystals!” He’d kill 7 Emperors earlier. In other words, she’d definitely produced 70,000 violet crystals!

70,000! How many experts could those create? Unfortunately, Jian Xu and the others had killed many Emperors, but Snowy hadn’t been able to absorb those. Because the situation had been too chaotic, so he didn’t dare let her leave his side.

Snowy blinked when she heard him, and then she started waving her claw swiftly. In next to no time, numerous violet crystals appeared in front of Yang Ye. It didn’t take long for them to pile up into a small mountain. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Yang Ye roared with laughter as he gazed at the violet crystals. After that, he took Snowy in his arms and kissed her. Snowy’s face instantly flushed red, but she didn’t hide herself this time. She learned from Yang Ye’s example and wrapped her arms around his face before kissing him on the nose.

Yang Ye roared with laughter once more. He waved his right hand and put the violet crystals away, and then his figure shot towards Doomsday City while holding Snowy in his arms.

...

Doomsday City.

At this moment, Jian Xu and the others were looking up at the sky. They were waiting, waiting for Yang Ye! It wasn’t just them, everyone else throughout Doomsday City was doing the same.

Even though the battle had ended with a huge victory for the Sword Alliance. However, if Yang Ye didn’t return, then the huge victory was just momentary, and the entire Sword Alliance would split apart in an instant.

The Sword Alliance was formed from many forces like mercenaries, sword cultivators, independent cultivators, and the past members of the Sword God’s Palace. All of them had joined the Sword Alliance for a single person, Yang Ye. If Yang Ye was gone and someone else took his position as Sword Master, then would they acknowledge that person?

Did anyone but Yang Ye possess the ability to assume the position of Sword Master?

Finally, a ray of light appeared in the sky.

Everyone throughout Doomsday City seethed with excitement at the sight of it, and countless cheered in unison. Their voices surged through the clouds. Meanwhile, Jian Xu and the others heaved sighs of relief as well because Yang Ye’s return represented that the Sword Alliance had truly won!

At the moment Dugu Tianwei saw Yang Ye, the worry in his heart was instantly relieved. It was his wife who’d decided that Violet Thistle City should work together with the Sword Alliance, and he’d been slightly against it. Because the Sword Alliance seemed to have no chance to win, no matter what. However, he’d chosen to listen to his wife in the end.

Because his wife could see much farther than him and was more discerning. The facts proved that it was true.

Choosing the Sword Alliance was a huge gamble for Violet Thistle City. If they won, its status would rise sharply; if it lost, then it would cease to exist. Now, it won the gamble.

...

Doomsday City, the Sword Master Hall.

Yang Ye sat at the seat of the host while Jian Xu, Ye Liuyun, and the others were seated below him.

Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto Dugu Tianwei, “How many Emperors did Violet Thistle City lose?”

Dugu Tianwei pondered deeply for a moment and said, “2.”

2! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. Violet Thistle City had only 5 Emperors, yet it had lost 2 in a single battle. Needless to say, it was a huge loss.

As for the Sword Alliance, even though it had lost almost 10 Emperors, they were all puppets. There was a gap between the strengths of puppets and actual Emperors. After all, puppets were just puppets in the end, and they were naturally incomparable to real people.

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a short moment and said, “City Governor Dugu, I, Yang Ye, will remember your Violet Thistle City’s help.” As he spoke, he flicked a spatial ring over to Dugu Tianwei, “There are 10,000 violet crystals in there. Consider it a small token of my appreciation.”

Dugu Tianwei hesitated for a moment and said, “I’ll decline the violet crystals, but I have a request. I hope that Sword Master will agree.”

“Go ahead!” Yang Ye smiled, “Right, I’m brothers with Dugu Jian, so just call me Yang Ye.”

Dugu Tianwei glanced at Yang Ye, and then he nodded, “Frostwind City, Dark Sky Sect, and the Darkwater Sect have been rendered powerless, and my Violet Thistle City wants to take over the Dark Sky Sect. Of course, just forget it if you have other plans. I hope that this doesn’t affect the friendship between our Violet Thistle City and the Sword Alliance!”

Ye Liuyun frowned slightly. The Dark Sky Sect was a Diamond Rank power, so it had a Divine Grade spirit vein and countless other resources. Even though Violet Thistle City had really helped the Sword Alliance, such a request was a little too much. Because if Violet Thistle City were to fight the Dark Sky Sect on its own, then even if it won, it would have been a pyrrhic victory. Yet now, Yang Ye had killed all the Emperors of the Dark Sky Sect, so they just had to stretch out their hand and take the Dark Sky Sect!”

Ye Liuyun was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly smiled, “Alright! If you encounter any problems when taking over the Dark Sky Sect, just say the word and my Sword Alliance will lend you a hand!”

Ye Liuyun glanced at Yang Ye when she heard him, but she didn’t say anything.

Dugu Tianwei glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Thank you!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he gazed at Dugu Tianwei, “City Governor Dugu, do you know where the World Devastator Cult’s headquarters are?”

Dugu Tianwei asked, “You intend to destroy it?”

“Of course!” Yang Ye continued, “One must always pull weeds out by the roots!”

“Pull weeds out by the roots, huh?” Suddenly, a voice resounded in the sky above the city, “You don’t have to go through all that trouble. I’ve come myself.”

As soon as the voice resounded, a wave of pressure suddenly appeared in the hall. At this moment, all the Emperors here couldn’t move. As for the Quasi Emperors, they were pressed flat on the ground and were shivering incessantly.

The expressions of everyone here had instantly changed drastically!

“An expert at the Voider Realm.... The World Devastator Cult has an expert at the Voider Realm....” Dugu Tianwei’s eyes were filled with despair.
