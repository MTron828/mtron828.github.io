Chapter 999 – So, You’re So Weak!

He’d killed Qing Daofu with a single swing of his sword!

When did Yang Ye become that strong?

Qing Daofu is one of the 5 top geniuses of our prefecture! He’s a supreme expert of the younger generation who’s only inferior to Saints!However, it was exactly such a supreme expert who had been killed in an instant!

Is Yang Ye a Saint?

Everyone here was beyond shocked!

At this moment, Welkin Wolf Demon King had an extremely solemn expression on his face. Qing Daofu was weaker than Yang Ye, and that was definite. But it was absolutely not weaker to the point that he couldn’t fight back when facing Yang Ye. But it didn’t take long for him to come to an understanding once his gaze descended upon the yellow sword in Yang Ye’s grasp and the black cape Yang Ye wore. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The sword was at the Divine Rank, and so was the cape!

He’s relying on treasures! Welkin Wolf Demon King’s heart eased up slightly when he realized this. He would truly be afraid if Yang Ye had attained the Saint Realm. After all, once a genius like Yang Ye attained the Saint Realm, then his strength would be absolutely terrifying. Fortunately, Yang Ye wasn’t a Saint yet, and he was only relying on equipment to improve his strength!

Welkin Wolf Demon King didn’t do anything. He just gazed at Yang Ye with a mocking expression on his face.

The man from the Central Divine Prefecture was looking for Yang Ye, and it was obvious that the man had come here with ill intent. Besides that, conflict had arisen between Yang Ye and the Dao Order. So, Yang Ye could be said to have offended 2 Saints. If he was included, then it would be 3. Thus, he wanted to see who could save Yang Ye now!

“Yang Ye!” Zhu Yuan pointed a finger at Yang Ye and roared furiously, “Do you think I wouldn’t dare to kill you?”

Yang Ye laughed coldly, “You can try, you old bastard!”

“Then I will!” Zhu Yuan roared furiously and was about to attack, but Yang Ye waved his right hand, and a black robed man appeared by Yang Ye’s side.

Zhu Yuan’s pupils constricted slightly when he saw the black robed man! Welkin Wolf Demon King’s face changed as well.

Because the man was a Saint!

Because Yang Ye had utilized his Sword Domain to conceal the Death Energy within Li Yun’s body, so they weren’t able to discern that Li Yun was a puppet, and he was even a puppet made from an inferior Saint.

Yang Ye glanced at Welkin Wolf Demon King and Zhu Yuan, “Did you really think I would be foolish enough to come back here on my own? Allow me to tell you that the Bear King has agreed to lend us a hand, and the army of the Bear Clan will be here soon!”

“What nonsense!” Welkin Wolf Demon King roared with fury, “I’ve received news that the Bear Clan will absolutely not interfere in the matters here. That Saint by your side is definitely not from the Bear Clan.”

Meanwhile, the man in embroidered clothes spoke abruptly, “That’s a puppet!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly when he heard this, and then he gazed at the man in embroidered clothes. He hadn’t expected the man would have actually seen through his Sword Servant. But it didn’t take long for Yang Ye’s gaze to descend onto the black dragon.

A dragon? Yang Ye’s eyes drooped. He had the blood of the Dragon Ancestor, and it could counter and suppress all dragons that were weaker than the Dragon Ancestor. However, he wondered if he could do the same to the black dragon when it was at the Saint Realm!

“A puppet?” Welkin Wolf Demon King and Zhu Yuan were shocked when they heard the man. They naturally knew about puppets, but they’d never heard of anyone in this world who was capable of refining Saints into puppets! Both of them didn’t quite believe it, but they dared no refute the man. After all, they didn’t want to offend him!

“Yes, it is a puppet!” Yang Ye suddenly said, “It’s a Saint Realm puppet that I obtained. Zhu Yuan, Welkin Wolf Demon King, didn’t the two of you want to kill me? Feel free to try. Allow me to warn you that I’ll make this Saint Realm puppet disregard its safety and fight the person who launches the first attack. If it can’t defeat you, I’ll make it detonate itself and take you down with it!”

“Yang Ye, do you think that we would allow ourselves to be threatened by that?” Zhu Yuan spoke fiercely, “Let me tell you something. My Dao Order will never rest until it destroys you and the Ancient Sword School to avenge Qing Daofu. Everyone from the Dao Order heed my command. Attack and kill the disciples of the Ancient Sword School with all your strength!”

“Don’t you dare move a muscle!” Yang Ye suddenly roared as he gazed at the members of the Dao Order and spoke fiercely, “Disciples of the Dao Order, I, Yang Ye, am not an ungrateful person. I owe your founding ancestor, and I don’t want to repay his kindness with enmity. I killed Qing Daofu because he acted against me. I’m not an ungrateful person, but I’m not one to stubbornly try to avoid repaying kindness with enmity. If you dare to attack, then none of you can hope of leaving the city with your lives!”

The disciples of the Dao Order revealed grim expressions when they heard him, and they looked at him with fearful fazes. They’d witnessed Yang Ye’s ruthless character a long time ago, and they were sure that he would definitely do as he said if they dared to attack first!

“Welkin Wolf King, what do you think about joining forces to kill that kid?” Suddenly, Zhu Yuan gazed at Welkin Wolf Demon King. Yang Ye had killed Qing Daofu, and it was something that the Dao Order absolutely couldn’t tolerate, so it had to take revenge no matter the cost!

Welkin Wolf Demon King glanced at the man in embroidered clothes, and once he determined that the man wasn’t against it, he hesitated for a moment before he nodded, “Alright!”

“Two against one?” Yang Ye Laughed coldly, and then he shouted, “Qing!”

As soon as he spoke, an explosion resounded from a mountain in the distance, and then a ray of green light shot over in his direction. It arrived by Yang Ye’s side in the blink of an eye. The light dispersed, and a woman in a green dress appeared before everyone.

Another Saint!

Welkin Wolf Demon King and Zhu Yuan’s faces changed. They hadn’t expected that another Saint would appear here! Where did that fellow find 2 Saints?

It was naturally Qing!

Yang Ye had started trying to contact her once he started rushing back to the city, and he was pleasantly surprised to find out that Qing had attained the Saint Realm. That made him even more confident in his chances at victory!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye glanced at Zhu Yuan and Welkin Wolf Demon King, “Come, either both of you or I will die today!”

“That’s enough!” Suddenly, the man in embroidered clothes spoke, “The Patriarch asked me to be absolutely careful before I came here, and he said that I should absolutely not underestimate you. I thought that you, Yang Ye, would be a proud genius. But now that I’ve met you, I’m disappointed. You, Yang Ye, are just a clown who relies on Divine Rank treasures and others!”

Yang Ye gazed at the man, “Who are you?”

“You don’t have the right to know!” The man continued, “I don’t want to continue wasting time. Will you come with me on your own accord, or should I break your limbs and take you by force?”

Yang Ye’s figure rose up slowly into the air, and he arrived before the man and the dragon. He glanced at the dragon, and then he gazed at the man, “If your confidence comes from that dragon below you, then I can only say that you might be disappointed.”

The man gazed at Yang Ye for a short while, and then he tapped his right leg lightly against the dragon, “Don’t go too hard on him. Keep him alive!”

Roar!

The dragon raised its head and roared with fury, and then it blasted a wave of Dragon pressure at Yang Ye. The powerful Dragon Pressure was comparable to the might of the heavens and the earth, and it caused countless demon beasts in the surroundings to lay flat on the ground and shiver. Besides that, some humans were even unable to endure such pressure, and they laid flat on the ground and shivered just like the demon beasts did!

Yang Ye didn’t try to resist it and just allowed it to arrive before it, and then everyone watched with astonishment as he remained completely unharmed after it slammed against him!

Zhu Yuan and Welkin Wolf Demon King’s pupils constricted slightly upon witnessing this scene. They hadn’t expected that Yang Ye could actually disregard such Dragon Pressure. After all, even they couldn’t do that!

Suddenly, Zhu Yuan’s expression changed as he recalled something. Yang Ye had said that he was the Scion of the Dragons when he went to the Dao Order that time. At that time, Zhu Yuan was certain that Yang Ye was talking nonsense, but when he saw that Yang Ye was actually immune to the Dragon Pressure of a Saint Realm dragon, he had no choice but to believe it!

At this moment, the dragon and the man’s eyes carried bewilderment as well. It was especially so for the dragon. Its Dragon Pressure was something that even Saints dare not disregard, but Yang Ye hadn’t just disregarded it, he was completely unaffected!

The black dragon spoke in a deep voice, “Human! How did you do that!?”

Yang Ye took a deep breath while a mysterious smile curled up on the corners of his mouth. He’d thought that the Dragon Ancestor’s blood would lose its efficacy before Saint Realm dragons, but he hadn’t imagined that it would still be effective! In other words, the strength and bloodline of the Dragon Ancestor on Profound Continent surpassed this black dragon!

Yang Ye didn’t speak. He just transformed into a ray of light which vanished on the spot. At the same time, the expression of the man who stood on the dragon changed. He waved his right hand forward, and a ray of black light swept out.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and a figure was blasted flying.

A wisp of disdain curled up on the corners of the man’s mouth as he said, “So, you’re so weak. You....” When he spoke up to this point, his eyes suddenly opened wide, and there was horror within them. He was just about to flee from where he stood, but it was too late. A dagger had been stabbed against his nape, but it didn’t go deep and only entered a few centimeters into his neck. Even then, the man didn’t dare move at all!

“So, you’re so weak!” Yang Ye’s voice resounded in the man’s ears.

The man gazed at the figure he’d blasted into the distance, and he instantly came to an understanding. Because that wasn’t Yang Ye at all. He’d been tricked!

Welkin Wolf Demon King and Zhu Yuan revealed solemn expressions because Yang Ye’s attack was truly too swift and mysterious. Even they had only been barely able to capture Yang Ye’s movements just now!

It could be said that Yang Ye’s speed had surpassed many Saints!

“Human! You’ll definitely die a graveless death if you dare to harm the Young Master!” The dragon roared furiously, but he didn’t dare act rashly because Yang Ye had the man’s fate in his hands.

Yang Ye paid no attention to the dragon. He just exerted a little force and stabbed the dagger a little deeper into the man’s nape, and then he said, “Now, do I have the right to know who you are?”

The man’s face turned livid. He was just about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly shook his head, “Forget it. I’m not interested in that anymore!”

Hiss!

Yang Ye suddenly flicked the dagger upwards, and the man’s head was instantly sliced into two!
