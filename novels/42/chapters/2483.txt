Chapter 2484 – Developing the Sword Domain!

The woman’s face gradually became solemn.

She hesitated for a moment and asked, “Who are you?”

She was no fool. The man before her seemed so composed, so it was obvious that he wasn’t anyone ordinary. He was either an extraordinary expert who was keeping his strength concealed or possessed powerful backing.

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m just an ordinary sword cultivator.”

An ordinary sword cultivator?

She glanced at him and clearly didn’t believe it.

Yang Ye glanced at them and asked, “So, are you going to go on with this?”

The woman hesitated for a moment and waved her right hand. It only took a moment for everything to return to normal. Yang Ye was at the inn again, but the old man had been switched for the beautiful woman.

She glanced at Yang Ye and said, “That was a misunderstanding! Please don’t take it to heart, Young Master!”

She couldn’t see through him!

Since she couldn’t see through him, she couldn’t act against him.

Always be careful!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, “Is this a shady place?”

She had quite an awkward expression on her face. Can you not be so direct?

Yang Ye grinned, “I have a question. When will the Ancient Sword Sect be recruiting in the city?”

She asked, “You want to join them?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’m a sword cultivator!”

She asked, “Your cultivation?”

“The True Void Realm!” Yang Ye replied. He had suppressed his cultivation with the help of the Primordial Pagoda, so even a Five World Realm expert couldn’t discern his true cultivation. As for experts above that, he wasn’t certain.

The woman nodded slightly, “Your cultivation is enough, but what about your Sword Dao?”

Yang Ye was stunned and asked, “Is the Sword Dao divided into levels too?”

She replied, “Sword intent, is your sword intent at the True Void Realm?”

Yang Ye nodded, “It is.”

The strength he revealed right now was the True Void Realm in both cultivation and sword intent, but his sword intent was always at the True Void Realm! Of course, it should actually be at the True World Realm because he’d even suppressed his sword intent that day.

She glanced at him and said, “You should be able to join them. However, it only recruits five people every year, and at least four are monopolized by the clans in the city. In other words, there is only one opportunity left.”

One spot!

Yang Ye said, “Can I buy one too?” Yang Ye had no lack of money!

The huge amount of wealth Snowy left behind was something that would take a lifetime to waste!

Just think about it, how much was a Chaotic Fruit worth? He had 10 of them! And he even had the Worldborn Fruits that were better than that!

Yang Ye was as rich as an entire country!

She sized up Yang Ye and asked, “Do you have many Divine Crystals?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I have a few. If it’s possible, I don’t mind buying my way in. I only wonder how many are required!”

She thought for a moment and raised a finger.

Yang Ye asked, “10,000?”

Her face stiffened, “Do you think those are rocks? 10,000? It’s 100, just 100 is enough! 100 are equivalent to a World Crystal, and they are impossible to trade for! A single World Crystal can recover a Limitbreaker Realm expert’s profound energy in an instant, and it can help them advance too. So, if you have a World Crystal, then it won’t be a problem at all!”

World Crystals!

Yang Ye scanned the Primordial Pagoda, and he noticed over 70 of them. He knew they would last for a long time.

She suddenly asked, “Do you have it?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I have over 100 Divine Crystals.”

She nodded, “So, how about you stay here for now. According to my knowledge, it’ll take over a month before they will come. At that time, I’ll contact you. We have some connections, so we can contact an Outer Court Elder of the Ancient Sword Sect. However, it will require giving out some bribes, and…”

Yang Ye was no fool. He naturally understood what she meant and smiled, “Will 10 be enough?”

She cracked a smile, “Of course!”

Yang Ye wasn’t worried she would cheat him and flicked 10 Divine Crystals to her.

The woman was quite surprised. She hadn’t expected Yang Ye to be so generous and decisive!

She didn’t think too much about it and just took the crystals.

Yang Ye said, “I’m going to get some rest. I’ll be waiting for you to give me the news!”

She smiled, “Of course!”

Yang Ye nodded and went to his room.

Once he left, an old man appeared before the woman. It was the manager from before.

She waved her right hand, and the space here trembled before a thin barrier of light locked down their position.

Even the wind couldn’t get in!

She glanced at the direction Yang Ye had left toward, and once she was certain he’d gone to his room, she asked, “Have you found out?”

He shook his head, “I couldn’t. All I know is he came from outside the city!”

“Outside the city!” Her eyes narrowed slightly, “He isn’t from the West Region!”

The old man nodded, “He probably isn’t. Otherwise, our network would have definitely been able to find out about him! However, he’s absolutely not ordinary. Manager Yun, should…”

The old man didn’t continue.

The woman fell silent for a long time. Suddenly, a small black demon beast appeared on her shoulder.

A Treasure Seeking Mouse!

She hadn’t acted against Yang Ye because of a few Divine Crystals, it was actually because the mouse had sensed the aura of treasures coming from Yang Ye!

She gazed at it and spoke seriously, “A Divine Treasure?”

It nodded and sent ripples at her.

A long time passed before her eyes narrowed slightly, “Even better than Divine Treasures? And many of them too?”

The mouse nodded while seeming to be quite excited. If it hadn’t sensed danger from Yang Ye, it would have charged at him by now.

She fell silent for a short while and said, “We may not be able to deal with him on our own. It’s quite risky, so we have to get some people to work with us!”

The old man nodded, “Indeed, he’s definitely not ordinary!”

The woman grinned, “Only the brave ever accomplish things. If worse comes to worse, we’ll just start over once we’re done with him and go into hiding!”

She waved her right hand, the barrier vanished, and she walked out of the inn.

…

In the room, Yang Ye sat cross-legged and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye went below the mass of lightning, and he saw the demon beasts charging at it incessantly.

It didn’t try to kill them, otherwise, if over 100 bolts of divine lightning descended, even Erya would be killed by them. Of course, Yang Ye wasn’t certain if they could kill Erya.

After all, he didn’t know the limits of her body!

No one knew where her limits were!

All of them were being diligent, and they’d grown even more hardworking in Erya’ absence. Erya had gone to have fun, but they were training, because they wanted to surprise her when they met again!

Yang Ye smiled and left.

He went to the cultivation room.

The Sword Domain!

Yang Ye planned to study the Sword Domain. Or to be more precise, he wanted to develop even more aspects of it and not use it solely for attacking people with the sword!

Yang Ye sat down cross-legged and activated the Sword Domain. In an instant, the entire room was covered beneath the Sword Domain.

In the cultivation room, Yang Ye’s senses were extremely sensitive, or it should be said that he’d merged into one with space! Or it could be descended as him having transcended the space here and arriving at a different space!

A different space!

Yang Ye’s eyes suddenly lit up!

He still remembered what the Desolate Emperor had told him. There were many types of space, so what type of space was he in right now?

Four-Dimensional Space?

That was clearly impossible. Even an expert like the Desolate Emperor was barely able to sense its existence, so how could he possibly enter it?

If it wasn’t Four-Dimensional Space, then what was it?

What could it do?

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a long time. Suddenly he stood up and left the pagoda. He arrived below the lightning, and then he expanded the Sword Domain and enveloped the Primal True Dragon.

The dragon immediately stopped when the Sword Domain enveloped it, and it gazed at Yang Ye with a questioning gaze.

Yang Ye stared at the dragon, and it made a chill run down its spine.

The demons were extremely respectful toward Yang Ye. Firstly, even Erya and Snowy feared Yang Ye, so they naturally feared him too. As for the most important reason, Yang Ye was very strong, even stronger than them! Moreover, his temper was very bad, so bad that even Erya had to be good when he went berserk.

Suddenly, Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly.

Sensing!

Yang Ye sent out his divine sense to sense everything about the dragon. At this moment, the dragon was completely revealed before him!

The dragon was quite anxious!

Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “Attack me!”

The dragon was stunned.

Yang Ye said, “Hurry up!”

The dragon hesitated and shook its head. It didn’t really dare to attack Yang Ye!

Yang Ye continued, “I’m training, so just attack me. Otherwise, I’ll tell Erya you cursed her behind her back. Right, and I’ll eat the Chaotic Fruits and say you did it!”

The dragon was furious. It glared at Yang Ye and howled inwardly.

How can you be so shameless?!Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

It didn’t dare to imagine the consequences of that…
