Chapter 1851 – A Monkey From The Large Universe!

Many were looking for him!

At this moment, Yang Ye’s face was naturally quite unsightly. After all, trouble kept arriving in waves. He hadn’t even dealt with the Night Emperor, but someone from the upper universe had arrived, and that person was here to kill him.

Actually, he’d thought about returning the wooden sword just now. It wasn’t because he was afraid of the Sovereign of Man, and it was because the wooden sword had a mind of its own. It still hadn’t acknowledged him as its master, so it clearly treated the Sovereign of Man as its master.

However, he hadn’t expected the armored man to want more than the wooden sword, the armored man wanted his life!

So, he would naturally not hand it over!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at Dark, “Who’s that influential figure you mentioned?”

Dark shook his head, “That person requested secrecy, so I can’t expose that person’s identity. It’s a rule of my organization. In short, you must be careful from now on.”

Yang Ye chuckled, he finally understood what the woman in a red dress from Moment Mountain meant.

Karma!

The problems the wooden sword brought him were simply endless! However, no matter what, he wouldn’t hand it over unless the wooden sword wanted to leave.

Bang!

Suddenly, the entire mountain shook violently.

Yang Ye gazed at Dark, and Dark gazed at the blue passageway in midair, “Someone is tearing through the chaotic flow of space!”

Yang Ye asked, “Someone is descending?”

Dark nodded, “The last one merely made Heaven Pillar Mountain tremble, but the commotion now is too huge. If I’m not wrong, that person will be here by tomorrow. I only wonder which figure from the upper universe is descending!”

Yang Ye replied, “No matter who it is, the people here won’t give up on it, right?”

Dark replied, “There are no Imperial Rank treasures in our world, or I should say that there are very few. The Imperial Rank treasures you see here were mostly seized from the people who descended from the large universe. The true reason why everyone is seizing these treasures is because we hope to add a few more safeguards when trying to get through the barrier.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Take good care of that sword. It’ll definitely be very helpful to you when you try to go up in the future.”

Yang Ye nodded. He didn’t intend to hand over the wooden sword now. As for those people who were looking for him, so long as Heaven’s Net didn’t reveal his location, then it would take time for them to locate him.

After that, Yang Ye and Dark found a place to hide.

Wait!

Just like many other experts who were hiding in the shadows, they were waiting. They were waiting for that person to descend.

Heaven Pillar Mountain was trembling more and more rapidly.

Yang Ye entered the Primordial Pagoda. As soon as he did, he was stunned because the spirit energy in the 1st level was extremely dense, and it was so dense that it was more abundant than air here!

Snowy!

Snowy immediately came to mind. It didn’t take long for him to find her. Snowy was standing on the wooden sword and vomiting spirit energy.

Hou Qing and Qiong Qi were standing close by, and they were staring at her.

Yang Ye asked, “What is she doing?”

Hou Qing glanced at Yang Ye and said, “That little fellow swallowed the Spirit Energy Pearl, and then it was too much for her. She held it in for some time, and then she started vomiting. She has been vomiting for a long time!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

A short while passed before he asked, “How long will that go on?”

Qiong Qi shook his head, “I don’t know. However, it’s a good thing. If the spirit energy here becomes dense, it’ll speed up this pagoda’s recovery. Or perhaps, the speed it gets unsealed will increase. I believe it won’t take long before you can enter the next level.”

The next level! Yang Ye looked up. The 4th level held the Wargod’s arm, so what did the 5th level keep?

He was quite curious, and he felt a little anticipation!

A short while passed, and then Yang Ye paid no further attention to Snowy and left.

There was a huge rock by the sea, and a man and woman were seated on it. The man wore green clothes while the woman wore a violet dress.

The man was Yang Ye, of course. As for the woman, it was Zi’er.

Zi’er laid on Yang Ye’s shoulder while looking at the sea, “I miss Profound Continent a little!”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “What do you miss about it?”

She turned to look at Yang Ye and smiled mischievously, “I miss the weak you. At that time, you frequently needed my help.” The smile on her face suddenly vanished at this point, and a slightly desolate expression appeared on her face, “Unlike now. I can’t help you at all!”

Yang Ye stretched out his hand and rubbed her head while he spoke softly, “You protected me in the past, now it’s my turn to protect you. Isn’t that good?”

She glanced at him without saying a word, and she just silently rested against his shoulder. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Around four hours later, Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda.

As soon as he left, Little Sky and a woman appeared by Zi’er’s side.

Zi’er gazed at the boundless ocean and spoke softly, “Big Sister Little Sky, I agree to that request.”

Little Sky shook her head, “No! I’m going to tell him!”

Zi’er turned to look at Little Sky, “Big Sister Little Sky, do you know how it feels? How it feels to only be able to watch as the person you love fights on his own?”

Little Sky fell silent.

Zi’er turned to look at the distant sea, “I don’t want to become a piece of beautiful decoration by his side… I want to be a firework. Even if it’s just a moment of brilliance, I want to shine brightly for him, and I’m willing to pay any price for that!”

Little Sky shook her head, “Both of you… Sigh….”

…

Once he returned to the outside world, the entire Heaven Pillar Mountain started shaking violently again.

Meanwhile, Dark appeared by his side. Dark glanced at Yang Ye and said, “That person is probably about to arrive!”

Yang Ye looked up at the blue passageway. He was quite curious. Who’s coming down here now?

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Why do the people up there keep coming down here?”

Dark replied, “In the beginning, we were very puzzled as well. But as time passed, we gained a piece of information. Many of them were coming down here because they seemed to be looking for something!”

They’re looking for something? Yang Ye was stunned, and then a strange expression appeared on his face. Are those fellows here for the Primordial Pagoda? It does make sense because it’s the number one treasure of the human race even in the large universe, so many should want to obtain it!

Meanwhile, Dark added, “Of course, most of them descended here because they were being pursued in the upper universe or offended someone they couldn’t afford to offend, so they fled down here. Besides that, there are a bunch of other reasons as well. However, all of that isn’t important. The most important thing is that their arrival increases our chances, it increases our chances to get to the large universe!”

Yang Ye shook his head. Under normal circumstances, it would be those in the upper universe that bullied those in the lower universe. Yet now, it was the people of the lower universe who were robbing the people in the upper universe.

Suddenly, the quaking stopped abruptly.

Dark spoke in a low voice, “That person has finished tearing through space… Be careful. He’ll definitely be difficult to take down!”

Yang Ye nodded. Needless to say, he was quite excited right now. Even though it wasn’t the first time he was taking the initiative to rob someone, it was the first time he was doing it with so many people!

No matter who it was, a person would definitely be nervous the first time!

Suddenly, a concealed yet powerful aura flashed by.

Yang Ye and Dark’s expression changed because while that aura had merely flashed past, it had instantly made them feel a heavy wave of pressure!

Yang Ye asked, “One of the four Heavenly Exalts?

Dark shook his head slightly, “Probably not. They won’t come here unless the circumstances are special. Because as far as they are concerned, what we plunder are their leftovers.”

Their leftovers!

Yang Ye was speechless.

Meanwhile, Dark spoke solemnly, “It might be one of the five Emperors!”

Yang Ye gazed at Dark, “Who’s stronger between the Night Emperor and you!”

“If it’s a battle in the open, then he can kill me within 100 moves!” Dark continued, “If I play tricks, then I have a 50% chance at killing him. Of course, I might get killed by him instead!”

Yang Ye’s heart sank. He’d fought the Night Emperor that day, but he didn’t have a clear idea of the Night Emperor’s strength. Now, it seemed like the Night Emperor was much stronger than he’d imagined!

Meanwhile, Dark said, “It’s fine. Even though you’re no match for him right now, you’ll definitely be able to defeat him in the future.”

Yang Ye was about to speak when the blue passageway suddenly started shaking violently.

Dark spoke in a low voice, “He’s here!”

At this moment, all the experts hiding in the shadows looked up at the blue passageway.

Yang Ye looked up at the blue passageway. Who is it?

Time trickled by. Finally, the passageway’s trembling increased in frequency.

Around 15 minutes later…

Boom!

An extremely powerful aura suddenly surged out, and then the expressions of everyone here changed.

Even Yang Ye and Dark’s expressions had changed!

Because as soon as the aura appeared, it had actually almost pressed him to his knees!

How strong! At this moment, Yang Ye had given up on trying to steal from this expert. This expert was absolutely not ordinary, and he would be courting death by trying to steal from such an expert!

Suddenly, a ray of flaming light flashed out from the passageway, but it didn’t leave and stopped on the spot.

At this moment, everyone saw it clearly.

There was a completely red monkey within it, and the monkey’s eyes were actually two balls of flames!

The monkey’s body was covered in cracks, and the cracks were so deep that the monkey’s internal organs were clearly visible. Moreover, there was a golden palm print on the monkey’s chest. The palm print had caused the monkey’s chest to cave down, and it had severely warped the monkey’s chest.

The monkey was heavily injured!

That was the first thought which came to everyone’s minds.

It didn’t take long for three shadows to charge towards the monkey.

All three of them emanated extremely powerful auras that weren’t inferior to Dark. Obviously, they were Quasi Enlightened Realm experts, and they had clearly joined forces!

Suddenly, the monkey looked up at them, and then a golden rod appeared in the monkey’s grasp…
