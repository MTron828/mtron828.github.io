Chapter 1946 – Evil Spirit Race!

Yang Ye glanced at the monkey and said, “Brother Monkey, the sky race seems to be very formidable!”

The monkey shook his head slightly, “Not really. The god race and evil spirit race are formidable!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “The god race and evil spirit race?”

The monkey nodded, “Even the Dao Path, Buddhist Path, Weapon Path, and Confucianist Path dare not underestimate them!”

Yang Ye was about to ask about it when a man in a luxurious robe appeared in the sky above Sky City. The man seemed to be around the age of 30. He had his hands behind his back, and he had a refined aura.

The Sovereign of Sky!

The man was an extraordinary and renowned expert of the large universe, the Sovereign of Sky!

The Sovereign of Sky gazed at the monkey, “I didn’t expect you to be so lucky and actually avoid the Buddhist Path’s pursuit!”

The monkey shook his head slightly, “Sovereign of Sky, I’m not here to talk about such nonsense with you. This brother of mine wanted to see you, but your subordinates were proud and ignorant. Right, they looked down on everyone besides themselves. Sovereign of Sky, your sky race’s haughtiness should be fixed. Otherwise, it may suffer one day!”

The Sovereign of Sky replied, “You don’t have to worry about that. You should worry about yourself!”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “I know you. You’re here for Xiao Qi and the violet mink!”

Yang Ye looked fearlessly at the Sovereign of Sky in the eyes, “Yes!”

The Sovereign of Sky shook his head, “There’s too much trouble coiled around you. I don’t want Xiao Qi to have nothing to do with you.”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “Then give Zi’er back to me!”

The Sovereign of Sky asked, “Zi’er? That spatial mink?”

Yang Ye replied, “Yes!”

The Sovereign of Sky shook his head, “No!”

Yang Ye’s face fell, “Why?”

The Sovereign of Sky replied, “Xiao Qi’s soul is still in her body. So, she can’t leave the Sky Dimension until I find a suitable host for Xiao Qi!”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “A race as strong as the sky race can’t find a body for her?”

The Sovereign of Sky replied, “Her body is special!”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Meanwhile, the Sovereign of Sky said, “Human, Xiao Qi is the princess of my sky race. Not only is her physique special, her status is special too. She carries some hopes of my sky race. I don’t want her to stay with a human, especially a human who’s entangled with so much!”

Yang Ye looked the Sovereign of Sky in the eyes. He was about to speak when the Sovereign of Sky said, “You must realize that the only reason you’re still alive after coming to the Sky Dimension is that I promised her I wouldn’t kill you if she didn’t meet with you. However, my patience is limited. You must never return to the Sky Dimension, or I’ll kill you!”

Never return!

Yang Ye slowly clenched his fists, and then he suddenly started laughing.

The Sovereign of Sky asked, “What are you laughing about?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m laughing at why the sky race is so full of arrogance. It’s because their leader is the same! Sovereign of Sky, tell Xiao Qi something for me. Tell her that I misunderstood her, and I apologize. Besides that, tell her that I’ll be back!”

The Sovereign of Sky looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “The sky race doesn’t welcome you!”

Yang Ye’s smile gradually became gloomy, “When you see me again, I’ll make you take all of that back!”

The Sovereign of Sky’s eyes gradually became icy cold, “The weak should know their place. Or perhaps you think this monkey can really keep you alive in the sky race?”

The monkey flipped his palm, and his golden rod started trembling.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye shook his head and glanced at Sky City. He took a deep breath and shouted, “Sky race! I’ll be back!”

His voice reverberated like a thunderclap through the city!

Yang Ye turned around and vanished with the monkey.

The Sovereign of Sky stared in the direction Yang Ye and the monkey had vanished towards, and there was ghastly cold killing intent in his eyes. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Suddenly, a voice came from behind the Sovereign of Sky, “Are you happy now, Father?”

The Sovereign of Sky closed his eyes slightly, “I did it for you! He’s entangled with too much trouble. If you get too close to him, you’ll suffer in the future.”

The woman replied, “But you didn’t have to do that!”

The Sovereign of Sky suddenly asked, “Do you really not know who has that pagoda?”

The woman fell silent for a moment and replied, “I told you that it had vanished when I woke up. Why?”

The Sovereign of Sky shook his head slightly, “It’s nothing. Just go rest!”

The woman didn’t say anything and just left.

Once she left, a black shadow appeared behind the Sovereign of Sky.

The Sovereign of Sky spoke indifferently, “Follow them. Kill him if you find an opportunity; if there are no opportunities, then create one. Many should be out to kill him!”

The black shadow trembled and vanished on the spot.

…

It didn’t take long for the monkey to bring Yang Ye out of the Sky Dimension and into the Shaman Dimension.

Yang Ye cupped his fist, “Thank you for everything, Brother Monkey.”

The monkey shook his head slightly, “You helped me in the past too!”

He glanced at the surroundings and said, “It’s safe now. It’s time for us to say goodbye!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly. He was about to speak when the monkey said, “I’d intended to bring you to the Demon Dimension. You would be safe in the short term if you stayed in my territory, but you’ll be in a lot of trouble later on.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

The monkey replied, “There’s quite a bit of enmity between me and the Buddhist Path. They won’t let me go. So, if you’re with me, they’ll definitely target you, and your current strength isn’t sufficient to deal with that.”

“The Buddhist Path?” Yang Ye frowned, “What kind of organization is that?”

The monkey replied, “An extremely powerful one. In short, you’ll come into contact with the people and powers of that level very soon. Be careful! Let’s meet again if fate allows it!”

The monkey vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Only Yang Ye remained here.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. Once he determined that no one was around, he waved his right hand and transported Yin Hou out of the Primordial Pagoda. While he trusted her, it was best to be careful when it came to the Primordial Pagoda. It wasn’t just related to him; it was related to Su Qingshi and the others who resided in it!

At this moment, Yin Hou was still unconscious!

Yang Ye placed his right hand on her forehead, and his Primordial Violet Energy flowed out slowly into her forehead. Around 15 minutes passed before her eyes opened slowly.

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, are you alright?”

She glanced at the surroundings and gazed at Yang Ye, “You saved me?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Yin Hou frowned, “Impossible!”

Yang Ye replied, “I had the help of a friend. But he has left.”

Yin Hou glanced at Yang Ye, “You have a lot of secrets!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Everyone has their own secrets, right?”

She nodded and replied, “Your current situation is very worrying. Every race wants your sword.” She pondered deeply for a few moments and said, “Come with me to the shaman race for now!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “Will it get you into trouble?”

She seemed displeased, “What are you talking about? You’re his disciple, so that means you’re my disciple. The experts of the other races dare not openly come to the Shaman Dimension to kill!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded. He needed a place to stay and try to improve his strength!

The 6th stage of the True Realm was truly insufficient right now!

He had to improve his cultivation and strength!

That was his only thought!

Yin Hou led Yang Ye to Yin Gorge again. However, she didn’t stay and headed to the capital of the Shaman Dimension.

In the room, Yang Ye sat cross-legged and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye chuckled as he gazed at Hou Qing, “Senior, what’s your relationship with Yin Hou?”

Hou Qing shook his head slightly, “Instead of worrying about that, why don’t you worry about your current situation. That sword of yours is a calamity. You have to think of a way to deal with it, or you’ll be chased down and killed by the various races of this world!”

Chased down and killed by the various races!

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. He knew about that issue too. Based on the current situation, he was in a terrible situation. But what could he do? Hand it over? The problem was that the Sovereign of Man wouldn’t spare him even if he did that!

Especially the Shaman Hunter Clan, the Sovereign of Man, and the sky race. Now, he had another enemy, the sky race!

He had enemies throughout the world!

At this moment, he felt like the entire world was his enemy!

Hou Qing fell silent too. Hand over the sword to survive? Yang Ye was a sword cultivator! If he did that, it would destroy his heart towards the sword!

If he refused to hand it over, those experts would never stop hunting him!

A long time passed before Hou Qing shook his head, “Kid, what did you do in your past life? You were pursued throughout the lower universe, and you’re still being pursued in the upper universe… You definitely did something horrible in your past life, and that’s why your life is so terrible now!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

After that, Yang Ye stopped chatting with Hou Qing and started cultivating.

The important matter at hand was to improve his strength as soon as possible. Everything else wasn’t important!

Only his strength would keep him alive!

Time trickled by.

One day later. Early in the morning.

Yang Ye suddenly returned to the outside world and looked towards the door. The door opened, and Yin Hou walked in.

Yang Ye asked, “What’s wrong?”

She shook her head, “Come with me! Leave the Shaman Dimension immediately!”
