Chapter 673 – He Can’t Be Killed?

Yang Ye tossed the Mageforce Shield into the 2nd level of the Primordial Pagoda, the Pavilion of Alchemy, and the shield instantly fell silent.

“How could this be possible? How could this be possible!?” Meanwhile, the black clothed man suddenly howled furiously while bewilderment and shock filled his eyes. Because he noticed that the link between him and the Mageforce Shield had actually been completely severed when Yang Ye took the shield, and this made him feel extremely fearful of Yang Ye!

Because it was impossible for even a Half-Saint to wipe away his Spiritual Brand. After all, it was something he’d imprinted into the shield while he was at his peak. But this fellow with a sword who stood before him could actually sever the link between him and his Mageforce Shield, so how could he not be shocked and fearful?

Qin Bufan glanced at the black clothed man, and then his voice carried extremely obvious shock and bewilderment as he gazed at Yang Ye and asked, “How did you do it?”

It wasn’t impossible to eliminate another’s Spiritual Brand, but it was usually something that a profounder of higher cultivation did to one of lower cultivation. But Yang Ye was just an Exalt Realm profounder while the black clothed man was at the Monarch Realm. So, one at a lower realm of cultivation had wiped away the Spiritual Brand of someone at a higher realm of cultivation? He would absolutely not believe it if he hadn’t witnessed it with his own eyes!

Yang Ye wasn’t surprised that the Primordial Pagoda could suppress the Mageforce Shield. Because even until now, he still hadn’t come across anything that it couldn’t suppress.

Yang Ye paid no further attention to the shield for now. In any case, it was his now. He gazed at the black clothed man and said, “There’s no enmity between me and the defiant profounders, but you immediately started slaughtering the profounders of my southern territory once you escaped the seal. I’d like to ask who gave you the courage to do that?” As soon as he finished speaking, 12th level Sword Intent swept out and enveloped the black clothed man.

The black clothed man’s expression changed violently when he felt himself being suppressed by it, and he cried out involuntarily, “2nd level Heaven Rank Sword Intent! You actually possess 2nd level Heaven Rank Sword Intent! But you’re just an Exalt Realm profounder....”

The answer he received was a beam of sword energy. This time, it was much stronger and faster than before. Because he was suppressed by Yang Ye’s sword intent, the black clothed man wasn’t able to dodge at all, and he could only collide head-on against it. However, he was very clearly aware of the state he was in, and he knew that he would definitely be heavily injured if he did that.

He couldn’t die, but heavy injuries would cause his strength to decline, and that was something he couldn’t tolerate at all. He hurriedly gazed at Qin Bufan and said, “Please lend me a hand. I’ll definitely reward you greatly!”

Even though he’d asked for help, his counterattack wasn’t delayed at all. He waved his arms around as a few dozen enormous snakes that were formed from profound energy flashed forward and pounced at Yang Ye’s sword qi.

Hiss!

The enormous snakes were instantly dispersed upon coming into contact with Yang Ye’s sword energy, and it smashed directly against the black clothed man’s chest.

A shrill cry resounded as his chest exploded apart, causing blood and flesh to spray towards the surroundings while his figure was blasted flying. However, Yang Ye suddenly appeared in front of him. The black clothed man was horrified by this, and he was just about to speak when Yang Ye’s Sword Ruler smashed against his head.

Bang!

His head was like a watermelon that was smashed apart....

Yang Ye descended to the ground, and there was slight vigilance on his face as he gazed at the headless black clothed man. In next to no time, his expression changed a little because the pieces of the black clothed man’s head were actually starting to converge together swiftly!

It wasn’t just Yang Ye who was shocked, everyone else here was beyond shocked as well!

He can’t be killed?There really are people in this world who can’t be killed?

They watched with shock as the black clothed man’s head recovered to its previous state. Moreover, even his hands had recovered as well. However, his aura was much weaker than before, and he’d fallen to the first rank of the Monarch Realm as well!

“You can’t kill him. At the very least, you can’t right now!” Qin Bufan spoke abruptly.

Yang Ye said in response, “No one in this world is immortal!”

Qin Bufan replied, “You’re right. Even the most formidable person can be killed with sufficient strength. We can die as well. So long as you have the strength to deal with us, then we’ll die as well. Unfortunately, no one in this world possesses such strength.”

“Then doesn’t that make all of you eternal?” asked Yang Ye.

Qin Bufan answered, “Eternal? Hah! Do you know why we’ve been seizing Quintessence Violet Energy like madmen? It’s not to become stronger but to escape the current situation we’re in. Actually, we desire death more than anyone else.”

Yang Ye glanced at Qin Bufan and said, “You’re not someone who likes to waste his breath. Why’re you tell me all of this?”

“Because you’re killing the members of the Hallowed Grounds!” Qin Bufan said, “I’ve inquired into you, and I noticed that you are irreconcilable enemies with the Hallowed Grounds. In other words, we have a common enemy. Of course, I’m not trying to form an alliance with you. It’s just that in my opinion, regardless of whether that person is good or bad, a person who’s killing the members of the Hallowed Grounds shouldn’t die. Haha!!”

Yang Ye said, “In my opinion, it doesn’t matter if it’s the Hallowed Grounds or the defiant profounders, I won’t offend them if they don’t offend me. The Hallowed Grounds has offended me, so they’ll pay the price for that. Huh? You’re thinking of fleeing?” When he spoke up to this point, Yang Ye suddenly looked towards the side. The black clothed man had transformed into a ray of black light that was flashing towards the distance.

“Horizon Warp!” Yang Ye vanished on the spot before a sword howl resounded in the horizon. After that, countless strands of sword qi interweaved together before the black clothed man’s shrill cry resounded from afar.

Qin Bufan gazed up into the horizon and spoke softly, “He’s merely at the Exalt Realm yet is capable of surmounting his realm of cultivation and fighting Monarch Realm experts. Interesting....”

“Bastard! You can’t kill me! You can’t kill me!” The black clothed man’s furious howls resounded from afar, and it sounded quite miserable.

Yang Ye is beating up a Monarch Realm expert?

All the spectators weren’t able to wrap their heads around the situation here. But it didn’t matter because Yang Ye’s strength had improved greatly, and that was a good thing for the southern territory!

Actually, even if he could remain undefeated against the black clothed man, his previous strength was absolutely insufficient for him to crush the black clothed man with such ease. The main reason for this change was the Blood Essence of the Dragon Ancestor and the 3 divine beasts which he’d absorbed earlier, and the huge improvements he’d made in his attainments of the Heavenrend Drawing Technique. Especially the combination of overlapped Heavenrends and Critical Strike, it was something that ordinary Monarch Realm experts couldn’t resist at all!

It wasn’t long before no more howls resounded from afar, and then Yang Ye appeared once more within everyone’s fields of vision.

“Where’s he?” Qin Bufan spoke in a low voice. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Yang Ye glanced indifferently at Qin Bufan and said, “He’s dead. I slashed him into bits. It’ll probably take him a few years to recover.”

Qin Bufan and everyone else in the surroundings were speechless.
