Chapter 1441 – Death Hotel!

Who was the person before him?

It was no stranger to Yang Ye. Because it was Lian Suyao who’d wanted to kill him in the Radiant Dimension and exchange his head for permits into the large world.

Yang Ye hadn’t expected to encounter her here. They were naturally enemies because she’d almost killed him that day.

Lian Suyao was horrified when she saw him grab the hilt of his sword, and she hurriedly spoke, “What... what are you doing?!”

She was afraid of Yang Ye, of course. Actually, she should be said to be quite terrified of him.

After all, was anyone in the Eastern Territory not aware of how Yang Ye had slaughtered an entire city and killed over 20 Deities?

Over 20 Deities!

Actually, Lian Suyao felt quite lucky when she found out that Yang Ye had annihilated the experts of so many stellar regions. She felt lucky that she’d decided to retreat that day. Because if she hadn’t, then she might not exist in the world any longer.

But she hadn’t expected that she would actually encounter that maleficent existence, Yang Ye, here!

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “What? You’re not going to take my head and exchange it for a permit anymore?”

Lian Suyao inwardly heaved a sigh of relief when she saw that Yang Ye didn’t attack immediately, “I gave up that day. You....” Lian Suyao didn’t know what to say at this point.

Give in? She’d done that already. Apologize? If Yang Ye wanted to kill her, then apologizing would definitely be useless. So, her fate was in Yang Ye’s hands.

As for fleeing, she’d given it some thought, but she was very well aware that she couldn’t escape him. Yang Ye was just too quick.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye didn’t attack. He released his grip on the hilt of his sword and said, “You’re heading to the Ominous Territory?”

Lian Suyao heaved a sigh of relief when she saw this, and then she nodded, “I am.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Isn’t it very dangerous?”

“I’m only going to explore the outer area!” She glanced at him and added, “Moreover, I’m not weak.”

Yang Ye sized her up. Actually, Lian Suyao was right, she really wasn’t weak. After all, she’d been able to go head-on against the pig riding woman.

Yang Ye asked, “Do you know the Ominous Territory well?”

“I know a little.” She continued, “You’re going there too?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Meanwhile, the man in a luxurious robe by Lian Suyao’s side suddenly asked, “Miss Suyao, who’s he?”

Lian Suyao glanced at Yang Ye, hesitated for a moment, and was just about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly spoke before her, “Ye Yang, the character for leaf and sun.”

Only Zhuang Weiran, Ye Liuyun, Zhuang Weitian, and Qian Yaochan knew that he’d left Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region. As for the outside world, he was said to still be within Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region, and it was naturally done so to deter others. So long as Yang Ye was there, there would probably be no power that dared to attack Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region.

Besides that, he was very famous throughout the Eastern Territory, and he didn’t want others to pay special attention to him.

Keeping a low profile was actually the right choice on many occasions.

Lian Suyao instantly understood his intentions when she heard him say that, and she immediately nodded and didn’t speak further.

The man in a luxurious robe glanced at Yang Ye and said, “So it’s Brother Ye. I’m Xing Lie, and this is Ning Qing. We’re heading into the Ominous Territory. Since you’re going there as well, we can travel together. The Ominous Territory is extremely dangerous, so we can take care of each other if we stay in a group.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and nodded, “Alright.”

Yang Ye could discern that they were quite strong. Even though all three of them were Semi-Deities, they were definitely not weaker to Deities.

At this moment, Yang Ye understood why they’d been able to attain their current accomplishments.

They were brave and strived to succeed!

They knew that the Ominous Territory was extremely dangerous, yet they still dared to come. That was something that many senior experts couldn’t do. As far as those people were concerned, they refused to risk their lives. That proved the saying that the older one was, the more afraid that person would be of death!

The Ominous Territory was extremely dangerous indeed. But at the same time, there were great fortuitous encounters hidden within it. These geniuses dared to risk their lives. If they died, their story would come to an end; but what if they survived? Like Zhuang Weitian and the Celestial Demon Lord. They’d survived, and then they formed three star stellar regions and gained great status!

Lian Suyao was quite surprised when she heard Yang Ye agree. She hadn’t expected him to be willing to travel with them. The reason she was surprised was because she felt that Yang Ye was a sword cultivator, so he would definitely prefer to be on his own. After all, sword cultivators usually acted like that. But she felt that this was good too. It was definitely extremely good news for them if they had Yang Ye on their side.

Because ordinary Deities were utterly useless before Yang Ye.

As far as Yang Ye was concerned, it was beneficial to follow Lian Suyao’s group. He knew very little about the Ominous Territory, but Lian Suyao’s group clearly knew much more than him. Since they’d dared to come here, they’d definitely made preparations. But he’d come here in quite a rush as he had no choice but to come because of his lifespan.

After he arrived here, he had a stronger feeling that the Ominous Territory wasn’t ordinary, so he had to be careful.

It didn’t take long for their group of four to enter Ominous City.

Ominous City’s entrance wasn’t guarded. According to Lian Suyao, it didn’t have to be guarded. Because ordinary people wouldn’t come, and those who did were definitely not ordinary. Moreover, Ominous City wasn’t like Stellar City, no one dared to come here and do business. The Shi Clan dared to, but it wasn’t necessary. Because there were truly too few people who visited the city. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

As far as the Shi Clan was concerned, it only had to control the barrier which led into the Ominous Territory.

Ominous City wasn’t huge. If it was inhabited, then it would be able to accommodate around 100,000. Actually, it was equivalent to the size of a courtyard in a large power. There were very few buildings in the city, and they were just scattered around it, causing the city to seem rather empty. Something worthy of mentioning was that the dark grey energy was even denser within the city.

Presently, it wasn’t just his profound energy that flowed slightly slowly, even his breathing showed signs of slowing down.

It could be said that ordinary Voiders and Semi-Deities couldn’t come here at all. Even though coming here would pose no threat to their lives, their strengths would definitely decline tremendously. Moreover, if they stayed for long, it would definitely cause huge troubles for them.

Yang Ye gazed at Lian Suyao and asked, “What is this energy in the surroundings?”

“Miasma!” Lian Suyao spoke solemnly, “It comes from within the Ominous Territory. It used to be very scarce, but for some unknown reason, more and more has been seeping out.”

Yang Ye asked, “Is the Shi Clan not doing anything about it?”

Lian Suyao shook her head, “They can’t. Because it flows out incessantly from within the Ominous Territory. The only way to stop it is to enter the Ominous Territory. However, I’m sure you’re aware how terrifying it is. Even the Shi Clan doesn’t dare to enter the Ominous Territory and do as they please. So, in the end, the Shi Clan refused to do anything about it. In any case, those who dare to come here are usually not afraid of the miasma.”

“That’s true!” Yang Ye nodded. Besides that, ordinary people weren’t even aware that the Ominous Territory existed. So, those who could get here definitely possessed extraordinary strength. Thus, he couldn’t look down on anyone here. Just like Xing Lie and Ning Qing. He hadn’t concealed his cultivation at all. But even if he was just a Voider, the two of them hadn’t looked down on him at all.

Conversely, when they sized up Yang Ye, from time to time, there wasn’t just a trace of vigilance in their eyes, there even was a trace of seriousness.

What did it mean if a Voider dared to head to the Ominous Territory?

It represented that Voider was confident in his or her strength!

Simply speaking, the lower a person’s cultivation was in Ominous City, the more others would take that person seriously.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at Lian Suyao, “Are we going into the Ominous Territory right now?”

She shook her head, “We can’t.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She replied, “Because the sky is getting completely dark.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “We can’t go in at night?”

She nodded, “There are ominous beings in the Ominous Territory, and there’s the miasma as well. The miasma in there is at least 100 times thicker than it is out here. If we head in right now, we won’t be able to see anything. Because the miasma can obstruct our divine sense, and it’s especially so once we get in there. We aren’t able to release our divine sense at all once we enter the Ominous Territory. Besides that, you might suffocate to death in there.”

She seemed to have thought of something when she spoke up to this point, and she paused for a moment before she said, “You probably won’t!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Xing Lie and Ning Qing couldn’t help but glance at Yang Ye when they heard her, and there was a trace of curiosity in their eyes.

They knew how strong Lian Suyao was, yet she thought so highly of Yang Ye. So, they grew even more curious about Yang Ye.

Lian Suyao added, “We can only enter at noon. Because the sun shines the brightest at noon. At that time, the sun will reduce the density of the miasma. Moreover, there are fewer ominous beings moving about at that time. So, the two hours after noon are comparatively safer.”

Yang Ye asked, “What if the sun is gone?”

Lian Suyao spoke solemnly, “We must leave before the sun vanishes. You absolutely can’t stay the night in there. Otherwise....”

She couldn’t help but glance at him when she spoke up to this point, and then she said, “Staying the night in there shouldn’t be a big problem for you.”

Yang Ye’s face darkened. I know you think highly of me, but you don’t have to emphasize it repeatedly!“But it’s best if you don’t stay the night in there!” Meanwhile, she continued, “Of course, it’s just a suggestion.”

Yang Ye couldn’t help but ask, “Ominous beings? What sort of ominous beings are they? Are they really that terrifying?”

Lian Suyao shook her head, “I don’t know. Those who do are either dead or unwilling to speak of it. In short, there are dangerous things in there.”

Yang Ye nodded. He was about to speak when Xing Lie suddenly said, “It’s about to get dark.”

Lian Suyao’s expression changed slightly. She said, “Let’s go. Hurry up.”

As soon as she finished speaking, her figure shot forward. Xing Lie and Ning Qing hurriedly followed after her.

Yang Ye was stunned for a moment, and then he hurried after them.

It didn’t take long for him to catch up to Lian Suyao, “What’s wrong?”

Lian Suyao’s voice carried a trace of anxiety, “We must enter Death hotel before it gets completely dark. Otherwise, we’ll be finished!”

Death Hotel?

What the heck is that?

Yang Ye’s brows were pressed tightly together.
