Chapter 1650 - The Soul Nurturing Tree!

Translator: InVader

Presently, everyone was looking towards the city, and so were Yang Ye and An Nanjing.

Meanwhile, the gates to Phecda City opened abruptly, and then a middle aged man walked out from within the city.

Those 23 warriors immediately took a knee when they saw the middle aged man, and then they spoke in unison, “Commander!’

Commander!

The commander of the 72 warriors, Yang Zhen!

A solemn expression appeared on Yang Ye’s face because Yang Zhen was at the True Realm!

Another True Realm expert!

Yang Zhen glanced at the 23 warriors and nodded slightly, “Rise.”

They immediately stood up and stood respectfully behind Yang Zhen.

Yang Zhen gazed at An Nanjing, sized her up, and said, “You don’t seem to be a member of the Yang Clan.”

An Nanjing asked, “Does that make a difference?”

“Of course!” Yang Zhen continued, “No matter what Yang Ye, Yang Xu, Yang Yan, Marshal Yang Lan, and these warriors of mine do, it’s an internal affair of my Yang Clan. But you’re an outsider. The Yang Clan won’t treat outsiders the same way it treats its own members. Understand?”

“She’s my wife!” Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “Is she considered to be a member of the Yang Clan?”

An Nanjing glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent.

Yang Zhen glanced at Yang Ye and nodded, “The daughters-in-law of the Yang Clan are part of the clan, of course.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “Let’s put an end to it here, alright? Because if this continues, even our Yang Clan can’t afford to suffer such losses.”

Even Zenith Realm experts were quite scarce in the Yang Clan, let alone Half-Step True Realm experts. If Yang Ye and An Nanjing continued their slaughter, then all 23 warriors here may be annihilated. Even if they aren’t annihilated, at least 90% of them would die!

Even the Yang Clan couldn’t afford to lose over 20 of its warriors!

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and replied, “How do you intend to put an end to this?”

Yang Zhen fell silent for a moment, and then he raised his right hand and slapped his palm forward.

Bang!

Yang Yan and Yang Xu’s souls on the city walls shattered apart and were obliterated.

Yang Zhen looked up at Yang Ye, “Is that enough?”

Yang Ye turned to look at Yang Lang whom An Nanjing had heavily injured.

Meanwhile, Yang Zhen shook his head, “He’s out of the scope of my authority. I don’t have the authority to kill him. However, I won’t stop you if you want to kill him. But I suggest that you don’t.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “After all, you’re very weak right now.”

Yang Ye asked, “Do you think he’ll try to take revenge in the future?”

Yang Zhen nodded, “He will.”

Everyone knew that he would. Yang Lang was a marshal who possessed control over a huge amount of the Yang Clan’s forces. Once Yang Ye became the successor, or it should be said that once he became the patriarch, what would happen to Yang Lang?

So, Yang Lang would definitely stop at nothing to eliminate Yang Ye.

Yang Ye nodded, “I know that too.” As soon as he finished speaking, he raised his sword and waved it in Yang Lang’s direction.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy tore through the air and shot at Yang Lang. However, a white haired old man suddenly appeared in front of Yang Lang when it was about to strike its target, and then the old man waved his right hand.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s sword energy exploded apart and was instantly obliterated. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

A True Realm expert!

Another True Realm expert!

The old man glanced coldly at Yang Ye, “I’m Yang Shen, and I’m ranked the second amongst the seven marshals. If you want to take revenge, feel free to come at me in the future.” As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot, and Yang Lang vanished along with him.

Yang Shen!

Yang Ye nodded, “I’ll remember that.” He gazed at An Nanjing and continued, “Let’s go.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye started walking towards the city. But right when he was about to enter it, he suddenly looked up at the sky and asked, “I’m a young master of the Yang Clan too, so I should have my own abode, right?”

A moment of silence ensued before a voice came from above, “Of course.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he entered the city with An Nanjing and Lu Lige.

Once the left, Yang Zhen shot his gaze towards the distance, “Young Masters, I presume you’re done watching?”

“Not yet!” Yang Jian and the black robed old man suddenly appeared not too far away from Yang Zhen, and he smiled, “It was very interesting. Wasn’t it?”

Yang Zhen spoke indifferently, “Now that he’s joining the competition, I believe the competition will be even more interesting. Won’t it?”

Yang Jian nodded, “Isn’t that even better?”

Yang Zhen said, “It’s very good for the Yang Clan, but I’m afraid it isn’t very good for all of you.”

Yang Jian shook his head slightly and smiled, “The fight for succession has always been brutal. Commander Yang Zhen, farewell.” As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot with the old man.

Meanwhile, Yang Xing and another old man walked over. Yang Xing cupped his fists to Yang Zhen and was about to leave. However, a voice suddenly came from behind him, “Seventh Brother, why are you keeping such a low profile today?”

Yang Xing turned around and saw a white robed man walking slowly in his direction while holding a folding fan.

Yang Ru!

The Yang Clan’s fourth young master!

Yang Ru walked over to Yang Xing and smiled, “According to my knowledge, you lost two things, and those things seem to be in the possession of that new tenth brother of ours. I was planning to watch you attack and display your strength. Unfortunately, you suddenly acted like this. Could it be that you’re afraid of him?”

Yang Xing glanced coldly at Yang Ru, “Fourth Brother, want to spar?”

Yang Ru shook his head, “Seventh Brother, I have no intention to ridicule you on purpose. I’m not that bored. I’m here to discuss something with you. I’m sure you’ve realized that Yang Ye is extremely strong, and he has that mysterious woman by his side. Tsk, tsk…”

Yang Xing remained silent.

Meanwhile, Yang Ru continued, “Shall we go talk somewhere else?”

Yang Xing remained silent for a moment before he turned around and started walking into the city.

A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ru’s mouth, and then he vanished on the spot.

Yang Zhen looked off into the distance, glanced coldly at a spot there, and then made a grabbing motion with his right hand.

Bang!

The space there warped, and then Yang Xuan’s group of three shot out from there.

Yang Zhen’s gaze descended onto Yang Xuan and said, “Why did you bring him back here?”

Yang Xuan remained silent.

Yang Zhen gazed coldly at her, “I would kill you right now if you weren’t his younger sister.” He immediately vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

The 23 warriors vanished on the spot as well.

Yang Xuan remained silent for a long time before vanishing on the spot as well.

“Who was that woman?” Gu Xiu spoke in a low voice, “Her natural talent is absolutely extraordinary. If she’s at Yang Ye’s side…”

Qian Hu remained silent.

The strength and potential An Nanjing had revealed was truly too terrifying, and they weren’t the only ones, even the entire Yang Clan was shocked by it.

It didn’t take long for the name An Nanjing to swiftly spread throughout the medium universe of Milky Way System. As for Yang Ye, he’d been completely outdone by her. Actually, Yang Ye would definitely be the one who became famous if An Nanjing hadn’t joined the fight.

Unfortunately, it was An Nanjing now!

…

The Ye Mansion.

This time, Yang Ye gained a mansion of his own in Phecda City. However, he had no guards. The Yang Clan would absolutely not send guards to protect him. He wasn’t the only one, even the other young masters didn’t get such treatment. They had their own subordinates instead, and most of them were building up a power of their own or had experts that they’d drawn over to their side.

But Yang Ye had nothing!

Once they entered the mansion, An Nanjing shot up into the sky above the mansion, and then she sat cross-legged there with Skysplit at her side.

Lu Lige stood on guard at the entrance of the mansion instead.

As for Yang Ye, he immediately entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye was stunned when he entered the Primordial Pagoda. It was because a huge amount of white mist was floating throughout the surroundings. The mist was extremely dense and could be seen clearly with the eye.

Spirit energy!

The white mist was completely made out of spirit energy!

Snowy!

It was definitely Snowy’s work!

Yang Ye’s figure vanished on the spot, and it didn’t take long for him to find Snowy. Little Sky’s ethereal figure was in front of Snowy, and Snowy was holding her and crying incessantly, causing countless strands of spirit energy to speed out from her eyes.

Zi’er, on the other hand, was standing beside them with a helpless expression on her face.

Yang Ye walked over to Snowy. Snowy looked up at him and blinked. A moment later, she flew over to Yang Ye, wrapped her claws around his neck and started crying. In an instant, Yang Ye was enveloped in a white mist.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

It took quite some time for Yang Ye to console Snowy to the point she gradually calmed down. Yang Ye held Snowy in his arms as he gazed at Little Sky. At this moment, she was unconscious. It couldn’t be helped, the injuries she suffered had truly been too severe.

It could be said that if it wasn’t for the Primordial Violet Energy here, Little Sky may have vanished completely from this world.

Unfortunately, Little Sky was a soul, a soul that was injured. So, while Primordial Violet Energy worked on souls, its effects weren’t that great. Otherwise, he would have been able to awaken Xiao Qi by now.

A moment of silence ensued before Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda with Snowy, and then he vanished from Ye Mansion.

An Nanjing and Lu Lige hurriedly followed after him.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive before Yang Xuan in the Immortal Phoenix Pavilion.

Yang Ye looked Yang Xuan in the eyes, “You know how to wake her up and heal her completely, right?”

Yang Xuan fell silent for a moment and replied, “Soul Nurturing Wood. Soul Nurturing Wood at the Zenith Rank. It can store souls, strengthen souls, and nourish souls.”

Yang Ye asked, “Where can I find it?”

“The Ku Clan!” Yang Xuan spoke in a low voice, “They have a Soul Nurturing Tree. It’s the one and only one that’s known to exist.”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away.

Yang Xuan said, “Where are you going?!”

“The Ku Clan!” Yang Ye didn’t even turn around as he answered her.

Yang Xuan hurriedly said, “The Ku Clan isn’t weak! Don’t be rash!”

“I’m going to reason with them!” Yang Ye’s figure vanished on the spot.
