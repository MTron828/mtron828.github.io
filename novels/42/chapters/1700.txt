Chapter 1701 - The Wooden Sword Is Damaged?

Yang Ye was stunned when he saw Snowy heading towards the third floor while holding the wooden sword in her claws. He hurriedly stopped her and said, “What are you doing?!”

Snowy blinked, cracked a smile, and then pointed at the third floor to indicate that she was going up.

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She pointed at the wooden sword and pointed upstairs again.

Yang Ye frowned slightly. The wooden sword wants to go up? Why?

Meanwhile, Snowy flew over to Yang Ye, and then she took Yang Ye’s hand and started moving towards the third floor.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and he didn’t refuse. Since the wooden sword wanted to head upstairs, there was definitely something that was drawing its attention, or perhaps it was for some other reason. He was very curious too.

When they saw Yang Ye and Snowy heading towards the third floor, everyone here moved their attention over to them.

Suddenly, Xiao Jian and Xiao Youshui appeared before Yang Ye and Snowy. Xiao Jian glanced at Snowy, and then he gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Brother Ye, you can’t go up there.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Xiao Jian replied, “I mentioned it to you previously. True Rank sword intent is required to enter the third floor.”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s fine.” As he spoke, he took Snowy along with him to the barrier of light outside the third floor’s entrance.

Snowy raised the wooden sword and was about to strike the barrier of light, but Yang Ye stopped her.

He rubbed her head and placed his right hand on the barrier of light. Yang Ye’s sword intent seeped out from within him, and then it flowed along his arm and entered the barrier of light.

As soon as his sword intent came into contact with the barrier, the barrier started to tremble intensely, and then it gradually dispersed.

The expressions of everyone here changed from the sight of this, and it was the same even for Xiao Jian and his sister!

Right when Yang Ye and Snowy were about to head in, Xiao Jian stopped Yang Ye and Snowy again, and he stared at Yang Ye, “Why?”

The third floor was only accessible to people who possessed True Rank sword intent. But Yang Ye’s sword intent was only at the Zenith Rank!

Xiao Jian’s question was the same question which everyone else wanted to know the answer to.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Do you really want to know?”

Xiao Jian didn’t hesitate to reply, “Of course!”

Yang Ye glanced at the others in the surroundings and asked, “All of you want to know too?”

Many sword cultivators here nodded.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “I don’t know what your conviction towards the Sword Dao is, but mine is fearlessness. What does that mean? It means I fear nothing.”

As he spoke, he pointed at the entrance to the third floor, “The reason all of you remain here and haven’t gone up is probably that you’re aware that True Rank sword intent is required to head upstairs. So, you dismissed yourselves and felt you’re unable to head upstairs because your sword intent isn’t at the True Rank!”

Everyone here fell silent while some started to think deeply.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye continued, “Sword cultivators should be fearless and strive to be matchless. We especially can’t dismiss ourselves. If we dismiss ourselves, then that will probably be the end of our path of the sword.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took Snowy’s claw and walked upstairs.

Many sword cultivators started to think deeply, and so did Xiao Jian.

A short while later, Xiao Youshui spoke abruptly, “I don’t think that fellow had Zenith Rank sword intent.”

Xiao Jian gazed at her and asked, “What do you mean?”

Xiao Youshui spoke softly, “Even though what he said does make sense, I feel that his sword intent wasn’t just purely at the Zenith Rank.”

Xiao Jian was at a loss for words.

Yang Ye naturally didn’t just possess Zenith Rank sword intent. After all, his sword intent contained Unyielding Will. So, his sword intent was comparable to True Realm sword intent.

After Yang Ye and Snowy went upstairs, many sword cultivators on the second floor weren’t able to restrain themselves any longer, and they headed towards the third floor. However… all of them failed!

“Liar…” After failing countless times, many sword cultivators couldn’t help but start to curse Yang Ye. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

…

After they entered the third floor, it felt quite cold and deserted to Yang Ye because there was only a single person here. A woman.

Yang Ye glanced at her. She was around the age of 25, wore a tight white dress, and sat cross-legged on the ground with her eyes closed. It seemed like she was meditating.

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and looked at Snowy. The latter blinked and gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye laughed bitterly and shook his head, and then he rubbed her head gently and said, “Ask the wooden sword what it wants.”

Snowy cracked a smile and gazed at the wooden sword in her claw. A short while passed before it suddenly flew up into the air and went to the center of the room. Yang Ye and Snowy immediately followed it.

The wooden sword started to spin on the spot.

As it spun, Yang Ye noticed that something here seemed to be converging towards the wooden sword.

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “What are you doing?!”

Yang Ye turned to look towards its source. It was the woman in a white dress.

He replied, “I’m not doing anything!”

She gazed at the wooden sword in front of him, “Make it stop!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She gazed at him, “You want me to repeat myself?”

Yang Ye’s eyes instantly narrowed, “Then repeat yourself.”

As soon as he finished speaking, a sword suddenly appeared three inches away from his forehead. At the same time, she’d appeared in front of him. She looked him in the eyes, “Do you dare to repeat what you just said?”

Bang!

Suddenly, a strand of terrifying intent swept out from Yang Ye. The powerful intent instantly blasted her more than 10m away. After that, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was in front of her when he appeared again. At the same time, he swung the Sword Precursor at her with his left hand.

The woman’s expression remained calm, and she just raised her sword and stabbed.

Clang!

A clear and loud sound of collision resounded, and then Yang Ye was pushed around 100m away.

The woman didn’t attack again. She just gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “Zenith Rank sword intent. How could you have possibly gotten up here?”

Yang Ye gazed at her and said, “True Rank sword intent!”

For the very first time, he’d encountered someone with sword intent at a higher rank than his.

The woman sized up Yang Ye and said, “Your Zenith Rank sword intent isn’t ordinary. It contains another type of energy, and that energy makes your Zenith Rank sword intent capable of competing with True Rank sword intent!”

Her face suddenly turned cold at this point, “However, the Zenith Rank is still the Zenith Rank in the end!”

She took a step forward once she finished speaking. In an instant, an extremely powerful wave of sword energy swept out from her and slammed down in Yang Ye’s direction.

Yang Ye frowned slightly, fell silent for a moment, and then took a step forward. His Unyielding Sword Intent immediately swept forward and slammed down at her.

In next to no time, their intents were in a stalemate in midair.

Even though Yang Ye’s sword intent was at the Zenith Rank, his sword intent contained Unyielding Will, so it was equally matched with her sword intent. However, his sword intent couldn’t push her sword intent back as well. So, they were in a stalemate.

At this moment, both of them didn’t withdraw their sword intent, nor did they dare to. If any one of them was the first to withdraw it, and the other pushed forward to pursue victory, then the one who was first to withdraw the sword intent would definitely suffer a huge blow.

Just like that, they were in a stalemate for around a quarter of an hour, and then Yang Ye gradually showed signs of falling into a disadvantaged situation.

Yang Ye’s face fell when he noticed that his sword intent was gradually losing its ground.

As expected, while his sword intent could compete with True Rank sword intent, a gap definitely did still exist between them.

Suddenly, Snowy grabbed the spinning wooden sword and swung it at her.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy flashed.

Her expression changed slightly when she saw the sword energy. A sword instantly appeared in her grasp with a flip of her left hand, and then it shot forward like a bolt of lightning.

Bang!

Snowy’s sword energy was blasted apart. At the same time, Snowy swung the wooden sword again.

Clang!

As soon as they came into contact with each other, the woman’s sword was instantly slashed into two and fell to the ground.

The woman’s eyes narrowed at the sight of this. At the same time, both she and Yang Ye dispersed their sword intent.

Meanwhile, Snowy was about to attack again, but Yang Ye stopped her.

At the same time, the woman in a white dress asked, “What is that sword?!”

Yang Ye glanced at her and replied, “Why are you trying to stop my sword from spinning here?”

She gazed at him, “You don’t know what it’s doing?”

Yang Ye gazed at Snowy. The latter blinked, and then shrugged to display that she didn’t know.

Yang Ye gazed at the wooden sword, but it didn’t answer him.

Suddenly, the woman said, “It isn’t your sword!”

Yang Ye gazed at her and nodded, “Indeed, it isn’t.”

She looked Yang Ye in the eye, “An unowned treasure!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when she suddenly vanished on the spot, and her target was the wooden sword.

She intended to take it!

Yang Ye’s face fell. He was about to act, but Snowy was faster. She held the wooden sword in her claws and swung it at the woman.

Bang!

The might of the wooden sword pushed the woman back.

Snowy raised the sword with the intention of attacking again. However…

Crack!

A clear and loud crack resounded.

Snowy and Yang Ye gazed at the wooden sword, and both of them were stunned.

Because a piece of wood had actually fallen off the wooden sword.

It’s damaged?
