Chapter 61 – Returning Home!

Liu Clan! If anything happens to my younger sister and mother, then I’ll annihilate your entire clan! Yang Ye held tightly onto the little in his hand while his expression was savage and terrifying, and he walked quickly to Elder Qian’s residence.

The letter wasn’t written by Little Yao, and it was Qing Hong instead. The letter said that Yang Ye’s younger sister and mother had suffered a sneak attack by a group of unknown black clothed people two days ago. This group of black clothed people was extremely formidable, and the three of them were utterly unable to resist these black clothed people. Fortunately, these black clothed people didn’t desire to take his younger sister and mother’s lives, and they only intended to capture the two of them.

However, luckily, his younger sister and mother hadn’t been captured by them because the sudden appearance of Qing Hong and the others had taken those black clothed people by surprise. The battle between them had drawn over the patrolling guards in Southpeace City, and the black clothed people withdrew when the patrol arrived.

Qing Hong hadn’t hesitated at all to send Yang Ye a letter asking Yang Ye to think of a way to overcome all of this!

When he saw the content of this letter, the first thought that entered Yang Ye’s mind was the Liu Clan! His family had practically no enemies within Southpeace City, and it only had a great deal of conflict with the Liu Clan. Especially after he formed an agreement to fight Liu Qingyu on the Life and Death Arena, this conflict between them had become irreconcilable!

After feeling furious, Yang Ye felt fortunate. He felt fortunate that he’d asked Qing Hong’s group of three to head to Southpeace City and protect his younger sister and mother because if they weren’t there, then his younger sister and mother would have probably been unable to avoid disaster!

After feeling fortunate, he was furious again. His younger sister and mother were the most important people in his life, yet the Liu Clan had actually dared to make a direct move against them. So, at this moment, Yang Ye truly desired to annihilate the Liu Clan!

“Elder Qian, I’m going back to Southpeace City!” Within Elder Qian’s room, Yang Ye gazed at Elder Qian while he spoke in a low voice.

When he saw Yang Ye arrive with a gloomy expression, and after he heard what Yang Ye said, Elder Qian was stunned. After that, he said, “Yang Ye, the competition between all of you new outer court disciples will begin tomorrow, and the top 10 will receive rewards from the Sword Sect. There are Profound Rank techniques amongst those rewards. Moreover, it’s very likely that the Peak Masters of the other peaks will remember the names of the top 10. This is an opportunity!”

Yang Ye shook his head, and then he told Elder Qian about what had occurred in Southpeace City.

Elder Qian’s expression turned solemn after he heard Yang Ye, and he said, “This is probably related to Liu Qingyu!”

“Liu Qingyu?” Yang Ye was puzzled, and he asked. “Isn’t he in the Sword Sect?”

Elder Qian shook his head and said, “Liu Qingyu left the Sword Sect when you ascended to the 21st level of the Sword Servant Pagoda, and two other disciples that were ranked on the Outer Court Rankings had left along with him. At that time, I didn’t pay much attention to it, and I thought that after he found out about your natural talent, he’d returned to Southpeace City to ask his Liu Clan to get on friendly terms with your family. But I never expected that he hadn’t returned to get on friendly terms with you, and he’d returned to deal with you instead!”

A wisp of ghastly killing intent flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes when he heard this, and he said, “Only two months remain before the agreed-upon battle between him and me would commence. Looks like he can’t wait to eliminate me!”

Elder Qian said, “Little Yang, with your current potential and natural talent, do you truly think that the Sword Sect would allow him to kill you on the Life and Death Arena? It wouldn’t! Even if you lose on the Life and Death Arena, the Sword Sect wouldn’t allow him to kill you because your existence is related to the next Ascension Rankings, and Liu Qingyu probably understands this principle. So, if he wants to kill you, then he can only leave the Sword Sect, and the reason he intends to capture your younger sister and mother is probably for the sake of drawing you out of the Sword Sect!”

Yang Ye bowed to Elder Qian, and then he said, “Elder Qian, I’m already an outer court disciple now. So, in other words, I can leave the Sword Sect at any time to temper myself. I want to ask Elder Qian to allow me to utilize the teleportation formations at the Teleportation Platform.”

Utilizing the teleportation formation was the reason Yang Ye had come to look for Elder Qian. Because outer court disciples didn’t possess the qualifications to utilize the teleportation formations, and in the outer court, only the elders could utilize it.

Elder Qian said in a low voice, “Liu Qingyu’s strength has already attained the third rank of the First Heaven Realm, and the two disciples that left with him are respectively at the first rank and second rank of the First Heaven Realm. At this moment, you’re only at the ninth rank of the Mortal Realm, and you’re utterly not a match for them. How about this? I’ll head to Southpeace City and meditate with the Liu Clan while you rest at ease and cultivate in the Sword Sect. What do you think?”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Elder Qian, the enmity between the Liu Clan and I are already irreconcilable, and the Liu Clan probably understands this as well. Even if they promise Elder Qian on the surface that they wouldn’t cause trouble for my younger sister and mother, they’d still make a move in secret. I’m going back this time was the exact intention of putting an end to the enmity with the Liu Clan!” As he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s tone had become extremely cold and ghastly!

Elder Qian’s lips moved, yet he didn’t continue persuading Yang Ye any longer. He was extremely clearly aware of the status Yang Ye’s younger sister and mother had in his heart. The Liu Clan’s actions of making a move against his younger sister and mother had truly touched Yang Ye’s ‘reverse scale’. Just as Yang Ye had said, it was truly irreconcilable this time.

However, it was very likely that Yang Ye might suffer misfortune when he returned this time. After all, the strengths of Liu Qingyu and those other two disciples were absolutely not something Yang Ye could go against. However, he was very clearly aware that even if he didn’t allow Yang Ye to utilize the teleportation formation, Yang Ye would rush back to Southpeace City all the same. He had a very good understanding of Yang Ye’s temper!

Elder Qian sighed in a low voice after a long time. “Come, I’ll take you to the Teleportation Platform!”

“Thank you, Elder Qian!” Yang Ye cupped his fists towards Elder Qian as he spoke.

Elder Qian shook his head and said with a low voice, “I’ll take you to the Teleportation Platform, but I won’t help you deal with the Liu Clan. You ought to be clearly aware that the Grand Qin Empire is extremely averse towards sects interfering in the enmity of the mortal world. If I interfere, then it’s very likely to cause conflict between the Sword Sect and the Grand Qin Empire.”

Even though he really cared about Yang Ye, he would absolutely not bring harm to the sect because of Yang Ye!

“I understand!”

Elder Qian continued. “Besides that, you’re not returning to Southpeace City now as a disciple of the Sword Sect, and you’re returning as a Labor Disciple. Understand?”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he came to an understanding. If he entered into battle with the Liu Clan, and he was a disciple of the Sword Sect, then it would undoubtedly cause the Grand Qin Empire to be displeased with the Sword Sect.

When he thought up to here, he said, “Elder Qian, I understand. However, everyone knows that I’m already an outer court disciple now. So....”

Elder Qian shook his head and said, “You’re not a true disciple of the Sword Sect yet! In order to become a disciple of the Sword Sect, you have to wait until after the competition tomorrow. The sect will distribute the sect’s uniform, and your names will be recorded on the Sword Sect’s register for disciples. Only then will you be considered as a disciple of the Sword Sect. Strictly speaking, you’re not a disciple of the Sword Sect now!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment, and then he nodded and said, “I understand!”

Elder Qian nodded and said, “Come, I’ll take you to the Teleportation Platform!” As soon as he finished speaking, he stood up and headed out of his residence.

Yang Ye hurriedly followed him.

The Sword Sect was built on Void Mountain, and Void Mountain continued on for over 500km, and there were seven main peaks and 36 small peaks in the Sword Sect. Every single peak towered into the clouds, and they were extremely far away from each other. Especially the distance between the seven main peaks, if one walked on foot, then an outer court disciple would at least have to walk for a few days!

So, there was a Teleportation Platform on every single peak in the sword sect, and these Teleportation Formations provided teleportation towards the other peaks.

Of course, these teleportation formations weren’t for the use of outer court disciples, and it was for the inner court disciples, elite disciples, and elders of the seven main peaks to utilize. As for why the outer court disciples couldn’t utilize them? It was because the outer court disciples lacked the strength to utilize them! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

There were dangers when it came to teleportation formations. When one is teleported, it would cause that person to feel dizzy and uncomfortable throughout the body. If that person’s strength was too weak, it might even cause that person to become muddled or even fall unconscious during the teleportation process.

If one lost consciousness while being teleported... don’t worry, it wouldn’t lead to death, and it would only lead to a loss of all mental ability! Such cases had occurred in the Sword Sect in the past. Thus, from then onwards, the Sword Sect prohibited outer court disciples from utilizing the teleportation formations.

Yang Ye and Elder Qian arrived at the Teleportation Platform. When the disciples guarding the Teleportation Platform saw that it was Elder Qian, they bowed to him and paid no further attention to him.

The Teleportation Platform was a few meters high, and it was a stone platform that was over 30m wide. There were over 100 light blue circles on the stone platform. Every single blue circle represented a peak. Of course, some were connected to other places like dangerous areas in the Grand Myriad Mountains or some cities within the Grand Qin Empire!

As he gazed at those circles, Yang Ye knew that he could absolutely not enter the wrong circle. Otherwise, once he did and was teleported to a place like the territory of a King Rank Darkbeast in the Grand Myriad Mountains, then he would really be unable to return with his life. Moreover, such an accident seemed to have occurred in the past!

Fortunately, from that day onward, the light blue circles were labeled with their destinations.
