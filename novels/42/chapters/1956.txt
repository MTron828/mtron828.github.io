Chapter 1957 – Fight Them!

Late at night. The surroundings fell perfectly silent.

Yang Ye stood on the city wall with his hands behind his back, and he gazed indifferently at the sky.

The gazes of many had converged on Yang Ye.

A voice came from behind Qin Chuan, “Qin Chuan, do you think that new guy can survive the night?”

Qin Chuan turned around. It was Yu Jing who’d spoken those words.

Qin Chuan looked up at Yang Ye and spoke softly, “Based on his strength, it’s naturally not a problem. I’m only worried about his mentality. If he feels fear, stops fighting, and flees, then…”

“Then he’ll be a piece of trash!” Yu Jing chuckled, “This isn’t just a test of strength, it’s a test of courage. If he doesn’t have sufficient courage, A’Man won’t let him stay. After all, a useless teammate was the most terrifying thing in battle!”

Qin Chuan nodded slightly, and then he looked up at Yang Ye. Meanwhile, Yu Jing suddenly said, “Qin Chuan, dare to make a bet with me?”

Qin Chuan asked, “What bet?”

Yu Jing chuckled, “Let’s bet if he’ll be able to survive the night. If he survives, I’ll give you three immortal crystals; if he can’t, you give me three instead. Alright?”

Qin Chuan was slightly hesitant.

Yu Jing chuckled, “What? You’re afraid?” His laughter carried a trace of ridicule.

Qin Chuan spoke indifferently, “Yu Jing, there’s no need to provoke me. I’ll make the bet. However, I don’t want three immortal crystals, let’s bet five instead. It’s all I have. Do you dare?”

Yu Jing’s smile gradually vanished, “Are you that confident?”

Qin Chuan replied, “I’m not. But since we’re better, why not make it bigger? If I lose, I’ll lose everything, and if I win, I’ll win a little more!”

A smile curled up on the corners of Yu Jing’s mouth, “Bring it on!”

…

The night sky grew darker and darker.

A long time later.

Screech!

An ear piercing cry resounded through the sky.

At this moment, everyone seemed like they were facing a formidable enemy.

Yang Ye’s face was extremely calm. Finally, a wyvern appeared above him. It didn’t attack, and it just looked down at him with disdain and ridicule!

Yang Ye suddenly shouted, “What are you looking at?”

The wyvern was furious, and it immediately dived down at Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye slowly clenched his fists. When it arrived around 10m away from him, Yang Ye suddenly stomped his right foot down, shot up into the air, and slammed his fists against it.

He didn’t use his sword. It wasn’t because he looked down on it, and he merely wanted a battle.

Simply speaking, he wanted to determine what he needed to improve!

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye’s figure was slammed against the city walls. Meanwhile, the wyvern’s claw descended towards Yang Ye’s head.

Right when everyone thought his head would be clawer open, Yang Ye twisted his palm upwards and grabbed the wyvern’s claw, and then he pulled and swung it down to the ground in one motion!

Bang!

The wyvern was caught off guard and slammed against the city walls. However, the city walls seemed to be made from some sort of mysterious material that rendered it extremely solid, and it merely trembled from the impact.

Everyone down below exchanged glances when they witnessed this.

Yu Jing spoke softly, “That fellow’s a body refiner…”

Qin Chuan replied, “He’s even stronger with the sword!”

Yu Jing glanced at Yang Ye and smiled, “Is that so?” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Everyone watched Yang Ye fight the wyvern, and they fought intensely in a matter that shocked everyone quite a bit.

It was a close quarter battle!

Yang Ye was fighting the wyvern in close quarters!

The wyvern’s claw slammed against Yang Ye’s body, causing a bloody claw mark to appear on him. However, Yang Ye slammed his fist against the wyvern as well, causing the point of impact to crack open and bleed!

Just like that, Yang Ye and the wyvern struck each other over and over again. They fought in the most direct, intense, and primitive manner.

However, Yang Ye wasn’t in a very good situation.

Firstly, his speed was inferior to it. So, the wyvern always struck him first. Secondly, there were too many bloody injuries throughout his body, causing his clothes to be dyed red with blood. It seemed like he’d soaked himself in blood! Conversely, while the wyvern was injured too, its injuries weren’t lethal!

Even then, Yang Ye’s aura wasn’t inferior to the wyvern at all. On the contrary, he frequently took the initiative to attack, and he didn’t just passively defend himself.

Just like that, they fought madly.

Time trickled by, and a speck of light appeared in the sky.

Dawn was arriving!

The wyvern roared, and then it started flying towards the sky.

Suddenly, a hand grabbed its leg, and slammed it to the ground.

Bang!

The wyvern was slammed against the city wall.

After he slammed it against the wall, Yang Ye charged up and slammed his fist at it. Even though he’d struck the wyvern, the wyvern struck his chest too.

Bang!

Yang Ye was slapped flying.

After slapping Yang Ye away, the wyvern didn’t stay a moment longer, and it shot up into the sky. However, a hand grabbed its claw again, and then slammed it against the wall again.

Bang!

The entire wall shook violently!

Yang Ye charged at the wyvern again!

This time, it didn’t try to attack Yang Ye again, and it wanted to fly into the sky because it was getting even brighter now!

However, Yang Ye was like a ghost that refused to leave it. Every time the wyvern tried to fly away, Yang Ye would charge over and force it back.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Muffled explosions resounded incessantly above the city wall. Sometimes, Yang Ye’s figure was blasted away; sometimes, the wyvern’s figure was blasted away.

At this moment, the wyvern was at a complete disadvantage. Because it had no intention to continue fighting, it just wanted to leave. However, Yang Ye was growing more and more excited as the battle continued, and he kept pulling the wyvern back and bashing it up!

“That’s enough!” Suddenly, a voice resounded above the city walls. An instant later, A’Man appeared before Yang Ye.

At the same time, Yang Ye had just swung his fist forward. Because she’d arrived so abruptly and coupled with the fact that Yang Ye was in a very excited state, he wasn’t able to stop his punch, nor did the thought ever cross his mind.

A’Man remained indifferent when facing Yang Ye’s punch. She just stretched out her right hand and grabbed Yang Ye’s fist!

Yang Ye’s fist slammed against the center of her palm, but she seemed like a mountain and didn’t move at all.

At this moment, Yang Ye’s mind had cleared up quite a bit. He glanced at the wyvern, and he noticed that it had vanished into the sky.

Yang Ye pulled his fist back and asked, “Why?”

A’Man gazed at the sky, “We can’t kill them!”

Yang Ye said, “I don’t understand!”

A’Man pointed at the sky. He could faintly see a mountain range from here, but he couldn’t see it clearly.

A’Man said, “There are countless wyverns there, but do you know why only a few come here every time?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

“Training!” A’Man gazed at Yang Ye, “We’re tempering ourselves with them, and they are doing the same!”

Yang Ye replied, “But they can kill us!”

A’Man nodded slightly, “I don’t like it too. But you must understand that they are stronger than us, and they have more forces than us. That’s why they come looking for us, and we don’t go looking for them.”

She walked over to Yang Ye and continued, “Can you fight 10 wyverns on your own?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

A’Man said, “I can’t either. No one can fight a few dozen on their own here. So, we have to keep a low profile!”

As soon as she finished speaking, A’Man flicked two immortal crystals to Yang Ye, and then she left.

Yang Ye was stunned when he saw the immortal crystals. Meanwhile, Qin Chuan and Yu Jing walked over to him, and Qin Chuan spoke softly, “Take it!”

Yang Ye pointed at it and asked, “Is this thing very precious?”

“Precious?” Yu Jing chuckled, “I wouldn’t even spare it a glance in the outside world. However, it’s more precious than life here.”

Yang Ye asked, “What do you mean?”

Qin Chuan explained, “I don’t know how it is in other places, but there are only two ways to obtain immortal crystals here. One, kill and steal; two, Southern Qilin Mountain that’s thousands of kilometers away from us. The remnants of a spirit vein lies there, but we can’t go there at all!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

“Because it’s too dangerous!” Qin Chuan explained, “It’s dangerous even for A’Man.”

He gazed at A’Man and continued, “She returned covered in injuries once. It was the first time we saw her injured.” He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “She risked her life to get all these immortal crystals!”

Yu Jing spoke softly, “If it wasn’t for her, we so-called geniuses would be dead.”

Yang Ye glanced at A’Man, and then he gazed at the immortal crystals in his grasp. At this moment, he had quite a bit of complicated emotions in his heart.

Actually, he really needed immortal crystals too.

Because every time he fought, cultivated, or healed required a huge number of immortal crystals. While Snowy could create them, it required spirit energy to be done. Moreover, it had to be exceptionally good spirit energy.

Now, he only had around 100 immortal crystals.

This wasn’t the outside world. So, if he used them all up, then even Snowy wouldn’t be able to create more.

Suddenly, a man appeared in front of A’Man. It was the Mad Saber!

There was a deep palm print on the Mad Saber’s back.

A’Man was visibly surprised as she asked, “He attacked?”

The Mad Saber nodded, “He wants us to hand the killer over!”

A’Man suddenly stood up, “Tell everyone to get ready! It’s time to fight them!”
