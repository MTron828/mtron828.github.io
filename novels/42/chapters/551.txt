Chapter 552 – The Tiny Vortex’s Summons

“So we were still too weak!” An Nanjing spoke in a low voice. Today’s events allowed her to realize while both she and Yang Ye were practically unmatched in the Exalt Realm, they were still like ants in the eyes of those supreme experts. Just like in that situation earlier, both Yang Ye and her weren’t able to resist at all when facing those supreme experts!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and gazed towards the Exalted Han Empire while seemingly material killing intent appeared in his eyes. The events of today had given him a deeper understanding of the importance of strength. Even though he had Elder Mu’s backing, he had no doubt that Elder Mu wouldn’t be able to stop a Half-Saint from killing him!

The only reason Luo Dao didn’t kill him was because Luo Dao didn’t want Luo Jun to die!

How ironic was that!

“Indeed, we’re still too weak!” said Yang Ye.

“I’m going into closed door cultivation, and I refuse to leave until I’ve attained the Monarch Realm!” An Nanjing said, “Perhaps that day will come very soon, but it might only arrive 100 years from now or even longer. Don’t die. I hope that I’ll still be able to see you when I emerge from my closed door cultivation. If you really died, then I’ll definitely avenge you. Regardless of who it was!”

As soon as she finished speaking, An Nanjing took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye before she turned around and left.

Yang Ye stood silently on the spot while he watched An Nanjing’s figure vanish from his field of vision. A short while passed before he turned around to look at Yin Xuan’er, and then he returned the 12 Gold Guards to her before he said, “We’re heading back to the southern territory. Will you be coming with us or staying at the central territory?”

“I still have matters to attend to in the central territory, so I won’t be heading back for now! “said Yin Xuan’er.

Yang Ye nodded, and then he said, “Until next time!” As soon as he finished speaking, he brought Lu Jianyao along as he flashed onto the back of the divine gold dragon.

In merely an instant, the divine gold dragon vanished on the horizon.

After Yang Ye left, Yin Xuan’er went over to a deserted corner, and then a black shadow appeared behind Yin Xuan’er. If Yang Ye was here, he would notice that this black shadow was the Pavilion Master of the Dark Pavilion whom he’d fought earlier!

“What a pity! Luo Jun survived in the end!” The Dark Pavilion’s Master said, “If Luo Jun died, then the central territory would definitely fall into chaos, and the other territories would definitely attack the central territory and devour that colossus. Even the demon race and devil race would definitely take part in it. At that time, our Shang Dynasty would be able to take advantage of the situation. Alas, I never expected that the Exalted Han Empire would actually dispatch a Half-Saint and 3 ninth rank Monarch Realm experts to kill Yang Ye and protect Luo Jun!”

“It is a pity!” Yin Xuan’er’s expression was icy cold as she said, “If I’m not wrong, then the World Portrait should be in Yang Ye’s possession.”

The Dark Pavilion’s Master said, “Then why didn’t you act and seize it from him, my Princess?”

Yin Xuan’er glanced at the Dark Pavilion’s Master and said, “Do you think that we can go against a Half-Saint right now? Even if Yang Ye didn’t have a master at the Half-Saint Realm, I still wouldn’t want to rashly become enemies with him. Moreover, Luo Jun will definitely become the emperor of the Exalted Han Empire once he returns. Once he takes full control of the Exalted Han Empire, he’ll definitely attack the northern territory before dealing with the southern territory. The northern territory is a base we established with painstaking effort, so it can’t be lost. Send someone to notify the Emperor of the northern territory’s Southern Gate Empire that he should form an alliance with the Grand Qin Empire and Darkbeast Empire of the southern territory to jointly resist the Exalted Han Empire!”

“It’s probably impossible to stop Luo Jun anymore!” The Dark Pavilion’s Master spoke in a low voice.

Yin Xuan’er said, “He can be stopped. He won’t be able to subdue the northern territory and southern territory with ease while the World Portrait isn’t in his possession!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The Dark Pavilion’s Master nodded and said, “Princess, the Grand Preceptor sent word that Yang Ye is one who’s envied by the heavens, so it’s best if you don’t come into contact with him much!”

Yin Xuan’er fell silent for a short while, and then she said, “I know what I’m doing. You may leave!”

“Yes!”

...

On the back of the divine gold dragon.

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and then the old man in Daoist robes appeared before him. The old man swept the surroundings with his gaze before he heaved a sigh of relief. He said, “A Half-Saint, I never expected that there would still be two Half-Saint experts in the human world! Kid, you better not allow them to find out about me. Otherwise, they’ll definitely kill you to seize me!”

“Perhaps they wouldn’t even take a liking to you!” Yang Ye spoke indifferently.

“What nonsense!” The old man spoke furiously. “Do you know what a Natural Dao Artifact with a complete Equipment Spirit represents? If I were to acknowledge them as my owner, then not only would their strengths increase greatly, they would obtain the help of another Monarch Realm expert. Moreover, it would even be an expert who would hold all things in the world. Do you think they wouldn’t be tempted? Not to mention a mere Half-Saint, even Saint Liu Yun was tempted, otherwise, he wouldn’t have imprisoned me for so many years!”

“Doesn’t that mean I can’t use you even if I have you?” said Yang Ye.

The old man said, “It’s best if I don’t show myself in public. Because I should be the only complete Natural Dao Artifact in the entire world right now. Even though I can’t show myself in the open, I can transform into the World Portrait, and you can use it to store your possessions.”

“Alright!” Yang Ye nodded and said, “Unless I have no other choice, I don’t want to rely on others anyway!”

The old man nodded, and then he hesitated for a moment and said, “I’ve just obtained freedom and want to take a look at the world. I’m not trying to flee. You just have to issue a single command in your mind if you need me because my strength is sufficient for me to come to you in less than 100 breaths of time, even if I’m two territories away. Of course, it’s fine for you to refuse!”

Yang Ye said, “There’s nothing to refuse. Since you want to see the world, then go ahead!” He wasn’t afraid that the World Portrait would flee at all. Because the restriction placed within him was left behind by a Saint Realm expert, so unless another Saint Realm expert helped him, otherwise, it would be impossible for him to struggle free from the restraints of Saint Liu Yun’s soul!

The old man glanced at Yang Ye, and then he smiled. “Not bad! You’re much better than that bastard, Saint Liu Yun!” As soon as he finished speaking, his figure vanished in the air.

“He’s the World Portrait?” Meanwhile, Lu Jianyao spoke abruptly.

Yang Ye nodded and said, “How are your injuries?”

Lu Jianyao said, “It’s nothing serious. Fortunately, you had some Life Water, otherwise, I would probably be crippled even if I survived.”

Yang Ye said, “Don’t act so foolishly in the future, alright?”

“You’ve saved me on so many occasions. So how could I just stand by idly when I saw you facing danger?” Lu Jianyao smiled and said, “But my strength was too weak. Not only was I unable to help you, I even became a burden to you.”

Yang Ye said, “Alright, let’s not speak about that anymore. We’ll arrive in the southern territory soon. If you want, you can come with me to the Sword Sect. You should like that place because it’s filled with sword cultivators!”

Lu Jianyao suddenly asked. “You wife is the current Sect Master of the Sword Sect?”

Yang Ye nodded, and then his gaze shot towards the direction of the Sword Sect. Qingshi, Yuxi, and my unborn child....

Lu Jianyao glanced at Yang Ye, bit her lips, and didn’t speak further.

A short while passed before Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he sat down cross-legged and immersed his consciousness into himself.

“Do you know how weak you are right now?” The little girl shot an icy cold gaze at Yang Ye as she spoke.

Yang Ye nodded and said, “I realize that I’m very weak when compared to those Half-Saint Realm and ninth rank Monarch Realm experts. But come on! Just think about it yourself, how long have I been cultivating for? How long have they been cultivating for?”

“Weakness is weakness! What’s with all the excuses?” said the little girl.

Yang Ye was speechless.

“You must attain the Monarch Realm as soon as possible. After that, the strength you possess combined with your Sword Domain will make it impossible for even Half-Saints to kill you with ease!” The little girl revealed a serious expression for the first time.

Yang Ye asked “How strong are you right now?”

The little girl fell silent for a while before she said, “In any case, I can’t defeat those old geezers from before, but I would be if I recover my strength.”

Yang Ye understood what she meant. She could deal with ordinary Monarch Realm experts, but she was helpless against experts at the ninth rank of the Monarch Realm.

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while before he said, “What exactly is the tiny vortex?”

The little girl glanced at Yang Ye and said, “It’s called the Primordial Pagoda, and it’s a treasure that belonged to an extraordinarily formidable old Daoist from my world. It has many uses. For example, it can suppress a villain or even an entire world. Most importantly, it can create Primordial Violet Energy to improve a person’s constitution. I told you before this that the only reason you were able to attain your current accomplishments in such a short period of time was because your natural endowments and constitution had been improved!”

Yang Ye said, “Can I take control of it right now?”

The little girl shook her head and said, “I don’t think so. Perhaps you can try after you attain the Monarch Realm, but it’ll probably be very difficult. It isn’t something that those Natural Dao Artifacts of your world can compare to!”

Yang Ye continued. “You should be aware that both of us are too weak right now, yet we just happen to be on the same boat. So, if you have a way to accomplish it, then don’t hide it from me. Let me become stronger, otherwise, you might not be able to return to the Milky Way System.”

The little girl said, “Excessive desire to become stronger fast isn’t beneficial to you at all. Understand?”

Yang Ye sighed lightly. He was naturally clearly aware of that. However, he really didn’t want to experience that feeling of powerlessness again.

Bang!

Right at this moment, a door suddenly appeared within the tiny vortex.

Yang Ye was stunned, but the little girl’s expression changed slightly, and then she glanced at Yang Ye with a complicated expression before she said, “It wants you to head in there. Looks like even it realizes that you’re too weak right now!”

Yang Ye was delighted when he heard this, and he said, “In other words, I’ll directly improve my strength to the Monarch Realm, and it would be an improvement without even the slightest side effects?”

“You’re reading too much into it.” The little girl spoke coldly. “It’s best if you drop such thoughts. There are no shortcuts on the path of gaining strength. It’s most important to take one step at a time, otherwise, you’ll regret it forever!”

Yang Ye shrugged and said, “I knew it!”

“Quickly go on in! I’m really curious about why it’s looking for you!” said the little girl.

Yang Ye nodded. The tiny vortex had been residing within him for so long, and this was the first time it had taken the initiative to contact him, so even he wanted to know why it was summoning him!
