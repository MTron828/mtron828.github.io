Chapter 2446 – I’ll Kill You!

I’m afraid that I’ll kill you!

Yang Ye’s face darkened.

Can’t you say it in a nicer way? Saying that will easily incur hatred from her!Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Sure enough, as soon as An Nanjing finished speaking, Huang Cangyue’s face turned icy cold, and then she leaped up and appeared before An Nanjing!

Her fist shot forward!

It easily blasted open the space in the surroundings.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing’s spear moved abruptly.

Her spear shot forward!

A powerful and confident attack!

Everyone sensed great confidence coming from An Nanjing’s attack. It was invincible confidence, the confidence to crush her enemy with a single attack!

Bang!

An explosion resounded and Huang Cangyue was blasted 300m away.

As soon as she stopped herself, her arm exploded apart and transformed into a pile of blood! At the same time, the ground beneath her cracked open!

Everyone was shocked!

An Nanjing was actually so strong?

Even Yang Ye was shocked. While he hadn’t fought her, he knew that she was very strong. However, he hadn’t expected her to actually be this strong!

An Nanjing stood on the spot and glanced at Huang Cangyue, “You’re still too young!”

She entered the Primordial Pagoda once she finished speaking!

Too young!

Yang Ye shook his head. Actually, he was probably the only one here who really understood what An Nanjing meant. She meant that Huang Cangyue was a little young, and she wasn’t actually looking down on Huang Cangyue. If she looked down on a person, then based on An Nanjing’s character, she wouldn’t even say a word. Just as she’d said, Huang Cangyue really was a little young when compared to An Nanjing. Moreover, An Nanjing hadn’t just received the guidance of Wu Ni and Martial Ancestor, she’d received guidance from that mysterious spear-wielding middle aged man.

All of them weren’t ordinary!

Huang Cangyue revealed quite a ferocious expression. Obviously, she felt that An Nanjing was insulting her. So, she immediately leaped forward and charged at Yang Ye.

The powerful energy she emanated caused space to ripple violently!

Yang Ye frowned when he saw her attack him.

Suddenly, a powerful aura pressed down upon her and forced her to a stop.

A middle aged man appeared in front of Yang Ye. It was Sky Lord!

Sky Lord walked over to Huang Cangyue, “Can’t accept a defeat?”

Huang Cangyue spoke ferociously, “I haven’t lost! I…”

“Shut your mouth!” Sky Lord spoke abruptly in a domineering manner.

Huang Cangyue glanced at him and didn’t dare to talk back.

Sky Lord spoke indifferently, “You endured for so many years just to shock everyone, and I understand that. People like to be looked up to, and they want to be respected. But if you grow obsessed with that, it will do more harm than good.”

Huang Cangyue’s face was gloomy, and she remained silent.

Sky Lord shook his head and sighed, “The heavens gave you a great physique, but you do not cherish it!”

Huang Cangyue looked him in the eyes, “Sky Lord, I refuse to accept this. Why are you so sure that I’m no match for her? Just because I was at a momentary disadvantage?”

Sky Lord shook his head, “Comparing both of you is like comparing an adult to a child. She is right, you are a little too young.”

Huang Cangyue stared at him, “I want to fight her again. She can do as she pleases if I lose.”

Sky Lord fell silent for a short while and gazed at Yang Ye, “Young Brother Yang, can you ask Miss An to come outside for a spar? Just consider it as me owing both of you a favor!”

Yang Ye glanced at him. Obviously, Sky Lord wanted to help Huang Cangyue.

Yang Ye naturally wouldn’t refuse this favor. He nodded, and then An Nanjing appeared in front of him. Huang Cangyue immediately revealed a ferocious expression when she saw An Nanjing.

An Nanjing gazed at Huang Cangyue, “Attack me!”

Everyone else moved back and made space for them.

Huang Cangyue slowly clenched her fists.

Crack!

The space around her cracked open!

Strength!

Barbaric strength!

The Barbarian Physique had a type of strength with it, Barbaric Strength. It was strength that came naturally with the physique, and it was much more terrifying than the strength of some Primal Demons.

It was undeniable that there was no such thing as fairness at most times. Some people were born blessed.

Countless strands of Barbaric Energy converged within her, and it was like a volcano waiting to erupt. Just the pressure coming from it made some of the people here feel slightly suffocated!

In the Primordial Pagoda and on the Ascension Platform.

Erya sat on the platform as she looked up into the sky and licked her tanghulu. A short while passed before she suddenly said, “Snowy, I want to eat that woman!”

Snowy blinked and raised her paws. Obviously, she was asking why.

Erya sneaked a glance at the surroundings and whispered, “Snowy, let me tell you a secret!”

Snowy blinked, floated over to Erya, and perked up her ears.

Erya seemed to have thought of something and said, “You can’t tell anyone about it!”

Snowy hurriedly nodded.

Erya shot another glance at the surroundings, and when she noticed no one, she said, “Snowy, I really want to eat her because her body is unlike other ordinary people. Big Sister An too. I’ve wanted to eat her on many occasions. My intuition tells me that if I eat her, I’ll definitely grow even stronger! Besides that, there’s also Big Sister Xiu. I think she’s really delicious too, and Big Brother Yang is another!”

Snowy was stunned for quite some time, and then she placed her paw on Erya’s forehead.

She doesn’t have a fever!

Erya rolled her eyes, “I’m not lying. I really want to eat them. But I can’t! Firstly, I’m no match for all of them! Especially Big Sister Xiu and An. They are so terrifying. I can only think about it, but I dare not take action! Right, if it’s Big Brother Yang, I may succeed if I risk my life against him. But he’s Big Brother Yang, so even if I can defeat him, I can’t eat him! Sigh, this is so painful!”

Snowy thought for a moment, and then she withdrew a tanghulu and passed it to Erya. She was telling Erya that she should just eat more tanghulus!

Erya was filled with sorrow and despair!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

After she converged countless strands of Barbaric Energy, she leaped up and charged at An Nanjing.

The powerful energy contained within her collapsed space in her wake. At the same time, a wave of powerful pressure slammed against An Nanjing before she arrived.

An Nanjing’s face remained indifferent as she took a step forward, and then she stabbed her spear at Huang Cangyue!

It was a very ordinary stab without any flashy moves, and it didn’t cause any fluctuations or phenomena to occur!

It was just a simple stab of the spear!

However, it was such a simple stab that obliterated all the pressure coming from Huang Cangyue! Meanwhile, Huang Cangyue’s fist arrived!

The fist and spear collided!

Boom!

The space in a huge area shook and started to crack open!

Sky Lord frowned slightly and waved his right hand, causing the surrounding space to instantly return to normal!

An Nanjing and Huang Cangyue were still in a deadlock!

A wisp of ferocity flashed through Huang Cangyue’s eyes, and the Barbaric Energy within her surged madly into her right hand before surging along her right arm.

However, An Nanjing still didn’t move at all!

Madness and ferocity covered Huang Cangyue’s face as she twisted her right hand.

Bang!

An Nanjing was pushed around 10 steps back!

At this moment, An Nanjing suddenly frowned. She released her spear, pressed forward, and slammed a punch at Huang Cangyue. It slammed directly against Huang Cangyue’s face!

Bang!

Blood sprayed!

Huang Cangyue was pushed backward, and An Nanjing grabbed the moment she was being pushed back to grab Huang Cangyue’s right hand, and the latter wasn’t even able to react before An Nanjing pulled with her right hand. Huang Cangyue was instantly pulled forward, and then a knee slammed against her stomach.

Huang Cangyue’s figure curled forward while a mouthful of blood sprayed from her!

However, that wasn’t the end of it. At the instant An Nanjing’s knee slammed against her stomach, An Nanjing suddenly spun around, and her right elbow slammed against Huang Cangyue’s face.

Bam!

Huang Cangyue was blasted away while an arc of blood sprayed through the air.

Meanwhile, a spear appeared in An Nanjing’s grasp, and she was about to hurl it. If she did that, it was obvious that Huang Cangyue, who was unconscious now, wouldn’t be able to avoid death!

However, Sky Lord suddenly said, “Miss An, please show mercy!”

An Nanjing movement stopped, and then she put the spear away and walked over to Yang Ye, “Was that amazing?”

Yang Ye gave her two thumbs up!

Amazing!

Truly amazing!

That was what Yang Ye really felt!

An Nanjing grinned, and Yang Ye was stunned by this. He hadn’t been able to see that smile to his satisfaction as she’d immediately entered the Primordial Pagoda right after.

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Meanwhile, Huang Cangyue laid on the ground with a blank expression on her face. She muttered as if she’d lost her soul, “Impossible… Impossible…”

She’d lost!

She’d completely lost!

She didn’t even have the ability to fight back against An Nanjing!

Was she weak?

Meanwhile, Sky Lord walked over to her, “Is the Barbarian Physique very amazing? It isn’t, not even in the slightest. You must understand that it’s the person itself that’s amazing, and if you don’t work hard and fight for it, even an invincible physique would be useless. The gap between the two of you isn’t in natural talent or resources, it’s a gap in your mentality. Simply speaking, she's a tiger in the forest, and you’re a tiger raised at home. While you’re both tigers, your experience, mental states, and strength are far apart.”

Huang Cangyue was stunned for a long time. Suddenly, she gazed at the Sky Lord, “I refuse to accept this!”

Sky Lord frowned.

Suddenly, a sword pressed against her forehead, and it pierced into her skin, causing blood to flow.

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye because he was holding that sword.

Yang Ye ignored them and gazed at Huang Cangyue, “You refuse to accept it? If it wasn’t out of consideration for Sky Lord, she would have killed you by now. Yet you still refuse to accept it? Fuck you! Come, you can fight me. I don’t have any physique, but I guarantee that I’ll kill you!”
