Chapter 2647 – I Want to Make a Report!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to cut off the Nether Lord’s head!

Yang Ye held the Nether Lord’s head while a fountain of blood surged from the headless corpse!

Yang Ye tossed the head aside and looked up at the sky. Meanwhile, a huge pitch black mouth appeared abruptly, and then a shrill cry resounded.

It was over!

The Divine Abode’s master glanced at Yang Ye and Sky Maiden, and then he said, “Let’s go.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and vanished with the others.

Only Yang Ye and Sky Maiden remained in the sky.

Sky Maiden went over to Yang Ye, and then she entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye hurriedly followed after her.

On the Ascension Platform.

Yang Ye and Sky Maiden gazed silently at Nether Maiden and the others’ souls.

Meanwhile, Snowy came to Yang Ye and Sky Maiden, and she waved her paws to say that their souls were fine.

Sky Maiden gazed at Yang Ye and remained silent.

Yang Ye lowered his head slightly, “It’s my fault.”

While he had a huge temper and was very stubborn, he had no temper before some people.

Sky Maiden gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “I don’t blame you, so don’t blame yourself.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Eldest Sister, you definitely want to beat me up!”

Sky Maiden closed her eyes slowly, “They are my sisters, and as far as I’m concerned, your place in my heart is equal to them. I’m very happy knowing that you didn’t go straight to look for them and came to me first. You’re not the child you used to be.”

She gazed at Nether Maiden and the others, “Let’s just let this matter go now.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “How can we?!”

Sky Maiden gazed at Yang Ye, “What can you do about it? Seek revenge? I want to slaughter them more than you do, but are the two of us even enough?”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Then should we just forget it?”

She shook her head, “Even if you wish to seek revenge, it requires strength, and you don’t have that strength. So, leave with them and go into hiding…”

“No!” Yang Ye suddenly shook his head, “I won’t hide!”

He gazed at Nether Maiden and the others, “Once I’ve made arrangements for them, I’ll go play with those bastards.”

Sky Maiden shook her head slightly, “Can’t you become truly mature?”

Yang Ye cracked a smile, “Eldest Sister, you know… they went too far. In the Origin World, they wanted to kill me, Tian Xiu, and Qi Bitian. Now, they almost killed Nether Maiden and the others. Why? Because they think Tian Xiu and Qi Bitian aren’t here anymore, so I’m fucking easy to bully, and they can do as they please to me.”

Sky Maiden spoke indifferently, “Aren’t you easy to bully?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I know. However, I won’t run from them. If worse comes to worse, we can all die together!”

Sky Maiden walked over to Yang Ye, “You don’t have the ability to take them down with you!”

Yang Ye looked down, “Eldest Sister, just ignore this matter.”

Sky Maiden closed her eyes slightly, “Listen, my desire for revenge is greater than yours, but your greatest mission right now is to survive, and survive well. Only by surviving can you take revenge. Besides that, Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu aren’t here, and I can’t fight ten experts on my own. So, if you’re surrounded and ganged up on, no one can save you. Understand?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I know.”

Sky Maiden asked, “Are you still going to seek revenge now?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Yes!”

Sky Maiden gazed at him for a long time and said, “I want to slap you!”

Yang Ye cracked a smile, “Eldest Sister, don’t worry, I won’t do something stupid like give my life away. I don’t seem like an idiot, right? As you’ve said, I’ll survive as I take revenge.”

Sky Maiden rubbed Yang Ye’s head and said, “It’s best if you and all of them stay alive.”

She gazed at Nether Maiden and the others, “Take good care of them. I won’t be able to come outside again for some time.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She replied softly, “I made an agreement with someone in the Void World, and I must complete it. Don’t ask what it is. Your job right now is to take good care of them and yourself.”

She glanced at Nether Maiden and the others once more before leaving the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye left after her.

Sky Maiden glanced at the surroundings, and her gaze gradually turned icy cold, “This place has no need to exist anymore.”

As soon as she said that, a huge mouth suddenly appeared above the Nether World, and then it started to be devoured bit by bit.

Meanwhile, Sky Maiden grabbed Yang Ye’s arm and vanished on the spot.

Eternal Border.

She put Yang Ye down and gazed at him for a long time, “I can’t stop you, but I don’t want to hear that you’ve been killed.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t worry, I’ll definitely live well.”

She rubbed his head again, “Survive! I’ll conclude my business in the Void World as soon as possible!”

She turned around and vanished into the sky.

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he looked to the side. A black clothed figure soundlessly appeared there.

The black clothed man asked, “Brother Yang, what do you plan to do now?”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “Get even with them, of course!”

The black clothed man shook his head, “Allow me to be honest, you’re unable to fight them right now. Unless the Abyss Lord or Miss Tian Xiu show themselves, otherwise…”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand. So, how about we still cooperate from now on. But you don’t have to send Destiny Realm experts to help me, and you only have to provide me with information.”

The black clothed man fell silent.

Yang Ye smiled, “I want to give it a try. If I succeed, I’ll still fulfill your previous request. All you have to do in return is provide me with information, and you don’t have to take any risks!”

The black clothed man fell silent for a long time. In the end, he nodded, “Alright.”

As he spoke, he flicked a pitch black rock over to Yang Ye.

The black clothed man said, “It’s a transmission rock. If you want to know something, use it, and we’ll immediately tell you what we know, or we’ll investigate if we don’t.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Thank you.”

The black clothed man hesitated for a moment and said, “Take care.”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure gradually turned ethereal and vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye left, but he stopped just a moment after.

He’d planned on finding a place to hide Nether Maiden and the others, but he realized that there didn’t seem to be a single place in the universe that was safe for him. The experts of the End World were extraordinary existences, so where could he possibly hide them?

Nowhere was safe!

In the end, Yang Ye shook his head and chuckled. It was best to keep them in the Primordial Pagoda. There was Primordial Violet Energy and Snowy in there, so their souls would recover much faster.

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to decide on this.

Yang Ye was about to leave when a sword howl suddenly resounded, and then an old man in a plain robe appeared before Yang Ye.

It was Jian Wudi!

Jian Wudi glanced at Yang Ye and said, “You’re planning on going to the End World?”

Yang Ye nodded.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wudi spoke coldly, “To die?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Jian Wudi said, “Fuck off as far away as you can!”

He transformed into a ray of sword energy that vanished into the sky.

Yang Ye gazed at the boundless sky, and there was a long mark from a sword there. It seemed like a rift had been sliced open in the sky.

Yang Ye sat down.

Sky Maiden asked him not to take revenge, and his ancestor had done the same.

He didn’t think that he was wrong, but he wasn’t very willing to just give up. Even though he was incapable of fighting them, was he supposed to just let the matter rest? And then start fleeing madly?

Flee?

Where would he flee to?

To Four Dimensional Space? Otherwise, where could he run in Three Dimensional Space? Where would there be a place for him?

Or perhaps he should just run for as long as he could?

Yang Ye shook his head.

No!

He didn’t want to flee. Yes, he was being quite overconfident and courting death, but it was better than living as a coward!

Yang Ye stood up and took a deep breath.

A ferocious smile curled up on his face, “I’ll fight you to the death!”

Yang Ye withdrew Executor and glanced at the surroundings, “I know you’re nearby. Show yourself. I have something to discuss with you.”

There was no movement in the surroundings.

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “You refuse to speak with me?”

There was still no movement in the surroundings.

Yang Ye fell silent for a short moment and walked away. Suddenly, a woman appeared ahead.

A woman in a white dress!

It was One!

She squatted down and touched the river water gently, “What do you wish to speak about?”

He walked over to her, “I want to see the woman in black. Oh, I mean the other you who wears black!”

She asked, “Why?”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “I want to make a report!”

“A report?” She stopped what she was doing and looked up at him, “What do you want to report?”

Yang Ye pointed at the sky, “Doesn’t she specialize in killing Destiny Realm experts? I want to report the End World. There are numerous Destiny Realm experts there. It’s alright if she can’t sense them because I can take her there. If she's busy, you can take me to your other two forms. I can take them there too. They’ve been running for a long time, and we can’t let them run free in the outside world.”

She gazed at him in silence.
