Chapter 1898 – Royal Crocodile!

Nansi Yin sized up Yang Ye and asked, “Who are you?”

Yang Ye didn’t answer her. He just closed his eyes and immersed his consciousness into the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, do you recognize the beast on that jade pendant?”

The Primordial Pagoda had refused to let it come in, and it made Yang Ye extremely puzzled. It was very strange, extremely even.

Hou Qing shook his head and gazed at Qiong Qi.

Yang Ye gazed at Qiong Qi as well. Qiong Qi was from the demon race, and the beast on the jade pendant was clearly a demon beast. Even if it wasn’t, it was definitely related to demon beasts.

Qiong Qi fell silent for a long time before he asked, “It was with that little girl?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Qiong Qi spoke solemnly, “If I’m not wrong, it should be a very ferocious demon beast from the ancient times, the Royal Crocodile!”

“The Royal Crocodile?” Yang Ye and Hou Qing exchanged glances, and then they gazed at Qiong Qi.

Qiong Qi spoke solemnly, “The Royal Crocodile was born during the ancient times, and it fed on dragons and phoenixes. It was born ferocious and violent. Besides a few demon beasts, no other demon beast from the ancient times dared to offend it. However, for some reason, the Royal Crocodiles started to gradually vanish. Now…”

They fed on dragons and phoenixes!

Yang Ye’s eyelids couldn’t help but twitch when he heard this. That was amazing! Moreover, based on how Qiong Qi looked, he was clearly quite afraid of the Royal Crocodiles. So, what was Zhi’er’s identity?

Yang Ye didn’t linger on the question. The important matter at hand for him was to go to Broken Cliff Mountain!

In the world outside, Yang Ye opened his eyes and gazed at Nansi Yin, “Let’s go!”

A ray of light flashed beneath his feet, and he transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

Nansi Yin fell silent for a short while and suddenly chuckled, “Mysterious, truly mysterious. However, that makes it interesting!”

A multicolored glow appeared below her feet, and then a dazzling rainbow appeared in the horizon while Nansi Yin had vanished.

As he shot forward swiftly on his sword, Yang Ye gained a rough understanding of the Human Dimension from Nansi Yin.

The Human Dimension was divided into five prefectures: the Southern Unicorn Prefecture, the Northern Sky Prefecture, the Eastern Abyss Prefecture, Western Coral Prefecture, and Central Prefecture! The five prefectures were guarded by five supreme experts of the human race, and the Sovereign of Man was guarding the Central Prefecture and possessed authority over the entire dimension.

Besides the five prefectures, there were three hallowed grounds and ten paradises.

The three hallowed grounds had the highest status. Because even the Sovereign of Man couldn’t order them around.

At this moment, Yang Ye had an understanding of the forces under the Sovereign of Man’s disposal. It was a colossus, a true colossus.

The Sovereign of Man’s strength was definitely at the peak of the Human Dimension. Besides that, he had countless experts under his command like the four kings of the other four prefectures. They were peerless experts too.

At this moment, Yang Ye understood why the Sovereign of Man didn’t come personally!

He was just that confident!

This time, Yang Ye and Nansi Yin’s destination was the Northern Sky Prefecture. Its strength was merely inferior to the Central Prefecture because it was the entrance to the Human Dimension, and a powerful enemy of the human race, the shaman race, was just beyond it!

As for where they were right now, it was the Southern Unicorn Prefecture!

Based on what Nansi Yin told him, it would take them at least two weeks to get there at their current speed!

Two weeks!

How fast was he right now? Traveling 5,000km in an instant wasn’t a problem at all. However, it would still take him two weeks to get to the Northern Sky Prefecture, so it showed how huge the world was.

“Stop flying!” Suddenly, Nansi Yin spoke abruptly.

Yang Ye turned to look at her, and she pointed down, “See that? There’s a city down there, and it definitely sells flying transports. We can get one. Otherwise, we’ll get tired to death if we keep flying like this!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded. Even though he had sufficient energy pearls, he didn’t want to exhaust himself like that. After all, it wasn’t for just a day or two; it was for two weeks. If they had a flying transport to carry them all the way, he could enter the Primordial Pagoda and cultivate!

They descended to the ground. Yang Ye looked up and saw three large golden words above the city gates: Blue Mist City.

The city wasn’t very big, but it was very old.

Nansi Yin said, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye glanced at her. He couldn’t figure out what she actually wanted. Because up until now, no one had come looking for trouble with them. Obviously, she had definitely done something, and that was why.

So, why was she following him? Was she really just curious about him? Or because she thought it was fun?

Yang Ye shook his head and stopped thinking about it. He followed her into the city.

Yang Ye sized up the surroundings with a curious gaze. Actually, there wasn’t a huge difference between the upper and lower universes. It was the people, the same sky, the same ground… If one insisted on pointing out something different, then it was obviously that the people here were much stronger.

Because since he entered the city, the weakest amongst the cultivators Yang Ye saw was at the Exalt Realm, and even a child around the age of 10 was at the Exalt Realm!

They started at quite a high level of cultivation!

Suddenly, Nansi Yin’s voice resounded, “Hurry up!”

Yang Ye nodded and sped up. It didn’t take long for them to stop, and a pavilion was before them. It had seven levels and covered a huge area of land.

Yang Ye looked up, and he saw three dazzling words at the top of it: Sky Treasure Pavilion!

“Its owner is extraordinary!” Meanwhile, Nansi Yin suddenly said, “It’s someone that even the three hallowed grounds have to give face to! Let’s go!”

Nansi Yin led him in, and it didn’t take long for a young man to greet them. He was about to speak when Nansi Yin withdrew a golden card, and it made the young man’s expression change.

The young man bowed respectfully to her and said, “Honored Guest, please wait a moment!”

He turned around and entered the inner area of the pavilion.

Meanwhile, Nansi Yin waved the golden card at Yang Ye and smiled, “A VIP Card of the Sky Treasure Pavilion, a gold one too. Right, there’s a violet card above the gold card, and then there’s nothing above that!”

Yang Ye asked, “What are you trying to say?”

She shook her head, “What a blockhead. Do you know how difficult it is to become a VIP of the Sky Treasure Pavilion, and especially a gold one?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t know!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Nansi Yin was about to say something when a pretty woman in a green dress walked out from the inner area of the pavilion. She walked over to Nansi Yin and smiled, “I didn’t expect an honored guest to come to such a remote place! I’m Mingshui, the manager here. If it’s within my ability, I won’t refuse any request!”

Nansi Yin said, “I need a Sound Shuttle! Right now!”

A Sound Shuttle!

Mingshui was slightly stunned, and then she seemed quite hesitant.

Nansi Yin frowned, “What is it?”

Mingshui replied, “The only Sound Shuttle in the city has been booked, and the customer has paid the deposit. I can’t cancel it for no reason. So, how about I prepare a Cloud Shuttle for you?”

“A Cloud Shuttle?” Nansi Yin shook her head, “It’s too slow!”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “How slow?”

Nansi Yin replied, “It’ll take at least a month to go where you want!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “That’s too slow! Are there any other merchant groups in the city?”

Mingshui’s expression changed slightly when she heard Yang Ye, and then she hurriedly said, “I apologize. How about I ask the closest city to send a Sound Shuttle over there?”

Nansi Yin asked, “How long will it take?”

Mingshui replied, “Two days at least!”

Nansi Yin gazed at Yang Ye, and he shook his head, “I’ll travel myself!”

He turned around and walked away.

Nansi Yin hurriedly stopped him and said, “Don’t do that. I’ll try to get a Sound Shuttle!”

Yang Ye could endure it, but she couldn’t.

Yang Ye was about to speak when Mingshui suddenly asked, “Where are you going?”

Yang Ye replied, “The Northern Sky Prefecture!”

Mingshui smiled, “It just so happens that the other customer is heading in that direction too. So, how about you ride the same Sound Shuttle?”

Nansi Yin gazed at Yang Ye. Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and nodded.

Ming Shui walked towards the side, “Follow me!”

Yang Ye and Nansi Yin followed Mingshui high above the clouds, and there was a colossus hidden there. It was the Cloud Shuttle. It was shaped like a ship, but there was a difference. Both ends of it were extremely sharp!

Meanwhile, a woman walked out of it. She was around the age of 20 and wore a cloud white dress. She couldn’t be called very beautiful, but she wasn’t ugly either. She seemed extremely gentle and delicate.

There was a small black bird on her shoulder.

Mingshui walked over to the woman and said a few words. In the end, the woman glanced at Yang Ye and Nansi Yin before nodding.

Mingshui visibly relaxed when she witnessed this, and then she gazed at Yang Ye and Nansi Yin, “Please come in!”

They nodded and flew up into the Sound Shuttle.

The woman grinned at them. Yang Ye was about to speak when a chill suddenly ran down his spine!

It just happened out of nowhere!
