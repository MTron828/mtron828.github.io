Chapter 928 – I’ll Kill Anyone Who Dares To Riot!

Feng Wuchao and the others were furious. They were about to attack, but Yang Ye waved his hand and stopped them.

Yang Ye paid no attention to the young man, and he gazed at Yu Wushuang instead, “See that? That’s the type of people we’re protecting. Of course, not all of them are like that, but I dare guarantee that at least more than 50 or 60% of them are like that. Not only do they show no gratitude for our protection, they even feel that it’s our academy’s duty to do so. Moreover, once we fail to defend the city, they’ll stand out and blame us. Just like he did....”

Yu Wushuang clenched her fists and remained silent.

“You....” The young man intended to continue, but he didn’t have the chance. Because a ray of light had passed through his throat, and then a pillar of blood blasted his head into the air.

After he killed the young man, Yang Ye shot his gaze towards the group of people and said, “Is there anyone else who’s of the same mind as him? You can voice your opinion. Don’t worry, my sword is very swift. You’ll absolutely not feel even a trace of pain before you die.”

All of them were horrified, and they subconsciously moved backwards repeatedly.

Yang Ye chuckled, “Are there no more? Since there are none, then fuck off.”

Their expressions changed. After all, the wolves were not too far behind them, so how could they dare to leave?

Yang Ye’s face turned icy cold when he saw them remain on the spot, “Do you want me to make you leave? I’ll warn you in advance. If I do it, then I wouldn’t be driving you away, I’ll be making you leave this world.”

Meanwhile, a middle aged man suddenly stepped forward, and he gazed at Yang Ye and said, “We’re all humans. You don’t have to leave us with no way to survive, right?”

“Exactly.... We’re all humans in the end. Now that the demon beasts have breached the city, then we shouldn’t be killing each other. We should join forces against our enemies....”

“Let’s join forces against our enemies. Seniors of the Ocean of Clouds Academy, please lead us in battle against the demon beasts!”

After the demon beasts slaughtered their way through the city, many had finally realized how terrifying the demon beasts were. Even though they were selfish, they were no fools. They naturally had to hold on tight onto someone strong like Yang Ye while in such a situation. After all, wasn’t it obvious that the demon beasts didn’t dare to do anything while standing before Yang Ye and the others?

Yang Ye asked, “All of you want to join forces with us against the demon beasts?”

They quickly nodded upon hearing him.

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright. However, all of you better remember that we’re defending the city and not all of you. We have no obligation to risk our lives for all of you. If you want to life, then you have to rely on yourself. Besides that, you must obey our orders if you intend to join us. If you can’t, then you can leave right now. I will definitely not stop you. But if you join us and dare to play tricks or disobey our orders, then even if the demon beasts don’t kill all of you, I will!”

Their expressions changed slightly when they heard Yang Ye. Even though they were quite displeased, none of them dared to say anything. They had the feeling that this outer court instructor who stood before them was even more terrifying than the demon beasts!

Yang Ye gazed at Yu Wushuang and said, “Make arrangements for them!”

Yu Wushuang nodded. She glanced at Yang Ye and wanted to say something. However, Shang Qingying suddenly tore through space and appeared in front of Yang Ye.

Shang Qingying stared fixedly at him and seemed to be angry, “What are you doing!?”

Yang Ye grinned, “Do you think we can counterattack Welkin Wolf Mountain Range if we gather the cultivators of the entire city?”

Shang Qingying was shocked, “You....”

Yang Ye continued, “Right, it is quite difficult. But that’s fine. It’s still worth a try. Miss Shang, from this moment onward, all the forces at all 4 city gates, and even all the students and you will obey my orders. Alright?”

Yang Ye was no fool. He knew that he couldn’t realize his plans on his own. After all, the slightest mistake might cause the order throughout the entire city to be destroyed. At that time, not to mention him, even the dean would be powerless to turn the situation around. So, he had to gain the full support of the academy’s forces!

Only by getting them to fully support him would it be possible for him to converge all the cultivators in the city and fight collectively against the demon beast!

Shang Qingying gazed at him for a short while before she said, “Are you sure you want to do this?”

“We don’t have any choice!” Yang Ye looked her in the eyes and said, “Even if our backup from the Ancient Sword School arrives, we’ll only be able to hold on for a while longer. The only way to truly repulse the wolf army from Welkin Wolf Mountain Range is to converge the strength of the entire city. Otherwise, we’ll be unable to prevent the city from being breached in the end, and we won’t be able to prevent the horrible deaths of countless people. Of course, you can entrust your hopes on the dean and the others as well. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like they have the ability to pay any attention to us. Otherwise, they would have shown themselves when I slaughtered the secret court!”

Shang Qingying spoke solemnly, “But if we make even a single mistake and someone fan’s the flames, then the entire city will fall into chaos!”

Yang Ye replied, “Severe punishment should be used during troubled times. I’ll kill anyone who dares to fan the flames of anger, and I’ll kill anyone who dares to riot!”

Shang Qingying said, “Once the entire city falls into chaos, then countless people will be causing trouble. There are almost 100 million people in the city. Can you even kill them all?”

“I can’t!” Yang Ye pointed at the wolf army, “But they can.”

“You!” Shang Qingying was horrified, and she gazed at Yang Ye for a long time in silence.

Yang Ye said, “Miss Shang, there’s not much time left, so make your decision. Let me warn you in advance. If the city is breached, it isn’t impossible for me to seize the opportunity created by the chaos to take the students of the outer court with me and leave.”

A long moment of silence ensued, and then Shang Qingying took a deep breath and said, “We’ll go along with your plan! You madman!”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “From this moment onwards, the forces at all 4 city gates are prohibited from protecting anyone within the city unless I give the order. If anyone from the city dares to approach the city gates, then kill them without mercy!” When he spoke up to this point, Yang Ye gazed at Shang Qingying and said, “Miss Shang, remember that you must kill without mercy. If you show even the slightest benevolence at a time like this, then it’ll only bring harm to the entire city.”

Shang Qingying gazed at him for a long time, and then she said, “You’ll offend a huge amount of people. Especially the clans in the city.”

Yang Ye replied, “How do those clans compare to the Dao Order?”

The corners of her eyelids twitched upon hearing that. This time, she didn’t waste her breath and just vanished on the spot.

After all, Yang Ye had even dared to offend the Dao Order, so how could he possibly fear those clans who were far inferior to the Dao Order?

“Many within the city have started to join forces!” Meanwhile, Yu Wushuang walked over to Yang Ye’s side and said, “Sure enough, humans only work together when they face danger. To be honest, if humans are able to join forces and become truly united, then there would probably be no demon race throughout Pine Prefecture.”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Regardless of whether it’s the human race or demon race, we’re all using this world to survive. Actually, I’d rather live with demon beasts than humans. Because demon beasts won’t play tricks and schemes against you. If they like you, then they like you; and if they don’t like you, then they don’t like you. They aren’t like humans who act like friends to you, but then stab you in the back....”

Yu Wushuang suddenly said, “If a full-scale war were to erupt between the demon race and human race in the future, then which side would you take?”

Yang Ye replied, “If the demon beasts want to kill me, then I’ll kill them; and if the humans want to kill me, then I won’t hold back either.”

Yu Wushuang nodded, “I see!”

Meanwhile, Hao Shuaibo suddenly arrived before Yang Ye and Yu Wushuang, and he said, “Young Miss Wushuang, Instructor Ye, many people within the city have formed small groups to fight against the demon beasts. Presently, almost all of the demon beasts have been annihilated. Should we contact them and ask them to fight the wolf army with us now?”

Yang Ye grinned, “They still wouldn’t pay any attention to you if you were to contact them now.”

Yu Wushuang nodded, “They’ve temporarily put aside their own selfish interests for the sake of their survival. However, once the sense of danger is gone, then their selfish nature will appear once more. If we are to go contact them now, then they would definitely start negotiating with us or completely disregard us.”

Hao Shuaibo shook his head, “That’s foolish of them!”

Yu Wushuang nodded in agreement. If it was anyone else who was tasked with defending the city, then those fellows in the city might have really been able to relax safely within the city, and it would even be to the extent that they could negotiate for compensation with the academy. Unfortunately, it was Yang Ye who was defending the city.

Would Yang Ye negotiate with them?

Hao Shuaibo said, “Then what should we do now? The grand formations on the city walls are about to collapse. We’ll truly be finished if this continues!”

Yang Ye turned around to gaze at the army of wolves, and quite some time passed before he suddenly said, “Open the gates!”

As soon as he spoke, a gap was immediately opened in the gates, and it didn’t take long for countless demon beasts to surge into the city.

Almost 20,000 demon beasts had surged into the city within 10 breaths of time!

“Close the gates!” As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, numerous strands of sword energy slashed down from above the wall, and it instantly formed a barrier of sword energy before the city gates and obstructed the wolves that intended to charge into the city.

Within the city.

20,000 demon wolves had charged into the city, and the entire city was instantly filled with clamorous noises!
