Chapter 631 – Accumulating Energy!

Mo Yixie’s aura instantly changed when he held the throwing knife in his hand. At this moment, he was like a towering pillar that made others unable to arouse the intention to even try and shake him.

He’s accumulating energy!

Countless people in the surroundings were astounded. Because accumulating the energy of the world was something that only Monarch Realm experts could accomplish. However, this young man before them wasn’t a Monarch Realm expert!

“He isn’t at the Monarch Realm yet possesses the ability of Monarch Realm experts!” Ding Shaoyao had an extremely solemn expression on her face. Because the geniuses of the Hallowed Grounds were already capable of surmounting their realms of cultivation to do battle. She would be extremely confident in Yang Ye if Yang Ye’s opponent was in the same realm of cultivation, but the young man was equivalent to a Monarch Realm expert now. So, Ding Shaoyao’s confidence was shaken when she realized that Yang Ye had to surmount his realm of cultivation and fight a peerless genius who could do the same, and it was even after Yang Ye’s realm of cultivation had fallen!

“Senior Brother has become even stronger!” Zhen Ling’s eyes glowed unusually when she felt the aura that Mo Yixie emanated.

Zhen Yun nodded and said, “Our team leader wouldn’t be able to resist a single attack from him if it was a frontal battle. However, if our team leader was given the time to set up formations, then even 5 of him wouldn’t be a match for our team leader. Unfortunately, Team Leader has run off somewhere. Otherwise, Yang Ye will definitely die before their joint forces!”

Zhen Ling suddenly said, “Could Team Leader have come to Profounder Continent as well?”

Zhen Yun was stunned, and then he couldn’t help but chuckle, “How could that be possible?”

Mo Yixie held the knife in his hand as he gazed at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, this strike of mine has never missed. Even if it was utilized against those freaks at the top 5 positions of the Hallowed Rankings. I admit defeat if you’re able to dodge it.”

Dodge it? Yang Ye shook his head. He was very clearly aware that he couldn’t, and it was impossible even if his speed was 10 times faster. There was no reason for this, and it was merely a feeling he had. Fortunately, he’d never thought of avoiding it.

“Go!” As soon as he shouted, the throwing knife in his hand flew out of his grasp. It was very slow, extremely slow. It was slow to the point that even a young child could dodge it with ease. However, the expressions of all the comparatively stronger experts here had changed upon witnessing this scene.

It wasn’t really slow. It was swift. It was slowness that was revealed from extreme speed....

If Yao Ye’s speed could be compared to the speed of sound, then Mo Yixie’s speed was the speed of light! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye took a step forward when Mo Yixie’s throwing knife flew forward, and he activated the Sword Domain. As soon as the Sword Domain appeared, Mo Yixie’s knife didn’t slow down at all, and it sped up instead. In just an instant, it had become so swift that everyone couldn’t even catch sight of it.

However, Ding Shaoyao and the others heaved sighs of relief instead because the speed of Mo Yixie’s knife had returned to normal upon suffering the suppression of Yang Ye’s Sword Domain.

The Sword Domain!

The expressions of Mo Yixie and the others changed. It was especially so for Zhen Ling and Zhen Yun because they hadn’t expected that Yang Ye had actually comprehended the Sword Domain! The Sword Domain and Heaven Realm Sword Intent....

Both of them were shocked to the limit!

“The Sword Domain as expected. I truly never imagined that something even the geniuses of my Hallowed Grounds couldn’t comprehend would actually have been comprehended by a profounder from Profounder Continent. What an insult to my Hallowed Grounds. Unfortunately, it’s obvious that you don’t know how to utilize it. Otherwise, I would turn around and flee immediately. Horizon Warp!” Mo Yixie’s voice suddenly resounded before he actually appeared behind the throwing knife, and then he took it by the hilt.

“Go!” As soon as his voice resounded, the throwing knife transformed into a ray of light that shot out from his palm. The throwing knife’s speed actually slowed down once more after it left his grasp, and a trace of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth. Obviously, even he’d suffered a severe injury from forcefully utilizing his speed and strength within Yang Ye’s Sword Domain.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He hadn’t expected that Mo Yixie would actually be able to launch another attack within his Sword Domain. Could I have really not grasped the true strength of the Sword Domain? Yang Ye was quite doubtful at this moment. He didn’t doubt the Sword Domain’s strength, and he only doubted his method of utilization.

Since he comprehended the Sword Domain, it seemed to be only capable of suppressing and restraining his enemies just like his Sword Intent, but it was just stronger than Sword Intent.... Based on his own thoughts and what Mo Yixie had just said, he was even more certain that he hadn’t grasped the true method to utilize his Sword Domain. This made him feel very helpless and depressed because besides the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor, no one throughout Profounder Continent had comprehended the Sword Domain.

So, he didn’t know how to utilize it properly, or to be more precise, he didn’t know what abilities the Sword Domain possessed!

Yang Ye shook his head and discarded these distracting thoughts before he stretched out his hand and grasped. As soon as he made this grasping motion, a sword had appeared in his hand. The sword wasn’t the wooden sword or the Sword Ruler. It was a sword that was condensed from Sword Intent!

It had materialized! It was true materialization of Sword Intent!

“Slash!” As soon as he shouted, Yang Ye swung it downward.

The Intent Sword collided forcefully against Mo Yixie’s throwing knife, but no sound resounded from the collision because it had occurred within his Sword Domain. As soon as they came into contact, a moment of stillness ensued before Yang Ye’s Intent Sword and Mo Yixie’s throwing knife started to crack at the same time, and just less than 2 breaths passed before both shattered before the eyes of everyone!

But in the next moment, Yang Ye grasped once more and the shattered Intent Sword suddenly converged together into a new sword!

The profounders from the southern territory heaved sighs of relief when they witnessed this scene, and they seemed to be overjoyed. Because even though Yang Ye’s cultivation had fallen to the first rank of the Exalt Realm, his strength was much stronger!

Mo Yixie’s pupils constricted as he said, “Slaughter Sword Intent, Annihilation Sword Intent, Wither Sword Intent.... How could this be possible!? Your Sword Intent actually contains so many types of Sword Intent! How could this be possible!?” Mo Yixie suddenly gazed at Zhen Yun when he spoke up to this point, and he said, “Take your younger sister with you and leave. Quickly! Head back and ask those freaks in the top 6 to come here. Tell them that I, Mo Yixie, was no match for him!”

He wouldn’t fear Yang Ye if Yang Ye merely possessed 1st level Heaven Realm Sword Intent. However, Yang Ye’s Sword Intent wasn’t ordinary 1st level Heaven Realm Sword Intent because it was a mix of too many types of Sword Intents. Coupled with the Sword Domain that Yang Ye possessed, the might of Mo Yixie’s throwing knife had been greatly reduced. So, it was impossible for him to defeat Yang Ye now!”

Zhen Yun was stunned. He stared blankly at Mo Yixie for a while. Senior Brother is admitting defeat just like that? As far as he was concerned, his senior brother was an existence who could challenge Monarch Realm experts! Could it be that Yang Ye’s strength is even more formidable than a Monarch Realm expert?

“What the fuck are you still standing there for!?” Mo Yixie shouted, “Quickly take her and leave!”

Zhen Yun suddenly recovered from his shock, and then he pulled Zhen Ling along as he flashed off explosively towards the distance.

“Don’t even think of leaving!” Right at this moment, Yang Ye’s voice resounded, and then 2 strands of Sword Intent transformed into rays of light that shot towards the pair of siblings. They were extremely swift and had practically instantly caught up to Zhen Yun and Zhen Ling.

After all, Yang Ye would never show mercy to members of the Hallowed Grounds.

Hiss!

However, 2 rays of white light suddenly flashed, and then Yang Ye’s Sword Intent were blasted into pieces. But in the next moment, they’d converged and condensed once more into form.

But Zhen Ling and Zhen Yun were long gone.

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and looked at Mo Yixie as he said, “You didn’t choose to flee. Looks like you’re very confident. Since you are, then it’s your turn to resist an attack of mine!”

Yang Ye immediately flipped his left hand, and the ancient sheath appeared there before he slowly sheathed the Intent Sword into it. After that, he immediately drew it.

The Intent Sword shattered into pieces, and a ray of light flashed through the sky.

Mo Yixie’s pupils constricted, and he swiftly shouted, “Horizon Warp!”

As soon as he spoke, Yang Ye’s attack had shot through Mo Yixie’s body, but Yang Ye frowned because it hadn’t gone through Mo Yixie’s body at all. However, it hadn’t missed completely because a bloody arm had appeared where Mo Yixie was standing, and it was even holding a throwing knife.

“Yang Ye, you’ve defeated me. Congratulations because those that come from the Hallowed Ground after me will be experts that are beyond your imagination. Trust me, those freaks won’t disappoint you.”

Mo Yixie’s voice resounded from afar, and he was already over 500km away.

Ding Shaoyao appeared by Yang Ye’s side and said, “He probably utilized some sort of secret technique from the Hallowed Grounds.”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “He’s very strong, much stronger than Yao Ye. If my Sword Intent hadn’t improved, then I would probably be unable to deal with his attack at all. Start a search for him and notify me immediately if you find him.”

“I’ve already given the order!” said Ding Shaoyao.

Yang Ye glanced at her and grinned. Needless to say, it was really the right decision to let Ding Shaoyao manage the southern territory because she’d saved him from a huge amount of trouble. Of course, the most important factor was that he didn’t want to manage these trivial matters.

“Yao Ye is still alive!” Ding Shaoyao suddenly said, “I let him live.”

“Why?” asked Yang Ye.

She stretched out her hand to comb her hair behind her ears and said flatly, “I hung him naked on the city walls. Don’t worry, I’ll make him suffer. I’ve ordered for him to be ‘taken care of’ every single day.”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he asked, “Why?”

“Don’t you know that women are very vengeful?” Ding Shaoyao glanced at him and said, “If I were to have fallen into his hands that day, then the consequences I faced wouldn’t be much better than what he’s experiencing right now.”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched a little as he sized her up. He’d decided in his heart that he would never rashly offend this woman. Because not to mention anyone else, he would face a huge amount of trouble if she just provoked a fight between Qin Xiyue and Xiao Yuxi.

“Right, there’s something else waiting for you to deal with!” Ding Shaoyao spoke abruptly.

“What?”

“I’ve imprisoned the Mo Clan. What’s your decision?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a while before his voice resounded, “Kill them all!”

Another moment passed before Yang Ye’s voice resounded once more, “Release Mo Qingyue and everyone related to her. Regardless of what happened, she didn’t betray us.”

Ding Shaoyao glanced at him and said, “Understood!”

She paused for a moment and continued, “What do you intend to do next?”

Yang Ye turned around and looked ahead. The direction he was looking towards was the direction of the central territory, and it was also the direction of the Exalted Han Empire.
