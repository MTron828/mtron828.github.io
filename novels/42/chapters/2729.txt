Chapter 2730 – Erya is Terrifying!

In just that instant, the giant had recovered from the attack and kicked at Yang Ye!

Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically, and he pulled his sword back to defend himself!

Bang!

Yang Ye was instantly kicked over 10km away!

Meanwhile, the giant suddenly grabbed An Nanjing’s spear, and then it slapped its other palm at An Nanjing!

The powerful force contained within the palm caused ripples to undulate through space!

An Nanjing’s expression changed slightly, and she immediately floated backward.

Meanwhile, the giant hurled An Nanjing’s spear back at her.

Hiss!

Dagger-Axe pierced through space and carried a wave of terrifying energy as it shot toward An Nanjing’s retreating figure!

An Nanjing’s expression changed drastically. She swiftly pressed her palms together, and she caught Dagger-Axe between them. But her hands instantly started bleeding!

The force within it was too terrifying!

Suddenly, the giant leaped up and slammed a punch at An Nanjing.

An Nanjing’s eyes narrowed slightly. She was about to counterattack, but Yang Ye was faster!

At the instant the giant had attacked, Yang Ye had appeared above it, and then rays of sword energy instantly enveloped the giant. In an instant, it was blasted backward repeatedly.

The sword was too destructive, so even the giant was extremely afraid of that sword!

At the moment the giant retreated, An Nanjing stomped her right foot down and dashed forward. Dagger-Axe spun rapidly in her grasp, and the powerful energy it emanated blasted apart the space before her. It was an extremely shocking sight!

Suddenly, the giant stopped itself, and then it shot up into the air and slammed down at Yang Ye and An Nanjing like a falling mountain!

Powerful pressure descended from the sky, and it seemed capable of obliterating the world!

Yang Ye’s expression was extremely solemn. He’d only felt such pressure from a few people.

He gazed at An Nanjing, and the latter closed her eyes slowly.

A moment of silence ensued, and then they charged up into the air.

A breath of time later…

Boom!

A rumbling explosion resounded through the starry sky. In an instant, that expanse of space was obliterated. At the same time, two figures were retreating rapidly from that expanse of pitch black space, and they only stopped themselves after retreating over 30km back.

Those two figures belonged to Yang Ye and An Nanjing.

As soon as they stopped themselves, a wisp of blood seemed out from the corner of their mouths.

They looked ahead, and they saw the giant’s figure start to slowly turn ethereal, but it only took a moment for it to start madly absorbing the dark matter in the surroundings!

Thus, its ethereal figure started to become material once more!

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched from the sight of this.

Dammit! What the heck?!

They were about to continue fighting when a figure suddenly appeared before them!

It was Erya!

Erya glanced at them, and her gaze was very unfamiliar. But it only took a short while for her to frown, and then her gaze returned to normal, “Let me fight it!”

She turned around and gazed at the giant.

Erya walked slowly toward the giant, and a dark golden tail was just dragged through space behind her.

An Nanjing and Yang Ye exchanged glances, and they didn’t do anything.

They trusted her!

Actually, Erya felt dangerous to them.

That little fellow was abnormal just like Snowy! The only difference was that Snowy was the auxiliary type while Erya was the offensive type!

Erya gazed at the giant with calmness in her eyes, and her gaze gradually turned icy cold before becoming utterly indifferent.

Suddenly, the giant charged at Erya!

It only took a moment for it to rapidly approach Erya.

But Erya just continued walking as she had been doing.

Meanwhile, the giant suddenly slammed a punch at her. The punch was like a small mountain slamming down at her, and Erya’s petite figure seemed so tiny and weak before the fist!

Erya’s face still remained indifferent as it grew closer and closer to her.

A moment later, she attacked.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing watched with astonishment as Erya slapped her right palm forward.

It was a very tiny palm, just a little larger than Snowy.

However, as her palm moved forward, an invisible and overbearing force suddenly appeared above Erya. After that, the giant’s fist was forcibly stopped on the spot!

Suddenly, Erya charged up into the air, and she pressed the center of her palm against the giant’s fist. An instant later, she slammed her right fist forward.

Boom!

Yang Ye and An Nanjing watched as the giant’s right arm shattered into pieces, and then it was blasted away!

Suddenly, Erya pressed forward.

The giant slammed its other hand at Erya, but she slammed a punch forward as well!

Bang!

The giant’s remaining hand exploded apart, and Erya was right in front of its head now.

Erya swung a sideways kick that struck directly against the giant’s head.

Bang!

Its huge head instantly exploded apart!

Yang Ye was completely stunned.

After she kicked its head open, she started eating while Yang Ye and An Nanjing watched.

She was eating the giant!

Yang Ye and An Nanjing exchanged glances, and then they walked over to her. Erya suddenly looked at them, and she actually had a vigilant gaze in her eyes.

Yang Ye frowned from the sight of this!

Meanwhile, the vigilance in Erya’s eyes vanished. She pointed at the giant, “You want to have some too?”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched, and he shook his head, “No…”

She nodded and continued.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and went over to her side. He spoke softly, “Erya!”

She glanced at Yang Ye, “Big Brother Yang, just tell me if you have something to say.”

Big Brother Yang!

Yang Ye was visibly relieved because Erya was still quite normal.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “You’re a little different than you were!”

She nodded, “Some new things appeared in my mind, and it’s really annoying!”

Yang Ye was curious, “Why?”

She glanced at him, “Because I was quite bad in the past. Moreover, I was especially fond of killing people like you who are full of the desire to kill. I think that if I eat you, I’ll definitely become very, very strong!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened. He slapped Erya on the head, “What the heck are you thinking?”

She cracked a smile and continued eating the giant.

It wasn’t bloody because she only consumed energy, so it was better to call it absorbing the giant.

Yang Ye asked, “Erya, have you finished absorbing that fragment of your inner core?”

She shook her head, “I still have a little bit more to go, the key bit of it all.”

Yang Ye asked, “Do you need any help?”

She nodded, “At the critical moment, there are many annoying things which want to enter my mind, but I don’t really want them. I want to eliminate them and just keep my strength, but it doesn’t seem to be working!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “Erya, they are fragments of your past memories, right?”

Erya nodded.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing exchanged glances. In the end, An Nanjing said, “Absorb it!”

Erya gazed at her, and she spoke softly, “They are your memories, so don’t reject them and just absorb them. However, you must stay true to your heart and remember who you are.”

Erya fell silent for a short while and said, “I’m afraid I’ll harm Snowy and Big Brother Yang once I absorb it.”

An Nanjing smiled, “Do you think you would?”

She shook her head, “I won’t!”

An Nanjing smiled, “See?”

She wanted to say something else, but Erya shook her head again, “I don’t want to absorb those memories. The past has nothing to do with me. I’m Erya now, Big Brother Yang’s younger sister and Snowy’s best friend. The past has nothing to do with me. Once I’ve finished absorbing all this energy, I’ll ask Snowy to help me absorb that fragment, and then I’ll grow my own inner core!”

An Nanjing pondered deeply for a moment and nodded, “That works too!”

Erya chose to avoid her past path, and that worked too. It was her choice.

Her strength would definitely become extremely terrifying by remembering the past. After all, she was someone even Destiny had feared. However, if she recalled the past, she may become the Evil Beast of the past.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

She didn’t want to become a different person!

Yang Ye rubbed her head and spoke softly, “Alright, let’s just allow the past to stay in the past.”

If Erya really did become the Evil Beast of the past, then she may not be Erya anymore. At that time, it was very likely that they would become enemies. After all, Erya and Snowy were natural enemies.

It was best if their current relationship continued.

As for strength, it would be great if she could grow stronger, but if she couldn’t, that was fine too. He would protect them!

Of course, Erya was very strong already. So, it was really difficult to say who was doing the protecting!

Meanwhile, Erya stood up, and a wave of invisible pressure instantly rippled out of her, causing Yang Ye and An Nanjing to be instantly pushed over 30m back!

Erya hurriedly flew over to them with a concerned look in her eyes.

Yang Ye smiled, “We’re fine!”

While his face was calm, both An Nanjing and Yang Ye were astounded. Erya’s strength had grown so much after consuming the giant, and if she were to consume a few more. Even their joint forces would probably be no match for Erya!

Erya heaved a sigh of relief when she heard that they were fine, and then she smiled, “Big Brother Yang, find me a few more of that monster from before. It’s really nourishing. If I consume a few more of it, I’ll definitely be able to suppress all those random memories in my inner core.”

Once she finished speaking, she ran into the Primordial Pagoda and continued absorbing the energy and inner core!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye and An Nanjing had quite the colorful expressions on their faces.

A few more?

That’s so, so easy for you to say…
