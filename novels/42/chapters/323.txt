Chapter 324 – The Violet Mink?

When Yang Ye and Xiao Yuxi arrived once more before the entrance to the Nether God’s Tomb, this place was covered in corpses. Over 90% of them were the corpses of human profounders. All of them had perished rather miserably and horrifyingly because their flesh, bleed, and souls had been completely sucked away, and only an extremely shriveled up corpse remained!

Yang Ye glanced indifferently at all of this, and then he said, “Let’s go!”

He would naturally feel no pity for these humans. What a joke! Would they fell pity for him if he was dead? If he really was dead, then these humans would probably be the ones who laughed with the most delight!

Xiao Yuxi nodded, and then she walked towards the entrance. Even though she felt slight pity towards them, that was all she felt. After all, they weren’t related to her at all! In the end, it was still the same principle. Since they dared to come to the Ancient Battlefield and the Ninth Hell, then they should have been prepared for death!

In this place, the strong lived while the weak perished! Since they were weak yet still insisted on coming, then who could they blame but themselves?

At the moment that Yang Ye and Xiao Yuxi walked through the entrance, two rays of cold lights had shot violently at them from both sides. Yang Ye was about to act when Xiao Yuxi’s wrist shook slightly, and then a cold glow flashed. After that, two miserable and shrill cries suddenly resounded.

Yang Ye looked over towards the source of the voices, and he saw two human profounders gazing at them with astounded and terrified expressions. Both of them were still alive, but each of them had lost a right arm to Xiao Yuxi, and their blood was still spraying out like a fountain. The reason they still hadn’t fled was that Xiao Yuxi’s Saber Intent had locked onto them.

Fleeing now was equivalent to death!

“Who are the two of you!?” asked Xiao Yuxi in a low voice.

They were about to speak when Yang Ye spoke before them. “They’re here to rob others of course. They’re keeping watch at the entrance to the tomb so that they can launch a surprise attack when others enter. Even profounders that are slightly stronger than them would probably suffer death before their surprise attacks. Am I right?”

Their expressions changed, and then one of them gazed at Xiao Yuxi and said, “Friend, don’t listen to his nonsense. We brothers are from the Sixth Rank Sect of the central territory, the Unclear Sect. The reason we attacked the two of you was that we thought you were members of the other races. If we knew that you were human profounders, then we would have definitely not attacked!”

Xiao Yuxi loosened the grip on her saber when she heard this, and her expression eased up. The two of them were delighted when they noticed this, and the other one of pair disregarded the pain from his severed arm and hurriedly said, “I presume both of you are genius disciples from Ninth Rank Sects since you possessed such formidable strengths, right? We brothers....”

This person had merely spoken up to here when a strand of pale violet light flashed abruptly, and then his head flew into the air.

“You....” The other fellow gazed at Yang Ye with horror. However, another ray of light flashed, and then his head flew off as well.

After he killed the two of them, Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the spatial rings in their possessions had instantly flown into his palm.

Meanwhile, Xiao Yuxi gazed at Yang Ye and asked in a calm voice. “Why?”

Yang Ye naturally knew what she was asking about. He immediately grinned and said, “Look at the corpses in the surroundings. Are the human corpses more numerous or the corpses of the other races?”

Xiao Yuxi glanced at the surroundings when she heard this. There were almost 100 corpses around them, and over 90% of these corpses belonged to humans!

Xiao Yuxi frowned. Obviously, she’d come to an understanding!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye waved the spatial rings in his hand, and then he said, “I’ve just looked through them. There are an entire 15,000 plus energy stones within this spatial ring, and there are countless assorted things in there as well. Obviously, they’d obtained all of that through robbing others. They’d only spoken those words just now because they wanted you to spare their lives!”

When he spoke up to here, Yang Ye suddenly smiled and said, “Actually, I would still kill them even if they were only targeting members of the other races!”

“Why?” Xiao Yuxi was puzzled.

“Because we’ve contracted enmity with them!” Yang Ye smiled and said, “You’ve severed their arms, so do you think they wouldn’t harbor any resentment towards you? Perhaps you would believe it. But while they seemed to be extremely respectful and devoid of any resentment, I guarantee that they probably wish for nothing more than to torture us to death! Enemies aren’t terrifying, but it’s terrifying when they’re in the shadows. So, once enmity has been contracted, it’s best to destroy it at the roots!”

Xiao Yuxi glanced at Yang Ye, and then she shook her head and said, “I don’t know what you’ve encountered in the past that made your character become like this, and I can’t say that you’re wrong as well. However, I feel that acting in that way is too extreme. Moreover, it’ll make countless enemies for you. After all, the benevolent have no enemies!”

“The benevolent have no enemies?” Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, and then he said, “Those words are true. The benevolent have to help others more. Unfortunately, I’ll never be someone benevolent.”

Xiao Yuxi frowned and said, “Why?”

“Because I’m going to kill a huge amount of people!” Yang Ye twisted his wrist, and his sword left an afterimage behind as it moved. He said, “I’ll make all those who harm or betray, me or my loved ones, pay with their lives!”

When he recalled the scene he witnessed with the Space Mirror, Yang Ye instantly emanated a strand of extremely ferocious Slaughter Sword Intent. Moreover, his eyes gradually turned crimson red, and it was like an ocean of blood resided within his eyes!

Xiao Yuxi’s expression changed. However, right at this moment, the crimson red in Yang Ye’s eyes slowly vanished, and the ferocious Sword Intent slowly returned into his body!

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then his brows knit together tightly. Because he’d noticed a serious problem, and that was his Slaughter Sword Intent was capable of overwhelming him with the intent to slaughter! At that moment just now, he actually had the feeling to annihilate everyone in the world! If he didn’t possess the Enlightened Sword Heart, then he would have already become a machine of slaughter right now!

“The Slaughter Sword Intent can be said to be the sharpest and fierce amongst Sword Intent. Because the stronger your killing intent is, the greater its might will be! Especially when you’ve killed a huge amount of people, the boundless killing intent wouldn’t just make you lose all reason, it can even affect the mind of your opponents! It can be said that the stronger your killing intent is, the stronger your Slaughter Sword Intent would be!” Xiao Yuxi spoke in a heavy voice. “However, it has an extremely huge flaw as well. If you’re unable to control your killing intent, then you’ll be controlled by it. You should know what the consequence of being controlled by your killing intent is!”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “I’ll pay attention to that in the future, and I’ll try my best to avoid utilizing it if I can!”

Xiao Yuxi nodded and said, “The greatest taboo of those who cultivate in the sword and saber is being controlled by your own weapon. Because if you’re controlled by your own weapon, then you’re not ‘you’ anymore.”

Yang Ye said seriously, “I understand!”

Xiao Yuxi shook her head slightly, and then she said, “Let’s go. There are numerous souls within this place, and they’re extremely beneficial to you!” As soon as she finished speaking, Xiao Yuxi started walking forward.

Yang Ye hurriedly followed her.

Yang Ye was ceaselessly sizing up the tomb as he traveled. Instead of calling this place a tomb, it could really be called an enormous city. But this city was completely empty, and it was filled with bone piercingly cold winds. Moreover, green balls of light would occasionally appear on its streets!

The green balls of light here were much larger than those outside the tomb. Just as Xiao Yuxi had said, the energy within them was even purer, and this made Yang Ye extremely delighted! Because he’d absorbed over 100 green balls of light all along the way. However, he was puzzled by the fact that Xiao Yuxi refused these green balls of light, and she gave everything they obtained to him. This made him feel very uncomfortable!

It was naturally all thanks to Xiao Yuxi that Yang Ye was able to absorb so many ‘souls’ in such a short period of just two hours. Because Xiao Yuxi seemed to know where they were, so they found an unusually huge amount all along the way!

After he absorbed another green ball of light, Yang Ye took a deep breath while a wisp of happiness flashed in his eyes. Because he sensed that his Sword Intent seemed to have arrived at the peak of the 6th level. Moreover, he felt that it had become even purer. It could be said that while he was still at the 6th level of Sword Intent, his Sword Intent was absolutely not weaker than Mo Qingyu!

Because he possessed Slaughter Sword Intent!

“Your Sword Intent is about to break through?” asked Xiao Yuxi.

Yang Ye nodded. He hesitated for a moment before he flipped his palm, and then five Icesoul Fruits and a top-grade energy tone appeared in his palm. He passed them to her and said, “You said that those souls aren’t very helpful to your current Saber Intent, so I’ll believe you for now. However, these Icesoul Spirit Fruits and this top-grade energy stone should be useful to you, right?”

Xiao Yuxi was about to speak when Yang Ye continued. “We can only split apart if you continue to refuse it. After all, I’m not so shameless to continuously take advantage of you!”

“Is there any need to treat me like such an outsider?” Xiao Yuxi glanced at Yang Ye with a slightly displeased expression, and then she seemed to feel that her attitude could be slightly misinterpreted. So, her expression slowly turned cold while she looked away. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Yang Ye was stunned by this, and then he shook his head and said, “I’m not treating you like an outsider. I’m only giving them to you because I feel that they’re helpful to you. Just like how you are giving me the souls because you feel that they’re helpful to me!”

Xiao Yuxi’s face eased up when she heard Yang Ye’s explanation, and then she glanced at Yang Ye before she took the Icesoul Fruits and energy stone from Yang Ye. Suddenly, she frowned as she carefully sized up the Icesoul Fruits. After that, she said, “I’ve consumed Icesoul Fruits in the past, but they seem to be slightly different from these!”

“What’s different about them?” asked Yang Ye with a frown on his face.

Xiao Yuxi pondered deeply for a moment before she said, “The energy contained with these Icesoul Fruits are at least 10 times purer than the Icesoul Fruit I consumed in the past. Are you sure they are Icesoul Fruits?”

“10 times?” Yang Ye was shocked, and he said, “How could that be possible?”

Xiao Yuxi was just about to say something. But right at this moment, a strand of violet light flashed, and then an Icesoul Fruit in Xiao Yuxi’s palm had suddenly vanished. Xiao Yuxi’s expression changed while killing intent flashed in her eyes.

However, right at this moment, she suddenly heard Yang Ye cry out loudly with excitement while seeming as if he’d gone mad. “Little Fellow!”

A strand of violet light flashed, and then the violet mink appeared in front of Yang Ye....
