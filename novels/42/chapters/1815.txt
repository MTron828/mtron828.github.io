Chapter 1816 – I Don’t Want It Anymore!

Yang Ye!

Silence filled the surroundings, and everyone was looking at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye had shown himself!

He was right before them. But at this moment, no one dared to attack, and fear filled their eyes!

Yang Ye had killed Ye Mo in an instant just now!

Even though Ye Mo was heavily injured, he was still a 6th stage True Realm expert! Moreover, Ye Mo was a 6th stage True Realm expert who was practically at the peak of the realm. However, Ye Mo had been killed in an instant!

He hadn’t even been able to react!

Ye Mo wasn’t the only one who hadn’t been able to react, many others here hadn’t been able to see that attack clearly!

That was the true source of their fear!

Previously, they didn’t have a good idea of Yang Ye’s strength, and they just felt Yang Ye was quite strong. Yet now, they realized he wasn’t just quite strong, he was extremely strong!

Everyone here fell silent. No one left, but no one attacked. Because no one wanted to be the first to step forward!

Yang Ye ignored the experts in the surroundings, and he gazed at Ye Mo who still had one last breath in him, “If you didn’t force me to use my sword, then while I would still be able to defeat you with my fists, I wouldn’t have been able to kill you. Unfortunately, you just had to make me pick up a sword.”

Ye Mo’s pupils constricted slightly, and then he took his last breath.

Yang Ye waved his right hand and took Ye Mo’s corpse.

Actually, he didn’t want to expose himself. Because it would be too troublesome. But it couldn’t be helped, many people were suspecting him earlier. So, he would be exposed even if he didn’t want to expose himself. The reason was that he would definitely be exposed once he picked up a sword.

He was a sword cultivator. Even if he tried to conceal it, others would be able to sense it once he held a sword!

Since he couldn’t conceal it, it was better to just admit it!

Yang Ye put the sword away and exchanged it for the Sword Precursor, and then he glanced at the experts in the surroundings, “Is anyone going to try to kill me?”

His voice was soft, but it carried an oppressive and domineering aura.

Meanwhile, a black robed old man suddenly stepped forward and gazed at Yang Ye, “There’s no enmity between us, and we don’t want to become enemies with you. But that wooden sword is of the utmost importance to us. We’ll leave if you hand it over!”

Hand over the wooden sword!

Even though Yang Ye was strong, they weren’t weak. So, they would naturally not be scared off. Most importantly, the wooden sword was too tempting to refuse.

Yang Ye gazed at the old man, and then he transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

At the same time, a speck of cold light suddenly appeared just a few inches away from the old man’s forehead!

The tip of a sword!

The speck of cold light was the tip of a sword!

The black robed old man’s expression changed drastically when he saw Yang Ye attack abruptly. Fortunately, he was a powerful expert, so his reaction wasn’t slow. A wave of terrifying aura swept out from him. But the aura was still sliced into bits. However, it did buy the old man a little time and allowed him to flash away from where he stood!

At this moment, the old man was over 1km away!

There was a spot of bright red on his forehead. Or to be more precise, it was a bloody hole.

Blood was seeping out incessantly from there.

The old man rubbed his forehead gently, and he was horrified. If he had been a little slower, just a little slower, he would be dead!

He’s strong, and his sword is so swift!

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “I don’t want that sword anymore!”

He immediately transformed into a ray of black light that vanished into the distance!

He didn’t want it anymore!

Or to be more precise, he didn’t dare to try and get it anymore!

The black robed old man was smart because he knew that if this continued, Yang Ye would stop at nothing to kill him.

Yang Ye would make an example out of him!

He’d realized that, so he’d decisively chosen to leave.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye glanced at the black robed old man and didn’t choose to chase him down. Because it was meaningless. Moreover, if he did, he would have to use the Grand Teleportation Technique and Split Second!

But he could only execute one last Split Second right now!

Preserve his strength!

Yang Ye withdrew two Energy Pearls, swallowed them, and then glanced coldly at the others here, “Does anyone else want my sword?”

The others fell silent.

They naturally wanted it. But the problem was that it was clearly not easy to get. Besides that, none of them wanted to be the first to face Yang Ye!

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze when he saw them remain silent, and then he gazed at Blood Maiden, “Where are the others?”

Blood Maiden replied, “Eldest Sister is undergoing a breakthrough. The rest are protecting her.”

Yang Ye asked, “How long will it take?”

Blood Maiden thought for a moment and replied, “I’m not certain. Perhaps a moment, a month, or even a year.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “That won’t do. We can’t stay here.”

Blood Maiden replied, “I know. But….”

Yang Ye suddenly said, “Tell her to go into that place of mine!”

Blood Maiden glanced at Yang Ye. She naturally knew what he was talking about.

The Primordial Pagoda!

Yang Ye meant the Primordial Pagoda.

Blood Maiden said, “I didn’t tell anyone about it, and I never told my eldest sister either.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I trust you, trust Nether Maiden, and trust all your sisters. I trust her too. Moreover, she has Yin’yin’s memories, so she knows many of my secrets.”

Blood Maiden thought for a moment and said, “Alright, come with me!”

She vanished on the spot with Nether Maiden.

Yang Ye was about to enter Heaven Pavilion when he seemed to have thought of something, and he glanced at the people here, “I’m not going anywhere. I’ll be inside.”

He vanished on the spot.

The others here exchanged glances.

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “We have to work together, at least temporarily!”

A moment of silence ensued, and then the others nodded to display their agreement.

The news that Yang Ye showed himself in Divine Ruins City swept through Heaven Pillar Mountain like the plague, and countless experts started rushing towards the city.

Needless to say, Yang Ye’s arrival has made Heaven Pillar Mountain lose its peaceful atmosphere.

Heaven Pavilion.

Nether Maiden and Blood Maiden led Yang Ye to the top of the pavilion, and he saw Sky Maiden and Blind Maiden there.

At this moment, Sky Maiden was seated cross-legged at the center of her, and her eyes were closed. The space around her was like a vortex that was pulsating incessantly.

Meanwhile, Blind Maiden suddenly turned to look at Yang Ye, “You’re here.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Hi, Third Sister!”

He sincerely respected Blind Maiden.

Blind Maiden nodded slightly, “You’ve grown very quickly. Even Second Sister and I would probably find it difficult to defeat you.”

Yang Ye smiled, “No matter how strong I am, you’re still my Third Sister!”

Blind Maiden grinned when she heard him.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “Third Sister, we can’t stay here. We must take your eldest sister and leave.”

He was very well aware that those experts outside wouldn’t give up on obtaining the wooden sword. All of them were old geezers who had cultivated for countless years, so it was impossible to scare them away. Moreover, the news of his arrival in Divine Ruins City had probably spread. Now, countless experts were probably coming to kill him.

His own strength wasn’t bad, and the Nether Pavilion’s strength wasn’t bad as well. However, he was very well aware that they were no match for all the experts in Heaven Pillar Mountain. If they stayed here, those fellows would be able to exhaust them to death.

Blind Maiden gazed at Blood Maiden, and the latter nodded slightly, “We can’t stay for long!”

Blind Maiden nodded, “Then let’s go!” She gazed at Yang Ye while she spoke.

Yang Ye walked towards Sky Maiden. Meanwhile, Blood Maiden suddenly said, “Be careful!”

Yang Ye was puzzled. Suddenly, his expression changed because he sensed an extremely terrifying devouring force. The devouring force even made his heart palpitate slightly!

Danger!

His intuition told him that Sky Maiden was very dangerous!

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he walked over to her, waved his right hand, and transported her into the Primordial Pagoda.

The Primordial Pagoda wasn’t capable of just transporting anyone into it. The reason he could transport her into it was mainly because Sky Maiden didn’t resist. Even though she was cultivating, she could sense everything which was going on in the world outside.

After he placed her within the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye gazed at Blood Maiden and the others, “Let’s go?”

They nodded.

Suddenly, their expressions changed.

Boom!

An instant later, an explosion resounded, and the entire pavilion was obliterated.

Meanwhile, a voice suddenly resounded, “Go? It’s best if you don’t go anywhere!”

As soon as the voice finished resounding, five black clothed figures appeared not too far away from them. There was a middle aged man in a black embroidered robe standing before the black clothed figures.

Six 6th stage True Realm experts!

Yang Ye glanced at them and shook his head. 6th stage True Realm experts were extremely rare in the world outside, and even the eight clans had pitiably few 6th stage True Realm experts. But in this place, 6th stage True Realm experts were so common!

But it was normal. After all, it could be said that all the 6th stage True Realm experts in the medium universe were gathered here.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man who led the group suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, “You killed Ye Mo?”

Ye Mo!

Yang Ye glanced at the middle aged man and replied, “I’ve killed many people. I don’t know which one you’re talking about. Can you describe his appearance in detail?”

The atmosphere here instantly turned icy cold.

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “I’ll give you another chance to think about what you want to say!”

Yang Ye suddenly raised his sword slowly, and he pointed it at the middle aged man, “Many have said similar things to me. But the grass on their graves are at least 10m tall now.”

Everyone here felt speechless when they heard him.
