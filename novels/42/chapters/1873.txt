Chapter 1874 – Merge!

Merge his sword techniques!

To be more precise, he intended to create a new technique!

He hadn’t really created techniques in the past because his foundation was too weak, and he hadn’t learned many different techniques. Under such circumstances, he was utterly incapable of creating his own sword techniques. But now, he’d learned quite a bit, and his comprehension of the Sword Dao was at a new height.

So, he had an idea.

Hou Qing glanced at Yang Ye and nodded slightly, “It’s a very good thing that you have an idea. After all, it isn’t really good to only keep learning from others. Because it doesn’t belong completely to you, but techniques you create yourself truly belong to you!”

Yang Ye nodded. He was of the same mind.

Regardless of whether it was the Sword Dao or the Martial Dao, they needed a person’s own touch.

After talking with Hou Qing for a while, Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground.

Ponder!

Yang Ye was thinking about everything he’d learned. All of it and everything else he possessed. To be precise, he was pondering everything he’d learned since he was a Labor Disciple.

The Basic Sword Technique, the Sword Control Technique, the sword soul technique, the Sword of Elements, Split Second…

Countless sword techniques were flashing through Yang Ye’s mind.

They were all the sword techniques he’d learned in the past, but as his strength grew, he’d slowly abandoned them. Because they couldn’t keep up with the growth in his strength. Now that he was recalling them, he noticed that all those sword techniques had their own merits.

Since something existed, it definitely had its own value!

Qiong Qi and Hou Qing were standing not too far away.

Qiong Qi said, “He has started to create his own technique!”

Hou Qing nodded slightly, “That’s a good thing, isn’t it?”

Qiong Qi replied, “Based on that kid’s character, what kind of technique do you think he will create?”

Hou Qing smiled and said, “I’d like to know too. Let’s wait and see!”

Qiong Qi glanced at Hou Qing, “Your attitude towards him has changed!”

Hou Qing glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Haven’t you noticed? He’s unlike most humans. His character will definitely make it impossible for him to live amongst humans, but if he comes to my shaman race, your demon race, or the ancient devil race, he’ll definitely be able to gain great success.”

Qiong Qi nodded.

The shaman race, demon race, and ancient devil race respected the strong. The more one displayed one’s strength, the more respect one would get. In their worlds, there were no complicated thoughts, and it was only a matter of strength. So, one had to make a show of strength, and keeping a low profile would make them look down on the person instead!

However, the human race was completely different.

Those who displayed their strength and showed off would usually die the quickest.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing said, “No matter what happens in the future, he’ll definitely have a place in the large universe.”

…

In the cultivation room, Yang Ye suddenly stood up and started waving his sword about. In the beginning, his sword was very slow, but it started to become faster a short while later.

Fast and slow!

Moreover, numerous afterimages suddenly appeared in the cultivation room for a moment, and then those afterimages vanished before the entire room became empty…

When Yang Ye recalled the past, Yang Ye had to admit that he’d really learned a huge mix of techniques. Fist techniques, sword techniques, and all sorts of other techniques. But they were only able to accompany him for a short while.

He’d eaten more than he could digest. Now, he was trying to digest it all!

Of course, he hadn’t forgotten the Sword Domain!

In the past, he only knew how to use the Sword Domain defensively, yet now, he intended to try and figure out how to use it offensively. The Sword Domain surpassed sword intent and the Laws, and it was absolutely formidable. So, he intended to slowly unearth its potential!

His current strength was able to make his Sword Domain cover an area of around 5,000km. Of course, it was because he’d attained the 6th stage of the True Realm, and he’d planted the Spirit Shaping Tree and Soul Nurturing Flower within himself.

Even though it could cover such a huge area, its consumption was extraordinarily terrifying as well. It didn’t just exhaust his profound energy; it exhausted his spirit and mind. The larger the area it covered, the more pressure there would be on his soul and spirit! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

So, when Yang Ye trained, he merely allowed the Sword Domain to stretch to a distance of 500km around him. That was an area he could endure, and it was more suitable!

Time passed quickly as he cultivated. A few months passed in the blink of an eye.

One day, Yang Ye suddenly appeared on the 1st level of the Primordial Pagoda.

On an expanse of empty ground, Yang Ye’s eyes were closed. A long time passed before he took a step forward, and then space in an area of 500km around him trembled.

The Sword Domain!

At this moment, the Sword Domain had enveloped space and everything around him.

Suddenly, Yang Ye opened his eyes, “Sword!”

As soon as he commanded, an ethereal sword appeared before him. After it appeared, another sword appeared. Just like that, 36 ethereal swords appeared in an instant within the Sword Domain!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s body started to tremble.

As his body trembled, the 36 ethereal swords started to tremble as well. It didn’t take long for them to start spinning slowly on the spot. They spun for a while before they started to fly in a strange trajectory.

A short while later. Suddenly…

Bang!

The swords exploded apart.

Boom!

Yang Ye was blasted away, and he flew almost 10km away before he slammed against the ground.

Snowy heard the explosion and had come over. Her entire body shuddered at the sight of this, and she flickered over to Yang Ye’s head. She grabbed his head and shook it incessantly while crying, and the spirit energy which she cried out instantly drowned Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing and Qiong Qi appeared here.

When she saw them, Snowy hurriedly gazed at Hou Qing, and then she pointed at Hou Qing before pointing at Yang Ye while a pleading expression filled her eyes.

Hou Qing floated over to Yang Ye, took a glance, and then looked at Snowy, “He’s just unconscious. He’ll wake up in a while!”

Snowy blinked and didn’t really understand him.

Hou Qing glanced at her and said, “He’s sleeping. He’ll wake up after a while. Understand?”

Snowy shook her head because she’d never seen Yang Ye sleeping.

Hou Qing felt speechless.

Meanwhile, Snowy suddenly pointed at the blood on the corner of Yang Ye’s mouth, and then she gazed at Hou Qing. She seemed to be asking him to save Yang Ye!

Hou Qing thought for a moment and said, “He’s fine. He’ll wake up in a moment.”

Snowy’s eyes instantly opened wide, and then the golden sword appeared in her grasp.

She was angry. As far as she was concerned, Hou Qing refused to save Yang Ye.

Hou Qing’s face darkened when he saw the sword in Snowy’s grasp, “You just raise your sword for everything. I can’t communicate with you.”

He gazed at Qiong Qi and was just about to continue, but Qiong Qi suddenly said, “He can do it, but he refuses to do so!”

Hou Qing gazed at Qiong Qi with shock, “you…”

Snowy understood Qiong Qi.

An instant later, the sword in her grasp transformed into a ray of golden light that slashed down towards Hou Qing.

It was the sword in its unsealed form!

Hou Qing naturally didn’t dare to go head-on against it. He immediately flashed to the side. However, Snowy had no intention to let him go, and she continued chasing after him and attacking him.

Hou Qing hurriedly gazed at Qiong Qi when he saw that Snowy refused to stop, “Qiong Qi, you bastard! What’s wrong with you? Tell this little fellow the truth!”

Qiong Qi glanced at Hou Qing and said, “I’ve been quite bored, so I was looking for something to do.”

Hou Qing cursed, “Bored my ass! You…”

Suddenly, Snowy started to spit spirit energy into the sword, and then the golden sword started trembling violently. It didn’t take long for rays of golden sword energy to rain down upon Hou Qing.

Hou Qing’s expression changed at the sight of this. Now, he had nowhere to hide because he was too close to Snowy.

Hou Qing didn’t try to dodge it. A wave of powerful aura swept out from him, and it instantly obliterated the rain of sword energy.

Snowy blinked when she saw the sword energy being destroyed. She glanced at Hou Qing, glanced at her sword, and then glanced at Qiong Qi in the end. After that, she pointed at Hou Qing, and what she meant was that she wanted him to deal with Hou Qing.

Qiong Qi was at a loss for words.

Qiong Qi would naturally not help Snowy fight Hou Qing. However, Snowy was really angry right now. Suddenly, she flew up into the air, and then she started ceaselessly waving her claws towards the sky. Moreover, she was crying as she did that.

Hou Qing asked as he stood by Qiong Qi’s side, “What’s she doing?”

Qiong Qi gazed at Snowy for a good while, and then he said, “She seems to be getting help!”

“Help?” Hou Qing chuckled, “The Divine Yin Flame wouldn’t help her. Besides the Divine Yin Flame, only Yang Ye is left in here. No, wait…”

When he spoke up to this point, Qiong Qi and Hou Qing suddenly exchanged glances, and then a trace of anxiety appeared in their eyes.

Suddenly, Snowy stopped. At the same time, the space in the sky trembled violently, and then two waves of extremely strong energy rained down from the sky.

Qiong Qi and Hou Qing’s expressions changed at the sight of this. It was especially so for Hou Qing. His face had turned quite pale, “If the heavens gave me another chance, I would definitely not offend that little lord…”

Boom! Boom!

The waves of energy descended, and both Qiong Qi and Hou Qing were slammed into the ground!
