Chapter 1998 – No Leaving!

Spirit energy!

Snowy’s eyes lit up because she loved doing things like that.

In the past, Yang Ye didn’t dare to let her just take the spirit energy anywhere. Because it would definitely cause a huge amount of trouble for him. Yet now, he couldn’t care about it!

Since they refused to let him go, he felt that no one should leave!

After she received Yang Ye’s permission, Snowy slowly floated up into the air, and then she sniffed lightly. She sensed a little bit of spirit energy, but it wasn’t much. So, she turned to look at Yang Ye, and there was aversion in her eyes.

It was too little! She didn’t want to take it at all!

Yang Ye’s face darkened, “I’ll let you have more in the future. Just take what’s here for now, alright?”

In the end, Yang Ye succeeded at persuading Snowy to do it.

Snowy opened her mouth and sucked in a light breath.

In an instant, all the remaining spirit energy throughout the mountain surged towards Snowy. The remnants of the spirit vein in Southern Qilin Mountain didn’t have much spirit energy within them to begin with, so they were completely depleted by this. Moreover, the spirit energy throughout Southern Qilin Mountain vanished without a trace.

Not even a thread of spirit energy was left behind!

Clamorous noise resounded throughout the mountain!

Countless experts shot up into the air to find the culprit.

But at this moment, Yang Ye had already left with Snowy.

In the sky above the mountain, Gu Ku’s expression was extremely unsightly, and so was the expression on the Blood Demon King’s face.

While the remaining spirit energy within the spirit veins wasn’t much, it was still some spirit energy! However, even that was gone now. So, it was a huge blow to them.

Not even a bit of spirit energy was left! The teleportation formation couldn’t be used at all now, unless they used a huge number of immortal crystals and inner cores to activate it!

The Blood Demon King suddenly said, “Was it him?”

Gu Ku spoke in a low voice, “It’s definitely him!”

The Blood Demon King spoke solemnly, “How did he do it?”

Gu Ku shook his head.

The Blood Demon King waved his right hand, and a spatial ring appeared before Gu Ku, “There are inner cores in there. Activate the formation and send some of our subordinates out of here!”

Gu Ku nodded, “Alright.”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

…

Yang Ye sat cross-legged in a cave, and he immersed his mind into his body.

At this moment, Snowy was seated on the ground in the Primordial Pagoda, and a large number of immortal crystals were around here. There were at least a few hundred around her!

They were the product of the spirit energy from before!

Snowy blinked and cracked a smile when she saw Yang Ye.

Yang Ye walked over to Snowy, took Snowy in his arms, and smiled, “How do you feel?”

Yang Ye waved her claws swiftly to convey that she felt very comfortable!

Taking spirit energy into her body was extremely beneficial to her growth.

Yang Ye smiled, put away the immortal crystals, and said, “Come, let’s continue!”

Just like that, the two of them left the Primordial Pagoda and snuck to the foot of Southern Qilin Mountain.

There was a huge square at the mountainside, and there were three teleportation formations there. Every one of them could fit around 100 people at a time. At this moment, they’d been activated, and they were emanating faint blue light.

There were both humans and demon beasts on the formations.

“Begin!” Suddenly, a voice resounded, and then the teleportation formations shook violently while rays of blue light enveloped the people and demon beasts within the formations. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

A short while later, their bodies started to gradually turn ethereal.

However, something unexpected suddenly occurred!

Bang!

The blue light around the teleportation formations shattered, and both the humans and demon beasts in the formations were blasted away by a wave of energy!

Everyone here was stunned by this.

What’s going on?

Meanwhile, Gu Ku appeared here. He glanced at the surroundings, and his face became extremely gloomy.

The spirit energy was gone!

The spirit energy created by the immortal crystals and inner cores were all gone!

Not even a drop was left!

“Dammit!” Gu Ku roared with fury and vanished on the spot.

…

At the foot of Southern Qilin Mountain, Yang Ye was fleeing swiftly with Snowy in his arms.

Run as soon as they were done!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to bring Snowy somewhere safe, and then he went into the Primordial Pagoda with her.

She started spitting out immortal crystals, one by one.

Yang Ye’s eyes glowed as he watched this. If he was in the outside world, these immortal crystals would be nothing to him, but they were priceless in this place! Especially at a time like this!

While Yang Ye was happy, others were sad.

In the hall on Southern Qilin Mountain.

Gu Ku’s expression was extremely gloomy. Their supply of both immortal crystals and inner cores wasn’t endless. Especially immortal crystals, they could be said to have an absolutely limited supply of it. Moreover, the immortal crystals and inner cores required to activate the formation was split evenly between him and the Blood Demon King!

The more they could provide, the more they could send out of this place!

Yet now, the spirit energy here hadn’t just vanished completely, even the inner cores and immortal crystals they’d prepared for that round of teleportation were gone!

If this happened a few more times, they wouldn’t get to leave at all!

“Let’s talk with him!” Suddenly, the Blood Demon King said, “He has a pair of Sage Rank wings, and coupled with his own speed, even we can’t catch up to him. Most importantly, we don’t have time to waste on him. We only have two and a half days left.”

“We’re going to make a compromise?” Gu Ku spoke in a low voice, and his voice carried a trace of unwillingness!

The Blood Demon King stood up, “Brother Gu, we’re just letting a few more people leave. If you continue this fight with him, then not to mention those humans who’re with you, even the demon beasts with me won’t be able to leave. This isn’t something they want, and it’s not something I want! Understand?”

His voice was quite cold when he spoke up to this point.

Gu Ku fell silent for a long while before he said, “Fine, we’ll talk with him!”

Gu Ku vanished on the spot.

The Blood Demon King closed his eyes slowly, “I hope you don’t play any tricks. My patience is limited.”

…

Outside Southern Qilin Mountain.

Gu Ku floated in midair, and the Blood Demon King was by his side.

The Blood Demon King glanced at the surroundings and said, “Show yourself. I know you’re here!”

He received no answer!

Yang Ye laughed coldly to himself. Show myself? I may not have a chance to escape if they join forces against me!

Meanwhile, the Blood Demon King added, “I guarantee in the name of the demon race that we won’t attack you.”

He still received no answer!

The Blood Demon King said, “Do you really plan to waste time with us like this? If this continues, none of us will be able to leave. So, show yourself. Let’s just talk about it. We’re absolutely sincere about this.”

A long time passed before a figure appeared not too far away from them.

It was Yang Ye’s figure, of course.

Just as the Blood Demon King had said, Yang Ye’s objective was very simple, and it was to send A’Man and the others out of the Dead Dimension and not to take these fellows down with him.

Gu Ku’s eyes narrowed slightly when he saw Yang Ye.

The Blood Demon King sized up Yang Ye and asked, “How many people do you have?”

Yang Ye replied, “Around 30!”

“10 immortal crystals each!” The Blood Demon King continued, “If you’re willing to pay that price, we’ll be willing to let you and your people leave.”

300 immortal crystals!

Needless to say, it was quite a big request. Because 300 immortal crystals was a huge amount of wealth in the Dead Dimension.

However, Yang Ye didn’t refuse, and he just nodded, “Alright, deal!”

Immortal crystals were very precious here, but once they left this place, immortal crystals wouldn’t be so precious anymore. But if they couldn’t leave this place, they would die, and these immortal crystals would just be rocks!

So, he wasn’t reluctant to part with them at all!

Yang Ye didn’t waste time and immediately flicked a spatial ring to the Blood Demon King. The latter glanced at it, and there were exactly 300 immortal crystals in them!

The Blood Demon King glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Lead your people to the teleportation formation!”

Yang Ye turned around and left, and it didn’t take long for him to return with A’Man and the others.

At the teleportation formation.

The Blood Demon King said, “All of you go first!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, and then he gazed at A’Man and the others, “All of you go first!”

A’Man asked, “What about you?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’ll leave later.”

“I’ll stay behind!” A’Man continued, “You leave with the others!”

Yang Ye shook his head and sent her a voice transmission, “They fear me. They’ll be afraid while I’m here, and they wouldn’t dare to play any tricks. It’s pointless for you to say, so take the others and go!”

A’Man wanted to say more, but Yang Ye added, “Big Sis, that’s enough. Just take them and go!”

A'Man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before she nodded, “We’ll be waiting for you!”

She turned around and entered the teleportation formation.

Qin Chuan and the others went over to Yang Ye, patted Yang Ye on the shoulder, and said, “We’ll be waiting for you! We’ll kill our way back here if we don’t see you soon!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Qin Chuan and the others entered the teleportation formation before Yang Ye could say anything.

Yang Ye gazed at the Blood Demon King, and the latter gazed at Gu Ku.

Gu Ku nodded slightly, waved his right hand, and then the teleportation formation started trembling.

A short while later, rays of blue light enveloped A’Man and the others, and then they vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief when he witnessed this.

Suddenly, A’Man and the others appeared in the teleportation formation again, and all of them were heavily injured!

Everyone here was stunned!

Yang Ye swiftly gazed at Gu Ku, and the Blood Demon King glared angrily at Gu Ku as well. However, A’Man suddenly said, “It’s not his fault. The people outside refuse to let us leave!”

The people outside!
