Chapter 1244 – You Intend To Take Over My Body?

“Reorganize my thoughts and speak again?” She was stunned, and a wisp of disdain flashed through her eyes, “Who do you think you are?”

She immediately waved her right hand once she finished speaking, and then her sword intent pressed down towards Yang Ye.

However, Yang Ye remained motionless on the spot, and he just allowed the sword intent to descend upon him. The beautiful woman and the other green robed man watched with astonishment as her sword intent entered Yang Ye’s body and seemed like a rock that fell into an ocean. It didn’t cause even the slightest ripple.

“How... how could that be possible?” Disbelief filled her eyes as she took a step forward, and a strand of terrifying sword intent surged out from her before sweeping towards Yang Ye.

Just like before, all of it entered Yang Ye’s body.

The beautiful woman was stunned. Meanwhile, Xing Feng was about to speak when Yang Ye took a step forward, and then a strand of sword intent appeared out of thin air around the woman.

Her figure shook as she moved backwards repeatedly, and she finally stopped after Yang Ye withdrew his sword intent.

She gazed at him as if she’d seen a ghost, “You... you possess sword intent above the Void Rank?”

“Didn’t you experience it for yourself?” Yang Ye continued, “Take me to your leader. I think we need to have a talk.”

She looked Yang Ye in the eyes and questioned him, “Who are you? What are you doing here!?”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “I said take me to you leader!”

Her expression changed when she noticed his tone and the expression he had on his face. At this moment, she suddenly recalled that while Yang Ye’s cultivation was beneath hers, his strength was entirely sufficient to crush her. Once she adjusted her mentality, she glanced at him and said, “Come with me!”

She immediately turned around and walked off into the distance once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye glanced at her and followed her with Yun Banqing by his side.

Meanwhile, Yun Banqing’s voice resounded in his mind, “We have to be careful!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly. Even though he possessed Rebirth Rank sword intent, the people here were living fossils that had lived for countless years. So, it was impossible to know if they had other methods besides sword intent to deal with him. It was just like how he was a sword cultivator, but he could still kill Emperors even without the sword!

If these people in Sword God’s Palace were able to fight without their swords, then the pressure he exerted upon them would reduce drastically.

The beautiful woman led them towards the depths of the ruins. Yang Ye’s face gradually turned solemn as he traveled forward. Because he noticed that the surroundings were covered in all sorts of sword formations, and some would even be extremely troublesome to Emperors. Yet according to the beautiful woman in palace attire, they were only damaged formations, and they would even be capable of killing Emperors with ease if they were intact!

Most importantly, it was just the sword formations in the outer area. If it was the sword formations in the inner area or the sect guarding formation itself, then even Voiders might lose their lives!

There was another reason why Yang Ye had a solemn expression on his face, and it was because he’d once again experienced how strong the expert that destroyed Sword God’s Palace had been! After all, Sword God’s Palace had Voiders all those years ago, and it definitely had more than one Voider. As for Emperors, there would have been even more. Coupled with the grand formations it possessed.... However, Sword God’s Palace had still been destroyed!

Just thinking about the possibility of becoming enemies with such an expert caused a chill to run down Yang Ye’s spine.

After traveling for a while, a comparatively whole pavilion appeared before them.

Yang Ye asked, “This is the main hall?”

“Of course not!” She continued, “This is where we’re living. As for the main hall, it’s a few thousand kilometers away from here. But we can’t get in.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She replied, “There’s a sword formation around it, and it was set up by the founding ancestor himself. It’s boundlessly strong. We can’t get close to it at all.”

Yang Ye asked, “It wasn’t destroyed all those years ago?”

She answered, “It was, but its foundation is still intact. So, it’ll run by itself and stay active while there’s spirit energy around it.”

Yang Ye asked, “How strong is it?”

The beautiful woman glanced at Yang Ye before she said, “Very strong. Because the sword intent within it is above the Void Rank.”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched slightly. If it wasn’t Rebirth Rank sword intent, then dealing with the formation shouldn’t be a problem for him at all. But if it had Rebirth Rank sword intent within it, and it was even Jian Wuji’s sword intent, then it wasn’t easy at all. It was a huge problem! Even though he hadn’t seen the formation, how could the formation which covered the main hall of Sword God’s Palace be weak?

Yang Ye shook his head and restrained his thoughts. He stopped thinking about it because they’d arrived within the hall.

As soon as they entered, a green robed young man with a sword chest on his back walked over to them. He immediately frowned when he saw Yang Ye and Yun Banqing, “Outsiders?”

The beautiful woman said, “He’s a sword cultivator!”

“A sword cultivator?” The young man was stunned, and then he gazed at Yang Ye while disbelief filled his eyes, “You... you’re a sword cultivator from the outside world?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The young man’s voice was trembling as he said, “How did you do that?”

The beautiful women gazed at Yang Ye as well.

They’d been trapped here for countless years, so they naturally wanted to leave. Now, a sword cultivator had been able to get in here, and it was like suddenly catching a glimpse of light from within a pitch black abyss.

Yang Ye replied, “I hid my aura and sword intent!”

The young man hurriedly asked, “How did you hide it?” They could conceal their own aura and sword intent as well, but no matter how they did it, it was impossible to avoid that mysterious expert’s detection, and only death would be awaiting them if they left this place!

Yang Ye glanced at the young man, “Hide it just like that!”

The young man was stunned, and then a vicious glow flashed through his eyes, “You refuse to tell me?”

Yang Ye took a step forward, “It seems like you intend to attack me?”

The young man was about to speak when the beautiful woman hurriedly spoke, “Senior Brother, he’s here to....”

However, she hadn’t even finished speaking when the young man had instantly drawn his sword and swung it at Yang Ye. It was extremely swift and instantly arrived before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly as a cold glow flashed through his eyes. A moment later, he vanished on the spot. At the same time, a ray of light flashed.

Clang!

The clear and melodious sound of metal colliding resounded, and it didn’t take long for silence to sweep through the area.

Yang Ye was standing in front of the young man while holding a sword in his hand, and the tip of that sword was pressed against the center of the young man’s forehead. It was stabbed slightly through the young man’s skin, causing blood to seep out incessantly and dye his face red.

The young man stared blankly at Yang Ye, and his eyes were filled with absolute shock, “Sword intent above the Void Rank! How... how could this be possible?”

The beautiful woman gazed anxiously at Yang Ye. They would be helpless if Yang Ye really killed the young man.

After all, sword intent above the Void Rank was capable of completely suppressing them, unless they didn’t use the sword. But as sword cultivators, how much of their combat strengths would be left if they didn’t use the sword?

Fortunately, Yang Ye seemed to have no intention to kill. He withdrew his sword and gazed at the beautiful woman, “I’m not here to become enemies with all of you, but if some ignorant fellow attacks me....”

Yang Ye waved the sword in his right hand.

Hiss!

One of the young man’s arms instantly flew into the air.

The expressions of everyone here changed drastically at the sight of this. Even Yun Banqing’s eyelids twitched because she hadn’t expected Yang Ye to do that.

The young man didn’t let out a shrill cry from losing his arm, and he just gazed at Yang Ye with astonishment. Obviously, he’d been shocked by Yang Ye’s Rebirth Rank sword intent.

Yang Ye paid no attention to the man, and he gazed at the woman instead, “Where’s your leader?”

She glanced at Yang Ye and said, “He’s in closed door cultivation. I... I’ll go notify him right now. Wait a moment!” She glanced at the young man, Xing Feng, and the other green robed man. They understood what she meant and left the hall with her.

Once they left, only Yang Ye and Yun Banqing remained here.

Yun Banqing said, “You did that to deter them?”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “Everyone is afraid of the strong yet bullies the weak. If I didn’t reveal my strength, then some might try to play tricks.”

Yun Banqing pondered deeply for a moment and said, “I keep having the feeling that we might face some trouble.”

“They’ve gone mad with their desire to leave!” Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “They are really capable of anything for the sake of leaving this place.”

Yun Banqing asked, “Why didn’t you just say that you would take them out of this place, and then recruit them into the Sword Alliance?”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “The Sword Alliance doesn’t just accept anyone. Moreover, they’re used to considering themselves as superior, so do you think there’s a huge possibility that they would submit to me? Besides that, people never cherish things that they obtain too easily, and some would even feel like it was something I owed them. Just like that young man from before.”

Yun Banqing lowered her head slightly, “Human nature....” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Suddenly, Yang Ye frowned before the ground beneath his feet had suddenly transformed before numerous dark golden chains appeared below his feet, and they instantly chained him, Yun Banqing, and his Sword Servants. There were a few dozen of these chains, and they were at the Emperor Rank!

“I never expected that a sword cultivator would have actually come here, and it’s even one with sword intent above the Void Rank. How surprising!” As soon as this voice resounded, an old man in luxurious robes appeared before them. The beautiful woman and the young man who just lost an arm were beside the old man. Besides that, there were over 30 sword cultivators behind them, and there were both Emperors and Quasi Emperors amongst them!

Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto the old man, “We haven’t even talked, yet you’ve already acted like this?”

“What is there to talk about?” The old man walked over to Yang Ye and said, “See? I’m already very old, and this body is almost at its end. If I don’t have a new body to take, then it won’t be long before I die. Even though my cultivation would drop from that and I would never be able to advance further, isn’t living like a dog better than being a dead lion?”

Yang Ye asked, “You want to take over my body?”

“Of course!” The old man revealed a slight smile, “The heavens are really kind to me. Sword intent above the Void Rank, and at such a young age. You’re truly, truly perfect!”

As he spoke, the old man became excited, “Moreover, you have a technique to conceal the aura of a sword cultivator. You were sent by the heavens to save us! Hahaha!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
