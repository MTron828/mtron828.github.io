Chapter 2581

Content!

Yang Ye felt content at this moment. It was unlike anything he’d felt in the past. He’d felt something similar before, but it had been a very, very long time ago!

This time, he’d felt it again.

Battle!

When he recalled the past, he realized that he hadn’t had such a feeling in a long time, not even when he fought those two extraordinary experts from the Soul Sect in the air above the Ancient Sword Sect. The feeling he had then was lacking something.

But this time, he felt truly content!

Because he hadn’t relied on any external sources of strength. Moreover, after his endless supply of Primordial Violet Energy had vanished, he’d experienced exhaustion, a sense of danger, and the approach of death once more!

In the past, he could make mistakes in battle because even if he was injured, he would have Primordial Violet Energy to heal himself. So long as he wasn’t killed in an instant, his Primordial Violet Energy could always bring him back.

But it wasn’t the same this time. He couldn’t make too many mistakes because any mistake could cost him his life!

For example, that injury at his chest. If he suffered one more of those, he may not be able to stand again! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Now, he had to be even more cautious in battle, and he had to be more serious too.

He had to minimize his mistakes!

Besides that, when a person truly faced death, that person’s potential and courage would instantly rise to the peak!

Just like how some people wouldn’t hesitate to swallow anything when they were starving!

It was their desire to live!

In the past, he hadn’t had this desire to live. Because he had nothing to fear. As far as he was concerned, he had someone to rely on, and he had someone in the pagoda too. He felt that they would help him at the critical moment!

So, even in the face of danger, Yang Ye didn’t have such a desire to live because he didn’t sense the approach of death.

But this time, he sensed death approaching, and he had a strong desire to live in the face of death!

So, at the critical moment, he’d used his Madness Sword Technique. Actually, he was risking his life at that time. It was a moment where one of them would die, and it all depended on who could last longer!

Yang Ye had held on.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Qi Bitian was still kicking her ball against a mountain wall.

Meanwhile, Lei Lin was nibbling on a ball of lightning essence before the bamboo house.

Actually, the one who’d been improving the most in the pagoda was undoubtedly Lei Lin.

She was close to Snowy, Erya, the pool of lightning, and Qi Bitian. She was the most favored and pampered in the pagoda!

Because everyone treated her as their younger sister, the youngest one!

After eating for a while, Lei Lin gazed at Qi Bitian, “Sister Qi, I-I miss big brother.”

She repeated this frequently with the hopes that Qi Bitian would let Yang Ye back in!

Qi Bitian glanced at Lei Lin, “I’ll let him back in once he truly gets to know himself.”

Lei Lin spoke in a melodious voice, “What if he can’t?”

Qi Bitian grinned, “Go figure!”

Lei Lin shook her head, “I don’t know.”

Qi Bitian chuckled and didn’t say anything.

If he failed, then he would die!

…

Outside the Primordial Pagoda. On the bridge.

Yang Ye had sat up, and the injury on his chest was slowly healing.

He waved his right hand, and the intent sword returned to him. He grabbed it and stood up. His body felt quite exhausted as he’d lost that abnormal recovery of his!

It was because he had to conserve his Primordial Violet Energy!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and continued forward!

Two material intent swords were on either side of his waist!

Even if he couldn’t use the Sword Gourd, it doesn’t mean he couldn’t continue controlling flying swords as he’d done in the past!

It was still the same!

The bride had no end. At the very least, he couldn’t see one.

Around an hour later, Yang Ye’s face suddenly turned solemn. It was because he felt a gust of cold wind.

Wind!

Yang Ye glanced left and right, and the Boundless Water had suddenly started to ripple as well.

It was icy cold!

Yang Ye grew even more vigilant while he slowed down as well.

All sorts of people were in this place, so he had to be careful. Moreover, no ordinary person was able to get here. While that young saber cultivator from before wasn’t that strong, he had an extraordinary expert by his side!

But Yang Ye was all alone right now!

He knew that if he encountered danger, Qi Bitian would definitely not help him. He could sense that she wasn’t joking!

She was being serious!

So, he could only rely on himself here!

Yang Ye continued forward, and the cold winds grew stronger. At this point, they were slightly bone-piercing. It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to stop.

A woman in a black dress was floating not too far ahead of him. She just floated on the bridge while staring at the Boundless Water.

Yang Ye just continued forward without looking at her.

However, right when he was walking past her, the woman spoke abruptly, “I heard you’ve been down there, but you came back up!”

Yang Ye had quite the headache!

Sure enough, he was her target!

Can’t I ever encounter anything good?

Yang Ye stopped and turned to look at her. Her appearance wasn’t very outstanding, but she was definitely not ugly. She had average looks. Of course, he didn’t care about that right now, all he did care about was her strength.

However, he was disappointed!

He couldn’t see through it at all!

So, there was only one explanation, she was much, much stronger than him!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and nodded, “I have been down there.”

She gazed at him, “Can you go down there again?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m afraid that I can’t.”

She just gazed at him in silence.

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “I really can’t. If I go down there now, I’m afraid I’ll be crushed into bits.”

She asked, “Then can you go down there in the future?”

Yang Ye glanced at her, hesitated for a moment, and asked, “You want me to go down there?”

She nodded slightly. She pointed at the Boundless Water and said, “There are two corpses down there. Can you help me bring them back up here?”

Yang Ye replied, “I’m afraid I can’t.”

She gazed at Yang Ye in silence! However, Yang Ye could clearly feel the cold winds in the surroundings becoming violent!

She was clearly on the verge of attacking!

Yang Ye hurriedly said, “But I can in the future. I need some time!”

The cold winds in the surroundings suddenly calmed down.

She gazed at him in silence and waited for him to continue.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “It’s a secret technique that can only be used once a month. I’ve used it earlier, so I need a month before I can use it again. So, I can only go down there next month!”

She remained silent.

Yang Ye shrugged, “Senior, if you don’t believe me, I can’t do anything about it.”

Meanwhile, she suddenly flicked a strand of cold wind into Yang Ye’s forehead.

The cold wind appeared within Yang Ye’s sea of consciousness, but he didn’t feel uncomfortable at all. However, he could sense its presence!

She gazed at the dark water below, “Come look for me here in a month from now!”

Yang Ye took a deep and long glance at her before walking away.

After walking for a very, very long time, the cold winds finally vanished.

Yang Ye leaned against the side of the bridge, looked down at the water below, and fell into deep thought.

Weak!

He was a weakling. Earlier, he had to do anything she wanted or he would die!

The strong could willfully impose their will on the weak, but the weak only had two choices. Resist and die, or accept it. But even if they accepted it, it may still end with their death!

He wouldn’t care about it in the past because he had a terrifying young girl in the pagoda.

With just a casual wave of her hand, that cold wind within his sea of consciousness would be eliminated!

Yet now, he didn’t have her help anymore, so he couldn’t do anything about it. Conversely, he was certain that the woman could use the cold wind to kill him at any moment!

Yang Ye laughed with self-ridicule. He realized that once he had no backing or people to support him, he was an absolute weakling!

Yang Ye stopped and looked up at the sky. The sky was completely gray, and he couldn’t see anything up there. A short while later, he looked down at his sword, the sword condensed from sword intent!

He fell silent for a long time before he turned around and went back the way he’d come.

Some time later, he arrived before that woman again.

She gazed at him.

Yang Ye chuckled, “I gave it some thought, and I felt that your attitude wasn’t right. So, I’ve decided that I don’t want to help you!”

As soon as these words were spoken, Yang Ye felt the rock stuck in his heart had instantly vanished.

Light!

He felt light from top to bottom!

The intent sword in his grasp started to tremble violently.

She gazed at him for a long time, and when she realized that he wasn’t joking, she attacked.

Bang!

Yang Ye wasn’t even able to see how she’d attacked before he was blasted over 3km away!

Bang!

Yang Ye slammed against the ground. His book shook violently while blood surged from his mouth.

However, Yang Ye was smiling.

It was quite a pale smile.

“Haha!” Yang Ye stood up while laughing. As soon as he was on his feet, a few mouthfuls of blood sprayed from him. He walked over to the woman again, and she gazed at him in silence.

However, the cold winds in the surroundings grew increasingly violent, and the water on both sides of the bridge started to ripple.

Yang Ye took a few more steps forward and looked her in the eyes, “If you spoke to me properly, I may have helped you. If I’m willing to help you, it’s out of kindness, but if I refuse, it’s within my rights. Because I have no obligation to help you. Besides that, I, Yang Ye, never give in to threats! I would rather die than bow before anyone!”

Boom!

As soon as he finished speaking, boundless sword intent swept out from Yang Ye like the tide!

Powerful sword intent rippled out into the surroundings, causing the Boundless Water in the area to tremble before gradually rippling as well…

A monstrous desire to fight!
