Chapter 2641 – Ancestor!

Sky Maiden gazed at Yang Ye in silence.

Yang Ye stood there and didn’t say anything either.

Around an hour later, Yang Ye left the Void World.

Not long after he left, Sky Maiden stood up and started walking toward the outside world.

Suddenly, the Void Lord appeared near here, “Are you leaving?”

She glanced at him, “I can’t?”nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The Void Lord spoke solemnly, “You promised that existence…”

Sky Maiden laughed coldly.

She didn’t say a word and just walked off toward the distance. But she suddenly said after taking a few steps away, “I want to take that thing.”

“No!” The Void Lord spoke angrily, “It’s a precious treasure of my void race. You…”

“Then let’s fight!” As soon as she finished speaking, the entire Void World shook, and a wave of mysterious energy started to devour the entire Void World.

The Void Lord’s expression instantly changed.

A short while later, he spoke solemnly, “You can take it!”

Sky Maiden turned around and left.

Once she left, the Void Lord sighed softly, “That insane woman…”

…

Once he left the Void World, Yang Ye didn’t go straight to the End World.

He was very well aware of what he would be facing this time, so he couldn’t act carelessly or underestimate his enemies. His objective was to save them. He could die, but Blood Maiden and the others could not.

So, even if his hatred was surging, he was still restraining himself.

Yang Ye left Eternal Kingdom and arrived in Eternal Border. He used the Myriad World Diagram to arrive at the Northern Sword Sect.

Yang Ye went underground.

Chen Xuanan was still here.

Chen Xuanan looked up at Yang Ye upon noticing Yang Ye’s arrival. In the end, his gaze descended upon the sword in Yang Ye’s grasp.

At this moment, Executor wasn’t the same anymore.

Chen Xuanan asked, “Are you in trouble?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Chen Xuanan smiled, “I’m quite surprised that you’ve come to me. Based on your character, you would never easily ask for my help.”

Yang Ye said, “They took my friends.”

Chen Xuanan nodded, “I see.”

Yang Ye glanced at Chen Xuanan and said, “Master, can you help?”

Chen Xuanan chuckled, “You’ve even called me master, so I have to even if I can’t. Come with me to a place.”

Yang Ye asked, “Where?”

Chen Xuanan smiled, “When it comes to fighting, and especially when fighting in a group battle, you naturally need more people. Give me that diagram of yours.”

Yang Ye didn’t refuse and gave him the Myriad World Diagram. Chen Xuanan glanced at it, and then a spot on it trembled slightly.

An instant later, they vanished on the spot.

Some time later, Yang Ye felt his feet touching the ground again.

Yang Ye opened his eyes. He was in a wasteland and only a scene of desolation was before him.

Yang Ye gazed at Chen Xuanan, “What is this place?”

Chen Xuanan replied softly, “Where I once trained in the sword!”

He floated slowly toward the distance!

Where he trained in the sword?

Yang Ye was slightly stunned and hurried after him.

Yang Ye followed Chen Xuanan all the way forward, and it didn’t take long for him to see a cottage on the peak of a nearby mountain range. It was a very simple cottage.

They arrived before the cottage, and there were two wooden swords by its door.

A big and a small wooden sword.

There was a furnace near the cottage, and within it was blazing flames. Within the flames was another sword.

Yang Ye glanced at Chen Xuanan and remained silent.

Chen Xuanan floated over to the two swords, and he touched them lightly in silence.

A long time later, Chen Xuanan went over to the door and looked at Yang Ye, “Come meet your Ancestor.”

My ancestor?

Yang Ye was stunned.

I have an ancestor?

Chen Xuanan suddenly said, “What are you still standing there for?”

Yang Ye returned to his senses and hurried over to the cottage before bowing in its direction. However, he wasn’t able to complete the box because a strand of terrifying sword intent enveloped him!

It was like a million mountains pressing down upon him, and it seemed like it wanted to obliterate him.

Chen Xuanan didn’t say a word.

Yang Ye glanced at the cottage, and then a strand of powerful sword intent swept out of him. But in just an instant, Yang Ye’s sword intent was suppressed.

Just like that, Yang Ye’s sword intent was gradually suppressed back into him!

Yang Ye naturally wasn’t willing to be suppressed, so he unleashed the Sword Domain. Once the Sword Domain appeared, the pressure on his entire body was alleviated quite a bit. But it only took a moment for the sword intent to suddenly grow stronger, and even his Sword Domain started to be suppressed.

Yang Ye frowned slightly, and then Executor appeared in his grasp. A moment later, he stabbed it forward.

The Domain Sword!

This attack contained dual intents and dual Domains.

Hiss!

It seemed like something was sliced open, and then the mysterious sword intent vanished like a receding tide.

Yang Ye returned to normal.

Yang Ye gazed at Chen Xuanan, and the latter nodded slightly before indicating that Yang Ye should move aside.

Yang Ye nodded and moved to the side.

Chen Xuanan gazed in the door’s direction and smiled bitterly, “Master…”

“Scram!” A furious shout came from within the cottage.

Yang Ye frowned when he heard this.

Chen Xuanan wasn’t angry at all, “Master, he’s my disciple now. Since he’s my disciple, he’s your grand disciple. I’m sure you’ve noticed that he’s practically unmatched among the younger generation of this universe, and even if he’s compared to you from your time. No, no… I mean if he’s compared to me from my time, he’s not inferior at all. So…”

Suddenly, a strand of powerful sword energy shot out of the cottage.

Yang Ye’s expression changed. He was about to stop it when Chen Xuanan stopped Yang Ye, and the sword energy stopped just a few inches away from Chen Xuanan’s forehead.

Chen Xuanan laughed bitterly, “Master, I’m already dead, so I’m not afraid of vanishing completely from this world. This little fellow is in trouble now. I’m sure you know that it’s impossible for him to help him in the state I’m in. I’ve never asked you for anything in my lifetime, but today, I beg you to help him. Please.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Chen Xuanan’s body gradually turned ethereal.

Yang Ye’s expression changed from the sight of this, “Master… You…”

Chen Xuanan gazed at Yang Ye and smiled, “I should have gone a long time ago. I’ve been holding on until now with the hopes of seeing how far my disciple can go… Now, it’s really time for me to go.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “The heavens were good to me. I’ve always been very satisfied with you. Because even now, your loved ones are always more important to you. You’re much better than me because your heart has never changed, but mine did. I ceased to be myself. For the sake of the so-called Sword Dao, I disappointed many, many people, even my own master. Unfortunately, I can’t do it all over again.”

His figure gradually vanished as he spoke.

Meanwhile, a strand of sword intent suddenly enveloped Chen Xuanan. Chen Xuanan glanced at the cottage, “Master, I disappointed you.”

His figure vanished completely.

He was truly gone from this world.

Yang Ye stared blankly ahead. In the end, he bowed slightly toward where Chen Xuanan had been, and then he turned around and walked away.

Not long after Yang Ye left, the door of the cottage was pushed open.

An old man in a plain robe emerged from within the cottage. He gazed at the spot Chen Xuanan had vanished from for a long time. In the end, two streams of clear liquid seeped out of the corners of his eyes.

Even though they were master and disciple, they were like father and son.

The old man walked over to the two swords and stroked the small sword gently. A long time passed before he straightened his figure and walked down the mountain.

Bang!

The furnace outside the cottage exploded apart, and then a fiery red sword shot up into the air. A moment later, it descended like a fire dragon as it chased after the old man.

Yang Ye left that world. He arrived at Darkspace this time.

As soon as he arrived, the Dark Lord appeared before Yang Ye.

The Dark Lord glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent. Obviously, she knew what he wanted.

Yang Ye said, “Shall we talk about your conditions?”

The Dark Lord shook her head, “I won’t interfere.”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “You wish to protect this world?”

The Dark Lord replied indifferently, “No matter what changes in the outside world, my Darkspace will remain the same. It’s because my Darkspace never interferes in the conflict of the outside world.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and nodded, “I understand.”

He was about to leave once he finished speaking, but the Dark Lord suddenly said, “Perhaps there is someone else you can go to.”

Yang Ye stopped and gazed at the Dark Lord, “Who is it?”

The Dark Lord replied, “The owner of the underground trade area in the War Dimension. Of course, if you want that person to help you, you’ll have to pay a certain price.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand.”

Yang Ye turned around and was about to leave. However, the Dark Lord suddenly flicked a pitch black mirror to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What is this?”

She replied, “The Dark Mirror. It can counter certain existences. It will be helpful to you.”

Yang Ye glanced at her, “Why?”

The Dark Lord replied, “I want to gain a favor.”

She was very direct!

Yang Ye didn’t refuse it. He cupped his fist and said, “Thank you!”

He turned around and vanished on the spot.

Once Yang Ye left, the Dark Lord slowly scanned the surroundings. This world was growing more and more unsettled.

Once he left the Darkspace, Yang Ye went to the underground trade area in the War Dimension.

At this moment, the street was empty.

Yang Ye arrived before the small house. As soon as he entered, a voice resounded, “I can give you two peak Destiny Realm experts.”
