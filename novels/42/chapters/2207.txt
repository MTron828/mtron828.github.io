Chapter 2208 – I Can Still Fight!

One on one!

The woman who led the group revealed a ridiculing smile, “One on one? What? You’re afraid?”

Afraid? Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “I do know a little about the undying race, and you were once matchless in the universe. Nothing was left in your wake. However, now that I’ve met you, I’m quite disappointed. Is this the legendary matchless undying race? You lose in a one on one battle, so you gang up on me? Tsk, tsk. I’m disappointed, too disappointed!”

The undying cavalry in the lead instantly revealed quite an unsightly expression.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “I understand now. So, you’re afraid, and that’s why you brought so many with you!”

“Afraid of you?” A ridiculing smile curled up on her face, “Who do you think you are?”

“Then fight me one on one?” Yang Ye gazed at her, “Let’s fight one on one, right now. I challenge you! Do you dare to accept?”

She slowly clenched her fists.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “If you dare not, that’s fine too. All of you can gang up on me.”

“You think you’re very strong?” Meanwhile, an undying cavalry walked over to Yang Ye, “You’re very strong?”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “Not that strong. But if it’s a one on one battle, then I can fight as many of you as there are!”

“How laughable!” The undying cavalry laughed coldly, “Come, let me see it for myself!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she stabbed her spear at Yang Ye, and the powerful force it carried caused the space around Yang Ye to form a strange vortex!

However, along with a blood red flash of light, that undying cavalry was blasted over 10km away!

The others frowned when they witnessed this.

When Yang Ye met an undying cavalry for the first time, they’d been equally matched. Yet now, after he obtained the Primordial Pagoda’s acknowledgment, his strength was much stronger than it had been. While he still couldn’t instantly kill one of them, if it was just a one on one battle, then not to mention undying cavalries, he even had some confidence in being able to defeat a progenitor.

However, if all of them ganged up on him, then he would have no choice but to flee. It was alright if he was just against one or two, but he couldn’t fight against many.

Meanwhile, that undying cavalry glanced at her own hand. At this moment, it had cracked open.

She looked up at Yang Ye and was about to attack when she suddenly looked to the side. A woman was walking slowly in their direction.

It was another undying cavalry!

However, this undying cavalry was slightly different from the rest. Her spear wasn’t black but gold.

All of them immediately bowed at the sight of her, “Commander!” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Commander!

In the Undying Army, the Exalted Lord was the strongest, and she commanded the entire army. Below her were the commanders. There were only a few commanders in the entire army, and they were elites the Exalted Lord selected herself. They were in charge of the Undying Army while the Exalted Lord wasn’t present.

Every single one of these commanders possessed top-rate strength, and they were outstanding in every other aspect as well!

The commander nodded slightly and walked slowly to Yang Ye, “You’re that Yang Ye who’d renowned throughout the large universe right now?”

Yang Ye lowered his sword and gazed at her, “I don’t think there’s another one.”

She looked at him for a long time, and then she said, “My undying race cherishes talent, so are you willing to join us? Based on your natural talent and potential, I’ll ask the Exalted Lord to bestow the Undying Physique upon you.”

Join the undying race? Yang Ye shook his head, “Sorry, I’m not interested in the Undying Physique.”

The commander nodded slightly, “I see.”

As she spoke, she looked down at Void Spirit Continent, “Do you know about this continent’s history?”

Yang Ye was just about to speak when she continued, “This continent is called Void Spirit Continent. All those years ago, there was an extremely powerful race that lived here. Amongst them was a person, Void Spirit Maiden.”

Void Spirit Maiden!

The undying cavalries here looked down at the continent below. Presently, Void Spirit Continent wasn’t quite similar to how it had been, and all of them revealed various emotions as they gazed at it.

Void Spirit Maiden!

Someone the undying race would never forget!

Meanwhile, the commander continued, “You should thank her. Out of respect for someone strong like her, my undying race isn’t willing to step foot on this continent.”

She turned around and walked away once she finished speaking.

The other undying cavalries followed behind her.

They were unwilling to step foot on the continent!

Respect!

Even though Void Spirit Maiden had heavily injured the undying race all those years ago, she’d won their respect!

Presently, no one knew how horrifying that battle had been.

It was the worst battle the undying race had ever experienced.

It was that woman with Netherworld Destiny in her hand who’d practically crushed the entire undying race!

The undying cavalries had left, but Yang Ye’s heart felt heavy.

An impossible dilemma!

If the undying cavalries really did attack, then he wouldn’t be able to stop them at all. If An Nanjing was with him, then perhaps he could stop them by joining forces with her! But An Nanjing…

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s figure stiffened, and then he vanished on the spot.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye appeared in the 2nd level of the Primordial Pagoda. There were quite a few people here, like Little Sky, Zi’er, and Snowy. At this moment, all of them were looking at An Nanjing who was lying there on the bed.

Yang Ye walked over to the side of her bed, and he sensed a faint strand of energy fluctuating around her.

Yang Ye gazed at Little Sky while his voice trembled slightly, “Is she?”

Little Sky spoke softly, “She’s about to wake up!”

About to wake up!

Yang Ye turned around and looked at An Nanjing. With the Primordial Violet Energy there to incessantly restore her body, An Nanjing was finally on the verge of fully recovering.

An Nanjing!

Yang Ye sat by her bed and held her hand.

Just like that, he sat there for almost three days. Suddenly, An Nanjing’s eyelids twitched, and Yang Ye’s heart instantly tightened. A moment later, her eyes gradually opened.

An Nanjing seemed a little lost, but it didn’t take long for her gaze to gradually clear up. A short while later, she gazed at Yang Ye, and Yang Ye spoke softly, “You’re awake?”

An Nanjing nodded slightly, “Yes!”

Yang Ye asked, “How do you feel?”

She stood up slowly and said, “I can still fight!”

I can still fight!

Just a few words made two strings of blood red silently flow down from Yang Ye’s eyes.

She’d almost died for him in battle that day, and it was she who had forcefully kept so many Sages busy for him.

What he owed her was practically impossible to repay in a few lifetimes!

An Nanjing stretched out her hand and wiped off his tears of blood, “You’ll lose face if anyone else sees that!”

Yang Ye took her hand, “Men don’t cry easily. I didn’t cry, I bled.”

An Nanjing shook her head slightly and took his hand, “In the past, I feared nothing, not even death. Yet now, I’m afraid. I’m afraid no one will fight with you once I’m gone.”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Then don’t die and stay with me all the way!”

She nodded slightly, “Alright!”

An Nanjing was awake!

Cultivate!

Once she regained consciousness, An Nanjing started cultivating. Besides Yang Ye, An Nanjing was another cultivation addict, just like him. In her world, Yang Ye was number one, and the Martial Dao was number two.

Besides that, she didn’t care about anything else!

Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda and went to Void Spirit Hall.

Void Spirit Hall!

At this moment, Situ Tingyun, Nether Maiden, and the others were cultivating here. The gravity here was able to greatly improve their strength. Chaotic times were upon them, so regardless of whether it was Yang Ye or them, they had to improve their strength as soon as possible.

Besides Void Spirit Continent, the entire large universe was in chaos now!

It was a slaughter!

The undying cavalry of the undying race was madly slaughtering throughout all the races, and the entire large universe was covered in howls of sorrow!

Meanwhile, the Dao Path stepped forward and formed an alliance with the other two Paths and the Alliance of All—The World Alliance.

It was an alliance led by the Dao Path.

However, the World Alliance didn’t fight the undying cavalries but chose to shrink back into a defensive position. Even then, the undying cavalries were still rampaging through the entire large universe.

But they didn’t attack the World Alliance as well.

The other race had countless worlds. In order to defend themselves against the undying race, they had no choice but to shrink their lines of defense and abandon some of those worlds. As for the people in those worlds, it was impossible to take those people with them.

Simply speaking, the experts left and the weak remained.

Now, the World Alliance only took in the elites!

While it was quite cruel, they had no other choice! They needed the elites to fight against the undying race!

As for the weak, they became food for the undying cavalries.

Slaughter intent1

Meanwhile, Yang Ye snuck out of Void Spirit Continent.

He started traveling the world.

Slaughter intent!

Countless had died miserably throughout the large universe, and blood had been spilt incessantly. This made Yang Ye sense unprecedented levels of slaughter intent and blood. Both of them were things that he really hoped to obtain right now.

Absorb!

Absorb the slaughter intent and blood.

However, Yang Ye overlooked something, and it was the most important thing.

He wasn’t just absorbing slaughter intent and blood, there was resentment and hatred too!

Countless weak people had died, so how strong was their resentment and hatred toward the world?

After he absorbed an innumerable amount of hatred and resentment that was accompanied by slaughter intent and blood, Yang Ye’s slaughter intent, and even himself, had started to soundlessly undergo some kind of change.

Somewhere in the world, Yang Ye stood on the ground while countless strands of blood and slaughter intent converged toward him.

It was like rivers converging into the ocean!
