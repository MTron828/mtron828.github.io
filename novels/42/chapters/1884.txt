Chapter 1885 – It’s None Of His Business!

Teach Snowy sword techniques?

That was an absolutely terrifying thing!

Snowy wasn’t mischievous at all times, but when she was, she simply had no limits. Especially in the Primordial Pagoda. She had the Primordial Pagoda to support her, so she was truly untouchable. So, once she learned sword techniques, the two of them would definitely be the first to suffer!

If Snowy used an ordinary sword, they would naturally not fear her. However, Snowy was using the Sovereign of Man’s sword!

It was a sword that could pierce their defenses!

Snowy was stunned when she heard them, and then she gazed at them. This time, she didn’t blink at them, she was glaring at them.

Hou Qing and Qiong Qi felt a chill run down their spines because they’d been so anxious that they’d forgotten to use voice transmissions.

Now, they were in trouble!

Suddenly, Qiong Qi pointed at Hou Qing, “He’s the one who said it. He made me say it!”

Snowy immediately gazed at Hou Qing.

Hou Qing was at a loss for words.

In the end, Snowy finally let the matter rest after Hou Qing apologized incessantly, and Yang Ye started to teach Snowy and Xue’er sword techniques.

After that, Yang Ye accompanied Su Qingshi and the others every day.

Meanwhile, nothing happened in Heaven Pillar Mountain as well. It was a rare time of peace!

Around two weeks later, Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda and went to the 11th level of Heaven Pillar Mountain.

He’d naturally not forgotten his agreement with the patriarch of the Sky Devil Race.

Yun Bi was waiting for him.

“Come with me!” As soon as she finished speaking, she transformed into a ray of dark light that shot up into the sky.

Yang Ye tapped his right foot down, and then a ray of light flashed. It didn’t take long for them to arrive high above in the sky.

Yun Bi glanced at the surroundings, and then she stretched her right hand forward. The space around her seemed like it suffered a heavy blow, and it shook violently before a multicolored barrier of light appeared above them.

Yang Ye asked, “That’s the barrier?”

She nodded, “That’s what has been imprisoning my race for countless years.” She gazed at Yang Ye as she finished speaking.

Yang Ye nodded slightly. He looked down at his right hand, and then a ray of golden light flashed before a sword appeared there.

Yang Ye looked up at the barrier, and then a ray of golden sword energy shot up into the air. It only took a moment for it to strike the barrier.

Boom!

In an instant, space shook violently, but the barrier didn’t disperse at all. However, some cracks had appeared on it.

Yun Bi warned, “Don’t underestimate it! Even though countless years have passed, and it’s at its weakest, it’s still something an almighty figure placed here. It has its advantages.”

Yang Ye nodded. He took a step forward, and the Sword Domain swept out.

In an instant, a ray of golden light flashed.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Rumbling resounded incessantly. As the rumbling resounded, the multicolored barrier of light gradually started to turn ethereal.

Around a quarter of an hour later…

Boom!

The barrier exploded apart, and it transformed into countless pieces of energy that rained down from the sky.

At this moment, Yang Ye heard countless cheers come from down below.

Yang Ye paid no attention to them. He put his sword away and gazed at Yun Bi, “Senior, we don’t owe each other anything now.”

Yun Bi gazed at Yang Ye in silence.

Yang Ye chuckled, “Senior, you aren’t thinking of killing me, right?”

Yun Bi shook her head, “Why would I kill you?”

Yang Ye smiled, “It was quite scary to be stared at like that!”

She replied, “You should be aware that my race has a special ability, and it’s the ability to see a person’s future. Of course, the future is uncertain, but some of it is fixed.”

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, what are you trying to say?”

She replied, “I saw a future related to you!”

Yang Ye frowned. He was about to speak when Yun Bi said, “Of course, I saw your future through the people around you. I’m unable to see through your future because some sort of mysterious force is helping you conceal it. However, I can see some through the people around you.”

She paused for a moment and said, “They seem to be in a lot of pain!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while, and then he smiled, “Just as you’ve said, the future is uncertain. Even if it may be fixed sometimes, so what? Why do we cultivate? It’s so that we can change our fate. Sometimes, the heavens are the master of a man’s fate, but there are also times when a man is the master of his own fate.”

He looked up at the sky and said, “Poverty or wealth; cowardly or brave; everything in life actually depends on us.”

“The heart of the strong!” Yun Bi grinned, “The strong never give up. I believe we’ll meet again.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye fell silent for a while, and then he left the 11th level.

He didn’t leave Heaven Pillar Mountain, and he went up instead. It didn’t take long for him to arrive at the 12th level.

The final level in Heaven Pillar Mountain!

The barrier!

Zi’er and Xiao Qi were up there, and Blood Maiden could only be revived in the upper universe. So, he had to go up there.

As soon as he stepped into the 12th level, an extremely powerful aura slammed down towards him.

It was strong!

Extremely strong!

It was much stronger than Yun Bi!

At this moment, Yang Ye felt like his entire body was about to explode apart.

Yang Ye stomped his right foot down, and the Sword Domain swept out. A ray of light flashed.

Hiss!

It sounded like something was sliced apart.

“Hmm?” Suddenly, an exclamation of surprise resounded.

A moment later, the clouds were split apart, and a huge dragon head emerged from the clouds.

The dragon head descended to around 300m away from Yang Ye. It looked down at Yang Ye with indifference like a divine god looking down at an ant.

The huge dragon was the Candle Dragon!

Yang Ye looked up and met the dragon’s gaze without revealing any fear.

The Candle Dragon suddenly said, “It’s you!”

He naturally recognized Yang Ye. As for why he did, it was because of Xiao Qi.

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, you didn’t go to the upper universe?”

The Candle Dragon replied, “That’s none of your business.”

Yang Ye shrugged, “I was just asking!”

The Candle Dragon looked down at Yang Ye, “Human, I don’t care what your relationship with Xiao Qi is, but you must realize that her status is something far beyond your reach. Both of you…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye waved his hand and said, “Senior, allow me to be honest. This is between me and her.”

The Candle Dragon’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then an extremely powerful wave of dragon pressure rained down from the sky.

Dragon pressure!

True dragon pressure. It was even more terrifying than the might of nature. At this moment, Yang Ye felt like the sky was about to collapse.

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he stepped forward.

The Sword Domain swept out.

As soon as that happened, an ethereal sword flickered within the Sword Domain, and the dragon pressure was instantly sliced into countless pieces.

“The Sword Domain!” The Candle Dragon spoke abruptly with slight surprise in his voice.

Yang Ye glanced at the Candle Dragon, and then he looked up at the sky. He could sense an invisible barrier high up in the sky, and it was much, much stronger than the barrier he’d just destroyed.

He wasn’t confident in his ability to succeed!

He wasn’t confident at all!

He remained silent for quite some time, and then he turned around and walked away.

Suddenly, the Candle Dragon said, “What’s your relationship with Xiao Qi?”

Yang Ye stopped and replied, “Friends!”

“Friends?” The Candle Dragon spoke in a low voice, “Kid, you possess the Heart of Slaughter and have comprehended Slaughter Intent. But all of that isn’t even important. Most importantly, you’ve cultivated a devil cultivation technique and the techniques of the shaman race. Her father will definitely eliminate you if he finds out!”

Yang Ye turned to gaze at the Candle Dragon, “Senior, you are from the upper universe, so you know the Shaman Progenitor, right?”

The Candle Dragon replied, “Of course I do!”

Yang Ye said, “Since the Sovereign of Man and Sovereign of Sky are that good and powerful, why don’t they kill the Shaman Progenitor?”

The Candle Dragon was speechless.

Yang Ye laughed with disdain, “Goodness is just a lie. Being afraid of the strong and bullying the weak is the truth of it. As for the Sovereign of Sky… Allow me to be honest, I’m friends with his daughter and not friends with him. Who I am and what I cultivate is none of his fucking business!”

The Candle Dragon started laughing from extreme anger, “Kid, do you know that you’re really arrogant?”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “I don’t!”

The Candle Dragon said, “Kid, don’t even think you’re very strong because you’ve grasped the Sword Domain. The Sovereign of Man and Sovereign of Sky’s strength far surpass you. Not to mention them, even some of their subordinates are enough to kill you. You should always be…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye interrupted the Candle Dragon, “How long have they been living for?”

The Candle Dragon was speechless. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Yang Ye looked the Candle Dragon in the eyes, “If I’m given another 10 years, then both of them will have to kneel before me.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and left.

The Candle Dragon was stunned on the spot.

…

Once he left Heaven Pillar Mountain, Yang Ye was about to go to Yang Lianshuang and the others when an ear piercing howl resounded from near him. After that, a golden rod swept through the sky.

Bang!

A rumbling explosion resounded. At this moment, the entire mountain was trembling violently!

The monkey? Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and shot off in that direction.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to see the monkey, and the bald middle aged man was in front of the monkey.

There was a palm-sized golden figure on the bald man’s hand, and it was covered in golden light.

When he saw Yang Ye, the monkey suddenly said, “You’re finally here. Come! Will you fight him yourself, or shall we gang up on him?”

Yang Ye gazed at the monkey with shock in his eyes.
