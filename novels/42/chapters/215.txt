Yang Ye would naturally not allow Xiao Lang to die just like that. When Xiao Lang’s neck was about to come into contact with Violet Spirit, Yang Ye issued a command in his heart, and Violet Spirit transformed into a violet glow that flew into his grasp.

After he failed to commit suicide, Xiao Lang’s figure shook before he returned to his human form, and then he gazed at Yang Ye with eyes that blazed with fury. He howled furiously and said, “Human, are you trying to humiliate me?” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Humiliate you?” Yang Ye shook his head, and then he sighed. “Xiao Lang, you spoke earlier about how we humans loved to go back on our word, but aren’t the Darkbeasts of your Darkbeast Empire the same? We have a bet that you would follow by my side for 10 years if you lost, yet you chose to go back on your word. I truly look down upon you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye held the violet mink in his arms before leaving. The violet mink seemed to be very unwilling, but it chose to respect Yang Ye’s decision and didn’t cause trouble!

As he gazed at Yang Ye and the violet mink’s figures moving towards the distance, Xiao Lang’s expression changed. After a short while, he took a deep breath and said, “Human, don’t use such inferior methods to prod me into action. I, Xiao Lang, accept my loss. From today onwards, I’ll be your subordinate!”

When he heard this, the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth raised slightly while a wisp of happiness arose on his face. When he turned around to look at Xiao Lang, the expression on his face had become calm once more, and he said, “Are you sure?”

“Of course!” Xiao Lang grunted coldly, and then he said, “But I have a condition. I get to challenge you once every single year during these 10 years of time, and I’ll continue being your subordinate if I lose. However, I can leave if I defeat you. Alright?”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a brief moment before he nodded and said, “Alright!”

In Yang Ye’s opinion, having an expert by his side that ceaselessly urged him on was a good thing because only with pressure would there be motivation!

“How can I trust you!?” Yang Ye gazed at Xiao Lang and spoke in a deep voice. He would definitely be placing Xiao Lang within his Vortex Dantian, but Xiao Lang was a King Rank Darkbeast who possessed formidable strength. So, Yang Ye would naturally be unable to be at ease with Xiao Lang there. After all, he didn’t dare allow the existence of the Vortex Dantian to be exposed, otherwise, there would probably be no place in the southern territory for him!

Xiao Lang frowned and said, “Human, I, Xiao Lang, keep my word. Since I’ve said that I would follow you for 10 years, then I will!”

Yang Ye shook his head lightly, and then he gazed at the violet mink as he hoped it would have a way to resolve this.

The violet mink understood Yang Ye’s intentions. It blinked and remained silent for a short while, and then its eyes lit up. Its figure flashed to arrive between Yang Ye and Xiao Lang, and then it waved its little claw lightly towards Xiao Lang, causing strands of thin violet light to instantly slice open a thin gap at the center of Xiao Lang’s brows. After that, it waved its little claw towards the space between Yang Ye’s brows, and then a thin gap appeared there as well.

Under Yang Ye and Xiao Lang’s puzzled gazes, the little fellow waved its little claw once more, and then a drop of blood suddenly flew out from that gap at the center of both their brows. Under the envelopment of violet light, the two drops of blood gradually fused together, and as they fused together, a strange mark was gradually condensed into form at the center of Xiao Lang’s brows.

Right at this moment, Xiao Lang’s face turned pale from fright, and he gazed at the violet mink while he spoke with terror. “The Soul Contract! It’s actually the Soul Contract! The Soul Contract technique was lost for over 10,000 years. Exactly what sort of Darkbeast are you to know this ancient secret technique....”

The violet mink paid no attention to Xiao Lang, and it waved its claw once more, causing the pearl of blood within the violet light to instantly fly into the cut in the space between Yang Ye’s brows. At the same time, Yang Ye had a strange feeling. He didn’t know how to describe it in a specific manner, but in any case, there seemed to be a connection between him and Xiao Lang. No, it ought to be described as being able to sense everything related to Xiao Lang!

The violet mink patted its little claws together, and then its figure flashed and directly descended onto Yang Ye’s shoulder.

“Little Fellow, what exactly is going on?” Yang Ye gazed at the violet mink on his shoulder and frowned as he asked this question.

“It’s the Soul Contract!” It was Xiao Lang who answered Yang Ye. Xiao Lang seemed as if he’d lost his soul as he gazed at the violet mink, and he muttered. “It’s a secret technique the humans created over 10,000 years ago, and it’s able to form an unfair contract between humans and my Darkbeast race and enslave my Darkbeast Race. At that time, my Darkbeast race had been almost annihilated by this contract. In the end, an extraordinary genius appeared in my Darkbeast Empire, and with him in the lead, a war that lasted over 1,000 years occurred between my Darkbeast Empire and the humans. In the end, you humans had no choice but to make a compromise and destroy all such techniques that could control Darkbeasts. After that, no one in the southern territory had knowledge about such secret techniques. But I never imagined that it would actually know this technique!”

When he spoke up to here, Xiao Lang’s expression suddenly became savage, and he gazed at the violet mink while he roared. “Since you’re a member of my Darkbeast race, then why utilize such a secret technique against my Darkbeast race for the sake of a human? Could it be that you don’t know the severity of the threat it would pose to my Darkbeast race once such a secret technique spreads to the outside world? Why? Why have you done this?”

The violet mink blinked and didn’t answer Xiao Lang. It just waved its claw, and then Xiao Lang was directly transported into Yang Ye’s Vortex Dantian.

After he entered Yang Ye’s Vortex Dantian, Xiao Lang was dazed as he gazed at everything before him, and his expression changed when he saw those seven King Rank Darkbeasts. In next to no time, his gaze moved away from those seven King Rank Darkbeasts because he’d noticed the pool of golden profound energy. When he saw the pool, Xiao Lang’s eyes suddenly lit up, and then he instinctively pounced towards it!

However, right at this moment, the violet mink suddenly appeared in front of him. At the same time, all the seven King Rank Darkbeasts at the side had arrived by the violet mink’s side before they surrounded Xiao Lang at the center. What a joke! They’d been here for so long yet never had the chance to come into contact with the golden profound energy within the pool, so on what basis did this new fellow think he could occupy the pool of golden profound energy as soon as he arrived here?

At this moment, Xiao Lang had calmed down. He seemed to have forgotten about the Soul Contract, and he gazed at the violet mink while he gulped down a mouthful of saliva, and then he said while ingratiating himself slightly. “Allow me to go in there. I sense that so long as I enter it, I’ll be able to enter the Spirit Rank in a short period of time!”

The violet mink shook its little head and stared at Xiao Lang with a hostile gaze. Moreover, faint violet light even flickered on its claws.

“Please let me go in there. Just for a short period of time....”

The violet mink still shook its head because that pool of profound energy belonged to it, and no one could get close to it!

Xiao Lang was slightly anxious. If it was any other King Rank Darkbeast that stood in his way, he would have definitely smashed his fist over. However, he didn’t dare do so against this little fellow who stood before him! He wasn’t stupid, so he naturally knew the status this little fellow had in the heart of that human called Yang Ye and these other King Rank Darkbeasts. If he dared to make a move against it, then the consequence would definitely be one where he was smashed into mush!

“I really....” Xiao Lang still intended to say something. However, at this moment, a strand of violet light suddenly appeared in front of him, and then the seven King Rank Darkbeasts around him roared furiously before they pounced at him!

In next to no time, numerous wails resounded from Yang Ye’s Vortex Dantian.

Xiao Lang’s strength was extremely formidable, and if it was a one on one battle, then none of these seven King Rank Darkbeasts would be a match for him. However, if all of them attacked jointly, then even Yang Ye could only flee. Not to mention that the violet mink was helping from the side....

15 minutes later, Xiao Lang appeared in front of Yang Ye. At this moment, he was in a slightly sorry state. His face was covered in bruises, and his clothes were in rags.

The corners of Xiao Lang’s mouth twitched as he gazed at Yang Ye, and then he said, “Human, I don’t know what that space of yours is, and I don’t want to know. All I want to know is that since I’ll be following by your side and helping you in battle, then can I utilize it to help improve my strength?”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Firstly, you are doing that because of the bet between us, so you still have to do it even if you receive no compensation, right? Moreover, it belongs to the little fellow. If you want to use it, sure. You just have to get its agreement, and I won’t have any objections at all!”

Actually, Yang Ye wanted to allow those other Darkbeasts to utilize the pool of golden profound energy to improve their strengths since a very long time ago. However, he’d abandoned this thought in the end. Why? Because his current strength was still too weak. Once those King Rank Darkbeasts advanced into the Spirit Rank, then they would become a group of Spirit Rank Darkbeasts! At that time, he and the little fellow would probably be unable to control them!

So, it wasn’t that he refused to allow those Darkbeasts to advance into the Spirit Rank, but he couldn’t. Even if he were to allow them to advance, then either he or the little fellow had to advance as well! Moreover, the violet mink seemed to understand this principle as well, so it had always seized possession of the pool of golden profound energy and prohibited the other Darkbeasts from entering it!
