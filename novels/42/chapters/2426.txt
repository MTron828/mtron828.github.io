Chapter 2427 – I Have a Huge Objection to That!

Not qualified!

As far as she was concerned, if someone from Eternal Border wanted to enter Eternal Kingdom, it was as difficult as ascending the heavens. At the very least, one had to be at the peak of the Five World Realm or even higher to be qualified!

But what ability did this sword cultivator possess?

Actually, she knew that some people returned to simplicity!

Some seemed ordinary, but they weren’t ordinary at all. Those people had returned to simplicity. They were simple yet unordinary, normal yet extraordinary.

However, she didn’t think anyone in Eternal Border could accomplish that to the point she couldn’t discern it!

It was absolutely impossible for such an expert to exist in Eternal Border!

The sword cultivator glanced at her and asked, “What do I need to be qualified?”

She grinned, “Defeat me and you’re barely qualified.”

As soon as she said that, a sword was against her throat.

Everyone here was stunned, including the woman. Her figure stiffened on the spot!

One swing of the sword!

She’d seen the attack, and it was a very ordinary attack, but she hadn’t been able to avoid it!

He glanced at her and said, “Don’t you know how weak you are?”

He lowered his sword and left.

They watched as he gradually vanished into the distance.

The woman’s face was extremely unsightly.

A long time passed before she closed her eyes, “Ask for a Five World Realm expert to get here immediately. Tell them if it’s allowed, it’s best to send an expert above the Limitbreaker Realm.”

She was truly quite afraid now.

Eternal Border wasn’t as simple as she’d thought!

…

Meanwhile, Yang Ye and Huang Ying stopped at the peak of a mountain. Huang Ying sat down cross-legged by the edge of it and looked ahead.

Yang Ye stood at the side while the old man remained not too far behind them.

Huang Ying pointed ahead, “Brother Yang, war will spread through this world soon, and then it will vanish from history.”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “What does that have to do with me?”

Huang Ying was stunned. He glanced at Yang Ye and chuckled, “You really aren’t ordinary! Then let’s speak about what’s related to you. For example, that little fellow in you! Brother Yang, do you think that you can keep her safe?”

Yang Ye replied, “I’ll do it even if I can’t!”

Huang Yin smiled, “According to my knowledge, the Eternal Kingdom has an Eternal Lord now, and that Eternal Lord has converged all the powers in Eternal Kingdom. Soon, the walls between Eternal Kingdom and Eternal Border will be broken, and you will realize that Four World and Five World Realm experts will be numerous like ants.”

Yang Ye remained silent.

He was very well aware that Huang Ying wasn’t trying to scare him. Once Eternal Border and the desolate race became serious, he wouldn’t be able to resist any of them.

A short while later, Yang Ye shook his head and smiled. When had he ever been in a good situation?

The stronger he got, the stronger his enemies were. His life had rarely been calm.

Huang Ying suddenly said, “Looks like you’re very well aware of the situation that you’re in.”

Yang Ye glanced at him, “Tell me why you’re here!”

Huang Ying smiled, “To work together.”

Work together!

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “How?”

Huang Ying smiled, “Brother Yang, the Sprite Progenitor isn’t as important to my desolate race as it is to Eternal Kingdom. My desolate race has merely come here because we don’t want the Sprite Progenitor to fall into the Eternal Kingdom’s hands. After all, we don’t want history to repeat itself. Of course, if we can obtain the Sprite Progenitor, then it’s even better. However, even if we can’t obtain it, we can accept any outcome where the Sprite Progenitor doesn’t fall into Eternal Kingdom’s possession!”

He gazed into the distance and continued, “So, that’s why we were given the order to either get it or kill it.”

Yang Ye said, “Tell me about our cooperation!”

Huang Ying smiled, “It’s very simple. Help me become the Crown Prince of the desolate race. So long as I succeed, I’ll make the desolate race give up on the Sprite Progenitor. Of course, the precondition is that you can’t allow that little fellow to help Eternal Kingdom. Besides that, if I’m the Crown Prince, I won’t let the desolate race harm any Sprites of Eternal Kingdom in the future!”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “According to my knowledge, the desolate race has a patriarch!”

Huang Ying smiled, “The Crown Prince is the next patriarch and possesses a very, very great level of authority! Moreover, that patriarch of ours will only show himself when necessary. As far as he’s concerned, Eternal Kingdom and everything else are beneath him. Otherwise, if he came from the Sprite Progenitor now, do you think anyone could stop him?”

Yang Ye remained silent.

Huang Ying chuckled, “His gaze has gone beyond Eternal Kingdom a long time ago. After the battle all those years ago, he has never managed anything anymore. So, the Crown Prince has a huge amount of authority.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “What do you need to become the Crown Prince?”

Huang Ying stood up and gazed into the distance, “Only three people have the right to vie for the position of Crown Prince. My eldest brother, Huang Ye, and I. The condition given to us was that whoever gets the Sprite Progenitor becomes the Crown Prince. However, so long as my eldest brother and Huang Ye lose, I’ll be the Crown Prince even if I don’t have the Sprite Progenitor.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Moreover, if you take my side, then to a certain extent, the Sprite Progenitor would be on my side. So, if you agree to take my side and I get back safely, then I would have won.”

Yang Ye asked, “Is it that simple?”

“Simple?” Huang Ying shook his head and smiled, “Brother Yang, because our patriarch has been in closed door cultivation, many smaller groups have formed. For example, some support me, some support my eldest brother, and some support Huang Ye. That’s why the patriarch stepped forward and said the Crown Prince would be the person who brought back the Sprite Progenitor.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “The weight of those words is extremely great. So long as I return home and you take my side, then I’ll be the Crown Prince. At that time, my eldest brother and Huang Ye will have no choice but to obey me. Otherwise, I can end their lives with a single command.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “In other words, once I take your side, it’s impossible for you to return safely, right?”

Huang Ying nodded, “They will attack madly. Moreover, the resources available to my eldest brother and Huang Ye are extremely terrifying.”

He walked over to Yang Ye and continued, “Brother Yang, have you decided?”

Yang Ye thought for a long time and nodded, “Alright, I’ll do it!”

Huang Yin grinned, and then he raised his palm in Yang Ye’s direction.

Yang Ye stretched out his hand as well.

They struck their palms together to form their alliance!

As far as Yang Ye was concerned, there was no disadvantage. While helping Huang Ying meant he would have to face Huang Tianxing, Huang Ye, and the forces that stood behind them. But if he didn’t help, he would still have to face them. Moreover, he would have to face Huang Ying too. Besides that, he would have to face the experts of Eternal Kingdom and Eternal Border.

Choosing to work together with Huang Ying was equivalent to dragging Huang Ying into all of it. Simply speaking, they would have to face everything together!

That was naturally a good thing for him!

Huang Ying smiled, “Then I’ll be troubling you with sending me home!”

Yang Ye glanced at the old man behind them and said, “I’m sure you have a backup plan, right?”

Huang Ying nodded, “Of course. However, my eldest brother and Huang Ye have one too. Once you take my side, it’s very likely that they will join forces. So, you have to be mentally prepared for it.”

Yang Ye didn’t say anything. He just withdrew the Myriad World Diagram.

Huang Ying’s eyes lit up when he saw it, “Is that a Myriad World Diagram?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Huang Ying nodded, “I didn’t expect you to have a treasure like that!”

Yang Ye glanced at it, and it didn’t take long for him to see Desolate World to the right.

Yang Ye gazed at Huang Ying, “We can go now!”

Huang Ying shook his head, “Brother Yang, you can try it for yourself!”

Yang Ye glanced at Huang Ying and placed his hand on the Desolate World. As soon as he did that, Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically, and he pulled his hand back.

A wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of Yang Ye’s mouth.

Yang Ye gazed at Huang Ying, and the latter spoke solemnly, “As expected!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What do you mean?”

Huang Ying spoke solemnly, “Many years ago, an old man came to Desolate World and requested to put it on the Myriad World Diagram. We refused, but for some reason, our patriarch personally agreed to it. However, he had a request, and it was that only the old man could use the Myriad World Diagram to enter Desolate World. So, it can be considered to be the old man’s personal travel pass!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “So, we can’t teleport there?”

Huang Ying nodded.

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time and glanced at the surroundings, “Then let’s go!”

Huang Ying smiled, “Alright!”

The three of them immediately vanished on the spot.

The Desolate World!

Yang Ye and Huang Ying’s alliance was quickly known by everyone, and they hadn’t tried to keep it concealed either. Because everyone in Eternal Border had their eyes on Yang Ye, so they knew everything he did.

At a certain point in space, Huang Tianxing suddenly stopped. He closed his eyes slowly, and a long time passed before he suddenly said, “kill!”

At a boundless mountain range, Huang Ye suddenly stopped on the spot for a while. Suddenly, he started laughing, “Ninth Brother! Oh! Ninth Brother! You’re truly brave. How could Eldest Brother and I not have thought of that? We thought of it, but we didn’t dare to do it! Yet you actually did so! Since you’ve done it, let me see how strong you truly are!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and vanished into the sky with his group.

Myriad World Mountain.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

As soon as Yang Ye’s group entered Myriad World Mountain, a middle aged man in a white robe suddenly appeared in front of them.

The middle aged man glanced at them and smiled, “I’ve been waiting for you.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “I’m Xiao Shenwu. You may have heard of me. I want to borrow that Sprite Progenitor of yours. You don’t have any objections to that, right?”

Yang Ye looked him in the eyes and said, “Firstly, I’ve never heard of you. Secondly, I have a huge objection to that!”
