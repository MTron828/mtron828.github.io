Chapter 1870 – His Sword Has Entered The Dao!

The Unfettered One’s broken sword? Yang Ye was quite stunned.

Who was the Unfettered One? All along the way, he’d always been an invincible existence! Yet now, his sword was actually broken here!

Who could break his sword? T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

At this moment, Yang Ye had an extremely solemn expression on his face. Because no matter who did it, it showed how terrifying that person was.

Suddenly, the Asura Exalt asked, “What’s wrong?”

Yang Ye took a deep and long glance at the broken sword, and then he shook his head, “It’s nothing.”

The Asura Exalt glanced at Yang Ye and pointed at the passageway, “There’s a barrier and formation in this passageway. I tried to enter by force, but I was stopped by them. Even I can’t break through that formation and barrier.”

Yang Ye glanced at the passageway and said, “I’ll help you break it open, and the rest will be up to you.”

The Asura Exalt asked, “Are you really not going to head in and have a look?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I trust my instinct! But don’t worry, I won’t expose the existence of this place to anyone else.”

The Asura Exalt nodded, “Even though you’re a little shameless sometimes, I can trust those words!”

Yang Ye smiled, and he didn’t speak further. He walked over to the passageway, and then numerous rays of blue light appeared. They were like a screen that obstructed his path, causing him to be unable to move forward!

Yang Ye pressed his hand against the blue light and started to exert strength. However, the blue light didn’t even ripple, no matter how much strength he used.

“It won’t work!” The Asura Exalt said, “If you want to break it by force, you’ll probably need strength comparable to the three Ancient Cultivators.”

Yang Ye nodded. He didn’t say anything. He just raised his sword and pressed it against the barrier. As soon as he did that, the blue light trembled.

The Asura Exalt became excited when he witnessed this scene.

It’s working!

Yang Ye didn’t say anything. He just exerted strength, and it didn’t take long for the blue light to turn ethereal.

Based on Yang Ye’s inference, if the sword hadn’t been unsealed, it would be quite difficult for him to break open the barrier. Yet now, it was unsealed, so breaking the barrier was absolutely easy!

Around 15 minutes later, the blue light had completely vanished.

Once it was done, Yang Ye immediately moved backwards, and then he gazed at the Asura Exalt, “It’s done!”

The Asura Exalt pointed at the door and said, “Perhaps entering through there will change your life. Are you sure you don’t want to go in?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Perhaps I won’t be able to come out again!”

The Asura Exalt didn’t say anything, but he was slightly disappointed. He was disappointed in Yang Ye. Because as far as he was concerned, they were men, so they should explore bravely and take risks. Opportunities wouldn’t just come to a person, a person had to fight for them.

But Yang Ye was afraid!

Afraid!

Fear was a huge taboo for cultivators!

The Asura Exalt didn’t say anything, and he just walked towards the door. It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to watch him open the door and walk in. As soon as the door was opened, the tiny vortex within Yang Ye started to spin again!

A warning!

Yang Ye didn’t stay. He turned around and left swiftly.

Leave!

Immediately!

That was what Yang Ye thought right now. Actually, he really wanted to know what was behind the door. However, he was very well aware that if he did go in, he probably wouldn’t make it out.

“No!” Suddenly, a voice resounded from behind him.

Yang Ye’s heart shook because it belonged to the Asura Exalt!

Run!

Yang Ye sped up. However, he suddenly noticed that he remained on the spot, no matter how he increased his speed!

I’m finished!

That was what appeared in Yang Ye’s mind. Meanwhile, he noticed that his body suddenly started to move backwards at an increasing pace, and he could only watch as that happened.

Yang Ye would naturally not just sit there and wait for death to arrive. He immediately issued a command in his heart, and his sword shook violently. An instant later, a ray of golden sword energy flashed.

Hiss!

It sounded like something here was sliced open!

“Eh? What’s that kid’s sword doing with you?” Suddenly, a voice resounded from behind Yang Ye, and then a wave of powerful suction force sucked Yang Ye behind the door.

An instant later, the scene before Yang Ye had changed.

Behind the door was a palace that was neither big nor small. It was a very simple place. There was a single chair at the end of the hall, and a person was seated on it. It was the Asura Exalt. However, he wasn’t the same Asura Exalt anymore.

Yang Ye calmed himself and glanced at the person, “May I know who you are?”

That person shook his head, “I asked you a question first!”

Yang Ye replied, “The Sovereign of Man’s sword fell here, and I just happened to get it.”

The man glanced at the sword in Yang Ye’s grasp and waved his hand. In an instant, it flew over to him. The holy sword trembled violently and wanted to struggle free from him, but it was in vain!

He’s strong! Yang Ye’s face grew even more solemn. He didn’t know which ancient existence was before him, but the man’s strength far surpassed a Heavenly Exalt. Perhaps only the ancient cultivators could fight him!

I wonder if Brother Monkey can fight this person!

Yes, the hair the monkey had given him was his final trump card!

The person sized up the sword, and then he flicked it back to Yang Ye. After that, he said, “I sense the aura of a devil cultivator coming from you. Are you a devil cultivator?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The man asked, “You’re human, so why engage in devil cultivation?”

Yang Ye replied with a question, “Why not?”

The man said, “You’re a sword cultivator, so you belong to the righteous faction. So, why would you choose to use a devil cultivation technique?”

Yang Ye looked the man in the eyes, “Senior, what is righteous? What is evil?”

The man clearly hadn’t expected Yang Ye to ask this question, and he was stunned.

Yang Ye stretched out his hand and clenched his fist, “There is no such thing. The only thing that exists is strength. The strong are righteous, and the weak are evil. History has always been written by the victor!”

A strange smile appeared on the man’s face, “Interesting, interesting… But aren’t you afraid that those so-called righteous people will hunt you?”

Yang Ye replied with a question, “If I’m strong enough, would anyone dare to try and kill me? If I’m weak, everyone would dare to try and kill me! In the end, it’s still a matter of strength. Moreover, I think that regardless of whether a person is a devil cultivator, evil cultivator, or sword cultivator, all of it actually depends on the heart!”

“The heart?” The man smiled, “Come, tell me about it!”

Yang Ye glanced at the man and heaved a sigh of relief. Obviously, he’d made the right gamble. The person before him wasn’t a good person.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and continued, “If someone kills another, should the person who sold the weapon be blamed for it? Or should the weapon be blamed? It’s the heart. If the heart is kind, a person wouldn’t do evil even when holding the evilest weapon in the world; but if a heart is evil, then even the kindest weapon would be used for evil!”

“Hahaha!” Suddenly, the man started roaring with laughter. He laughed for a while before he gazed at Yang Ye, “Interesting, you’re truly quite interesting, Kid. However, is this truly what you think, or are you telling me that because you think it’s what I want to hear?”

His smile became quite cold at this point.

Boom!

Suddenly, a strand of intent swept out from Yang Ye.

Slaughter intent!

Enlightened Rank slaughter intent!

Yang Ye looked the man in the eyes, “Senior, what do you think?”

“Enlightened Rank slaughter intent!” The man nodded slightly, “Looks like you really aren’t a good person!”

Yang Ye glanced at the man and asked, “May I know who you are?”

The man gazed at Yang Ye, “After this world was born, many cultivators appeared. They engaged in cultivation of the Dao, spirit, evil, demon, and devil. They are the earliest group of cultivators, and they are called the progenitors. For example, the Dao Progenitor, the Spirit Progenitor, the Evil Progenitor… I’m the Devil Progenitor!”

The Devil Progenitor! Yang Ye’s eyes couldn’t help but twitch. He’s an almighty figure!

Meanwhile, the man said, “Regardless of whether it’s the Dao Progenitor, the Evil Progenitor, or the Devil Progenitor, there’s actually more than one. After all, there were countless geniuses at that time, and as all of them rose to prominence, they created cultivation techniques and created new systems of cultivation…”

His gaze suddenly became distant, and he seemed to be recalling the past.

Yang Ye glanced at the man and didn’t disturb him.

Meanwhile, the Devil Progenitor’s eyes suddenly had a vicious glow in them, “We used to live in harmony, but in the end, some insisted on dividing us as righteous and evil. Since then, the world ceased to be at peace.”

Yang Ye said, “There’s always fighting where there are people.”

The Devil Progenitor nodded slightly, “You’re right. Kid, I planned to kill you, but I like you, and you’re a successor of my Devil Path. So, you can leave.”

Yang Ye cupped his fists and walked away. He suddenly stopped when he arrived at the exit, and then he turned to look at the Devil Progenitor, “Senior, why’s there a broken sword outside?”

Yang Ye noticed that the Devil Progenitor’s expression changed slightly when he asked this question.

Quite some time passed before the Devil Progenitor closed his eyes, “It was given up.”

Yang Ye asked, “What do you mean?”

“The highest level of an emotionless path of the sword. Giving up everything…” He opened his eyes and looked at Yang Ye, “He gave up the sword he loved the most. So, his sword entered the Dao!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
