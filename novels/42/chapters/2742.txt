Chapter 2743 – The World is too Small!

Burial!

Erya ignored the sword and was about to charge at the pitch black hand. However, Yang Ye suddenly appeared before her.

Yang Ye stopped Erya!

She gazed at him with slight displeasure, and there was a vicious glow in her eyes.

Yang Ye rubbed her horns gently and spoke softly, “Calm down.”

Snowy appeared before Erya, touched her horns, and swiftly waved her paws.

A short while later, Erya gradually calmed down.

Yang Ye turned around. The pitch black hand was still there, and the sword, Burial, was in its grasp.

Yang Ye glanced at the sword and had quite a solemn expression on his face.

When the sword appeared, he’d immediately given up on chasing after Zuo Mu. It was because he’d sensed danger!

Extreme danger!

So, he’d rushed over to stop Erya.

Erya’s body was very strong, but she wasn’t at her prime. Her body wasn’t unmatched yet. Moreover, she didn’t have her past memories, so she didn’t have an accurate idea of danger, just like Snowy. So, it was very, very easy for someone to annihilate her at a time like this.

Yang Ye switched the Sword Supreme for Heaven Executor, and he sheathed it, “Snowy, go inside. Erya, watch those fellows around us. Don’t let them join the battle.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he walked toward the pitch black hand.

Snowy ran off into the Primordial Pagoda. Erya, on the other hand, gazed coldly at Emperor Li and the others. She clenched her fists and was ready to attack at any moment.

A short while later, Yang Ye stopped, and he was just around 30m away from the black hand.

They were extremely close to each other!

At this moment, he could sense the sword clearly.

He couldn’t sense the black hand. It felt very, very strange to him, and he couldn’t put a finger on the exact feeling it gave him. As for the sword, it was the source of the danger he sensed!

Suddenly, the hand moved.

A black ray of sword energy flashed.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he stomped his right foot down and swung his sword!

Bang!

The ground instantly collapsed!

Explosive Heavenrend!

Yang Ye’s sword slashed down upon the black sword energy.

A moment of silence ensued…

Bang!

Countless watched with astonishment as Yang Ye was blasted over 1km away. As soon as he stopped himself, Heaven Executor shattered into pieces that fell to the ground!

Heaven Executor had been destroyed!

Everyone here was stunned by this!

After all, it was Heaven Executor!

One of the strongest swords in the world!

Yang Ye was stunned while still holding onto the hilt of Heaven Executor.

It shattered just like that?

Yang Ye looked up at the black hand, and his eyes narrowed slightly while a solemn expression appeared in them.

He’d experienced how terrifying Heaven Executor was. Even Erya’s current horns couldn’t destroy it, but at this moment, it had been destroyed by that sword!

Burial?

Was it a sword made to counter Destiny’s swords?

Meanwhile, Snowy appeared.

She glanced at Burial, and her eyes lit up. She was about to trick it into leaving with her when the black hand suddenly swung an angled slash at them from afar!

Hiss!

A black ray of sword energy shot at Yang Ye and Snowy!

Yang Ye tossed Snowy back into the Primordial Pagoda and crossed his arms. A pair of bracers had appeared on his arms!

Bang!

A wave of powerful energy rippled out from the bracers, causing space to instantly collapse!

Heavenshield!

A moment later, the sword energy struck Heavenshield!

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted over 3km away, and a long and deep gully had been created on the ground before him.

Yang Ye’s arms were trembling violently, and there was a deep mark on Heavenshield. Besides that, Yang Ye’s blood was surging within him, and then strands of Bloodline Energy surged incessantly into Heavenshield.

Yang Ye lowered his arms and was extremely shocked. If Snowy hadn’t enhanced Heavenshield with Erya’s scales, just that attack may have destroyed Heavenshield!

What a powerful sword!

But just a moment later, the mark on Heavenshield started gradually healing.

However, it was healing with his blood. Moreover, as more and more of his blood flowed into it, the aura Heavenshield emanated grew stronger and stronger!

Yang Ye was shocked by this.

What the heck?

The more blood it gets, the stronger it becomes?

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Meanwhile, Erya appeared by his side.

Yang Ye pulled her behind him, and then walked toward the black hand. Faint blood red flames had appeared on his arms.

It was his blood burning!

At this moment, Yang Ye’s arms felt like they were full of energy!

Boundless energy!

However, a sword howl suddenly resounded from the distant sky, and then an old man appeared on the other side of the city walls!

It was Jian Wudi, and there was a beautiful woman by his side. Qing Xuan.

Jian Wudi glanced at the black sword, and there was a solemn expression in his eyes.

Meanwhile, Sky Saber was being completely suppressed in his battle against An Nanjing, and his body was covered in numerous cracks.

Based on the situation of their battle, if it wasn’t for the black hand, Yang Ye’s side would have completely suppressed the End World’s forces.

Of course, now that the black hand and sword were here, everything was unknown!

However, Yang Ye’s side wasn’t weak either!

Especially when Erya could still fight! She was truly capable of fighting two experts on her own!

Yang Ye stretched out his arms and walked toward the black hand, and a sword chest soundlessly appeared on his back.

Yang Ye smiled fiercely, “Bring it!”

As soon as he said that, he was about to attack when the black hand and sword gradually turned ethereal!

On the city walls, Emperor Li suddenly chuckled, “Yang Ye, we’ll decide everything in two weeks. So, hurry up and go get Destiny’s help. Otherwise, you’ll die a terrible death. Haha!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished from the city walls.

Erya was about to pursue him but Yang Ye stopped her.

Yang Ye didn’t pursue them. It was pointless while the black hand was there.

Yang Ye gazed at Jian Wudi, “Martial Ancestor!”

Jian Wudi nodded slightly, “Do you have more space? Your Aunt Qing Xuan and I are looking for a place to stay!”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he hurriedly smiled, “Yes, of course.”

It was a very good thing. Jian Wudi and Qing Xuan’s presence represented that his side’s strength would rise by a few levels!

Jian Wudi was an existence capable of fighting Emperor Li on his own!

Now that the two of them had joined his side, his side had a better chance against the End World!

So, Yang Ye really welcomed them!

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “Come on, we have things to discuss!”

Once he finished speaking, he led them toward the city center.

...

At an unknown expanse of space, a woman sat before a stone table. On the table was a Go board, and by the board was a sword placed vertically there!

Justice!

It was the strongest form of Destiny.

She was still wearing a dark green dress, and her beautiful hair was hanging behind her.

She raised a white piece and placed it down. A few breaths of time later, a black piece descended.

She shook her head and smiled, “After so many years, your skill hasn’t improved at all.”

She put down another piece as she spoke.

At this instant, the surroundings fell silent.

A long time passed before she smiled, “Would you like to admit defeat?”

A moment of silence ensued, and then the black pieces vanished from the board.

The woman grinned, “Interesting!”

As she spoke, she walked to a withered tree to the side, and by the trees was a bottomless expanse of clouds.

She looked down calmly with a slight grin on her face.

A short while later, she suddenly looked to the side, “You’ve been in hiding for so many years. What’s the point of that?”

A short while later, a voice resounded, “It’s better than death, isn’t it?”

She smiled, “That’s true. A good death is better than a meaningless existence!”

As she spoke, she looked down in a different direction, and her gaze seemed to be able to scan the entire Three Dimensional Universe.

A short while later, the voice resounded again, “According to my knowledge, the people of your world are targeting you. Aren’t you going to deal with them?”

She chuckled, “Let them do as they please. Otherwise, it would be too boring. I just hope they don’t disappoint me too much.”

The voice replied, “Conceit may come with a price!”

She looked into the distance, “I hope they really do have some ability. Unfortunately…”

She shook her head and returned to sit before the table, “If I’m being honest, I’m not looking down on them, but they are just too weak. Oh, not really. There are some with a little strength.”

The voice fell silent.

A short while later, the voice spoke solemnly, “What are you trying to do?”

The woman chuckled, “I just want to kill you right now.”

The voice replied, “Come over here then! Based on your strength, I wouldn’t be able to stop you if you did.”

The woman grinned.

The voice chuckled, “You dare not.”

She shook her head, “Let me correct you, I don’t want to.”

The voice replied solemnly, “You’re not protecting the Three Dimensional Universe, you’re definitely not! What the heck do you want?”

She raised a piece and put it down, and then she chuckled, “The world is too small for me.”

She looked into the distance and said, “Clean your throat for me.”

A moment of silence ensued, and then a voice resounded, “I’m ready whenever you are.”

She chuckled and looked down. Her gaze passed through countless layers of space. In the end, it descended upon a sword cultivator.

The sword cultivator seemed to sense her gaze and suddenly looked up.

She grinned, and then made a throat-cutting gesture.
