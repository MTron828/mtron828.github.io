Bang!

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye slammed his left fist against her stomach. A mouthful of blood instantly sprayed from her while her figure curved into the shape of a fully drawn bow.

Yang Ye held her by the throat and lifted her up before taking a glance at her. She seemed very young and just a little over 20. Her jet black brows were curved like a crescent, her eyes like stars, and her features exquisite. Besides that, her skin was crystalline and translucent like the most flawless snow on a mountain. Especially her small lips, they seemed like a cherry that had just matured, charming and tender. It made others feel the urge to take them in their mouth and taste them gently.

Yang Ye’s gaze moved lower. Beneath her smooth white neck was a pair of towering peaks. Especially when she was wearing a tight dress. It made her peaks seem exceptionally huge and seemed as if they were about to break free of her clothes.

Beautiful, huge, and strong!

That was what Yang Ye thought of her!

The corners of her mouth curled up slightly when she noticed Yang Ye’s gaze, “What? You intend to use force?”

Slap!

Yang Ye raised his hand and slapped her on the right cheek. He clearly hadn’t held back because her face had instantly turned completely red like a fiery cloud.

Her face became gloomy, and she revealed undisguised killing intent at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at her and said, “Woman, my patience is limited. Tell me what I want to know. and I’ll give you a swift death. Otherwise, the fate that awaits you won’t be that simple.”

He’d thought of refining her into a Sword Servant, but her memories might vanish once he did that. It wasn’t a possibility, and it was a definite fact. If her cultivation was low, then he was confident in his ability to maintain her memories, but he had no confidence in being able to retain the memories of an expert like her.

The facts from his previous refinements proved that when experts at the Saint Realm and above were refined into Sword Servants, their memories would practically cease to exist. So, he had no choice but to keep her alive. Because he knew nothing about the forces of the Veiled Region. How many experts they had or how many forces they had; he knew nothing about that. However, they practically knew everything about him. Under such circumstances, it was definitely disadvantageous for him to collide with them!

A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corner of her mouth when she heard Yang Ye, “I’ll die anyway, so why would I tell you anything? Feel free to use any methods you have. Just see if I even frown.”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a long time before he suddenly smiled, “Even though I’ve restrained you and you can’t resist me, you still have the ability to take your own life. Yet you still haven’t. Obviously, you want to live. Right?”

Many people in the world weren’t afraid of death, but it depended on the circumstances. Simply speaking, it was whether it was worth it. Obviously, she didn’t feel dying now was worth it. It really wasn’t. Because there was no deep-rooted enmity between her and Yang Ye.

She said, “You won’t let me live, right?”

Yang Ye replied, “Why wouldn’t I? So long as it’s beneficial to me, I wouldn’t let you die even if you wanted to. So, you can tell me what benefits I gain from allowing you to live, and I’ll let you live if it’s satisfactory. Right, I hope you realize the situation that you’re in. I don’t like to waste my breath on people who aren’t smart.”

She looked him in the eyes, “I don’t trust you!”

Yang Ye shrugged, “Then take your own life right now. I will definitely not stop you!”

She didn’t commit suicide and spoke instead, “Tell me what you want.”

“That works!” Yang Ye nodded, “You can live if you want. You must surrender and join my Sword Alliance....”

“No!” She suddenly interrupted him, “Only death will await me if I join the Sword Alliance!”

“If you refuse, then you’ll die right now!” Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “You’ll have a chance to live if you join, and I’ll kill you right now if you refuse.”

She gazed at him for a long time before she said, “What other conditions?”

Yang Ye said, “Actually, I don’t have many. So long as you join my Sword Alliance and obey my orders, then we’ll be on the same side. At that time, I believe that you’ll sincerely assist me in dealing with the Veiled Region, right?”

She remained silent for a short while before she spoke, “I’m willing to join, so can you release me now?”

Yang Ye suddenly pinched her chin and said, “Do you think I’m a fool?”

She asked, “What are you trying to say?”

Yang Ye laughed coldly, “If I release you now, you’d turn around and flee right away. Then how would I go looking for you? Or perhaps you’d launch a lethal strike against me at the critical moment in battle. Wouldn’t I die a miserable death like that?”

She asked, “Then what do you want?”

Yang Ye replied, “I don’t trust you. So even if you intend to join the Sword Alliance and obey my orders, you must be under my control. Understand?”

Her expression changed, “You want to take control of my soul!”

“Exactly!” Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Give me a part of it, and I’ll trust you. Otherwise, take your own life or die by my hands. In any case, I can still refine you into a puppet once you’re dead.”

She fell silent for a long time before she shook her head and said, “If I give you a part of my soul and let you control me, then I’ll be under your control forever. That’s worse than death for me.”

“10 years!” Yang Ye continued, “I don’t need you for eternity, I just need you for 10 years. I’ll return your soul after that period. Because I believe that I wouldn’t need any help in 10 years from now, or I should say that I wouldn’t need your help.”

She looked up at Yang Ye. If it was anyone else, she would definitely laugh with ridicule. But if Yang Ye said it, she was utterly incapable of refuting it. Because if Yang Ye didn’t die, then he would be an Emperor or even a Voider in 10 years. At that time, he would really have no use for her. She would rather die than be controlled forever, but if it was just 10 years....

After a short moment of silence, she said, “How can I trust you?”

Yang Ye suddenly moved close to her and looked her in the eyes, “You should realize what sort of situation you’re in right now. I’m not begging you, and it’s you who should be begging me. Besides that, I don’t have much time, and I really don’t want to waste it here. Understand?”

After a moment of silence, she took a deep breath, and it didn’t take long for her brows to knit together. After that, 2 strands of her soul emerged from within her before floating over to Yang Ye. Once that happened, her face instantly turned ghastly pale, and she seemed quite weak.

Yang Ye glanced at her and released his grip on her throat. After that, he took those strands of her soul into his body. So long as they were within him, it would be impossible for her to retrieve them unless he returned them willingly.

Once he was done, Yang Ye withdrew some violet crystals and started absorbing them. Meanwhile, he glanced at her and said, “I presume you know what I want to know.”

She fell silent for a while before she spoke, “Because you killed the experts of the Yuan Clan and Ye Clan, the Veiled Region has realized how terrifying you are and how great your potential is. So, it hasn’t just sent more experts, it even sent Old Man Yuan.”

Yang Ye frowned, “Old Man Yuan?”

She nodded, “He’s a living fossil that attained the Voider Realm a very long time ago. His strength can be considered to be something that ordinary Voiders can’t resist at all.”

Yang Ye fell silent. He knew that Old Man Yuan should be on par with the Ten Thousand Legged Centipede. He was probably one of those abnormal Voiders. Such an expert was difficult to deal with indeed. Even though he’d killed a few Voiders now, he was still not confident in his ability to fight an expert, like the Ten Thousand Legged Centipede, on his own.

After staying silent for a while, he gazed at her and said, “What else?”

She hesitated for a moment. Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “I presume you understand that those strands of your soul will be at risk if anything happens to me. A person lacking a part of the soul is equivalent to becoming innately lacking. At that time, I believe that you’ll never have a chance to advance to a higher realm of cultivation. Right?”

She glanced at him and said, “Besides Old Man Yuan, there’s another person you have to watch out for. He’s from the Slayer Pavilion, and his strength is greater than mine.”

“The Slayer Pavilion?” Yang Ye frowned, “What sort of existence is that in the Veiled Region?”

“An organization of assassins. Even the Yuan Clan wouldn’t rashly offend it!” She continued, “We have countless assassins, and there are 3 at the Voider Realm. Besides me, there’s one more and the pavilion master. Both their strengths are greater than mine. I just don’t know which one of them is coming. If it’s the pavilion master....”

Yang Ye asked, “What would happen?”

She spoke solemnly, “If the pavilion master acts himself, then you’ll be in huge trouble. Because the pavilion master is a Voider who had been renowned for very long, and he’s an assassin as well. It can be said that there’s practically no one throughout the Veiled Region who’s willing to be targeted by him.”

Yang Ye couldn’t help but speak angrily, “I don’t think there’s any enmity between me and your Slayer Pavilion, right?”

She shook her head, “There is no enmity between us. The reason we’ve acted against you is because the Yuan Clan joined forces with some clans and sects to pay for us to target you. Our mission is to claim lives for those who pay. I’ve failed, so the pavilion will naturally send someone stronger.”

“I can pay!” Yang Ye hurriedly said, “I have a bunch of violet crystals, so how about you help me annihilate the Yuan Clan?” He’d killed 2 Voiders earlier, and Snowy had absorbed the spirit energy within them before providing him with another 230,000 violet crystals! A single Voider was worth over 100,000 violent crystals. Coupled with the violet crystals he already had, he had around 260,000 now!

She glanced at him and said, “We have principles.”

“Principles?” Yang Ye spoke coldly, “I have principles too. I don’t offend unless offended, but once someone does offend me, I’ll definitely kill that person.”

She remained silent.

Yang Ye was about to speak when she suddenly frowned, “Someone is coming. 2...3... 4... 7....”

When she spoke up to this point, she gazed at Yang Ye and said, “A total of 7 Voiders. You should just surrender!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
