Chapter 2805 – Fate!

Fuck off from the Three Dimensional Universe!

Yang Ye stood there in the sky with his sword in hand, and his voice rumbled like a thunderclap through the sky.

The world suddenly fell silent.

Extremely silent!

All the experts of the Four Dimensional Universe gazed at Yang Ye!

Return?

That was definitely impossible because the Four Dimensional Universe wasn’t suitable for living anymore. However, if they refused, they would have to face Yang Ye.

Even Monarch Yan was no match for Yang Ye, so how would they fight him?

Yang Ye’s words put them all between a rock and a hard place!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly.

Wait!

He was waiting for their response. While he didn’t hold much hope toward it, that wasn’t very important. The important thing was that he needed time to recuperate.

The fierce battles he’d experienced throughout this time, and especially the battle against the formation had truly exhausted too much of his strength.

He was giving them a chance and giving himself some time!

The experts of the Four Dimensional Universe gazed at Monarch Yan who was behind the formation right now.

Fight or retreat, it was all up to him!

Monarch Yan closed his eyes, and his body gradually started to form once more!

A destroyed body wasn’t a huge issue to experts at his level because it was very easy to restore.

While Monarch Yan restored his body, Yang Ye didn’t attack. As far as he was concerned, if he could do it once, he could do it twice.

A short while later, Monarch Yan looked up at Yang Ye, “If we do not annihilate the Three Dimensional Universe, that woman will annihilate us instead. We have no choice!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I see, it’s just a matter of crushing the weaker one.”

His sword slashed forward from his waist.

Monarch Yan’s expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly activated the formation. The huge barrier of light shook violently, and then a beam of light shot forward at Yang Ye’s sword.

The sword was forced to a stop!

However, Yang Ye suddenly shot downward!

Monarch Yan’s expression changed drastically at the sight of this, “Yang Ye! Don’t you dare!”

Monarch Yan charged after Yang Ye.

Hiss!

Meanwhile, a shrill cry resounded from below, and the head of a huge demon beast shot up into the air while accompanied by a fountain of blood. At the same time, another head shot up right behind it…

Instant kills!

These peak Destiny Realm experts from the Four Dimensional Universe were actually incapable of fighting back against Yang Ye!

The Ordinary Sword!

Once he attained the Ordinary Sword, he wasn’t someone Destiny Realm experts could resist anymore.

Not to mention that he’d attained the Destiny Transcendence Realm now, so his cultivation suppressed them too.

Yang Ye was like a wolf attacking a flock of sheep, and they were practically incapable of resisting him!

In an instant, Yang Ye had killed four experts from the Four Dimensional Universe, but when he was about to attack and kill the fifth, Monarch Yan shot over with a strand of black energy!

Yang Ye still didn’t dare to act carelessly against the black energy, so he retreated around 3m before stretching out his right hand. A strand of blood floated out from his palm, and then it condensed into a sword!

The Sword Precursor!

The Sword Precursor’s main body wasn’t just a sword anymore, it was his blood. So, in order to truly destroy it, the only choice was to kill Yang Ye!

Yang Ye tapped his foot down and leaped up like a fish leaping out of water, and a ray of sword energy soundless descended.

Hiss!

The black energy was instantly sliced into two, and then Yang Ye appeared before Monarch Yan and stabbed at the latter.

Monarch Yan’s expression changed drastically, and he took the black lotus in both hands as he raised it against Yang Ye’s sword.

Bang!

The black lotus shook violently, and then Monarch Yan was blasted away.

Yang Ye didn’t chase after Monarch Yan. He just waved his sword swiftly, and rays of sword energy ceaselessly struck the black lotus.

Monarch Yan wasn’t terrifying to him right now, it was the black lotus that was terrifying. It could even corrode his sword intent, and its corrosion didn’t even stop there, even his Sword Domain wasn’t able to endure the black energy that came from the black lotus!

Yang Ye’s sword energy started to madly damage the black lotus. As swing after swing descended, the black lotus gradually started to turn ethereal!

Monarch Yan’s face turned absolutely unsightly from the sight of this. He was about to attack when Yang Ye suddenly looked up and swung his sword.

It wasn’t aimed at the black lotus but Monarch Yan instead!

A ray of sword energy tore through space, causing Monarch Yan’s expression to change drastically. He didn’t dare to go head-on against this attack and just shot backward instead!

He’d been scared away with just a swing of the sword!

Yang Ye didn’t try to chase after Monarch Yan, and he just gazed at the black lotus before him. He was about to attack again when Snowy suddenly appeared before him. Snowy pointed at the black lotus and pointed at herself. She was telling him to leave it to her!Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Yang Ye frowned slightly. He didn’t really want to because the black lotus was too terrifying! Even though it had been damaged by his attacks, it had only been damaged because Monarch Yan wasn’t in control of it right now! Moreover, even then, he didn’t dare to get close to it.

Snowy pointed at herself and cracked a smile to say that she could get it done!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and spoke softly, “Be careful!”

Snowy nodded, and then she gazed at the black lotus that was covered by countless strands of Yang Ye’s sword energy. She waved her paw lightly, and then countless strands of spirit energy immediately converged around the black lotus.

Sprite devouring!

One of Snowy’s most lethal moves was the ability to devour sprites. The black lotus was an evil treasure, and it could be described as a counter to Snowy. If it were in the past, it would have succeeded because Snowy still hadn’t recovered to her prime.

Yet now, the black lotus had been damaged by Yang Ye, so Snowy was stronger than it now!

The black lotus suddenly shook violently and wanted to flee, but besides Snowy’s spirit energy, Yang Ye’s sword energy was all around it too. Just like that, the black lotus grew increasingly ethereal.

Suddenly, Snowy stopped, and then she grabbed the black lotus in her arms!

Yang Ye’s countenance turned pale from fright. Meanwhile, Snowy cracked a smile at him, and the black lotus remained very calm in her arms.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief from the sight of this.

Obviously, Snowy had subdued the black lotus.

Snowy flew over to Yang Ye, patted the lotus, and then started to wave her paws. She was saying that she’d destroyed its sprite and gave it a new one! An obedient sprite!

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled. He rubbed Snowy’s head gently, “Head inside!”

She nodded and entered the Primordial Pagoda with the black lotus.

Once Snowy went inside, Yang Ye looked up at Monarch Yan. There were a few dozen Destiny Realm experts behind him!

Yang Ye chuckled, “I may not be a match for all of you, but I can kill more than half of you. Moreover, I can cripple the rest in the process. Especially you, Monarch Yan, I’ll definitely kill you!”

Yang Ye charged forward once he finished speaking!

Monarch Yan’s face gradually turned gloomy when he saw Yang Ye charge at them.

If he were being honest, he didn’t want to face Yang Ye, but if he refused to face Yang Ye, he would have to face the strongest form of Destiny!

If they were compared, then Yang Ye was still slightly weaker!

Monarch Yan’s face gradually turned ferocious, “Kill!”

He charged forward once he finished speaking!

Bang!

A ray of blood red sword intent surged out from Yang Ye!

Slaughter intent!

Sword intent that contained slaughter intent!

Yang Ye’s sword shot forward!

Monarch Yan was blasted away. Now that he’d lost the mysterious fiery lightning and black lotus, he was no match for Yang Ye.. Once he pushed Monarch Yan back, Yang Ye swung his sword again.

Hiss!

It sliced an approaching demon beast in two!

However, in this instant, a demon beast slammed against Yang Ye’s back.

Bang!

Yang Ye was slammed flying, and blood sprayed repeatedly from his mouth. Obviously, it wasn’t just a light injury that he’d just sustained.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye hadn’t even been able to stop himself before a few dozen powerful auras slammed down at him.

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly, and he hurriedly released his sword intent and slaughter intent. However, they couldn’t resist those auras and were instantly smashed into bits!

Yang Ye was very formidable when focusing on a single enemy, but Monarch Yan and the others refused to let him fight them in single combat!

A group siege!

They pounced madly at Yang Ye. At this moment, Yang Ye was being pushed back repeatedly, and he didn’t have the strength to fight back at all. However, the experts of the Four Dimensional Universe hadn’t noticed that Yang Ye’s sword intent and slaughter intent were growing stronger.

Even Monarch Yan had overlooked it because Yang Ye was being completely suppressed, and they’d even almost killed Yang Ye on many occasions!

Yang Ye was being constantly pushed back as he fought while blood seeped out incessantly from the corner of his mouth. His entire body was covered in injuries, and even Primordial Violet Energy and Polaris Energy couldn’t heal him in time.

Monarch Yan and the others fought even more desperately when they witnessed this!

Kill Yang Ye!

So long as they killed him, the Three Dimensional Universe could be annihilated in an instant!

In the sky, Yang Ye was pushed back as he fought, and his body was dyed red with blood. However, his face was extremely calm, unusually even!

Suddenly, a demon slammed against Yang Ye’s back.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted away, and a huge hole appeared in his back. His body was completely covered in cracks!

Monarch Yan and the others grew even more ferocious from the sight of this. A few dozen of them instantly charged at Yang Ye!

This time, Yang Ye would definitely die!

A moment later, they were growing closer and closer to him, and Yang Ye gradually tightened his grip on his sword.

Monarch Yan frowned. His intuition told him that something was off. Suddenly, he seemed to have thought of something, and his eyes opened wide as he howled with fury, “Retreat! Don’t attack him! He's going to enter the state of…”

Yang Ye suddenly looked up at them.

Bang!

A wave of powerful sword intent suddenly swept out of Yang Ye. It forcibly stopped over a dozen experts from the Four Dimensional Universe, and at the same time, a ray of sword energy flashed.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Those experts that had been forced to a stop suddenly split open at the center!

Over a dozen peak Destiny Realm experts had been instantly killed from a single attack!

The Fate Sword Dao!
