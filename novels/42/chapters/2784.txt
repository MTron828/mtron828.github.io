Chapter 2785 – Breakthrough of the Heart!

Obviously, she planned to sacrifice herself!

Suddenly, a strand of mysterious energy enveloped her.

The Sword Domain!

As soon as it enveloped her, the flames around her were instantly suppressed by force!

Yang Ye pulled her to his side and glanced at her, “I told you, I don’t want anyone to sacrifice themselves for me.”

She looked him in the eyes, “Then shall we die together?”

Yang Ye cracked a smile, “I don’t want to die. However, if I have to, it can’t be helped.”

Even though he was smiling, there were tears flowing out the corners of his eyes.

Too, too many had vanished all along the way.

Blood Maiden, Yang Wudi, Elder Mu… Erya who had returned to her original form for him. There were many, many people in his memories.

Dead!

No one wanted to die, but he didn’t want others to give up their lives so that he could live.

Yang Ye gazed at Monarch Yan and the others that had already surrounded them, “While leaving would allow me to survive, my heart would never find peace. My sword does not seek invincibility, it seeks a clear conscience.”

Suddenly, the Sword Precursor shook violently, and then a sword howl tore through the sky and shot up above the clouds.

The sword intent and slaughter intent around Yang Ye grew rapidly, and his aura was growing rapidly as well.

Monarch Yan fell silent for a moment, and then he spoke softly, “The Three Dimensional Universe is full of outstanding experts!”

The mysterious expert nodded slightly, “Moments of life and death are the greatest test of the heart, and the greatest test of the Sword Heart…”

Before a Go board high above in the clouds, the woman suddenly shot a glance down toward her right. A moment of silence ensued before she grinned, “A clear conscience. His heart toward the Sword Dao has found truth, the extreme, and purity… Everything is born from the heart, and the heart has overcome Destiny. Another has struggled free of those shackles.”

The Four Dimensional Universe.

Yang Ye’s sword intent and slaughter intent were already at an extremely terrifying level, and the Destiny Realm experts in the surroundings had fear in their eyes!

Previously, Yang Ye had already attained the Ordinary Sword. Now, he’d clearly attained another advancement!

It could be said that besides the woman in white, Monarch Yan, and the mysterious expert, no one else here could resist a swing of his sword now!

Yang Ye looked up at space, fell silent for a moment, and then gazed at Monarch Yan and the mysterious expert, “Shall we fight one on one?”

Fight!

At this moment, Yang Ye had forgotten about life and death. All he wanted was to fight!

Monarch Yan shook his head, “It’s not that I fear you, but it’s meaningless to fight you in single combat right now.”

He gazed at the mysterious expert, “What do you think?”

The mysterious expert nodded, “We must kill him, of course!”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye suddenly swung his sword with both hands.

This attack carried his Sword Domain and dual intents!

Bang!

In an instant, the space in a huge area around Yang Ye was obliterated. At the same time, countless rays of sword energy appeared within the Sword Domain.

A grinder of sword energy!

However, once the mysterious expert and shadow attacked in unison, the sword energy was instantly obliterated. But at this moment, Yang Ye had taken the woman in white and retreated far away!

Monarch Yan laughed coldly, “You must be dreaming if you think that you can escape!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he raised his right hand and pulled lightly.

A pike suddenly appeared before Yang Ye and the woman in white!

Yang Ye raised his sword and slashed.

Bam!

The pike was instantly blasted away!

However, Monarch Yan and the mysterious expert had appeared before him.

Monarch Yan shook his head, “You think you can escape? You’re too naïve!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he raised his hands. In an instant, a pike transformed into a beam of black light that shot at Yang Ye and the woman in white.

The woman in white was about to counterattack when Yang Ye forcibly sent her into the Primordial Pagoda. She’d gone head-on against Monarch Yan and the mysterious expert just now, and she’d forcibly ignited her soul earlier. While Yang Ye had managed to stop her, it had still done harm to her body and vitality. If she were to forcibly continue fighting, she would really be giving her life away!

Once he sent her into the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye swiftly drew his sword and slashed.

Bang!

The pike was instantly blasted away. But at the same instant that he swung his sword, a pitch black palm slammed against his chest.

A mouthful of blood sprayed from Yang Ye as his figure was blasted away.

Yang Ye’s figure hadn’t even stopped when a pike tore through space once more. At the same time, a few dozen auras slammed down upon him like mountains from all around.

Besides that, his Sword Domain shattered as soon as it formed!

At this moment, Yang Ye knew that he may be finished!

Nothing was working.

He was being suppressed by absolute strength!

However, Yang Ye still refused to just wait for death to arrive.

Right when he was about to ignite his soul, Monarch Yan and the mysterious expert suddenly stopped. They turned around simultaneously, and then two shadows slammed against them.

Bang! Bang!

Two explosions resounded, and then they were pushed back repeatedly!

Two familiar faces appeared before Yang Ye!

It was Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu!

Yang Ye cracked a smile, “Long time no see!”

As soon as he finished speaking, blood surged out incessantly like a fountain from his mouth!

Only god knows how many Destiny Realm experts he’d fought on his own just now!

Tian Xiu glanced at Yang Ye, and then she walked over to him and patted him lightly on the shoulder, “Nice work!”

In the past, he’d been relying on too many things. At that time, she’d been quite disappointed in him. But now, she was very satisfied with Yang Ye’s growth!

He was truly capable of holding his own!

For some reason, Yang Ye was very happy and pleased to be praised by her!

Qi Bitian sized up Yang Ye and smiled, “Kid, you really grow quick. Now, even I wouldn’t dare to say that I can defeat you in a one-on-one battle!”

Yang Ye smiled embarrassedly, “Senior, what are you doing here?”

Qi Bitian replied, “Kid, you got lucky. We were here to explore the Four Dimensional Universe when we sensed a fight here. So, we came over to have a look. But we never expected to find you here. You’re really brave to actually come all the way here, huh?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. He’d gone a little too far this time. He felt like he could come and go as he pleased, but the facts proved that the mysterious expert and the Four Dimensional Universe weren’t as weak as he thought!

The Ordinary Sword did not represent invincibility!

However, he’d gained a lot from this incident. The changes in his Sword Heart could be described as an unparalleled change in him. Now, he could fight the mysterious expert or Monarch Yan on his own!

Now, he was truly among the ranks of the true experts!

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu gazed at Monarch Yan and the mysterious expert, “I’m taking him with me!”

Monarch Yan shook his head, “Over our dead bodies?”

Yang Ye wasn’t the same Yang Ye anymore. Allowing him to leave now was like allowing a tiger to return to its mountain!

Tian Xiu nodded slightly and gazed at Yang Ye, “Can you still fight?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I can still kill at least 10!”

Tian Xiu spoke softly, “Leave these two to us!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Qi Bitian and her vanished on the spot.

Meanwhile, a flame suddenly appeared in the mysterious expert’s grasp!

Omni Phantom!

As soon as the powerful flame appeared, this entire part of the world turned slightly ethereal.

The mysterious expert suddenly vanished on the spot, and then a wave of flames surged at Tian Xiu.

Tian Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly as she slowly clenched her fists. A moment later, a wave of dark light swept out from her.

Bang!

As soon as they collided, the entire area shook and transformed into an ocean of flames!

But just a moment later, the flames vanished!

A little fellow had appeared on Yang Ye’s shoulder.

Snowy!

Snowy inhaled greedily and gazed at the mysterious expert who was rapidly retreating. Or to be more precise, she was looking at the flame in his grasp.

Snowy blinked as she gazed at it, and then cracked a smile. Even Yang Ye didn’t know what that smile meant…

The Omni Phantom in the mysterious expert’s grasp shook violently, and then it was about to charge at Snowy.

Obviously, it was infuriated by her!

Snowy shuddered when she saw that it wanted to charge at her. It wasn’t fear but excitement…

The Omni Phantom didn’t charge at her in the end because the mysterious expert stopped it!

The mysterious expert shook his head at the flame, “She’s your bane!”

He put it away while he spoke.

Disappointment flashed through Snowy’s eyes when she witnessed this.

Yang Ye hurriedly sent the little fellow back into the Primordial Pagoda because he noticed that the little fellow seemed like she wanted to charge over there!

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu glanced at Yang Ye, “Retreat from here.”

Yang Ye nodded and retreated.

Even if they were going to fight, they couldn’t do it in the enemy’s base. At the very least, their joint forces had no chance, not even if they included the woman in white!

Zuo Mu and the others charged at Yang Ye when they noticed his intent to retreat. They were led by the Devil Caracal. Presently, only it could resist Yang Ye’s attacks!

Other Destiny Realm experts would practically die as soon as they got close to him!

A vicious glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes as he gazed at the Devil Caracal that was charging at him. He tightened his grip on the hilt of his sword, and then sped up. At this moment, his body had started to turn ethereal!

The Sword Domain!

Yang Ye grew even faster!

At this moment, a vicious glow flashed through the Devil Caracal’s eyes, and it rose its speed to its limits!Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Man and demon grew closer and closer!

A breath of time later, Yang Ye suddenly drew his sword!

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the Devil Caracal was blasted away. However, Yang Ye was pushed back repeatedly, all the way back to where he’d been standing a moment ago!

Zuo Mu and the others were about to attack, but a furious howl suddenly resounded from afar.

All of them looked over to its source, and they saw a young girl had suddenly appeared above the Devil Caracal.

Erya!

Erya’s eyes were scarlet red as she slammed her fist at the Devil Caracal’s head.

Bang!

The Devil Caracal crashed down from midair, but Erya was even faster. She slammed against its head before it could even crash to the ground.

A howl of pain resounded!

The Devil Caracal was slammed into the ground!

Erya patted her palms together and gazed at Yang Ye. Yang Ye gulped, and then he pointed at Zuo Mu’s group.

It was obvious what he was trying to convey.
