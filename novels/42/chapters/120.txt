Chapter 121 – Trouble

The Tomb of Emperor Zhou wasn’t within the imperial palace, and it was beneath it instead. After all of them entered the entrance of the imperial palace, it wasn’t a luxurious imperial palace that appeared within their fields of vision, and it was an expanse of flat ground instead. The others seemed to be aware of this scene since the beginning. They didn’t stop at all or feel any surprise, and they didn’t slow down at all before running towards the nearby pitch black entrance on the ground.

When she noticed Yang Ye’s surprise, Qin Xiyue explained. “My Grand Qin Empire’s ancestor had fought Emperor Zhou here all those years ago. Can you imagine how terrifying a battle between two Monarch Realm experts would be? So, the imperial palace was reduced to ruins before their battle.”

Yang Ye was visibly moved when he heard this, and he thought in his heart. This is the strength of the Monarch Realm? If I had the strength of a Monarch Realm expert as well, then would I have to fear the Flower Palace?

After a short moment, Yang Ye took a deep breath, and he stopped thinking about such unrealistic things. He tightened his grip on the sword in his hand before walking towards the entrance.

He only wanted to do two things now. The first was to establish a power that could help him, and the second was to work hard on improving his strength so that he could fight his way into the Ascension Rankings and obtain the Ascension Token!

What he had to at this moment was to obtain some gains from within the Tomb of Emperor Zhou, and it would be best if he could get some top-grade Energy Stones!

Of course, it would be even better if he had the opportunity to kill the Flower Palace’s Su Xiaoxiao!

“It’s those two people that humiliated our Flower Palace earlier?” Not too far away, a woman that wore palace closed gazed at Yang Ye and Qin Xiyue’s backs as she asked Su Xiaoxiao who stood by her side.

“Senior Sister, it was them!” Su Xiaoxiao spoke in a respectful tone.

The woman glanced at Su Xiaoxiao and said, “Xiaoxiao, your strength and natural talent are extremely good. If you’re willing to place your attention on cultivating, then your accomplishments in the future will definitely not be bad. Besides that, even though our Flower Palace doesn’t prohibit its disciples from engaging in ‘mutual cultivation’, but you have to pay attention to your reputation. Moreover, don’t think that you’re smart. You’re using Gong Yuan, yet you fail to realize that he’s using you as well!”

Su Xiaoxiao’s figure shook, and she hurriedly said, “Xiaoxiao understands!”

The woman nodded, and then she looked at the entrance and said in a cold voice, “No matter what, since they dared to humiliate our Flower Palace, then they must pay the price for their actions. Even if they’re princes and princesses of the Grand Qin Empire!”

Su Xiaoxiao was delighted when she heard this. Because this senior sister of hers was furious, and if this senior sister of hers was furious, then Yang Ye and Qin Xiyue would definitely suffer!

After the woman in palace clothes walked through the entrance with Su Xiaoxiao, the nearby Xu Yan said to Gong Yuan who stood by his side, “Keep your distance from that Su Xiaoxiao in the future. That woman’s cultivation technique is a Mutual Cultivation Technique. Even though I know that you definitely have a way to deal with it, it’s best to not come into contact with her. The Flower Palace isn’t that simple. Besides that, it’s best if you keep a lower profile when you do things in the future. Even though our Origin School isn’t afraid of anyone or any power, there’s no need to act arrogantly and make enemies everywhere!”

Gong Yuan’s heart shook. He knew that this senior brother of his was slightly displeased because he’d offended a King Realm expert for the sake of a woman. He immediately bowed and said, “Gong Yuan will remember Senior Brother’s words!”

Xu Yan nodded. Suddenly, he turned around and looked at the entrance to the imperial palace. He said, “Dong Wushang, since you’ve come, then why don’t you show yourself? Could it be that you want to launch a surprise attack against me?”

“Haha....” Along with a wave of roaring laughter, a tall and robust young man suddenly appeared at the entrance. The young man was around 20 plus years old. He wore a long robe that was a mix of blue and white, and a pitch black sword was carried on his back at an angle.

This man called Dong Wushang arrived before Xu Yan before he said with a smile, “I never expected that I would be noticed by Brother Xu in the end! Looks like after not seeing each other for a year, Brother Xu’s strength had improved a great deal again. How about we look for an opportunity to have a spar?”

Xu Yan smiled and said, “I never expected that the Sword Sect sent Brother Dong over. Oh, right. According to my knowledge, the Ghost Sect’s Ghostarm has already entered the Tomb of Emperor Zhou. If Brother Dong doesn’t want those three disciples of your Sword Sect to perish, then it’s best that you hurry up. Otherwise, only three corpses will remain!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Dong Wushang’s expression changed when he heard this, and then he said in a low voice, “Brother Xu, this time, your Origin School won’t interfere in the matters between my Sword Sect and the Ghost Sect right?”

“What do you think?” Xu Yan smiled, and then fell silent before he led the four others behind him towards the entrance to the tomb.

After a long time, Dong Wushang took a deep breath and walked towards the entrance of the tomb.

......

After he entered the Tomb of Emperor Zhou, Yang Ye was stunned by the scene before his eyes. Countless passageways stood before him. All of these passageways continued towards the end of his field of vision, and where they led to was unknown.

“The Tomb of Emperor Zhou has six main chambers and 12 sub-chambers. Only one of these six main chambers is the true tomb of Emperor Zhou, whereas, the 12 sub-chambers are where Emperor Zhou’s 12 Personal Gold Guard rest. Let’s forget the six main chambers, and it’s enough if we’re able to find one of the 12 sub-chambers. However, even that’s very difficult!” Qin Xiyue provided Yang Ye an explanation about the Tomb of Emperor Zhou as they walked. As a princess of the empire, the imperial household possessed all the relevant information related to this tomb, so she was quite familiar with it.

“Why should we forget about the six main chambers?” Yang Ye was puzzled. “The six main chambers are presumably where Emperor Zhou and the people important to Emperor Zhou rest. So, the burial treasures will definitely not be ordinary. Don’t you tell me to forget about it because the six main chambers have already been completely plundered by the six great powers and the Grand Qin Empire, or?”

Qin Xiyue shook her head and said, “Even the six great powers and my Grand Qin Empire were unable to find these six main chambers and 12 sub-chambers, so how could they plunder them?”

As if she knew what Yang Ye would ask, she continued. “Because this tomb was created by that Shengong Mao, and he utilized supreme divine abilities to conceal these chambers. Unless a Theurgist that knows Theurgy and surpasses Shengong Mao in Theurgy appears, otherwise, even a Monarch Realm expert would be unable to locate those chambers. Unless they destroyed this tomb!”

After Qin Xiyue said all of this, Yang Ye could be said to have come to an understanding. The reason the six great powers and the Grand Qin Empire had opened the Tomb of Emperor Zhou to the public wasn’t just because they intended to temper their disciples, and it was also because they hoped that an independent cultivator might be able to locate the six main chambers and 12 sub-chambers. There were all sorts of talented people in the world, so who knew if a Theurgist might really appear? Perhaps the six great powers and the Grand Qin Empire were holding exactly such thoughts, and it was fine even if no one located the chambers because they didn’t lose anything at any rate.

“Looks like you understand!” Qin Xiyue said, “In the beginning, the six great powers and the Grand Qin Empire really did hope that an independent cultivator might be able to find those chambers. However, along with the passage of a few hundred years, they’d completely abandoned such thoughts and even withdrew all the experts that were guarding this place. So, if we’re able to find a sub-chamber now, then we don’t have to worry about being targeted by the six great powers and the Grand Qin Empire!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly when he heard this. “Even the six great powers and the Grand Qin Empire were unable to accomplish it, yet you hope we’re able to?”

Right at this moment, the violet mink on Yang Ye’s shoulder suddenly flickered to arrive before the two of them, and then it pointed its little claw at itself.

“You’re able to locate it?” Yang Ye and Qin Xiyue spoke with astonishment at the same time.

The violet mink shook its little head, and then it ceaselessly waved its little claws.

After a short while, Yang Ye gazed at the violet mink and said in a low voice, “You’re saying that something is calling out to you?”

The violet mink hurriedly nodded.

Yang Ye frowned. If it was above ground, then perhaps he would take the violet mink to have a look. But this was a tomb, so could anything here be good?

He thought for a moment before he asked another question. “Is that thing that’s calling out to you something good, or bad?”

The violet mink blinked and didn’t know whether it should shake its head or nod. Obviously, this question baffled it as well.

Qin Xiyue rolled her eyes at Yang Ye and said, “Little Brother, it hasn’t even seen the thing that’s calling out to it, so how could it determine if that thing is good or bad? Aren’t you making things difficult for it?”

Yang Ye smiled embarrassedly, and then he said, “Little Fellow, do you want to go have a look?”

The violet mink thought for a moment before it nodded.

Yang Ye was still slightly hesitant because he was truly a bit worried.

Right at this moment, Qin Xiyue said, “Let’s go have a look. Darkbeasts usually reject and feel aversion towards dangerous things. Since it wants to go have a look, then it represents that the thing that’s calling out to it doesn’t have any ill intent towards it!”

When he heard this, Yang Ye stopped hesitating and immediately nodded.

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s pupils constricted as he swiftly turned around to look behind them. Two women were looking coldly at him from over 30m away, and one of those women was Su Xiaoxiao.
