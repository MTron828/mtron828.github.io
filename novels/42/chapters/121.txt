Chapter 122 – How Audacious!

The woman in palace clothes glanced at Qin Xiyue before she looked at Yang Ye and said, “It’s you who humiliated my Flower Palace?”

Yang Ye laughed coldly and said, “Humiliate? Could it be that I said something wrong? Customer and courtesan are those that only go to bed together yet avoid any talk of emotion. So, isn’t the relationship between Su Xiaoxiao and Gong Yuan exactly like that of a customer and courtesan? Since she dares to act in that way, then can others not speak about it?”

Su Xiaoxiao was infuriated to the point her face turned livid, and she was just about to attack. However, the woman in palace clothes stopped her before she looked at Yang Ye and said in a cold voice, “Young man, is there enmity between you and my Junior Sister, or is there enmity between you and my Flower Palace?”

This question carried deep meaning. If Yang Ye said he had enmity with the Flower Palace, then it would be a serious matter. Because then Yang Ye’s objective from before wasn’t to humiliate Su Xiaoxiao, and it was to humiliate the Flower Palace. If Yang Ye humiliated the Flower Palace, then even if Yang Ye was a personal disciple of a power, she would still dare to annihilate him on the spot because it was related to the honor of her sect!

On the contrary, if it was merely enmity between him and Su Xiaoxiao, then she could only teach him a lesson at most and couldn’t strike a killing blow. Of course, the precondition was that Yang Ye’s identity could make this woman take it seriously!

Qin Xiyue’s beautiful brows knit together slightly, and she was just about to say something when Yang Ye said, “Is it important? Regardless of whether it’s enmity with Su Xiaoxiao or your Flower Palace, don’t you still intend to make a move against me? So, please don’t waste your breath and attack directly, alright?” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

As soon as he finished speaking, the Profound Energy in Yang Ye’s entire body surged while he was already prepared to summon the two Nether Wolf Kings and the Earthbale Sword Chest. If the woman attacked, then he would utilize his full strength to annihilate them right here. Because the Flower Palace had made his mother suffer, so he didn’t mind taking some ‘interest’ first.

The woman’s face turned cold. She looked at Qin Xiyue and said, “She’s your reliance? If it’s just that, then you’re completely mistaken. Xiaoxiao, I’ll keep that King Realm woman occupied, and I’ll leave him to you! Don’t kill him but leave him on the brink of death!” As soon as she finished speaking, her figure flashed towards Qin Xiyue.

Qin Xiyue didn’t waste her breath. Her wrist moved before the whip appeared within her palm, and then she moved to greet the woman in battle.

Even though she didn’t know why Yang Ye constantly went against the Flower Palace, she still chose to support him. There was no other reason than because they were on the same boat, and she needed Yang Ye to help rescue her mother!

Su Xiaoxiao gazed at Yang Ye while a wisp of a savage expression flashed in her eyes. She said, “I’ll cut off your tongue and ‘Lil Brother’, and I’ll make you....”

“If you want to fight, then let’s fight. What’s with all the bullshit!?” Yang Ye interrupted her and charged at her.

“Hmph!” Su Xiaoxiao grunted coldly. With a movement of her wrist, a sword had appeared in her hand as well, and she moved to greet Yang Ye in battle.

Right when he was merely 6m away from Su Xiaoxiao, Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed, and the Profound Energy within his body surged madly into the Gale Shoes. After that, he suddenly stomped his right foot on the ground, and then he relied on the counterforce from the ground and the boost from the Gale Shoes to leave a string of afterimages behind as he instantly arrived 3m away from Su Xiaoxiao.

Sui Xiaoxiao’s expression had changed violently when Yang Ye had suddenly sped up, and she knew that she’d underestimated her opponent. Fortunately, her reaction wasn’t slow, and she swung her sword lightly. Over 10 sword lights formed from Profound Energy shot towards Yang Ye, and at the same time, her right foot tapped the ground as she intended to pull apart the distance between her and Yang Ye.

Gale Steps! Yang Ye disregarded the sword lights and silently spoke the words ‘Gale Steps’ in his heart. After that, his speed suddenly sped up once more, and he instantaneously arrived before Su Xiaoxiao who was prepared to retreat, and then he drew his sword and stabbed it directly at Su Xiaoxiao’s chest.

Su Xiaoxiao’s eyes revealed shock and terror when she saw his speed suddenly increase once more, and then with a thought in her heart, she was about to utilize her Profound Energy Barrier. However, right at the instant she issued this thought in her heart, she suddenly felt pain come from her chest. Why do I feel pain? His sword is still in the sheath in his hand? He still hasn’t drawn his sword!

In next to no time, Su Xiaoxiao’s consciousness turned blurry. At the last moments of consciousness, her eyes noticed the hole in her chest, and when she saw this hole, Su Xiaoxiao muttered in a low voice. “How... swift....” She hadn’t finished speaking when she crashed to the ground.

After he dealt with Su Xiaoxiao, Yang Ye turned around to look at the woman that was locked in a fierce battle with Qin Xiyue, and he didn’t hesitate at all to execute the Gale Steps and charge towards her.

Since he’d killed once of them, then it was best to kill the other one as well!

The woman in palace clothes who was in battle with Qin Xiyue noticed that a strand of aura was suddenly approaching from behind her, and her expression changed. Her figure flashed 3m towards the side, and at the moment she’d just left, a strand of Sword Qi had just happened to tear through the sky and arrive there. Because the woman had dodged, this strand of sword qi had left a mark behind on the wall of the passageway in the end.

The woman turned around, and her pupils constricted when she saw Yang Ye. After that, she turned her head to look towards the distance, and Su Xiaoxiao’s corpse was lying silently the ground not too far away.

“You killed her?” The woman turned her head to look at Yang Ye while a vicious aura surged from her body. After that, she seemed to have thought of something, and she gazed at the sword in Yang Ye’s hand and said, “You’re a disciple of the Sword Sect. How audacious of you! You actually dared to kill a disciple of my Flower Palace!” As she spoke, she was about to attack directly.

Yet at this moment, Qin Xiyue arrived by Yang Ye’s side while her vital energy locked onto the woman in palace clothes, causing the woman’s body to stiffen for a moment, and she didn’t attack immediately

Actually, at this moment, Qin Xiyue was shocked in her heart as well. She’d never expected that Yang Ye would really kill Su Xiaoxiao, nor had she imagined that he would actually kill her so quickly. Is he really only at the Mortal Realm?

Yang Ye didn’t answer the woman, and he was just about to summon the two Nether Wolf Kings to deal with this woman who stood before him.

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. He turned around to look at the passageway in the distance, and he saw those five members of the Origin School and the four members of the Sword Sect walking over towards them.

When he saw them, Yang Ye abandoned his thoughts of dealing with the woman here. If the members of the Origin School assisted the woman in palace clothes, then he might not be able to kill her even if he summoned the two King Rank Darkbeasts. Unless of course if he utilized the Pearl of Baleful Blood. However, even Su Qingshi was extremely fearful of that pearl, so he wouldn’t utilize it rashly unless he had no other choice!

When they noticed Su Xiaoxiao’s corpse, the members of the Origin School and the Sword Sect were stunned, and all of them looked at Yang Ye and Qin Xiyue when they recovered from their shock.

“Dong Wushang! Your Sword Sect is truly bold and actually dared to kill a disciple of my Flower Palace! Looks like your Sword Sect intends to become enemies with my Flower Palace! Good, very good indeed!” The woman looked at Dong Wushang as she spoke in a cold voice.

Dong Wushang was stunned, and then bewilderment appeared in his eyes. Wei Ran who stood by Dong Wushang’s side suppressed the shock in his heart and hurriedly said, “Senior Brother Dong, that young man is called Yang Ye, and he’s an Outer Court Disciple of our Sword Sect. He’s....”

“Haha....” Wei Ran hadn’t finished speaking when a gloomy sound of laughter resounded abruptly. After that, a man in a black robe suddenly appeared here. The black robed man glanced at Su Xiaoxiao’s corpse that lay on the ground while a wisp of greed flashed in his eyes, and it was only there for an instant.

“Ghostarm!” When he saw this person, Dong Wushang’s eyes narrowed slightly. A wisp of killing intent flashed in his eyes, but a wisp of fear accompanied his killing intent as well.

The man called Ghostarm moved his gaze from Su Xiaoxiao’s corpse with slight reluctance, and then he looked at the woman in palace clothed and said, “Zhao Hanyue, the Sword Sect has already killed an Outer Court Disciple of your sect, so why are you wasting your breath? Why don’t we join forces and slaughter all the disciples of the Sword Sect that are present here, alright?”

The eyes of the woman called Zhao Hanyue narrowed, and she seemed to be slightly tempted.

Dong Wushang’s expression changed when he noticed this. If two King Realm experts joined forces, then it wasn’t something he could go against at all. So, he immediately and hastily said, “Senior Sister Zhao, my Sword Sect absolutely has no ill intent towards the Flower Palace. So, there’s definitely some sort of misunderstanding. In short, I’ll definitely give you an explanation, alright?”

“An explanation?” Zhao Hanyue said in a cold voice, “Then hand that Outer Court Disciple of your Sword Sect to me to deal with, alright?”

Actually, she didn’t want to join forces with the Ghost Sect as well because she really disliked the way the Ghost Sect did things. However, if the Sword Sect didn’t give her a satisfying explanation, then she didn’t mind joining forces with the Ghost Sect for now.

Dong Wushang took a deep breath before he looked towards Yang Ye and Qin Xiyue that stood at the side. His eyelids twitched when he saw Qin Xiyue, and he immediately asked. “You are?”

Qin Xiyue smiled and said, “I’m not a disciple of the Sword Sect. So, you don’t have to pay any attention to me!”

Dong Wushang glanced deeply at Qin Xiyue, and then he looked at Yang Ye and said in a low voice, “Why did you kill Su Xiaoxiao? Don’t you know that your actions would cause our Sword Sect to become enemies with the Flower Palace?”

“What does that have to do with me?” Yang Ye laughed coldly.

Dong Wushang’s face sank.
