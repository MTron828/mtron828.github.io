Chapter 2216 – Fuck Off!

Yang Ye had left.

Elder Yuan was smiling instead.

Yang Lianshuang asked, “Why are you smiling?”

Elder Yuan replied softly, “He’s different in the end.”

Yang Lianshuang was puzzled, “Huh?”

Elder Yuan explained, “The others thought about their own interests first. If it was anyone else, hearing about the Dao Path’s annihilation would make that person think about himself, but he cares about the Dao Progenitor just because the Dao Progenitor once helped him!”

Yang Lianshuang fell silent.

Elder Yuan spoke softly, “You can rest at ease when following a person like him! Because you don’t have to worry about being betrayed!”

Yang Lianshuang said, “But people like this are the easiest to betray and use!”

Elder Yuan chuckled, “Indeed!”

She glanced at him, smiled, and didn’t say another word.

…

Yang Ye left Void Spirit Continent, and he saw many people fleeing madly all along the way.

The large universe was in utter chaos!

Yang Ye shook his head and sped up.

It didn’t take long for him to arrive at the Dao Dimension.

The Dao Dimension.

At this moment, it had collapsed, and the Dao Progenitor’s corpse floated above its ruins.

Once a progenitor, he was being treated like this now. Needless to say, it was quite sad. Yang Ye felt that the Dao Progenitor shouldn’t suffer such treatment, so he’d come here!

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the Dao Progenitor’s corpse floated over to him. Suddenly, an undying cavalry appeared not too far away from Yang Ye.

“Put it back!” The undying cavalry looked Yang Ye in the eye while ordering him.

Yang Ye ignored the undying cavalry and placed the Dao Progenitor’s corpse in the Primordial Pagoda. Once the corpse entered the pagoda, the Primordial Pagoda descended above the Dao Progenitor. It naturally recognized him.

The Dao Progenitor was its past master!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye looked up at the undying cavalry. At this moment, the undying cavalry was walking slowly in his direction with a spear in hand.

Suddenly, a blood red sword appeared in Yang Ye’s grasp, and then he transformed into a ray of red light that charged at the undying cavalry.

The undying cavalry’s pupils constricted, and then a wave of powerful energy slammed against her.

Bang!

The undying cavalry was blasted extremely far away, and she hadn’t even stopped herself when a blood red sword pierced through her chest.

Hiss!

The blood red sword took her figure along as it flew toward the distance.

However, Yang Ye frowned.

She was not dead!

Once the undying cavalry stopped herself, besides turning slightly pale and ethereal, she was completely unharmed!

However, there was a solemn gaze in her eyes when she looked at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye waved his right hand and the sword returned to his grasp.

Yang Ye was about to attack again when the undying cavalry turned around and vanished into the distance.

She’d run away!

Or to be more precise, she’d fled!

While Yang Ye’s attack hadn’t been able to kill her, it had heavily injured her. She was no fool, she knew that if this continued, she would really die.

While Yang Ye was just a Sage now, his strength wasn’t inferior to a progenitor!

So, ordinary undying cavalry were no match for him. However, Yang Ye had a headache with their undying bodies! Just one of them was easy to deal with because even if he couldn’t kill that undying cavalry, he could beat up that undying cavalry to the point of being completely immobile. However, there were 600 of them!

Moreover, they were only the tip of the iceberg that was the undying race!

What kind of experts were standing behind the undying cavalry?

If the undying race sent all its forces, how would he fight them now?”

Yang Ye didn’t think further about this and just left.

Void Spirit Continent!

After he buried the Dao Progenitor in the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Lianshuang appeared before him.

“Many have come here!” Yang Lianshuang continued, “Do you want to go have a look? You know quite a few of them!”

“I know them?” Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded.

Outside the city was a huge crowd of people, and they were like a huge mass of ants.

Yang Ye recognized the person in the lead.

Xiao Qi!

Xiao Qi and Dao Qing were in the group that led the entire mass of people. The sky race’s experts stood behind Xiao Qi, and some disciples of the Dao Path were behind Dao Qing.

Yang Ye frowned again when he saw them.

Meanwhile, Xiao Qi walked over to Yang Ye and lowered her head slightly, “So many of my sky race have died. W-We can’t stop the undying race. The sky race is in chaos now, and I…”

Yang Ye rubbed her head while his heart couldn’t help but hurt a little. In the past, she had nothing to worry about, yet now, such a heavy burden like the sky race had been placed on her shoulders. So, how could she endure it?

Yang Ye shook his head and spoke softly, “From now on, Void Spirit Continent is your home and the sky race’s home. You and everyone from the sky race can stay here. I’ll deal with everything else!”

Xiao Qi suddenly looked up at him. She just gazed at him like that, and then tears suddenly started to seek out of her eyes!

Yang Ye wiped her tears, “You’re the leader of the sky race now, you can’t cry in front of your people!”

Xiao Qi shook her head, “My father treated you like that… Sorry, sorry!”

While her father had been killed by Yang Ye, she didn’t hate him. Because her father had tried to kill him on many occasions, and Yang Ye was clearly capable of annihilating the sky race, but he hadn’t done so because of her. Now, he was even willing to let them stay here because of her.

Guilt!

She felt even more guilty now!

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Your father wanted to kill me, but you saved me so many times. Your father is your father, and you are you. I can annihilate the sky race because of him, and I can save it because of you.”

Of course he wanted to have no ties like the Unfettered One!

However, Yang Ye couldn’t do it in the end. There were too many people and things he had to care for. That was the difference between him and the Unfettered One. The Unfettered One could abandon everything including his loved ones, the Sword Sect, and many others… However, Yang Ye couldn’t abandon them.

Xiao Qi started crying even more when she heard him.

Yang Ye rubbed her head and gazed at Dao Qing. The others from the Dao Path were behind Dao Qing. As for the eight other main disciples of the Dao Progenitor, only five remained now.

The rest were just followers of the Dao Path!

Meanwhile, Dao Qing walked over to Yang Ye, and there was a wooden ring in his grasp. He raised it to Yang Ye, “Master asked me to give this to you before he died. It’s the symbol of the Dao Path’s master.”

The symbol of the Dao Path’s master!

Yang Ye remained silent.

Dao Qing laughed bitterly, “If you refuse it, the Dao Path will really vanish from this world!”

It would face annihilation!

Presently, Void Spirit Continent was the last paradise in the large universe, and it was the last hope for the Dao Path and countless others.

If Yang Ye refused to accept them, the Dao Path would be driven away. If the Dao Path was driven away in the current state of things, it would definitely perish. Not to mention ordinary cultivators, even Sages weren’t confident in their ability to survive. While Yang Ye’s side was extremely weak when compared to the undying race, it was temporarily safe for now.

Yang Ye gazed at the ring for a long time before he said, “I refuse to take it!”

The faces of the experts from the Dao Path turned pale.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye continued, “But you can enter Void Spirit City.”

Their expressions eased up slightly when they heard him. If Yang Ye drove them away, it would undoubtedly be no different than leaving them for destruction.

Yang Ye moved his gaze to the side. The group behind Dao Qing’s group was led by the Shaman Emperor. However, he wasn’t the same Shaman Emperor Yang Ye knew. Moreover, the spirit race, devil race, demon race, barbaric race, and the others were behind him.

The Shaman Emperor was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly waved his hand, “Besides the sky race, Dao Path, and human race, everyone fuck off right now. If anyone else besides them is still present here in 15 minutes, then I’ll kill every one of them!”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away.

He accepted the Dao Path because of the Dao Progenitor, and it was because the Dao Path hadn’t participated in the attack on him or his father. As for the sky race, he’d accepted them because of Xiao Qi! Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

But he would never accept the other races!

Yang Ye was no savior of the world!

Moreover, he hadn’t forgotten what they’d done to him. So, to be honest, he was being benevolent by not slaughtering them himself. Save them? They were dreaming if they thought he would!

Meanwhile, the Shaman Emperor said, “Yang Ye, we were wrong to do what we did. Now, the undying race is attacking, and the large universe has fallen. We should join forces…”

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded, and then a blood red sword stabbed into his chest.

The Shaman Emperor’s body instantly stiffened!

There was disbelief in the Shaman Emperor’s eyes.

Everyone here was shocked!

They hadn’t expected Yang Ye to attack and instantly kill the Shaman Emperor.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly turned around. He opened his eyes, and they were blood red.

All of them couldn’t help but step back from the sight of this.

Yang Ye glanced coldly at them, “Fuck off! Now!”

He turned around, took a few steps, and then stopped again. He said, “If you’re still here in 10 minutes, then you’ll follow in his footsteps!”
