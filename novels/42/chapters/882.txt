Chapter 883 – Is It The Void Rank?

As soon as those 2 strands of sword intent from the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor emerged from within him, Yang Ye’s body immediately felt lighter as the pressure upon him withdrew like a receding tide.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief. Actually, he could have released the Unfettered One’s sword intent in the beginning, but he hadn’t. Because he knew that while the sword intent in the surroundings were exerting pressure upon him, it was extremely beneficial to him. Yet now, they weren’t just exerting pressure on him, they wanted to crush him.

Yang Ye slowly closed his eyes because the sword intent around him couldn’t only be sensed and not seen.

So, he focused and cleared his mind.

Yang Ye’s expression gradually grew solemn because sword intent covered the surroundings, and every single strand was at the 3rd level of the Heaven Rank at least!

Moreover, there were 2 obscure strands of sword intent amongst them. He could only faintly sense that those 2 strands of sword intent were very powerful, and they weren’t weaker to the Unfettered One’s sword intent. However, they seemed to be completely disinterested in him, so they were quite far away from him.

As for the sword intent around him, they were eying him with hostility. However, they feared the Unfettered One’s sword intent, so they didn’t approach him.

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment before he withdrew a strand of the Unfettered One’s sword intent.

As soon as it vanished, the sword intent in the surroundings instantly seemed to be eager to pounce on Yang Ye, and they gradually started to approach him from all directions. Just as Daoist Gu had said, they didn’t contain any baleful energy or killing intent, so they didn’t attack Yang Ye, and they just relied on the fierce and sharp intent within them to exert pressure upon Yang Ye!

The pressure grew stronger and stronger, and it didn’t take long for Yang Ye’s bones to start cracking once more.

...

Outside the Pagoda of Sword Intent.

Lu Wan’er and the Sword Master of the Ancient Sword School, Jian Wuchen, were standing there, and a trace of worry could be seen in Lu Wan’er’s eyes.

Lu Wan’er asked, “Master, will he really be fine when you let him go in there without a protection token?”

Jian Wuchen shook his head and said, “He’s unlike anyone else. Just the strength of his body is sufficient for him to persist in there. Moreover, his sword intent dropped because he utilized a secret technique, so it would be utterly impossible for him to recover it in a short period of time without utilizing such methods to stimulate the core of the sword intent within him.”

Lu Wan’er spoke softly, “I know, but he might not be able to persist until his sword intent is restored to the 3rd level of the Heaven Rank....”

Jian Wuchen grinned, “His willpower far surpasses ordinary people, or I should say that it’s stronger than yours. So long as he doesn’t annoy the sword intent in there, then it shouldn’t be a problem for him to hold on for around half a month....”

Lu Wan’er said, “Didn’t you only allow him to cultivate there for 3 days?”

Jian Wuchen said, “That was just for others to hear. After all, if others were to find out that he was allowed to cultivate there for so long, then I can only imagine how many would be envious. So, I had no choice but to say that in order to help that kid avoid some trouble!”

Lu Wan’er nodded, and then she spoke abruptly, “What if he infuriates those strands of sword intent?”

Jian Wuchen spoke softly, “Then I can only wish him good luck....”

Lu Wan’er was at a loss for words.

...

Five days later.

Yang Ye had attained the 2nd level of Heaven Rank sword intent under the pressure exerted upon him from the sword intent in the surroundings. After he attained the 2nd level of Heaven Rank sword intent, Yang Ye withdrew the Unfettered One’s sword intent and relied on his own sword intent to resist the sword intent in the surroundings. While he was only at the 2nd level of the Heaven Rank, his sword intent had been Slaughter Sword Intent in the past, so it was much stronger than other forms of sword intent. Thus, he was barely able to resist the might of the sword intent in the surroundings!

Of course, while he could resist it, he had to endure a huge amount of pressure. After all, the sword intent in the surroundings weren’t inferior to his own, and they far surpassed him in numbers! However, that was exactly what he desired!

10 days passed just like that.

Bang!

Suddenly, a strand of terrifying sword intent swept out from within him. As soon as it had, the sword intent in the surroundings immediately moved backwards repeatedly, but it didn’t take long for them to press down upon him once more!

I’m finally at the 3rd level! Yang Ye took a deep breath while a trace of excitement appeared in his eyes. The recovery of his sword intent represented that he was even confident in his ability to kill high rank Half-Saints now! After all, 3rd level Heaven Rank sword intent could merge into space. Coupled with the Decay Laws that he possessed; it really wasn’t difficult for him to kill a high rank Half-Saint if he took that Half-Saint by surprise!

After all, even high rank Half-Saints couldn’t resist the Decay Laws he possessed.

Once the excitement passed, Yang Ye’s gaze swept through the surroundings while a trace of madness appeared within his eyes. There were at least a few thousand types of sword intent here, and if he were to devour them all, then perhaps he could attain Void Rank sword intent.

If it were an ordinary person or even Lu Wan’er in his position, that person would definitely not dare to do that. Because there were so many types of sword intent here, so if they were infuriated and swarmed a person, then not to mention them, even a high rank Half-Saint would probably be crushed alive!

However, Yang Ye didn’t want to give up because he might not have another chance!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and it didn’t take long for him to sense a comparatively weaker strand of sword intent. He didn’t hesitate to send his sword intent pouncing at that strand of sword intent.

As soon as he did that, the situation here instantly became heated as all the other sword intent in the surroundings suddenly pounced at him as well!

Yang Ye’s face turned grim because he hadn’t expected them to actually be so united. He hurriedly withdrew the Unfettered One’s sword intent, and the sword intent in the surroundings stopped moving for now. But it didn’t take long for Yang Ye’s expression to change once more. Because 2 strands of sword intent which weren’t inferior to the Unfettered One’s sword intent had started approaching him!

Moreover, the other strands of sword intent started to move under the lead of those 2 strands of sword intent!

A cold glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes as he took a step forward and activated the Sword Domain. As soon as he did that, the sword intent around him immediately stopped moving but became even more irritated.

Yang Ye sensed their emotions for a moment, and then he said, “Do all of you want to stay here forever?” He knew that even if he used the Sword Domain and those 2 strands of the Unfettered One’s sword intent, it would still be impossible for him to devour the sword intent here. Because they were clearly very united and seemed to reject him!

The only way was to make them willingly merge with his sword intent!

While it wasn’t very realistic, he still wanted to give it a try!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and continued, “Do all of you wish to stay here and be unable to see the light of day forever? Do you wish to just vanish one day? Every single one of your past masters were peerless experts who commanded great strength and authority. While they’ve fallen, don’t you want your past masters to continue commanding great strength and authority in a different manner?”

When he spoke up to this point, Yang Ye’s voice became heavier, “All of you are like plants without roots, and once sword intent that possess no roots vanish, it’ll vanish forever. Do all of you want to vanish forever?”

Yang Ye was able to sense that some of the sword intent in the surroundings were gradually calming down. Such a chance delighted Yang Ye, and he quickly continued, “The only way for all of you to leave this place is to merge with my sword intent. Because if you don’t, then they’ll never let all of you leave. Even if you can leave, all of you’ll be truly gone once you’re destroyed in the outside world. So, all of you have to merge with my sword intent and become a part of me. Only then can all of you leave, and you wouldn’t have to worry about being destroyed as well!”

Yang Ye was very clearly aware that while it didn’t affect these strands of sword intent in the beginning, they would definitely be unwilling to continue staying here after being trapped for such a long time. These sword intents had consciousnesses of their own. Perhaps it wasn’t true intelligence, but they definitely had a consciousness. So long as they yearned to head out into the outside world, then he naturally had a chance!

A long moment of silence ensued before a strand of sword intent suddenly entered Yang Ye’s sword intent which covered the area before him, and it merged into his sword intent.

As soon as that strand of sword intent merged with his sword intent, another shot into his sword intent as well. After that, strand after strand of sword intent surged incessantly into Yang Ye’s sword intent.

Just as he’d said, most of these strands of sword intent had been trapped here for too long. It would be fine if they didn’t possess any intelligence at all, but the problem was that most of them had a certain amount of intelligence. So, how could they be willing to stay here forever?

Of course, the reason many had chosen to merge with Yang Ye’s sword intent was because they thought highly of Yang Ye’s strength!

Actually, even if an ordinary disciple of the Ancient Sword School could merge with these strands of sword intent, that disciple would definitely not dare to do so. Because these strands of sword intent were a precious treasure of the sword school, and many disciples of the sword school used them to temper their own sword intent. If someone were to merge with the sword intent here, then the higher-ups of the sword school would definitely skin that person alive!

As for Yang Ye, he’d never thought about that. In any case, all he knew was that Daoist Gu had said that he could do it if he had the ability, and he didn’t care about anything else!

Fewer and fewer strands of sword intent remained here while Yang Ye’s own sword intent was growing stronger and stronger. However, it wasn’t so easy to merge with them because they more or less carried the wills of their former masters, and that was a huge point of conflict within Yang Ye. Fortunately, he possessed the Enlightened Sword Heart, and his will was extremely strong. So, he resisted and eliminated all of them!

A day passed by just like that. Less than 10 strands of sword intent remained here, and Yang Ye’s sword intent had arrived at a terrifying state.

It was at the peak of the Heaven Rank, the true peak of the Heaven Rank!

Yang Ye took a deep breath while his consciousness locked onto the last 10 strands of sword intent which remained here. They were undoubtedly the strongest amongst all the sword intent here. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “I will definitely bring honor to all of you if you come with me!”

Only silence remained in the surroundings, and those 10 strands of sword intent didn’t move at all.

Yang Ye remained silent for an instant, and then he turned around and walked towards the exit. Right when he was about to pass through the exit, those 10 strands of sword intent shot into him!

Bang!

A terrifying aura swept out from Yang Ye’s body, and then the entire Pagoda of Sword Intent crumbled apart!
