Chapter 2376 – The Right Birth is Important!

Where’s the most dangerous!

She gazed at the sword cultivator for a long time before pointing to the left, “The central area of the battlefield is in that direction.”

The sword cultivator nodded slightly and left in that direction.

Meanwhile, she suddenly asked, “What’s so special about him?”

Geniuses? Monstrous geniuses?

She’d seen too many of them.

Yang Ye’s natural talent and strength were not bad indeed, but just that little bit was nothing to her. After all, monstrous geniuses were everywhere during her time.

The sword cultivator didn’t stop, “In my heart, a person’s strength isn’t judged by their combat strength. A farmer can hold his ground against a hundred demons that far surpass him in strength just to protect his child and wife, that’s someone strong to me.”

He suddenly stopped at this point, “In the world I came from, I met someone, and he was willing to get entangled with me over countless worlds just for his loved ones. Actually, he could have gone further if he wanted, but he didn’t.”

The woman asked, “Why?”

The sword cultivator replied softly, “Because of love. Is it pedantic? Foolish? No, it's the true emotion of a true man!”

At this point, he gazed at her, “You too.”

He didn’t say more and vanished into the forest.

The woman held the memorial tablet in silence.

She’d attacked this sword cultivator before her when he’d first arrived at the forest, but she’d been defeated by a single move.

An expert?

As far as she was concerned, he was a true expert. But as far as he was concerned, that was not what being strong represented.

When there was a difference in strength and cultivation, one’s views would naturally be different too!

She restrained her thoughts and looked in the direction that Yang Ye and Nanli Meng had left toward. As she gazed at it, her gaze gradually turned blank.

…

Yang Ye and Nanli Meng left the forest, and not long after, they saw the desolate plains.

It was an endless plain!

“See that?” Nanli Meng pointed at the desolate plain, “A Primal Emperor perished here in the past!”

Yang Ye glanced at her, “Why are you so excited?”

She gazed at Yang Ye, “Excited? Do you know what a Primal Emperor is? An overlord of the ages, a true overlord!” She hurriedly withdrew her thick scroll, unfurled it, and wrote, “The Desolate Plains, a Primal Emperor fell here…”

Yang Ye had a weird expression on his face. Is there something wrong with her?”

They continued forward, and it didn’t take long for them to step foot into the desolate plains. However, they noticed an invisible force obstructing their path.

Pressure!

It was like a mountain floating above them!

At this moment, Yang Ye had a feeling that if he continued forward, he would be obliterated by the pressure.

They exchanged glances, and then Nanli Meng said, “It’s the Emperor’s will. See that? He died so long ago, but his will is able to suppress countless experts.”

Yang Ye looked up at the end of the desolate plains, and he was extremely shocked.

Will!

The Emperor had relied just on his will to cause such huge pressure to the experts of the later generations. If he was still alive, how terrifying would his strength be?

Weakness limited his imagination!

Those words did make sense.

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, and then he walked forward. As soon as he took the first step, a wave of powerful pressure slammed down upon him. In an instant, Yang Ye’s figure bent down, and his knees almost hit the ground.

It was absolutely powerful!

A wisp of madness arose on Yang Ye’s face. Suppress him with just will?

Boom!

A powerful wave of sword intent swept out from Yang Ye, but it only took a moment for it to be obliterated while Yang Ye was pushed all the way out of the plains!

Nanli Meng frowned.

Once he stopped himself, Yang Ye looked up at the desolate plains before him. Is the will of an Emperor that strong?

Yang Ye naturally wouldn’t just give up. So, he walked forward again. But as soon as he entered the area, he couldn’t take another step forward. The will pressed down upon him like countless mountains!

Going forward forcefully would lead to death!

Nanli Meng gazed at Yang Ye and remained silent. She was waiting for Yang Ye to decide.

She didn’t wait long before Yang Ye started walking again.

Yang Ye took a step forward. In an instant, his body became tense. Moreover, a strand of faint Dragon Pressure dispersed from him. Because he’d swallowed the Dragon Ball, he had Dragon Pressure. However, it wasn’t much. As for why, it was because he hadn’t truly unearthed its potential. Of course, it was absolutely weak before the will of the Primal Emperor!

Nanli Meng gazed at Yang Ye in silence.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Yang Ye finally took a step forward, and it was like moving a mountain. But he couldn’t lift his foot again after taking that step.

Yang Ye left the desolate plains, and he gazed at it in silence.

Nanli Meng didn’t disturb him. She looked into the distance, and no one knew what she was thinking.

A long time passed before Yang Ye suddenly took a step forward, and he smiled once he did that.

Nanli Meng smiled too!

This time, Yang Ye hadn’t used any form of energy. No profound energy, no physical strength, and no sword intent.

He’d retracted all his energy!

An ordinary person!

He was like an ordinary person right now!

While it was still very strenuous, it wasn’t as difficult as before.

Yang Ye gazed at Nanli Meng, and the latter smiled, “In this place, the stronger you are, the greater the suppression you will face. Simple speaking, this Primal Emperor left this will behind as a test. Of course, it’s to keep away people with ill intent too. However, I think it was mainly left here as a test. What kind of test? It’s a test of will, of course. A person’s will isn’t linked to the person’s strength, and a person’s will can only be truly tested once all forms of energy are abandoned.

She gazed at the plains and continued, “Come on! Whether we’re able to meet that emperor will depend on our own willpower.”

She walked forward once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye glanced at Nanli Meng. Obviously, she knew the secrets of this place, and the woman with the memorial tablet was probably aware as well. However, her willpower may have been insufficient, so she hadn’t been able to go far enough. But both of them refused to tell him… Moreover, his intuition told him that if he wasn’t able to discover the secrets of this place, she would have never told him.

Fortune!

It had to be obtained by one’s own efforts!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and hurried after her.

In the desolate plain.

They started off quite quickly, but they gradually slowed down.

Pressure!

The pressure was still there, but it was different now. It didn’t press down on their bodies, it pressed down on their will! It was pressure that struck their will!

Nanli Meng’s face was calm as she walked slowly by Yang Ye’s side.

Nanli Meng suddenly said, “What do you think is most important in the path of cultivation?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Natural talent, resources, mentality, and will.”

She asked, “Which one of them is the most important?”

Yang Ye glanced at her, “I think none of them are important!”

She gazed at him, and he spoke indifferently, “I think the right birth is most important.”

She was stunned, and then she roared with laughter. She laughed for quite some time before she pointed at him, “That’s not wrong at all. The right birth is very important! Haha!”

A short while later, she gazed ahead, “Natural talent, resources, mentality, and will are actually all important. However, the most important is mentality and will. If a person doesn’t have sufficient natural talent but possesses good mentality and strong will, then that person won’t be ordinary in the end. But if the person’s mentality is bad and has insufficient will, that person may be mediocre in the end. It’s mostly your will and mentality that allowed you to get this far. As for your natural talent, it can’t be described as being really trash, but it’s absolutely not good.”

Yang Ye asked, “What are you trying to say?”

Nanli Meng smiled, “I’m trying to say that we may be lucky. The Primal Emperor definitely didn’t leave this will here for no reason. He definitely plans to leave behind his inheritance or something else. So, if we get to him, we’ll get it.”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “Perhaps he wants to seize a new body? He left a strand of his soul behind to wait for someone fated to have their body taken by him!”

He'd encountered that on many occasions!

Nanli Meng chuckled, “Then we have bad luck!”

Yang Ye shook his head and didn’t speak further.

They continued forward, and it grew more and more strenuous. However, they still didn’t stop.

A long time passed before they saw some corpses. However, they didn’t see the woman’s husband. Meanwhile, both of them found it quite difficult to continue forward.

Around an hour later, they suddenly stopped because the pressure had vanished.

They heaved sighs of relief!

Yang Ye suddenly looked up, and a middle aged man was standing there. His hands were behind his back, and he was looking up into the sky, but his eyes were dim.

There was a bloody hole on his chest, and a pitch black spear was stabbed into the ground a short distance away from him.

This spear was exactly like the spear which had been in Nan Yu’s body earlier!
