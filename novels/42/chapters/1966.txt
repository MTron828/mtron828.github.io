Chapter 1967 – I’ll Protect You!

Instinct!

After he comprehended the essence of countless sword techniques, Yang Ye always engaged in self-reflection before he drew his sword.

If he did it in this way, it would have too many flaws!

It forced him to change his attacks!

At this moment, Yang Ye finally understood some things.

What did his Sword Dao lack?

It was too monotonous!

While he’d successfully simplified his Sword Dao, and made it even sharper and stronger, it was too monotonous. It was naturally because he hadn’t seen many sword techniques. But now that he’d gained these sword techniques from the old man in Daoist’s robes, Yang Ye had clearly leaped out of the well and saw the boundless starry sky that stretched to infinity!

Every single sword technique represented a person’s Sword Dao!

In the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye sat cross-legged on a huge rock, and he just sat there for six hours.

A long time passed before Yang Ye opened his eyes, and there was a slightly bitter smile on his lips.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing appeared in front of Yang Ye.

Hou Qing asked, “What is it?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I want to create my own sword technique through these techniques, but I noticed that I’m not worthy of creating anything.”

Hou Qing asked, “What do you mean?”

Yang Ye stood up, “Every one of those sword techniques were extremely powerful, and every one of them has their own advantage… Simply speaking, I don't have the confidence to create something better than these sword techniques!”

“Isn’t that normal?” Hou Qing continued, “Which powerful sword technique wasn’t created through painstaking effort? You’re too impatient for success!”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing continued. “Besides that, why insist on creating a sword technique? Sword techniques are like comprehending the Dao, you suddenly get a stroke of inspiration, and then it’ll be created. If you try to create it by force, it may cause it to never be created instead!”

Forcing it!

Yang Ye suddenly understood everything when he heard that.

He’d really been trying too hard in the last two days. Creating sword techniques had always been something that needed inspiration.

Once he figured it out, Yang Ye wasn’t depressed anymore.

He continued his studies!

Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground, and he recalled all the sword techniques. Every time he felt that there was something lacking, he would modify the techniques. Just like that, time trickled by again, and another year passed in the Primordial Pagoda!

Yang Ye did just two things throughout this year.

He studied sword techniques and spent time with Su Qingshi and the others.

Sky Residence City.

Qin Chuan pointed at Yang Ye and asked Yu Jing, “How long more until that fellow wakes up?”

Yu Jing shrugged, “Who knows? That fellow has been sitting there for more than two months. What is he doing?”

Qin Chuan replied, “Didn’t Big Sis say that he may be comprehending something?”

Qin Chuan puckered his lips and continued, “I think he’s probably just lazy because he doesn’t have to take the night watch if he does this.”

Yu Jing roared with laughter.

Suddenly, Qin Chuan said, “He’s awake!”

Yu Jing gazed at Yang Ye, and he saw Yang Ye standing up slowly. Meanwhile, some of the others gazed at Yang Ye as well.

They were curious!

Yang Ye had been meditating for a very long time.

Yang Ye suddenly gazed at Qin Chuan and said, “Come! Let’s fight one on one!”

One on one!

Everyone here was stunned.

Qin Chuan blinked, “Did you go mad while you were cultivating?”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

A ray of light flashed!

A sword shot towards Qin Chuan’s forehead.

As soon as Yang Ye swung his sword, A’Man, Mad Saber, and Ling opened their eyes.

There was a trace of solemness in their eyes.

Yang Ye’s sudden attack caused Qin Chuan’s expression to change, but his reaction wasn’t slow at all, and he was about to attack.

However, his eyes suddenly opened wide!

Because Yang Ye’s attack actually made him feel like he didn’t know how to counterattack! At this moment, Yang Ye’s attack made him feel like no matter what he did, he couldn’t dodge or destroy it.

It went straight for the heart!

Yang Ye’s sword stopped just a few inches away from Qin Chuan’s forehead!

Qin Chuan looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Why?”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “I don’t know either!”

Qin Chuan felt speechless.

“The Heart Sword!” Meanwhile, Ling spoke abruptly, “According to rumor, powerful sword saints can strike straight at the heart. Their swords can destroy mountains, break rivers, destroy the sky, obliterate the earth, and… crack the heart!”

“Crack the heart?” Yang Ye gazed at Ling, “What do you mean?”

Ling shook his head slightly, “It’s a very profound thing. Even I merely heard of it. Simply speaking, it cracks a person’s Dao Heart. It cracks a person’s Dao Heart and makes a person doubt themselves. Formidable sword cultivators can even destroy the Dao Heart with a single strike, causing a person to be unable to improve further in their cultivation. However, you’re clearly not at that level yet, but it’s still amazing!”

Crack the heart!

Yang Ye fell into deep thought.

That attack hadn’t been Split Second or Heavenrend, and he hadn’t used the Sword Domain. It was just a simple attack, but even he’d sensed it. That attack wasn’t ordinary at all!

But he really didn’t know what had happened to it.

“I saw many shadows!” Suddenly, Mad Saber spoke.

Everyone gazed at him, and he glanced at Yang Ye, “Your attack contained many shadows. If I’m not wrong, they should all be sword techniques. You fused them together. You should have fused many sword techniques together!”

Yang Ye gazed at Mad Saber, He really is extraordinary! He guessed almost everything with just a glance!

“That’s enough!” Meanwhile, A’Man suddenly stepped forward and glanced at everyone, “I’m going to Southern Qilin Mountain, and I’m taking two people with me. Yang Ye, Mad Saber, and Ling. Which two of you want to come with me?”

Qin Chuan asked, “We don’t have immortal crystals anymore?”

A’Man replied, “That’s one of the reasons. The second is that it’s time for these three fellows to see Southern Qilin Mountain for themselves.”

Mad Saber said, “You make the decision!”

A'Man nodded slightly, “Mad Saber, you guard Sky Residence City, Yang Ye and Ling will come with me. Remember that you must not rashly leave the city and be ready to activate the grand formation at a moment’s notice. Notify me if anything happens. Understand?”

Mad Saber nodded, “Be careful!”

A'Man gazed at Yang Ye and Ling, “Let’s go!”

She vanished into the sky once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye and Ling immediately followed her.

High above in the clouds, A’Man had her hands behind her back while Yang Ye and Ling followed by her side.

A’Man spoke abruptly, “Southern Qilin Mountain is at the border between the outside world and Hell Mountain Range. The top of that place is occupied by some formidable demon beasts and mysterious experts because there’s spirit energy there. Even if it’s quite scarce, it’s still extremely precious in this place.”

Yang Ye asked, “Is it very dangerous?”

A'Man nodded, “Very dangerous. Attain Dao Realm experts have been seen there. Just the aura from such experts is sufficient to annihilate us!”

A’Man glanced at Yang Ye and Ling, “Sky Residence City has the extraordinary geniuses of the various races, but they are like children standing before adults when they face those terrifying fellows on Southern Qilin Mountain. It isn’t because their natural talent is inferior to those fellows, it’s because those kids aren’t as ruthless!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “Ruthless?”

A’Man nodded, “They’re extremely ruthless. For the sake of fighting for some immortal crystals or spirit energy, those fellows act absolutely ruthlessly. As for those who aren’t ruthless enough, it’s impossible for them to survive there.”

She gazed at Yang Ye at this point, “Do you know why I wanted to give Sky Residence City to you? Or perhaps, I should say, do you know why I thought so highly of you?”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

“Ruthlessness!” A’Man looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Your strength isn’t even the most important point, the true reason I think highly of you is because you have an aura of ruthlessness. It can be said that no one in Sky Residence City is more ruthless than you, and it’s something that I’ve only seen present in those monsters on Eastern Qilin Mountain.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

A’Man continued, “Ling and Mad Saber are strong, but both of them aren’t ruthless enough. If they were alone, their strength would be enough to survive in this place without facing any difficulty. However, if they are tasked with leading those fellows, then those fellows would be in danger!”

Ling fell silent. Obviously, he agreed with A’Man.

A’Man gazed at Yang Ye, “The human race has 10 paradises, 3 holy grounds, the Shaman Hunter Clan, and the mysterious Divine Strategy Estate. Which one are you from?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “None of them!”

A’Man asked, “You’re really an independent cultivator?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Sort of!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Ling glanced at Yang Ye with surprise.

Meanwhile, A’Man asked, “How did you get here?”

Yang Ye spoke with a helpless tone in his voice, “I was forced to come here!”

A’Man asked, “Who forced you?”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and replied, “Big Sis, I’ll just be honest. The people who forced me include the human race, devil race, demon race, sky race, barbarian race, shaman race… In short, every fucking race.”

A’Man and Ling were stunned.

A long time passed, and when she noticed that Yang Ye didn’t seem like he was lying, she spoke solemnly, “What did you do to make all the races want to kill you? Moreover, even the human race wants to kill you?!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “It hurts to even think about it! In any case, sigh… It fills me with so much despair!”

Suddenly, A’Man patted Yang Ye on the shoulder, “It’s fine. If we can get out of here, I’ll protect you!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
