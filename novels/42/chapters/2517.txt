Chapter 2518 – I Refuse!

Xing Biqing and Ye Zhibei were naturally unaware of what Yang Ye was thinking. Otherwise, they would definitely roll their eyes at him!

Xing Biqing suddenly asked, “Are three Origin World Pills not enough for you?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “They really aren’t.”

She asked, “How many more do you need?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Three!”

He had 6 peak Four World Realm demons in the Primordial Pagoda!

Three more!

Xing Biqing was put in quite a difficult position. If it was lesser, she could lend him some World Crystals, but three were around 1,000 World Crystals, and that really was too much.

As if he knew what she was thinking, Yang Ye smiled, “Miss Biqing, don’t worry about it. If it’s three, then three. They are enough for now.”

She flicked a spatial ring over to Yang Ye.

She wasn’t the only one, Ye Zhibei did the same as well.

There were exactly 1,000 World Crystals in total between the two spatial rings!

Yang Ye was stunned, “Huh?”

Xing Biqing said, “Consider it a loan, so you must return them. Both of us are successors in our clans, so we have some authority to use a portion of the clan’s resources. However, even we have to return what we take.”

Xing Biqing laughed bitterly, “A month. If we can’t return it in a month, we will be punished according to the rules of the clan!”

Yang Ye shook his head, and then he passed the spatial rings back to them, “Three are enough for me right now. I can’t put you in such a difficult position!”

Xing Biqing smiled, “It will be alright if you return them to us in a month!”

One month!

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. If Snowy was here, then it wouldn’t be very difficult to accomplish that, but Snowy wasn’t here! Without Snowy, besides stealing, he really didn’t have another way to earn 1,000 World Crystals in a month! Even if he stole, he may not be able to steal that much!

Meanwhile, Ye Zhibei suddenly said, “Just use it first and think about it later.”

Xing Biqing nodded, “Get the Origin World Pills first!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and nodded. He’d decided that if he really couldn’t get enough World Crystals, he would pay with a fruit!

In any case, he had many of them, and Snowy could grow more!

They went to the old man again, and Xing Biqing said, “Six Origin World Pills! We’ll make the deal if you have the goods!”

Six!

The old man looked up slightly, fell silent for quite a while, and then said, “Show me!”

Xing Biqing gazed at Yang Ye, and the latter withdrew three spatial rings. There were around 2,000 World Crystals there! Needless to say, it was a huge amount of wealth!

The old man said, “Wait a moment!”

He turned around and left!

Yang Ye put the spatial rings away and glanced at the surroundings, “Is it safe?”

Xing Biqing replied, “It is!”

Yang Ye was quite surprised, “Are you that sure?”

She smiled, “No one has ever broken the rules here!”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Perhaps it has been broken, but the people who know of it are dead?”

Xing Biqing and Ye Zhibei frowned slightly.

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m not just letting my thoughts run wild. It’s just that years of cruel experience has told me that there is no such thing as absolute rules. Even if rules exist, it’s built upon the fact that both sides possess equivalent strength. If there is no balance in strength, do you think a tiger would care about rules with a goat?”

Xing Biqing fell silent for a long time and said, “Then let’s see if rules exist here!”

Yang Ye nodded.

He always prepared for the worst. Only by doing that could he avoid being taken by surprise, and he would never be disappointed!

Time trickled by. Around an hour passed, and fewer and fewer people remained on the streets. Another hour passed, and there were no people left. Only two black robed figures remained behind their stalls.

Another few breaths of time passed, and then one of the black robed figures waved his right hand. He seemed to have put something away, and then he left satisfied.

Only a single black robed figure remained!

Xing Biqing and Ye Zhibei’s faces were gloomy, and no one knew what they were thinking.

Yang Ye smiled and remained silent.

There was kindness in this world, but there was usually more evil!

Meanwhile, the hunched black robed figure appeared before them.

Xing Biqing and Ye Zhibei became vigilant and were ready to act at any moment!

Suddenly, the hunched man flicked a spatial ring to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at it, and then asked Xing Biqing to have a look. She nodded slightly, “There’s six of them!”

Yang Ye glanced at the hunched man and flicked the three spatial rings over.

The hunched man didn’t say anything. He just glanced at them and put them away.

Yang Ye smiled and gazed at Xing Biqing, “Let’s go!”

Suddenly, an invisible barrier appeared in the surroundings, and then it locked down the entire street.

Yang Ye chuckled when he saw this.

Xing Biqing and Ye Zhibei’s faces turned utterly gloomy at the sight of this.

Obviously, someone planned to break the rules.

Xing Biqing gazed at the hunched man, “What? You plan to break the rules?”

The hunched man replied indifferently, “We made a fair trade. Did I break any rules?”

Xing Biqing spoke coldly, “Then what’s all of this?”

The hunched man shook his head, “This has nothing to do with me. It’s your problem!”

Xing Biqing spoke solemnly, “This is your territory, yet it’s not your business? Are you joking?”

The hunched man replied indifferently, “It is our territory, but it’s dawn right now. Anything that happens here is none of our business during this period!”

Yang Ye gazed at Xing Biqing, “Is that true?”

Xing Biqing had an extremely unsightly expression beneath her robe. She’d actually forgotten about this. There was a rule here that it was closed at dawn, just like the stores in the outside world which had rest times!

But it still didn’t make sense. Because those people on the streets hadn’t left when it was time for the place to close, they had left in advance. They had left more than an hour in advance. So, someone was clearly clearing the area! Moreover, the old man had intentionally delayed until now, so it was obvious something was off!

Xing Biqing fell silent for a short while and gazed at Yang Ye, “You’re correct!”

Yang Ye chuckled and glanced at the surroundings. A black robed man was still seated cross-legged nearby. Yang Ye ignored the man and said, “Six Origin World Pills is a huge amount of wealth.”

He waved his hand, and the ring they were in appeared in front of him.

Yang Ye pointed at the ring, “They are right here! Come get them!”

“Alright, I’m coming!” A voice resounded from the shadows, and then a black robed man with a pear appeared before them.

A peak Five World Realm expert!

He wasn’t alone, and there were two other black robed men behind him.

All of them were peak Five World Realm experts!

As soon as he finished speaking, the man’s spear shot straight at Yang Ye.

It was like a bolt of lightning, and its powerful might shot straight for Yang Ye’s group!

Xing Biqing and Ye Zhibei were about to counterattack when Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot.

A sword howl resounded, and then two flying swords shot by!

Hiss! Hiss!

The flying swords instantly sliced through the pressure created by the spear, and they blasted the spear away as well.

The swords didn’t slow down at all as they instantly arrived before the black robed man!

Suddenly, the man took a step back, and then a black vortex formed in the space before him. The vortex instantly swept both the swords into it!

Meanwhile, a sword suddenly arrived.

Hiss!

It sliced through the black vortex, and the black robed man was even blasted backward.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The swords returned to the Sword Gourd by Yang Ye’s waist, but they shot out again just a moment later.

Hiss! Hiss!

The black robed man with the spear was shocked. At the critical moment, he stretched out his right hand and made a grasping motion. A spear condensed into form there. A moment later, he swept the spear forward!

The sweep emanated an extraordinarily powerful aura that seemed capable of sweeping through an army!

Clang! Clang!

It stopped both of Yang Ye’s swords, but it only took a moment for Yang Ye to appear before him. Meanwhile, Yang Ye grabbed the swords and swung them!

Dual swords!

Yang Ye could use dual swords!

He didn’t want to expose too many trump cards, so he hadn’t utilized the Sword Domain or his bloodline, nor had he used Executor!

His dual swords descended!

Hiss!

The spear was chopped into two, and the black robed man was sliced into three!

Even his soul hadn’t been able to escape!

After he slaughtered the black robed man, Yang Ye didn’t stop. The swords entered the Sword Gourd, and then they shot forward a moment later. The other two black robed men were shocked and about to flee, but the flying swords were even faster than them.

Hiss!

The swords pierced through their foreheads!

All of them were dead!

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and three spatial rings appeared in his grasp. He didn’t look at them and just gazed at the hunched man.

The hunched man was just standing there in silence!

Yang Ye walked slowly toward the hunched man. Suddenly, a powerful aura swept out from the hunched black robed man.

He wasn’t a Five World Realm expert, but he wasn’t at the Lord Realm either. He should be said to be boundlessly close to the Lord Realm, or perhaps, he was suppressing his cultivation!

Xing Biqing and Ye Zhibei went over to Yang Ye’s side, and Xing Biqing shook her head slightly, “Forget it, we haven’t lost anything!”

The hunched black robed man turned around and walked away.

Suddenly, Yang Ye stabbed his sword into the ground.

Boom!

The ground instantly cracked apart!

The hunched man stopped moving!

Yang Ye looked up at the hunched black robed man and laughed fiercely, “Forget it? No! Not at all! I can’t accept this! Since I refuse to accept this, someone will have to pay with his life!”
