Chapter 2119 – We Won’t Back Down!

Meanwhile, Snowy emerged from Yang Ye’s chest.

She glanced at the surroundings and gazed at Yang Ye.

Presently, she understood much more. While she still didn’t understand what Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang were talking about, she knew that there seemed to be trouble.

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head and smiled, “It’ll be fine!”

Snowy nodded, and then she laid quietly in Yang Ye’s arms.

Yang Ye gazed at Yang Lianshuang and smiled, “Looks like I have no choice but to take the blame for this!”

Yang Lianshuang nodded, “Actually, regardless of whether you really did it, they still will come for you.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She rubbed Snowy’s head and continued, “Because of her! The spirit energy in the Human Dimension and Sky Dimension is vanishing rapidly. Just think about it, who do they need to resolve this issue?”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Snowy!”

Yang Lianshuang nodded, “Indeed. So long as they find Snowy, it doesn’t matter how the god race takes their spirit energy because Snowy can restore it all. So, as far as they’re concerned, they must find Snowy. Once they find Snowy, all their problems will be resolved.”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly. He was about to say something when Yang Lianshuang’s expression changed, and she said, “Leave!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

Yang Lianshuang spoke solemnly, “The human race and sky race are aware that you’re in the Human Dimension!”

Yang Ye asked, “How could they possibly know?”

She replied, “You just left the Buddhist Path, so they probably got their information from the Buddhist Path. Stop talking and go!”

Yang Ye said, “What about all of you?”

She replied, “Don’t worry about us. We’ll be in the most danger while you remain here. Once you leave, their attention will be focused on you. So, while it’s a bit cruel to say that, it’s the truth.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. Because he’d planned to spend some time with Su Qingshi and the others.

“Leave!” Yang Lianshuang spoke solemnly, “You won’t be able to leave if they catch you here. You should rush to the Dao Path as soon as possible because you’ll only be safe there.”

Yang Ye nodded, “All of you be careful too. Let me know if anything happens!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took Snowy in his arms and left. He wasn’t a hesitant person, and he knew what the current situation was like.

This time, Yang Ye didn’t leave openly. He used the Sword Domain to conceal his aura completely, and he didn’t use his sword as well. He would be painting a huge target on his back if he used his sword to fly.

In next to no time, Yang Ye left the Human Dimension, and right when he was about to head to the Dao Path, a few powerful auras swept over from behind him.

“Have I been found?” Yang Ye frowned, “Impossible… Was someone lying in ambush at the dimension’s exit?”

Yang Ye didn’t have the time to think. His figure transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the distance. An instant after Yang Ye vanished, countless powerful auras charged up into the sky!

It belonged to at least a dozen Sages!

News that Yang Ye had been sighted in the Human Dimension instantly swept through the large universe like a storm, and practically all the experts of the human race and sky race chased after him.

The spirit energy in the two dimensions was the foundation of those two races. If their spirit energy really vanished, the consequences would definitely not be something the two races could endure. Once the spirit energy vanished, their races may vanish from the history of the large universe.

So, they urgently wanted to find a Sprite Lord, and Yang Ye just happened to have one!

This time, Yang Ye knew that the situation was serious. So, he didn’t choose to fight them, nor could he fight them. After all, there were at least 15 Sages behind him, and more and more were arriving incessantly.

Flee!

As far as he was concerned, he had to flee to the Dao Path as soon as possible.

As for the Confucianist Path, he could forget about it for now.

Yang Ye shot through the boundless starry sky on his sword. Presently, he’d raised his speed to its limits, and it could be said that even a Sage couldn’t catch up to him in a short while.

Suddenly, a ray of light shot towards Yang Ye like a shooting star!

Another Sage!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He couldn’t afford to let that Sage stop him. If he stopped now, he would definitely get surrounded. So, Yang Ye immediately issued a command, and Judgment appeared before him. An instant later, it shook violently, and then it transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the distance.

In an instant, the entire world around him turned ethereal.

It was absolutely powerful!

When Yang Ye’s sword energy and the ray of light slammed against each other, two types of powerful energy instantly swept towards the surroundings, causing space in a huge area to be obliterated. Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s figure didn’t slow down at all, nor did he continue fighting. He just transformed into a ray of light that vanished from the black hole.

At the same instant that Yang Ye vanished, almost 20 Sages appeared in the black hole here. They were led by the Sovereign of Man and Sovereign of Sky, and both of them had quite unsightly expressions on their faces.

The Sovereign of Man spoke solemnly, “I didn’t expect his strength to have grown to such an extent!”

The Sovereign of Sky said, “If this continues, he’ll probably grow even stronger.”

The Sovereign of Man gazed at the Sovereign of Sky, “That’s not what we should be worrying about right now. The Sprite Lord is with him, and we must get it and make it restore our spirit energy. Otherwise, the god race won’t even have to attack us before we fall into chaos on our own.”

The Sovereign of Sky fell silent for a short while and said, “Are we still unable to locate the god race?”

The Sovereign of Man shook his head, “It’s like they vanished from the large universe. If I’m not wrong, they should have been planning all of this for a very long time, and they’ve made sufficient preparations for many things. Now that the four paths refuse to interfere, all of our races…”

He didn’t continue speaking.

The Sovereign of Sky said, “The four paths are probably not interfering because they’re afraid of something, and the god race won’t go after them either. Our races and all of the other races are probably doomed!”

The Sovereign of Man said, “If all the races truly come together, then dealing with a god race that has suffered decline is not a huge problem. However, I’m afraid that the god race will crush us one by one. Both of us understand this, and the other races understand it too. All we lack is someone to take the lead.”

He looked up at the sky and continued, “The four paths can’t be relied on. We can only rely on ourselves.”

The Sovereign of Sky asked, “Do you have any ideas?”

The Sovereign of Man replied, “I have a plan, but let’s discuss that later. Let’s talk about the issue in front of us. He has fled to the Dao Path, and the Dao Path has acknowledged his identity, so I’m afraid…”

The Sovereign of Sky fell silent for a short while, and then he said, “That’s easy to resolve. Can’t we just make the Dao Path hand over Yang Ye and that Sprite Lord?”

The Sovereign of Man asked, “Will they?”

The Sovereign of Sky replied, “Yes. So long as all the races join forces, then the Dao Path definitely will. We can’t just stay quiet at a time like this. Because we’re at the moment of life and death. If we don’t stand up for ourselves now, we probably won’t have another chance. So, summon all the races to the Dao Path!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the Sovereign of Sky vanished into the distance.

Everyone vanished with him.

Around two hours later.

All the patriarchs of the races had gathered in the Human Dimension.

In a grand hall, the Sovereign of Man stepped forward, “Everyone, the god race has acted against my human race and the sky race, but I can guarantee that all of you’ll be their next target. I think all of you have realized that. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have come here immediately. So, I’ll get straight to the point. All of our races must truly unite as one, I’m talking about truly forming a united front against others. An alliance where all of us support anyone in need!”

He glanced at the others here, “I know that all the races here have enmity with each other, but I’m sure you realize what kind of situation we’re in. You should be aware that if we don’t join forces now, then wouldn’t all of that enmity be meaningless if we’re going to be annihilated? So, we must put aside all the enmity between us and form a united front. We can’t rely on the four paths, and we can only rely on ourselves. Do any of you have an objection?”

The hall remained silent.

A short while passed before an old man stepped forward, “Sovereign of Man, we naturally understand what you mean. However, I think that we still lack something. For example, if some races risk their lives in battle while others scheming against them from behind, what would we do about that? I’m not trying to cause trouble, but it must be brought up and figured out. Otherwise, just a small incident may cause the destruction of our entire alliance!”

The Sovereign of Man glanced at the old man, “Elder Ning, you’re absolutely right. We must have rules, and we need a leader. We’ll choose our leader together, and all our races must do all we can to obey that person’s orders. Of course, we’ll have a Council of Elders too, and the council’s members will be the patriarchs of all the races. If the Council of Elders is dissatisfied with the leader, they can force him to vacate his position. What do all of you think?”

They exchanged glances, and they had no objections in the end.

The Sovereign of Man grinned, “Then, let’s select the leader.”

The game had begun!

Two hours later, the outcome had been decided.

It was the Sovereign of Sky who became the leader.

Because based on the current circumstances, the sky race could be considered as the strongest amongst all the races.

The strong were respected, so it was within expectations that the Sovereign of Sky would be selected.

The Sovereign of Sky stepped forward, glanced at the surroundings, and said, “I’ll just get straight to the point. Let’s go to the Dao Path now. We won’t back down unless the Dao Path hands over Yang Ye.”

“We won’t back down!”

Their voices resounded like a thunderclap!Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com
