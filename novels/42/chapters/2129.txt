Chapter 2130 – The Confucianist Dimension!

He couldn’t take it!

He absolutely couldn’t!

It wasn’t that the brush wasn’t good enough, it was that Yang Ye knew he would have a huge amount of trouble to deal with if he accepted it. It would absolutely not be any ordinary trouble either. So, he’d decisively chosen to refuse.

The Confucianist Progenitor sighed softly, “I see you understand everything well!”

Yang Ye said, “Senior, I don’t know what happened here, but I believe that no matter what it was, it isn’t something I can interfere in. That brush is very good, but I don’t think I can stay alive long enough to use it!”

The Confucianist Progenitor nodded slightly, “That is true.”

He paused for a moment and said, “Young Brother, I won’t force you. How about this? You help me with something, just something small.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Senior, tell me about it first.”

The Confucianist Progenitor nodded, “The Confucianist Path in the Confucianist Dimension is gone, but it doesn’t mean that my Confucianist Path is completely annihilated. There’s a child in one of the three sacred grounds of the human race, Nature Sacred Grounds. The child is called Lin Shuya. Young Brother, can you give this to him?”

Yang Ye glanced at the Confucianist Progenitor, and the latter smiled, “I’m sure you’re wondering why I’m not going there myself, right?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The Confucianist Progenitor smiled, “If I go there, that child’s life will probably never be peaceful again. Moreover, I can’t go anywhere right now!”

Yang Ye gazed at the Confucianist Progenitor with bewilderment, “Huh?”

The latter shook his head slightly, “There are some things that won’t benefit you at all if you find out about them now.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Then I won’t ask.”

He grabbed the brush as he spoke, but he noticed that he couldn’t move it at all.

Yang Ye gazed at the Confucianist Progenitor.

The old man smiled, “Only someone with a sufficiently strong scholarly aura can obtain its acknowledgment and pick it up.”

Yang Ye shrugged, “Obviously, it doesn’t acknowledge me.”

The Confucianist Progenitor said, “That’s very normal. Just like how your sword would never acknowledge me, right?”

As he spoke, he tapped forward, and the brush entered the Primordial Pagoda.

The Confucianist Progenitor said, “Only that treasure within you can endure its strength.

As he spoke, he suddenly tapped Yang Ye’s forehead. In an instant, a wave of energy entered Yang Ye’s forehead.

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What’s that?”

The Confucianist Progenitor explained, “My scholarly energy. I noticed that your body has some flaws, so I plan to help you mend them. My energy will ceaselessly perfect your body. While it can’t help your body rise a level higher, it’s very suitable for you right now. Besides that, it has other advantages that you can slowly explore in the future.”

Suddenly, Yang Ye asked, “Senior, are you gone?”

The old man smiled, “You’re really quite curious!”

His smile gradually vanished, “No, but I’m on the verge of it. Young Brother, the large universe’s future…”

He didn’t continue speaking at this point.

Yang Ye wanted to ask more, but the old man’s figure gradually turned ethereal.

When he was about to vanish completely, he glanced at the corpses of those dead Sages and spoke softly, “Some things can be done, some can’t…”

Some things can be done, some can’t? Yang Ye frowned. What does he mean by that?

However, Yang Ye didn’t get an answer because the Confucianist Progenitor had vanished completely.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and left slowly.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Snowy sized up the Scholarly Sage Brush with curiosity and frequently touched it. The brush didn’t refuse her and even took the initiative to get close to Snowy!

Yang Ye laughed bitterly and shook his head at the sight of this. Snowy was truly blessed by nature. As far as he knew, anything with a consciousness of its own liked Snowy, even the Sword Supreme’s spirit.

However, it was normal because staying with Snowy represented an endless supply of spirit energy. Moreover, Snowy was pure and kind, and she had no ill intent towards anyone. So, they were naturally fond of getting close to her.

Yang Ye returned to the outside world, glanced at the surroundings, and then vanished on the spot.

Not long after Yang Ye left, the entire hall and city turned ethereal, and then they just vanished without making a sound.

At this point, the Confucianist Path could be said to have vanished to a certain extent.

Now, it was like a dark cloud was above the large universe, and it made everyone’s hearts feel heavy.

After this incident, the other races’ alliance grew even stronger. Now, they were extremely united and truly united to the point of supporting any member in trouble. Because they felt threatened!

Besides that, the other three paths didn’t leave their dimensions as well.

A storm was coming to the large universe!

After he left the Confucianist Dimension, Yang Ye received a transmission from Yang Lianshuang.

She said, “Did you find out anything?”

Yang Ye replied, “Nothing much. Why? Were you unable to find out anything too?”

“Yes!” Yang Lianshuang spoke solemnly, “I’m unable to investigate it at all. There wasn’t even a trace left behind, not even a tiny one. It’s absolutely not something any single organization could accomplish. Even if the other three paths joined forces, it would be impossible to annihilate the Confucianist Path. At the very least, it would be impossible to accomplish it without making a single sound. However, there had been no news until after it was annihilated.”

Yang Ye asked, “Who was the first to find out that the Confucianist Path had been destroyed?”

She replied, “I don’t know.”

Yang Lianshuang’s voice sounded serious at this point, “This incident isn’t that simple. According to my inference, there’s probably another mysterious organization besides the god race, and they are probably the most terrifying of them all!”

Yang Ye said, “I’ll go ask the god race. Perhaps they know something.”

“That’s what I was thinking!” She continued, “Right, can I trust the god race?”

“Yes!” Yang Ye continued, “Why?”

Yang Lianshuang replied, “It’s nothing. I just want to work together with them in terms of expanding our information network.”

“No!” Yang Ye continued, “Lianshuang, I know you have ambition, but it’s best to lay low as much as we can right now. The safety of all of you is the most important thing to me, understand?”

She really didn’t want her to be swept into the conflict between the god race and the Alliance of All.

Yang Lianshuang fell silent for a long time, and then she said, “I understand. Don’t worry, I’ll be careful. Right, I’ve contacted those fellows from the Nether Pavilion!”

The Nether Pavilion!

Yang Ye had naturally not forgotten them!

Yang Ye asked, “Where are they?”

Yang Lianshuang chuckled, “In a place you don’t know. Moreover, they are all at the Major Zen Realm. They can even kill Sages with ease once they join forces.”

Yang Ye had a smile on his face. Every single one of them possessed extremely formidable natural talent. But when the Nether Pavilion was mentioned, it made him think of a person, Shao Siyou, its hall master, and he wondered if she was still alive.

“There’s one other person!” Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang said, “An Nanjing! You still remember her, right?”

Yang Ye replied, “Of course!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“She’s at Martial Emperor Academy!” Yang Lianshuang continued, “According to my knowledge, her status there is pretty high. Or I should say that she’s the number one senior sister in its younger generation!”

Number one!

Yang Ye couldn’t help but grin. An Nanjing had always possessed the greatest natural talent amongst everyone he knew. If he hadn’t possessed a set of divine treasures, he would really not be confident in being able to defeat An Nanjing in a one on one battle. An Nanjing’s instinct in combat and technique were the best he’d ever seen amongst the younger generation!

“There’s one more person!” Suddenly, Yang Lianshuang added, “There’s a woman looking for you. She has been searching through many worlds for you!”

“Searching for me? A woman?” Yang Ye frowned, “Who?”

Yang Lianshuang smiled, “Someone who possesses terrifying natural talent in the Sword Dao. According to my knowledge, she’s only in the Zen Realm right now, but she can fight Sages.”

“A woman? A sword cultivator?” Yang Ye thought for a moment. But besides Lu Wan’er and Su Qingshi, he couldn’t think of any other woman who was good at the sword. But they were definitely not the person Yang Lianshuang was speaking about.

Yang Ye was about to ask her for more information when she said, “Let me keep it a surprise for you. I’ve been secretly drawing her over here. I believe it won’t take long for her to arrive here. You just be careful. Besides that, don’t forget to tell me if you find out about anything from the god race!”

As soon as she finished speaking, he cut off the communication with Yang Ye.

Yang Ye puckered his lips, “Sigh!”

Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

God Battlefield.

Yang Ye arrived at God Battlefield again, and then he went to the underground city. He met that demon beast at the city, the Royal Crocodile. It was just lying before the city like a small mountain.

When it saw Yang Ye, it merely glanced at him and closed its eyes.

Presently, Yang Ye was quite close to the god race.

Yang Ye entered the city and went to Ding Shaoyao’s residence. As expected, he found her here.

Ding Shaoyao asked, “You’re here because of the Confucianist Path?”

Yang Ye nodded, “You should have heard about it too. So, do you have any leads?”

Ding Shaoyao replied, “A little.”

A little!

Yang Ye couldn’t help but glance at her. The god race’s ability was much greater than he’d ever imagined!

“Right!” Suddenly, she said, “Ask Lianshuang to keep a low profile. Her organization is growing too quickly, and the three paths have started to notice her!”

Yang Ye gazed at Ding Shaoyao and asked curiously, “You know Lianshuang?”

Ding Shaoyao grinned, “I met her in the medium universe.”

I see! Yang Ye nodded, “I understand!”

Ding Shaoyao waved her hand. In an instant, a crystal blue screen of light appeared before them, and it was the Confucianist Dimension.

At this moment, it was in a peaceful state.

Yang Ye stared at it.

Around ten breaths of time later, Yang Ye’s eyes suddenly opened wide, “How can this be… How can this be…”
