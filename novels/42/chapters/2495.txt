Chapter 2496 – Busybody!

Yang Ye?

The others were stunned when they heard her. But it didn’t take long for the leader of their group, the man with a saber by his waist, to shake his head, “Lian An, do you think he’s Yang Ye?”

The woman called Lian An replied indifferently, “I was just saying that randomly! However, it’s not impossible. Everything is possible, right?”

The man in the lead smiled, “Yang Ye is a sword cultivator, but according to the information I received, he’s only in the True Void Realm. Moreover, he has the number one sword in our universe, Executor! But this guy is at the Limitbreaker Realm. While I haven’t seen his sword, but I don’t think he is Yang Ye. Moreover, no matter how arrogant and confident Yang Ye is, it’s very unlikely that he would just enter our Eternal Kingdom and Wat Dimension, right?”

Lian An glanced at Yang Ye’s group, “Boring.”

She turned around and left.

The man who led the group shook his head and smiled. Meanwhile, the other man spoke abruptly, “Mo Yu, did the higher-ups reduce the requirements for recruitment because the war is finally coming?”

Mo Yu shook his head and smiled, “Who knows? Come on, let’s go take a look at the so-called geniuses from those clans. Let’s see how strong they really are!”

They turned around and left.

Yang Ye and the others were still in battle.

But in actuality, they were being beaten up!

It wasn’t just Mo Ya and the others, even Yang Ye was being completely crushed by those peak Four World Realm demon beasts.

They had no chance to win!

The worst was Yang Ye because he was going head-on against them with just his body. If he didn’t have the Primordial Pagoda to ceaselessly repair his body, he would have died a long time ago!

Now, his body was like a piece of metal that was being struck and tempered incessantly before being repaired.

Under such circumstances, Yang Ye’s body had started to undergo some sort of change.

However, it was a change that came at the cost of risking his life!

Suddenly, Sword Scroll’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “You can’t delay any longer! They can’t hold on!”

Yang Ye glanced at Mo Ya and the others. At this moment, they were covered in injuries and were being completely suppressed!

They were top experts in the inner court of the Ancient Sword Sect, but their attacks weren’t able to cause any material harm to these demon beasts. After all, these demon beasts far surpassed them in cultivation!

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment, and then he looked up at the demon beasts and roared.

A strand of faint dragon pressure rippled out from him!

Dragon pressure!

Yang Ye had consumed a Dragon Ball in the past, so he naturally had some dragon pressure. But…

The demons were stunned for a moment when they sensed the pressure, but it didn’t take long for them to charge at Yang Ye again. The dragon pressure was too weak!

Yang Ye was quite embarrassed by this. A moment later, he said, “Dragon, come out here for a moment. Make yourself smaller, around Erya’s size!”

A moment later, the dragon appeared before him. It was around Erya’s size. It looked up at those demons and roars.

A strand of dragon pressure rippled out!

This dragon pressure was true dragon pressure, and it wasn’t weak like Yang Ye’s!

The powerful dragon pressure the Primal True Dragon emanated forced all three demon beasts to a stop in front of Yang Ye!

The dragon gazed coldly at them. Throughout its entire lifetime, it had only been beaten up by Erya, or it should be said that it feared no one except Erya. Of course, that was only limited to demon beasts, and these demon beasts before it were absolutely beneath it!

The demon beasts glanced at the Primal True Dragon with a solemn expression in their eyes, but it didn’t take long for them to charge at the dragon!

Yang Ye was quite amused by this, “Dragon, you don’t seem strong enough, huh?”

The dragon instantly had a ferocious expression on its face, and then it charged at them.

Bang!

One of the demon beasts was slammed away!

And its body actually cracked open in midair!

Meanwhile, the other two slammed against the dragon, but they were blasted away instead!

While they were all Four World Realm demon beasts, the dragon’s combat strength was even enough to go against Five World Realm experts. Moreover, it had been tempered by the Darkvoid Divine Lightning, so its body was only inferior to an existence like Erya. It could be said that its body wasn’t something any ordinary demon could resist!

The dragon didn’t stop. It charged at the three demon beasts, causing their expressions to change drastically. At this moment, their minds had finally cleared up, and so they immediately turned around and fled!

The dragon wanted to give chase, but Yang Ye stopped it.

The Primal True Dragon nodded, and then gazed at the other demon beasts. They sensed its gaze and looked toward it. At the same time, the dragon roared.

Bang!

A wave of powerful dragon pressure rippled out!

The demons retreated and were extremely afraid when they sensed the dragon pressure.

The dragon was about to charge at them when all of them took a deep and long glance at the Primal True Dragon, and then they turned around and left.

Dragon pressure!

One of the living beings that were at the top of the pyramid among demon beasts!

They couldn’t afford to offend the dragon!

Obviously, they had guessed its identity, and so they’d retreated. The Primal True Dragons had such a right! Not all demon beasts dared to eat dragons like Erya!

The dragon had succeeded at driving them away!

Meanwhile, Mo Ya and the others gazed at the dragon, but the dragon ignored them and just returned to the Primordial Pagoda.

They gazed at Yang Ye, and Yang Ye said, “Recuperate first!”

They nodded and didn’t ask. They were all adults, so they would naturally not ask if Yang Ye didn’t say anything.

Yang Ye recuperated very quickly. It only took him a while to heal. Besides that, something worth mentioning was that he sensed that his body was at the border of breakthrough! It was about to advance further!

It just needed a little more!

Yang Ye shook his head and sighed. If he’d been able to continue fighting for a while longer, he would have succeeded at attaining the Two World Realm in the body. However, if he did that, the others would probably have died here!

A short while later, Yang Ye looked into the distance, “Allow me to be honest, this place is quite dangerous indeed.”

Xue Yiren shook his head, “Of course it is. But we have no way out now, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “True. Anyway, just be careful!”

The others nodded.

An hour later, they set off again. While they couldn’t fly all the way, it would only take two to three days at their speed of walking.

Of course, the precondition was that no demons stopped them on the way!

Mo Ya suddenly walked over to Yang Ye and asked, “Brother Ye, was that a dragon?”

Yang Ye glanced at her, and she smiled brilliantly, “I’ve seen a dragon, and it felt like a dragon to me!”

A dragon!

Actually, practically all of them had never seen a Primal True Dragon. Not to mention them, even the seniors of the Ancient Sword Sect had probably never seen a real Primal True Dragon.

Yang Ye said, “I think you should focus on how to survive! That’s most important, isn’t it?”

Mo Ya smiled and didn’t pursue an answer.

However, Yang Ye seemed quite mysterious to them now!

Yang Ye looked up into the distance as he thought to himself. War City should be the central area of the War Dimension, right? I should be able to witness their overall strength there, right?

After all, up until this point, War Dimension did seem quite extraordinary!

What about the desolate race?

While he hadn’t really witnessed the desolate race’s full strength, he knew they weren’t ordinary either! So, a war between them would definitely be extremely terrifying.

A short while later, Yang Ye shook his head and smiled. He felt that he should worry more about himself instead!

As for the desolate race and Eternal Kingdom, they could do as they please!

Around two hours later, the sound of battle came from afar.

Yang Ye and the others exchanged glances. In the end, Xue Yiren said, “Shall have a look?”𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright!”

They sped up, and it didn’t take long for them to see a group of three men fighting a group of demon beasts on a plain. The demon beasts were the same demon beasts that had attacked Yang Ye’s group!

They exchanged glances because it was such a coincidence!

Mo Ya suddenly asked, “Should we help?”

Xue Yiren gazed at Yang Ye, “Brother Ye, what do you think?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Let’s help. They should be from somewhere else too and are here with the same objective as us.”

Xue Yiren nodded, and then they charged at the demon beasts.

The demon beasts had clearly noticed Yang Ye’s group, and when they saw Yang Ye, they were instantly stunned!

While they didn’t see the dragon, they didn’t attack for the sake of remaining vigilant against the dragon. They just moved aside and vigilantly gathered together. However, they didn’t leave. Obviously, they didn’t want to give up. But they didn’t dare to attack either. Obviously, they were afraid of the Primal True Dragon. After all, it was a Primal True Dragon!

Yang Ye and the others didn’t attack when they saw the demon beasts stop attacking. After all, they’d just been beaten up by these demon beasts.

Meanwhile, the three men walked over to Yang Ye’s group. Xue Yiren was about to speak when the man who led the group, a man in black robes, spoke abruptly, “Who are you?!”

His tone was cold and a little aggressive!

Yang Ye frowned.

Xue Yiren’s face was quite unsightly as well. He was about to speak when the black robed man suddenly walked over to Xue Yiren and asked, “Did we ask you to help?”

Xue Yiren was speechless.

The black robed man glanced coldly at them, “What a bunch of busybodies!”
