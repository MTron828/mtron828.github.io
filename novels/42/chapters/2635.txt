Chapter 2636 – Past Life!

The Sprite Palace!

The power which the previous Sprite Progenitor created had shown itself.

Once the sprites of Sprite Palace arrived, the situation here immediately changed slightly. Because they used a type of formation to trap the Desolate Deathguard and some other experts of the desolate race!

Needless to say, they were quite strong.

Unlike the normal sprites living throughout the world, they were organized and trained. They weren’t just sprites, they possessed extremely formidable combat strengths as well.

Yang Ye had a thought when he saw this scene.

It was to make Snowy train the other sprites within the Primordial Pagoda. He didn’t seek to make them possess destructive strength, he just wanted to make them capable of defending themselves.

Yang Ye gazed at Huang Xuan, and the latter had a wide smile on his face.

As soon as he saw that, Yang Ye knew that Eternal Kingdom would probably not have such an easy time.

Sure enough, not long after the sprites appeared, the space in the surroundings started trembling slightly.

Liu Yuan became visibly vigilant when she noticed this.

Suddenly, a strange cry resounded.

Along with that strange cry, blurry figures appeared around the sprites.

“Voidspawn!” Liu Yuan’s face instantly became unsightly.

Voidspawn were the living beings in the Void World.

The Void World had taken the desolate race’s side!

Along with their arrival, the situation changed once more. The formations were destroyed, and many sprites were killed in an instant!

The combat strengths of these sprites was naturally unable to compare with the experts of the desolate race, or it should be said that the gap between them was quite huge.

Suddenly, Snowy appeared on Yang Ye’s shoulder.

She shot a pleading gaze at Yang Ye upon seeing the sprites of Sprite Palace being killed.

Yang Ye rubbed her head gently. Actually, he didn’t want to save them because they belonged to the Sprite Palace, so they may not respect Snowy. However, he couldn’t bear to refuse her.

Yang Ye looked into the distance. At the same time, Huang Xuan spoke coldly, “Yang Ye, if you interfere in this battle between my desolate race and the Eternal Kingdom, then my desolate race will…”

Yang Ye suddenly gazed at him, “Bite me!”

Huang Xuan’s eyes narrowed slightly while his aura became violent.

Yang Ye ignored Huang Xuan and gazed at the sprites, “Those who’re willing to follow Snowy come over here.”

Meanwhile, many of the sprites gazed at Snowy.

Sprite Progenitor!

Many sprites were very hesitant. However, these were some that instinctively came over to Snowy.

They were very close to Snowy!

Snowy touched some of these sprites with her pawn, and then she gazed at the others in the distance. However, some of them didn’t come over.

Snowy gazed at Yang Ye with bewilderment in her eyes.

Yang Ye rubbed her head gently, “They have their own thoughts, choices, and paths. We won’t force them, alright?”

Snowy nodded, and then she led those who were willing to stay with her into the Primordial Pagoda.

The experts of the desolate race started their slaughter again.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Countless sprites vanished from this world.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye looked up at the sky. Needless to say, the current leader of the Sprite Palace was quite amazing to actually make these sprites refuse Snowy.

However, it was normal because an emperor only remained an emperor throughout his reign.

Even though Snowy was the Sprite Progenitor, it didn’t represent that all sprites would respect her. After all, some had cultivated for countless years and had their own consciousness. They weren’t very different from humans!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. He wasn’t interested in watching anymore.

He was about to leave.

Suddenly, a loud explosion resounded in the sky, and then the entire world shook violently.

At this moment, everyone looked up at the battlefield high above.

Was the outcome decided?

“Haha! I’ll let all of you try the power of Four Dimensional Space…” The Desolate Emperor roared wildly with laughter.

Once he finished speaking, a wave of terrifying energy appeared in the distant sky!

It was energy that shouldn’t be possessed by a Destiny Realm expert!

“The power of Four Dimensional Space?” Yang Ye frowned slightly.

Once the energy appeared, two figures slowly fell from the battlefield.

It was a peak Destiny Realm independent cultivator and the master of Heaven’s Avatar.

Both of their bodies fell for around 300m before exploding apart!

They were dead!

Only the Soul Sect’s master and the Eternal Lord remained in the sky”

“Haha!” The Desolate Emperor roared endlessly with laughter.

Bang! Bang!

Two loud explosions resounded. The sky shook, and then the space in the battlefield above started to collapse inch by inch!

Destroying Three Dimensional Space with the power of Four Dimensional Space!

“Retreat!” The Eternal Lord’s voice resounded!

Retreat!

As soon as he gave that order, it represented that Eternal Kingdom had lost.

The experts of Eternal Kingdom didn’t hesitate to retreat. The experts of the desolate race were about to pursue them when a huge barrier of light appeared where the barrier around Eternal Kingdom had once been.

The barrier of light was dark violet, and it emanated strands of powerful energy. The Desolate Deathguard and sickle-wielding experts were immediately blasted over 30km away upon coming into contact with it. Moreover, two of the Desolate Deathguard had reacted a little slower, and they were blasted into bits by the energy contained within the barrier!

Even Huang Xuan was blasted away in an instant!

A grand formation!

A barrier of light that separated both sides from each other.

Suddenly, the Desolate Emperor appeared before the barrier of light.

At this moment, his long hair hung loosely to his shoulder, and space flickered around him while a wave of powerful energy suffused the area around him.

It was the energy of Four Dimensional Space!

At this moment, the Desolate Emperor was beyond powerful!

It could be said that only two people could fight him in a one on one battle. The first was Qi Bitian in her partially unsealed state, and the second was Tian Xiu.

As for who could suppress him, it was probably Qi Bitian in her fully unsealed state, the woman in a black dress, and the old man with the bamboo chest.

The Desolate Emperor had a wide smile on his face, and he glanced at Yang Ye, “Young Brother Yang, you’re here to watch?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Sort of.”

The Desolate Emperor chuckled, “Then watch well. This battle will be very interesting.”

Yang Ye glanced at him, “I’m a little curious. Aren’t you afraid of that woman in black?”

He was naturally talking about the woman in a black dress who wielded a black sword!

The Desolate Emperor shook his head and smiled, “I didn’t dare to attack until now because I was afraid of her. I was afraid that she would sense when I used the strength of the Four Dimensional Space. But she’s injured now, and those two seniors of yours are hunting her down. She doesn’t have time to pay attention to me.”

Yang Ye glanced at the Desolate Emperor. He didn’t say a word and just moved aside.

Just as the Desolate Emperor had said, there was practically no one left in the world who could stop him. Unless the forces of that place which Mr. Jing and the others came from were willing to help Eternal Kingdom.

However, they would probably not help unless there was something special in it for them.

After all, theoretically speaking, the Desolate Emperor had surpassed ordinary peak Destiny Realm experts. So, they would have to pay a huge price if they were to attack him now.

The Desolate Emperor gazed at the dark violet barrier of light, and the experts of Eternal Kingdom were behind it.

Everyone was looking at the Desolate Emperor!

If the barrier was destroyed, Eternal Kingdom would fall!

The Desolate Emperor grinned. He was about to attack when the Eternal Lord spoke abruptly, “Desolate Emperor.”

The Desolate Emperor gazed at the Eternal Lord and smiled, “You’re trying to surrender? Haha! Sorry, my desolate race doesn’t accept it!”

The Eternal Lord spoke solemnly, “Desolate Emperor, that place is your target. Yet now, that place is about to shatter. So, taking over of Eternal Kingdom won’t benefit you at all, right?”

The Desolate Emperor cracked a smile, “Eternal Kingdom has that divine spirit vein, so it has sufficient spirit energy to support my existence and help me overcome Three Dimensional Space and reach Four Dimensional Space.”

Reach Four Dimensional Space!

That was the Desolate Emperor’s true objective!

His ambition was huge, very huge!

In the barrier of light, the Eternal Lord gazed at the Desolate Emperor for a long time before he said, “You’re daydreaming!”

“Haha!” The Desolate Emperor shook his head, “Perhaps. But people need some dreams and goals. Otherwise, wouldn’t life be completely meaningless? Even if I fail in the end, I wouldn’t regret it. At the very least, I tried. Haha…”

As soon as he finished speaking, he raised his right hand and pressed it down lightly against the barrier of light.

Hiss!

The entire barrier cracked open!

However, the entire Eternal Border turned quite ethereal!

The Desolate Emperor frowned slightly, “You used Eternal Border to form this defensive formation!”

The Eternal Lord gazed coldly at the Desolate Emperor, “If you destroy this formation, Eternal Border will vanish. At that time, you’ll regret your actions!”

“I will?” The Desolate Emperor grinned, “I’ll destroy it right now!”

He slapped his palm down.

Boom!

The barrier of light shook, and then it exploded apart and transformed into countless fragments of energy that dispersed in the surroundings.

At the same time, the entire Eternal Border started to turn quite ethereal!

At this moment, countless living beings throughout Eternal Border suffered miserable deaths.

The destruction of a world represented the death of countless living beings.

It wasn’t natural destruction but caused by man instead!

The Desolate Emperor gazed at the experts of Eternal Kingdom, and he spoke coldly, “Kill! Kill all who resist! Every…”

Suddenly, he stopped, and he looked to the side. At this moment, Yang Ye and countless other experts here looked in the same direction.

A woman in a white dress was walking over slowly from the right.

Yang Ye recognized her. It was the woman who called herself One. She looked just like the woman in black, but she wore snowy white and utterly pure clothes.

She held a white sword that seemed as if it was forged from snowy!

A pure white sword!

There were two characters engraved into its hilt—“往生”.

Past Life!
