Chapter 1017 – The Brink Laws!

Yang Ye instinctively grabbed her and spun his body around when they were about to slam against the ground, so he was the first to slam against the ground.

Bang!

The ground in that area trembled while countless cracks that were thick as an arm swept out swiftly from around Yang Ye. In an instant, the ground in a huge area around Yang Ye had cracked apart!

Pu!

Yang Ye spat out another mouthful of blood while the bones throughout his body felt numb. As for the woman who was on top of him, she’d merely suffered light injuries because he’d endured most of the impact.

She glanced at him yet didn’t speak a word.

Yang Ye stood up, carried her up, placed her on a nearby rock, and then turned around to look ahead. A robust man was standing not too far away from him. The man’s hair and bear were so long that they were being dragged on the ground, and he was merely wearing beast skin. He was a complete and utter savage.

But that savage was actually at the Saint Realm!

If he was in the outside world, then he would definitely die if he faced a Saint in his current state. Yet now, while the man before him was a Saint, the man had no profound energy and was relying solely on his physical body. So, even though Yang Ye wasn’t at the Saint Realm, his body was absolutely not inferior to the body of a Saint!

The reason the man had succeeded at taking Yang Ye by surprise was because Yang Ye had forgotten that his divine sense was useless here!

Yang Ye didn’t speak. He swiftly stomped his right foot against the ground. The ground shook violently as he relied on the counterforce to shoot forward like a cannonball, and even space rippled before him!

He didn’t ask who the man was, nor ask why the man had launched a surprise attack against him. It was best to use the first above all else at times like these!

“Roar!” The savage roared when he saw Yang Ye attack, and his figure shot towards Yang Ye. It didn’t take long for 2 fists to collide in midair!

Bang!

The space around them rippled violently as they each took over a dozen steps back. However, Yang Ye shot forward again in the next moment, and he instantly arrived before the savage and smashed his fist forward again!

“Roar!” The man roared as well, and then he slammed his fist against Yang Ye’s fist.

Bang!

They split apart as soon as they collided, and then Yang Ye charged forward again right away. Yang Ye was very well aware that one had to be ferocious in close-quarter combat. If one was ferocious enough, then one could put heavy psychological pressure on one’s opponent. Of course, he didn’t pursue it on purpose. Because he’d always been so ferocious when he fought!

Both of their physical strengths were extremely powerful. Every single collision of their fists caused space to ripple. The space here was in a comparatively better state because the space here was unusually strong, so they couldn’t shatter the space here even if they utilized their full strength. However, the ground beneath their feet wasn’t so strong.

After just around a little over 10 breaths of time, the ground around them had split apart, and there were countless bottomless cracks throughout the ground. It was like an earthquake had swept through the area!

After around 10 minutes of battle, the man gradually fell into a disadvantaged state before Yang Ye’s fearless and ruthless style in combat.

The savage’s aura was waning while Yang Ye’s was strengthening instead, and he was growing stronger as the battle progressed.

“Roar!” The savage roared and seemed to be saying something, but Yang Ye paid no attention at all. His fist rained down like raindrops in a storm against the savage. At this moment, he wasn’t just using his fists, he was using his legs, knees, and every other part of his body that he could use as a weapon. The savage was showing signs of being defeated under such a violent flurry of attacks!

Bang!

Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye caught the man off-guard, kicked him on the stomach, and blasted him flying. Yang Ye seized the opportunity to press forward swiftly and smash his fist against the man’s chest. The man’s body instantly curved inwardly as if continued flying backwards.

Of course, Yang Ye didn’t give up this opening just like that. He immediately pursued the man and started another violet flurry of attacks!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

At this moment, the man could only suffer a beating. Fortunately, his body was strong, so he was merely injured and hadn’t perished even after suffering countless attacks from Yang Ye!

The woman spoke abruptly when she noticed that Yang Ye had no intent to stop, “He’ll die if you continue!”

Yang Ye kicked the man’s stomach and blasted him flying. The man’s figure crashed against the ground and smashed open a deep hole there. Yang Ye flashed into the hole, and then he appeared before the woman with the man who was on the verge of death now.

Yang Ye tossed the man on the ground, and then he slumped down by the woman’s side. Even though he’d won, he was exhausted. If he were in the outside world, then this wouldn’t be a problem at all with the restorative ability of his profound energy. Yet now, he couldn’t utilize his profound energy, so he could only wait for his body to recover slowly.

“How foolish!” Meanwhile, the woman spoke abruptly.

Yang Ye agreed, “Right, that savage really is quite stupid!”

She replied, “I was talking about you!”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he immediately leaped to his feet and walked over to her, “Can you be a little nicer? Do you realize what sort of fate would be waiting for you if I hadn’t risked my life to defeat that savage? Based on the gaze that savage shot towards you just now, you would definitely be unable to die in peace!”

She looked Yang Ye in the eyes and said, “That’s not how strength should be used!”

Yang Ye frowned, “What are you trying to say!?”

“Your strength isn’t concentrated and too dispersed, so it isn’t able to display the effect it should possess when struck against your opponent. Besides that, your ability to control it is absolutely horrible, and you’re unable to give life to your strength.” She pointed at a rock by Yang Ye’s foot when she spoke up to this point, “Go on. Blast apart the upper half of that rock. Remember that you should only shatter the upper part of it!”

Yang Ye glanced at her, hesitated for a moment, and then picked up a palm sized rock and punched it lightly.

Bang!

A soft bang resounded as the rock was blasted into powder.

Yang Ye’s face froze!

“If you were able to control your strength well during your battle just now, then you wouldn’t have just been able to defeat him as quickly as possible, you could have avoided exhausting yourself!” She spoke indifferently, “Just like that rock. Perhaps it would only take a ten-thousandth of your strength to blast it into pieces, but you used a thousandth of your strength.”

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time before he spoke, “How can I accomplish what you just spoke of?”

“Train!” She said, “There’s no other shortcut besides doing that!”

Yang Ye remained silent for a short while, and then he said, “But even if I can accomplish that, it can’t compare to cultivating a Divine Rank technique, right? So, instead of wasting my time practicing that, wouldn’t it be better to cultivate a powerful technique?”

“How foolish!” She looked him in the eyes and continued, “Do you know what would happen if strength reached its limits? Do you know what would happen if speed reached its limits? Regardless of whether it is humans or demon beasts, the body is our true foundation. The Laws and all those other so-called techniques are just there to support our bodies. Tell me, if your body isn’t strong, and your cultivation isn’t strong enough, then would you be able to execute those techniques you speak about? If your body isn’t strong enough, everything else is only just a dream!”

She gazed at Yang Ye for a long time when she spoke up to this point, and then she continued, “The body is our foundation, and everything else is only strength that we’ve borrowed from the world. Just like this very moment. There’s no spirit energy in this world for you to utilize, so can you who’ve lost your profound energy utilize the energy of the Laws you’ve comprehended? Can you execute those Divine Rank techniques you speak of? No, you’re reduced to an ordinary person when you lose the spirit energy of the world.”

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then he took a deep breath, “I admit that what you said really does make sense, and it has overturned everything I knew before this. However, based on what you’re saying, doesn’t that mean that the cultivation of the body is the only true method to attain the Dao?”

She glanced at him and said, “There are a myriad of Grand Daos, and the body is only just one of them. What I’m trying to tell you is that the body is like a vessel, and its strength determines how much it can hold. If your body isn’t strong enough, then even if you were given the best things in the world, your body might not be able to hold those things, and it might even overwhelm your body instead!”

“I understand now!” Yang Ye took a deep breath. At this moment, he truly understood what she meant. It was just like the Sword Domain. It wasn’t that the Sword Domain wasn’t strong, it was he who wasn’t strong. It was the same for Heaven’s Gravestone. It wasn’t that Heaven’s Gravestone was too strong, it was he who was too weak. The same thing applied when it came to the Sword Spirit as well. It wasn’t that the Sword Precursor and the true form of Heavenrend were too strong, it was he who was too weak!

In the end, he wasn’t worthy of such strength!

Yang Ye suddenly said, “Right, what happens when strength arrives at its limits like you said just now?” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

She replied, “Have you heard of the Brink Laws?”

Yang Ye frowned and shook his head, “The Brink Laws?”

“The ‘Brink’ represents what happens when something arrives at the limits of one’s body.” She gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Just like when floodwater is blocked by a dam. The floodwater would strike the dam in waves, and when the dam vanishes one day, the strength carried by the floodwater would be many times stronger than it was!”

“Accumulate and release!” Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “Right?”

She replied, “You can explain it like that!”

“How does it compare to my Decay Laws?” asked Yang Ye. The woman had witnessed the strength of his Decay Laws when he saved her earlier.

She replied, “You think it’s very powerful?”

Yang Ye asked, “Is it not?”

“Decay is destruction. In other words, it sucks out the vitality of all things. To a certain extent, it’s very good indeed. However, you must realize that it can’t decay strength that has arrived at a certain level.” She continued, “The strength of the Decay Laws is fixed, and it has no room for growth. But the Brink Law doesn’t suffer from such limits. The stronger you are, the stronger it’ll allow you to become! Tell me, which Law is stronger?”

“I understand now!” Yang Ye took a deep breath and said, “Thank you for the guidance!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye glanced at her with a complicated expression on his face. At this moment, even an idiot would have realized that she was definitely no ordinary person.

She said, “Since you’ve understood, then quickly run away!”

Run? Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he seemed to have thought of something and turned around to look. He saw over 100 savages had appeared in the distance, and they were holding strange pikes as they dashed madly in their direction!

Yang Ye gulped when he saw them, and he felt a chill run down his spin.

Because every single one of them was a Saint!
