Chapter 1254 – I’ve Never Known Fear In My Life!

A debt of blood must be repaid with blood? The frown on Yang Ye’s face grew even deeper.

Yun Banqing explained, “He sent out a transmission talisman before he died, and he spoke your name. That transmission talisman was probably sent to notify the Yuan Clan in the Veiled Region. In other words, the Yuan Clan knows that he’s dead, and he died at your hands. No, it should be said that his death was related to you because the Yuan Clan would definitely not think that you can kill a Voider!”

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time before he said, “If they want to fight, then I’ll give them a fight!”

Yun Banqing spoke solemnly, “The Yuan Clan is very strong!”

“So what?” Yang Ye continued, “Should I go seek reconciliation with them? Even if I did, would they agree? They would definitely not! Doing that is no different than asking for insult. So, if they want to fight, then I’ll give them a fight.”

Yang Ye paused for a moment at this point and continued, “I don’t like to fight, nor do I like to cause trouble. But you should understand that there are many occasions in this world where trouble would come to you even if you don’t cause it. Yes, if you make a compromise out of consideration for your overall interests, then you can play down the matter sometimes. Just like before. If I immediately gave them all those treasures once they entered the pavilion, and then knelt on the ground and begged for mercy, then perhaps they would let us live. In that way, we would naturally not face any trouble.”

Yun Banqing said, “But you wouldn’t do that!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Of course!” Yang Ye continued, “Throughout my lifetime, I’ve acted arrogantly, acted madly, challenging things, experienced glory, experienced falling back down to the ground, been complacent, and suffered frustration. But I’ve never known fear in my life! I don’t like to cause trouble, but I’m not afraid of it. So, I’ll never do something like making compromises so that others are happy!”

Yun Banqing gazed at him for a short while and said, “That’s truly manly of you!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

Yun Banqing stretched out a hand to comb the hair by her ear and said, “I know that you’re not afraid, but I want to tell you that the Yuan Clan isn’t the World Devastator Cult. Their clan has existed for extremely long. It can be said that it existed during Jian Wuji’s era, and its reserves can be considered to be the greatest throughout the human race on the continent.”

Yang Ye replied, “But their young master was so weak....”

She walked over to him and looked him in the eyes, “He wasn’t weak, it is you who are too strong. Understand?”

Yang Ye was stunned, “So it’s my fault?”

Yun Banqing couldn’t help but chuckle. She shook her head and spoke seriously, “You have to realize that your opponents aren’t the younger generation anymore. At the very least, your opponents aren’t the younger generation while you’re in Dark Hell Continent. Because there’s practically no one in the younger generation that can compete with you. Your opponents are those old fossils at the Voider Realm, understand?”

Yang Ye said, “That’s quite unfair!”

“It’s your fault for not having any background!” Yun Banqing grinned, “If you were from a good clan, then you can gain fairness. Because there would be people to help you deal with the old fellows at the Voider Realm. Unfortunately, you aren’t from a good family, so you can only deal with them yourself.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Tell me more about the Yuan Clan!”

She nodded, “Their strength can be described as being unfathomable. At the very least, they have 4 Voiders on the surface. As for how many they have in secret, no one knows. After all, no clan would reveal all its trump cards. Hmm? Why do you have such an unsightly expression on your face?”

Yang Ye gulped, “4 Voiders.... I killed 1 just now. In other words, they have at least 3 more?”

Yun Banqing nodded.

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched, and he said, “Go... go on.”

“I thought you fear nothing!” There was a slight smile on her face as she continued, “Besides their unfathomable strength, there’s one more fearsome thing about them. It’s their ability to converge the forces of the Veiled Region. They enjoy extremely high prestige in the Veiled Region, and they can be considered as the leader of the human race. In other words, it’s very likely for them to converge the clans and powers of the Veiled Region to deal with the Sword Alliance.”

Yun Banqing’s face turned gloomy as she finished speaking.

Yang Ye’s face was gloomy as well. While Yun Banqing had said that it was only very likely, he knew that the possibility of that happening was very high. The Sword Alliance had risen too quickly, and it was already like a thorn in the eyes of those powers in the Veiled Region. Now, if someone were to take the lead, there would definitely be many who joined in. If all those powers in the Veiled Region joined forces....

The Sword Alliance’s future was worrying!

Meanwhile, Yun Banqing spoke softly, “You don’t have to be too worried. Just cross that bridge when you get to it. All we can do is work hard on strengthening the Sword Alliance before they attack!”

Yang Ye asked, “Around how long will it take them to act?”

“A month or so if they’re slow; a little over a dozen days if they are quick. It mainly depends on the Yuan Clan’s Patriarch’s ability. Even though they are the number 1 clan amongst the human race of the Veiled Region, it doesn’t represent that the other powers will obey their orders. Besides that it isn’t that easy to convince the other powers, but it isn’t very difficult as well. After all, practically the entire Veiled Region considers the Sword Alliance to be their target.” Yun Banqing continued, “Of course, that’s the worst case scenario.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand. Let’s put this matter aside for now.”

As he spoke, he glanced at the pavilions in the distance, “Let’s head over and see what over treasures lie within the Sword God’s Palace.”

Yun Banqing nodded. Just like that, they arrived at the nearest pavilion, the Sword Technique Pavilion.

A slight smile immediately curled up onto the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth when he saw those words. Both of them walked into the pavilion. As soon as they stepped foot through the entrance, a strand of sword energy suddenly shot towards Yang Ye. However, it hadn’t even arrived in front of him before it was obliterated.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. There was a damaged sword formation on the walls of the pavilion. At this moment, a ray of light suddenly shot out from the damaged formation. Yang Ye flicked a strand of sword energy at the sword formation.

Bang!

The damaged sword formation instantly shattered.

After he dealt with the formation, Yang Ye looked towards the depths of the pavilion. There were over 100 pillars of light not too far away from them. Yang Ye glanced at them, and there were actually over 30 Emperor Rank techniques, and practically all the others were Quasi Emperor Rank techniques!

Yang Ye gulped and gazed at Yun Banqing, “Isn’t... isn’t this a little unusual? When have Emperor Rank techniques been so common?”

“It’s very normal!” She said, “After all, the Sword God’s Palace was a Titanium Rank power. There has only been a single Titanium Rank power throughout the history of Dark Hell Continent, and it’s the Sword God’s Palace. Actually, these are definitely not the only treasures in Sword God’s Palace, and many others have definitely been lost. Because all those years ago, Sword God’s Palace was said to possess all the sword techniques of the entire continent! Moreover, the sword techniques which could arouse the interest of Sword God’s Palace were at the Quasi Emperor Rank at least.”

“Understood!” Yang Ye nodded, “It isn’t Sword God’s Palace that’s too rich, it’s we who are too poor!”

Yun Banqing, “Sort of!”

Yang Ye gazed at her while she gazed at him as well, and they smiled at each other.

Yang Ye walked over to those pillars of light, glanced at them, and noticed that all sorts of techniques were within them. In the end, he shook his head because none could draw his attention.

It couldn’t be helped because he wasn’t interested in Emperor Rank techniques anymore. Now, all his techniques were Void Rank techniques.

But while they couldn’t arouse his interest, they were great treasures for the Sword Alliance!

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to wave his right hand and take them all. After that, he gazed at Yun Banqing, “Let’s go to the next pavilion.”

She nodded. Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “Err, you have no use for those sword techniques, so I....”

She smiled, “Give it to me if I need it, alright?”

“Of course!” Yang Ye smiled.

Both of them left the pavilion and arrived at the next one. However, they were disappointed because it was completely empty. So, they headed to the next one, but they grew more and more disappointed instead. Because after heading into 8 pavilions in succession, all 8 of them had been empty.

“Sword God’s Palace probably didn’t put up any protective measures for them!” Yun Banqing continued, “The Heavenly Treasure Pavilion and Sword Technique Pavilion were protected by sword formations, but the pavilions we’ve just been to weren’t protected by any sword formations, nor were there any pillars of light present within them. There are only 2 explanations for that. Firstly, the Sword God’s Palace didn’t set up any protective measure for them, like how the Sword Technique Pavilion’s contents were protected by pillars of light. If such protective measures weren’t taken, then the treasures within those pavilions would have definitely vanished after experiencing over 10,000 years of time. As for the other explanation, someone has been here and taken all of it. However, it’s very unlikely!”

Yang Ye said, “Forget it. If there aren’t any treasures, then there aren’t.” As he spoke, he gazed at the final pavilion, “Should we take a look?”

Yun Banqing replied, “What do you think?”

“Of course!” As soon as he finished speaking, both of them traveled to the last pavilion, the Shuttle Pavilion.

The Shuttle Pavilion? Yang Ye frowned, and then he entered it with Yun Banqing. Both Yang Ye and Yun Banqing were stunned once they stepped foot through the entrance. The pavilion was extremely wide, and a huge ship was at the center of it. The ship was extremely long and wide, and it was very tall as well. It was a colossus!

There were 10 almost 300m wide turrets on each of the 4 sides of the ship. Especially the top of the ship, there was an almost 1km long turret there.

Meanwhile, Yun Banqing cried out involuntarily, “A Void Cloud Shuttle!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “A Void Cloud Shuttle?”

“You’re rich!” She suddenly grabbed his arm and spoke excitedly, “That’s a Void Cloud Shuttle. There isn’t a single one throughout the continent, including the Veiled Region. It can be considered as the last Void Cloud Shuttle on the continent.”

When he saw how excited she was, Yang Ye couldn’t help but ask this question, “What’s the difference between it and an Imperial Cloud Shuttle?”

“That....” She was about to say something when Yang Ye’s expression suddenly changed, “Someone’s here.”

They turned around and looked out the pavilion while he spoke.

“It’s you!” Yang Ye’s eyes immediately opened wide.
