Chapter 1707 - It’s Right Here! Come Get It!

The Unfettered One!

Yang Ye became visibly respectful. It was his second time seeing the Unfettered One. But the Unfettered One was slightly different than when he’d met the Unfettered One in the Sword Sect. It wasn’t his appearance, but his aura that was different. The Unfettered One before Yang Ye seemed like he was one with the world, and he naturally made others feel oppressed.

Besides that, Yang Ye felt a sense of familiarity from the Unfettered One!

Qin Jian and Qin Youshui’s expressions became extremely solemn when they saw the Unfettered One. Even though they didn’t know how strong he was, their intuition told them that the man on the screen before them was very strong, extremely strong!

In the screen of light, the Unfettered One stood at the foot of Phoenix Cry Mountain and looked up at its peak. His gaze was extremely calm.

It didn’t take long for him to start walking towards the mountain’s peak.

When the Unfettered One stepped foot onto Phoenix Cry Mountain, a wave of powerful sword intent suddenly swept down from the mountain top. It didn’t take long for the sword intent to arrive in the air above the Unfettered One. However, Yang Ye and the others watched with astonishment as it actually stopped for a moment before the Unfettered One, and then immediately retreated back to the mountain top!

Qin Jian and his sister exchanged glances, and both of them were visibly shocked. In the end, Qin Jian gazed at Yang Ye, “Brother Yang…”

Yang Ye remained silent for a short while before he replied, “The sword intent fears him.”

It feared the Unfettered One!

Both Qin Jian and Qin Youshui were absolutely shocked by this. After all, it was Li Taibai’s sword intent, and it was sword intent that had surpassed the True Rank! However, Li Taibai’s sword intent was afraid!

Qin Youshui suddenly asked, “He’s the Unfettered One?”

Yang Ye nodded and gazed at the screen. At this moment, the Unfettered One’s figure was before the mountain wall that Yang Ye and the others had stopped before, just now. There was only a single line of writing on it — If the Sword Dao is at its initial stages, even Immortals can be killed!

It was Li Taibai who’d left those words behind!

The Unfettered One gazed at them for a long time before he said, “Immortals? I have my sword in my grasp, so who can’t I kill?”

As soon as he finished speaking, his sword vanished from his grasp.

An instant later, another line of words appeared beside Li Taibai’s words.

The Unfettered One didn’t stay for a moment longer, and he just continued forward. A short while later, he arrived at the peak of the mountain.

The Unfettered One glanced at the surroundings and entered the palace, the same palace Yang Ye and the others were standing in right now.

There was a sword floating in the palace, the Green Lotus Sword.

The Unfettered One’s gaze descended onto the Green Lotus Sword. A moment of silence ensued, and then the Green Lotus Sword trembled slightly before Li Taibai appeared.

Li Taibai’s face instantly became solemn upon laying eyes on the Unfettered One.

Li Taibai was looking at the Unfettered One, and the Unfettered One was looking at Li Taibai. However, the Unfettered One’s gaze always remained extremely calm.

A long while of silence passed before Li Taibai suddenly spoke, “In my lifetime, I’ve met two people with cultivations in the Sword Dao that surpass my own. One of them is you.”

The calm in the Unfettered One’s gaze finally seemed to be slightly shaken, “Where’s the other person?”

Li Taibai glanced up at the sky, “Above the nine heavens.”

The Unfettered One nodded slightly, “I understand.”

He glanced at Li Taibai and asked, “The Sword Domain?”

Li Taibai nodded slightly, “But I’ve almost forgotten it completely.”

The Unfettered One asked, “How long did it take you?”

“Ten years!” Li Taibai replied, and then he gazed at the Unfettered One, “What about you?”

The Unfettered One stated, “Three years!”

Li Taibai gazed at the Unfettered One for a long time before he said, “You’re not from the small universe.”

The Unfettered One nodded slightly.

Complicated emotions flashed through Li Taibai’s eyes, “I didn’t expect someone like you to exist in a faraway world.”

The Unfettered One asked, “What do you think about the Sword Domain?”

Li Taibai fell silent for a long time before he replied, “Comprehending it is easy, understanding it isn’t.”

The Unfettered One nodded, “The Domain is above Intent, and it’s above the Truth, Clarity, and the Dao. Besides that, it contains the Truth, Clarity, and the Dao. Or to be more precise, it contains everything.”

He fell silent for a moment and continued, “If one is to understand the Domain, one must first understand the heart and understand all things in the world.”

Li Taibai gazed at the Unfettered One for a long time before he said, “Your Sword Dao still has a flaw.”

The Unfettered One nodded, “I’m aware.”

Li Taibai said, “It probably won’t take you too long to rectify.”

The Unfettered One didn’t say anything. He just fell silent for a while, and then turned around and walked away. He suddenly stopped when he arrived at the exit, and then he glanced at the statues of the woman, “Can your sword not sever your emotions?”

Li Taibai fell silent for a while, and then he replied, “I’m unable to overcome that barrier.”

The Unfettered One shook his head slightly, “What a pity. If you could, we would have been able to fight.” He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

The screen of light vanished at this point.

Yang Ye and the others fell silent.

Yang Ye’s eyes were closed, and his mind was constantly replaying the conversation between the Unfettered One and Li Taibai.

The Sword Domain!

They were actually trying to forget the Sword Domain!Why were they trying to forget it?

Yang Ye couldn’t figure it out. Even though he didn’t really understand the Sword Domain, the Sword Domain was merely inferior to the Primordial Pagoda when it came to how helpful it was to him. Moreover, he was certain that both the Unfettered One and Li Taibai’s understanding of the Sword Domain were definitely greater than his own.

However, both of them were actually forgetting the Sword Domain!

As he thought and thought about it, he actually fell into a meditative state.

Qin Jian and Qin Youshui exchanged glances, and they didn’t disturb Yang Ye. In the end, both of them gazed at the Green Lotus Sword.

Meanwhile, Snowy gazed at it as well.

Qin Youshui walked over to the sword and asked, “Are you willing to go with me?”

The Green Lotus Sword hadn’t even replied when Snowy suddenly appeared before it, and then she waved her claw at it.

The Green Lotus Sword trembled slightly, and then it floated over to Snowy. The sword emanated faint sword howls and seemed to be greeting Snowy.

Qin Youshui was rendered speechless by this scene.

The Green Lotus Sword seemed to get along well with Snowy, and both of them started conversing with each other.

Qin Youshui’s eyes dimmed down at the sight of this, and she was about to leave. However, Snowy and the Green Lotus Sword suddenly went over to her. Snowy cracked a smile at her, and then she pointed at the Green Lotus Sword before pointing at Qin Youshui.

Qin Youshui was stunned and asked, “You’re saying that I’ll come with me?”

Snowy nodded.

Qin Youshui was puzzled, “Why?”

Snowy blinked. It was a difficult question for her. After all, how would she know why the Green Lotus Sword wanted to go with Qin Youshui?

She glanced at Qin Youshui, and then she pointed at the sword to tell Qin Youshui to ask it herself.

Qin Youshui couldn’t help but pat Snowy on the head when she saw Snowy act like that, and then she said, “Little Fellow, come with me, alright? My home is full of nice things!”

Nice things!

Snowy’s eyes lit up, and then she quickly nodded. Qin Youshui was visibly delighted when she saw Snowy nod.

She was about to speak when Snowy suddenly pointed at Yang Ye, and then pointed at herself before finally pointing at Qin Youshui. Snowy was indicating that she wanted to visit Qin Youshui’s home with Yang Ye.

The smile on Qin Youshui’s face froze. She glanced at Yang Ye, gazed at Snowy, and then thought for a moment before she replied, “Alright! You can both come!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Snowy cracked a smile when she heard this.

Qin Youshui grinned, and then she gazed at the Green Lotus Sword, “I won’t bring shame to you!”

The Green Lotus Sword shook slightly and flew into her grasp.

Qin Youshui grinned, and then she gazed at Qin Jian, “Let’s head home!”

Qin Jian thought for a moment and gazed at Yang Ye, “Let’s leave after he wakes up!”

Qin Youshui glanced at Yang Ye and nodded slightly, “Alright!”

If Yang Ye was disturbed at a time like this, it would definitely be a huge loss for him. Yang Ye was clearly in a state of comprehension after hearing the conversation between the Unfettered One and Li Taibai. If he was disturbed before he could figure it out, then all his efforts would be wasted.

Snowy was clearly aware that Yang Ye couldn’t be disturbed, so she held the wooden sword in her arm and returned to the Primordial Pagoda.

Three days passed in the blink of an eye, yet Yang Ye still hadn’t regained consciousness.

Qin Youshui glanced at him and said, “He won’t meditate for a few years, right?”

Qin Jian shook his head, “I don’t know.”

Qin Youshui was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes, “I understand now. I see…”

Qin Jian said, “Brother Yang…”

Yang Ye gazed at Qin Jian and Qin Youshui, “Thank you for protecting me for the last three days.”

Qin Jian shook his head slightly, “It was nothing. Since you’ve woken up, we’ll be bidding our farewells.”

As they spoke, both of them intended to leave.

However, Yang Ye suddenly said, “I have something to tell you. It may be of use to you in the future.”

Qin Jian gazed at Yang Ye and spoke seriously, “Please provide us with your guidance.”

Yang Ye said, “Destroy and rebuild.”

Qin Jiang frowned, “Destroy and rebuild?”

Yang Ye nodded, “At many times in our lives, we have to destroy and rebuild. Simply speaking, we have to abandon some things. Once you abandon it and regain it, you’ll notice that it’s a completely different feeling.”

Qin Jian was about to speak, but Yang Ye shook his head.

Qin Youshui shook her head at Qin Jian when she saw this. She knew that there were many things which one had to comprehend on one’s own. Others could only provide some hints and help, but if that person explained everything, it might do more harm than good.

Qin Youshui cupped her fist at Yang Ye and said, “Thank you. Visit the Qin Clan if you have time. Farewell!”

As soon as she finished speaking, both she and her brother turned around and left.

They saw a man walking over from afar when they stepped out of the palace.

The man disregarded them and walked straight towards the entrance of the palace. He suddenly stopped when he passed by the pair of brother and sister, and then he gazed at them, “Yang Ye is in there, right?”

Qin Jian glanced at the man and didn’t speak.

Suddenly, the man vanished on the spot. Qin Jian’s expression changed drastically at the sight of this, and he was about to attack. However, blood suddenly sprayed as a ray of light from a sword flashed.

Hiss!

Qin Jian’s arm flew up into the air.

Qin Youshui was furious, and she was about to attack. However, Qin Jian stopped her. Qin Jian looked the man in the eyes and said, “A sword that’s fine like a snowflake and swift like a gust of wind. You’re the third on the Milky Way Rankings, Ji Liangchuan!”

The man nodded, “I am.”

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “You’re looking for me?”

Ji Liangchuan turned towards the entrance of the palace, and he saw a green clothed man standing there. It was Yang Ye.

Ji Liangchuan gazed at Yang Ye, “Your head is quite valuable. Lend it to me. I’ll return it to you once I’m done using it!”

Yang Ye pointed at his head and said, “It’s right here! Come get it?”
