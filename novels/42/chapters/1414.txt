Chapter 1415 – An Ancient Celestial Demon!

“Right!” Qiong Qi nodded and was about to charge forward. Meanwhile, Zhuang Weiran suddenly obstructed their paths.

She shook her head and said, “That might be an ancient Celestial Demon.”

“An ancient Celestial Demon?” Yang Ye frowned, “What’s that?”

She spoke solemnly, “No one knows where they came from, and we just know that there’s a ‘魔’ character on their foreheads. They are ethereal yet actually exist, and they rely on illusions, the spirit, and the soul to attack. They are exceptionally skilled in creating illusions and attacking the minds of cultivators, causing cultivators to lose control of themselves before they occupy the cultivator’s body instead. They can use the body to cultivate and continuously strengthen themselves.”

Zhuang Weiran paused for a moment at this point, and then she continued, “We’ve investigated the Celestial Demon Lord. While he possessed exceptional natural talent in the past, it wasn’t very outstanding. But for some unknown reason, his strength rose rapidly, and his cultivation advanced by leaps and bounds. It only took him a short while to conquer countless worlds. We guessed that he’d obtained some sort of inheritance, but I never imagined that he obtained the inheritance of a Celestial Demon, and he even had one within him!”

Suddenly, the ethereal figure spoke, “Little girl, you know quite a bit about us!”

Zhuang Weiran turned to look at the ethereal figure and said, “We have no intention to become enemies with you, so you can leave. But you must leave the Celestial Demon Lord behind.”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye withdrew some divine crystals and swallowed them before looking at the Celestial Demon. He knew that there was naturally a reason why Zhuang Weiran hadn’t allowed him and Qiong Qi to attack. So, he didn’t attack impatiently. In any case, the Celestial Demon Lord was almost crippled. As for him, while he didn’t have the strength to fight anymore, he still had Qiong Qi and Zhuang Weiran by his side! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

As for the battle on the ground below, there was no need to worry about it. Because the forces of Celestial Demon Stellar Region were almost completely annihilated, and their remaining forces were barely holding on.

“Become enemies with me?” The Celestial Demon laughed coldly, “All of you?”

Zhuang Weiran was about to say something, but Yang Ye stopped her and patted Qiong Qi’s back, “Kill him!”

Qiong Qi clearly didn’t like the Celestial Demon as well, so he immediately pounced at the Celestial Demon and the Demon Lord.

“You’re courting death!” A savage expression instantly appeared on the Celestial Demon’s face when he saw Yang Ye and Qiong Qi attack, and he waved his right hand and claws at Yang Ye from afar.

Bang!

A terrifying wave of force slammed against Qiong Qi. While it was very strong, it was quite weak to Yang Ye and Qiong Qi. So, they shot forward and slammed against the Celestial Demon and Demon Lord.

“No!” A shrill cry resounded as the Celestial Demon exploded apart and transformed into a ball of mist that rained down towards the surroundings.

He died just like that? Yang Ye and Qiong Qi were stunned. That so-called Celestial Demon was that weak?

Yang Ye turned around to look at Zhuang Weiran. Her brows were knit together slightly, and there was a trace of bewilderment in her eyes as well.

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi said, “Kid, something feels off!”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and remained silent.

A short while passed before Zhuang Weiran walked over to Yang Ye’s side and said, “Since he’s dead, then let’s forget it and annihilate the others from Celestial Demon Stellar Region!”

As she spoke, she stretched out her hand to take Yang Ye’s hand.

Suddenly, something unexpected occurred.

Yang Ye suddenly grabbed Heaven’s Gravestone’s hilt and swung it at her!

Zhuang Weiran was instantly obliterated!

Everyone down below was stunned. Especially the forces of Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region. They hadn’t expected that Yang Ye would suddenly attack Zhuang Weiran. So, their minds were completely bewildered!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “Needless to say, this illusion of yours is really not bad. It seems real yet is fake, seemed fake yet is real too. Even I was almost deceived by you. Unfortunately, I don’t just possess the Enlightened Sword Heart!”

As soon as he finished speaking, around two breaths of time passed before the scene around Yang Ye suddenly started transforming. After that, Zhuang Weiran, whom Yang Ye had killed, had once again appeared not too far away from him, and both the Celestial Demon and the Demon Lord had appeared where they had been!

An illusion!

Everything had been an illusion!

Actually, Yang Ye had almost been deceived in the beginning. Because his Enlightened Sword Heart hadn’t allowed him to discern anything unusual. However, once Qiong Qi warned him, Yang Ye had activated his Sword Domain for safety’s sake. As soon as he did that, he instantly noticed the illusion that surrounded them.

The space around him didn’t belong to him, so he couldn’t sense it. However, once he activated the Sword Domain, the space around him had merged into one with his mind and spirit, so he could clearly sense anything unusual within it.

Simply speaking, all illusions were useless before the combination of Sword Domain and Enlightened Sword Heart. Perhaps some even greater illusions could even deceive his Sword Domain, but the Celestial Demon’s illusion couldn’t.

Zhuang Weiran instantly heaved a sigh of relief when she saw Yang Ye. She’d been in an illusion as well. Fortunately, her combat strength and mental strength were extremely good. While she hadn’t been able to discern that it was an illusion, she’d been able to sense something was off, just like Qiong Qi had. So, she was vigilant at all times and didn’t give the Celestial Demon any opportunity to take advantage of.

“I underestimated you!” Suddenly, the Celestial Demon said, “I never expected you to see through it with such ease. I’m truly quite surprised!”

Yang Ye looked up at the Celestial Demon and Demon Lord. At this moment, the Demon Lord’s gaze was blank, and he’d lost the imposing aura he used to have. He simply seemed like a puppet. Yang Ye’s gaze merely paused on the Demon Lord before he gazed at the Celestial Demon, “I don’t like to waste my breath. The Demon Lord must die. As for you, you can leave whenever you want.”

Killing the Celestial Demon wasn’t very important. In any case, the Celestial Demon was using the Demon Lord as well. So long as the Demon Lord was killed, Celestial Demon Stellar Region would be finished. Actually, it was completely finished. However, so long as the Demon Lord was alive, it had a chance to rise up once more. So, the Demon Lord had to die!

“He’s my vessel, so he can’t die!” The Celestial Demon stared fixedly at Yang Ye, “Of course, if you’re willing to be my vessel, then his fate doesn’t matter. Besides that, all of you wouldn’t be able to stop me if I wanted to leave with him. Trust him, even that beast by your side can’t hope to catch up to me.”

“Your vessel?” Yang Ye frowned, “What’s that?”

“He means that he will live within you!” Meanwhile, Zhuang Weiran suddenly said, “He will use your body to cultivate. Actually, it’s just like Qiong Qi. But Qiong Qi is relying on himself to cultivate, and he will rely on you instead. For example, if you cultivate, you have to share some of your profound energy with him. Besides that, regardless of whether your cultivation, soul, or spiritual energy improve, you’ll have to share it equally with him. Simply speaking, you cultivate on your own, but you have to give half the fruits of your cultivation to him!”

Yang Ye was astounded, “That fellow actually agreed to something so stupid?”

Zhuang Weiran spoke solemnly, “There are benefits, of course!”

“Of course there are!” Meanwhile, the Celestial Demon suddenly said, “Yang Ye, what do you think about the Celestial Demon Hegemon Body from before?”

Yang Ye told the truth, “It was very strong!”.

It really was strong. It could be said to be much stronger than the Stellar Ward technique. If the Demon Lord hadn’t possessed insufficient offensive strength, then both Yang Ye and Qiong Qi would have been in danger.

“I taught it to him!” The Celestial Demon continued, “Yang Ye, so long as you agree to be my vessel, then regardless of whether it’s formidable cultivation techniques or combat techniques, you’ll have them all. Besides that, I can guide you in your cultivation and make your cultivation advance by leaps and bounds. Moreover, you’ll gain even more benefits once you get to the large world. Because I know of some ancient ruins there. Those ruins haven’t been discovered at all, so all the treasures there will be yours!”

The Celestial Demon’s voice was filled with temptation.

Yang Ye remained silent and seemed to be quite moved by it.

Zhuang Weiran glanced at him and remained silent. She felt that Yang Ye was no fool. Or it should be said that Yang Ye was much smarter than many, and he would absolutely not allow himself to suffer a loss.

Meanwhile, the Celestial Demon added, “Yang Ye, your natural talent is superb. If you join forces with me, then you’ll definitely be able to shock the entire large world in the future. Moreover, it’s very likely for you to become the future owner of that large world and command all the worlds in this universe. It’s an opportunity for me, and it’s an opportunity for you as well!”

At the same time, Qiong Qi’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Kid, that fellow is using a mental assault technique on you. Be careful!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, and then he looked up at the Celestial Demon, “Do you really have that technique?”

“Of course!” The Celestial Demon hurriedly said, “I don’t just have the Celestial Demon Hegemon Body technique. So long as you agree to be my vessel, then I’ll even give you stronger techniques than that!”

Yang Ye fell silent. But based on his outward appearance, he really seemed to be quite tempted.

The Celestial Demon continued, “See this fellow over here? He was just a person with comparatively good natural talent. Under normal circumstances, it would be impossible for him to attain his current accomplishments. However, he didn’t just become a peerless expert with my help, he even took control of over 100 small worlds and a medium world. If you hadn’t appeared here, then he would have conquered Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region as well!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and said, “Fine, I agree!”

Zhuang Weiran glanced at Yang Ye but remained silent.

“Good!” The Celestial Demon’s voice carried extraordinary excitement, “Lower your mental defenses. I’m going to enter your body and live within your sea of consciousness. Don’t worry, it won’t affect you at all. However, you might feel slightly uncomfortable in the beginning. But it’s a normal reaction, and it’ll go away quickly!”

Yang Ye seemed to be afraid that the Celestial Demon would go back on his word and said, “Remember your promise to give me the Celestial Demon Hegemon Body technique!”

“Don’t worry, I won’t forget!” As soon as he finished speaking, the Celestial Demon transformed into a ray of dark light that entered the center of Yang Ye’s forehead.

Once he entered Yang Ye’s sea of consciousness, the Celestial Demon suddenly roared with laughter, “Hahaha! Yang Ye! Congratulations on becoming my new slave....”

A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth instead.

Even though the trick he used was old, all that mattered was that it worked!
