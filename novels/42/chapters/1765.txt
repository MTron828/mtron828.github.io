Chapter 1766 – People Of Extraordinary Ability!

Lu Yuntian asked, “Brother Ying, what’s wrong?”

Everyone gazed at Ying Qing.

Ying Qing spoke furiously, “Everyone, I have to return to my clan.”

Lu Yuntian was puzzled, “Why?”

Ying Qing replied, “Because Yang Ye is attacking!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure vanished on the spot, and the other experts from the Ying Clan vanished with him.

Yang Ye’s attacking?

All of them were stunned. How could he dare to attack the Ying Clan? Is he abandoning Heaven Void Continent?

The others exchanged glances!

The experts of the Ying Clan were gone, so what should they do now? That was the problem that plagued them right now. Even though the Ying Clan was gone, they could still crush the Yang Clan. However, besides Yang Ye, the Yang Clan still had Yang Lianshuang!

She wasn’t any weaker than Yang Ye!

To attack or not to attack?

Suddenly, the space before them trembled slightly, and then a woman in a black dress appeared before them.

It was the Yang Clan’s patriarch, Yang Lianshuang!

A trace of vigilance appeared on their faces when they saw her.

Yang Lianshuang glanced at them and smiled, “Since all of you’re here on my continent, aren’t you going to come down and have a seat? We don’t have much, but we can still offer you a cup of tea.”

All of them gazed at her in silence.

Yang Lianshuang continued, “Looks like you’re exercising a great amount of vigilance towards my Yang Clan. Don’t worry, there’s no ambush down there, and my Yang Clan doesn’t have any support. I’m serious.”

Lu Yuntian suddenly said, “Yang Lianshuang, you led a rebellion to seize power and killed your own clansmen. Justice doesn’t tolerate the existence of a person like you. You….”

Suddenly, Yang Lianshuang interrupted Lu Yuntian, “Patriarch Lu, you’re making me look down on you. I’m sure everyone here knows why your Lu Clan is attacking my Yang Clan, but you're trying to use such an honorable and upright reason? That’s like selling your body yet putting up a sign that says you’re pure!”

Lu Yuntian’s face became quite unsightly.

Sometimes, one should be a tad hypocritical, but it depended on the circumstances. Who were the people present here right now? They were all existences who had lived for years! So, who was he putting an act on for? Who wouldn’t see through it?

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang said, “Since you’re not willing to be our guests, I won’t force you.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and walked away. But it didn’t take long for her to stop and say, “I forgot something. Yang Ye said that he’s feeling a little bored and wants to travel around. I told him that the scenery in your clans isn’t bad, and he should take a look. He said he will.”

She turned around and vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

Lu Yuntian and the others’ expressions turned extremely unsightly.

It was a threat!

Would Yang Ye go to their clans just to take a look at the scenery? Even an idiot knew what Yang Ye would do!

The incident in Heaven Desolation City was still vivid in their memories!

Moreover, their upper level forces were here on Heaven Void Continent. While they still had experts left in their clans, could those experts stop Yang Ye?

If it was a head-on battle, then those experts and the various formations they had would definitely be able to stop Yang Ye. But the problem was Yang Ye wouldn’t fight them head-on! Once he hid himself, then based on his movement and attack speeds, could anyone stop him?

So, as soon as they thought up to this point, all of them had the intent to retreat!

Ku Jing and Wu Wen exchanged glances, and both of them noticed a trace of surprise in each other’s eyes. A moment of silence ensued before Wu Wen said, “These two fellows never do anything that others expect!”

Ku Jing nodded slightly, “Fortunately, my Ku Clan didn’t participate in this. Otherwise, if that kid comes to my Ku Clan to take a look at the scenery there, I will have a terrible headache!”

Wu Wen asked, “Even your Ku Clan has to fear him?”

Ku Jing chuckled, “It can’t be called fear. I can only say that it’ll be very troublesome. Don’t tell me your Wu Clan won’t find it troublesome?”

Wu Wen nodded, “True!”

Fighting Yang Ye head-on wasn’t that terrifying. After all, no matter how strong he was, how many experts could he fight at once? However, Yang Ye was quite terrifying when he acted shamelessly.

Meanwhile, Ku Jing suddenly said, “The benefits aren’t worth the risks!”

Wu Wen asked, “What do you mean?”

Ku Jing spoke solemnly, “I’m saying that Ying Qing and the others overestimated themselves and underestimated both Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang. Even if they win in the end, those two kids are capable of causing them severe losses. Conversely, if they’re unable to kill those two kids, then when those kids show themselves again in ten years, this medium universe may lose half of its large clans!”

Wu Wen nodded slightly to display his agreement. Or it should be said that he deeply agreed. Everyone only had their eyes on Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang, and they’d overlooked another person. That person was An Nanjing. An Nanjing’s natural talent and strength were absolutely not inferior to Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang.

However, the others weren’t aware of the relationship between Yang Ye and An Nanjing. It could be said that so long as Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang didn’t die, then the Ying Clan and those other clans would have to face the vengeance of three extraordinary geniuses.

“Brother Wu, I have other matters to attend to. Farewell!” Ku Jing vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Wu Wen took a deep and long glance in the direction Ku Jing had left towards. He remained silent for a long time, and then he vanished on the spot.

Meanwhile, after remaining silent on the spot for a long time, Lu Yuntian and the others started leaving in succession.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

In the end, they’d chosen to retreat.

Because after they lost the support of those experts from the Ying Clan, they weren’t that confident anymore. Their leader was gone, so they would naturally not stay. Because once they forced the attack on the Yang Clan, then even if their strength far surpassed the Yang Clan, the Yang Clan would still be able to rely on its formations to make them suffer serious losses. After all, they would be fighting in the Yang Clan’s base camp.

At that time, the Ying Clan would be allowed to maintain its strength.

Of course, there was another reason, and it was that they hadn’t forgotten what Yang Lianshuang told them just now. Yang Ye might travel to their clans to take in the ‘scenery’ there!

No matter what, the danger that the Yang Clan faced had been temporarily resolved by Yang Ye through such methods.

At a graveyard in Phecda City.

Two old men were seated cross legged and facing each other. There was a small table between them, and there was a Go board on the table.

The old man on the left was a white haired old man. It was the Ying Clan’s ancestor. As for the old man on the right, it was the Yang Clan’s ancestor.

The white haired old man raised a piece and placed it down before he said, “Brother Yang Xiu, you don’t seem to be in good condition at all!”

The Yang Clan’s ancestor, Yang Xiu, placed a piece on the board and replied, “I’m doing pretty well. I won’t die soon! But Brother Ying Yu, I see a dark aura around you. It’s a sign of a life threatening disaster.”

Ying Yu glanced at Yang Xiu, “Brother Yang Xiu, are you saying that someone in this medium universe can kill me?”

Yang Xiu grinned, “Brother Ying, you’re really confident!”

Ying Yu replied with a question, “Am I wrong?”

Yang Xiu looked up at the sky and said, “The medium universe of the Milky Way System was developed by a group of ancient cultivators all those years ago. Some of them have gone to the large universe to seek their so-called paths. But some have stayed behind in the medium universe.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “Brother Ying, I’m sure you’re aware of that existence in Moment Mountain. Are you confident in your ability to defeat her?”

Ying Yu fell silent.

Meanwhile, Yang Xiu continued, “Let’s not speak about the people from ancient times. Let’s just talk about the present. Brother Ying Yu, are you confident in being able to defeat the joint forces of those two juniors from my Yang Clan?”

Ying Yu fell silent again.

Because he really wasn’t confident in his ability to defeat Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang’s joint forces. Their joint forces were quite overwhelming!

Yang Xiu chuckled and said, “See? Even if we’re at the 6th stage of the True Realm, we’re not invincible. There are ancient cultivators before us, and juniors behind us. So, Brother Ying Yu, a person can be confident, but a person can’t be overconfident. My Yang Clan’s Yang Xiang was overconfident, and it transformed him into a freak that doesn’t dare to even show his face again!”

Ying Yu raised a piece and placed it on the board, “I didn’t come here today to discuss all of this with you. I’m here because I want to know what your attitude towards the Yang Clan is.”

Yang Xiu smiled, “I don’t have one. I thought it was just children fighting with each other, so I couldn’t be bothered to interfere. But I didn’t expect your Ying Clan to make you join in. Since you’ve shown yourself, how can I stand by idly?”

Ying Yu gazed at Yang Xiu, “So, you intend to fight?”

Yang Xiu replied, “Of course. Even though I don’t really care about the Yang Clan, I’m still a member of the Yang Clan. Moreover, even if I disregard the link of blood between me and the juniors of the clan, I have to think about the ancestor of my clan. If I stand by idly when the Yang Clan my ancestor created is attacked, then I wouldn’t know where to put my face if I meet him one day!”

Ying Yu understood everything at this point.

If he joined the battle, Yang Xiu would; if he didn’t join the battle, then Yang Xiu wouldn’t.

Meanwhile, Yang Xiu smiled, “Brother Ying Yu, interfering in a fight between the juniors is beneath someone of your status.”

Ying Yu spoke indifferently, “If I don’t interfere, then those two juniors of your Yang Clan might become unstoppable and do as they please!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand, and the Go board was instantly obliterated. He said, “Brother Yang Xiu, farewell!”

Suddenly, Yang Xiu said, “Brother Ying Yu, you seem to have forgotten someone.”

Ying Yu gazed at Yang Xiu, and the latter chuckled, “My Yang Clan has someone called Wudi!”

Ying Yu’s expression changed in an instant.

Yang Wudi!

All those years ago, that name reverberated like a thunderclap in the ears of everyone throughout the medium universe! It was that exact same person who suppressed the almighty Ying Clan to the point it was almost suffocated!

Meanwhile, Ying Yu suddenly chuckled, “Brother Yang, you seem to have forgotten someone as well.”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

At the same time, Yang Xiu seemed to have thought of something, and a slightly solemn expression appeared on his face.

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang appeared in front of Yang Xiu and asked, “Who was he talking about?”

Yang Xiu remained silent for a short moment, and then he replied, “Ying Jing! Someone who once attacked the Ku Clan and forced the Ku Clan to summon its founding ancestor.”

Yang Lianshuang fell silent for a few breaths of time, and then she said, “People of extraordinary ability are born in every generation!"
