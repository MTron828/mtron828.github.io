Chapter 2594

Kill his way out!

Yang Ye was very well aware that it was impossible to leave safely after just killing a single person!

Eternal Kingdom’s powers and the Soul Sect wouldn’t let him escape that easily!

Now, he’d kill the old man. Obviously, the power behind the old man would definitely not let him leave.

Hatred was usually like that. A little but would snowball incessantly.

However, he had no other choice!

He killed a peak Lord Realm expert!

Even though he’d suffered some injuries, it felt different to him this time.

Because he hadn’t used any external sources of strength, not even a secret technique!

This time, he’d relied on his true strength!

Of course, it was probably just the beginning. So, he didn’t allow himself to relax.

As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, the surroundings fell silent. There was no movement in the surroundings!

Yang Ye chuckled, “If you don’t show yourselves, I’m going to leave.”

He walked toward the teleportation formation.

Yang Ye hadn’t even gotten onto the platform when a man appeared not too far behind him.

Yang Ye stopped and turned around. He smiled, “I thought you wouldn’t be coming.”

The man glanced at the old man’s corpse and said, “Killing a peak Lord Realm expert at the Lord Realm, and you didn’t even use any treasures. No wonder the Eternal Kingdom’s powers fear you. You’re worth it!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m not interested in that. What I’m interested in is whether more will come if I kill you?”

The man nodded, “Yes.”

Yang Ye shrugged, “Then why don’t all of you just show yourselves at once? Why must you do it one by one? Are you trying to give your lives away?”

The man patted his face lightly, “We have to preserve our honor and dignity in a place like this. So, have you not realized? Everyone coming to deal with you is at the Lord Realm. If it’s someone above the Lord Realm, then even if we kill you, the other powers will laugh at us.”

Yang Ye smiled, “I see, so it’s about face. Right, so what did the Eternal Kingdom give you? I’m really quite curious.”

The man shook his head, “That’s for the higher-ups to know. My mission is to stop you from leaving. Of course, it has changed now. My new mission is to kill you because you killed one of ours. Now, even if the Eternal Kingdom wishes to let you leave again, we won’t let you.”

Yang Ye blinked, “I’m so afraid!”

The man grinned, but his smile was cold!

A spear suddenly appeared in his grasp!

But Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot, and then he was in front of the man.

A sword shot forward!

At the same time, the man’s spear flashed forward like a bolt of lightning.

It shot straight at Yang Ye’s chest!

Even though Yang Ye had attacked first, and his sword was swift, the man wasn’t slow. He was able to catch up even if he’d been slower to attack, and he was using a spear, so he was very confident. He was confident that he could make Yang Ye retreat with his spear and grab the initiative for himself!

However, along with the sound of flesh being pierced open, the man was stunned!

Yang Ye hadn’t dodged this attack, and it accurately stabbed into Yang Ye’s chest. But that wasn’t the end of it! Yang Ye even moved closer toward the man and allowed the spear to go in deeper!

Of course, the man’s expression instantly changed once he recovered from his shock!

But at this moment, he saw a smiling face, and then the smile became slightly slanted and grew increasingly slanted… It turned out that the smile wasn’t slanting, it was his head that had left his neck!

The man’s head flew off the bridge and dropped into the Boundless Water!

When the Desolate Emperor witnessed this scene on the third floor of the Divine Abode, he suddenly started clapping while undisguised praise could be seen in his eyes, “Interesting indeed. I underestimated his courage.”

The man was actually not any weaker than the old man from before. Or it should be said that he was slightly stronger. However, while Yang Ye had fought the old man for so long, he’d only used a single move to kill the man!

The main reason was naturally Yang Ye’s choice. Yang Ye had taken the man by surprise. He’d chosen to risk his life, and it was something the man had absolutely not expected. Of course, Yang Ye was only able to succeed because his sword was fast and strong enough!

There was one other thing which couldn’t be overlooked, and it was Yang Ye’s body. His body could endure the impact of the spear! If he was just an ordinary sword cultivator, that attack would have blasted his body apart. At that time, he wouldn’t have been able to risk his life to kill the man because he would have already given his life away!

Besides that, the man and Yang Ye’s thoughts were completely different. Yang Ye planned to decide on life and death. He wanted to kill. But while the man wanted to kill Yang Ye too, he was confident, and he hadn’t thought of killing Yang Ye immediately. Or to be more precise, he hadn’t thought that he could kill Yang Ye immediately. So, he’d prepared himself to fight to his heart’s content. But Yang Ye hadn’t given him the chance to do that!

On the bridge.

Yang Ye sat on the ground while leaning against the bridge. Blood was pouring out incessantly from his chest.

Yang Ye glanced at the two corpses before him, and he felt very disappointed. Because they had no spatial rings on them. In other words, he had gained zero spoils from the battles!

He felt quite regretful. He regretted being so violent. Because their treasures were definitely hidden within their seas of consciousness. Since he’d obliterated their souls, their treasures were very likely to have been obliterated as well.

It was a storage method exclusive to experts at the Lord Realm and above!

Without spatial rings, he had nothing to replenish himself with!

Yang Ye looked before himself. There were 12 World Crystals left before him. Each battle exhausted around three of them. Even though he’d killed his opponent quickly just now, it had still exhausted a huge amount of his strength!

In the past, he didn’t have to consider his profound energy or his injuries. But now, he had to consider all of it.

Yang Ye devoured three World Crystals. They were for healing his injuries. Besides that, he had to use two more to replenish his profound energy!

In other words, he had only seven left now! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Seven!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and put them away, and then he looked up at the sky and smiled, “I really miss the days I had you by my side, little fellow! Snowy, Erya, have fun! Come back after I’ve resolved everything here!”

As he spoke, Yang Ye stood up. The injury on his chest was still there. Earlier, if the man had reacted just a little faster and hadn’t been stunned for that split second, the man would have been able to destroy his body from inside out and even kill him!

Unfortunately, the man had been stunned for that moment, and that cost the man his life!

The outcome of a battle between experts was decided in a split second!

Yang Ye leaned against the bridge and didn’t choose to leave. Because it was impossible right now.

There was a person not too far away from him, an old man in linen clothes.

The old man was bald and was carrying a boulder behind him and wore a pair of hemp shoes. The boulder was square and dark, and the corners of his shoes showed signs of extreme wear. There were even some holes on the shoes!

Yang Ye glanced at the old man. He didn’t know when the old man had even appeared there.

The old man had just appeared out of thin air!

He wasn’t at the Lord Realm!

He was above the Lord Realm!

The bald old man glanced at Yang Ye and grinned, “Heal up slowly. There’s no rush. I’ll wait for you to heal.”

Yang Ye’s face was unprecedentedly solemn!

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Qi Bitian suddenly stopped kicking her ball and shot a glance outside. After that, she sat on a nearby boulder and fell silent.

Meanwhile, Lei Lin rushed over to her and gasped as she said, “B-Big Sis, they are bullying big brother!”

Qi Bitian nodded slightly, “I know!”

Lei Lin immediately started crying.

Qi Bitian rubbed her head gently and looked up into the sky. No one knew what she was thinking.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Around an hour passed before Yang Ye was practically fully healed.

Yang Ye stood up and gazed at the old man, “Didn’t he say that you cared about face? What? Even someone above the Lord Realm is here for me?”

The old man shook his head slightly, “You must be joking, young brother. Your strength is shocking. According to our analysis, you’re practically invincible in the Lord Realm. So, sending more Lord Realm experts would only be sending them to their deaths.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “There’s something I want to ask.”

The old man walked over to Yang Ye and said, “If you have any last words, or something you wish to leave to your loved ones, feel free to tell me about it. I’ll try my best to do it for you!”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s nothing like that. I just want to know what’s above the Lord Realm. Can you explain it to me?”

The old man smiled, “I see. Above the Lord Realm is the Destiny Realm.”

“The Destiny Realm?” Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What does that mean?”

The old man grinned, “The Grand Dao Destiny Realm is actually an elusive concept. It’s called the Destiny Realm because the person has grown strong enough to sense the existence of Destiny. If you can sense its existence, you’re at the Destiny Realm.”

Yang Ye asked, “So what if you can sense it?”

The old man shook his head, “Sensing it represents getting a step closer to it.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “We have no intention of getting swept into the enmity between Eternal Kingdom and you. However, Eternal Kingdom paid a huge price. Not only did they give us an Ancient Token, they gave us a Soul Token. The value of that is something we truly cannot refuse. Of course, we know that since they were willing to pay such a high price, there’s definitely something off. Or perhaps you have the backing of some power or person. But that’s fine. No matter what backing you possess, we’re willing to accept all consequences once we’ve killed you!”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly. He took a deep breath and said, “Little Qi, if I die, please burn my corpse, and tell Snowy and Erya that I’ve gone to a very, very faraway place. Tell them I’ll come back for them once they’ve grown up! I’m counting on you!”
