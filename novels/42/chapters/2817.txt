Chapter 2818 – One Breath to Self-Detonate!

Destiny descended with her sword in hand while two headless corpses, two heads, and Yang Ye’s dumbstruck figure remained behind her.

Yang Ye seemed like he’d lost his soul as he gazed at the two corpses and heads before him.

Yang Ye clenched his fists while two streams of tears seeped out from the corners of his mouth. He was practically shouting as he said, “Y-You were such fools! You could have just left! You could have left! Why did you stay and give your lives away?! Why?!”

Yang Ye was crying like a child.

Meanwhile, Destiny arrived in the sky above Eternal Border.

At this moment, countless gazed at her.

That woman who was like a god!

She gazed at the mysterious expert, and the latter grinned, “You even killed “yourself” so decisively! Amazing!”

She looked down at the mysterious expert and smiled, “Don’t waste your breath on meaningless chatter. Since you’ve been in hiding for so long, I presume you have some trump cards. Come on, show them to me, and then all of this can come to an end.”

The mysterious expert chuckled, “Of course.”

He pressed his right hand down.

Bang!

In an instant, a huge black hole appeared in the sky above Eternal border.

It blotted out the entire sky!

The mysterious expert looked up at Destiny, “The starry sky in my palm, it’s the Grand Dao I’ve comprehended in these years. Why don’t you give it a try?”

As he spoke, he raised his right hand. In an instant, the huge black hole suddenly shot up into the air toward her.

The black hole was attempting to swallow her!

At this moment, it was like Destiny was being swallowed by endless space and the universe. She seemed so tiny!

She glanced at the mysterious expert, “You still haven’t improved at all after so many years, and you’re still studying such superficial things.”

She gently stabbed Justice forward.

Hiss!

Space was cut open where Justice descended, but that small hole in space was like a huge gash in space. In an instant, the starry sky that enveloped her was obliterated.

In less than a breath of time, that black hole vanished.

It had been destroyed with a single attack!

Destiny looked at the mysterious expert down below, “You were born of this world, and this Three Dimensional Universe can be described as being a part of you. You can destroy it yourself. In that way, perhaps you can pose a tiny threat to me!”

The mysterious expert looked up at her, “If you die, it’s because you’re too confident!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a terrifying aura shot through the sky.

Destiny looked to the side, and she saw a colossus covered in blood red flames approaching from her right.

The Undying Phoenix!

Destiny grinned, “An evil beast!”

“It’s time we get even!” Suddenly, a voice resounded, and then the space to her left shook violently before a huge tortoise walked out slowly from there.

The Black Tortoise!

She grinned, “Are there more?”

“Of course!” Another ancient voice resounded.

As soon as the voice resounded, a Qilin appeared before Destiny!

The Demonic Qilin!

Her gaze descended onto the Qilin, “Demonic Qilin… Interesting indeed. Besides the Evil Progenitor herself, you’re quite strong among all the other evil beasts.”

The Demonic Qilin glanced indifferently at her, “Thanks for the compliment.”

“What about me?” Delicate laughter resounded from behind Destiny. A huge fox with ten tails had suddenly appeared there.

The Ten-Tailed Fox!

Destiny didn’t even look back as she said, “You… are trash!”DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The fox’s expression instantly changed. It was about to attack when the mysterious expert suddenly said, “If you attack, you’ll die the moment she swings her sword!”

The fox gazed at the mysterious expert, grunted coldly, and didn’t say a word, nor did it attack.

Destiny glanced at the demons here and grinned, “Besides the Evil Progenitor, all the other famous evil beasts of the ancient times are here.”

She looked down at the mysterious expert, “Make your move!”

The mysterious expert nodded, “Alright!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he formed a strange seal with his hands, and then a huge pitch black formation appeared in the sky above Eternal Border. The formation had seven corners, and the demon beasts took one of the corners each while Destiny stood at the center.

The seven evil beasts had surrounded her.

Destiny looked down at the formation beneath her feet, “Your strength is converged into one. Interesting. Come give it a try!”

“Attack!” The mysterious expert’s voice resounded.

Along with the command, the evil beasts in the sky suddenly attacked. A stream of flames surged from the phoenix’s mouth. In an instant, the area around Destiny was engulfed in flames!

These flames were completely different from the flames Yang Ye had seen that day. Because these flames contained the energy of the other evil beasts. The formation’s effect was to converge their strength to one of them!

No one was a match for Destiny in single combat.

Destiny raised her sword and waved it gently.

Bam!

An explosion resounded, and she was pushed around 30m back. However, the formation beneath her feet hadn’t vanished. Moreover, energy seemed to be rippling about within it!

Destiny glanced at the evil beasts and chuckled, “Your strength isn’t bad.”

The Demonic Qilin suddenly asked, “Is it just not bad?”

She replied with a question, “What do you think?”

The Qilin laughed coldly, “Then try me!”

As soon as it finished speaking, it suddenly roared with fury at Destiny, and then it slammed itself at her. Meanwhile, the other evil beasts took action as well.

All of them madly released their energy, and the energy traveled through the formation and converged into the Demonic Qilin. Obviously, they were very well aware that they could only fight her when they remained united!

None of them could rival her strength in single combat!

The Demonic Qilin’s strength was undoubtedly terrifying. Its own strength was capable of obliterating the area around it, and coupled with the strength of the other evil beasts, it was entirely capable of obliterating the entire world around it!

Destiny grinned, and then she pressed her sword against her forehead, “Determine Fate.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she tapped her foot down and shot forward like a gust of wind.

Countless watched as she shot over to the Demonic Qilin and swung her sword!

Hiss!

The sound of something being sliced open resounded!

Destiny appeared behind the Demonic Qilin, and the demon beast behind her stiffened on the spot. An instant later, its huge body split into two and blood surged out like a river.

An instant kill.

The remaining evil beasts’ expressions changed from the sight of this!

Destiny gazed at the rest of them and smiled, “I thought all of you would pleasantly surprise me. Unfortunately, you’re still absolutely weak. Not to mention all of you, even if all the evil beasts from that time were to be gathered here today, could they even stop a swing of my sword?”

As soon as she finished speaking, she floated forward with sword in hand, causing the expressions of all the evil beasts to change drastically. They started fleeing madly toward the surroundings, but they noticed to their shock that they were actually incapable of escaping the formation!

The Undying Phoenix gazed at the mysterious expert and roared with fury, “What are you trying to do?!”

The mysterious expert remained silent!

The Undying Phoenix wished to say more, but a sword suddenly appeared behind it. Its expression changed drastically, and it ignored everything as it transformed into a ray of flames that charged at the sword!

An attack with its life on the line!

Hiss!

The flames were sliced into two, and it wasn’t just the flames that had been sliced apart, the phoenix was in two as well!

Its blood flowed into the formation like a stream of lava, and upon absorbing its blood, the formation started to tremble!

In the formation, Destiny turned to look at the Vicious Tiger, and the latter had no fear in its eyes, “Damn you! I’ll put an end to our enmity today!”

As soon as it finished speaking, it pounced at her.

Its body started to burn!

Obviously, it knew that it was doomed!

She still had a smile on her face. It was a very casual smile, and it was very natural and amiable.

Meanwhile, the tiger arrived before her.

She swung her sword.

Bang!

Her attack forcibly stopped the flaming tiger, and her body remained immovable like a mountain.

The Vicious Tiger roared with fury as it madly released all its strength. At this moment, even the starry sky was trembling and rippling, but Destiny still didn’t move at all!

She suddenly smiled, “Watch, this attack is called Sword of Ruin! Everything falls to ruin before this attack!”

She suddenly twisted her right hand.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy flashed through the tiger’s burning body, and she appeared behind it. Meanwhile, the tiger behind her was obliterated!

After instantly killing the tiger, she chuckled, “The next attack is known as World Splitter.”

She turned around and swung a horizontal slash. The heavens and the earth were split before it.

In the distance, the head of the dragon, which was about to attack, just suddenly shot up into the air!

Another instant kill!

She gazed at the last evil beast here, the Ten-Tailed Fox, and said, “You’re the last one.”

As soon as she said that, a scene appeared abruptly before her.

In a mountain crevice, a young boy was tightly hugging a young girl…

A sword howl resounded, and the scene vanished into thin air.

Destiny was behind the fox at this point, “Who can even shake a heart as firm as mine?”

As soon as she finished speaking, the fox’s body started to fall off, layer by layer… A short while later, the fox’s body had transformed into thousands of pieces…

It had been chopped up!

Destiny held Justice between two fingers as she waved it gently, and the blood on it dripped off from its tip.

A short while later, she turned around and gazed at the mysterious expert, “I’ll give you one breath of time to self-detonate!”
