Chapter 2673 – World Explosion!

Needless to say, that person had an extremely unsightly expression on his face.

He’d rushed over here from far away, yet this was the answer he received?

The man was quite unwilling to accept this. He sized up Yang Ye and asked, “Are you really from the End World?”

Yang Ye replied coldly, “Obviously!”

Yang Ye sized up the man as he spoke, “Trash like you have no right to join our End World. Just fuck off or you’ll lose your head.”

The man frowned and felt that something was off.

Suddenly, a voice resounded in the man’s mind, “Brother Wan Qian, he is an enemy of our End World, Yang Ye. Please retreat for now and come back when we’re done with him.”

The man’s face instantly returned to normal upon hearing this.

Wan Qian glanced at Yang Ye, “You’re Yang Ye!”

Yang Ye shrugged. He knew the End World had revealed his identity.

Yang Ye chose to be direct and waved his sword, “Leave before I change my mind.”

Wan Qian grinned, “I’ve heard that the Eternal Kingdom’s Yang Ye is the number one genius in the universe, and I’d like to see for myself.”

As he spoke, he glanced at the teleportation formation, “Divine Abode’s Master, consider his head as my meeting gift to you!”

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded.

Yang Ye shot forward with his sword, and a ray of light flashed.

Wan Qian’s pupils constricted. He reacted very quickly, and a thick golden shield appeared before him.

Half a breath of time later, Yang Ye was behind Wan Qian, and the golden shield suddenly cracked open. A moment later, a drop of blood appeared on Wan Qian’s forehead.

Yang Ye sheathed his sword behind Wan Qian.

Hiss!

Wan Qian’s body split apart at the center!

Yang Ye glanced at the teleportation formation and grinned, “Aren’t I formidable?”

A voice came from within the teleportation formation, “Not bad!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Please provide me with your guidance!”

Suddenly, a man walked out of the teleportation formation.

It was Zuo Mu.

Zuo Mu held the saber’s sheath with his left hand as he walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, and then he suddenly drew it with his right hand upon arriving around 30m before Yang Ye.

One inch!

Hiss!

A ray of saber energy flashed.

It was thin as a hair and swift as a bolt of lightning!

Suddenly, Yang Ye leaped up and swung his sword in midair with both hands.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Hiss!

The sound of something being sliced open resounded as Yang Ye’s sword sliced apart the saber energy.

Meanwhile, Zuo Mu’s saber was drawn by another inch!

Hiss!

A sharp hiss resounded as another ray of saber energy flashed. This time, it was even faster and stronger than the last.

Yang Ye revealed a ferocious grin as he sheathed his sword and instantly drew it.

Heavenrend!

It was the same Heavenrend from before, but he wasn’t the same Yang Ye. Moreover, his sword and sheath weren’t the same either.

Yang Ye’s sword slashed down.

Bang!

Yang Ye was pushed 300m back!

Meanwhile, not only was Zuo Mu not pushed back, he’d even continued forward!

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and smiled, “Amazing! As expected of the former number one expert in the saber!”

Zuo Mu suddenly stopped and shook his head slightly, “My saber was at the top during Qi Bitian’s era, but it wasn’t before that.”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “The era before that?”

Zuo Mu walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, “The era of Destiny, an era where the Heaven Dao existed.”

Zuo Mu’s saber was drawn a few more inches.

Hiss!

Something seemed to be sliced open in the surroundings!

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted as the space before him had been completely sliced open. This saber energy was many times stronger than the last one!

Within it, Yang Ye saw pure energy, extremely overbearing energy that seemed like it could smash apart everything!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly. He didn’t choose to dodge it, nor could he. It was because this attack had locked onto him.

A moment later, Yang Ye drew his sword.

The Domain Sword.

His current attacks were quite monotonous. No, it was wrong to call it monotonous, it was just simple. Elegant techniques were utterly useless against some experts, and the most effective were the simplest and most direct attacks!

A sword howl resounded along with his sword.

Bang!

The space around Yang Ye shook while his figure was pushed back repeatedly. There was a strand of saber energy on the tip of his sword. At this moment, it was gradually dispersing, but even then, the energy it contained pushed Yang Ye back repeatedly!

Yang Ye stopped after being pushed around 300m back. Meanwhile, the saber energy had vanished!

Zuo Mu continued his slow approach toward Yang Ye, “As expected of Heaven Executor. My saber energy cannot shake it at all!”

Yang Ye glanced at his sword. Actually, if it wasn’t for this sword, he would have never been able to stop the saber energy!

Relying on external forces?

No!

Yang Ye felt that he would be a fool not to rely on his treasures right now.

Which era was Zuo Mu from? How many years had Zuo Mu cultivated for? Even if the time he cultivated in the Primordial Pagoda was included, it would be hardly comparable to Zuo Mu!

At a time like this, he would be an idiot not to use his treasures.

Suddenly, Zuo Mu vanished on the spot!

Hiss!

A pitch black spatial rift appeared in the space between Yang Ye and Zuo Mu.

At this moment, Yang Ye sensed unprecedented danger.

Because he saw Zuo Mu draw his saber completely!

At this moment, Zuo Mu had fully drawn his saber!

Yang Ye didn’t dare to act carelessly at all. He drew Heaven Executor and even Past Life!

This time, a vicious glow covered Yang Ye’s face as he pressed the swords together!

When he left the Destiny Realm, the woman in black had taught him how to merge the swords. However, she’d warned him not to do it rashly. His current strength was barely able to control the strength of the two swords!

But he had no choice right now!

Merge!

A sword howl resounded!

A ray of dazzling light flashed down!

Boom!

Crack!

The space throughout the End Dimension started exploding apart inch by inch. At the same time, two figures were blasted away, Yang Ye and Zuo Mu!

Zuo Mu was pushed all the way back to the teleportation formation, and Yang Ye was at the edge of the sky.

Zuo Mu didn’t attack again because Yang Ye had vanished.

Zuo Mu glanced at his right hand as he stood before the teleportation formation. At this moment, it had cracked open. That attack had almost destroyed his entire right arm!

A moment of silence ensued, and then he looked up in the direction that Yang Ye had vanished toward.

Meanwhile, a voice resounded, “Pursue him?”

Zuo Mu shook his head, “I can’t kill him.”

He glanced at the sky as he spoke, and a point in space trembled while cold laughter came from there.

Zuo Mu fell silent for a short while and entered the End World.

At a boundless expanse of space, Yang Ye entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Heal!

While he’d stopped Zuo Mu’s attack, he’d paid quite a huge price to do so!

A very huge price!

It was still quite difficult for him to control the strength of the two swords when they were merged, and Zuo Mu’s final attack had surpassed his expectations!

He wasn’t a match for Zuo Mu now!

Yang Ye was very well aware of that.

If it wasn’t for the armor, he may have died earlier!

The armor!

That armor had endured most of the backlash from his sword, and it had even taken most of the force from Zuo Mu’s attack!

However, Yang Ye had gained something!

He’d gained quite a bit from the battle with Zuo Mu. He was able to use battles with such experts to discover his own flaws, and so long as he could do that, he would be able to improve!

Of course, the important matter at hand was to heal!

Two hours later, Yang Ye had fully recuperated.

Meanwhile, Snowy appeared before him.

She gazed at Yang Ye with a smile on her face, and she had her paws hidden behind her back.

Yang Ye pinched her little cheeks and smiled, “Go on, do you have good news?”

Snowy nodded repeatedly, and then she flipped her paws to reveal a gourd.

The Sword Gourd!

Yang Ye glanced at it and was stunned.

It was still the same Sword Gourd, but it wasn’t a divine treasure anymore, it was a Super Divine Treasure!

He sensed a wisp of inconceivable energy within the Sword Gourd.

Snowy cracked a smile and passed it to him.

Yang Ye gazed at her, “You did this?”

Snowy nodded.

Meanwhile, Sword Scroll appeared by his side. She glanced at Snowy and smiled, “She has been working hard on ascending the Sword Gourd’s spirit lately. She has improved it to its limits now.”

Yang Ye gazed at Snowy, and his heart felt warm as he gazed at the smile on her face. He rubbed her head gently and said, “Thank you, little fellow!”

Divine treasures weren’t really useful to him anymore, and it could be said that only Super Divine Treasures were barely useful to him.

Now that the Sword Gourd had advanced into the ranks of Super Divine Treasures, he could use his flying sword technique again.

Meanwhile, Snowy suddenly grabbed Yang Ye’s hand and pulled him to the side.

Sword Scroll frowned slightly. No one knew what she was thinking.

Yang Ye was growing faster and faster, and his enemies were growing increasingly stronger. Many of the divine treasures and Super Divine Treasures which used to stay by his side were actually unable to keep up with him.

It was the same for her!

Even though she hadn’t been left behind yet, she knew that it wouldn’t take long!

Meanwhile, Snowy brought Yang Ye to a mountain range, and furious shouts were resounding incessantly from there.

It was Erya’s voice!

Along with every shout, the mountain range would shake violently.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to see Erya. She was bent forward with her right claw against the ground while her other claw was pointed toward the sky.

A moment of silence ensued before Erya suddenly howled, “Six Crushers! 1st Move! World Explosion!”

Erya suddenly clawed with her right claw.

Bang!

In an instant, the entire mountain range started trembling, and then Yang Ye and Snowy watched with astonishment as she actually lifted it up…

The entire mountain range was being lifted up!

Yang Ye could clearly sense that it was rising!

“What the heck…” Yang Ye gazed at Erya with disbelief.

Snowy’s eyes were opened wide as well, but her eyes were full of joy and excitement!
