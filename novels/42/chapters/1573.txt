Chapter 1574 - I’m Willing To Give Her Anything She Likes!

Translator: InVader

Yang Ye and the woman were stunned when they heard Little Sky, and then they exchanged glances. In the end, Yang Ye gazed at Little Sky, “That… that isn’t true, right?”

Little Sky shrugged, “I don’t know. It isn’t important anyway.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Little Sky gazed at Snowy and spoke softly, “You’re in the eye of a storm, and it’s very dangerous. She too will be in danger if she stays with you. Letting her stay here is for the best! Of course, it’s mainly your decision. Because only you can make her stay.”

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then he said, “I don’t trust Sprite Palace!”

The woman gazed at Yang Ye, “We’re not like you humans. So long as someone joins Sprite Palace, we’re all like family, and we won’t try to fight and kill each other!”

Meanwhile, Little Sky suddenly added, “How about this? I’ll guarantee that both she and Little Sky Flame will be safe here!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “You can’t fight, so how will you guarantee that?!”

Little Sky answered, “I can tell Little Little Sky and the others to protect them.”

Yang Ye replied, “Can you tell Little Little Sky and the others to protect me too?”

Little Sky rolled her eyes at him, “You wish.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Little Sky, try to be a little more impartial.”

Little Sky replied, “You’re not like them. They are sprites nurtured by this world, so they are protected by the heavens. But you are a human, and you have too much karma coiled around you. If Little Little Sky and the others try to protect you, it would definitely make many try to defy the heavens.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Little Sky continued, “I know how you feel about them, and I’m merely giving you a suggestion. You can decide if they stay here or with you.”

Yang Ye looked up towards the distance. At this moment, Little Sky Flame and Snowy had fully assimilated into the group of Sprite Kings. Snowy seemed extremely happy while being surrounded by the Sprite Kings. As for the Sprite Kings there, they were clearly very fond of Snowy and Little Sky Flame. They revealed no fear towards Snowy; all they revealed was fondness.

Besides that, Snowy didn’t just absorb their energy as she pleased, and she even frequently created some spirit energy and gave it to those Sprite Kings. At this moment, those Sprite Kings were the happiest. However, once they finished absorbing the spirit energy Snowy gave them, they created various different types of energies and gave them to Snowy.

Snowy wasn’t taking it by force, and it was they who were willingly giving it to her!

A smile curled up on Yang Ye’s face as he watched Snowy for a long time. He walked slowly towards Snowy. The other Sprite Kings immediately surrounded Snowy when they saw Yang Ye approaching, and their eyes were filled with vigilance. Meanwhile, Snowy flashed over to Yang Ye, and then she grabbed Yang Ye’s hand and went over to those Sprite Kings with him.

Snowy was introducing Yang Ye to them, and she was introducing them to Yang Ye as well.

After Snowy explained things, the vigilance those Sprite Kings had for Yang Ye gradually vanished. However, they didn’t get close to him. They were still quite wary of humans. Or it should be said that besides other sprites and Sprite Kings, they were wary of all other things.

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head and smiled, “Snowy, stay here with Little Sky Flame from now on, alright?”

Snowy nodded. Suddenly, she seemed to have thought of something, and then she gazed at Yang Ye and pointed at him. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Obviously, she was asking — What about you?

Yang Ye smiled, “I’ll come to visit frequently. I…”

Suddenly, Snowy transformed into a ray of light that entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye’s face froze. It didn’t take long for his consciousness to enter the pagoda and find Snowy. At this moment, Snowy’s claws were clenched tightly together as she stared at him without blinking. Moreover, she seemed to be on the verge of tears, and she looked like Yang Ye didn’t want her anymore.

Yang Ye embraced Snowy and spoke softly, “Silly. I didn’t say we’re going our separate ways. I meant that you can play with them here, and then come look for me when you want. Understand?”

Yang Ye paused for a moment before he continued, “Besides that, did you notice that all of them are so strong. You can play with them and make them obey you, so once someone bullies me in the future, you can tell them to help me fight off my enemies. Alright?”

Snowy blinked and seemed visibly moved by this.

Yang Ye held Snowy in his arms and spoke seriously, “You can play with them, and you can come look for me at any time. So long as you want to, you can stay here or with me. Understand?”

Snowy gave it some thought, and it didn’t take long for her to start waving her claws. She did so extremely quickly.

Yang Ye who was an expert in talking with beasts naturally understood her. Snowy was saying that she wanted to help him, but she didn’t want to be separated from him.

Yang Ye smiled, “How about we do this? Besides when I have matters to attend to, I’ll stay here with you. If you miss me, you can come look for me as well. In any case, you can locate me. Alright?”

He didn’t want to be separated from her, but he had a stronger desire to keep her safe.

Even though his life was very peaceful right now, he was very well aware that a storm was coming. Snowy was really not safe with him. But if Snowy stayed here, these Sprite Kings would protect her, and coupled with Little Sky’s guarantee, Snowy would be safe even if something happened to him. He didn’t believe the woman in a red dress, he believed Little Sky.

Since Little Sky had guaranteed it, then Snowy would definitely be very safe! Besides that, Snowy was really happy here. Even though he knew that she would definitely come with him if he wanted it, he hoped that she would stay. It was too dangerous to stay by his side, and he really didn’t have much time to play with her.

It didn’t take long for Snowy to agree to stay.

However, she had a condition. Yang Ye had to come back whenever he was free, and she could go see Yang Ye whenever she wanted.

The woman in a red dress was quite hesitant to agree to that. Obviously, she didn’t want Snowy to have anything to do with Yang Ye. As far as she was concerned, Yang Ye was human. However, it didn’t take long for her to have no objections. Because if she refused to agree, then Snowy wouldn’t hesitate to go with Yang Ye. Even though she liked it here, she liked Yang Ye more.

Besides Snowy and Little Sky Flame, Yang Ye left behind all the young flames he’d obtained at Phoenix Domain. They would only be able to grow better in Sprite Palace. Actually, Yang Ye had only handed them over because of Snowy. He’d given all of them to Snowy, so once they grew, he had no doubt that they would be Snowy’s trusted subordinates.

He knew that the Sprite Palace wasn’t that complicated. But he still wanted life to be better and safer for Snowy, and he wanted her to possess a better status in Sprite Palace.

Yang Ye’s actions clearly made the Sprite Palace have a good impression of him, so the woman gave Yang Ye five Energy Pearls!

Moreover, the spirit energy within the Energy Pearls were even purer than the Energy Pearls he obtained within the Ominous Territory!

If these five were included, he had a total of twelve now!

Obviously, it was equivalent to twelve extra lives! It represented his life and the lives of others!

Before he left, Yang Ye gave Snowy the Spirit Pearl that contained the spirit energy of a large world. What did Snowy like the most? Spirit energy! That Spirit Pearl contained the spirit energy of an entire large world, so Snowy just had to work hard, and she would definitely be able to grow swiftly!

Snowy clearly liked the Spirit Pearl very much, and she kept rubbing and kissing it.

The expression of the woman in a red dress changed when she saw the Spirit Pearl that Yang Ye gave Snowy. Obviously, she’d discerned what it was, and she took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye before she said, “Thank you!”

“Of course you should thank him!” Little Sky spoke softly, “In Snowy’s hands, that pearl will be able to make your Sprite Palace’s strength rise by at least a level.”

She gazed at Yang Ye at this point and continued, “You actually gave it away. After all, that may be the only Spirit Pearl in our universe.”

Yang Ye smiled and rubbed Snowy’s head, “So long as I have it, and she likes it, then I’m willing to give it to her.”

When she heard this, Snowy’s gaze moved away from the pearl, and then she flew over to Yang Ye, wrapped her arms around his head, and rubbed her head against him.

Meanwhile, the woman in a red dress spoke abruptly, “If you encounter danger in the future, you can come here. You’ll be safe here.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course!”

He believed her because there were numerous Sprite Kings here. If they joined forces, they could really change this world. Moreover, Little Sky seemed to really care about this place. She couldn’t fight, but if someone attacked these Sprite Kings, she would definitely not stand by idly.

There was no need for many. Just around 100 Eyes of the Heaven Dao would probably make even that mysterious power shrink back with fear! After all, 100 Eyes of the Heaven Dao were no joke! Moreover, Little Sky may be able to summon even more!

After that day, Yang Ye started living in the Sprite Palace. Besides cultivating, he accompanied Snowy every day. Meanwhile, Snowy had fully overcome her trauma. She was truly happy here. Because all the Sprite Kings here would play with her and stay by her side.

That was actually very normal. After all, they were her own kind!

Yang Ye noticed that Snowy grew extremely swiftly while in the presence of these Sprite Kings. Similarly, the Sprite Kings grew extremely quickly while in her presence. Those Sprite Kings weren’t the only ones, even the woman in a red dress frequently spent time with Snowy, and she frequently gave her own fire element energy to Snowy.

They supplemented and restrained each other.

That was the relationship between the Sprite Lord and Sprite Kings. Of course, it was a comparatively realistic way to describe it. Because regardless of whether it was Snowy or those Sprite Kings, they had no intention to use each other. Their way of thinking was actually quite pure. Perhaps it was because they hadn’t really come into contact with the outside world!

On the third day of his stay in Sprite Palace, Yang Ye suddenly got a voice transmission from Ding Shaoyao — “An Nanjing is in danger! Hurry to the Martial Tomb!”
