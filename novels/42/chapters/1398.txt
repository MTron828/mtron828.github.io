Chapter 1399 – An Overlapped Heavenrend!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to stop, and then he placed his hand on the hilt of his sword.

The expressions of everyone here changed drastically at the sight of this.

Skyriver City had been destroyed by just 2 swings of Yang Ye’s sword, and he was about to draw his sword again! So, how could they not be afraid? How could they not be terrified?

Suddenly, the grey robed old man shouted coldly, “Stay calm!”

His voice was like a thunderclap that shook their eardrums to the point sharp pain came from them. However, they did calm down quite a bit because of it.

The grey robed old man gazed at Yang Ye and spoke solemnly, “You’re Yang Ye, right?”

Yang Ye didn’t speak. He started to walk towards the grey robed old man’s group. At the same time, a strand of terrifying sword intent slammed down upon them.

The grey robed old man was horrified and hurriedly said, “Yang Ye, the Deities of my Skyriver Stellar Region are on the way here. You might be able to live if you leave right now. Otherwise, it’ll soon be too late for you to leave.’

“Deities?” Yang Ye stopped, and then his sword intent surged back into him.

The grey robed old man heaved a sigh of relief. He knew that Yang Ye was afraid of Deities, and he hurriedly said, “Of course, the Deities of my Skyriver Stellar Region are rushing back as we speak. Based on their speed, it’ll take 2 hours at most for them to arrive. You can preserve your life if you leave right now. Otherwise, you’ll die a graveless death once they arrive!”

Yang Ye spoke coldly, “Are you trying to scare me?”

“Scare you?” The grey robed old man spoke coldly, “Yang Ye, if you don’t believe me, then attack. We’ll keep you here even if all of us have to die here today, and you’ll die a graveless death once the experts of our alliance arrive!”

Yang Ye remained silent.

Meanwhile, the grey robed old man continued, “Yang Ye, I admit that your strength is heaven defying indeed, but can you fight a Deity? Even if you can fight one, can you fight four? Can you resist the joint forces of 4 Deities? If you don’t want to die, then it’s best if you leave right now!”

If he had a choice, he would hope that Yang Ye stayed. Because once the Deity arrived, then Yang Ye would definitely die. However, he didn’t dare to make Yang Ye stay. Because Yang Ye was too terrifying. If he was allowed to continue attacking them, then countless here would die before the Deity could even get there!

So, he had no choice but to scare Yang Ye away.

Yang Ye seemed to have been scared by him. Yang Ye remained silent on the spot for over a dozen breaths of time, and then he transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

All of them heaved sighs of relief at the sight of this.

The grey robed old man heaved a sigh of relief as well. Not to mention those Semi-Deities who’d lost their lives earlier, even he couldn’t resist that attack of Yang Ye’s. Now that Yang Ye had left, his tense nerves had finally relaxed. He’d been constantly afraid that Yang Ye would draw his sword, so he’d been extremely tense just now!

Fortunately, he’d succeeded at scaring Yang Ye away!

The others here exchanged glances, and then they couldn’t help but smile. It was a smile from surviving calamity.

Because they thought Yang Ye had been scared away, they dispersed their energy which was fortifying the space around them, causing it to return to normal.

“Something is off....” Suddenly, the grey robed old man frowned, “Yang Ye is absolutely not that cowardly. He wouldn’t just be scared away because of a few words. He....”

The old man seemed to have thought of something, and his eyes opened wide as he quickly shouted, “Yang Ye hasn’t left! Quickly fortify the space around us...!”

Om!

Suddenly, a sword howl interrupted the old man, and then a beam of sword energy flashed out from a distant point in space and entered their group.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then a Semi-Deity was obliterated. At the same time, the powerful aftershock of the collision blasted all the others around 10km away. Moreover, some Emperors were even killed by the impact!

Yang Ye hadn’t left!

All of them were horrified!

Meanwhile, the grey robed old man’s anxious voice resounded, “Stay calm! Stay calm and join forces!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Om!

Meanwhile, another beam of sword energy emerged from a point in space, and then another Semi- Deity vanished on the spot.

This time, all of them weren’t able to calm down no matter what. They started fleeing madly in all directions, and this even included some Voiders.

Yang Ye had killed Semi-Deities in an instant!

Yang Ye had instantly killed 2 Semi-Deities right in front of their eyes!

Just thinking about it caused a chill to run down their spines. At this moment, they just wanted to run as far away as they could and avoid that god of death!

It didn’t take long for only 7 Semi-Deities and some Voiders to remain here. As for the Emperors, they’d fled.

At this moment, Yang Ye had vanished as well, and it was like he’d never even made an appearance here.

The 7 Semi-Deities had horrifyingly gloomy expressions on their faces.

They hadn’t expected Yang Ye to come back and even kill 2 Semi-Deities in an instant!

That attack was too strong, and it was so strong that even Semi-Deities couldn’t resist it!

The grey robed old man spoke solemnly, “How long will it take for our reinforcements to arrive?”

A short moment of silence ensued before an old man said, “An hour at most.”

The grey robed old man frowned, “That long?”

The old man who spoke earlier shook his head and said., “Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region is too far away from both our stellar region and Stellar City. If we have the Dimensional Teleportation Flags, then it would take around 10 minutes at most for them to get back here. However, it seems like it was Yang Ye who took them as well.”

Yang Ye!

The grey robed old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “He’s an extraordinary genius. If he’s allowed to grow, then our stellar region is finished.”

The others nodded when they heard him. Yang Ye’s natural talent was too terrifying. If he was allowed to continue growing, then crushing the Alliance of Guardians would probably just take a few swings of his sword in the future. After all, Yang Ye was only an Emperor right now, but he could kill Semi-Deities. Moreover, based on the heaven defying strength he possessed, he was probably capable of fighting Deities!

Once he attained the Voider Realm, even Deities may not dare to fight him head-on!

Meanwhile, one of the old men asked, “What do we do now?”

“Wait!” The grey robed old man closed his eyes slowly, “We can do nothing but wait!”

If Yang Ye chose to fight them head-on, then they would actually not fear him. At the very least, they would dare to risk their lives and fight him. However, the problem was that he refused to fight them directly. He was like a ghost that hid within space, and then frequently appeared to swing his sword a few times before immediately leaving. The most terrifying part was that no one here could withstand that attack of his!

So, they could only wait until their reinforcements arrived!

...

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was hiding underground. The 2 Heavenrends he just executed and the 2 more he’d previously executed had completely exhausted his profound energy.

However, all of that wasn’t a huge problem for him right now. Because there was no one pursuing him, and it only took a few hours for him to recover both his physical strength and profound energy.

...

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged while divine crystals surrounded him. The divine crystals were burning, and countless strands of spirit energy emerged from them and surged into him.

Actually, Yang Ye liked fighting and running like this. However, he’d always been on the defensive in the past. So, he could only go head-on against his enemies and couldn’t flee. Yet now, he was attacking, so the decision to attack was in his hands.

Since he had the Sword Domain, Blink, and the Laws of Space, he merely had to flee or hide himself, and then even Deities wouldn’t be able to do anything to him. Of course, so long as he showed himself, then the strength and reaction of Deities would be sufficient to instantly force him out of hiding. So, he didn’t dare act carelessly when facing Deities!

Actually, that Deity he’d killed the other day couldn’t really be considered as something he’d accomplished. He’d utilized the Sword God’s Seal, stellar energy, and the advantage he had because the old man was close to him and had underestimated him. That was why he’d been able to land a strike on the old man. But even then, he still hadn’t been able to instantly kill the old man!

So, it clearly showed how strong Deities were!

If a true Deity didn’t act carelessly, underestimate him, or go head on against his Heavenrend, then he would be helpless against the Deity. His Heavenrend had extraordinary explosive strength, and it was extremely swift too. However, Deities were even faster, so they could dodge it.

But Deities were usually proud. It would be different if they faced cultivators at the same realm of cultivation. However, if they were facing an Emperor, then many wouldn’t choose to dodge because it was a humiliation.

For example, Jian Xu could have dodged Yang Ye’s Heavenrend, but he hadn’t and had chosen to go head-on against it. Jian Xu was strong, so he’d been able to forcefully withstand it. That Deity Yang Ye encountered in the Radiant Dimension had chosen to do the same, but he hadn’t been able to withstand it!

If one’s strength was lacking, then don’t make a show of strength!

...

2 days later, Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye immediately left the ground and snuck towards the ruins of Skyriver River.

He naturally didn’t intend to stop. He wanted to make blood flow into rivers!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive where the grey robed old man and the others had been, but there was no one there.

Yang Ye frowned. Meanwhile, the space around him suddenly started to tremble violently.

An ambush! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He knew that he’d been discovered, and only a Deity could accomplish that.

“You really did choose to come back again!” Suddenly, a voice resounded, and then a violet robed old man walked out of space from afar. The grey robed old man’s group were behind the violet robed old man.

A Deity!

The violet robed old man waved his right hand, and then the surrounding space instantly calmed down, “If you didn’t return, then it would really be difficult for me to locate you with your ability in concealment. Unfortunately, you chose to return. I’ve done something to the space here, so as soon as you returned, I immediately....”

The violet robed old man’s voice stopped abruptly because Yang Ye had suddenly transformed into a ray of light that shot towards him.

Yang Ye was extremely swift. Coupled with the fact that he’d launched the first attack, he’d been able to instantly arrive above the violet robed old man. A wisp of ferocity flashed through his eyes while the Sword God’s Seal emanated a ray of dazzling light on his forehead. His sword intent instantly grew numerous times stronger before he swiftly drew his sword and swung it!

Yang Ye didn’t stop after he drew his sword and swung it once, and he swiftly sheathed his sword before drawing it and swinging it once more.

Because he’d completed these attacks extremely quickly, the 2 Heavenrends he’d executed had overlapped together!

Two Heavenrends overlapped over each other!
