Chapter 2232 – A Flip of the Palm!

The battle was growing even more intense.

At this moment, Yang Ye was covered in injuries.

A long time later.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded through the simulated battlefield, and then the entire battlefield collapsed.

It was obliterated!

The surroundings fell silent.

Bang!

Meanwhile, a figure slammed down before An Nanjing and Ding Shaoyao.

It was Yang Ye’s figure.

At this moment, he wasn’t injured, but his countenance was absolutely pale.

He was beyond exhausted!

While it was just a simulation, it was a huge amount of consumption for him. It was consumption of the mind and soul.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing spoke softly, “He succeeded.”

The outcome of the battle wasn’t important, what was important was that Yang Ye had proved himself. Even without treasures, he was still the same Yang Ye!

That was enough!

His Sword Heart had been fortified, and his Sword Core had condensed!

Yang Ye didn’t open his eyes. He was in a meditative state right now.

It hadn’t just been a battle to him, it had fortified his Sword Heart and helped him condense his Sword Core!

Ding Shaoyao and An Nanjing didn’t disturb Yang Ye, and moved aside instead. Meanwhile, An Nanjing said, “Do I need to do like he did?”

Ding Shaoyao shook her head slightly, “You don’t rely on treasures, so you don’t need to fortify your Martial Dao Heart and Martial Core! But he is different, he has used too many treasures throughout these years, and they have more or less affected him. The objective of this was to make his Sword Heart even more solid. Now, it seems like he succeeded.”

An Nanjing glanced at Ding Shaoyao and said, “You made a mistake!”

Ding Shaoyao gazed at An Nanjing.

An Nanjing spoke softly, “If you needed Snowy, you could have just asked, and he would have lent her to you. After all, your god race had no intent to harm her. However, you did that when he was at his most difficult. As far as he’s concerned, that’s no different than betrayal. He’s a very loyal person, and it’s to people he considers his own. But he’s a ruthless person too.”

Ding Shaoyao didn’t say anything.

An Nanjing didn’t speak more either.

Just like that, they waited in silence.

Two hours later, Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes and stood up slowly.

An Nanjing asked, “How are you feeling?”

How I’m feeling? Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly. It felt really strange, really strange indeed. It was like he’d been reborn from the fire.

His Sword Heart had been improved, and his Sword Core had been condensed!

Yang Ye stretched out his hand slowly. In an instant, a strand of sword intent appeared out of thin air. A smile curled up on his face as he gazed at it. It wasn’t at the Progenitor Realm, but it wasn’t what it used to be. Or to be more precise, his improvement wasn’t just in sword intent and cultivation, it was an improvement in the Sword Dao.

He was much more confident now. In the past, even he felt that it was difficult for himself to defeat a progenitor without treasures. Yet now, even if he didn’t use all of that, he was confident in his ability to defeat a progenitor. As for if he did use them, he would be even more confident.

The improvements in his Sword Dao that he’d attained today had laid the foundation for his future advancement in the Sword Dao.

Now, his slaughter intent was at the peak of the Progenitor Realm, and his sword intent was just a step away from it. Besides that, he had the Sword Domain and Enlightened Sword Heart. If he used the Sword Supreme, it could instantly raise his sword intent. After all, his slaughter intent couldn’t even suppress his sword intent while he held the Sword Supreme. So, once he used it, it represented that he possessed both Progenitor Realm slaughter intent and sword intent. Coupled with the special ability of the Sword Supreme, his combat strength would rise a level higher.

He’d gained tremendously!

Yang Ye gazed at Ding Shaoyao and An Nanjing, “Let’s go!”

An Nanjing nodded slightly and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Train!

The reason she hadn’t gone to train earlier was because she had to protect Yang Ye. Now that Yang Ye had regained consciousness, she wanted to test the treasures she’d obtained.

Ding Shaoyao led Yang Ye to the hall from before, and Shi Tian was waiting there.

Shi Tian glanced at Yang Ye, “Congratulations!”

Yang Ye didn’t say anything, and he just waved his right hand, a strand of Primordial Violet Energy surged incessantly toward Shi Tian. Shi Tian absorbed everything he received from Yang Ye, and Snowy appeared by Yang Ye’s side at the same time. Under his instructions, Snowy released countless strands of spirit energy to Shi Tian.

They were helping him heal!

That was his deal with the god race!

Help Shi Tian heal!

Shi Tian madly absorbed the Primordial Violet Energy and the spirit energy from Snowy. Just like that, around four hours passed before they stopped.

Shi Tian took a deep breath, and an invisible aura seeped out from him, and the space in the surroundings shook violently.

Meanwhile, Shi Tian opened his eyes and waved his right hand. In an instant, the pressure vanished without a trace.

Yang Ye said, “Congratulations!”

Shi Tian glanced at Yang Ye, “I’ve only recovered by 80%, there’s nothing to be happy about.”

80%!

Yang Ye asked, “Do you need more?”

Shi Tian shook his head, “Being able to recover up to 80% is good enough. I have to slowly recover for the rest. It can’t be rushed.”

He flicked a scroll to Yang Ye as he spoke.

Yang Ye asked, “What is that?”

Shi Tian explained, “A teleportation scroll. If your Void Spirit Continent is in danger, crush it and I’ll be there. Of course, if they discover my god race, please lend us a hand!”

Yang Ye asked, “Are we just going to wait until death arrives?”

“Wait until death arrives?” Shi Tian shook his head slightly, “Being able to think like that proves you’re really brave! However, what else can we do now? Attack them instead? Go to their home world? Not to mention all of that, just their undying cavalries are beyond us. Even if we can crush them, we’ll probably pay a terrible price. Not to mention that the undying race still has other experts!”

Yang Ye asked, “Then wait for them to come?”

Shi Tian fell silent for a long time and said, “Let’s discuss it when the time comes, alright?”

Yang Ye nodded, and he just took Snowy and walked away.

Meanwhile, Shi Tian said, “Shaoyao, send him off for me!”

Ding Shaoyao nodded slightly, but Yang Ye suddenly said, “That isn’t necessary!”

He vanished from the hall once he finished speaking.

Ding Shaoyao fell silent in the hall.

Shi Tian spoke softly, “Shaoyao, has the undying race made any movements lately?”

She shook her head slightly, “After they were stopped outside Void Spirit Continent, they retreated to the prehistoric ruins. They seem to be recuperating now.”

Shi Tian asked, “What about the endless black holes?”

Ding Shaoyao shook her head, “We can’t get close. It leads to the undying race’s home world, so it’s heavily guarded. All of our forces that get close are annihilated in an instant! So, we can’t get inside at all.”

Shi Tian spoke solemnly, “Why aren’t they coming over here then?”

Ding Shaoyao thought for a moment and replied, “Perhaps there’s some kind of reason that’s stopping them. Or perhaps they fear something?”

“Fear something?” Shi Tian gazed at her, “What do you mean?”

Ding Shaoyao shook her head, “It’s just a guess!”

Shi Tian spoke softly, “No matter what, we have to be careful. The slightest mistake may result in our annihilation!”

Ding Shaoyao nodded and didn’t say anything else.

…

Yang Ye left the God Realm. He’d gained a lot in this trip, and he wasn’t the only one, An Nanjing had gained quite a bit too. She’d obtained Elyzium and Elyxium, allowing her strength to rise a level higher. Of course, she was extremely strong even without them. After all, she didn’t really rely on treasures.

Void Spirit Continent!

As soon as Yang Ye returned to Void Spirit Continent, a wave of monstrous pressure enveloped the continent. It was extremely strong, even stronger than some progenitors!

Everyone on the continent was shocked and looked up.

Is the undying race here?

Yang Ye frowned slightly. He tapped his right foot down and shot up into the air in a flash of blood red. He arrived in the sky above the continent, and a ferocious beast wasn’t too far away from him!

It was naturally the Demonspawn from the Initial Continent!

The Demonspawn glanced at Yang Ye and said, “You’re Yang Ye?”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “I am, and you?”

The Demonspawn grinned gloomily, “Give it a guess!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “The undying race?”

“The undying race?” The Demonspawn laughed with ridicule, “What trash is that? I’m a Demonspawn, one from the initial civilization’s time. Do you know what a Demonspawn is?”

Yang Ye asked, “A demon beast?”

“Demon beast?!” The Demonspawn was furious, “Demonspawn! Do you know what a Demonspawn is? I’m not something those lowly demon beasts can compare to!”

Yang Ye said, “Are you from the undying race or not?!”

“I’m not!” The Demonspawn howled with rage, “How can trash like that compare to me?! I’m…”

“What did you say?” Yang Ye suddenly interrupted it, “You called the undying race trash? Are you kidding me? You probably wouldn’t even have the chance to fight back against them! Their strength will instill despair in you!”

“Nonsense!” The Demonspawn glared angrily at Yang Ye, “Kid, do you know what a Demonspawn is? You…” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Nonsense?” Yang Ye interrupted it again, “Then do you dare to come with me to the undying race. Let me see how strong you really are, or perhaps you were just boasting!”

“Let’s go then!” The Demonspawn glared at Yang Ye, “I’ll annihilate those fools with a flip of my palm.”

“Come, let’s go now!” Yang Ye vanished into the sky once he finished speaking, and the Demonspawn immediately followed him.
