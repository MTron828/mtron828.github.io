Chapter 109 – You’re Unbeatable!

This plain was boundlessly huge. Yang Ye rode on the dashing nether wolf king for four hours yet was still unable to leave this plain and coupled the fact that the amount of Darkbeasts pursuing them was growing in number, Yang Ye’s expression turned gloomy.

It wasn’t just behind them; numerous black spots had even appeared in the sky. Obviously, these black dots were summoned by the Spirit Rank Darkbeast to watch them. Even though the violet mink could deal with these flying Darkbeasts, it was utterly useless. Because no matter how many they killed, the Spirit Rank Darkbeast would immediately send even more over, and they were simply endless in number.

“Little Brother, the situation seems to be slightly bad!” Right when Yang Ye was feeling troubled, the woman behind him spoke with a smile on her face, and her tone didn’t carry even a trace of anxiousness and even carried a faint feeling of taking pleasure in Yang Ye’s misfortune.

Yang Ye turned around and glared fiercely at the woman before he said angrily, “You know the situation is bad? Isn’t all of this because of you? For god’s sake, you’re a member of the Grand Qin Empire’s imperial household at any rate, so could it be that you don’t have any method to get out of this situation?”

Yang Ye absolutely refused to believe that she didn’t possess any trump cards to save her own life because the colossus which was the imperial household of the Grand Qin Empire wasn’t inferior to the Origin School at all.

The woman blinked, and then she revealed a pitiable appearance and said timidly, “Little Brother, I’m only a weak woman, so how could I have any way out of this situation? I can only rely on Little Brother’s protection, so I hope Little Brother can take pity on me!”

Yang Ye frowned and said, “Can you not try that on me? Also, can you stop calling me ‘little brother’?”

The words ‘little brother’ truly made him feel slightly uncomfortable.

“Alright, Little Brother!” The woman chuckled as she spoke.

Yang Ye took a deep breath before he said calmly, “Tell me, their main intentions are to capture you, so would those human cavalries let me go if I hand you over to them?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

He wasn’t afraid of Darkbeasts, and he was only afraid of those human cavalries. Or more precisely speaking, he was afraid of the colossus which was the Grand Qin Empire. Because its forces in the southern territory were something that no one could avoid fearing.

The woman smiled and said, “If you did that earlier, then I’m not sure if the Darkbeasts would let you off, but those members of the Palace Guard would probably let you go. However, they will definitely not let you go now!”

“Why?” Yang Ye was puzzled.

The corners of the woman’s mouth raised slightly while a charming smile arose on her face. She said, “Because they definitely think that we’re in this together now. Mmm, to put it more precisely, they think that we’ve eloped! Even though my status in the imperial household isn’t very high, I’m a member of the imperial household at any rate. So, do you think the members of the imperial household would permit me to elope with someone?

“Besides that, the objective of my journey this time was to get married, and the other party is the second son of the Beast Emperor of Darkbeast Empire. If he finds out that his fiancée had eloped with someone, then as a man, do you think he would let you go? Let Big Sister tell you a secret, he’s an expert at the Spirit Realm! Right, those Darkbeasts behind us are against the attainment of peace through marriage. So, do you think they would let you go after you took me away? In short, Big Sister must congratulate you. Because you’ve done something that many people are afraid of doing or even thinking about, you’ve offended both the Grand Qin Empire and the Darkbeast Empire at the same time!”

After he heard the woman, Yang Ye didn’t fly into a rage as the woman had imagined, and he pondered deeply with a calm expression instead.

In all honesty, Yang Ye was extremely furious at this moment. After all, all of this was caused by the woman behind him. He wasn’t a saint, so he was naturally angry. If it was possible, then he would have sliced the woman into pieces and then flogged her corpse. However, what was the point of anger now? Could he fight the woman behind him? Or perhaps surrender to the people behind him and hand the woman over?

If all of this was possible, then he wouldn’t hesitate to do it. However, it wasn’t. In other words, being angry now was of utterly no use. So, instead of getting angry, it was better to think of a practical method. Of course, he wouldn’t let the woman off in the future because he, Yang Ye, was no fool that others could toy with at will.

However, he had to first think of a method to escape those people behind him!

“Why aren’t you angry?” Meanwhile, the woman behind Yang Ye spoke with slight curiosity. According to her expectations, Yang Ye should be infuriated or at least curse at her. However, Yang Ye seemed to be so calm, and it was as if he hadn’t heard her at all. This caused her to be slightly curious and puzzled.

Yang Ye didn’t answer her, and he turned around to look at her instead before he said in a serious tone, “I don’t care about your status in the Grand Qin Empire. All I want to say is that we’re in the same boat now. So, if we don’t join forces and work together, then there’ll only be calamity waiting for us. I’ve already done my best and utilized my trump cards to escape them. I think you should chip in as well!”

The woman restrained her smile when she heard this, and then she cracked a smile after a while and said, “Little Brother, you’re right. However, Big Sister really doesn’t have any trump cards. Don’t start glaring at Big Sister first, Big Sister hasn’t finished speaking! Even though Big Sister doesn’t have any trump cards, Big Sister has a method to escape all of them!”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “What method?”

The woman smiled and said, “Ask your beast king to dash towards the right because there’s an ancient ruin 500km away from here. That ruin was where the previous empire resided, and there are vengeful spirits and various formations of the precious empire there. Those Palace Guards and Darkbeasts would be helpless against us as long as we enter the ruins!”

“Ruins?” Yang Ye frowned and said, “Wouldn’t they just follow us in?”

The woman rolled her eyes at Yang Ye and said, “If we hide around the ruins after we enter it, then would they still be able to find us? Moreover, it’s filled with danger, so if so many of them enter it, then at least half of them would perish within. I don’t know about the Darkbeasts, but the leader of the Palace Guards, Jiang Lin, wouldn’t dare to allow the Palace Guards to enter. At the very most, he would enter himself with two formidable subordinates by his side!”

“How do you know about that ruins?” asked Yang Ye. He was naturally unable to fully believe the woman before him because one should always stay vigilant against the malicious intent of others!

The woman glanced at Yang Ye as if she was looking at an idiot, and then she said, “Little Brother, are you really a disciple of a sect?”

“What has that got to do with anything?” Yang Ye frowned as he asked this question.

The woman slapped herself on the forehead and said, “Because that ruin is a place where the disciples of the sects temper themselves. The disciples of all the six great powers of the southern territory and my Grand Qin Empire head to those ruins to temper themselves. Even though it’s dangerous, it’s similarly filled with fortuitous encounters. Because many people have found numerous high rank cultivation techniques and combat techniques there.”

When she spoke up to here, she paused for a moment and said, “Little Brother, are you not a disciple of the Sword Sect?”

Yang Ye was pondering whether the ruins were reliable when he suddenly heard this question, and he was first stunned before he shook his head and said, “I’m not a disciple of the Sword Sect. Let’s go to the ruins. At any rate, we don’t have any other way to escape our pursuers.”

The woman’s eyes lit up when she heard Yang Ye, and then she spoke with slight wonder. “You aren’t a disciple of the Sword Sect? But your sword technique....”

“I said I’m not a disciple of the Sword Sect, it’s up to you whether you believe it or not!” Yang Ye spoke in a slightly angry manner. As soon as he finished speaking, he ordered the nether wolf beneath him to change the direction it was heading and dash towards the right.

The woman seemed to be extremely interested in Yang Ye’s background, and she asked. “Little Brother, since you aren’t a disciple of the Sword Sect, then you’re most probably a disciple of the Origin School?”

“I don’t belong to a sect!” Yang Ye spoke in an indifferent tone.

The woman spoke with a puzzled tone. “Little Brother, with your natural talent and strength, you even have the qualifications to enter the Origin School. So, why don’t you have a sect?”

“Does this have anything to do with you?”

“Of course it does. I’m eloping with you right now. In other words, you’re my man now. At the very least, you are, in name. So, how could it not be related to me?”

Yang Ye. “....”

A long time later, the woman figured a single thing out, this man before her didn’t have a sect, and this caused the woman’s eyes to glow brilliantly. She immediately said, “Little Brother, since you don’t have a sect, then why don’t you join my Grand Qin Empire’s Imperial Academy? With your strength and natural talent, it would simply be too easy to pass the test and join the academy!”

“I’m not interested!” Yang Ye didn’t even give it any consideration before he refused directly. If it was in the past, then he might have been interested. However, he had his master now, so why join that academy and be restricted by it?

The woman was slightly anxious, and she said, “How could you not be interested? If you joined the Imperial Academy and obtained a position in the top 10 during the test, then you’d be able to obtain a title from the empire. In this way, no one will say anything about me eloping with you, and the empire won’t punish me. Moreover, it’ll even say that I was wise enough to discern a hero. How could you not be interested in such an important matter?”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched, and he took a deep breath as he calmed himself. After that, he turned around to look at the woman before he said, “Pretty girl, it seems like you gained all the benefits in this, and I’m only there to do all the work without getting any benefits at all! Let me ask you, on what basis should I do that? Are we close? Why should I exert myself and struggle desperately for you? Do I look like an idiot?”

The woman blushed. Indeed, she’d only considered herself earlier. However, her countenance recovered in next to no time, and then she gazed at Yang Ye with a slightly embarrassed expression. She said, “Of course, there are benefits for you as well. Like obtaining the rewards of the Grand Qin Empire, or like... like really marrying me....”

Yang Ye chuckled coldly and said, “Really marry you? Pretty girl, please don’t take me to be an idiot, alright? I’m not an idiot that helps someone screw me over! Besides that, I already have someone I like, so I’m not interested in you!”

The woman’s embarrassed smile froze, but it quickly returned to normal, and she said in a low voice, “I really do feel admiration towards Little Brother, and I have no attention of using Little Brother. Even if I did, it’s only a very, very, very, very little bit. Besides that, so what if you have someone you like? Isn’t it normal for a man to have a few wives?”

“You’re unbeatable!” Yang Ye gave the woman a thumbs up. This woman before him was truly detestable, and her thoughts and how open she was were things that Yang Ye was slightly unable to bear.

Right when the woman intended to continue speaking, Yang Ye’s expression suddenly changed as he said, “Cut the crap! We’re in trouble!”
