Chapter 2573

Qi Bitian shook her head slightly and remained silent.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

At this moment, the Ancient Sword Sect was covered in sword energy and sword intent, or it should be said that the Ancient Sword Sect was being protected by them.

The powerful sword intent and sword energy caused the Soul Sect and the other powers to dare not attack.

As for the Soul Master, he was supposed to destroy the sword intent and sword energy for them, but for some reason, he’d suddenly turned around and left.

Since the Soul Master had left, the Soul Sect’s experts didn’t attack. However, they didn’t leave either, and they surrounded the Ancient Sword Sect with the other powers.

How could they just leave at this point in the collision between them and the Ancient Sword Sect?

If a strong tiger is allowed to survive, it would become a huge problem in the future!

But because of the sword intent and sword energy from the statue, the entire Ancient Sword Sect had obtained momentary peace.

The Abyss Lion had unwillingly left the Primal True Dragon once the white-haired old man summoned it, and while the dragon feared the Abyss Lion, he wasn’t terrified of the Abyss Lion. Conversely, the Abyss Lion’s arrogance and greed infuriated the Primal True Dragon, so the dragon was unhappy when the Abyss Lion left.

As for Nether Maiden and the woman with the Space Domain, their battle in the sky was still going on!

An outcome still hadn’t been decided!

But both of them were severely injured!

Yang Ye stood where the statue had been before the main hall, and there were corpses before him!

These corpses all belonged to the disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect!

Of course, these were only some of them, and some of them hadn’t even left behind a corpse!

Yang Ye suddenly turned around and walked over. There was an old man lying there, and his lower body was gone!

The old man was none other than the Grand Elder!

One of the people who’d helped him and made him the sect master.

At this moment, even the Grand Elder’s soul was incomplete!

Actually, his soul had almost been devoured by an expert from the Soul Sect, but Elder Xue had rescued him at the critical moment. But it was still a little too late. Most of his soul had been devoured, and it was impossible to restore now.

Gu Nie was by the Grand Elder’s side. Gu Nie wasn’t dead, but he was severely injured!

It could be said that no one throughout the sect was unharmed.

The Grand Elder opened his eyes weakly upon noticing Yang Ye’s arrival. He gazed at Yang Ye, “You were right.”

Yang Ye remained silent.

While they had left the sect, the Grand Elder and the others had returned. They had returned at the sect’s most difficult moment.

The Grand Elder stared at Yang Ye, “Y-You will protect the sect, right?” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Yang Ye still remained silent. It could be said that him becoming the sect master was a trap that Elder Xue and the Grand Elder had set!

Even then, he didn’t complain. Firstly, it was his own choice, and everyone had their own choices in life. Each choice led to a different outcome, and one had to take responsibility for one’s own choices.

Moreover, he’d benefited tremendously from the sect too!

The Grand Elder didn’t say anything else because his soul had vanished.

He was dead!

After countless years of cultivating, he’d died for the sake of the sect!

Yang Ye sighed with emotion in his heart.

Gu Nie carried the Grand Elder’s partial body away, but he suddenly turned around and gazed at Yang Ye, “Can my Master be placed within the Ancestral Hall?”

Yang Ye nodded slightly.

Gu Nie said, “Thank you!” And then he left.

Yang Ye gazed at the others from the sect. At least 30 or even 40% of the sect’s disciples had perished in the battle just now!

Many familiar faces were gone!

War was always a cruel thing!

Extremely cruel!

Yang Ye glanced at the disciples. He saw Mo Ya, Lu Yunxian, and Xie Yiren among them. All three of them were quite weak, so they didn’t fight against the stronger enemies attacking the sect. Even then, their bodies were covered in injuries.

Especially Xue Yiren, his entire left arm was almost in pieces!

The elite disciples had suffered the worst!

Only 6 of the 11 elite disciples remained!

Moreover, all of them weren’t whole!

Yang Ye glanced at them, “Are you afraid?”

They shook their heads!

Fear?

No one in the Ancient Sword Sect was afraid!

They were a group of fearless sword cultivators!

Yang Ye nodded, “That’s good. Now, we don’t have much time. If you want to do anything or leave your last words, then do it now.”

He pointed at the sky, “When the sword energy and sword intent there vanishes, it’ll be the moment we fight them to the death!”

Countless sword cultivators bowed to Yang Ye and left.

Hope?

Yang Ye never told them that it existed because it didn’t!

Yang Ye was direct. He told them they would die, and they could leave at any time. But if they stayed, they should be prepared to die!

A few stayed behind!

They were Elder Xue’s group!

Yang Ye glanced at them and nodded slightly, “Welcome back!”

Elder Xue glanced at Yang Ye with quite a complicated expression in her eyes.

Yang Ye didn’t say anything and just left for Nether Maiden and the others’ bamboo house.

All of them were in the house.

They were strong, so their strength was more than enough to deal with those assassins! Actually, it was all thanks to them. Otherwise, the disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect wouldn’t have been able to resist those assassins!

Especially the Lord Realm assassins!

Those assassins were targeting the elite and inner court disciples of the sect, and they only launched surprise attacks while the Ancient Sword Sect’s disciples were locked in battle with the experts from the other powers!

Under such circumstances, it could be said that every attack they launched would take a life!

Fortunately, Nether Maiden and the others had taken action!

With Boundary Maiden and her powerful barriers at their side, they were able to counter the assassins to a certain extent!

They gazed at Yang Ye in silence when they noticed his arrival.

Yang Ye walked over to them and asked, “Are you alright?”

Nether Maiden shook her head, “What about you?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I only took some small injuries. But I’m sure you know it’ll only take me a while to recover from that.”

She glanced at him, “What do we do now?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while and smiled, “Bringing all of you here…”

The pig-riding woman suddenly asked, “You want us to leave?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “I gathered all of you here because I thought the Ancient Sword Sect had a chance, but now it seems like I was terribly mistaken. It’s a hopeless situation! You’re not part of the sect…”

Yang Ye suddenly stopped because the pig-riding woman had already swung her saber at him!

Yang Ye felt really helpless!

Nether Maiden said, “We came because we think of you as a friend.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I know!”

The pig-riding woman glared at him with displeasure, “Do you think we are balls that you can just kick around as you please?!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “The Ancient Sword Sect is really in a hopeless situation, so are you planning on staying and dying with me? If that’s the case, I’ll die with everlasting regret.”

Actually, he was extremely regretful, he regretted bringing them here!

Boundary Maiden spoke abruptly, “Will you go with us?”

Go with them!

The pig-riding woman nodded, “Let’s leave together! This place had no chance!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m sure you’ve noticed that I have a group of sword cultivators relying on me and putting their trust in me. If I leave now, what would they do? They wouldn’t just be fighting the attack from the other powers at that time, they would be waiting to be slaughtered!”

The pig-riding woman spoke solemnly, “Staying doesn’t change a thing, doesn’t it?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’ve made my decision! But I’m serious when I say that I’m most worried and afraid for all of you. If anything happens to the four of you, Second Sister and Eldest Sister will tear me into bits. So, leave now. I’m begging you, alright?”

They exchanged glances and remained silent!

Yang Ye felt helpless against them and wanted to say more when the pig-riding woman suddenly pushed open the door of the bamboo house, “You should focus on formulating a plan to keep us alive!”

She walked out and closed the door behind her.

Yang Ye gazed at the door with a helpless and speechless expression on his face. Of course, his heart felt very warm.

Later on in the bamboo house.

The pig-riding woman had returned, and she placed her saber on the table and said, “That fellow seems like he won’t ever leave. Should we knock him out? I don’t think our joint forces has a 100% chance of succeeding at knocking him out in an instant!”

Boundary maiden stroked the fox’s fur gently and said, “He’s very strong! We can’t knock him out!”

The pig-riding woman rolled her eyes, “Obviously! I was trying to ask you what we should do now!”

Nether Maiden suddenly said, “Fight!”

Fight!

All of them fell silent in the bamboo house.

…

Yang Ye returned to his abode, and then he entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye took a look at all the demons, and practically all of them were fine. Unless they fought someone at two realms of cultivation above them, their thick and tough skin would keep them safe!

After all, they were Five World Realm demons, and their bodies weren’t any weaker to the bodies of Lord Realm experts.

Besides that, there was another pleasant surprise, the dragon had started to sleep again!

Since he had started to sleep, it represented that the dragon may be about to advance!

This was pretty good news for Yang Ye!

Yang Ye went to the bamboo house and found Qi Bitian.

They started playing Gomoku.

Yang Ye put down a piece and said, “If I die, you can protect this pagoda, right?”

She nodded slightly, “It’ll be fine while I’m in here!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “The Soul Sect’s Master is extremely strong. If he takes my corpse and finds the pagoda…”

Qi Bitian spoke casually, “Don’t worry, if you die, this pagoda will be mine. If he dares to try and take it…”

She raised a hand and said, “I’ll slap him to death! I lose if it takes two slaps!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
