Chapter 2401 – The World May Be Vast, But I Roam Free With My Sword!

A sword howl resounded, and then a ray of light appeared behind An Nanjing.

A flying sword from the Sword Gourd!

One of the black robed figures suddenly stopped and grabbed ahead of himself.

The flying sword was caught!

However, it still pierced his forehead.

It was fast!

Too fast!

It was so fast that he could only grab it, but he couldn’t stop it from stabbing into his forehead!

He’d been a little slow, and that little bit had cost him his life!

An Nanjing stopped, and Yang Ye appeared by her side.

As he gazed at her, his heart hurt. Her left arm was gone, and it had been forcefully pulled off by force. Besides that, her entire body was covered in injuries. Especially the injury on her stomach, it was too, too deep.

It was a reunion after a long time!

An Nanjing gazed at him in silence.

Yang Ye grabbed her right hand with his left hand, and then his Primordial Violet Energy surged into her. At the same time, the Eternal Energy hidden deep within him started to circulate and flow through his arm into An Nanjing.

Once the Primordial Violet Energy and Eternal Energy surged into her, her injuries immediately recovered rapidly at a visible rate, and it was quite terrifying indeed!

Meanwhile, four black clothed figures appeared not too far behind them.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “How did this happen to you?”

She replied, “I’m still alive!”

Still alive!

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he gazed at the black clothed figures. A moment later, he appeared before one of them, and his sword left its sheath!

The Sword Domain!

Three swings!

As soon as it descended, the black clothed man was blasted over 10km away while blood sprayed incessantly from his mouth, and once he stopped himself, a flying sword pierced through his forehead!

Hiss!

His body exploded apart!

An instant kill!

Suddenly, a black clothed man spoke solemnly, “Who are you?! Why are you interfering in my Asura Hall’s business?!”

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath and just appeared before that black clothed man, and then he swung his sword.

Three swings with the Sword Domain!

The black clothed man had been ready and was about to attack, but a black seal suddenly appeared above him!

The Seal of Suppression!

As soon as it appeared, a wave of powerful black light enveloped the black clothed man, and then his cultivation instantly descended!

The black clothed man was horrified, and then the sword descended!

Hiss!

In just an instant, Yang Ye’s sword had descended and sliced him into two!

Blood and internal organs sprayed all over!

In just a short while, Yang Ye had killed three black clothed men!

The last two exchanged glances, and then they immediately flew in the direction they’d come from!

The strength Yang Ye revealed was too terrifying.

Yang Ye was about to pursue them when An Nanjing shook her head, “It wasn’t they who injured me!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “But I want to kill!”

She glanced at him and stopped holding him back!

Yang Ye looked toward the distance. The black clothed men had vanished from his vision. Yang Ye didn’t chase after them and just closed his eyes!

A sword howl resounded, and then a sword appeared in the distant sky. The Seal of Suppression appeared along with the sword!

A seal and a sword!

Hiss!

The black clothed man hadn’t even been able to react before he was killed by Yang Ye’s flying sword! At the same time, a flying sword appeared behind the other black clothed man. It hadn’t been able to kill him, but it did heavily injure him. An instant later, another sword and the Seal of Suppression appeared above him.

Suddenly, a wave of powerful energy rippled out of the black vortex!

Bang!

Yang Ye’s Seal of Suppression and the sword were instantly blasted away, and then a black face appeared before them. It glanced coldly at them, and then a huge black hand stretched out from the area.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He was about to attack when Wu Ni—who was playing Go on the cliff at the Southern Desolate Lands—suddenly looked up, and then he tapped his finger in their direction. A GO piece shot through space and vanished into the sky.

In the sky above Yang Ye and An Nanjing, the same Go piece slammed against the hand.

Bang!

The hand exploded apart!

The eyes on the black face narrowed as it looked up into the sky. Meanwhile, a voice came from above, “You can fuck off now!”

It was Wu Ni’s voice!

The black face looked in that direction for a long time, and then it laughed coldly, “A dead overlord is still so haughty, huh?”

Suddenly, another Go piece appeared in the air, and it slammed directly against the face.

In an instant, a shrill cry resounded from there, and it was absolutely horrifying!

“You…” A shocked voice came from within the vortex.

“Fuck off!” Suddenly, a voice came from the same area, and then the area shook violently and almost exploded apart.

Suddenly, an ethereal middle aged man appeared in the sky. He bowed slightly toward the distance, “Greetings Senior Wu Ni, I’m the Guardian of Hell World. My ancestor hopes you’re doing well.”

On the cliff at the Southern Desolate Lands, Wu Ni spoke indifferently, “He’s not dead?”

The middle aged man laughed embarrassedly, “Not yet!”

Wu Ni put the Go piece down and said, “Tell me what happened!”

The middle aged man glanced at An Nanjing and said, “The Junior Hall Master of Asura Hall teased her during a competition, and she punched him to the point he was crippled. So, Asura Hall…”

“How laughable!” Suddenly, Wu Ni vanished from the cliff, and he was not too far away from the middle aged man when he appeared again.

The middle aged man immediately became extremely vigilant when he saw Wu Ni.

The old man before him had been an extraordinarily terrifying existence all those years ago! Even if Wu Ni was dead now, Wu Ni still wasn’t someone he could offend!

Wu Ni spoke coldly, “That piece of trash Asura Hall couldn’t accept its defeat?”

The middle aged man smiled with embarrassment but didn’t dare to say anything.

He didn’t want to offend the Asura Hall either.

Suddenly, Wu Ni gazed at Yang Ye, “Kid, she was bullied, so what do you think should be done?”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “Kill their ancestors and everyone else!”

Wu Ni had a grin on the corner of his eyes, “You’re brave! Alright, then let’s do that. Come!”

Suddenly, the middle aged man said, “Senior Wu Ni… Y-You can’t go inside!”

Wu Ni suddenly stretched out his right hand, and it instantly wrapped around the middle aged man’s throat. In an instant, the middle aged man turned even more ethereal!

Wu Ni looked him in the eyes, “So you don’t want to give me any face because you think I’m dead?”

The middle aged man hurriedly said, “Of course now. But Senior, the rules…”

“Rules?” A wisp of disdain curled up onto the corners of Wu Ni’s mouth, “That old geezer who set that rule had to address me as senior, yet you’re talking about fucking rules to me? I’ll spare you out of consideration for your ancestor, but I’ll kill even your ancestor if you don’t stop making noise!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he tossed the middle aged man away like trash.

Wu Ni waved his right hand, and then both Yang Ye and An Nanjing entered the black vortex with him.

The middle aged man glanced at his hands with bitterness in his eyes. He was a peak Three World Realm expert, but he wasn’t even able to fight back before the old man!

Not even in the slightest!

The old man could have killed him in an instant!

Suddenly, a voice resounded in his mind, “Now you’ve seen how terrifying he is?”

The middle aged man laughed bitterly, “Ancestor, I was almost killed!”

The voice said, “All those years ago, even destiny once feared him! If it was all those years ago, Asura Hall would have been damned from just a word from him.”

The middle aged man asked, “What about now?”

The voice replied, “Why don’t you go take a look for yourself?”

The middle aged man laughed bitterly and asked, “Ancestor, if he was so terrifying, then how did he die? Was it his lifespan?”

“Not at all!” The voice continued, “He died because he was too strong. It’s like a marquis in a kingdom. When a marquis’ strength is too strong, do you think the Emperor will let him live? It’s how the world is. If you’re too weak, you deserve death; but if you’re too strong, you deserve death too. He once said something that became very famous—If you’re going to be strong, then be invincible!”

The middle aged man seemed to be lost in thought, “If you’re going to be strong, then be invincible!”

A long time passed, and he was about to leave when he suddenly looked up. A middle aged sword cultivator in a cloud white robe was walking slowly through the air!

The middle aged man frowned, “Outsiders are prohibited from entering this place!”

The sword cultivator glanced at him and said, “I want to go in!”

The middle aged man’s eyes narrowed slightly as he clenched his right hand, “I’ll repeat myself one last time. Entry isn’t allowed. Understand?”

Suddenly, a ray of light flashed, and then his eyes opened wide because a sword was pressed against his forehead.

He was stunned on the spot.

The sword cultivator glanced at him, “Too weak!”

He lowered his sword once he finished speaking.

The sword cultivator walked away, “The world may be vast, but I roam free with my sword! Who can’t I kill with my sword?”Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com
