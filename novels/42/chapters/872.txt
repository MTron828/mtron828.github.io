Chapter 873 – A Familiar Face From Profounder Continent!

The saber in the one-armed man’s hand shook violently while the space around it actually started cracking apart, and those cracks quickly swept towards the surroundings. In less than a breath of time, the space around both Yang Ye and the one-armed man had numerous fine cracks all over it.

The space in the surroundings wasn’t able to endure the one-armed man’s saber energy!

Spatial rifts were very terrifying to many, but it wasn’t that terrifying to experts like them who’d grasped the secrets of space. Of course, the precondition was that they weren’t swept into the chaotic flow of space. Otherwise, not to mention them, even a high rank Half-Saint would be minced into bits!

“Yang Ye! Let’s do this!” As soon as he finished speaking, he swung his saber down, and a beam of saber energy shot out from the tip of his saber!

Everywhere it passed, space melted like snow in boiling oil, and it instantly shattered into pieces. The powerful force and energy carried within the saber energy even blasted apart a few hills that were around 3km around them. Moreover, even the ground had started to crack apart.

All the disciples of the Ancient Sword School had heavy expressions on their faces when they witnessed this scene. They had no doubt that this attack could kill a Half-Saint and even a mid rank Half-Saint with ease!

How will Yang Ye deal with this attack?

All of them shot their gazes towards Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye took a step forward, and the shattered space around him was instantly restored to its original state. At the same time, the saber energy immediately started slowing down before finally stopping on the spot.

Everything in the surroundings seemed to have been frozen!

The Sword Domain!

Excitement and joy surged through the eyes of all the disciples of the Ancient Sword School because it was the Sword Domain that they dreamed of possessing! Moreover, they’d never laid eyes on the Sword Domain in their lifetimes! After all, even the Sword Emperor of the Ancient Sword School, Lu Wan’er, hadn’t grasped such a profound ability like the Sword Domain!

All the disciples of the sword school stared fixedly at Yang Ye as they were deeply afraid of missing even the slightest detail!

“Shatter!” As soon as Yang Ye spoke, the saber energy instantly shattered into pieces and transformed into nothingness.

The one-armed man’s saber energy was truly formidable. After all, he’d ignited his soul, blood, and lifespan. So, it could really kill a Half-Saint with ease. However, the one-armed man was still quite weak in Yang Ye’s opinion. To be more precise, they weren’t on the same level at all!

If the Dao Order knew what had happened on Profounder Continent, then its higher-ups would definitely die of regret.

“The Sword... Domain....” There was a trace of shock in the deathly still eyes of the one-armed man, and there was also a wisp of unwillingness and helplessness. However, it didn’t take long for his eyes to close while his figure crashed down to the ground.

The Dao Order had lost once more!

Countless disciples of the Ancient Sword School started cheering and shouting with joy!

Yang Ye raised his head and looked up towards the sky, “Who else?”

“Dao Order, who else do you have!?”

“Dao Order, who else do you have!?”

“Dao Order, who else do you have!?”

Countless disciples of the sword school roared furiously.

It could be said that this was the most satisfying conflict after fighting with the Dao Order for so long. Because the Ancient Sword School had completely trampled upon the Dao Order’s honor!

Chen Dong suddenly appeared by Yang Ye’s side and said, “Be careful!”

Yang Ye nodded. The Dao Order had 3 choices now. The first was to continue sending experts to fight him, the 2nd was to choose to end the conflict peacefully, and the 3rd was to fight desperately to the death and disregard all rules!

The first two choices weren’t that bad, but the last was definitely extremely dangerous. Even though he knew that the sword school had definitely dispatched Saint Realm experts to protect him from the shadows, if the Dao Order really shed all pretenses and stopped abiding by the rules, then he would absolutely face death. After all, he would be pursued by Saint Realm experts, and it might even be a few of them!

This really doesn’t feel good! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed. He really could be considered to be a monstrous genius right now, and he was very strong as well. However, that was only in comparison to those at the same realm of cultivation. He was still too weak when compared to Saint Realm experts, he was extremely weak before them!

He was very well aware of that, and the only reason he was still alive right now was because he had the Ancient Sword School’s protection. It had nothing to do with him at all!

I must restore my sword intent as soon as possible. My strength must be improved as quickly as I can as well! Yang Ye ad decided that he would concentrate on cultivating once he was done here and try his best to raise his strength to the Half-Saint Realm!

Only by attaining the Half-Saint Realm would he have a chance at resisting Saint Realm experts, and even if he couldn’t defeat them, he would be able to flee at least. So, he wouldn’t be in the same situation as he was now. One where he would have no chance to escape if a Saint Realm expert decided to act against him!

There was a long period of silence in the surroundings before a voice suddenly came from the sky, “Yang Ye, no one in the Exalt Realm throughout my Dao Order is a match for you. If you’re confident in your ability, then why don’t you ascend to the Monarch Realm?”

Chen Dong and the others immediately heaved sighs of relief when they heard this. Because it represented that the Dao Order hadn’t chosen to shed all pretenses. If it had, then it would definitely result in an outcome where both sides were severely injured. Once that happened, the Demon King in the north would definitely act, and then both the Dao Order and Ancient Sword School would cease to exist!

It wasn’t that the Dao Order didn’t want to go to war with the Ancient Sword School, it didn’t dare to!

Similarly, the Ancient Sword School didn’t dare to as well!

That was the main reason why there had been no large scale wars between the Dao Order and Ancient Sword School even if they were hostile against each other.

A slight smile appeared on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth when he heard the voice, and he said, “Advancing to the Monarch Realm isn’t something that can be accomplished at will. Moreover, once I do, it represents that your Dao Order can send Monarch Realm experts to fight me. That would be a huge loss to me, and it might even result in my death!”

The voice said, “Are you afraid of death?”

“Of course I am!” Yang Ye continued, “Is anyone not afraid of death?”

The voice resounded once more, “If you don’t advance to the Monarch Realm, then I guarantee that you’ll die right now!”

Yang Ye withdrew his smile and looked up into the sky for a long time before he said, “Looks like your Dao Order intends to play with me until the end!”

The voice replied, “Isn’t that what your Ancient Sword School wants?”

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time before he spoke once more, “I can advance into the Monarch Realm, but I have a condition. I’m sure you’re aware that advancing into the Monarch Realm requires a huge amount of extreme-grade energy stones, and I just so happen to be very poor. So.... Hehehe....”

“100,000!”

“100,000?” Yang Ye was stunned, and then he spoke angrily, “Do you think I’m like the disciples of your Dao Order? I’m not a weakling like them! If I’m going to advance into the Monarch Realm with my natural talent and potential, then how could it be possible without at least a million extreme-grade energy stones?”

A million!

Countless people gasped throughout the surroundings when they heard him. What a bastard! A million!

While such an amount of energy stones was nothing to the Dao Order, it was an astronomical figure to anyone else!

“Such exaggeration! He even dares to extort the Dao Order.... This is really something only he is capable of.”

“I think I feel slight admiration for him now....”

“While he’s quite arrogant, I have to say that he really is qualified to act like that....”

After a long moment of silence, the voice resounded once more, “Do you really want to die?”

Yang Ye laughed coldly, “Don’t threaten me because it’s completely useless against me. I’ll say it right now, give me a million extreme-grade energy stones and I’ll advance to the Monarch Realm right away. If you don’t? Then I’ll continue challenging the Exalt Realm cultivators of your Dao Order. Of course, if your Dao Order is shameless enough and sends Monarch Realm experts to fight me, then I have nothing to say!”

“Give it to him!” Suddenly, an extremely dignified voice resounded from the mountain in the sky.

As soon as the voice resounded, a spatial ring immediately appeared in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye swept it with his consciousness and determined that there were exactly a million in there.

Yang Ye glanced at the sky and said, “Since your Dao Order wants to play until the end, then let’s play!”

As soon as he finished speaking....

Bang!

A terrifying aura erupted from Yang Ye, and it caused the space around him to ripple violently. It was an extremely shocking sight!

The Monarch Realm!

All the spectators were dumbstruck!

“He attained the Monarch Realm just like that? What?”

“How monstrous is he?”

“Watching him makes me feel like I cultivated throughout my lifetime in vain....”

The corners of Chen Dong and Wu Yanzhong’s mouth twitched as well because it was truly quite a blow to everyone’s confidence.

“Good! Very good!” The voice from the sky was quite low and gloomy, and the killing intent within it wasn’t concealed at all.

“Why don’t....” Yang Ye suddenly said, “Why don’t we shake hands and make peace, alright?”

An uproar immediately erupted in the surroundings.

The expressions of all the disciples from the Ancient Sword School changed slightly. What’s he trying to do?Could he be afraid of the Dao Order?

Many disciples of the sword school revealed slightly unsightly expressions towards Yang Ye when they thought up to this point.

After all, Yang Ye was representing the Ancient Sword School right now. So, if he took the initiative to seek reconciliation, then it would be the sword school that lost face!

The voice resounded once more from the sky, “What? Are you afraid now?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I am!”

Clamorous noise resounded once more while Chen Dong and the others had gloomy expressions on their faces.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “I’m afraid that once I kill all the disciples of your Dao Order, your Dao Order would act shamelessly and start sending Saint Realm experts to pursue and kill me. Alas! After all, I’m only at the Monarch Realm. How could I not feel afraid if your Dao Order were to send Saints after me?” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Chen Dong and the other disciples of the Ancient Sword School were slightly stunned, and then they roared with laughter.

“Senior Brother Yang, you should just stop right now. The geniuses of the Dao Order would be annihilated if you continue. At that time, what would you do if the Dao Order acts desperately and sends Saints after you?”

“Exactly! Exactly! Let’s stop right now.”

“Let’s go back to the sword school....”

Chen Dong grinned, “Interesting....”

“Indeed!” Wu Yanzhong nodded with agreement.

A long time passed before a voice came from the sky, “Don’t worry, Saints aren’t needed to deal with you! Come! The geniuses of my Dao Order are waiting for you!”

Meanwhile, one of the disciples of the sword school shouted, “Everyone, I’m sure all of you heard that. The Dao Order won’t send Saint Realm experts against Yang Ye. If they do break that promise, I hope that all of you can spread the word so that the world will know the true colors of the Dao Order!”

The others in the surroundings remained silent.

“There’s no need for Saints to kill him! I’m more than enough!” Suddenly, the voice of a woman resounded, and then a woman walked slowly down the stairs.

“It’s the Crimson Maiden, Fu Jinxian!” Someone exclaimed from amidst the spectators, “Wasn’t she said to be in closed door cultivation until she advances? What’s she doing here?”
