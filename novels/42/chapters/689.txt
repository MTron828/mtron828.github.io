Chapter 690 – Wasn’t It Only One?

“That woman isn’t ordinary!” Qin Bufan spoke abruptly after they left the hall, “I sensed a trace of faint coldness coming from her. My instincts tell me that she isn’t a weakling!”

“Then why didn’t you kill her?” asked Yang Ye.

Qin Bufan replied, “Do I seem like I have nothing better to do?”

Yang Ye said, “Right? Regardless of whether she’s ordinary or not, it doesn’t make much difference to us. The important matter at hand for us is to head to the Hallowed Grounds.”

Qin Bufan asked, “Actually, I still haven’t figured out why you intend to head to the Hallowed Grounds. You’re clearly not going there to kill, because how many can you kill even if you try? But if you aren’t going to kill, then why?”

“To get something and kill some people on the way!” answered Yang Ye.

The arc of light dispersed, and then Qin Bufan gave Yang Ye a thumbs up and said, “Even though it sounds like you’re putting on airs a little, I still like it. Out of consideration for that, I’ll definitely bury you if you’re killed in the Hallowed Grounds!”

“I’ll bury you if you’re killed as well!”

“I can’t die, hahaha!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

Yang Ye wrote a letter and asked the Mermaid Clan to send it to Ding Shaoyao. The incident here really stirred him up. He didn’t look down upon any race. Conversely, he even had a good impression of some demon beasts from the demon race. However, he was very clearly aware that it was impossible for others to feel the same. The human race, demon race, devil race, and oceanic clans were very hostile against each other.

Even though the human race’s current strength had made the other 3 races submit before them, the slightest mistake would cause internal strife to arise in the continent. It was even to the extent that it might cause huge problems to arise within the human race as well!

He wasn’t skilled at dealing with such matters, but he believed that Ding Shaoyao would be able to manage it well. As for the Ding Clan’s link to this incident, he’d mentioned it as well. As for how the matter would be dealt with, he’d left it to Ding Shaoyao to decide.

However, he believed that she wouldn’t disappoint him!

In next to no time, Yang Ye and Qin Bufan arrived before a circular platform on an island. The circular platform was over 60m tall and 300m wide, and there was a blue circle of light on it!

Yang Ye recognized the blue circle of light, it was a teleportation formation!

“We’ll immediately arrive at the Hallowed Grounds upon going up there. That’s a world which is completely different from Profounder Continent. There is abundant spirit energy, numerous geniuses, and countless experts there. It’s easy for us to head over there now, but it’ll be very difficult for us to return. Because once they notice us, they’ll definitely dispatch numerous experts to guard the exit!” said Qin Bufan.

Yang Ye replied, “What? You don’t dare to head over now?”

“Don’t try to egg me on!” Qin Bufan said, “I’m just trying to tell you about the situation we might face once we head over there!”

Yang Ye said, “If we stay on the continent, then we’ll always be in a passive position, and only by heading to the Hallowed Grounds would we be able to turn the situation around. Moreover, those other defiant profounders are about to emerge. Don’t you want to join the battle?”

“It would definitely be a terrifying battle!” said Qin Bufan.

“You can’t die, so what’s so terrifying about it!?” asked Yang Ye.

Qin Bufan said, “You don’t understand. Even though we can’t die, we will grow weaker and fall into deep sleep. All those years ago, we were heavily injured to the point of falling into deep sleep, and that was why they were able to seal us. This time, I wonder how many of us will fall once more into deep sleep. Moreover, if we fall into deep sleep once more, we might be unable to wake up again!”

“Why?” asked Yang Ye.

Qin Bufan answered, “This world is on the verge of destruction. If the world collapses, then its laws would fall into chaos. At that time, even our undying bodies would be useless. The reason those fellows from the Outer Heavens sealed us here and extracted the violet energy from this world was because they want this world to be destroyed. In that way, the world would take us down with it!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“What a tragic fate!” said Yang Ye.

Qin Bufan grunted coldly and said, “Do you think your fate isn’t tragic? All of you were locked in a prison at birth, and all of you might even die along with this prison.”

Yang Ye replied, “Right, all our fates are tragic. Countless experts of the past could have gone a step further and innumerable others wouldn’t have had to die, but there’s no violet energy left in this world and the only other source of violet energy is being guarded by those fellows from the Outer Heavens!”

Yang Ye recalled Daoist Zui of the Sword Sect. Even though he felt that Daoist Zui’s strength was nothing worth mentioning now, Daoist Zui had still died at the hands of the Outer Heavens.

Besides Daoist Zui, there was Elder Mu and many others who should have had the chance to advance into the Saint Realm, but the Outer Heavens had caused them to have no choice but to watch helplessly as their lifespan slowly vanished!

“Those fellows from the Hallowed Grounds and Outer Heavens deserve death!” said Qin Bufan in a low voice.

Yang Ye replied, “It’s not they who deserve death, it’s the weak who deserve death!”

As he spoke, Yang Ye sat down cross-legged and withdrew over a dozen extreme-grade energy stones before starting to absorb the energy within them.

“What’re you doing?” asked Qin Bufan.

Yang Ye glanced at him, “Didn’t you say that there’s a Half-Saint on the other side? So, shouldn’t we recover to our best states before heading over, or are we going to give our lives away?”

Qin Bufan was stunned, and then he nodded and said, “That does make some sense!” When he spoke up to this point, he sat down cross-legged, but a moment passed before he continued, “Hey, err... give me 2 of those rocks!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched, “You don’t even have energy stones?”

“I forgot to seize some....” Qin Bufan said, “Don’t worry, it’s just a few lousy stones. I’ll seize a few hundred and give them to you in the future!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched again, and then he casually tossed over a few dozen energy stones to Qin Bufan while he said, “Remember, it’s a few hundred. I’ll look down on you if you don’t keep your word!”

Qin Bufan was at a loss for words.

Four hours later, both of them had recovered to their peaks.

“Let’s go!” Yang Ye’s figure flashed onto the circular platform, and Qin Bufan arrived right after him.

A ray of dazzling blue light suddenly erupted from the platform, and then both of them vanished on the spot.

An unknown period of time passed before Yang Ye slowly opened his eyes, and a ray of dazzling light shot towards him. Yang Ye couldn’t help but frown, shake his head, and kept his eyes closed for another short moment before opening them.

Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically when he witnessed the scene before him. There were 5 grey robed old men standing around him and Qin Bufan, and every single one of them was a Half-Saint!

Besides that, there were almost 100 blue robed middle aged men standing around the 5 old men. All of them were Monarch Realm experts!

It was an ambush!

“We’ve been waiting for you!” One of the old men spoke indifferently.

Yang Ye said, “Qin Bufan, didn’t you say that there’s only one Half-Saint here?”

Qin Bufan was stunned, and then he said, “Fuck! Wasn’t it only one?”
