Chapter 128 – Husband Again!

Yang Ye was shocked, and then his eyes glowed while he spoke with slight excitement. “Do all of them obey your command?”

If he was able to gain control of these Gold Guards, then wouldn’t he be able to roam freely through the southern territory?

The woman glanced at Yang Ye and said seriously, “Because you rescued me, I’ll give you a piece of advice. Don’t constantly think about possessing external sources of strength, the best and ring way is always to improve your own strength. Don’t get the order reversed.”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he shook his head. How could he not be aware of this principle? However, if he didn’t rely on external sources of strength, then when would he finally be able to rescue his mother? Could it be that he really had to wait until he became a peerless expert? Not to mention whether he was able to become one, even if he really did become one, his mother would already be gone by then.

“You have that thing and have comprehended Sword Intent. If you concentrate wholeheartedly on your cultivation, then your accomplishments in the future will definitely be extraordinary. Conversely, if you place your attention on all of these things, then even though it really will allow you to roam freely through the world for a short period of time, you’ll gradually start to rely more on more on these external sources of strength as time passed, and it’ll cause your own natural talent to be buried. Moreover, it’s even possible that your determination towards the Martial Dao will weaken. You must keep this in mind!” said the woman.

“Thank you for the good advice!” Yang Ye nodded and spoke seriously. No matter what, the woman had good intentions, and he appreciated it.

The woman nodded, and then she turned around to look at the coffin. She lightly tapped it, and then the lid of the coffin was instantly blasted flying. At the same time, a slightly translucent figure gradually arose from within the coffin.

This was the figure of a man. Based on his appearance, he was around 30 years old. He had a rectangular face, dense brows, a pair of tightly closed eyes, and wore a violet robed embroidered with dragons. Even though his figure was ethereal and seemed like a spirit, Yang Ye still sensed a strand of pressure from him while standing over 30m away. Yang Ye knew that this middle aged man before him might be the number two expert of the southern territory from all those years ago, Emperor Zhou!

As she gazed at the middle aged man, a wisp of a complicated expression flashed in the woman’s eyes. After that, she formed a strange seal in front of her, and then a strand of pink light shot out from the seal....

As he gazed at the middle aged man that floated in midair with his eyes tightly closed, Yang Ye said in a low voice, “Didn’t Emperor Zhou perish from the joint attack of numerous experts all those years ago?”

Qin Xiyue said in a low voice, ‘The true Emperor Zhou has vanished in the heavens and the earth. If I’m not wrong, then what exists now before us is probably just a strand of Emperor Zhou’s soul! And she’s probably awakening this soul right now.”

“Do souls really exist after people die?” Yang Ye muttered in a low voice.

“People do have souls. According to rumor, the Theurgists of the past were able to make their souls leave their bodies. Moreover, they were able to use their souls to execute numerous terrifying abilities.” Qin Xiyue said, “Of course, when your strength arrives at a certain level, then you’ll be able to control your own soul as well. However, it probably requires a cultivation at the Monarch Realm at least!”

“Your Imperial Grandfather, the Founding Emperor... is he a Monarch Realm expert?” Yang Ye asked curiously.

“Probably!” Qin Xiyue said indifferently, “I’m not sure as well. In any case, I’ve never seen him since I was born until now. Not to mention me, even that older brother of mine who’s the emperor now hasn’t seen him as well. I think that if the Grand Qin Empire doesn’t encounter some sort of danger, then he wouldn’t make an appearance easily. Someone that has arrived at his level probably doesn’t attach much importance to familial relationships and authority!”

When she spoke up to here, Qing Xiyue suddenly looked at Yang Ye and said, “What’s your ultimate goal once you work hard and become strong? Is it to take control of the world and enjoy both wine and beauties? Or perhaps it’s to live eternally and reign supreme in the world?”

“Me?” A wisp of confusion flashed in Yang Ye’s eyes. But in next to no time, his gaze became firm, and he said, “I merely want to be able to control the fate of the people I care about and prevent them from being bullied. Of course, with that as the precondition, if I’m still able to take control of the world, enjoy both wine and beauties, and live eternally, then it couldn’t be any better!”

“You will. Once you stand at the peak of this world, you can accomplish anything you desire!” said Qin Xiyue with a smile on her face.

“I hope so!” Yang Ye smiled as well.

Right at this moment, the middle aged man that floated in midair had suddenly opened his eyes, and he gazed at the surroundings with confusion. In the end, his gaze descended onto the woman that stood before him, and he said after a long time, “You... you’re Xuan’er?”

The woman nodded.

When he saw her nod, a wisp of a gentle smile appeared on his stern face. Suddenly, his eyes narrowed as he said furiously, “You... why do you only have less than two years of lifespan left? Where’s that bastard Shengong Mao? I ordered him to take good care of you, so why do you actually only have two years of lifespan left?”

“Imperial Father, calm your anger!” The woman explained. “Daughter’s soul was injured by the experts of the Origin School, and the experts of the Ghost Sect even left a mark behind in my soul. The Grand Preceptor had no other choice but to seal me in this tomb, and then utilize the hidden Spirit Veins and the Grand Preceptors Soul Repair Technique to heal me. However, I never expected that this recovery would take a few hundred years!”

“The Origin School? The Ghost Sect?” A wisp of a ghastly and cold glow flashed in Emperor Zhou’s eyes, and then a vicious expression appeared on his face. He said, “I should have listened to the Grand Preceptor and brought swift annihilation to those sects. How I regret my decision! If I was a little more ruthless at that time, then my dynasty wouldn’t have been annihilated, and your mother wouldn’t have been killed by the Origin School’s Yuan Tian!”

“Imperial Father, can you be resurrected?” The woman spoke in a low voice while her eyes revealed dense hope.

“Resurrection?” Emperor Zhou was stunned, and then he shook his head and said, “Only a single strand of my soul remains. This strand should have vanished in the heavens and the earth as well, but I was unable to avoid worrying about you, so I utilized a secret technique and asked the Grand Preceptor to execute a supreme secret technique to held me preserve this strand of my soul. Now, I’ve already seen you, and there’s no reason for this strand of my soul to continue existing!”

“Imperial Father, then what about taking revenge for my Shang Dynasty and my mother? Could it be that we should just give up like that?” The woman was slightly dejected.

Emperor Zhou suddenly looked at Qin Xiyue and said, “You’re a member of the Grand Qin Empire’s imperial household? There is Karmic Luck on you.”

Qin Xiyue’s expression changed, and then she immediately smiled bitterly. As expected of the number two expert from all those years ago. Even though it’s merely a strand of his soul, he was still able to see through my origins with a single glance.

Qin Xiyue didn’t conceal it, and she was unable to conceal it anyway. So, she nodded.

When she saw Qin Xiyue nod, the pupils of the woman that stood before Emperor Zhou constricted, and a wisp of killing intent flashed in her eyes.

Yang Ye’s heart shook, and he instinctively moved to stand before Qin Xiyue. Qin Xiyue was stunned by this, and then her heart felt warm. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Emperor Zhou said, “The destruction of a dynasty is extremely normal. I lost to the Grand Qin Empire. It’s the will of the heavens and the will of man. I don’t resent the Grand Qin Empire, and even if I did, I wouldn’t make a move against you.”

Qin Xiyue hurriedly said, “As expected of the expert that astounded the entire continent all those years ago, Senior’s broadmindedness and bearing is truly admirable!”

Emperor Zhou paid no further attention to Qin Xiyue, and he looked at Yang Ye instead. Suddenly, a strand of surprise flashed in his eyes, and he said, “You’ve actually comprehended Sword Intent. Eh, it’s even at the peak of the 1st level!”

“Imperial Father, he... he’s my husband!” Meanwhile, the woman before Emperor Zhou spoke abruptly.

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched while he thought in his heart. What’s this woman trying to do? Could it be that she really wants to marry me?

Emperor Zhou’s expression changed instead. Suddenly, a strand of invisible and terrifying pressure enveloped down towards Yang Ye.

When this terrifying pressure descended onto him, Yang Ye’s knees suddenly bent, and he almost knelt down on the ground. He didn’t have any time to give it thought before his Sword Intent surged out without holding back in the slightest, and he utilized it to resist the terrifying pressure.

Qin Xiyue’s expression changed as well. Her wrist flipped, and she was just about to lend a hand when she noticed to her astonishment that she was actually unable to move at this moment!

The woman was just about to say something, but she seemed to have thought of something and sealed her red lips once more.

At this moment, Yang Ye’s face had flushed red while his forehead and face were covered in pea-sized beads of sweat. He felt like an enormous mountain was pressing down onto his body, and even if he utilized his Sword Intent without holding back at all, the ‘enormous mountain’ was still pressing down on him to the point that he felt suffocated.

Yang Ye’s knees gradually curved more and more, and it seemed as if he would kneel in the next moment.

“No!” Right when his knee was about to touch the ground, a strand of humiliation swept out from the bottom of Yang Ye’s heart, and Yang Ye roared furiously like a wild beast.

He, Yang Ye, wouldn’t kneel before the heavens or the earth, so why should he, Yang Ye, kneel before this person that stood in front of him? Even if this person was the number two expert of the southern territory from all those years ago, Yang Ye still refused to kneel!

When he thought up to here, Yang Ye whose eyes were already completely red violently utilized his Sword Intent to resist the terrifying pressure!
