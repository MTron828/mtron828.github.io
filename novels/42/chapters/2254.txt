Chapter 2255 – Plan to Leave!

Your Majesty!

Countless spirits were kneeling before Tian Xiu. While they were dead, their faces were filled with the desire to fight.

Their will remained even in death!

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Tian Xiu, you’re the Void Spirit Maiden, right?”

She gazed at him, “Didn’t you realize a long time ago?”

Yang Ye replied, “I just didn’t dare say for sure!”

Tian Xiu grinned, “Now you are, and?”

Yang Ye smiled, “What do you want me to say?”

They smiled at each other, and everything was said with just that.

Tian Xiu gazed at the spirits before her, “My void spirit race is unlike other races. Our spirit still remains after we perish. It isn’t the soul, but the mind. Our mind is our soul. Even then, their minds need to rest after they die, and only then will they get to be reincarnated. But the dead warriors of my race didn’t choose to enter eternal rest. They were waiting, waiting for me!”

She closed her eyes slowly, “Let’s make our final preparations!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he left with An Nanjing.

In Void Spirit Hall.

At this moment, everyone Yang Ye cared about was here.

Elder Yuan, Nether Maiden and the others, A’Man, the families of Qin Chuan and the others…

There weren’t many people here, just a few hundred.

All of them gazed at Yang Ye. That was all they could do at a time like this.

Yang Ye was at the seat of the host. He gazed down at Elder Yuan and said, “Have you found out what I asked?”

Elder Yuan nodded slightly, “The large universe is a formation, and the portal is at the endless black holes. If I’m not wrong, the undying race will teleport all their people through it soon. However, they need a huge amount of spirit energy and death energy to accomplish that. So, they plan to kill everyone in the large universe, and then extract all their death energy and the spirit energy of this large universe.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “All of you will leave through there too!”

“Leave?” They gazed at Yang Ye with astonishment.

Yang Ye stood up, “We can’t protect the large universe. Even if the Void Spirit Maiden of the void spirit race returns, it’s still impossible to protect this large universe. Even if the undying race doesn’t try to destroy this universe, this place will have no spirit energy. So, all of you who rely on spirit energy to live won’t be able to survive for long. Leaving is your only hope!”

Elder Yuan shook his head slightly, “I’m afraid it won’t be that easy!”

Yang Ye said, “I know. I’ll strive to create an opportunity for all of you to leave.”

Meanwhile, Sky Maiden suddenly asked, “What about you?”

Everyone gazed at him, and he shook his head slightly, “I naturally won’t leave, nor can I!”

Sky Maiden was puzzled, “Why?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Because the undying race is determined to kill me. If I leave with all of you, the undying race’s attention will be focused on all of you.”

Sky Maiden wanted to say more, but Yang Ye walked over to her and Blood Maiden, “Eldest Sister, Second Sister, and all of you… I know what you’re thinking, but I really can’t go this time.”

Sky Maiden spoke solemnly, “We’ll stay with you!”

“It’s meaningless!” Yang Ye spoke softly, “It’s completely meaningless.”

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “If you stay, you’ll just die here with me. If you leave, I won’t have anything to worry about, and I may have a better chance to survive then.”

They wanted to say more, but Yang Ye shook his head, “I’ve made my decision.”

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and countless leaves descended before them.

Elder Yuan asked, “Are these Bodhi Leaves?”

Yang Ye nodded, “They can conceal your aura. Elder Yuan, you take them out of Void Spirit city later, and rush to the portal in the endless black holes once the undying race’s army arrives here.”

Elder Yuan thought for a moment and said, “I think we should go there once they’ve activated the formation.”

Yang Ye replied, “The moment they come will be the time they activate the formation. While they are confident, they aren’t just facing me alone. They are facing the void spirit race too. So, they will definitely leave a way out for themselves when facing the void spirit race. Thus, if I’m not wrong, they will do both simultaneously. The time they attack Void Spirit Continent will be the time they send their people away!”

A'Man suddenly said, “The portal will definitely be guarded by the experts of the undying race!”

Yang Ye smiled, “We’re not weak either, right?”

Were they weak?

Of course not. Even if Tian Xiu and the others weren’t included, just him, An Nanjing, the Universe Sprite, the Demonspawn, the Samadhi Flame, and Elder Yuan may be a little inferior when compared to the top experts of the undying race, but the undying race only had a few experts like that.

In short, they had a chance!

“Let’s go together!” Meanwhile, A’Man walked over to Yang Ye, “If we work together, we’ll definitely be able to leave!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “If we do that, none of us will be able to leave. All of you don’t have to say more. As I said before, if you can escape successfully, then I’ll have nothing to worry about, and it’ll increase my chances to survive.”

Some of them still wanted to say something, but Elder Yuan suddenly said, “Just listen to him. Allow me to be honest, if it wasn’t for us, where couldn’t he go too? And if he wants to leave, the undying race wouldn’t be able to stop him. The reason he isn’t leaving is all of us. So, at a time like this, don’t say anything about staying to fight together.”

Yang Ye gazed at Elder Yuan and smiled, “Elder Yuan, aren’t you worried that I would think you’re ungrateful?”

Elder Yuan shook his head, “If you need me, I can stay!”

“Of course not!” Yang Ye smiled, “They are going to an unknown universe, and they need someone to lead them. I can only rest at ease with you leading them.”

Elder Yuan asked, “What about you?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’ll be there soon.”

The others fell silent.

They were no fools. It sounded simple when he said it, but the reality of it was that he was very likely to never go to them!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “Elder Yuan, make the necessary preparations. All of you too. Besides that, it’s decided. If you really want to do something for me, then don’t say anything about this.”

Yang Ye left the hall once he finished speaking, and An Nanjing followed behind him.

The hall was extremely silent.

Outside the hall.

Yang Ye walked toward the city. An Nanjing spoke softly by his side, “I’m staying, right?”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Actually, I hope that you’ll leave. Elder Yuan’s wisdom is sufficient to make the necessary decisions, but his strength isn’t. I would be even more reassured if you were with them.” He glanced at her at this point and smiled, “But I know that you won’t go, and I don’t want to force you. They are all my friends, and I can’t let anything happen to them.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “So, I left all the problems for myself, Qingshi, and all of you. Does that make you angry at me?”

An Nanjing shook her head, “It doesn’t!”

Yang Ye grinned. He looked up at the sky. What happened to Qin Chuan and the others was something that would stab at him forever. He didn’t want it to happen again. If someone was going to die this time, it would be him!

Yang Ye and An Nanjing went to a quiet courtyard in the city. As soon as he arrived there, a black robed figure appeared in front of him.

The Universe Sprite.

During this time, the Universe Sprite had remained in the city and frequently taught Snowy. Unfortunately, Snowy was too playful. That little fellow’s head was only filled with how to play, so she was a huge headache for the Universe Sprite.

The Universe Sprite asked, “Do you need something?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’m here to tell you that the undying race is going to activate the formation in this universe. The portal is in the endless black holes. Some of the people close to me will be leaving through there, and you can go too!”

The Universe Sprite replied indifferently, “I’m not leaving!”

Yang Ye asked, “You plan to accompany the large universe in death?”

The Universe Sprite fell silent for a long time and said, “I’m the spirit of this large universe.”

“What is there for you to protect here?” Yang Ye looked the Universe Sprite in the eyes, “There’s nothing…”

The Universe Sprite shook her head, “You don’t understand.”

Yang Ye sighed softly and didn’t persuade her further. Everyone had their own choice, and this was the Universe Sprite’s choice.

Meanwhile, she said, “Your loved ones have left, but what about the others in Void Spirit Continent?”

The others on the continent!

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while and said, “Once the undying race attacks, I’ll tell everyone on this continent about the location of the portal. At that time, they can go there too. As for their fate, it depends on their own fortune.”

The Universe Sprite fell silent. Yang Ye didn’t owe them anything, and he’d done his part by protecting them for so long.

A short while passed before she said, “There are many Sprites throughout the large universe, and I’ve gathered all of them. I want to let them into your Primordial Pagoda so that they can be with you and Snowy from now on. Is that alright?”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Perhaps letting them go with the others is the best. Because I may not survive either.”

She shook her head, “I don’t trust them. No one is without greed. I’m afraid these Sprites will suffer in their hands!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Yet you trust me?”

She replied indifferently, “I trust Snowy!”

As soon as she finished speaking, a fist-sized ball of light appeared before Yang Ye, “It has a small space of its own in there. Those Sprites are inside. I’ll leave them to you.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short moment, and then he nodded before transporting it into the Primordial Pagoda.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Snowy took the ball of light before her, and then sized it up for a moment before entering it.

“How playful! But that’s fine too!” The Universe Sprite smiled and left.

Once she entered her room, Yang Ye sighed softly and left.

Time trickled by.

Three days passed in the blink of an eye.

Morning.

The sun rose up slowly in the east, and everything remained quiet as sunlight descended to the ground.

However, Void Spirit City suddenly became dark.
