Chapter 1340 – Fighting Is The Only Option!

Doomsday City was a massive city, but it seemed extremely tiny before the army of countless demon beasts. After all, there were millions of demon beasts around the city, and they were mostly huge like hills.

Even though not all humans were within Doomsday City, it could be said that practically all the experts throughout the continent were here. So, once Doomsday City was destroyed, the entire continent would belong to the demon beasts.

Of course, the residents of Doomsday City didn’t think about the human race’s future right now. They were just thinking about how to survive!

The demon race was attacking from all sides, so Ye Liuyun arranged for their forces to be divided into 4 groups. Every group was led by Voiders. Ye Liuyun had ordered them to defend the city no matter what. Because once they failed and allowed the demon beasts to enter the city, then Doomsday City would fall into chaos in an instant!

After she arranged all of that, Ye Liuyun went over to Yang Ye’s side and pointed at Mo Xiaoleng, “That young woman’s flames are very strong. We can’t allow her flames to get close to Doomsday City.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, and then he gazed at Snowy who was in Zi’er’s arms, “If she releases those flames again, then suck them all away. Alright?”

Snowy nodded forcefully because she’d been wanting to do that for a long time.

Yang Ye walked over to Zi’er and Snowy. He gazed at Zi’er, smiled as he rubbed her head, and then rubbed Snowy’s head before he said, “Don’t leave the city later. Protect yourselves well, and Liuyun too.”

Zi’er remained silent.

As he watched her remain silent, Yang Ye shook his head and smiled. He knew that she would definitely act if he was in danger. So, he didn’t say anything. He just hugged both Zi’er and Snowy lightly, and then he turned to look at Ye Liuyun, “You’re in charge of everything from now.”

Ye Liuyun nodded and remained silent.

Yang Ye turned around and gazed at an empty area by his side. It didn’t take long for the space there to ripple, and then Shui Linlang and Qian Lankong appeared there.

Yang Ye ordered, “Divide the Slayer Pavilion’s forces into 4 and tell them to support our armies at each of the city gates. As for the 2 of you, assist our Voiders in their battles with the Voider Realm demon beasts.”

Qian Lankong asked, “What are you going to do?”

Yang Ye glanced at the army of demon beasts in the surroundings and smiled, “I’m going to cheer everyone on!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stomped his foot on the ground and shot up into the sky. The ancient sheath appeared in his left grasp, and then he sheathed his sword before looking up at the Demon Empress who stood on the Cloud Eagle in the distance, “Demon Empress, you’re the number one expert of the demon race. Come, do you dare to fight me?!”

At the moment they heard Yang Ye leave the city and challenge the Demon Empress, the blood of everyone throughout Doomsday City seethed.

Hope!

Even though Doomsday City was at a disadvantage, the human race was still filled with hope. Why? Because of Yang Ye!

The demon race was very strong, but so what? Doesn’t Yang Ye show no fear to it at all?

No matter how strong the demon race was, the human race dared to fight them!

The human race’s morale instantly surged up when Yang Ye left the city and issued his challenge, and their aura was on par with the demon race.

Mo Xiaoleng was about to attack, but the Demon Empress stopped her and said, “Let me do it!” As soon as she finished speaking, the Demon Empress’ figure appeared before Yang Ye. She gazed at Yang Ye for a short while before she said, “I never expected you to attain the Emperor Realm in such a short while. What a surprise.”

Yang Ye glanced at the dense expanse of demon beasts that were charging at Doomsday City and said, “Demon Empress, I don’t understand something. You seem to really detest the human race.”

The Demon Empress placed her hands behind her back and smiled, “How did you discern that?”

Yang Ye replied, “Intuition.” He hadn’t thought about it carefully, but now that he had, he noticed that the demon race actually showed signs of wanting to attack the human race from a long time ago. It was obvious from the training that the demon beasts were going through and the equipment that they wore. Moreover, the demon race was clearly prepared to deal with the defensive formations on Heaven Pillar Peak!

All the signs pointed to the fact that the demon race had been planning to attack Heaven Pillar Peak for a long time!

“Intuition?” The Demon Empress chuckled and said, “I remember I told you that I was ignorant and entered the demon race when I was young, and then I was saved by my husband. There was something I didn’t tell you, and I’ll add it in now. Do you know what happened to my family after I married into the demon race?”

She chuckled before Yang Ye could answer here, but her smile was quite cold, “Once I married into the demon race, my family was annihilated. Do you know what was the reason that they used? They said that I brought shame to the human race.... Haha! Marrying into the demon race is a humiliation for the human race? How truly laughable!”

As she finished speaking, her eyes were filled with coldness.

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “Those people who killed your family are probably dead by now!”

She nodded, “They’re dead, all of them are dead.”

Yang Ye frowned, “Since you’ve taken revenge, then why try to annihilate the human race?”

She looked up at the humans throughout Doomsday City, and then a smile arose on the corners of her mouth, “Someone said that he hoped for only the demon race to exist in this world. So, the human race can vanish!”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a short while, and then his profound energy surged. The Demon Empress clearly hated the human race to the bone. As far as she was concerned, every other human besides herself had to die. Such a thought was ingrained deep within her mind, so no matter what he said now, it would make no difference.

Fight!

Fighting was the only option!

The Demon Empress flipped her palm and a fine whip appeared in her grasp. Both of them exchanged glances in midair, and then a moment of silence ensued before Yang Ye suddenly drew his sword and swung it!

600 overlapped Heavenrends!

After he attained the Emperor Realm, he was able to overlap Heavenrend 600 times. As soon as he swung his sword, a beam of sword energy shot towards the Demon Empress at a speed that wasn’t visible to the eye. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The Demon Empress’ eyes narrowed slightly when she sensed how terrifying Yang Ye’s attack was, and there was a trace of seriousness in the depths of her eyes. She didn’t dare act carelessly, and she waved her hand, causing the fine whip to leave numerous afterimages behind as it swept forward.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded, and then the Demon Empress was pushed around 1km back.

She looked down at the whip in her grasp. At this moment, the Void Rank whip of hers had cracked apart. There was even a crack on her palm, and blood was slowly seeping out from it. The Demon Empress remained silent for an instant before she waved her right hand and put the whip away. After that, she gazed at Yang Ye and said, “I never expected your strength to reach such heights upon attaining the Emperor Realm.”

Yang Ye didn’t speak and just sheathed Heaven’s Gravestone within the ancient sheath. In an instant, profound energy flowed out from him, and then the space around him instantly rippled. Yang Ye walked slowly towards the Demon Empress while holding the hilt of his sword. At the same time, the wings behind his back started to tremble.

The Demon Empress clenched her fists slowly. When Yang Ye arrived 300m away from her, she suddenly raised her hands, and then an ice crystal appeared in her grasp. After that, a ray of dazzling light erupted from the ice crystal. In an instant, the scene around her started transforming, and it didn’t take long for the surroundings to become a world of snow. As for the Demon Empress, she’d vanished, and only Yang Ye remained here. Yang Ye stopped, glanced at the surroundings, and then closed his eyes slowly.

A short while passed before Yang Ye opened his eyes slowly. There was a trace of seriousness in his eyes. Because everything before him wasn’t an illusion, it was real! Even though illusions could seem real to others, everything before him really wasn’t an illusion and was real instead. He was sure of it. After all, he possessed the Enlightened Sword Heart and had comprehended the Sword Domain, so no matter how great the illusion was, it was impossible for it to deceive him.

Suddenly, the mountains of ice around him moved. Countless mountains of ice collapsed abruptly, and then transformed into blades of ice that shot at him.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and took a step forward. In an instant, a wave of light surged out from within him and collided with those blades of ice.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Explosions resounded incessantly.

Yang Ye’s sword energy was much sharper than those blades of ice, so they were instantly dispersed upon coming into contact with his sword energy. However, Yang Ye’s expression grew more and more solemn. Because the blades of ice simply seemed endless. As soon as he destroyed some, even more appeared, and they were growing stronger!

Yang Ye was ceaselessly sizing up the surroundings. He remained silent for a moment before he sheathed his sword in the ancient sheath, and then he drew it and swung it forward! Since it wasn’t an illusion, then he had no choice but to use force!

A beam of sword energy immediately shot forward. The blades of ice in its path were instantly obliterated, and the surroundings grew slightly ethereal.

A cold smile arose on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth. He sheathed his sword again, and then drew it once more. Another beam of sword energy shot out from the ancient sheath and shot deep into the depths of the sky.

Bang!

It didn’t take long for a loud explosion to resound in the sky. At this moment, Yang Ye felt the entire world tremble slightly. At the same time, everything around him grew even more ethereal.

Yang Ye sheathed Heaven’s Gravestone in the ancient sheath, and then a moment of silence ensued before he drew it and swung it.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded again, and it sounded like something here had shattered. It didn’t take long for a wave of white light to flash. When Yang Ye opened his eyes again after a few breaths of time passed, everything had returned to normal. However, his expression instantly changed drastically. Because the Demon Empress was above Doomsday City, and her whip was descending towards Zi’er.

However, everyone throughout Doomsday City, and even Zi’er seemed to be frozen on the spot. They couldn’t move at all, and they could only watch as the whip descended towards Zi’er.

Yang Ye’s eyes instantly seemed like they were filled with an ocean of blood, “Demon Empress, I, Yang Ye, will definitely slaughter the entire demon race if you dare to harm even a hair on her!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye transformed into a blood red ray of light that vanished on the spot.
