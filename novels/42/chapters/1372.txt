Chapter 1373 – Fuck!

“Calm down!” Wu Yuan hurriedly said, “I meant that she has left the Radiant Dimension.”

The slaughter intent Yang Ye emanated instantly shrunk back into his body. Wu Yuan heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that. After all, Yang Ye really seemed like he was going to kill just now!

Yang Ye frowned, “She’s not in the Radiant Dimension?”

Wu Yuan nodded, “She and my Martial Uncle left for True Martial Stellar Region’s Divine Valiance Continent.”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice “True Martial Stellar Region? Divine Valiance Continent? Be a little more specific.”

Wu Yuan spoke seriously, “Her natural talent was too terrifying, and she learned everything extremely quickly. Moreover, she merely required slight guidance to understand everything in the Martial Dao. It didn’t take long for my Martial Uncle to have nothing to teach her. That was why she fell into a bottleneck. For the sake of not delaying her progress, my Martial Uncle decided to advance to the Emperor Realm and take her to Divine Valiance Continent in True Martial Stellar Region.”

Wu Yuan paused for a moment and continued, “Actually, the Martial Sect in the Radiant Dimension is just a branch.”

Xiao Bieli frowned, “You’re just a branch?”

Wu Yuan nodded, “Divine Valiance Continent is a medium world. It’s a world of martial artists, and it’s where my Martial Sect’s headquarters resides. The higher-ups of the Martial Sect decided to send us to various worlds to expand the Martial Sect and recruit geniuses for it. An Nanjing’s natural talent is extraordinary, and her comprehension ability is shocking. We can’t accommodate her anymore. So, my Martial Uncle had no choice but to take her to our headquarters. She’ll be fostered better there!”

True Martial Stellar Region! Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly.

Wu Yuan’s eyelids twitched as he thought Yang Ye was angry, and he immediately said, “Yang Ye, my Martial Sect has absolutely no intention to harm her. Based on her natural talent, the Martial Sect there will definitely do all it can to foster her.”

What did a sect care about the most?

Geniuses, of course!

Because only an endless stream of geniuses could maintain the longevity of a sect and even allow it to rise a level higher. No matter how strong a sect was, if its younger generation wasn’t strong and lacked geniuses, then it would suffer a decline or even be destroyed in the end. So, if a true genius appeared within a sect, then unless something unexpected occurred, the sect would definitely foster that genius well. Even if that genius left the sect to temper himself or herself, the sect would send its experts to protect that genius in secret.

Yang Ye naturally understood that principle, so he wasn’t angry. Even though he hoped for An Nanjing to stay by his side, she didn’t belong to him, and she had her own life and fortune as well.

It was fine so long as she was safe!

Yang Ye opened his eyes and cupped his fist to Wu Yuan, “I was rash earlier. Sorry.” Wu Yuan had stepped forward and acted righteously to help him in the past, and he’d never forgotten that kindness. The reason he’d lost his composure earlier was because he’d thought that something had happened to An Nanjing.

Wu Yuan shook his head and said, “I should have been a little clearer. It wasn’t your fault.”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “I have other matters to attend to. Farewell.” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Once Yang Ye left, Wu Yuan laughed bitterly, “He has grown to such an extent!

Two years ago, Yang Ye was just a Half-Saint. At that time, while Yang Ye’s natural talent and strength weren’t bad, Yang Ye was no threat to him. Yet now, Yang Ye had grown to a level that he could only look up to.

Xiao Bieli smiled, “That little girl is probably very strong as well, right?”

Wu Yuan nodded, “Just a few months after she arrived at the Martial Sect, I was no match for her anymore, and even my Martial Uncle found her difficult to defeat. She possesses the Martial God Physique, the true Martial God Physique. Now that she has returned to Divine Valiance Continent, the Martial Sect there will definitely foster her with all its might. Presently, she might have arrived at a terrifying level.”

Xiao Bieli suddenly asked, “Is she or Yang Ye stronger?”

Wu Yuan was slightly stunned, and then he shook his head, “I don’t know. But now that you’ve mentioned it, I hope they can compete with each other. It’ll definitely be very exciting.”

“I really look forward to it!” Xiao Bieli smiled, and then he seemed to have thought of something and added, “I’m sure you’ve realized Yang Ye has feelings for her, and she has feelings for him as well. Your Martial Sect wouldn’t try to separate them if they want to be together in the future, right? I’m sure you’ve realized that Yang Ye is a madman. If they dare to do that, that fellow would disregard everything once he goes mad.”

Wu Yuan laughed bitterly and said, “Needless to say, such worries make a huge amount of sense. Alas, no matter what, I hope that doesn’t happen.”

There was no need to mention how strong the Martial Sect on Divine Valiance Continent is, but Yang Ye.... As they say, never bully youths when they are weak. No one knew how much Yang Ye would grow. But it was certain that so long as Yang Ye didn’t fall, he would definitely become an extraordinary expert. Even the Martial Sect on Divine Valiance Continent would probably dare not offend such a genius!

The best outcome was that Divine Valiance Continent’s Martial Sect would approve of Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s union. In that way, the Martial Sect wouldn’t just avoid offending a genius, it would even draw a peerless genius over to its side. That was the best outcome. However, Wu Yuan was afraid that the Martial Sect would underestimate Yang Ye. After all, such sects had a sense of superiority, and they liked to look down on others.

As for Yang Ye, if someone made him unhappy, then he would make them feel worse.

So, the slightest mistake might cause it to end in a tragedy for Yang Ye or the Martial Sect!

Xiao Bieli seemed to have thought of that as well. He shook his head, turned around, and left. Presently, he shouldn’t be worrying about the future; he should be worrying about how the academy would pass through this predicament.

...

Xiao Bieli asked as they traveled, “How long will it take for the experts from the Alliance of Guardians to arrive?”

“I don’t know.” Yang Ye continued, “But it probably won’t take long.” He’d killed that Semi-Deity, so the Alliance of Guardians probably had an understanding of his strength now. So, if they wanted to kill him, they would definitely not send a Semi-Deity. Or perhaps it should be said that they wouldn’t send just one. As for whether they would send a Deity, he didn’t know the answer.

However, even if they sent a Deity, he wouldn’t fear that expert!

There was nothing that couldn’t be resolved with one Heavenrend. If there was something like that, then he would use two!

After they returned to White Deer Academy, Yang Ye arrived outside Xiao Yuxi’s cultivation room but didn’t head in and disturb her. His face gradually became gentle as he gazed at the room, and the coldness and indifference in his eyes became warm and gentle. It was his wife who was within the room. After 2 years, he could finally see her again.

Since they left Profounder Continent, Xiao Yuxi, An Nanjing, and Lu Wan’er had suffered a lot while staying by his side.

Especially An Nanjing and Xiao Yuxi. An Nanjing once lost her cultivation and her arms. As for Xiao Yuxi, she’d had her memories wiped. So, besides love, he felt guilt towards them. Because they were his women, yet they’d suffered repeatedly.

If a man couldn’t protect his own women, then was he still a man?

This time, he’d decided to keep Xiao Yuxi, Lu Wan’er, and the others by his side. If they really did encounter danger, then he, Yang Ye, would be the first to die.

Time trickled by. Around 6 hours later, the door suddenly opened slowly, and then Xiao Yuxi appeared before Yang Ye.

At this moment, Xiao Yuxi wore a moon white dress. A slender and delicate figure, a peerlessly beautiful appearance, and snow white hair....

Gorgeous!

She possessed otherworldly beauty!

This was his wife!

Xiao Yuxi was slightly stunned when she saw him, and a few moments passed before she spoke softly, “You’re back!” Her voice was trembling slightly.

Yang Ye walked over to her and wrapped his arms around her delicate waist. Xiao Yuxi’s waist was very soft like it had no bones. She emanated a faint fragrance. It wasn’t from fragrant powder, but her own natural fragrance. Yang Ye didn’t speak and just hugged her tightly while greedily taking in the fragrance coming from her.

Xiao Yuxi’s delicate figure started to stiffen, but it didn’t take her long to relax and wrap her arms around Yang Ye’s waist as well.

At that moment Yang Ye had been exiled, she felt like the sky was falling, and she’d been worried for countless days and nights. Now, that worry in her heart had finally eased up.

Yang Ye was fine!

He’d returned alive!

Both of them didn’t speak a word and just hugged each other tightly. A long time passed just like that before Yang Ye released Xiao Yuxi, and then he sized her up and spoke softly, “You’re a Quasi Emperor now?”

Xiao Yuxi nodded slightly, “But you’re already an Emperor.”

Yang Ye stretched out his hand and brushed her beautiful hair that hung down before her chest as he said, “No one can make us split up again.”

Xiao Yuxi grabbed Yang Ye’s hand and spoke softly, “You suffered a lot in the last 2 years, right?”

Yang Ye replied softly, “It was worth it!” Even though he’d almost lost his life in Dark Hell Continent on many occasions. Fortunately, the tribulations he experienced allowed him to grow incessantly instead. Moreover, he’d even attained the Emperor Realm on Dark Hell Continent.

Xiao Yuxi didn’t speak and just embraced him tightly. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

A short while passed before Yang Ye suddenly lowered his head and kissed her. Xiao Yuxi’s delicate figure trembled slightly. But it didn’t take long for her to relax and allow Yang Ye to do as he pleased.

After kissing her for a while, Yang Ye released her and spoke softly, “Yuxi, I want....”

Xiao Yuxi lowered her head slightly and remained silent, but she’d clenched her fists slightly. Yang Ye didn’t ask again. He just wrapped his arms around her waist and shot into her cultivation room. After that, a strand of sword intent suddenly appeared outside the room and enveloped it completely.

At this moment, even a Semi-Deity’s divine sense couldn’t penetrate the room.

...

In the room.

Robes were undone, bodies bared, and magnificent views revealed before the eyes.

Rapid breathing, misty eyes, and allowing her husband to comfort her lonely heart.

A valiant assault over twin peaks, through a valley, and into a damp ravine that was unusually clear. At the end of the ravine was a beautiful cave, yet it was where a villain hid. So, the hero charged forward with a spear in hand....

Bang!

Suddenly, a loud explosion resounded through White Deer Dimension, and then a few waves of pressure pressed down upon White Deer Dimension!

The Alliance of Guardians’ forces were here!

“Fuck!” A voice that carried boundless rage resounded from within the room, and then a ray of light shot up into the sky.
