Chapter 1396 – I Have To Make It Flashy!

Now that he was done with his business in the Radiant Dimension, Yang Ye naturally intended to travel to Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region. After all, Lady was still waiting for him.

However, he didn’t go there directly, and he came to Stellar City first.

How powerful was Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region?

Yet it was still being pushed back repeatedly before Celestial Demon Stellar Region. So, it was utterly pointless to head there rashly. After all, his goal was to help Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region and not just Lady. If his goal was just to help Lady, then with the strength she possessed, could anyone stop her from going anywhere else in the world?

So, he had to prepare!

...

Stellar City. Leaf and Cloud.

Leaf and Cloud was a small store that Ye Liuyun had started in Stellar City. Because it had just started operating, it wasn’t selling anything. [1]

In the hall, Ye Liuyun’s heart finally relaxed when she saw Yang Ye. Yang Ye was the Sword Alliance’s backbone. If he was gone, then the Sword Alliance on Dark Hell Continent and everything else in Stellar City would collapse.

Even though Yang Ye had wives, he was gone. Su Qingshi and the others’ strengths were utterly insufficient to take control of the Sword Alliance. Moreover, they wouldn’t dare to maintain control of it. Because if they tried to while not possessing sufficient strength, it would only bring calamity to them.

So, nothing should ever happen to Yang Ye.

Because Yang Ye’s footsteps were too quick, and the Sword Alliance’s development was extremely swift as well, there was a drawback. The drawback was instability. Yang Ye was the reason most people in the Sword Alliance stayed. They were gathered here because they thought highly of Yang Ye’s future, and that was why they were willing to fight together.

However, if he was gone, then many would leave. If they didn’t have a leader with potential, then they would have no hope in the Sword Alliance. At that time, even Ye Liuyun might leave.

The Sword Alliance existed while Yang Ye existed!

Ye Liuyun restrained her thoughts, glanced at Xiao Yuxi, and then gazed at Yang Ye and spoke softly, “Is it done?” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye nodded, “I’ve resolved everything in the Radiant Dimension.”

Ye Liuyun asked, “You’re heading to Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region now?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’ve decided against that for now.”

Ye Liuyun asked, “You intend to attack the Alliance of Guardians’ headquarters?”

Yang Ye glanced at her with a trace of surprise in his eyes, “How did you know?”

Ye Liuyun pondered deeply for a moment and replied, “I’ve been gathering information on Skyriver Stellar Region, Celestial Demon Stellar Region, and Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region since you left. Celestial Demon Stellar Region is the strongest amongst them. It’s a three star stellar region. Skyriver Stellar Region is a one star stellar region. As for Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region, it was once a three star stellar region as well. Yet now, they only have control over a few worlds, so they can’t even be considered a two star stellar region.”

Once Ye Liuyun finished speaking, Yang Ye asked, “One star? Three stars? What’s that?”

Ye Liuyun explained, “All the stellar regions beneath besides the large world itself are ranked by one to four stars. Four stars are the greatest, and they belong to the stellar regions who have a chance of charging into the large world. Conversely, one star is the lowest. For example, Skyriver Stellar Region only possesses over a dozen worlds, and it doesn’t have many Deities as well.”

Yang Ye asked, “How many stars does our Dark Hell Stellar Region possess?”

Ye Liuyun glanced at him and spoke flatly, “Not even one. It’s beneath the rankings.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Ye Liuyun continued, “We don’t have Deities, and we have just one world. Even though it was once a medium world, it’s no different to a small world right now.” She paused for a moment and continued, “We have a long way ahead of us.”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “There’s no rush. Let’s take it slow. Go on.”

Ye Liuyun continued, “Actually, Clouds of Heaven stellar region should have vanished a long time ago. However, it has been able to hold on for so long because of that woman, Zhuang Weiran. She’s an extraordinary genius with absolutely terrifying strength. If she’s given the time, then Celestial Demon Stellar Region would probably dare not attack Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region.”

Zhuang Weiran!

Yang Ye clenched his fists. Obviously, she was enduring extremely heavy pressure right now. After all, she just had to agree, and Wildlands Stellar Region would lend her stellar region a hand. However, Lady hadn’t. The consequence was that she had to shoulder the responsibility of fighting Celestial Demon Stellar Region!

The lives of countless within her stellar region were carried on her shoulders!

Ye Liuyun added, “Even though Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region was pushed back repeatedly while she resisted persistently, it still existed. If you want to reduce her burden, then there’s a way to do that quickly, and it’s to launch a surprise attack on Skyriver Stellar Region’s headquarters and force Skyriver Stellar Region to bring its forces back. So long as that happened, Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region would be able to catch its breath a little. However, that will only be a temporary measure.”

Yang Ye asked, “Where’s the Alliance of Guardians’ headquarters?”

Actually, he’d wanted to head over there while he was in the Radiant Dimension. However, he didn’t know where it was. Moreover, he couldn’t travel through space over extended periods because it consumed too much profound energy. So, he had no choice but to return to Stellar City.

Ye Liuyun gazed at him for quite some time before she asked, “Are you really going?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I have to.”

Ye Liuyun remained silent for a short while, and then she said, “Skyriver Continent, Skyriver City. That’s where their headquarters resides. It was jointly formed by some independent cultivators and small worlds. It has around 5 Deities, and my initial estimations put their Semi-Deities at around 15 or more. Besides that, it had at least 30 or 40 true Voiders.”

5 Deities! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. One had died earlier. In other words, they had 4 more Deities. Besides that, their Semi-Deities couldn’t be underestimated as well. After all, if he wanted to kill Semi-Deities, then he had to use the true form of Heavenrend. It was impossible for him to use the true form of Heavenrend on over a dozen Semi-Deities!

Meanwhile, Ye Liuyun added, “Your objective isn’t the annihilate Skyriver Stellar Region, it’s to force them to bring their experts back. So long as they retreat, you will have accomplished your goal. Understand?”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “I understand.” It was definitely impossible for him to annihilate Skyriver Stellar Region on his own. All he could do was force them to retreat and reduce the pressure that Lady endured.

Meanwhile, Ye Liuyun spoke with an extremely serious expression on her face, “Remember that you must retreat once they bring their forces back. Otherwise, you might be besieged by numerous Deities.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t worry, I won’t do something stupid like fighting a few Deities.” Even though he was confident, he wasn’t confident to the point of thinking he could fight 4 Deities on his own. Not to mention the 4 Deities, he would have to flee even if those Semi-Deities swarmed him.

Ye Liuyun spoke solemnly, “You must realize that you are linked to the fate of numerous people. Many will die if something happens to you!”

“That makes me feel even more pressure!” Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Looks like I absolutely can’t die.”

Ye Liuyun glanced at him and said, “”Actually, I’m quite curious. You sword cultivators stress upon being unrestrained and having a free heart that’s without any shackles. But you carry so much on your shoulders. Logically speaking, it’s impossible for your attainments in the Sword Dao to be so outstanding. But it just so happens that it’s extremely formidable, and it isn’t inferior to Jian Wuji at all.”

Yang Ye replied, “Actually, what you just said is absolutely right, and many sword cultivators are without restraint. Since there are no shackles on their hearts, they can focus on the sword, and so their attainments in the Sword Dao are extremely formidable. However, I’m unlike them. You have to realize that the reason I cultivate the sword is so that I can protect my loved ones, and it isn’t for the sake of pursuing the so-called limits of the Sword Dao. In my opinion, the sword is a weapon, a weapon to kill, and a weapon to protect my loved ones. The reason I cultivate it bitterly is to protect my loved ones, and it isn’t purely for the sake of the Sword Dao. Understand?”

Ye Liuyun fell silent.

Yang Ye continued, “In my opinion, my wives, my child, and all of you who follow me aren’t shackles but motivation. The reason I continuously work hard on becoming strong is because I want to protect all of you. All of you are my motivation to grow stronger without end.”

A wisp of tender affection flashed through Xiao Yuxi’s eyes when she heard him, and then she held his hand tightly.

Meanwhile, Ye Liuyun suddenly said, “Then what about yourself? Have you never thought about yourself? Like authority, women, or eternal life?”

Yang Ye was stunned because he really didn’t pursue anything for himself. Authority? Women? Authority was no different to trash in his eyes. Even if he was allowed to be the Yang Clan’s patriarch, he wouldn’t be interested. Women? He did pursue that a little, but he was really content with what he had. Because he had Su Qingshi, Xiao Yuxi, and the others. As for eternal life? Actually, he didn’t care about eternal life. All he wanted was to just live a peaceful and comfortable life with Su Qingshi, Xiao Yuxi, and the others.

The longer one lived, the easier it was for problems to arise.

A short while passed before Yang Ye shook his head and chuckled. He took Xiao Yuxi’s hand and said, “Actually, so long as the people I care about are alright, then everything is alright. Let’s not talk about these things that are just a waste of time. I’m going to Skyriver Stellar Region now. Liuyun, I’ll leave everything here to you. Take care of your own safety and keep an eye on the situation between Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region and Celestial Demon Stellar Region at all times. Immediately send me a voice transmission if there’s anything urgent.”

Ye Liuyun spoke softly, “Be careful!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he vanished on the spot with Xiao Yuxi.

Meanwhile, Ye Liuyun remained silent for a long time, and then she spoke softly, “Protecting.... Actually, you’re the same as Jian Wuji. Even though yours is selfish, being selfish is the best....”

...

Yang Ye didn’t waste time and immediately used the teleportation formations in Stellar City to teleport himself to Skyriver Continent.

There was a defensive formation in the sky above Skyriver Continent, and it was guarded as well. However, the guards weren’t able to notice Yang Ye while he was enveloped beneath his Sword Domain, so he was able to arrive at Skyriver City.

Skyriver City was the Alliance of Guardians’ headquarters.

The Sword Spirit stood by Yang Ye’s side and asked, “Are you going to carry out assassinations?”

Yang Ye gazed at the city for a short while before he shook his head and said, “That would be too subtle. I have to make it flashy!” As soon as he finished speaking, he gazed at the Sword Spirit.

The Sword Spirit gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then she nodded and transformed into the Sword Precursor that entered the ancient sheath.

Yang Ye grabbed the Sword Precursor’s hilt tightly with his right hand. A wisp of ferocity curled up on the corners of his mouth while he gazed at Skyriver City, and then he suddenly drew his sword and swung it in the city’s direction!

1. Leaf is the Ye(叶) in Yang Ye, Cloud is the Yun(云) in Ye Liuyun.
