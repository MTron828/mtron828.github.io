Chapter 282 – Withstand A Strike Of My Sword?

However, right when she intended to charge into the horde of Darkbeasts, Luo Xue’s figure had suddenly obstructed her path. Liu Weiwei’s beautiful brows knit together slightly, and then she didn’t hesitate at all to stab her sword towards Luo Xue! When her sword shot forward, it actually carried the sound of wind and thunder, and the terrifying energy contained within it caused Luo Xue’s expression to change slightly!

3rd level Sword intent!

Yes, Liu Weiwei hadn’t held back, nor did she dare to do so. The strength of this mysterious Shapeshifted Darkbeast before her was truly too terrifying. If she were to still hold back, then not to mention rescuing those disciples of the Heavenly Sword Sect, even she herself would probably be annihilated in a short moment. So, she’d utilized her full strength as soon as she attacked, and she utilized her Sword Intent without holding back at all!

Luo Xue was slightly stunned at first when her Sword Intent enveloped him. Obviously, he hadn’t expected that Liu Weiwei had actually comprehended Sword Intent, and it was even at the 3rd level! However, in next to no time, he recovered his calm once more. When Liu Weiwei’s sword arrived around 1m away from him, he suddenly clenched his fist before he smashed it towards that sword which carried terrifying Sword Intent!

Bang!

His fist hadn’t even come into contact with the sword when the terrifying gale created by its movement shad blasted Liu Weiwei flying. The winds on Liu Weiwei’s shoulders flapped swiftly in midair, and her figure instantly slowed down before descending firmly on the ground.

Liu Weiwei’s pupils constricted when she looked at the sword in her hand. Because the center of her Earth Rank sword had completely sunken down! This is an Earth Rank Dark Treasure! Exactly how terrifying is his strength? Is this really a Darkbeast from a place with scarce profound energy like the southern territory?

A string of questions flashed swiftly and incessantly through Liu Weiwei’s mind....

At this moment, Yang Ye was extremely shocked as well. Such strength that’s capable of blasting 3rd level Sword Intent into dispersion with a single punch is truly extremely terrifying!

After all, even Yuan Tong was unable to accomplish this! However, Luo Xue was able to accomplish it with ease! So, his strength was truly extremely terrifying!

“Condensed Sword Intent and extremely swift reaction. As expected of a genius from the northern territory!” Luo Xue gazed at Liu Weiwei as he said, “Unfortunately, since all of you came to my Grand Myriad Mountains and killed the Darkbeasts of my Darkbeast Empire, then it’s best for all of you to just leave your lives behind!”

“AH!!” Right at this moment, an extremely miserable and shrill cry suddenly resounded. Everyone looked over towards the source of the voice, and they saw that the disciples that were being surrounded by the Darkbeasts had vanished. In next to no time, they shot their gazes towards the ground, and they noticed that the ground was covered in blood and body pieces....

A wisp of sorrow flashed in Liu Weiwei’s eyes when she saw this. Because some of those disciples had grown up with her. Even though they didn’t have a close relationship, they were still from the same sect. So, she was slightly unable to get over the emotions she felt after she watched them die before her!

After those Darkbeasts finished dealing with those disciples of the Heavenly Sword Sect, their gazes had locked onto Liu Weiwei and Cai Yanyan. Meanwhile, Yang Ye had moved over to stand before the two of them, and then he gazed at Luo Xue and said, “Let’s let the matter rest, alright?”

Luo Xue gazed at Yang Ye for a short while before he shook his head and said, “The Darkbeasts of my Darkbeast Empire can’t die for nothing. So, they must die!”

Yang Ye’s brows raised, and he said, “So, there’s no room for discussion, huh?”

“Yes!” Luo Xue spoke indifferently.

Yang Ye took a step forward, and then he said, “You ought to be clearly aware that numbers are useless against me when it’s against Darkbeasts. In other words, the two of us have to fight here?”

Luo Xue frowned lightly, and then he said, “According to my knowledge, you, Yang Ye, aren’t a person that draws his sword to defend the weak or wronged. So, I’m very curious about why you would help these two people from the northern territory! You seem to have only been acquainted with them for a few hours, right?”

“What he said is exactly what I want to ask!” Meanwhile, Liu Weiwei glanced at Yang Ye while a wisp of a complicated expression flashed in her eyes. She said, “I don’t know if you’re really that Yang Ye from the southern territory who has comprehended the Enlightened Sword Heart, but I know that you’re utterly not a match for him! I’m able to sense that he wouldn’t make a move against you if you intend to leave! However, you’ve chosen to stay behind. I’m very curious about why you’re acting in this way?”

Yang Ye chuckled, and then he replied with a question. “I’m very curious as well. Why did you choose to rescue me earlier? After all, I’m only at the First Heaven Realm, and I’m even a profounder from the southern territory!”

Liu Weiwei was stunned, and then she shook her head and said, “I didn’t think too much about it. I just felt that it was within my ability, so I did that!”

“It was withing your ability?” Yang Ye nodded, and then he smiled and said, “I’m doing something within my ability right now as well!”

Liu Weiwei glanced at Luo Xue, and then she said in a low voice, “He’s very strong. Even if you’re that Yang Ye who has attained the Enlightened Sword Heart, you’re absolutely not a match for him now!”

Meanwhile, Luo Xue said, “She’s very right. Yang Ye, I know that you can surmount realms of cultivation to do battle, and you even possessed stronger trump cards. However, I have to tell you that even if you utilize that Dao Artifact once more, you who hasn’t advanced into the King Realm would definitely lose. Out of consideration for ‘it’, I’ll allow you to leave, and we can have a fair fight once you advance into the King Realm in the future!”

“Perhaps you’re right....” Yang Ye smiled, and then he said with a serious expression, “But I have very few friends, and I just found one with great difficulty. How could I just watch as she dies? So, I intend to give it a try!”

“A friend?” Luo Xue shook his head and smiled, and then he pointed at Liu Weiwei and Cai Yanyan as he said, “Yang Ye, you seem to have taken all of this for granted. Just ask them, have they taken you to be their friend? Even if they say that they have, would you believe it? All of this is one-sided right now, understand?”

“Perhaps!” Yang Ye said with a smile on his face, “But I still intend to act in this way!”

“Give me a reason!” said Luo Xue in a low voice.

“A reason?” Yang Ye shook his head and said, “At many times, there’s no need for a reason when we do something, right? Besides that, whether they’ve taken me to be a friend of theirs isn’t important to me. What’s important is that I’m willing to take them as my friends, and that’s enough for me! At the very least, they were my friends earlier, and they are my friends right now. As for the future, that’s something for the future!”

Both of them went silent when they heard Yang Ye. Had they taken Yang Ye to be their friend? The answer was no. As for the reason, there were truly too many reasons. For example, they’d just met Yang Ye, they were members of the northern territory while Yang Ye was from the southern territory.... In short, as far as they were concerned, friendship was something that was gradually formed through a period of getting along with each other and possessing similar interests and goals....

However, Yang Ye had taken them to be his friends because of something they’d done without giving it any thought. Moreover, he was even willing to risk his life to help them. This caused both of them to be puzzled and bewildered!

Luo Xue gazed at Yang Ye for a short while before he said, “You don’t care about the thoughts of the world and only act according to your heart. Now, I slightly understand why you were able to comprehend 4th level Sword Intent and the Enlightened Sword Heart! Fine, out of consideration for ‘it’, I’ll let the two of them go if you’re able to withstand a punch of mine without moving backward. What do you think? Of course, if you’re unable to withstand it, then you can die along with the two of them!”

“I’ll do it!” Meanwhile, Liu Weiwei suddenly walked over to stand by Yang Ye’s side, and she glanced at Yang Ye before she said, “Third Rank Sect of the Northern Territory, the Heavenly Sword Sect’s Liu Weiwei!”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he smiled and said, “I don’t have many friends. You’ll be one from today onward!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned to look at Luo Xue before he said, “I know that you’re very strong, and I know that you weren’t bragging just now. However, why would I, Yang Ye, need someone to make concessions for me? Withstand a punch of yours without moving backward? How about we change the rules?”

“What do you mean!?” said Luo Xue in a low voice.

“HAHA!!” Yang Ye roared with laughter, and then he said, “If you’re able to withstand a strike of my sword without moving backward, then you can do as you please with the three of us. What do you think about that?”

Luo Xue’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he said in a low voice, “Yang Ye, could it be that you think that you’re extremely formidable because you seized the 1st position on the Ascension Rankings and defeated Yuan Tong!? I admit that if you attained the King Realm, then the chances of victory in a battle between the two of us would be 70:30. However, you’re only at the First Heaven Realm, so as I said before, I’ll still be able to kill you even if you utilize that Dao Artifact!”

“Why don’t we give it a try then?” said Yang Ye.

“As you wish!” Luo Xue spoke in a low voice, and then he suddenly stomped the ground with his right foot. Suddenly, the entire ground suddenly trembled violently like it was an earthquake! On the other hand, Luo Xue himself had instantly shot forward towards Yang Ye like a bolt of lightning. His speed was so swift that both Liu Weiwei and Cai Yanyan were unable to see his figure clearly!

At the instant that Luo Xue had moved, Yang Ye had flipped his palm, and then a low-grade Earth Rank sword had appeared in his hand. After that, the profound energy within his Dantian started circulating madly. In an instant, all the profound energy within his Dantian had surged violently into his sword. Moreover, his 4th level Sword Intent had even instantly sprayed out and wrapped around his sword. Once this was done, he added on the physical strength that he possessed before he slashed his sword down forcefully towards Luo Xue!

When facing this mysterious Shapeshifted Darkbeast, Yang Ye really didn’t dare be careless at all. However, he still didn’t utilize the Nether Ghostflames and 5th level Sword Intent. Yang Ye was confident that if he utilized any one of them, then blasting Luo Xue back would definitely be an extremely easy task. However, after a moment of hesitation, he’d chosen not to utilize them in the end!

They were his greatest trump cards right now. If he utilized them now, then they wouldn’t be trump cards anymore. Especially the Nether Ghostflames, he would absolutely not utilize it unless he was confident in his ability to kill his opponent. Because once he utilized it, it was very likely that it would bring down calamity upon him!

Under the astounded gazes of the two women, Yang Ye’s sword and Luo Xue’s fist collided forcefully with each other!

Bang!

A world shaking bang instantly resounded. At the same time, the ground where both of them stood had instantly collapsed....
