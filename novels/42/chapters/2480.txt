Chapter 2481 – Farewell!

Yang Ye had naturally given many things consideration when he decided to let Snowy and Erya go.

Firstly, Yang Lianshuang was a little weak, so he was worried about letting her make the trip alone. If he sent her there, that would be alright. However, he was the focus of countless powers, so if he returned with her, it may bring calamity to her home world.

Secondly, he was planning to travel to Eternal Kingdom, and his goal was firstly to retrieve Sword Scroll’s main body. Sword Scroll had helped him so much, and she needed help now, she he naturally wouldn’t refuse. Secondly, he wanted to take a look at Eternal Kingdom, especially their strength.

He still knew nothing about Eternal Kingdom right now!

Besides that, his trip was a dangerous one, so leaving them behind was a good thing for them. Because even if anything happened to him, they would be safe.

He treated it as giving them a vacation!

Erya and Snowy returned to the Primordial Pagoda. The two little fellows naturally planned to bid farewell to the others.

Only Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang remained in the hall.

She spoke softly, “You’re worried?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Suddenly, An Nanjing appeared by his side. He gazed at her, and she said, “I’ll go with them!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and agreed, “Alright!”

He could rest at ease with her going along.

Obviously, An Nanjing was a little worried about those two little demons, Erya and Snowy, going with Yang Lianshuang. Firstly, those two little fellows were quite lawless, and Yang Lianshuang couldn’t keep them in check at all. Secondly, she was worried about their safety and afraid they would do something bad.

Yang Lianshuang smiled, “Your presence is naturally for the best.”

Yang Ye was about to say something when they looked up into the air. A powerful wave of pressure was pressing down from above.

Yang Lianshuang said, “It’s probably the Origin Sky Sect!”

Yang Ye frowned.

They walked out of the hall while An Nanjing returned into the pagoda.

In the sky above the city, a middle aged man in a silver robe was floating there. Based on the aura he emanated, he was a Four World Realm expert. Besides that, there was an old man behind him, and the old man was a Three World Realm expert!

Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang appeared before the middle aged man, and the latter glanced at them before looking at Yang Ye, “You are?”

Yang Ye asked, “Are you subordinates of the desolate race?”

The middle aged man nodded, “Yes!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Go on, this city is under my protection, so don’t disturb it again.”

The middle aged man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Aren’t you a little too confident?”

Yang Ye glanced at him, “I’ll give Huang Ying face and ask you one last time, are you going to leave or not?”

The middle aged man spoke solemnly, “You know Huang Ying?”

Yang Ye replied, “He’s a friend of mine. Right, I’m Yang Ye. Have you heard of me?”

“Yang Ye?” The middle aged man shook his head, “I haven’t.”

Yang Ye was quite embarrassed. He glanced at Yang Lianshuang and smiled embarrassedly, “This world isn’t well-informed. It has nothing to do with me!”

Suddenly, the middle aged man said, “No matter who you are, since you dared to interfere in my Origin Sky Sect’s business, then…”

A sword howl resounded abruptly, and then the middle aged man’s voice stopped.

A moment later, his head fell off his neck while blood sprayed out like a fountain.

The old man was stunned, but it didn’t take him long to recover from his shock. He glanced at Yang Ye and vanished into the sky.

Yang Lianshuang asked, “Aren’t you going to kill him?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “They won’t let this go. So, let’s wait for someone who can make the decisions. I can’t be bothered to go looking for them!”

She nodded in response.

Yang Ye asked, “When do you plan to leave?”

Yang Lianshuang thought for a moment and replied, “Anytime!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’m going to see those two little fellows!”

Yang Ye went back into the Primordial Pagoda.

At this moment, Snowy and Erya had bade farewell to all the demons. The demon beasts were unwilling to see them go. They were truly unwilling because while Erya always trained them, they couldn’t get used to her suddenly leaving. As for Snowy, it was worse. It could be said that in the beginning, they had only been willing to stay here because of Snowy. Now that Snowy was leaving, they were naturally extremely reluctant.

Luckily, it was just for some time!

Snowy raised her paw to tell them it was the amount of time she was going.

However, no demon knew how long that represented. Five days? Five months? Five years? Of course, even if it was 50 years, it was a very, very short amount of time for them.

Yang Ye summoned Erya and Snowy, and he shook his head and smiled when he saw the excitement on their faces. They were really like children!

Yang Ye restrained his smile and spoke seriously, “Don’t cause trouble, understand?”

They hurriedly nodded.

At this moment, they would agree to anything Yang Ye said.

In the end, Yang Ye told them a lot, and they agreed to everything.

Actually, Yang Ye wasn’t very worried. After all, An Nanjing would be going with them, so there would be no need to worry about their safety. Because Erya’s strength was extremely terrifying too.

When she left the pagoda, Snowy intentionally showed the trees with spirit energy. This time, she buried over a dozen World Crystals beneath them. Besides that, she told the Primordial Pagoda to give them Primordial Violet Energy while she was away.

Once she did all of that, Snowy, Erya, and An Nanjing left the Primordial Pagoda with Yang Ye.

On the Ascension Platform, all the demons sent Snowy and Erya off.

Outside the hall.

An old man had arrived there, Elder Yuan.

Yang Ye smiled, “Long time no see!”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye, shook his head, and smiled, “Your strength is unfathomable now.”

Yang Ye smiled, “You’ve improved very quickly too. You’re a Two World Realm expert already!”

Elder Yuan shook his head, “I’m just dragging out my existence. I know my own potential, and the Three World Realm or perhaps Four World Realm is my limit. But your future is limitless.”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He hesitated for a moment and asked, “Are you going to Eternal Kingdom?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Elder Yuan spoke solemnly, “I’ve investigated Eternal Border, the desolate race, and Eternal Kingdom, so I know a little. Going now is probably quite dangerous for you!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I won’t go there openly, I plan to sneak in there.”

Elder Yuan hesitated for a moment and nodded, “Alright, as long as you’re aware of the dangers.”

Meanwhile, the others suddenly looked outside the hall, and a voice came from there, “I’m the Vice Commander of the desolate race. I would like to request an audience with Young Master Yang!”

The desolate race!

Yang Ye walked out, and he saw a middle aged man in black armor not too far away. The man bowed slightly to Yang Ye, “Young Master Yang.”

Yang Ye asked, “What’s going on with the Origin Sky Sect?”

The man replied, “They are a subordinate power of my desolate race. We weren’t aware that this country is a power you established. This is a misunderstanding, and I hope you forgive us for any offense!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “It’s nothing serious. This small city isn’t of any help to the desolate race or Eternal Kingdom. So, just let it stay neutral, alright?”

The man hurriedly replied, “Of course! This city will be under my desolate race’s protection from now on, and if necessary, you just have to send someone to notify the Origin Sky Sect if you need anything!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Thank you!”

The man bowed slightly to Yang Ye, “Farewell.”

He vanished into the distance once he finished speaking.

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang said, “They really give you a lot of face, huh?”

Yang Ye replied, “I’m friends with their crown prince. Anyway, let’s get back to the important matters at hand. Have you made arrangements for the city?”

She nodded, “I’ve practically done everything, and it’ll be fine with Elder Yuan here. No chaos will arise in the city. The main issue is the desolate race and Eternal Kingdom. If they enter into a war with each other, we will probably suffer because of it. However, I can rest at ease now that I’ve witnessed your influence.”

She gazed at Erya and Snowy, and she continued, “As for you two little fellows. You better be obedient, understand?”

Be obedient!

They hurriedly nodded. They would agree to anything right now.

Yang Lianshuang grinned and gazed at Yang Ye, “You take care too. Especially about your terrible temper. Try to change it appropriately. Especially in Eternal Kingdom, try to keep a low profile as much as possible.”

Yang Ye smiled, “I will.”

“Big Brother Yang!” Suddenly, Erya said, “Snowy and I are going to enjoy ourselves for a few days, and we’ll return once we’re done. So, stay alive so we can see you again. Snowy and I would be very sad if we don’t see you again. But don’t worry, we will avenge you!”

Yang Ye knocked her on the head, “Don’t say such things.”

She cracked a smile and showed him her tongue.

Snowy flew over to Yang Ye, hugged him and kissed him before waving her paws swiftly. She was telling him to be careful and take care.

A long time passed before Yang Ye rubbed her little head and smiled, “Don’t worry, I’m very strong, right?”

Snowy cracked a smile, hugged Yang Ye again, and rubbed her head against his head.

Yang Ye gazed at An Nanjing, “Be careful!”

She nodded, “You too!”

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang formed a strange seal with both hands. In an instant, a huge blue array of light appeared outside the hall.

Yang Ye watched as she took An Nanjing, Erya, and Snowy along with her as she entered the array of light.

Erya and Snowy waved at Yang Ye. As Snowy gazed and gazed at Yang Ye, her tears suddenly surged out, and she wanted to go back on her decision!

She didn’t want to go anymore!

But it was a little too late.

The formation activated, and Yang Ye watched as all of them vanished.

Yang Ye just stared blankly ahead on the spot for a long time.

Farewells!

It was a truly terrible feeling!
