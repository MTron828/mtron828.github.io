Chapter 2739 – Order!

Gluttony!

In the Primordial Pagoda, everyone knew that Erya had a problem with being a glutton.

Gluttony!

She practically dared to eat anything. Of course, it was only limited to the especially good or especially evil.

Under normal circumstances, she had the greatest urge to eat Snowy. If she ate Snowy… no one knew what kind of heights she would attain.

However, that would never happen. She was so close with Snowy that they could share the same tanghulu!

However, the divine vein wasn’t that close to her.

Yang Ye rushed out of the cultivation room with Su Qingshi.

He knew that Erya wanted to eat the divine vein because it was her nature.

Her nature!

Erya wasn’t human, she was a demon beast. While she was like half a human, her nature was still there.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye and Su Qingshi to arrive before Erya.

Yang Ye and Su Qingshi’s expressions changed when they arrived.

The divine vein’s head was on the ground, and both Erya and Snowy were on its head.

The divine vein had been completely suppressed!

Snowy heaved a sigh of relief when she saw Yang Ye and hurriedly brought Erya over to Yang Ye. After that, she started waving her paws.

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head and gazed at Erya. He spoke softly “Erya, you can’t eat that, understand?”

She puckered her lips, “But I really want to. Big Brother Yang, if I eat it, I’ll definitely be able to immediately finish absorbing that fragment of my inner core, and then I can help you in battle!”

Yang Ye frowned.

Erya lowered her head and felt slightly guilty when she saw him frown.

Erya only feared and respected two people, Yang Ye and An Nanjing.

Yang Ye walked over to her and rubbed her head gently, “Erya, if you eat me or Snowy, you’ll become unprecedentedly strong, so will you?”

She decisively shook her head, and then she looked up at Yang Ye, “If a day comes when I try to hurt you or Snowy, then I’ll blast my head apart first.”

She spoke firmly and seriously. She wasn’t joking at all.

Yang Ye replied in a gentle tone, “But have you not realized? You’re on the verge of losing control of yourself.”

She looked down.

Especially after she absorbed the inner cores, she had been growing more and more violent and vicious, and she was growing closer to losing control of herself.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Erya, you were very, very strong in the past. If you can’t control yourself, you’ll be very likely to become that same person. At that time, it’s very likely that you’ll harm me and Snowy.”

Snowy hurriedly nodded while she stood on Yang Ye’s shoulder.

She was very close to Erya, but even she felt quite afraid of Erya’s aura lately.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

During their prime, Erya and Snowy were counters to each other, but at the same time, they feared each other!

Yang Ye added, “Erya, trust me. Strength doesn’t come from eating. Of course, you can grow stronger from eating it. However, you will never become extremely strong. Cultivation, you need to cultivate. You must overcome yourself.”

Erya glanced at the divine vein, and then she shook her head and spoke softly, “I won’t eat it anymore!”

She sounded a little aggrieved!

Yang Ye chuckled, “Don’t be like that. You want to eat it because of its spirit energy. So, how about we get Snowy and it to give you some spirit energy every day?”

Snowy hurriedly nodded to display her agreement.

Erya nodded, “Alright!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t feel aggrieved. You can’t eat someone on our side, but if it’s an enemy, you can eat anyone you like!”

Erya’s eyes lit up, and she patted Yang Ye’s hand, “Big Brother Yang, you’re the best!”

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled. What a greedy little fellow!

At the same time, he heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. Erya’s nature was something he couldn’t just suppress because suppressing it too much would lead to problems.

But if he didn’t suppress it, then Erya may eat the entire world instead!

Yang Ye rubbed Erya’s head again, and then he went over to the divine vein. It had been beaten up quite badly by Erya! Fortunately, Snowy had stopped her in time, and she hadn’t tried to kill it, so the divine vein wasn’t seriously injured!

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Sorry!”

The divine vein glanced at Erya and shook its head slightly, “It’s fine.”

Yang Ye gazed at Erya, and Erya lowered her head. She kicked the ground with her right foot and feigned ignorance.

Snowy blinked, and then she patted Erya on the shoulder. She was telling Erya to hurry up and admit her mistakes.

In any case, she just had to do that and Yang Ye would forgive her.

It always worked!

In the end, Erya walked over to the divine vein, and the latter seemed extremely afraid of her!

Erya was a terribly huge threat to sprites that were good. Of course, she was a huge threat to sprites that were evil too!

Erya glanced at the divine vein and spoke indifferently, “Sorry, I won’t try to eat you again.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. He rubbed her head and said, “I’ll take you to the border of the Four Dimensional Universe another day, and we’ll go look for that shadow giant you had that day.”

Erya’s eyes lit up, “Really?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Erya chuckled, “Big Brother Yang, you’re the best in the world.”

Snowy blinked and felt that Erya was really good at flattery!

Yang Ye chuckled, rubbed her head, and said, “Go have some fun then continue cultivating!”

Erya nodded, and then she pranced off with Snowy, “Snowy, I don’t really like that Heaven Executor of yours. Let me eat it…”

Snowy blinked and stretched out a paw to her mouth. There was a tanghulu there!

Snowy cracked a smile to Erya. Obviously, she was telling her to just eat some tanghulus!

Erya licked the tanghulu and passed it to Snowy. Snowy licked it and was quite satisfied by its taste.

Erya walked off with Snowy, “Snowy, I’ll tell you a secret. But don’t tell Big Brother Yang.”

Snowy nodded seriously.

She sneaked a glance at Yang Ye and said, “I feel like in a short while from now, I can fight 10 people like Big Brother Yang!”

Snowy stopped licking the tanghulu, gazed at Erya, and kept blinking.

Erya said, “I’m serious!”

She was very serious!

Snowy glanced at Yang Ye, and then she gazed at Erya. Snowy waved her paws. She was telling Erya to keep a low profile or she would be beaten up!

Erya nodded, “Yes, I should!”

Just like that, the two little fellows vanished into the distance.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye glanced at them, shook his head and smiled, and then gazed at the divine vein, “I overlooked this. I’m sorry.”

The divine vein shook its head, “She’s still a child. Don’t worry about it.”

A child!

Yang Ye grinned and had a better impression of the divine veins. It was an ancient being that had lived for countless years after all, so it was tolerant and magnanimous.

Meanwhile, the divine vein suddenly said, “This place is very good!”

Yang Ye gazed at it, and it spoke softly, “It’s better than the outside world. I’m willing to stay here for a long time.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “The outside…”

The divine vein shook its head, “You know… regardless of whether it’s the human race, demon race, or any other race, their greed knows no limits. Besides that, I don’t owe them anything. I don’t belong to them either. I only stayed in Eternal Kingdom to repay the debt I owed them. Now, I’ve repaid that debt, so no one can stop me from leaving.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “If you wish to stay, you’re absolutely welcome to. Of course, if you want to leave, I guarantee that I won’t stop you. You can leave whenever you want!”

The divine vein glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Thank you!”

Yang Ye nodded and left with Su Qingshi.

At the rear mountains of the Sword Sect.

Yang Ye and Su Qingshi strolled through the mountains with a light breeze against their faces and flowers swaying around them.

They didn’t speak and just walked with their hands held together.

A short while later, they arrived before a cliff, and the distant sky was a scene of peace.

Su Qingshi rested her head gently on Yang Ye’s shoulder, “Do you know how many years we’ve known each other for?”

Yang Ye’s face froze. A moment later, he shook his head.

He really didn’t know.

She spoke softly, “If we exclude the time you spent in the cultivation room, it’s almost 30 years now.”

Yang Ye wrapped his right arm around her waist and remained silent.

She spoke softly, “But we haven’t even been together for more than five years.”

Yang Ye’s figure trembled slightly.

She looked up at him and grinned. It was a grin that made all flowers dim in comparison.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “I’m sorry!”

Su Qingshi shook her head, “You and I are one, so there’s no need for that!”

She looked into the distance, “I’m not blaming you. Countless people have gradually vanished as you continued on your path. It’s amazing that we were able to come here and still stay together.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and spoke softly, “The End World is scheming against you to make you the public enemy of the entire world. I know you don’t care, but there is a better way to resolve it, isn’t there?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Su Qingshi wrapped her arm around his waist and didn’t say another word.

Meanwhile, a transmission stone in Yang Ye’s pocket trembled. Yang Ye withdrew it, and a voice came from within, “The End World is gathering the experts of the entire universe. They say it’s to take action against you. They may be trying to use those experts to do something. Be careful.”

Yang Ye fell silent for an instant and smiled, “Help me spread a message!”

The voice resounded, “What is it?”

Yang Ye looked up into the distant sky, “Tell them that I’ll be constructing a paradise city in the south. Everyone can come, and the spirit energy there will never dry up.”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, “Eternal Kingdom is too chaotic. No, the Three Dimensional Universe is too chaotic. Destiny’s order is too overbearing, cruel, and selfish. It’s time for it to end. I will use my sword to create a new order. But before I do that, I will slaughter the End World, annihilate the strongest form of Destiny, and deal with the Four Dimensional Universe!”

A sword howl suddenly resounded through the sky.

Yang Ye didn’t know that his words had caused an unprecedented Sword Dao to appear in this world.

A Sword Dao that surpassed all Sword Daos.
