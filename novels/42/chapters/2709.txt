Chapter 2710 – Demonic Sword Dao!

Despair!

As soon as he saw Snowy like that, Yang Ye collapsed!

Snowy had been someone he’d always wanted to protect!

Yang Ye sent Snowy’s ethereal figure into the Primordial Pagoda, and then he turned around and walked toward the woman.

A smile was still there on her face.

She’d watched too many moments of life and death.

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Hiss!

A ray of blood red light tore through space.

At this moment, Yang Ye was unprecedentedly strong!

At most times, love gave people power and could unearth someone’s potential, but hatred could do the same!

Not to mention that Yang Ye had unearthed all his potential right now!

It was an absolutely powerful attack!

However, it wasn’t strong to this woman who’d killed countless peak experts!

The extreme didn’t represent the strongest!

She casually swung her sword and stabbed it against the tip of Yang Ye’s sword.

Clang!

Yang Ye’s sword chook violently, and then Yang Ye’s body cracked open. However, he twisted his sword and slashed down along the side of the woman’s sword.

But such a swift strike had struck nothing but air!

The woman had suddenly appeared where Yang Ye had been standing a short while ago!

Yang Ye didn’t stop and just slashed at her.

Slash after slash!

A solemn expression gradually appeared on her face!

There were many types of Sword Daos in the world, like the Emotionless Sword Dao and the Sword Dao of Emotion, but there was another type as well. The Sword Dao of Hatred.

The Sword Dao of Hatred could actually be called a Demonic Sword Dao.

Because someone with it had entered the devil path.

It was a rarely seen form of the Sword Dao, and only sword cultivators with absolute hatred could attain it and master its essence. Now, Yang Ye had clearly entered into such a state!

The strength of Yang Ye’s attacks was rising madly, and each swing was stronger than the last!

It was very, very unusual!

Any Sword Dao was terrifying at its limits!

On the mountain peak, Yang Ye swung his sword madly, and as time went by, the woman’s figure gradually turned slightly ethereal with every swing of his sword.

At this moment, she couldn’t suppress Yang Ye anymore!

Even she found it difficult to believe!

Very, very difficult to believe!

Because she was very well aware of the gap between Yang Ye and her, and it could be said that Yang Ye should be unable to fight back against her. Yet now, he was showing signs of suppressing her!

Even though it was just a clone of hers and not her main body!

But it still filled her with disbelief.

There was some interest in her eyes!

Just like that, Yang Ye attacked for quite some time before he leaped up, and then a blood red ray of sword energy slashed down from the sky.

It seemed like it could slash the world apart!

It didn’t just seem like it, it could!

The attack descended!

The woman looked up slightly and raised her sword to block it!

Bam!

Boom!

The entire mountain collapsed inch by inch, and the Destiny Dimension started turning ethereal.

This attack had destroyed the entire Destiny Dimension!

However, the woman was still there while Yang Ye was on the ground. But her body was ethereal to the extreme like it was just a wisp of smoke, and it would vanish at any moment!

The entire Destiny Dimension was in pieces!

Yang Ye fell slowly from midair, and his body and soul were gradually vanishing.

It was the price he paid for going insane!

It was a price he couldn’t afford to pay!

Suddenly, a ray of white light enveloped Yang Ye, and then it vanished.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye appeared on the Ascension Platform.

Snowy was by his side!

Snowy!

At this moment, Snowy was completely fine. Of course, how could her fragile heart endure seeing Yang Ye like that? So she immediately started crying.

A short while later, she seemed to have thought of something and started waving the Sprite Staff, and then countless strands of spirit energy converge toward Yang Ye.

At this moment, Snowy was doing all she could!

Just like that, more and more spirit energy appeared, and Yang Ye was fully enveloped in spirit energy. The destruction of his body actually stopped, but his soul was still vanishing.

It would take around 20 breaths of time at most for his soul to vanish completely!

At that time, Yang Ye would cease to exist!

Because if his soul vanished, it would be permanent death!

At this moment, Snowy was truly panicking!

Meanwhile, Su Qingshi and Zi’er were at the Ascension Platform too.

Their expressions changed at the sight of Yang Ye, and then Su Qingshi gazed at Snowy.

Snowy was absolutely anxious and at a loss for what to do!

Suddenly, Past Life floated over to Yang Ye and shook slightly. A moment later, strands of Past Life Energy surged out from it and into Yang Ye.

Besides that, the Past Life Profound Energy within Yang Ye circulated automatically, and then Past Life Energy enveloped his soul.

In an instant, Yang Ye’s burning soul actually stopped vanishing!

It was working!

Snowy was stunned for a moment, but it didn’t take long for her to recover from her shock. After that, she opened her mouth, and then countless strands of Past Life Energy and Past Life Profound Energy converged to Yang Ye.

Past Life Profound Energy!

She’d asked for it from the patriarch of the Past Life Clan that day!

With her there to foster it, the Past Life Profound Energy and Past Life Energy she possessed was countless times more than what Yang Ye had. It couldn’t be helped, no one could compete with her in this aspect!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye’s soul to gradually stabilize, but Yang Ye was still weak and unconscious.

At least he wasn’t dead!

Su Qingshi, Zi’er, and Snowy heaved sighs of relief.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

The Destiny Dimension was collapsing, but the woman hadn’t fully vanished. She glanced down where Yang Ye was and grinned, “Interesting!”

Her figure dispersed completely.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Snowy was still giving Yang Ye spirit energy. Just like that, an entire day passed before Yang Ye slowly opened his eyes, but Snowy was so exhausted she was sleeping on him.

A voice came from the side, “You’re awake?”

Yang Ye was stunned for a moment and looked over. He saw Su Qingshi and Zi’er. A moment later, he looked down and saw Snowy. Snowy was snoring there!

Snowy was alive!

Tears instantly seeped out of Yang Ye’s eyes.

Meanwhile, Su Qingshi took Yang Ye’s hand, “Are you alright?”

Her voice was trembling slightly.

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s little head, gazed at Su Qingshi, and nodded slightly.

Su Qingshi touched Yang Ye’s face and said, “Don’t do something stupid like that again!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I was foolish to think this Destiny would be the same as the rest. It was a terrible mistake.”

He closed his eyes slowly.

This Destiny was unlike the other three. She truly thought of herself as a god, and he could sense that she was really egotistical. Moreover, her way of thinking was unlike the rest.

She clearly wanted to carry through with the rules she’d made in the past.

Fortunately, she’d only been a clone. If it was her main body, he would have never had a chance to survive!

A long time passed before Yang Ye gazed at Su Qingshi and spoke softly, “Why is Snowy all fine and well?”

Su Qingshi replied softly, “I don’t know. I was shocked when she was sent back in here. But after Snowy dispersed completely, she actually condensed into form once more, and then she was completely fine like nothing had happened.”

She’d condensed into form again!

Yang Ye frowned slightly. He thought for a long time and couldn’t figure it out. Because the woman hadn’t held back, and he could sense that she wanted to kill Snowy!

But Snowy was still all fine and well!

Meanwhile, Snowy suddenly rubbed her head against Yang Ye’s chest. Yang Ye looked down and saw Snowy holding tight to him as if she was worried he would vanish!

Yang Ye and Su Qingshi exchanged glances and smiled at each other.

Two hours later, Yang Ye had recovered by almost 50%.

Yang Ye carried Snowy’s sleeping figure with him and went to the cultivation room. He sat down cross-legged and placed Snowy on his shoulder.

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly!

Recall everything that happened earlier!

His sword had undergone a change during that battle

Hatred!

At that time, he felt boundless energy surge into him, and it came from hatred!

At that moment, the strength of his sword far surpassed what it used to be, and it had surpassed its normal strength by countless times!

Now, he wanted to master that strength!

A Sword Dao that came from extreme hatred!

He’d opened up a new door for himself!

An extreme form of the Sword Dao, just like the Unfettered One’s Emotionless Sword Dao.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

They were all at an extreme!

Yang Ye recalled what happened to Snowy, and his body instantly turned blood red.

Monstrous killing intent!

Yang Ye’s sword gradually started to tremble, and even he became quite unusual.

The Sword Dao of Hatred was a Demonic Sword Dao.

It was a true part of the devil path.

Because when one’s emotions went out of control, one would lose their mind!

Actually, it was like his past Mad Demon Bloodline, but the difference was that he went mad due to his bloodline in the past, and now, he was going mad because of the sword.

Madness with the sword!

In the cultivation room, Yang Ye seemed to have gone fully insane, and the entire Primordial Pagoda started to shake.

Countless living beings looked toward the cultivation room with fear and shock in their eyes!
