Chapter 2811 – All Four!

The woman in black glanced coldly at Yang Ye, “Scare you? You think I’m trying to scare you?”

Yang Ye smiled bitterly, “Then tell me what the heck is she planning?”

The woman in black shook her head, “You’ll find out soon.”

Yang Ye’s smile grew even more bitter, “I’m worried I wouldn’t be able to survive until then.”Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

She fell silent for a short while and said, “Come with me!”

She walked off.

Yang Ye followed her.

He naturally didn’t have a good impression of the strongest form of Destiny, but he still had a very good impression of the woman in black and the woman in white.

They walked through space for around two hours before they arrived at an unknown world.

They descended to the ground, and they arrived at the peak of a mountain.

Yang Ye saw two people there, and he was stunned by the sight of them.

It was because they were Tu and the woman in white!

They were all gathered here!

The woman in white grinned when she saw Yang Ye, and it could be considered as her way of greeting him. Tu didn’t offer any reaction and she just remained the same.

Yang Ye moved his gaze away and looked at the woman in black, “Where are we?”

She replied indifferently, “The Primal World, a world I established in my prime. It’s the strongest place in the Three Dimensional Universe. This place was even able to endure me in my prime!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why did you bring me here?” Yang Ye was quite curious.

The woman in white walked over to Yang Ye, glanced at him, and smiled, “Your Sword Dao is at the Ordinary Sword Realm, and it can be said that few are able to be a match for you in the Three Dimensional Universe. However, your opponent just had to be her, and she attained the Ordinary Sword many, many years ago. You have no advantage in battle against her.”

Yang Ye replied, “I know.”

He glanced at the three of them, “Do you have a way to deal with her?”

“Don’t bother thinking about that!” Tu suddenly spoke, “She is at an unprecedented height. You can only defeat her in a head-on battle. Formations, schemes, and the like are just a joke before her!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Even your joint forces can’t rival her strength?”

The woman in white shook her head, “No, I should say that we don’t even have 20% confidence!”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “While we can’t, you may be able to succeed!”

“Me?” Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “I’m not a match for her either!”

He wasn’t being humble, he really was no match for her! He’d even used the Fate Sword Dao earlier, but he was still incapable of pushing back her sword, Justice. If the Unfettered One hadn’t lent him a hand, he would probably be dead!

Because he could sense that the woman really didn’t want to wait any longer!

The woman in white nodded slightly, “While your current strength is still no match for her, your strength is relatively closer to her, and you have a very good chance to get close to her and even defeat her!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I don’t know if I can win, but I know that I will definitely try.”

A fight would break out between him and Destiny, sooner or later. He was very well aware of that, and he’d never thought he could avoid it! Of course, he was very well aware that it may be his last battle!

The woman in white smiled, “It’s good that you have that kind of mentality. We brought you here because we wanted to improve your Sword Dao and combat strength!”

“Improve my Sword Dao and combat strength?” Yang Ye was quite curious, “How?”

She grinned, “The three of us together!”

Yang Ye gazed at them, and then he understood what they meant.

The simplest way to improve was battle. Now, based on his current strength, it was very difficult to find someone who was his equal. However, the three of them were perfect for that!

Yang Ye grabbed his sword and seemed quite impatient, “Which one of you will go first?”

“Me!” It was the woman in black!

The woman in white grinned and moved 3km back with Tu.

The woman in black stretched out her right hand, and the Great Unknown appeared in her grasp. She didn’t waste her breath and just floated forward. A ray of black light shot at Yang Ye like a bolt of lightning, and it was even faster than any bolt of lightning!

Yang Ye remained motionless on the spot while his heart remained calm. He wasn’t looking down on her, but his Sword Dao was like that. He remained calm against all things!

A short moment later, the black sword energy arrived. Meanwhile, Yang Ye stabbed his sword forward, and it accurately stabbed against the black sword energy.

Hiss!

The black sword energy was split open at the center, and Yang Ye’s sword shot straight forward at the woman in black!

The woman in black looked straight at the sword energy before her, and a sword stabbed forward when the sword energy was just a few inches away from her forehead.

Clang!

Along with a clear and resounding sword howl, Yang Ye’s sword moved a few dozen inches to the side. Meanwhile, the woman in black pressed forward and stabbed at Yang Ye’s stomach!

She’d instantly taken the offensive!

Yang Ye took a small step back, and it perfectly created space between him and her. Her sword stopped a few inches away from his stomach, and it was just the amount of distance he’d moved!

As soon as her attack failed, she tapped the tip of her foot against the ground and shot backward. Meanwhile, a ray of sword energy arrived before her forehead, and it was practically right against her forehead! However, it still remained a tiny distance away from her!

The woman in black suddenly stopped and spun around. Yang Ye’s sword just grazed by her shoulder, and her sword arrived before Yang Ye’s throat! She’d taken the offensive once more!

At the instant she stabbed at him, Yang Ye bent his body halfway. The sword failed to stab his throat, and his sword shot at her hand which was holding her sword!

It was practically a perfect string of movements!

At this moment, it was too late for her to pull her sword back, but she didn’t try to either. She just released it and swung a forward kick.

It was aimed at Yang Ye’s nether regions!

If it hit, then Yang Ye’s balls would probably explode from the force of it!

Yang Ye would naturally not dare to risk them. So, he tapped his feet down and floated over 1m back, but his retreat allowed her imposing aura to rise explosively.

The woman in black raised her palm, and the sword returned to her grasp. A moment later, she slashed it at Yang Ye!

It was like she was trying to chop firewood! It was simple, direct, and overbearing!

Yang Ye frowned slightly. He felt that he’d underestimated her slightly! As far as he was concerned, his strength should be much stronger than them after attaining the Ordinary Sword, but it seemed like that wasn’t the case at all!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and retreated instead of pressing forward. After that, he dashed forward and slashed with both hands!

A head-on collision!

If it had been a collision of technique just now, then it was a collision of strength now!

Two rays of sword energy slammed against each other.

Boom!

They immediately split apart, and both of them were pushed backward repeatedly. But just a moment later, the woman in black appeared behind Yang Ye!

The Great Unknown!

Great Unknown has the ability to travel through space!

Her sudden appearance behind him made Yang Ye feel a trace of danger for the first time, and at the same time he sensed danger, the aura of the sword intent within the Sword Precursor grew stronger…

The more danger he experienced, the stronger it became!

Yang Ye practically instinctively turned around and swung his sword!

Bang!

As soon as it descended, the woman in black was blasted backward! But he was pushed backward repeatedly as well!

Meanwhile, the woman in black suddenly appeared behind him again and stabbed at his back once more!

This sudden turn of events made Yang Ye’s expression change slightly. Because he noticed that when he pushed her back earlier, she’d appeared behind him while being pushed back. At this moment, the force pushing her back had been transformed into a force that pushed her forward, and it had become part of the explosive force behind her attack. The strength of this attack of hers was equivalent to the strength of his previous attack. Moreover, it had her own strength combined into it as well!

Yang Ye didn’t allow his thoughts to wander and swung his sword.

Bang!

The woman in black was blasted away once more, but just an instant later, she appeared behind him again. Moreover, the force within her sword had grown even stronger!

She was perfectly utilizing his strength against him!

Yang Ye turned around and swung his sword once more, and his strength was even greater this time.

Brute force!

If his strength far exceeded her own, it could instantly blast through this move of hers! However, he was disappointed. Not only did she endure it, she turned it against him once more while arriving behind him again… Her attack’s current strength was many times greater than before!

Yang Ye had quite a solemn expression on his face.

This move of hers seemed like it grew stronger with the opponent she faced!

Just like that, Yang Ye was being suppressed by her! However, the aura he emanated was growing increasingly stronger as well!

Every time she suppressed him, his sword intent would grow slightly stronger! It was the same for her too. As his strength grew, so did the strength of her attacks!

They seemed quite similar!

Tu suddenly asked, “Who do you think will be the last one standing?”

The woman in white replied softly, “She has been fighting the Four Dimensional Universe for countless years, so her combat instinct and technique surpass him!”

Tu asked, “So he has no chance?”

The woman in white smiled, “What do you think?”

Tu gazed at Yang Ye and the woman in black, “His strongest move is the Fate Sword Dao. When she truly pushed him into a moment of life and death, his Fate Sword Dao will become unprecedentedly powerful.”

The woman in white smiled, “And?”

Tu continued, “And… If she can endure it and utilize its strength, then he would lose. If she fails, she will lose!”

The woman in white nodded slightly and seemed to agree with Tu.

“No! She has lost!” Suddenly, a voice came from nearby.

Tu’s eyes narrowed slightly, and when she looked over, she saw a woman in a plain dress walking slowly in their direction.

It was the strongest form of Destiny who resided high above the clouds!
