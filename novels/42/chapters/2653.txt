Chapter 2654 – Let’s be Reasonable!

Just like that, she entered the Primordial Pagoda!

When Yang Ye wanted to enter it as well, his expression suddenly changed drastically. It was because he noticed that the Primordial Pagoda had actually sealed itself. Or to be more precise, he couldn’t sense it anymore!

Yang Ye’s face instantly fell. Suddenly, he looked up, and a strange vortex suddenly appeared in the distant sky!

A short while later, a pair of eyes appeared within the vortex.

The eyes glanced at the area below, and then its gaze fell on Yang Ye.

Yang Ye hurriedly looked down and walked forward.

A short while later, the eyes gradually turned ethereal, and the vortex vanished.

Once it vanished, Yang Ye fell weakly to the ground.

He was exhausted!

For some reason, he felt absolutely exhausted right now!

At the same time, he could sense the Primordial Pagoda again.

Yang Ye entered the pagoda.

The atmosphere in the pagoda was very, very strange right now. Because there was an uninvited guest!

Unlike Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu, she’d once tried to kill Yang Ye.

So, the entire Primordial Pagoda wasn’t very friendly to her. Or it should be said that it was filled with hostility toward her.

But she was too strong, and none of them could defeat her!

At the rear mountains of the Sword Sect, she made a wooden house for herself on the peak of a mountain.

As soon as she’d come in here, she’d started to absorb a huge amount of Primordial Violet Energy in here, and she’d even absorbed Snowy’s Eternal Energy.

Yang Ye went over to the wooden house, and she was seated cross-legged within it.

She glanced at Yang Ye, but quickly moved her gaze away from him.

Snowy pointed at her from Yang Ye’s shoulder.

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s little head and walked over to the wooden house, “So, is that it?”

She opened her eyes and gazed at him, “What else?”

Yang Ye said, “I’ve heard from her that all of you once killed the Heaven Dao.”

She gazed at Yang Ye in silence.

Yang Ye continued, “As far as I’m concerned, you were oppressed, and so you defied the heavens. Yet now, just look at yourself. Are you any different from the Heaven Dao of the past? You kill without reason, you bully, and you’re absolutely unreasonable. Be honest, don’t you think you’re going too far?”

She gazed at Yang Ye, “Go on!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and continued, “Let me say this in advance. We’re reasoning with each other, not fighting!”

Snowy blinked and gazed at Yang Ye. She felt like something was off because he usually fought before reasoning with people!

Yang Ye rubbed her head and whispered something in her ear.

Snowy blinked. Really?

Yang Ye ignored the little fellow who was full of questions and gazed at the woman, “I saw that vortex, and that pair of eyes out there. If I’m not wrong, you were hiding from that, and so you fled into my pagoda and used it to hide from that pair of eyes, right?”

She spoke indifferently, “Go on! Continue!”

Yang Ye said, “You’re injured now, and this place of mine is a paradise of healing. So, in the end, I’m helping you. You don’t deny that, right?”

She gazed coldly at him and remained silent.

Yang Ye braced himself and continued, “You can recuperate here, but I think we need to have a talk. I’m sure you’ve noticed that besides me, the other living beings here in this world are just ordinary living beings. I hope you won’t hurt them.”

She glanced at Snowy who was standing on Yang Ye’s shoulder and said, “She’s not an ordinary living being.”

Snowy blinked.

Yang Ye spoke seriously, “Since you’ve mentioned Snowy, I have to say a few things. Perhaps I can understand why you kill others, it’s because you don’t want them to enter the Four Dimensional Universe. But the Sprite Progenitor is a sprite born from the world, and she is absolutely pure and kind. Why do you refuse to spare her too?”

The woman in black replied coldly, “Absolutely pure and kind? You must be living in a dream!”

Yang Ye pointed at Snowy and said, “Ask yourself, is she bad? Does she have any ambition? Does she want to rule over the Three Dimensional Universe? Does she?”

Snowy was very cooperative and hurriedly shook her head.

She glanced at Snowy and said, “She’s young, so she naturally wouldn’t think of that now.”

Yang Ye said, “That’s it. You can’t kill her now just because she may become bad in the future!”

She glanced at Yang Ye, “The soft hearted and benevolent cannot accomplish great things!”

Yang Ye’s face stiffened. Soft hearted? Benevolent? Is she insulting me or praising me?

Yang Ye wanted to say more, but she said, “You still have more to say? Why don’t we stop speaking and just practice with the sword?”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. Does she have violent tendencies?!

Yang Ye didn’t say anything and just left with Snowy. Because based on the current circumstances, she would probably not harm the living beings within the pagoda. While she was fond of killing, it was Destiny Realm experts that she killed. It could be said that Erya and him were in the most danger.

Snowy was probably safe for now. Even though she was the Sprite Progenitor, she was still very weak. Her combat strength was really not that considerable!

Moreover, she probably wouldn’t try to kill him or Erya right now. Because even if she was injured, she had more than enough strength to kill them right now.

But Yang Ye still couldn’t rest at ease knowing she was within the Primordial Pagoda!

She was like a volcano that could erupt at any moment!

Just thinking about that made Yang Ye anxious.

Once he left the pagoda with Snowy, the woman lowered her head slightly and gazed at the black sword before her. She hadn’t taken the two swords which belonged to Yang Ye.

As far as she was concerned, it was actually herself that had given them to Yang Ye.

Even though she had a different personality than the other forms of herself, they were still her.

Everyone had a few sides to themselves. Her true main body had just split up these sides of herself, so regardless of whether it was her, the woman in white, or the other two forms of her. As far as the four of them were concerned, they were all the same person.

While they were one, there was still a difference between them.

Just like this very moment, she couldn’t figure out why the woman in white had given Past Life to Yang Ye.

Of course, that sword had played a huge role in the reason why she hadn’t killed Yang Ye.

Yang Ye didn’t know that besides being a form of acknowledgment, the woman in white had given him Past Life because it was a form of protection for him too.

Because she was very well aware that if Yang Ye encountered the woman in black or the other two forms of her, he may die before he could even say a word.

After all, he was at the Destiny Realm now, and there was Snowy and Erya, the ancient beast of evil, residing in the Primordial Pagoda!

So, that sword was actually there to keep Yang Ye safe.

Even if Yang Ye encountered her other forms, he would have a very good chance of surviving because of the sword.

Yang Ye left the wooden house and went to Erya. At this moment, Erya’s aura was as evil and strong as before.

Yang Ye walked over to her. Meanwhile, a wave of powerful and evil energy obstructed him!

Snowy blinked and was about to go over, but Yang Ye grabbed her in his arms and shook his head, “Don’t disturb her for now.”

He took Snowy away.

After playing with Snowy for some time, Yang Ye left the pagoda.

On the bridge, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and was quite lost.

Where am I?

Suddenly, a ray of black sword energy flashed past his right.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Obviously, the woman in black was giving him directions.

Yang Ye puckered his lips and transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the distance.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Snowy was ceaselessly releasing spirit energy before the spot where Qi Bitian’s bamboo house had been

While she’d left, the Worldborn Tree and Chaotic Fruit Tree were still here.

Once Snowy returned, she’d started fostering them again.

She was a true Sprite Progenitor now, so her spirit energy was many times purer than it had been. So, in just a few days, the trees had grown more than ten times taller!

Now, they were real trees, and they had only been saplings in the past!

There were around 20 fruits on each of them!

Meanwhile, the sprites surrounded Snowy and the trees.

Snowy blinked and waved her paw. A few fruits fell off the trees and floated to them. Moreover, Snowy released some of her pure spirit energy to them.

Sprite Ascension!

It could be said that they would be improving rapidly while they were with Snowy!

Especially the mysterious Fire Sprite, the Destiny Realm Fire Sprite that had helped Snowy that day. Its aura was a few times stronger than before!

It wasn’t an ordinary Destiny Realm Sprite now, it was equivalent to an existence at the peak of the Destiny Realm! It was also Snowy’s number one bodyguard!

No, her number one bodyguards were Tian Xiu and Qi Bitian, then there was Erya and Yang Ye…

She was the one who had the most and greatest backing in the world!

A short while later, Snowy glanced in Erya’s direction, and then was about to leave. However, she suddenly looked to the side, and she saw a woman in a black dress walking over slowly.

Snowy blinked and no one knew what she was thinking.

The woman glanced at Snowy, and then she gazed at Erya. Her gaze turned icy cold when she saw Erya.

Meanwhile, Snowy flew over to the woman and raised a fruit in her direction.

She glanced at Snowy and didn’t refuse. She accepted it from Snowy and took a bite from it. After eating for a while, she gazed at Snowy, “I want spirit energy, pure spirit energy. The more the better.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “Consider it as me owing you a favor!”
