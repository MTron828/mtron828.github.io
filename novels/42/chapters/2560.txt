Chapter 2561

Qi Bitian really did refuse to tell him and just kept him guessing!

Yang Ye was full of curses!

Endure it!

Endure it!

Yang Ye squeezed out a smile, “Let’s get back on topic. How do I deal with a Space Domain?”

Qi Bitian glanced at Yang Ye, “You can do it by force!”

Yang Ye asked, “But what do I do if I can’t find the person?”

Actually, he didn’t fear the Space Domain, but the problem was that she refused to show herself. If that woman in a black dress refused to show herself, he would be helpless against her!

That was the crux of the issue!

The reason he’d come to Qi Bitian was to find out if she had a way to locate the woman who was hiding in her Space Domain!

Qi Bitian put the ball down and went over to sit at the steps before the bamboo house, “At your current level of strength, it’s truly difficult to locate someone like that if that person is intent on hiding.”

Yang Ye remained silent.

Was it really impossible to resolve?

Meanwhile, Qi Bitian continued, “But there is a way.”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “What is it?”

Qi Bitian replied, “I don’t want to tell you!”

At this moment, Yang Ye felt like he was on the verge of madness!

After all, she was just constantly refusing to tell him anything!

He really was no match for her. Otherwise, he would definitely beat her up!

At this moment, he felt that Erya was so cute!

Yang Ye calmed himself. He knew he could use force against her. If he did, she would flare up, and once that happened, no one could stop her.

Flatter her!

Yang Ye walked over to Qi Bitian and smiled, “How about we play together once Erya and the others return? Erya is very fond of kicking balls around too! I can even get a few more others to join! It’ll definitely be fun!”

Qi Bitian thought for a moment and said, “That does sound pretty good.”

Yang Ye hurriedly said, “Of course, we’ll split ourselves into two groups and see who wins. Alright?”

She glanced at him and said, “It’s a pretty good idea.”

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something and sighed softly while sitting at the side.

Qi Bitian asked, “What’s wrong?”

Yang Ye sighed softly, “Sigh, I have so many things to do outside. A mysterious expert has been really troubling lately. I-I’m afraid I won’t have time to play!”

Qi Bitian frowned slightly, “That person with the Space Domain?”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Yes, I’m so helpless against her.”

“You’re such a fool!” Meanwhile, Qi Bitian spoke abruptly, “Don’t you know how to lock down that expanse of space?”

“Lock it down?” Yang Ye gazed at her, “What do you mean?”

Qi Bitian spoke indifferently, “I mean you should lock down this expanse of space. That person with the Space Domain can only temporarily escape the Three Dimensional Universe. In other words, she has to return to this space, and when she does that, there will be changes in the space here. Perhaps others may not be able to discover those changes, but you possess the Sword Domain, so you can. She will be where the changes occur.”

Qi Bitian suddenly stood up at this moment, “Besides that, you can analyze the expanse of space she was last seen at. How? Use your Sword Domain. You may not be able to affect her, but you can destroy the space she was in. Once the space there is destroyed, you can use the fragments of space there to detect her aura. Understand?”

Yang Ye gazed at Qi Bitian for quite some time, and then he nodded, “I understand, I do!”

Qi Bitian nodded slightly, and then she walked away. But right when she was about to enter the bamboo house, she suddenly said, “Don’t forget your promise!”

She entered the bamboo house!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye hurried out of the Primordial Pagoda!

The Ancient Sword Sect.

A few more disciples had been killed while Yang Ye had been in the Primordial Pagoda!

Just like before, their head and headless bodies were at the foot of the mountain.

Needless to say, news of this had spread throughout the sect. The disciples of the sect weren’t afraid of going head-on against the experts of the Soul Sect, but the unknown was the most terrifying. Because they couldn’t even see their enemy!

Panic had started to arise in the Ancient Sword Sect!

Once Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda, he immediately used the Myriad World Diagram to envelop the ancient sect, and then he covered the sect with his Sword Domain!

Spatial fluctuations!

Just as Qi Bitian had told him, he was trying to look for spatial fluctuations. So long as there was a slight fluctuation in space throughout the sect, he would sense it clearly!

Just like that, time passed by. Two hours later, Yang Ye grinned, and then he vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye appeared out of thin air at the abode of a disciple. Meanwhile, a shrill cry resounded within the courtyard.

Yang Ye waved his right hand. The door swung open, and the disciple within had his head separated from his body!

But the room was empty beyond the corpse!

A ferocious grin curled up on Yang Ye’s face, and then he stomped his right foot down.

Bang!

The space he resided at instantly exploded apart and transformed into a black hole, and then he vanished on the spot.

A ray of light flashed through the black hole.

Bang!

Something seemed to be torn open in that black hole, and then a figure appeared there!

It was the woman in a black dress from the Soul Sect!

She stared at Yang Ye, “How did you locate me?!”

Yang Ye scanned her and said, “I was right. It is you.”

She laughed coldly, “So what if you have discovered my presence?”

As soon as she finished speaking, her figure gradually turned ethereal.

“You think you can escape?” Yang Ye laughed coldly, and then a wave of powerful energy enveloped the surroundings. It was the Sword Domain!

An instant later, rays of sword energy crisscrossed!

These rays of sword energy just attacked everything in the area to destroy everything here, including the dark matter and space!

Because while the woman could use her Space Domain to escape Three Dimensional Space, she didn’t have the ability to enter Four Dimensional Space. In other words, she would have to return to Three Dimensional Space. Yet now, his random attacks had just one objective, and it was to destroy everything in the area!

Sure enough, Yang Ye’s crazy wave of destruction forced her to counterattack, and a mysterious ray of black light appeared abruptly.

Bam!

An explosion resounded and Yang Ye was blasted backward. It didn’t take long for the space before him to surge, and then it rippled toward him in waves.

At the same time, Yang Ye sensed a strand of pressure!

It was a powerful wave of pressure coming from the surrounding space!

Obviously, this space wasn’t the Three Dimensional Space, or to be more precise, it wasn’t entirely Three Dimensional Space. There was some other type of space here.

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Suppression!

At this moment, he was using the Sword Domain to suppress the space with everything he had. As he suppressed it, the space here gradually calmed down, but the energy still remained!

Two types of Domains were clashing!

The woman was hidden while Yang Ye was out in the open.

A long time passed like this before Executor suddenly left the sheath by Yang Ye’s waist and shot up into the air!

Hiss!

Sharp sounds of something being sliced open resounded.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then the dark matter and space here exploded apart. At the center of it all, Yang Ye and the woman in a black dress were both impacted by the powerful aftershock from it!

Both of them were blasted away, and they flew over 3km away!

At this moment, they were both in the sky above the sect!

They stood in confrontation from afar.

A wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of her mouth. At this moment, she wanted to flee, but it was impossible. Because besides the experts of the Ancient Sword Sect, there were four other women down below!

Nether Maiden’s group!

At this moment, all of them were looking at her.

They hadn’t received Yang Ye’s approval, so they refused to interfere in the battle between Yang Ye and the woman. But if she tried to flee, they would stop her!

Besides the Myriad World Diagram and the Sword Domain, Boundary Maiden’s barrier had locked down the surroundings too!

It was a complete lockdown just so that the woman couldn’t escape!

The Space Domain was unlike the Sword Domain. It was much more mysterious, and it was especially when it came to escape and concealment. If she hadn’t attacked again earlier, he wouldn’t have been able to locate her, even if his Sword Domain covered the entire sect!

There would be no spatial fluctuations while she remained perfectly still!

Unfortunately, she was too confident, too confident about her Space Domain. She knew Yang Ye had activated his Sword Domain to locate her, yet she’d still decided to kill someone!

In the sky above the Ancient Sword Sect, she glanced coldly at the experts down below and looked at Yang Ye. She ridiculed, “Sect Master Ye, are you going to gang up on me?”

“Gang up on you?” Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “Is that even necessary?”

She laughed coldly, “Then how about we fight one-on-one until one of us dies?”

One on one!

Yang Ye chuckled, “Alright, let’s do it. However, you won’t be leaving this sect no matter what. Your head must be used as an offering for those dead disciples!”

“You want my head?” Her cold smile gradually widened, and she pointed at her own head, “My head is right here. Come take it if you can!”
