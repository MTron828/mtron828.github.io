Chapter 2306 – Primal Saber Sect!

The villagers were stunned when they saw Yang Ye charge at them.

What’s he trying to do?

It didn’t take long for quite strange expressions to appear on their faces.

Yang Ye wanted to kill!

The villages didn’t run. Because Butcher had suddenly appeared before Yang Ye, and then he used his palm as a blade to chop lightly at Yang Ye.

A ray of saber energy flashed.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s figure was blasted away, all the way out of the village.

Wang Erya blinked, and then she vanished into the distance.

She’d fled.

As for the other spectators, they were stunned for a moment, and then they vanished as well.

Only four people remained here. Bai Zhixian, the slovenly old man, an older woman with a vegetable basket, and Butcher.

The slovenly old man raised the wine gourd on his waist, took a big gulp, and said, “Not ba.”

The woman nodded, “Not bad indeed!”

Butcher shook his head slightly, “This kid’s desire to kill is too strong, too strong!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“So what?” The old man puckered his lips, “Which cultivator doesn’t kill? Butcher, do you refrain from killing? Moreover, I don’t think he kills just for killing. If he really does that, how could his madness intent possibly suppress his slaughter intent?”

He gazed at the woman and asked, “Big Sis, what do you think?”

Butcher gazed at her too.

Bai Zhixian gazed at her with slight curiosity in her eyes. Because based on Butcher and the old man’s attitude, her status seemed to be very high.

The woman seemed very ordinary to Bai Zhixian, very, very ordinary. She wore an old linen dress with flower patterns, had a slightly chubby figure, and her appearance couldn’t be described as ugly but was absolutely not beautiful. Moreover, she didn’t have a special bearing, and she seemed like a very, very ordinary middle aged woman.

She glanced at Bai Zhixian and said, “When I said he isn’t bad, I didn’t mean his natural talent. He entered that state of madness because of her.”

Butcher was puzzled, “So?”

“Fool!” The slovenly old man shook his head, “It proves that he’s a loyal person. Simply speaking, he isn’t a bad person deep down. Otherwise, the old man would have never brought him here and even let this kid use all the wealth he possessed. When have you ever seen that old man do something that didn’t benefit him? I dare not guarantee anything else, but I’m certain there are secrets he carries that even we do not know about, and it’s a huge secret!”

Meanwhile, the woman shook her head, “Butcher, you decide what to do. But I have a suggestion.”

Butcher replied, “Please do tell!”

She said, “Instead of a sword, I think he may be more suited for the saber! If he does, his future attainments will definitely surpass you, and even surpass your Primal Saber Sect’s founding ancestor.”

“Impossible!” Butcher jumped, “Big Sis, you must be joking. He’ll surpass me? Surpass my founding ancestor?”

The slovenly old man hesitated for a moment and said, “Big Sis, if you say he’ll surpass Butcher, then I think it may not be impossible, but surpassing the founding ancestor of the Primal Saber Sect? You should know who the founding ancestor of the Primal Saber Sect was, the Primal Saber Emperor. During the Primal Era, he wasn’t a god, but he had the strength to kill gods! No other saber cultivator has ever been able to surpass him!”

The woman glanced at the old man and said, “Not in the past, but it doesn’t mean that it’s impossible now!”

The slovenly old man laughed bitterly, “Big Sis, can you tell us why you think so highly of him?”

The woman gazed at Butcher and asked, “Third Brother, do you know what you lack?”

Butcher shook his head.

She spoke solemnly, “Your talent in the Saber Dao is a few times greater than that kid, but there are two aspects in which you are inferior. Firstly, it’s ruthlessness. You aren’t hesitant and are decisive enough, but you aren’t ruthless enough. But the saber technique of your Primal Saber Sect has ruthlessness at its core. The more ruthless and overbearing you are, the more of its strength you can bring forth. However, you can’t fully bring forth any of that.”

She gazed at Yang Ye who was lying on the ground outside the village, “Haven’t you sensed it? His sword technique is ruthless and overbearing to the bone. Especially his ferocity to rather die than bend. It isn’t something that just anyone can compare to. This is why he possesses such terrifying combat strength when his natural talent is so ordinary. It is also why you’re being suppressed by him upon suppressing your cultivation. Not to mention you, even I may not be able to suppress him in the Progenitor Realm!”

Meanwhile, Bai Zhixuan suddenly said, “He’s still mad.”

The woman glanced at Bai Zhixian and nodded, “She’s right, he has one more quality, and it’s that he’s mad.” She gazed at Butcher, “When you suppressed your cultivation and fought him, what did you feel when he attacked you with a blade?”

Butcher thought for a moment and replied, “Pressure…”

He gazed at her and continued, “I understand now.”

She nodded slightly, “The sword is a weapon of slaughter, but if it’s in terms of slaughter, how can it compare to the saber? His ruthlessness and madness is absolutely good for the saber.”

Butcher hesitated for a moment and said, “But I think that he’s quite extreme, and if he cultivates my Primal Saber Sect’s technique, he’ll make it descend into the path of demons.”

The woman glanced at Butcher, “I’m certain now that he’ll definitely surpass you!”

Butcher was puzzled, “Why?”

She replied indifferently, “What’s the point of cultivating in the saber if you’re always concerned about everything?”

She turned around and left with her basket.

Once the woman vanished, Butcher gazed at the slovenly old man, and the latter shook his head, “You decide if you are going to pass it down to him. However, allow me to give you a reminder, your Primal Saber Sect has always been passed down to a single heir, so if you make the wrong decision, you may become a sinner of your sect!”

The old man turned around and left.

Butcher fell silent for a long time, and then he walked out of the village. He looked down at Yang Ye, thought for a very, very long time, and then he grabbed one of Yang Ye’s legs and dragged him into the village, “Come! You’re learning saber technique with me!”

Learning saber technique!

In a stone house.

Butcher sat on the stone bed, and Yang Ye and Bai Zhixian were in front of him.

Bai Zhixian glanced at Butcher and remained silent.

Butcher glanced at Yang Ye, and then he gazed at Bai Zhixian, “Make him kneel and take me as his master.”

“Take you as his master?” Bai Zhixian hesitated for a moment, and then he said, “Senior, he hasn’t regained consciousness, so why don’t you wait until then?”

Butcher shook his head, “That isn’t necessary. His current state is great. In any case, it’s only his mind that isn’t really clear, but he is no fool. So, ask him to kneel!”

Bai Zhixian hesitated slightly.

“You’re still hesitating?!” Meanwhile, Butcher suddenly leaped up, “Do you know how many extraordinarily monstrous geniuses dream of being my disciple? I…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye grabbed the chopper and swung it at Butcher.

Bai Zhixian was stunned.

Butcher’s face stiffened as well.

Boom!

A moment later, the stone house exploded apart, and then a figure was blasted out of the village.

It was Yang Ye, of course!

Butcher clapped his hands together, “Dammit! Have you gotten addicted to killing? You just always want to kill!”

Yang Ye suddenly leaped up, and he was above Butcher when he appeared again. A moment later, a blade chopped down at Butcher’s head.

But just a moment later, Yang Ye was blasted away again!

Bai Zhixian’s eyes lit up from the sight of this. This time, she was certain that Butcher’s strength was definitely above the True World Realm and could even be higher!

Yang Ye was about to attack again, but Bai Zhixian hurriedly went over to him and took his hand. Yang Ye immediately calmed down once she took his hand.

Bai Zhixian gazed at Butcher and said, “Senior, can you wait until he regains consciousness to complete the formalities to become your disciple?”

Butcher glanced at her and replied angrily, “Fine! Fine! Just taking a disciple is so aggrieving! All those years ago, they knelt for 10 days and 10 nights outside just to make me accept them as their disciples!”

He suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye and flicked a ray of white light into Yang Ye’s forehead.

In just a moment, countless pieces of information surged into Yang Ye’s mind.

Butcher said, “Kid, this is the Primal Saber Scroll. It’s the core technique of my Primal Saber Sect, and it’s divided into three levels. If you enter the 1st level, you’ll generate Profound Primal Energy. It’s a type of profound energy that our founding ancestor created. While it isn’t in the top 10 energies, it’s unique, and it can bring the strength of saber techniques to their limit! If you’re able to cultivate it to the 3rd level, its strength won’t be any weaker to one of the 10 top energies. Of course, the top three are excluded from that.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “As for the saber technique itself. Our Primal Saber Sect’s technique isn’t that complicated. Just swing as you like, and there are only two moves. However, while they are few, their strength is absolutely heaven defying. I’ve placed both those techniques into your mind as well. They are the Life Isolation and Revival Cuts techniques. You can train in them yourself. Besides that, they require Profound Primal Energy to bring their strength to their limits! Cultivate them yourself for now. I’m going to the rear mountain to get some things to help with your training. Dammit! I feel so aggrieved right now! This damn disciple of mine!”

He turned around and vanished into the distance.

Bai Zhixian pulled Yang Ye to the side and said, “Cultivate, alright?”

Yang Ye gazed at her with a slightly bewildered gaze.

She started gesturing for a while and said, “Cultivate, cultivate…”

A long time later, Yang Ye nodded lightly.

Bai Zhixian heaved a sigh of relief. Luckily, while Yang Ye’s mind had been corrupted by the madness intent, he still had his instinct, like the instinct to fight and cultivate!

Just like that, Yang Ye started meditating and cultivating the Primal Saber Scroll. Bai Zhixian, on the other hand, started on her own cultivation once she confirmed that Yang Ye was cultivating.

Just like that, day after day passed…

One day, Yang Ye suddenly walked out of the room with the chopper in hand. All along the way, the villagers tried to avoid offending him as they knew he wasn’t in a normal state of mind right now, and they even avoided him.

They knew he was a madman!

Yang Ye arrived at the entrance of the village, and the slovenly old man was snoring on the wooden bench.

Yang Ye suddenly gazed at the old man, and then a chopper appeared in his grasp. He held it with both hands while his madness intent surged incessantly into it. After that, he placed it against the old man’s head.

Meanwhile, the old man suddenly opened his eyes, “What are you doing?!”
