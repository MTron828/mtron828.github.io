Chapter 1965 – The See Dao Realm!

“I’m a little disappointed!” Qin Chuan spoke abruptly.

When Yang Ye left, they hadn’t expected that he would come to Devil Cave on his own and assassinate the devil men, and when they found out what had happened here, A’Man immediately gathered everyone and rushed over!

Sky Residence City shared both joy and suffering!

Yang Ye shook his head, “I caused this problem, so I…”

“I’ll deal with you once we get back!” A’Man suddenly interrupted Yang Ye, and then she gazed at Black Devil, “Black Devil, since you don’t want to let the matter rest, then let’s put an end to this today!”

As soon as she finished speaking, A’Man was about to attack.

“I don’t want to let the matter rest?” Black Devil spoke ferociously, “A’Man, it’s your people who came to kill my people! But you say that I don’t want to let the matter rest?”

A’Man replied angrily, “Would he have come here if you didn’t kill our people first?”

“I killed your people?” Black Devil frowned, and then he looked behind. The others behind him shook their heads slightly.

Black Devil looked up at A’Man, they exchanged glances, and a solemn expression appeared in their eyes.

“Everyone retreat immediately!” A’Man’s voice resounded abruptly.

“Retreat? It’s a little too late!” Suddenly, a voice resounded from afar, and then a huge black wolf walked over slowly through the sky.

The black wolf was huge. Its fur was standing on end like needles, and they flickered with a ghastly cold and dark glow. There was a bald man seated on the black wolf, and he held a black spear in his grasp.

The Dire Wolves!

A’Man glanced at the surroundings. A group of people on black wolves had suddenly appeared around them, and there were over 100 of them. They’d completely surrounded the experts from Devil Cave and Sky Residence City.

At this moment, Black Devil and A’Man had figured out everything.

It was the Dire Wolves who’d caused the conflict. As for the reason, it was very simple. The Dire Wolves wanted Sky Residence City and Devil Cave to kill each other, and then take advantage of the situation!

A’Man looked up at the bald man, “I presume you’re the Dire Wolf?”

The bald man grinned, “Indeed!”

A’Man spoke indifferently, “Are you that confident the Dire Wolves can fight two against one?”

Black Devil suddenly said, “He wouldn’t have used such tricks if he was!”

Dire Wolf chuckled and said, “A’Man, Black Devil, how many years have we been fighting each other in this damnable place? I think it’s time to put an end to it. Otherwise, there are too few resources in this tiny place, and it isn’t enough for all of us.”

A'Man said, “Why don’t you give it a try?”

Black Devil slowly clenched his fists.

Even though there was irreconcilable enmity between Devil Cave and Sky Residence City, Black Devil was clearly aware of what was the right choice at this moment.

“Haha!” Dire Wolf suddenly started roaring with laughter, and then a terrifying aura swept out from within him.

In an instant, everyone sensed an unprecedented wave of pressure!

Everyone’s expressions changed!

A See Dao Realm expert!

At this moment, A’Man and Black Devil’s expressions were extremely unsightly. They were only at the Know Dao Realm, but Dire Wolf was actually at the See Dao Realm!

He was a stage higher than them!

However, they were very well aware that this tiny little stage represented a qualitative transformation.

Dire Wolf glanced at Black Devil and A’Man, and then he smiled, “Both of you are geniuses amongst geniuses, and you possess the ability to surmount your realms of cultivation to battle those at realms above you. Especially you, A’Man! You once killed a See Dao Realm expert. Come, try me! Let’s see if you can surmount your realms of cultivation against me!”

Surmount their realms of cultivation to fight him!

Everyone here was a genius amongst geniuses, so surmounting their realms of cultivation in battle was absolutely normal for them.

However, it depended on the target!

After all, Dire Wolf could surmount his realm of cultivation as well when he was at the Know Dao Realm!

A’Man and Black Devil exchanged glances, and then they vanished on the spot.

A smile curled up on the corners of Dire Wolf’s mouth, and then he stretched out his right hand and pressed it down.

It was like the sky was collapsing before him!

Boom!

A wave of powerful energy instantly blasted A’Man and Black Devil over 10km away. As for the others here, they were affected as well, and they were pushed backwards repeatedly.

A See Dao Realm expert!

Dire Wolf took a deep breath and said, “The See Dao Realm represents seeing the quintessence of all things, the heart of the world, and the true appearance of everything! A’Man, Black Devil, both of you aren’t weak, so I’ll give you a chance. Submit to me and avoid death!”

“Submit?” A’Man laughed coldly, “That word doesn’t exist in my world!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she leaped up and arrived amidst the clouds. After that, a huge spiked club appeared in her grasp, and she grabbed it with both hands before slamming it down at Dire Wolf!

“Earthshatter!” A’Man’s voice resounded, and then a stream of powerful energy converged below Dire Wolf’s feet.

Boom!

The ground where he stood collapsed, and a wave of powerful energy swept up and slammed itself at Dire Wolf.

Dire Wolf’s expression remained calm. He raised his right hand slightly, and then he pressed it down.

Boom!

As soon as their attacks came into contact, they exploded apart. Dire Wolf was blasted over 300m away by the force of the collision, and as soon as he stopped himself, the ground where he stood collapsed once more. An instant later, another wave of energy shot up from the ground and swept towards him.

Dire Wolf’s eyes narrowed slightly as he sat on the black wolf, and his eyes flickered with ghastly coldness. After that, he twisted his right hand slightly, leaped up, and then slapped his palm down.

Rumble!

The ground below collapsed incessantly.

A huge abyss appeared before everyone.

“Skyshatter!” Suddenly, A’Man’s voice resounded from the clouds, and then a huge spiked club shot down like a bolt of lightning in Dire Wolf’s direction!

As soon as it descended, the space in a huge area started to tremble, and it seemed like space couldn’t endure the force within it.

It was extremely shocking!

For the very first time, Dire Wolf—who was a See Dao Realm expert now—revealed a solemn expression.

He didn’t underestimate her attack or act carelessly!

He flipped his palm, and a black spear appeared in his grasp. After that, he stomped his right foot against the back of the black wolf, and the latter howled furiously into the sky before slapping its paws against the ground and shooting up into the air with Dire Wolf on its back.

“Break!” Dire Wolf stabbed his spear forward.

Bang!

A deafening explosion resounded through the sky, and the entire sky shook violently while a terrifying wave of energy suddenly erupted. It swept out swiftly and instantly shot over 10km into the distance.

As for the towering mountains in the surroundings, they were instantly destroyed and obliterated.

Around 10 breaths of time later, the surroundings calmed down.

A’Man and Dire Wolf were in the sky.

Dire Wolf grinned, “As expected of the extraordinary genius from the barbarian race, you truly are extremely formidable. If you were at the See Dao Realm, I wouldn’t have the slightest confidence in being able to defeat you. Yet now, even both of you together are no match for me!”

He glanced at Black Devil and continued, “Black Devil, A’Man, I appreciate geniuses. If you’re willing to lead your people and join me, then you can avoid death. Besides that, if the three of us join forces, then we can get through Hell Forest and experience the world beyond it!”

Submit to him?

Black Devil fell silent. He was very well aware of what that represented.

Meanwhile, Dire Wolf added, “My patience is limited!”

Suddenly, A’Man gazed at Yang Ye, “From this moment onward, you’re the leader of Sky Residence City. Lead everyone back to the city.”

All of them were stunned!

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he asked, “What do you mean?”

A’Man looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Didn’t you hear me? Take them and return to the city right now.”

Yang Ye glanced at Dire Wolf whose gaze had turned icy cold, and then he gazed at A’Man, “Why me?”

The others behind Yang Ye gazed at Yang Ye too, and their eyes were filled with curiosity.

Yang Ye was new to Sky Residence City, but that wasn’t even the main point. The main point was that he wasn’t the strongest expert besides A’Man. There was Mad Saber, Ling, and many others… In short, logically speaking, Yang Ye should never have a chance to become the leader of Sky Residence City.

A’Man shook her head slightly, “While Ling and Mad Saber are the strongest, they’re cold and proud. If they become the leader, they won’t just be unable to lead all of you well, they’ll spoil your mental states. As for Yang Ye, he can fight and act shamelessly. If he leads Sky Residence City, all of you will at least be able to avoid falling into a disadvantaged position. Of course, if he can’t convince all of you of his strength in the future, all of you can choose your own leader later on!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Meanwhile, Dire Wolf spoke abruptly, “Looks like Sky Residence City is going to vanish from the Dead Dimension today!”

Dire Wolf waved his right hand, and the other members of the Dire Wolves surrounded A’Man and the others from Sky Residence City.

Suddenly, A’Man released the spiked club she held, and then she pulled apart the space before her.

Hiss!

The space in front of her was torn open, and the rift there was growing in size. In an instant, the space around them had been torn open. At this moment, all of them were within the spatial rift.

“Don’t leave the city until you attain the See Dao Realm!” As soon as she finished speaking, she pressed her palms together.

Swoosh!

Yang Ye and the others instantly vanished on the spot, and they were extremely far away when they appeared once more.

Dire Wolf spoke indifferently, “A’Man, is sacrificing your life really worth it for some people you met by chance?”

“I met by chance?” A’Man chuckled, “They call me Big Sis and leader!”

Dire Wolf replied indifferently, “So what?”

“Do you know what leaders are for?” A’Man looked Dire Wolf in the eyes, “They are used to guard the rear!”

As soon as she finished speaking, her aura started rising madly.
