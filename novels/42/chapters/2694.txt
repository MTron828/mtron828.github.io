Chapter 2695 – A Trap!

Yang Ye laid there on the ground while Snowy was on his stomach, and she was snoring while lying there.

Not too far from them was Tu.

Tu rested herself against the corner of a wall and was silently drinking her wine.

An ethereal sword floated to her right.

Heaven Executor!

It wasn’t the real Heaven Executor but an ethereal sword condensed from the sword energy in this world.

The true Heaven Executor was in the ground to her left.

After the sword energy here took the form of Heaven Executor, it just floated before Tu.

Obviously, it was waiting for something.

A long, long time passed before Tu glanced at the ethereal sword, and she said, “You have your own consciousness, so you can leave at any time.”

The sword energy trembled and moved closer to Tu.

Tu shook her head, “I don’t need a sword anymore.”

She glanced at the sword to her left and said, “I left this sword behind because I’d hoped it would choose someone…”

She didn’t continue at this point.

The sword had chosen some people, but they weren’t really satisfactory to her.

However, she hadn’t interfered.

Now, the sword had chosen Yang Ye.

Tu glanced at Yang Ye’s figure on the ground and laughed coldly, “He has quite a temper, he even said he’s vengeful?”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye slowly got up to his feet.

He didn’t feel exhausted. Conversely, he felt quite good!

It was like he’d had a massage!

That was how Yang Ye felt right now!

It was quite the strange feeling!

Yang Ye didn’t think too much about it for now and took Snowy’s drunk figure in his arms before looking at Tu, “You’re the owner of Heaven Progenitor!”

She replied indifferently, “You’re not that stupid!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Why don’t you look the same as them?”

She replied with a question, “Why should I?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and fell silent.

Meanwhile, she gazed at the sword energy, and then she stretched out her hand. The sword condensed from sword energy instantly appeared in her grasp. She scanned it and said, “If you cultivate on your own, it’s impossible for you to attain the Dao and gain true intelligence in a few hundred years. Heaven Progenitor’s own sword sprite isn’t whole, so are you willing to merge with it and become Heaven Progenitor’s true sword sprite? If you’re unwilling, you can leave whenever you want.”

The sword energy fell silent.

Merge!

It has its own consciousness now, and it was willing to go with Tu, but if it was merging with Heaven Executor… Obviously, it wasn’t very willing!

Meanwhile, Tu shook her head slightly, “You were always a part of it, so why reject it? If you merge with it, your consciousness will remain, and it’ll be like recalling your past.”

The sword energy fell silent for a moment, and then it entered the sword.

A sword howl instantly resounded through the sky.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Tu gazed at Yang Ye, “3rd and 4th both chose you. If I’m being honest, I’m very surprised because 4th can’t stand some of 3rd’s actions.”

Yang Ye responded with silence.

He didn’t want to waste his breath on her nonsense!

Tu laughed coldly, “You’re so petty, huh?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’ll be leaving if you don’t need anything else.”

Yang Ye walked off with Snowy.

“You don’t want Heaven Executor?” Tu’s voice came from behind him.

Yang Ye stopped and shook his head, “I don’t.”

Tu asked, “Because I’ve been beating you up?”

Yang Ye shook his head again, “I don’t want a sword that attacks its master!”

As he spoke, he pointed at the Heaven Executor sword in Tu’s grasp, “It’s a sword that is devoid of principles. As far as I’m concerned, it’s trash. Of course, that’s just my opinion.”

Tu looked Yang Ye in the eyes, and the latter looked right back at her.

Heaven Executor trembled violently while a strand of ghastly killing intent emerged from it.

Obviously, it felt Yang Ye was insulting it!

Suddenly, Heaven Executor shot forward.

Actually, if it was Heaven Executor in its previous state, it wouldn’t dare to attack Yang Ye. Especially without Tu’s instruction. But at this moment, it wasn’t the same sword anymore!

There was a huge difference in it when compared with before!

So, it attacked upon hearing Yang Ye.

It was one of the greatest swords in the universe, so it had quite the temper!

Suddenly, a paw grabbed it!

It was Snowy!

Snowy had regained consciousness, but she was still quite dizzy, and her face was still red.

Snowy gazed at Heaven Executor which intended to harm Yang Ye, and there was rage in her eyes.

Snowy held it tight, and then strands of mysterious energy surged into the sword.

Sprite Devouring!

At this moment, Heaven Executor was afraid.

Its consciousness had just been formed, yet Snowy wanted to destroy it. How could it not be afraid?

It immediately returned to Tu.

Snowy blinked and gazed at Tu. The latter glanced at Yang Ye and Snowy, “That’s fine too.”

She turned around and walked away, but she stopped a moment later, “The strongest among us, 1st, may come to see you. Prepare yourself mentally.”

Yang Ye was quite puzzled, “Why?”

Tu replied indifferently, “Weren’t you really amazing? Figure it out yourself! And you haven’t even figured out the sword, yet you plan to learn more? You must be an idiot!”

She vanished into the sky.

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Once Tu left, the ethereal man from the Martial Sky Clan appeared before Yang Ye.

The man asked, “Was that her?”

Yang Ye nodded.

He spoke softly, “She isn’t bothered by my clan’s current state.”

Yang Ye shook his head and didn’t say anything.

Actually, he couldn’t say anything. Because he wasn’t a good person either, and he’d done things like destroying an entire world too.

The man spoke softly, “My ancestor was wrong, but my entire clan suffered from our ancestor’s decision. They did nothing wrong, and it’s all because they are weak. They are in the wrong because they are weak. That is the law of the Three Dimensional Universe.”

Yang Ye glanced at the man and spoke softly, “Live well through the future.”

Revenge?

That was absolutely unrealistic, and it was impossible.

The man smiled, “Of course.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “There seems to be some sort of link between you and them?”

Yang Ye nodded, “There is.”

The man suddenly said, “They chose you!”

Yang Ye didn’t hide it and nodded slightly, “Another two of her forms did, but not her.”

The man smiled, “You’re a truly assertive person. That sword she gave you was Heaven Executor, and it’s even after it absorbed countless strands of powerful sword energy. But you refused it. You’re truly strong-willed and assertive!”

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled.

It was a good sword, of course!

However, if it would turn on its master, then even if it was the greatest sword in the world, Yang Ye would still refuse it.

Meanwhile, the man said, “You want the Martial Sky Invulnerable Body?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The man fell silent for a long time and said, “Have you ever considered that as you grow stronger in other aspects, your Sword Dao may weaken?”

Yang Ye gazed at the man, and the man continued, “No one can truly be perfect. You cultivate in the sword, so why not focus on it? As for your body, it’s as she’d said. If you can’t even fully master the sword, isn’t it a waste of time to cultivate in the body?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

The man smiled, “Allow me to be honest. It’s impossible for you to truly cultivate the essence of the Martial Sky Invulnerable Body.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

The man smiled, “The Martial Sky Invulnerable Body is something my ancestors cultivated from a young age, and countless secret techniques combined with the guidance and fostering of numerous experts of my clan were required. Even then, it took countless years for invulnerability to truly be formed. Of course, it was very formidable. My ancestor could resist Destiny’s sword with just his body, but so what? They were still defeated.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Of course, I can give it to you if you still want it.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Meanwhile, he recalled what Tu had told him.

So, Yang Ye shook his head, ‘That isn’t necessary.”

The sword!

He just wanted to focus on the sword right now!

Yang Ye summoned Snowy, rubbed her head, and grinned, “Help them!”

Snowy cracked a smile and withdrew the Sprite Staff. A moment later, she waved the staff, and countless strands of spirit energy appeared throughout the tower.

Yang Ye gazed at the man, “The sword energy is gone, and she won’t act against your clan again. However, I suggest that you remain in seclusion. The world is in chaos now, so don’t get yourself swept into it. Your clan really can’t afford to!”

The man nodded, “I understand.”

Yang Ye nodded and was about to leave when the man withdrew something.

A sword chest!

A dark green sword chest!

The man spoke softly, “This is the Five Element Sword’s chest, and there’s a five element formation within it. You can consider it as a small world. If it's combined with those five swords, its strength multiplies, and it should grow even stronger in your hands.”

Yang Ye gazed at the sword chest for a long time, and then he suddenly shook his head and smiled, “To be honest, I’ve helped some people in the past, but at most times, the outcome isn’t very good.”

The man grinned, “That may be because your strength wasn’t that strong. If your strength is so strong that they can’t do anything to you, they will only be extremely grateful for your help; but if you’re weak or on par with them, they may have other thoughts.”

Yang Ye glanced at the man and smiled, “I understand.”

The man continued, “Even though my clan has suffered decline, we aren’t that weak. Let us know if you need anything.”

Yang Ye smiled and left without saying a word.

Once Yang Ye left, the man fell silent for a long time and said, “Grand Exalt.”

A moment of silence ensued, and then a voice resounded, “I understand. Our clan must naturally repay this kindness, and it’s also an opportunity for us. I’ll get going then, and I’ll help him if he needs it!”

The ethereal man nodded slightly, “If a new order is formed, our clan naturally can’t miss this opportunity!”

…

As soon as Yang Ye left the Martial Sky World, he encountered a middle aged man.

There was a very deep sword injury that stretched through half the man’s face.

He pointed at his face and said, “She left this, the owner of Heaven Executor!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Then go look for her. If you can, help me beat her up too. I can’t stand the sight of her either.”

The man shook his head slightly, “I’m no match for her. So, I’m here for you. Because she told the world that you’re her successor.”

Yang Ye’s face instantly became unsightly.

Tu! Fuck you! You’re pushing me into a trap!
