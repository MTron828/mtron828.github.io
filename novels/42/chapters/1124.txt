Chapter 1125 – Does He Look Like This?

Zi Nan suddenly obstructed Yang Ye’s path when he was about to walk out of the door.

Zi Nan looked straight in his eyes and said, “I know you’re very strong, and I know that you’ve killed Quasi Emperors. However, you have to understand that we aren’t as strong as you. Not to mention a Quasi Emperor, just a few high-rank Saints would be sufficient to render us helpless. It’s related to the fate of everyone here! It’s no trifling matter!”

All of them gazed at Yang Ye. Since he’d been able to arrive here, it proved how strong he was. However, it was just as Zi Nan had said, they didn’t possess similar strength as Yang Ye. So, the slightest mishap might cause their annihilation.

Yang Ye gazed at Zi Nan and said, “Your worries are warranted. But what else can we do now but fight our way out? Continue hiding here? Instead of hiding here, why don’t we just fight our way out? Even if we die, we’ll be able to bring a few down with us, right?”

He had a Quasi Emperor Sword Servant and 100 Sword Servants at the high-rank of the Saint Realm. However, he hadn’t revealed them to gain the confidence of the students here. After all, one’s potential would only be brought out in a hopeless situation.

If all of them were prepared to die, then he was confident that their combat strength would definitely rise by quite a bit.

Zi Nan took a deep breath and said, “Are you really the only one who has come to get us?”

Yang Ye replied with a question, “Do you think the academy has anyone else to send?”

Zi Nan gazed at him for quite some time, and then she turned around to gaze at the others, “Do all of you want to continue staying here or kill your way out? I won’t force you if you intend to stay.”

“Stay here and do what? Wait for death to arrive?” Meanwhile, Qiu Yuan gazed at Yang Ye, “Even if we can’t return safely to the academy by going with him, we’ll be able to drag a few down with us at the very least. If we stay here, then not to mention killing them once they come for us, we will probably not even have the ability to fight back. So, I’m going with him!”

“Let’s kill our way out!”

“Right! Instead of waiting for death to come, why don’t we kill our way out? Even if we die, we can take a few down with us. Otherwise, our lives would have been lost for nothing!”

“Come on! Let’s kill our way out of here!”

All of them made their stands clear. Yang Ye glanced at them and noticed that none had chosen to stay behind.

Everyone here was no fool, and they might have a chance to survive if they killed their way out of here. After all, even though they hadn’t witnessed Yang Ye’s strength, they’d heard of it. He could kill Quasi Emperors, so how could he possibly be weak? Besides waiting for death, living in terror, and holding onto a last wishful dream, it was pointless to stay here.

Yang Ye nodded, and then he flicked 3 violet crystals to each of them, “I know that many of you are injured, but I don’t have the time to wait for all of you to recover. Because many others are waiting for me to save them. Consume one of those violet crystals now to recover your profound energy. Remember that you can only rely on yourselves for your own survival. So, please fight with everything you have if we encounter enemies later!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around and left while the others hurriedly followed him.

After he left Sky Capital City, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “There are over 200 students in the depths of a mountain that’s over 10,000km away from here. That’s our destination. However, we can’t fly. Because we’ll be huge targets once we fly, and it’s easy to be discovered. So, we have no choice but to travel on foot. Come with me, I’ll conceal all of your auras.”

All of them quickly nodded.

Yang Ye was about to set out once he finished speaking. However, a few dozen rays of light shot over from afar, and it caused the expressions of everyone here to change violently.

Because all of those figures were Saints at the very least!

Yang Ye gazed at those rays of light and spoke indifferently, “There’s no need to conceal yourself anymore. Just travel as fast as you can and rendezvous with the other students. I’ll be there in a moment!”

Actually, even if he’d concealed their auras, it wasn’t very useful in the city. After all, they couldn’t have both their auras and figures concealed like he could.

Zi Nan said, “I’ll stay behind with you!”

Yang Ye turned around and gazed at her, “Obey my orders from this moment onward. Everyone rendezvous with them swiftly right now.”

It wasn’t that they were of no help to him if they stayed, but he really didn’t need their help. The important matter at hand was to let them converge with the other students and take all of them back.

Zi Nan glanced at him and said, “Be careful!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Zi Nan led them swiftly towards the distant sky.

“All of you are trying to flee? Don’t even think about it. We finally found a few fugitives! Hahaha!” Roaring laughter resounded from the sky, but it didn’t take long for it to stop abruptly when a ray of light flashed through the sky. After that, a figure crashed down from midair.

“You....” The others were astounded. Meanwhile, a ray of light shot up into the sky, and then a few more crisscrossed through the area before numerous shrill cries resounded.

In less than 3 breaths of time, 5 figures had crashed down from midair.

“Stop!” Suddenly, a furious howl resounded from within the city, and then a middle aged man in a luxurious robe appeared here. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

It was a high-rank Saint!

Moreover, there were 5 mid-rank Saints behind the middle aged man.

Yang Ye stopped and looked at them. The middle aged man glanced at Yang Ye and the others with a gloomy expression on his face, “I’m the City Governor of Sky Capital City, Ge Ming. Fighting is prohibited in Sky Capital City! Don’t all of you know that?”

Meanwhile, a green robed middle aged man stepped forward from the group which stood before Yang Ye, and he said, “I’m from the Mo Clan.”

Meanwhile, a middle aged woman by his side stepped forward and said, “I’m from the Thousand Crane Sect!”

Ge Ming’s expression changed when he heard them. After all, both of them were Diamond Rank power. Especially the Mo Clan, it was one of the 4 great clans of the Central Divine Prefecture!

Sky Capital City couldn’t afford to offend them, and neither could he!

Ge Ming’s expression eased up quite a bit, and then he nodded slightly to them, “So it’s friends from the Mo Clan and Thousand Crane Sect....” As he spoke, he gazed at Yang Ye and said, “If I’m not wrong, then you’re from White Deer Academy?”

The Mo Clan and Thousand Crane Sect were hunting the members of White Deer Academy, and it was common knowledge throughout the prefecture. So, he was naturally aware as well.

Yang Ye glanced at him and nodded, “Indeed!”

Ge Ming’s face became gloomy when he saw Yang Ye nod, and he questioned Yang Ye, “Why have you attacked others in my city?” He naturally chose to Mo Clan and the Thousand Crane Sect. Presently, everyone was clearly aware that White Deer Academy was finished. So, he didn’t mind giving the Mo Clan and Thousand Crane Sect some face right now.

At his age, one was clearly aware of how one should act!

At this moment, how could he give up on an opportunity to make friends with the Thousand Crane Sect and Mo Clan?

The experts from the Mo Clan and Thousand Crane Sect were first momentarily stunned when they heard him, and then they were delighted. They were no fools, so they naturally knew that Ge Ming was helping them. The green robed man immediately said, “City Governor Ge, my Mo Clan will remember this.”

The woman by his side spoke as well, “My Thousand Crane Sect will remember it as well!”

Ge Ming grinned and said, “You’re both too kind.”

As he spoke, he turned around to gaze at Yang Ye and spoke indifferently, “The rules of Sky Capital City prohibit fighting in the city. So, your actions are akin to contempt towards my city. So, will you take your own life, or should I?”

If it was in the past, he would wisely choose to not interfere. Because he couldn’t afford to offend White Deer Academy as well. Yet now, White Deer Academy had split into two, and its strength had suffered a huge decline. Moreover, the Mo Clan and Thousand Crane Sect had declared war against it. Under such circumstances, could White Deer Academy even turn the situation around?

As far as he was concerned, it was impossible!

Yang Ye chuckled, “You think the Mo Clan and Thousand Crane Sect can’t be offended, but my White Deer Academy can, so you intend to act against me and do them a favor?”

The green robed man from the Mo Clan glanced at Yang Ye and said, “City Governor Ge, his strength isn’t best. It’s best to be careful. Of course, with all of us here, it’s impossible for him to do anything. However, we still should be careful.” The collision they had earlier allowed him to realize that the man who stood before him was no easy target. After all, those Saints had practically been unable to fight back before they were killed in an instant.

Ge Ming laughed coldly, “He’s just a Half-Saint. I know a bit about the geniuses of White Deer Academy. If it was Feng Qingyi or that madman, Yang Ye, then perhaps I would be fearful. Unfortunately, Feng Qingyi has left White Deer Academy. As for Yang Ye, he’s clearly not Yang Ye!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

The green robed man from the Mo Clan was curious, “Why?”

Ge Ming glanced at Yang Ye and said, “According to rumors, Yang Ye is ruthless, cruel, and bloodthirsty. He’s like an utter madman. However, while this fellow’s strength isn’t bad, he doesn’t seem like a madman. Moreover, Yang Ye was supposedly heavily injured during the battle in Thousand Crane Sect, and fell unconscious after it. So, he should be recuperating in White Deer Dimension right now. Besides that, the reason Yang Ye’s combat strength is so formidable is because he relies on that sword of slaughter at the Emperor Rank. Moreover, he’ll become completely blood red every time he utilizes it, , and....”

“Does he look like this?” Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly interrupted Ge Ming.

All of them looked towards the source of the voice. At this moment, the green clothed man had vanished from their sights, and he was replaced by a blood red figure who held a blood red sword.

The figure’s eyes were blood red, and his entire body emanated terrifying slaughter intent, baleful energy, and a nauseating stench of blood.

“You....” Ge Ming’s eyes opened wide, and his mouth could simply fit a fist at this moment.
