Chapter 1572 - Let’s Fight To The Death! Do You Dare?

Translator: InVader

Up until this point in time, besides Jian Wuji and the Unfettered One, he hadn’t seen or heard of any other sword cultivator that was more formidable than him. Even if the Sword God’s Pavilion had sword cultivators with Returnal Rank sword intent, he still didn’t fear them. Because besides his sword, he still had his body. Most importantly, he had the Sword Domain which was capable of suppressing all sword intent!

After he left Oblivion Boundary City, Yang Ye traveled through two teleportation formations before arriving at Meteor Mountain.

Meteor Mountain was the headquarters of Sword God’s Pavilion.

A very long time ago, the area Meteor Mountain was situated at had been a flat plain. One day, a meteor fell from outer space, and the huge meteor became Meteor Mountain. Later on, after Jian Wuji arrived at the large world, he took a liking for the place and established the Sword God’s Pavilion’s headquarters there.

Once Yang Ye arrived at the foot of Meteor Mountain, a wave of sword intent assaulted his face. However, the sword intent seemed to have noticed something when it arrived 3m away from Yang Ye, and then it instantly retreated like a receding tide.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he looked up.

Meteor Mountain was huge, and it was like a huge sword that was struck blade side up in the ground. Besides that, a huge violet sword was floating in the air around 3km above the peak of the mountain. The huge sword was spinning slowly, and it ceaselessly emanated violet sword energy that shot towards Meteor Mountain.

The sword energy was very sharp and powerful. Unless it was a Rebirth Realm expert, even Dualism Realm experts would dare not approach Meteor Mountain from the sky.

Flying was prohibited!

Every single power had such a formation, and it was there because they didn’t want other experts to fly over their territory.

Yang Ye started walking towards Meteor Mountain. Suddenly, a sword howl resounded from not too far away, and then a ray of light descended before Yang Ye. The light dispersed to reveal a woman in green clothes who held a sword.

She gazed at Yang Ye, “State your name!”

Yang Ye glanced at her and replied. “Yang Ye!”

“Yang Ye!” Her expression changed, “You’re Yang Ye!”

Yang Ye!

That name was naturally not unfamiliar to her. It should be said that no one throughout Sky Sky Continent didn’t know that name! Moreover, everyone in Sword God’s Pavilion was aware that two of their precious treasures were in Yang Ye’s possession!

Yang Ye nodded, “Take me to your pavilion master.”

She sized him up and said, “Come with me!”

Yang Ye followed her towards Meteor Mountain. All along the way, Yang Ye was scanning the surroundings incessantly. He noticed that some of the sword formations here were very similar to the sword formations on Dark Hell Continent. The only difference was that the sword formations here were much stronger.

Suddenly, Yang Ye gazed at the woman. At this moment, she was sizing him up. He glanced at her and asked, “You’re very curious about me?”

She was slightly stunned by this, and then she nodded, “I’m very curious.”

Yang Ye smiled and said, “Is the Sword God’s Pavilion the number one sect for sword cultivators on the continent?”

“Of course!” She said, “Every sword cultivator on the continent takes pride in being able to join our Sword God’s Pavilion.” She glanced at Yang Ye at this point and asked, “You’re the founding ancestor’s successor, so you’ll join our Sword God’s Pavilion, right?”

Yang Ye smiled, “What do you think?”

She shook her head, “I don’t know.”

Yang Ye smiled and didn’t speak further. Join Sword God’s Pavilion? He’d never had such thoughts. Actually, even if he wanted to join, the higher-ups of the Sword God’s Pavilion wouldn’t dare to let him.

There were two reasons for that. Firstly, Yang Ye was too strong and had an extreme personality. If he were allowed to join Sword God’s Pavilion, then could anyone control him?

Secondly, Yang Ye was stuck within the eye of a storm, and his enemies were too strong. So, if he were allowed to join, he would bring the entire Sword God’s Pavilion down with him!

It didn’t take long for them to arrive at the peak of the mountain, and there was an imposing pavilion there.

Sword God’s Pavilion!

News of Yang Ye’s arrival seemed to have somehow spread throughout Sword God’s Pavilion, so countless sword cultivators came here. In just a short while, the surroundings were filled with almost 1,000 sword cultivators!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. Needless to say, Sword God’s Pavilion was very strong indeed. Because all these sword cultivators had comprehended sword intent, and the weakest amongst them possessed Void Rank sword intent while at least around ten possessed Rebirth Rank sword intent!

The sword cultivators in the surroundings were ceaselessly sizing up Yang Ye. Some were curious, some admired him, and some seemed to want to provoke him.

Presently, Yang Ye was considered the number one sword cultivator on the continent. So, defeating Yang Ye would allow them to instantly become renowned throughout the continent!

As for if they lost, it didn’t matter because it wouldn’t change anything.

It didn’t take long for a young man to suddenly walk over to Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, do you dare to fight me? We’ll compete in our attainments in the Sword Dao and not sword intent!” Everyone knew that Yang Ye possessed Quasi Returnal Rank sword intent, so he naturally intended to avoid competing with Yang Ye with sword intent and only intended to compete with Yang Ye with their attainments in the Sword Dao. To be more precise, it was a one on one battle without using sword intent.

Yang Ye took two steps forward and looked the young man in the eyes, “Let’s fight to the death! Do you dare?”

The young man’s face instantly became unsightly.

Fight Yang Ye to the death?

Did he dare?

The young man’s expression was unsightly to the extreme. He kept wanting to say something, but he stopped himself when he was about to speak.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye patted him on the shoulder, “If you want to make a name for yourself, then rely on your strength. Don’t play such tricks.”

The young man’s expression changed repeatedly. A long time passed before he cupped his fist at Yang Ye and moved aside.

Suddenly, an old man walked out from the pavilion. The old man went over to Yang Ye, sized up Yang Ye, and said, “The Pavilion Master requests your presence!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he followed the old man in.

In the hall within the pavilion.

There were five old men here. All of them were at the Rebirth Realm, and there was a middle aged man in a luxurious robe seated at the seat of the host. The middle aged man was the master of Sword God’s Pavilion, Xiao Tianyi.

Everyone in the hall was looking at Yang Ye. Presently, Yang Ye was definitely the most dazzling sword cultivator on the continent. So, they were naturally very curious about him.

Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto Xiao Tianyi, “I’m sure Sword God’s Pavilion wasn’t just looking for me to have a look at me, right?”

Xiao Tianyi spoke flatly, “Yang Ye, I’ll just be frank. The Sword God’s Seal and Stellar Sword Diagram you possess are precious treasures of my Sword God’s Pavilion! Please return them to their rightful owner!”

The Stellar Sword Diagram! The Sword God’s Seal! A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “I expected that before I came here. But I think you were mistaken to say that they belong to the Sword God’s Pavilion.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Mistaken?” Xiao Tianyi continued, “They belonged to our founding ancestor, Jian Wuji, right?”

Yang Ye smiled, “So you realize that they belonged to Senior Jian Wuji. When did Senior Jian Wuji’s possessions become property of the Sword God’s Pavilion?”

The expressions of the others here became quite unsightly when they heard Yang Ye. Obviously, Yang Ye refused to hand them over!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “I encountered a strand of Senior Jian Wuji’s soul on Dark Hell Continent. He said I possess an extraordinary bone structure and I’m a peerless genius in the Sword Dao that only appears once in a million years. So, he gave the Stellar Sword Diagram and Sword God’s Seal to me, and he said that once I arrive at the large world, I should take over of the Sword God’s Pavilion and lead Sword God’s Pavilion to the peak of this world.”

Yang Ye glanced at them and continued, “These are Senior Jian Wuji’s last words. Will all of you obey them?”

The expressions of the others here grew even more unsightly.

Let Yang Ye take control?

They were naturally unwilling to do so. Sword God’s Pavilion was a peak eight star power, so would anyone be willing to just give it away? After all, even though Jian Wuji had established it all those years ago, they were the ones who truly expanded and built it up. Of course, Jian Wuji would still be the pavilion master if he was alive. Because regardless of whether it was in terms of influence or strength, Jian Wuji was unmatched!

As for Yang Ye, to be a little frank, the Sword God’s Pavilion had nothing to do with Yang Ye!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Why are all of you so quiet? Oh… I understand. All of you refuse to obey Senior Jian Wuji’s last words!”

Xiao Tian spoke indifferently, “Yang Ye, do you think that you can be a good pavilion master?”

Yang Ye replied, “I can’t, but all of you can help me! If we join forces, we’ll just kill anyone who refuses to accept it. Trust me, it won’t take long for us to reign supreme over Sky Sky Continent while I lead Sword God’s Pavilion.”

The others’ eyelids twitched. Is he an idiot?

Suddenly, Xiao Tianyi said, “Yang Ye, you’re a smart person, so don’t try to act like you’re stupid. I’ll just be frank. My Sword God’s Pavilion doesn’t want to become enemies with you, we really don’t. After all, you can be considered to be the founding ancestor’s successor, but the Sword God’s Seal and Stellar Sword Diagram are extremely important to my Sword God’s Pavilion. So, please return them. My Sword God’s Pavilion will be extremely grateful for that!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “It wasn’t Sword God’s Pavilion that gave me the Sword God’s Seal and Stellar Sword Diagram, so I won’t return it to you. Of course, I have no intention to become enemies with you as well. After all, Sword God’s Pavilion was established by Senior Jian Wuji, and I presume he would definitely not want any conflict to arise between us.”

Yang Ye would absolutely not hand them over. They were of the utmost importance to him. If he lost them, then he wouldn’t just be incapable of deterring other eight star powers, he wouldn’t be able to execute the Sword of Rebirth. It could be said that losing them would cause his strength to suffer a huge decline.

Some would say he was relying on external sources of strength. Actually, that was true. There was a gap between him and those old Rebirth Realm experts, and he had no choice but to use treasures to make up for it.

Meanwhile, one of the old men spoke, “What if we insist?”

As soon as he finished speaking, the atmosphere here became heavy.

Yang Ye chuckled and looked the old man in the eyes, “Why don’t you give it a try?”

The heavy atmosphere became tense.
