Chapter 2301 – Primal Demon!

Eternal Secret Realm!

The Eternal Secret Realm was also called an independent world.

It was a mysterious and dangerous world. Of course, it was filled with fortune too.

Eternal Border had three secret realms, the Eternal Secret Realm, Sword Ruins, and Eternal River. Eternal River was the most dangerous amongst them, and it was the most terrifying too. Countless geniuses of Eternal Border had been buried within the Eternal River. As far as the people of Eternal Border were concerned, it was no secret realm, it was a forbidden area that should absolutely not be entered.

Eternal Secret Realm wasn’t as terrifying as Eternal River. However, it was extremely mysterious. Because the stronger someone was, the easier it was for that person to die.

Bai Zhixian had obviously been here in the past. She led Yang Ye to a mountain range, and there was a striking mountain that towered into the sky.

They arrived at the foot of the towering mountain, and then she walked over to the mountain wall and waved her hand gently. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Bang!

The mountain wall exploded apart, and there was another world within it.

Bai Zhixian led Yang Ye into the cave. The walls of the cave were covered in strange rocks of various types, and these rocks emanated gently light that seemed like moonlight.

Bai Zhixian led Yang Ye forward, but it didn’t take long for her to stop.

There was a statue of a woman standing not too far ahead of them.

She wore a long dress, had a gorgeous appearance, and there was a purple belt floating around her waist.

Bai Zhixian walked over to it and bowed slightly. Meanwhile, the statue spoke abruptly, “You’re here.”

She nodded, “Senior, I have a request!”

The statue replied, “What is it?”

Bai Zhixian gazed at Yang Ye, “Senior, can you help him return to normal?”

Return to normal!

Make Yang Ye return to normal!

Actually, even she didn’t know why she was doing this. Because if Yang Ye recovered, then based on how he did things, it was very likely for him to kill her, and she couldn’t resist his current strength.

But she’d done this.

The statue gazed at Yang Ye, and it didn’t take long for it to frown, “This intent… Huh? The Sword Domain, slaughter intent, and the sword intent. Interesting!”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly looked up at the statue, and then a black sword appeared in his grasp.

Bai Zhixian’s expression changed slightly, and then she hurriedly grabbed Yang Ye’s hand.

The statue suddenly said, “I can’t do it!”

Bai Zhixian was stunned, “Senior, you…”

The statue replied, “If my main body was here, I could suppress his madness intent and those vengeful spirits, but at this moment, I can’t suppress him at all. Not to mention that he has the Sword Domain.”

Bai Zhixian spoke solemnly, “Is there really no other way?”

“There is!” The statue continued, “It depends on whether you’re willing to do it.”

She looked up at the statue, “What is it?”

The statue simplified her answer, “Engage in mutual cultivation with him!”

“What?” Bai Zhixian was stunned.

The statue explained, “I’m sure you know what I cultivate in. I cultivate in the Dao of Yin and Yang. If you’re willing to accept my teachings, I can give you a supreme mutual cultivation technique. If you use that on him, then he’ll benefit, and so will you. After all, he’s a one in a million candidate because he has Primordial Violet Energy within him. Moreover, his body has been tempered by Primordial Violet Energy for years, so it’s much different than the body of an ordinary person. It can be said that your strength will rise tremendously if you engage in mutual cultivation with him!”

Bai Zhixian’s face became quite unsightly.

Mutual cultivation?

Bai Zhixian shook her head, “I refuse.”

Meanwhile, the statue said, “Looks like you’re still biased to the Dao of Yin and Yang. Do you know what life is? It is feelings and vitality, and your life is only whole when they are one. Besides that, there’s nothing wrong with this. Doing it with someone you love brings both joy and strength, so why not?”

Bai Zhixian glanced at the statue and asked, “Senior, is there no other way?”

“There is!” The statue continued, “Improve his sword intent and slaughter intent so that they can suppress his madness intent. In that way, he may be able to regain consciousness. Unfortunately, you are probably incapable of accomplishing that, and no one can either. Only he can.”

Bai Zhixian fell silent.

The statue said, “If he engaged in mutual cultivation with you, it’s very likely for him to attain the True Dao Realm. Life is a fusion of mental and physical life. People always speak about mental and physical health, and both are equally important. The Dao of Yin and Yang seeks the quintessence of all things. If both of you cultivate it, then based on his natural talent, it’s very likely for him to obtain enlightenment and see his own True Dao. As for you, it’s very likely for you to attain the True Void Realm.”

Bai Zhixian replied indifferently, “Can you give that cultivation technique to me? I’ll give it to his women, alright?”

The statue asked, “Why do I think so highly of you?”

Bai Zhixian remained silent.

The statue said, “Because you were born without any hair there. You were born with the Allure Physique. If you cultivate my sect’s technique, you’ll gain twice the results.”

Bai Zhixian’s icy cold face had a rare blush on it at this point. She glanced at Yang Ye, and then her face became normal when she noticed that Yang Ye’s expression had remained the same.

Meanwhile, the statue flicked a ray of white light into her forehead. A moment later, countless pieces of information entered Bai Zhixian’s mind.

A short while later, the statue said, “I won’t force you. I’ve stored the entire Yin Yan Sutra within your mind. Once you’ve made your decision, you can engage in mutual cultivation with him. If you’re really unwilling, you can just forget it.”

The statue suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, and then she frowned.

Bai Zhixian asked, “What is it?”

The statue spoke solemnly, “I sense a trace of aura coming from him.”

Bai Zhixian asked, “What aura?”

The status shook her head, “It’s impossible for a Sprite Progenitor to exist in Eternal Border…”

Bai Zhixian wanted to ask more, but the statue suddenly said, “It’s getting dark. Don’t go outside.”

The statue’s eyes gradually dimmed down and fell silent.

Bai Zhixian’s face instantly became solemn when she witnessed this. She hurriedly walked over to the entrance of the cave. At this moment, it was sealed off by a door of light, and she heaved a sigh of relief upon laying eyes on it.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye walked over to her side and took her hand.

Bai Zhixian glanced at Yang Ye, and then she looked outside.

The veil of night had descended outside, and the entire world had fallen silent.

Suddenly, the ground quaked.

A solemn expression appeared on Bai Zhixian’s face.

It was the sound of footsteps! The footsteps were growing louder and closer. At this moment, even the towering mountain had started to tremble with the footsteps.

A short while later, a huge figure appeared before her.

Bai Zhixian saw its appearance clearly under the moonlight. It was no human, it was a being with a human body and the head of an ox. There were two horns on its head, huge lantern-like eyes, and a body that was pitch black like ink. Besides that, there was a very long tail behind it, and it was thick like a pillar and covered in sharp spikes. Every single step it took caused the ground to quake, mountains to shake, and a huge gully was torn open in the ground by its tail.

“A Primal Demon!” Bai Zhixian had an extremely solemn expression on her face.

It was from the Primal Era!

All the powers that currently resided in Eternal Border like the Immortal Estate, the two cities, the three sects, and the six clans were from other universes. However, they knew very little about the history of Eternal Border.

All they knew was that there had been an era before them, and it was called the Primal Era!

That era was a true era of the strong. During that era, there were Primal Demons who could shake the world with a single hand, there were powerful cultivators capable of obliterating universes with the flick of a finger, there was a Sprite Progenitor who was blessed by the universe and loved by all Sprites, and there were all sorts of powerful xenorace cultivators with special physiques who stood at the top of body refinement!

It was an era filled with experts.

Unfortunately, for some reason, it silently came to an end, and it left a blank space in history for those who came after them.

Now, a Primal Demon had appeared here!

The Primal Demon walked step by step toward the distance.

Suddenly, the Primal Demon stopped moving, and then he turned and looked in their direction, “Sprite…”

Bai Zhixian’s expression changed drastically!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye pulled her behind him, and then a black sword soundlessly condensed in his grasp.

At the same time, the Primal Demon slammed its fist at the mountain.

BOOM!

The towering mountain was instantly transformed into powder! It had been obliterated just like that!

At the instant it launched that punch, Yang Ye’s figure had suddenly turned ethereal, and then he swung his sword.

The Sword Domain!

With the madness intent and vengeful spirits there to enhance it, this attack could be described as Yang Ye’s strongest!

Because he’d sensed danger, so he’d used his full strength!

Bang!

Yang Ye and Bai Zhixian were blasted away!

Yang Ye’s sword that was condensed from vengeful spirits shattered as they flew through the air, and countless vengeful spirits returned into his body. At the same time, his body started to crack, inch by inch. Conversely, Bai Zhixian was in a much better state because Yang Ye had resisted all the force of the attack!

Suddenly, the Primal Demon took a step forward, and then it slammed another punch at them.

Bai Zhixian’s face instantly turned pale, but it didn’t take long for resolve to flash within her eyes.

She was about to put her life on the line!

But right when she was about to disregard her life and attack, a hand pressed down on her shoulder, and then a figure appeared in front of her.

It was Yang Ye, of course.

Yang Ye soared up into the air, and then a ray of light flashed.

Bai Zhixian was stunned on the spot, and her mind had gone blank!
