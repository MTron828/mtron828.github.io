Chapter 1852 – Yang Ye Has Shown Himself!

As soon as the golden rod appeared in the monkey’s grasp, a violent aura instantly swept out from the monkey. After that, he swung the rod horizontally.

A ray of gold light flashed, and then the three experts in front of the monkey vanished!

Everyone here was astounded!

Because they hadn’t been able to discern how those three people had vanished!

The monkey glanced at the surroundings and was about to attack again. However, the passageway behind him suddenly started shaking violently again.

The monkey frowned when he sensed this, and then he vanished on the spot.

Everyone hiding in the shadows was stunned by this. Because they hadn’t noticed how the monkey vanished. What did that represent? It represented that the monkey’s speed far surpassed their own!

Not long after the monkey vanished, a ball of golden light flashed out from the passageway. Everyone looked towards it, but they weren’t able to see anything. They couldn’t see through the light at all!

It didn’t take long for the light to disperse slowly, and then a bald man appeared before them. The bald man wore a golden robe and had a string of beads around his neck. Besides that, his body was covered in golden light that gave off a dignified and holy aura.

The black man glanced at the surroundings and said, “That monkey is vicious and extremely strong. If you encounter him, you should avoid offending him so as to avoid being killed.” He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

The surroundings fell silent.

No one chased after the man.

What a joke! That monkey had instantly killed three Quasi Enlightened Realm experts with a wave of his rod! Moreover, the monkey was even in a heavily injured state. Only the four Heavenly Exalts and three Ancient Cultivators possessed such strength!

Yang Ye and Dark didn’t chase after the bald man. They didn’t want to give their lives away!

Meanwhile, Dark said, “I’m going back to Heaven’s Net. Be careful. Even though we’ve refused to accept requests related to you, it doesn’t represent that others won’t be able to find you. I hope we’ll be able to meet again. Farewell!”

He vanished on the spot.

Once Dark left, Yang Ye immersed his mind into his body, “Brother Qiong Qi, is that monkey from your demon race?”

Qiong Qi replied, “Yes!”

Yang Ye asked, “Do you know him?”

Qiong Qi answered, “Do you know why the relationship between the human race and demon race isn’t that tense?”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Qiong Qi explained, “Because the demon race isn’t united. There are countless Demon Kings, and that monkey from before is a Demon King too. However, he’s a little different. He possesses extremely high prestige in the demon race. I just don’t understand why he was pursued until here!”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “This world is going to become chaotic!”

“It already is!” Qiong Qi continued, “All of these fellows have been constantly descending, and it’ll severely damage the balance of this world. Kid, you must improve your strength as soon as possible. Especially your realm of cultivation. It’s your foundation, and only by improving it will your physical strength, soul, and spirit be able to be improved. Unfortunately, you have quite a lot of trouble lingering around you, so you don’t have much time to sit down and cultivate!”

Yang Ye fell silent. Even though his strength had improved tremendously, who were the people who’d just descended? They were ancient existences who’d lived for tens of thousands of years. Not to mention someone like him who was only barely able to fight Quasi Enlightened Realm experts now, even a Quasi Enlightened Realm expert would be nothing before them!

Train!

Train like a madman!

Once he returned to the outside world, he glanced at the surroundings and left.

Not long after, Yang Ye suddenly stopped in midair, and then he turned around and launched a punch towards his right.

Bang!

A muffled explosion resounded around 1km to his right, and then a black clothed figure appeared there!

Yang Ye frowned, “It’s you!”

The black clothed figure before him was the man who initially refused to exchange the Spirit Energy Pearl for his Fruit of Rebirth.

The black clothed man said, “Didn’t you have friends? Come on! Call them!”

Yang Ye glanced at the man. Obviously, this fellow had been investigating and figured out that Yang Ye had just been scaring him!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “How about we fight someone else?”

The black clothed man replied, “As you wish!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he shot up into the sky. The black clothed man’s aura immediately locked onto Yang Ye and followed behind him.

Once they entered the boundless reaches of space, Yang Ye went to a dead planet. As soon as he descended there, the black clothed man appeared not too far behind him. The black clothed man was about to speak when Yang Ye turned around and slammed his fist at the man!

Bang!

The man was caught off guard and blasted 3km away!

The black clothed man looked up at Yang Ye, “I didn’t expect you to be a body cultivator. How rare and interesting. You….”

Suddenly, his voice stopped abruptly because Yang Ye had appeared before him, and then Yang Ye’s fist slammed down in his direction.

Yang Ye’s method of attack was very simple right now. It was just punching!

Overcoming everything with pure strength!

Suddenly, a black umbrella appeared in the black clothed man’s grasp, and then a ray of dazzling black light erupted from it. As soon as it appeared, Yang Ye felt a wave of piercing pain in his eyes, and then he felt like he’d been hit by a sledgehammer!

Boom!

The energy pushed him back repeatedly. During this process, Yang Ye’s expression changed because the black umbrella had suddenly appeared above him, and then an arc of light shot down at him!

Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly!

He twisted his right foot on the ground and moved 300m to the right. However, as soon as he stopped himself, the black umbrella still hadn’t vanished, and the black arc of light had arrived above his head!

Yang Ye didn’t dodge. He just clenched his right fist and swung an uppercut!

Bang!

When the force of Yang Ye’s punch collided with the arc of light, Yang Ye was instantly blasted downwards. However, the arc of light shattered as well. But it only took a moment for another beam of light to shoot out from the umbrella and slam against Yang Ye’s head!

The black clothed man immediately smiled when he witnessed this, but it didn’t take long for his smile to stiffen. Because Yang Ye suddenly stood up from the ground.

Yang Ye patted his head lightly and looked up at the black clothed man, “So it doesn’t hit hard at all!”

Earlier, he hadn’t dared to use his body to go head-on against the black light. After all, it seemed quite powerful. But after it slammed against his head, it didn’t seem as powerful as he’d imagined. He merely felt slightly dizzy, and it only took a moment for him to return to normal!

He’d underestimated his own body!

His body’s defenses were even stronger than his own strength!

The black clothed man stared at Yang Ye, “Why are you unharmed?!”

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath and just shot over to the black clothed man, and then he clenched his fist and slammed it forward.

Meanwhile, the black umbrella appeared before the black clothed man, and then a ray of dazzling black light shot out from it. Yang Ye felt piercing pain in his eyes, but he’d expected it, so he hurriedly slammed his left fist forward!

As soon as his left fist slammed forward, he hurriedly slammed his right fist forward again!

Rumble!

Explosions resounded incessantly.

At this moment, Yang Ye seemed like a madman who was swinging his fists madly at the black clothed man. He’d abandoned defending himself, and he ignored the black light as well. He just allowed the black light to strike him!

However, the black clothed man didn’t dare to abandon his defenses, and that was also why the black clothed man was being completely suppressed.

At this moment, Yang Ye was growing more and more excited as the battle progressed. Punching a person was completely different from punching the ground. The ground wouldn’t move, so the damage created was quite meaningless. But a person was different. A person would dodge, counterattack, and similarly release powerful attacks.

The black clothed man’s umbrella gradually started to crack.

Suddenly, the black clothed man flashed over 3km away, and then the profound energy within him surged into the black umbrella. As soon as that happened, the black umbrella expanded. It merely took an instant for the umbrella to become 300m wide, and then it appeared above Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, the black clothed man was standing on it.

“Nether Descent!” The black clothed man’s voice resounded, and then countless threads of black light, which were thin as the hairs on an ox, rained down from the umbrella. In just an instant, Yang Ye was completely drowned beneath them.

All of them stabbed against Yang Ye’s body, causing Yang Ye to feel like a million needles were stabbing him!

Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly. He clenched both his fists tightly and slammed them upwards.

Boom! Boom!

Countless threads of black light were obliterated, but as soon as he obliterated a bunch, another bunch appeared. They simply seemed endless!

At this moment, Yang Ye frowned. He felt that he’d underestimated the strength of a Quasi Enlightened Realm expert!

He knew he couldn’t allow this to continue! Otherwise, he would be heavily injured even if he could avoid death!

So, Yang Ye stopped concealing his strength.

Om!

A sword howl resounded, and then a ray of light stabbed against the center of the umbrella. The umbrella shook violently, and then it started to crack apart.

“Break!” Yang Ye’s voice resounded. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Boom!

The black umbrella exploded into bits that filled the surroundings.

Suddenly, Heaven Pillar Mountain was filled with clamorous noise.

“Yang Ye has shown himself!” Someone said these words, and it had spread like a plague throughout every corner of Heaven Pillar Mountain.

In an instant, countless beams of light shot up into the sky from all over Heaven Pillar Mountain, and they shot towards the depths of the starry sky!
