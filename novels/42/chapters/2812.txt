Chapter 2813 – One Against Three!

At this moment, it wasn’t just Yang Ye, even the others’ expressions had changed!

The woman in a plain dress wasn’t wrong, what was wrong was that they weren’t on the same level as her!

Even though it was quite a blow to them, it was a fact!

Her Dao was already the Dao of the world. No, her Dao may have surpassed the Dao of the world. The Dao of man wasn’t suitable for her anymore. So, just as she’d said, there is usually no right and wrong, and it’s just a matter of standpoint or opinion!

Yang Ye wasn’t wrong, and she wasn’t wrong either!

The woman in a plain dress’ smile grew even more alluring. She didn’t say anything else and just left.

She suddenly stopped after walking quite a bit of distance away, “You don’t have much time left. Or I should say that all of you don’t have much time left.”

Her figure gradually turned ethereal, and the area fell extremely silent.

A long time passed before the woman in white walked over to Yang Ye’s side and patted him on the shoulder, “Were you scared by that?”

Yang Ye gazed at her and smiled, “No, I’m just a little shocked. She really is far, far ahead of us!”

The woman in white nodded, “Your own effort is the decisive factor.”

Yang Ye looked up into the distance, and he could faintly see some clouds.

The more he got to know the woman in a plain dress, the more unfathomable she seemed. She was like the boundless starry sky that was always boundless.

She was strong and confident.

As far as he knew, the Unfettered One was the same, but the Unfettered One’s Sword Dao was too lacking in diversity. He only had one, but the woman had more than just the Sword Dao!

Yang Ye had no choice when facing all of this, he had to face her in the end.

Flee?

If he tried to flee, he would be destroying his own Sword Dao and Dao Heart. It would be denying everything he believed in. Moreover, the woman in a plain dress hadn’t killed him because he was growing stronger, but if he grew weaker, she would definitely kill him.

Moreover, he had the entire Three Dimensional Universe depending on him.

The Three Dimensional Universe would remain at peace while he was present, but if he fled and the woman in a plain dress exerted some pressure on them, the Three Dimensional Universe would instantly fall to chaos and become hell on earth!

“Come on, let’s continue!” The woman in white suddenly pointed her sword at Yang Ye, “Let’s continue!”

Yang Ye nodded and vanished on the spot.

The path ahead was difficult, but he had to traverse it. He couldn’t shrink back because it was difficult.

Fight!

Yang Ye’s sword grew increasingly sharp, and her sword energy grew increasingly lacking in ability to threaten him. Just as the strongest form of Destiny had said, her sword energy was still quite weak. Sword energy required quality over quantity!

The woman in black and Tu just watched from the side.

The woman in black suddenly said, “Her strength is unfathomable!”

She was naturally talking about the strongest form of Destiny.

Tu replied indifferently, “Actually, she seems like our form when we were at our prime, and the three of us are like clones. Of course, it may not be a bad thing for us. She has surpassed our previous prime, so she isn’t interested in the three of us anymore.”

The woman in black glanced at Tu, “She plans to destroy the entire Three Dimensional Universe.”

Tu shook her head and smiled, “I know. But the problem is that we can’t stop her, right?”

The woman in black replied softly, “But we must do our best. This universe is something our original form protected and kept safe.”

Tu shook her head, “She is our original form now.”

The woman in black gazed at Tu, and the latter spoke softly, “I’ll help both of you train Yang Ye, but I will leave after that. I’ve done enough for the Three Dimensional Universe. Since she doesn’t want to merge with us, then I want to live my own life. I’ve fulfilled my responsibility.”Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The woman in black fell silent for a short while and nodded, “I understand.”

Both Tu and her had never owed the Three Dimensional Universe anything. Since Tu wanted to leave, she had no reason to stop Tu!

Tu suddenly said, “Let me do it!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she floated forward, and the woman in white stepped back. A moment later, Yang Ye felt a wave of powerful energy assault him!

Tu!

At the moment he noticed that it was her, she was already in front of him. She didn’t use a sword and just slammed a punch at him!

Just a punch!

It was like the eruption of a volcano formed countless years ago, and the powerful force of it seemed like it would devour Yang Ye!

Yang Ye naturally didn’t dare to act carelessly against Tu. After all, among the four of them, she was only weaker to the strongest form of Destiny!

Yang Ye took a small step back to avoid the force of Tu’s punch, and then he slashed forward. It was a simple and direct slash without any flashy movements, and it didn’t even carry sword intent or slaughter intent. It was just a simple slash!

Bang!

The force of Tu’s punch was slashed into bits, and her fist slammed against his sword.

Bam!

Yang Ye was pushed backward repeatedly. Meanwhile, Tu pressed forward and stomped down at Yang Ye!

Crack!

The space around Yang Ye cracked open, and the powerful force of her attack instantly obliterated the sword intent within Yang Ye’s sword.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly as he slapped his left hand down. His figure spun in a strange manner, and then he instantly arrived behind Tu while his sword swiped at her waist.

Tu stomped her foot down and used the counterforce to spin her figure around before stomping down at him again!

It was an attack that covered the entire area.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s sword hadn’t even shot forward completely when it was stomped down.

Tu raised her right hand slowly before slapping it down again.

The space around Yang Ye collapsed while a mouthful of blood sprayed from Yang Ye. At the same time, Tu dived down. She was like the sky, and while she descended, it was like the sky was falling!

The explosive force in that instant was simply indescribable.

Obviously, Tu was using her full strength right off the bat. She didn’t try to probe him or hold back, nor did she dare to hold back. Yang Ye wasn’t the same Yang Ye she used to beat up in the past!

He was a true expert now!

Even she didn’t dare to be careless against Yang Ye!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed when he saw her dive down at him, and then he raised his right palm. The Sword Precursor soundlessly formed in his grasp, and then his figure spun as he transformed into a spinning ray of sword energy that shot up into the sky.

Hiss!

The sword energy minced apart the space he passed through!

This time, Yang Ye didn’t take a step back and chose to collide head-on against her!

Tu’s punches were extremely overbearing on their own, so if he were to take a step back and weaken his imposing aura, she would grow stronger instead!

Bang!

The sky shook violently as the space in the surroundings started to quake as if it had been hit by a sledgehammer! At the same time, two figures split up in the sky, one went up while the other went down!

Tu looked down at Yang Ye from above and slowly clenched her right fist. Meanwhile, Yang Ye raised his sword at an angle, but he didn’t look at Tu and just closed his eyes slowly.

The woman in black suddenly spoke softly, “It’s time to decide the outcome!”

The woman in white nodded.

Suddenly, Tu gradually pressed her palms together!

Rumble!

The space around her quaked and rippled! It was absolutely shocking!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s eyes were still closed, and he was calm like still water!

One caused a violent reaction while the other was absolutely calm!

A moment of silence ensued, and then Tu suddenly pulled her palms apart and gently pressed them downward.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

In an instant, two rays of overlapped energy swept over, causing the space beneath her to shatter. The space there seemed like it had been pushed away by something, and it was an absolutely horrifying sight!

Yang Ye suddenly unfurled his palm, and the Sword Precursor floated above it. A ray of sword energy flickered at the tip of the Sword Precursor. Yang Ye took it by the hilt and soared up into the air, slicing open everything in his way!

It wasn’t the Fate Sword Dao or the Demonic Sword Dao, and it was just an ordinary attack!

Hiss!

The space above Yang Ye was sliced open. The sword energy wasn’t suppressed by Tu’s attack, and conversely, Yang Ye’s sword seemed to be able to overcome power with gentleness.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye’s sword to grow increasingly closer to Tu.

Tu’s eyes narrowed slightly as she slammed her fist down.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword suddenly sped up!

Boom!

As soon as they came into contact, Tu was blasted backward! Yang Ye pressed forward and arrived before her, and then he slashed with both hands.

Bang!

Tu was blasted backward again!

Yang Ye gazed at Tu, and then he suddenly released his grip. A sword shot forward like a bolt of lightning.

At the same time, Tu took a quick stride forward and swung a punch.

Bam!

The sword stopped but wasn’t pushed back! Meanwhile, a hand grabbed the sword, and Yang Ye pressed it against Tu’s fist. However, he didn’t exert force and just retreated once it touched her fist!

Tu glanced at him and didn’t attack. If Yang Ye had used his full strength earlier, he would have been able to cripple her hand!

Yang Ye said, “Use your sword!”

Use your sword!

He still remembered that she was an expert in the sword!

Tu shook her head, “I can’t defeat you even with the sword!”

Yang Ye fell silent.

He wasn’t being conceited, but it was just as she had said. Besides the strongest form of Destiny, the mysterious expert, and the Unfettered One whose strength was still a mystery, there was no one else who could fight him in single combat!

The three of them were no match for him!

After all, he hadn’t attempted to strike a lethal blow until now, and he hadn’t used his Fate Sword Dao at all!

Right when Yang Ye sheathed his sword, Tu suddenly said, “While I can’t do it alone…”

When she spoke up to this point, the woman in white and the woman in black suddenly appeared by her side.

Tu looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “We will go all out in battle against you. I hope you’ll comprehend something from the battle.”

As soon as she finished speaking, they simultaneously vanished on the spot, and then three rays of sword energy appeared before Yang Ye!

One against three!

At this moment, Yang Ye truly felt threatened!
