Chapter 1849 – True Spirit Fruit!

Take it?

Could he?

Yang Ye would naturally not court death by doing that. After all, the man before him was a Quasi Enlightened Realm expert. Besides that, Dark had warned him that this place was protected by a mysterious organization. So, causing trouble here would be no different than poking a hornet’s nest!

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s little head and gazed at the black robed man. He raised his right palm, and there was a fruit on it.

The Fruit of Rebirth!

As soon as he withdrew it, Yang Ye noticed that many people suddenly gazed in his direction. Or to be more precise, they were looking at the fruit on his hand. Some of their auras had clearly become quite tense! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Yang Ye was shocked by this. He hadn’t expected so many experts to desire it. Luckily, no one attacked him.

Suddenly, the black robed man in front of Yang Ye said, “Do you only have this one?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I had two, but I ate one of them.”

The black robed man fell silent for a short while and said, “Give me one more and I’ll agree to the exchange!”

Yang Ye put away the fruit and walked away with Snowy in his arms.

If he were to take out another Fruit of Rebirth now, then the potential troubles he faced would be endless. Moreover, as far as he was concerned, a single Fruit of Rebirth was worth that Spirit Energy Pearl, and the black robed man was being quite greedy!

Suddenly, a masked man appeared in front of Yang Ye. The masked man didn’t say a word, and he just flicked a fist-sized ball over to Yang Ye, “At least four large worlds worth of spirit energy!”

Snowy blinked, and then took it in her arms. After that, she sniffed lightly, and a strand of pure spirit energy entered her body. As soon as it did, Snowy revealed an intoxicated smile.

She’s almost fully exhausted all the spirit energy within the old pearl, and that was why she yearned for a new one.

Yang Ye glanced at the masked man. He didn’t say anything and was about to give the Fruit of Rebirth to the man.

Suddenly, the black robed man from before appeared in front of Yang Ye, “I agree to the exchange!”

Yang Ye glanced at the black robed man. He didn’t say anything and just flicked the fruit over to the masked man, “Deal!”

The masked man took it and left.

Meanwhile, the black robed man suddenly walked over to Yang Ye, “What’s the meaning of this?”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Didn’t you refuse just now? Since someone wanted it, I naturally have to give it to the person.”

The black robed man didn’t speak, but Yang Ye could sense that the man was looking at him. However, Yang Ye ignored the man and walked away.

Suddenly, the black robed man appeared in front of Yang Ye, “Give me one and I’ll forget this ever happened!”

Snowy blinked while holding the Spirit Energy Pearl in her arms. She gazed at Yang Ye, nodded slightly to Yang Ye, and then entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye took a step forward and shouted, “Do you want to fucking fight?”

His shout was enhanced by profound energy, so it rumbled like a thunderclap through the entire hall.

At this moment, everyone gazed at Yang Ye and the black robed man.

The black robed man had clearly not expected this and was stunned.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “So do you want to fight?”

A powerful aura surged out from the black robed man, but an old man with a black cane suddenly appeared beside them.

The old man glanced at them and said, “Don’t you two know the rules?”

The black robed man was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly said, “He’s threatening me. He said he’ll kill me if I don’t give him a fruit!”

Everyone here felt speechless.

The old man glanced at the black robed man, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “He only threatened you but didn’t attack!”

Yang Ye replied, “I didn’t attack him either!”

The old man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “If there’s enmity between you, please resolve it outside. If you fight here, then be ready to bear the consequences!”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly turned around and left. He took two steps before he turned to look at the black robed man, “Come outside! Let’s fight fairly! I guarantee that I won't call for help!”

The black robed man’s hand trembled when he heard Yang Ye.

Since Yang Ye said that, it meant that Yang Ye intended to call for help.

Needless to say, the black robed man wasn’t really confident right now. Because Yang Ye was too confident and seemed as if he would definitely win.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was outside the hall. However, as soon as he walked out, he turned to look into the hall, “Brother Mo, Brother Yan, just watch and don’t interfere. I’ll fight him on my own!”

The people in the hall exchanged glances when they heard Yang Ye.

Who’s Brother Mo and Brother Yan?

It didn’t take long for everyone to look at the black robed man. At this moment, the black robed man was even more unconfident. After all, it was obvious that Yang Ye had come here in a group! But he was all alone.

To go or not to?

At this moment, the black robed man was in quite a dilemma. If he refused to go outside, then he would lose face! But if he did go outside… This fellow before him clearly had help.

After staying silent for a long time, the black robed man left the hall. However, he didn’t fight Yang Ye and just vanished from everyone’s fields of vision.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief when he saw this. Actually, he didn’t want to fight the black robed man as well. Because his current strength wasn’t sufficient to kill a Quasi Enlightened Realm expert. So, the best outcome from their battle was one where both of them suffered heavy injuries!

Besides deterring the black robed man, the reason he’d done that was to deter the others in the hall. Because many had definitely started targeting him because of the Rebirth Fruit. He would really encounter endless trouble if he didn’t deter them!

Now, it seemed like it worked!

Yang Ye didn’t leave immediately, and he returned into the hall instead. The hall had returned to normal.

All of them were Quasi Enlightened Realm experts, so they merely became slightly vigilant towards Yang Ye and weren’t fearful. Not to mention fearful, they weren’t even apprehensive. After all, were there even any weaklings amongst the people who were able to get in here?

Suddenly, an extremely dense fragrance appeared in the hall. At the same time, a voice resounded, “Selling a True Spirit Fruit. I’m only exchanging it for treasures of equal value. Come over here if you intend to make an exchange.”

Yang Ye noticed that everyone looked towards the source of the voice.

Snowy appeared on Yang Ye’s shoulder again, and she was looking in the direction of the voice as well. Moreover, Yang Ye noticed that her eyes were glowing.

Yang Ye slapped himself on the forehead. When did she become like this? She wants every treasure she sees!

Meanwhile, everyone in the hall had gone towards the source of the voice.

Yang Ye glanced over, and he saw a middle aged man being surrounded by the crowd. He wasn’t wearing a mask, nor did he hide his appearance.

Dark suddenly appeared by Yang Ye’s side, “Do you know what that is?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Dark explained, “The True Spirit Fruit only exists in the upper universe. It’s extraordinary, and it’s even better than the Fruit of Rebirth you just exchanged away.”

Yang Ye asked, “What does it do?”

Dark gazed at Yang Ye, “If you consume it, you may be able to instantly attain the 4th stage of the True Realm. Of course, it would be a waste to let you consume it. It’s most useful for people like us. Because the energy within it is extremely unique, and it can be stored within our bodies. So, it can be used defensively at the critical moment or used to strengthen us.”

Yang Ye asked, “Used defensively? What do you mean?”

Dark answered, “Simply speaking, if the stored energy is activated at the critical moment, it can at least stop two attacks which carry the full strength of one of the four Heavenly Exalts. If it’s used as energy to strengthen our attacks, maybe just a single strike would kill a Quasi Enlightened Realm expert. Of course, it would only destroy the target’s physical body.”

Yang Ye was quite surprised. If it was true, then the True Spirit Fruit was a treasure!

Dark said, “Instead of calling it a True Spirit Fruit, it should be called a Life Saving Fruit. Alright, let’s go have a look!”

Yang Ye nodded and followed Dark over there. At this moment, the people around the middle aged man were ceaselessly displaying their treasures, but the middle aged man shook his head. Obviously, none of them satisfied him.

Suddenly, an old man in a luxurious robe said, “Just tell us what you need. If we have it and are willing to complete the exchange, then we’ll naturally do it. Otherwise, doing this is just a waste of time!”

The middle aged man gazed at the old man, “What’s your best treasure?”

The old man shook his head, “The main issue is what you want.”

The middle aged man smiled, “You probably don’t have what I want.”

The old man glanced at him and remained silent.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye and Dark walked over to the middle aged man. The middle aged man flipped his palm, and the True Spirit Fruit appeared on his palm.

The True Spirit Fruit was quite big. It was bigger than an adult’s fist, crystalline, translucent, and emanated a faint fragrance.

Snowy’s eyes lit up when she saw it.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man raised it to Snowy and said, “Want it?”

Snowy quickly nodded.

The middle aged man suddenly said, “You can have it!”

Everyone here was stunned, including Yang Ye.

Suddenly, the middle aged man added, “But I have a tiny condition, and it’s a very simple one.”

He glanced at Yang Ye and continued, “So long as he gives me that sword, I’ll give this fruit to you. Alright?”

Yang Ye’s face instantly became gloomy.
