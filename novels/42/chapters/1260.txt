Chapter 1261 – Strike You When You’re Down!

Bang!

Suddenly, a loud explosion resounded like a thunderclap.

The black ape watched with shock as the thousands of legs that enveloped Yang Ye were suddenly blasted open. At the same time, a wave of terrifying energy swept towards the Ten Thousand Legged Centipede.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

The energy surged forward like a torrent. Everywhere it passed, the legs before it were completely blasted into pieces. In the end, the energy slammed against the centipede’s body itself!

Bang!

Another loud explosion resounded, and the enormous centipede was blasted around 1km back!

The black ape gazed at Yang Ye, and the shock in his eyes had transformed into astonishment that carried a trace of bewilderment!

What was that? It was actually so strong!

It was Rebirth Rank sword intent at the brink!

Yang Ye took a deep breath while his countenance turned slightly pale. Using the Brink Laws on his Rebirth Rank sword intent had almost exhausted him. It was an extremely dangerous situation just now, and his instincts told him that if he allowed himself to be caught by those legs, then he would definitely die. So, Yang Ye hadn’t hesitated to bring his Rebirth Rank sword intent to the brink!

Yang Ye was quite nervous when he brought his Rebirth Rank sword intent to the brink for the 1st time. Because if any mishap occurred, then he would really be courting death. Fortunately, it went very smoothly, and its might didn’t disappoint him! It hadn’t just destroyed those legs; it even heavily injured the centipede.

At this moment, there was a huge injury that stretched for almost 300m on the centipede’s chest. The area around the injury was completely mangled. As for those legs, thousands had been severed. The centipede could be said to be in quite a miserable state.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly gazed at the black ape, “What are you looking at? Get him!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye flipped his palm and emanated a wave of blood red light as he charged at the centipede.

Strike your enemies while they are down!

Yang Ye would naturally not let such an opportunity slip by.

The black ape was stunned for a moment, and then he tapped his right foot against the ground and shot forward, descending down like a mountain towards the centipede.

Meanwhile, Yun Banqing didn’t stand by idly, and she controlled the Void Cloud Shuttle to shoot 2 beams of blue light.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The centipede hadn’t recovered from his shock after being injured by Yang Ye, yet Yang Ye and the others had immediately launched an attack at it. So, it was instantly dazed and was pushed back incessantly.

Yang Ye and the black ape’s spirits naturally rose as they attacked, and their sword and fists descended incessantly upon the centipede. In next to no time, the centipede was covered in injuries. Especially from Yang Ye’s sword energy. With the amplification provided by the Sword God’s Seal, his sword energy had become extremely strong, and every single attack of his could pierce into the centipede’s body and cause a certain amount of damage.

The black ape’s punches were extremely strong as well. Every single one formed a deep impression on the centipede’s body.

It could be said that the centipede was being completely suppressed by Yang Ye, the black ape, and the Void Cloud Shuttle. He didn’t even have the chance to fight back!

The centipede was pushed back repeatedly while the injuries on his body grew more and more numerous. Yang Ye was growing more and more excited as the battle progressed, and he ceaselessly swung his sword to cut open the centipede’s body.

As they attacked and attacked, the black ape suddenly appeared before Yang Ye and stopped him from attacking. This made Yang Ye a little angry, “What are you doing?”

The black ape said, “Look where we are right now!”

Yang Ye was stunned. He glanced at the surroundings, and he instantly broke out with cold sweat when he got a clear view of the surroundings. Because they’d left the ruins of Sword God’s Palace. In other words, he couldn’t use his sword anymore. If the black ape hadn’t reminded him, then he would have probably offended that mysterious expert.

Yang Ye glanced at the centipede with slight regret. If they continued, they had a very good chance to cripple that big fellow. Even though that fellow was already severely injured, he clearly still had the strength to fight.

Yang Ye shook his head and looked at the centipede. At this moment, he’d returned to human form, and his upper body was covered in injuries from the sword and fist. Especially his face, it was covered in sword injuries that crisscrossed all over his face, causing him to seem extremely vicious. He was looking at Yang Ye as well, and the ferocity in his eyes was even more terrifying than the injuries on his face.

“What are you looking at!?” Yang Ye pointed his sword at the centipede. “If you’re discontent, then let’s continue!”

“3 against 1?” The centipede spoke fiercely, “Human! If you have the ability, then fight me in single combat!”

“Do you have no shame?” Yang Ye spoke angrily, “Just look at my realm of cultivation! I’m just a Saint. But a Voider Realm demon beast like you actually wants to fight a Saint like me in single combat? Do you feel no shame?”

“You!” The centipede’s face became absolutely unsightly. Because the meaning behind Yang Ye’s words was that a Saint like Yang Ye had actually beaten him up to such an extent, and it was an utter humiliation!

Just thinking about it caused the centipede to be unable to restrain himself, and he immediately shot towards Yang Ye.

Yang Ye and the black ape were delighted when they witnessed this scene. Once the centipede entered the ruins, both of them immediately attacked. Meanwhile, Yun Banqing didn’t let the opportunity slip by and used the Void Cloud Shuttle to shoot a blue beam of light at the centipede.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye and the black ape suddenly stopped. Because the centipede had retreated out of the ruins again. At this moment, there were many more injuries on the centipede’s body, and there was even a very striking strand of scarlet red on the corner of his mouth. He was started at Yang Ye, and if his gaze could kill, then Yang Ye would probably be dead by now.

Yang Ye flipped the sword in his grasp and said, “Come over here!”

The centipede wiped off the blood on his mouth and said, “Why don’t you leave that area?”

Yang Ye was stunned and said, “Come in here if you think you’re so strong!”

The centipede replied, “You come out here if you can!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

The black ape had a strange expression on his face.

After a long stalemate, Yang Ye suddenly shrugged, “Since you refuse to come in, and I refuse to leave, then let’s just talk.”

“Talk?” The centipede spoke fiercely, “What do we have to talk about? Human! You joined forces with that black ape to steal my treasure! You....”

“Wait!” Yang Ye suddenly interrupted him and said, “You say it’s yours?”

The centipede spoke angrily, “Who else would it belong to?”

Yang Ye gazed at the black ape, and the black ape was very cooperative, “The Energy Convergence Pool was established by the Sword God’s Palace, and the pure energy within it should belong to the Sword God’s Palace, right?”

The centipede replied, “The Sword God’s Palace is gone. I obtained the energy, so it naturally belongs to me now!”

“Who told you that it’s gone?” As he spoke, the Sword God’s Seal appeared at the center of Yang Ye’s forehead, “See? I’ve inherited the Sword God’s Seal, and I’m the master of Sword God’s Palace. All the possessions of Sword God’s Palace belong to me now, and the pure energy within the pool belongs to me as well. I didn’t try to get even with you for seizing possession of my Energy Convergence Pool for so many years, yet you actually try to look for trouble with me? You’re the truly shameless one!”

“What nonsense!” The centipede spoke angrily, “Human! You’re extremely shameless! The treasures of the world belong to the strong! Since I obtained it, then it’s mine!”

Yang Ye replied, “So according to what you just said, it’s mine now since I obtained it, right?”

“You!” The centipede’s face turned purple from rage, and he almost failed to restrain himself many times, but he forcefully stopped himself from attack in the end. Yang Ye, the black ape, and the Void Cloud Shuttle were entirely capable of beating him up!

A long time passed before the centipede laughed coldly, “Human! Don’t even leave there if you can!”

Yang Ye glanced at the centipede, and then he returned to the Void Cloud Shuttle with the black ape.

The black ape asked, “What do we do now?”

Yang Ye gazed at the black ape and replied, “Right, why do you want the energy within the pool?”

The black ape replied, “To heal my injuries!”

Yang Ye was astounded, “You’re injured?”

The black ape nodded, “I once consumed a spirit fruit. While it helped me attain the Voider Realm, it had poison within it, and all that poison remained within me. It’s slowly corroding my body, causing my strength to be reduced significantly, and it’s even a threat to my life. Because once the poison reaches my internal organs, it’ll be the day I die.”

Yang Ye asked, “That pure energy can remove poison?”

The black ape shook his head slightly, “I don’t know. But it’s my only chance.”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a short while and said, “Perhaps I can help you. But it depends on whether you trust me.”

The black ape asked, “What do you mean?”

Yang Ye explained, “My profound energy is slightly special. Perhaps it can remove the poison for you, but it represents that my profound energy will be entering your body....”

The black ape understood what Yang Ye meant. If Yang Ye had any ill intent while Yang Ye’s profound energy was within his body, then it would be extremely dangerous for him. So, the black ape fell silent for a long time before he asked, “How confident are you?”

Yang Ye replied, “90%!”

After all, he’d never encountered anything that Primordial Violet Energy couldn’t resolve.

The corners of the black ape’s eyes twitched, “Really?”

Yang Ye nodded in response.

The black ape fell silent again for a long time before he said, “Let’s do it!”

Yang Ye didn’t say anything. He just stretched out his hand and placed it against the black ape’s stomach, and then the Primordial Violet Energy within him flowed out slowly before entering the black ape’s body. At the instant it entered his body, the black ape’s entire body shook while shock appeared in his eyes.

However, Yang Ye paid no attention to the black ape, and he just continued controlling his profound energy to surge towards the poison within the black ape’s body.

Meanwhile, the centipede frowned. Obviously, he’d realized that Yang Ye was healing the black ape, and so he hesitated on whether he should attack!

After a moment of hesitation, the centipede was about attack. However, Yang Ye suddenly glanced at him while a smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth. The smile on Yang Ye’s face seemed like he was telling the centipede to come over to him.

The centipede instantly stopped moving, and he started hesitating again.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye withdrew his hand.

Huff!

The black ape suddenly let out a breath of air, and then his entire body shook. After that, he closed his eyes and scanned his body. A long time passed before he opened his eyes again, and there was a trace of excitement and happiness in his eyes, “The poison is gone. Human, I owe you a favor.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

As he spoke, he suddenly slapped Yang Ye on the shoulder, and it instantly slapped Yang Ye away.
