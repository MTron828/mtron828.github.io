Chapter 189 – Courting Death

Of course, he wasn’t heading towards the south entirely for the sake of rescuing those disciples of the Sword Sect. After all, he wasn’t their father or mother. Actually, he was mainly going over to see if he could gain any benefits. Because of the little fellow, he could dream of hunting Darkbeasts for Inner Cores.

Since he couldn’t target Darkbeasts, then he could only target humans.

After dashing swiftly with the little fellow for around a few hundreds of kilometers, Yang Ye had encountered some Darkbeasts all along the way. But he’d gone around them from afar because of the little fellow. The reason he didn’t subdue them was that the little fellow didn’t want them....

Yang Ye noticed that the violet mink had become more and more picky towards the quality of the Darkbeasts it subdued....

After traveling over 50km more, Yang Ye suddenly stopped moving and looked not too far ahead.

There were two people gazing vigilantly at him from around 40m away. Moreover, an enormous Darkbeast’s corpse was lying on the ground beside them, and it was still bleeding incessantly....

Obviously, Yang Ye had arrived at the wrong time.

Right when Yang Ye was about to speak, the young man on his left said abruptly, “You’re a disciple of the Sword Sect?”

As he spoke, the young man glanced at the Violet Spirit sword that Yang Ye held in his left hand.

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “I’m just passing by. Both of you can continue with your business!” As soon as he finished speaking, he intended to move around then and continue on his way.

“Wait!” Right when Yang Ye was about to go around them, the young man that spoke earlier had spoken once more.

Yang Ye stopped when he heard this, and then he turned his head to look at the young man as he said, “What?”

The young man smiled and said, “There’s no need to be nervous. We brothers have no ill intent. We’re disciples of one of the four great clans of the Imperial Capital, the Yang Clan. I’m Yang Feng and this is my younger brother, Yang Song.”

“The Yang Clan?” Yang Ye frowned and said, “I’ve never heard of it. Do you need something?” He knew that there were numerous wealthy and influential clans in the Imperial Capital. However, he’d never paid attention to all of this, so he was utterly unaware of the Yang Clan....

A wisp of rage flashed through both their eyes when they heard Yang Ye. Moreover, the young man by Yang Feng’s side, Yang Song, intended to flare up but was restrained by Yang Feng. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Yang Feng gazed at Yang Ye and revealed a smile once more as he said, “Since Brother isn’t a disciple of the Sword Sect and have never heard of my Yang Clan, then I presume you’re an independent cultivator of the southern territory. Since Brother has come to participate in the Ascension Rankings, then your strength should be very good. You ought to be aware of how terrifying the King Rank Darkbeasts on Ascension Mountain Range are. I have a suggestion. Let’s join forces and equally share the Inner Cores we obtain. What do you think?”

Yang Ye was stunned. He’d never expected that these two fellows would actually be intended to drag him into their group. If he possessed a weak strength, then their suggestion would be really good. But unfortunately, the thing he feared the least in the Grand Myriad Mountains was Darkbeasts....

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “There’s no need for that. I have other matters to deal with, so I’ll be leaving!” As he spoke, Yang Ye didn’t stay here any longer and flashed towards the distance.

When he saw Yang Ye refuse, a cold glow flashed in Yang Feng’s eyes as he gazed at Yang Ye’s figure, and he hesitated for a moment before he gave up in the end.

“Why did you let him go!?” Meanwhile, Yang Song spoke with slight displeasure. “Did you see the sword in his hand, it’s clearly not an ordinary sword. Moreover, he’s wearing that many spatial rings. I presume there is a huge number of valuables within it. Most importantly, he’s just an independent cultivator. Even if an independent cultivator possesses some strength, how strong could he be?”

Yang Feng shook his head and said in a low voice, “I’m unable to see through him! Think back to the moment when he saw both of us. Besides a little surprise, there was no fear or vigilance in his eyes. You have to realize that a King Rank Darkbeast was lying by our side, but he was actually not fearful or vigilant towards us at all. What does this represent?”

Yang Feng grunted coldly and said, “You’re just being overcautious. It doesn’t represent anything in my opinion. If you aren’t going to kill him, then I will. But all the treasures in his possession will be mine!” As soon as he finished speaking, his figure flashed, and he pursued Yang Ye.

Yang Feng’s expression changed, and then he hurriedly followed Yang Song.

.......

Yang Ye who was rushing forward seemed to have noticed something, and he suddenly stopped. After that, he turned around to look at the young man called Yang Song who’d arrived nearby.

Yang Ye was slightly surprised when he saw that it was Yang Song, and he said, “Do you need something?”

A wisp of greed flashed in Yang Song’s eyes as he gazed at the Violet Spirit sword in Yang Ye’s hand. When he heard Yang Ye, he looked at Yang Ye and said, “Hand over the sword in your hand and those spatial rings that you’re wearing, and I’ll spare your life!” He still had some reason left in him and didn’t attack directly. Because he felt that Yang Feng’s words made some sense, but he was truly unwilling to let such a ‘plump lamb’!

Yang Ye was stunned. Does he intend to rob me?

Yang Ye couldn’t help but chuckle when he thought up to here. He didn’t waste his breath on this young man. His figure flashed to instantly arrive in front of Yang Song, and then he drew his sword and slashed.

Yang Song was astounded. He’d never imagined that this fellow would attack without speaking a single word, and he was even more astounded that this fellow’s speed was actually so terrifying. Because he didn’t even have the time to react before this fellow had arrived in front of him. Right when he intended to dodge, a violet flash arose, and then Yang Song’s eyes slowly opened wide....

In instant, a strand of blood flowed down slowly from the space between Yang Song’s brows. After another instant, his body had split apart into two from there, and his bloody internal organs splashed all over the ground....

With a wave of his right hand, a spatial ring flew into Yang Ye hands, and then the corners of his mouth curved upward slightly to form a smile after he looked through the contents of the ring. The contents of the ring weren’t bad. He didn’t value the techniques and energy stones within it at all, and the only thing he did value was the two Inner Cores of King Rank Darkbeasts within the ring....

Yes, there were two Inner Cores that belonged to King Rank Darkbeasts within the ring. This was quite a good harvest got Yang Ye!

Suddenly, Yang Ye raised his head to gaze into the distance, and he saw that Yang Feng had suddenly arrived before him.

When Yang Feng saw Yang Song’s corpse, there was no rage and hatred in his eyes like Yang Ye had expected. On the contrary, his gaze was extremely calm as if he’d expected this!

“Aren’t you going to take revenge for him?” asked Yang Ye as he gazed at Yang Feng.

Yang Feng shook his head and said, “If it’s a disaster of nature, then something can be done to avoid it, but if it’s a disaster of one’s own making, then one is doomed. I’d already advised him earlier. Unfortunately, his judgment was clouded by wealth and refused to listen to my advice. He courted death himself by chasing after you and attacking you.”

“But you chased after me as well!” Yang Ye walked slowly towards Yang Feng as he spoke.

With a flip of his hand, two pure white pearls flew towards Yang Ye, and they fell into Yang Ye’s hand with a slight movement of his hand. Yang Ye was stunned when he saw these pure white pearls and gazed at Yang Feng while he said with a bewildered expression, “What’s the meaning of this?” The reason Yang Ye asked this was because these pearls were the Inner Cores of two King Rank Darkbeasts!

“Take the Inner Cores and spare my life, alright?” Yang Feng gazed at Yang Ye and spoke frankly.

Yang Ye gazed at Yang Feng for a short while before he said, “What if I don’t agree?”

“I’ll naturally try to bring you down with me!” Yang Feng shrugged and said, “I know you’re extremely strong, but I’m not a bug that you can just squash. Even if I can’t harm you, I can still create some trouble for you!”

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment before he said, “Why are you so sure that my strength is superior to your own and you don’t have even the slightest chance?”

“Because of him!” Yang Feng pointed at Yang Song who’d been split into two and said, “My strength is much more formidable than his, and it isn’t impossible for me to kill him. However, I’m absolutely unable to accomplish it so easily as you have. Of course, the most important reason is that I’ve guessed your identity!”

“You’ve guessed who I am?” Yang Ye was puzzled.

Yang Feng suddenly said, “You’re that Yang Ye who killed a King Realm expert at the entrance of the Imperial Capital!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed and said, “How did you find out?”

Yang Feng suddenly smiled and said, “Could it be that you’re unaware of how famous you are now? Perhaps you’re only ordinary in the eyes of the six great powers and the Imperial Academy, but in the eyes of the disciples from the various clans and the independent cultivators, you’re already an extraordinarily monstrous genius for being able to annihilate a King Realm expert from the Imperial Guard. Not to mention that you’ve even fought a Spirit Realm expert!”

When he spoke up to here, Yang Feng paused for a moment. He glanced at Yang Song’s corpse on the ground and continued. “I originally thought that they were false rumors. But now it would seem like it wasn’t a rumor at all. It was a fact!”
