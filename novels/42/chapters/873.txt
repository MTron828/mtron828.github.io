Chapter 874 – The Founding Ancestor!

A woman was walking down from the top of the stairs.

Gorgeous and enchanting!

She felt extremely gorgeous and enchanting to them at first glance!

She had a beautiful appearance, brows that were shaped like willow leaves, eyes that were bewitching like the eyes of a fox, a jade white complexion, and a curvaceous body. Especially those 2 large peaks before her chest. It seemed to be intentional as her clothes were quite low, and it exposed half of those peaks, and there was a deep ravine buried between the peaks.

It was a woman who could make any man go mad.

Of course, the reason she was described as enchanting was because she was completely crimson red. She had crimson red hair, brows, and even her eyes were a strange crimson red.

Chen Dong had an unprecedentedly solemn expression on his face when he saw her, and he walked over to Yang Ye and said, “She’s Fu Jinxian. Her origins are mysterious, and she’s extremely ruthless, especially to me. Someone once teased her in the past, and she annihilated the man’s entire family. Moreover, not only is she ruthless, even her strength is extremely terrifying as well. She once killed a high rank Half-Saint.... Supposedly, even the Protector of Order fears her a little!”

“Which one of you from the Ancient Sword School has come to challenge us? Quickly come forward so that I can kill you and return to cultivating!” Fu Jinxian stood on the stairs with her eyes slightly closed, and her red hair fluttered with the wind. She seemed indescribably cold and proud.

Yang Ye gazed at Fu Jinxian for a short while, and then he started walking towards her. Meanwhile, Chen Dong stopped him! Chen Dong gazed at Yang Ye and spoke in an extremely serious manner, “Don’t be careless, and flee if you’re no match for her. Those old fellows won’t blame you for that, and they won’t just stand by idly and watch you get killed. Understand?”

Yang Ye’s heart felt warm as he said, “Don’t worry!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s figure flashed off and arrived before Fu Jinxian.

“Attack me or you probably won’t have another chance!” Fu Jinxian still didn’t open her eyes.

Yang Ye chuckled and said, “Fu Jinxian, long time no see!”

Fu Jinxian’s figure trembled violently when she heard this, and then she opened her eyes slowly. Her figure shook once more when she saw Yang Ye, and her eyes were filled with shock, “You... you... you’re still alive?”

“You wished I did?” Yang Ye joked. He’d finally encountered a familiar face in this world, and so Yang Ye was in quite a good mood. Because besides being considered as an outsider, he had no sense of belonging here. Now, he’d finally met a familiar face, so it would be a lie if he said that he wasn’t happy. Even if she could be considered to be his enemy right now.

“You....” Fu Jinxian had an extremely complicated expression on her face.

Yang Ye asked, “Do you know how Xiao Yuxi and the others are now?”

She glanced at him and said, “They weren’t with me, so I don’t know.”

Yang Ye asked, “Didn’t all of you leave together?”

She shook her head, “We were attacked by a mysterious force when we left Profounder Continent, and it separated us. But it didn’t matter because we were almost out of Profounder Continent, so Xiao Yuxi and the others should be in the Central Divine Prefecture!”

“So that’s why....” Yang Ye nodded, and then he glanced at her, “Looks like you’re doing well here. I sense a very dangerous aura coming from you.”

Fu Jinxian replied, “You seem to have become weaker!”

Yang Ye grinned, “I really am slightly weaker than before!”

Fu Jinxian spoke in a low voice, “What exactly happened on the continent?”

“They died! Many people died!” Yang Ye continued, “Moreover, Profounder Continent doesn’t exist anymore.”

Fu Jinxian fell silent, and so did Yang Ye.

“What the fuck are they doing? Why aren’t they fighting?”

“It can’t be, right? They seem to be chatting? Could they know each other?”

“Tsk, tsk. Could Yang Ye had fallen for her? After all, Fu Jinxian is a rare beauty. So not to mention Yang Ye, I think even a eunuch’s heart would be moved by her!”

“If Yang Ye really has fallen for her, then the Ancient Sword School is probably going to suffer a huge loss!”

Chen Dong and the others frowned as well. Because they were really worried about that possibility as well.

There was a long period of silence between them before Fu Jinxian said, “How did you get into conflict with the Dao Order?”

Yang Ye said, “One of their disciples wanted to kill me, so I killed him. Then, they sent me a coffin. You should know my temper well. How could I possibly just jump in on my own accord? So, I destroyed the coffin. That really did cause a huge amount of problems to arise, and the Dao Order constantly sent its experts to kill me. In the end, I felt it was quite troublesome, so I came here myself to put an end to it all!”

Fu Jinxian gazed at him for a long time and said, “This isn’t Profounder Continent!”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a long time as well before he chuckled, “It’s all the same to me.”

“In the past, you were an existence that I had to look up to!” Fu Jinxian spoke solemnly, “Now, I’d like to find out if it’s still the same!”

Yang Ye said, “I’ll kill you if you attack me!”

The corners of Fu Jinxian’s eyelids twitched, and it didn’t take long for everything about Yang Ye in the past to flash through her mind. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye took a deep breath and looked up into the sky, “Fu Jinxian, out of consideration for the fact that we come from the same world, I’ll waste my breath for a little bit longer. I know you’ve become very strong, strong to the point that even I feel threatened. However, such a threat is nothing to me, honestly. Because I’ve seen something that was a thousand or even tens of thousands times more dangerous than you.” At this moment, Yang Ye recalled the Eye of the Heaven Dao and the endless Divine Lightning of Obliteration.

After experiencing that day, any imposing aura and danger on this world was nothing to him. Even if it was the pressure and imposing aura from a Saint!

Yang Ye continued, “I am quite a bit weaker than before, but trust me, if I’m willing to expose some things, then killing you would really not take too much effort. You can try if you don’t believe me, but I guarantee that it’ll definitely be the last battle you ever fight!”

He did consider their past relationship when facing her, but if she attacked him, then it meant that she was standing on the opposite side. In other words, she’d have chosen to be his enemy, and he never showed mercy to his enemies!

Fu Jinxian gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before she said, “You’re still so overbearing, decisive, and confident like you were in the past!”

Did she fear Yang Ye? She naturally did! It should be said that no one from Profounder Continent didn’t fear Yang Ye. Especially because she’d stayed by his side for some time, and she was quite familiar with his temper. Since he’d said that he would kill her, she knew that he wasn’t joking!

Yang Ye said, “I haven’t changed, but you’ve changed quite a bit.”

Fu Jinxian asked, “What’s changed?”

Yang Ye said, “You’ve become confident, much more confident than before. No matter what, congratulations on obtaining new life in this world!” When he spoke up to this point, he looked up at the sky and said, “You can send the next one now!”

“Jinxian, what’s going on?” As soon as Yang Ye had finished speaking, a beautiful woman appeared by Fu Jinxian’s side.

Fu Jinxian gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “I’m no match for him!” Actually, she was still quite confident in her ability. After all, she wasn’t the same Fu Jinxian anymore. However, she didn’t want to fight Yang Ye....

The beautiful woman gazed at Fu Jinxian for a short while before she asked, “Why?”

“He’s from the same place as me!” Fu Jinxian spoke solemnly, “Master, if it’s possible then make peace with him!”

“Peace?” The beautiful woman shook her head and said, “That’s impossible. Little Girl, since you don’t want to fight him, then head back and cultivate well. Let me see how monstrous someone from the lower dimensions is!”

Fu Jinxian glanced at Yang Ye before she turned around and left.

“Needless to say, you’re really not bad!” She gazed at Yang Ye and said, “I understand Jinxian’s temper very well, and she doesn’t even take the Protector of Order seriously. However, I’m able to sense that she’s quite fearful of you. I’m truly really curious. Exactly what sort of person are you?”

Yang Ye said, “Do you want to hear the truth?”

She said, “Go ahead!”

Yang Ye smiled, “If you knew of my past, then trust me, your Dao Order would definitely stop at nothing to kill me, even if it has to fight desperately and take me down with it. Otherwise, your Dao Order should make peace with me now!”

Her eyes narrowed slightly. She was about to say something when Yang Ye spoke once more, “Actually, I was exaggerating. I hope you didn’t believe it. Hahaha!”

When he spoke up to this point, Yang Ye walked towards the end of the Cloud Ascension Stairs and said, “Since I’ve already passed four of the tests, I’ll just overcome the 5th as well!”

“If you succeed, then I’ll write a ‘服’ character to express my acknowledgement!” The woman’s voice resounded from behind him.

“Writing from a Saint? Haha! Not bad! Just wait then!” Yang Ye roared with laughter as he entered the 5th test.

The scene before him changed once more.

There was a towering tree before him, and it stretched endlessly into the distance. Besides that, there was a green robed old man seated cross-legged beneath the tree.

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly when he saw the old man. Because he noticed that he was actually unable to sense the old man. No, it should be said that he felt that the old man had completely fused with the heavens and the earth here.

The old man was the heavens, and he was the earth as well.

That was what Yang Ye felt!

The green robed old man suddenly opened his eyes and gazed at Yang Ye, “The Enlightened Sword Heart, perfection of sword intent in the past, the Sword Domain, 2 types of Laws, a body comparable to a Half-Saint, and a foundation so solid that it’s simply unprecedented. Moreover, there’s a mysterious force concealing you from the workings of the heavens.... What a young man! What a young man indeed! Unfortunately, you’re an enemy of my Dao Order.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
