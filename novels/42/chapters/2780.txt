Chapter 2781 – Profounder Continent, the Unfettered One!

The others left, and only Yang Ye, the woman in white, and Snowy remained here.

Snowy would naturally not leave.

The woman in white stood up slowly. The hole in her stomach was still there.

She grinned, “I must go!”

“Go?” Yang Ye frowned, “Why? I Mean why don’t you heal up first?”

She shook her head, “If I stay here, I would be forcing her to attack.”

Yang Ye fell silent, “Senior, what did you mean just now?”

She pondered deeply for a moment and replied, “She dared to try and kill me, and that means she may not wish to merge anymore.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “She doesn’t want to become that form of me when I was at my peak. Or I should say she has surpassed my prime!”

Yang Ye fell silent.

The woman in white spoke softly, “Do you know about my background?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

She chuckled, “I was an ordinary person too, an extremely ordinary person. You may not believe me but I only started cultivating at the age of 24. Because the Heaven Dao of that time was heartless, and all things were like ants to it… It was a very dark time.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Do you know why I became so strong?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

She smiled, “Emotion. My Dao was actually just like yours. Yet now, she has… she has probably surpassed the Dao of Emotion.”𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

She gazed at Yang Ye, “Before my main body split apart into four, I really wanted to protect this world. At that time, I suppressed the Four Dimensional Universe and brought stability to the Three Dimensional Universe. It could be said that I brought balance to both universes… However, I was too strong. So strong that the universe couldn’t endure my strength. So, I split myself, and she is the strongest among the four of us.”

As she spoke, she looked up at the starry sky, “You know… I couldn’t even resist a single attack from her. This proves that she isn’t any weaker than when I was at my prime, and she can even travel freely between the Three Dimensional Universe and Four Dimensional Universe without affecting these universes. This represents that…”

She didn’t continue at this point.

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “So, we’re dead?”

She shook her head and gazed at Yang Ye, “Fight until the end and maybe there will be a way!”

She patted Yang Ye on the shoulder and spoke softly, “Good luck!”

The woman in white left the Primordial Pagoda.

At the Ascension Platform, Yang Ye fell silent.

At this moment, he’d truly realized how serious the situation was.

That woman definitely had big plans.

Of course, most importantly, she wanted Snowy and Erya!

The symbols of utmost goodness and evil!

Yang Ye looked up at outer space. Snowy and Erya were like his life, and he didn’t want anything to happen to them. So, he had to risk everything to that end.

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while, and then he returned to the cultivation room.

He sat down cross-legged and placed the Sword Precursor on his lap. After that, he closed his eyes.

Only that attack from before remained in his mind!

Burial was a sword that could counter Destiny’s swords!

However, Burial was completely crushed against Justice earlier!

A counter?

Yang Ye shook his head slightly because it didn’t exist! The facts proved that a sword was only strong because of its user! It wasn’t that Burial was inferior to Justice, but the main problem was that he was weaker to Destiny’s strongest form!

Under such circumstances, no sword would change the outcome!

Besides that, he noticed her Sword Dao during this collision!

It was a pure and true Sword Dao!

At that instant, he finally knew what the Sword Precursor and him lacked to attain the Ordinary Sword Realm!

It was the extreme that they lacked!

Yang Ye seemed like a monk in meditation within the cultivation room.

Just one man and his sword.

…

Outside the pagoda.

Along with Ding Shaoyao emerging from the pagoda, everyone outside surged into the hall.

She glanced at them and spoke softly, “He’s fine.”

They immediately heaved sighs of relief.

Ding Shaoyao spoke softly, “Don’t lower your guard. We are facing the Four Dimensional Universe, the mysterious expert from the End World, and Destiny. To be frank, our future is still unknown!”

Huang Ying nodded slightly, “We are naturally aware of that, Miss Ding. However, we have Brother Yang, so at least we feel a little more at ease with his presence. As for what happens next, we can only hope for the best.”

They nodded. At a time like this, they had no other choice but to risk their lives.

Surrender?

The enemy wouldn’t even accept their surrender!

The Three Dimensional Universe could only fight as one, and perhaps it may have a chance then!

Ding Shaoyao continued, “There is unrest in the city right now, so please deal with that!”

They nodded and were about to leave, but she suddenly said, “Wait!”

They gazed at her, and Ding Shaoyao fell silent for a short while before she said, “Open the city gates and evacuate everyone below the Destiny Realm.”

The others immediately revealed solemn expressions on their faces.

She said, “We must be prepared for the worst.”

Prepare for the worst!

A short while later, they left.

Only An Nanjing and Ding Shaoyao remained in the hall. Ding Shaoyao sat at the side with a calm expression on her face.

A short while later, she suddenly gazed at An Nanjing, “Miss An, I’m sure you know what staying represents.”

An Nanjing didn’t speak.

Ding Shaoyao rested against the chair and spoke softly, “You know… I think our chances of winning is zero this time.”

An Nanjing gazed at Ding Shaoyao, and the latter chuckled, “I don’t know what Destiny is planning, but I know that we’re pigs that have been raised in a pen. It isn’t that she doesn’t have the strength to kill us, she just wants us to grow fatter before she does. We cannot resist her absolute strength.”

She looked into the hall and continued, “He’s monstrously strong, but he isn’t facing a human this time. He’s facing a real god. A god who has practically instilled despair in two universes.”

An Nanjing looked up into the sky outside the hall, “May it be life or death, I will stay with him until the end.”

Ding Shaoyao glanced at her and smiled, “True. I let him down a lot in the past, so being able to die with him can be considered as a form of release for me!”

An Nanjing shook her head, “He never blamed you.”

She vanished on the spot.

Ding Shaoyao fell silent for a long time, and then she chuckled.

In the sky above Universe City.

Two women looked down at the city below. They were Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu, of course.

A short while passed before Qi Bitian said, “That kid is much stronger than before.”

Tian Xiu nodded slightly, and she had a grin on the corners of her mouth, “He has grown quite a bit.”

She seemed to have thought of something at this point, and she suddenly looked up at the sky, “Do you have any confidence in being able to kill her?”

Qi Bitian shook her head.

Tian Xiu fell silent.

Meanwhile, Qi Bitian added, “However, we can hunt that mysterious expert who tried to stop us earlier. That fellow is trying to scheme against him too.”

Tian Xiu nodded slightly. She looked down at Universe Hall, and then she vanished into the starry sky with Qi Bitian.

…

A sword cultivator was walking slowly through the boundless starry sky. He was walking very slowly. It seemed like he was taking a stroll.

He just walked forward until he entered a barrier of light, and then a new world appeared before him.

It seemed like it had been scorched, and it was filled with a rotten and scorched smell.

The entire world looked terrible.

The sword cultivator frowned slightly at the sight of this.

Suddenly, a middle aged man appeared before the sword cultivator. The man wore an ink black robe and had a single eye.

The sword cultivator looked behind the middle aged man, and then he moved his gaze away, “There isn’t anyone stronger than you.”

The man nodded slightly, “I’m Monarch Yan. May I know your name?”

The sword cultivator spoke softly, “Profounder Continent, the Unfettered One.”

Monarch Yan said, “Are you here in my Four Dimensional Universe just to fight me?”

The sword cultivator nodded, “That’s all I want. Just to decide on a victor, and we can avoid deciding on life and death.”

Monarch Yan fell silent for a long time. In the end, he shook his head, “I’m no match for you.”

The sword cultivator shook his head, “I think you can!”

Monarch Yan replied, “Perhaps I can if I risk my life. But forgive me, I have countless clansmen depending on me. I cannot risk my life against you.”

The sword cultivator fell silent.

Monarch Yan bowed slightly, “Please show me mercy.”

The sword cultivator suddenly asked, “You plan to invade the Three Dimensional Universe?”

Monarch Yan nodded, “It will only end in death.”

The sword cultivator’s thumb moved slightly, and a sword howl resounded.

Monarch Yan clenched his fists and was ready to attack at any moment. Meanwhile, a few dozen powerful auras appeared behind him and around the sword cultivator. This force was many times greater than the force that attacked Universe City!

They were all here for one person!

Moreover, a huge altar had started to come alive behind Monarch Yan.

Suddenly, the sword cultivator looked to the side. His gaze seemed like it could travel through space… A short while later, his sword descended back into its sheath.

Monarch Yan’s fists were still clenched, and he seemed like he was facing a formidable enemy.

The sword cultivator walked off into the distance.

Monarch Yan asked, “Why?”

The sword cultivator replied softly, “He may be my future opponent, but he’s a junior of my sect. Now that he’s in trouble, I planned to lend him a hand and kill you. But it seems that isn’t necessary anymore.”

Monarch Yan asked again, “Why?”

The sword cultivator didn’t say a word. He just vanished into the distance while Monarch Yan and the others watched.

A short while later, his eyes narrowed slightly, “Why does the Three Dimensional Universe have such an expert?! Is Destiny not enough?!”

…

At the moment the sword cultivator left, a man walked out of the hall in Universe City.

The man looked up at the sky and cracked a smile, “Everything is still quite nice.”
