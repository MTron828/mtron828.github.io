Chapter 2088 – The Dean!

Yang Ye frowned as he stood on the spot.

The god race has gone to the Sky Dimension!

Yang Ye’s heart sank. Are they planning to go to war with all the races right now?

Yang Ye couldn’t really figure out what the god race was planning. After all, if the god race acted against the sky race now, it was very likely that all the other races would join forces again. Of course, the god race was no fool, and they had definitely considered that.

Yang Ye thought for a long time before he made his decision.

Xiao Qi!

Even though he didn’t have a good impression of the Sovereign of Sky, the Sovereign of Sky was the Sovereign of Sky, and Xiao Qi was Xiao Qi. Xiao Qi had almost died to save him in the past. Moreover, she’d been constantly helping him all along the way, and he wanted to see what the god race was planning.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he transformed into a ray of light and vanished into the sky.

…

The incident in Cosmic Star City immediately spread to all the races.

This time, the god race had openly announced their return to all the races!

The return of the god race made all the races start preparing for battle. Some started to recall the experts of their races, and some started to form alliances. However, the races didn’t unite together as they had in the past.

Presently, the god race wasn’t the same overlord as it had been all those years ago, but the other races weren’t the same either.

A storm was brewing in the large universe.

The Sky Dimension.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive in the Sky Dimension. As soon as he entered it, he immediately sensed that something was off because the entrance wasn’t guarded.

Yang Ye immediately rushed towards the capital of Sky Dimension, Sky City.

Sky City.

At this moment, the defensive formation around the city was active, and pillars of multicolored light coiled around the sky above the city. Every single one of the pillars of light emanated horrifying energy.

As for outside the city, there was a middle aged man with a huge axe. This time, an old man was standing by his side. The old man was looking down slightly and had his arms crossed before his chest. There was a spear between his arms.

Besides that, there was another middle aged man in white robes standing by the old man’s side. The middle aged man held a folding fan in his right hand, and there was a faint smile on his face. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Sky City seemed like it was facing a formidable enemy!

Three Sages!

While the sky race wasn’t something that just three Sages could threaten, these three Sages belonged to the god race. No race would ever underestimate the god race, not even the high and mighty sky race.

They had no right to be proud before the god race.

Suddenly, the city gates opened slowly, and then a middle aged man walked out.

It was the Sovereign of Sky.

The Sovereign of Sky glanced at them and said, “What? Is the god race thinking of striking my sky race first?”

“Striking your sky race first?” The middle aged man in white robes chuckled, “What right does the sky race have for us to do that?”

The Sovereign of Sky’s face turned icy cold, “The god race isn’t the same god race anymore!”

The white robed man grinned, “But annihilating your race is still a piece of cake.”

“Is that so?” A cold smile curled up on the corners of the Sovereign of Sky’s mouth, “As expected of the god race. You’re still as arrogant and conceited as before. Looks like you didn’t learn how to be humble after what happened all those years ago!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand.

In an instant, five old men appeared before him.

All of them were Sages!

When he heard that the experts of the god race had arrived in the Sky Dimension, he’d decisively awakened some of the Sages that were in closed door cultivation. Besides that, he notified all the clans of the sky race to keep their Sages ready at all times. The clans immediately agreed to this request of his.

After all, could they continue surviving alone if their entire race was doomed?

Even though the sky race engaged in internal strife all year long, all the powers in the sky race were very well aware that the only way to survive a situation like this was to stay united. It wasn’t just the sky race, all the other races were the same.

When facing chaos, every race would only be able to survive if it stayed united. Otherwise, they would vanish from the large universe, just like many other races had done so before them.

“What a show of strength!” The white robed man chuckled, and then he glanced at the sky. A moment later, the sky dimmed down, and then the entire world suddenly turned from day into night.

An endless starry sky filled the surroundings.

The sky above Sky City was covered in stars, and starlight covered the entire city.

The Sovereign of Sky and the others’ faces fell from the sight of this. Someone actually set up a formation here without any of us noticing?!

The white robed man chuckled, “This formation is called Star Gatherer. Once it’s activated, even ten Sages can’t stop it. Of course, all of you will be fine, but this city will probably be lost. Sovereign of Sky, would you like to give it a try?”

The Sovereign of Sky gazed at him for a long time before he said, “Tell me why you’re here.”

Obviously, he was making a compromise.

The white robed man smiled, “I’m sure you’ve guessed why we’re here. I don’t know how you got our war god’s Elysium, but I know that his corpse should be here in the Sky Dimension, right?”

The Sovereign of Sky’s face became extremely gloomy when he heard this.

At this moment, he was extremely regretful. He regretted auctioning off Elysium. He’d auctioned it off for two reasons. Firstly, he wanted to get a huge amount of wealth to make advanced preparations. After all, if war was coming, immortal crystals would be extremely precious. Because immortal crystals were needed for both growing stronger and healing. So, he wanted a huge amount of immortal crystals just in case.

He hadn’t just auctioned off Elysium, he’d auctioned off other ‘dirty’ treasures.

As for the other reason, he wanted them off his hands. After all, they belonged to the god race, so if they stayed in the sky race’s possession, it would definitely draw over the god race. So, he wanted to get them off his hands. But he hadn’t expected the god race to openly show themselves. It was something he’d never expected!

Now, trouble was here!

Suddenly, the white robed middle aged man said, “Ten breaths of time. If the sky race doesn’t hand it over in ten breaths of time, then Sky City will cease to exist.”

The Sovereign of Man slowly clenched his fists.

Fight them?

Even though the god race was strong, just these three experts weren’t enough to pose a threat to the sky race. Even with Star Gatherer, they were still incapable of threatening the sky race. After all, the sky race had deep resources and reserves available to it, but they would have to pay a price!

The Sovereign of Man was hesitating.

Time trickled by.

Right when the ten breaths of time were about to be up, the Sovereign of Sky suddenly waved his right hand. A short while later, an old man appeared by his side, and the old man flicked a casket over to the white robed man.

The white robed man glanced at the Sovereign of Sky, and then he opened the casket. A man was lying within it.

A wisp of complicated emotions flashed through his eyes. After that, the middle aged man with the axe, the other old man, and him bowed respectfully towards the casket.

Respect!

Heartfelt respect!

During the battle all those years ago, too many had laid down their lives in battle to fight for a path to survival for the god race. The war god was one of them. It could be said that if the god race’s patriarch, Shi Tian, hadn’t led a group to hold the while the others escaped, the god race would have probably ceased to exist. That was why the god race was here to reclaim their war god’s corpse.

Meanwhile, the Sovereign of Sky’s heart hurt quite a bit because of this.

The war god’s corpse was no ordinary corpse. If he absorbed it, his strength would definitely undergo a qualitative leap. He’d wanted to do so as soon as he’d obtained it, but he wasn’t confident in his ability to succeed. Even if he was only 80% confident, he still didn’t dare. Presently, he couldn’t allow himself to suffer any mishaps. Otherwise, the sky race would be doomed. However, this delay had caused him to lose it completely!

The white robed middle aged man put the corpse away, glanced at the Sovereign of Sky, and then turned around and walked away with the others. At the same time, the formation above the city vanished.

The entire city returned to normal.

“Should we contact the other races?” Meanwhile, an old man by the Sovereign of Sky spoke abruptly, “The god race is back again. I think that the races should join forces again, and we’ll definitely be able to annihilate the god race.”

The Sovereign of Sky shook his head slightly, “As it is now… For example, our sky race and the human race. Do you think it’s possible for us to join forces with them? The demon race too. Do you think they’ll be willing to put aside the enmity between us? The human race and demon race are the same… Everything isn’t the same anymore. Now, all the races can’t reform that same unity again. Now, all the races only hope that the god race doesn’t come looking for trouble with them, and they only plan to deal with their own problems!”

“I think the god race won’t just spare anyone!” The old man spoke solemnly, “We slaughtered so many from the god race during that battle, and the god race will never forget that enmity so easily.”

The Sovereign of Sky looked up at the sky, “All we can do now is prepare for war. Notify the patriarchs of all the clans to see me in Sky City.”

The old man nodded slightly and left.

…

Far away in space. In a room within Martial Emperor Academy.

An old man glanced at the scroll before him, and then he closed his eyes slowly, “The god race…”

As soon as he finished speaking, the room fell silent.

A long time passed before he spoke softly again, “Why did the god race go to him… Did they notice something? Dean, what are you trying to do? The Unfettered One too. How strong is he? Dean, even you aren’t confident in being able to kill him? Sigh, such chaos! Such chaos!”
