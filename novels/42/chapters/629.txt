Chapter 630 – A Throwing Knife!

Bang!

Countless bolts of lightning surged out from within Lei Lin, but the young man was already over 1km away. Moreover, the sword in his hand was charred black.

Lei Lin didn’t close her eyes and explode apart like everyone had thought. Her countenance had merely turned much paler, and she seemed extremely weak.

Clang!

Right at this moment, a sword howl suddenly resounded from Ancient Domain City. Everyone here was slightly stunned before they felt overjoyed, and then they saw a ray of light appear in the sky before Yang Ye appeared in front of them.

“The first rank of the Exalt Realm?” The young man was stunned, and then he chuckled, “Looks like that’s the price you paid for forcefully improving your cultivation!”

Yang Ye paid no attention to the young man, and he just walked over to Lei Lin. Lei Lin puckered her lips when she saw Yang Ye, and then a bolt of lightning flashed through her eyes as she pointed at the hole in her chest. She said, “It hurts....”

Yang Ye touched the hole lightly and spoke gently, “I’ll avenge you, alright?”

Lei Lin nodded, and then she said, “I want to eat lightning....” She grabbed the Violetcloud Lightning as she spoke.

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched a little, and he said, “Will it die if you eat it?”

Lei Lin nodded and said, “It naturally will die upon being eaten. However, I can eat it in an instant, so it won’t feel any pain.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for whether to laugh or cry, and he said, “Can you not eat it?” The Violetcloud Lightning had been with him for some time, so he really didn’t want it to vanish from the world.

“But I’ve been injured, and I need to eat it to get better. Or I can eat this stupid flame as well.” Lei Lin spoke in a slightly sad tone.

When they heard Lei Lin, the shivering Violetcloud Lightning had stopped shivering, but the Nether Ghostflame started shivering instead....

“But it wouldn’t be able to play with you anymore once you eat it!” said Yang Ye in a gentle voice.

Lei Lin started hesitating slightly. Even though she wanted to eat the Natural Treasures, she wished that they would play with her. So if she ate one of them, then wouldn’t she have one less playmate from then? But if she didn’t eat them, then her injury really hurt. Lei Lin was quite troubled.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye placed his hand on Lei Lin, and then the violet profound energy within him flowed slowly into her. Lei Lin’s eyes that were on the verge of tears had instantly opened wide when Yang Ye’s violet profound energy surged into her.

A short while later, Yang Ye was just about to remove his hand and ask her how she felt, but Lei Lin grabbed his hand while she revealed a pleading expression on her face, “I want more....”

Yang Ye grinned and said, “I’ll give you more after I take revenge for you, alright?”

Lei Lin glanced at the young man from the Hallowed Grounds, and then she hesitated for a moment. In the end, she wanted to vent her grievances, so she released Yang Ye’s hand with reluctance.

Yang Ye rubbed her head, and then rubbed the violet mink’s head as well. Only then did he look at the young man from the Hallowed Grounds, and he said, “The Hallowed Grounds refuses to give up on killing me. Don’t worry, I’ll make the Hallowed Grounds regret it one day.”

The young man shook his head and said, “Needless to say, you have great potential, but I have to say that my Hallowed Grounds would be able to annihilate you even if you gain the same attainments as the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor. We would only have to pay a certain price. Trust me, I’m not trying to scare you. After all, how could my Hallowed Grounds have suppressed the defiant profounders for 100,000 years without some strength and reserves?”

“I’m only at the Exalt Realm now, but I’m still alive!” said Yang Ye. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The young man gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Perhaps you’ll die in a moment!”

Yang Ye grinned, and then he said, “The 2 others before you were just as confident, but they’re dead. Trust me, you’ll be the next.”

“How arrogant!” Right at this moment, Zhen Yun and Zhen Ling appeared by the young man’s side. Zhen Ling glanced coldly at Yang Ye and said, “Some people think they’re invincible just because they possess a little strength. But they don’t realize that they’re just clowns in the eyes of others.”

“Is that so?” Yang Ye chuckled and said, “How about we fight? I’ll kill you with 3 swings of my sword. Do you dare?”

Zhen Ling was furious but didn’t dare to speak a single world. She was a formidable master and an extremely accomplished one. She would dare to accept the challenge and go all out if it were anyone else or even a Monarch Realm expert. However, she wasn’t confident in her ability at all when facing Yang Ye. Because Yang Ye possessed the Enlightened Sword Heart! Possessors of the Enlightened Sword Heart could be said to be the bane of all formation masters!

Yang Ye laughed coldly when he saw her remain silent, and he said, “You realize who’s the clown now, right?”

“You’re courting death!” Zhen Ling was exasperated and about to attack. However, her older brother and the young man by her side had stopped her.

The young man glanced at the pair of siblings and said, “Immediately take the Nimbus Ships and leave if I lose. Don’t make any unnecessary sacrifices. Understand?”

“Senior Brother Yixie, how could you possibly lose?” Zhen Ling spoke with disbelief.

Mo Yixie grinned and said, “The information from our Hallowed Grounds was quite inaccurate. This Sword Emperor before us isn’t at the 8th level of Sword Intent right now. Not only has it not declined, it has attained the 1st level of the Heaven Realm. Yang Ye, I’m right, aren’t I?”

Heaven Realm Sword Intent!

Both Zhen Yun and Zhen Ling were stunned when they heard this....

After all, Heaven Realm Sword Intent was something that even a genius in the sword like Zuo Dengfeng had to rely on the Sword Seed to attain, and such Heaven Realm Sword Intent which was forcefully attained through the Sword Seed could only be considered as Artificial Heaven Realm Sword Intent. So, if Yang Ye really had attained Heaven Realm Sword Intent, then he could at least be ranked in the top 5 of the Hallowed Rankings. Because the expert ranked at the 5th position possessed Heaven Realm Intent....

Ding Shaoyao and the others gazed at Yang Ye with shock as well. They’d personally witnessed Yang Ye’s Sword Intent falling from the 10th level to the 8th level, but not only had it recovered now, it was even stronger than before!

Yang Ye glanced at the young man with slight surprise, and he said, “How did you know?”

“Because I’ve experienced Heaven Realm Intent from someone else!” Mo Yixie withdrew a black pouch from his waist as he spoke, and he opened the pouch to reveal a 3 inch long throwing knife. He clenched it between his fingers and said, “I’d thought that we would have to fight a horrifying battle to decide the victory, but I think that it isn’t necessary anymore. One attack, my strongest attack. I’ll leave right away if you can resist it!”

“Alright!” Yang Ye nodded and said, “We’ll decide the outcome with a single strike. I approve. But it’s impossible for you to just turn around and leave. After all, I’ve promised Lei Lin that I would avenge her.”

“Haha! Then bring it on!” Mo Yixie roared with laughter as the throwing knife in his hand glowed brightly.
