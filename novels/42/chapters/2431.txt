Chapter 2432 – Bloodline! Mad Demon Bloodline!

Yang Ye finally stopped holding back when facing Huang Tianxing with his activated bloodline.

Madness intent!

As soon as the madness intent appeared, Yang Ye’s body started to twitch and tremble.

Meanwhile, Huang Tianxing was in front of him.

Yang Ye raised his sword with both hands and swung it.

Hiss!

It seemed to be capable of splitting the world!

Boom!

Huang Tianxing was blasted around 30km away before finally stopping himself.

As soon as he stopped there, Yang Ye appeared in front of him again, and then Yang Ye’s sword descended!

Huang Tianxing was shocked and crossed his arms in front of him.

Bang!

The surroundings shook!

Huang Tianxing was blasted away again. While his figure had been blasted away, he’d left his arms behind!

He’d lost both his arms from a single attack!

Erya licked her tanghulu and couldn’t help but take a step back.

Madness!

She usually wasn’t that afraid of Yang Ye. Because Yang Ye was very reasonable at most times. However, once he released the madness intent and went mad, she was very, very afraid of him.

She’d seen him in this state while they’d been in Eternal Village.

He wanted to kill everyone! And he dared to attack everyone too!

Meanwhile, a ray of red light suddenly surged, and then Huang Tianxing was blasted away again.

Huang Tianxing’s body exploded apart as he flew!

Two attacks!

One took his hands, and the other his body!

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot again, and Huang Tianxing’s pupils constricted. Only his soul was left now, so he couldn’t take that attack.

Huang Tianxing swiftly formed a strange seal with both hands. In an instant, the space before him cracked open, and then a powerful aura rippled out from within. It was far beyond the aura of a Four World Realm expert!

It blasted Yang Ye back to where he’d been a moment ago!

“Haha!” Meanwhile, Huang Ying roared with laughter, “Eldest Brother! Oh, my Eldest Brother! I didn’t expect you to still be forced to use that life-saving talisman in the end! Haha!”

As soon as Huang Ying finished speaking, a beam of blue light enveloped Huang Tianxing, and then he vanished on the spot.

At the instant he vanished, he glanced coldly at Yang Ye, “I’ll be waiting for you in the Desolate World!”

Yang Ye was about to attack but Huang Tianxing had vanished.

Now that Huang Tianxing was gone, Yang Ye suddenly gazed at Ye Gou, and then a ray of light shot over.

Ye Gou’s expression changed drastically. In an instant, countless afterimages shot at Yang Ye, but they were obliterated as soon as they came into contact with Yang Ye’s sword energy. A moment later, a figure was blasted away.

It was Ye Gou, and his body had been blasted apart!

At the critical moment, Ye Gou abandoned his body and fled with his soul. He was so fast that it took him just an instant to vanish into the distant sky.

Yang Ye didn’t give chase. He just charged at Huang Ye’s group. The latter noticed Yang Ye’s actions as he fought Huang Ying, and his expression changed drastically. He abandoned Huang Ying and moved over 10km away.

Hiss!

Suddenly, a head flew into the air.

It was an expert from Eternal Border. He hadn’t been able to retreat in time and had lost his head.

A Four World Realm expert had lost his head from a single swing of the sword!

Huang Ye and the others’ expressions turned quite unsightly and they wondered how he suddenly became so strong!

Did he take some kind of pills?

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and Huang Ye’s pupils constricted. He bent forward and raised his palms before pressing them down. Space instantly solidified before him.

Meanwhile, a sword stabbed against that expanse of space.

Bang!

The solid space there exploded apart, and then a sword shot straight at Huang Ye’s forehead.

Right when it was about to arrive at his forehead, Huang Ying clamped down on it with both hands.

The sword couldn’t move another inch forward!

Yang Ye suddenly twisted the sword.

Huang Ye’s expression changed drastically!

Hiss!

The sword shot forward.

However, Huang Ye’s figure had vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye grabbed his sword with both hands and swung it.

Hiss!

The space in front of him was sliced open like a rag.

Huang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly as he took a step forward, and then a golden seal appeared in front of him.

He formed a seal with both hands, and then the seal shook before a wave of powerful golden light surged out from it. The golden light instantly pushed Yang Ye back.

But it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to charge at Huang Ye again. Huang Ye was about to use the golden seal again, but a black seal suddenly appeared above him.

The Seal of Suppression!

Yang Ye was mad, but he wasn’t stupid. At the very least, he still had his combat instinct. Huang Ye’s expression changed drastically when he saw the seal above him.

Suppression of the cultivation!

Huang Ye’s cultivation was instantly suppressed to the Three World Realm!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword had arrived!

Bang!

Huang Ye was blasted over 10km away, and his body instantly exploded apart once he stopped himself.

The Initial Emperor and the others took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye when they saw only Huang Ye’s soul remained, and their eyes were filled with fear.

Yang Ye was simply too strong right now.

Huang Ye glanced coldly at Yang Ye and said, “Retreat!”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

The Initial Emperor and the others vanished into the distance.

They’d fled!

They had chosen to avoid him for now!

“Brother Yang!” Suddenly, Huang Ying appeared in front of Yang Ye. He was about to speak when Yang Ye swung his sword with both hands.

Huang Ying’s expression changed drastically. He waved his right hand, and a wave of powerful energy rippled out.

Bang!

Huang Ying was blasted over 10km away.

Yang Ye’s sword arrived before him as soon as he stopped himself.

Huang Ying’s expression changed drastically. He was about to counterattack when a spear stopped Yang Ye’s sword.

It was An Nanjing.

Snowy was on her shoulder, and Snowy was looking at Yang Ye with worry on her face.

Yang Ye was about to swing his sword again, but it stopped upon descending a few dozen centimeters.

A short while later, Yang Ye slowly released his sword, and his eyes gradually regained their clarity.

The madness intent around him surged back into his body.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to return to normal.

An Nanjing nodded slightly when she saw Yang Ye return to normal, and then she returned to the Primordial Pagoda. Snowy hugged Yang Ye’s neck and kept rubbing her head against his face.

She was quite afraid of Yang Ye in that state.

Yang Ye rubbed her head and smiled, “I’m fine now.”

Snowy just hugged him and kept rubbing his face.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled. Actually, this was a good conclusion to the battle.

He’d used the madness intent because An Nanjing was within him now. He wouldn’t lose himself completely while she was here. An Nanjing and Snowy could help him regain his consciousness. It was because he would never harm them.

Even if he harmed himself, he would never harm them!

Meanwhile, Huang Ying went over to Yang Ye and laughed bitterly, “Brother Yang, you almost killed me!”

Yang Ye glanced at him and smiled, “Of course not. I’m lucky you didn’t injure me instead.”

Among Huang Ying, Huang Ye, and Huang Tianxing, he feared Huang Ying the most.

It was a feeling!

And his intuition was usually very accurate.

Huang Ying shook his head and smiled, “To be honest, I was really surprised by your strength. Especially when you entered that state. Even I’m not confident in being able to resist a few swings of your sword. You’re truly amazing!”

Yang Ye said, “Let’s not dwell on that. Brother Ying, can we return to the Desolate World now?”

Huang Ying smiled, “It’s only the beginning now.”

“Only the beginning?” Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What do you mean?”

Huang Ying smiled, “Brother Yang, my brothers aren’t dead, and those old fellows who support them haven’t shown themselves yet. Those old geezers are the most difficult to deal with. Besides that, there’s the Di Clan too. I heard a clan in Eternal Border is going to be united with the Di Clan in marriage. If that is successful, it’ll be troublesome too. There’s also the Hell Sect here in Hell World, they aren’t ordinary either.”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Isn’t the desolate race very powerful?”

Huang Ying grinned, “Brother Yang, it’s because I’m not the Crown prince. If I were the Crown Prince, they wouldn’t dare to target me. Unfortunately, I’m not.”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “I think I’ve found a huge amount of trouble for myself.”

Huang Ying laughed bitterly, “I’m sorry for dragging you down with me!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Not at all! We’re dragging each other down right now!”

Huang Ying roared with laughter, “Brother Yang, you’re really direct. I’m sure that battle exhausted a lot of your strength, so rest for now. I have to wait for someone anyway.”

Yang Ye asked, “You’re waiting for someone?”

Huang Ying nodded, “It’s someone who’ll be helping us. I’m afraid I won’t be able to return to the Desolate World if I don’t get more people to help this time.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly and didn’t say anything else. He sat down cross-legged and consumed a World Crystal.

After that, he sent his mind into the Primordial Pagoda.

Snowy and Erya went in with him.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground and started madly absorbing the Primordial Violet Energy here. Those battles and especially using the madness intent had given him deep comprehensions.

Besides that, he’d made a huge discovery, and the reason he was so strong while using the madness intent may be due to his bloodline!

His bloodline!

The Mad Demon Bloodline!
