Chapter 1745 - I’ll Annihilate Your Family First!

As the patriarch of the Yang Clan, he naturally understood that weeds had to be pulled out by the roots, or they would grow again when the time was right. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Just like Yang Ye’s father. The Yang Clan hadn’t been able to kill him all those years ago, so now Yang Ye was here, and Yang Ye was clearly more terrifying than his father. Yang Ye’s father had a sense of belonging to the Yang Clan, but Yang Ye didn’t!

Everyone knew that if Yang Ye was given the chance, he wouldn’t hesitate to wipe out the Yang Clan from the face of the Milky Way System.

So, not only did Yang Ye have to die, everyone related to Yang Ye had to die too!

Yang Ye gazed at Yang Xiao for a long time in silence, and then he turned around with the intent to leave.

However, Yang Xiao suddenly said, “You want to go to Merak System? Can you?”

As soon as he finished speaking, a few True Realm experts obstructed Yang Ye’s path.

At this moment, Yang Ye’s face instantly turned ferocious, and then he vanished on the spot.

Split Second!

His technique, Split Second, was extremely fast. However, the people here weren’t ordinary. So, while his speed was absolutely swift, they could still catch his movements.

So, at the moment he vanished, one of the Sentinel Guards in front of him swung his saber with both hands.

Clang!

A clear and loud clang resounded. That True Realm expert was pushed backwards by the force of the collision.

Suddenly, Yang Xiao said, “Watch out…”

As soon as he finished speaking, the head of that True Realm expert flew up into the air while his body was still being pushed back. Blood surged out like a torrent and formed a gorgeous arm in midair.

A 3rd stage True Realm expert had been killed with just two attacks!

The expressions of everyone here changed.

Yang Lianshuang glanced at Yang Ye. There was a trace of shock in her eyes too. The Sentinel Guards of the Yang Clan weren’t weak, and it was obvious from how fast that Sentinel Guard had reacted when Yang Ye attacked.

However, she hadn’t expected Yang Ye to end that expert’s life with just two attacks!

Obviously, Yang Ye had grown even stronger!

After Yang Ye killed that True Realm expert, he didn’t attack again. He seized the moment that everyone was stunned to shoot up into the sky. All he cared about was the Merak System.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded in the sky, and then Yang Ye returned to where he had been a moment ago.

Yang Ye looked up at the sky. At this moment, a huge barrier of light covered the sky above Phecda City. Numerous fist-sized mysterious symbols were flickering through the barrier of light, and countless strands of spirit energy were surging up into the sky from within the city. In the end, all the spirit energy surged into the huge barrier of light.

“The Sky Cloud Formation!” Yang Lianshuang’s eyes suddenly narrowed, “I didn’t expect you to even activate that formation too!”

A cold smile curled up on the corners of Yang Xiao’s mouth, “I told you. All of you’ll die today.”

Yang Ye stomped his right foot down and intended to shoot up into the air again. But Yang Lianshuang obstructed his path and said, “Don’t waste your energy. That formation is the final defensive formation of the Yang Clan. It’s only activated when it’s a moment of life and death for Phecda City. Once it’s activated, even a 6th stage True Realm expert can’t break through it in a short amount of time.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he suddenly gazed at Yang Xiao’s group, “I know that you’re definitely able to make them stop going to Merak System, right?”

“Yes!” Yang Xiao laughed coldly, “But do you think I would tell them to stop? Of course, if you beg me, I might consider that. So, beg me! Of course, you must kneel.”

Yang Ye gazed at Yang Lianshuang, “Help me do something.”

Yang Lianshuang asked, “What?”

Yang Ye gazed at Yang Xiao, “Bring his entire family here. Every single one of them.”

Yang Xiao’s face turned cold when he heard Yang Ye.

Yang Lianshuang gazed at Yang Ye for a few moments, and then she waved her hand, “Bring Yang Xiao’s entire family.”

A few True Realm experts behind her immediately vanished on the spot.

“Stop them!” Yang Xiao’s voice resounded, and then a few True Realm experts charged at those True Realm experts that Yang Lianshuang had sent.

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared before those True Realm experts. Their expressions immediately changed when they saw Yang Ye. Yang Ye had just killed a 3rd stage True Realm expert with two attacks, and they’d witnessed that with their own eyes.

So, they didn’t dare to act carelessly when facing Yang Ye!

Meanwhile, Yang Xiao suddenly waved his right hand, and then five more True Realm experts went over to Yang Ye. At this moment, there were eight 3rd stage True Realm experts in front of Yang Ye.

Eight!

Yang Lianshuang glanced at Yang Ye, “Can you deal with them?”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “I’ll leave the rest to you!”

“Alright!” As soon as she finished speaking, she charged at Yang Xiao. As for the others behind her, they immediately charged at the group that stood behind Yang Xiao.

The battle erupted!

The eight True Realm experts in front of Yang Ye surrounded him. At the same time, Yang Ye noticed that their auras were actually joined together, and it felt like they were a single entity and not eight different people.

Yang Ye stood in confrontation with them for a moment, and then they suddenly vanished on the spot.

A moment later, eight sabers appeared above Yang Ye, and the powerful auras carried within them warped the space around Yang Ye. Moreover, Yang Ye who suffered the brunt of it even turned pale.

This time, Yang Ye didn’t use the Sword Precursor, and he used the wooden sword instead.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and Yang Ye was blasted over 10km away.

As soon as he stopped himself, a wisp of scarlet red seeped out from the corner of his mouth. At the same time, his left arm and the left side of his body started to crack open. In just a short while, his entire left arm and the left side of his body had turned blood red.

The joint forces of eight 3rd stage True Realm experts was absolutely terrifying!

Not to mention that Yang Ye was just a Zenith Realm expert right now, he wouldn’t have been able to resist their joint forces with ease even if he was at the True Realm.

Yang Ye spat out the blood in his mouth, and then he looked up at them. At this moment, the eight of them suddenly vanished on the spot.

A wisp of ferocity flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes when he saw them charge at him.

In an instant, a black Sword Chest appeared before Yang Ye, and then six sword howls resounded. After that, the six swords formed a circle and started spinning rapidly.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The sound of something being sliced apart resounded incessantly. It was space that was being sliced open.

Everyone in the surroundings looked over in Yang Ye’s direction. They noticed that the space around Yang Ye seemed like it was being cut open by hundreds of scissors. Spatial rifts were ceaselessly appearing around Yang Ye, and these spatial rifts were even rapidly spreading towards the surroundings.

“AH!” A shrill and miserable cry resounded. As soon as it resounded, a second, and a third shrill cry resounded in succession.

Yang Xiao’s expression became extremely unsightly when he heard the shrill cries.

A few breaths of time passed, and then the battlefield finally calmed down. At this moment, only four out of the eight True Realm experts in front of Yang Ye remained!

Moreover, all four of them were heavily injured. Many had even lost some limbs, and they were covered in injuries. One of the True Realm experts had suffered exceptionally severe injuries, and that expert had even lost half of his head.

The surroundings fell silent. Everyone was looking at Yang Ye.

He’d killed five True Realm experts in just a short while!

At this moment, Yang Xiao and the others’ expressions were unsightly to the extreme. As far as he was concerned, even if eight True Realm experts couldn’t kill Yang Ye, they were definitely capable of heavily injuring Yang Ye. However, he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually kill four of them in an instant!

Losing five True Realm experts in just a short while was a huge blow to him, and it was a huge blow to the Yang Clan as well.

After Yang Ye activated the Obliteration Sword Formation, he immediately withdrew two Energy Pearls and swallowed them. At this moment, while he seemed extremely calm on the surface, he was actually exhausted. Activating the sword formation hadn’t just exhausted his profound energy, it had exhausted a huge amount of his mental strength. In short, it was still quite strenuous for him to utilize that sword formation at his current level of strength.

Suddenly, Yang Xiao’s expression changed.

It was because those True Realm experts Yang Lianshuang sent earlier had arrived not too far behind Yang Ye, and they’d brought a few hundred people with them.

Yang Xiao’s face was unsightly to the extreme when he saw them.

He’d thought that even if the joint forces of eight True Realm experts couldn’t kill Yang Ye, they would be absolutely capable of repulsing Yang Ye in a short while. So long as they pushed Yang Ye back, they could leave to save his family. However, the situation hadn’t developed in the direction that he’d wanted!

Yang Ye had killed four of the eight True Realm experts on his own!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and gazed at Yang Xiao, “I’ve always felt that enmity should not extend to the family. So, even if there’s enmity between me and someone, I usually just look for trouble with that person, and I rarely target that person’s family. I think that threatening someone with their family is a cowardly act.”

Yang Ye paused for a moment at this point and continued, “However, there’s always an exception. Merak System is like my reverse scale. Yang Xiao, let’s deal with the enmity between us on our own. So, tell your forces to return. Alright?”

Yang Xiao gazed at Yang Ye, “What if I refuse?”

Hiss!

Suddenly, over a dozen heads flew up into the air from within the group behind Yang Ye.

Yang Ye looked Yang Xiao in the eyes, “If you refuse, then I’ll annihilate your family first!”
