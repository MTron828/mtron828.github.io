Chapter 2683 – Sword Insight!

Yang Ye just laid there before the dilapidated hall.

The last rays of the setting sun were gone, and night had arrived, yet Yang Ye still laid there.

On the second day, the sun rose and fell, and Yang Ye still hadn’t regained consciousness.

The Primordial Pagoda was sealed too, so none could leave it.

A long time passed like this. Finally, at dusk, Yang Ye’s hand shook, and then he got up slowly.

He just rested his body against the stone stairs.

He felt utterly weak!

He felt like he didn’t have a shred of energy in him, and it was like someone had broken all his bones.

A long time passed like this before Yang Ye opened his eyes once more.

It was night now.

He felt a little better, and he just looked into the distance with indifference on his face.

He’d been beaten up!

And he hadn’t been able to fight back at all!

The woman had been so strong that not to mention in his current state, he wouldn’t have been a match for her even at his prime!

Why did she attack him?

Yang Ye really didn’t know, but he was sure that he’d never met her before. Moreover, she was definitely not someone from the End World. If she were an expert from the End World, he would have died a long time ago!

But she hadn’t killed him and had just beaten him up!

When had he offended such a terrifying expert?

Yang Ye couldn’t figure it out.

A short while later, he shook his head and stopped thinking about it. Because he really couldn’t recall when he’d offended her. He just walked over to Past Life.

Past Life was stabbed into the ground, and there were some cracks on it.

Yang Ye had an extremely solemn expression on his face when he saw those cracks.

Past Life had almost been broken by her with absolute ease!

What was this sword? It was one of the strongest divine treasures of this world, but it had almost been broken by a light squeeze of hers.

Her strength was beyond terrifying!

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he drew the sword and walked toward the wooden figures.

Yang Ye arrived before the three wooden figures, and they attacked.

Three swords shot forward!

Two breaths of time later, a figure fled out of the hall in a sorry state, and a beautiful arc of blood followed behind the figure.

It was Yang Ye, of course.

Outside the hall.

Yang Ye sat on the stone stairs while blood covered the stairs beneath him.

In the past, he’d experienced something similar in the Darkspace. He’d thought that it was the most terrifying experience in his life. Yet now, he realized that it was nothing when compared to his current experience!

He still had confidence in the Darkspace, but he was truly lost here.

He had two completely different mental states when the two experiences were compared.

At this moment, he felt that those wooden figures were impossible to defeat in his current state!

Yang Ye looked down at Past Life, “Bro, do you have any ideas?”

Past Life shook slightly and seemed to be replying to him.

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled. Past Life was telling him to fight!

Fight!

Yang Ye suddenly stood up!

Fight!

Yang Ye came to a sudden understanding. He’d been passively defending himself until now, but why should he? Couldn’t he attack first and subdue his enemies?

The sword wasn’t an inflexible weapon. It could strike last or strike first!

Yang Ye walked into the hall once more. As soon as he did, the three wooden figures attacked once more, but Yang Ye attacked first!

His sword was similarly fast, accurate, and ruthless!

It shot straight toward the leading wooden figure’s forehead!

But his sword was stopped!

It was stopped by the wooden figure with absolute ease. Moreover, after it blocked his attack, its sword moved slightly to the side and slashed down at him!

It descended like a bolt of lightning!

This time, Yang Ye was prepared. He tapped the tip of his foot down at the instant the sword slashed at him, and his figure twisted to barely dodge the attack. At the same time, his sword spun along with him to a sweeping slash at the wooden figure’s waist.

It was swift as a bolt of lightning too!

However, the wooden figure still managed to stop his attack.

It was because the wooden figure’s sword had somehow been pulled back to defend it!

Yang Ye didn’t attack again. He just turned around and fled.

It didn’t take long for him to escape the hall. It was because the other two wooden figures had launched a pincer attack against him!

Yang Ye was overjoyed outside the hall.

The facts proved that offense was the best defense!

Actually, he’d understood that principle a long time ago, or it should be said that he’d always known, and he’d followed it too. However, he’d been stunned by the strength of those wooden figures and actually forgotten about it.

Of course, even if he attacked first, the facts proved that he was no threat to the wooden figures!

However, it did give him hope!

Besides that, he’d realized the two sides of the sword!

At most times, the sword could go along with the flow, but if necessary, it could go against it!

The sword wasn’t inflexible, it was the same for the Sword Dao, and all the other Daos.

After resting for a while, Yang Ye walked into the hall once more. This time, he was more confident than before. However, as soon as he walked into the hall, a ray of light appeared before him!

Yang Ye instinctively raised his sword and blocked it!

As soon as he did that, he knew that something bad would happen! So, he instinctively dodged to the side.

Hiss!

A sword pierced through his shoulder!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye advanced instead of retreating, and he stomped his right foot down and slammed his figure forward!

Bam!

His figure slammed away the wooden figure before him, and then Yang Ye fled from the hall. It was because two more rays of light had arrived before him.

Outside the hall, Yang Ye sat on the stone stairs and laughed bitterly.

Those wooden figures weren’t really just wood because they actually knew how to attack first!

They had a mind of their own!

A long, long time later, Yang Ye walked into the hall once more.

And he fled over and over again.

Just like that, around two months passed!

An entire two months!

Every single time, he would flee just a short while after he entered the hall.

But Yang Ye’s injuries grew fewer and fewer.

Of course, it was impossible to discern because there were countless injuries throughout his body!

He was covered in scars. Now, even the disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect wouldn’t be able to recognize him.

He was completely disfigured!

Especially now that he only had a single arm left, he didn’t seem like the same person anymore!

On this day, Yang Ye walked into the hall once more. No, he’d charged in.

As soon as he entered, the clanging of weapons resounded.

It was so ear piercing!

A short while later, Yang Ye fled. But it didn’t take long for him to return once more!

In the hall.

A ray of light rushed at him instantly once he entered, and Yang Ye swung his sword too.

The three wooden figures and him had attacked at practically the exact same moment!

Four swords intersected in a flash.

If an expert in the Sword Dao was here, that expert’s blood would boil. Because this battle was truly too interesting.

It was fast and ruthless with judgment and counter-judgment. Exchanging blows, blocking and counter attacking, counter attacking and blocking, retreating as a means to attack, attacking as a means to avoid attack…

It was an amazing competition in the sword!

In the end, Yang Ye lost. He lost because he’d failed in his counter-judgment! The price was another deep cut in his chest!

Yang Ye turned around and fled!

He had to!Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

So long as he made a single mistake, he would be endlessly suppressed by them. So, he had to flee and stop the battle. He’d tried to turn back and attack again, but he always failed!

The sword technique and attainments in the Sword Dao possessed by the three wooden figures was truly unfathomable!

Yang Ye sat on the stone stairs outside the hall, and Past Life was on the ground before him!

Yang Ye gazed at it in silence.

At this moment, he’d understood some things. Regardless of whether it was Past Life, the Sword Precursor, the Sword Supreme, or any other sword, they were all just swords. There was no difference between them in the eyes of true experts in the Sword Dao!

Even an ordinary sword could triumph over a divine treasure in the hands of a true expert in the Sword Dao. Similarly, a powerful divine treasure would be trash in the hands of a weakling.

Of course, there was a difference in swords, and that was undeniable. Under the circumstances that both sword cultivators were equally matched, then their swords would be a very decisive factor in battle.

Very few sword cultivators throughout history had ever attained the level of the Ordinary Sword!

Two hours later, Yang Ye walked into the hall again.

In the hall.

Yang Ye stood there with his sword in hand. This time, he didn’t choose to attack first!

He gazed at the wooden figures, and they didn’t attack either!

Some time before, the first to attack would gain the initiative in battle, but as time passed, a change had occurred.

Now, the first to attack would be the first to reveal a flaw that may lead to being suppressed.

At this moment, it was like playing a game of chess. Before they even drew their swords, they had to consider endless possibilities, and the slightest mistake may lead to eternal damnation!

What was it to truly strike last and subdue your enemies?

What was Sword Insight?

When one attacked, life and death was already determined. That was what it was to strike last and subdue the enemy, that was true Sword Insight!

Similarly, what was it to strike first and subdue your enemies?

When one attacked, all possibilities were already accounted for, and life and death was already determined. That was true Sword Insight!

Everything had a Yin and Yang to it, and so did the sword!

At most times, while an expert in the Sword Dao merely swung the sword once, it was an attack that came from much consideration and anticipation.

Yang Ye and the wooden figures were standing in confrontation there. Just like that, three days and three nights passed, and Yang Ye was like a wooden figure too.

He didn’t dare to attack first. Because he wasn’t able to overcome all their techniques with a single attack. Similarly, they were unable to suppress Yang Ye with a single attack anymore!

A few days passed like this.

At dusk, the three wooden figures seemed to be confident.

Three swords shot forward in unison!
