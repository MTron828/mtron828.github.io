Chapter 2331 – Three Strikes!

Not enough for him to enjoy killing!

Yang Ye’s voice was very calm, but it caused the world to instantly go quiet!

“Amazing!” Meanwhile, a voice came from the side.

Yang Ye looked over and saw an old man. The old man’s aura was thick, and he couldn’t see through it.

The old man sized up Yang Ye and said, “You instantly killed a True Void Realm expert at the Progenitor Realm. Needless to say, your strength makes me feel ashamed of myself.”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly.

Hiss!

An afterimage flashed.

Blood red saber energy appeared above the old man, and it shot straight down with the intent to slash the old man into two.

The old man’s expression remained unchanged. A golden energy barrier surrounded him.

Bam!

Yang Ye and his saber were blasted back to where he’d been a moment ago.

As for the golden barrier of light, there were only some cracks on it, and it didn’t take long for the barrier to heal itself.

“Both the saber and sword!” The old man glanced at Yang Ye’s blood red saber, “I heard your sword is what you’re strongest in. Let’s give it a try.”

Yang Ye placed Invincible on his back, and then he stretched out his right hand.

A sword howl resounded, and then a ray of golden light flashed. It only took a moment for a sword to appear in Yang Ye’s grasp.

The Sword Supreme!

Yang Ye tapped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of sword energy that shot forward.

The old man closed his eyes slowly while the golden barrier appeared around him again. Meanwhile, a sword stabbed against the golden barrier.

Bang!

The barrier shook violently.

It had defended him against Yang Ye’s attack again, but just a moment later, Yang Ye’s figure turned ethereal.

The old man frowned slightly, and then Yang Ye twisted his sword.

Bang!

Countless watched as the golden barrier exploded apart, and the old man was pushed backward and finally stopped over 300m away. Moreover, there were two long spatial rifts beneath his feet.

It had been forcefully torn open by his feet!

“The Sword Domain!” The old man gazed at Yang Ye, and his eyes narrowed slightly, “No wonder a True World Realm expert of my Immortal Estate was killed by you. That attack of yours surpasses the True World Realm! Now, it’s my turn.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he made a grasping motion at Yang Ye from afar.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The sound of space cracking open resounded, and even Yang Ye’s body started to crack open at this moment.

Yang Ye frowned. He didn’t have the time to think and just swung his sword.

Hiss!

The space before him split open.

Meanwhile, the old man had vanished on the spot. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and Yang Ye was blasted over 3km away. As soon as he stopped himself, the space he resided in instantly cracked open. At the same time, an invisible wave of pressure locked onto him!

Crack!

Yang Ye’s body bent forward. At this moment, he felt like a million mountains were on his back! The powerful pressure caused even his internal organs to be on the verge of cracking apart.

Even if the old man couldn’t compare to Auntie Vege and the others, he was absolutely not much weaker than them.

“AH!” Suddenly, Yang Ye howled with fury as two strands of intent swept out from within him. At the same time, he flicked his sword up with both hands.

Hiss!

The space before him exploded apart, and the pressure on him instantly vanished. An instant later, Yang Ye stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of sword energy that shot at the old man.

Hiss!

Everywhere it passed, space was sliced into bits.

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he slammed his fist forward!

Bang!

A ray of golden light rippled out from his fist.

Boom!

As soon as they collided, the world rippled as an invisible wave of energy rippled out through the sky. Everywhere it passed, space trembled before it and rippled like boiling water!

Rumble!

Suddenly, an explosion resounded nearby, and then a figure shot through the sky and appeared over 10km away!

It was Yang Ye!

Yang Ye stopped, and a wisp of scarlet red seeped out slowly from the corner of his mouth!

Blood!

The old man’s face was calm, and there was nothing unusual about it!

It was suppression due to the gap in their realms of cultivation!

Suddenly, the old man looked to the side, and a woman appeared there.

It was Sword Scroll!

Sword Scroll glanced at the old man, and then she gazed at Snowy who had an anxious expression on her face, “Give him the Sword Gourd!”

Snowy was stunned for a moment, and then she hurriedly removed it from her waist and tossed it at Yang Ye. But just a moment later, it flew back to her and started trembling. Obviously, it was displeased.

Snowy was infuriated by this!

She slapped the Sword Gourd flying, and she refused to leave it at that. She flew over and grabbed it, and then started slamming it everywhere while ceaselessly complaining.

Oxxy instinctively took a step back upon witnessing this.

When it saw Snowy get angry, it felt slightly afraid for some reason! Even if it was much, much stronger than Snowy!

Snowy kept slamming the Sword Gourd all over. In the end, she grabbed it and tossed it into the sky.

Swish!

The Sword Gourd was tossed high above into the sky!

She didn’t want it anymore!

The corners of Sword Scroll’s mouth twitched slightly, “Perhaps she’s the only one in Eternal Border who dares to treat the Eternal Sword Gourd like that, and the Eternal Sword Gourd doesn’t dare to get angry with her.”

The old man didn’t care to watch Snowy beat up the Sword Gourd. While she was slamming it around, he’d charged over to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye didn’t stand by idly and wait for death to arrive. He released the sword in his right grasp and hurled Invincible with both hands.

Hiss!

A ray of blood red light tore through the sky as the powerful force it carried tore through everything before it.

Meanwhile, a ray of golden light arrived!

Boom!

The entire sky shook violently, and then the sky above the Sword Ruins cracked open. Moreover, the cracks started to spread rapidly in all directions. At the same time, Yang Ye was blasted away again.

The old man was about to attack again when he suddenly looked to the side, and an ethereal axe appeared before him.

The old man waved his palm!

Bang!

The ethereal axe was blasted away, but the old man frowned because a faint injury had appeared on his palm.

He looked up at Snowy. At this moment, Snowy was holding the ethereal axe with both paws while looking at the old man. She blinked, and then she tossed the axe at the old man again!

Hiss!

Everywhere it passed, space instantly turned ethereal!

It had turned completely ethereal!

The old man frowned slightly as he stretched out his right hand and shook it slightly.

Bang!

The ethereal Primordial Axe of Creation was blasted away. This time, it flew faster than it had the previous time!

A powerful wave of pressure slammed down upon Snowy.

Snowy’s eyes instantly opened wide from the sight of this. Suddenly, Oxxy appeared in front of her and grabbed the axe. However, Oxxy was pushed over 100m back before it finally stopped itself.

Once it stopped itself, Oxxy glanced at the axe in its grasp, walked over to Snowy, and passed the axe to Snowy.

Snowy blinked, and then she raised it and tossed it at the old man again!

The old man was at a loss for words.

Snowy was very weak, but the Primordial Axe of Creation was very strong. The axe tore through the air, and space couldn’t endure it at all, instantly turning ethereal before it. It was obvious that the space here would be obliterated if Snowy tossed the axe a few more times.

The old man glanced at Snowy, and then he vanished on the spot. He was in front of Snowy when he appeared again. But right at this moment, a black fist slammed at him!

The old man raised his hand and slammed a punch forward as well!

Bang!

As soon as they collided, a ray of golden light rippled out, and then the old man was pushed around 300m back.

He looked up and saw Oxxy standing before Snowy!

Suddenly, the old man looked to the side, and a ray of sword energy descended!

The Sword Domain!

It wasn’t one attack but two overlapped attacks!

The old man’s pupils constricted slightly. He wave both hands, and a ray of dazzling golden light shot forward.

Boom!

A rumbling explosion resounded through the area, and then two figures were blasted away in different directions.

It was Yang Ye and the old man!

The old man stopped himself after flying around 1km away, and there was an extremely deep injury on his forehead. Blood was ceaselessly seeping out from there.

Almost!

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly and looked up at Yang Ye. So long as this attack had gone just a little deeper, he would have died here today!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s entire body had cracked open and blood was seeping out incessantly from him. Fortunately, he had the Primordial Pagoda, so his body was healing rapidly.

The old man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then he suddenly raised his hands slowly.

Rumble!

The entire sky was suddenly covered in dark clouds as countless bolts of black lightning flashed incessantly far above. At the same time, the ground below quaked violently, and then a golden palm suddenly emerged from beneath the ground and shot up at Yang Ye!

Moreover, countless bolts of lightning rained down upon Yang Ye from the sky.

The might of the world!

Sword Scroll’s expression changed slightly from the sight of this, and then she hurriedly gazed at the Sword Gourd and howled with fury, “It’s your last chance!”

The Primordial Axe of Creation was the greatest amongst them, but its main body couldn’t come outside and help Yang Ye at all. Besides the axe, the next was the Sword Gourd! The old man’s cultivation was much, much higher than Yang Ye. So, without the help of external forces, Yang Ye couldn’t rival the old man’s strength at all!

Meanwhile, Snowy gazed at Sword Gourd too. The latter trembled slightly and flew over to Yang Ye, but Yang Ye ignored it.

It had a temper? He had a temper too! If it didn’t want to let him use it, then he wouldn’t!

Bang! Bang!

A strand of powerful sword intent and slaughter intent swept out from within Yang Ye, and then they surged into the Sword Supreme in his grasp. At the same time, the veins on Yang Ye’s arms bulged!

Profound Primal Energy!

Even the Profound Primal Energy surged completely into the Sword Supreme!

A wisp of resolve flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, and then he grabbed Sword Supreme with both hands and swung it.

The Sword Domain!

The first swing!

The second swing!

Two attacks overlapped, and the world cracked apart before it!

However, that wasn’t the end of it!

A third swing descended!

As soon as that happened, Yang Ye’s body suddenly cracked open and blood sprayed in all directions!
