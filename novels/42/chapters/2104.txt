Chapter 2105 – Soul Fire!

The swords of ice were vanishing, bit by bit.

Yang Ye appeared before her, and there was a sword floating above him.

It was the Sword Supreme!

At this moment, it was floating silently above him, but the sword intent and swords of ice around him didn’t dare to come closer.

The woman’s eyes were filled with disbelief, and her gaze was on the Sword Supreme.

Yang Ye was quite stunned.

He was about to do something when the Sword Supreme had suddenly flown out, and then the swords of ice vanished.

Besides that, based on the expression on her face, she clearly recognized the Sword Supreme!

Suddenly, the Sword Supreme flew over to her, and the woman’s figure instantly turned ethereal.

“NO!” She suddenly howled with shock, and then she appeared over 10km away. At this moment, she was exceptionally pale, and she seemed extremely weak.

Yang Ye frowned. When did this sword become so strong? VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The sword returned to Yang Ye’s side.

Meanwhile, the woman suddenly said, “You’re heading to the Sword Ruins!”

Yang Ye glanced at her, “How did you know?”

She fell silent for a short while and said, “It has been sealed and concealed by a grand formation. You won’t be able to find it.”

Yang Ye replied with a question, “You seem to know a lot about this place?”

She fell silent for a long time before she said, “I can take you there!”

Yang Ye asked, “What are your conditions?”

She glanced at the sword by Yang Ye’s side and said, “Nothing. Just come with me!”

She turned around and walked away.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and followed her.

She led him to a river of ice, and she pointed at it, “It’s over here!”

Yang Ye gazed at the river, but he saw nothing.

Meanwhile, she tapped her finger forward, and a strand of sword energy tore through the air. It suddenly split into two when it was about to enter the river, and then it split it four… In a short moment, sword energy filled the air above the river.

How powerful! Yang Ye couldn’t help but glance at her because her attainments in the Sword Dao were extremely formidable.

Bang!

Suddenly, the sword energy exploded apart and vanished. After that, a huge circle of light appeared before Yang Ye. However, it didn’t take long for it to vanish as well. At the same time, the frozen river returned to normal.

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she spoke solemnly, “When it appears again, use it… use that sword to destroy it. Once the formation is destroyed, the Sword Ruins will appear!”

Yang Ye nodded.

She waved her hand lightly, and then countless rays of sword energy appeared above the river again. Meanwhile, the circle of light appeared once more.

At this moment, Yang Ye drew his sword and swung it.

Hiss!

Sword energy tore through the air and instantly struck the circle of light. The circle of light exploded apart, and then the scene before Yang Ye instantly changed.

A short while later, Yang Ye and the woman appeared atop a desolate plain, and only an extreme scene of desolation could be seen from where they stood. Besides that, a 300m tall furnace stood there around 1km away from them.

“The Sword Furnace!” Meanwhile, the woman spoke softly, “Your sword was created in that furnace.”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Why didn’t they make another?”

“Another?” She laughed coldly, “Do you think one can be made just like that? Do you know how many divine treasures were used to create it? Just the Sprites totaled up to around 100 types.”

Yang Ye frowned, “They killed that many Sprites?”

She shook her head, “No, they didn’t kill them. They merely needed those Sprites’ help. Besides that, they used no less than 10 types of divine flames. Most importantly, they had help from the spirits of the universe when they made that sword, and the spirits used the energy of the universe to temper it and make it as sharp as possible. In short, they paid a terribly huge price to forge this sword, and it was to the point that they can’t afford to create a second!”

Yang Ye glanced at the Sword Supreme. It has quite the background!

Meanwhile, she suddenly asked, “She’s about to awaken, right?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and nodded, “I think so!”

The woman pointed at the furnace, “Place her in there, and then temper her with a divine flame to awaken her completely!”

Yang Ye gazed at the furnace, and she continued, “The remaining sword energy from all those years ago resides in there, and there’s a huge amount of remaining energy in there too. Of course, you must have a divine flame to complete everything.”

Suddenly, a small flame appeared in Yang Ye’s grasp, and he said, “Will this do?”

She glanced at it and said, “The Divine Yin Flame, you’re really quite capable to have even gotten that. However, it isn’t enough. While it’s extremely powerful, it isn’t enough for her!”

Yang Ye frowned when he heard this.

She walked over to the furnace, “Some Soul Fire remains within it. If you can take control of the Soul Fire, and then use it and your Divine Yin Flame to temper her, she should have a much higher chance to awaken. However, that Soul Fire is no ordinary fire. It’s the product of a progenitor igniting his own Soul Fire, and it’s absolutely destructive. The other progenitors were friends with him, so in order to preserve that thread of his Soul Fire, they sealed it along with the furnace.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “The problem you have to face now is that it will definitely come outside if you open the Sword Furnace, and you must take control of it. However, I don’t think you’re strong enough to accomplish that!”

Soul Fire? Yang Ye looked up at the furnace. It seemed extremely calm right now.

Yang Ye asked, “How strong is it?”

She replied, “Very strong. It was left behind by a progenitor, so ordinary Sages can’t resist it at all. Of course, you can give it a try.”

“I shall!” Yang Ye glanced at her, and then he appeared above the furnace. After that, he swung his sword down. The seal above the furnace was instantly obliterated.

As soon as it was destroyed, a terrifying wave of fire suddenly surged up from within it. In an instant, Yang Ye was drowned within it, and then it sucked him into the furnace.

The woman watched this with coldness and indifference.

A long time passed before she closed her eyes slowly, “It’s best if you never wake up!”

She didn’t leave and just stood there with an icy cold gaze.

In the furnace, Yang Ye felt like his entire body was cooked.

He knew the situation was bad as soon as it dragged him down here, and then he immediately summoned the Sky Dragon. However, even then, he still felt like he was being cooked.

He couldn’t endure the flames at all.

Bang!

Meanwhile, countless rays of sword energy appeared within the furnace, and they instantly formed a barrier around Yang Ye. However, they merely persisted for less than 10 breaths of time before being obliterated.

Leave!

Yang Ye immediately put his thoughts into action. He stomped his right foot down and intended to get outside. However, he hadn’t even flown up into the air before a wave of terrifying flames slammed down upon him, causing Yang Ye to be slammed to the bottom of the furnace.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye noticed that his skin had started to get burnt.

He knew he couldn’t let this go on!

Suddenly, Yang Ye thought of Snowy!

Is this Soul Fire considered to be a Sprite type being? Yang Ye didn’t have time to think, he just summoned Snowy. However, for safety’s sake, he enveloped her in his sword energy. So long as he noticed that she couldn’t handle it, he would immediately send her back into the Primordial Pagoda.

Once she appeared before him, Snowy sized up the surroundings, and then she sniffed lightly. In an instant, the flames turned ethereal.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief at the sight of this!

She can do it!

Snowy could counter the flames!

Yang Ye rubbed her head and said, “Hurry! Absorb everything!”

Snowy nodded, and then she opened her mouth and sucked. In an instant, she seemed like a tiny vortex that made all the flames here surge towards her. Suddenly, Snowy opened her eyes because a ferocious flaming face had appeared before them, and it was pouncing at them.

Yang Ye was about to counterattack when Snowy stopped him. He gazed at her, and the latter cracked a smile before clenching her pawns. After that, she slammed her fists at it.

Bang!

A terrifying wave of spirit energy sprayed out from Snowy’s fists, and it was like a torrent of spirit energy with extraordinarily shocking might.

Boom!

Yang Ye watched with astonishment as the flaming face was blasted to the walls of the furnace. However, Snowy didn’t stop there. She flashed over to the flaming face, and then grabbed it before slamming it against the wall.

Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!

Muffled bangs resounded incessantly in the furnace.

A short while later, Yang Ye said, “Snowy, you can stop now.”

Because he’d noticed that the flaming face was growing dimmer and dimmer as Snowy was ceaselessly absorbing the energy within it.

Snowy stopped and gazed at Yang Ye. Right when he thought that she was about to stop, Snowy clenched her paw and waved it lightly, and then she turned around and slammed it on the flaming face’s nose.

Bam!

The flaming face was slammed against the furnace wall again.

Meanwhile, Snowy patted her paws together and returned to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye felt quite speechless.
