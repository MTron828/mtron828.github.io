Chapter 1629 - Where’s The Earth Spirit?

Translator: InVader

Rebirth!

It represented the rebirth of the mental state.

A person was like a piece of iron, and it had to be tempered thousands of times to become extraordinary. The heart was the core of a person.

A rise in the mental state would allow one to undergo a transformation from inside out, a qualitative transformation!

The difference between the Dualism and Rebirth realms was in one’s mental state. The only method to improve one’s mental state was via experience. Experiencing life… Simply speaking, it was the fortification of the Dao Heart.

Everyone had their own Dao Heart. But as time passed, it would silently undergo changes. It was like how many wanted to be sword cultivators in the beginning, but as they grew, they may not want to be sword cultivators anymore, and they may become saber cultivators instead.

Stay true to the heart and strengthen it!

That was the Rebirth Realm!

The reason many failed to advance into the Rebirth Realm was because they couldn’t stay true to their hearts. Their hearts had been shaken, and it represented that their beliefs had collapsed. The blow something like that struck against a person was absolutely crushing.

It was like after raiding a child for 20 years, a man is told by his wife that the child isn’t his…

At this moment, Yang Ye had entered the cycle of reincarnation.

The world of rebirth had worldly experiences, emotions, all sorts of temptation, all manners of death and eternal farewells… However, as far as Yang Ye was concerned, it was nothing to him. Because he possessed the Enlightened Sword Heart!

No matter what he encountered, his heart was completely clear, and his beliefs weren’t shaken at all!

Just like that, time trickled by.

Two days later.

Milky Way System. Yanqing Continent. [1]

Yanqing Continent was a subordinate world of the Yang Clan, and it was the Yang Clan’s Second Young Master Yang Yan’s territory. It could be said to be the continent given to Yang Yan to manage and rule over.

Yanqing City.

A man in a green robe suddenly arrived before the gates of Yanqing City, and there were three old men behind him.

The man gazed at the city walls for a long time, and then he suddenly slapped his palm forward. The space before him immediately started to ripple.

Bang!

The huge city walls of Yanqing City instantly crumbled. Dust and dirt surged up into the air, and it covered the entire city for some time.

“How presumptuous!” Suddenly, a furious shout resounded from within the city, and then a huge palm capable of holding up the sky pressed down from above the green robed man’s group. In an instant, the ground beneath their feet started to collapse.

The man’s expression remained calm, and he just raised his hand and slapped it upwards!

Bang!

The huge palm exploded in midair, and then the green robed man took a step forward and slammed his fist forward.

Boom!

A huge area of the ground before him cracked open. Besides that, the city before him had been split into two.

“How dare you!” Suddenly, a furious shout resounded, and then numerous powerful auras flashed out from the city. It didn’t take long for three old men to appear before the green robed man’s group. Their expressions changed when they saw the green robed man’s appearance.

The black robed old man who led the ground spoke in a low voice, “Seventh Young Master, what’s the meaning of this?!”

The green robed man was the Yang Clan’s seventh young master, Yang Xing!

Yang Xing glanced indifferently at the old man, “Cut the crap and tell your master to come here.”

The old man spoke in a low voice, “Seventh Young Master, our young master isn’t here. May I know why you’re here? I…”

“He isn’t here?” Yang Xing laughed coldly, and then he took a step forward before smashing his fist forward again.

Bang!

Yanqing City was instantly thrown into chaos. The city shook like an earthquake was quaking through it, and countless shrill cries resounded from within while innumerable people fled madly out of the city.

The black robed old man’s face turned cold, “Seventh Young Master, this is Second Young Master’s territory, not yours. You…”

Suddenly, Yang Xing slammed his fist forward.

Bang!

Over two thirds of the city was instantly obliterated! His punch was that powerful!

The black robed old man’s face turned cold, and a wisp of ghastly coldness flashed through his eyes. Meanwhile, Yang Xing suddenly gazed at the old man, “What? You want to kill me?”

The black robed old man stared at Yang Xing and replied, “I dare not!”

Yang Xing laughed coldly, “I’ll count to three. If your master still refuses to show himself, then I’ll destroy his territory. One!”

The black robed old man’s fists were slowly clenched together, “Seventh Young Master, I have orders to protect this world. If you attack, then I may have to raise my hand against someone who’s my superior.”

“You?” A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of Yang Xing’s mouth. A moment later, he vanished on the spot.

The black robed old man’s expression had immediately changed when Yang Xing’s figure vanished.

Bang!

A moment later, the black robed old man was blasted almost 10km away. As soon as he stopped himself, numerous mouthfuls of blood sprayed from his mouth. Moreover, if one looked carefully, one would notice that his body had actually cracked open!

“Two!” Meanwhile, Yang Xing suddenly spoke again, “If your master refuses to show himself, then you can vanish with this continent.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he was about to attack. However, a voice suddenly resounded, “Seventh Brother, have you taken the wrong medicine? Why are you acting like this?!”

Yang Xing looked towards the distance. A woman in a green dress had suddenly appeared there. She seemed to be a little over twenty years of age. She had a slender figure, a beautiful appearance, yet oppressive coldness on her face.

She was the Yang Clan’s Third Young Miss, Yang Danqing!

Yang Xing spoke indifferently, “Where’s Yang Yan?”

Yang Danqing walked over to Yang Xing, “It doesn’t make a difference if you tell him or me.” A strange yet icy cold smile curled up on her lips as she finished speaking, and then she continued, “Seventh Brother, if you don’t give me a reasonable explanation, then perhaps you may not be able to leave Yanqing Continent today.”

Yang Xing laughed coldly, “Third Sister, allow me to be frank. You don’t have the ability to do that.”

Yang Danqing suddenly waved her right hand. In an instant, five old men appeared behind her.

Five Zenith Realm experts!

Yang Danqing chuckled, “Of course, I know how strong you are. Not to mention five Zenith Realm experts, even five more will definitely be unable to kill you. However, what about those who’re standing behind you right now? Can they escape?”

Yang Xing’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Why don’t we give it a try?”

“Of course!” Yang Danqing continued, “However, I want to figure out something before that. Seventh Brother, there’s no enmity between us, but you’ve suddenly come here and slaughtered this city. I really want to know why.”

“Why?” Yang Xing’s face was suddenly covered in ferocity, “Yang Danqing, do you still intend to keep on acting?” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

He waved his right hand, and then two heads shot over to Yang Danqing, “Don’t tell me that they aren’t your subordinates.”

Yang Danqing’s face fell when she saw those heads, “Yang Xing, what’s the meaning of this?”

“You’re asking me?” Yang Xing spoke coldly, “Yang Danqing, even though we’ve all become enemies because of the fight for succession, I’ve never offended both of you. But what about you? You actually waited to launch a surprise attack and reap the benefits of my hard work. Allow me to tell you that if Yang Yan doesn’t return what belongs to me, then I’m going to kill him before the competition!”

Yang Danqing’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Yang Xing, we did send these two, but we only sent them to investigate and not to do anything. I believe that based on their strength, they aren’t able to do anything to you, right?”

“How laughable!” Yang Xing continued, “Yang Danqing, are you still going to continue acting? All I want to know is if you’re going to return what belongs to me!”

Yang Danqing replied, “Let me repeat myself one last time. We don’t have anything that belongs to you. Besides that, allow me to give you a word of warning. Don’t be used by someone else!”

“So you refuse, huh?” Yang Xing nodded, and then he vanished on the spot. At the same time that he vanished, Yang Danqing’s figure vanished as well.

Bang!

Suddenly, a deafening explosion resounded like a thunderclap, and it caused the space in a huge area to ripple.

Boom!

Another explosion resounded, and then both Yang Xing and Yang Danqing were each pushed almost 10km back.

As soon as he stopped moving, Yang Xing intended to attack again. However, a voice suddenly came from the sky, “The competition hasn’t begun! Leave!”

The corners of Yang Xing’s eyes twitched when he heard this. He shot a glance up into the sky, and then he gazed at Yang Danqing, “Just wait. I’ll kill both of you first when the competition begins.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished into the sky with the other three old men who’d come with him.

Yang Danqing’s beautiful brows were pressed tightly together. Meanwhile, one of the old men behind her said, “Young Miss, someone might be framing us.”

Yang Danqing ordered, “Investigate it!”

The old man nodded and left.

Around an hour later, the old man appeared behind Yang Danqing, “Young Miss, we really have been framed.”

As he spoke, he passed a scroll over to her.

Yang Danqing took the scroll, glanced at its contents, and then her gaze instantly became cold. A moment later, she pressed down forcefully.

Boom!

The scroll exploded apart and was obliterated.

The desire to kill flickered in her eyes as she said, “Lu Lige… A black robed figure… The Wu Clan…”

Suddenly, a figure shot down from the sky, and then a grey robed man appeared not too far away from Yang Danqing.

Yang Danqing frowned slightly, “Wang Yan!”

It was one of the Wang Clan’s young masters, Wang Yan!

The grey robed man called Wang Yan gazed at Yang Danqing, and then he asked, “Where’s the Earth Spirit?”

1. It’s the combination of Yang Yan and Yang Danqing.
