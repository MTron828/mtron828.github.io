Chapter 1971 – Slaughter Those In Sight!

Snowy gazed at her little fist while bewilderment filled her eyes.

Why isn’t it working? Snowy wondered. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The woman in a green dress revealed undisguised fondness when she saw Snowy act in such an intelligent manner.

Since she liked Snowy, she wanted Snowy for herself!

The woman gazed at A’Man, “While a Sprite Lord is good, your life is better, right?”

A’Man looked the woman in the eyes, “That’s what I want to tell you!”

“Looks like you’re very confident!” The woman chuckled, and then she tapped her finger forward. A speck of green light flashed, and then it suddenly grew larger and instantly enveloped A’Man.

A’Man stretched out her hand. There was a spiked club in her grasp. She raised it and swung it horizontally.

Boom!

A rumbling explosion resounded, and then a figure was shot out. The figure passed through the violet light and arrived before the woman.

It was A’Man!

Once she arrived before the woman, A’Man’s spiked club slammed down at the woman.

Crack!

The space around her started to crack like a mirror!

The woman’s expression remained indifferent. When the spiked club arrived just around a few dozen centimeters away from her, a green needle that was thin as the hair of an ox stabbed against the top of the spiked club.

It was quite amusing to see a needle strike a spiked club, but that tiny needle stopped A’Man’s spiked club from moving even a centimeter lower.

A smile curled up on the corners of the woman’s mouth, and then she twisted her hand.

Bang!

A muffled explosion resounded, and then A’Man was blasted over 300m away.

While her figure flew backwards, her spiked club shot out from her grasp, and it whistled through the air as it shot towards the woman in a green dress.

Meanwhile, the woman flicked something forward.

Swish!

A green needle shot forward like a bolt of lightning.

The fine needle forced A’Man’s spiked club to a stop in midair.

The needle and club were in a stalemate in midair!

Suddenly, a green chest appeared before the woman.

A’Man’s expression suddenly became solemn when she saw the green chest.

The woman grinned, “The Myriad Needle Chest. It only annihilated a Know Dao Realm expert in an instant. However, every use will reduce its lifespan.” She pointed at Snowy and continued, “I only want it, I don’t want to kill anyone!”

Snowy blinked. She gazed at A’Man, glanced at the woman, and then patted Yang Ye’s shoulder lightly. She was telling him to hurry up.

A’Man spoke indifferently, “It killed a Know Dao Realm expert in an instant? Come! Let me try!”

The woman’s eyes narrowed slightly. She was about to attack when Snowy suddenly leaped up.

Everyone gazed at Snowy, but Snowy gazed at Yang Ye.

Because Yang Ye had opened his eyes!

Snowy flew over to Yang Ye, and then she wrapped her claws around Yang Ye’s face and kissed him. After that, she flashed into the Primordial Pagoda. But it only took a moment for a tiny head to emerge from Yang Ye’s chest.

Snowy gazed at the woman in a green dress, and then gestured at her. She was telling the woman to come at her! She was telling the woman to come play in the pagoda!

In the pagoda!

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head. The latter cracked a smile, and then quickly entered the pagoda again.

The Six Slaughters of the Weapon Dao!

At this moment, Yang Ye was still thinking about that technique!

It filled him with thoughts and ideas!

Meanwhile, the woman’s voice pulled him back to reality, “You’re the Sprite Lord’s master?”

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at her, “I’m not her master, but she’s mine. Besides that, I’m not selling that little fellow. So, fuck off.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye was shocked, When did I become so overbearing and vicious?

A’Man and Ling glanced at Yang Ye as well, and they seemed to have noticed that he was slightly different.

The woman frowned when she heard Yang Ye. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly started walking in the woman’s direction.

Kill!

At this moment, there were 10,000 ways to kill in Yang Ye’s mind, and he only wanted to kill right now.

He couldn’t stop himself from wanting to kill!

Yang Ye was shocked by his thoughts, and he hurriedly stopped.

Meanwhile, A’Man and Ling arrived by his side and asked softly, “What’s wrong?”

They noticed that there was something off about Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at A’Man, “I really want to kill!”

A’Man was stunned speechless.

The Six Slaughters of the Weapon Dao!

Yang Ye took a deep breath. Obviously, the Six Slaughters had affected him. Because even though he’d gotten used to killing in the past, he’d never had such a strong desire to kill!

Yang Ye shook his head and suppressed the murderous thoughts in his heart. After that, he looked up at the woman in a green dress, “I’ll repeat myself one last time. I’m not selling the little fellow.”

The woman’s brows raised up slightly, “What if I insist?”

“Insist my ass!” Yang Ye suddenly howled with fury, and then he transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

He was in front of the woman when he appeared again.

His sword stabbed straight at her!

It wasn’t the same as his previous attacks.

It was a little strange and a little complicated.

That was the woman’s impression of Yang Ye’s attack. Because she actually felt like there was no way to deal with it!

He can’t be underestimated! The woman tapped the tip of her foot against the ground, and her figure floated around 3km back. However, Yang Ye’s sword was still in front of her.

It was like his sword was stuck to her!

Her gaze gradually became icy cold. She flipped her right palm, and then three rays of green light shot forward. Meanwhile, Yang Ye flicked his sword a few times, and just that obliterated the three rays of green light!

Yang Ye’s sword shot forward!

Hiss!

An arm flew up into the air!

It was the woman’s arm!

The other two young men’s expressions changed drastically at the sight of this. One of them immediately charged at Yang Ye, but Yang Ye’s sword, which was shooting towards the woman, suddenly changed directions!

The man was horrified when he saw Yang Ye’s sword stab at him. Because he noticed to his horror that he actually didn’t know how to resist it.

Actually, it wasn’t impossible to stop, the problem was that Yang Ye’s attack had cracked his mental state!

It cracked his heart!

In the past, while Yang Ye’s attacks were sharp and fierce, they didn’t strike straight at the heart. Yet now, after he’d absorbed the essence of countless sword techniques, his attacks were gradually changing.

They were changing to attacks that struck the heart!

Besides that, after he absorbed the Six Slaughters technique, his mental state and Sword Dao underwent another change. Yang Ye hadn’t fully figured out what had changed, and he didn’t have time to do that right now. All he wanted to do now was kill!

The man in front of Yang Ye would naturally not just stand there and wait for death to arrive. He flipped his palm, and a sword appeared in his grasp before he stabbed it at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was stunned when he saw the man’s attack.

It was filled with flaws!

As soon as the man launched the attack, Yang Ye noticed that the man’s attack was simply covered in flaws.

The sword arrived in front of Yang Ye’s chest!

Yang Ye didn’t give it any further thought and just casually swung his sword.

Hiss!

The man’s sword was instantly sliced into two, and a head flew up into the air.

Blood sprayed out like a fountain!

After instantly killing the man, Yang Ye turned around and vanished on the spot.

The man had been a peak 5th stage Enlightened Realm expert, and he was just half a step away from the Dao Realm!

However, he’d been instantly annihilated by a single attack from Yang Ye!

After Yang Ye killed the man, he turned to look at the other young man, and then his sword appeared before the young man.

The young man’s expression changed drastically, and his figure shot over 10km back. He created distance between him and Yang Ye while fear filled his eyes.

While he was at the Dao Realm, his heart was filled with fear!

Because Yang Ye’s attack was too strange!

It was dangerous! He sensed a strong feeling of danger!

Yang Ye planned to continue his assault, but A’Man obstructed his path. She placed a hand on his shoulder and asked, “What’s wrong with you?”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and forced himself to calm down.

Quite some time passed before Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “I don’t know. I just have a strong desire to kill.”

A’Man frowned, “What happened earlier?”

Yang Ye didn’t conceal it, “I met someone, and I got some things from him.”

A’Man’s frown deepened.

“I need to calm down and clear my mind!” Yang Ye took a deep breath. Presently, even he felt that his current state was quite bad. Both his Sword Dao and Weapon Dao weren’t very stable. Especially his attainments in the Weapon Dao, it wasn’t just unstable, it was extremely dangerous.

Kill!

He had a really strong desire to kill!

Even someone like him who killed without batting an eyelid knew that it was definitely not a thought that a normal person should have!

A’Man said, “Let’s leave!”

Yang Ye nodded. He needed to meditate and calm down.

The woman in the green dress didn’t stop them because she still felt a sense of lingering fear towards Yang Ye’s previous attack!

Even if she was absolutely stupid, it was obvious that Yang Ye wasn’t ordinary.

A Sprite Lord wasn’t worth the risk!

Suddenly, a group appeared near Yang Ye’s group.

There were four of them!

All of them were at the Dao Realm!

Moreover, Yang Ye, A’Man, and Ling recognized two of them!

They were the two who’d escaped from the group of four that had tried to rob them a while back!

The man revealed a vicious smile as he gazed at Yang Ye and the others, “You didn’t expect to see us so soon, right?”

A’Man was about to speak when she suddenly gazed at Yang Ye. Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, “I don’t think I can stop myself anymore.”

The Six Slaughters of the Weapon Dao! Man Slaughter!

Man Slaughter represented killing everyone in sight!
