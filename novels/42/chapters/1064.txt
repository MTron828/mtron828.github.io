Chapter 1065 – Setting Out!

It was naturally impossible to just fly to the Central Divine Prefecture. Because even they would probably take at least 100 years to fly there. So, they had to take a Cloud Shuttle to the Central Divine Prefecture, and it was only available at Cloud City which was a few million kilometers to the south.

Strictly speaking, Cloud City belonged to Pine Prefecture as well, but it was too remote. It was so remote that it didn’t have any interaction or relationship with the various top powers of Pine Prefecture. So, while it was within the prefecture, it was very unfamiliar to the powers of Pine Prefecture.

After spending 3 days and 3 nights traveling, Yang Ye’s group finally arrived at Cloud City, and they were surprised to see that Cloud City was actually floating in the air. It wasn’t floating very high up, and it was just in midair. Besides that, colossal objects were frequently flying through the sky above the city. Those colossi were extremely swift to the point the 3 of them were almost unable to catch sight of their movements!

“Those are Cloud Shuttles. They are extremely swift and far surpass the speed of Saints. No, I should say that Saints can’t compare to their speed at all!” Xuwu Shen continued, “We have to ride one of them to get to the Central Divine Prefecture. But the price is absolutely expensive. Alas, my heart bleeds every single time I travel on one of them.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Yang Ye was curious, “How many extreme-grade energy stones does it cost?”

“Extreme-grade energy stones?” Xuwu Shen’s lips twitched, “It costs a violet crystal per person! A violet crystal!”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. A violet crystal....

“Both of you just have to follow me later. I know this place well!” Xuwu Shen’s face suddenly became serious when he spoke up to this point, “Because this place is connected to the other prefecture, there are all sorts of people and powers here, and many of them are from other prefectures. There are even some from the Central Divine Prefecture. So, we have to try our best to keep a low profile! In any case, I’ll deal with everything later. Alright?”

Yang Ye said, “You make it sound like I like to cause trouble!”

Xuwu Shen replied, “No, you don’t like to cause trouble, but trouble likes to look for you!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

The 3 of them arrived at the entrance to the floating city under Xuwu Shen’s lead. There were 2 guards on either side of the entrance. Yang Ye was surprised to notice that they were actually Half-Saints.

Xuwu Shen walked over to them, and he didn’t waste his breath at all. He just immediately flicked 2 spatial rings to them. They took them, glanced at their contents, and then put the spatial rings away. After that, the entrance opened slowly.

Xuwu Shen said, “Let’s go.”

Yang Ye and An Nanjing nodded, and then the 3 of them entered Cloud City.

“Wait here for me. I’ll go get the tickets!” Xuwu Shen vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

It didn’t take long for him to return with 3 crystal cards.

Xuwu Shen flicked one to Yang Ye and An Nanjing respectively, and then he said, “Let’s go. The Cloud Shuttle will be taking off soon.”

It didn’t take long for them to arrive before the Cloud Shuttle which seemed like a ship. It wasn’t small, but it wasn’t huge as well. It was around 300m long and around 100m wide. After they flashed their crystal cards, the 3 of them ascended the Cloud Shuttle.

There were a few dozen luxurious rooms on the Cloud Shuttle. Yang Ye and An Nanjing were about to walk towards them when Xuwu Shen stopped them. He laughed bitterly and said, “I bought tickets that don’t come with rooms. It can’t be helped, tickets that come with rooms require 5 violet crystals. That’s absolutely impossible to afford! So, we have no choice but to stay on the deck for a few days.”

5 violet crystals! The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. That’s like daylight robbery!

They had no choice but to get a spot to sit down cross-legged on the deck.

Suddenly, a man in embroidered clothes walked over to An Nanjing and smiled, “Young Miss, the wind out here is quite strong. Why don’t you come and rest in my room?”

An Nanjing frowned slightly. Meanwhile, the man continued, “Forgive me for my impulsiveness, but I have no ill intent towards you. I just noticed that your bearing is extraordinary and realized that you’re definitely not an ordinary person, so I wanted to be friends with you.”

He waved his right hand as he spoke, and 10 violet crystals appeared in front of An Nanjing, “It’s just a small gift, consider it as my apology. Please don’t refuse it.”

An Nanjing was about to speak when Yang Ye immediately took those 10 violet crystals, and then he smiled, “Brother, you’re too kind. Everyone is a friend. I truly admire your willingness to help others!”

The smile on the man’s face froze, but it didn’t take long for his expression to return to normal, “May I know who you are?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m Ye Yang, and this is my younger sister!”

The corners of Xuwu Shen’s mouth twitched. He glanced at the man in embroidered clothes while a trace of pity could be seen in his eyes.

An Nanjing glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent.

The man’s smile instantly became much more natural when he heard Yang Ye, “So it’s Brother Ye, nice to meet you indeed. I’m Lin Jingfeng from Darkness Prefecture. May I know which prefecture Brother Ye and Miss Ye are from?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Pine Prefecture!”

Pine Prefecture! A trace of disdain flashed through his eyes, but he concealed it very well. He glanced at An Nanjing and smiled, “It’s fate that allowed us to meet here. Why don’t all of you come to my room for some drinks?” Even though he seemed to be asking Yang Ye that question, he was frequently glancing at An Nanjing.

The man in embroidered clothes thought that Yang Ye would agree, but Yang Ye shook his head instead, “My younger sister likes a quiet atmosphere, and she doesn’t really like noise. Alas! Unfortunately, I’m poor, and I was unable to buy a ticket for her that comes with a room. Alas....”

The man was slightly stunned, and his face twitched when he saw Yang Ye sighing like that. After that, he glanced at An Nanjing and said, “A room isn’t a big deal at all. Since you like a quiet atmosphere, just leave it to me.”

He clapped once as he spoke. It didn’t take long for an old man to walk over and pass a golden card to the man in embroidered clothes. The man took the card and held it before An Nanjing, “This card is for room 15. It’s a first-rate room that contains a powerful Energy Convergence Formation. It’s extremely helpful towards your cultivation. I hope Young Miss Ye will accept this! Right, even though it costs 10 violet crystals, it’s just a small matter!”

An Nanjing didn’t move, but Yang Ye quickly took the golden card and put it away. After that, he gazed at the man and said, “Actually, I like a quiet atmosphere as well....”

The man was speechless.
