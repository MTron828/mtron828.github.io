Chapter 898 – Killing Their Way Back!

At the moment they chose to betray the Ocean of Clouds Academy and join Sky Divine Hall, they’d been listed as enemies in Yang Ye’s heart.

Enemies didn’t need any education!

The Herculean Sword swept through the area, and over a dozen cultivators were instantly annihilated.

It wasn’t just those cultivators that had betrayed the academy who were stunned by this scene, even the group behind Yang Ye were extremely shocked. All of them gazed at Yang Ye with extreme fear and even a trace of terror in their eyes!

It was especially so for Xia Bingwei. She even wrapped her arms around her cousin brother, Feng Wuchao, while fear and seriousness filled Feng Wuchao’s eyes as well.

Even Yu Wushuang who couldn’t stand the sight of Yang Ye had a gaze that was filled with fear!

It wasn’t terrifying when one was strong, it was terrifying when one was strong and so ruthless and cruel. That was horrifying!

“AHHH!!” Some of those cultivators who’d betrayed the academy had finally recovered from their shock, and a shrill cry resounded from them before they fled madly towards the surroundings.

As soon as the others recovered from their shock, all of them chose to turn around and flee madly without exception.

Yang Ye didn’t choose to chase after them. He turned around to gaze at the group behind him and said, “From now onwards, all of you will follow me and obey my orders. Does anyone have any objections?”

“On....” Yu Wujiao instantly felt displeased when she heard such a practically commanding tone, and she questioned him instinctively. However, she’d merely spoken a single word when the tip of Yang Ye’s Herculean Sword had arrived before the center of her brows. Its tip had pierced half a centimeter into her skin, causing blood to instantly seep out from her forehead and cover her pretty face.

“You just have to say if you have objections or don’t!” Yang Ye gazed indifferently at her.

The others couldn’t help but take a step back. This time, it wasn’t just fear in their eyes when they gazed at Yang Ye, it was terror!

Yu Wujiao was slightly stunned as well. She hadn’t expected that this man who stood before her would actually attack her just like that, and even act in such an overbearing and domineering manner! She’d always been a proud person, so the unyieldingness in her bones instantly surged forward when facing Yang Ye’s overbearing and domineering actions. She spoke furiously, “I strongly object!”

Yang Ye nodded. Meanwhile, Yu Wushuang suddenly stood in front of Yang Ye. She didn’t speak and just gazed at him. Yang Ye looked at her for a short while before he withdrew his sword, and then he glanced at the others and said, “I’m returning to Ocean of Clouds City. I can take all of you back if you’re willing to follow me. However, you must obey my commands. If you object or aren’t willing, then please leave.”

Li Maozhen, Li Qingyi, Leng Yuran, and the others immediately walked over to Yang Ye when they heard him. Li Maozhen and Li Qingyi were naturally confident in Yang Ye’s ability. After all, they were aware of his true strength and identity. On the other hand, Leng Yuran and the others were confident in Yang Ye as well because the strength Yang Ye revealed all along the way had convinced them!

It didn’t take long for many to walk over to stand behind Yang Ye.

While Yang Ye seemed ruthless and cruel, his strength was definitely beyond doubt to them. So, if they wanted to get back to Ocean of Clouds City, then they would undoubtedly have a better chance if they went with him!

In next to no time, over 100 were standing behind Yang Ye, and only a few were left standing in front of him. They were Yu Wushuang, Yu Wujiao, Feng Wuchao, Xia Bingwei, and that sword cultivator from the Ancient Sword School.

“Are all of you sure?” Yang Ye glanced at them as he spoke. While his objective was to save them, he would absolutely not force them to come with him if they didn’t want to.

Feng Wuchao remained silent for a long time, and then he glanced at Xia Bingwei and said, “We’ll go with you!”

They walked over to stand behind Yang Ye while he spoke, and then only Yu Wushuang and her sister remained standing in front of Yang Ye.

“Come over there with me!” Yu Wushuang pulled Yu Wujiao’s hand and intended to walk towards Yang Ye. However, Yu Wujiao pull her hand out of Yu Wushuang’s grasp and said, “If you want to head over, then go there yourself. I can still head back safely even without him!”

Yang Ye suddenly walked over to Yu Wujiao and said, “Do you want a beating?”

Yu Wujiao flipped her palm, and an arm-thick whip appeared in her grasp. She gazed coldly at Yang Ye and said, “Don’t even think that I would lose to you. Do you think you would have succeeded earlier if you hadn’t launched a surprise attack?”

Yu Wushuang took a deep breath, and then she gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Leave her with some dignity, alright?”

“How dare you side with an outsider!” Yu Wujiao was furious.

“You’re the one who’s courting death!” Yu Wushuang paid no further attention to Yu Wujiao after she finished speaking, and she just walked over and stood behind Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at Yu Wujiao and said, “I would really pay no attention to you if it wasn’t for Yu Wushuang.”

As he spoke, Yang Ye took a step forward, and he instantly arrived before Yu Wujiao. Yu Wujiao was astounded, but her reaction wasn’t slow at all, and her whip swept forward. Everywhere it passed, even the space around it rippled, and it was a truly shocking sight.

However, it didn’t take long for her eyes to open wide. It wasn’t just her, even the others in the surroundings had their eyes opened wide.

Their eyes were filled with shock and disbelief.

Because Yu Wujiao’s whip was in Yang Ye’s grasp.

Yang Ye said, “Fight you is actually completely meaningless. Moreover, it even makes me feel sort of embarrassed. Because you’re truly too weak!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye suddenly appeared right before her while his hand clamped down onto her throat. Yu Wujiao’s face instantly turned purple, but Yang Ye immediately released her a moment later and returned to where he stood.

Yang Ye said, “See? I wasn’t lying, right?”

“Who... who exactly are you!?” Yu Wujiao stared fixedly at Yang Ye. This time, she had no desire to fight him anymore. Because the strength of this fellow who stood before her wasn’t something that she could resist at all. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“I want to know who you are as well!” Suddenly, a voice resounded from afar.

The expressions of everyone here changed, and they looked towards the source of the voice. They saw a man who wore a ghost mask had suddenly appeared around 300m away from them, and a few thousand eyes that emanated a dark blue glow could be seen behind the man.

It was a pack of wolves, and all of them were at the Monarch Realm!

Their expressions changed once more when they witnessed this scene.

Yang Ye paid no attention to the masked man, and he looked at Leng Yuran instead, “How far are we from the city?”

Leng Yuran pondered deeply before she said, “It’ll take at least 3 days if we run at full speed!”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Lead them towards the city!”

Leng Yuran spoke softly, “What about you?”

Yang Ye replied, “I’ll catch up very soon!”

Leng Yuran glanced at Yang Ye, and then her figure flashed towards the distance. The others behind Yang Ye hesitated for a moment before quickly following her.

They were very well aware that if they were to stay, then besides being burdens, they would be of no help at all!

“None of you is leaving!” As soon as the man spoke, the sound of footsteps rumbled through the forest in front of Leng Yuran and the others, and then countless huge wolves leaped out from within it.

There were over a thousand of them, and they were all at the Monarch Realm. Moreover, the one who led the group was no unfamiliar face to them because it was that Half-Saint Realm demon beast that fought Li Maozhen and Yu Wujiao earlier!

“It’s truly a waste of time to look for all of you, one by one. Now that all of you’ve converged together, I can save quite a bit of effort!” That Half-Saint Realm demon beast laughed coldly.

“Is that so?” Yang Ye’s voice suddenly resounded, and he’d appeared before that Half-Saint Realm demon beast. At the same time, the Herculean Sword smashed down like a mountain towards the demon beast.

The demon beast’s face turned grim when he sensed the terrifying force contained within the Herculean Sword. However, he was utterly incapable of dodging because Yang Ye was truly too quick. So, he had no choice but to clench his fists tightly and smash them against the Herculean Sword!

Bang!

A huge explosion resounded as the Half-Saint demon beast’s arms were blasted into pieces.

The demon beast was horrified, and his figure shot over 1km backwards!

“Kill!” Meanwhile, the masked man’s voice suddenly resounded.

Aowu!

Countless wolves howled in unison before they pounced madly at Yang Ye’s group!

How terrifying was it to be attacked by thousands of Monarch Realm demon beasts?

All of them here were extraordinary geniuses, and practically every single one of them could surmount their realms of cultivation to do battle. But at this moment, a wave of powerlessness had swept through their hearts because the gap between their strengths was too huge!

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared before them and said, “Follow me and kill our way out!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the Herculean Sword spun as it left his grasp.

Bang!

A few dozen Monarch Realm demon beasts in the lead were instantly transformed into mush!

The intent to fight instantly blazed in the hearts of the others when they witnessed this scene!

“Kill!” All of them quickly followed behind Yang Ye and executed their strongest attacks.

Just like that, they charged and killed their way towards the city under Yang Ye’s lead!

While they crushed through all obstacles before them, the situation they were in was constantly deteriorating. Because more and more packs of wolves were arriving from the surroundings. Moreover, more and more Half-Saint demon beasts were arriving as well. While Yang Ye dealt with all the Half-Saints, some had still started to lose their lives....

“Everyone stay close together! Don’t allow yourselves to get separated! Work together and follow Ye Yang!” Yu Wushuang’s voice resounded amidst the group.

All of them quickly moved closed together, and the group of over a hundred instantly formed into the shape of a coiled rope.

It didn’t take long for them to charge out of the forest and arrive at a plain. However, their footsteps instantly slowed down upon arriving at the plain, and both the battle intent and hope in their eyes had vanished. Only despair could be seen in their eyes!

Because there was an endless ocean of demon beasts standing just over 1km away from them!

There were tens of thousands of them, and most of them were at the Exalt Realm and Monarch Realm.

A wisp of ferocity flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes when he witnessed this scene, “Don’t stop! Charge!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye stomped his right foot against the ground and relied on the counterforce to leap up. At the same time, over a hundred rays of light surged out from within him!

Sword energy shot into the sky, and then the entire sky seemed like it was about to be torn apart!
