Chapter 1571 - The Martial Tomb!

Translator: InVader

They wanted the Sprite Lord!

Yang Ye knew that Sprite Palace would definitely obtain news about Snowy.

But would he hand Snowy over to them?

The answer was a definite no!

Ding Shaoyao rolled her eyes at him, “The Sprite Palace isn’t the Divine Phoenix Clan. It’s one of the strongest powers that are out in the open on the continent.”

“I know!” Yang Ye continued, “But I won’t hand Snowy over.”

Ding Shaoyao thought for a moment and said, “Then just ignore them. We won’t agree nor disagree, and we’ll just keep them waiting.”

Yang Ye nodded. It was the best choice for him. Presently, he didn’t want to become enemies with the Sprite Palace. After all, he wasn’t able to use the Stellar Sword Diagram or the Divine Ying Flame again.

Yang Ye just stayed in his cultivation room throughout the next few days.

Cultivating!

Even though the large world wasn’t filled with Rebirth Realm experts to the point that they could be seen everywhere, there were numerous experts here. He was only equivalent to a single Rebirth Realm expert while he didn’t have the Divine Yin Flame and Stellar Sword Diagram to help him. Perhaps he could still kill a Rebirth Realm expert on his own in single combat, and even two may be possible, but he was absolutely incapable of fighting three Rebirth Realm experts.

If he faced the joint forces of three Rebirth Realm experts, then all he could do was flee!

He intended to cultivate the Sword of Rebirth!

The Sword of Rebirth was stronger than the Rebirth Sword. He hadn’t cultivated it in the past because of the requirements it had in terms of sword intent. His sword intent wasn’t at the Returnal Rank, so he couldn’t cultivate it. While his sword intent still wasn’t at the Returnal Rank, he could use the Sword God’s Seal to improve it to the Returnal Rank before he started cultivating!

Actually, he’d thought of this method in the past, but he’d abandoned the thought because the backlash from his sword intent was too painful. Yet now, he was used to the pain from the backlash and coupled with the extremely dangerous situation he was in, Yang Ye had decided to cultivate the Sword of Rebirth!

In the cultivation room.

“It’s best that you don’t cultivate that technique!” Yang Ye was about to cultivate the Sword of Rebirth when Little Sky suddenly appeared by his side and spoke softly.

Yang Ye gazed at her with a puzzled expression, “Why?”

She shook her head, “That sword technique destroys others’ chances at being reborn. It harms the balance of the world. Regardless of how terrible the enmity between two people is, it should be put an end to in this lifetime. But your technique destroys a person’s next lifetime. It goes too far.”

Yang Ye walked over her and spoke seriously, “Little Sky, if my enemies like the Emperor Sect or War Pavilion have a chance to kill me and destroy my path of rebirth, do you think they’ll do it?”

Little Sky fell silent.

Yang Ye said, “Little Sky, it’s a very realistic and cruel world out there. Being kind to your enemy is being cruel to yourself.”

Little Sky shook her head and didn’t speak further.

Yang Ye added, “Where there are people, there are interests to protect and improve, so there is battle. It’s very normal for people to fight to the death. Little Sky, I think that you should stop being concerned about so many things. Don’t live such a tiring life.”

Little Sky remained silent for a long time, and then she said, “A very, very long time ago, the world outside was just like the world in here. Yet now…” She shook her head and left the room.

A very, very long time ago! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He pondered deeply for a long time, and then he shook his head, restrained his thoughts, and continued his cultivation.

The Sword of Rebirth stressed upon the fusion of mind, sword intent, and soul. The Sword of Rebirth used intent as speed, the body as the sword, the soul as the support, and the eyes as the blade. Simply speaking, the Sword of Rebirth treated its user as the sword.

It needed no sword!

The user was the sword!

The body was used as the sword, so the user was the sword. The soul was used as support, so the user’s soul was treated as the soul of the sword. The user’s intent was used as speed, so it represented that its speed didn’t rely on profound energy or other forms of energy but the intent of the user. It struck where the user’s mind could reach. It was very similar to the Sword of Element that he once used in the past. Of course, it couldn’t compare to the Sword of Rebirth.

Most importantly, it required Returnal Rank sword intent! Returnal Rank sword intent was its foundation! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Needless to say, up until this point in his path of cultivation, the Sword of Rebirth was the most difficult technique he’d encountered.

He’d spend almost 10 days before he finally got a slight grasp of the Sword of Rebirth, and he encountered numerous problems as he continued its cultivation.

In the next three months within the Primordial Pagoda, besides cultivating the Sword of Rebirth like a madman, Yang Ye would put aside a certain amount of time to play with Snowy and Little Sky. As expected, Snowy really liked Little Sky as well, and Little Sky really liked Snowy too. Something worth mentioning was that Little Sky Flame was quite afraid of Snowy.

The Sprite Lord!

As a Sprite Lord, Snowy was a huge threat to a Sprite King like Little Sky Flame. Fortunately, Snowy didn’t absorb her energy as she pleased because Little Sky Flame was on Yang Ye’s side as well.

Just like that, Snowy gradually overcame the trauma she’d suffered with the help of Little Sky and Little Sky Flame’s company. Presently, she was enjoying herself every day.

As for Yang Ye, his diligent cultivation was helping him become more and more skilled at the Sword of Rebirth, but he wasn’t skilled enough to use it in battle yet. Presently, he was only barely able to execute it, but its strength was far inferior when compared to the strength the Sword of Rebirth was described to possess. The main reason was that he hadn’t fully grasped it!

He had to continue his training!

Just like that, two more months went by.

In the world on the 1st level, Yang Ye stood on a rock, and a boundless ocean stretched out before him.

After staying silent on the rock for a long time, Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes.

Om!

At the instant his eyes were opened, a sword howl shot up into the clouds!

A moment later, a ray of light flashed, and then Yang Ye appeared around 500km away.

A moment of silence ensued, and then the ocean was suddenly split open at the center. The rift grew larger and larger while water surged incessantly in opposite directions. The ocean water gradually overlapped and formed huge waves that stretched extremely high into the air. As for the rift itself, it was around 300m wide!

There was a wisp of excitement in Yang Ye’s eyes as he gazed at the scene before him.

The Sword of Rebirth’s strength had far surpassed his expectations. Especially its speed. It could be said that if he wanted to kill someone now, he merely had to confirm the person’s position, and then he could instantly kill that person from 500km away! He was absolutely capable of killing someone from 500km away!

The only depressing part about it was that it exhausted too much profound energy.

That attack had exhausted all his profound energy, including the profound energy within the Worldmend Stone. Moreover, even then, he still felt like it wasn’t enough. It could be said that if he had more profound energy, then it would have been even stronger, gone even further, and shot forward even faster!

Actually, it was normal. After all, the sword cultivator who created the Sword of Rebirth had been at the Dualism Realm, and that sword cultivator had created it based on his or her strength at that time. But Yang Ye was just a Deity, so he definitely lacked sufficient profound energy to fully execute that technique.

Fortunately, he had eight Energy Pearls, and it represented that he could execute the Sword of Rebirth eight times in a short period!

In short, he had another trump card to protect himself with!

Yang Ye suddenly looked up into the air, and then he vanished on the spot.

In the outside world.

Yang Ye gazed at Ding Shaoyao and hurriedly asked, “Do you have news of Zi’er?”

Ding Shaoyao shook her head, “There has been no news of Zi’er. However, I obtained two other pieces of news. The Sword God's Pavilion and Sprite Palace are looking for you, and they’ve summoned you to their headquarters.”

“The Sword God's Pavilion and Sprite Palace?” Yang Ye frowned, “When did the Sword God's Pavilion join forces with the Sprite Palace?”

Ding Shaoyao replied, “You have things that both of them need.”

Yang Ye immediately came to an understanding. The Sword God's Pavilion was naturally looking for him because of the Sword God’s Seal and Stellar Sword Diagram. They both belonged to Jian Wuji, and the Sword God's Pavilion was created by Jian Wuji. He could imagine that the Sword God's Pavilion definitely felt that both the Sword God’s Seal and Stellar Sword Diagram should belong to the Sword God's Pavilion.

As for the Sprite Palace, their objective was even more obvious. It was clearly Snowy!

Ding Shaoyao suddenly said, “I think you should make the trip!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She explained in a low voice, “If you go by yourself, they wouldn’t dare to do anything to you no matter what. The reason I think you should go is because you can try to discuss the matter with them. Their objective is Snowy, the Sword God’s Seal, and the Stellar Sword Diagram. But you can think about it from a different perspective. There’s a connection between you because of the Sword God’s Seal, Stellar Sword Diagram, and Snowy. So, you can try to talk with them. Otherwise, if you ignore them over long periods of time, I’m afraid that the power who’s pulling the strings from the shadows may use the opportunity to pull the Sprite Palace and Sword God's Pavilion over to their side and join forces against you!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded, “Alright!”

Meanwhile, Ding Shaoyao said, “You have one other objective, and it’s to see if they are puppets for that power as well. If they are…”

Ding Shaoyao took a deep breath while a solemn expression filled her eyes, “If they are, then that power that’s acting from the shadows is really too terrifying!”

Yang Ye nodded. The Sprite Palace was filled with sprites, and it didn’t participate in the battles of the mortal world. However, if the Sprite Palace was a puppet for that power as well, then it would truly be terrifying!

Meanwhile, Ding Shaoyao suddenly said, “Right, I’ve found An Nanjing!”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “Where is she?”

“The Martial Tomb.” Ding Shaoyao spoke solemnly, “She’s at the Martial Tomb. The Martial Tomb is a secret realm in the large world, and it’s where a Martial God of the past fell. The Martial God’s spirit resides there, so even Rebirth Realm experts dare not enter it rashly. I’ve sent people to wait outside the Martial Tomb. They’ll tell her to rush over here immediately if she shows herself.”

Yang Ye nodded and heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. All that mattered to him was that An Nanjing was fine and well!

Yang Ye didn’t stay a moment longer. He bade farewell to An Nanjing, and then snuck out of Oblivion Boundary City and departed for Sword God's Pavilion.

What was he the least afraid of in this world?

Sword cultivators!

He was the least afraid of sword cultivators!
