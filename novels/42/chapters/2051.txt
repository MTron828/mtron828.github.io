Chapter 2052 – Martial Emperor Academy!

It doesn’t even fear a progenitor?

This time, Yang Ye was really shocked. Because he was standing before the Weapon Progenitor, but the evil treasure wasn’t afraid at all!

In an instant, Yang Ye felt that he was in deep trouble.

The surroundings fell silent.

The blood red face laughed coldly behind Yang Ye, and it was quite horrifying.

Suddenly, the Weapon Progenitor waves his right hand.

Bang!

An explosion resounded behind Yang Ye, and then the blood red face warped with pain. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Yang Ye was overjoyed when he saw the Weapon Progenitor act against it, but the Weapon Progenitor suddenly stopped.

The Weapon Progenitor spoke indifferently, “Don’t think that no one in this world dares to kill you just because of your slightly special identity. Not to mention something like you, even the heavens won’t survive if it courts death.”

The blood red face spoke ferociously, “Old man, we have a long time ahead of us!”

It vanished once it finished speaking.

However, Yang Ye could sense that it wasn’t gone at all, and it was hiding behind him, just like it always was.

Yang Ye gazed at the Weapon Progenitor and laughed bitterly, “What is that thing? Even you can’t do anything about it?”

The Weapon Progenitor fell silent for a short while before he said, “Some things are better left not unknown to you for now. You just have to remember that while it’s difficult to deal with, you’re not ordinary either. So, you don’t have to fear it. I’m sure that it’ll fall into its own trap soon enough!”

Yang Ye rolled his eyes. He was just beating around the bush and didn’t explain anything!

Meanwhile, the Weapon Progenitor suddenly said, “The Weapon Path needs peace. Not just the two of you, but the other lines as well. Good luck!”

He vanished once he finished speaking.

Meanwhile, the scene before them started to change, and they were on the peak of Prediction Mountain just 15 minutes later.

At this moment, there wasn’t anyone here.

Zhong Ye said, “Go to Martial Emperor Academy. No one from the Weapon Path will look for trouble with you for now. Once you get to Martial Emperor Academy, it’s best if you keep a low profile. People who are arrogant there are usually the first to vanish. We should be arrogant when we should, but we also should stay humble when we should!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand.”

Zhong Ye, “Once you join Martial Emperor Academy, other powers won’t be able to interfere. So, if you die, we can only bury you. Remember that you only have two goals. The Originite and see if you’re able to gain a position in the academy.”

He patted Yang Ye on the shoulder, “Be careful!”

Zhong Ye vanished once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye frowned. His intuition told him that Martial Emperor Academy wasn’t a good place at all!

However, he didn’t have much choice. Moreover, he wanted to have a look at that place and the Originite there!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. He was about to leave when he thought of something, and he went to Gracious Mountain.

An old man was sweeping the floor outside the third palace on Gracious Mountain.

It was Elder Yuan.

Yang Ye smiled, “Elder Yuan, sweeping?”

Elder Yuan spoke indifferently, “You think I’m sweeping?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Elder Yuan said, “What, do you need something?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I just wanted to let you know that I’m leaving.”

Elder Yuan asked, “Martial Emperor Academy?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Elder Yuan spoke softly, “Martial Emperor Academy is filled with geniuses. Besides all the races and four top clans, there are some other mysterious races in there. So, be careful.”

Yang Ye replied, “I will. Take care!”

Yang Ye turned around with the intent to leave. However, Elder Yuan suddenly flicked a jade slip over to Yang Ye, “There’s a person called Shen Xiu there.”

Yang Ye gazed at Elder Yuan and waited for more information.

Elder Yuan glanced at Yang Ye, “You’re still not leaving?”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he came to an understanding. He bowed slightly and said, “Take care!”

Yang Ye vanished into the sky once he finished speaking.

Elder Yuan shook his head and smiled, “Martial Emperor Academy… It’s going to be lively once that kid gets there.”

He glanced at the surroundings and continued, “It’ll be soon!”

…

After he left Gracious Mountain, Yang Ye flew out of the Weapon Dimension on his sword.

Once they found out that Yang Ye had left, countless people in the Weapon Dimension heaved sighs of relief. They hadn’t taken Yang Ye seriously in the beginning, but after what had happened, they noticed that they’d far underestimated the new Seal Master of the Slaughter Line!

He was a madman!

As far as they were concerned, Yang Ye and Zhong Ye were madmen who completely ignored the consequences. Now, the madman was gone.

The Weapon Dimension could be in peace once more!

Yang Ye shot through the distant starry sky on his sword.

The Martial Emperor Academy!

Since he arrived in the large universe, Yang Ye noticed that this world was boundless and filled with all sorts of things. All the races, the four top clans, the god race, the prehistoric civilization, and Martial Emperor Academy… The organizations in the large universe had a very complicated relationship, and he, Yang Ye was clearly quite insignificant before them.

Strength!

Powerful strength!

Yang Ye looked into the depths of the universe and resolve gradually appeared in his eyes.

Work hard!

Yang Ye sped up. At the same time, he immersed his consciousness into his body. The golden seal the Weapon Progenitor gave him was in front of him.

It was the true Weapon Seal of the Slaughter Line.

Yang Ye flicked a drop of blood into it, and then it instantly shot into his forehead.

A short while later, some information had appeared in Yang Ye’s mind.

“Imperial Crusher! No rank. An emperor among fist techniques. A single punch can crush the world…”

A long time passed before Yang Ye opened his eyes again.

Imperial Crusher!

He hadn’t expected it to be a fist technique. Currently, all he’d learned were sword techniques. While he did know some fist techniques, they were far from being capable of keeping up with him. So, he never used fist techniques in battle, and he either used sword techniques or just punched!

A fist technique!

Imperial Crusher!

A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth. Just as the Weapon Progenitor had said, it was very suitable for him. However, he didn’t learn it immediately. Because the Prediction Line had delayed him, or it should be said that he may be late!

A day later, Yang Ye finally stopped traveling.

At this moment, he was still in the starry sky, and he saw a city at the end of his field of vision. It stood within the starry sky while a huge blue barrier of light floated above it. Flying swords were swishing through the barrier from time to time!

A solemn expression appeared on Yang Ye’s face when he saw it. Because he noticed that the weakest among those swords was at the Sage Rank!

How rich!

Yang Ye shook his head. If he were being honest, he felt like robbing them.

Yang Ye restrained the unrealistic thoughts in his mind, and then he shot towards the city. When he arrived around 3km away from it, a sword suddenly shot down from the barrier of light above the city. A moment later, it appeared before Yang Ye, and its tip was pointed at Yang Ye’s forehead.

Yang Ye was stunned. Meanwhile, a young man suddenly appeared in front of him. The young man sized up Yang Ye and asked, “May I know who you are?”

Yang Ye flicked a golden invitation to the young man, “The Weapon Path’s Yang Ye. I’m here to report my arrival!”

“The Weapon Path?” The young man was stunned. He asked, “You’re here to join the academy?”

Yang Ye nodded.

A weird expression appeared on the young man’s face, “The opening ceremony is over. Er… you’re late.”

Yang Ye asked, “I can’t go in?”

The young man hesitated for a moment and replied, “Not really. Hmm, wait a minute. Let me ask about it.”

He turned around and left once he finished speaking. As for the sword in front of Yang Ye, it straightened itself and stopped pointing itself at Yang Ye. However, it didn’t leave and just floated there. Obviously, it was watching Yang Ye.

As he gazed at the sword, Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and patted his chest. A moment later, a small head emerged from there.

Snowy blinked, and then glanced at the surroundings. In the end, she gazed at Yang Ye. Yang Ye rubbed her little head and pointed at the sword, “A treasure!”

Snowy glanced at it, and then her eyes lit up slightly. She nodded to indicate that she thought so too.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Trick it. Oh, I mean talk with it, and ask it to come with us. Alright?”

Snowy blinked, gazed at the sword, and then started waving her claws about. A short while passed before the sword trembled in response.

Some time passed before Snowy gazed at Yang Ye, and then she pointed at the white barrier of light in the sky.

Yang Ye glanced at it. The sword meant that it couldn’t leave, and it had to… stay on duty!

That was roughly what it meant!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Then ask it when it isn’t on duty?”

Snowy gazed at the sword and started communicating with it.

Just like that, Yang Ye figured out what the sword was saying after Snowy relayed it to him.

It was free at night!

Yang Ye wanted to say more to it, but a middle aged man suddenly appeared not too far away from Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at the middle aged man, and the latter sized him up and asked, “Why didn’t you come earlier?”

Yang Ye replied, “I was delayed due to certain reasons.”

The middle aged man nodded, “I understand.”

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. So the academy isn’t that difficult to deal with.

Suddenly, the middle aged man added, “Go back to where you came from. If you’re still here 15 minutes from now, the swords will kill you!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
