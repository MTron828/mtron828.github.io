Chapter 1908 – I’ll Rob Them Again!

Bei Cangyue and the others’ faces were quite gloomy.

All of the others behind Bei Cangyue gazed at her. Obviously, they wanted her to decide.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Bei Cangyue walked over to the man and smiled, “I didn’t expect the Devil Saber, Xiu Shanyue, to actually be reduced to a common bandit. It’s truly surprising.”

Xiu Shanyue put his saber against the ground and shot a sideways glance at her, “Let’s be a little straightforward. Will you pay or not?”

A man by Bei Cangyue’s side suddenly said, “Xue Shanyue, stop acting so arrogantly. She’s the daughter of Northern Sky City’s Northern Sky King…”

“The Northern Sky King?” Xiu Shanyue smiled, “If he was here himself, I would turn around and leave right now. Unfortunately, he isn’t. Of course, I have to give the Northern Sky King some face. Alright, Young Miss Bei Cangyue can pay just 8 immortal crystals. I’ve given you a 20% discount. Hahaha!”

Bei Cangyue’s face turned gloomy, and a black glow flickered in her grasp. Suddenly, she turned to look at Yang Ye, and then she said, “I’ll pay if he does!”

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye when they heard her.

Xiu Shanyue and the woman behind him gazed at Yang Ye too.

Yang Ye glanced at Bei Cangyue, and his face was calm. Nansi Yin’s face was extremely gloomy because Bei Cangyue was diverting the problem to them.

It was absolutely cunning and malicious!

Bei Cangyue glanced at them and grinned in silence.

Xiu Shanyue gazed at Yang Ye and Nansi Yin, “So, will you pay?”

Nansi Yin was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly asked, “How many immortal crystals do you have?”

She gazed at Yang Ye and spoke with astonishment, “You really intend to pay?”

Yang Ye asked, “How many?”

She glanced at him and replied, “25. That's all I have.”

Yang Ye stretched out his hand.

She hurriedly shook her head, “They’re extremely difficult to get. Even for me…”

“Consider it as lending them to me!” Yang Ye interrupted her, “I’ll return them to you in a short while!”

Nansi Yin gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before she flicked a spatial ring to him.

Yang Ye didn’t even take a glance at it before flicking it over to Xue Shanyue.

Xiu Shanyue took it, and it had 20 immortal crystals.

A smile curled up on Xiu Shanyue’s lips. He gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Wise men submit to their circumstances. Kid, you have a good future. Hahaha!” His laughter was filled with undisguised ridicule.

“Trash!” Meanwhile, a woman behind Xiu Shanyue spoke abruptly.

Yang Ye closed his eyes and remained silent.

Bei Cangyue gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then she said, “I truly never expected you to not even resist. It’s truly a surprise.”

Yang Ye still remained silent, and Nansi Yin fell silent just like him.

Meanwhile, Xiu Shanyue gazed at Bei Cangyue’s group, “He has paid, so it’s your turn now. Of course, you can attack me. However, if you do, I won’t just ask for payment!”

Bei Cangyue smiled, “I always keep my word.”

She flicked a spatial ring to Xiu Shanyue. It had exactly 50 immortal crystals.

They were paying their way through!

Even though she possessed real authority in Northern Sky City, 50 immortal crystals was an extremely huge amount even for her. However, she had to pay because Xiu Shanyue wasn’t a human cultivator, so he wouldn’t give her or her father any face.

If she refused, then it represented that they would have to fight Xiu Shanyue’s group of two.

Her goal was the Sage Ruins, so she didn’t want to fight someone before getting there and sustain heavy injuries! She hoped Yang Ye and Xiu Shanyue would fight until both were injured so that she could take advantage of them.

However, she hadn’t expected Yang Ye to act in such a cowardly manner.

Even though she’d paid, Bei Cangyue wasn’t someone who was fond of suffering a loss. She glanced at Xiu Shanyue and the woman, and she said, “I’ll leave it with you for now. I’ll come get it very soon!”

Xiu Shanyue looked up at Bei Cangyue and smiled, “I’ll be waiting!”

Bei Cangyue didn’t say another word and intended to leave, but Yang Ye suddenly walked over to Xiu Shanyue.

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye when they noticed this.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive before Xiu Shanyue. He didn’t say a word, and his sword just left its sheath.

A sword howl resounded!

Everyone watched as a ray of sword energy descended towards Xiu Shanyue’s head.

No one had expected Yang Ye to attack abruptly.

It was extremely swift, but Xiu Shanyue clearly had his guard up. So, as soon as Yang Ye attacked, he’d raised his saber above him.

Clang!

A sharp and ear piercing explosion resounded, and it hurt everyone’s ears.

Xiu Shanyue was actually blasted backwards, and as his figure moved back, 10 energy swords suddenly appeared around him and shot towards him.

“Slash!” Meanwhile, Xiu Shanyue’s voice resounded abruptly. A moment later, a ray of saber energy shot out from not too far ahead of Yang Ye, and Yang Ye’s energy swords were instantly slashed into bits.

After that, a ray of cold light flashed above Yang Ye.

His attack had arrived before Yang Ye!

Yang Ye’s expression remained calm as he took a step back, and then everyone’s expressions changed.

The Sword Domain!

As soon as the Sword Domain appeared, Xiu Shanyue’s saber slowed down, and Yang Ye’s sword moved.

Bang!

No one saw it clearly, but Xiu Shanyue instantly appeared 3km away, and there was a long gash on his chest.

Xiu Shanyue looked up at Yang Ye and was about to speak, but Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Xiu Shanyue’s pupils constricted. He grabbed his saber with both hands and swung it forward.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and Xiu Shanyue was blasted back again.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was about to attack again, but the young woman by Xiu Shanyue’s side appeared in front of him, and then a sledgehammer slammed down towards Yang Ye’s head.

However, Yang Ye ignored her. A ray of light flashed beneath his feet, and he appeared before Xiu Shanyue again. After that, 10 rays of light enveloped Xiu Shanyue.

Xiu Shanyue was shocked. He couldn’t be bothered to avoid straining the injury on his chest, and he just grabbed his saber with both hands and swung it!

Bang!

Yang Ye’s sword energy was obliterated, but Xiu Shanyue spat out a mouthful of blood while his figure was blasted away once more!

He hadn’t even stopped himself when Yang Ye appeared in front of him again, and then a sword pressed against the center of his forehead.

The surroundings instantly fell silent.

Three attacks!

Since Yang Ye attacked, he’d only launched three attacks, and he’d defeated Xiu Shanyue who was at the Enlightened Realm!

Bei Cangyue stared at Yang Ye as if she wanted to see through him.

Xiu Shanyue gazed at Yang Ye and asked, “Who are you?”

Yang Ye didn’t answer him. He stretched out his hand, and the three spatial rings on Xiu Shanyue’s hand flew into his grasp.

One of them belonged to Nansi Yin, the other belonged to Bei Cangyue, and the last one was Xiu Shanyue’s.

Yang Ye put them away, withdrew his sword, and walked off towards the distance.

But he hadn’t even taken a few steps before he suddenly stopped. He turned to glance at Bei Cangyue, “Thanks.”

At this moment, Bei Cangyue had an extremely unsightly expression on her face.

Now, she finally understood Yang Ye’s plan. She wasn’t the only one, everyone here had come to an understanding.

Nansi Yin gazed at Bei Cangyue and smiled, “50 immortal crystals. Tsk, tsk. Thank you for being so generous, Young Miss Cangyue. I’ll treat you to a meal another day!”

She hurriedly followed after Yang Ye once she finished speaking.

Bei Cangyue’s face was gloomy, and no one knew what she was thinking.

Meanwhile, Xiu Shanyue’s expression was similarly gloomy to the extreme. Not only had he failed to rob them, he’d been robbed as well. So, he’d felt truly humiliated.

Suddenly, a smile appeared on Bei Cangyue’s face. She gazed at Xiu Shanyue, “I think you won’t want to just forget this, right?”

Xiu Shanyue gazed at her, and she smiled, “The Sage Ruins is extremely dangerous. Young Master Xiu Shanyue, shall we go together?”

Xiu Shanyue naturally understood what she meant. He hesitated for a moment and nodded, “Of course!”

Bei Cangyue’s smile grew even brighter.

…

Meanwhile, Nansi Yin chuckled, “I knew you weren’t someone who cowered that easily!”

Yang Ye withdrew a spatial ring and passed it to her, “Here, it’s what I owe you!”

She took it and said, “Tell me the truth. Did you plan to rob him from the beginning?”

Yang Ye glanced at her, “Am I that kind of person?”

She sized him up seriously and replied, “I think so!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, she hesitated for a moment and said, “I think that they won’t just let the matter rest.”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “So?”

Nansi Yin added, “What will you do if they join forces?”

Yang Ye stopped and looked her in the eyes, “Then I’ll rob them again!”

Nansi Yin was stunned speechless.
