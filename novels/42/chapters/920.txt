Chapter 921 – Even The Heavens Tremble Before My Rage!

Yang Ye and the outer court students appeared within Zuo Xiu and the others’ fields of vision.

“That’s Ye Yang? He doesn’t seem special to me. Let me test his strength!” A student tapped the tip of his foot against the ground and leaped up into the air like an eagle. He roared furiously in midair as he shot down towards Yang Ye like a ray of light.

The man formed a claw with his hand when he was about to arrive before Yang Ye, and then he shouted loudly as he clawed forcefully at Yang Ye’s head.

Hiss!

The sound of air being torn apart resounded incessantly above Yang Ye while a terrifying pressure sprayed down from the man, and it caused the ground beneath Yang Ye’s feet to be blasted into pieces.

Yu Wushuang and the others were forced backwards repeatedly because the pressure the man emanated was truly too powerful, and they only stopped after moving around 30m back.

All of them had solemn expressions on their faces!

Because the strength of this student of the secret court had exceeded their imagination. It felt like no one besides Yang Ye could be a match for him. Of course, it was mainly because their cultivations were low!

Yang Ye’s expression remained the same as he watched the claw descend towards him. He flipped his palm and flicked the Herculean Sword upwards.

Bang!

A muffled explosion resounded along with a howl of pain.

The pressure which came from the man had instantly vanished without a trace, and everyone watched as his figure was blasted flying. Right after that, Yang Ye instantly arrived in the air above the man, and he stomped his foot down against the man’s head.

Bang!

His head exploded apart while his body was smashed against the ground.

Bang!

The ground quaked violently while his figure was instantly transformed into a pile of mush.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s Herculean Sword was stabbed into the ground, and the ground quaked violently once more while numerous arm-thick cracks started spreading swiftly towards the surroundings. Yang Ye raised his head to look at Zuo Xiu and the others who stood on the city walls and said, “Are all of you going to fight me one by one or all together?”

It was silent, absolutely silent!

Zuo Xiu and the others didn’t speak a word, and there was a solemn expression in all their eyes.

After all, his strength was obvious from that.

That student from the secret court was a Half-Saint. While his strength was ranked at the bottom in the secret court, he was still a Half-Saint. However, such a Half-Saint had been killed in an instant!

If they still dared to underestimate Yang Ye now, then they would truly be fools!

Zuo Xiu glanced at Ye Caiying, and his gaze was quite cold. Because that man’s strength wasn’t much weaker than Ye Caiying, but he’d been instantly killed even when he launched the first strike. In other words, Ye Caiying had lied.

Ye Caiying’s face was extremely unsightly. He’d thought that if Yang Ye hadn’t launched a surprise attack against him, then he wouldn’t have been unable to fight back even if he wasn’t a match for Yang Ye. Moreover, he even felt that he might have a chance to turn the situation around. However, the facts before him told him that he wasn’t a match for Yang Ye at all!

Lei Cangxing asked, “Shall we fight him in single combat, or are we ganging up on him?”

Chu Shiyuan said, “Let me give it a try. Don’t fight him in single combat if I lose, just crush him together!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Chu Shiyuan tapped his right foot against the ground and flashed off the city walls. He walked towards Yang Ye as he said, “Needless to say, we really underestimated you quite a bit. But don’t worry, we won’t anymore.”

As he spoke, he glanced at Yu Wushuang and the others, “Our secret court usually doesn’t cause trouble, but once it does, then even the entire academy will tremble before us. From today onwards, the academy will have no outer court for the next 3 years!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a terrifying aura surged out from within him, and it pressed down towards Yang Ye like a myriad of mountains.

“I usually don’t cause trouble, but once I do, even the heavens tremble before me!” Yang Ye walked towards Chu Shiyuan as he continued, “From today onwards, the secret court can be removed from the academy for the next 3 years!”

As soon as he finished speaking, 3rd level Heaven Rank sword intent swept out from him, and Chu Shiyuan’s aura was instantly dispersed.

3rd level Heaven Rank sword intent! Chu Shiyuan’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he didn’t dare act carelessly. He withdrew an axe and was about to attack when Yang Ye’s figure moved.

Yang Ye immediately utilized the Laws of Speed. But this time, his speed was strangely quite slow, and it was even slower than when he didn’t utilize the Laws of Speed.

Yang Ye stopped on the spot, glanced at the surroundings, and said, “There are even formations to counter my Laws. Needless to say, this formation isn’t bad.”

“I’ll soon allow you to realize that it isn’t just our formations that are not bad!” As soon as Chu Shiyuan finished speaking, he swung his axe at Yang Ye, and a ray of light shot out from its blade and instantly arrived before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye held the Herculean Sword in his hand and was about to swing it. However, he noticed that the Herculean Sword was many times heavier than before. Moreover, his body felt like it was beneath a mountain. He could move, but it was extremely slow. So, Chu Shiyuan’s attack had struck directly against his chest!

Bang!

An explosion resounded. However, Yang Ye didn’t move at all, and there were no signs of injury on him.

The expressions of Zuo Xiu and the others changed in unison upon witnessing this scene. Obviously, they hadn’t imagined that Yang Ye’s body would have been strong to such an extent! As for Chu Shiyuan, he had an extremely solemn expression on his face!

Yang Ye paid no attention to Chu Shiyuan, and he just ceaselessly sized up the surroundings with the hope of locating the core of the formation so that he could destroy it. At this moment, he understood why just around 30 of them could defend the northern gates. It was because of such formations. Because it would be amazing for someone to even bring forth 20% or 30% of that person’s usual strength while enveloped by such a formation.

However, Yang Ye was disappointed. Besides being able to sense the effects of the formation, he wasn’t able to notice any signs of the formation. Since he couldn’t notice it, he couldn’t undo it.

Yang Ye’s brows knit together slightly. He didn’t really care about the formation, but it allowed him to understand that even the energy of the Laws could be countered!

However, it made sense to him. After all, everything in the world countered each other. So, it wasn’t surprising that the Laws could be countered as well.

“If you’re thinking of breaking the formation, then you can just save your energy!” Meanwhile, Zuo Xiu led the other students off the city walls and arrived by Chu Shiyuan’s side, “This formation is an advanced formation that the Dean brought back from the Central Divine Prefecture. If it was set up by the Dean and the others, then it can even suppress Saints. Even though the formation we’ve set up is inferior to theirs, it isn’t something that a tiny little Monarch Realm cultivator like you can destroy!”

Chu Shiyuan gazed at Zuo Xiu, “Let me do it myself!”

Zuo Xiu shook his head, “His accomplishments in the Sword Dao are formidable, his body is comparable to a demon beast at the high rank of the Half-Saint Realm, and he even possesses the Laws of Speed. You wouldn’t be able to do anything to him even if you have the formation to suppress him, and you might even be killed instead.”

Chu Shiyuan spoke in a low voice, “Are you looking down on me?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Zuo Xiu glanced at him and said, “If you chose to fight him in a fair fight, then I’d immediately allow a one on one battle between both of you. Since this battle isn’t fair, then just let it be utterly unfair. Otherwise, it’s meaningless even if you win. Because you aren’t a match for him without the formation to suppress him!”

Chu Shiyuan spoke fiercely, “Remove the formation and let me fight him on my own!”

Zuo Xiu glanced indifferently at Chu Shiyuan and said, “If he isn’t suppressed by the formation, then he’ll be able to instantly kill you with the Laws of Speed. It won’t just be you; he’ll even be able to instantly annihilate many of us before we can do anything.”

When he spoke up to this point, Zuo Xiu’s face turned gloomy, “Gu Qianfan gave me full authority and responsibility over the secret court when he went into closed door cultivation. Don’t blame me for being merciless if you refuse to obey my orders.”

Chu Shiyuan’s face turned cold, and he was about to speak when Lei Cangxing spoke abruptly, “Alright, we’ll deal with our internal disagreements later. Now, let’s deal with this instructor of the outer court and those little bastards from the outer court first!”

Ye Caiying spoke abruptly, “Those girls from the outer court are pretty good looking!”

“Indeed. Hehehe....” That fellow called Gongsun gazed at Li Qingyi and the others, “Big Brother Zuo Xiu, can we keep those women alive later? Let’s have fun with them before we kill them. Otherwise, it would truly be a waste. Hehehe....”

Lei Cangxing glanced at Yu Wushuang and the others, and then he spoke flatly, “Since they’ve chosen to treat us as enemies, then we don’t have to treat them as fellow students.” When he spoke up to this point, a slightly evil smile curled up on the corners of his mouth, “So, we’ll keep them alive for a while so that we can teach them how to be proper women!”

“That’s a good idea!” Chu Shiyuan added.

Zuo Xiu glanced at Li Qingyi and the others, “Then keep them alive!”

The other students of the secret court instantly started chuckling when they heard this.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye spoke abruptly, “Are all of you done?”

Zuo Xiu’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye while ridicule covered the corners of his mouth, “I know you’re strong, and perhaps even I’m no match for you in a one on one battle. But so what? With the Delay Formation and Gravity Formation here, not to mention you, even 10 of you would still be at our mercy. But don’t worry, I won’t let you die so quickly. I’ll allow you to watch what happens to those female students, and then we’ll kill you slowly!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he glanced at all of them before he said, “So your confidence comes from this formation. It’s truly laughable... and said!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye took a step forward.

Bang!

A huge explosion resounded, and then countless strands of energy appeared out of thin air and enveloped them like a white mist!

The formation was destroyed!

Zuo Xiu and the others were stunned on the spot!
