Chapter 975 – To Kill A Saint!

Yang Ye had challenged the Dao Order that day and caused its reputation to be completely destroyed. That was an extraordinary insult to the Dao Order. Even though its founding ancestor had stepped forward and ordered them not to seek revenge from Yang Ye, but it was truly impossible for the members of the Dao Order and especially Saints like him to swallow such an insult.

However, no matter how difficult it was, they had to accept it because it was an order from their founding ancestor.

Yet now, Yang Ye had mentioned that incident before him. That was no different than tearing open his wounds. So, Zhu Yuan’s face had instantly turned gloomy, and the atmosphere in the room tensed up as Zhu Yuan’s face grew gloomier.

Yang Ye paid no attention to Zhu Yuan’s gloomy expression, and he just disregarded Zhu Yuan and said, “If you’re still here 10 breaths from now, then I’ll travel to the Dao Order tomorrow and challenge all of its geniuses until none remain!”

Zhu Yuan spoke fiercely, “Perhaps you won’t even have the chance!”

Yang Ye said, “Do you want to give it a try?”

Zhu Yuan was about to say something, but Yu Wushuang suddenly spoke before him, “Senior Zhu Yuan, Yang Ye has no ill intent. Perhaps he’s able to heal Wan’er, but it isn’t suitable for us to stay here, and that’s why he has asked us to leave.”

“Heal her?” Zhu Yuan laughed coldly, “Her meridians and bones are shattered, and all her internal organs are severely damaged. Coupled with the shattered state of her Dantian, only a natural herb that transcends the Divine Rank is capable of saving her life. But what’s the point of saving her life? Her Dantian is shattered, so she’ll only be a cripple in life.”

Yang Ye’s face instantly became vicious. Meanwhile, Yu Wushuang suddenly took his hand and stopped him from possibly acting impulsively. She gazed at Zhu Yuan and said, “Senior, you should be clearly aware of his character. He isn’t someone who cares about the overall situation. If you continue wasting time here, then I can guarantee that your Dao Order will suffer even more horribly than the last time. As for whether the Ancient Sword School would protect him.... Heh, Lu Wan’er is already in such a state, so he’s its one and only hope. Do you think the Ancient Sword School would protect him or consider the current situation if he intends to take revenge on your Dao Order!?”

Zhu Yuan gazed at Yu Wushuang for a short while, and then he laughed coldly and walked towards the door. However, he stopped when he arrived before the door and said, “Yang Ye, what goes around comes around. You humiliated my Dao Order that day, and your retribution came today. Indeed, I could have stopped them from taking that little girl, and I could have stopped Li Yun. But I didn’t. Why? Because I wanted to see the miserable fate that awaited you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Zhu Yuan roared with laughter as he vanished from the room.

Yang Ye looked in the direction of the door for quite some time, and then he withdrew his gaze and looked at Lu Wan’er who laid there on the bed, “Both of you can leave for now!”

Yu Wushuang and Shang Qingying nodded and left.

Once she left the room, Yu Wushuang immediately said, “Notify the Ancient Sword School that Yang Ye and Lu Wan’er are in danger, and they should rush over no matter what!”

Shang Qingying was shocked, “You think Senior Zhu Yuan would act against them?”

“He naturally wouldn’t do it openly!” Yu Wushuang continued, “He isn’t that foolish. If he does it in the open, then he’ll definitely die even if he’s a Saint. But while he can’t do it openly, he can do it in secret. Just like what happened this time. He only had to do nothing, and both Yang Ye and Lu Wan’er almost died!”

Shang Qingying pondered deeply for a long time before she nodded.

Yu Wushuang looked up into the sky, and there was deep worry in her eyes, “The human race is in such a worrying state....”

...

In the room.

Yang Ye removed all of Lu Wan’er’s clothes. At this moment, she could be said to be severely injured to the extreme, and even he wouldn’t be confident of his ability to heal her if he didn’t possess such heaven defying profound energy like Primordial Violet Energy. Lu Wan’er’s entire body was severely damaged from inside out, and it was especially so for her internal organs. Her internal organs were gradually starting to fail.

This was why he wanted everyone to leave the room just now. Because the situation was urgent, and he didn’t want to waste any time!

Yang Ye summoned the white little fellow. She’d actually been sleeping, so she glared resentfully at him after being shaken awake.

Yang Ye rubbed her head and said, “Snowy, help me absorb spirit energy!” The violet mink had suggested to name the white little fellow Snowy because she was completely snow white.

Snowy’s eyes lit up when she heard him tell her to absorb spirit energy, and she quickly nodded.

“Don’t do it too quickly. Just absorb enough for me to use!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye placed his palms on Lu Wan’er’s stomach, and the tiny vortex within him started to revolve. After that, threads of Primordial Violet Energy started to seep out of the tiny vortex, flow through his meridians, and surge into Lu Wan’er. Even though the tiny vortex hadn’t returned to normal, they’d built a certain level of tacit understanding between each other.

It could be said that the tiny vortex wasn’t like it had been in the past. It didn’t only provide him Primordial Violet Energy when he asked for it or forced it to. Now, it would give him Primordial Violet Energy whenever he needed it.

Meanwhile, Snowy started to absorb spirit energy. The spirit energy in the surroundings surged swiftly in Yang Ye’s direction before entering the tiny vortex. After that, they were converted into Primordial Violet Energy before finally being transferred through Yang Ye into Lu Wan’er’s body.

Lu Wan’er’s injuries gradually showed signs of turning for the better under the ceaseless restorative effects provided by Yang Ye’s Primordial Violet Energy. The external injuries she suffered started to form scabs, shed off, and grow new skin. Besides that, the broken bones and meridians within her were being gradually healed. While it was a slow process, they were being healed!

The worry and anxiety in Yang Ye’s heart was finally relieved when he witnessed this scene.

Time trickled by.

Two hours later, Lu Wan’er’s external appearance had returned to normal, and her bare body had appeared before Yang Ye’s vision. There wasn’t even a speck of lust in his eyes, and there was only relief there.

If anything were to have happened to Lu Wan’er, then it would be a blade that rested eternally in his heart. Or it should be said that he would never be able to forgive himself! Fortunately, he was in time to turn the situation around.

One day later, Lu Wan’er’s body had fully returned to normal. However, perhaps it was because of the Primordial Violet Energy, but her newly grown skin caused her jade white and delicate figure to carry a slight violet hue. Besides that, her internal injuries had healed very quickly as well. Both her meridians and bones were almost completely restored, and only her Dantian remained.

As soon as she regained consciousness, the first thing Lu Wan’er asked about was her Dantian.

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a long time before he replied, “I don’t know. I’ve never tried to in the past!”

“I hope it’s possible!” She said, “Or I’ll be a cripple from now on!”

“Even if you become a cripple, you’ll still have me!” Yang Ye continued, “I won’t allow anything to happen to you while I’m alive!”

Lu Wan’er gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before she said, “Are you feeling pity for me, or are you feeling guilty?”

Yang Ye replied, “What do you think?”

She answered, “I don’t know. That’s why I asked.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time before he spoke, “Wan’er, you said that I was a coward when it came to my feelings. Because I always avoid them. But do you know that I don’t avoid it because I’m a coward? It’s because I don’t want the people I love to be hurt. Love is always a selfish thing, and there is no woman who’s willing to share their husband with many others. Understand?”

She said, “But it’s unfair to do that. Because you considered the feelings of one yet hurt another!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Let’s not continue on this topic!”

She asked, “Are you trying to avoid it again?”

Yang Ye’s figure trembled slightly when he heard this, and quite some time passed before he laughed bitterly. He took Lu Wan’er’s hand and said, “Wan’er, you asked if I felt pity or guilt towards you. I’ll give you the answer now. I feel very guilty, but I don’t pity you. Because love shouldn’t be something that’s pities. You know... my heart ached when I saw you like that. It felt like my heart was being sliced apart. Even just a while ago, my heart was in my throat. Because I was afraid.... I was afraid that I would lose you forever!”

Lu Wan’er gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then she suddenly sat up and came close to him, “Your confession is pretty bad, but I like it!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she held his face and kissed him. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he reciprocated. It didn’t take long for his hands to slowly crawl up her back.

Snowy watched this scene with a curious gaze, and then she slowly started to blush.

A long time passed before they split apart, and there was a slight blush on Lu Wan’er’s face.

Yang Ye grinned. He placed her flat on the bed, placed his hands against her stomach, and then allowed his profound energy to surge into her stomach.

Lu Wan’er suddenly said, “You’ve seen me!”

Yang Ye’s figure stiffened slightly, and then he said, “In any case, it’s mine, sooner or later!”

A wisp of embarrassment and anger flashed through her eyes, but there was a smile on her face. Because Yang Ye had finally stopped avoiding her feelings. Most importantly, she understood his feelings for her.

Yang Ye removed his hands after 4 hours passed, and there was a gloomy expression on his face. Because his Primordial Violet Energy hadn’t been able to restore her shattered Dantian!

Lu Wan’er’s face was gloomy as well. If she lost her Dantian, it meant that she would be a cripple. How could she be willing to live such a life?

“There’s definitely a way to restore your Dantian!” Yang Ye consoled her, “The dean is a knowledgeable man, so he’ll definitely know of a way. I’ll go ask him once he’s done fighting Welkin Wolf Demon King!”

Lu Wan’er nodded slightly and remained silent.

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a long time, and then he suddenly waved his right hand. 13 black clothed figures and 4 demon beasts appeared within the room.

Lu Wan’er gazed at Yang Ye with a puzzled expression.

Yang Ye said, “Unless a Saint attacks, no one in the city will be able to harm you while they are by your side!”

“What are you planning to do!?” Lu Wan’er grabbed his hand while an uneasy feeling arose in her heart.

Yang Ye took a deep breath, struggled free from her grasp, and then vanished from the room. At the same time, a voice came in from outside the room, “To kill a Saint!”
