Chapter 1812 – I’m Your Father!

Needless to say, Yang Ye was quite stunned.

However, he still listened to Qiong Qi and immediately entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Even though he was within the Primordial Pagoda, he could still sense everything occurring in the world outside.

There was a towering mountain at the end of Crimson Plains. It extended up into the sky, and even Yang Ye’s field of vision couldn’t see the top of it.

It was Heaven Pillar Mountain that linked the medium universe with the large universe!

At this moment, a huge black dragon was coiled around the mountain. The dragon’s size exceeded Yang Ye’s imagination as just its head was the size of a mountain.

It was the largest living being Yang Ye had ever laid eyes upon in his life!

The dragon coiled around Heaven Pillar Mountain. From Yang Ye’s angle, he had a clear view of a dragon tail stretching towards the end of the mountain.

The black dragon glanced coldly at the surroundings, and everyone it glanced at shuddered with fear.

At this moment, Heaven Pillar Mountain and the Crimson Plains were perfectly silent.

A few breaths of time later, the black dragon frowned while a wisp of bewilderment appeared in its eyes.

It didn’t take long for it to glance at the surroundings again. This time, it glanced very slowly as it seemed to be searching for something.

A few breaths of time passed, and the dragon’s frown grew deeper. A short while later, it shook its head, and then it climbed up towards the top of the mountain, and it only took a while for it to vanish before everyone’s eyes.

Huff!

At this moment, sighs of relief resounded simultaneously throughout Heaven Pillar Mountain and Crimson Plains.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Hou Qing gazed at Yang Ye and said, “That fellow seems to have been looking for you!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Hou Qing suddenly gazed at Qiong Qi, “Why was that fellow looking for this kid?”

Qiong Qi glanced at Hou Qing, “Do you know why it was made to come down here?”

Hou Qing shook his head, “I don’t. But I heard he made a big mistake.”

“That doesn’t even begin to describe it!” Qiong Qi continued, “It was a simply heinous crime. If it hadn’t rendered great service to the Sky Dimension, its head would have been chopped off.”

Hou Qing was quite curious, “What did he do?”

Qiong Qi shook his head, “That fellow is an absolute idiot. He actually helped the Sovereign of Sky’s daughter steal that person’s treasure!”

Hou Qing was stunned, “The original owner of this pagoda?”

The old man in Daoist’s robes!

Qiong Qi nodded.

“Tsk, tsk!” Hou Qing shook his head, “How brave of him!”

“He’s brainless!” Qiong Qi spoke indifferently, “You know… It almost brought a calamity upon the Sky Clan, and it almost caused the death of the Sovereign of Sky’s daughter. I heard the Sovereign of Sky was so furious he almost chopped off that fellow’s head, and if others in the Sky Clan hadn’t begged for mercy for him, his corpse might be rotting by now!”

Hou Qing asked, “That person didn’t pursue the matter?”

Qiong Qi shook his head, “How would he? By attacking the Sky Clan? That’s obviously impossible. Moreover, he’s quite fond of that little girl. So, he just allowed it to pass.”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly asked, “That little girl is Xiao Qi?”

Qiong Qi nodded, “Yes, the number one devil of the Sky Clan!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi added, “Even though he didn’t pursue the matter, how could the Sovereign of Sky not? It almost caused a calamity for the Sky Clan. Even though the Sovereign of Sky didn’t kill that idiot, punishment was unavoidable. So, he was exiled to guard Heaven Pillar Mountain forever.”

Yang Ye came to a complete understanding at this point.

The huge fellow from before definitely knew Xiao Qi, and it was his help that had allowed Xiao Qi to steal the Primordial Pagoda. After that, Xiao Qi fled, and that huge fellow suffered instead.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something. He said, “Wait! The old man in Daoist’s robes is so strong. It’s impossible for that huge fellow to have stolen from him, right?”

Qiong Qi shook his head, “He didn’t keep that treasure by his side and placed it within his Pill Pavilion instead. That little girl always plays in his Pill Pavilion. As for that stupid dragon, she somehow tricked him to use the Torch Dragon’s breath to conceal her aura, and then he went to the top of the Pill Pavilion with her. In short, if it wasn’t for him, that little girl would have been absolutely unable to obtain this treasure.”

Yang Ye asked, “That dragon from before is the Torch Dragon that you told me about in the past?”

Qiong Qi replied, “Presently, there’s only one way for that stupid dragon to gain release, and it’s to find Xiao Qi. Because only Xiao Qi can help him persuade the Sovereign of Sky to show mercy!”

Yang Ye’s eyes lit up, “Xiao Qi is with me! I can take Xiao Qi to him and ask him to crush all these old bastards in Heaven Pillar Mountain!”

As he spoke, Yang Ye was about to leave the Primordial Pagoda, but Qiong Qi suddenly said, “Go to him if you want to die.”

Yang Ye turned to look at Qiong Qi, “What do you mean?”

Qiong Qi replied, “Kid, you have to realize that she’s unconscious right now. If she thinks you caused Xiao Qi to be unconscious, what would you do? Especially when the pagoda is in your possession. I can imagine that he’ll definitely kill you to seize it.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Qiong Qi continued, “Besides that, you must always be wary of others. If he does arouse ill intent towards you because of the pagoda, then no one will be able to save you. I’m not trying to scare you. I’m sure you’re aware how precious this pagoda is. It can be said that no one in the large universe doesn’t want it. So, it’s best if you don’t go to that fellow until Xiao Qi is awake, and you should stay far away instead!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded. Qiong Qi was right, he had to be wary of others. If the dragon aroused any ill intent, he would definitely die. Even though he hadn’t fought the dragon, his intuition told him that he was no match for it.

They weren’t on the same level at all!

Even though it was quite a blow to his confidence, it was a fact!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye gazed at Qiong Qi, “How’s your relationship with him?”

“Don’t even think about it!” Qiong Qi spoke indifferently, “Because I’m not close to him.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Qiong Qi added, “Kid, that Torch Dragon definitely sensed something, and that’s why he showed himself. So, you have to be careful.”

Yang Ye said, “He can’t sense Xiao Qi while she’s within the Primordial Pagoda, right?”

Qiong Qi shook his head, “If I’m not wrong, that fellow sensed Xiao Qi’s aura on you. After all, you frequently come into contact with her. So, you have to conceal your aura when you leave the pagoda!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright!”

Yang Ye didn’t leave the Primordial Pagoda, and he talked with Hou Qing and Qiong Qi for a while instead. Yang Ye gained a rough understanding of the large universe from them. However, when he asked about the old man in Daoist’s robes, both of them refused to say a word.

This made Yang Ye feel quite depressed!

Around two hours later, Yang Ye decided to leave the Primordial Pagoda. Meanwhile, he seemed to have thought of something and gazed at Hou Qing, “Senior, you sealed the wooden sword, so can you unseal it?” The wooden sword was so strong even in a sealed state. So, if it was unsealed, it would be extremely terrifying.

Hou Qing shook his head slightly, “It’s best if you don’t do that!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Hou Qing replied, “Because once it’s unsealed, it’ll be too strong, and you won’t be able to use it. Understand?”

I see! Yang Ye nodded. He didn’t say another word and just left the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he gazed at Heaven Pillar Mountain. He was still extremely far away from the mountain, but he could still see it. Because it was truly too tall.

The large universe was at the end of Heaven Pillar Mountain!

He wanted to go there!

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then he intended to leave. But he suddenly looked towards the right. He seemed to have seen something which made an arc curl up on the corners of his mouth, “I didn’t expect you to be here too!”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Two old men walked through the air extremely far away.

They were True Realm experts that had escaped from the Ying Clan that day.

The old man by Ying Ke’s side spoke abruptly, “Ying Ke, Ancestor Ying Jing’s main body is still in the medium universe, so why didn’t she use her main body? If she did, wouldn’t it have been absolutely easy for her to kill Yang Ye and the others?”

Ying Ke shook his head, “Ancestor Ying Jing definitely has her reasons!”

The old man by Ying Ke’s side spoke solemnly, “I heard Yang Ye is in Heaven Pillar Mountain too.”

Ying Ke grunted coldly, “He’s courting death. Once his presence is exposed, even his father, Yang Wudi, wouldn’t be able to save him.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The old man by Ying Ke’s side shook his head, “It’s all Ying Qing and Ying Yu’s fault. They caused our Ying Clan to fall to such a state just for their own personal interests. They’re sinners of our clans!”

Ying Ke didn’t say a word, but he did agree with the old man.

The main reason the Ying Clan was in this state was Ying Qing’s decision. Ying Qing had chosen to become enemies with Yang Ye. If Ying Qing had been able to kill Yang Ye, then it wouldn’t be a problem. But Ying Qing failed.

A few moments of silence passed before Ying Ke shook his head, “There’s no point in saying more. We have to speed up and get to Divine Ruin City as soon as possible.”

Ghastly killing intent filled his eyes at this point, “I’ve found out that those women who helped Yang Ye are from a power called the Nether Pavilion. At this moment, they’re in Divine Ruin City that’s below Heaven Pillar Mountain.”

The old man by Ying Ke’s side spoke solemnly, “Even though those women are only at the 1st stage of the True Realm, all of them possess extraordinary strength. We’re probably unable to deal with them!”

Ying Ke laughed coldly, “They’re dead this time.”

The old man asked, “Why?”

Ying Ke replied, “Because they’re linked to Yang Ye. Anyone linked to Yang Ye are people that those old geezers in Heaven Pillar Mountain intend to target. Because they’re the only way to force Yang Ye to show himself! I heard that Divine Ruin City’s formation has been activated to trap them in. Presently, only entrance is allowed in Divine Ruin City!”

Ying Ke had a ferocious expression on his face at this point, “If it wasn’t for them, Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang would have never been able to crush our Ying Clan. If they fall into my hands, I’m going to make living worse than death for them!”

Suddenly, they stopped before a man in black robes had appeared not too far away from them.

Ying Ke spoke solemnly, “Who are you?!”

The black robed man replied, “I’m your father!”

Ying Ke was stunned speechless.
