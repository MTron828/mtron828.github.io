Chapter 1357 – It’s Time To Leave!

If Yang Ye’s Sword Domain could cover the universe, then all bodies of energy in the universe could be utilized to form sword energy!

Just thinking about it caused Yang Ye to feel quite excited, but it didn’t take long for him to wake up from that dream.

Cover the entire universe?

His Sword Domain could only cover an area of around 5,000km!

So, covering the entire universe was quite far away from him!

However, Yang Ye was in no rush. He was just an Emperor right now, and his Sword Domain would improve along with his cultivation. So, the day would come when he could accomplish that!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, glanced at the boundless starry sky around him, and then issued a command in his heart. In an instant, everything around him started to become ethereal, and then everything returned to normal while the Stellar Sword Diagram appeared before him.

Yang Ye gazed at the Stellar Sword Diagram, and a smile curled up on the corners of his mouth. The Stellar Sword Diagram was in his possession and the restrictions around Dark Hell Continent was gone, so it was time to leave!

Yang Ye gazed at the Sword Spirit and said, “Let’s go!”

She nodded in reply, and then she transformed into a ray of light that shot into Yang Ye’s chest.

...

Doomsday City. The Sword Hall.

Yang Ye sat at the seat of the host and said, “I’ve decided to move the Sword Alliance’s headquarters to Sword God Island!”

Previously, Blind Maiden hadn’t allowed him to move the Sword Alliance there because the black dragon was in Sword God Ocean. Yet now, Qiong Qi had eaten the black dragon. Since there was no more danger in Sword God Ocean, he naturally intended to move the headquarters to the island. After all, it was more suitable for the Sword Alliance to develop there!

The others naturally didn’t reject Yang Ye’s suggestion.

Yang Ye’s gaze descended upon Yun Banqing, “Banqing, I’ll leave the move to you.”

Yun Banqing glanced at him and spoke softly, “All of you are leaving, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he glanced at the others, “Tell your subordinates Yun Banqing will have full authority over the Sword Alliance on Dark Hell Continent. Her orders are my orders, and no one is to disobey them.”

Even though Ye Liuyun had passed all her authority over to Yun Banqing, he still wanted to personally make it clear. Doing so would allow Yun Banqing’s authority to be further ratified, and only then would her future orders be followed to the letter!

The others hurriedly nodded when they heard him. Yang Ye had made his stand clear, and that represented that when Yang Ye and Ye Liuyun weren’t here, Yun Banqing would have the greatest authority on Dark Hell Continent!

Yang Ye nodded, “Everyone else besides Banqing can leave now.”

It didn’t take long for only Yang Ye, Yun Banqing, and Ye Liuyun to remain here.

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and then 2 Voider Realm Sword Servants appeared before Yun Banqing, “Keep these 2 puppets with you.”

Even though he’d given her authority, her strength was too weak. The experts of the Sword Alliance would naturally not dare to disobey her while he was on Dark Hell Continent, but if he led the others away from the continent, then there might be some who feigned compliance to her.

He didn’t want to see the Sword Alliance in a mess when he returned!

Yun Banqing glanced at the puppets before her and said, “I’ll manage the Sword Alliance well!”

Yang Ye nodded. Meanwhile, she added, “There’s one more thing.”

Yang Ye said, “You’re worried about the demon race, right?”

Yun Banqing nodded. The demon race had returned to the Veiled Region on the Demon Empress’ orders. But once Yang Ye and the others left, how would the Sword Alliance defend itself if the demon race attacked again?

Yang Ye said, “Don’t worry, I’ll deal with it!”

She nodded. Since Yang Ye said that he would, then she naturally had no need to worry. She hesitated for a moment and said, “When will all of you return?”

Ye Liuyun gazed at Yang Ye as well because she wanted to know the answer too.

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t know. But don’t worry, we will definitely come back. Our Sword Alliance’s headquarters will be here. Regardless of how well or terribly it goes in the outside world, we’ll still return.”

If he was all alone, he would definitely not develop any power. After all, it was so free to be just alone with his sword! However, he wasn’t alone, and he had many to protect. So, he naturally had to continue developing the Sword Alliance. He pursued strength to protect the people dearest to him and developing a power like the Sword Alliance was a type of strength as well!

Yun Banqing nodded slightly, “So long as you do return....”

Yang Ye smiled, “Both of you go deal with the matters before our departure. I’ll head to the Veiled Region.”

Ye Liuyun asked, “Should I ask the Lin Clan’s patriarch and the others to go with you?”

“I alone am enough!” As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of light that vanished outside the hall.

Ye Liuyun suddenly asked once Yang Ye left, “Do you regret it?”

Yun Banqing replied, “Regret what?”

Ye Liuyun said, “You know what I mean!”

Yun Banqing remained silent for a short while, and then she said, “He has always been helping me, so I want to help him too. Isn’t this a good opportunity to do that?”

As soon as she finished speaking, she turned to look at Ye Liuyun and continued, “He’s quite a lazy fellow. So, you’ll be really busy by his side.”

Ye Liuyun replied, “Actually, that’s exactly why he’s taking me with him!”

Both of them exchanged glances and smiled.

...

Once he left Doomsday City, Yang Ye flew on his sword towards the Veiled Region. The demon race was a really huge problem indeed, and he didn’t dare to leave Dark Hell Continent without resolving it. But he didn’t want to use force to resolve the problem. Of course, he didn’t mind doing so if he had no other choice!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive before the teleportation formation to the Veiled Region, and then he stepped into it.

Yang Ye frowned once he stepped into the circle of light. Because the teleportation formation was actually sealed. He knew that the demon beasts had obeyed the Demon Empress’ orders and closed the teleportation formation into the Veiled Region.

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time before the Sword God’s Seal lit up on his forehead. After that, he stretched his right hand forward, and it didn’t take long for 10 seemingly material intent swords to appear here. Yang Ye gazed at them for a short while, and then he vanished on the spot. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He’d naturally left those intent swords behind as a defense against the demon race. Based on his current strength, those 10 intent swords could kill quite a few Voider Realm demon beasts. There were very few Voider Realm demon beasts and coupled with the losses they’d sustained during the war with the human race, it could be said that the demon race couldn’t afford to suffer any losses now!

Even if it wanted to take revenge, it would be something extremely far in the future.

Moreover, they were like a signal for him. If the demon race really did intend to leave the Veiled Region, it would definitely have to destroy his intent swords. But once that happened, he would notice right away.

But he felt that the demon race probably had no intention to take revenge right now. Now that it had lost the Demon Empress, it might fall into a state of internal strife.

Yang Ye had no choice but to admit that admired the Demon Empress. If Nie Wuming hadn’t arrived abruptly, then the Sword Alliance would have been in a very worrying situation!

Yang Ye shook his head, restrained his thoughts, and then vanished into the sky.

...

At the entrance of the Veiled Region.

“He’s gone!”

“Are you sure?”

“I am!”

“Huff! Luckily. Notify the various patriarchs.”

“Who do you think will become the new Demon King?”

“Who knows.... I heard that none of the patriarchs are convinced of the others’ strength....”

“Alas, if only the Demon Empress was still alive. Our demon race wouldn’t have fallen into such a state....”

...

After he left, Yang Ye went to Sword God Island. He hadn’t forgotten that Sword God Island had some current residents. If he were to move the Sword Alliance to Sword God Island, then he had to resolve all issues with them. Especially the Ten Thousand Legged Centipede.

Two hours later, Yang Ye arrived on Sword God Island.

Yang Ye went straight to the centipede’s home. Yang Ye had just arrived there when the centipede flashed out from within the mountain, and he had an extremely solemn and fearful expression on his face when he saw Yang Ye.

He’d watched the battle between Yang Ye’s group and Jian Xu’s group. He knew that Yang Ye wasn’t someone he could fight anymore.

Yang Ye got straight to the point, “My forces will be moving to Sword God Island. You don’t have to leave, but you’re prohibited from acting against them.”

The Ten Thousand Legged Centipede spoke in a low voice, “What if I refuse?”

Yang Ye replied, “Then you’ll die right now!”

The centipede’s eyelids twitched, and then he glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Alright, I agree.”

Yang Ye took a deep and long glance at the centipede. The centipede hurriedly said, “Human, since I’ve agreed, I will definitely do as I’ve said. So long as they don’t look for trouble with me, then I would absolutely not look for trouble with them.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Calm down, I’m not going to kill you. I just have something to entrust you with!”

The centipede had quite a vigilant expression on his face, “What is it?” After all, he’d experienced how shameless Yang Ye was.

Yang Ye said, “I’m leaving Dark Hell Continent to deal with some things. I hope that you’ll help me take care of them when they arrive on Sword God Island. Treat it as me owing you a favor, alright?”

This was actually why he’d allowed the centipede to remain on the island. The centipede was quite strong, and if he was willing to help take care of the Sword Alliance, then the Sword Alliance would have the strength to fight back even if the demon race attacked.

The centipede replied, “I might be leaving as well!”

Yang Ye was shocked, “You’re leaving as well?”

The Ten Thousand Legged Centipede nodded, “Since the restrictions are gone, I’m naturally going to leave as well. However, it won’t be so soon. Don’t worry, I’ll help you take care of them until I leave.”

He was naturally willing to become friends with an expert like Yang Ye.

“Thank you!” Yang Ye smiled, and then he cupped his fist to the Ten Thousand Legged Centipede and said, “Farewell!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around and vanished into the sky.

The Ten Thousand Legged Centipede looked up into the sky and said, “Another Jian Wuji....”

...

Once he left Sword God Island, Yang Ye immediately returned to the Sword Hall.

Yang Ye looked at Ye Liuyun and said, “Is everyone here?”

Ye Liuyun replied, “They are waiting outside the hall!”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Let’s....”

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically, and then the others watched with astonishment as Yang Ye vanished on the spot.
