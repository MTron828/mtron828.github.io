Chapter 1454 – Trapped For Eternity!

Yang Ye asked, “It’s dead?”

Qiong Qi shook his head, “It isn’t, but it’s on the verge of it.”

Yang Ye nodded and sized up Qiong Qi. Even though Qiong Qi seemed to be completely unharmed, Yang Ye knew that it had definitely not been easy for Qiong Qi.

That python’s strength was extremely formidable!

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi said, “It’s imprisoned there, so it can’t utilize its full strength. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been that easy to deal with him. Go on in, it should be very helpful to you.”

Yang Ye naturally understood what Qiong Qi meant. Qiong Qi had crippled it, and now it was his turn to subdue it.

Since he had the Primordial Pagoda, it wasn’t too difficult for him to accomplish that.

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi added, “I’m at a critical point in my recovery, so I can’t leave for some time. If you encounter danger that you can’t resist, then... just run.”

Yang Ye was speechless.

Qiong Qi spoke solemnly, “I’m not joking, and I’m not trying to get you killed either. If it was any ordinary thing, then I would definitely delay it. After all, this place is really too dangerous for you. But it can’t be helped, I’ve finished gathering the energy throughout that demonic dragon. Now, I’m going to absorb it all in one go. If I succeed, then my strength should recover to 70% of my prime.”

Qiong Qi paused for a moment and continued, “The reason I can’t delay it is that I’ve already delayed it numerous times. If I still don’t absorb it, then the energy might explode apart within me. I’ve been constantly condensing it within me so that it grows even purer. Now, I can’t condense it anymore because I’ve condensed it to its limits.”

Yang Ye replied, “I thought you were done!”

Qiong Qi shook his head, “Do you think everyone is like you? You think we can just absorb everything quickly? You have that thing in you, and it can rapidly convert any energy into the purest form of violet energy for you. But we don’t have that thing, we can only condense the energy ourselves.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Why don’t you absorb that python as well?”

“It’s useless!” Qiong Qi continued, “The reason that demonic dragon was useful to me is that it’s a dragon, and it has the bloodline of a true dragon. Even though it’s so scarce that it can be practically overlooked, it still has that bit of it. So, it’s a little useful to me. Even though eating that python will have some effects, it wouldn’t be great. If I leave it to you, then you won’t be in that much danger while you’re here.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright, then just rest at ease and absorb the energy. Leave the rest to me.”

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something at this point, and he sent a voice transmission to Qiong Qi, “There’s a mysterious woman following me. Can you see her?”

Because the mysterious woman hadn’t shown herself for quite some time, he’d almost forgotten about her. Even though she hadn’t shown herself, his intuition told him that she hadn’t left and was still following him.

Qiong Qi fell silent for a long time, and then he shook his head.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly and sent another voice transmission, “Even you can’t detect her presence?”

Qiong Qi spoke angrily, “Kid, I’m not almighty!”

Yang Ye hurriedly flattered Qiong Qi, “You’re almighty in my heart!”

“Save the flattery!” Qiong Qi shook his head, “This place is quite mysterious. Not to mention you, even I would have to be careful here. Since that woman hasn’t acted against you, it proves that she probably has no ill intent. Just wait and see what happens.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “That’s all I can do now!”

He really couldn’t do anything about the mysterious woman right now. Fortunately, she didn’t seem to have any intention to attack him.

“Be careful!” As soon as Qiong Qi finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of light that entered Yang Ye’s chest.

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then he said, “Let’s go take a look at that big fellow.”

As he spoke, Yang Ye started walking towards the cave. The Celestial Demon Wolves and Eaglet quickly followed after him. Yang Ye hadn’t noticed that Eaglet had become even more respectful towards him.

It was naturally because of Qiong Qi.

The cave was in a mess. The python’s head wasn’t too far away from Yang Ye. But at this moment, it was mangled and covered in injuries left behind by a claw. Blood was flowing out like fountains from those injuries, and it seemed quite terrifying.

At this moment, it was on the verge of death.

Yang Ye walked over to it. He didn’t waste his breath at all and immediately waved his right hand. Big Blackie and Little Blackie understood his intentions and grabbed the head before trying to drag the python into the Primordial Pagoda. However, it didn’t take long for them to stop because they couldn’t drag it in. It wasn’t because of the snake’s size. The world within the Primordial Pagoda was massive. Not to mention a single python, it could fit many of them.

The reason they couldn’t drag it in was the chains that covered the python. Those chains were coiled tightly around the python, so they couldn’t drag it out of the cave and into the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye gazed at the chains. They were almost as thick as fists, completely dark black, yet didn’t seem special. However, even an idiot would know that it wasn’t ordinary. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been able to imprison the python in this damnable place.

So, he had to break the chains to drag the python into the Primordial Pagoda. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Yang Ye thought for a moment, and then he led Big Blackie and the others into the depths of the cave. The chains were coiled all around the python, so he had to cut them at the end.

Yang Ye’s group followed the python’s body forward, and this journey caused Yang Ye to break out in cold sweat. Only now did he notice that the python was much larger than he’d ever imagined. Its body was at least 30km long. If it wasn’t for those chains that restricted it from utilizing its full strength, it would really be difficult for Qiong Qi to defeat it!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye’s group to finally reach the base of the chains.

There was a black circle of light there, and the end of the chain was within the circle of light.

There was a stone tablet at the side of the circle of light, and there were words on it.

Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto the stone tablet — “The Ancient Emperor Python. It was born during the ancient times. It’s a vicious being that treats everything as food. But everything in the world has a spirit of its own. The path of cultivation is a difficult one, and I couldn’t bear to put an end to its path. Thus, I imprisoned it here. If it’s able to cleanse its heart and rid itself of its viciousness, then the formation will vanish on its own. If it doesn’t, then it’ll be trapped for eternity....”

For eternity.... Yang Ye shook his head. That fellow is really quite pitiable.

Actually, it was bringing doom upon itself because it hadn’t cleaned its heart at all. But it did make sense because it wasn’t realistic to expect that from a demon beast!

Yang Ye continued reading through the words on the stone tablet.

“One who comes after me. If you want to let it free, then remember that it’s vicious, and it’s very likely for it to turn on you.”

“Vicious? Turn on me?” Yang Ye shook his head, “Senior, don’t worry, I’ll teach it how to act like a proper person. No, I mean snake!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye walked over to the circle of light. He was just about to attack it when a ray of dazzling light suddenly erupted from it. Yang Ye’s expression changed, and he was about to defend himself. However, the circle of light shattered. Moreover, even the chains that bound the python shattered at this moment!

What’s going on?

The person who sealed the python isn’t ordinary at all!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. Obviously, that person definitely knew that he wanted to release the python, so the formation had destroyed itself once he got close to it. But how did that person know?

Yang Ye didn’t have an answer!

Yang Ye didn’t linger on the question. There were countless extraordinary figures in the world. Since that person could trap the python here, that person’s strength was definitely at a terrifying level, and that person had definitely done something to the circle of light. So, the formation had understood his thoughts when he got close, and then it destroyed everything.

Similarly, Yang Ye was certain that if he didn’t want to let the python go, then the formation would definitely not destroy itself!

Yang Ye didn’t waste any time and just waved his hand, “Get him in there.”

The demon wolves immediately grabbed the python’s tail and dragged it into the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. Even though the mysterious woman was here, he couldn’t do anything about it. He was helpless against her. Because even Qiong Qi couldn’t detect her presence, so it was obvious how strange and mysterious she was.

The Sword Domain?

Yang Ye wanted to use it, but he couldn’t afford to. If he detected her, yet she attacked, then it was obvious that he would die right away.

He had no way to solve this problem!

Just as Qiong Qi said, he could only wait and see.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, sat down cross-legged, and made Eaglet protect him.

Meanwhile, he immersed his consciousness into his body. At this moment, the python was in the world in the first level of the Primordial Pagoda. Even though it was absolutely weak, it was still awake. The chains had vanished, so there was a gaze of release in its eyes. However, once it arrived in the Primordial Pagoda, that expression was instantly replaced by curiosity.

Yang Ye’s clone arrived before the python, and it instantly gazed at him, but its gaze was quite calm.

Yang Ye didn’t beat around the bush because he didn’t have the time for that. He immediately said, “Hand over a strand of your soul and follow me if you want to live. Otherwise, living will be worse than death for you.”

The python gazed at Yang Ye for a long time. Suddenly, a vicious glow flashed through its eyes, and then it opened its huge mouth and shot towards Yang Ye’s clone.
