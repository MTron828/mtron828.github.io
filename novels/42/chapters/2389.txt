Chapter 2390 – A Flash From Afar!

Silence!

It seemed like the hall had frozen in place!

The middle aged men were completely stunned. The person Yang Ye had his sword against was the master of the Skywalker Sect, an actual Limitbreaker Realm expert!

But a Limitbreaker Realm expert hadn’t been able to resist a single swing of this young man’s sword! No, he hadn’t even been able to fight back against the young man!

At this moment, they were absolutely shocked!

Meanwhile, the master of the North Charge Sect cupped his fist to Yang Ye, “Please forgive me for my lacking hospitality!”

Yang Ye lowered his sword and gazed at the North Charge Sect’s master, “It was nothing.”

He laughed embarrassedly and gestured at Yang Ye, “Please have a seat.”

Yang Ye didn’t refuse and took a seat at the side.

Meanwhile, the black robed middle aged man was quite embarrassed, and he couldn’t decide if he should just leave or stay.

The black robed middle aged man wasn’t angry because the person before him was so strong that he didn’t dare to feel such emotions!

Yang Ye ignored the black robed middle aged man and gazed at North Charge Sect’s master, “I’m here for one thing. A friend of mine came to Divine Martial Continent, but I don’t know where she is now. I hope you can help me find her. Of course, I’ll compensate you!”

The master of North Charge Sect shook his head, “Compensate me? Don’t even speak of such things. Since you’re a friend of Xiaotian’s, then you’re a friend of mine. Your business is my business, and the business of my sect!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

“My Skywalker Sect is willing to be of service to you too!” Suddenly, the black robed middle aged man spoke abruptly.

Yang Ye gazed at the black robed man, and he cupped his fist, “I’m the master of Skywalker Sect, Li Yuan. Please forgive me for my previous offense!”

He paused for a moment and said, “My Skywalker Sect and the North Charge Sect are the largest sects in this area, and we have our own intelligence networks. Besides that, we have some connections with some of the other large sects in the area. I can talk to them myself and ask them to help you.”

Ye Tianxing suddenly said, “Brother Li is right. If you have the Skywalker Sect’s help, then your chances will be much higher!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Then thank you!”

Ye Tianxing suddenly asked, “May I know your name?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Yang Ye!”

He flicked two portraits over to them, and it was An Nanjing’s portrait of course.

Ye Tianxing and Li Yuan exchanged glances. In the end, they cupped their fists to Yang Ye and Ye Tianxing said, “We’ll go make arrangements now.”

Suddenly, Yang Ye flicked a pile of Eternal Immortal Crystals to them. There were around 50 of them there!

Both of them were stunned by the sight of this.

They were Eternal Immortal Crystals!

In a place like Divine Martial Continent where spirit energy was scarce, Eternal Immortal Crystals like these were legendary treasures! And there were even so many here!

Ye Tianxing and Li Yuan exchanged glances. In the end, Ye Tianxing gazed at Yang Ye, “Young Brother Yang, what are you doing? I told you that since you’re a friend of Xiaotian’s, then you’re a friend of my sect. You’re treating us like outsiders if you do this.”

While the Eternal Immortal Crystals were great, a favor from an extraordinary expert was much better!

They were very well aware of what they would gain by giving this up!

Of course Yang Ye understood what they were thinking! So, he smiled, “Finding someone takes a lot of manpower. As they say, things get done easily when there’s enough money. Just accept these Eternal Immortal Crystals as my good intentions and use them to encourage people who need to be encouraged. As for the specifics, I’ll leave it to the two of you.”

They exchanged glances, and then they stopped refusing and accepted the crystals.

Once they left, Yang Ye left the hall. Ye Xiaotian appeared before him outside the hall, and her eyes were filled with anticipation.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and smiled, “Do you have a suitable place?”

“Yes!” She shuddered, and then she ran off. A short while later, she ran back to Yang Ye and smiled with embarrassment, “Senior, please come with me!”

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, and then he followed her to one of the rear mountains in her sect. It was a mountain specially allocated to her for her cultivation in the sword!

Pass down his Sword Dao?

Actually, Yang Ye wasn’t very good at teaching others. Because he’d practically never taught anyone. However, just a little bit of guidance from Yang Ye would be extremely beneficial to Ye Xiaotian for a long time.

Yang Ye asked her to spar with him, and then he pointed out her flaws.

Time passed swiftly. Four hours later, Yang Ye left, and she fell into deep thought.

Yang Ye told her the sword was used to kill.

The sword was for killing?

She felt that Yang Ye wasn’t wrong, but she felt that something was off about it!

What was off about it?

She was pondering deeply about it!

Yang Ye returned to his room and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Cultivate!

Now, he had two sects helping him locate An Nanjing, so he could use this time to cultivate well.

He was suppressing his cultivation now, so he had to ceaselessly improve himself in every other aspect while suppressing his main realm of cultivation. Only then would he have the ability to surmount his realm of cultivation and kill his enemies. Besides that, he had to train with the Divine Treasures he possessed. For example, the Seal of Suppression and True Energy Mirror. He had to get used to using them. Only then would he be able to use them with ease against his enemies in battle!

Besides that, Yang Ye was focusing on his practice with the Sword Gourd.

At the instant his sword shot out of the Sword Gourd, the explosive force the sword contained was even greater than his Heavenrend. Moreover, its speed was extremely swift and capable of taking someone’s head from far away! Most importantly, the Sword Gourd had more than one sword within it!

So, it could release numerous swords!

Practice!

In the clouds of the Primordial Pagoda, the Sword Gourd hung by Yang Ye’s waist, and he just stood there with his eyes closed.

Focus!

Sword Scroll told him that he had to focus when using the Sword Gourd. The more he focused, or in other words, when his mind and soul were focused, his soul could lock onto his enemy while his mind issued the command to attack!

The mind!

The more focused he was, the stronger it would be, and the more accurate it would be!

Divine Treasures weren’t that easy to utilize, and they weren’t just easily utilized upon obtaining them. Every single one of them required the user to engage in extensive practice, and it was best if the user could merge into one with it. In that way, the user would be able to bring forth the full strength of the Divine Treasure!

Among the Divine Treasure Yang Ye possessed, the Primordial Axe of Creation was undoubtedly the strongest, but Yang Ye had given up on it.

Because it was more suited to Oxxy.

Oxxy’s physical form and strength were very well suited to the Primordial Axe of Creation, and the sword suited him best!

In the sky, Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes, and then the Sword Gourd shook violently. After that, a ray of light flashed, and a distant tree instantly exploded apart.

An instant later, the ray of light returned to the Sword Gourd!

Yang Ye grinned.

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “Satisfied already?”

Yang Ye looked over and saw Sword Scroll. She walked over to his side and raised a finger, “There’s a tree over there in the distance, and there’s a leaf on it. Try and see if you can pierce that leaf. Remember, only the leaf.”

A leaf!

Yang Ye frowned slightly, and she smiled, “What? You can’t do it?”

Yang Ye glanced at her, “I’ll try!”

He issued a command in his heart, and a ray of light shot out from the Sword Gourd. The tree there suddenly exploded apart and was obliterated!

The entire tree had been blasted into nothingness!

Yang Ye’s frown deepened!

“You’ve only gained a rudimentary grasp of it!” Sword Scroll spoke abruptly, “The Sword Gourd has many, many uses. When the owner of this Sword Gourd used it all those years ago, just its name was able to instill terror in the hearts of countless experts. It’s because you may not even see its owner before you die. Its strength lies in the element of surprise, its speed, and its accuracy. If you can make it faster, more accurate, and take your enemies by surprise, then even if your enemy is just 500km away like that tree or even further, you’ll still be able to kill your target with a single attack!”

Surprise, speed, and accuracy!VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Yang Ye looked down at the Sword Gourd by his waist, and then he closed his eyes slowly.

Practice!

Rays of sword energy frequently shot up into the air, descended into the ground, and flashed through the ocean…

There were no shortcuts when it came to cultivation, only painstaking training. Especially when dealing with Divine Treasures. Only hard work could help him truly bring forth the strength of these Divine Treasures!

Meanwhile, Snowy’s eyes lit up as she watched Yang Ye launch those swords through the surroundings. Fortunately, she didn’t try to take the Sword Gourd from him and play with it. She was quite sensible at most times!

Of course, it was only limited to Yang Ye!

Snowy watched for a while, and then she brought Oxxy to the Primal True Dragon’s territory. At this moment, it was still asleep.

Since Erya taught it a lesson that day, the dragon kept a very low profile and practically never left its territory. It just slept all day. Of course, sleeping was cultivating for it!

The Primal True Dragon seemed to have sensed something and suddenly opened its eyes. As soon as it saw Snowy, it immediately crawled up from where it was sleeping and went over to Snowy.

Snowy patted its horn and waved her paw. She was telling it to go play with her.

The dragon shook its head to say that it wanted to cultivate.

Cultivate!

It had to grow stronger to avoid being bullied!

Cultivate?

Snowy blinked, and then she started waving her paws. She was telling the dragon that it was no match for Erya and that Erya was very strong.

Oxxy nodded to display his agreement. Erya really was very strong!

The Primal True Dragon fell silent. It was a dragon, a dragon! If its ancestors found out that it had been bullied like this, they would probably be angered to death!

When had the dragons ever been bullied like this?

As for the culprit of it all, Erya, she was touching her own head in her abode right now. Two horns had started to emerge from her head. They were very small, but they were there.

Black horns!
