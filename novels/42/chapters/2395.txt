Chapter 2396 – Erya’s Bloodline!

Reversed bloodline?

Yang Ye frowned. He glanced ahead and walked over with Snowy in his arms.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to stop because a white robed old man had appeared there.

The old man had his hands behind his back. His body was slightly hunched, and his beard was so long it almost reached his chest!

At this moment, the old man was staring at Snowy.

Yang Ye glanced at the old man, walked over, and cupped his fist, “Sorry for disturbing you, Senior.”

The old man grinned, “It really is a Sprite Progenitor!”

He gazed at Yang Ye, “The world is truly miraculous. I didn’t expect to see a Sprite Progenitor in this world!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why can’t there be a Sprite Progenitor in this world?”

The old man smiled, “That is a good question. True, nothing is absolute. No Sprite Progenitor has appeared here in the past, but it doesn’t mean that it won’t happen in the future. There’s a first time for everything!”

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head, “As far as I’m concerned, she’s just Snowy and not a Sprite Progenitor.”

The old man smiled, “But the world is not of the same mind!”

Yang Ye smiled, “What does that have to do with me?”

The old man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “Taking a different path is very difficult.”

Yang Ye grinned, “It’s a path I chose. So no matter how difficult, I’ll finish it, even if I must do so on my knees!”

The old man sighed softly, hesitated for a moment, and said, “Junior, let me ask you a question. Answer me truthfully. If the world you reside in suffers a calamity one day, will you step forward?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

The old man asked, “Is it very difficult to answer?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Senior, I’m a selfish person.”

The old man smiled, “Who isn’t selfish in this world? I asked because of your Sword Dao. You’re not a heartless and disloyal person. Otherwise, this Sprite Progenitor wouldn’t choose to stay with you, and your Sword Dao would never have been able to progress until this point.”

He glanced at Snowy and continued, “That tombstone was forged by a good friend of mine with a precious treasure. It’s a treasure he used a Chaotic Divine Treasure and almost 100 years to refine.”

Yang Ye felt quite embarrassed, but he was not a shameless person. So, he was ready to return it. However, the old man suddenly said, “Now, I’m giving it to you!”

“Huh?” Yang Ye gazed at the old man with bewilderment in his eyes.

The old man smiled, “You didn’t hear me wrongly! I’m giving it to you!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “Why?”

The old man smiled, “I think fate brought us together. Is that a good enough answer for you?”

Yang Ye shook his head to display that he didn’t believe it.

The old man thought for a moment and said, “No one in this world isn’t selfish, but at most times, people are selfless too. Your emotions are true, kind, and extreme. But in the end, they are selfish emotions. They can only be considered as minor emotions. Do you know why the Sprite Progenitor is so powerful and loved by all things? Because their emotions are great emotions. Their hearts love all things, and so all things naturally love them.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Senior, I can’t be a hero.”

The old man thought for a moment and said, “Don’t you want your Sword Dao to grow stronger?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Yes, I really want that. But I think that nothing in this world can be had both ways, and I don’t seek perfection either. As far as I’m concerned, all that matters is that I have a clear conscience. Regardless of whether it’s to many loved ones, friends, or anyone else, a clear conscience is all that matters. As for the great emotions you spoke off, I think it does make a huge amount of sense. Unfortunately, it’s not suitable for me. Because I don’t want to be someone I do not want to be.”

He hesitated for a moment and continued, “A friend of mine once said that I should never grow stronger for the sake of growing stronger. I think that makes a lot of sense. What do you think?”

A clear conscience!

The old man smiled, “Don’t grow stronger for the sake of growing stronger! Your friend isn’t ordinary at all!”

Yang Ye smiled and remained silent.

The old man grinned, “I never expected that I would be discussing the Dao with someone as young as you!”

Yang Ye grinned, “I think you want to say that you never expected to discuss it with someone as weak as me, right?”

The old man smiled, “We’re from different generations. I dare not guarantee I would be able to suppress you at your age, just like that little girl. Both of you are extraordinary geniuses! As they say, time gives birth to greater talents, and so they lead the way for years to come!”

Little girl!

Yang Ye clenched his fists, “Senior, what did she look like?”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and waved his right hand. In an instant, a portrait condensed from spirit energy appeared before Yang Ye!

An Nanjing!

It was An Nanjing!

Yang Ye suppressed his excitement and asked, “Senior, where is she now?”

The old man asked, “You came here to look for her?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The old man said, “She went somewhere else, the south.”

The south!

The Southern Desolate Lands!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “Senior, the words Martial Tomb were written on that tombstone. Where does that name come from?”

The old man grinned, “I once had a nickname, the Martial Ancestor!”

The Martial Ancestor!

Yang Ye asked, “Did she take you as her master?”

The old man shook his head, “No.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

The old man smiled, “She chose someone else!”

Yang Ye asked, “The person in the Southern Desolate Lands?”

The old man nodded, “Her obsession was great, and her natural talent is very good. If she was willing to become my disciple, I would naturally not refuse her. No one in this world is more suitable to be my successor than her. Unfortunately, she chose someone else.”

He glanced toward the south and continued, “It’s really quite a pity!”

After he found out about An Nanjing’s whereabouts, Yang Ye had no further intent to stay. However, he still had a question, and so he asked, “Senior, you spoke about reversing the bloodline. What did you mean by that?”

Reversing the bloodline!

The old man explained softly, “When a person’s strength arrives at a certain level, they can change their bloodline. This change is like the strength of a demon beast’s bloodline. However, it’s not easy to reverse your bloodline, and anyone capable of accomplishing that is no weakling. As for you, your bloodline is being changed. In other words, you’ve surpassed your ancestors, or it should be said that you’ve surpassed all your ancestors. You’ve advanced beyond the bloodline they’ve given you and possess your own bloodline now. As for what it is, you’ll find out once it has fully formed in the future!”

Bloodline!

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Anyone can advance above their own bloodline by their own efforts? Even demons?”

The old man smiled, “In theory, yes. However, it’s very difficult. As for demons, it’s even more difficult. Many great demons of the demon race are made by their bloodlines but destroyed by their bloodlines too. Very, very few demons are able to overcome the bloodline of their ancestors, but once they do succeed, they will rise to a new height. It’s the same for humans. Now, you’re slowly improving in all aspects, and the benefits are on the way.”

The strength of his bloodline!

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while, and then he thought of a reason. It was his decision to suppress his cultivation. Was his decision to suppress his cultivation the reason that his bloodline had started to transform?

Yang Ye shook his head and stopped thinking about it. He asked, “Senior, you spoke about Erya’s bloodline as well. What bloodline is that? The bloodline of a great demon?”

“Erya?” The old man asked, “That little girl who took my tombstone?”Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Yang Ye nodded.

The old man chuckled, “She doesn’t possess the bloodline of a great demon. Her bloodline is much better than that. Even the greatest demon in the world has to submit before her!”

Yang Ye was stunned. He was about to say something when the old man suddenly said, “Don’t ask about her background. You’ll find out when the time comes. I refuse to tell you out of respect for her. She hasn’t awakened completely right now. Once she does, it’s her business whether she’s willing to tell you. If I tell you now, she may get angry at me for interfering!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and nodded. He stopped asking about Erya’s background and cupped his fist, “Then I’ll be taking my leave!”

“That sword sheath of yours!” Meanwhile, the old man suddenly asked, “Can you let me have a look at it?”

The sword sheath!

Yang Ye nodded and withdrew the sword sheath he’d obtained from the mysterious expert beneath the Northern Sword Sect. He flicked it over to the old man.

The old man gazed at it for a long time before he said, “I presume you’ve met that person.”

As he spoke, he flicked the sheath back to Yang Ye, “He’s a very powerful sword cultivator, a very powerful one. During our era, he was a sword cultivator who countless admired. Even that old geezer, Wu Ni, who’s never convinced of anyone’s strength was convinced of his strength. Do not bring shame to that sheath, and do not bring shame to its sword either. Farewell!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man vanished on the spot.

Its sword!

Yang Ye glanced at the sword sheath, fell silent for a short while, and then put it away and vanished into the distance.

There were many questions in his heart!

Who was the man beneath the Northern Sword Sect? Who was this old man he’d just met? Who was the old man with the bamboo chest? Who were they? Which era were they from?

Why did he feel smaller the stronger he became?

Not long after Yang Ye left, an old man in black clothes arrived at the Martial Tomb. The old man was that same old man who’d been following Yang Ye. After he left Cloud Residence, he’d followed Yang Ye all the way here as he had to figure out everything about Yang Ye. Of course, it was mostly because the powers of Eternal Border were afraid that Yang Ye would obtain more fortuitous encounters.

The old man at the peak of the Two World Realm glanced at the surroundings, and then he looked into the distance, “Show yourself!”

Obviously, he was talking about the white robed old man.

Suddenly, a wave of pressure appeared here.

Bang!

The old man was suddenly slammed down to his knees, and it didn’t stop there, his body was slammed flat on the ground while he couldn’t move a muscle!
