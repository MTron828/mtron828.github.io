Chapter 1450 – Asking For A Beating!

Yang Ye felt quite horrified.

He was sure that the ethereal figure’s disappearance was definitely related to the mysterious woman, and he was even more certain that she’d attacked earlier. However, he hadn’t been able to discern it clearly.

So, either her strength far surpassed his own, or her movement technique was special.

He was more inclined to believe the former!

Who exactly is she?

Why is she following me?

Why hasn’t she attacked me?

A string of questions had flashed through Yang Ye’s mind, but he didn’t have an answer for them.

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then he glanced at the surroundings, “Senior, I think that we can talk about it. If you have some unfinished wishes, then I won’t refuse if it’s within the scope of my ability.” He couldn’t figure out why the woman was following him but didn’t kill him, but he guessed that it might be for a similar reason as the ethereal figure from before. She probably wanted his help.

However, the woman didn’t answer him.

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched, and then he laughed bitterly, “Senior, if you have something to say, then just tell me. How would I know what you want if you refuse to tell me? If you just stay around him and keep putting your hand on me, do you realize how scary that is? I’m serious, we can discuss the matter....”

But he still didn’t receive a reply!

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he continued forward.

Actually, at this point, he knew that the mysterious woman had no ill intent towards him. Because if she had the intention to kill him, then the Primordial Pagoda would have definitely warned him. However, it hadn’t. He didn’t think that her strength was so formidable that even the Primordial Pagoda couldn’t sense it.

Since the Primordial Pagoda hadn’t warned him, it proved that she hadn’t revealed any killing intent towards him.

Even then, just thinking about how someone was following him made Yang Ye feel extremely uncomfortable. Besides that, even though she hadn’t attacked him now, who knew if she would do it later?

Thus, he hoped that she would show herself and discuss the matter with him. After all, everything could be solved with some discussion!

Unfortunately, she refused to show herself!

So, Yang Ye had no choice but to ignore her for now.

If she intended to show herself, then she would do it. In any case, he couldn’t force her to show herself.

While he traveled through the rope bridge, Yang Ye couldn’t help but glance down at the abyss below him.

What’s down there? Such a thought had appeared in Yang Ye’s mind, and he felt slightly curious. Of course, he wouldn’t go mad and jump down there. However, he’d decided that he would come back here once his strength was sufficient.

He was even more curious about the Ominous Territory.

Once he passed through the bridge, a cave appeared in front of Yang Ye. The cave was pitch black, and bone piercingly cold gusts of wind swept out incessantly from within it.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he gazed towards the right. He pushed his right hand forward, and a wave of force swept out from his palm. It didn’t take long for the miasma on his right to be pushed around 1km away, but he still only saw the body of a mountain.

Yang Ye’s face darkened, How huge is this mountain?

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he tapped his right foot lightly against the ground and transformed into a ray of light which shot up into the air.

Roar!

Suddenly, a furious roar resounded in the sky, and then a huge claw tore open the miasma above Yang Ye and clawed down at him.

Yang Ye’s expression changed, and he immediately drew his sword and swung it.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded in the sky. It didn’t take long for a strangely shaped beast to appear where Yang Ye had been a moment ago. The beast’s head was like an eagle, but its lower body was a pair of legs that were extremely similar to the legs of humans. However, its legs were comparatively longer. There was a pair of black wings on his shoulders, and it had a claw. But the claw wasn’t on its shoulder but on its chest!

The beast’s fist-sized eyeballs were scanning the surroundings incessantly, and its eyes were filled with a vicious glow.

A short while passed, yet it didn’t notice anything, so it shot up and vanished behind the miasma.

Once the beast left, Yang Ye appeared on the spot.

“What the heck was that?” Yang Ye frowned. That beast from before felt extremely dangerous to him. It could be said to be even stronger than the Celestial Demon Wolves! Actually, if he really intended to fight it, then the joint forces of himself and the two demon wolves had a good chance at killing that beast. But he hadn’t forgotten where he was.

If he fought here, it would definitely draw the attention of many monsters.

Yang Ye was quite conflicted. He had to pass through this mountain of unknown size, and there were three ways to do it. The first was to go around it, but who knew how huge the mountain was. He didn’t know how long it would take him to go around it. The second way was to go above it, and he’d tried that just now. However, he’d been attacked by a powerful beast.

There was one last way, and it was to go through the cave.

However, that cave seemed quite horrifying!

I can’t go in there!His intuition told him that he couldn’t go in because he didn’t know was luring within it.

The unknown was always the most terrifying.

Yang Ye took a deep breath and looked up because that was the only method he could choose. Since he’d made his decision, Yang Ye didn’t hesitate a moment longer, and he immediately flew up. This time, he acted much more carefully, and he slowly flew up, bit by bit.

If it was possible, he didn’t want to fight the best. After all, he merely intended to pass through.

Yang Ye didn’t know how high the mountain was. All he knew was that he still hadn’t reached the top after floating up for around an hour!

Suddenly, the miasma above him was torn open, and then a claw stretched out from the miasma and clawed forcefully in his direction.

It noticed my presence! A wisp of ferocity flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes. He stopped concealing himself, and the profound energy within him surged into the ancient sheath. At the same time, his slaughter intent and sword intent shot out and surged into the ancient sheath as well. Once the huge claw arrived around 1m above him, he swiftly drew his sword and attacked!

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the huge claw was blasted back into the miasma. After that, a furious howl resounded, and it carried a trace of pain.

It didn’t take long for the beast to appear above Yang Ye. It didn’t waste a moment and immediately shot down towards Yang Ye. Once it arrived around 3m away from Yang Ye, it suddenly opened its mouth and bit at Yang Ye. Obviously, it wasn’t to swallow Yang Ye alive.

Yang Ye shot up and swung his sword.

Boom!

An explosion reverberated through the miasma, and then rays of light flashed incessantly. At the same time, sword howls resounded incessantly through the sky.

It naturally caused quite a huge commotion!

However, Yang Ye didn’t care right now. He was furious. After all, he merely wanted to pass through, and he had no intention to kill the best, yet it wanted to kill him.

He felt that it deserved a beating!

The beast was extremely strong, but it was inferior when compared to the rock titan from before. It was mainly inferior when it came to its defenses. As for its offensive capabilities, it wasn’t inferior to the rock titan. However, its defenses were much weaker than the rock titan. So, Yang Ye’s sword was entirely capable of piercing through its defenses. After all, he was using the Sword Precursor right now.

After he attained the Voider Realm, he wasn’t so short on profound energy anymore. Moreover, he had the Worldmend Stone as well. So, he could fight with the Sword Precursor without worrying too much about his profound energy.

Moreover, the Sword Precursor was entirely capable of piercing through the beast’s defenses.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Numerous explosions resounded incessantly in the sky. A long time passed before Yang Ye and the beast split apart amidst a loud explosion.

At this moment, the beast’s body was covered in injuries, and it seemed rather terrifying. As for Yang Ye, blood was flowing incessantly from the corner of his mouth. Obviously, he was injured.

Fortunately, so long as it wasn’t a lethal injury, then it was just minor to him!

The beast stared at Yang Ye while viciousness filled its eyes.

Yang Ye waved his sword and said, “Let me pass through, alright?”

Roar!

The beast roared with fury, and then a ray of black light erupted from its entire body. It didn’t take long for a layer of thick black scales to appear throughout its body, and then it pounced at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed, “You don’t know what’s good for you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye waved his right hand, and then the two Celestial Demon Wolves emerged from within him.

“Bash it to death!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye shot towards the beast.

The demon wolves quickly charged forward as well.

The beast was stunned when it saw the demon wolves. Obviously, it hadn’t expected two ominous beasts to suddenly appear here.

Three against one!

The intent to retreat was visible in the beast’s eyes, but it was too late. Big Blackie and Little Blackie were behind it. At the same time, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that appeared in front of it.

If the beast had the defensive abilities of the rock titan, then it would really not be a huge problem for it to resist the joint attacks of Yang Ye and the demon wolves. Unfortunately, even though its offensive capabilities weren’t inferior to the rock titan, its defensive capabilities were too inferior. The beast had practically no ability to fight back against their joint forces. So, not to mention fighting back, it didn’t even have the chance to flee!

However, the beast suddenly made a strange screeching howl, and it seemed to be calling for help!

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly, So, that fellow has help!

Yang Ye didn’t dare delay, and he was about to attack. However, he suddenly seemed to have thought of something, and his eyes lit up. He fell silent for an instant before he gazed at the demon wolves, “Quickly drag it into the pagoda!”

The demon wolves were slightly stunned when they heard Yang Ye. It didn’t take long for a wisp of excitement to flash through their eyes, and then they dragged the beast towards Yang Ye. They were very swift to the point the beast wasn’t even able to react before it was dragged into the Primordial Pagoda.

Once they entered the Primordial Pagoda, both demon wolves released their grip on the beast, and then they moved to the side and laid on the ground.

They had to keep a low profile here.

The beast was first stunned, and then a ferocious gaze appeared in its eyes.

Roar!

It roared furiously, and then it raised the claw on its chest and slammed it down towards the ground.

The demon wolves glanced at the beast, and then they soundlessly moved backwards.

They felt that it was best to stay farther away from that fellow, so as to avoid suffering with it.

When it saw the demon wolves move backwards, the beast thought that they were afraid and acted even more wildly.

It was roaring.

The beast roared madly and ceaselessly slammed its claw against the ground. It seemed like it wanted to destroy this world.
