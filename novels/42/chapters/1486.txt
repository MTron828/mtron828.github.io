Chapter 1487 - A Sprite King!

Translator: InVader

Numerous thick vines had suddenly appeared around them. The vines were pitch black and thick like pillars. Vines covered the area all around them. Those veins were slowly approaching them like snakes. The most terrifying part was that these veins weren’t just on the ground, even the air was covered by black veins!

Yang Ye asked, “What are they?”

Lian Banzhuang didn’t answer him. She just glanced at the surroundings and spoke coldly, “Tree Monster, we’re just passing by. We have no intention to offend you!”

“You have no intention to offend me?” Meanwhile, a voice came from the surroundings, “You’ve offended me from the moment you stepped foot into this place.”

As soon as the voice finished resounding, the veins in the surroundings instantly started shooting towards Yang Ye and Lian Banzhuang.

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly, and then the casket lid appeared in his grasp. He was about to attack, but Lian Banzhuang was even faster.

A multicolored ribbon suddenly appeared in her grasp, and her figure spun on the spot. In an instant, countless rays of multicolored light shot towards the vines in the surroundings!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Explosions resounded incessantly.

The veins seemed endless. Vine after vine approached from all directions. If one looked from the outside, the vines around Yang Ye and Lian Banzhuang had formed a huge circle, and that circle was closing down on Yang Ye and Lian Banzhuang.

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “We can’t let this continue!”

At this moment, both of them were in a position where they could only passively defend themselves, and they weren’t even able to locate the shadow of that existence Lian Banzhuang called ‘Tree Monster’. If this continued, Lian Banzhuang would be exhausted to death even if she wasn’t killed directly.

Lian Banzhuang gazed at Yang Ye, “Do you have a plan?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She said, “Tell me!”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “Go all out and fight desperately with our lives on the line! When facing such people, the only way to make them stop is to make them experience fear. Otherwise, they will attack even more fearlessly. So, stop holding back.”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure shot forward with the casket lid in his grasp, and he slammed the casket lid at a group of vines.

Boom!

Yang Ye’s full strength shattered the vines before him. He didn’t stop and continued attacking.

Lian Banzhuang glanced at Yang Ye, and then she stopped holding back as well. She waved her hand, and a wave of terrifying force surged out from her ribbon.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

A large expanse of vines was instantly obliterated beneath her full strength.

At this moment, both of them had stopped holding back, and the vines were growing fewer and fewer!

“How dare you!” Suddenly, a furious shout resounded, and then an old man appeared not too far away from them.

The old man looked quite strange. Because his upper body was human, but his lower body was a tree trunk. Moreover, his hands were like branches as well. So, he seemed very strange.

Lian Banzhuang’s eyes were filled with a solemn expression as she gazed at him. As for Yang Ye, his eyes were very calm because he didn’t know who the old man was.

The old man stared fixedly at Lian Banzhuang, “Woman! Are you challenging me?”

Lian Banzhuang replied, “I told you. We’re just passing through and have no intent to offend you!”

“Don’t you know the rules?” The old man stared at her and said, “Every single person and demon beast has their own territory. You’ve arbitrarily entered my territory, yet you say you have no intent to offend?”

Lian Banzhuang was about to speak when Yang Ye shook his head, “There’s no need to continue talking with him. Just attack, attack with everything you have!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye raised the casket lid and charged at the old man.

Lian Banzhuang and the other man were slightly stunned. Obviously, they hadn’t expected Yang Ye to just attack. A moment of silence ensued before Lian Banzhuang charged at the old man as well.

“How presumptuous!” The old man was exasperated when he saw both of them attack, and he waved his hand. In an instant, countless black vines flashed out from all directions. In the end, they shot towards Yang Ye and Lian Banzhuang.

Bang! Bang! Bang

In an instant, explosions resounded incessantly throughout the area.

Around an hour later, the surroundings suddenly became calm.

“Leave!” The old man gazed at them with a terribly gloomy expression on his face.

Yang Ye put the casket lid away, and then he gazed at Lian Banzhuang, “Let’s go!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he started walking off into the distance. Lian Banzhuang glanced at the old man and hurriedly followed after Yang Ye.

The intent to kill within the old man’s eyes was practically material as he watched them leave. But he didn’t attack.

…

Lian Banzhuang spoke as they traveled, “He’s much stronger than you think.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I know.”

She asked, “Then why did you dare to act like that?”

He glanced at her and replied, “From the moment he attacked without even asking for a reason, I knew that he wouldn’t just let us leave. So, it’s like a battle between two armies. If you lose confidence, the enemy will become more confident. So, we couldn’t display any weakness. I wanted him to know that we aren’t afraid of him, and we’ll even fight him to the death. Once you choose to fight him to the death, he’ll naturally calm down.”

Yang Ye paused for a moment at this point, and then he continued, “Humans have a very bad habit, and it’s their fondness to bully the weak and fear the strong. So, at most times, we can’t show weakness. One word, fight! Just like that very moment, once we refused to yield, he chose to make a compromise instead. But if we choose to show weakness, he won’t make a compromise and let us pass. He would have made us turn back and request something else.”

“Such methods of dealing with things will make you offend many, and it’ll increase your chances of death!” She shook her head. She was a person with quite an explosive temper, but she felt her temper was really good when compared to Yang Ye. Yang Ye disregarded the consequences when he did most things. Just like the previous incident. Yang Ye had actually intended to take her down with him. She had to admit that while she really wanted to kill him then, she was really afraid that he would disregard his life to fight her.

Just as Yang Ye said, he may not be able to kill her, but he could cripple her.

If she were to be heavily injured here, then the consequences would be unimaginable!

So, she’d exercised forbearance. That indirectly represented that Yang Ye had won the battle that day. However, if she hadn’t exercised forbearance, then Yang Ye would have definitely died while she would have merely suffered some injuries!

So, Yang Ye’s extreme methods weren’t methods that she agreed with.

“Offend others?” Yang Ye shook his head, “Perhaps. Let’s not talk about that anymore and hurry up!” He wasn’t interested in discussing such philosophies of life because he felt that it was a waste of time!

Lian Banzhuang glanced at Yang Ye and didn’t say another word. She naturally knew that Yang Ye didn’t like her at all, so she would naturally not ask for insult. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

They just sped up.

Two hours later, Yang Ye felt the air around them grow hotter. Obviously, they were almost at the volcano.

Another hour passed. The temperature in the surroundings was growing even hotter. At this moment, Yang Ye had no choice but to use slaughter intent and sword intent to resist the heat.

Another hour later, Yang Ye and Lian Banzhuang stopped.

There was a mountain in the distance. Yang Ye was utterly shocked when he saw the mountain. The volcano was unlike what he’d imagined. The volcano before him was like a burning mountain of flames. Actually, it was a mountain of flames, but the flame was extremely huge!

Yang Ye asked, “How strong is that Lava Titan?”

“It’s very strong!” Lian Banzhuang spoke solemnly, “It isn’t from the outside world. It’s a being from this place, and it can be considered as a local.”

“A local?” Yang Ye glanced at her, “All of you are from the outside!”

She nodded.

Yang Ye asked, “Where?”

She glanced at him and said, “Why ask so much?”

Yang Ye replied, “I’m just a little curious!”

Lian Banzhuang withdrew her gaze from him and looked at the volcano, “Actually, the fire element energy within the volcano is useless to that Lava Titan. Because it’s the purest fire element Sprite King. So, the Fire Spirit Fruit is useless to it. Unfortunately, that fellow has been constantly occupying the volcano. However, if it wasn’t there, the Fire Spirit Fruits would have probably been taken a long time ago.”

Yang Ye was stunned, “A fire Sprite King?”

She nodded, “A true fire Sprite King, an existence that’s only inferior to a Sprite Lord!”

A Sprite Lord!

Snowy!At this moment, Yang Ye thought of Snowy. Because Snowy was a Sprite Lord. Based on what Blind Maiden had said, Snowy could suppress all Sprites. If Snowy was here, it would have been absolutely easy for him to obtain the Fire Spirit Fruits.

Unfortunately…

Yang Ye took a deep breath. If he got out of here alive, he’d decided to immediately travel to the large world and head to the Divine Phoenix Clan!

He wanted them to pay with their blood!

Lian Banzhuang spoke solemnly, “I’ll draw the Lava Titan away, and then you look for an opportunity to sneak in. Remember to leave immediately once you get the Fire Spirit Fruits. Otherwise, you’ll definitely die if it gets back. It’s practically invincible while it remains within the volcano. So, not to mention you, even the joint forces of five Dualism Realm experts can’t kill it while it’s within the volcano!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’ll leave once I get it!”

She nodded slightly, and then she vanished on the spot.

Bang!

After around three breaths of time, a huge pillar of fire erupted from the volcano and shot up into the sky. In an instant, the entire sky was burning. At the same time, a Lava Titan that was comparable to the Ancient Emperor Python in size had appeared in the sky.

“How strong!” Yang Ye had an extremely solemn expression on his face as he gazed at the Lava Titan. It’s definitely much stronger than that old man, Demon Wu!

It didn’t take long for the Lava Titan to become engaged in battle with Lian Banzhuang. They fought for a while, and they gradually started moving away from the volcano.

Yang Ye immediately transformed into a shadow that shot into the volcano.

As son as he entered the volcano, Yang Ye’s voice resounded, and it was filled with shock, “What the fuck!”
