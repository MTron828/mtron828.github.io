Chapter 2141 – Guardian of the Human Race?

The halberd tore through the sky!

It tore through space and instantly arrived before the hunched old man.

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly while gloominess flashed within them. He raised his right hand slowly, and then pressed it down.

Bang!

An invisible wave of force trapped Elysium. However, An Nanjing suddenly appeared behind it and kicked the end of it.

Boom!

Elysium blasted apart the old man’s energy, and then it shot to the old man.

The old man raised his palm and slapped it forward, and there was a mysterious whirlwind on his palm.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then An Nanjing and Elysium were blasted 300m away.

An Nanjing waved her hand and Elysium flew into her grasp.

Meanwhile, the old man suddenly spoke in a low voice, “You’re human too!”

An Nanjing didn’t say anything, and she just charged at the old man. As far as she was concerned, the stronger her opponent was, the greater her desire to battle would be. She was quite similar to Yang Ye in this aspect.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye didn’t just stand by idly. He obstructed the path of the other three Sages here while An Nanjing fought the old man.

One against three!

Yang Ye held Judgment tightly as he stood in front of them, and he seemed like a god of death.

At this moment, Yang Ye’s slaughter intent had overwhelmed his sword intent!

The human race!

Was Yang Ye against the human race? No, he wasn’t against any race! If he wanted to destroy the human race, he wouldn’t have just told Snowy to absorb the spirit energy around Heaven’s Son City, he would have told her to absorb the spirit energy in the entire Human Dimension. Based on Snowy’s ability, it was entirely possible. He was only against the Sovereign of Man’s organization. It was formed by the strongest experts of the human race, and they wanted to kill Yang Ye. Moreover, they used their influence to make the entire human race become enemies with Yang Ye.

Now, while the Sovereign of Man was dead, the human race didn’t dare to let Yang Ye go.

They were afraid of his revenge!

If Yang Ye grew stronger and started taking revenge like a madman, then the human race wouldn’t be able to endure such consequences. Especially when Yang Ye had this woman by his side too. Her strength was extremely terrifying too!

“Let’s fight!” Suddenly, Yang Ye’s voice resounded, and then he charged at those three Sages. At the same time, countless rays of sword energy shot toward them like bolts of lightning.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing and the old man were in fierce combat.

An Nanjing grew more and more ferocious as the battle progressed, and Elysium grew stronger. However, the old man still had the upper hand.

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded from the sky, and then a ray of light flashed. After that, everyone here was separated from their opponents.

All of them stopped, and they saw a sword not too far away from them!

The Sword Supreme!

Yang Ye frowned, What is she doing here?

The hunched old man exchanged glances with the others, and then they gazed at the Sword Supreme. If the Sword Supreme was here to help Yang Ye… Just thinking about it made their faces turn slightly pale. Yang Ye’s strength was already extremely heaven defying. If the Sword Supreme was willing to help him, then their joint forces would make Sages nothing before Yang Ye.

“If all of you die!” Suddenly, the Sword Supreme said, “The human race would be truly finished. Presently, the human race only has few Sages left. If all of you fight and kill each other, the human race will be taken out of history in advance, and you may become the weakest force in the Alliance of All.”

The old man and the others fell silent. Actually, the human race was in quite a bad situation right now. While its status in the Alliance of All had been inferior to the sky race, it could still be ranked in the top three. Yet now, after so much internal strife and the deaths of numerous Sages, the human race didn’t have much right to speak in the Alliance of All.

Yang Ye glanced at the Sword Supreme and said, “Why didn’t you step forward when the Sovereign of Man and the others were trying to kill me?”

“He wouldn’t listen to me!” The Sword Supreme continued, “It would be pointless to try.”

Yang Ye chuckled, “And you think I’ll listen, right?”

The Sword Supreme floated over to Yang Ye, “No matter what, you’re a human, and you don’t have ill intent towards the entire human race. However, if you kill the Sages of the human race, it’s equivalent to indirectly annihilating the human race. The human race will definitely be removed from history once it loses its Sages. Moreover, it may get suppressed and bullied. The entire human race will be thrown into an extremely dark era.”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “I’m a selfish person. All I know is that they wanted to kill me, yet you want me to repay enmity with kindness? I can’t do that.”

Meanwhile, the Sword Supreme suddenly said, “I won’t let you slaughter the Sages of the human race!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Trust me, I’ll take away the spirit energy in the Human Dimension and make the entire human race perish!”

The Sword Supreme fell silent.

She’d been with Yang Ye for some time, so she knew how insane he was. Once this fellow went mad, he was absolutely capable of anything. As for that little fellow, Snowy. She didn’t know the difference between right or wrong. All she knew was that she should do what Yang Ye asked. In any case, everything Yang Ye did was right. It was fine even if it was wrong, she didn’t care about that at all!

The old man and the others’ expressions instantly turned quite gloomy when they heard Yang Ye. If Yang Ye really did that, the human race would truly be finished. At a time like this, the human race didn’t have time to rest and recuperate at all. Moreover, once it lost all its spirit energy, even the best geniuses wouldn’t be able to grow. It could be said that it was no different than annihilating the entire human race!

“There’s no need for all of this confrontation and enmity!” Suddenly, a voice resounded from the side. Everyone looked over, and they saw a middle aged man walking slowly towards them.

Yang Ye recognized him.

It was the patriarch of the Lin Clan in Nature Sacred Grounds, Lin Zhen, and there were two other middle aged men by his side.

Lin Zhen walked over to them, smiled at Yang Ye, and then said, “These are Qiu Xianyan and Xu Tian, the masters of Island Sacred Ground and Yin Sacred Ground respectively.”

Three Sages!

The resources and reserves of the human race were naturally not limited to the few Sages who revealed themselves out in the open. After all, it had existed for countless years, so it had many Sages hidden throughout the dimension.

Meanwhile, Lin Zhen continued, “Everyone, there’s isn’t any huge enmity between Young Brother Yang and the human race. The reason he’s enemies with the human race right now is entirely because of the Sovereign of Man. Moreover, just be honest, did the Sovereign of Man really hunt Yang Ye for the human race?”

All of them remained silent.

“Of course not!” Lin Zhen continued, “The Sovereign of Man had his own selfish desires. He hunted Young Brother Yang not for the human race. But later on, after Young Brother Yang’s strength had matured completely, he still didn’t give up and stop. Allow me to be honest, he deserved to die. Now, all of you refuse to let him go because you’re afraid that he’ll take revenge in the future, but have all of you thought about why he’s targeting all of you?”

The hunched old man spoke in a low voice, “Lin Zhen, what are you trying to do?”

Lin Zhen smiled, “It’s very simple. The sacred grounds and paradises don’t want to be represented by the Sovereign of Man and the rest of you. All of you can only represent yourselves and not the human race.”

The hunched old man frowned when he heard this.

Meanwhile, Lin Zhen gazed at Yang Ye, “Young Brother Yang, our sacred grounds and the ten paradises have formed an alliance, the Human Alliance, and all humans can join it. We want to invite you to join us. Of course, we know that you dislike being tied down, so the position we’re giving you is the Guardian of the Human Race. No one can restrain you, and you'll receive all sorts of benefits, like…”

He grinned at this point and continued, “We three sacred grounds, the ten paradises, and a few seniors who are independent cultivators form a group of 17 Sages. It can be said to be the entire strength of the human race. If you join, we guarantee that we’ll always stand by you. Even if the other races want to attack you, we will stand by your side without any hesitation.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Meanwhile, Lin Zhen added, “Young Brother Yang, as you’ve mentioned in the past, the Sovereign of Man cannot represent the entire human race. Our alliance doesn’t want to become enemies with you. Moreover, we think that we must take charge of our own race’s future. Of course, it’s fine even if you refuse to join. We can still be friends!”

Actually, Lin Zhen and the others had wanted to do this for a long time. However, the Sovereign of Man was still alive, and the human race would fall into internal strife if they did that. But the human race couldn’t afford to engage in internal strife. So, they hadn’t chosen to shed all pretenses with the Sovereign of Man. But now, the Sovereign of Man was dead, so they had nothing to worry about.

Now, all they needed was Yang Ye’s answer.

The human race! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye fell silent.

He was hesitant!

He naturally didn’t have a bad impression of Lin Zhen’s group, but the position of guardian of the human race…

Suddenly, Yang Lianshuang’s voice resounded in his mind, “Agree to it. You need to establish an organization of your own, a huge one. Now, you have the human race as the foundation, and we’ll definitely be able to establish an extraordinary organization with that. Moreover, with the human race to help and coupled with the strength both you and An Nanjing possess, the other races will definitely not dare to rashly target you. If you refuse, then this newly-formed Human Alliance is very likely to join the Alliance of All.”

Yang Ye stopped hesitating when he heard up to this point, and he gazed at Lin Zhen, “Alright, I agree!”

Lin Zhen and the others smiled when they heard him. Lin Zhen walked over to Yang Ye and said, “From this moment onward, Yang Ye is the guardian of my human race. No one in the human race is allowed to harm him, and those who violate this will be sentenced to death!”

As he spoke, he intentionally glanced at the hunched old man.
