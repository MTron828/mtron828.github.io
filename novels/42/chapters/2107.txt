Chapter 2108 – The Dao Path!

The Sovereign of Man was naturally not afraid of Snowy, he was afraid of the Sword Supreme!

It was the number one sword of the large universe!

Actually, he wasn’t the only one, who here wasn’t afraid of it?

However, they were curious about why that little fellow could control it. It didn’t make sense at all!

Snowy wasn’t able to attack the Sovereign of Man in the end because Yang Ye stopped her.

The Sword Supreme was formidable, but the gap between Snowy and the Sovereign of Man was huge. He didn’t want Snowy to take any risks.

Snowy gazed at Yang Ye with bewilderment in her eyes.

Yang Ye smiled and said, “Hide for now, alright?”

Snowy glanced at the Sovereign of Man, and then she waved her sword.

Yang Ye smiled, “Just let me do it!”

Snowy blinked, and then she passed the sword to Yang Ye. Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and then he tried to take it. However, his hand couldn’t move an inch further after it arrived a few inches away from the Sword Supreme.

Yang Ye shook his head, and then he rubbed Snowy’s head, “Take her with you and hide, alright?”

Snowy glanced at the Sword Supreme, and then she nodded and vanished with it.

At this moment, everyone was looking at Yang Ye.

The Sword Supreme had chosen Yang Ye!

Even though it hadn’t really chosen Yang Ye, they felt that it had.

It had chosen Yang Ye in the end!

At this moment, complicated emotions filled all of them. In the beginning, they felt that it probably wouldn’t choose Yang Ye. After all, it was a divine sword with magnanimity and righteousness at its core. But Yang Ye was nothing like that. However, nothing ever remained predictable in the world, and the sword had chosen Yang Ye.

“Kill him!” Suddenly, the Sovereign of Man said, “Everyone, he has obtained its acknowledgement. If we don’t eliminate him now, we’ll be eliminated by him in the future. It's absolutely easy for us to kill him now, but after today, if he goes into hiding or sides with the god race… No, he has already sided with the god race. So, that sword will be on the god race’s side too. I don’t think any of you want to experience that sword’s blade for yourselves, right?”

All of them didn’t even hesitate to gaze at Yang Ye, and then an invisible wave of pressure appeared here.

Right when they were about to attack, footsteps resounded. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Tap! Tap! Tap! Tap!

It was very soft like someone taking a stroll, but it made everyone here stop. They looked towards its source, and they saw a woman in a white dress walking over slowly!

The god race’s strategist!

All of them had solemn expressions on their faces when they saw her.

She walked over to them, sized them up, and said, “It’s really lively here too. The Sovereign of Sky, the Sovereign of Man, the Shaman King, the Spirit King, the Sovereign of Demons… Tsk, tsk, the experts of a few generations are here.”

“Watch out everyone!” The Sovereign of Man spoke abruptly, “There’s probably an ambush here!”

“An ambush?” An old man spoke indifferently, “The god race isn’t the same god race anymore. So what if they’ve laid an ambush here? We can use this opportunity to deal with them!”

“Haha!” The woman in a white dress chuckled, “Actually, it’s just as that old man said, we can resolve everything now.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she waved her hand lightly. In an instant, a huge crystal blue circle of light appeared below their feet. An instant later, the surroundings turned ethereal, and then countless rays of stellar energy converged from deep within outer space!

“It’s a formation!” The Sovereign of Man’s eyes narrowed slightly. He gazed at the woman and said, “Needless to say, it’s a pretty powerful formation. But do you think it can kill us?”

She smiled, “Of course not!”

The Sovereign of Man gazed at her. Suddenly, he seemed to have thought of something, and then his expression changed drastically. At the same time, the space before all of their figures trembled.

Transmissions!

Two breaths of time later, all of the Sages here had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces. The Sovereign of Man glanced at the woman and said, “Very well done indeed. We’ll meet again!”

As soon as she finished speaking, he vanished on the spot, and then the other Sages started vanishing in succession.

Once all of them left, she waved her hand, and the formation vanished without a trace.

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Did you send your forces to attack all the races?”

She smiled, “You’re very smart.”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “It’s just as I thought!”

Actually, he would have done the same if their roles were switched. After all, practically all the top experts of all the races were here. So, it was the best opportunity to attack their respective dimensions. However, he hadn’t realized that earlier, and neither had all the other races. Because all of them felt that the god race would definitely not show itself in the near future. But they hadn’t expected the god race to be waiting!

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “I don’t understand something. If their homes are attacked, they’ll definitely receive news of it as soon as possible. So…”

She smiled, “As far as we’re concerned, we don’t need much time. Just 100 breaths of time are sufficient. Just that is sufficient to do a lot. Actually, I activated that formation earlier just to delay them a little longer. But in the end, I gave up on that thought. Because my forces have completed their mission. From today onward, all the races will have a gap in their central forces in the future.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “But their main forces are still alive!”

She nodded slightly, “One step at a time. It’s impossible to accomplish it all in one go.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Congratulations, that sword is finally yours.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “She didn’t choose me!”

“Fool!” The woman said, “Do you really think she chose Snowy?”

Yang Ye frowned, “Didn’t she?”

“Of course not!” She continued, “While that sword killed countless experts of my god race all those years ago, Emperor Xuanyuan and the other races are my god race’s true enemy. In the end, a sword is just a tool, and who it kills depends on its user. Of course, if it wasn’t for you, my god race would have eliminated that sword before it could even awaken. Now that she has chosen to stay with you, it’s obvious that she isn’t against you. Even if she hadn’t truly chosen you yet, it doesn’t represent that she won’t in the future!”

“Why would she choose me?” Yang Ye was puzzled, “Look, I’m not a righteous and magnanimous person!”

“Righteousness and magnanimity?” She chuckled, “Do you think Emperor Xuanyuan was righteous and magnanimous? I don’t deny that there are good people in the world, but everyone has their own standards towards what a good person is like. For example, that Sprite Lord of yours. In her heart, the whole world may be filled with bad people, but you are definitely an absolutely good person!”

Yang Ye shook his head and chuckled. She was right. As far as Snowy was concerned, Yang Ye was a really good person!

She continued, “Of course, the Sword Supreme’s spirit won’t be that na?ve. But can you tell me what righteousness and magnanimity truly are? Everyone has their own idea of it, and so does she. Moreover, according to my knowledge, you’ve never slaughtered anyone else out of ill intent, and you have never killed for no reason, right?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “If you continue, even I will start to think that I’m a good person.”

She grinned, “What do you plan to do now?”

Yang Ye replied, “I haven’t thought of anything!”

She nodded, “Anyway, take care!”

She turned around and left.

Only Yang Ye remained here. He walked over to the fragments of the furnace and waved his right hand. A flame flashed out and descended on his palm.

The Divine Yin Flame!

Yang Ye put it away and was about to leave when another flame floated out from there.

The Soul Fire!

The Soul Fire floated over to Yang Ye, and Yang Ye said, “You’re free now.” He turned around and walked away, but the Soul Fire floated over to him again.

Yang Ye was astounded, “You want to go with me?”

The Soul Fire trembled slightly.

Meanwhile, Snowy emerged, and the Soul Fire immediately floated over to her. Snowy grabbed the Soul Fire and cracked a smile to Yang Ye.

So it wants to stay with Snowy! Yang Ye chuckled. It made absolute sense to him. Snowy was a Sprite Lord, so something like that Soul Fire would gain absolutely huge benefits by staying by Snowy’s side. Moreover, there was the Primordial Pagoda too. The reason Snowy had been able to evolve so quickly could mostly be attributed to the Primordial Pagoda.

After Snowy left with the Soul Fire, only Yang Ye remained here.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and walked away. However, he hadn’t gone far before a middle aged man suddenly appeared not too far away from him. The middle aged man’s dressing was quite strange. He wore a dark blue robe and held a horsetail whisk.

Yang Ye had seen someone dressed like that in the past!

It was the same way the old man in Daoists’ robes dressed!

The Dao Path!

It was obvious who the middle aged man was.

Yang Ye glanced at him, “Do you need something?”

The middle aged man sized up Yang Ye and smiled, “It’s truly rare that you’ve been able to achieve such a level of strength at your age. Master’s gaze is still so discerning. Allow me to introduce myself, I’m the 7th among the 9 disciples of the Dao Path. You can call me Seventh Senior Brother.”

The Dao Path had finally come for him!

Yang Ye remained silent.

As far as he was concerned, this may not be a good thing!
