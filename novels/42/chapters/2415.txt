Chapter 2416 – By the Eternal River!

The young girl was none other than Tian Xiu.

Tian Xiu who’d been gone for so long!

Yi Shuihan gazed at Tian Xiu for a long time before she said, “This isn’t your main body!”

It wasn’t Tian Xiu’s main body, and it was just a projection. It couldn’t even be considered a clone.

Tian Xiu looked Yi Shuihan in the eyes, “Are you looking for me?”

Yi Shuihan refused to display any weakness and met her gaze, “I am!”

Tian Xiu nodded, “I’ll wait for you by the Eternal River!”

She shot a glance below, and her gaze traveled through space and allowed her to see what she wanted to see.

After that, Tian Xiu’s figure gradually turned ethereal.

By the Eternal River!

Yi Shuihan’s eyes narrowed slightly.

She naturally knew that place!

She hadn’t expected Tian Xiu to already be there!

A long time passed before she opened her eyes, and then Yi Shuihan vanished into the boundless reaches of space.

She was going straight for the Eternal River!

Once Yi Shuihan left and Yang Ye joined the battle, the situation was instantly turned around.

Rays of sword energy flashed through the clouds from time to time, and every one of them was horrifying to the other experts here.

Fear!

They felt extreme fear!

Since Yang Ye had arrived, every flying sword that left his gourd would take the life of a Three World Realm expert. Fortunately, they were on guard now, so it wasn’t that easy for Yang Ye to kill them in an instant.

However, it truly exhausted their minds. Because they had no choice but to keep most of their focus on Yang Ye. Moreover, while they could stop one of Yang Ye’s flying swords, the problem was that he had two!

Even if they could dodge one, they couldn’t dodge two!

Hiss!

Along with a ray of light that tore through the clouds, the head of a Three World Realm expert instantly flew up into the air.

Yang Ye was just about to continue his attack when a few Limitbreaker Realm experts charged at him.

Deal with Yang Ye first!

Yang Ye remained indifferent as he watched them charge at him. Right when they were just a few meters away, a sword appeared in Yang Ye’s grasp!

Executor!

A moment later, a ray of light flashed.

Hiss!

Space was instantly obliterated wherever it passed, and the two experts at the front of the group were instantly sliced into two!

The remaining Limitbreaker Realm experts were stunned on the spot.

Instant annihilation!

They had been instantly killed just like that?

Suddenly, two flying swords shot by.

The head of a Limitbreaker Realm expert in front of Yang Ye instantly flew up into the air while accompanied by a pillar of blood!

“Retreat!” Meanwhile, someone shouted, and then the countless experts in the sky fled toward the surroundings.

Flee!

At this moment, they had no desire to continue fighting because every attack of Yang Ye’s could take their lives!

How could they fight him?

It was impossible.

An Nanjing glanced at him, “Shall we pursue them?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Actually, while he’d killed Three World Realm experts like dogs earlier, it had been because he’d taken them by surprise in the beginning. Yet now, they were on guard against him, so it was still quite difficult to kill them in an instant.

Of course, most importantly, there were many more watching from the shadows.

Moreover, An Nanjing, Sword Scroll, Jian You, and the Primal Vicious Tiger were heavily injured. If the fight continued, it would only end in mutual destruction. He didn’t fear that, but he couldn’t drag An Nanjing, Sword Scroll, and Jian You to death with him!

That was why he hadn’t stopped them from fleeing with the Myriad World Diagram!

It didn’t take long for the surroundings to gradually calm down.

Yang Ye looked down, and Erya was fighting the gray robed old man.

Yang Ye was about to lend her a hand when Sword Scroll stopped him, “Wait a while longer!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and nodded.

At this moment, Erya was slamming the tombstone violently at the gray robed old man.

Strength!𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Pure strength!

Erya’s strength was too terrifying. Every single time the tombstone descended, the world around them shook.

The gray robed old man didn’t dare to go head-on against her terrifying physical strength! So, he could only passively dodge and defend himself, so it could be said that he was being completely suppressed.

Sword Scroll spoke softly by Yang Ye’s side, “She’s angry!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Very angry!”

Bang!

Suddenly, an explosion resounded from afar, and then Yang Ye and the others watched as the gray robed old man was slammed far away by the tombstone.

An instant later, the gray robed old man was about to flee, but Erya suddenly put down the tombstone and slammed her fist at him from afar!

A wave of powerful force swept out from her fist, and it was like an ancient volcano erupting before her. It was extremely terrifying.

Boom!

The old man was blasted far away. In the end, he crashed into the ground and slammed open a huge hole there.

The old man was just about to get up when Erya appeared before him, and then she stomped her foot down on his chest.

The old man was utterly immobilized!

Erya gazed at the old man, licked her lips, and then opened her mouth and sucked while Yang Ye and the others watched with shock. She sucked the old man into her stomach.

Swallowed!

He’d been swallowed alive!

Sword Scroll and Jian You had solemn expressions on their faces. Even An Nanjing couldn’t help but glance at Erya.

She’s eating people? Alive too?

Yang Ye was shocked too. He only knew that Erya ate demon beasts, but he hadn’t expected her to even eat people!

She’d eaten him alive!

What the heck is she?

Meanwhile, Erya walked over to Yang Ye and the others. She glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Big Brother Yang, I’m still hungry!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Erya suddenly shook her head, “I’ll eat later. I’m going to take a look at Oxxy and that stupid dragon!” She entered the Primordial Pagoda once she finished speaking.

A long period of silence ensued here before Yang Ye gazed at An Nanjing, and the latter shook her head slightly, “I’m fine.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he waved his hand and sent all of them into the Primordial Pagoda.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye brought all of them to Oxxy and the Primal True Dragon. At this moment, Snowy was treating both of them.

With the help of the Eternal Energy and Primordial Violet Energy, Oxxy and the Primal True Dragon were saved from the brink of death.

After all, they were the two best healing energies in the world!

It could be said that if it wasn’t for them, Oxxy and the Primal True Dragon would really be dead.

Even then, both of them weren’t in a very good condition.

Snowy immediately flew over to Yang Ye’s shoulder when she saw him, and then she pointed at Oxxy and the Primal True Dragon.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “It’s alright, they’ll get better.”

Snowy nodded, and then she gazed at the Primal Vicious Tiger. The tiger hadn’t been targeted by Yi Shuihan, so it was in a much better state. However, Snowy’s gaze still had concern in them.

The tiger glanced at Snowy and shook its head slightly, “I’m fine.”

Its condition really wasn’t that bad. After all, Primal Demons like it excelled at taking beatings.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. Besides him, practically everyone else on his side was heavily injured from the battle!

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Recuperate well. Leave the rest to me.”

He gazed at Jian You and continued, “Thank you for what you did today.”

She shook her head, hesitated for a moment, and said, “Can I have a look at that sword?”

Yang Ye nodded and issued a command in his heart. Executor immediately flashed out of the Sword Gourd and arrived before Jian You.

Jian You gazed at it for a long time and said, “It’s a great sword!”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Take care!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she left the pagoda and transformed into a ray of sword energy that vanished into the sky.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Sword Scroll spoke softly, “She’s finally free. I’m certain she’ll grow stronger and stronger now!”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Because she has no shackles and responsibility anymore, right?”

Sword Scroll nodded, “The responsibility that has remained in her clan for generations is finally gone.”

As she spoke, she gazed at Executor, “I didn’t expect this sword to fall into your hands. Three World Realm experts are practically no threat to you, and even Four World Realm experts are probably unable to pose a huge threat to you!”

Yang Ye looked up at the sky, “Four World Realm experts are much stronger than I imagined. I’m still too weak.”

He went to the cultivation room while he spoke. There were three swords floating there, the Sword Precursor, the Sword Supreme, and Executor.

He’d had a thought while he was recuperating deep underground, and it was to merge them into one!

Three flying swords flying as one!

It was actually possible, but when he tried to utilize it earlier, he’d discovered that he could only merge two at most!

While Executor could enter the Sword Gourd, it rejected the Sword Gourd, and the Sword Gourd couldn’t move it at all!

Not only did it reject the Sword Gourd, it rejected the Sword Precursor and Sword Supreme!

As for the Sword Precursor and Sword Supreme, they were unwilling to come into contact with Executor as well. It was because that sword was too, too powerful, and their consciousnesses would be damaged from just getting close to it!

Actually, it wasn’t just the two swords, even the Sword Gourd didn’t want Executor to enter it.

It was too sharp and powerful!

In the cultivation room, Yang Ye put Executor aside and gazed at the other two swords.

Merge them as one!

Yang Ye issued a command in his heart, and they immediately entered the Sword Gourd. A moment later, a ray of light shot out from the Sword Gourd.

A ray of light but two swords!

They were like a flash!

The attack had grown stronger, but its speed had declined!

It was because he had to release two swords at once, and it was more mentally taxing than when he released a single sword at a time!

However, it wasn’t a huge problem for Yang Ye.

Train!

Train like a madman!

So, while An Nanjing and the others recuperated, Yang Ye trained like a madman.

Just like that, Yang Ye’s flying swords grew stronger and stronger, and their speed was increasing as well…

Revenge!

The moment An Nanjing and the others recovered would be the moment he went out in search of revenge!
