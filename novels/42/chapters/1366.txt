Chapter 1367 – Are You Still Not Going To Fuck Off?

Come!

Everyone looked at Yang Ye when they heard him, and then their expressions became solemn. Even the second young miss revealed a solemn expression on her face.

Besides a few people, one’s strength could actually be determined by the aura one possessed. At this moment, Yang Ye was like a sharp unsheathed sword as he stood there, and it caused others to dare not look straight at him!

A wisp of surprise flashed through the beautiful woman’s eyes, and there was a trace of curiosity in them as well. She carefully sized up Yang Ye, and then a smile appeared on her face. No one knew what she was thinking.

The second young miss of Azure Cloud Merchant Group took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, and then she looked at Elder Xun. Elder Xun remained silent for a moment before he nodded.

The second young miss visibly relaxed when she saw him nod, and then she flicked 4 rays of blue light towards the surroundings. After that, a huge blue barrier of light appeared around Yang Ye and Elder Xun.

The second young miss said, “This is a spatial barrier that’s extremely strong. It can endure the attacks of Semi-Deities. So, both of you can begin now.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he started walking towards Elder Xun. His footsteps weren’t quick and should be said to be extremely slow. However, Elder Xun’s expression changed because a wave of invisible pressure was pressing down upon him!

Bang!

An imposing aura exploded forth from Elder Xun. As soon as it appeared, Elder Xun’s body instantly felt relaxed. However, a terrifying force suddenly covered the heavens and the earth as it slammed down upon him, and it only took an instant for Elder Xun’s aura to be pushed back into him.

Elder Xun was shocked, and his eyes were filled with disbelief.

After all, a Voider like him had actually been suppressed by an Emperor!

The second young miss’s eyes had narrowed slightly, and she turned to glance at Ye Liuyun. At this moment, Ye Liuyun was looking at her too. Ye Liuyun grinned and moved her gaze to Yang Ye. Actually, while she seemed to be extremely calm, she was quite anxious in her heart. She knew that Yang Ye could definitely defeat Elder Xun.

Elder Xun was very strong indeed, but he was much inferior when compared to the Demon Empress. Since Yang Ye could defeat the Demon Empress, he definitely could defeat Elder Xun. Ye Liuyun was anxious because she didn’t know if Yang Ye could defeat Elder Xun in 10 moves! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

10 moves!

Even she wondered if she’d gone mad to actually bet that Yang Ye could defeat a true Voider in 10 moves. If Yang Ye failed, then the Sword Alliance’s members would really have to eat grass.

Suddenly, Yang Ye took the hilt of his sword and drew it slightly.

Om!

A sword howl shot up into the sky and pierced the clouds.

Crack!

At the same moment, the blue barrier of light around Yang Ye and Elder Xun cracked apart. Moments later, it exploded into pieces while the spectators watched with shock.

Everyone was stunned.

Yang Ye looked straight at Elder Xun who was sweating profusely, “You’ll die if I swing my sword. Are you sure that you want to try?”

If it was a normal battle, he really couldn’t kill Elder Xun with 10 moves. So, he used the true form of Heavenrend!

100,000 divine crystals!

He couldn’t afford to lose!

Elder Xun stared fixedly at Yang Ye. He clenched his fists tightly to the point his nails sunk deep into his palm while cold sweat flowed incessantly from his forehead.

To try or not to try?

Even though Yang Ye hadn’t drawn his sword completely, Elder Xun’s intuition told him that he shouldn’t try. If he did, it was very likely that he died. But if he didn’t.... If he didn’t, then he would live beneath Yang Ye’s shadow for his entire lifetime, and he could dream of improving further while being affected by that fear.

If he tried, he might die!

If he didn’t, he would be affected mentally for his entire life!

Elder Xun didn’t hesitate for too long. He took a deep breath and was about to speak. However, the second young miss spoke abruptly, “I concede!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she flicked a spatial ring over to Ye Liuyun, “There are 90,000 divine crystals in there. I’ll send the balance over later!”

If it was possible, she was naturally unwilling to concede. However, Elder Xun would definitely try to resist Yang Ye’s attack if she didn’t concede, and it was very likely that Elder Xun wouldn’t live through it!

A true Voider wasn’t something that could be bought with 100,000 divine crystals. Moreover, if Elder Xun was really killed, it would affect her negatively. So, she’d decisively chosen to admit defeat.

Yang Ye glanced at the second young miss, sheathed his sword completely, and walked over to Ye Liuyun. Ye Liuyun blinked and quickly put the spatial ring away.

Yang Ye was speechless.

Ye Liuyun smiled, “I’ll take care of it for you!”

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled. Even she has become obsessed with wealth.

Yang Ye didn’t ask for the spatial ring because they were more useful in Ye Liuyun’s hands.

Meanwhile, the second young miss gazed at Ye Liuyun and asked, “Are you his?”

Ye Liuyun turned to look at the second young miss, and then she shook her head, “Why?”

The second young miss nodded slightly and said, “Are you interested in following me? If you are, then from this moment onward, you’ll be the manager of our merchant group in Stellar City.”

She was trying to take Ye Liuyun from Yang Ye!

Yang Ye’s face instantly darkened because she was actually doing so right in front of him!

Yang Ye stood in front of Ye Liuyun and said, “Second Young Miss, isn’t it rude to do something like this?”

The second young miss spoke indifferently, “I feel that she has talent, and she’ll have a better future in my Azure Cloud Merchant Group.”

Bang!

A strand of terrifying sword intent suddenly surged out from Yang Ye. It appeared too abruptly, causing her to be taken by surprise and blasted around 100m away.

Everyone was shocked. They hadn’t expected Yang Ye to just attack abruptly. Even the second young miss felt the same. Her eyes were filled with surprise and a trace of icy coldness.

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes and said, “I don’t want to waste my breath on your merchant group, and especially you. If you don’t know how to respect others, then I don’t mind teaching you how.”

The second young miss’s expression instantly became completely icy cold. Meanwhile, the man by her side suddenly stepped forward. He gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Do you think you’re very strong?”

Bang!

Suddenly, a pair of wings appeared behind Yang Ye, and then his figure vanished on the spot.

Bang!

Everyone watched with astonishment as the man was blasted away, and he flew over 1km away!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye vanished on the spot. Elder Xun’s expression changed drastically at the sight of it, and he shouted with fury, “Don’t you dare!”

He was about to attack as he spoke. However, it didn’t take long for him to stop because Yang Ye’s hand was squeezing down on the second young miss’s throat.

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes and said, “That manager of yours came looking for trouble with me just now. Now, you’re doing the same. Do you think I’m easy to bully?”

As he spoke, he squeezed down slowly, causing her face to instantly turn pale.

Elder Xun shouted furiously, “Do you realize what you’re doing?!”

Yang Ye suddenly tossed her towards Elder Xun. Elder Xun was shocked and hurriedly stretched out his hand towards her back to stop her.

Bang!

The powerful force of the collision pushed Elder Xun and the second young miss backwards, and they moved almost 50m back before they finally stopped.

Yang Ye started walking towards Elder Xun and the second young miss. Elder Xun and the others’ expressions changed drastically, and they hurriedly circulated their profound energy and were ready to act at any moment. Meanwhile, Yang Ye stopped, glanced at them, and said, “To be honest, if I wanted to kill all of you, then not to mention just all of you, even 10 more true Voiders wouldn’t be able to stop me. Quickly fuck off before I change my mind.”

As soon as he finished speaking, a strand of terrifying slaughter intent surged out from within Yang Ye!

Void Rank slaughter intent!

Elder Xun and the others were shocked. While it was only at the Void Rank and wasn’t a huge threat to them, someone who could attain Void Rank slaughter intent was definitely no ordinary person.

Yang Ye paid no attention to them and just started walking towards Divine Sky Pavilion. Ye Liuyun glanced at Yang Ye and followed him.

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “Wait!”

Yang Ye stopped, turned around, and looked towards the distance. It was the old man in a luxurious robe that had spoken. Yang Ye gazed coldly at the old man, but the old man didn’t fear Yang Ye at all and met his gaze, “That treasure is of the utmost importance to my Skyriver Stellar Region, so please hand it over!”

“I don’t have it!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around and walked away.

The old man spoke in a low voice, “So you intend to become enemies with my Skyriver Stellar Region?”

Yang Ye stopped, remained silent for an instant, and then suddenly said, “So be it!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around, drew his sword, and swung it.

Om!

A sword howl resounded, and then a beam of sword energy flashed. Elder Xun’s expression changed drastically when the sword energy appeared, and then he hurriedly took the second young miss and eldest young miss with him as he moved around 3km back!

Meanwhile, the figure of the old man in luxurious robes had stiffened on the spot. His eyes were opened wide and filled with disbelief. A moment later, a cut suddenly appeared at the center of his forehead. It didn’t take long for it to grow larger. In an instant, the old man was split into two and blood sprayed all over the ground.

Everyone here was horrified, including the two young misses or Azure Cloud Merchant Group. They hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually draw his sword and kill because of the slightest disagreement.

Of course, they were even more shocked by Yang Ye’s strength. Because that old man had been a true Voider!

However, the old man hadn’t even been able to resist a single swing of Yang Ye’s sword!

Is he really just an Emperor?

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot. The second young miss’s pupils constricted at the sight of this, and she seemed like she was facing a terrifying enemy and became completely vigilant. However, Yang Ye hadn’t attacked her. His targets were the remaining Voiders from Skyriver Stellar Region.

At the moment Yang Ye vanished, their expressions had changed drastically and had hurriedly attacked. However, Yang Ye’s speed suddenly rose explosively!

5 breaths of time later, 2 more corpses were on the ground.

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the spatial rings on those corpses flew into his palm. After that, he turned to look at the second young miss’s group and said, “Are you still not going to fuck off?”
