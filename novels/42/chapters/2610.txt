Chapter 2611 – Training with the Sword!

Along with the voice, the space in the surroundings warped strangely once more!

This time, Yang Ye’s face turned icy cold!

He hadn’t come here with the desire to cause trouble, but they refused to let him stay out of trouble!

He didn’t know why the Void World was acting against him, but it wasn’t important anymore!

Yang Ye’s blood suddenly started surging, and then strands of powerful energy ceaselessly rippled out of him.

Bloodline Energy!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword stabbed forward!

The Sword Domain!

The Domain Sword!

The entire world around them shook as if it had been struck by a sledgehammer. A moment later, the entire world turned ethereal before collapsing inch by inch.

This time, the collapse was unlike before. The essence of the area had collapsed as well!

Every formation, barrier, and even illusion couldn’t endure destruction from absolute strength!

Now, Yang Ye’s attack had fully surpassed the limits of this world!

Destroyed by a single attack!

A few breaths of time later, the surroundings returned to calm once more.

At this moment, Yang Ye and Blood Maiden had left the area they’d been in. Presently, they were in the Void World. The previous world around them had been an ethereal one, and they were in the real world now!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, “Show yourself?”

He received no answer.

Suddenly, rays of sword intent and sword energy swept out from Yang Ye, and they rippled toward the surroundings.

If Yang Ye did as he pleased at his level of strength, it would be a calamity to any world!ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Even Eternal Kingdom couldn’t endure his strength!

And the Void World wasn’t even a high level world!

It didn’t take long for a wave of powerful energy to appear in the surroundings. Along with its arrival, Yang Ye’s sword intent and sword energy were forced to a stop!

But that wasn’t the end of it!

The mysterious energy enveloped Yang Ye and Blood Maiden, causing the sword intent and sword energy to be pushed back toward them!

Meanwhile, Executor suddenly slashed forward!

Hiss!

Space was sliced open like a piece of paper!

Suddenly, a pitch black chain appeared around Executor, and then it tightened itself around Executor!

At the same time, a middle aged man in a black cloak appeared near Yang Ye!

Yang Ye frowned upon seeing this person because the latter wasn’t at the Destiny Realm!

he wasn’t the Void Lord!

Yang Ye didn’t think too much about it and just waved his hand. Executor shook violently, and then it struggled free of the chains and returned to him!

Yang Ye gazed at the man, “Is there no room for negotiation?”

The mysterious man with the cloak said, “You have two choices. Firstly, fuck off right now. Secondly, die here. Right, the Void World is an ally of Eternal Kingdom. Understand?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I didn’t quite understand earlier, but I do now. An ally, huh? The friend of my enemy is my enemy. Since we’re enemies, I understand even better now!”

Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot.

At practically the exact same moment, the mysterious man vanished on the spot too.

A moment later, Yang Ye arrived around 3m before the mysterious man, and the latter’s pupils instantly constricted upon seeing Yang Ye before him!

Danger!

It was his first reaction, and his instinct was to create distance with Yang Ye!

However, it was too late!

Hiss!

Along with the sound of something being sliced open, a figure was blasted away!

It was Yang Ye’s figure!

Yang Ye flew over 300m before he finally stopped. There was a pitch black chain that had pierced his chest! However, it wasn’t a lethal injury!

Meanwhile, the mysterious figure had lost his head!

Yang Ye had taken an injury in exchange for taking his opponent’s life!

Blood Maiden took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye while solemness filled her eyes!

She noticed that Yang Ye’s ability in close quarters combat was extremely terrifying. It could be said that his strength was unparalleled in close quarters!

At that moment, Yang Ye was like a peerless and invincible sword cultivator!

Yang Ye sliced the chain into countless pieces with a quick swing of his sword!

So long as it wasn’t a Super Divine Treasure, Executor could destroy it with absolute ease!

Yang Ye gazed at Blood Maiden, “Second Sister, let’s go!”

Blood Maiden asked without thinking, “Where are we going?”

Yang Ye smiled, “To look for Eldest Sister, of course. If we can’t find her today, we’ll destroy this place.”

Blood Maiden rolled her eyes at him, “We’re here to look for her, not to fight. So, be reasonable. Understand?”

Yang Ye was stunned, “Second Sister, has someone seized control of your body?”

Bam!

She struck his head hard. Of course, Yang Ye didn’t dare to fight back and hurriedly admitted his mistakes.

No matter how strong he became, there were people who he felt he had to respect forever, and he sincerely respected them!

It didn’t take long for them to continue forward!

There were many obscure auras in the surroundings that were following them, but Yang Ye didn’t attack them!

According to Blood Maiden, there was a teleportation formation into the Void Space at a floating palace at the end of the mountain range. That was their destination.

A short while later, the floating palace appeared within their fields of vision!

It was a grand palace made of unknown golden stone, and it emanated an invisible wave of pressure that felt extremely heavy!

Yang Ye released his sword intent, and the pressure instantly vanished!

Yang Ye led Blood Maiden through the air toward the palace, and it didn’t take long for them to arrive at the palace’s entrance. An ethereal figure stood not too far before them!

It was shaped like a person and held a pitch black cane!

The figure said, “Sect Master Ye, there’s no enmity between you and my Void World, yet you’ve trespassed and killed residents of my Void World. Aren’t you a little too overbearing?”

Yang Ye smiled, “What? You plan to reason with me now?”

The figure replied indifferently, “Everything requires reason. Sect Master Ye, you…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye shook his head, “Sorry, I don’t want to reason with you now. When I tried to give you face, you didn’t cherish it. Now, I will do the same. Right now, there are only two paths left before us. Firstly, let us into the Void Space, and we’ll leave once we find the person we’re looking for. Secondly, I’ll kill all of you and head inside.”

The figure fell silent for a short while and said, “They said you’re extremely overbearing. Now, we’ve seen it for ourselves. If you wish to go inside, then do so. However, let me warn you. Don’t blame us if you fail to come out safely.”

Yang Ye smiled, “I won’t. Don’t worry, if you play some tricks and get me killed, nothing will happen to you. Right, my big sis who’s backing me said that I must deal with everything myself. If I die, she will just bury me, and she won’t avenge me. I’m serious, so you can rest at ease!”

Blood Maiden rolled her eyes at Yang Ye because Yang Ye was growing increasingly cunning.

The figure replied indifferently, “There’s no need to emphasize on the extraordinary expert who backs you. Don’t worry, we won’t play any tricks! However, the Void Space is dangerous on its own. So, don’t blame us if you die there!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t worry, I won’t.”

He walked toward the palace with Blood Maiden!

Meanwhile, the figure didn’t try to stop them!

The ethereal figure really didn’t dare to!

If he tried to stop Yang Ye, he would have to fight Yang Ye. But besides the supreme Void Lord, no one else in the Void World could kill Yang Ye!

But the supreme Void Lord was afraid of the mysterious young girl who was backing Yang Ye!

Moreover, while the Void World had taken the Eternal Kingdom’s side, they were absolutely unwilling to be the Eternal Kingdom’s vanguard and fight Yang Ye to the death!

Simply speaking, no one wanted to offend someone like Yang Ye at a time like this. Even the Eternal Lord and the Soul Master didn’t want to take the initiative to act against him!

Now, it was great so long as he didn’t cause trouble for them!

The figure sighed softly, and the sigh carried some unwillingness and a trace of anger!

Allowing Yang Ye to enter was definitely a humiliation for the Void World!

Suddenly, a voice resounded in the figure’s mind, “If the heavens desires its death, the heavens make it go mad first. Don’t worry about it. It won’t be long before the expert that backs him will vanish from this world. At that time, it will take but a moment to kill him!”

The figure’s displeasure immediately vanished!

…

Once they entered the palace, Yang Ye and Blood Maiden used the teleportation platform to enter the boundless Void Space again.

This time, it was the real Void Space.

Yang Ye gazed at Blood Maiden, “Second Sister, do you have any way to find Eldest Sister or contact her?”

Blood Maiden fell silent for a short while and shook her head, “No, I can’t sense her presence anymore.”

Yang Ye frowned slightly and glanced at the surroundings, “I’m afraid that we’ll only be wasting time by searching each and every space here.”

Blood Maiden gazed at Yang Ye, “Do you have an idea?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I kind of have one.”

He looked up at the sky and grinned, “The living beings in here know this place much better than us. It’ll be much easier if they’re willing to help us!”

Blood Maiden shook her head, “Do you think they will help us?”

Yang Ye smiled, “If they refuse to help, then I won’t leave. Right, I’m going to train with my sword. I’m going to have a good training session here!”
