Chapter 1797 – Did You Get My Permission?

The Undertaker turned to look at An Nanjing, “It’s over!”

His figure vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

An Nanjing’s pupils constricted. She was about to attack when a sword howl suddenly resounded, and then a ray of light tore through the air and arrived before the Undertaker.

The Undertaker frowned slightly and waved his saber horizontally.

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and then the Undertaker was blasted over 60m back.

At this moment, everyone here stopped fighting. They gazed at An Nanjing, or to be more precise, they gazed at the area in front of An Nanjing.

A man in green clothes had suddenly appeared there.

The experts from the Wu Clan were overjoyed at the sight of him, and Ying Yu’s group had unsightly expressions instead.

Because it was Yang Ye!

Yang Ye was here!

Yang Ye’s arrival clearly allowed the Wu Clan to heave a sigh of relief because they could see a chance now.

Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto An Nanjing. He gazed at her empty right shoulder for a long time, and then he said, “I’m sorry for being late.”

She shook her head slightly, “You’re not late!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and turned to look at the Ying Clan’s group, “The Ying Clan, Li Clan, Wang Clan, Lu Clan, and Qin Clan… I, Yang Ye, swear with my soul that I’m willing to be stabbed by a million arrows and die if I don’t annihilate your clans.”

A soul oath!

At this moment, the expressions of all the experts from the Ying Clan’s coalition had turned extremely gloomy. Because Yang Ye had sworn on his soul, and that represented that it was impossible for any reconciliation between them now.

Either Yang Ye or they had to die!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye gently combed An Nanjing’s hair, and then he withdrew two Energy Pearls and passed them to her, “Rest. I guarantee that I’ll make the person who harmed you pay!”

An Nanjing gazed at him and spoke softly, “Be careful.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she took the Energy Pearls and moved aside. She’d exhausted too much of her strength in the continuous battle she’d undergone just now. Now, she had to recover.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye turned to gaze at the Undertaker. The latter sized up Yang Ye and said, “You’re Yang Ye. You….”

His voice stopped abruptly.

Because Yang Ye had vanished on the spot, and a sword arrived just half an inch before his forehead!

Right when the sword was about to pierce through his forehead, the Undertaker vanished on the spot, and he was behind Yang Ye when he appeared again. After that, a blade that was thin as a cicada’s wing shot towards Yang Ye’s nape.

Yang Ye suddenly turned around, and his sword descended.

Bang!

As soon as they came into contact, the space around them shook violently, and then both of them were pushed backwards repeatedly. Yang Ye was pushed over 1km back while the Undertaker wasn’t even pushed 300m back.

The Undertaker clearly had the upper hand in this collision.

However, a solemn expression appeared in the Undertaker’s eyes, “Intent at the Enlightened Rank… How unbelievable!”

Yang Ye glanced at his sword. At this moment, it had actually turned slightly ethereal. Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he glanced at the Undertaker’s blade. There was a trace of curiosity in his eyes.

What is that blade?

It can even slice through Skysplit, and my Sword Precursor would have been shattered too if it wasn’t protected by two Enlightened Rank intents.

Yang Ye fell silent for a few breaths of time, and then he exchanged the Sword Precursor for the wooden sword.

As soon as he saw the wooden sword, the Undertaker’s eyes burned with desire, “Hand that sword over and I’ll spare you! Otherwise….”

He hadn’t even been able to finish speaking before Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

A ray of light flashed.

An instant later, a speck of cold light appeared just a few inches away from the Undertaker’s forehead.

The Undertaker’s eyes instantly turned icy cold, and then he moved his head to the side. The speck of cold light flashed by his ear. At the same time, he bent his right leg slightly and waved his blade at Yang Ye’s stomach.

If it struck Yang Ye, he would definitely be sliced into two!

Right when everyone thought Yang Ye would dodge or defend himself, Yang Ye did something that surprised everyone.

He didn’t dodge and just swung the wooden sword.

He intends to sacrifice himself to kill his opponent?

Such a thought appeared in the minds of everyone.

Meanwhile, when the spectators thought the Undertaker would defend himself, they were surprised again. Because he didn’t do that and continued his swing at Yang Ye’s stomach.

Just like that, Yang Ye’s sword struck the Undertaker’s nape while the Undertaker’s blade struck Yang Ye’s stomach.

Bang! Bang!

Two explosions resounded, and then both of them were pushed around 300m back.

They’re unharmed?

All the spectators were stunned. It didn’t take them long to realize why.

A blood red armor had suddenly appeared before Yang Ye’s chest. It was the armor that the woman in a red dress had given him in Moment Mountain. As for the Undertaker, a violet leather armor had appeared on his too, and it was covered in strange symbols.

Earlier, it was that armor which had stopped Yang Ye’s lethal attack!

Om!

A moment of silence ensued, and then a sword howl resounded before Yang Ye vanished on the spot. He was in front of the Undertaker when he appeared again, and then the wooden sword slashed down while carrying a strand of horrifying energy.

It could be said to be Yang Ye’s strongest attack while not relying on other external sources of strength.

Two Enlightened Rank intents, a few Laws, and his physical strength.

Crack!

As soon as his sword descended, it seemed like a spiderweb was spreading through space.

A vicious glow flashed through the Undertaker’s eyes. He naturally wouldn’t dodge, and he didn’t hesitate to flick his blade upwards.

A direct collision!

Bang!

As soon as they came into contact, the space in an enormous area around them collapsed. However, the collapse of space didn’t make them stop. Conversely, Yang Ye relied on the black hole to grow even stronger.

However, a rumbling explosion suddenly resounded from within the black hole, and then it suddenly started to tremble. A moment later, countless rays of light flickered and sliced against each other. The powerful energy emanated from the black hole forced all the other experts back.

They stared at the black hole without blinking at all. If Yang Ye lost, it was obvious that the Wu Clan may be wiped out from the face of this universe.

Bang!

Suddenly, another loud explosion resounded from within the black hole, and then the rays of light gradually reduced in number. Around ten breaths of time later, everything returned to calm. The black hole was repaired by the Laws of the heavens and the earth too. It had returned to normal. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Yang Ye and the Undertaker’s figures appeared before everyone again.

At this moment, Yang Ye was clearly not in a favorable state. His countenance was pale while dozens of injuries covered his body. Even his face had numerous deep cuts on it. Blood was seeping out incessantly from the injuries, causing Yang Ye’s clothes to be dyed red.

Conversely, the Undertaker was in a much better state.

Even though there were some injuries on him too, it wasn’t severe!

Unsightly expressions covered the faces of the experts from the Wu Clan. As for Ying Yu’s group, they heaved sighs of relief. Obviously, while Yang Ye was a monstrous genius, his realm of cultivation was much inferior, so he couldn’t turn the situation around!

The Undertaker glanced at the injuries on him, and then he looked up at Yang Ye, “I didn’t expect to encounter two extraordinary geniuses when I left Heaven Pillar Mountain. No wonder that wooden sword chose you.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he started walking slowly in Yang Ye’s direction. Every step he took caused space to tremble violently. At the same time, a wave of terrifying aura swept out from him and slammed down at Yang Ye.

The spectators’ hearts shook at the sight of this. They knew that the Undertaker was about to get serious!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye took a step forward, and then two intents swept out from him and actually stopped the Undertaker’s aura.

At the same time, Yang Ye released the wooden sword. The sword floated before him while he placed his left hand on the talisman stuck to his right arm. Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to tear it off slowly, and then his right grasp opened. The wooden sword flew into his grasp.

As soon as he took it in his grasp, the wooden sword shook violently while sword howls resounded incessantly.

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye’s right arm. At this moment, all of them sense a horrifying aura coming from it.

That power came from the right arm.

Strength!

Yang Ye closed his eyes, and his body was trembling. At this moment, he felt like his entire body was filled with strength.

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes and gazed at the Undertaker, “Come! Try an attack of mine!”

As soon as she finished speaking, he stomped his right foot down and vanished on the spot.

The Undertaker’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

Boom!

A deafening explosion resounded, and then the Undertaker was blasted 3km away. As soon as he stopped himself, a wisp of scarlet red seeped out from a corner of his mouth. At the same time, his blade trembled and transformed into pieces that scattered to the ground.

Ying Yu and the others’ expressions turned extremely unsightly at the sight of this, and it only took a moment for Ying Yu to order solemnly, “Retreat!”

The others behind him intended to leave once they heard him.

“Retreat?” Suddenly, Yang Ye gazed at them and smiled fiercely, “Did you get my permission?”
