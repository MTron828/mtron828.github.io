Chapter 2077 – Yang Ye’s Ultimate Move!

What the heck?

Yang Ye was absolutely shocked!

The Fire Sprite glanced at Snowy and fell silent. No one knew what it was thinking. Meanwhile, the small wings on Snowy’s back flapped, and then the black sword just vanished into thin air.

Meanwhile, Snowy opened her mouth and inhaled in the black hole’s direction. In an instant, Yang Ye could clearly see its energy vanishing rapidly.

Suddenly, a furious shout resounded from within the black hole, and then a tiny pitch black little thing that looked like a bunny appeared not too far ahead of them. It was only a little larger than Snowy, completely pitch black, and only its eyes were dark violet. If it was in the dark, perhaps only its eyes would be visible.

At this moment, it was glaring at Yang Ye as if it was about to fight Yang Ye to the death.

Yang Ye pointed at Snowy, “She did it! Stare at her!”

Snowy was speechless.

The Dark Sprite gazed at Snowy. While its eyes were still filled with rage, it had clearly decreased quite a bit. It clenched its little fist and raised it at Snowy. Obviously, it was threatening Snowy!

How could Snowy allow that?

Snowy clenched her little paw too, and then she flashed over to the Dark Sprite and slapped the Dark Sprite’s head.

Bam!

The Dark Sprite was slapped over 30m away.

The Dark Sprite was quite stunned. Obviously, it hadn’t expected Snowy to actually attack it without saying anything!

Shouldn’t we insult each other first before fighting?

Suddenly, Snowy appeared in front of it, and then Yang Ye watched with astonishment as Snowy wrapped her paw around its neck. She was about to slam it against the ground when she suddenly realized that they were in space, not on land.

So, she didn’t know what to do, and she looked back at Yang Ye to seek advice.

The Dark Sprite would naturally not just stand by idly and wait for her. An extremely terrifying wave of dark energy surged out from within it, and it instantly enveloped both Snowy and it. However, not only was Snowy completely unharmed, she even swallowed all of the dark energy!

At this moment, the Dark Sprite was stunned.

Meanwhile, Snowy grabbed the Dark Sprite by the neck with her left paw, and then clenched her right paw before slamming it against the Dark Sprite’s stomach.

Bang!

Just like that, the Dark Sprite was punched away.

Yang Ye couldn’t help but glance at the Fire Sprite. Now, he finally understood why the Fire Sprite hadn’t attacked after seeing Snowy. Perhaps Snowy wasn’t that formidable against humans, but she was absolutely terrifying against Sprites.

The battle was still going on.

Snowy suddenly flew over to the Dark Sprite, and then she waved her paw and slapped its head.

Bam!

The Dark Sprite was slapped flying.

Snowy didn’t stop. She flew over to the Dark Sprite, grabbed its tail, and then started spinning it on the spot but tossing it away.

Waves of terrifying dark energy kept surging out from the Dark Sprite, and even Yang Ye shuddered a little from it. However, they were just nourishment to Snowy, and she devoured every bit of it.

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and gazed at the Fire Sprite, “Didn’t you say there’s a Sprite who doesn’t fear Snowy. What kind of Sprite is that?”

The Fire Sprite fell silent for a moment and replied, “You’ll find out in the future!”

It refused to tell him!

Yang Ye rolled his eyes.

Meanwhile, the Fire Sprite said, “You can tell her to stop now.”

Yang Ye turned around and saw that Snowy was still beating up the Dark Sprite, and the Dark Sprite couldn’t fight back at all. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Yang Ye waved at Snowy, “Snowy, that’s enough!”

Snowy immediately stopped when she heard Yang Ye, and then she flew over to him.

Yang Ye wanted to rub her wings, but as soon as he touched them, they vanished.

Yang Ye was bewildered, “What?”

“Spirit Wings!” The Fire Sprite spoke abruptly, “It’s an ability possessed by Sprite Lords. She can converge the spirit energy in the world to greatly increase her own strength. However, it exhausts a huge amount of her strength. Just that fight exhausted her completely. So, her wings vanished!”

Yang Ye smiled, rubbed her little head, and said, “So my Snowy is this strong!”

Snowy smiled brilliantly when she heard Yang Ye praise her, and then she rubbed her head against Yang Ye’s head.

Yang Ye gazed at the Dark Sprite, and so did Snowy. The Dark Sprite shuddered when it saw Snowy look at it, and it hurriedly moved 300m away while fear filled its eyes.

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “We didn’t come here to harm you, we want you to come with us.”

Yang Ye gazed at the Fire Sprite and continued, “Can you explain everything to it?”

The Fire Sprite nodded and started talking to the Dark Sprite. Some time later, the Dark Sprite shot a furtive glance at Snowy before shaking its head.

Yang Ye gazed at the Fire Sprite, and the latter said, “It’s afraid she’ll attack!”

Yang Ye didn’t know whether to laugh or cry, “Tell it that so long as it doesn’t bully Snowy, Snowy won’t bully it.”

The Fire Sprite nodded and continued talking with the Dark Sprite, but it still shook its head.

Yang Ye was about to say something when Snowy suddenly flew over to the Dark Sprite. She grabbed it by the ear and started waving her other claw incessantly. A short while passed before the Dark Sprite kept nodding!

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, In the end, the first is more effective!

Just like that, the Dark Sprite joined them, and Yang Ye immediately took them back to the prehistoric ruins.

In overall, everything went smoothly. Of course, it was mainly because of Snowy. If it wasn’t for Snowy, these Sprites would have probably just ignored him. Especially the Fire Sprite and Dark Sprite. Because if they really entered into battle, then he would probably be unable to defeat them in their own territory!

Yang Ye flew swiftly through space. The Dark Sprite and Fire Sprite were on either side of him. He hadn’t allowed them to enter the Primordial Pagoda. It wasn’t that he refused to trust them, it was because he felt safer with them by his side!

Especially the Dark Sprite. Its senses were simply horrifying. So long as darkness covered the area, it could even clearly sense things from hundreds of thousands of kilometers away, and it was much, much greater than the capabilities of Yang Ye’s Laws of Darkness!

The journey back wasn’t smooth. Yang Ye stopped at a spot in the starry sky because an old man was standing not too far ahead, and the old man seemed like he was waiting for Yang Ye!

The old man didn’t just seem to be waiting for Yang Ye, he was waiting for Yang Ye!

The old man was none other than the Sage who’d almost killed him that day!

The old man sized up the Fire Sprite and Dark Sprite beside Yang Ye and said, “Sprites… Yang Ye, I really envy you. You were actually able to collect such Sprites. Amazing, truly amazing!”

Yang Ye suddenly grabbed the Dark Sprite and Fire Sprite, and then he put them within the Primordial Pagoda.

The old man started walking slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, “My Sage Alliance had no choice but to work with Heaven Secret Hall to find you. Now that the Weapon Path isn’t here to help you, will you still be able to survive?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Of course I can’t. I have a last wish before I die. I have one last ultimate move, and I want to use it before I die, so that I can see the true gap between me and a Sage. Can I?”

“Your ultimate move?” The old man glanced at Yang Ye and smiled, “Of course. Come, let me see what it is.”

He naturally didn’t fear that Yang Ye would be able to escape. Because unless someone helped Yang Ye, Yang Ye would definitely be unable to escape.

Yang Ye nodded and took a step forward. In an instant, a wave of mysterious energy appeared here.

The Sword Domain!

A smile curled up on the old man’s face when he saw Yang Ye use the Sword Domain. There was no ridicule on his face because while Yang Ye’s strength was inferior to him, if he were to be honest, he really admired Yang Ye for being able to possess such strength at that age.

Yang Ye waved his hands. In an instant, around 100 ethereal swords appeared, and then the space in the surroundings started to tremble. The old man’s eyes narrowed while he slowly clenched his right fist.

Even though he was confident, he refused to be careless.

Suddenly, a wave of profound energy surged out from within Yang Ye. In an instant, almost 10,000 rays of light appeared in the surroundings. These rays of sword energy instantly filled the space within Yang Ye’s Sword Domain. Meanwhile, the old man suddenly stretched out his right hand and clenched it gently. The space within Yang Ye’s Sword Domain instantly warped, and then it was minced into bits.

Three breaths of time later, all the sword energy had vanished.

However, the old man’s face was extremely unsightly because Yang Ye was nowhere to be found.

Yang Ye was gone!

The old man’s divine sense covered a huge area, but there was no sign of Yang Ye.

It was like Yang Ye had vanished into thin air!

“Dammit!” An extremely gloomy expression covered his face.
