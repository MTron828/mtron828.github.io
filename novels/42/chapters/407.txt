Chapter 408 – Xiao Tianji!

“As expected of the Martial God! What a formidable Divine Sense!” At this moment, a grey robed old man suddenly appeared in front of Luo Feng. After he descended to the ground, the old man gazed at Luo Feng and shook his head as he said, “Why can’t you change that bad habit of yours? If you don’t, then you’ll be destroyed because of your own doing one day!”

Luo Feng remained silent. At this moment, he knew who he’d offended, it was the Martial God of this era. Perhaps the Martial God’s present strength wasn’t capable of threatening the Exalted Han Empire right now, but what about the future? Needless to say, he’d bit off more than he could chew and offended an extraordinary expert for the Exalted Han Empire!

The old man turned around to gaze at An Nanjing, and then he said, “We have no intention to become enemies with you. That incident from before was our mistake. You’ve already killed nine dragons and an attendant, so how about we let the matter rest?”

“No!” An Nanjing said, “I really can’t kill him with you protecting him. But don’t worry, I’ll be able to kill him one day! The Exalted Han Empire? One day, I, An Nanjing, will head over and pay it a visit!”

As soon as she finished speaking, An Nanjing turned around and walked towards the combat arena.

When they heard An Nanjing, the expressions of Luo Feng and the old man had instantly changed. An Nanjing’s words had transformed enmity between just her and Luo Feng into enmity that was between two powers! Head over to pay the Exalted Han Empire a visit? If an ordinary person had spoken these words, then the two of them would definitely scoff at it, and they wouldn’t take it seriously even if it was a Monarch Realm expert who spoke these words!

However, the weight it carried was completely different when it was spoken by the Martial God!

A wisp of killing intent flashed through the depths of the old man’s eyes. Right at this moment, An Nanjing suddenly stopped and said, “I’m not killing him now merely out of consideration for my clan. After all, my clan has even more important affairs to attend to, and it doesn’t have any residual strength to engage with your Exalted Han Empire. It’s not because I can’t kill him, understand?”

The old man’s heart shook as he said, “An Nanjing.... You’re from the An Clan!” At this moment, there was no killing intent in his eyes anymore, and there was only fear and shock.

An Nanjing didn’t answer the old man. She walked up the arena, and then she glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Staying alive is the most important!” She immediately walked off to the side and fell silent after she spoke those words.

Yang Ye rubbed his nose. He was naturally aware that staying alive was the most important. However, would they let him live? He’d killed the Crown Prince of the Exalted Han Empire, and he’d even refined the Crown Prince into a puppet. So, how could they possibly let him off?

Meanwhile, the grey robed old man’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye, and he sized Yang Ye up before he said, “Your strength is pretty good. You’ve actually cultivated the Sword Dao to such an extent at such a young age. No wonder you were able to kill Mu Jun. Mu Jun’s death can be attributed to his lack of strength, and it was fate. My Exalted Han Empire has no desire to avenge him. However, the Mortal Emperor Armor, Mortal Emperor Seal, and Immortal Binding Rope are precious treasures of my Exalted Han Empire, so you must hand them over. Besides that, it’s said that others witnessed you taking Mu Jun’s corpse. Even though he’s dead, he’s still the Crown Prince of my Exalted Han Empire, so how can his corpse possibly fall to the hands of an outside? Hand it over as well!”

His voice was flat, yet it carried an indisputable tone.

Yang Ye turned around to look at Qian Huan, and he said, “Senior, there’s nothing wrong with taking the possessions of the other party to the battles during the Hidden Dragon Rankings, right? Moreover, the Hidden Dragon Rankings hasn’t come to an end right now, yet someone has openly threatened a participant in the rankings. Could it be that this isn’t a violation of the rules?”

The grey robed old man laughed coldly when he heard Yang Ye, and then a wisp of ridicule arose on the corners of his mouth.

Qian Huan pondered deeply for a moment before he said, “You’re right, it isn’t wrong to take the possessions of the other party to the battles in the Hidden Dragon Rankings. It’s your right to take your opponent’s possessions. However, the Hidden Dragon Rankings have come to an end now, so it’s a private matter between you and them. I have no authority or reason to interfere!”

Actually, the decision of whether it had ended was entirely dependent on him. If he had the intention to protect Yang Ye, then the Hidden Dragon Rankings would be considered to have not ended yet and vice versa.

Protect Yang Ye? What reason did he have to do that? He had none!

Yang Ye immediately laughed coldly when he heard this. As expected, all rules are useless before formidable strength!

Meanwhile, the grey robed old man said, “You originally just had to hand over those three treasures of my Exalted Han Empire. But I’ve changed my mind now. You have to hand over everything that belonged to Mu Jun. Of course, you can refuse, but you’ll definitely be unable to bear the consequences of that decision!”

“As expected of the Exalted Han Empire. You truly are overbearing!” Right at this moment, light laughter suddenly resounded, and then a middle aged man who leaned on a walking stick and had a piece of white cloth covering his eyes had appeared here.

“Xiao Tianji!”

The expressions of Qian Huan, the grey robed old man, and the representatives from the other sects had immediately changed. The name Xiao Tianji could be said to be extremely renowned throughout the continent. Besides the mysterious and unfathomable strength he possessed, Xiao Tianji was famous because he could predict the future and see through the workings of the heavens!

His ability to see through the workings of the heavens was the real reason he was terrifying! Moreover, his wisdom was terrifyingly shocking as well. Even though the people of the continent respected the strong, when one’s wisdom had arrived at a certain level, then that person could kill imperceptibly. Because their schemes would very likely cause one to offend numerous others without even realizing it and gain numerous enemies....

So, even if the Xiao Clan had never had more than 3 members throughout history, it had been able to survive in the continent for 10,000 years. It was none other than because no power dared to rashly offend the Xiao Clan. Conversely, many powers even tried to stay on friendly terms with the Xiao Clan. Because just a single word from the Xiao Clan might be able to allow their sects to escape calamity!

However, the members of the Xiao Clan had always been elusive, so Qian Huan and the others wondered why Xiao Tianji would make an appearance in the Ancient Battlefield.

Xiao Tianji paid no attention to the grey robed old man, and he walked slowly towards Yang Ye instead. Yang Ye frowned when he saw this middle aged man walk towards him. Even though the middle aged man’s eyes were covered by a piece of white cloth, Yang Ye had the feeling that the middle aged man could see him, and this feeling of his was extremely strong!

Xiao Tianji nodded lightly to Yang Ye, and then he said, “Not bad. You’re like a brilliant blade with condensed Sword Intent. An extraordinary genius in the Sword Dao indeed. Oh, right. I forget to introduce myself. I’m Yuxi’s father, your future father-in-law. That’s correct, right?”

Yuxi’s father? My future father-in-law?

Yang Ye was instantly stunned. This middle aged man is Xiao Yuxi’s father? But future father-in-law.... He suddenly thought about everything that had happened between them....

Yang Ye smiled with embarrassment, and then he bowed to the middle aged man and said, “Father-in-law!”

Since he dared to act, then he dared to bear the consequences of his actions. Since their relationship had already come to that, how could he possibly be worthy of Xiao Yuxi if he were to act hesitantly and feign ignorance when her father had come looking for him?

A wisp of a smile instantly arose on the corners of Xiao Tianji’s mouth when he heard how Yang Ye addressed him, and then he said, “Very good. Yuxi didn’t misjudge you. Do you know that if you used any excuses to avoid it, then regardless of how reasonable those excuses were, there would be no need for those fellows from the Exalted Han Empire to make a move against you because I would have killed you myself! Fortunately, you didn’t disappoint me, and you didn’t disappoint Yuxi!”

Yang Ye couldn’t help but laugh bitterly when he heard this. So this father-in-law of mine actually had the intention to kill me....

Meanwhile, the grey robed old man said in a low voice, “Xiao Tianji, my Exalted Han Empire and your Xiao Clan has always stayed out of each other’s business. Could it be that you intend to become enemies with my Exalted Han Empire this time?” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Xiao Tianji turned around and said to the grey robed old man, “You’re the Exalted Han Empire’s Luo Yan, right?”

“So what if I am!?” The grey robed old man spoke in a cold voice.

Xiao Tianji shook his head and said, “Out of consideration for how difficult it was to attain your realm of cultivation, I’ll give you a piece of advice. Return to the Exalted Han Empire right now and do it at the quickest speed you can muster. Otherwise, you’ll never be able to return there again! As for my son-in-law, you don’t have to worry about him. His life isn’t destined to end. At the very least, it isn’t destined to end today because I’m here!”

The grey robed old man’s expression instantly became unsightly. If it was anyone else who said that he might perish today, then he would definitely scoff at it, but it wasn’t the same when these words were spoken by Xiao Tianji!

The grey robed old man hesitated for a short while before a wisp of a ruthless expression flashed through his eyes. He said, “Xiao Tianji, could it be that you thought that I would fall for it and leave obediently? Let me tell you that you were mistaken! If that fellow, Yang Ye, doesn’t hand over those three treasures of my Exalted Han Empire, then he’ll definitely be unable to leave the Ancient Battlefield!”

Xiao Tianji shook his head and said, “It’s too late for you to leave now....”

As soon as he finished speaking, an unexpected event occurred....
