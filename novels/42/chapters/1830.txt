Chapter 1831 – Guess My Ass!

Guess who!

A chill ran down Yang Ye’s spine!

Someone had actually appeared behind him and covered his eyes!

Who was it?

How did that person do it?

After all, he was an absolute grandmaster when it came to concealment. Because he didn’t just possess the Laws of Darkness, he had the Spatial Laws too. It could be said that even an ant in a huge area around him couldn’t escape his notice.

However, someone had appeared out of thin air behind him and covered his eyes.

Yang Ye forced himself to calm down. He didn’t attack and asked, “Do I get something if I’m correct?”

A moment of silence ensued, and then the voice resounded, “Yes, you’ll die right away; you’ll die slowly if you’re wrong!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Meanwhile, the voice resounded again, “Guess!”

“Guess my ass!” As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, two types of terrifying intents swept out from him while he twisted his right foot against the ground.

Hiss!

His figure transformed into a ray of light that appeared over 100m away.

Om!

A moment later, a sword howl resounded, and then a ray of sword energy flashed. But it only took a moment for a solemn expression to appear on Yang Ye’s face.

A woman in a black dress was floating not too far away from him. She seemed to be just around the age of 15. Her long hair hung down past her shoulder and stopped near her lower back. Besides that, she had a young appearance, an icy cold gaze, and emanated a vicious aura that made others fear looking straight at her!

All of that wasn’t even important!

The important part was that Yang Ye’s sword energy was right in front of her, and there were two pure white fingers at the tip of it.

They’d clamped down onto Yang Ye’s sword energy!

The sword energy seemed like it was frozen on the spot.

The young girl gazed coldly at Yang Ye, and then she pressed down slightly.

Yang Ye’s sword energy shook violently, and then…

Yang Ye watched with astonishment as the sword energy was obliterated.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “My guess… my guess is you’re female!”

The young girl said, “It’s too late now!!

As soon as she finished speaking, she stomped her right foot down. Yang Ye’s expression changed at the exact same moment.

A small black footprint had suddenly appeared in the space above him. There was only a footprint there, and she wasn’t there!

Yang Ye didn’t have the time to think. He just raised his sword and swung it.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was blasted over 1km away. As soon as he stopped himself, a pair of black footprints suddenly appeared around 1m away from him.

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted slightly while his profound energy surged madly. A moment later, he raised his sword and stabbed.

He hadn’t dared to hold back at all!

However, it struck nothing. Right when Yang Ye was about to pull his sword back, two hands coiled around the tip of his sword before moving along his sword towards him.

It was so swift that he couldn’t dodge in time at all!

Those hands slammed against his chest.

Boom!

A muffled explosion resounded as Yang Ye’s body was blasted over 3km away.

This time, the young girl didn’t follow up with another attack.

She glanced coldly at Yang Ye, and then her gaze descended onto his chest. The clothes there had vanished, and there was a pair of overlapped red palm prints there. The red palm prints had caused his skin to sink down, but Yang Ye’s skin hadn’t been penetrated. Conversely, the injury was healing rapidly at a visible speed.

The young girl frowned, “Your skin is that thick?”

Yang Ye looked down at his chest, and then he looked up at her, “An ancient cultivator?”

“Ancient cultivator?” Her frown grew deeper, “What’s that?”

Yang Ye was speechless.

Suddenly, she said, “Come! Let’s continue!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished on the spot. At the same time, a pair of black footprints appeared around 1m away from Yang Ye.

This time, Yang Ye didn’t swing his sword. A moment later, a pair of hands that were covered in black flowing light appeared within his field of vision, and their target was his throat! Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Yang Ye’s sword suddenly moved when they were about to wrap around his throat.

Bang!

The hands slammed against his throat, causing Yang Ye’s face to warp while his figure was blasted away.

However, a strand of blood flew into the air while his figure was blasted away.

The blood didn’t belong to him!

The surrounding suddenly fell silent.

The young girl glanced at her right hand. There was an injury that stretched for around 10cm on her right wrist. It was extremely deep and had sliced through her hand. Even the bones within were clearly visible.

She ignored the injury on her hand and looked up at Yang Ye, “You’ve injured me!”

At this moment, Yang Ye’s face was still warped from pain!

He hadn’t defended himself and used his throat to strike his opponent. Needless to say, it was very risky. Fortunately, his body had forcefully resisted her attack. But it wasn’t a very pleasant experience.

Because he could sense that his throat had cracked open from inside out, but it wasn’t a lethal injury!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and gazed at her. Dammit!

He’d taken such a risk with the intent of taking one of her hands, but he’d underestimated her reaction!

She hadn’t given him the chance at all. As soon as his sword pierced her skin, she’d immediately withdrawn her hand and slammed a powerful wave of energy against his sword. He’d been blasted away because he’d suffered two attacks just now!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and asked, “Why are you trying to kill me?”

Her strength was really too terrifying. If his physical body hadn’t been improved previously, he may be dead now. Her movement technique and attacks were too mysterious and shocking!

Meanwhile, the young girl suddenly started walking slowly in Yang Ye’s direction. She walked as she said, “She said that no one is allowed to come here. Anyone who does must die!”

She vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched, and he stomped his right foot down.

Boom!

The space in a huge area shook violently, and then a ray of light flashed.

Split Second!

Split Second that was enhanced by two types of Enlightened Rank intents and his physical strength. As soon as it appeared, the space in an enormous area was blasted apart by the energy it carried.

Space cracked open like a spiderweb!

Meanwhile, a black circle of light appeared in the space before Yang Ye. It was very small in the beginning, but when Yang Ye’s sword energy arrived before it, it instantly expanded and enveloped Yang Ye’s sword energy.

Boom!

As soon as they came into contact, a resounding explosion rumbled through the surroundings.

Meanwhile, numerous rays of light shot up into the air from within the black circle of light. Those rays of sword energy tore open the circle of light, but it only took a moment for a few more circles of light to appear out of thin air. They instantly devoured Yang Ye’s sword energy.

Rumble!

Explosions resounded incessantly in the sky. At this moment, the space throughout the peak of Nether Mountain was trembling violently. It was like an earthquake.

Around 15 minutes later, a figure was blasted over 6km away!

It was Yang Ye!

As his figure flew away, the sky gradually returned to calm.

After he stopped himself, a wisp of blood gradually seeped out of the corner of Yang Ye’s mouth. He wiped it off and looked up at the young girl. At this moment, there were three black circles of light floating around her, and they emanated a cold aura.

Meanwhile, she suddenly said, “You’re the most resistant person I’ve seen in years!”

Yang Ye’s expression became quite awkward. Resistant? What kind of description is that? But it did make sense because during the battle just now, Yang Ye had been passively suffering attacks. His sword energy had actually been suppressed by her!

Completely suppressed!

Even his Enlightened Rank sword intent couldn’t change the situation! Fortunately, he hadn’t suffered any real damage as well. Or it should be said that even if he had suffered a serious injury, it was healed by now!

That was the most terrifying part about him!

Who is she? Yang Ye frowned.

Meanwhile, she suddenly tapped her finger forward, and then one of the circles of light appeared above Yang Ye. A strand of sword energy shot up into the air, and it easily sliced open the space before it. However, as soon as it came into contact with the black circle of light, the sword energy stopped, and then it slowly became ethereal and vanished!

A wisp of viciousness flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes. He pressed his index and middle fingers together before tapping it forward. A strand of flames shot out from his fingers, and it instantly enveloped the circle of light. An instant later, the circle of light was completely incinerated!

The Divine Yin Flame!

“That flame isn’t bad!” Meanwhile, she spoke abruptly, “You have quite a few treasures! Come! Let me see what else you have!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she flipped her right palm, and a ring with a small black dragon on it appeared on her palm.

Yang Ye was about to attack when Blood Maiden suddenly appeared by his side. Yang Ye was stunned by this, and he was about to say something. However, Blood Maiden suddenly bowed to the young girl while Yang Ye watched with astonishment.
