Chapter 518 – Cooperation!

The woman removed her veil to remove a drop dead gorgeous appearance before Yang Ye’s eyes.

“Yang Ye, right.... I should call you the Sword Emperor. Long time no see!” The woman blinked at him as she smiled.

Yang Ye smiled bitterly. Never had he imagined that this woman would actually be Yin Xuan’er whom he’d almost forgotten about. He said, “I never expected that it would be Miss Yin. No wonder I didn’t hear anything about you in the southern territory. So you’ve come to the central territory.”

“It’s Xuan’er!” Yin Xuan’er glared at him, and then she walked over to him and said with a smile on her face, “You haven’t heard about me, but I frequently hear rumors about you. Like how you attacked the Flower Palace by yourself and even destroyed the tombs of its ancestors, or how you killed your way into the central territory and made all the geniuses here tremble with fear upon hearing your name. Husband, you really are impressive! As expected of my husband!”

Husband?

Po Xing and Po Kong’s expressions changed, and their gazes towards Yang Ye had become even more hostile.

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched as he said, “Miss Yin, there isn’t any relationship between us, right?”

“Husband!” The smile on her face was instantly exchanged for an aggrieved expression, and there was even a layer of mist on her eyes as she said, “What... what did you promise my father that day? You promised that you would take good care of me. What? So you’ve forgotten me now that you have the Sword Sect’s Su Qingshi? How unfaithful of you!”

Po Xing and Po Kong opened their eyes wide as they watched Yin Xuan’er act in this way, and their jaws had almost hit the ground. Is this the same Princess who’s usually acts swiftly and decisively and doesn’t even spare a glance at others?

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched as he gazed at the pitiable appearance she revealed, and a strand of desire arose within his body. Fortunately, he possessed the Enlightened Sword Heart, and he hurriedly suppressed it before he shook his head and said, “Miss Yin, can we speak normally? I admit that you’re very beautiful, and your techniques in seduction are even better than before. However, you should be clearly aware that I’m a sword cultivator, and I’m even one who has comprehended Sword Intent and the Enlightened Sword Heart. Do you think it would affect me at all?”

“Seduction techniques? You’re saying that I used seduction techniques against you?” Yin Xuan’er blinked and couldn’t help but chuckle.

Yang Ye remained silent in response to this.

“Alright. We haven’t seen each other for a very long time, and I have many things to ask you. I presume you have a huge number of things to ask me as well, right?” Yin Xuan’er smiled as she said, “Come, I’ve just subdued the Killer Crocodiles of this swamp, so let’s go to its palace.” As she spoke, she didn’t hesitate at all to wrap her hands around Yang Ye’s arm and walk towards the distance.

“I have two friends....” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Po Xing, Po Kong, Go over and bring my Husband’s friends to the palace. Remember to be courteous, otherwise, I’ll skill the two of you alive!”

...

There was a very grand palace at the bottom of the swamp, and Yang Ye was quite surprised by it because he hadn’t expected that there would be ‘another world’ beneath the swamp.

As she gazed at the grand palace in front of her, Yin Xuan’er who was holding onto Yang Ye’s hand nodded, and then she said to the man in front of her who was completely covered in golden scales. “Jin Sha, I never expected that you would have created such a grand palace underground. I presume there are a huge amount of treasures within it, right!?”

The man called Jin Sha had a slightly uncomfortable expression because all these treasures that he’d accumulated would cease to be his soon.

Yin Xuan’er paid no attention to him, and she just pulled Yang Ye’s hand as she walked towards the distance.

“While I was still at the southern territory, the Grand Preceptor found out that the southern territory would fall into great chaos, so he broke open the barrier between territories and allowed me to travel to the central territory. I originally intended to bring you along with me because the natural talent you possessed would definitely allow you to rise to prominence in the central territory. However, I knew that you wouldn’t follow me, and you would hate me forever if I forced you to come with me!” Yin Xuan’er spoke slowly within the palace.

“The Grand Preceptor knew?” Yang Ye frowned.

Yin Xuan’er pulled on Yang Ye’s hand and walked towards Jin Sha’s treasury as she said, “Of course he did. It was the Grand Preceptor who helped Luo Jun become the Mortal Emperor! But don’t worry, we aren’t on the same side at him, and we were just using each other.”

Yang Ye sighed lightly and said, “Your objective is to destroy the Grand Qin Empire and the six great powers of the southern territory, right?”

Yin Xuan’er shook her head and smiled. “That’s not our only objective. Our main objective is to rebuild our kingdom.”

“Rebuilding a kingdom....” Yang Ye was about to say something when Yin Xuan’er interrupted him. We’re here. Let’s see what treasures the Killer Crocodile Clan possesses. Right, feel free to take anything you like. You’re my husband, so what’s mine is yours!”

Jin Sha had a huge amount of treasures. There were all sorts of herbs and rare ores, and there were even some human treasures. However, all of them were extremely inferior when compared to the treasures within the White Dragon’s abode. After all, the weakest weapon he used was a Pseudo Dao Artifact, so ordinary things weren’t attractive to him at all.

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto a crystalline mask. He walked over and picked it up. It felt smooth and very soft to the touch.

“That mask, the Jade Mask, is something I obtained from a human profounder.” Jin Sha said, “It’s a mid-grade Heaven Rank treasure, and others won’t be able to see your face clearly once you wear it. Moreover, you can even change your appearance when necessary. However, it exhausts a huge amount of profound energy!”

It can change my appearance? Yang Ye grinned, and then he placed the mask within his spatial ring while Jin Sha gazed at it with reluctance, and then Yang Ye said, “Since that mask is a mid-grade Heaven Rank treasure, its effects are probably not that simple, right!?”

“When that human activated the mask at that time, it created countless ‘mask phantoms’, and every single one of them possessed fairly strong offensive abilities. However, they weren’t able to break through my defenses!” Jin Sha spoke with slight pride.

Yin Xuan’er said, “Jin Sha, go gather all the adult Killer Crocodiles in your clan and ask them to wait outside for me.”

Jin Sha glanced reluctantly at all those treasures, and then he left the room.

Yang Ye smiled. “He seems quite unwilling to me!”

Yin Xuan’er said, “He will be. If he truly isn’t willing, then I’ll just kill him.”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “Miss Yin, I presume you didn’t just bring me here to take some treasure, right? You know how I’m like. I really dislike beating around the bust, so just tell me if you have something to say.”

Yin Xuan’er released Yang Ye’s arm, and then she faced him and said seriously, “I told you just now that I wanted to rebuild my kingdom, and I hope that you’ll help me do it. Of course, I won’t make you help for nothing, and you can list your conditions. Even if you really want to become my husband, it’s not completely out of the question. In any case, your identity as the Sword Emperor makes you worthy of me!” She was very clearly aware of Yang Ye’s appeal, and he could definitely draw countless sword cultivators over to him.

“Become your husband?” Yang Ye shook his head and chuckled. “Miss Yin, you mean become your puppet, right?”

“I don’t have the ability to make you my puppet!” Yin Xuan’er said, “We can really get married if you’re willing. However, you must marry into my Shang Clan. Once I succeed at rebuilding the kingdom, then our future child shall be the Emperor of the Shang Dynasty. Moreover, if you agree, then I’ll do everything within my power to help you seize the World Portrait.”

Yang Ye didn’t refuse or agree, and he just asked. “What exactly do you want from me?” Yang Ye didn’t think that she’d fallen in love with him, so she definitely wanted something if she was willing to sacrifice herself to rope him over to her side.

“Your future!” Yin Xuan’er said, “If I said that it was because I loved you, then even I wouldn’t believe that. Even though I have a good impression of you, it really isn’t to the extent of being described as love. But it’s fine because I don’t hate you. As for feelings, those are things that can be fostered through time.”

“What if I’m a failure or disappoint you in the future?” said Yang Ye with a smile on his face.

Yin Xuan’er smiled. “Then I can only blame myself for being blind!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a while before he said, “Miss Yin, I actually think there’s no need for me to marry into your Shang Clan. You want to rebuild your kingdom while I want to take revenge, so our objectives conform with each other for now. Since it’s like that, then we can just cooperate. What do you think?”

“Cooperate?”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Since you’ve come to the central territory, I feel that you definitely have grand plans. If I’m not wrong, you intend to rebuild your kingdom in the central territory and not the southern territory, right?”

“Yes!” Yin Xuan’er said, “The energy within the southern territory is growing scarce, and it’ll be abandoned, sooner or later.”

Yang Ye said, “If you want to rebuild your kingdom in the central territory, then you definitely have to go against the Exalted Han Empire because that colossus will absolutely not allow you to rebuild your kingdom right under its nose. Since it’s like that, then we have a common enemy, and in that way, we can join forces against the Exalted Han Empire. What do you think?”

Yin Xuan’er said, “In the end, you just don’t want to marry me, right?”

Yang Ye said, “Miss Yin, do you think we would be happy if we unite because of our respective objectives? Moreover, I’m already married.”

“I told you that we can slowly foster our relationship!” Yin Xuan’er said, “As for you wives, what about that? My father had countless wives.”

Yang Ye was speechless.

A short while passed before Yang Ye said seriously, “Miss Yin, what exactly do you want from me?”

“I want to give birth to you children!” Yin Xuan’er blinked at him.

Yang Ye frowned while Yin Xuan’er cracked a smile and said, “Alright, I was joking. Since you want to cooperate, then we will. In any case, I’m going to fight for the World Portrait as well. So, we’ll definitely be able to succeed if we join forces.”

“You’re going to fight for it as well?” asked Yang Ye.

“Of course!” Yin Xuan’er said, “How would we be able to rebuild our kingdom if something like the World Portrait fell into Luo Jun’s hands? Of course, it can’t fall into your hands as well because you’ll definitely give it to the Grand Qin Empire or Darkbeast Empire. Of course, we can still join forces against our enemies until the World Portrait has acknowledged its master!”

“Alright!”
