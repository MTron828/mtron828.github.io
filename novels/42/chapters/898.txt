Chapter 899 – Brothers! Charge!

A hundred swords shot up into the sky, and they remained silent for an instant before they descended towards the ocean of wolves!

As soon as they descended, sword energy swept out from within them and instantly transformed over a thousand wolves into chunks of flesh!

Those swords seemed like they were alive while under Yang Ye’s control, and they flashed incessantly through the pack.... Rays of light flashed horizontally and vertically through the pack while howls of sorrow resounded incessantly!

“Is that freak a body cultivator or sword cultivator?” Yu Wujiao’s eyes were filled with shock. It wasn’t just her, the others around her were the same. It was especially so for the green robed sword cultivator from the Ancient Sword School. At this moment, he finally realized that what Yang Ye said about his sword energy being insufficient was no exaggeration. It really was insufficiently strong.

No, it should be called very weak!

“Kill!” Yu Wushuang’s voice suddenly resounded.

The battle intent within the group blazed once more when they heard her, and they sped up and hurriedly followed behind Yang Ye who’d descended back to the ground.

Aowu!

A howl suddenly resounded from within the pack, and then the myriad of wolves here howled in unison before they charged at Yang Ye’s group!

How terrifying was the aura emanated by tens of thousands of wolves that were dashing madly in unison?

The pack hadn’t even gotten close to them yet many of them felt suffocated before the aura and pressure which came from the pack of wolves. However, they suddenly felt at ease because Yang Ye alone had completely blocked off the aura!

As they watched him stand before the pack of wolves and resist their aura on his own, there was a trace of respect gradually forming in their eyes.

It didn’t take long for their group to charge into the pack of wolves.

As soon as they did, they immediately transformed into a black dot within the ocean. Because there were truly too many wolves around them, and the wolves were too huge. So, they were like grass within a forest when they entered the pack.

Even though they were drowned within the sea of wolves, they still smashed through all obstruction with the help of Yang Ye’s swords that were opening up the path ahead. Because no demon beast could stop Yang Ye’s footsteps!

“What a human! You actually forced me to rush over from Ocean of Clouds City!” Suddenly, a voice resounded, and then the wolves around them immediately stopped attacking and moved backwards instead. As for the wolves in front of Yang Ye, they moved aside and created a path.

A middle aged man appeared within their fields of vision.

A high rank Half-Saint!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly when he saw the middle aged man, whereas the expressions of the others standing behind Yang Ye had changed drastically while they slowed down quite a bit.

“Don’t stop! Speed up!” Yang Ye’s voice resounded in their ears.

All of them looked towards Yang Ye when they heard this, and the battle intent within their eyes blazed once more when they saw him speed up as well.

“A high rank Half-Saint is nothing! Charge!” Hao Shuaibo who’d become immersed in the slaughter roared furiously while he increased his speed to its limits.

“A high rank Half-Saint is nothing! Kill! Kill!!!”

“Kill....”

At this moment, their will to fight had risen to its peak. Even though they knew deep inside that they were no match for a high rank Half-Saint, the pride and hot blood deep within them were aroused when they saw Yang Ye charge at the high rank Half-Saint, so the fear they had towards that high rank Half-Saint had been completely suppressed!

“What a futile effort!” A wisp of ridicule arose on the corners of the middle aged man’s mouth. He took a step forward and used his right hand to make a clawing motion towards Yang Ye from afar.

Bang!

A huge wolf claw that was over 1km wide tore through space and appeared before Yang Ye and the others, and then it clawed down at them and intended to transform them into mush!

The energy contained within the huge claw was terrifying to the extreme. The space around them had immediately started warping when it appeared in the air above them, and the ground beneath their feet started to crack apart and crumble, causing Yang Ye and the others to have no choice but to rise up into the air!

Despair appeared once again in the eyes of the group behind Yang Ye when they faced the huge claw....

After all, it wasn’t something that they could resist!

“Don’t stop and speed up!” Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s voice resounded once more, and a sword howl resounded along with his voice.

They looked up and saw Yang Ye transform into a ray of light that shot into the sky, and the Herculean Sword in his grasp smashed towards the huge claw! At the same time, the pressure which came from the huge claw had instantly vanished without a trace, and the comparatively weaker wolves in the surroundings were lying flat on the ground!

Sword intent!3rd level Heaven Rank sword intent!

All of them were stunned when they sensed Yang Ye’s sword intent, and then they were shocked before feeling overjoyed!

Bang!

The sword smashed against the huge claw, and the space throughout the sky trembled violently before the huge claw exploded into pieces.

“A high rank Half-Saint is nothing! Kill!” Someone shouted loudly upon witnessing this scene, and the others felt their blood boil while their will to fight rose to an unprecedented height!

The middle aged man’s face turned grim when he saw his attack being dispersed, and a ferocious expression surged onto his face. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly transformed into a ray of light which arrived in the air above him, and then a huge sword smashed down towards him from above.

“You’re courting death!” The middle aged man roared furiously and smashed his fist forward!

The sword and fist collided!

Bang!

A huge explosion resounded as the ground beneath the middle aged man’s feet crumbled. However, the middle aged man didn’t fall down with it and stood in midair instead. Conversely, the huge sword was trembling violently and seemed like it was about to be bounced back.

Even then, the middle aged man had a solemn expression in his eyes.

A moment of silence ensued before Yang Ye suddenly raised the sword, and then he swiftly smashed it down again!

This time, he hadn’t held back at all!

As soon as the sword descended, space was instantly shattered apart!

The middle aged man’s pupils constricted. He didn’t dare act carelessly at all, and he raised both his arms to defend against this attack!

Bang!

All the students of the academy and the demon beasts in the surroundings watched as the middle aged man was smashed into the ground.

The demon beasts were astounded, and they couldn’t help but move back repeatedly. On the other hand, the battle intent within Leng Yuran and the others grew even stronger. At this moment, those demon beasts were nothing to them!

“Human! You’ve succeeded at infuriating me!” Suddenly, a furious howl resounded from beneath the ground, and then an explosion resounded as a colossus shot up into the air!

A huge black wolf that emanated a monstrous and terrifying aura appeared within their fields of vision. The wolf was over 50m tall and 30m wide, and just a single one of its claws was larger than the size of their entire group!

With such a colossus obstructing their path, they couldn’t charge forward anymore!

“You’ve gone back to your original form?” A cold smile arose on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth as he gazed at the colossus, and then he patted the Herculean Sword and said, “It’s time for you to join the battle!”

Roar!

As soon as he finished speaking, a dragon roar resounded, and then a huge dragon which wasn’t inferior in size to the wolf flashed out from within the Herculean Sword!

A dragon!

It wasn’t just the group of students that were stunned by this scene, even the demon beasts and the huge wolf were the same.

There were no dragons in Pine Prefecture, and they only existed in the Central Divine Prefecture! So, they were truly shocked when a dragon appeared before them!

Roar!

The dragon raised its head up towards the sky and roared, and then a terrifying wave of Dragon Pressure rained down, causing many comparatively weaker demon beasts to immediately start shivering incessantly and lay flat on the ground.

“A dragon.... Human! Who exactly are you!?” The huge wolf stared fixedly at Yang Ye, and besides a solemn expression, there was a trace of fear in his eyes. After all, besides the bloodline of their own race, the bloodline of other races wouldn’t really affect existences at his level, unless that existence of another race was much stronger than him. So, the dragon pressure was utterly useless towards him.

“Kill!” Yang Ye never had the habit to waste his breath on his enemies, so he immediately gave the order.

The dragon roared upon receiving Yang Ye’s orders, and then it smashed towards the wolf!

Yang Ye immediately charged over as well!

Bang!

Numerous huge explosions resounded in succession throughout the sky.

The dragon was only an ordinary Half-Saint, so it was much weaker to the huge wolf. So, it didn’t take long for the dragon to be covered in injuries. However, the wolf was in a worse state. Because every single time Yang Ye’s sword descended upon it would cause its body to split open.

It didn’t take long for the wolf to be completely suppressed by Yang Ye and the dragon’s joint forces. Or it should be said that the wolf could do nothing but receive a beating.

In the beginning, the wolf only targeted the dragon. However, because Yang Ye’s attacks were truly too terrifying and caused even worse injuries to him than the dragon did, the wolf start to target Yang Ye in the end.

Besides that, the wolf had thought even if a human like Yang Ye could survive a single blow from him, it would be sufficient to heavily injure Yang Ye.

But he was wrong!

Not only did Yang Ye refuse to dodge his attacks, Yang Ye even went head-on against his attack, and he wasn’t even able to gain the slightest advantage after numerous collisions with Yang Ye!

So....

“Retreat!” The huge wolf’s voice resounded, and then he immediately turned around and fled!

Meanwhile, the pack of wolves on the ground below didn’t hesitate to flee as well!

“Kill!” Just like that, their group of over a 100 pursued after the pack of wolves while Yang Ye led them forward.

...

Two days later, a huge city appeared within their fields of vision.

“Brothers! We’ve arrived at Ocean of Clouds City! Kill! Let’s annihilate these demon beasts!” Hao Shuaibo ran over to Yang Ye’s side, and then he waved his arms as he shouted loudly. The group behind him was filled with excitement upon hearing this!

However, it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to stop advancing forward.

Because a dense ocean of demon beasts was below the city, and there were at least a few million of them! Moreover, the weakest amongst them was at the Exalt Realm while there were many Half-Saints amongst them. There were at least a few thousand Half-Saints amongst the demon beasts. Besides that, there were even high rank Half-Saints, and there were over a hundred of them too!

However, there were no Saints in the ocean of demon beasts!

Yang Ye was quite bewildered and puzzled by that. But it didn’t take long for him to come to an understanding after he raised his head to glance at the sky which was still pitch black.

“Brother Ye, why have you stopped!? Let’s charge!” Hao Shuaibo patted Yang Ye on the shoulder and spoke with excitement.

Yang Ye pointed at the dense ocean of demon beasts. Hao Shuaibo glanced at them before he withdrew his gaze and said, “Isn’t it just a few demon beasts? We have nothing to fear! Brothers! Let’s kill! Kill them all!” As he spoke, his figure flashed and charged towards the demon beasts, whereas the others behind him charged with excitement as well.

Yang Ye was speechless.

Yu Wushuang stopped when she arrived by Yang Ye’s side and said, “Will they be fine?”

Yang Ye was at a complete loss for words.
