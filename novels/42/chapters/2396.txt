Chapter 2397 – Hell World!

No matter how he fought back, the black robed old man couldn’t move a muscle beneath the pressure!

At this moment, he was beyond shocked!

Just like that, this continued for around four hours before the energy gradually dispersed, and the old man immediately left. Once he fled the mountain range, the old man looked back at the Martial Tomb, and deep fear gradually appeared in his eyes, or it should be described as terror!

Terror!

It was terror he’d only experienced in the Eternal River!

He didn’t dare to stay longer and vanished on the spot.

Once he left the Martial Tomb, Yang Ye immediately headed for the Southern Desolate Lands.

Finally, he had word on An Nanjing’s whereabouts!

Yang Ye shot swiftly through the sky on his sword. Everywhere he passed, the clouds were torn open, and it didn’t take long for him to arrive at his destination.

Desolation!

It was an area of desolation where he could not see the sky through the grayness of the world!

Yang Ye walked forward. He sensed no life in the area, and it was terrifyingly quiet too. There wasn’t even a breeze here!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to see a cottage on a distant cliff.

Yang Ye tapped his foot down and transformed into a ray of light that shot off in that direction. However, a wave of invisible energy immediately slammed down upon him.

Bam!

The ray of light shattered and Yang Ye was slammed to the ground!

Yang Ye looked up at the cottage while his eyes narrowed slightly, and he remained silent for a short while before choosing to walk instead of flying to the cottage!

When Yang Ye arrived below the cliff, something unexpected occurred. The ground cracked open, and a ray of sword energy surged out from below.

It was swift!

So swift that Yang Ye hadn’t been able to sense its speed or presence!

Hiss!

The sword energy pierced through Yang Ye’s stomach, causing him to be pushed back repeatedly until he was far away where he’d been a moment ago!

Once he stopped himself, Yang Ye looked down at his stomach, and there was a very obvious hole there. It pierced straight through until his back!

The sword energy had pierced his entire body!

Yang Ye looked up at the cliff, and then he continued forward.

At the peak of the cliff, an old man in a linen robe sat cross-legged on a circular piece of wood. There was a round wooden table before him, and a GO board was on it. Besides that, there was a white robed old man in front of him.

The white robed old man was the Martial Ancestor from before!

Their appearances were exactly the same!

The Martial Ancestor was using the black pieces, and he put one down before he said, “Do you think he’ll be able to get up here?”

The old man in linen clothes remained indifferent, “So what if he can? So what if he can’t?”

The Martial Ancestor smiled, “He has very good potential!”

The other old man replied indifferently, “That girl is the best!”

Martial Ancestor added, “The Obsessed Sword chose him!”

The other old man frowned slightly, stopped what he was doing, and looked down at Yang Ye. He remained silent for a long time, and then he said, “Let’s see the ability of the person he chose!”

As he spoke, he pushed his left palm down lightly, “Since he chose that fellow, the difficulty has to be doubled at least.”

As soon as his palm descended, another ray of light shot out from the ground!

This time, it was at least two times faster than the last!

Yang Ye wasn’t even able to see it before his body was pierced again, and blood sprayed from his chest. At the same time, he was blasted back again!

On the cliff, the Martial Ancestor chuckled, “That little girl may be his lover. Aren’t you afraid that she’ll be angry?”

The old man in linen clothes replied indifferently, “The weak aren’t worthy of her. I’m not against them being together, but I’m against her choosing a mediocre person. It’s not wrong to be mediocre, but it’s wrong for a mediocre person to be with someone outstanding. I don’t want her to have a burden on her path of the Martial Dao!”

The Martial Ancestor smiled, “What if she becomes his burden instead?”

The old man chuckled with ridicule, “Does anyone even have the right to do that?”

The white robed old man shook his head and smiled without saying another word.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye stopped and didn’t continue. Obviously, someone was stopping him, but that person didn’t try to kill him. It represented that it was very likely to be a test!

A test!

The only way to head up there was to avoid the sword energy or destroy them!

Yang Ye fell silent for a short moment, and then he took a step forward again. But just two steps later, his expression changed drastically, and his sword left its sheath. However, at the exact same instant, a ray of sword energy slammed against him.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted backward again!

This time, he’d been blasted even further away!

Once he stopped himself, Yang Ye glanced at his chest before looking ahead. The sword energy was too fast, and it far surpassed his reaction speed!

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and once his injuries had almost fully healed, he walked forward once more. But he hadn’t even taken two steps forward when the sword energy appeared again. Suddenly, a wave of mysterious energy appeared!

The Sword Domain!

As soon as it appeared, the sword energy slowed down. While it had slowed down, it was still very, very fast to Yang Ye!

However, at this moment, Yang Ye had the ability to fight back now!

His sword left its sheath!

Hiss!

Two rays of sword energy collided and separated in an instant within his Sword Domain.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted around 30m back again while a wisp of blood seeped out slowly from the corner of his mouth!

The sword energy wasn’t just fast, it was very strong too!

The old men on the cliff looked down below.

The Sword Domain!

A long time passed before the old man in linen clothes spoke softly, “There are a myriad of Sword Daos and Sword Domains. I wonder what his Sword Domain will develop into in the future!”

Martial Ancestor nodded slightly, “No matter what, it’s still a rare sight.”

The old man in linen clothes spoke indifferently, “Possessing something doesn’t mean he knows how to use it, and knowing how to use something doesn’t make it powerful. If he can’t get up here, then I’ll sever the karma between him and that little girl with my own hands.”

When he spoke up to this point, he paused for a moment and continued, “The weak aren’t worthy of her!”

Martial Ancestor fell silent.

Yang Ye was about to move forward again when a voice resounded from the cliff, “If you can’t get here in two hours, then leave!”

Two hours!

There was a time limit now!

Yang Ye looked up and asked, “Is she here?”

If An Nanjing wasn’t here, he would turn around and leave. He didn’t care about going up there at all!

A moment of silence ensued, and then the voice replied, “She is!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath. This time, he didn’t hesitate. He stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that shot up the cliff.

The old man in linen clothes laughed with ridicule, “Trying to use force? You’re brave. However, I wonder if your strength is on par with your temper.”

He waved his right hand.

A ray of sword energy shot up at Yang Ye from beneath the ground!

A vicious glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes as he drew his sword!𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Four swings!

In an instant, Yang Ye had swung his sword four times with the Sword Domain!

His ultimate attack!

As soon as the final swing descended, the ray of sword energy shattered, and then Yang Ye appeared on the cliff.

Yang Ye’s countenance was slightly pale, and his right hand had cracked open slightly. Luckily, it wasn’t a big problem. As his strength in all aspects improved, swinging his sword four times with the Sword Domain wouldn’t cripple him like it had in the past. However, it wasn’t very easy as well. Just like this moment. Not to mention four swings, he couldn’t even execute two swings right now!

It was like he’d been completely exhausted!

Yang Ye let out a breath of air and walked to the two old men. His gaze descended onto Martial Ancestor, and the latter grinned at him while he quickly cupped his fist, “Senior, you’re here too!”

Martial Ancestor smiled, “I came to have some fun!”

Yang Ye nodded and gazed at the other old man, “Senior, she’s a friend of mine, and I’m here for her. I’d like to see her!”

Yang Ye was very respectful to the old man because it was very likely that An Nanjing was learning here, and he respected anyone An Nanjing respected!

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Sit!”

Yang Ye didn’t refuse and sat at the side. Meanwhile, the old man in linen clothes said, “She isn’t here right now. But you can wait for her here.”

Yang Ye asked, “Where is she?”

The old man didn’t say, but Martial Ancestor suddenly said, “The Hell World in the outer dimensions!”

“The Hell World?” Yang Ye was puzzled, “What is that place?”

Martial Ancestor smiled, “A special place!”

Yang Ye asked, “How is it special?”

Martial Ancestor smiled, “Geniuses are plentiful like dogs there. Kid, you may be unmatched in your realm of cultivation here, but you may not be able to survive a day over there.”

He gazed at the distant sky and continued, “Geniuses? There are countless universes in the world, and so geniuses are innumerable as well. However, the geniuses of all other worlds dim in comparison to the geniuses in Hell World.”

Yang Ye asked, “Can I go there?”

He shook his head, “No!”

Yang Ye said, “I’m not afraid of death!”

Martial Ancestor smiled, “It’s not about that. We just aren’t able to pay the price to send you to the core area of that place. He practically spent everything he had in order to send that little girl over there!”

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something and withdrew the Myriad World Diagram, and then his gaze fell on a certain spot.

The Hell World!

It actually had the Hell World on it!

“The Myriad World Diagram!” Suddenly, the old man in linen clothes said, “How did you obtain that?”

Yang Ye gazed at the old man, “I obtained it from a senior!”

The old man asked, “That old man with a bamboo chest?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The old men in front of Yang Ye exchanged glances, and they saw shock in each other’s eyes. The old man in linen clothes fell silent for a long time, and then he gazed at Yang Ye. Suddenly, his expression changed because Yang Ye’s hand had descended onto the Hell World on the diagram.

As soon as Yang Ye’s hand touched it, Yang Ye’s face changed drastically while a voice resounded in his mind, “How dare you try to enter Hell World without permission?!”

In an instant, a wave of invisible force pressed down upon Yang Ye, causing his body to crack open.

Blood sprayed toward the surroundings!
