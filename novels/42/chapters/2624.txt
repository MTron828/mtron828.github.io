Chapter 2625

An old man was there!

An old man with a bamboo chest on his back!

It was the old man with the bamboo chest!

Snowy glanced at him, and then her gaze instinctively moved to the bamboo chest on his back.

Meanwhile, the Desolate Emperor gazed at the old man, and the smile on his face had vanished without a trace.

There was a trace of solemness on his face!

“It’s him…” The mysterious existence in space on Qi Bitian’s right spoke abruptly.

Obviously, the mysterious expert recognized the old man.

Just like that, the old man walked over to Snowy, An Nanjing, and Yang Ye.

The old man grinned, “Long time no see, little fellow!”

Snowy glanced at him, and then she pointed at the bamboo chest behind him.

It was obvious what she wanted!

The old man laughed bitterly, “Little fellow, why are you always targeting this box of mine?”

Snowy blinked while frequently glancing at the bamboo chest!

The old man glanced at the surroundings and sighed softly, “I didn’t expect it to come to this.”

He gazed at Snowy, “Little fellow, can you spare this world? I’m sure you’ve noticed that if you absorb all the spirit energy here, then this world will be destroyed. You may be punished for doing that.”

Snowy shook her head. She pointed at Yang Ye and An Nanjing, then she pointed at Yang Ye’s chest. She was pointing at Erya! In the end, she pointed at her own forehead. The injury there had almost fully head, but she would never forget what had happened.

The old man naturally understood her. She was saying that they’d almost been killed!

The people of this world wanted to kill them, and they weren’t the ones who’d started to fight!

Obviously, she was planning to reason with the old man.

She respected the old man quite a bit. Or it should be said that she must be on the reasonable and just side, otherwise, the old man may stop her.

The old man sighed softly. He glanced at the surroundings and raised his right hand slightly. A short while later, a huge screen of light appeared before him, and the scenes from before appeared on the screen… They were the scenes of Snowy being taken to the Origin World!

The old man shook his head and sighed upon seeing Snowy get injured.

Around ten minutes later, he gazed at Gu Jiantian, “The Sprite Progenitor is a being of utmost kindness in the world. If you wanted her to help you repair the damaged core of the Origin World, there is nothing wrong with that, but couldn’t you ask for her help instead? If you were willing to ask or use some other way to make a trade with her, then wouldn’t it be better?”

A trade!

The Desolate Emperor chuckled. The Origin World’s core had been damaged by Qi Bitian, and they needed the Sprite Progenitor to repair it. Actually, if the top experts of the Origin World could be a little flexible and smart, then they would have asked for her help instead or made a trace with her. In that way, they would have had a very good chance at success. After all, Yang Ye’s enmity was with Eternal Kingdom, not the Origin World!

But those peak experts were used to being superior over others!

They were truly too used to it! Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Negotiation? No, it didn’t exist in their world. They would never negotiate with the weak. Coupled with the fact that Yang Ye’s arrival here was the cause of the destruction Qi Bitian had caused, they didn’t have a good impression of Yang Ye at all!

Thus, they took!

The strong were respected!

But they hadn’t expected the situation to develop to this extent. Now, it was impossible to resolve.

The old man shook his head once more, “You could have talked about it, yet you insisted on using force. Now, this world is suffering because of all of you. All of you deserve death!”

Gu Jiantian spoke solemnly, “We deserve death? We’re protecting this world. It’s Yang Ye and the Sprite Progenitor who wish to destroy it. So why is it our fault?”

The old man replied indifferently, “If you didn’t treat the Sprite Progenitor like that, would she and Yang Ye ever treat this world like this?”

Gu Jiantian had a ferocious expression on his lips, “Looks like you’re here to help them!”

He emanated a wave of powerful sword intent as he spoke!

Destiny Realm sword intent!

The sword intent condensed into a sword that was aimed at the old man.

The old man with the bamboo chest sighed softly, “I’m a very fair person. You can attack me. Go on, you attack first, then I will!”

Gu Jiantian smiled fiercely, “Then I won’t hold back!”

His intent sword instantly shot forward like a bolt of lightning toward the old man.

The old man just stood there on the spot!

The intent sword stabbed into him, but it was like it had fallen into an ocean and vanished without a trace!

The old man was completely fine, but the sword was gone.

Gu Jiantian’s pupils constricted, “You… How can that be possible…?”

Gu Jiantian wasn’t the only one, countless others here were shocked.

Gu Jiantian was a Destiny Realm expert, and he was no ordinary Destiny Realm expert either!

But an attack that carried his full strength was gone just like that?

Snowy blinked as she felt the old man was quite strong!

Meanwhile, the old man suddenly said, “It’s my turn.”

A ruler appeared in his grasp.

It was a pure white ruler around 1m long and two fingers wide.

Qi Bitian frowned a little when she saw the ruler, and there was a trace of solemness in her eyes.

Perhaps she was the only one here who recognized the rules, and only she knew what it represented!

Suddenly, the old man put the ruler away!

He raised his right hand slightly and pressed it down at Gu Jiantian.

In an instant, Gu Jiantian felt like his blood had frozen in his body. It wasn’t just his blood, even his body had frozen!

A moment later, the old man waved his right hand, and Gu Jiantian’s figure vanished!

Vanished completely!

He’d been wiped out of existence!

Everyone here was shocked.

The Yin Lord had terror all over his face as he moved aside!

The old man gazed at Snowy while still smiling, “Little fellow, you should have vented enough by now, so can you spare this world?”

Snowy blinked and waved her paws. She was asking if he would attack her if she refused!

The old man grinned, “No, you’ve done nothing wrong.”

Snowy hurriedly waved her paws upon hearing that. She was telling him that she refused!

The old man was stunned speechless.

A short while later, he shook his head and gazed at Yang Ye. He pressed his right hand down slightly, and the slaughter intent around Yang Ye was instantly suppressed back into his body.

At this moment, Yang Ye regained clarity of the mind.

The old man had decided to speak with Yang Ye because it was really difficult to discuss things with Snowy.

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly. A long time passed before the lingering desire to kill within his mind finally faded a little.

Yang Ye opened his eyes and gazed at Snowy, and the latter flew over to his shoulder and rubbed her face against his cheek.

Something worth mentioning was that there were countless sprites behind Snowy. More and more sprites were arriving in the Origin World.

So long as Snowy willed it, she could destroy this world at any moment!

Of course, the precondition was that no one tried to stop her.

Yang Ye rubbed her head and gazed at the old man, “Senior, you wish to stop this battle?”

The old man nodded slightly, “It’s good for you, them, and this world!”

Yang Ye said, “Senior, you require fairness when doing things, right?”

The old man nodded.

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Snowy and the others were immediately captured upon arriving at Eternal Kingdom, and they were even harmed by them. Do you think that’s fair?”

The old man remained silent.

Yang Ye continued, “I, An Nanjing, and Erya almost died here. Do you think it’s fair?”

He shook his head and smiled, “It isn’t far. Of course, fairness doesn’t really exist in this world. It’s strength that decides everything, doesn’t it?”

The old man sighed softly, “Young Brother Yang, there are things you are unaware of, and I can’t tell you about it either. But it’s better for everyone if it ends right now.”

“What about next time?” Yang Ye gazed at the old man, “Senior, I’d like to ask that while you can interfere in this today, can you stop their desires? Even if it ends now, something similar will happen again next time. The conflict in the universe isn’t something a single person can resolve.”

The old man glanced at the surroundings, and what he saw was the heart and nature of man!

Man was greedy.

Just as Yang Ye had said, he could stop them today, but what about the day after tomorrow? Or the day after that?

The conflict already existed.

It wouldn’t end until one side died!

At the very least, that was how Yang Ye’s side felt. But the people of Origin World would absolutely not allow Yang Ye to mature further. They would never let a tiger grow until it could truly threaten them. His talent was too terrifying, and he had the Sprite Progenitor with him. So, who could stop him if he was allowed to grow further?”

Actually, both sides would never let the matter go!

Even if they stopped today, they wouldn’t stop forever!

The old man fell silent for a long time and sighed, “Since that’s the case, all of you can continue.”

He turned around and left.

As if he’d thought of something, the old man suddenly stopped and looked up at Qi Bitian, “Aren’t you going to say anything? You know the consequences.”

She grinned, “It’s fine. I’m not afraid.”

The old man shook his head slightly, and then he looked toward the point of space on Qi Bitian’s right, “What about you? What do you seek?”

A short while passed before the voice replied, “There are some opportunities that are very rarely found. Now that one has appeared, I wish to grab it!”

The old man didn’t say anything else and just vanished at the end of the bridge.

Yang Ye spoke indifferently on the bridge, “Snowy, take it all! Make this world vanish forever!”
