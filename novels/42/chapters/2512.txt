Chapter 2513 – Just Like That?

Something happened in the War Dimension!

Yang Ye asked solemnly, “What happened there?”

She explained, “It isn’t the War Dimension but War City. The city has been breached!”

The city has been breached!

Yang Ye asked, “The demon race?”

Ye Zhibei nodded, “The War Dimension is gathering all the human cultivators, so we must return immediately.”

Yang Ye asked, “What happens when the city is breached?”

She replied indifferently, “Many will die, and many will be enslaved!”

Yang Ye asked, “Don’t the higher-ups do anything about it?”

She replied indifferently, “So long as it’s within the rules, they won’t do anything. For example, if the demons that attacked the city weren’t at the Lord Realm, then it’s our own fault for being weak! All battles within the War Dimension are real, and they are not a game!”

She turned around and left.

Yang Ye glanced off into the distance.

It was brutal!

Needless to say, the way the War Dimension fostered them was quite brutal. But it was normal. If it wasn’t brutal, and if they were allowed to live peaceful lives as they previously had, then how could the Eternal Kingdom fight the desolate race?

The Eternal Kingdom had been lucky to survive because the Sprite Progenitor had interfered.

Yet now, Eternal Kingdom didn’t have the Sprite Progenitor!

Moreover, they didn’t know which side the Sprite Progenitor would help!

In the main hall of the Ye Clan.

There were only two people here, Ye Zhibei and Ye Ruxuan.

Ye Ruxuan asked, “Is he really an illegitimate child of my Ye Clan?”

Ye Zhibei replied, “Is it still important now?”

He shook his head and smiled, “It isn’t indeed. Now, you’re the Ye Clan’s patriarch. Congratulations!”

Ye Zhibei turned around and walked away. She suddenly stopped at the doorway and said, “He was right. The clan only cares about its interests and there are no familial bonds here. If I hadn’t revealed formidable talent all those years ago, you would have never brought me and my mother to the Ye Clan, right?”

Ye Ruxuan lowered his head slightly and fell silent.

A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of Ye Zhibei’s mouth, and then she left the hall.

It didn’t take long for them to leave the Ye Clan.

Now, the entire Eternal Kingdom and its powers knew of a name—Ye Yang!

A Three World Realm expert who’d killed a Five World Realm expert!

It could be said that Yang Ye had allowed the name, Ye Yang, to instantly shock the entire Eternal Kingdom.

Yang Ye and Ye Zhibei returned to the War Dimension, and the city had fallen when they arrived. Demons filled the city, and it was occupied by the demons now! As for the resources owned by the humans, it had been taken by the demon beasts as well!

Yang Ye and Ye Zhibei exchanged glances outside the city. They hadn’t expected that the city would actually fall while they had left for just a few days!

Meanwhile, a woman appeared by their side. It was Xing Biqing.

She glanced at them, “Come with me!”

Xing Biqing led them to a boundless mountain range, and Yang Ye saw over 100 human experts there. Most of them were severely injured!

Xing Biqing led them to a huge rock. Meanwhile, the others gazed at them.

Yang Ye saw two people in the crowd, it was Lu Yunxian and Xue Yiren. They hurried over when they saw Yang Ye!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and asked, “Mo Ya isn’t with you?”

Xue Yiren spoke solemnly, “S-She may still be trapped in the city!”

Trapped in the city?

Yang Ye frowned, “She’s still in the city?”

Xue Yiren nodded, “The demon race suddenly attacked and breached the city, and she wasn’t with us. When we escaped, we weren’t able to find her anywhere, and someone said she’s still in the city!”

Still in the city!

Yang Ye glanced in the direction of War City. He thought for a moment, and then he gazed at Xing Biqing, “I’ll go get her!”

“Don’t be rash!” Xing Biqing said, “Brother Yang, the demon race has occupied the entire city. It’s very dangerous to go there right now.”

Meanwhile, a young man appeared by Xing Biqing’s side. He nodded to Xing Biqing and Ye Zhibei, and then he said, “Miss Biqing is correct. The demon race isn’t weak, especially the one called Yao Ye. He’s so strong that even the joint forces of Miss Biqing and I weren’t able to defeat him.”

Ye Zhibei asked, “What happened?”

The young man laughed bitterly, “The demon race’s attack was the same as always, and they retreated a short while later. However, we didn’t expect them to suddenly return. Moreover, their forces were much, much stronger than before. They caught us off guard! Sigh, it’s our fault. We’ve been at peace for so many years, and it’s to the point that we became careless.”

Xing Biqing nodded, “We were careless. Mo Yun, did you notify Leng Ao and Lu Jue?”

The man, Mo Yun, nodded, “I have. They are on the way back, and they’ll be here in an hour.”

Xing Biqing nodded slightly. She was about to speak when a man suddenly dashed over from afar. It didn’t take long for him to arrive before them.

The man had quite an unsightly expression on his face!

Xing Biqing asked, “What is it?”

The man replied solemnly, “The demon race is clearing out the human experts in the city. They are serious.”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye turned around and walked toward the city.

Ye Zhibei and Xing Biqing hurriedly obstructed his path. They were about to speak when Yang Ye said, “Miss Mo Ya can’t be considered a friend, but we are still from the same sect, and we did get to the War Dimension together. I don’t think I can just stand by idly and watch her die. So, I must go.”

Yang Ye immediately vanished on his sword.

Lu Yunxian and Xue Yiren exchanged glances, and then they vanished into the sky on their swords as well.

They were headed toward War City!

Xing Biqing watched them leave, and no one knew what she was thinking.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive at the city’s entrance. He was about to enter when he suddenly looked behind. A short while later, two rays of light descended before him. It was Lu Yunxian and Xue Yiren.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Cover us when we get out!”

They were about to say something when Yang Ye said, “I can sneak in!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished into thin air. Both of them scanned the area with their divine sense, but they couldn’t find a trace of him!

They exchanged glances and saw shock in each other’s eyes!

…

Yang Ye entered the city without making a sound. There were human corpses all over the city. They were all elites chosen from the outside world, yet now, they were all dead here!

As he gazed at those corpses, Yang Ye started to feel a little worried for the desolate race.

He could imagine how strong the humans and demons who survived the War Dimension would be!

This time, the Eternal Kingdom really planned to fight the desolate race to the death!

He knew the desolate race wasn’t ordinary either! It was a mysterious race! And the Desolate Emperor’s strength was simply unfathomable. They had almost annihilated the Eternal Kingdom all those years ago, so could the Eternal Kingdom stop them now?𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Actually, no matter which side won, the living beings of the entire universe would suffer!

Yang Ye shook his head and vanished into the distance.

With the Sword Domain to conceal him, no demon discovered his presence all along the way, and it didn’t take long for his divine sense to locate Mo Ya.

She was in the ruins of a house!

At this moment, she was all alone in a room, and her right arm was gone. There were also numerous deep injuries on her, so deep her internal organs were visible!

Moreover, her countenance was extremely pale. Obviously, she was severely injured.

As soon as he entered the room, Mo Ya leaped to her feet, but she relaxed slightly upon seeing Yang Ye and said, “W-What are you doing here?”

Yang Ye glanced at her stomach. She’d clearly been clawed there, and there was a very deep claw injury there while blood was ceaselessly seeping out from it.

Yang Ye walked over to her, “Lay down!”

She glanced at him and did as he said.

Yang Ye placed his right hand on her injury, and then countless strands of Primordial Violet Energy surged into her. A short while later, her injury started healing rapidly.

It was so fast that it stunned Mo Ya!

She only recovered from her shock after Yang Ye removed his palm, and then she gazed at him, W-What profound energy was that? It was actually so terrifying!”

Yang Ye didn’t answer her question and said, “Rest for a while, then we’ll leave!”

He flicked a World Crystal to her.

She glanced at it and said, “Did you come here just to rescue me?”

Yang Ye asked, “Did you think I came here to have fun?”

She spoke solemnly, “Why?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Just save it. Hurry up and recuperate, recover your profound energy, and then leave here with me.”

She glanced at him and didn’t say anything. She just started absorbing the energy within the World Crystal. Once she was done, her profound energy had recovered completely.

Yang Ye said, “Let’s go!”

She was astounded, “We’re leaving just like that?”

Yang Ye replied with a question, “Then what did you expect?”

He was naturally able to send her into the Primordial Pagoda, but he only allowed those closest to him to enter it. It wasn’t that he didn’t trust Mo Ya, it was that it was best to be careful when it came to some things.

He couldn’t allow his identity to be exposed!

Otherwise, both the demon race and human race would hunt him down!

Mo Ya thought for a moment and said, “We’re going out just like this?”

Yang Ye nodded, “We’ll charge out together. Make it quick. We have to get out before they can react!”

Mo Ya wanted to say more, but he just grabbed her wrist and transformed into a ray of light that shot up into the air and flashed toward the city walls.

At this moment, all the demon beasts in the city looked in their direction, and then some demons shot up into the air and charged at the ray of sword energy!

Unfortunately, it was too fast, and it only took an instant to leave the city.

However, right at this moment, a huge fist suddenly slammed against it and blasted it back into War City!
