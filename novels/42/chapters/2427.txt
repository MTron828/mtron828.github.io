Chapter 2428 – Hell World!

“Haha!” Xiao Shenwu roared with laughter, and he laughed for a while before he shook his head, “I’ve not been in Eternal Border for many years. I didn’t expect even a junior of Eternal Border to be so arrogant! Looks like I’ll have to speak with my fists.”

Xiao Shenwu vanished on the spot once he finished speaking, and then a fist slammed down at Yang Ye’s head.

The space around him exploded apart while a wave of powerful force seemed on the verge of obliterating Yang Ye.

A peak Four World Realm expert!

Just that punch alone gave Yang Ye a rough estimate of Xiao Shenwu’s strength.

Xiao Shenwu’s strength was on par with that woman from Eternal Kingdom.

Yang Ye raised his sword and swung it.

The Sword Domain!

Four overlapped swings!

Xiao Shenwu was instantly blasted over 1km away.

Presently, swinging his sword four times with the Sword Domain didn’t take too much strength. Of course, the most important reason was because of the Eternal World Crystals.

Now that he had them, he could replenish any consumption of spirit energy.

Xiao Shenwu glanced at his fist, and there was a very deep blood red mark there!

It was a mark from a sword!

Xiao Shenwu glanced at the sword in Yang Ye’s grasp, “What a sword! You…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Xiao Shenwu when he appeared again.

Yang Ye’s sword descended!

Four swings again!

Xiao Shenwu’s eyes narrowed slightly. There was no disdain left in them as well. He clenched his right fist, and his profound energy surged madly before he slammed it forward.

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and Xiao Shenwu was blasted away again.

Suddenly, two flying swords flashed!

Flying swords!

Hiss! Hiss!

They intersected together as they passed!

At this moment, Xiao Shenwu was already 3km away! However, there were two striking blood red marks on both sides of his neck!

It had been left there by those flying swords!

Huang Ying glanced at Yang Ye, and he was quite shocked. Yang Ye kept surprising him. Like the Myriad World Diagram and Executor, and now these two flying swords!

Xiao Shenwu gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “The younger generation really does surpass those who come before them!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Xiao Shenwu suddenly soared up into the air, and then the space around him warped into a strange curve, and then he stretched out his right hand and pressed it down at Yang Ye from afar.

The space where Yang Ye stood was pressed down, and a powerful wave of energy seemed to be on the verge of mincing Yang Ye into bits. It was so strong that even Yang Ye was quite shocked by it. It could be said that the energy wasn’t any inferior to his four swings with the Sword Domain!

It wasn’t ordinary at all!

Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly. He took a step forward and stabbed with his sword.

Hiss!

His sword pierced through space!

Bang!

The space in front of him suddenly collapsed and exploded apart, causing a wave of powerful force to ripple toward the surroundings.

At the same time, Xiao Shenwu was blasted around 300m away, and Yang Ye was pushed 300m back too.

They were equally matched!

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and then a ray of light descended from above Xiao Shenwu.

Five swings with the Sword Domain!

All five swings descended!

Boom!

The space in a huge area exploded apart and was obliterated until only deathly silence remained.

As for Xiao Shenwu, he’d gone over 30km back!

As soon as he stopped there, a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth, and then his entire left arm fell off his shoulder.

Xiao Shenwu shot an icy cold glance at Yang Ye, and then he turned around and vanished into the distance.

Yang Ye didn’t pursue him. At this moment, Yang Ye wasn’t in very good condition himself. After all, five swings exhausted a very, very huge amount of his strength.

He’d had the upper hand in the battle, and he could be said to have won. But winning was one thing, killing Xiao Shenwu was another thing. He could defeat Xiao Shenwu, but he couldn’t kill him.

Huang Ying glanced at Yang Ye, “Brother Yang, are you alright?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m fine.”

Huang Ying nodded, “Then let’s go! We’re heading to Hell World first!”L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Yang Ye gazed at him, “Hell World?”

Huang Ying smiled, “We have to pass through Hell World. That’s the only way to the Desolate World.”

He hesitated for a moment and continued, “Are you really alright?”

Yang Ye replied with a question, “Do you think I’m not?”

Huang Ying grinned, “That’s good to hear. If anything happens next, I’ll deal with it.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course!”

Huang Ying nodded, and then he entered a teleportation formation.

Yang Ye walked in after him.

Not long after they entered the teleportation formation, a group of people arrived here.

It was the group from Eternal Kingdom, and they were led by that woman.

She gazed at the teleportation formation for a long time, and then she said, “Follow them, but don’t attack!”

As soon as she gave the order, three of the armored experts by her side vanished on the spot.

She glanced coldly at the teleportation formation and vanished into the distance.

Once her group left, Huang Ye suddenly appeared on World Mountain. He shot a glance in the direction her group had left toward, “Interesting.”

He gazed at the teleportation formation once he finished speaking, “Ninth Brother! Oh! Ninth Brother! Let me see how you get back home! After all, the Di Clan wants the Sprite Progenitor too! Let me see how you get through all of this!”

Once he finished speaking, he entered the teleportation formation with his group.

After Huang Ye’s group had left, a man in a luxurious robe appeared here. There was a middle aged man behind him and a small pitch black demon beast by his side.

It was Huang Tianxing.

Huang Tianxing glanced at the surroundings, and then some of the auras in the vicinity moved away.

“Eldest Prince!” Ye Gou suddenly said, “If Huang Ying is allowed to return…”

Huang Tianxing shook his head, “He won’t be able to. Anyone who gets close to Yang Ye will die!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he appeared in the teleportation formation.

The demon beast and Ye Gou hurried after him.

…

Hell World.

A long time passed before Yang Ye opened his eyes, and he wasn’t in the teleportation passageway anymore.

At this moment, they were on a boundless mountain range, and a teleportation formation stood behind them.

Suddenly, a middle aged man appeared before them, and he gazed at Yang Ye, “You!”

Yang Ye glanced at the middle aged man, and it didn’t take long for him to recall the man.

When he came to Hell World with Wu Ni that day, this middle aged man had stepped forward to stop them. He was the guardian of the Hell World.

The middle aged man’s gaze moved to Huang Ying, and the latter flicked a black command token over. There was a pitch black ‘荒’ character on it.

The desolate race!

The middle aged man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he flicked it back to Huang Ying.

Huang Ying put it away and gazed at Yang Ye, “Brother Yang, let’s go!”

Yang Ye nodded.

“Wait!” Suddenly, the middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye, “You don’t seem to be from the desolate race.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’m not!”

The middle aged man spoke indifferently, “If you’re not, then please leave the Hell World.”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Huang Ying suddenly said, “He’s a friend of mine, and he’s coming to Desolate World with me.”

The middle aged man glanced at Huang Ying, “The Hell World has its own rules!”

“Rules?” Huang Ying walked over to him, “You’re talking about rules to me?”

The middle aged man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “This is the Hell World not the Desolate World, and you’re not the desolate race’s crown prince.”

Huang Ying smiled, “So you plan to interfere in the fight for the position of crown prince?”

The middle aged man replied indifferently, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

Huang Ying grinned, and then his smile suddenly became cold, “Kill him!”

As soon as he gave the order, the middle aged man’s expression changed drastically. He was about to defend himself when two black shadows flashed out from behind him, and then a terrifying aura and pressure surged out from the middle aged man.

Boom! Boom!

Two muffled explosions resounded, and the middle aged man was blasted away. Meanwhile, another black ray of light shot up and slammed against him.

Bang!

The middle aged man’s body exploded apart, but his soul survived. However, another ray of black light shot up into the air at it.

The middle aged man’s pupils constricted on his soul when he witnessed this.

Suddenly, a speck of cold light slammed against the black light.

Bang!

Both of them exploded apart.

Meanwhile, an old man appeared here. He glanced at Yang Ye and Huang Ying, and then he said, “Ning Prince, forgive me for this disturbance!”

Huang Ying grinned, “Are you apologizing?”

The old man spoke solemnly, “Ninth Prince, can we let bygones be bygones?”

Huang Ying roared with laughter and shook his head.

Hiss!

Numerous rays of black light shot up into the air. The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he was about to do something when a few auras slammed down upon him.

Just this short delay caused the middle aged man’s soul to be blasted into bits by the rays of black light.

He was obliterated!

The old man’s face instantly turned gloomy from the sight of this.

Meanwhile, Huang Ying grinned, “He wanted to take sides. Unfortunately, he took the wrong side.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Brother Yang, let’s go!”

Once he finished speaking, he waved his right hand, and the black shadows in the surroundings left. A short while later, they had soundlessly vanished from everyone’s fields of vision.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and felt quite surprised. He hadn’t sensed them before this!

He hadn’t sensed them at all!

Yang Ye didn’t think too much about it and was about to leave with Huang Ying. However, something unexpected occurred.

The space around him exploded apart, and then four pitch black fists blasted out from within the spatial rifts.

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly, and then he waved his sword in a sweeping motion.

Hiss!

The powerful force contained within the fists instantly blasted Yang Ye away, and as his figure flew through the air, a spear tore through space as it shot at him.

Yang Ye swung his sword again.

Bang!

The spear was instantly slashed into two. However, a ray of cold light soundlessly appeared behind Yang Ye.

Yang Ye turned around abruptly, and his eyes narrowed slightly when he saw the person behind him, “You!”
