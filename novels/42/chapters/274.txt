Chapter 275 – Surprise Attack!

In a deathly silent forest, a shadow that was completely pitch black suddenly walked out from within a large tree. The black figure gradually took two steps forward before it squatted down and stretched out a hand to lightly touch the leaves on the ground. After a short while, the black figure frowned and said, “Why has Yang Ye’s aura vanished here? Could it be that he can travel through the ground?”

The black figure had just finished speaking when his pupils constricted abruptly, and then his figure shook before it vanished mysteriously on the spot and appeared 10m away. However, when he appeared 10m away, a light blood red mark had appeared on his neck!

On a tree that was densely covered in leaves, Yang Ye shook his head with regret when he saw the combination of the Hidden Sword and Sword Control Technique had failed, and then he didn’t stay here for another moment and flashed towards the distance.

At such a close distance, the black figure had still been able to avoid his surprise attack, and this clearly showed how terrifying the strength of that King Realm assassin was! In any case, he wasn’t able to go against such an opponent right now. Moreover, the assassin had two more companions, so he hadn’t hesitated at all to retreat!

He wanted to summon the army of Darkbeasts and surround the assassin. However, when he thought about the strange movement technique the assassin possessed, he’d given up on this thought. The Darkbeast army was utterly useless without the little fellow because if the assassin was determined to flee, then both the Darkbeast army and Yang Ye himself would be unable to do anything but watch helplessly!

As he watched Yang Ye vanish from his field of vision, the black figure didn’t pursue Yang Ye. He just stood silently on the spot. After a short while, he stretched out his hand and rubbed the blood red mark on his neck, and a wisp of a solemn expression flashed in his eyes.

Right at this moment, two black figures that were similarly enveloped beneath black clothed had appeared at both his left and right. When they saw the blood red mark on his neck, the black figure on the right laughed coldly and said, “Leng Yin, I never expected that you would actually be injured by a profounder at the First Heaven Realm. What a shame!”

The other black figure glanced at the black figure on the right who’d ridiculed Leng Yin and said, “Leng Feng, it isn’t the time to fight amongst us. Even though the high-ups sent the three of us to assassinate a First Heaven Realm profounder and we’re all displeased by this decision, you have to understand that everything would be fine if we succeed. However, if we fail, then we’ll probably be unable to hold our heads up high in the league anymore!”

“Fail?” A wisp of disdain appeared on the corners of Leng Feng’s mouth, and he said, “The assassination of a First Heaven Realm profounder would fail? Leng Feng, you think too highly of Yang Ye. So what if he’s the 1st on the Ascension Rankings and possesses both Sword Intent and the Enlightened Sword Heart? It’s all useless before me! There’s no need for both of you to continue pursuing him. I alone am sufficient!” As soon as he finished speaking, his figure flashed and vanished on the spot!

Leng Jun shook his head when he saw Leng Feng leave, and then he gazed at Leng Yin and said, “What exactly happened? How were you injured by him?”

Leng Yin chuckled and said, “Leng Jun, no wonder your rate of success has been the highest amongst the blood assassins for so many years. I didn’t quite understand it in the past because the strengths that you, Leng Feng, and I possess are almost equal. However, you’ve practically never failed a single assignment, whereas, Leng Feng and I were unable to accomplish such a feat. Now, I finally understand a little. It’s because of your attitude! You’re able to be so cautious even when you’re facing a profounder at the First Heaven Realm, and it’s exactly this attitude that both Leng Feng and I are inferior to!”

Leng Jun said indifferently, “He isn’t an ordinary First Heaven Realm profounder. He possesses 4th level Sword Intent, the Enlightened Sword Heart, and a physical body comparable to a King Rank Darkbeast. Moreover, he’s even able to utilize a Dao Artifact. I don’t dare underestimate such strength.”

“He really shouldn’t be underestimated!” Leng Yin nodded slightly, and then he said, “Earlier, I’d almost perished because I underestimated him. As expected of the 1st on the Ascension Rankings! As expected of the future Sword Emperor of the southern territory!”

Leng Jun suddenly asked. “How did he injure you?”

Leng Yin smiled mysteriously yet didn’t speak a single word before his figure flashed and vanished on the spot.

A wisp of a gloomy expression flashed in Leng Jun’s eyes when he saw Leng Yin leave, and then he grunted coldly before he vanished on the spot as well!

Yang Ye’s figure was ceaselessly flickering through the boundless ocean of trees. He was naturally not just fleeing. When facing these assassins, he had to find a suitable opportunity to make a move against them. Otherwise, with the shocking movement technique and various assassination techniques possessed by these assassins, then not to mention killing them, even surviving would be a problem for him!

Suddenly, Yang Ye stopped moving. He glanced at the surroundings before he nodded lightly. The spot he stood just happened to be a spot that could be utilized to launch a surprise attack. Because he was surrounded by dense rank grass, and the rank grass was over 3m tall. So, not to mention a single person, even 10 people would be impossible to notice while they hid amongst the rank grass!

After pondering deeply for a moment on the spot, Yang Ye flipped his palm, and the sword chest appeared on his palm. With a command in his heart, the 36 swords transformed into rays of light that shot out from within the sword chest and entered amidst the rank grass.

After a moment of hesitation, Yang Ye flicked his finger, and then a sword floated in front of him. Moreover, the high-rank Technique Talisman that Bao’er had given him the other day had appeared along with this sword!

With a command in his heart, the sword carried the Technique Talisman along as it flew into the dense leaves above him. After he finished doing all of this, Yang Ye flashed into the rank grass, and then he restrained his aura and fell completely silent!

When facing a King Realm assassin which was one of the elite assassins of the League of Doom, he didn’t dare be careless or underestimate his opponents in the slightest. So, he could be said to have utilized all his trump cards for the sake of killing one of these assassins. Of course, if two or three of them appeared at once, then he would turn around and flee without the slightest hesitation.

With the high-grade Strider Talismans he possessed, no matter how shocking their movements techniques were, it would still be quite difficult for them to catch up to him!

After two hours passed by, no one had made an appearance, so Yang Ye continued maintaining the posture of a statue with his aura completely restrained and his eyes closed slightly. In next to no time, four hours had passed, six hours had passed.... However, not a single person had appeared here....

Just like this, an entire day had gone by. Yang Ye opened his eyes from amidst the rank grass, and he glanced towards the surroundings through the gaps between the grass. He noticed that the surroundings were deathly silent and completely calm. Yang Ye frowned but didn’t move at all because his intuition told him that the quieter it was, the more irregular the situation was!

Time slowly trickled by, and another day had passed. Yang Ye was slightly impatient as he resided amongst the rank grass. However, he still didn’t move. At this moment, he was very puzzled because he hadn’t concealed his aura all along the way. Moreover, not only that, he’d even left some traces behind on purpose. Logically speaking, they should have caught up by now. But why has there been no sign of anyone for two days now?Could it be that those assassins have given up on pursuing me? Or they’re already here, and they’re waiting for me to show myself just like I’m waiting for them to show themselves?When he thought up to here, the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth had curled up slightly to form a strange smile. With a command in his heart, a sword that was hidden before a rock around 15m, away from Yang Ye had suddenly moved lightly and severed a few blades of grass.

Right at this moment, an unexpected event occurred. A black shadow suddenly emerged from within an enormous tree, and the black figure shot towards the location of the sword with extremely swift speed.

In the shadows, Yang Ye was delighted when he witnessed this scene, and then a wisp of a ruthless expression flashed in his eyes. With a command in his heart, the 36 swords shot into the air and instantly surrounded the black figure, and then they transformed into 36rays of light that shot explosively towards the black figure!

Yang Ye hadn’t held back this time, and his 4th level Sword Intent covered the heavens and the earth as it enveloped down towards the black figure. At the same time, he swiftly stomped his right foot on the ground, and he relied on the counterforce to shoot forward explosively like a cannonball!

Leng Feng’s expression changed violently when he witnessed this scene. At this moment, he was naturally aware that he’d fallen into a trap. Of course, this wasn’t the reason that his expression had changed, and it was because of the speed and strength possessed by the 36 swords instead. The speed of the swords was swift to the point he wasn’t able to dodge them at all. Moreover, even he had no choice but to fear the terrifying force contained within the swords that were enhanced by Yang Ye’s 4th level Sword Intent! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

When he’d first arrived here, the experience he’d accumulated through many years of serving as an assassin had told him that there was something wrong with this place. Because it was too quiet. When he recalled the blood red mark on Leng Yin’s neck, he’d decided to be cautious in the end, and he didn’t move around to search for Yang Ye. However, after waiting for so long, even he was slightly impatient, and right when he was about to make a move, he suddenly noticed movement from the grass at the side!

When he witnessed this scene, the first thought in his mind was that Yang Ye was unable to persist! After all, Yang Ye wasn’t an assassin, so how could Yang Ye possess the patience that he possessed? Thus, he hadn’t hesitated to make a move, and then tragedy fell upon him....

He didn’t even have the time to think before he twisted his wrist, and the dagger in his hand emanated a cold glow as it shot towards Yang Ye who was charging towards him. On the other hand, he stomped the ground with both his feet and rose into the air. It wasn’t that he didn’t dare to go head-on with the might contained by those 36 swords, and it was instead because there was no reason. Fleeing immediately upon failure! A smart assassin wouldn’t go head-on with the target!

A wisp of a cold smile suffused the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth when he saw the black figure dodging upwards. With a command in his heart, the sword that was hidden above instantly transformed into a ray of light that shot directly downward. Moreover, the high-rank Technique Talisman was descending along with the sword!

In midair, the Technique Talisman expanded in midair, and then it instantly transformed into a crescent shaped blade of wind!

After the blade of win appeared, the large trees in an area of over 10m in the surroundings had been instantly transformed into innumerable pieces while the blades of rank grass below were immediately transformed into bits.

Leng Feng’s eyes were filled with horror when he saw the blade of wind descend abruptly. Never had he imagined that Yang Ye actually possessed a high-rank Technique Talisman or that Yang Ye would utilize it in such a manner. It had caused him to be unable to evade now even if he wanted to!

The blade of wind resided above him while the sword formation that carried terrifying strength had surrounded him. Leng Feng was terrified. Fortunately, he wasn’t terrified to the point of losing his mind. He took a deep breath while a wisp of a resolute expression flashed in his eyes. The profound energy within his body surged out, and he forcefully stabbed the dagger in his hand at the blade of wind!

Bang!

The blade of wind collided with Leng Feng, and then Leng Feng instantly fell swiftly from midair. Yang Ye was delighted when he witnessed this scene. Right when he was about to strike the final blow, a dagger suddenly appeared at his neck, and then the hairs on Yang Ye’s entire body instantly stood on end!
