Chapter 947 – Then I Won’t Leave!

The 2 figures that led the group were those 2 wolves who guarded the entrance earlier, Elder Mo and Elder Bai.

Both of their faces turned gloomy upon noticing Yang Ye, and their gloomy expressions became savage when they saw the empress who was lying on the ground.

“You....” Elder Mo raised his head to gaze at Yang Ye, and he was about to say something when Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

“Block the exit!” Elder Mo roared furiously.

In an instant, countless experts obstructed the entrance of the palace. At the same time, over 100 consciousnesses instantly swept out like a net that covered every corner of the palace.

All of them had vigilant expressions on their faces, and they seemed like they were facing a formidable enemy!

At this moment, not to mention a person, even the slightest movement in the air would be instantly noticed by them!

However, after over 10 breaths of time passed, there were only demon beasts here and not a single person. It was like Yang Ye had vanished into thin air.

Elder Bai spoke with a gloomy expression on his face, “He’s gone?”

Elder Mo had a savage expression on his face as he scanned the surroundings incessantly, “That’s impossible. He’s definitely still here. I sealed the passageway before coming in here, and I even activated the grand formation that the King placed here. Not to mention him, even a Saint wouldn’t be able to leave without making a single sound!”

Elder Bai asked, “So you’re saying that he’s still underground?”

Elder Mo replied, “If I’m not wrong, then he’s that fellow, Yang Ye, who possesses the energy of 2 types of Laws. The Laws of Darkness and the Laws of Speed. Good! Very good! Looks like I wasn’t mistaken just now. He definitely attached himself to the empress’ shadow and snuck into the treasury.” When he spoke up to this point, Elder Mo suddenly shouted, “Everyone! Immediately attack your shadows!”

As soon as he finished speaking, all of them started attacking their shadows like madmen!

A short while passed, but besides explosions, there wasn’t even a trace of Yang Ye!

Elder Mo frowned a little. Suddenly, Elder Bao’s expression changed, and he said, “Brother Mo, your....”

An unexpected turn of events suddenly occurred at the same time that Elder Bai spoke.

A shadow suddenly flashed out from the shadow behind Elder Mo, and then a dagger swept towards Elder Mo’s nape.

At this moment, everyone was shocked!

Elder Mo was extremely shocked as well. Because he sensed a strong feeling of danger. However, he didn’t choose to flee because it was too late to do that now. Moreover, he didn’t even have the time to counterattack. But it didn’t take him long to calm down and turn around while numerous pitch black scales appeared throughout his body.

Clang!

The scales had only just appeared when Elder Mo felt sharp pain come from his nape. However, a cold smile arose on the corners of his mouth because Yang Ye’s attack hadn’t been able to break through his defenses!

Elder Mo didn’t think too much about it, and he was just about to counterattack. However, a ray of red light suddenly enveloped him, and it caused him to be momentarily dazed while a scarlet red hue appeared in his eyes. Elder Mo was shocked and hurriedly bit the tip of his tongue, and the sharp pain from it cleared his mind. However, another wave of invisible force suddenly pressed down upon him at the exact same time, and then....

Hiss!

A light swish resounded as a tiny bit of pain came from Elder Mo’s nape. After that, an invisible force moved along that point and surged into his body. In an instant, Elder Mo’s eyes opened wide while disbelief and astonishment filled them. But it didn’t take long for the color in his eyes to dim down.

“Brother Mo!” Elder Bai’s eyes almost split apart from the rage and sorrow he felt, and he was just about to attack. However, a shadow suddenly flashed out from his shadow, and a dagger stabbed swiftly towards his nape!

Hiss!

A string of blood sprayed as Elder Bai’s figure stiffened on the spot, and just like Elder Mo, his eyes were filled with disbelief at the moment of his death.

Because there was a person behind him, and there was a person in front of him as well!

There wasn’t a single human here, there were 2!

From the moment Yang Ye attacked, to the death of both Elder Mo and Elder Bai, less than a breath of time had passed. So, the others here hadn’t even recovered from their shock! After all, they were quite stunned when 2 humans had appeared here!

But they were supreme experts in the end, so it didn’t take long for them to recover, and then they charged at Yang Ye and You Wuying. Numerous waves of powerful energy appeared within the palace, causing even the space here to tremble violently. If the palace hadn’t been reinforced by the Welkin Wolf Demon King’s strength which was at the Saint Realm, it would have been blasted into pieces a long time ago!

As the target of their attacks, both Yang Ye and You Wuying were blasted back repeatedly by the aura of these attacks. But it didn’t take long for them to stop moving backwards because Quasi Void Rank sword intent and Quasi Void Rank slaughter intent had surged out from within Yang Ye, and they obstructed the powerful aura which came from the myriad of attacks before Yang Ye and You Wuying!

“Slash!” Meanwhile, Yang Ye roared furiously as he swung his sword, and with 2 types of Quasi Void Rank intents supporting it, the resulting sword energy instantly obliterated all the approaching attacks.

However, they immediately charged forward right after that.

Yang Ye smiled coldly, and then both he and You Wuying vanished on the spot. Their disappearance was very strange, and it simply seemed like they’d evaporated into thin air!

“Be careful of your shadows!” Some of the experts roared furiously.

However, it was still a little too late. A stream of blood instantly sprayed from one of them, and then that expert’s body fell slowly to the ground. Meanwhile, a strand of blood sprayed out from the throat of another middle aged man. In less than half a breath of time, 3 bodies had fallen to the ground, and then they vanished just like Elder Mo and Elder Bai had. Moreover, more and more were still dying!

All the demon beasts here were horrified!

Because there were only 2 people killing them in the beginning, but it didn’t take long for numerous black clothed figures to appear here. In less than 2 breaths of time, there were actually 9 black figures here!

Even though those black figures weren’t as difficult to track as their first 2 opponents, they weren’t much inferior. Moreover, those 9 black figures were actually able to disregard their physical defenses!

It didn’t take long for the wolves which were in human form right now fell run by run, and the group of 100 only had around 70 remaining! Moreover, that number was still decreasing swiftly!

“Retreat! Retreat!” Some of the wolves shouted with rage.

The others didn’t dare stay for a moment longer upon hearing that, and they shot swiftly towards the exit.

Actually, they would have absolutely not been killed with such ease if they were outside, and that included Elder Mo and Elder Bai. Because they weren’t able to return to their original form while they remained within the palace. The palace was too small, and it couldn’t accommodate their original forms at all. If they did return to their original form, then even Yang Ye’s Quasi Void Rank sword intent wouldn’t be able to pierce through their defenses with ease, and it was especially so for Elder Mo and Elder Bai!

After all, demon beasts that took human form actually suffered a decline in strength.

Of course, even if they collided with each other in head-on battle, Yang Ye’s side wouldn’t be weaker to the group of wolves. However, he wouldn’t have been able to slaughter them like he was doing right now. After all, every single one of them was a high rank Half-Saint!

It didn’t take long for all the wolves to charge out of the underground entrance.

Yang Ye collected the corpses on the ground, placed his Sword Servants within the ancient sheath, and then quickly charged out of the underground area. After all, he could absolutely not stay here longer because they would definitely call for backup once they left the place. There weren’t just numerous experts of Welkin Wolf Mountain Range here, the experts of Sky Divine Hall and the black clothed men were here as well. So, he would be in huge trouble if all of them arrived here!

As for continuing the slaughter, his brain was still working fine, so how could he possibly think that he could slaughter all the wolves here on the mountain range by himself? Now, all he wanted to do was flee.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to transform into a ray of light that charged out of the entrance.

As he expected, there were countless wolves all around the exit. All the wolves were actually Half-Saints, and there were tens of thousands of them. Moreover, every single one of them possessed extremely strong auras. Obviously, they were elites that had experienced innumerable battles!

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched upon witnessing such a scene. After all, if such an army of wolves were to attack the city, then he would die no matter how many lives he had!

“Kill!” Someone suddenly roared with fury from amidst the army.

Aowu!

Tens of thousands of wolves at the Half-Saint Realm howled with fury, and their howls instantly transformed into soundwaves that swept towards Yang Ye. The powerful soundwave created by the howls caused the clouds to ripple and surge like an ocean being struck by a gale. It was an absolutely shocking sight to behold!

Yang Ye was immediately pushed almost 3km back from the force of the soundwave! Moreover, that was even under the circumstances that he’d utilized 2 Quasi Void Rank intents to resist the soundwave!

If he hadn’t, then there would be no need to fight the army of wolves anymore. Because just that soundwave would have been sufficient to blast him into bits!

This is Welkin Wolf Mountain Range’s true strength! Yang Ye had a solemn expression on his face as he gazed at the wolf army which was charging at him. If they were to fight him in single combat, then not one of them would be a match for him. However, if they joined forces, then not to mention fighting them, even the imposing aura they emanated was formidable enough to be quite difficult to resist.

Fighting a single Half-Saint wasn’t difficult to Yang Ye at all nor were a hundred. Perhaps a thousand would be slightly difficult, but ten thousand wasn’t a force that he could resist. As for tens of thousands....

Yang Ye was a man! He was no god!

So, Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to turn around and flee!

He didn’t hold back at all and flew on his sword. Moreover, he even utilized the Laws of Speed. So, he transformed into a fine thread of light that vanished into the horizon.

However, it didn’t take long for a large golden net to suddenly appear in the sky, and it bounced Yang Ye back to where he was just a moment ago!

Actually, it should be said to have bounced Yang Ye to the ground!

Bang!

Yang Ye’s figure smashed against the ground, but the ground didn’t crack apart at all, and it merely shook violently.

Yang Ye stood up and he looked up at the enormous net while he sensed the numbness throughout his body. After that, he transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the distance, and it didn’t take long for him to arrive before the city on Welkin Wolf Peak under the effects of his Sword Control Technique and Laws of Speed.

A ray of light flashed and instantly struck the city gates.

Bang!

The city gates exploded into pieces. Yang Ye was just about to charge out when a golden net suddenly appeared at the destroyed city gates, and it wasn’t the only place with such a formation. Golden nets had even appeared atop the city walls around him, and they merged with the golden net in the sky to form a huge golden net prison that enveloped the entirety of Welkin Wolf Peak!

Yang Ye’s face turned slightly gloomy. The profound energy within him surged madly, and he was just about to break through the golden net by force. However, 10 middle aged men who wore white robes and held spears in their hands appeared at the entrance to the city, and they were led by an old man. Yang Ye knew the old man because it was that old man from Sky Divine Hall who’d discussed how to kill him with the Wolf Empress and the black clothed man in Welkin Wolf Hall!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed. His right leg moved slightly, and then he instantly vanished on the spot.

Bang!

Suddenly, a ray of dazzling light suddenly appeared in the sky. The light was like a scorching sun that illuminated every single corner in the surroundings. At this moment, there wasn’t a single shadow here.

As for Yang Ye, his whereabouts were instantly revealed by the illumination!

Meanwhile, tens of thousands of wolves had converged around the city walls. Moreover, it wasn’t just wolves that were here, there were over a thousand human experts with longbows in their hands, and every single one of them were actually high rank Half-Saints!

At the same time, 6 black clothed men suddenly appeared around Yang Ye, and the black clothed man who led the ground laughed coldly, “Yang Ye, where are you going to run now?”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then a slightly savage smile appeared on the corners of his mouth, “You refuse to let me leave, huh? Alright! Then I won’t leave!”
