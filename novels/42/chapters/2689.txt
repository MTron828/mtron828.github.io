Chapter 2690 – What the Heck is Wrong with You?!

In the cultivation room!

Yang Ye stood up slowly and clenched his fists. At this moment, he was full of energy.

It wasn’t physical energy but Past Life Energy!

Yang Ye waved his right hand and Past Life flew into his grasp.

He circulated the energy, and they surged into the sword.

Now that Past Life Energy was supplied to it, the sword shook slightly, and then strands of mysterious energy appeared on it.

Yang Ye gazed at the sword, and he felt that it really was different.

The Past Life Energy seemed to have given it new life!

Meanwhile, Su Qingshi walked in.

Yang Ye put the sword away.

She said softly, “They’ve gone outside!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “I know!”

She grinned, “You won’t object to it, right?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She walked over to him and hugged him lightly.

Yang Ye said, “Ask the Emperor Corpse to watch them, and help them if they are in danger!”

The Emperor Corpse!

He'd rescued it from the woman in black, and he naturally hadn’t forgotten it!

She nodded slightly, “I’ve made the necessary arrangements! You don’t have to worry about their safety!”

Yang Ye wrapped his arm around her waist and kissed her head. He spoke softly, “Thank you!”

She shook her head slightly and didn’t say anything.

They just hugged each other like that.

An hour later, Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda.

Meanwhile, the transmission rock in his possession shook. He withdrew it, and a voice came from it, “Brother Yang, where are you right now?”

Yang Ye glanced at the transmission rock and asked, “Why?”

The voice resounded once more, “I received news that the End World may be planning something big, and it’s very likely to be aimed at you.”

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

The voice replied, “We don’t know for now. However, according to my knowledge, the End World has gathered many experts, and some of them are extraordinary experts from years ago. It’s best if you don’t go head-on against them!”

The End World!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly.

A long time passed before he opened his eyes once more, and then he withdrew the teleportation scroll he received from the old man with the bamboo chest.

He couldn’t delay the improvement of his strength any longer!

Even though his strength couldn’t be compared to his previous strength, his personal strength still wasn’t enough to fight the End World.

Just as the owner of the voice had said, he wasn’t able to fight the End World right now.

Just going over there to kill a few before running away wouldn’t make a huge difference.

Suddenly, the voice resounded once more, “Brother Yang, someone is looking for you.”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “Who?”

“Huang Ying!” The voice explained, “He captured Ye Zhibei and Xing Biqing!”

Yang Ye’s face fell, and then he put the scroll away and vanished on the spot.

Eternal Border.

It was a battlefield for the desolate race and Eternal Kingdom now.

The Eternal River was blood red now, and countless limbs and corpses were floating throughout it.

Yang Ye was quite shocked when he witnessed this scene upon arriving here. Obviously, Huang Ying hadn’t lied to him. The desolate race really intended to fight Eternal Kingdom to the death.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and went over to the barrier before the desolate race’s camp. As soon as he arrived there, a few divine senses descended upon him.

A short while later, Huang Ying appeared before him.

Huang Ying smiled, “Long time no see, Brother Yang!”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Where are they?”

Huang Ying smiled, “How about we speak inside?”

Yang Ye glanced at him and followed Huang Ying into the barrier.

In a hall, Yang Ye saw Ye Zhibei and Xing Biqing. They had quite complicated expressions on their faces when they saw him walk in.

Yang Ye seemed slightly relieved because they were fine.

Yang Ye gazed at Huang Ying, “I want to take them with me!”

He was very direct!

Meanwhile, Huang Xuan, who was standing at the side, laughed coldly, “Do you think this is your home?”

Yang Ye gazed at Huang Xuan, “You have a problem with that?”

Huang Xuan grinned, “I have a huge problem with that!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. Suddenly, Huang Ying appeared before Yang Ye, “Wait a minute, Brother Yang.”

Yang Ye gazed at Huang Ying, and the latter smiled, “We didn’t harm them.”

Yang Ye grinned, “I understand. You caught them and kept them because you have conditions, right?”

Huang Ying gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he shook his head, “Brother Yang, saying that makes it seem like we’re strangers.”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “Just be frank!”

Huang Ying gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and smiled, “I need your help with something. You have the Sprite Progenitor, and the Eternal Kingdom is shielded by 18 different formations. These formations are a huge problem for us. So, if the Sprite Progenitor is willing to help, I’m sure those formations would crumble in an instant. I need you to ask the Sprite Progenitor to help us with that. So long as the formation vanishes, you can take Miss Ye and Miss Xing with you whenever you want.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he asked, “What if I refuse?”

“You refuse?” Huang Xuan laughed coldly, “Let me be frank. You can forget about leaving if you don’t hand over the Sprite Progenitor!”

Huang Ying frowned because this wasn’t in his plan.

Yang Ye shook his head and chuckled, and then he gazed at Ye Zhibei and Xing Biqing, “Come with me.”

They glanced at him and walked over to him.

Yang Ye turned around and walked away.

He ignored the entire desolate race!Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

There had been a relationship between him and the desolate race in the past, and he could be considered to be friends with Huang Ying. However, once Huang Ying became the desolate race’s patriarch, some things had actually started to gradually change.

They had changed!

Suddenly, Huang Xuan vanished on the spot.

He’d attacked!

They naturally couldn’t allow Yang Ye to take the two of them. Otherwise, the desolate race would be completely humiliated!

Suddenly, Yang Ye stopped, turned around, and swung his sword.

AH!

Countless watched with astonishment as an arm flew into the air, and then Huang Xuan returned to where he’d been. His entire right arm was gone!

It wasn’t just that, there were no less than 10 cuts on his chest. They crisscrossed to the point they had practically sliced his body into numerous pieces!

At this moment, everyone here was stunned.

An instant defeat!

An extraordinary expert of the desolate race, Huang Xuan, had been instantly defeated like that!

Huang Ying stared at Yang Ye in silence.

Yang Ye suddenly stopped at the exit, and he said, “Actually, if you didn’t make a request and just released them, I really would have helped you. Because at the very least, that means we’re still friends. Unfortunately, you chose to threaten me with them. If I’m not wrong, you captured them on purpose and used them to make me help you, right?”

Huang Ying fell silent.

Yang Ye chuckled, “I didn’t kill him out of consideration for the Desolate Emperor, and because we were once friends. Desolate race, don’t provoke me again. Allow me to be honest, you can’t afford to do that!”

Yang Ye vanished into the distance with Xing Biqing and Ye Zhibei.

The hall remained deathly silent.

Perhaps Yang Ye wasn’t a match for them if they ganged up on him, but if it was a one-on-one battle, then he really wasn’t inferior to many people. Even those extraordinary experts from eras ago!

Yang Ye brought the two of them to the Eternal River.

They fell silent as they gazed at the countless corpses before them.

Yang Ye gazed at them, “Leave!”

They gazed at him, and he spoke solemnly, “The desolate race wishes to take over the Eternal Kingdom, and Eternal Kingdom wants to crush the desolate race. It’s not something that you should shoulder. Moreover, you don’t have the strength to shoulder such a responsibility. So, leave! It’s your best choice!”

They exchanged glances and fell silent.

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “It’s not something both of you can interfere in. There’s no need to make unnecessary sacrifices, alright? As for your clans, just wake up. Your clans don’t value you that much, including you, Zhibei.”

Ye Zhibei shook her head, “Biqing can leave. The Xing Clan sent her on purpose so that they could use the desolate race to kill her. But I’m different, I’m part of the Ye Clan’s core, and my departure will affect them tremendously.”

Yang Ye glanced at Xing Biqing, and then he gazed at Ye Zhibei, “Take the Ye Clan and leave!”

She gazed at him, and he spoke solemnly, “Zhibei, the world is in absolute chaos, and all kinds of existences are showing themselves. Based on the strength your Ye Clan possesses, if it remains out in the open, then it will definitely be annihilated one day. Leaving is the best choice for you!”

She thought for a long time before she said, “I’ll head back and persuade them!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Alright!”

He knew that it wasn’t realistic to make her give up on that. The Ye Clan was quite good to her, and she clearly had strong feelings for the Ye Clan too.

Ye Zhibei glanced at Xing Biqing, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “Don’t let her head back! The Xing Clan will get her killed!”

Ye Zhibei turned around and vanished into the sky.

Yang Ye gazed at Xing Biqing, and the latter spoke softly, “I’ll leave!”

Yang Ye nodded, “The world is huge! You can travel it!”

Xing Biqing glanced at Yang Ye and smiled, “Thank you.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “That isn’t necessary.”

Suddenly, Xing Biqing looked to the side. A woman in black had suddenly appeared there!

The woman in black!

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched from the sight of her, and he wondered what she was doing here!

She glanced at him and said, “Come with me!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She replied angrily, “Why ask so many questions? Are you coming or not?”

Yang Ye’s face darkened. Dammit! What the heck is wrong with you?!
