Chapter 1552 - Yang Ye? I Think I’ve Heard Of Him!

Translator: InVader

He was surprised, extremely surprised.

Yang Ye hadn’t expected that Yan Lingxue would give him a sword, and it even made him suspect slightly that she might have discovered his identity.

Meanwhile, Yan Lingxue suddenly said, “I’ve seen you fight. You’re skilled at using technique in battle as well. So, come, show me how much you’ve learned from the humans!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he flicked the sword back to her, “I don’t know how to use it!”

He naturally couldn’t use that sword. Once he did, his identity would definitely be exposed. At the very least, his identity as a sword cultivator would be exposed. The experts of the demon race weren’t blind. If he didn’t use the sword, they would definitely be incapable of discerning that he was a sword cultivator; but if he did use the sword, then he would be exposed regardless of how hard he tried to keep it hidden!

He was a sword cultivator. So, once he used a sword, his bearing and aura would change!

Thus, he couldn’t use that sword.

Yan Lingxue pointed her sword towards the ground at an angle, and she looked him in the eyes, “Make your move!”

Yang Ye didn’t refuse. He immediately stomped his right foot against the ground, and he shot forward like a cannonball.

Meanwhile, Yan Lingxue suddenly closed her eyes slowly, and she seemed like she’d entered a meditative state.

When Yang Ye arrived in front of her and slammed his fist towards her, she didn’t try to defend against it, and she just suddenly stabbed her sword towards Yang Ye’s chest. It was extremely swift and cunning. It was like a venomous snake that was attacking with rage.

Even though Yang Ye was confident in his physical defenses, he wasn’t foolish enough to go head-on against this attack. She knew about his physical defenses yet still dared to attack, and that proved that she was confident in her attack.

It was always better to be safe than sorry!

Yang Ye withdrew his punch and slapped it down instead. It struck against Yan Lingxue’s sword, causing the sword to tremble violently and have its trajectory changed. Meanwhile, Yang Ye clenched his fist against and slammed it against Yan Lingxue’s chest.

Yan Lingxue’s reaction wasn’t slow at all. She immediately twisted her wrist, and her sword drew an arc as it swept towards Yang Ye’s hand.

If Yang Ye didn’t withdraw his punch, then it would hit Yan Lingxue’s chest, but her sword may cut his arm into two!

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s right foot moved backwards and only the tip of his right foot was touching the ground. At the same time, his right hand moved backwards slightly, and he clamped Yan Lingxue’s sword between his wrist and arm.

Yan Lingxue was about to twist her sword and cut off Yang Ye’s arm, but Yang Ye suddenly stomped his right foot down and slammed himself against her.

Bang!

A loud sound of collision resounded, and then Yan Lingxue was blasted over 300m away.

Obviously, Yang Ye had gained the upper hand.

Yang Ye didn’t stop attacking. He instantly arrived before Yan Lingxue. Suddenly, Yan Lingxue vanished on the spot, and she was behind him when her figure appeared once more. At the same time, a sword stabbed towards Yang Ye’s back. Yang Ye’s expression didn’t change at all. He just tapped the tip of his foot against the ground and turned on the spot before slamming his fist forward!

This time, he chose to go head-on against her because he wanted to confirm the strength contained within her sword.

As soon as they collided, both Yang Ye and Yan Lingxue moved backwards repeatedly.

It didn’t take long for them to stop.

Yang Ye had moved around 1km back while Yan Lingxue had only been pushed around 500m back!

Yang Ye glanced at his arm. At this moment, he noticed that his arm actually felt quite numb. Yang Ye looked up at Yan Lingxue. He’d always thought that she’d taken a unique route in her cultivation, but he hadn’t expected her to have actually focused on her strength in the end. Moreover, he was even more surprised to find out that her physical strength was that strong!

Yan Lingxue had been constantly dodging when facing Ku Yuan’s powerful physical strength, so it gave others the misconception that her strength was definitely weak. However, this scene allowed all the demon beasts to realize that she wasn’t weak, and she was extremely strong instead!

Yan Lingxue pointed her sword towards the ground at an angle, “I went to the Human Territory in the past, and I met many human experts. We have an innate advantage over humans, and that’s our physical bodies. However, humans have a gained advantage over us, and it's that they know how to learn and create. They created some powerful techniques that even our bodies can’t resist; They created some combat techniques and tactics that allowed them to defeat us even if their physical strength is far inferior to ours!”

She paused for a moment and continued, “Regardless of whether it’s you or Ku Yuan, both of you focus too much on physical strength. It’s your advantage, but it’s also your weakness.”

Yang Ye nodded, “You’re very right. Merely focusing on physical strength isn’t sufficient.”

Yang Ye paused for a moment and continued, “You said that you’ve been to the Human Territory. In other words, you fought geniuses of the human race. Your opponent was a sword cultivator?”

She nodded, “The Sword God’s Pavilion. You’ve heard of it, right?”

The Sword God’s Pavilion!

Yang Ye was stunned. He’d naturally heard of it because it was a power that Jian Wuji had created. Strictly speaking, he was its master. However, whether they acknowledged him as the master was another story.

Actually, he didn’t really care about it.

Those fellows obeyed Jian Wuji, but they would definitely not obey him. It was normal. Regardless of whether it was experience or strength, he wasn’t qualified to make them submit to him. If he really tried to rely on the Sword God’s Seal to make them submit, he would be absolutely naïve. Just like the Yang Clan, he never had any hopes for things which didn’t belong to him!

For example, the Yang Clan was extremely powerful, but it didn’t represent that he was powerful.

He firmly believed in strength. So long as he was sufficiently strong and outstanding, then he wouldn’t be the one who fought to become the next patriarch or the master of the Sword God’s Pavilion, it would be they who begged him to take the position. However, if he didn’t possess sufficient strength, then he would be killed even if he assumed those positions!

It was best to rely on himself!

Yan Lingxue added, “Even though humans aren’t as united as us, they had numerous geniuses. So, once they do become united, it would be an extremely terrifying thing. Right, I heard another genius has appeared in the human race, and he’s called Yang Ye. Have you heard of him?”

Yang Ye!

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he said, “Er… I have heard a little!”

Yan Lingxue nodded slightly, “According to rumor, he killed his way up here from the lower dimensions, and he killed five Rebirth Realm experts in the process. If it’s true, then he’d really be too terrifying.”

Yang Ye was about to speak when a demon beast roared, “Are both of you fighting or not?”

“Hurry up!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Have they fallen for each other?”

Yang Ye gazed at Yan Lingxue and smiled with embarrassment, “Let’s talk about Yang Ye another time. Let’s fight!”

She nodded slightly, and then vanished on the spot. After that, a few dozen cold rays of light intersected to form crosses that shot towards Yang Ye.

Yan Lingxue wasn’t a sword cultivator, and she didn’t possess sword intent, but the strength carried within her sword was extremely powerful. It was much stronger than some sword cultivators who possessed sword intent.

Her sword could be said to be special!

However, she had truly bad luck because she was facing a real sword cultivator. Yan Lingxue was learning how to destroy all techniques with a single swing of her sword, but Yang Ye had the Enlightened Sword Heart. So, it was undoubtedly impossible for her to try and locate his weaknesses to defeat him.

Yang Ye slowly clenched his right fist while his full strength converged to it. A moment later, he turned around and slammed his fist forward!

Everyone was stunned by this scene.

Because Yan Lingxue and those rays of cold light were in front of Yang Ye, but Yang Ye had turned around and punched the air behind him.

Has he gone mad?

All the demon beasts had the exact same thought!

However, what happened next stunned them.

Because Yan Lingxue who was in front of Yang Ye had suddenly appeared behind him, or it should be said that she’d appeared right in front of him because he’d turned around. Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s fist just happened to arrive before her, and it was like she’d intentionally come there to get struck by his fist!

Bang!

A muffled bang resounded, and Yan Lingxue was blasted away.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye stomped his right foot against the ground and shot forward. He instantly arrived in front of her, and then he pressed a finger against her forehead before she could even react. He naturally hadn’t put any strength behind that tap.

The surroundings fell utterly silent!

Because Yan Lingxue had lost!

She’s lost in a very abrupt manner, and it didn’t really make sense!

Yan Lingxue stared at Yang Ye and asked, “How?” She was naturally asking how he knew that she was going to attack from behind him.

Yang Ye withdrew his hand and smiled, “Intuition. Would you believe that?”

She replied, “No!”

Yang Ye said, “All of that isn’t important.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “Your strength isn’t bad, but that technique of yours to locate the weaknesses of your enemies isn’t ready. You need more practice or it’s very easy for others to use it against you.”

She gazed at him for a long time and said, “You saw through my intentions.”

Yang Ye smiled and remained silent. He looked at Gu Mo instead.

Gu Mo nodded slightly and announced, “The Goat Clan’s Xiao Yang is victorious!”

Man Shi and the others immediately howled like madmen. They seemed so happy it looked like they’d won the first position in the competition.

Roar!

Suddenly, a dragon roar resounded in the sky, and then a huge silver dragon emerged from the clouds.

Once it appeared here, a wave of terrifying pressure appeared here. However, it didn’t descend upon the demon beasts on the ground below. Even then, countless demon beasts felt suffocated.

Yan Lingxue spoke in a low voice, “The Heavenly Dragon Clan’s Gu Yinglong!”

Gu Yinglong! Yang Ye nodded slightly.

Yang Ye was about to speak when the silver dragon spoke abruptly, “Who’s the first?”

All the demon beasts gazed at Yang Ye.

The silver dragon gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Let me see what sort of trash got the first this year!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a wave of dragon pressure slammed down towards Yang Ye.

A cold glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes when he saw Gu Yinglong attack.

The thing he hated the most was others trying to show off in front of him!
