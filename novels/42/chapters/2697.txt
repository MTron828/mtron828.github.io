Chapter 2698 – Targeting Destiny!

Yang Ye looked over, but he couldn’t see the ethereal figure’s true appearance.

The ethereal figure continued, “Allow me to be honest, while Destiny is quite overbearing and cruel at many times, they have rendered great contributions to the Three Dimensional Universe.”

Heng Wangu smiled, “You’re not ordinary since you know many things.”

The ethereal figure shook its head, “Heng Wangu, you were a genius then, yet Destiny suppressed you and destroyed your body on many occasions, so it’s understandable that you want revenge. However, you should be aware of their strength. Not to mention you, even the entire joint forces of the End World wouldn’t be enough. Right?”

Heng Wangu glanced up at the boundless reaches of space and said, “I am no match for them, but someone is.”

The ethereal figure fell silent for a short while and said, “So you have a plan. No wonder.”

Heng Wangu smiled, “You’ve been by his side for a long time.”

The ethereal figure replied, “I was asked to take care of them!”

Heng Wangu nodded, “Can you stop now?”

The figure replied, “I’m afraid you’ll have to reveal some trump cards.”

Heng Wangu nodded slightly, “Alright!”

He tapped his folding fan against his left palm.

Along with two light taps, a middle aged man appeared nearby.

First God!

It was actually First God!

First God’s gaze immediately descended upon Yang Ye, and it was full of the desire to kill.

Yang Ye had truly made him suffer. If he’d been just a little slower, he’d probably have died there.

Tu!

The owner of Heaven Executor!

He’d met her again!

He'd really been filled with terror then!

Meanwhile, Heng Wangu asked, “Is this enough?”

The ethereal figure shook its head, “I’m afraid that just First God isn’t enough!”

First God laughed coldly, “Stop putting on an act! Wouldn’t we know once we have a fight?”

Heng Wangu slammed his fist forward.

A huge black vortex enveloped Yang Ye and the ethereal figure.

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly. He was about to draw his sound when he heard the sound of something being torn apart.

Hiss!

The huge black vortex vanished, and the First God was pushed 300m away!

There was an extremely clear fist print on his chest.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He glanced at the ethereal figure.

He’s really strong!

First God had a solemn expression on his face, “Who are you?”

Actually, besides Destiny, Qi Bitian, and Emperor Li, First God felt that not many others in this world were worthy of him taking them seriously. Yet now, this person before him was clearly not Qi Bitian or Emperor Li.

The End World had information on many experts!

The ethereal figure by Yang Ye’s side spoke indifferently, “Do you have other trump cards?”

Heng Wangu grinned, “Why are you protecting him?”

The ethereal figure fell silent for a long time and replied, “How about we do this? One month, I’ll leave in a month from now and stop interfering.”

Heng Wangu fell silent.

The ethereal figure continued, “I’m only by his side because of a promise, and I’ll leave in a month. At that time, you can deal with things on your own, and I won’t interfere.”

Heng Wangu thought for a long time before nodding slightly, “Fine.”

He turned around and left with the others.

However, the First God glanced coldly at Yang Ye with a weird smile on his face.

Once they left, Yang Ye glanced at the ethereal figure, “Thank you!”

The ethereal figure replied indifferently, “That isn’t necessary. I’m only interfering out of consideration for someone.”

Yang Ye asked, “Who?”

The figure replied, “Sky Maiden!”

Yang Ye fell silent.

The figure spoke solemnly, “Kind, it doesn’t matter if you’re chosen or what enmity you have with the End World, I just want to ask you to not drag in your eldest sister and those women from the Nether Pavilion. Can you do that?”

Yang Ye glanced at the figure and remained silent.

The figure shook its head and continued, “Your eldest sister’s physique is special, and she… There are things you don’t need to know. To be honest, they can’t interfere in your business. You’re protected by Destiny, so you can do as you please, but they aren’t. Since Heng Wangu dares to target Destiny, his trump card is definitely not anything you’ve ever seen. So, if you let them get mixed up in this, they will definitely die.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while before he nodded, “I won’t let them get mixed up in this!”Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Actually, even if the ethereal figure didn’t ask, he still wouldn’t let them get mixed up in all of this.

The ethereal figure nodded, “It’s not that I want to interfere in your business, but the game you’re playing is something they really can’t play with you. Even I…”

The figure didn’t continue.

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Who are you, Senior?”

The ethereal figure shook its head, “You don’t have to worry about them. I have no ill intent toward them. It’s I who owe them, and I’m just trying to do something for them.”

Yang Ye nodded and chose to believe the ethereal figure.

Experts like these usually disdained to play tricks and scheme.

The ethereal figure continued, “Kid, based on the current situation, they are planning something big. I suggest that you should go to Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu now, or ask Destiny to protect you. Otherwise, you will be absolutely unable to protect the Good Sprite and Evil Beast you have with you. You’re all alone, and they are an entire group. Besides that, you were being followed by an expert from the Martial Sky Clan, and I’ve asked him to step down for now. If you aren’t fully confident, it’s best if you don’t let him get mixed up in this. Perhaps the Martial Sky Clan of the past could instill fear in the End World, but now…”

Yang Ye fell silent. He was in quite a terrible situation!

Meanwhile, the ethereal figure shook its head slightly, “Go to Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu, and if it’s possible, stay with them or Destiny. Otherwise, those old geezers will play you to death!”

The ethereal figure turned around and left.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Please wait, Senior!”

The ethereal figure stopped.

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “You said they plan to target Destiny?”

The figure nodded.

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “I think something is off. They should know how terrifying Destiny is.”

The ethereal figure replied, “That is the main issue. They aren’t fools. Since they dare to target Destiny, their trump card must be extremely strong to a point beyond your imagination. However, you don’t have to worry because all four of those fellows are extremely terrifying. Instead of worrying about them, you should worry more about yourself. Perhaps the End World is no match for Destiny, but they are definitely a match for you!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

The ethereal figure spoke softly, “Go get some help. Fighting alone is behind the times now.”

The figure vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye laughed bitterly.

Fighting alone!

He was all alone right now. Even though they say he has backing, could he rely on Destiny? They were clearly planning on just leaving him to survive on his own!

Especially the woman in black, she even wanted him to kill the people of the End World!

Yang Ye laughed bitterly without end.

All of this backing was actually not reliable at all.

Yang Ye thought for a long time, and then he decided to go look for Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu.

The people of the End World were targeting Destiny, but they would deal with him first. Now, he had some connections and resources, so he could gather some help.

Find help!

Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye arrived at a cottage on the peak of a mountain.

The furnace outside it was still there.

Yang Ye stood outside the door and glanced at the cottage, “Martial Ancestor, are you interested in doing something big?”

“Do what?!” A furious shout came from within, “Fuck off right now! You’re such a troublemaker! You’re even better at it than him!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Yang Ye naturally didn’t leave. He had terribly thick skin. He walked over to the door and added, “Martial Ancestor, you don’t know how those fellows from the End World have been bullying me. They called on so many experts of the past to bully me, like the First God and Sky Saber, and Heng Wangu and Zuo Mu. There are so many old geezers trying to kill me. I’m no match for them!”

“And I am?” The door was pushed open, and Jian Wudi appeared before Yang Ye. He gazed coldly at Yang Ye, “How many do you think I can fight?”

Yang Ye raised a hand, “At least five!”

The corners of Jian Wudi’s eyes twitched, “Why don’t you say I can annihilate them all?”

Yang Ye smiled embarrassedly and didn’t say anything else.

Jian Wudi gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and shook his head, “You shouldn’t have gotten mixed up with Destiny. Doing that is like becoming the enemy of all the cultivators in the world! If it wasn’t for Xuanan, even I would go after you.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Martial Ancestor, I’m sure you know that even if I didn’t get mixed up with Destiny, they still wouldn’t spare me. They want the Sprite Progenitor and Erya, so I have no choice.”

Jian Wudi hesitated to speak.

Yang Ye smiled, “You want me to give them up? I know you have good intentions, but there are things that cannot be given up, even if death is the only other option. Right?”

Jian Wudi shook his head slightly, “Kid, have you considered that since they dare to target Destiny, they definitely have a formidable trump card. Yet you… Sigh!”

Yang Ye shrugged, “To be honest, I’m no match for them, no match at all. But I have to fight no matter what. Because even if I don’t attack, they will. I would have ran if I could, but the problem is they can always find me, right?”

Jian Wudi just stared at Yang Ye in silence.

Yang Ye felt quite awkward.

A long time passed before Jian Wudi said, “They chose you because they want you to manage this world, right?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Not really. However, it is part of it.”

Jian Wudi fell silent for a long time, “If a day comes where you really take control of this universe, don’t do as they did. Give the cultivators of this world two paths. Even though Xuanan wasn’t killed by them, he died to the rules they left behind…”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Jian Wudi walked over to Yang Ye, sized him up, and nodded, “Go on!”

Yang Ye nodded and left.

Once Yang Ye left, Jian Wudi closed his eyes slowly, “I wonder how many of you old geezers are still alive…”

He vanished on the spot as well.
