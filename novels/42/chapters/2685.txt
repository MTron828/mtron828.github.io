Chapter 2686 – Put Down Your Sword!

The World of Past Life.

Yang Ye arrived at the end of the ruins. Before him was a dilapidated wall, and around it was a lot of weeds. An armored metal figure with a huge axe was standing where the city gates should be.

It was huge, around two to three times Yang Ye’s size!

Obviously, it was there to fight him!

Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly at all!

Because he was very well aware that the tests the woman in white gave him would definitely not be that easy!

Suddenly, the armored figure said, “Put down your sword.”

Put down your sword!

Yang Ye was stunned!

Put down my sword?

I’m not hearing things, right?

The armored figure repeated, “Put down your sword.”

Yang Ye asked solemnly, “She asked you to say that?”

The armored figure nodded.

Yang Ye hadn’t expected this! He really hadn’t!

Even when he faced Zuo Mu, Yang Ye was confident in being able to fight Zuo Mu. Of course, winning was an entirely different issue, but he felt that he was entirely capable of fighting Zuo Mu.

At this moment, he really wasn’t the same as he’d been then!

Even he could sense that!

He had the confidence to leave this place before this, yet now, the armored figure had asked him to put down his sword!

Even though he didn’t have his cultivation before this, he had his sword. But now, he couldn’t even use his sword. If that was so, then he would really have nothing left!

How would he fight without a sword? How would he defeat the armored figure?

Yang Ye fell silent.

The armored figure didn’t attack. Obviously, it was waiting for Yang Ye.

A short while later, the armored figure suddenly said, “You can turn around. Master said that if you do, your cultivation will be immediately restored. You’re already much, much stronger now. So, you won’t lose anything by leaving.”

Leave?

Yang Ye gazed at the armored figure!

Give up?

A long time passed before Yang Ye gazed at Past Life and chuckled.

He stabbed the sword in the ground and walked slowly toward the armored figure.

The armored figure said, “We’ll decide who dies in one clash!”

It pressed its right foot down and slammed itself at Yang Ye like a flashing shadow.

Aura!

At this moment, Yang Ye sensed an imposing aura. The armored figure seemed capable of smashing anything and everything into bits!

He’d seen such an aura on some other people.

Yang Ye was quite stunned as he gazed at the approaching armored figure!

Who dies!

It wasn’t about deciding just the victor!

The loser had to die!

Yang Ye didn’t even have the chance to flee this time.

The armored figure was growing increasingly closer in his eyes, and it didn’t take long for an axe to chop down from above.

It seemed like it could chop the world apart.

Even with his sword, he may not be able to stop this attack!

The armored figure was very fast, but for Yang Ye, it was like he’d experienced an entire lifetime.

Finally, the axe was just a few inches away from his head, and then it suddenly stopped.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was behind the armored figure.

At this moment, it was like the world had frozen!

A few breaths of time later, the armored figure’s armor cracked open and fell to the ground.

Yang Ye walked off into the distance. Past Life shook and transformed into a ray of light that chased after Yang Ye.

The armored figure stood silently on the spot for a long time, and then it gradually turned ethereal.

Yang Ye grinned as he walked off, and it gradually curled into a smile.

Once he walked out the city gates, Yang Ye looked up at the sky and spoke softly, “I understand now. The sword is in the heart, not in the hand. Thank you!”

Yang Ye sped up.

The sword is in the heart, not in the hand!

It was what the woman in white was trying to tell him here. Even when without a sword, a sword cultivator was still a sword cultivator.

Because a true sword cultivator’s sword was in the heart.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Of course, Yang Ye wasn’t that happy. Because the test was still not over, and more tests were waiting ahead!

The 9th layer of space in the Three Dimensional Universe.

A woman arrived here today.

An Nanjing.

At this moment, her white robe was dyed red with blood.

A voice came from the Dagger-Axe by her side, “Congratulations!”

An Nanjing closed her eyes slowly, “I want to continue forward.”

The voice replied, “It’s enough. What lies above is beyond you.”

As soon as it finished speaking, the space before her cracked open.

The voice said, “Let me take you where I once went.”

A moment later, An Nanjing vanished from the 9th layer of space.

…

The World of Past Life.

Once he left the ruins, Yang Ye entered a boundless mountain.

There was practically no spirit energy in the World of Past Life, and even the mountains here were very desolate.

After going through the mountain, Yang Ye arrived by a river and stopped once more.

A woman was seated on a rock by the river.

The woman in white.

Yang Ye walked over, and she smiled, “Congratulations again.”

Yang Ye replied sincerely, “Thank you!”

She had truly helped him tremendously.

She smiled, “It’s the fruit of your own hard work.”

Yang Ye grinned and waited for her to continue.

She gazed at the river and spoke softly, “It’s called the River of Past Life, and it was once a forbidden area of the Past Life Clan. Some remnants of the Past Life Clan are residing at the bottom of the river. I killed some, but I didn’t kill some as well. However, I trapped them here.”

Yang Ye remained silent.

He could sense that she had some feelings for the Past Life Clan.

She fell silent for a long time and said, “This is your final test in the World of Past Life. Go down there, and then come back out alive. I’ll be waiting here. All of their souls contain Past Life Energy, so you’ll attain the peak of the Destiny Realm if you devour their souls. At that time, you’ll be a true peak expert. Besides that, there’s a well down there too, the Past Life Well. The Past Life Clan’s last remaining Past Life Energy. Obtain it, absorb it, and you can comprehend true Past Life Energy from it.”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “I want something! No, it’s a request!”

She gazed at him.

Yang Ye pointed at his stomach and spoke softly, “No matter what happens to me, they will be safe. Alright?”

She gazed at him for a long time and said, “Alright.”

Yang Ye replied, “Thank you!”

Yang Ye leaped into the river.

Meanwhile, she just ran her fingers through the river water while staring blankly at it. No one knew what she was thinking.

Yang Ye went all the way down, and it didn’t take long for him to realize that the area beneath the river was much, much larger than he’d expected. It was like an underground world.

A short while later, Yang Ye noticed the water around him tremble, and then the scene before his eyes changed.
