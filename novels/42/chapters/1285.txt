Chapter 1286 – Are You Really A Sword Cultivator?

An ambush!

Yang Ye and Qian Lankong couldn’t figure out why these fellows were lying in ambush here.

“Are you very surprised?” Senior Yuan spoke coldly, “My Yuan Clan is watching the area all around the barrier, and my Yuan Clan knows every detail about every single person that left or entered. Master of the Slayer Pavilion, I truly don’t understand what Yang Ye promised you to actually make you not hesitate to go against us in order to help him!”

Yang Ye calmed down when he heard Senior Yuan. Because they hadn’t seen through his identity and still treated him as the master of Slayer Pavilion. Yang Ye didn’t conceal himself and walked out of space with Qian Lankong.

All of them became vigilant when they saw Yang Ye and Qian Lankong. They simply seemed like they were facing a formidable enemy. Even Senior Yuan had vigilance in his eyes. After all, there weren’t many in the Veiled Region who dared to look down on the master of Slayer Pavilion. No, it should be said that there weren’t many throughout the continent who dared to look down on him.

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “It’s naturally something that I can’t resist!” His voice was hoarse as if he had something in his throat. Yang Ye had naturally done that on purpose.

Senior Yuan said, “I’m a little curious.”

Yang Ye replied, “You really want to know?”

Senior Yuan said, “If you don’t mind!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Actually, it’s nothing shocking. He just promised to help me advance from the Voider Realm!”

Advance from the Voider Realm? Senior Yuan and the others’ pupils constricted. All of them were Voiders, and what was their lifelong goal? It was to advance! Because only then could they increase their lifespan and continue living. If they stopped at the Voider Realm, then they would transform into a pile of dirt in the end.

If Yang Ye really had the ability to help others advance from the Voider Realm and attain a higher realm of cultivation, then not to mention the master of Slayer Pavilion, even many of the others here would be tempted. Actually, it wouldn’t just be many but all of them!

But was it possible? Did Yang Ye have the ability to accomplish that? Obviously, they felt that it was impossible. Because they were very well aware that breaking through from the Voider Realm had to be done in a large world, and it had to be done by obtaining energy that was purer than Quintessence Violet Energy. Did Yang Ye possess energy that was purer than Quintessence Violet Energy?

They naturally didn’t believe that, but the master of Slayer Pavilion did. Was he a fool? Of course he wasn’t! In other words, Yang Ye might really possess such energy.

Many of them weren’t able to maintain their composure when they thought up to this point.

“What a joke!” Meanwhile, Senior Yuan suddenly laughed coldly, “Advance from the Voider Realm? Do you think we are fools? Since the continent suffered that calamity, have you ever seen anyone breaking through from the Voider Realm? Yang Ye has the ability to help you advance? How laughable! He’s just a Quasi Emperor, yet he actually talks nonsense about helping others advance to a higher realm of cultivation than the Voider Realm? The even more laughable part is that the dignified master of the Slayer Pavilion actually believed such nonsense!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand and said, “Attack!”

He’d realized that the situation was turning bad for him when he noticed that the others were tempted. They were from different clans and sects, and they weren’t his Yuan Clan’s subordinates. The reason he could order them was because they had a common enemy. If they were allowed to have other thoughts, then it would be extremely bad for him and the Yuan Clan.

Of course, the main reason was that he didn’t believe Yang Ye could really help someone advance from the Voider Realm!

Ye Ming and the others hesitated for a moment and were about to attack. Even though they were curious about how Yang Ye would help him advance, they were still quite doubtful in the depths of their hearts.

“I’ll prove it to all of you!” Suddenly, Yang Ye took a step forward, “I’ll prove that he really can do it.”

Ye Ming and the others stopped simultaneously when they heard Yang Ye. This time, they paid no further attention to Senior Yuan. Obviously, they weren’t able to refuse the temptation of advancing from the Voider Realm.

Senior Yuan’s eyes narrowed slightly while he clenched his fists. However, he didn’t attack because even he wanted to see how the ‘master of the Slayer Pavilion’ would prove it.

Yang Ye said, “Look at my profound energy! He can change my profound energy!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

As he spoke, the profound energy within Yang Ye surged before he said, “Look carefully at my profound energy. All of you should have the ability to discern how different my profound energy is.” As soon as he finished speaking, he flicked a strand of violet energy over towards the area above them.

Once it arrived in the air above them, their gazes immediately looked up, and their expressions changed as soon as they laid eyes on that strand of violet energy. Because it was clearly not ordinary profound energy. It wasn’t profound energy of the 5 elements, nor was it Quintessence Violet Energy. No, it was much purer than all those types of profound energy, even Quintessence Violet Energy!

As they gazed at it, the hands of many had started to tremble.

Even Senior Yuan’s eyes were filled with shock and a trace of disbelief.

Does Yang Ye really possess the ability to help others advance from the Voider Realm?

Such a thought had arisen in all their minds.

Suddenly, one of the old men said, “Where are they?”

The others recovered from their shock, and their faces became extremely unsightly when they looked towards the position where Yang Ye and Qian Lankong had been standing at. Because they were gone now.

Senior Yuan spoke with a gloomy expression on his face, “Pursue them!”

However, none of them moved, and the gazes of everyone was locked onto that strand of violet energy.

Senior Yuan’s face grew even more gloomy. He waved his right hand and took the violet energy before he said, “I’ll keep it safe for now, and we can study it later. Now, let’s pursue them first.”

The others exchanged glances, and then they shot off towards the distance.

Senior Yuan glanced at the violet energy in his grasp, and there was a trace of a strange expression in his eyes. The strand of violet energy wasn’t Quintessence Violet Energy, yet it was even purer. This world didn’t have any energy that was purer than Quintessence Violet Energy, but it did now, and it was in his possession!

“Yang Ye!” Senior Yuan took a deep breath, and he put the violet energy away before vanishing on the spot.

Over 100,000km away, Yang Ye and Qian Lankong dashed forward madly, and their speeds were at their respective limits.

Qian Lankong suddenly asked, “Are you really a sword cultivator?”

Yang Ye replied, “Of course. Why do you ask that?”

She answered, “it’s nothing. I just feel that it’s quite inconceivable for a sword cultivator to be shameless to such an extent.”

Yang Ye’s face darkened, “What do you mean? That’s called being quick-witted!”

She said, “If you aren’t shameless, then why did you take off my clothes?”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched slightly, “That has nothing to do with this, alright? Besides that, I took off your clothes to heal your injuries. In the end, you lived through it, right?”

She said, “You’re shameless.”

Yang Ye was speechless.

Qian Lankong suddenly asked, “Were you telling the truth earlier/”

Yang Ye naturally understood what she meant, and he immediately replied, “What do you think?”

Qian Lankong said, “To be honest, I don’t believe that you can help someone advance from the Voider Realm. But your profound energy.... It’s much purer than Quintessence Violet Energy, and the healing effects of Quintessence Violet Energy is absolutely inferior when compared to your profound energy. Your profound energy is definitely superior to Quintessence Violet Energy. Exactly what type of profound energy is it? Can it really help others advance from the Voider Realm?”

Actually, she’d wanted to ask this question when Yang Ye helped heal her earlier. Because his profound energy was too terrifying.

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “Do you really want to know?”

She nodded, “Yes!”

Yang Ye replied, “I’m sorry, but I can’t tell you. It’s a secret of mine.”

Besides the people closest to him, he refused to tell anyone else about the Primordial Pagoda. After all, a man’s wealth is his own ruin by arousing greed in others. If others were to find out that he possessed such a precious treasure, the whole world would be his enemy.

Qian Lankong asked, “Have you not told anyone?”

“I have!” Yang Ye said, “But they are the people closest to me.”

She glanced at him and fell silent.

Both of them were extremely swift. Coupled with the fact that Yang Ye was using the Sword Domain to conceal them, it only took them an hour to shake off Senior Yuan’s group.

Yang Ye asked, “How many powers are there in the Veiled Region?”

Qian Lankong explained, “The human race in the Veiled Region is comprised of 6 cities, 3 sects, and 1 pavilion. The 6 cities represent 6 clans, the Yuan Clan, the Yun Clan, the Ye Clan, the Li Clan, the Lin Clan, and the Qin Clan. The 3 sects are the High Abyss Sect, the Sky Wave Sect, and the Limitless Sect. As for the pavilion, it’s our Slayer Pavilion. These are the strongest powers amongst the human race here. Yet now, besides the Lin Clan, Sky Wave, and the Slayer Pavilion, all the other clans and sects have joined forces to deal with you and the Slayer Pavilion.”

Yang Ye said, “Why hasn’t the Lin Clan and Sky Wave Sect joined forces with the Yuan Clan?”

“I don’t know!” She continued, “I’ll send someone to investigate later!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Right, what about the demon race?”

She fell silent for a short while before she said, “The demon race is on the other side of Heaven Pillar Mountain Range. Heaven Pillar Mountain Range is a powerful barrier that the human race and demon race built together. The demon race can’t come over here, and the human race can’t go over there. The reason for that was so that the human race and demon race don’t fight each other. Because at that time, the continent had just suffered a calamity. So both the human race and demon race had very few members left. Yet now, our human race is multiplied incessantly, and it should be the same for the demon race. Fortunately, Heaven Pillar Mountain Range is there, so we’re all living together peacefully.”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Do you think the demon race would attack if we destroyed that barrier?”

Qian Lankong’s eyelids twitched, “Don’t do something insane like that.”

Yang Ye said, “I think it’s a pretty good plan. If the demon race really does attack, then they wouldn’t have time to care about me.”

Yang Ye suddenly became excited when he spoke up to this point, “I think it’s completely viable. Let’s go destroy that barrier!”

Qian Lankong was at a loss for words.
