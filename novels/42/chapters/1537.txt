Chapter 1538 - Coward!

Translator: InVader

Arrogant!

Absolutely arrogant!

All the demon beasts here were stunned. Obviously, they hadn’t expected Yang Ye to be so arrogant and haughty!

Hu Meng was stunned as well. Didn’t he say that he wants to keep a low profile?

Yang Ye naturally wanted to keep a low profile. However, he couldn’t right now. He would definitely be in trouble if he did that right now. Because all the demon beasts here doubted him.

Actually, not to mention the other demon beasts, even he felt that he was really unusual. Because practically all the demon beasts here had returned to their true form. He was the only one in human form, and he was so tiny, so who wouldn’t doubt him? DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

For the sake of eliminating the doubt they had, he had no choice but to act arrogantly!

He wanted to tell them that it wasn’t that he refused to take his true form, it was that they weren’t worthy of him taking his true form!

Even though doing this would temporarily dispel their doubt towards him, it was very offensive. So, as soon as they heard Yang Ye, besides Hu Meng, all the other demon beasts looked at Yang Ye with extremely hostile gazes.

“I know you! You’re from the Goat Clan!” Meanwhile, a completely pitch black wolf walked over to Yang Ye. He looked down at Yang Ye and said, “I don’t understand… When has the Goat Clan become so arrogant?”

Many of the other demon beasts had spurious smiles on their faces when they saw the black wolf.

The Wolf Clan could be considered to be the natural enemy of the Goat Clan. Actually, many clans were natural enemies of the Goat Clan. Because of their physique, the Goat Clan had always been very weak, and it was the weakest amongst the clans. If it wasn’t for the rules of the demon race that prohibited the slaughter of other clans, the Goat Clan would have vanished a long time ago.

Yang Ye was about to speak when a voice resounded, “If anyone attacks before it begins, you’ll lose your right to participate!”

A wisp of disappointment flashed through the eyes of many demon beasts.

Meanwhile, the black wolf added, “Remember that I’ll eat you alive later!” As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and walked to the side. However, his aura had locked onto Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Hu Meng suddenly asked, “Didn’t you want to keep a low profile?”

Yang Ye smiled and remained silent. He naturally wanted to keep a low profile. However, he couldn’t do that right now. Just like this very moment, those demon beasts in the surroundings weren’t looking doubtfully at him anymore. Of course, they weren’t friendly either. After all, what he’d said had undoubtedly offended many demon beasts here.

Even though he could utilize Draconification, if he said that he was from the Heavenly Dragon Clan, then he would immediately become the center of attention. Moreover, the Heavenly Dragon Clan would definitely come looking for him. At that time, he would be in trouble.

Hu Meng hesitated for a moment and said, “I don’t know why you did that, but it was truly quite unwise. Because it’ll make the others target you. If you’re targeted at a place like this, then the consequences…”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s fine!”

Hu Meng glanced at Yang Ye, nodded, and didn’t speak further.

Even though he didn’t know Yang Ye for very long, he understood Yang Ye a little. Yang Ye was confident, extremely confident. Moreover, Yang Ye was no fool. So, there was definitely a reason why Yang Ye had acted like that. However, he was still quite worried. After all, it would be horrible to be besieged from all sides!

Yang Ye gazed at Hu Meng and said, “Are there any especially formidable geniuses in our demon race?”

“Of course!” Hu Meng nodded, “The most famous is naturally the princess of the Divine Phoenix Clan. However, she isn’t the strongest. There are three others.”

Yang Ye asked, “Who?”

Hu Meng explained, “The Heavenly Dragon Clan’s Crown Prince, Gu Yinglong, the Devil Ape Clan’s Yuan Nie, and the Phantom Fox Clan’s Huan Mingxuan. They are the strongest amongst the younger generation of our demon race. Of course, the princess of the Divine Phoenix Clan, Mo Xiaoleng, is one of the strongest too. However, besides the four of them, there are definitely many other extraordinary geniuses. After all, many geniuses keep a comparatively low profile!”

Yang Ye nodded. Indeed, many geniuses kept low profiles, and those who kept their ability secret were sometimes the most terrifying.

Meanwhile, Hu Meng added, “But this time, Gu Yinglong and the others won’t be participating!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Hu Meng laughed bitterly, “Because they’d automatically advanced. In other words, the top three in the competition will represent our demon race with them. Actually, the top three are just going to gain experience and witness the strength of the monstrous geniuses from the other races. The four of them are the ones who’ll truly be competing.”

Yang Ye was stunned, “Isn’t that a little unfair?”

“It was done to maintain fairness.” Hu Meng continued, “If they participated in this competition, then it’ll be unfair to us. Because they aren’t on the same level as us.”

“I see!” Yang Ye nodded. Indeed, those fellows Hu Meng had spoken about were probably extraordinarily monstrous geniuses like him. If he could use his sword, then it would be extremely unfair to Hu Meng and the other demon beasts. But he couldn’t use his sword now, so it wasn’t unfair to Hu Meng and the others now, it was unfair to him!

Suddenly, a point in space around 300m away from Yang Ye trembled, and then numerous huge pillars emerged from the ground. It didn’t take long for a hundred pillars to stand towering here.

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What’s this?”

Hu Meng explained, “One hundred stone pillars. Only one person can remain on each pillar. Once the first round comes to an end, those who still remain on the pillars will enter the next round. So, a fierce battle is waiting for us!”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. There were tens of thousands of demon beasts here. Moreover, there were many more entering this place in succession.

Tens of thousands fighting for 100 stone pillars! How intense would it be?

However, those who were able to remain on the stone pillars in the end would definitely be the strongest. This method of elimination was really capable of eliminating the weak!

Two hours later, no more demon beasts entered the Spatial Battlefield, and the atmosphere was tense.

Around 15 minutes later, a voice resounded, “Begin!”

As soon as the voice finished resounding, countless demon beasts howled in unison. It was truly magnificent to witness tens of thousands of demon beasts howling in unison. However, no demon beast charged over to those stone pillars.

At this moment, the first to charge over would be targeted by countless demon beasts.

The leading bird is always the first to be shot!

However, it didn’t continue for long. It didn’t take long for a demon beast to appear on one of the stone pillars. However, it just took a moment for countless demon beasts to slam their bodies against it!

In an instant, that demon beast was on the verge of death.

Meanwhile, the other demon beasts here couldn’t stand by idly anymore. All of them charged towards the stone pillars. The following scene caused Yang Ye to be quite flabbergasted.

Countless demon beasts were charging at those stone pillars, but none could stay on them for more than two breaths of time. Practically anyone who went up a pillar would be blasted down by the other demon beasts behind them! If one couldn’t slam the demon beast on the pillar down, then two would join forces; if two failed, then a group would join forces!

It was chaotic and intense!

The situation here was extremely chaotic and intense!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye gazed at Hu Meng, “Should we make a move?”

Hu Meng shook his head, “This is just the beginning. Let’s wait for now. In any case, it’ll only end after two hours. So, there’s no rush.”

Yang Ye nodded.

A short while passed.

Boom!

Suddenly, a terrifying aura swept over from afar, and then numerous demon beasts were pushed backwards repeatedly.

Hu Meng spoke solemnly, “The truly formidable geniuses are making their moves!”

Yang Ye looked up and saw a demon beast which was shaped like a lion and completely golden had leaped up and descended onto the highest stone pillar.

At this moment, Yang Ye noticed something. He noticed there were three especially high stone pillars in the middle of the area. Amongst those three stone pillars, the stone pillar right at the center was the highest, the second highest was the stone pillar on the left, and the shortest amongst the three was on the right!

“The top three!” Hu Meng explained, “If you persist until the end on one of those three pillars, then your name will immediately spread throughout Heaven’s Vault City! However, it’s really difficult to stay up there. Because those with true strength will choose those three pillars.” He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Do you want to give it a try?”

Yang Ye hurriedly shook his head, “I just want a normal stone pillar.” As far as he was concerned, advancing to the next round was all that mattered.

Hu Meng said, “Actually, you have a chance!”

Yang Ye smiled and didn’t say anything in response. He turned to look towards the distance. The battles there were extremely fierce. Based on his estimations, such a situation would continue until the first round came to an end.

A short while passed before Hu Meng said, “I’m going to join the battle!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he shot towards the distance.

Yang Ye smiled. He couldn’t restrain himself in the end.

Yang Ye watched for a while, and then he decided to join in as well. Because there wasn’t much time left, and that black wolf from before had suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, “What are you doing here?”

The black wolf licked his own lips while a ferocious glow flickered within his eyes, “Why don’t you try and guess?”

“I guess you’re here to seek death!” As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, he slammed his fist forward. The black wolf wasn’t even able to react before he was blasted away, and he flew for over 3km.

Once he punched the black wolf away, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. Suddenly, his eyes lit up because the demon beast on one of the stone pillars had just been struck down, so it was empty.

Yang Ye was swift and instantly appeared on that stone pillar.

Some of the demon beasts on the ground below were stunned by this. Obviously, they hadn’t expected Yang Ye’s speed to be so swift.

It didn’t take long for them to recover from their shock, and then they charged at Yang Ye. Moreover, the other demon beasts who were fighting for the other stone pillars in the vicinity had started to charge at Yang Ye as well.

Why?

Because they felt that it would be easier. Yang Ye’s figure was too small, so it was obvious that he was very easy to bully!

Yang Ye had been mentally prepared, but he hadn’t expected the demon beasts in the surroundings to charge at him too. There were at least a few thousand of them if all of them were included!

As he watched them charge towards him, Yang Ye hesitated for a moment before he leaped off the stone pillar, “I don’t want it. All of you can have it.”

“Coward!” Suddenly, a huge ink black bull on a pillar not too far away gazed at Yang Ye, and his eyes were filled with ridicule and disdain.

Yang Ye was about to move aside, but he suddenly stopped when he heard this, and then he gazed at that black bull.
