Chapter 890 – You Should Feel Honored!

Translator: InVader

Editor: Conspiracing

This scene had exceeded everyone’s expectations!

Including Tang Xiaorou!

A muffled bang resounded when the dagger was about to strike Tang Xiaorou’s throat, and then Bai Feng’s figure was blasted flying.

Bai Feng crawled up from the ground and gazed with shock at Leng Yuran who’d attacked him, “Brother Leng, you....”

Leng Yuran glanced indifferently at him and said, “Actually, I was lying. The Tang Clan hasn’t betrothed Tang Xiaorou to me. Just use that pig brain of yours. The Tang Clan is only a Silver Rank clan, how could it possibly become united in marriage with my Leng Clan?”

Bai Feng roared furiously, “How dare you trick me!?”

Leng Yuran replied, “So what? Bite me!”

“You....” Bai Feng’s face flushed red with rage, but he didn’t dare flare up. After that, he seemed to have thought of something and gazed at Tang Xiaorou who had despair covering her face, “Xiaorou, I....”

Tang Xiaorou glanced at him with a wisp of ridicule on the corners of her mouth, “Men....”

Meanwhile, Leng Yuran said, “Now, I presume you’ve realized that all he had towards you was desires of the flesh. You’re someone who he can abandon at will under certain circumstances or situations of life and death. You gave up on the one who truly loved you and chose someone who didn’t even have you in his heart. You... are pitiable and sad!”

“Xiaorou, give me a chance!” Bai Feng suddenly walked over to Tang Xiaorou and wrapped his arms over her shoulders as he said, “I realize my mistakes. Please do it out of consideration for our child and allow me to....”

Hiss!

Bai Feng’s voice stopped abruptly. He held his throat with both hands while he moved backwards repeatedly, and his eyes were filled with terror and disbelief.

“Don’t worry! I’ll coming right now to keep you company!” As soon as she finished speaking, she suddenly swiped the dagger at her own throat. It was so quick and unexpected that Man Li and Leng Yuran’s expressions changed because they weren’t able to stop her in time.

However, the dagger in her grasp was transformed into powder when it was just about to strike her throat.

Leng Yuran, and the others gazed at Yang Ye while a slightly solemn expression filled their eyes.

“Is it even worth it?” Yang Ye continued, “It isn’t. Not even in the slightest. Once you die, it’s your family that’ll be hurt. It’s very stupid to harm your family for the sake of someone who doesn’t even love you. Now, if you still think you have to accompany him in death, then you can slit your own throat. Don’t worry, I absolutely won’t stop you. Moreover, I’ll even beat up anyone who tries to stop you!”

Yang Ye hadn’t intended to interfere in their business, but he felt that he had to interfere now. Because they might be his students. While they couldn’t be considered to be his students right now, they still might be.

He was serious in assuming the position of instructor in the academy. After all, it was related to the enmity between him and the academy, and it was related to the Ancient Sword School’s honor as well!

Tang Xiaorou slumped down to the ground while despair covered her face.

Man Li seemed slightly unable to bear the sight of it, and he was about to step forward when Chu Yue pulled him back. Man Li grinned to her, and then he walked over to Tang Xiaorou, “Xiaorou, you should be aware that you’re the hope of your Tang Clan. Both your parents hope that you’ll be able to join the academy. If you take your own life now, then what would they do? What would your younger brother do?”

Tang Xiaorou raised her hand and glanced at him, and then she glanced at Chu Yue in the end. She didn’t speak a single word, but the intent to die was gone from her eyes.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Right, no one is a saint, so can anyone avoid making mistakes? If you realize you’ve made a mistake, then just rectify it.” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye couldn’t help but feel stunned. Have I gotten a little too into the role I’m playing? I’m still not an instructor!

Yang Ye shook his head and gazed at the black robed man, “Didn’t you want to take their inner cores? You can do it now. Right, you can beat them up. It’s fine as long as you don’t kill them!”

The others here were stunned when they heard this, and they shot strange gazes at Yang Ye.

Man Li and Chu Yue instantly became vigilant because they were the weakest amongst the people here!

The black robed man glanced at Man Li’s group, and then he shook his head and said, “I’m not in the mood anymore!”

“There’s a wolf den not too far away from here, and there are over 20 Exalt Realm wolves there!” Meanwhile, Leng Yuran spoke abruptly, “I wonder if the 3 of you are interested?”

The 3 Leng Yuran spoke of was naturally Yang Ye, the black robed man, and the man in an embroidered robe.

“Over 20?” The eyes of the man in the embroidered robe lit up, “Tsk, tsk. Over 20 inner cores! If I kill a few groups like that, then it would be almost sufficient for me to enter the A Class!”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Is it very difficult to enter the A Class?”

The face of the man in embroidered robes froze when he heard Yang Ye, and then he glanced at Yang Ye yet didn’t say a word. Meanwhile, the others glanced at Yang Ye with strange gazes again.

Leng Yuran gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Brother, are you not here to take part in the recruitment test?”

“I am. Of course I am!” Yang Ye hurriedly guaranteed, “I’m an absolutely legit participant!”

Leng Yuran replied, “Then why do I feel like you don’t know much about the academy?”

Yang Ye said, “I came from a remote place, so I don’t know much about all of that. Please excuse me, excuse me!”

All of them came to a sudden understanding when they heard him, and then Leng Yuran explained, “We have to hunt and kill at least 50 Exalt Realm demon beasts to enter the A Class. Brother, do you think that’s a simple goal to accomplish?”

Yang Ye spoke instinctively, “It isn’t that difficult!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Leng Yuran and the others revealed quite unsightly expressions on their faces when they heard him. Only Tang Xiaorou fully agreed with Yang Ye because the Exalt Realm demon beast from before had been instantly killed by a single punch from Yang Ye.

Of course, she didn’t dare speak about it. Because while the man who stood before her seemed to be completely harmless, she would never forget how he was like when he was angry!

Yang Ye noticed that what he said wasn’t very suitable as well, so he smiled embarrassedly and said, “I’m saying that it wouldn’t be difficult for us to gather around 50 each with our joint forces!”

Leng Yuran glanced at him and said, “So all of you agree?”

“No problem!” The man in an embroidered robe replied, “The strength of a single person is too weak in the end. If we join forces, then we’ll definitely be able to gain much more than we would have been on our own!”

The black robed man said, “I have no problem as well!”

Man Li suddenly said, “Everyone, then we’ll be taking our leave!” After all, he didn’t feel safe at all while being amidst these fellows.

As soon as he finished speaking, he gazed at Tang Xiaorou and said, “Xiaorou, will you be coming with us, or?”

Tang Xiaorou glanced at Chu Yue and said, “Both of you go on your own. I intend to go with Brother Ye!” When she spoke up to this point, she gazed at Yang Ye and the others, “Don’t worry, I definitely won’t cause trouble for all of you!”

Leng Yuran pondered deeply for a moment and said, “You can go with us. However, we won’t take care of your if you encounter any danger. Moreover, you have to help if you want to get a share of the inner cores. Otherwise, we won’t give it to you for nothing!”

“Alright!” Tang Xiaorou hurriedly nodded.

“Take care!” Man Li and Chu Yue vanished from their fields of vision.

“Let’s go!” Leng Yuran's figure flashed towards the distance once he finished speaking, and the others immediately followed behind him.

It didn’t take long for them to sense over a dozen powerful auras, and besides the auras of demon beasts, the auras of humans were present there as well.

Leng Yuran stopped moving and spoke in a low voice, “We’re too late!”

In the blink of an eye, his eyes lit up as he said, “Not, we’re just in time! Hehehe....”

There were 2 men and a woman locked in intense combat with over a dozen demon beasts there, and the corpses of a few demon beasts were lying on the ground. However, it was clearly quite strenuous for them, and they were completely suppressed by the joint forces of those demon beasts. So not to mention turning the tides of the battle, even escaping was a problem for them. After all, the speed of Exalt Realm demon beasts wasn’t inferior to the speed of humans at all!

“Let’s wait and reap the benefits!” The man in an embroidered rope had a slightly evil smile on the corners of his mouth.

“Of course!” The black robed man nodded in agreement.

Yang Ye didn’t speak. The test was cruel from the moment it began, or it should be said to be one where they could use every means at their disposal. While it was quite cruel, Yang Ye had no doubt that those who passed the test in the end would definitely be elites amongst elites.

“Brothers who are watching from afar, we are friends of Feng Wuchao. We’ll definitely reward you heavily if you lend us a hand!” A voice suddenly resounded from afar.

Feng Wuchao? Yang Ye’s brows knit slightly together. He gazed at Leng Yuran and the others, and he noticed that they had slightly unsightly and solemn expressions on their faces.

“There are many participants in the recruitment test, but only 4 can be considered to be the strongest. Those 4 are Li Maozhen, Yu Wujiao, Mo Xinyu, and Feng Wuchao. Every single one of them is a genius amongst geniuses. Not to mention Exalt Realm demon beasts, they are even capable of killing Monarch Realm demon beasts.” Leng Yuran noticed Yang Ye’s bewildered expression and explained.

Li Maozhen is here as well? Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment and said, “So what does that have to do with us?”

Leng Yuran rolled his eyes at Yang Ye and said, “Do you think Feng Wuchao would let us live if he found out that we didn’t just stand by idly, and we even took advantage of the situation? Alas, what bad luck. I thought we’d encountered something good, but I never expected it to be trouble instead!” As soon as he finished speaking, Leng Yuran charged towards the group of demon beasts.

The black robed man and the man in an embroidered robe immediately charged over as well. Meanwhile, Yang Ye hesitated for a moment before he followed after them.

Once they joined the battle, the situation was instantly turned around, and those demon beasts were killed in a short while.

After they finished killing all the demon beasts, the white robed man who led the group cupped his hands towards Yang Ye’s group, “Thank you for the assistance!”

While he was expressing his gratitude, he’d put away all the inner cores of those dead demon beasts into his own pockets.

“Why are you even thanking them? They were hiding in the shadows waiting for a chance to take advantage of the situation and reap the benefits! They might have even stabbed us in the back if they hadn’t heard us speak of my cousin brother’s name!” It was the woman who spoke these words. She was around the age of 20 and rather beautiful. However, her face was currently covered in an icy cold expression of ridicule, and she seemed to be angry that Leng Yuran and the others hadn’t lent them a hand right away.

The faces of the black robed man and the man in an embroidered robe became gloomy when they heard this. They were about to speak but Leng Yuran stopped them and said, “It’s fine, we only lifted a hand. Farewell!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Leng Yuran turned around and led them away.

“Good riddance!” The white robed man who led the group grinned.

Suddenly, the woman said, “Wait!”

Leng Yuran and the others stopped before turning around to gaze at her. She pointed at the violet mink who had its paws around Yang Ye’s neck while it slept soundly and said, “All of you can leave, but leave that little fellow behind.”

Leng Yuran and the others gazed at Yang Ye. Yang Ye shook his head and said, “No. She prefers to be with me!”

She suddenly walked towards Yang Ye while coldness filled her eyes, “You should feel honored that I’m asking for her from you!”

“Don’t act like that, alright?” Yang Ye continued, “They told me that I should keep a low profile. I’ll be in a really difficult position if you insist on acting like this.”

She stopped moving and said, “I’ve changed my mind!”

Yang Ye smiled, “That’s right!”

However, she continued, “Not only must you give me that little fellow, all of you must hand over the inner cores in your possessions!”

Yang Ye’s smile froze on his face....
