Chapter 1952 – One of the Two Emperors!

The city wall was sliced open!

Everyone on the city wall was shocked!

They gazed at Yang Ye while fear filled their eyes!

Yang Ye walked towards the city. There was a middle aged man on the sliced open part of the city wall, and it was the middle aged man who’d spoken earlier!

The middle aged man glanced at Yang Ye’s sword and gazed at Yang Ye, “Who are you?”

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath and just swung his sword!

Om!

A sword howl resounded, and then sword energy tore through the air. It was so swift that most weren’t able to catch sight of it.

Boom!

The spot where the middle aged man stood was instantly sliced into bits, and the middle aged man himself was blasted over 1km away!

Yang Ye pointed his sword at the middle aged man who had shock covering his face, “Shut up!”

He suddenly turned around and gazed at the spear wielding man who similarly had a fearful expression on his face.

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath. He just stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that shot towards the spear wielding man.

The man was horrified. His profound energy surged madly, and then he grabbed his spear with both hands and swung it.

The space around his spear instantly cracked open!

Bang!

However, the man and his spear were blasted around 10km away. As soon he stopped himself, a mouthful of blood sprayed from him. Meanwhile, his eyes suddenly opened wide while the hairs throughout his body stood on end.

It was because a sword had appeared before his forehead!

It was many times faster than the previous attack!

Split Second!

Hiss!

The ray of light pierced through the spear wielding man’s forehead.

The man’s figure stiffened on the spot, and then the color in his eyes started to vanish.

A 3rd stage Enlightened Realm expert had been killed with two attacks!

This time, the fear in their eyes had been transformed into shock and terror!

Yang Ye lowered his sword and gazed at the man with the bow, “It’s your turn now!”

He was about to attack once he finished speaking, but a voice suddenly resounded, “Are you here to declare war against my Sky Residence City?”

As soon as the voice finished resounding, an old man in a black robe suddenly appeared not too far away from Yang Ye.

A Hear Dao Realm expert!

Sky Residence City!

Yang Ye frowned slightly. He thought about it for a while before he finally recalled that it was one of the three powers in this area!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. At this moment, he noticed a few powerful auras hidden in the surroundings, and all of them were in the Dao Realm!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and looked up at the old man, “Declare war against Sky Residence City? I don’t have such intentions for now.” He glanced at the corpse of the spear wielding man and continued, “Earlier, I was merely passing by, yet your people attacked me. What? Do you think I’m easy to bully?”

The old man spoke in a low voice, “We attacked because you brought devil men towards us.”

Devil men!

Yang Ye chuckled, “I was being pursued by them and ended up here by chance, yet you shot at me. If I didn’t have some ability, I would be a corpse by now. So, I want an explanation.”

An explanation!

The old man’s face became gloomy, “You killed a member of my city and destroyed the wall of a subordinate city of Sky Residence City. But you still want an explanation from us? Do you think we’re nice to bully?”

“Sky Residence City isn’t easy to bully?” A thought appeared in Yang Ye’s mind, and he suddenly howled, “Then do you think we Dire Wolves are easy to bully?!”

The Dire Wolves was one of the three powers in this area!

The old man spoke solemnly, “You’re from the Dire Wolves!”

Yang Ye said, “Let’s ignore all of that. Now, I just want an explanation!”

The old man looked up at Yang Ye, “What if we refuse?”

“Then I’ll get it myself!” As soon as he finished speaking, a wave of mysterious energy appeared, and then a ray of light flashed.

The Sword Domain combined with Split Second!

At this moment, its might couldn’t be compared to the same attack he’d used in the past.

Besides the old man and the other powerful auras hiding in the shadows, the others weren’t even able to catch sight of Yang Ye’s attack!

Because it was too quick!

While the old man could see it, he couldn’t stop it!

The man with the bow’s expression changed drastically when Yang Ye attacked, and then a golden shield appeared before him.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s attack arrived!

Hiss!

The sword energy pierced through the golden shield, and then it didn’t slow down at all and pierced through the man’s body.

In an instant, the surroundings fell silent.

A breath of time later, the golden shield split into two, and so did the man’s body.

This time, the shield hadn’t been able to save him!

The old man’s face instantly became gloomy. He stared at Yang Ye and said, “You’re courting death!”

He was about to attack once he finished speaking.

“Wait!” However, a voice suddenly came from within the city, and then everyone looked over.

A young man was walking over slowly. He looked to be around the age of 27 or 28. He wore an embroidered robe, and he had a calm and composed bearing.

The old man’s expression changed slightly when he saw the young man, and then he hurriedly went over to the young man, “Young Master, what are you doing here?”

The young man smiled, “Father asked me to have a look!”

The old man said, “I’ll deal with it!”

The young man smiled, “It’s fine. Leave it to me!”

The old man nodded slightly and went behind the young man.

The young man gazed at Yang Ye, “May I know your name?”

Yang Ye sized up the young man and replied, “Yang Ye!”

The young man smiled, “I’m Qin Chuan.” He glanced at the corpses at the side, “I’ve heard about what happened. Brother Yang, how about we make a bet?”

“A bet?” Yang Ye smiled, “What bet?”

Qin Chuan replied, “You’ve killed my people. I don’t care what the reason was, all I do know is that you killed my people. So, let’s compete. If I can’t defeat you within 10 moves, then I’ll let you leave. But if I defeat you, then you must join Sky Residence City and serve me!”

Join Sky Residence City!

Yang Ye chuckled, “What if I refuse?”

Qin Chuan replied, “If you think you can escape from a few Hear Dao Realm experts, then you can try it!”

10 moves!

Yang Ye sized up Qin Chuan. He couldn’t see through Qin Chuan’s cultivation, and he felt a little unfathomable to Yang Ye.

Qin Chuan wasn’t ordinary at all!

It was obvious from the old man’s attitude towards Qin Chuan. The respect the old man showed him was heartfelt, and it wasn’t because Qin Chuan was the old man’s young master.

Since he was able to make a Hear Dao Realm expert act so respectfully to him, he was clearly not an ordinary person!

However, when had Yang Ye ever feared anyone?

Yang Ye smiled, “10 moves. Come! Let me see how you’ll defeat me in 10 moves!”

Qin Chuan smiled, “As you wish!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye, and then tapped his finger in Yang Ye’s direction.

Yang Ye didn’t use his sword and slammed his fist forward.

However, as soon as his fist collided with Qin Chuan’s finger, his expression changed. It was because the Qin Chuan in front of him wasn’t Qin Chuan’s body at all. Yang Ye’s reaction was extremely quick, and he immediately turned around and slammed his fist forward!

But it hit nothing!

There was no one there!

Suddenly, a finger tapped against his back.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s figure was pushed away. As his figure was being pushed, Qin Chuan suddenly appeared in front of him, and there was an evil smile on the corners of his mouth.

Yang Ye swung his fist forward again, but it still missed!

The entire expanse of space here shook violently!

Suddenly, Qin Chuan appeared behind Yang Ye, and his palm pressed down on Yang Ye’s back.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s figure was blasted away, but while his figure flew, Qin Chuan suddenly appeared in front of him again.

This time, Yang Ye didn’t swing a punch, and he closed his eyes instead!

Based on the situation from the previous collisions, Qin Chuan’s speed was much faster than his own. So, he couldn’t see Qin Chuan by relying on his eyes. Not only was he unable to catch sight of Qin Chuan, it was extremely easy for Qin Chuan to trick him. So, he chose to close his eyes and look with his heart!

Suddenly, a hand pressed down upon his chest.

It just appeared out of nowhere. Yang Ye was still unable to dodge it, but his hand had moved!

Bang! Bang!

Two muffled explosions resounded, and then two figures were pushed away from each other.

It was Yang Ye and Qin Chuan’s figures!

Qin Chuan glanced at his chest, there was a fist imprint there. Yang Ye had left it on him while he slapped Yang Ye’s chest just now.

Qin Chuan moved his gaze away and looked at Yang Ye, “An extraordinarily strong body, and an exceptionally good reaction speed as well. Incredible!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was above Qin Chuan when he appeared once more. An instant later, an ethereal dragon claw slammed down at Qin Chuan.

Boom!

A figure was blasted away.

It wasn’t Qin Chuan, it was Yang Ye!

Meanwhile, Qin Chuan suddenly started walking slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, “You’re human, so I presume you’ve heard of the 1 King, 2 Emperors, 3 Saints, and 6 Greats of the human race. Do you know who I am?”

A smile curled up on the corners of Qin Chuan’s mouth, “I’m one of the 2 Emperors!”
