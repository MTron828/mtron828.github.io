Chapter 1699 - I Kill With Every Ten Steps I Take!

A lefty!

Qiong Qi wasn’t wrong, Yang Ye was a lefty right now. Because he couldn’t use his right hand at all, nor did he dare to use it. The Wargod’s arm was way beyond his capabilities. Once he unsealed it, then not to mention the people around him, even he would be in danger!

A lefty! Yang Ye glanced at his left hand, and he had a very gloomy expression on his face. He usually used his right hand. Now that he had to use his left hand, he wouldn’t just be unaccustomed to it; the most important part was that his strength would definitely decline tremendously!

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time. He was just about to speak when he suddenly looked up towards the left, “Show yourself!”

As soon as he finished speaking, space there trembled, and then an old man walked out slowly.

Yang Ye knew the old man. It was the Wu Clan’s Grand Elder!

Yang Ye gazed at An Nanjing. He had no doubt that the Grand Elder of the Wu Clan was here for her.

An Nanjing pondered deeply for a moment and was about to speak. But the Wu Clan’s Grand Elder spoke abruptly, “Miss An, don’t you want to grow stronger?”

An Nanjing gazed at the Grand Elder, “What are you trying to say?”

The Grand Elder spoke solemnly, “Miss An, my Wu Clan is aware that you want to stay by Yang Ye’s side. However, you won’t be able to grow swiftly while you stay by his side.”

An Nanjing looked him in the eyes, “And I can do that in the Wu Clan?”

The Grand Elder answered her without the slightest hesitation, “Yes!”

“What makes you so confident?” It was Yang Ye who asked this question.

The Grand Elder looked them in the eye, “Because the soul of my ancestor has arrived. He came especially for Miss An.”

“Wu Mu?” Yang Ye frowned, “He came for her? What do you mean?”

The Grand Elder nodded, “My ancestor wants to give her his entire inheritance.” The Grand Elder’s face became slightly uncomfortable at this point.

Wu Mu’s inheritance was something everyone in the Wu Clan dreamed of obtaining! Yet now, Wu Mu was giving it to an outsider. So, it wasn’t just him, even everyone in the Wu Clan felt quite unhappy, but no one dared to object to it!

Yang Ye looked the Grand Elder in the eye and asked, “Why is your ancestor giving his inheritance to her and not your Wu Clan?!”

The Grand Elder laughed bitterly, “Even though he didn’t say anything, we know that it’s because no one in the Wu Clan is suitable. Or I should say that no one is qualified. My ancestor has no ill intent towards her, and neither does my Wu Clan. My ancestor wants to give her his inheritance because he thinks highly of her natural talent.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “Of course, my ancestor did say that Miss An can decide if she wants to accept it or not. If she isn’t willing, then he won’t force her. However, the doors of my Wu Clan will always be open for Miss An!”

“Then can you open it for me too?” Yang Ye suddenly said, “Er, Grand Elder… See, my natural talent isn’t bad either. I’m really willing to join the Wu Clan and learn from it!”

The corners of the Grand Elder’s eyes twitched. He glanced at Yang Ye and laughed bitterly again, “If it was before this, then it would naturally not be a problem. But now…” He didn’t continue speaking once he spoke up to this point.

Yang Ye was irreconcilable enemies with the Yang Clan. If the Wu Clan took Yang Ye in now, then it would be equivalent to going to war with the Yang Clan. Even though the Wu Clan didn’t fear the Yang Clan, it didn’t have to go to war with the Yang Clan!

Yang Ye smiled, “I was joking.” He gazed at An Nanjing as he spoke.

A long moment of silence ensued before An Nanjing gazed at Yang Ye, “I want to go to the Wu Clan.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I support your decision.” Even though he wanted her to stay by his side, he didn’t want to hinder her growth.

She gazed at him and asked, “You’ll be going back to the Yang Clan, right?”

The Yang Clan! A wisp of gloominess flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, “Of course! Of course I will!”

How could he forget what the Yang Clan had done to him?

He intended to make them pay a hundredfold for what they’d done!

An Nanjing nodded slightly, “Don’t forget to let me know when you’re heading back! I’ll go with you!” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye replied, “Of course!”

An Nanjing didn’t say anything. She just gazed at the Grand Elder. The latter nodded and was about to leave. But he suddenly seemed to have thought of something. He hesitated for a moment before he gazed at Yang Ye, “I think that you should go to a place. Perhaps you’ll gain something there!”

Yang Ye asked, “Where?”

The Wu Clan’s Grand Elder fell silent for a few moments and said, “Phoenix Cry Mountain.”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What’s that place?”

The Grand Elder spoke solemnly, “The place where a sword cultivator fell.”

Yang Ye’s eyes lit up, “Was it where the owner of the wooden sword fell?”

The Grand Elder shook his head slightly, “In terms of cultivation in the Sword Dao, that existence who fell at Phoenix Cry Mountain is much greater than the owner of that wooden sword. He’s a cultivator who started from the small universe in Milky Way System. When he arrived in the medium universe, his swift and elusive sword technique shocked countless experts here. Because his sword technique carried a scholarly and righteous aura, he was also called the Sword Immortal.”

The Sword Immortal! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Was he killed?”

The Grand Elder shook his head, “I don’t know. After he died, the place where he fell, Phoenix Cry Mountain, was covered by a huge Green Lotus Sword Formation which his sword created. So, outsiders are unable to enter at all. As time passed, the sword formation grew weaker and weaker. Thus, many people and especially sword cultivators are rushing to Phoenix Cry Mountain with the hopes of laying eyes on him. Of course, even more hope to obtain his inheritance!”

The Grand Elder glanced at Yang Ye at this point, and then he continued, “You’re a sword cultivator, so you can go have a look. However, you must be careful because the Yang Clan is looking everywhere for you.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I will!”

The Wu Clan’s Grand Elder nodded slightly, “Farewell!”

He turned around and left once he finished speaking.

An Nanjing gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before she said, “I’ll be waiting for you!” She turned around and vanished on the spot as well.

Once she left, Yang Ye took a deep breath and gazed at Qiong Qi, “Brother, are you alright?”

Qiong Qi spoke angrily, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye smiled embarrassedly, and then he spoke seriously, “Both of us need to grow stronger!”

This time, he’d relied on numerous trump cards to escape the Yang Clan. Simply speaking, the gap between him and the Yang Clan was still extremely huge. If he wanted to take revenge, he would be dreaming if he thought he could accomplish it with his current strength.

“Of course we have to!” Qiong Qi spoke fiercely, “Kid, let me tell you this. I really can’t stand the sight of that Yang Clan of yours. So, I’ve decided to attack them with you and cleanse this humiliation I’ve suffered today!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Of course we will!”

After that, Yang Ye and Qiong Qi started to heal themselves. Both of them were completely exhausted during the battle. It was especially so for Yang Ye. His body was exhausted to the limit after suffering backlash from the strength he used during the battle.

If it wasn’t for the Primordial Violet Energy he had, he would be dead by now.

In the 3rd level. Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground while countless strands of Primordial Violet Energy were swiftly repairing his body.

Snowy, Zi’er, and Xiao Yuxi weren’t very far away from where he sat.

At this moment, all of them were looking at him with worried expressions on their faces. It was especially so for Snowy. The rims of her eyes were filled with mist, and it seemed like they would converge into pearls of water at any moment.

Four hours later, Yang Ye opened his eyes slowly. As soon as his eyes opened, Snowy pounced into his arms and ceaselessly rubbed her head against his chest.

Yang Ye rubbed her head gently while a wisp of gentleness flashed through his eyes. After that, he gazed at Zi’er and Xiao Yuxi, “I’m sorry for making all of you worry.”

Xiao Yuxi shook her head slightly and remained silent.

Zi’er walked over to him and spoke softly, “Be careful next time.”

Yang Ye smiled as he nodded. After that, he didn’t leave the Primordial Pagoda immediately, and he accompanied them for some time.

Since he left Merak System for the Milky Way System, he hadn’t spent time with them for a long time.

The happiest was definitely Snowy.

As far as Snowy was concerned, the happiest thing was to play with Yang Ye. She didn’t think too much about anything, and she just wanted to play. Play happily to her heart’s content.

However, the situation with the wooden sword made Yang Ye feel quite depressed. Because it was unwilling to let him get close to it. According to Snowy, the wooden sword could sense the powerful slaughter intent and viciousness that he had. Fortunately, it was willing to let him use it on a monthly basis because of Snowy.

Yang Ye didn’t try to ask for more because he didn’t want to rely on it too much!

Three days later, Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda and traveled to Phoenix Cry Mountain.

He needed to improve his strength, so he wouldn’t let go of any chance to improve his strength. Moreover, he wanted to see that legendary Sword Immortal!

Because Yang Xuan had given him a map that day, it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to find Phoenix Cry Mountain. For the sake of avoiding unnecessary trouble, Yang Ye covered himself beneath a green robe, and it completely concealed his appearance.

Three days later, Yang Ye arrived at Sword Immortal City.

Sword Immortal City was below Phoenix Cry Mountain. It wasn’t called Sword Immortal City in the beginning, but because of Phoenix Cry Mountain and the fact that the Sword Immortal had stayed here in the past, it was called Sword Immortal City.

Yang Ye didn’t fly into the city. He descended to the ground outside the city because there was an anti-flight formation above the city.

Even though the formation was nothing to him, he didn’t want to cause trouble. He wasn’t here to cause trouble.

Right when Yang Ye was about to enter the city, he suddenly stopped and looked up at the wall on his left. There was a row of words there — I kill with every ten steps I take, and no one can stop me…
