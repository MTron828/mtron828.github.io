Chapter 2053 – Librarian!

Yang Ye seemed visibly embarrassed. He was about to speak when the middle aged man turned around and left.

Yang Ye looked off into the distance and was stunned on the spot.

Am I supposed to leave just like this?

Suddenly, the young man from before appeared once more in front of Yang Ye. He sized up Yang Ye and said, “Brother, you’re really bold to have dared to be late. Luckily, you haven’t joined the academy, otherwise, you’d definitely suffer for acting like this.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “It can’t be helped. I was delayed due to certain reasons.”

The young man hesitated for a moment and said, “Actually, you still have a chance.”

“Huh?” Yang Ye gazed at the young man, “What chance?”

The young man explained, “There’s a library in the academy, and it’s called the Worlds. Now, it’s recruiting librarians. So, you can give it a chance. Once five years pass and the academy is recruiting again, you can apply to join the academy!”

“A librarian?” Yang Ye had quite a strange expression on his face. He wants me to be a librarian?

The young man nodded, “It’s a very simple job. You just record who borrowed what, and then go look for those people who haven’t returned their books on time. It’s really very simple. What do you think?”

Yang Ye frowned slightly. He was about to refuse, but the young man added, “Brother, just think about it. If you leave now, what would those who back you think? I think that getting an invitation was probably not easy for them, right? How disappointed would they be if you leave now?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment. True, if I go back now, it would definitely be embarrassing. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

After all, Zhong Ye had gone to great lengths to get him the admission letter.

Meanwhile, the young man hurriedly added, “If you work in the library and do well to the point that an instructor likes you, then perhaps you’ll be able to immediately join the academy!”

“True…” Yang Ye thought for a while before he nodded. As far as he was concerned, getting into the academy’s grounds for now was the most important.

A wisp of happiness flashed through the young man’s eyes when he saw Yang Ye nod, but it vanished in an instant.

The young man hurriedly said, “Brother, please come with me!”

He hurriedly led the way once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye glanced at the young man and just followed him.

Yang Ye followed the young man and arrived safely before the city’s entrance. There were three large black words above the entrance — Martial Emperor City.

Martial Emperor City?

Yang Ye sized up the city. It wasn’t huge and could only accommodate around 100,000 people.

Once they entered the city, Yang Ye noticed that there weren’t many people in the city.

Yang Ye gazed at the young man, “Brother Qin Lang, who are they?”

Yang Ye had gotten to know the young man’s name while they chatted earlier.

Qin Lang smiled, “Most of them are the family of students and instructors. As for some others, they are outsiders, but they are no ordinary outsiders. Most of them are special people. For example, formation experts, talisman experts, equipment refinement experts… In short, those allowed into Martial Emperor City are no ordinary people.

Yang Ye fell silent. He glanced at the city, and he knew that it was no ordinary city!

Meanwhile, Qin Lang suddenly said, “This is Martial Emperor Academy!”

Yang Ye looked up and was stunned. He gazed at Qin Lang, “Are you sure?”

Yang Ye was shocked because the entrance to the academy was truly too ordinary.

It was a bamboo door, and there were three words on it — Martial Emperor Academy.

Yang Ye hadn’t looked carefully behind the bamboo door yet.

Qin Lang smiled, “My reaction was just like yours. Come on, you’ll get used to it!”

Qin Lang entered once he finished speaking.

The scene before Yang Ye’s eyes instantly changed once he passed through the bamboo door.

A mountain range!

At this moment, they were in a boundless mountain range, and it simply seemed endless.

“Let’s go!” Qin Lang smiled and waved his hand. In an instant, a ray of light appeared beneath his feet, and then he vanished into the distance.

Yang Ye immediately followed him.

A short while later, Yang Ye stopped. There were golden buildings not too far ahead, and from this angle, it seemed like the buildings and mountains formed the big dipper.

“The Big Dipper Formation!” Meanwhile, Qin Lang smiled, “It’s extremely powerful. I heard that mysterious spirits are being held beneath each of the seven peaks. Unfortunately, I’ve never had the chance to see those spirits.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Qin Lang smiled, “Because no one dares to cause trouble here!”

Qin Lang sped up once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye glanced at the mountains and followed Qin Lang.

Qin Lang didn’t take Yang Ye to any of the seven peaks, and he led Yang Ye to a smaller mountain at a corner. It wasn’t very far from the seven main peaks, and it was one of the other mountains in the mountain range.

The seven peaks were the main peaks, and there were countless other mountains surrounding them.

There was a black tower on this mountain, and light coiled around its top.

Qin Lang led Yang Ye to the black tower and said, “This is the Worlds, our academy’s library. There are countless ancient books in it, and they have records of all kinds of strange and miraculous things. It can be said that it’s the most complete library in our universe.”

Yang Ye asked, “All of them are available to everyone?”

“Of course not!” Qin Lang grinned, “It has four levels, and every single level contains different records. The higher level has the most ancient and rarest records. As for entering the library to read or borrow books, it requires Student Points!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Student Points?”

Qin Lang had a solemn expression on his face, “Student points are linked to every student’s fate in the academy. There are no limits to student points, and you can earn them through monthly tests, like written tests and combat tests. Besides that, you can gain them from missions. However, while there are no upper limits, there is a lower limit. Every six months, the academy will expel all students who don’t possess enough student points. If a student doesn’t have 90 points when the time comes, that student will be immediately expelled.”

He spoke bitterly at this point, “Just being expelled isn’t that bad, but it doesn’t end there, the names of every expelled student will be recorded on the Pillar of Shame on Martial Mountain. Sigh, it’s such an embarrassment! Not only to the person, but to that person’s clan and organization. Because information about the person like the name, clan, organization, etc. are recorded too. Anyway, it’s horrible!”

Yang Ye smiled. He felt that these rules were quite interesting, and it was capable of really motivating the students to work hard.

Meanwhile, Qin Lang said, “Brother Yang, come with me. I’ll introduce you to everything!”

As he spoke, he led Yang Ye to the first level of Worlds. There was a small stone table at the entrance, and a thick black scroll was on the table.

Qin Lang explained, “Brother Yang, I’ll go report your name to the higher-ups later, and then you’ll be a librarian. Librarians are compensated, and you’ll get five student points every month. You can use them to exchange for a lot of things. It can be said that so long as you possess enough student points, even Sage Rank treasures and techniques, or even treasures and techniques above the Sage Rank can be yours. However, most people aren’t able to afford them!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Qin Lang didn’t wait for Yang Ye’s reply and continued, “Your job is very simple. It’s to record the names of those who come to borrow books or read them. 30 points for the 1st level, 60 points for the… In short, everything is recorded in detail within the black scroll before you. You just have to work according to the rules. Remember that you should never offend anyone because you’re just a trainee now, so you aren’t protected by the academy. However, you’ll be acknowledged by the academy in two weeks. At that time, no one will dare to act against you for no reason!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Brother Qin Lang, the librarian before me… Was it you?”

Qin Lang’s face stiffened, and then he nodded.

I knew it! Yang Ye glanced at Qin Lang, “Brother Qin Lang, where do you plan to go now?”

Qin Lang chuckled, “I’ve been working here for three years. Coupled with some missions I’ve completed, I’ve accumulated some student points, and they are sufficient for me to remove my name from the Pillar of Shame.”

Yang Ye was astounded, “You…”

Qin Lang nodded, “I was a student of the academy. But due to certain reasons, I didn’t have sufficient points and was expelled. However, I didn’t leave, and I found a job here instead. Or I should say that I found many jobs, like patrolling the area outside the academy. You encountered me earlier because I was on patrol.”

He took a deep breath and continued, “Now, I have sufficient points. Once I remove my name from that pillar, I plan to cultivate behind closed doors for some time, and then take the exam to join the academy again. Men should stand back up where they fall, right?”

Yang Ye smiled and nodded, “I support you!”

Qin Lang roared with laughter and flicked a car onto the table before Yang Ye, “There are five points in there. Take it as a gift from me. Don’t refuse because it won’t be long before you realize how helpful those five points are to you. Brother Yang, see you!”

He vanished into the distance once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye smiled, shook his head, and looked towards the side, “The Worlds… A librarian…”
