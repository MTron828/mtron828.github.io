Chapter 1983 – People from the Weapon Path!

It has met me before? Yang Ye walked over to the sword, “Look carefully.”

The sword fell silent.

A long time passed before the sword spoke once more, “I see!”

Yang Ye asked, “What?”

The sword trembled and said, “Do you know who you are?”

“Who I am?” Yang Ye chuckled, “I don’t really understand what you’re trying to say. You say that you know me, and as far as I’m concerned, you should disdain to lie to me or play tricks like this. So, can you give me an explanation?”

“It’s meaningless!” The sword replied, “The past is the past, and the present is the present. Telling you about the past is meaningless to your present self, right?”

Yang Ye scanned the sword and said, “You’re much different than I expected! They say you fell into darkness, but as far as I’m concerned, your mind is clear!”

“Darkness?” The sword chuckled, “Haven’t you fallen into darkness too?”

Yang Ye frowned, “What do you mean?”

The sword replied, “Those who follow their heart are devils!”

Yang Ye fell silent.

What did that mean? It meant that one did things according to one’s truest thoughts. Such people were extremely true to themselves and others, but they were absolutely insane.

Meanwhile, the sword said, “Some sages of the Confucianist Path once said that people were born good. But is that really true? Actually, people are born both good and evil. What is good? What is evil? Who doesn’t have evil in their heart? Good and evil coexist. Just like you. You’re evil when you’re evil, and good when you’re good. Right?”

Good and evil coexist!

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he shook his head, “I’m not interested in discussing these things. All I want to know is whether you want to leave this place.”

The sword fell silent!

Yang Ye was in no hurry, and he just stood there and waited.

A long time passed before Judgment asked, “What are your conditions?”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth curled up. It’s quite sensible.

Yang Ye was about to speak when Judgment spoke again, “I think you’re not that immature as to ask me to submit to you. I’m not looking down on you, but your current strength is far from sufficient to make me acknowledge you as my master. I would have been willing to follow the you from the past, and I…”

Judgment suddenly stopped at this point.

“Me from the past?” Yang Ye frowned, “Can you explain that?”

The sword fell silent again.

“Fine!” Yang Ye said, “Let’s put that aside and talk about the conditions. I don’t need you to submit to me, and I don’t need you to acknowledge me as your master. I only have one request, and that’s to use you three times a month. Three years! I’ll return your freedom to you in three years!”

Three years!

As far as Yang Ye was concerned, three years were enough.

The sword fell silent for a long time. In the end, it shook and said, “How will you save me?”

The sword agreed!

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth curled up. He was about to speak when Judgment spoke again, “It isn’t these chains that trap me, it’s the symbols on the walls. I can break free if you’re able to destroy those symbols!”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and asked, “Can the Weapon Seal do that?”

Judgment suddenly said, “You’re his successor!”

“Successor?” Yang Ye chuckled, “No, I just obtained this by chance. So, why did he trap all of you here? Wasn’t he your master?”

Judgment suddenly asked, “Do you know why this line suffered such a terrible defeat?”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Judgment replied, “Because of the 12 of us!”

Yang Ye asked, “What do you mean?”

Judgment explained, “Because we attacked our master at the critical moment!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Judgment said, “Those 11 swords weren’t born vicious. For the sake of making them even stronger, the master of this cemetery forcefully utilized evil methods to refine them into vicious swords, and then used the weapons seal to control them. If the weapon seal is destroyed, their sword spirits will be destroyed as well!”

Yang Ye immediately came to an understanding when he heard this. So that’s why they wanted the weapon seal!

Meanwhile, Judgment continued, “Freedom! Is there any being in this world that doesn’t long for freedom? He took our freedom and enslaved us by force. Just think about it, how could we be willing to let him control us? At the critical moment in his battle with another, we suddenly attacked him and caused him to be utterly defeated!”

They attacked their own master!

Yang Ye glanced at Judgment. So these fellows actually caused the death of their master all those years ago!

However, it did make sense. The Seal Master of the Slaughter Line hadn’t been able to truly subdue them, so it was normal for him to have suffered such an end!

Judgment said, “You have the weapon seal, so you’re naturally able to destroy these symbols with ease. However, are you really going to let me out? You don’t seem to have the strength to resist me if you let me out right now!”

Yang Ye asked, “Will you kill me after I save you?”

Judgment replied with a question, “Why don’t you give it a guess?”

Yang Ye didn’t say anything, and he just withdrew the weapon seal. In an instant, the symbols on the walls started trembling, and then the symbols gradually vanished.

Suddenly, Judgment started trembling.

Yang Ye moved a short distance backwards.

Boom!

The chains that were around Judgment suddenly exploded apart.

“I’m finally free again!” Judgment’s voice resounded.

Yang Ye watched silently.

A short while later, Judgment floated over to Yang Ye, “Hold tight!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to grab Judgment’s hilt.

As soon as he did that, Yang Ye’s eyes opened wide. He felt like something within him was vanishing rapidly!

Suddenly, Judgment struggled free of his grasp.

At this moment, Yang Ye’s countenance was ghastly pale!

Yang Ye asked, “What was that?”

Judgment explained, “Soul absorption! That’s my ability. However, it doesn’t just seize the souls of the enemy, it seizes the soul of the one who wields me. If you hold me tight, your soul will flow out rapidly. You’ll lose your soul in 15 minutes at most!”

Soul absorption!

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and asked, “You can’t control it?”

“I can!” Judgment replied, “I was controlling it just now. Otherwise, you would be dead by now. Based on your current strength and combined with my own control, you’re only able to use me once a month, at most. You must nurture your soul after using me.”

Once a month!

Yang Ye asked, “How strong would I be while using you?”

Judgment replied, “Anyone below the Zen Realm will die upon coming in contact with me!”

Anyone below the Zen Realm! Yang Ye’s pupils constricted slightly. Isn’t it a little too terrifying?

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and then the Sword Supreme appeared in his grasp.

“What…” Judgment suddenly exclaimed, “That’s the Sword Supreme!”

There was a trace of surprise in Yang Ye’s eyes, “You recognize it?”

Judgment replied, “During our time, there were two swords that were extremely terrifying! It’s one of the two, and it’s called the Sword Supreme. Of course, it’s worthy of that title.”

Yang Ye asked, “Two swords? What about the other sword?”

Judgment replied, “Perhaps you’ll find out in the future.” He paused for a moment and continued, “What’s it doing in your possession?”

Yang Ye answered, “I got it by chance!”

Judgment fell silent for a long time, and then it said, “Its sword spirit is in deep sleep.”

Yang Ye said, “I know!”

Judgment said, “Three years. I’ll leave after three years pass!”

As soon as it finished speaking, Judgment transformed into a ray of black light that entered Yang Ye’s forehead, and then a small black sword appeared on Yang Ye’s forehead.

Meanwhile, it said, “Staying in your sea of consciousness to nurture myself will help me recover swiftly!”

Yang Ye asked, “You’re injured?”

Judgment replied, “It’s nothing. I’ll recover in a few years!”

A few years… Yang Ye laughed bitterly. A few years… or even a few dozen years are probably just an instant for these swords!

YY took a deep breath on the spot. I’ve finally collected all 12 swords!Unfortunately, I can’t use them for now!Yang Ye shook his head and vanished on the spot.

He left the Weapon Cemetery and was about to leave the city when a man in an embroidered robe walked over from afar.

The man was around the age of 27. He had a heroic look, and he seemed very handsome.

He was holding a sheathed sword.

The man frowned when he saw Yang Ye, “You came from in there?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The young man glanced at the city and said, “The Seal Master said that the 12 swords hidden in this weapon cemetery will emerge into the world. If I’m not wrong, they should be in your possession, right?”

Yang Ye frowned, “You’re from the Weapon Path!”

The young man smiled, “The Weapon Path’s Prediction Line.”

He chuckled at this point, “The Seal Master was right as expected. My trip wouldn’t be very smooth. Fortunately, I can also eliminate a survivor of the Slaughter Line!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he started walking slowly in Yang Ye’s direction.

Yang Ye said, “You’re saying that Seal Master of yours predicted that the 12 swords would fall into my hands?”

The young man smiled, “What? You’re very surprised? Besides the mysterious Strategist of the god race, when it comes to prediction and scheming against others, the Seal Master is…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye waved his hand and interrupted the man, “Your line only sent you?”

The young man smiled, “What? I’m not enough?”

Yang Ye chuckled, and then he placed his right hand against his forehead. A moment later, he slowly pulled out a pitch black sword.

A moment later, a ray of black light flashed.

The young man’s expression changed drastically. A moment later, countless rays of light surged out from him like a storm, and they instantly covered the entire sky!

Five breaths of time later, everything returned to normal.

At this moment, Yang Ye was behind the young man.

Yang Ye put the sword away and spoke indifferently, “If your seal master is that good at predicting things, why didn’t he predict what would happen to you? Looks like he isn’t that good, huh?”

As soon as he finished speaking, the young man’s figure stiffened, and his eyes dimmed down.

Suddenly, a voice resounded from behind Yang Ye, “You’re the new seal master of the Slaughter Line?”
