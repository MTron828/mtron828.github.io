Chapter 1343 – Fight To The Death!

The walls around the entire city rumbled and collapsed after the black panther collided against it. As for the experts on the city walls, they flew up into the air to avoid being affected by it. It wasn’t just the humans who moved away, the demon beasts outside the city retreated quickly as well. Even though their bodies were sturdy, they didn’t dare to allow the crumbling wall to slam against them.

After it collapsed the city walls, the final trace of color in the black panther’s eyes vanished before it fell slowly to the ground. As soon as it fell to the ground, its huge body was instantly buried beneath the collapsing rubble.

Roar!

A furious howl resounded abruptly, and it didn’t take long for countless demon beasts to charge at Doomsday City.

The experts of Doomsday City were utterly stunned when they saw the dense expanse of demon beasts charging at them. The eyes of many started to show terror. They naturally felt terror because countless huge demon beasts that were like hills were charging at them. All of the demon beasts had ferocious glows in their eyes and seemed intent on eating them.

It didn’t take long for some overly terrified cultivators to start fleeing.

Suddenly, Ye Liuyun shot down into the city and shouted with fury, “Blade!”

Om!

Sword howls resounded incessantly in the city, and it didn’t take long for over 40 sword cultivators to appear before her.

Ye Liuyun didn’t waste her breath and just pointed at the demon beasts that were surging forward like tidewater, “Stop them!”

Dugu Jian and the others didn’t hesitate to transform into rays of light that charged towards the demon beasts. Dugu Jian and the others were Emperors now. Coupled with the fact that they were sword cultivators who’d comprehended sword intent and were utilizing Emperor Rank equipment, it was absolutely easy for them to pierce the defenses of those demon beasts.

So, once Dugu Jian and the others charged over, the all-powerful army of demon beasts had been stopped around 30m away from the city. But anyone could discern that Blade wouldn’t be able to hold on for long. Because the army of demon beasts was still charging over from afar, so as soon as one was killed, there was always one more to replace it!

Ye Liuyun pointed at Dugu Jian’s group and said, “They won’t retreat, but they’ll die. They may not die now, but it won’t take long. What will happen once they’re dead?”

She pointed at the people here in the city and continued, “Once they’re dead, it’ll be your turn. Look around you, the entire city has been surrounded. Only death will be awaiting you if you retreat, but you’ll have a chance to survive if you fight! Do you want to die or live?”

Everyone felt fear, so she didn’t blame them for that. What she had to do was make them understand the situation that they were in. Just as she’d said, she had to make them realize that only death would come from fleeing, and they would have a chance to live if they fought.

“Live, of course!” Someone in the surroundings howled furiously.

Ye Liuyun nodded, and then she pointed at the demon beasts, “If you want to live, then attack with me!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she paid no further attention to them. She just charged towards the demon beasts in the distance.

Meanwhile, Zi’er patted Snowy’s head lightly and said, “Hide yourself!”

Snowy turned to glance at the demon beasts, blinked, and then quickly nodded. She immediately transformed into a ray of light that vanished between the folds of Zi’er’s clothes at her chest.

Once Snowy hid herself, Zi’er’s figure shot towards the demon beasts.

Even though she was a demon beast, she stood on Yang Ye’s side. Yang Ye and her didn’t differentiate between species. If the human race wanted to kill her, then Yang Ye would definitely kill them. Similarly, if the demon race wasted to kill Yang Ye, then she would definitely kill them.

They only cared about each other, and they disregarded right and wrong.

The human race and demon race entered into close quarter combat. Even though the human race was inferior to the demon race, they had to win or die, so their combat strength was extraordinarily formidable. After all, they were in a hopeless situation with no way out, so they naturally didn’t hold any hope of being lucky.

As far as the humans were concerned, they had a small chance to survive if they fought, and if they died, they would drag some demons down with them!

The humans were being suppressed in battle on the ground. As for the battle in the air, the Demon Empress was being suppressed by Yang Ye.

At this moment, she was trying to hold on with all her might. There were a few dozen injuries all over her body. Besides that, one of her ears had been sliced off. It could be said that she was in an extremely terrible state. But she was still holding on until the demon race completely destroyed the city. So long as the army of demon beasts crushed the city, the demon race would have won!

She intended to keep Yang Ye busy, but Yang Ye couldn’t afford to let that happen. He was very well aware that the human race would definitely lose in close quarter combat with the demon race. It couldn’t be helped; the current strength of the human race was much weaker than the demon race. Even if they had the numbers, the humans wouldn’t be able to gain an advantage over the abnormal defenses of the demon race, let alone now that their numbers were inferior to the demon race!

So, he had to kill the Demon Empress before the demon race’s army fully invaded the city. Only by killing her could the human race turn the situation around!

At this moment, Yang Ye didn’t hold back at all. The boost from the Sword God’s Seal enhanced Yang Ye’s sword intent to an extremely terrifying level. Coupled with the fact that he was an Emperor, his strength in all aspects had risen tremendously. So, even an expert at the Demon Empress’ level could only dodge and avoid direct combat while facing him!

At this moment, he’d defeated her, and he was trying to kill her!

Every second counted!

Regardless of whether it was Yang Ye or the Demon Empress, the army of humans or the army of demon beasts, all of them were seizing every second they had!

It was a battle that would end in the annihilation of a species, so both the human race and demon race couldn’t afford to lose!

The most carefree person here was Mo Xiaoleng. She hadn’t participated in the battle, and she was just standing in the sky and watching coldly. She naturally wanted to join the battle, but so long as she released her flames, Snowy would emerge and target her. This made her feel extremely aggrieved. Because she didn’t even dare to get close to Snowy. So long as she did, Snowy could drag the flames out of her even if she didn’t withdraw them herself!

It could be said that if it wasn’t for Snowy, the human race would have been defeated a long time ago! Because besides Yang Ye, no other human expert here could stop her flames!

Unfortunately, Snowy was here, and Snowy was the reason why she didn’t even dare to get close to Doomsday City!

Mo Xiaoleng was sizing up the surroundings without end, and she seemed to be looking for an opportunity to act. Suddenly, her expression changed, and she looked up into the sky.

Bang!

A terrifying wave of energy suddenly erupted in the sky. In an instant, the space in the sky shook violently, and then the entire expanse of space there collapsed and formed a huge black hole.

It didn’t take long for a figure to be tossed out of the black hole. Mo Xiaoleng’s pupils constricted when she saw that figure. Because it was the Demon Empress!

Mo Xiaoleng was about to lend the Demon Empress a hand. Suddenly, the Demon Empress’ falling figure stopped in midair, and then a blue beam of light swiftly surged out from within her and shot towards the black hole. When the beam of blue light was just halfway to the black hole, a ray of sword energy shot out from within the black hole.

Bang!

As soon as they came into contact, the blue beam of light instantly dispersed, and the ray of light didn’t slow down at all as it shot towards the Demon Empress. However, Mo Xiaoleng was stunned when she saw that the Demon Empress actually wasn’t trying to dodge the attack.

What’s she doing?

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly when he saw that the Demon Empress wasn’t trying to evade his attack, and he felt that something was wrong. However, he couldn’t withdraw his attack now, nor did he want to!

At the instant Yang Ye’s sword arrived before her chest, a wisp of ferocity arose on the corners of the Demon Empress’ mouth. Her palms had suddenly been covered in a layer of ice crystals. Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword was right before her chest.

Hiss! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The sword pierced straight through her chest. But her figure moved slightly to the side at the critical moment and made the sword miss her vital organs. Right when Yang Ye was about to swing his sword horizontally, the Demon Empress grabbed Heaven’s Gravestone with one of her palms that were covered in ice crystals while the other slammed against Yang Ye’s chest.

Bang!

A wave of terrifying coldness instantly swept through the surroundings while Yang Ye’s figure and Heaven’s Gravestone were sealed in ice. However, it only took an instant for a strand of sword intent to surge out from within the ice.

Bang!

The ice shattered, but Yang Ye’s figure was blasted away, and he flew over 3km before finally managing to stop himself!

Yang Ye looked down at his chest. At this moment, the skin there had actually cracked apart while the blood red glow Heaven’s Gravestone emanated had dimmed down tremendously.

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment before he looked up at the Demon Empress. At this moment, there was a blood hole in her chest and blood was surging out incessantly from it. That injury had been created by Rebirth Rank sword intent, so even the Demon Empress couldn’t repair it in a short while!

“I never expected that even that wouldn’t be able to kill you!” The Demon Empress stared fixedly at Yang Ye. That attack could be considered her final attack. She’d suffered a heavy injury in order to take Yang Ye’s life, but the results disappointed her. Yang Ye’s body had forcefully endured her attack.

“I’ve been absolutely careful, but I never expected that you would still be able to almost turn the situation around!” Yang Ye walked towards her with Heaven’s Gravestone in hand, “Come, let me see what other trump cards you have.”

The Demon Empress looked at the ground below. At this moment, the frenzied attacks of the demon army were ceaselessly pushing the human army back, and it was obvious that the battle would end soon.

The Demon Empress took a deep breath when she thought about that, and then she gazed at Yang Ye with eyes that were filled with madness, “Yang Ye! No one will be able to save the human race today!”

As soon as she finished speaking, a terrifying aura surged out madly from within her, and the space around her instantly started to ripple.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. His profound energy surged while sword intent swept out from him, and he was about to attack.

However, his expression suddenly changed drastically. A moment later, he stomped his right foot down, and then space below him shook violently as he relied on the counterforce to push himself around 3km back!

Meanwhile, Mo Xiaoleng’s horrified voice resounded from below, “Demon Empress! Watch out!”

The Demon Empress was slightly stunned, and then her pupils constricted to the size of needles.

Hiss!

Suddenly, a hand pierced through the Demon Empress’ stomach, and her eyes instantly opened wide.
