Chapter 2448 – Deserves Death!

The desolate race is heartless, so assist me! World!

Once she spoke these words, the world instantly changed. The spirit energy around the experts of the desolate race instantly vanished without a trace. Besides that, countless forms of energy throughout the world started to converge here. There was the energy of the five elements, space, earth, lightning… In short, at this moment, all energy that naturally occurred in the world had appeared here.

Pressure!

Pressure that could crush the world suddenly appeared here, and it pressed down upon the experts of the desolate race!

Natural pressure!

The world and everything in it took Eternal Kingdom’s side!

Even people!

As soon as she spoke those words, everything in the world seemed to be summoned by her. Thus, countless natural divine treasures surged madly in Eternal Kingdom’s direction. Besides that, many experts who’d remained hidden in Eternal Kingdom had stepped forward. Most of them were experts who owed her a favor.

As for those worlds that had remained neutral until now, they made their stands clear once she made that summon.

All of them took Eternal Kingdom’s side!

Including Eternal Border which had remained neutral until now. Even Hell World, the Northern Desolate World…

All of them took Eternal Kingdom’s side!

Just a single command had changed the entire situation of the war!

At this moment, everything had taken Eternal Kingdom’s side.

The most terrifying part was that the desolate beasts and countless mysterious living beings that were on the desolate race’s side had actually stopped and gazed at the woman!

None of them dared to fight!

It was awe that came naturally!

The situation instantly changed!

The red haired man in front of the woman glanced at the surroundings, and the ferocity on his face grew even greater when he noticed the situation that the desolate race was in. He suddenly looked up at her, and then he transformed into a ray of red light that charged at the woman!

“How dare you!” Suddenly, countless furious shouts resounded from within Eternal Kingdom, and then numerous terrifying auras shot up into the air and charged at him.

“Fuck off!” The man howled with fury and swung his palm like a saber!

Hiss!

A ray of blood red saber energy that was around 3km long slashed down. It simply seemed like it was going to slash the world apart! Meanwhile, countless experts that charged out from Eternal Kingdom were forcefully slammed down by the powerful pressure the saber energy emanated!

The woman gazed at the saber energy with indifference. When it arrived a few meters above her, a ray of golden light slammed against it.

Bang!

The blood red saber energy exploded apart and transformed into energy that rained down from above.

The golden light dispersed before her and became a golden dragon!

A Primal True Dragon!

Erya, Snowy, and the Primal True Dragon had suddenly appeared by Yang Ye’s side. The Primal True Dragon gazed at the dragon in the screen of water, and its eyes had a trace of bewilderment in them.

Snowy, on the other hand, was looking at the woman in a white dress. Her paws were clenched tight, and no one knew what she was thinking.

Meanwhile, the red haired man in the screen of light had quite a gloomy expression on his face when he saw the Primal True Dragon, “Are the True Dragons planning to interfere in my desolate race’s business too?”

The Primal True Dragon looked down at him, “We owe the Sprite Progenitor a favor, and it’s time to repay it.”

The red haired man spoke ferociously, “According to my knowledge, there aren’t many Primal True Dragons left. Aren’t you afraid of going extinct?”

The Primal True Dragon spoke with disdain, “Try it if you can!”

A wisp of ferocity curled up onto the man’s lips, and then he transformed into a blood red ray of light that shot up into the sky.

Meanwhile, the Primal True Dragon fearlessly dived down and slammed itself at the man.

Meanwhile, a few dozen figures shot down into Eternal Kingdom like a sword, and they left corpses in their wake!

They were unstoppable!

They were the Desolate Deathguard!

The woman glanced down at the Desolate Deathguards, fell silent for a moment, and then suddenly looked toward the right, “Please help!”

“As you wish!” As soon as these words were spoken, a ray of sword energy shot down from far away in the sky, and then a middle aged man with a sword chest on his back appeared before the Desolate Deathguards. Besides that, there were a few dozen sword cultivators behind him!

In reality, Sword Scroll suddenly appeared by Yang Ye’s side.

She had quite a complicated gaze as she looked at the sword cultivators on the screen.

Yang Ye glanced at her and remained silent.

“The Ancient Sword Sect!” Huang Ying spoke softly by Yang Ye’s side, “A mysterious sect of sword cultivators. They can be considered as the representatives of sword cultivators in Eternal Kingdom. They always remained aloof from the world, and their disciples were usually just traveling the world. But along with the Sprite Progenitor’s request for help, 90% of their sect came to her aid. If it wasn’t for them, my desolate race’s Deathguards would have fought their way to the Eternal Divine Palace of Eternal Kingdom.”

Yang Ye looked up, and he saw the Deathguards were being forcefully stopped there!

However, the Deathguards were suppressing those sword cultivators in battle!

The sword cultivators’ ability in single combat was beyond doubt, but these Deathguards were even more terrifying! Every one of them was fearless of death, and their insane attacks started to push the sword cultivators back.

The woman frowned slightly.

Suddenly, the middle aged man below soared up into the air and formed a seal. In an instant, a hall made of swords appeared behind him!

A Sword Hall!

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he gazed at Sword Scroll. She was looking indifferently at the screen of water!

Once the sword hall appeared, a thick book floated above it.

The Sword Book!

The middle aged man formed another seal, and the sword hall behind him suddenly shook, and then countless rays of light surged out from it.

A dense expanse of sword energy!

Once the sword energy appeared, the sword cultivators below retreated.

The Deathguards didn’t try to dodge when facing the sword energy because they had nowhere to escape!

They could only clash head-on against it!

Rumble!

Explosions resounded incessantly, and the Deathguards joined forces to forcefully stop all the sword energy. However, they were being pushed back repeatedly. Moreover, sword energy was still surging out incessantly from the sword hall.

It was truly endless!

The Deathguards were constantly being pushed back. Moreover, some of them died from a ray of sword energy through the heart! Besides that, the other experts of the desolate race were forcefully pushed back by these rays of sword energy too.

The experts and sprites throughout the universe rushed to Eternal Border. Not only were there humans among them, there were even Primal Divine Beasts.

The desolate race was strong, but it couldn’t resist the joint forces of the entire universe!

So, they were pushed back repeatedly, all the way out of Eternal Kingdom to Eternal Border!

The desolate race’s loss was only a matter of time!

Because many, many more experts were rushing in their direction.

The experts of Eternal Kingdom and the entire universe were exceptionally united!

Countless had even started to cheer!

However, along with an explosion, the dreams everyone had were obliterated!

in the sky above Eternal Border, space shook violently, and then a corpse appeared.

The corpse of an old man!

The old man’s corpse descended slowly, and everyone was stunned by the sight of it.

The Eternal Lord!

The old man was the master of Eternal Kingdom!

He was dead?

A middle aged man with hair that hung loosely to his shoulder appeared there.

The Desolate Emperor!

The strongest expert of the Desolate World!

In the real world, everyone gazed at the Desolate Emperor. He was the man who’d almost destroyed Eternal Kingdom all those years ago!

A thought suddenly arose in Yang Ye’s mind. If the Desolate Emperor is compared to Wu Ni, Martial Ancestor, the mysterious sword cultivator below the Northern Sword Sect, the old man with the bamboo chest, the Unfettered one, and Tian Xiu, who would be stronger?

All of them were peak experts!

Yang Ye shook his head and chuckled. Why do I even waste time thinking of such meaningless things? My own strength is the right way!

Yang Ye continued watching the scene on the screen of water. Along with the arrival of the Desolate Emperor, the world fell silent.

Completely silent!

Everyone gazed at him!

Countless people of the desolate race were overjoyed and cheered, “Patriarch! Patriarch!”

Their voices shot into the clouds!

The atmosphere on Eternal Kingdom’s side was very oppressive.

The Eternal Lord was invincible in their hearts, yet now, he was dead!

The Desolate Emperor had killed him!

So, how strong was the Desolate Emperor?

The Desolate Emperor glanced at the woman, “Why have you interfered?”

Why?

The Sprite Progenitor remained aloof from the world. Regardless of whether the desolate race or any other force entered this place, they would not target the Sprite Progenitor. Because they knew how special she was. Moreover, all powers needed her help, including the desolate race!

She replied indifferently, “The desolate race is heartless and deserves death!”

The Desolate Emperor frowned slightly and looked down. It didn’t take long for his face to turn gloomy.

He saw the corpses of countless sprites!

The Desolate Emperor closed his eyes slowly. A long time passed before the scenes from two hours ago appeared within his mind!

A short while later, he gazed at the red haired man, “Did I not say that sprites which do not go against my desolate race should not be harmed?”

The man spoke in a low voice, “I got mad with the desire to slaughter!”

The Desolate Emperor’s eyes narrowed, “You deserve death!”FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The red haired man’s expression changed. He was about to speak but the Desolate Emperor ignored him and looked at the middle aged sword cultivator, “Did you have fun killing the people of my desolate race?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he raised his right hand and flicked his palm at the middle aged man.

A ray of sword energy shot up into the air!

The middle aged sword cultivator had counterattacked!

However, that casual attack from the Desolate Emperor instantly suppressed the middle aged man, and as soon as he descended to the ground, his body exploded apart and so did the sword hall behind him!
