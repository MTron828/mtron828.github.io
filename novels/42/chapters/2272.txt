Chapter 2273 – The Heart of Slaughter!

The Progenitor Realm!

At this moment, Yang Ye’s aura was riding steadily, and his aura wasn’t that of a Sage anymore. It was the aura of a progenitor!

The Dao!

Yang Ye had determined his path. What path? A path of slaughter!

The countless vengeful spirits hadn’t been able to crush Yang Ye. Their experiences hadn’t just been incapable of causing pain to him, they had helped him steel his Dao Heart.

Unexpectedly, it wasn’t his heart toward the Sword Dao, it was his heart of the Slaughter Dao!

The Slaughter Dao!

Yang Ye had his own views of this world, and he was even more certain of his thoughts—the weak are lowly like dogs during chaotic times!

The way he chose to resolve all of it is to kill, kill until the end!

He had been at the peak of the Sage Realm, and this clarity of thought allowed his Dao to grow!

Once Yang Ye attained the Progenitor Realm, those vengeful spirits suddenly converged on him, and then they surged into his palm.

“Impossible!” Ghost Asura frowned slightly and bewilderment filled her eyes. But it didn’t take long for her to think of something, and then she gazed at Yang Ye again, “A host! They actually chose you as their host! How inconceivable!”

Their host!

Yang Ye looked down at his palm. A black vortex had formed there, and it was filled with resentment! There were countless vengeful spirits in there. However, they were unlike the vengeful spirits he’d encountered in the past, they weren’t on the same level!

If Yang Ye wasn’t a ruthless person who had attained the Progenitor Realm in slaughter intent, he would have gone mad as soon as they got close to him. The impact from the vengeful spirits wasn’t something that just any ordinary person could endure. But it just so happened that Yang Ye was no ordinary person.

How could someone who attained the Dao through slaughter fear these vengeful spirits?

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Ye gazed at Ghost Asura, “What are all of them doing here?”

She glanced at Yang Ye, “Don’t get happy just yet. They aren’t ordinary vengeful spirits. Since they have chosen you, they can help you rise, yet they can only take you down.”

Yang Ye glanced at his palm. Suddenly, the black vortex started to spin, and then his eyes gradually turned red. Moreover, a huge amount of black energy suddenly appeared around him. They ceaselessly coiled around him.

They were affecting his mind!

Yang Ye was shocked. Because he felt like his desire to kill had risen to a terrifying level!

Kill!

His entire mind was filled with the desire to kill!

Yang Ye hurriedly withdrew the Sword Supreme, and he instantly felt better! However, he just felt slightly better, and his mind was still filled with the desire to kill.

He really wanted to kill!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly. The voices of countless were screaming at him to kill, and it made him feel like his head was about to explode!

A short while passed before he raised his right hand and flipped it. A golden pagoda appeared there, and it just happened to be right above the black vortex.

Bang!

A wave of invisible energy rippled out, and the space here shook violently.

The Primordial Pagoda was suppressing it!

Yang Ye instantly felt much better after relying on the Primordial Pagoda to suppress it, and the chaotic voices in his mind gradually vanished. At this moment, Yang Ye felt quite a bit of lingering fear because those vengeful spirits actually wanted to use him!

“That’s the Primordial Pagoda!” Suddenly, Bai Zhixian walked over to Yang Ye and gazed at the pagoda on Yang Ye’s palm, “As expected of a divine treasure. It’s extraordinary indeed.” The greed in her eyes wasn’t disguised at all!

As soon as she finished speaking, she grabbed at it!

A sword howl resounded abruptly, and then a ray of sword energy slammed against her palm. However, Bai Zhixian just grabbed lightly, and just that motion alone made the sword energy vanish in an instant! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

After that, she pushed her right hand forward slightly.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted over 3km away!

Yang Ye stropped himself and looked down, and he saw a dark red palm print on his chest!

“The Progenitor Realm?” Bai Zhixian shook her head and walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, “How ignorant! The Progenitor Realm and Sage Realm don’t make a difference to me! You…”

Bai Zhixian suddenly frowned because a sword had arrived above her.

It wasn’t an ordinary attack!

The Sword Domain!

Yang Ye had activated the Sword Domain once more. At this moment, his attack could be described as being many times stronger than before!

As soon as it descended, a rare solemn expression appeared in her eyes, and she raised her palm and slapped it upward!

Bang!

A rumbling explosion resounded, and then Bai Zhixian was blasted over 10km away. As soon as she stopped herself, she looked up and noticed that Yang Ye was gone.

A ray of light flashed through the distant sky!

Yang Ye had fled!

Bai Zhixian’s eyes narrowed slightly, and a cold glow flashed within them, “Running away? You’re dreaming!”

Her figure vanished on the spot.

Only Ghost Asura remained here.

Ghost Asura shot a glance up into the sky and frowned. No one knew what she was thinking.

…

Far away in the sky, a ray of light shot through the clouds. Right when it was about to vanish at the ends of the sky, a palm appeared before it, and then a wave of powerful pressure blasted the light into bits!

The light dispersed to reveal a man.

It was Yang Ye!

A moment later, a woman appeared before him, Bai Zhixian!

Yang Ye frowned when he saw her.

Bai Zhixian didn’t waste her breath and just slapped her palm at him. The space around Yang Ye instantly warped, and then it transformed into a death area.

It was the special ability of True Dao Realm experts!

Normally, True Dao Realm experts were practically guaranteed to be able to suppress Progenitor Realm experts with this move. Unfortunately, it was useless against Yang Ye. As soon as she did that, Yang Ye had activated the Sword Domain!

Yang Ye used the Sword Domain to break free of that space, and then a sword suddenly appeared above Bai Zhixian and slashed down.

Bai Zhixian’s eyes narrowed slightly, and a wisp of surprise flashed through them. She hadn’t expected that Yang Ye would actually be able to overcome that move with such ease. Of course, she was even more surprised that Yang Ye’s attainments in the Sword Domain had actually arrived at such a level!

She didn’t give it further thought because Yang Ye’s sword was before her.

Bai Zhitian tapped the tip of her right foot down. In an instant, a huge white dragon shot up into the air from beneath her feet.

Bang!

Yang Ye was suddenly blasted 3km away. As soon as he stopped himself, a hand pressed against his stomach.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted away again, and he spat out a few mouthfuls of blood in succession!

Hiss!

Afterimages flashed through the area, and then a long black hole was sliced upon in front of Yang Ye. However, those afterimages hadn’t even gotten close to Yang Ye when he suddenly raised his sword and swung it!

Bang!

It seemed like the sky was sliced open before his sword, and the afterimages were sliced into two.

However, a leg suddenly slammed against Yang Ye’s back!

A mouthful of blood sprayed from Yang Ye as his figure was kicked away.

Where Yang Ye had been standing just a moment ago, Bai Zhixian had suddenly appeared there. She was just about to attack again when Yang Ye stopped abruptly, and then a ray of sword energy slashed at her.

It was extremely swift and instantly arrived before her!

Ridicule arose on the corners of her mouth as she gazed at the sword energy, but it didn’t take long for the ridicule on her mouth to stiffen.

The Sword Domain!

Yang Ye had activated the Sword Domain again!

The might of it shook the world!

A wisp of solemness flashed through her eyes as she waved her right hand lightly. In an instant, the space above her rippled like water, and then waves of terrifying energy rippled forward!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s attack arrived!

Hiss!

It instantly sliced through the space above her, but it didn’t take long for it to stop. It was because a strand of mysterious energy had frozen it on the spot.

It had been stopped!

However, just a moment later, Yang Ye’s sword trembled, and then it sliced through the energy and descended.

Bang!

A white shadow was blasted far away!

It was Bai Zhixian’s figure!

After he pushed her back, Yang Ye didn’t attack again. He just flashed and vanished into the sky!

He didn’t choose to continue fighting!

While he wanted to kill her, these few collisions had allowed him to realize that his current strength wasn’t sufficient to kill her at all. Or to be more precise, he was no match for her. Even though he was at the Progenitor Realm, his strength was still quite inferior when compared to her!

Her strength could be described as being above Xiao Lou. Moreover, he’d just attained the Progenitor Realm, so his cultivation hadn’t stabilized, nor had he gotten accustomed to his new realm of cultivation. So, his control in all aspects was extremely bad, and he wasn’t able to fully display his strength as a Progenitor Realm expert!

Thus, he chose to retreat for now. However, Bai Zhixian didn’t want to let him go. As soon as he retreated, she caught up to him!

He couldn’t retreat at all!

At this moment, Bai Zhixian was furious. As far as she was concerned, this was a humiliation! Because she’d almost been injured by a cultivator who’d just attained the Progenitor Realm!

It was an absolute humiliation!

At this moment, only the desire to kill remained in her. As for those three divine treasures, they had been tossed to the back of her mind.

Yang Ye stopped fleeing. He just stopped on the spot and turned around to gaze at Bai Zhixian who’d appeared behind him, “There’s no enmity between us, so why push me into a corner like this?”

She glanced coldly at him, “There is no enmity between us. However, I want you dead, so you must die!”
