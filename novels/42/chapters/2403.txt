Chapter 2404 – Passionate Fight!

Fight!

As soon as he answered her, Snowy hurriedly left the Ascension Platform!

Her eyes were filled with excitement.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing were going to fight!

She really looked forward to it!

As far as Snowy was concerned, both Yang Ye and An Nanjing were extremely powerful! So, a fight between them would definitely be really fun!

As for danger, she didn’t worry about that at all. Because she knew that Yang Ye wouldn’t harm An Nanjing, and An Nanjing wouldn’t harm Yang Ye either!

Only Yang Ye and An Nanjing remained on the Ascension Platform!

They exchanged glances, and then An Nanjing lightly twisted the tip of her foot against the ground.

Hiss!

A ray of black light flashed above the Ascension Platform!

A fist shot straight at Yang Ye’s face!

It was a simple punch, just a very simple punch, but it was exactly such a simple punch that made Yang Ye react like he was facing a formidable enemy!

Yang Ye didn’t use his sword and swung a punch as well!

His punch tore through everything before him!

Bang!

As soon as they came into contact, Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically, and then he was pushed backward repeatedly. Right when he was about to be pushed out of the Ascension Platform, Yang Ye stopped. However, An Nanjing appeared in front of him at the same time!

An Nanjing slammed a kick at Yang Ye from midair!

The imposing aura it carried seemed like it could shatter the earth!

Imposing aura!

The imposing aura it carried was so strong that it shocked Yang Ye. He didn’t dare act carelessly and drew his sword!

A sword howl resounded, and a sword pressed against the bottom of An Nanjing’s foot. It had forcefully stopped her imposing aura!

An Nanjing twisted her right leg lightly.

Bang!

The entire Ascension Platform below Yang Ye shook violently while a strand of powerful energy rippled out above it. Along with the ripple of energy, the space here shook violently and seemed like it would explode apart at any moment!

Yang Ye’s sword started to bend!

The powerful force contained within An Nanjing’s right foot was even almost beyond the limits of the Sword Precursor which was a Divine Treasure now!

Suddenly, the Sword Gourd on Yang Ye’s waist shook violently, and then a ray of light flashed!

Right when it flashed, An Nanjing appeared around 10m away from Yang Ye.

The sword missed!

That attack which was capable of instantly killing a Two World Realm expert had missed just like that!

She glanced at the Sword Gourd and said, “Not bad!”

She tapped the tip of her right foot down once she finished speaking.

Hiss!

An Nanjing instantly appeared before Yang Ye. At the same time, she raised her leg and swung it at Yang Ye’s chest.

It was fast, precise, and ruthless!

She hadn’t hesitated at all!

That was what Yang Ye felt from her. Her attacks and moves were very simple, and they were devoid of any hesitation. That was the most terrifying form of attack!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He took a small step back with his right foot, and then he swung his sword.

Hiss!

Space was instantly sliced apart in its wake!

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then both of them separated.

Boom!

The entire Ascension Platform shook violently.

On the platform, Yang Ye and An Nanjing exchanged glances, and then she suddenly made a grabbing motion.

Hiss!

She’d grabbed Yang Ye’s sword in her grasp.

A flying sword!

At that instant earlier, Yang Ye had launched another fling sword, but she’d been able to stop it with ease!

She was strong!

The sword in her grasp trembled violently!

Suddenly, An Nanjing’s hand slid down and grabbed the sword’s hilt, and then she hurled it at Yang Ye.

Hiss!

A ray of light stabbed straight at Yang Ye!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He stretched out his right hand and grabbed, immediately grabbing the sword in his grasp. However, An Nanjing suddenly appeared before him, and then a fist slammed at his head.

An Nanjing’s fist!

A sword stopped An Nanjing’s fist when it was just a few inches away from Yang Ye’s head!

An Nanjing’s strength was formidable, but Yang Ye’s wasn’t weak either!

A sword and a fist!

A moment of silence ensued, and then she suddenly closed her eyes. A moment later, she twisted her right hand.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted away, all the way out of the platform. However, it only took a moment for a sword to descend from above An Nanjing.

Three overlapped swings with the Sword Domain!

Bang!

As soon as they descended, An Nanjing was instantly blasted away!

Outside the Ascension Platform, An Nanjing glanced at her fist, and there was a blood red injury there.

She glanced at Yang Ye and said, “That attack wasn’t bad. Come, try mine!”

As soon as she finished speaking, a spear appeared in her grasp. It was one of the two spears Snowy had given her.

An Nanjing held it tight, and then she tapped her right foot down.

The tip of a spear instantly appeared before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s reaction was extremely fast, and his sword slashed down at the instant she attacked.

Clang!

An ear piercing and sharp sound of collision resounded, and then they split apart.

Outside the platform, Yang Ye and An Nanjing exchanged glances and didn’t attack again. Because if they did, it would be a battle of life and death!

Both of them would never choose to fight each other to the death!

She glanced at Yang Ye, “You’ve grown strong!”

Yang Ye smiled, “You too!”

An Nanjing nodded slightly, and then she gazed at Snowy. The latter cracked a smile and waved her paw lightly. Spirit energy instantly surged into An Nanjing.

An Nanjing grinned, and then she walked over to Snowy and rubbed the little fellow’s head. After that, she gazed at Yang Ye, “Let’s go outside!”

Yang Ye nodded and left the Primordial Pagoda with An Nanjing and Snowy!

Wu Ni was looking at the GO board in deep thought.

An Nanjing walked over to him and bowed slightly. Wu Ni spoke softly, “You’re leaving?”

An Nanjing nodded.

Wu Ni put down the Go piece in his grasp and said, “What do you think about your trip to the Hell World?”

She fell silent for a long time and said, “Brutal, strong!”

Wu Ni grinned, “Brutal! Little girl, that isn’t the most brutal place yet, and it isn’t the strongest either.”

She gazed at Wu Ni and waited for him to continue!

Wu Ni smiled, “I’ve gone further than you, and I’ve seen more people and experienced more things. What you think is brutal and strong now isn’t truly brutal or strong. The path of cultivation is without end.”

She nodded slightly, “I know!”

Wu Ni smiled, “That Martial Qilin is yours. You’ll be able to truly bring forth the might of those moves with its help.”

An Nanjing bowed slightly to Wu Ni and gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at Wu Ni, “Farewell!”

Wu Ni nodded, “Go on!”

Yang Ye took An Nanjing’s hand, and then he transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

Once they left, an old man appeared out of thin air before Wu Ni.

It was Martial Ancestor!

Martial Ancestor glanced at the sky, “You’re not going with them?”

Wu Ni shook his head, “The truly strong don’t get there by being protected!”

Martial Ancestor said, “She has great potential. I hope she will be able to create her own path in the Martial Dao and not take our path. After all, the facts prove that we were wrong!”

“Of course!” Wu Ni looked up at the sky, “The thing I admire the most about her is that she persists on her own Martial Dao, and she merely learns from ours. That’s the most precious part. She will go further than both of us!”

Martial Ancestor nodded, and then he seemed to have thought of something and asked, “What about that kid?”

Wu Ni fell silent.

Martial Ancestor smiled, “What is it?”

Wu Ni shook his head slightly, “That kid… has balls. He’s a true man, and I like him. However, he’s too headstrong. He would rather break than bend, so he may go all the way, or he may die soon! Who knows?”

Martial Ancestor smiled, “You like him! That’s rare!”

Wu Ni glanced into the sky, and a vicious glow gradually appeared in his eyes, “I wasn’t able to overcome you all those years ago. That’s fine, my disciple definitely will! I can’t rest in peace until you die!”

As soon as he finished speaking, both Wu Ni and Martial Ancestor’s figures gradually turned ethereal.

It didn’t take long for just a GO board to remain on the cliff.

…

Divine Martial City. Cloud Residence.

As soon as they arrived there, the woman, A’Leng, walked out of the bamboo house.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

A’Leng glanced at Yang Ye, and then her gaze descended onto An Nanjing. She sized up An Nanjing for a moment, and then she nodded slightly, “The Martial God Physique! Amazing!”

An Nanjing glanced at A’Leng and nodded slightly, “It’s just ordinary!”

A'Leng grinned and gazed at Yang Ye. She smiled, “Young Master Yang, I’ll be troubling you again!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course!”

She smiled and sat down at the side. Yang Ye sat in front of her, and then she stretched out her hand. Yang Ye’s hand hovered above hers as his Primordial Violet Energy surged incessantly into her.

A’Leng gradually closed her eyes, and her pale countenance slowly turned rosier and rosier.

Primordial Violet Energy!

A’Leng spoke softly, “As expected of an energy renowned for healing! My trip here was worth it!”

Yang Ye glanced at her and remained silent!

A long time passed before Yang Ye withdrew his hand. However, she suddenly grabbed his hand and grinned at Yang Ye, “Young Master Yang, are you willing to sell it?”

Sell it?

Yang Ye shook his head, “No!”

She grinned, “But I really like it. If you’re willing to sell it to me, feel free to ask for Divine Treasures or anything else!”

Yang Ye shook his head again, “It’s not for sale!”

A'Leng’s eyes narrowed slightly.

In an instant, the atmosphere here became tense.
