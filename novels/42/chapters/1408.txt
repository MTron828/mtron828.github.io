Chapter 1409 – Fight To The Bitter End!

Yang Ye was extremely swift and instantly arrived in the air above the Demon Lord. The Sword God’s Seal lit up on his forehead, and his sword intent’s strength instantly multiplied. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Meanwhile, Yang Ye drew his sword and swung it!

The true form of Heavenrend!

It was even enhanced by Quasi Returnal Rank slaughter intent and Rebirth Rank sword intent!

Bang!

As soon as his sword was drawn, the space around it seemed to be unable to endure the energy within the sword and collapsed in an instant.

Meanwhile, the Demon Lord’s pupils constricted. Yang Ye’s sword technique had already been formidable, and now it was even enhanced further by 2 types of intents. Especially Yang Ye’s slaughter intent, it was at the Quasi Returnal Rank, and that was something which even he didn’t dare underestimate. Yet now, there wasn’t just Quasi Returnal Rank slaughter intent in the attack, it even carried Rebirth Rank sword intent!

The Demon Lord didn’t dare to act carelessly at all, and he immediately slapped his palms forward.

Bang!

A huge black ball of energy appeared before him, and then it emanated dazzling black light that instantly slammed against Yang Ye’s sword energy.

Bang!

As soon as they came into contact, the space throughout the area collapsed in an instant. The black light and huge black ball of energy had shattered along with the space there, but Yang Ye’s sword energy hadn’t shattered. It had merely dimed down slightly, and it hadn’t even slowed down as it slammed down towards the Demon Lord!

Bang!

Another explosion resounded through the sky, and then the Demon Lord was blasted over 6km away.

Yang Ye was just about to follow up with another attack when a huge black palm emerged from the space in front of him, and then it slammed down towards him.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He shook his left hand slightly and the Sword Precursor within the ancient sheath was exchanged for Heaven’s Gravestone. He took Heaven Gravestone in his grasp and drew it.

A ray of blood red sword energy shot forward and instantly collided with the palm.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded as both the sword energy and palm vanished simultaneously.

Yang Ye didn’t follow up with another attack. He withdrew some divine crystals and swallowed them instead. He’d missed the best opportunity to follow up with another attack, so it was meaningless to try now. It was more beneficial to recover his profound energy.

At the same time that he was replenishing his profound energy, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. At this moment, Clouds of Heavens Stellar Region’s forces were being led by Elder Yuan’s group, and they were completely crushing the experts of Celestial Demon Stellar Region. However, the remaining Celestial Demon Wolf was quite troublesome, and it was keeping 2 of their Deities busy, Zhuang Weitian and Qian Yaochan.

Moreover, they didn’t really have the strength left to resist that Celestial Demon Wolf. Of course, the main reason was that they’d been injured by the Demon Lord during the previous battle. Even then, the Celestial Demon Wolf’s strength was beyond doubt.

As for Zhuang Weiran, there wasn’t much of a problem on her side. She was capable of dealing with a Celestial Demon Wolf on her own, but it was quite difficult for her to defeat it.

The Celestial Demon Wolf was extremely strong. It could be said that even the Celestial Demon Lord couldn’t go against both the Celestial Demon Wolves at once.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and looked at the Demon Lord. No matter what happened in the battle below, his battle with the Demon Lord would be the battle that decided the outcome of the entire war!

If he won, Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region would have won; if he lost, it would lose with him!

The Demon Lord glanced at his hands. Only half of his palms remained. Moreover, the aftershock from the sword energy had even injured him, but it wasn’t very serious.

The Demon Lord looked up at Yang Ye. At this moment, he’d truly started taking Yang Ye seriously. Earlier, even though he was slightly shocked by Yang Ye’s strength, he didn’t really take Yang Ye seriously. Because Yang Ye was just an Emperor, and he was a Deity. Would a Deity have to take an Emperor seriously?

He felt that he didn’t need to, yet now, he felt that he had to.

There were a certain type of people called monstrous geniuses. They couldn’t be judged based on their realms of cultivation. Obviously, Yang Ye was such a person.

Regardless of whether it was Yang Ye or the Demon Lord, both of them didn’t speak.

Their gazes met in midair, and then they vanished on the spot.

Bang!

As soon as their figures vanished, a loud explosion resounded in the sky, and then Yang Ye was blasted 3km away while the Demon Lord merely moved 300m back before he stopped himself. However, there was an extremely obvious hole on the Demon Lord’s chest, and blood was seeping out of it.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye looked down at his own chest. There was a black palm print there, and it was ceaselessly emanating mysterious energy that destroyed his skin. In next to no time, the skin on Yang Ye’s chest had turned dark, and it was swiftly spreading to his entire body.

Meanwhile, a wisp of ridicule arose on the corners of the Demon Lord’s mouth, “Yang Ye, that was my Celestial Demon Palm, and it was fused with the Energy of the Dead that I’ve comprehended. Even Deities will definitely die from it. Did you think I let you strike me for no reason? How laughable. But don’t worry, I’ll keep your soul intact and keep you from dying. Because I’m going to make you watch as everyone close to you is tortured before your eyes. I....”

The Demon Lord’s voice stopped abruptly because Yang Ye’s chest was healing at a visible rate. It didn’t take more than two breaths of time for Yang Ye’s chest to return to normal, and even the palm print had vanished without a trace.

The Demon Lord’s eyes were filled with disbelief, “How could that be possible?!”

Yang Ye looked at the Demon Lord and said, “That’s the Energy of the Dead which you spoke of? Isn’t it a little too lousy?”

Actually, Yang Ye still had some lingering fear in his heart. The Energy of the Dead was terrifying indeed, and it had even shocked him. Because it was too dense and pure. The Death Energy he’d encountered in the past couldn’t compare to it at all. Fortunately, even such a terrifying form of energy couldn’t resist his Primordial Violet Energy.

Or it should be said that Primordial Violet Energy was a counter for Death Energy!

Actually, his body was immune to all evil because he had Primordial Violet Energy within him. Regardless of whether it was Death Energy of poison, they were useless against him!

The Demon Lord stared fixedly at Yang Ye for a short while, and then he said, “Alright! I still underestimated you. No wonder you were able to attain such strength at such a young age! Let me see how strong you really are!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure shot up into the air, and then he waved his hands. In an instant, a terrifying aura surged out from within him like the tide. After that, he pressed his right palm forward. It didn’t take long for a black vortex of energy to appear on his palm while waves of terrifying pressure surged out incessantly from it.

A moment of silence ensued before a wisp of ferocity arose in his eyes, and then he twisted his palm and slapped it down at Yang Ye.

“Celestial Demon Palm!” Numerous black energy palms flashed out incessantly, and they slammed down towards Yang Ye in succession.

Space didn’t ripple at all as they passed through it.

Deities had transcended the five elements, so they could make their techniques transcend the five elements as well. Just like these energy palms. They were capable of disregarding all defenses.

Even if someone made space collapse or overlapped space, it still wouldn’t make a difference. Because they’d transcended the five elements and transcended space!

There was only one way for Yang Ye to destroy these energy palms, and it was by force!

Because he wasn’t a Deity, so he couldn’t transcend the five elements like the Demon Lord. He could only destroy it by force. In other words, he had to make his own strength surpass the five elements!

Yang Ye had no choice but to execute the true form of Heavenrend!

Yang Ye’s left hand shook slightly before a sword howl resounded, and then he stomped his right foot down. His figure transformed into a ray of light that shot towards the energy palm. A wisp of viciousness flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes when he arrived before the first energy palm, and then he grabbed the Sword Precursor’s hilt and drew it!

Om!

A sword howl resounded, and then the entire sky cracked apart before it.

Rumble!

When Yang Ye swung his sword, the energy palm right at the front was instantly shattered, and then the others behind it shattered as well.

Incessant rumbling resounded through the sky.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye’s figure to crash down from the sky while accompanied by a loud explosion.

Zhuang Weiran’s pupils constricted at the sight of this, and she was about to lend him a hand. However, Yang Ye suddenly stopped in midair, and then he transformed into a ray of light that shot up into the sky.

Bang!

Another loud explosion resounded in the sky.

Around two breaths of time later, Yang Ye and the Demon Lord stopped attacking.

The Demon Lord had stopped attacking because of the battle down below. The situation down there was extremely disadvantageous to Celestial Demon Stellar Region. Yang Ye’s slaughter intent had already caused almost 70% of Celestial Demon Stellar Region’s forces to perish in battle, and the remaining 30% were still killing each other like madmen.

If it wasn’t for the Celestial Demon Wolf and those Deities from Celestial Demon Stellar Region, his forces would have been wiped out by now.

The Demon Lord slowly closed his eyes. He knew that if he allowed the battle to drag on, then he would become a general without an army.

A moment of silence ensued before the Demon Lord looked up into the sky, and he spoke coldly, “If my Celestial Demon Stellar Region loses, then you’ll have to return everything you’ve obtained and everything I promised all of you. So, are you still going to watch the show?”

As soon as he finished speaking, just a few breaths of time passed before the space in the sky started to tremble.

After that, seven old men appeared in the sky.

Yang Ye’s eyes instantly narrowed slightly when he saw them. At the same time, the fierce battle on the ground below had stopped.

The expressions of everyone from Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region had become unsightly!

Because all seven of those old men were Deities!
