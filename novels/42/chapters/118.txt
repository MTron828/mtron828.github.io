Chapter 119 – A Yellow Rank Technique!

When they noticed Su Xiaoxiao’s gaze, everyone in the surroundings was first stunned, and then they shot their gazes towards Yang Ye.

They immediately came to a sudden understanding upon laying eyes on the violet mink on Yang Ye’s shoulder. At the same time, they sighed in their hearts about Yang Ye’s good luck because this was an opportunity to form a good relationship with an expert. Moreover, this expert was even a beautiful woman.

The violet mink seemed to dislike their gazes, and it scratched Yang Ye’s face with its little claws as if it was telling Yang Ye to drive all of them away.

It wasn’t just Su Xiaoxiao’s eyes that flashed with a glow of fondness upon witnessing this scene, even Qin Xiyue who stood by Yang Ye’s side was the same. This violet mink was truly too cute.

Yang Ye was slightly speechless. He really wanted to ask the little fellow to stay in his Vortex Dantian, but the little fellow seemed to have gotten bored of staying there and was utterly unwilling to go back in after coming up. Coupled with the fact that he needed to take precautions against that mysterious assassin, Yang Ye could only allow the little fellow to do as it pleased. However. Never had he imagined that this little fellow was really likable to women.

Now, it would be troublesome!

In next to no time, Su Xiaoxiao arrived before Yang Ye. She carefully sized up the violet mink before moving her gaze to Yang Ye after a short moment, and she said, “Give this pet of yours to me, alright? Of course, I’ll compensate you. How about a high-grade Yellow Rank technique?”

Even though her attitude was warm, but her voice carried an indisputable tone.

When they heard Su Xiaoxiao, the gazes of all the others in the surroundings towards Yang Ye had turned envious. Just a pet could be exchanged for a high-grade Yellow Rank technique. They felt that he’d really struck gold!

After all, a useless pet like this was only worth a few hundred gold coins in the Grand Qin Empire, so wasn’t obtaining a high-grade Yellow Rank technique for a few hundred gold coins like striking gold?

Yang Ye didn’t speak, but Qin Xiyue couldn’t help but laugh. After that, she looked at Su Xiaoxiao with a spurious smile and said, “Little Beauty, you said you want to give him a high-grade Yellow Rank in exchange for this little fellow?”

Others might not be aware of how terrifying this little fellow was, but she did. If she wasn’t wrong, then this little fellow was absolutely comparable to a Beast King. A high-grade Yellow Rank technique for a Beast King? Is there something wrong with this woman’s brains?

When they heard Qin Xiyue speak, everyone else in the surroundings finally noticed Qin Xiyue, and when they noticed Qin Xiyue’s appearance and figure, all of their eyes instantly burned with desire. No matter if it was appearance or figure, this woman was far superior to Su Xiaoxiao!

Su Xiaoxiao gazed at Qin Xiyue for a short while before a wisp of fear flashed in the depths of her eyes, and then she smiled to Qin Xiyue and said, “Big Sister, could it be that you’ve taken a liking to this little fellow as well?”

“No!” Qin Xiyue smiled and said, “I was just asking for fun. Both of you can continue!” As soon as she finished speaking, she withdrew herself and stood by Yang Ye’s side.

Su Xiaoxiao glanced deeply at Qin Xiyue, and then she looked at Yang Ye and said, “What do you think? A high-grade Yellow Rank technique for a pet is a good deal!”

Yang Ye rubbed the violet mink’s head, and then he said coldly, “Not to mention a Yellow Rank technique, I wouldn’t give make the exchange even if you gave me a Heaven Rank technique!”

If there weren’t too many people here, Yang Ye would have killed this woman on the spot. He didn’t have the slightest favorable impression of members of the Flower Palace, and so long as he had the chance, he would kill every single one he encountered!

Su Xiaoxiao’s face sank. Right when she was about to say something, the voice of a man sounded out from the side. “Xiaoxiao taking a liking to that pet of yours is your fortune. Yet you actually intend to refuse. You really don’t know what’s good for you. Now, I’ll give you a chance, leave that pet behind and sever an arm of yours. Otherwise, leave your head behind!”

Everyone looked over to the source of the voice, and they noticed the Origin School’s Gong Yuan leading the other two disciples of the Origin School as he walked over.

Su Xiaoxiao smiled to Gong Yuan that arrived before her, and she said, “So, it’s Senior Brother Gong. Xiaoxiao really missed you after we parted that day!”

Gong Yuan laughed as his gaze swept past Su Xiaoxiao’s chest, and then he said, “Gong Yuan really missed you as well!

They’re having an affair! This was what everyone in the surroundings thought at this moment. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Xiaoxiao, you’ve taken a liking to this violet mink?” Gong Yuan smiled as he said, “Don’t worry, Senior Brother will help you get it.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Gong Yuan turned around to look at Yang Ye, and when he saw Yang Ye still standing still there, his brows immediately raised as he said, “Did you not hear what I said?”

“I did!” Yang Ye nodded, and then he glanced at Su Xiaoxiao and said, “According to rumor, the Flower Palace prohibits its disciples from entering into relationships. So, why does it seem to me like the flames of passion burns between the two of you? What? Great Beauty Su, are you not worried about being punished by the rules of the Flower Palace?”

“Haha....” Qin Xiyue suddenly roared with laughter and said, “Little Brother, you’re really ignorant and ill-informed. Even though the Flower Palace prohibits its disciples from having relationships, it doesn’t restrain their lust. After all, women have to satisfy their lust as well, right!? To put it simply, the disciples of Flower Palace are prohibited from falling in love, but they can get in bed with men. Understand?”

Yang Ye came to a sudden understanding, and then he looked at Su Xiaoxiao and Gong Yuan as he said, “In other words, the two of you are like courtesan and customer?”

When they heard this, everyone in the surroundings couldn’t help but laugh, and some even turned around and started roaring with laughter.

Su Xiaoxiao’s expression turned horrifyingly gloomy while the Profound Energy in her body surged, and she seemed to intend to attack but was afraid of something.

Gong Yuan, on the other hand, wasn’t afraid of anything. His right palm opened up, and it carried a powerful gale along with it as it slapped down fiercely at Yang Ye’s head.

It was the first time he’d been insulted in public!

Killing intent flashed in Yang Ye’s eyes. Right when he was about to draw his sword, a pitch black whip tore through the air as it arrived before Yang Ye, and then it coiled towards the palm that was descending towards him.

Gong Yuan’s expression changed, and he didn’t hesitate to withdraw his palm, and then his right leg swiftly stomped on the ground to propel him back explosively. After retreating 30m away, Gong Yuan gazed at Qin Xiyue as he said in a low voice, “The King Realm! Who’re you?”

The expressions of everyone in the surroundings changed when they heard this. All of them had never imagined that this woman with a voluptuous body would actually be a King Realm expert. Moreover, those that had aroused wicked thoughts earlier were even terrified to the point they broke out in cold sweat.

Fortunately, Gong Yuan had attacked and made this woman counterattack, otherwise, they would have really gone and courted death.

A wisp of fear flashed in Su Xiaoxiao’s eyes. Even though she’d fought a King Realm expert, she’d merely fought one, and she wasn’t at the level of being able to defeat a King Realm expert while at the First Heaven Realm!

Qin Xiyue swung the whip in her hand and said with a smile, “It was you who asked my Husband to sever his own arm just now?”

Even though she was smiling, it caused others to shudder with fear.

The others in the surroundings were stunned. Husband? This beauty at the King Realm is actually the Dao Companion of this fellow at the Mortal Realm?Is this the legend of sticking a lovely flower in a heap of dung?

Gong Yuan’s eyelids twitched. He’d never expected that this King Realm Profounder and Mortal Realm Profounder before him would actually be Dao Companions. The corners of his mouth immediately twitched as he forced out a smile and said, “It was a joke!”

“A joke?” Qin Xiyue smiled and said, “Then I’ll make a joke as well. You sever your arm as well, and then I’ll let you off. Alright?”

“Haha....” Right at this moment, roaring laughter sounded out from afar. Everyone looked over to the source of the laughter. They saw a man traveling over swiftly, and he arrived here in less than a few breaths of time.

A King Realm expert! A wisp of fear arose in the faces of everyone in the surroundings.

Gong Yuan revealed a delighted expression when he saw this man, and he cupped his fists to the man and said, “Senior Brother Xu Yan!”

The man called Xu Yan nodded, and then he looked at Qin Xiyue and said, “You want a disciple of my Origin School to sever his own arm? What high sounding sentiments!”

Qin Xiyue smiled and was just about to speak when Yang Ye pulled her hand from the side and shook his head at her. He had no intention of contracting enmity with the members of the Origin School because his target was only those female disciples of the Flower Palace. Moreover, he was unable to kill that woman here. Since it was like that, it was better to drop the matter and wait for an opportunity to arise.

Qin Xiyue nodded slightly, and then withdrew herself to stand by Yang Ye’s side. She seemed meek and obedient, and it caused the others in the surroundings to feel extremely envious.

The man called Xu Yan glanced deeply at Yang Ye and Qin Xiyue, and then he led the others from the Origin School to the side. He was slightly fearful of this pair of man and woman as well. Because the man and woman were clearly aware that they were from the Origin School, yet this pair still dared to speak in that way. So, they were either idiots or had trump cards that allowed them to be arrogant. It was very obvious that the woman before him was no idiot, so she was naturally the latter.

Even though he wasn’t afraid, he didn’t want to go looking for trouble for no reason. After all, the Tomb of Emperor Zhou was their true objective!

Su Xiaoxiao glanced at Yang Ye while a wisp of a cold glow flashed in her eyes, but this cold glow was very well concealed.

It was the first time she’d been humiliated in public. Of course, she wouldn’t make a move against them now. However, once her Senior Sister arrived, then she would definitely vent her anger!
