Chapter 2445 – I’m Afraid That I’ll Kill You!

Everyone here was stunned.

What’s going on?

What the heck is the desolate race up to?

Yang Ye and the others gazed at Sky Lord, and the latter smiled, “It was a test, a test of character.”

Huang Ying frowned slightly, “Character?”

Sky Lord smiled, “Strength isn’t the only requirement to be our Crown Prince, it requires character. It sounds quite laughable, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Indeed!”

Sky Lord roared with laughter and said, “Authority! The Crown Prince of my desolate race has great authority, but it’s authority the desolate race has given the Crown Prince to serve us all and not for the Crown Prince’s own desires. The other old geezers and I wanted to see how he would choose between his friends and the position of Crown Prince.”

Yang Ye asked, “What if he chose position?”

Sky Lord smiled, “Both of you would have died. This is no joke.”

Yang Ye frowned slightly.

The Sky Lord said, “Of course, Huang Ying would die too. There is competition in our desolate race, but it doesn’t represent that we are ruthless. A ruthless person is only suited to be a general and not the future king of our race! Besides that, if he’s someone who even betrays his friends, who knows if he will also do the same to his own race in the future? Right?”

Loyalty!

Yang Ye glanced at Sky Lord and remained silent. The desolate race wasn’t really like what he’d expected!

Sky Lord gazed at Huang Ying, “Of course, the patriarch will decide if you do become the Crown Prince in the end. After all, there’s another fellow with strength and natural talent that surpasses you!”

Huang Ying asked, “The two of them?” He was speaking about Huang Tianxing and Huang Ye.

Sky Lord shook his head, “No, it’s another one who has been concealing everything well. If it wasn’t for the patriarch, even I would have been deceived by him! You’ll find out soon enough. Let’s go!”

Sky Lord turned around and left once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye and the others exchanged glances, and Huang Ying smiled, “Let me take you around Desolate City!”

He roared with laughter and strode swiftly toward the city.

A’Leng spoke abruptly, “The desolate race is extraordinary!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Miss A’Leng, you’re from Eternal Kingdom. So what do you think of them in comparison to Eternal Kingdom?”

A'Leng replied softly, “Eternal Kingdom isn’t the same as it was. They started preparing for war countless years ago.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “They’ve been constantly doing that?”

A'Leng nodded, “The desolate race retreated all those years ago, and Eternal Kingdom knew that the desolate race would return, sooner or later. So, from then on, Eternal Kingdom started to prepare for war. There is a place in the Eternal Kingdom called the Eternal Warzone. Even year, so long as the geniuses of Eternal Kingdom meet the requirements, they would be sent there. They have endless resources and the personal tutoring of the best experts from Eternal Kingdom in there! If something unexpected hadn’t occurred, I too would have gone there!”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “It would be a fierce battle if they do fight, right?”

A'Leng replied, “A disaster for the entire universe!”

A disaster for the entire universe!

At this moment, they seemed to be able to see the universe in pieces and countless living beings dying miserably.

It didn’t take long for them to follow Huang Ying into Desolate City.

Desolate City floated in midair. It wasn’t very huge, or it should be described as ordinary. It was a very ordinary city.

Huang Ying suddenly smiled, “My ancestor once said that if the desolate race isn’t strong, then even a city made of a Super Divine Treasure would be useless, but if my desolate race is strong enough, then even if it’s a city made of wood, would anyone dare to attack it?”

The Desolate Emperor!

Yang Ye and A’Leng exchanged glances. Needless to say, there was a reason why the desolate race was so strong.

They soared up into the sky and entered the city.

Ordinary!

It was a very ordinary city that was no different from any other city. There were ordinary people and cultivators in the city, and their strengths varied. The only difference was that the atmosphere in this city was unlike any other city! The atmosphere here was lively and lacked viciousness!

That was what Yang Ye sensed!

As they walked through the streets, some nodded at Huang Ying from time to time, and Huang Ying would respond in the same manner.

While these people would size up Yang Ye and A’Leng, they revealed no hostility and only curiosity!

Huang Ying spoke softly as they traveled, “Everything is equal in my desolate race!”

Yang Ye gazed at him, “Everything is equal?”

Huang Ying explained softly, “The patriarch once said that using strength to bully the weak is something only weaklings do. Because a truly strong person would not bully the weak, they would only seek out those who are stronger than themselves. Only weaklings would bully the weak to seek satisfaction. There was once a young master who used his father’s influence as an elder to do as he pleased in the city, and he even killed someone. Do you know what happened to him?”

Yang Ye and A’Leng gazed at Huang Ying while waiting for him to continue.

Huang Ying smiled, “At that time, our patriarch was in closed door cultivation, and the Crown Prince managing our desolate race wanted to get that young master’s father over to his side, thus he chose to close one eye to the matter. In the end, that young master grew even more proud and arrogant, and he did as he pleased in the city. Finally, countless people went to where the patriarch cultivated and begged him to uphold justice. The patriarch showed himself!”

A'Leng asked, “What did he do?”

Huang Ying spoke softly, “The patriarch personally sealed the cultivations of that young master and the Crown Prince, making them ordinary people. They were sent to the city to make a living for themselves. The feeling of dropping from heaven back to hell is something that perhaps only they can understand. In the end, that young master couldn’t bear the huge change in his life and took his own life. He did it right before the city’s entrance, and our desolate race considers him a humiliation!”

Yang Ye asked, “What about the Crown Prince?”

Huang Ying smiled, “After dozens of years, the Crown Prince turned everything around. He completed his old path, or it should be said that he truly recognized his own path and Dao. So, he broke open the patriarch’s seal and became one of the supreme experts of our desolate race. Both of you know him!”

Yang Ye and A’Leng gazed at Huang Ying, “We do?”

Huang Ying smiled, “It’s Sky Lord!”

Sky Lord!

The middle aged man’s figure appeared in Yang Ye’s mind.

Meanwhile, Huang Ying continued, “Since then, no one in our race has dared to act as they please in the city. The strong do not act as they please in my desolate race. Besides that, the resources of my desolate race are made available to everyone. Of course, there are preconditions, and it’s that we must fight for them. For example, everyone can fight to be the Crown Prince, even the most ordinary person in the desolate race and fight for it!”

A'Leng spoke softly, “No wonder Eternal Kingdom lost all those years ago! Eternal Kingdom used to be selfish, arrogant, and haughty. As far as they were concerned, every other world besides Eternal Kingdom was a low-level world, and the people throughout the universe were low-level beings. Once something reaches the peak, it usually suffers decline!”

She gazed at Huang Ying and continued, “If your race hadn’t indiscriminately killed the sprites of this world, perhaps you would have succeeded!”

Huang Ying laughed bitterly.

That was the desolate race’s stupidest decision!

The Sprite Progenitor!

The Sprite Progenitor’s ability to bring the world together was truly too terrifying!

Huang Ying couldn’t help but glance at Yang Ye at this point. After all, there was a Sprite Progenitor with this fellow in front of him.

It didn’t take long for them to stop.

There was a hall before them.

Desolate Hall!Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Two people were standing at its entrance, it was Huang Ye and Huang Tianxing who’d restored his physical body.

Huang Ying walked over and smiled, “Are you still going to continue?”

Huang Ye spoke indifferently, “Congratulations!”

Congratulations!

Obviously, saying that meant he was admitting defeat. While all of them had backing, they were still the most important factor. Because the people who backed them would never engage in internal strife.

Five World Realm experts were prohibited from fighting each other!

Huang Ying glanced at them and nodded slightly before walking toward the hall. Right when they were about to enter, a voice came from behind them, “Wait.”

They turned around.

A woman was standing there.

She wore beast skin clothes. She wasn’t very old and just around 18 or 19, but she seemed very mature. Her face was icy cold and emotionless.

Huang Ying and the others frowned from the sight of her because they didn’t recognize her.

She spoke indifferently, “You want to be the Crown Prince?”

Huang Ying nodded, “Who are you?”

She clenched her right fist slowly and said, “Huang Cangyue!”

Huang Cangyue?

Huang Ying was stunned and gazed at Huang Ye. The latter spoke solemnly, “Since she has the ‘苍’ which represents sky, she must be from the Sky Lord’s line.”

The desolate race had nine main lines that carried the purest bloodlines. The rest of their people could only be considered as commoners. Even though they had the bloodline of the desolate race, it was very scarce. Of course, if they could awaken the bloodline within them, then it would be a completely different situation.

Huang Ying restrained his thoughts and gazed at her, “Do you need something?”

She spoke indifferently, “Nothing much. I just want to see what right you have to be our Crown Prince.”

She suddenly attacked once she finished speaking.

A punch!

She suddenly appeared before Huang Ying and slammed a punch at him.

The expressions of everyone here changed from the sight of this.

Huang Ying’s expression even changed drastically. He slammed a palm forward, and powerful energy rippled out of it.

Bam!

An explosion resounded, and then Huang Ying was pushed over 10km back!

Suddenly, Huang Cangyue vanished on the spot, and she was in front of him when she appeared again. However, her punch didn’t slam down upon him, it slammed down to the right of his head.

Boom!

That expanse of space was instantly obliterated!

Everyone here was stunned!

Even with their strength, the space here was impossible to destroy without a Super Divine Treasure! However, she’d accomplished it with just a punch!

So how terrifying was her strength?

“The Barbarian Physique!” Suddenly, Sword Scroll’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s head, “It’s one of the ten great physiques like Miss An’s Martial God Physique!”

Meanwhile, Huang Cangyue gazed at Yang Ye, “Tell that woman with the Martial God Physique to show herself. I want to see if her physique or mine is stronger!”

Yang Ye hadn’t even said anything when An Nanjing appeared in front of him.

An Nanjing gazed calmly at Huang Cangyue, “I don’t want to fight you!”

“Why?” Huang Cangyue laughed coldly, “Are you afraid?”

An Nanjing replied indifferently, “I’m afraid that I’ll kill you!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
