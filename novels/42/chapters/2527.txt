Chapter 2528 – I’m So, So Afraid!

As the greatest sect in the West Region, the Ancient Sword Sect naturally had many subordinate powers. It could be said that practically all the clans, sects, and smaller powers throughout the West Region obeyed the Ancient Sword Sect!

There were probably a few hundred of them in total!

Of course, the Ancient Sword Sect only valued the strongest among them, and it didn’t care about the rest.

Once he left the sect, Yang Ye went to an ancient city called Cloud City.

There was a clan subordinate to the Ancient Sword Sect in this city!

Once he entered the city, he arrived at an estate according to the information the Grand Elder had provided him.

Shangyun Estate!

Yang Ye knocked on the door, and it didn’t take long for an old man to open it. The old man glanced at him and said, “May I know who you are?”

Yang Ye replied, “The Ancient Sword Sect, I’m here to see your patriarch!”

The Ancient Sword Sect!

The old man was shocked and hurriedly said, “Please wait a moment, I’ll report your arrival!”

He didn’t even dare to close the door upon finishing and just left.

As far as people like him were concerned, the disciples of a sect like the Ancient Sword Sect were like divine beings.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

It didn’t take long for a middle aged man to come out, and he was slightly stunned when he saw Yang Ye. However, it didn’t take long for him to recover from his surprise and cup his fist at Yang Ye, “I’m Shangyun Xin, the Grand Elder of the Shangyun Clan. May I know your name?”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Ye Yang.”

Ye Yang!

Shangyun Xin had a rather weird expression on his face because Yang Ye hadn’t declared his identity. However, Shangyun Xin didn’t dare to act rudely and immediately led Yang Ye inside.

In the hall, Shangyun Xin gestured for Yang Ye to have a seat while he stood instead.

Yang Ye smiled, “Please have a seat too!”

Shangyun Xin hesitated for a moment, and then he nodded and sat before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “Tell me about it!”

Shangyun Xin explained, “Not too long ago, our patriarch suddenly died in his room. In the beginning, we thought something happened during his cultivation, but we later noticed that his soul had been extracted.”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “His soul had been extracted?”

Shangyun Xin nodded slightly, “Indeed.”

Yang Ye asked, “What about the rest?”

Shangyun Xin replied, “Nothing happened to the other. However, according to my investigations, everyone in the city who’s at the Five World Realm has vanished without a trace.”

The Five World Realm!

Yang Ye took a sip of tea. Obviously, someone was targeting Five World Realm experts!

Yang Ye asked, “Can you take me to your patriarch’s corpse?”

Shangyun Xin nodded, and then he led Yang Ye out of the hall. A short while later, they arrived at a memorial hall, and Yang Ye saw the corpse there.

There were no signs of injuries on the corpse. It could be said that the corpse was completely unharmed, but its soul was gone!

Yang Ye walked closer and looked carefully, but he noticed nothing.

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Did you hear any fighting?”

Shangyun Xin shook his head, “Not even a bit!”

Yang Ye asked, “Who was the last to see him?”

Shangyun Xin replied, “My niece, my elder brother’s daughter.”

Yang Ye replied, “I want to see her!”

Shangyun Xin hesitated for a moment and nodded. A short while later, a beautiful woman around the age of 20 appeared before Yang Ye.

Her name was Shangyun Xian, and she was the previous patriarch’s daughter.

She glanced at him and remained silent.

Yang Ye asked, “Miss Xian, there was something wrong with him when you met him last, right?”

She nodded.

Yang Ye asked, “Where was it?”

Shangyun Xian spoke solemnly, “In the cultivation room!”

Yang Ye said, “I need to have a look!”

Shangyun Xin hesitated to speak while Shangyun Xian spoke frankly, “Allow me to be honest, doing this is just a waste of time. Because we’ve inspected the place countless times, and even the Ancient Sword Sect’s elders inspected the place when they came. However, they found nothing. So, instead of wasting time, how about…”

Yang Ye asked, “How about what?”

Shangyun Xian replied indifferently, “How about you go look somewhere else?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Just take me there!”

Shangyun Xian wanted to say more, but Shangyun Xin suddenly said, “Take him there!”

Shangyun Xian glanced at Yang Ye and left.

Yang Ye followed her. However, when he arrived at the door, he suddenly turned around and gazed at Shangyun Xin, “Elder Shangyun Xin, you seem to be at the Five World Realm too!”

Yang Ye turned around and left the memorial hall.

Shangyun Xin’s figure stiffened on the spot, and a long time passed before he took a deep breath and followed them.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive at a cultivation room under Shangyun Xian’s lead. Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he closed his eyes. A short while later, a wave of mysterious energy enveloped the surroundings.

The Sword Domain!

Everything was fully displayed before him while the Sword Domain enveloped the area!

A short moment later, Yang Ye sensed a remnant of an evil aura, and he captured it. Meanwhile, Sword Scroll said, “It’s the Soul Extraction Technique!”

“Soul Extraction Technique?” Yang Ye asked, “What is that?”

A short while passed before Sword Scroll explained, “An ancient evil technique that was present during my era. At that time, Eternal Kingdom had an evil sect, the Soul Sect. It was an extremely evil sect because they were fond of extracting the souls of cultivators. Moreover, they targeted powerful experts. As for why they did that, no one knows. In the end, they offended some of the powers in Eternal Kingdom, and the Eternal Lord of that time gave the order for them to start annihilating the Soul Sect. It didn’t take long for the Soul Sect to vanish from Eternal Kingdom.”

Yang Ye said, “They vanished but weren’t annihilated, right?”

Sword Scroll replied, “Yes, they were annihilated and only vanished! Now, they are back. This is quite a serious problem. Because it seems like they may be hiding in the West Region, so you must report this to the sect!”

Yang Ye nodded and dispersed the Sword Domain.

He glanced at Shangyun Xian, and the latter gazed at him. Yang Ye asked, “You’re a sword cultivator?”

She nodded.

Yang Ye sized her up carefully. She was at the Two World Realm, and her sword intent was condensed well. Her cultivation as a sword cultivator wasn’t weak, so she was qualified to join the Ancient Sword Sect.

Yang Ye asked, “Why haven’t you joined the Ancient Sword Sect?”

She replied indifferently, “I don’t have enough World Crystals for the outer court elders!”

Yang Ye was stunned, and it didn’t take long for him to understand what she meant. Even he had relied on paying bribes to enter the Ancient Sword Sect!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “If you still wish to join the Ancient Sword Sect, then you can go report into the outer court once this is all over. Just tell them I told you to report in!”

She glanced at Yang Ye and asked, “Are you the Sect Master’s son?”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Shangyun Xian asked, “Your status in the Ancient Sword Sect is quite high, right?”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s alright.”

She spoke solemnly, “I don’t want to think about that right now. All I care about is finding out who killed my father. Have you found out anything?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I have found something.”

He withdrew a transmission talisman and crushed it, and then it transformed into a ray of light that vanished before him.

A transmission!

But it only took a moment for his expression to change because his transmission had been stopped by a mysterious force before it could leave the city!

Yang Ye grinned, “Interesting!”

Shangyun Xian asked, “What is it?”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s nothing. Let’s head outside!”

They left the cultivation room and arrived at the hall. Shangyun Xin arrived before them, but at this moment, anxiety clearly covered his face.

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

Shangyun Xin spoke solemnly, “A formation has surrounded the city. No one can enter or leave the city, even transmission talismans can’t be sent!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he left the hall with them and went outside. At this moment, there was an expanse of gray covering the sky above the city. But if anyone looked in from the outside, the city would seem completely normal!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and he saw mist throughout the city. It enveloped the entire city, causing vision to be extremely poor here!

The entire city had instantly fallen into chaos!

Yang Ye asked, “What’s going on?”

Shangyun Xin shook his head, “I don’t know. It just suddenly turned like this. Someone definitely set up a formation around the city.”

He hesitated for a moment and added, “They may be aware that you’re here at Shangyun City.”

Yang Ye gazed at him, “You’re saying that they are targeting me?”

Shangyun Xin nodded slightly, “That may not be all. Perhaps they are targeting the entire city. W-What do they want?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while, and then he walked outside. Shangyun Xian and Shangyun Xin hesitated for a moment before following him outside.

They arrived before the city gates, but there was endless mist outside the gates, so they couldn’t see anything beyond it. During this period, people charged out of the city from time to time, but it wouldn’t take long for shrill cries to resound after them!

Shangyun Xin spoke solemnly, “We can’t leave the city!”

He hesitated for a moment and added, “Can you notify the elders of the Ancient Sword Sect?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Transmission talismans can’t get out of the city.”

Shangyun Xin’s face instantly turned unsightly.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and he noticed that there was something off here!

Suddenly, a man in white clothes floated over toward them. The man’s hair was dragged against the ground as he floated through the air, and there were drafts of cold wind blowing around him.

Needless to say, at a time and place like this, it was quite a horrifying sight.

Yang Ye glanced at him, and then he thumped his chest lightly, “I’m so, so afraid.”
