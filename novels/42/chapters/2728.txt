Chapter 2729 – Just Do It!

The 9th layer of space.

Yang Ye charged incessantly toward the Four Dimensional Universe, and he would return whenever he was almost there.

Just like that, he did it over and over again, and he grew slightly stronger every single time!

Time passed rapidly, and two weeks passed in the blink of an eye.

During this time, Yang Ye charged toward the border of the Four Dimensional Universe on many occasions. Now, his explosive version of the Madness Sword Technique had undergone a qualitative transformation.

In the spatial passageway, an explosion resounded, and Yang Ye retreated to the 9th layer of space.

Yang Ye closed his eyes on the spot.

He seemed like a monk in meditation, and his aura was completely restrained!

A long time passed before he opened his eyes and walked off into the distance.

This time, he didn’t speed up and just walked over.

A short while later, Yang Ye arrived near the border, and the terrifying spatial energy of the Four Dimensional Universe appeared in waves within the spatial passageway.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, but he still did nothing!

The energy got closer and closer, and increasingly stronger too!

However, Yang Ye still didn’t speed up or attack.

Finally, the energy was just 1m away from him.

Suddenly, he looked up and stomped his right foot down.

Bang!

The space beneath his foot was instantly obliterated, and he vanished on the spot. A ray of sword energy slashed forward.

It was so fast and strong that it was countless times superior than before!

Most importantly, Yang Ye didn’t run to increase his speed, he’d done so in an instant!

“Slash!” Yang Ye shouted with fury, and then everything before him was slashed into bits, but he didn’t stop and swung his sword swiftly.

The first attack was the Explosive Heavenrend, and now he was using the Explosive Madness Sword Technique!

Hiss!

The space before him exploded inch by inch, and it didn’t take long for it to vanish completely.

At this moment, he wasn’t in the spatial passageway, he was in an expanse of outer space.

A boundless starry sky.

He’d emerged from the spatial passageway!

Yang Ye looked back, and he saw the spatial rift gradually closing.

He didn’t head back this time!

Because he’d completed his training!

Yang Ye glanced at his body, and it had still been cracked open. However, based on his recuperation, it was nothing and would heal in a short while!

Yang Ye shot a glance into the starry sky above. It was covered in stars and was simply boundless!

Where were Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu?

Yang Ye frowned. Where would he go searching for them in this boundless place?

Suddenly, the space above him shook, and then a strand of powerful pressure converged there.

Obviously, the eyes were about to appear again!

Yang Ye clenched his fists slowly.

A moment later, he turned around and fled.

He fled extremely swiftly to the point he’d vanished into the distance in the blink of an eye.

Even though his strength had improved tremendously, he hadn’t allowed himself to get overconfident and think that he was unmatched. Moreover, he was mainly here to search for Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu, not to fight.

However, the eyes didn’t let him go.

Yang Ye suddenly stopped far away. It was because the eyes had suddenly appeared above him, and the space before him had started to warp.

Yang Ye looked up at the eyes, and he saw them looking at him.

Yang Ye clenched his sword sheath tightly in his left hand, “I’m here to look for someone, not cause trouble. So give me some face, alright?”

Swish!

A huge, dark black palm descended from the sky above Yang Ye!

The powerful pressure it emanated as it descended caused the space around Yang Ye to sink down repeatedly.

Yang Ye’s face turned solemn. The owner of that pair of eyes was truly formidable. Even now, it still felt dangerous to him!

Extremely dangerous!

This time, Yang Ye didn’t choose to flee.

If it was possible, he naturally didn’t want to cause trouble, but since it was unavoidable, he chose to fight!

Yang Ye looked up and stomped his right foot down.

Boom!

The space beneath his feet collapsed and formed a deep abyss! Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s figure shot up into the air, and he slashed his sword at the palm.

A ray of light shot through the center of the huge palm.

An instant later, the huge palm cracked open while the ray of sword energy didn’t slow down as it charged at the eyes!

The eyes gazed at Yang Ye from above, and it had only indifference.

It was like an elephant gazing at an ant!

Suddenly, the black sword chest on Yang Ye’s back shook, and then five swords shot up into the air. They lined up in a row, and then the energy of the five elements here converged abruptly!Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye grinned, and his figure rapidly spun backward.

The energy of the five elements behind Yang Ye suddenly exploded. In an instant, the entire area shook and rippled violently, and the eyes were instantly enveloped by the explosions.

As for Yang Ye, he’d fled.

He’d fled very swiftly. In just an instant, he’d vanished far into the distance.

Yang Ye shot through the starry sky on his sword while the five element swords followed closely behind him. He shot a glance backward, and his expression changed drastically. It was because the space behind him had cracked open, and then a black beam of light surged out from there.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He didn’t dare act carefully and hurriedly stopped. After that, he issued a command in his heart. The five element swords that had entered the sword chest a moment ago suddenly shot out once more, and they slashed at the beam of light. However, they hadn’t even been able to get close to it before the powerful energy it emanated pushed them back repeatedly. They were pushed all the way behind Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye felt the pressure too!

An Nanjing suddenly appeared by Yang Ye’s side, and then they vanished on the spot.

A spear and a sword suddenly stabbed at the top of the beam, but the beam didn’t vanish. Conversely, they were slammed backward repeatedly.

After being pushed around 3km back, Yang Ye and An Nanjing stomped their right feet down and stopped themselves from going further. However, the space behind them instantly exploded apart!

Meanwhile, a ferocious grin curled up on An Nanjing’s lips. She suddenly released Dagger-Axe, squatted down halfway in midair, and then kicked the back of the spear.

Hiss!

Dagger-Axe instantly pierced through the beam of light. Meanwhile, An Nanjing stretched out her right hand and grabbed the spear before charging over. At the same time, the beam of light started to explode inch by inch!

As for Yang Ye, he didn’t just stand by idly. He moved past the beam of light and charged at the spatial rift. An Nanjing arrived there just as he did!

Yang Ye slashed with his sword while An Nanjing stabbed her spear at it!

Bang!

The space around them shook, and then something seemed to be blasted back within the spatial rift.

But just a moment later, the rift expanded, and then a wave of powerful energy surged out like a torrent.

Bang! Bang!

Yang Ye and An Nanjing were instantly blasted 3km away!

She stabbed her spear backward and stopped herself immediately. Meanwhile, Yang Ye stabbed his sword down and used the space beneath him to forcibly stop himself!

Both of them looked up, and the spatial rift was still expanding. A moment later, a huge ethereal figure appeared before them.

The figure seemed to be in human form. It had two hands, two feet, and was over 30m tall. It was a giant. However, it had just one eye and nothing else, it was just flat!

Obviously, it was formed from the eyes!

Yang Ye and An Nanjing remained indifferent and just stood there without displaying any fear!

Meanwhile, the giant started walking in their direction.

An Nanjing stretched her right hand behind her back and twisted her ponytail around her neck. After that, she stretched her right leg back and bent her left knee slightly. She seemed like she was about to dash forward.

A moment of silence ensued.

An Nanjing suddenly pushed down with her left leg. In an instant, her figure appeared above the giant, and she hurled Dagger-Axe at the giant.

Hiss!

The spear pierced through space as it descended, and the powerful force it carried was simply capable of tearing open everything!

Meanwhile, the giant suddenly slapped its fist upward.

As soon as its fist moved, a wave of powerful energy forcibly stopped Dagger-Axe. Moreover, it started moving backward at an increasing rate, and at the instant the fist touched the spear, An Nanjing suddenly kicked the back of the spear.

Bang!

Two types of energy instantly erupted. The space around them started to explode inch by inch, and the powerful wave of force affected the space in a huge area.

An Nanjing was instantly blasted away.

At the moment An Nanjing was blasted away, Yang Ye suddenly appeared before the giant, and then countless rays of sword energy sliced down at the giant! It was the five element swords!

The five swords crisscrossed and sliced the giant incessantly!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Extremely deep cuts started to appear around the giant, but just a moment later, it slammed its palms in both directions.

Boom!

A wave of powerful pressure swept out from it and blasted Yang Ye away!

Suddenly, An Nanjing appeared above the giant again, and then she stabbed Dagger-Axe at its head.

However, the giant stopped the spear with its palm!

But right when it stopped the spear, a ray of sword energy suddenly appeared between the giant’s legs. A moment later, Yang Ye’s sword stabbed there!

Sausage Slicer!

But Yang Ye was stunned just a moment later.

Because it was empty!

Nothing?

It’s female?

What the heck?!
