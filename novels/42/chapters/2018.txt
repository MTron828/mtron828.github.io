Chapter 2019 – Horizon Mountain!

There was a sword in front of Yang Ye, and it was trembling.

It was the Unfettered One’s sword!

“What is it?” Yang Ye frowned. Suddenly, the sword stopped and floated silently in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye took the sword in his grasp, and then it trembled slightly before quickly returning to calm.

Yang Ye fell into deep thought while looking at the sword, and then he left the Primordial Pagoda.

Meanwhile, Liao Fan suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, “Brother Ye, I suddenly thought of the fact you seemed to have used physical strength while fighting that young man from the devil race. Are you a body cultivator?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Sort of!”

A body cultivator!

Su Xiu and A’Xiu gazed at Yang Ye when they heard this.

Body cultivators were very rare in the human race because it was too painful. As far as humans were concerned, cultivating the body was like asking for torture. Moreover, the human body was much inferior when compared to the bodies of the demon or devil race!

Meanwhile, Liao Fan smiled, “Body cultivators are very rare. Brother Ye, your willpower is truly admirable to be able to cultivate your body to such an extent!”

Yang Ye smiled and didn’t say anything.

Meanwhile, they suddenly looked up into the distance. Horizon Mountain was there. It wasn’t that tall, but it was very wide and almost borderless. As for the area behind the mountain, it was an endless ocean!

There was a ray of white light flickering in the sky above the mountain.

A solemn expression instantly appeared on Yang Ye’s face when he saw it. Danger! It felt dangerous to him!

Yang Ye asked, “What’s that?”

Liao Fan shook his head, “I don’t know.” He glanced at the surroundings and continued, “Let’s go!”

It didn’t take long for them to arrive at the foot of Horizon Mountain.

The white light was still there far above them.

Liao Fan looked up, “The white light is a forbidden area. It stops us from getting to the top of the mountain, and the Sage Ruins should be at the top.”

Yang Ye asked, “Didn’t all the races send their experts to deal with it?”

Liao Fan grinned, “It’s naturally possible if they sent a Sage. However, why would they do that? Brother Ye, the Sage Ruins is actually just a place those old fellows use to train us. As far as they’re concerned, Sage Ruins can temper geniuses from the various races. Otherwise, they would be here as soon as a Sage Ruins appears, and we would never have a chance to grow!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

Meanwhile, Liao Fan smiled, “Don’t worry, while it’s powerful, it’s not impossible to deal with. After all, the top geniuses of all the races are here.”

As he spoke, he pressed two fingers together, and there was a golden card between them, “An invitation sent by the devil race’s Mo Xiao. All strong geniuses received one.” He looked up at the white light and continued, “If a single person can’t deal with it, then what about 10 or even 100?”

Suddenly, A’Xiu said, “We don’t have invitations!”

Liao Fan smiled, “It’s fine. Once Mo Xiao meets all of you, he’ll give you invitations too. Let’s go!”

As he spoke, Liao Fan transformed into a gust of wind that vanished into the distance.

Su Xiu and A’Xiu hurriedly followed after him.

Yang Ye looked up at the white light, and then he frowned slightly. When he got closer to it, he sensed something strange from it.

It felt familiar!

It actually felt quite familiar to him!

Meanwhile, Liao Fan’s voice came from afar, “Brother Ye, you’ll get lost if you don’t keep up!”

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and vanished on the spot.

It didn’t take long for them to arrive before a waterfall at the bottom of the mountain. There were around 10 people here. Yang Ye glanced at them, and the weakest amongst them was at the See Dao Realm!

There was no lack of geniuses in the world!

The black robed man who led the group nodded slightly to Liao Fan when he saw them, and then he glanced at Yang Ye and the others, “Who’re they?”

Liao Fan introduced them, “This is Su Xiao, a See Dao Realm expert. This is A’Xiu, a See Dao Realm expert as well!” He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “This is Brother Ye, he’s…”

Yang Ye stopped concealing his aura, so everyone sensed his cultivation.

The Hear Dao Realm!

Yang Ye noticed that many had surprise on their faces. Of course, some revealed a trace of ridicule.

Liao Fan was astounded, “Brother Ye, you’re just at the Hear Dao Realm?”

Yang Ye nodded, “What’s wrong?”

Liao Fan’s lips twitched, and then slight embarrassment appeared on his face.

Even though they were only two small ranks above Yang Ye, it was like the difference between the heavens and the earth. Surmounting his realm of cultivation? There were many geniuses capable of that, and all of them were such existences. However, it depended on the target!

Perhaps there were people capable of surmounting their realms of cultivation against the people here, but there were absolutely few people like that. But Yang Ye didn’t look like such an extraordinary genius.

Yang Ye was smart, so how could he be unable to discern what they were thinking? He smiled, “Realms of cultivation can’t fully display a person’s strength, right?”

“Oh?” A young man suddenly stepped forward and smiled, “It sounds like you’re saying that while you’re just at the Hear Dao Realm, you aren’t any weaker to See Dao Realm experts like us. Is that right?”

Yang Ye glanced at the young man, “I don’t mean to offend.”

“But that’s exactly what I think you’re doing!” The young man looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “We don’t need trash, understand?”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was in front of the young man when he appeared again. The young man’s reaction was extremely swift, and he slammed his palm forward, causing the space before him to ripple.

Bang!

However, the young man was punched over 1km away.

At this moment, everyone gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye started walking towards the young man, “Actually, you’re absolutely right. I’m not weaker than all of you at all. That’s exactly what I meant.”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Bang!

The young man’s figure slammed against the mountain wall.

Boom!

The mountain wall shook violently while countless rocks crashed down.

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared in front of the young man, and then he grabbed the young man by the throat, “Do you have a problem with what I said?”

The young man gazed silently at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye squeezed down, and the young man turned purple. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Suddenly, Liao Fan said, “Brother Ye, please show mercy!”

Yang Ye glanced at him, and then released the young man who fell to the ground.

Liao Fan smiled, and then he gazed at the black robed man, “Brother Mo Xiao, my friend’s strength is alright, right?”

Mo Xiao sized up Yang Ye, “A body cultivator?”

Yang Ye replied, “Sort of!”

Mo Xiao nodded slightly, “Cultivating to such an extent with the body of a human is rare indeed. While you’re only at the Hear Dao Realm, it’s just as you’ve said, you’re not weaker to us. Our chances of success will increase with you on our side!”

Yang Ye asked, “To destroy that white light?”

Mo Xiao shook his head slightly, “Perhaps we can if all the geniuses here join forces, but just our forces are far from enough. It’s so strong that it can kill a Zen Realm expert with ease!”

“Then what are we going to do?” Liao Fan asked, “How will we get to the top without dealing with it?”

Mo Xiao smiled, “It’s very simple, we’ll join forces to resist it but avoid getting locked in combat with it. We just have to ascend the mountain quickly! Because it won’t chase after us once we get up the mountain. That’s how many others got through to the top!”

Liao Fan asked, “How many?”

“Not many!” Mo Xiao explained, “We still have a chance. After all, the inheritance of a Sage is definitely not that easy to obtain. Even if there are many there, someone will definitely get the Inheritance Seed, and so long as the Inheritance Seed exists, it doesn’t make a difference to us!”

They planned to seize the Inheritance Seed!

Yang Ye glanced at Mo Xiao. This fellow is brutal!

However, it made sense because only the strong would obtain the treasures of the world. Even if something belonged to a person, it would change owners if that person wasn’t strong enough!

Liao Fan asked, “We’re going up right now?”

Mo Xiao nodded, “Let me say this before we go. We’re all on the same boat, so we must stay united towards outsiders. After all, many people here have joined forces. If we don’t stay united, we’ll definitely be crushed. I’m sure killing and stealing isn’t something all of you are unfamiliar with!”

They nodded to display their lack of objections!

Mo Xiao looked up at the white light, “Let’s go. If it attacks us, we’ll join forces against it. Let me emphasize that all of you must use your full strength because it can kill Zen Realm experts!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he led the group up the mountain. They traveled very swiftly, and all of them had extremely solemn and vigilant expressions on their faces.

Right when they arrived halfway up the mountain, the white light suddenly emanated a sharp howl and instantly shot towards them.

Mo Xiao and the others' faces fell.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s eyes opened wide, “How can this be…”
