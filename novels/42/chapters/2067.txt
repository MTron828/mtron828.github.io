Chapter 2068 – Return to the Weapon Path!

Book 18 — Nowhere is Safe

“Why?” Yang Ye was really puzzled as he looked the old man in the eyes.

The old man didn’t say anything. He just flicked a blood red command token to Yang Ye.

There were two words on it—Yang Ye.

Yang Ye asked, “What’s that?”

“A Sage Warrant!” The gray robed old man explained, “There’s an alliance in the large universe. It’s called the Sage Alliance. It’s a mysterious organization outside the control of the four paths and Martial Emperor Academy, and its members are all Sages. They are Sages from the various races, and they formed that alliance to form a united front against the progenitors of the four paths.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why have they issued a bounty on me?”

The old man shook his head slightly, “I don’t know. Now, you have less than 10 minutes to leave the academy!”

Yang Ye asked, “Martial Emperor Academy fears the Sage Alliance?”

“Fear?” The old man spoke indifferently, “My academy naturally doesn’t fear them, and I know what you are trying to say. You must realize that you aren’t a student of the academy. If you were, then even if the four paths issued a bounty for your head, the academy would still keep you safe. Unfortunately, you’re not a student of the academy, and you’re not worth the price we’ll have to pay to fight the Sage Alliance. You don’t mind me being direct, right?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “I don’t. It’s very normal.” He cupped his fist and said, “Farewell!”

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to leave once he finished speaking.

Once Yang Ye left, a voice resounded abruptly, “He’s not bad!”

The old man nodded slightly, “The vortex he’s in is too huge, and the academy doesn’t want to be swept into it right now!”

The voice fell silent.

…

After he left Avaricious Wolf Mountain, Yang Ye looked up at the sky. A long time passed before a smile curled up on the corners of his mouth, “The Sage Alliance?”

He transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

As soon as he left Martial Emperor City, the space in front of him trembled, and then a voice resounded from there, “Return to the Weapon Path!”

It was Zhong Ye’s voice.

Yang Ye frowned slightly. Obviously, something had happened because Zhong Ye’s voice was slightly anxious.

Return to the Weapon Path!

Yang Ye fell silent for some time. Right when he was about to leave, a woman in white clothes appeared not too far away from him. The woman held a white paper parasol, and she was the same woman who’d recommended Yang Ye to the Sky Class.

A wisp of surprise flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, “What are you doing here?”

The woman replied, “The Sage Alliance placed a bounty on your head!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I know. But how do you know?”

She replied, “The Sky Class received the warrant too!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “What? The Sky Class wants to kill me too?”

She nodded, “Some are tempted. Because the compensation is an Originite, a real Originite. So, many others besides us are tempted too.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and asked, “Do you know why they put that bounty on me?”

She replied, “If I’m not wrong, it should be because of the Prehistoric Ruins.”

“The Prehistoric Ruins?” Yang Ye frowned slightly, “Just because I’ve been in it?”

She shook her head slightly, “Do you know that the mysterious buildings you encountered have appeared in the Prehistoric Ruins which belong to the academy, the four paths, and those mysterious organizations?”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

She replied, “The four paths and other mysterious organizations have sent their forces into those mysterious buildings, but practically all of them died, even a Sage. There was someone who came out alive, but it was a progenitor from the Buddhist Path. Now, another person has emerged safely, and that person is you!”

She glanced at him and asked, “You met someone from the prehistoric civilization, right?”

Yang Ye didn’t conceal it and nodded because it was pointless to lie about it. After all, they’d already guessed the answer.

She tightened her grip on her parasol upon seeing Yang Ye confirm it, but her face remained extremely calm, “What did they tell you?”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “You’re very interested in it?”

She nodded, “The world is.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Didn’t that progenitor from the Buddhist Path go in there too?”

She replied, “Who would go looking for him?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Looks like it’s strength that caused all of this. If I had the strength of a progenitor, then I presume that the Sage Alliance wouldn’t dare to come looking for me, right?”

She spoke indifferently, “Unfortunately, you don’t!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Let me guess, you gave me that recommendation letter for two reasons. Firstly, you hoped that I would die in the test. Secondly, you probably were trying to buy time so that I wouldn’t leave the academy so soon, right?”

In the beginning, he’d been quite suspicious when she gave him the recommendation letter.

After all, nothing came free in this world. She didn’t know him at all, so she had no reason to recommend him. As for appreciating his strength, while the strength he’d revealed was quite strong, it wasn’t that great. It wasn’t sufficient to impress a genius like her.

However, he hadn’t expected that someone had put a bounty on his head.

The woman closed her eyes slowly, “You’re not ordinary, and neither is your strength. I don’t want to fight you to the death. So just hand over what you obtained in that mysterious ruins and tell me what you encountered there, alright?”

Yang Ye smiled, “What if I refuse?”

The woman suddenly opened her eyes, and then her parasol vanished abruptly. An instant later, it appeared above Yang Ye, and then countless rays of light shot out from it. In just an instant, Yang Ye was enveloped by them.

Meanwhile, a ray of white light shot upwards from within the rays of light, and then an ethereal white dragon appeared behind Yang Ye. The huge ethereal dragon had blocked away all the rays of light.

The woman’s expression remained indifferent as she twisted her hand slightly. In an instant, violet lightning flashed out from the parasol, and they struck the ethereal dragon behind Yang Ye.

Bang!

A dragon roar resounded while Yang Ye was pushed over 300m back! At this moment, Yang Ye’s body was covered in electricity.

Numb!

Yang Ye felt numb right now. The bolt of lightning has instantly numbed his entire body. If he hadn’t circulated the Primordial Violet Energy within him, he may have been rendered immobile.

As expected of someone from the Sky Class! Yang Ye took a deep breath. He’d never considered himself to be unmatched in the younger generation. He once rarely had opponents, but it didn’t represent that there weren’t any capable of rivaling him. This woman who was about the same age as him possessed strength that wasn’t any weaker to his own!

Swish!

Meanwhile, another bolt of lightning flashed down from above Yang Ye, and it was like a snake that shot down at Yang Ye. This time, Yang Ye didn’t dare to resist it head-on with just his physical defenses.

Yang Ye raised his palm and a sword soundlessly appeared on it. An instant later, the sword started spinning rapidly, and then it transformed into a ray of light that shot up into the air.

Boom!

A resounding explosion surged through the area above Yang Ye, and then countless rays of sword energy and electricity swept towards the surroundings. Meanwhile, Yang Ye waved his hand, and a ray of light flashed before a sword appeared in his grasp. A moment later, he vanished on the spot and appeared in front of the woman.

Yang Ye stabbed his sword forward. It was just a simple stabbing motion.

He was most skilled in close quarters combat!

Meanwhile, a parasol appeared before the woman, and Yang Ye’s sword stabbed it. Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically, and his figure was blasted away.

Once he stopped himself, he glanced at his right hand, and he noticed that it was covered in blood. At least 90% of the force of his attack had been bounced back to him.

Yang Ye looked up at her, or to be more precise, he was looking at her parasol.

“The Lightning Nirvana Umbrella!” Meanwhile, she spoke abruptly, “A divine treasure once used by a progenitor. It contains nine Divine Sky Lightning Seeds, and the energy of rebirth. So, even Sages can’t harm me while I have it in my possession.”

She started walking slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, “I’ll give you one last chance. I guarantee that you’ll regret it if you don’t cherish this opportunity!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Is that so?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took a step forward, and a wave of mysterious energy appeared here.

The Sword Domain!

At this moment, she stopped moving.

Suddenly, two swords appeared in Yang Ye’s grasp. Moreover, another huge ethereal sword appeared from within Yang Ye.

Three swords!

Her eyes narrowed slightly from the sight of this, and her parasol started to tremble in her grasp. It seemed like it was telling her something.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye grinned, “Come! Stop three of my swords!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot, and the three swords were arranged in a ‘品’ pattern as they shot toward her.

The woman took a small step back, and then her parasol suddenly started spinning. In an instant, bolts of lightning surged forward, and it only took an instant for the area to be enveloped by numerous arcs of lightning.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s swords arrived before her.
