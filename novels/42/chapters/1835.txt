Chapter 1836 – Pavilion Master!

She has seen me before? Yang Ye was stunned.

All the others gazed at him as well.

Suddenly, the masked woman shook her head, “Wait! You’re not him!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

The masked woman suddenly tapped her finger against Yang Ye’s forehead. Yang Ye’s eyes opened wide because he noticed something sweep through his entire body. At the same time, he noticed that the Primordial Pagoda went completely still. At this moment, even he couldn’t sense its presence.

Around two breaths of time later, she suddenly removed her hand. She gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before she said, “Your destiny has been changed by at least three people. Now, your destiny is in disorder!”

“My destiny was changed?” Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he said, “What destiny?”

The masked woman waved her hand, “Paths. Everyone is born with his or her own path, and that path is that person’s destiny.”

Yang Ye asked, “Based on what you’ve just said, a person’s accomplishments are set in stone at birth?”

“No!” The masked woman shook her head slightly, “Cultivation. One can ceaselessly improve oneself through cultivation. Once one’s strength arrives at a certain level, that person will be able to see his or her own destiny and change it. However, this change isn’t a change of the original path, it’s a change where the person leaves the original path and enters a new path. Do you understand what I mean?”

Yang Ye nodded, “What you mean is that the path hasn’t changed at all, and the person just jumps from one circle into another one!”

“Indeed!” She continued, “That’s the destiny of an ordinary person. But there are two more types. One of them is a forced destiny.”

“A forced destiny?” Yang Ye frowned, “What do you mean?”

She turned to look at Blood Maiden and the others, “Their destinies were forcefully changed in the beginning as well.”

Blood maiden and the others frowned because they didn’t really understand what she meant.

Meanwhile, she gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “A forced destiny represents that someone arranged a path for the person, and that person is forced to take that path. For example, a puppet. It moves according to the puppeteer’s will. That’s a forced destiny.”

She sized up Yang Ye at this point and added, “You were once a puppet too!”

Yang Ye frowned, “You’re saying that someone arranged a path for me, and I could only take that path?”

The masked woman nodded, “However, someone paid a huge price to turn your destiny around and made it return to your original path. Or to be more precise, you were once a puppet. However, there was a period where you were a complete person and possessed your own destiny.”

“A period?” Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “You mean I’m not like that anymore?”

She gazed at him for a long time and said, “Your destiny is tainted with great karma. So, I can’t see through your path anymore! That’s the third type of destiny, a blurred destiny!”

Yang Ye fell silent.

The masked woman suddenly asked, “You don’t believe me?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I do. Because you have no reason to lie to me. However, I have a question. If I kill myself right now, then what would my destiny be?”

The woman fell silent this time.

Yang Ye chuckled, “I don’t care what destiny I have, and I don’t know anything about it. All I do know is that no matter what type of path we have, we’re on the path, and we have the ability to change everything. Right?”

The masked woman said, “You think that a person decides his or her own destiny, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Perhaps I can’t do it now, but I’ll work hard. I’ll work hard until my strength can surpass it. So, we don’t have to care what type of destiny we have. We should just grow strong incessantly and surpass ourselves without end.”

She fell silent for a long time and nodded, “You’re right. Only the weak submit to destiny. However, that’s a very difficult path.”

Yang Ye replied, “It may be difficult, but I have to!”

The masked woman replied, “Good luck!”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something and said, “You said that three people changed my destiny. Who were they?”

She shook her head slightly, “I don’t know. However, they’re very strong, extremely strong. Especially the last person….” She shook her head and didn’t continue.

Yang Ye nodded and didn’t ask further as well. Because he knew that asking wouldn’t make a difference. She’d said they were very strong, so it was obvious that they weren’t existences he could go against right now.

Yang Ye glanced at her and asked, “Who are you?”

She didn’t answer him. She turned to look at the treant, “Do you know what that is? It’s the medium universe’s Soul of the Earth.”

“The Soul of the Earth!” Yang Ye was stunned and turned to look at the treant, “It’s the Soul of the Earth?”

She nodded slightly, “The reason all of you can’t injure it is because it’s the soul of the earth here. With the energy of the earth to boost and protect it, all of you can’t harm it at all.”

Yang Ye suddenly said, “My sword can pierce through its defenses!”

The masked woman glanced at the wooden sword in Yang Ye’s grasp and said, “That sword is extraordinary. So its ability to pierce that treant’s defenses is not surprising!”

Once she finished speaking, she turned to look at Blood Maiden and the others, “All of you really want to know who I am, right?”

As she spoke, her hand moved up and slowly removed her mask.

As soon as they saw her appearance, all the women here opened their eyes wide, and it didn’t take long for them to bow in unison, “Pavilion Master!”

At this moment, Yang Ye was stunned!

Shao Siyou!

The woman before them was actually the previous pavilion master of the Nether Pavilion, Shao Siyou!

At the same time that he was shocked, he heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. Because it represented that she didn’t have any ill intent towards them. Simply speaking, they were safe now. Moreover, they may have gained the support of someone extraordinarily powerful!

Because she had her back towards Yang Ye, he hadn’t been able to see her appearance, and when he wanted to take a look, she’d already put her mask back on.

Meanwhile, Shao Siyou suddenly said, “This isn’t my main body!”

It isn’t her main body! All of them looked up at her, and there was disbelief in their eyes. Because as far as they were concerned, she wasn’t a soul or an illusion formed from spiritual energy!

Meanwhile, Shao Siyou said, “What you see is just a projection of mine. A projection I left here in the past. You’ll understand once you attain the Enlightened Realm.”

She glanced at Blood Maiden and the others, “The reason I left this projection behind is that I knew all of you would come looking for me.”

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden suddenly said, “Please enlighten us!”

At this point, Yang Ye didn’t really understand what was going on. Or it should be said that he was quite puzzled. Obviously, Blood Maiden and the others weren’t looking for Shao Siyou just to find out where she was.

Shao Siyou nodded slightly, “Actually, I should have told all of you, all those years ago. However, I left in a hurry, causing all of you to be troubled for so many years. It’s time for all of you to find out the truth!”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly asked, “What truth?”

Blood Maiden replied, “There’s a portion of our memories that’s empty. There’s nothing there. If we can’t recall those memories, then we’ll never be able to go above the 6th stage of the True Realm. Just think about it, if a person can’t become ‘enlightened’ about his or herself, how will that person become ‘enlightened’ about everything else?”

“Empty memories?” Yang Ye frowned, “What caused that?”

Blood Maiden gazed at Shao Siyou, “The Pavilion Master should know!”

Shao Siyou fell silent for a short while and said, “For the sake of obtaining even greater strength, I decided to condense my memories into seeds, and then plant them into unborn fetuses in their mother’s wombs. Once they grew up, they would possess a variety of lives, comprehensions, and outstanding strength. At that time, I’ll activate the memory seeds within them and devour them to obtain their lives, comprehensions, and strength!”

It felt like they were struck by a bolt of thunder!

At this moment, Blood Maiden and the others were stunned on the spot!

A memory seed! Shao Siyou’s memory seed was actually within their minds. That wasn’t even the main point. The main point was that the person they respected the most, their pavilion master, had actually taken them in just to use them!

Their world was turned upside down!

Shao Siyou’s revelation had turned their world upside down! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Blood Maiden and the others weren’t the only ones who felt that way, Yang Ye was quite shocked as well. He hadn’t expected the truth to be like this!

Meanwhile, Shao Siyou added, “As I watched all of you grow, day by day; and as I watched all of you become stronger, day by day, I grew even happier than all of you. However, in the end, I changed my decision!”

Blood Maiden asked, “Why?”

Shao Siyou gazed at Blood Maiden, “Can anyone truly be without emotion? I watched all of you grow every day, so when it came time to devour all of you, I realized that it wasn’t what I truly wanted. So, I gave up on it. However, at that time, I didn’t expect that leaving a memory seed in your minds would affect your growth.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “At that time, certain reasons prevented me from returning to Merak System. Thus, I could only leave this projection behind. Once I help all of you extract the memory seed within you, you’ll be a truly complete person, and you won’t encounter any barriers when trying to charge into the Enlightened Realm!”

Everyone here fell silent.

At this moment, Blood Maiden and the others’ had complicated emotions in their hearts. It was extremely complicated. In the beginning, they were filled with hope, then it was disappointment. Now… The emotions they felt were difficult to describe with words.

Suddenly, Shao Siyou gazed at Yang Ye, “Kid, there’s a memory seed in your brain too!”

Yang Ye was instantly stunned on the spot, “How can that be possible?!”
