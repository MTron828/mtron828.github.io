Chapter 1632 - An Nanjing’s Strength!

Translator: InVader

The two figures were Yang Ye and the Blood Puppet, and the blood red arm that flew off belonged to the Blood Puppet!

Not only had Yang Ye been unable to stop that attack, even the Blood Puppet couldn’t. It had even lost an arm!

After it struck both Yang Ye and the Blood Puppet back, the wooden sword seemed to have no intention to stop. Light flickered on its tip, and it was about to attack again.

Meanwhile, Snowy shuddered, and then she flew over to the back of the wooden sword and wrapped her claws tightly around its hilt.

The wooden sword gradually calmed down upon being embraced by Snowy. But light was still flickering on its tip. Obviously, it was still angry.

Yang Ye was quite stunned, very stunned actually.

Because he hadn’t expected the wooden sword to be that terrifying!

Is that really just a wooden sword?

After all, the Blood Puppet’s strength far surpassed ordinary Zenith Realm experts. However, even it hadn’t been able to stop that attack!

If he’d resisted it on his own earlier, then he may have lost more than just an arm!

Zi’er appeared by Yang Ye’s side and spoke softly, “Are you alright?”

Yang Ye shook his head and looked off into the distance. The wooden sword had practically fully calmed down, and the light on its tip had dispersed.

Zi’er spoke softly, “There’s something strange about that sword!”

Yang Ye nodded. Because it wasn’t just strange, it was terrifying! Ordinary Zenith Realm experts were probably nothing before it! Just a sword was stronger than Zenith Realm experts… It sounded quite inconceivable indeed!

So, now there was a problem.

It was so strong, and it had such a hot temper. So, how would he make it usable to him?

Rely on the Primordial Pagoda?

The Primordial Pagoda could suppress it, but what about once he left the pagoda? Without the pagoda there to help him suppress it, and it suddenly attacked him, then he would probably be unable to defend himself.

But would the wooden sword willingly allow him to use it?

Yang Ye shook his head and rejected that thought. It had such a hot temper, so he could only dream of it willingly allowing him to use it. At the very least, there was no hope for now.

Zi’er spoke softly, “What should we do now?”

What should we do?

Yang Ye looked off into the distance. The wooden sword had calmed down completely.

His gaze gradually became solemn as he gazed at the wooden sword. Obviously, its origins were absolutely extraordinary. Moreover, the Wu Clan’s Grand Elder had said that he would have to shoulder some sort of responsibility if he took the wooden sword!

Yang Ye hadn’t really cared about that responsibility. Yet now, he knew that it was probably extremely troublesome and difficult to deal with.

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time before he shook his head, and he stopped thinking about things that still hadn’t occurred. He glanced at Snowy who was flying around with the wooden sword again, and a wisp of regret flashed through his eyes. If he could use it, then killing Zenith Realm experts would be like cutting through vegetables for him!

Unfortunately, it refused to let him even touch it!

Actually, he was still confident in his ability to suppress it because he had the Primordial Pagoda and Sword Domain. However, he didn’t really want to use force against it. Because his sword was his most trusted companion in battle. If it suddenly turned on him in battle, then he would be finished.

Yang Ye gazed at the wooden sword for a long time, and then he said, “I’ll be back. You won’t dare to treat me like this when I come back!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and vanished on the spot.

In the outside world, Yang Ye opened his eyes slowly. He glanced at the surroundings, and then he vanished on the spot.

Outside the room.

“You succeeded?” A voice resounded in his ears as soon as he left the room. He turned to look, and he saw an old man had suddenly appeared not too far away on his right, and it was the Wu Clan’s Grand Elder!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I have.”

The Grand Elder took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, and shock flashed deep within his eyes.

Less than half a month!

If he hadn’t witnessed it himself, he would absolutely not believe that someone could attain the Rebirth Realm in half a month. Because even the ancestor of the Wu Clan, the Martial Ancestor Wu Mu, had used a month to accomplish that!

But this young master of the Yang Clan had actually used less than half a month!

Half a month!

The Grand Elder remained silent for a while, and his eyes drooped. A wisp of killing intent flashed through his eyes. Even though the Wu Clan wasn’t enemies with the Yang Clan, he didn’t want the Yang Clan to have such a peerless genius. Because that wasn’t just disadvantageous to the other clans, it was disadvantageous to the Wu Clan too.

Because once the Wu Clan became enemies with the Yang Clan, and the Yang Clan had such a genius, then Yang Ye would be a disaster for his Wu Clan in the future.

But it didn’t take long for him to discard that intent to kill and gaze at Yang Ye with a smile on his face, “Congratulations!”

He didn’t ponder for long before choosing to draw Yang Ye over to his side. Because the price of attacking Yang Ye would be too huge. Firstly, the Yang Clan would definitely not let the matter rest. Perhaps it wouldn’t launch a full scale war against the Wu Clan, but it would slaughter the Wu Clan’s younger generation.

Secondly, he knew that An Nanjing was very close to this young master of the Yang Clan. If he attacked Yang Ye, then even if An Nanjing didn’t attack the Wu Clan, she would definitely become hostile towards it. In short, the harm outweighed the benefits of attacking Yang Ye!

Yang Ye glanced at the Grand Elder, “Thank you. Please take me to see my wife.”

“She wants to see you too! Come with me!” As soon as he finished speaking, the Grand Elder vanished off into the distance.

Yang Ye tapped his right foot against the ground and transformed into a ray of black light that followed after the old man.

The Training Grounds.

It was where the disciples of the Wu Clan sparred and competed. It was boundless, and the space here was even strengthened by a few dozen formations. Besides that, the mysterious energy of experts above the Zenith Realm was strengthening the area. It could be said that even the full strength of a Zenith Realm expert couldn’t harm the space here.

There were only two people here. Yang Ye and An Nanjing.

She asked, “You’ve attained the Rebirth Realm?”

Yang Ye nodded, “What about you?”

She replied, “Not yet, but it won’t take long.”

Yang Ye was stunned.

An Nanjing flipped her palm, and Skysplit appeared in her grasp, “Let’s fight for real?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Alright.”

He’d just advanced to the Rebirth Realm, so he wanted to spar with someone too, so that he could determine the extent of his strengths.

It was the same for An Nanjing. She’d received the Martial God’s inheritance and studied the experiences of the Wu Clan’s Martial Ancestor. Now, her overall strength had improved tremendously, so she needed someone to spar with.

An Nanjing was about to attack when Yang Ye suddenly looked off into the distance, “Grand Elder, can you keep this a secret?”

A moment of silence ensued, and then the Grand Elder’s voice came from afar, “Don’t worry, not another soul will hear about your spar.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he gazed at An Nanjing, “I’m going to fight seriously.”

She nodded slightly, “Me too!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she looked up at Yang Ye, and then a ray of golden light appeared abruptly in front of Yang Ye.

Om!

A sword howl shot up into the air, and then a ray of light slashed against the golden light.

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and then both the rays of light exploded apart. After that, a terrifying wave of energy instantly swept towards the surroundings.

Meanwhile, a ray of light from a spear shot out from the left. Everywhere it passed, the wave of energy was torn open like paper. At the same time, a ray of sword energy shot over from the right, and the wave of energy before it was obliterated.

Just like that, both of them collided in the most violent manner.

Bang!

As soon as they came into contact, it sounded like a thunderclap had erupted there. The ground and space there shook violently, and then both the attacks exploded into bits. As for the energy that erupted from the point of collision, it instantly transformed into waves that swept incessantly towards the surroundings.

However, the waves of energy were obliterated by a layer of invisible force when they arrived in front of Yang Ye and An Nanjing. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

They exchanged glances, and then they vanished on the spot.

Clang!

A clear and resounding sound of metal colliding arose. Yang Ye and An Nanjing were just around a meter away from each other. Her spear was right in front of his face, but it had been stopped by his sword.

A moment of silence ensued, and then An Nanjing suddenly released her spear and charged forward. She instantly arrived in front of Yang Ye before slamming her fist forward. It was swift like a bolt of lightning.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly at the sight of this, and he immediately swung his sword downwards.

Right when he swung his sword, An Nanjing stretched out her left hand, grabbed Skysplit, and stabbed it forward. It shot straight for Yang Ye’s face again.

Yang Ye was shocked. His sword that was descending towards An Nanjing’s fist was quickly changed into an angled flick.

Clang!

His sword stopped her spear, but An Nanjing’s fist slammed against his chest. As soon as her fist came into contact with his chest, she unfurled it and struck him.

Boom!

A muffled explosion resounded as Yang Ye was blasted around 3km away. As soon as he stopped himself, a wisp of scarlet red seeped out from the corner of his mouth. At the same time, his chest had caved in.

Yang Ye wiped off the blood and gazed at An Nanjing, “Nice strategy!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a strand of intent suddenly surged out from within him.

Slaughter Sword Intent!

An Nanjing nodded slightly, “Let’s fight with our true strength!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she took a step forward. In an instant, a strand of terrifying intent surged out from her.

Yang Ye’s expression changed when he saw it.

At the same time, a shocked voice resounded, “Six types of intents… Six types of Returnal Rank intents… Six types of Returnal Rank intents that are merged together…”

As the voice finished speaking, it actually started to tremble.
