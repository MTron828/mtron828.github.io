Chapter 1762 - Declaration Of War!

I want to run!

Yang Ye wasn’t joking. He really did want to run right now.

A 6th stage True Realm expert!

Even though he’d destroyed the body of a 6th stage True Realm expert with just a swing of his sword, he’d been at his absolute limit at the time. Yet now, he didn’t dare to use all his trump cards. Because this was the Ying Clan’s territory. Besides that 6th stage True Realm expert, there were many other True Realm experts!

Moreover, if they refused to go head-on against him once he revealed all his trump cards, then he would be helpless against them as well.

Simply speaking, he wasn’t confident in killing this 6th stage True Realm expert after using all his trump cards. Moreover, he was in the Ying Clan’s territory. So, it was obvious what would happen once he was exhausted…

Flee!

He had to flee!

However, it was clearly quite difficult to flee right now!

“How surprising!” Meanwhile, the white haired old man spoke abruptly, “Two peerless geniuses have appeared in the Yang Clan. Many years ago, the Yang Clan had that fellow, Yang Wudi. Now, it has both of you. Haha! The heavens are truly kind to your Yang Clan!”

Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang exchanged glances. In the end, Yang Lianshuang gazed at the white haired old man, “I’m quite surprised. I didn’t expect an old geezer like you to show himself!”

Ying Qing spoke abruptly, “I disturbed my ancestor because I didn’t want to give both of you any chances. Yang Ye, Yang Lianshuang, the reason you dared to come here is none other than because you thought my Ying Clan’s patriarch won’t show himself easily. Unfortunately, we won’t let you get what you want. Because we’ve never underestimated both of you. My Ying Clan treats both of you as a true 6th stage True Realm expert!”

“I’m really honored!” Yang Lianshuang continued, “But isn’t your Ying Clan afraid of losing a 6th stage True Realm expert?”

The white haired old man suddenly said, “Why don’t you try?”

Yang Lianshuang gazed at Yang Ye. Their eyes met, and then they simultaneously vanished on the spot. At the exact same instant, the old man suddenly stretched out his right hand. In an instant, a ray of dazzling white light surged out from his palm!

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded, and then the white haired old man was pushed over 100m back. As for Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang, they were pushed over 300m back!

Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang were clearly at a disadvantage during this collision. However, the white haired old man and Ying Qing had extremely solemn expressions on their faces.

The fact that Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang had destroyed Yang Xiang’s physical body was no secret in the medium universe. However, they’d only heard about it, and they hadn’t witnessed it for themselves. So, they didn’t have an accurate idea of Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang’s strength.

Now, they did.

Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang’s joint forces were really capable of fighting a 6th stage True Realm expert!

At this moment, Ying Qing was quite afraid. He wasn’t afraid of them right now; he was afraid of their strength in the future.

Once they were allowed to grow, then even the Ying Clan would have to tremble before them!

They can’t be allowed to grow further!

As soon as he thought up to this point, Ying Qing waved his right hand. In an instant, a few dozen figures shot up into the air from within Heaven Desolation City. It didn’t take long for around 30 True Realm experts to appear around Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang. Moreover, the weakest amongst them was at the 3rd stage of the True Realm!

They didn’t intend to give Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang a chance!

If they didn’t die, the Ying Clan would never be able to sleep in peace!

Even if there was no enmity between the Ying Clan and both Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang, they would still not allow Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang to grow.

They were a threat!

If they grew further, they would threaten the Ying Clan’s position as overlord of the medium universe.

Yang Ye’s face fell when he witnessed this scene. After all, with so many experts here, he couldn’t fight them even if he had three heads and six arms!

If it was a one on one battle, then he could even fight the white haired old man on his own. Yet now, they clearly intended to gang up on him and Yang Lianshuang!

A moment of silence ensued, and then Ying Qing suddenly waved his right hand, “Attack together!”

As soon as he gave the order, those True Realm experts around Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang shot towards them.

At the same time, Ying Qing gazed at the white haired old man, “Ancestor, please lend them a hand!”

The white haired old man pondered deeply for a moment and nodded. He was about to attack when Yang Lianshuang suddenly took a step forward, and then an absolutely terrifying aura swept out from her. After that, two huge wings that blotted out the sky appeared behind her!

The wings of the black phoenix!

Yang Lianshuang didn’t waste her breath. She grabbed Yang Ye’s shoulder with her right hand, and then her wings flapped. The space in a huge area around her instantly warped and trembled, and then both of them vanished on the spot.

“You’re not going anywhere!” The white haired old man’s voice resounded, and then a huge palm suddenly shot through the air and clawed at them in the starry sky above.

Om!

Suddenly, an ear piercing sword howl resounded, and then the entire sky trembled violently while the huge palm cracked apart.

It didn’t take long for the surroundings to become calm once more.

However, the white haired old man had an extremely unsightly expression on his face.

They’d escaped!

Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang had actually escaped right before his eyes!

The white haired old man wasn’t the only one with an unsightly expression on his face, the other experts from the Ying Clan had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces too. Obviously, once word of this spread, it would be a huge blow to the Ying Clan’s reputation.

That wasn’t even the main point. The main point was that they’d witnessed how terrifying those two geniuses of the Yang Clan were. Presently, one of them was at the True Realm while the other was at the Zenith Realm. Once they grew, one could only imagine how terrifying they would become!

A long period of silence filled the surroundings, and then the white haired old man suddenly said, “Invite the Li Clan, Wang Clan, Lu Clan, and Qin Clan’s patriarchs to Heaven Desolation City. Tell them my Ying Clan has something to discuss with them.”

Ying Qing nodded, and then he vanished on the spot.

The white haired old man looked up into the boundless starry sky. He fell silent for a long time before he spoke softly, “There are extraordinary people in every generation…”

…

Not long later, the news of what happened in Heaven Desolation City swept through the entire medium universe.

The entire medium universe was shocked.

The Ying Clan was the overlord of the medium universe, and nothing had ever happened to Heaven Desolation City for hundreds of years. Or it should be said that it had been years since a person or power had dared to provoke the Ying Clan.

Yet now, Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang had gone to Heaven Desolation City, and they hadn’t just killed a few True Realm experts of the Ying Clan, they’d even destroyed the city.

Especially those words Yang Ye left behind — Rebuild it if you have the balls! I’ll be back tomorrow!

It was an utterly direct insult to the Ying Clan!

The Ying Clan had lost face tremendously, and both Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang’s reputations skyrocketed.

At this moment, those geniuses on the Milky Way Rankings were nothing before Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang!

Moreover, because of the incident in Heaven Desolation City, the other clans had gone quiet. None of them continued their occupation of the Yang Clan’s worlds. Obviously, Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang placed a tremendous amount of pressure on them!

…

At a deathly silent expanse of space, a ray of black light flashed by, and then two people appeared there.

It was Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang.

Yang Ye gazed at yang Lianshuang and asked, “Are you alright?”

Yang Lianshuang was unusually pale.

She shook her head slightly, “It’s not a huge problem. My speed just surpassed the limits of my body, so I feel a little uncomfortable. Fortunately, he didn’t pursue us all the way or I wouldn’t have been able to persist for long.”

Yang Ye said, “You’re really fast!”

Yang Lianshuang’s speed had surpassed his own just now, and she’d surpassed it by a wide margin!

Yang Lianshuang shook her head, “That speed of mine isn’t my own. I relied on the Undying Black Phoenix’s energy to attain such speed. But your speed is your own true speed. The difference between them is huge.”

Yang Ye sized up Yang Lianshuang, “The Undying Black Phoenix, is it within you?”

She fell silent for a moment and shook her head, “It’s dead.”

“Dead?” A wisp of surprise flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes. Because he’d always thought that it was within her.

She nodded, “She was on the verge of death when I met her. Because I made a deal with her, she willingly allowed me to absorb her energy.”

So that’s why! Yang Ye nodded. He was about to speak when she suddenly asked, “You’ve attained the True Realm?”

Yang Ye was stunned and asked, “How did you know?”

Actually, he’d attained the True Realm when he emerged from his closed door cultivation. However, he’d concealed his cultivation. When he’s at the Zenith Realm, those clans would treat him like a Zenith Realm expert; but if he was at the True Realm, it was obvious that those clans would send an even more shocking array of experts to deal with him.

Simply speaking, he was feigning weakness to crush his enemies!

Yang Lianshuang replied, “It’s just a feeling. Even though you’ve concealed your cultivation, you feel different. Especially when you fought that 6th stage True Realm expert from the Ying Clan. You accomplished it with ease. So, I guessed that you’ve attained the True Realm!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I still can’t defeat a 6th stage True Realm expert!”

He wasn’t being modest. If he fought a 6th stage True Realm expert in a fair fight, then he wasn’t certain that he could defeat such an expert. After all, the reason he’d been able to destroy Yang Xiang’s body with just one attack had been because he’d joined forces with Yang Lianshuang and heavily injured Yang Xiang.

It could be said that Yang Xiang was heavily injured when he faced that attack from Yang Ye.

So, it wasn’t just his accomplishment because Yang Lianshuang had contributed too.

He knew his own strength well. If a person couldn’t recognize his own strength well, it would be extremely dangerous for that person.

Yang Lianshuang smiled, “There’s no rush. We’re still young, and our youth is our advantage!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Yang Lianshuang frowned. It didn’t take long for her face to become gloomy.

Yang Ye asked, “What’s wrong?”

She gazed at him and replied, “The Ying Clan, Li Clan, Wang Clan, Lu Clan, and Qin Clan have declared war against us.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “That’s very normal.”

“There’s one more thing!” She continued, “They’ve jointly issued a bounty.”

Yang Ye asked, “On me?”

She shook her head, “On your wives and loved ones. A True Rank treasure for each of their lives!”

Yang Ye’s face immediately turned gloomy.
