Chapter 1576 - Did I Use Sword Intent?

Translator: InVader

Was the Sword of Rebirth strong?

As far as Yang Ye was concerned, it was extremely strong, and he really admired the sword cultivator who’d created it. However, he hadn’t expected that person to be standing in front of him.

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and asked, “Aren’t you dead?”

She replied, “The old me is dead. Now, my life belongs to Master.”

Her Master?! Yang Ye slowly clenched his fists. Who is that person to actually be able to make her acknowledge him or her as her master?!

Meanwhile, the woman said, “I left that technique in a secret chamber with the hopes that someone would have the luck to obtain it. I didn’t expect it to fall into your hands.”

A secret chamber? Yang Ye frowned. It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to gain a rough understanding of the situation. She wasn’t that old man’s friend, and the old man had probably obtained the sword technique by chance.

She continued, “I’ve fought both the Unfettered One and Jian Wuji. Come, draw your sword and let me see what level your attainments in the Sword Dao are at.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while and said, “Alright. I wanted to fight a strong sword cultivator as well. I’ll finally be able to get my wish today.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was in front of her when his figure appeared once more. A moment later, he drew his sword and swung it swiftly!

Five overlapped Heavenrends!

The space in front of Yang Ye instantly cracked apart.

The woman’s expression remained calm and indifferent. When his attack arrived around 10cm away from her, she just launched an upward stab with her sword.

Bang!

A wave of energy erupted from the point of collision. But it didn’t take long for the wave of energy to be obliterated by Yang Ye’s sword intent.

At this moment, her sword was pushing against Yang Ye’s sword, so his sword couldn’t descend even an inch further.

Meanwhile, the woman suddenly shook her hand, and then the Sword Precursor in Yang Ye’s grasp instantly started trembling violently. In an instant, Yang Ye was blasted over 300m away.

At the same time, she vanished on the spot, and she was in front of Yang Ye when her figure appeared once more. After that, she stabbed her sword forward.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he launched a forward stab as well. However, his sword wasn’t moving to stop her attack, and it was stabbing towards her chest.

The woman frowned slightly, and then she twisted her wrist. Her sword’s trajectory curved and struck the body of Yang Ye’s sword, causing Yang Ye’s sword to be instantly pushed away. Meanwhile, her sword moved forward along his sword and swept towards his chest. However, Yang Ye still didn’t try to stop it and similarly executed an angled slash at her.

Right when their swords were about to strike each other, the woman suddenly withdrew her sword and swiftly retreated around 30m away. After that, she waved her hand lightly. In an instant, her sword appeared above Yang Ye, and then a sword lotus appeared in the air above Yang Ye.

Bang! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The sword lotus instantly exploded apart, and then countless strands of sword energy rained down and enveloped Yang Ye.

A moment of silence ensued, and then an explosion resounded. Countless strands of sword energy shot up into the sky, but the sword energy from the lotus didn’t vanish. Conversely, they started lining up in an extremely orderly manner, and then they descended towards Yang Ye again.

Yang Ye was ceaselessly swinging the Sword Precursor, and numerous strands of sword energy surged incessantly and collided with the sword energy above Yang Ye.

Sword energy was crisscrossing and colliding incessantly, causing space to be riddled with holes. It was an extremely shocking sight.

A long time passed before all the sword energy vanished. At this moment, Yang Ye was completely covered in blood. His body was covered in injuries from sword energy, and every single one was ceaselessly bleeding.

Meanwhile, the woman spoke abruptly, “I once killed a Rebirth Realm expert in an instant with that technique.”

Yang Ye nodded, “It’s very strong indeed. I almost failed to stop it.”

“Dual cultivating in the sword and body!” She spoke solemnly, “Needless to say, you’re really strong. Regardless of whether it’s your body or your attainments in the Sword Dao. Unfortunately, you’re too young. Your cultivation is too low, and both your attainments in the Sword Dao and sword intent haven’t been consolidated. Of course, it’s normal. After all, you’re still so young. If you’re given enough time… Unfortunately, you may not have that time!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she swung her sword at Yang Ye from afar. A crescent shaped sword energy tore through the air. Once the crescent of sword energy arrived around 3m away from Yang Ye, it suddenly shook violently, and then it actually transformed into ten crescents of sword energy. The ten crescents of sword energy started spinning as they shot towards Yang Ye from various different angles.

Even though they were striking Yang Ye from various different angles, they were striking in succession. If one allowed them to come together, one would notice that they actually formed a lotus flower!

The attack was simply impossible to dodge, so Yang Ye could only go head-on against it!

Suddenly, a strand of terrifying sword intent and slaughter intent surged out from Yang Ye, and then he drew his sword and swung it!

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded, and then countless strands of sword energy started shooting madly towards the surroundings. Every single one of them tore space apart. In the blink of an eye, space was riddled with holes.

A long time passed before everything returned to normal.

At this moment, Yang Ye was covered in blood again!

The sword energy was able to pierce through his physical defenses!

The woman turned to look at the man by her side, “Let’s go!”

The man nodded slightly, and then he was about to capture An Nanjing. However, Yang Ye suddenly said, “It’s not over yet.”

She gazed at him, “I know that you possess the Sword Domain. But did you see me using sword intent?”

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted. At this moment, he realized that up until this point in the battle, the woman hadn’t utilized sword intent at all! The Sword Domain could suppress sword intent, but she didn’t use sword intent at all!

So, how could he suppress her?

She looked him in the eyes, “Master said it’s not time for you to die. So, you don’t have to die right now.”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was in front of her when he appeared once more. A moment later, he suddenly drew his sword and swung it.

The woman frowned slightly while a wisp of the intent to kill flashed through her eyes. At the same time, she swung her sword.

This time, Yang Ye didn’t dodge, and he once again fought without any regard for his life. The woman’s strength surpassed his own, but her body definitely wasn’t stronger than his. His sword could kill her with a single strike, but she probably wasn’t capable of piercing through his defenses and killing him with just one attack.

Clang!

The woman pushed Yang Ye back and created distance between them. She naturally refused to fight Yang Ye at close quarters. Yang Ye wasn’t just a sword cultivator, he was a body cultivator too!

After creating space between them, she created more sword energy, and they shot forward in succession and drowned Yang Ye beneath them.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Numerous explosions resounded. The space here instantly started trembling incessantly, and it seemed like it was on the verge of collapse. It was an extremely shocking sight.

It didn’t take long for the sword energy to disperse and Yang Ye to appear before everyone again. At this moment, he seemed completely fine because there was a casket lid in front of him!

The casket lid!

Yang Ye had suddenly realized that he had no reason to purely fight her with the sword! Fairness? If she suppressed her cultivation to the Deity Realm and fought him, then he would be willing to fight her with just the sword. However, she was a peak Rebirth Realm expert! But he was just a Deity!

If he were to compete solely with the sword against her, then wouldn’t he be courting death?

So, Yang Ye had decisively utilized the casket lid!

The sword energy was completely stopped by the casket lid. Even though the aftershock still struck him, it was no different than a scratch to him!

The woman gazed at the casket lid for some time, and then she said, “What an amazing treasure!”

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath. His figure vanished on the spot, and he was in front of the woman when he appeared once more. After that, he launched a forward stab just like he’d done previously.

His current objective was very simple, and it was to fight her in close quarters. He wanted her to engage in a struggle of life and death with him. His body was stronger than hers, so he couldn’t afford to do that. However, she couldn’t afford to do that. So long as she created space between them, he would use the casket lid. Because he had no need to fear her ranged attacks while he had the casket lid!

The situation had instantly taken a complete 180 degree turn once Yang Ye used the casket lid. Of course, he wasn’t able to gain the upper hand. After all, the gap in their strengths was still present. However, the woman wasn’t able to gain the upper hand either.

Just like that, they fell into a stalemate!

An Nanjing and the young man who were watching the battle had quite unsightly expressions on their faces. An Nanjing was worried because Yang Ye would definitely be unable to hold on if the battle continued like this. How could a Deity win in a battle of attrition against a Rebirth Realm expert? Moreover, the young man with a saber was standing at the side!

Bang!

Suddenly, an explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was blasted around 3km away.

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted slightly because the woman’s attack was at least five times stronger than it had been. If he hadn’t raised the casket lid in time, he may have been killed by that attack! Moreover, there was a ten centimeter deep mark on the casket lid!

The casket lid which had always remained unharmed had been cut open. Even though it hadn’t gone through the casket lid, it was sufficient to prove how terrifying her attack had been!

At this moment, the woman had quite an unsightly expression on her face. She’d thought that dealing with Yang Ye would be an extremely easy task for her. After all, Yang Ye was only a Deity. However, after fighting him for a while, she’d realized that Yang Ye was much stronger than she’d imagined. Especially when he had so many treasures.

“Don’t waste time!” Suddenly, the young man spoke, “Master will be unhappy if we’re late. Finish him swiftly. I’ll capture her.” As he spoke, he turned and charged towards An Nanjing.

The woman looked Yang Ye in the eye and said, “It’s over!”

As soon as she finished speaking, her sword suddenly shook violently. As it shook violently, the space around her actually started trembling violently as well.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. What the hell is she doing?Suddenly, a voice resounded, “Aren’t you ashamed of bullying two juniors like that? You’re really going from bad to worse!”

Yang Ye was stunned when he heard this voice, and then he was overjoyed.
