Chapter 2638 – Congratulations!

Speechless!

What the woman in white said had completely overturned his knowledge and understanding of Destiny.

In the beginning, he felt that Destiny was the so-called Heaven Dao of the world. But now it seemed like it wasn’t the case at all.

She was the one who destroyed the Heaven Dao!

Of course, he wasn’t sure if she was even human.

Meanwhile, the woman smiled, “If someone entered Four Dimensional Space now and mastered its strength, that person would act just like the Heaven Dao of the past. That person will use all things to gain more power. At that time, your life would be worthless to such a person. Moreover, that person would be matchlessly powerful to the point of eliminating you with ease. Do you think that’s good?”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “There are no absolutes, right?”

She smiled, “You’re very right.”

Yang Ye was delighted because this form of Destiny was very open-minded!

The woman added, “There are no absolutes, I think so too. However, the other forms of me aren’t of the same mind.”

She patted him lightly, “Don’t meet the other forms of me. Because they will never reason with you.”

Yang Ye asked, “Are you talking about the woman in black?”

“The woman in black?” The woman in white was stunned for a moment and smiled, “If you meet the other two forms of me, you’ll realize that she’s actually not that bad.”

Yang Ye wanted to get more answers, but she shook her head, “I told you all of that because I think that it should come to an end soon. As for everything else, don’t ask about that. Because you’ll find out soon enough.”

She suddenly gazed at Yang Ye’s stomach, and then she waved her hand. A book appeared in her grasp.

She flipped through it and smiled, “Very interesting indeed.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She smiled, “The one who wrote this is interesting. I’m a little curious, I should have heard about all extraordinary people since the ancient times, but this person…”

Yang Ye humbly sought knowledge and asked, “Can you tell me about it?”

The woman smiled, “There’s always a chance to escape the plans of the Heaven Dao. That statement refers to the principles of the world, the Laws of the Grand Dao, and me.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “You’re that one that escaped?”

She nodded, “Everything in the Three Dimensional Space is ineffective against me, so of course I am.”

She flipped through a few more pages and nodded slightly, “The person who wrote this understands some of the truth of all things in the universe. It’s truly extraordinary.”

She passed the book back to Yang Ye and said, “You can learn from this. It’s beneficial to you!”

Yang Ye put it away and glanced at her, “I heard from Little Qi that the woman in black isn’t your strongest form. Is that true?”

“Qi Bitian?” She grinned, “Since the ancient times, she’s one of the very formidable existences. The Qi Bitian you’ve seen now isn’t even at 30% of her peak strength. If she wasn’t afraid of the other two forms of mine, the woman in black you spoke about wouldn’t have been able to be a match for her.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “Are the other two forms of you very formidable?”

She nodded slightly, “Very formidable.”

Yang Ye pursued an answer, “How formidable?”

The woman grinned, “Besides barely losing to the Heaven Dao of all those years ago, the original owner of that sword in your grasp has never lost a battle.”

Yang Ye unconsciously asked, “What about in comparison to that sword cultivator?”

Yang Ye was naturally referring to the Unfettered One!

The sword cultivator who was traveling the world in search of defeat!

She shook her head and smiled, “Do you know why he’s strong?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

She smiled, “He abandoned everything. He once had loved ones, friends, and ties, just like you. However, he abandoned it all. He cut off all ties, and he severed all thoughts but the sword in his heart. He has cultivated the sword to its limits, and he really can destroy all things with a single swing of the sword. He can even break Three Dimensional Space.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Actually, you can do the same too. So long as you give up everything in that pagoda of yours, abandon that little fellow called Snowy, abandon the Evil Beast, Erya, and abandon everything else, your sword can become extremely pure too.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Can I not accomplish that without abandoning all of them?”

She smiled, “Of course you can. However, his path is easier. Giving up is always easier than putting things on your shoulders.”

She looked toward the distant river, “Do you know why I didn’t kill the Desolate Emperor all those years ago?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

The woman in white smiled, “All those years ago, I felt he did it for the desolate race, so I spared him. Unfortunately, that was not true. Selfish desires! At most times, the stronger a person was, the more selfish that person would become. As the years go by, they only care about themselves, and it was the same for the Desolate Emperor. The true reason why he used the desolate race to attack Eternal Kingdom was just for his own sake.”

She patted Yang Ye lightly on the shoulder, “In the beginning, I didn’t really understand why the Sprite Progenitor and Evil Beast were staying with you, and I didn’t understand why Qi Bitian took care of you quite a bit. After observing you in secret, I realized that you’re a pretty good person. Because since the very beginning, the people you care about have always been more important than yourself.”

She turned around and walked away once she finished speaking.

Once she left, the Eternal Border was completely restored!

Moreover, because of Snowy’s help, the spirit energy here was much denser than before.

However, Eternal Kingdom’s spirit energy was much scarcer now.

The battle just now had impacted Eternal Kingdom tremendously.

Yang Ye held Snowy in his arms as he looked up into the sky.

The Desolate Emperor was gone!

Needless to say, he was an overlord of a generation, and an extraordinary expert too.

However, just as the woman had said, he was absolutely willful when he possessed such strength. He was willing to just casually wipe out Eternal Border, and the reason may just be because he wanted to do it. Moreover, if he took over Eternal Kingdom, the living beings of the entire universe may just be insignificant as ants to him.

The strong did as they pleased!

There was no limit to this statement because no one knew how selfishly an expert would act!

Even though Yang Ye wasn’t a good person, he would never slaughter a world in order to enter Four Dimensional Space. Of course, if anyone dared to harm his loved ones, then it didn’t matter how many he had to kill, he wouldn’t show any mercy or hesitation.

Yang Ye left with Snowy in his arms.

Meanwhile, the woman walked along the Eternal River. She was walking very slowly, and her sword was just floating by the river.

There were countless corpses beneath the river, and there were countless vengeful spirits here too.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

However, as her sword passed by, all of them vanished.

She continued walking all along the river.

It didn’t take long for her to suddenly stop. There was an old man in front of her!

An old man with a bamboo chest on his back!

She grinned, and the old man said, “You really think highly of him.”

She replied, “Don’t you too?”

The old man fell silent for a moment and said, “I once thought the Desolate Emperor was the most suitable. Unfortunately, his objective was Four Dimensional Space and going above the Destiny Realm.”

She smiled, “It’s very normal. Everyone has their own selfish desires.”

The old man said, “He’s human too!”

She said, “He’s a loyal person who regards his loved ones as more important than himself. I believe that he’ll be good to this world.”

The old man smiled, “He’s someone who attained the Destiny Realm in slaughter intent.”

She grinned, “It was born from love and emotions. This world cannot be overseen by a purely good person because someone like that cannot manage all things in this universe. Some deserve death. Of course, a purely bad person won’t work either. Selfish people will only lead the Three Dimensional Universe to its death. He kills, but not wantonly; he’s loyal, but not pedantic. Most importantly, he had his limits, and he doesn’t care about the Four Dimensional Universe.”

She gazed at the old man, “The Three Dimensional Universe our generation risked our lives to save can’t be allowed to be destroyed in the hands of those that come after us.”

She gazed at the distant Eternal Kingdom and continued, “I choose him.”

The old man fell silent for a long time and said, “No wonder you gave him some guidance just now. But the other three forms of you…”

She spoke softly, “I hope he doesn’t encounter them…”

The old man spoke solemnly, “What if he does?”

She shook her head slightly, “Then I wish him good luck. I’m sure you know that two of me cannot appear at the same time. After all, this dimension cannot endure the presence of two of me simultaneously present here…”

Her figure gradually turned ethereal.

The old man sighed softly and vanished into the distance.

Eternal Kingdom.

Presently, Eternal Kingdom could be said to be filled with celebration.

Eternal Kingdom had won!

The Desolate Emperor was dead, and the Eternal Kingdom’s biggest threat was gone.

The Ancient Sword Sect.

After he bade farewell to the woman in white, Yang Ye returned to the Ancient Sword Sect.

He sat on the peak of the mountain with a book on his lap.

Yang Ye closed his eyes and sensed the world around him.

Countless strands of slaughter intent and sword intent suffused the area around him, and it didn’t take long for the entire Ancient Sword Sect to be covered in sword intent and slaughter intent.

In the beginning, the disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect felt very uncomfortable because it was too, too strong!

So, the disciples of the sect started to resist his slaughter and sword intent with their own sword intent.

However, as time passed, Yang Ye’s sword and slaughter intent changed.

The sword intent wasn’t aggressive anymore, and neither was the slaughter intent.

Around two weeks passed like this. Now, Yang Ye’s slaughter intent and sword intent were still present, but the disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect couldn’t sense them anymore.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Sword Scroll grinned, “Congratulations.”
