Chapter 549 – The Ninth Rank of the Monarch Realm!

“Heavenrend! Drawing! Technique!”

Crack!

At the moment Void Flash left the ancient sheath, it actually cracked apart and countless fine cracks spread like spiderwebs throughout it. At the same time, numerous mountains over 3km away were instantly blasted apart while around 10km of the ground around Yang Ye sank down by over 100m, and it was still sinking at a visible speed!

When Void Flash left the ancient sheath, Yang Ye held it in both hands as he slashed swiftly towards the nine colored divine dragon in midair!

Bang!

Void Flash exploded apart, and it transformed into countless fine pierces that shot towards the surroundings.

On the other hand, a strand of snow white sword energy immediately flashed out from Void Flash at the instant it exploded apart. In the beginning, the snow white sword energy was only as wide as a person’s arm, but it wasn’t long before it grew larger and larger while everyone watched with shock in their eyes. In just less than 2 breaths of time, the snow white sword energy had transformed into an enormous beam of sword energy that was over 3km long and 300m wide!

The white colored sword energy shot straight up into the sky. Everywhere it passed, space was immediately slashed apart and transformed into powder, and a spatial rift was formed in its wake.

The spectators watched as the white sword energy smashed against the nine colored divine dragon!

Bang!

An enormous explosion resounded through the sky as countless bolts of lightning and strands of sword energy shot towards the surroundings. Besides that wave after wave of energy shot down incessantly from the sky. The space throughout the sky was trembling violently, and it seemed like it would shatter at any moment!

Everyone was looking up into the sky right now!

Bang!

Suddenly, a thunderclap resounded from within the waves of energy, and that thunderclap actually carried a painful tone. After that, the white colored sword energy flashed out from within the waves of energy, but it was practically half the size of its former self!

After that, the white sword energy shot through the pillar of lightning which connected the heavens and the earth!

Bang!

A huge gap was instantly cut open on the pillar of lightning, and then it transformed into countless arcs of electricity that scattered down from the sky!

That wasn’t the end of it. The spectators watched with astonishment as the white sword energy shot into the skin, and then an explosion resounded as the entire world trembled violently!

Everyone was dumbstruck!

Even those supreme experts who were standing high above the clouds revealed disbelief on their faces. They were all existences who’d experienced Heavenly Tribulation in the past. Even though it wasn’t a threat to them anymore, they’d almost died as they resisted it at that time! But now, a third rank Exalt Realm profounder had actually overcame it!

That was the Heavenly Tribulation! It was even one that had been called down by the Mortal Emperor Sword!Exactly how monstrous is this fellow, Yang Ye?

A smile arose on the corners of the Demon Emperor’s mouth. At this moment, he had a faint understanding of why the Undertaker had taken Yang Ye as his disciple, and he understood why his daughter wanted to be with Yang Ye!

All those years ago, even the heavens had to fear the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor. Now, regardless of whether it was natural talent or potential, Yang Ye wasn’t inferior to the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor at all. So, if Yang Ye was allowed to mature completely, then what could the heavens possibly do to him?

Luo Tian had a gloomy expression as he stood there in silence. No one knew what he was thinking!

On the other hand, the Grand Elder of the devil race had a mocking smile on his face. He should have been worried when so many geniuses had appeared amongst the humans, but he wasn’t worried at all now. Because all of those geniuses were enemies with each other!

“How could this be possible? How could this be possible? How could you possibly overcome the Heavenly Tribulation? How could you possibly....” Luo Jun gazed at Yang Ye with eyes that were filled with disbelief, and he muttered while seeming like he’d lost his soul.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s figure swished and vanished on the spot, and he was already in front of Luo Jun when his figure appeared once more. The latter’s expression changed drastically. He was just about to evade when Yang Ye activated his Sword Domain, and then Luo Jun’s figure suddenly stopped on the spot. At the same time, Yang Ye swiftly stabbed Lag towards the center of Luo Jun’s forehead!

Right when Lag had just touched Luo Jun’s forehead, layers of golden ropes had suddenly appeared around him, and they coiled around him like they were wrapping up a ‘Zongzi’.

Lag stabbed those ropes, yet an enormous force bounced it back, and it caused Yang Ye’s hand to feel extremely numb!

Luo Jun laughed coldly, and his laughter was filled with ridicule as he said, “Yang Ye, this is a Natural Dao Artifact, the Golden Armor of Ropes, and its defensive ability is only inferior to the Mortal Emperor Armor. You can’t break through my defenses!”

“Is that so?” Yang Ye flipped his palm, and then Frostlight appeared in his grasp. He sheathed it within the ancient sheath before drawing it forward!

Astonishment appeared in Luo Jun’s eyes when he witnessed this scene. Even though he didn’t know what this sword technique was, he was clearly aware of the might it possessed. It could even destroy the Heavenly Tribulation, so how could he dare to go head-on against it?

Luo Jun was just about to dodge when Yang Ye had drawn Frostlight completely.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s entire right arm split apart. There were a few dozen cracks that were around 10cm long all over his arm, and even his bones were exposed. On the other hand, Frostlight instantly transformed into countless pieces.

At the instant Frostlight shattered, an enormous white colored strand of sword energy flashed out and instantly smashed against Luo Jun.

Bang!

The golden ropes around Luo Jun were instantly slashed apart, and then his figure was blasted flying.

“Mortal Emperor!” Meanwhile, the Shadow Pavilion’s Master and the others who were still alive had been astounded by this scene, and they charged towards Yang Ye. However, that divine gold dragon that Yang Ye had refined into a Sword Servant wasn’t standing by idly. It dived down and smashed itself against them. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had arrived in front of Luo Jun, and a savage smile appeared on the corners of his mouth while he gazed at Luo Jun who was lying on the ground. He held Lag in his left hand as he stabbed it down towards Luo Jun’s forehead!

“How audacious!” Right at this moment, Luo Tian roared furiously. His voice seemed like it was a material soundwave that struck Yang Ye’s mind to the point it rumbled, and he almost slumped down to the ground!

The Demon Emperor appeared in front of Luo Tian, and he gazed at Luo Tian while a wisp of ridicule arose on the corners of his mouth. He said, “Luo Tian, can’t stop yourself from attacking already?”

Luo Tian shot a gloomy glance at the Demon Emperor, and then he looked at Yang Ye who was down below and said, “Yang Ye, I’ll definitely annihilate your entire family if you dare to harm him!”

Yang Ye grunted coldly when he heard this, and he said, “The enmity between me and your Exalted Han Empire had been irreconcilable for a very long time!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye kicked Luo Jun’s face, and the latter wailed as his figure flew off once more.

“Yang Ye! You’re courting death!” Luo Tian roared furiously!

Yang Ye paid no attention to Luo Tian. His figure flashed over to Luo Jun again, and then he swiftly stabbed Lag towards Luo Jun’s chest.

“Ancestor! Save me!” Luo Jun roared loudly. At such a moment of life and death, he couldn’t be bothered about keeping up appearances.

The Demon Emperor had locked onto Luo Tian, and he would immediately stop Luo Tian if Luo Tian dared to move!

However, Luo Tian had no intention to move at all!

Right when Yang Ye’s sword was about to stab into Luo Jun’s chest, an old man suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye. Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically, and he practically instinctively activated the Mortal Emperor Armor. The Mortal Emperor Armor had just covered his body when Yang Ye’s figure was blasted flying before the eyes of everyone in the surroundings.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s figure smashed against the ground extremely far away in the distance!

A ninth rank Monarch Realm expert!
