Chapter 2597

At this moment, everyone watching this battle was stunned!

An instant kill!

A Destiny Realm expert had been killed in an instant!

Everyone was stunned!

However, the most terrifying part was that the young girl showed no intention of stopping!

What did she plan to do?

Destroy the bridge!

The expressions of many changed when they saw the bridge collapse!

The bridge was the only path in this world. If it was destroyed, this entire world would fall into a decline. Because it connected many places like the teleportation formation. When people teleported here from the outside world, they would arrive at the teleportation formation, and that formation was built by the bridge. If the bridge was destroyed, the formation would vanish too. In other words, besides a few people, teleporting here in the future may drop them directly into the Boundless Water!

Besides that, there was only a single teleportation formation. How would they leave this place if it was destroyed?

Besides that, the territory of many powers was built by the bridge. Like the Sky Palace. If the bridge was destroyed, the Sky Palace would instantly fall into the Boundless Water down below.

The bridge was no ordinary bridge!

It was one of the few buildings here that could float above the Boundless Water, and it was used to suppress the Boundless Water too. It was the reason the Boundless Water below was so calm.

Of course, most importantly, the bridge was a symbol of this place!

No one knew how it came to be, but it was undoubtedly the most ancient existence here.

In the annals of history, no one had ever dared to destroy the bridge. Even if they fought on the bridge and occasionally damaged it slightly, they would mend it once the battle was over.

Yet now, someone was destroying the bridge!

The bridge was collapsing, inch by inch!

In just a few breaths of time, around 30 km of the bridge was gone. Even though it was just a small portion of the bridge, the bridge would vanish if this continued.

Once that part of the bridge vanished, the Boundless Water around Qi Bitian gradually started to tremble.

The Boundless Water wasn’t that calm anymore!

Meanwhile, many experts couldn’t stand by idly anymore.

It didn’t take long for an old man to appear before Qi Bitian. He wore a gray robe, had snow white hair, and seemed extremely old.

The old man glanced at her and said, “I’m sure you’ve vented enough now, right?”

Qi Bitian shook her head, “Nope!”

The old man’s face turned quite icy cold, “Allow me to experience your strength for myself then!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand slightly. That expanse of space instantly turned ethereal and formed a pitch black hole. The hole gradually moved to devour Qi Bitian.

Qi Bitian just stood there without moving and allowed it to try devouring her.

It didn’t take long for the hole to fully envelope her. However, Qi Bitian remained completely unharmed within it!

The old man frowned at the sight of this, “H-How can this be possible…?”

Qi Bitian spoke indifferently, “You’re trying to devour me? You’re absolutely na?ve!”

She waved her right hand slightly.

Bang!

The black hole vanished, and then Qi Bitian clawed at the old man from afar.

Sky Claw! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

She only knew three moves, and this was one of them!

It seemed like she could even claw and capture the sky!

The white-haired old man’s pupils constricted, and then an ethereal claw shattered the powerful aura and all the energy he emanated. An instant later, he was obliterated!

An instant kill!

The old man didn’t stand a chance!

The surroundings fell silent!

Meanwhile, Qi Bitian suddenly raised a finger, “Ten breaths of time. I want to see everyone from that organization which built the teleportation formation. If I don’t see them, I’ll start to kill, until I kill everyone in this world.”

She shook her hands once she finished speaking.

Bang! Bang!

Another huge expanse of the bridge on both sides of her exploded apart.

At this moment, the Boundless Water wasn’t just trembling, it was surging.

The Boundless Water had been silent for countless years. So, once it wasn’t suppressed any longer and truly erupted, it would sweep through this entire world. The Boundless Water could destroy everything in its path!

The entire world was in panic!

Because based on the current situation, the young girl standing above the Boundless Water was simply unrivaled!

The strange thing was that while the Boundless Water was surging in the surroundings, it was extremely calm in the area around her tiny figure!

She just stood there, and a rattan ball appeared under her foot. She just started kicking it in silence.

Meanwhile, an ethereal figure appeared not too far away from her, and there was a pike floating by the figure.

The Divine Abode’s master!

The Divine Abode’s master who usually lived in seclusion had appeared.

Qi Bitian gazed at the Divine Abode’s master, “It isn’t easy to have escaped that existence and survive until now. Don’t give your life away.”

A moment of silence ensued before the Divine Abode’s master spoke solemnly, “Is there no room for reconciliation?”

Qi Bitian shook her head, “I didn’t go looking for them and asked you to bring them to me because I’m being benevolent. Don’t test my patience. Once it’s exhausted, all of you will be buried with them.”

She looked up at the Divine Abode’s master and cracked a smile, “I can sense four powerful auras. You’re one of them, and there are three more. So, want to give me a try?”

Suddenly, the Boundless Water shook violently, and then it started roiling. A short while later, a colossus started swimming through the Boundless Water.

Everyone gazed at it!

There was something living within the Boundless Water?

Qi Bitian glanced at it, and then she smiled, “Interesting. An animal from that time.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she pressed her right palm down.

A moment later, a shrill cry resounded from there. Moreover, the Boundless Water there shook violently, and then some blood red liquid appeared there!

A few moments later, the colossus there dived deep into the bottom of the water.

It didn’t dare to show itself again!

Qi Bitian gazed at the Divine Abode’s master, “My patience is almost exhausted. I won’t hold back if I don’t see the people I wish to see!”

She waved her right hand. In an instant, the Boundless Water on her right rose up. More and more rose up, and they rose higher and higher. In the end, it was extremely high up!

Moreover, this expanse of Boundless Water flew over to the sky above Paradise Island!

So long as Qi Bitian released them, the water would rain down and drown Paradise Island. Moreover, Paradise Island wasn’t the only one that would be destroyed, the Sky Palace would be buried beneath Boundless Water as well!

At this moment, many powers couldn’t remain calm!

Especially those powers in Paradise Island. After all, the Divine Abode was merely one of the powers there, and there were many others.

Suddenly, many obscure and powerful auras appeared around Qi Bitian, and all of them had locked onto her.

Qi Bitian shook her head and smiled, “My patience is exhausted!”

She waved her hand gently.

Bang!

The Boundless Water rained down upon Paradise Island.

Meanwhile, the Divine Abode’s master took action. However, he didn’t attack Qi Bitian, and he tried to stop the Boundless Water instead!

A pike appeared before the Boundless Water, and it forcefully stopped all the Boundless Water from descending.

Qi Bitian shook her head and smiled, and then she tapped her right foot down.

Bang!

The expanse of Boundless Water exploded apart. At the same time, an ethereal human claw clawed down upon the Divine Abode’s master!

Sky Claw!

The Divine Abode’s master didn’t dare to act carelessly and revealed his true body. It was the body of a middle aged man. He waved his right hand, and the pike appeared in his grasp before he stabbed it forward.

A ray of dazzling black light rippled out of it, and the powerful energy it carried blasted up all the Boundless Water.

Boom!

However, once the claw descended, he was blasted away with his pike, and he flew over 30km away!

In an instant, the Boundless Water filled Paradise Island. Some fled the island, but most failed to do so. So, shrill cries resounded throughout the island.

But that wasn’t the end of it because Qi Bitian made a clawing motion with her right hand…

Bang!

The bridge started to collapse, inch by inch, to her right. In less than a breath of time, a huge expanse of it had collapsed, and it was still collapsing rapidly!

“Please show mercy!” Meanwhile, a solemn voice resounded.

Qi Bitian looked over, and she saw a hunched old man to her right. The old man held a pitch black staff in his grasp!

The old man didn’t say anything. He just waved his right hand, and then a few dozen figures appeared behind him. They were led by an old man in a luxurious robe. All of them were bound by pitch black chains.

The old man glanced at Qi Bitian, “It was Starnet Sect that stopped Young Brother Yang Ye from leaving. Every one of their members in this world are here, and you can do as you please to them.”

Qi Bitian glanced at them, “Are you sure?”

The old man nodded slightly, “I am!”

Qi Bitian gazed at the old man who led the group from the Starnet Sect, “Don’t look at me like that. You said you would bear any consequences. So, it’s time to do that!”

She waved her right hand.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

They started to explode apart, inch by inch. In just a short while, countless body parts and blood appeared on the Boundless Water!

Qi Bitian patted her hands together and said, “Alright, this killing has made me feel much better. It’s time to leave. Bye.”

She turned around and vanished on the spot.

Countless people heaved sighs of relief when they saw her vanish.

She was truly too terrifying!

Suddenly, Qi Bitian appeared out of thin air.

Qi Bitian glanced at the old man and said, “I almost forgot. There’s another one called the Sky Palace or something…”

Everyone here felt utterly speechless.
