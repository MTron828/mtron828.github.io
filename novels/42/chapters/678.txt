“Both of you aren’t a match for me!” An indifferent voice resounded from beneath the grey robed man’s cloak, and then both Yang Ye and An Nanjing were pushed back by a wave of enormous force. They were pushed almost 30m away before they stopped themselves!

“I refuse to believe that!” Yang Ye flipped his left hand, and then the Stone of Suppression appeared there. The effects of the Stone of Suppression caused the grey robed man and all the experts of the Exalted Han Empire to be instantly suppressed to a lower realm of cultivation!

The expressions of Emperor Han and the others changed drastically, and they didn’t hesitate to turn around and flee.

“Kill!” Yang Ye stomped his right foot on the ground, and then he instantly arrived before the grey robed man before stabbing his sword right at the grey robed man’s chest. Meanwhile, An Nanjing appeared on his right, and her spear emanated a dazzling glow as it stabbed towards the grey robed man’s chest as well.

A strange and thin dark blue energy barrier appeared before the grey robed man when their attacks were just over a dozen centimeters away from the grey robed man’s chest.

Bang!

The barrier shook violently from the collision and countless cracks appeared on it. Moreover, the grey robed man who stood behind it was forced to take 5 steps backward.

“Break!” Yang Ye suddenly twisted his right hand, and the barrier instantly shattered apart before his sword and An Nanjing’s spear stabbed swiftly at the grey robed man who was exposed now.

The grey robed man slowly clenched his fists, and then numerous strange dark blue symbols appeared on his hands. He finally smashed his fists against the tips of their weapons when Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s attacks arrived before him!

Bang!

The ground in an area of over 1km around the grey robed man rumbled as it collapsed, but the grey robed man didn’t move at all.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s pupils constricted because his strength was much more formidable than they’d imagined!

“Back!” The grey robed man shouted, and then both An Nanjing and Yang Ye’s weapons suddenly warped at a strange angle before both of them moved over 30m back.

A wisp of a ferocious expression flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes as he swiftly sheathed his intent sword, and then immediately drew it. A beam of violet sword energy flashed forward and instantly appeared in front of the grey robed man. The powerful Sword Intent and terrifying strength contained within the violet sword energy caused the space around the grey robed man to be severely warped.

However, the grey robed man still remained completely motionless and steady like a mountain!~

The grey robed man clenched his fists once more when the sword energy was only a few centimeters away, and then he smashed them against it!

Bang!

The sword energy was blasted apart while the grey robed man took over 10 steps back!

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted. He actually resisted it! That attack just now had 6 Heavenrends overlapped within it, and it was even enhanced with the 3rd stage of the Critical Strike technique! Yang Ye was very confident that even a ninth rank Monarch Realm expert wouldn’t be able to resist that attack with such ease. However, the grey robed man had succeeded, and it was even after he’d activated the Stone of Suppression!

Who exactly is he?

An Nanjing’s expression had turned serious as well, and she tightened her grip on Skysplit.

The grey robed man glanced at his hands. There was a bleeding scar on them. He said, “I never expected that you would actually be able to injure me. Looks like I still underestimated you. Let’s leave today’s matter as it is. You can forget about killing me as well. Because unless your master acts against me, otherwise no one on this continent is able to kill me. It’s impossible even if you join forces with that little girl. Perhaps you can give it a try once both of you have attained the Monarch Realm!”

“You’re a Half-Saint!” Yang Ye spoke in a low voice.

The grey robed man replied, “Yang Ye, your character is the reason you possess such attainments in the Sword Dao, but you’ll also encounter a huge amount of trouble because of it. The headstrong never live long, it’s a principle that’s existed since the ancient times. If you don’t know how to act according to the situation, then your future will be filled with trouble. That’s all I have to say. Do as you please!” The grey robed man and Yin Xuan’er vanished once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye remained silent on the spot for a short while, and then he said, “The southern territory would have instantly lost 2 enemies and gained 2 allies if I agreed just now. But I didn’t agree because I wanted to destroy the Exalted Han Empire’s royal family. Besides this incident, there have been many similar incidents in the past. They wouldn’t have developed to the worst possible scenario if I was able to be flexible. An Nanjing, was I wrong?”

An Nanjing walked over to face Yang Ye, and then she stretched out a finger and pointed it at Yang Ye’s chest. She said, “Right or wrong isn’t important, what’s important is that your own conscience is clear. Ask yourself if you would feel guilty from annihilating the Exalted Han Empire!”

Yang Ye shook his head. The Exalted Han Empire had acted against him on more than one occasion with the intention of killing him. He’d wanted to avenge that enmity for a long time. So, how could he possibly feel guilty? Moreover, he refused to believe the Exalted Han Empire, even if it surrendered!

An Nanjing said, “Since it’s like that, then why care about what he said? Since there’s no guilt or fear in your heart, then you should advance courageously. I’ll be there with you!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a while before he smiled, “You’re right. If I agreed just now, then I might have gained 2 allies, but that wouldn’t be what I desire. Moreover, how could I, Yang Ye, submit to another’s threats? So, let’s go. I intend to personally bury this ancient empire that has existed for over 10,000 years!”

Rumble!

Suddenly, the entire ground started to tremble as a wave of rapid rumbling resounded from within the city.

An Nanjing and Yang Ye raised their heads and looked towards the source of the rumbling. They saw a group of dark golden armored cavalry charging towards them with jet-black spears in their hands. The cavalry was over 500 men strong, and every single one of them was at the ninth rank of the Exalt Realm. Moreover, their mounts were Exalt Rank Crimsonflame Horses.

Crimsonflame Horses were enormous and had a horn that was strong as steel on their heads. Of course, the most important ability they possessed was their speed. Because their full speed was capable of rivalling the wind!

The cavalry stopped over 1km away from Yang Ye and An Nanjing, but the imposing aura emanated from the cavalry caused both An Nanjing and Yang Ye to frown.

Their aura was like a storm that caused both Yang Ye and An Nanjing to feel slightly suffocated even if they were so far away from the cavalry. Because the cavalry felt like a mountain that was falling down towards them!

“The Crimsonsky Cavalry!” An Nanjing’s profound energy surged as she spoke, “This cavalry is one of the Exalted Han Empire’s last remaining trump cards. Even though all of them are at the Exalt Realm, they aren’t weaker than Monarch Realm experts. Especially when they start moving at full speed, even ninth rank Monarch Realm experts dare not fight them head-on!”

Yang Ye nodded, he’d realized that they weren’t an ordinary cavalry just from the imposing aura they emanated. He flipped his wrist and an intent sword appeared in his grasp, and then his 12th level Sword Intent surged out from within him and formed a barrier of Sword Intent that isolated them from the cavalry’s formidable aura.

“Kill!” The members of the cavalry pointed their spears towards the sky as they roared furiously, and their voices were like a thunderclap that resounded through the sky.

Swoosh!

Meanwhile, An Nanjing’s Skysplit transformed into a ray of golden light that flashed forward like a shooting star, and then over a dozen soldiers fell from their Crimsonflame Horses.

An Nanjing moved her right foot backward a little, and then suddenly stomped it against the ground. Her figure shot forward like a cannonball. She instantly arrived before the cavalry in the lead of the group, and then her right knee smashed against his head. That soldier’s figure smashed against a few more soldiers behind him, and they were blasted away along with him. Moreover, their fates were unknown!

After she blasted a few of them away, An Nanjing tapped her right foot against the back of the Crimsonflame Horse beneath her, and it immediately exploded apart. Meanwhile, An Nanjing’s figure shot forward again while a few soldiers were blasted flying....

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then his figure flashed and charged into the group as well. Countless strands of sword energy flashed incessantly through the cavalry as he swung his intent sword swiftly. Practically every single strand of sword energy took the head of a soldier with it, but none of them fled, and it was even to the extent that not a single shrill cry resounded!

It was a fight to the death!

The strength Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s joint forces revealed was practically invincible. However, the cavalries were fearless, and they immediately charged forward and replaced their fallen comrades.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing didn’t hold back at all. Every single one of their attacks was ruthless, and every single attack would reap a life.

As he watched An Nanjing and Yang Ye reap their lives like gods of death, Emperor Han’s face turned gloomy while the experts by his side revealed astonishment. Moreover, all of their eyes were filled with terror.

When almost half of the cavalry had been annihilated, Emperor Han suddenly turned around and gazed at those experts behind him, “All of you can leave. You can surrender if you want. Yang Ye intends to annihilate the royal family. He won’t annihilate all of you if you don’t resist!”

“Emperor!” Those experts were horrified, and they hurriedly bowed to Emperor Han and said, “We’re willing to live and die with you!”

Emperor Han waved his hand and said, “The fact that all of you are still here right now is sufficient proof of your loyalty. I’m not testing all of you. Even Monarch Realm experts aren’t able to stop Yang Ye and An Nanjing. Staying here is no different than giving your lives away. Go on. Just leave.”

“Emperor Han, we may not necessarily lose!” One of the generals said in a low voice, “Emperor Han, please dispatch the Dragon Guard and Blood Guard. Allow them to join forces with the Crimsonsky Cavalry!”

Emperor Han shook his head and said, “The Exalted Han Empire is as good as lost. It’s powerless to turn the situation around. There’s still time for all of you to leave. It might be too late if you don’t act now.”

That general continued, “Emperor, all of us who’re still standing by your side right now would rather die than betray you. So, please don’t say such things again. We’re willing to live and die with you!”

Emperor Han gazed at them for a short while before he turned around and flew towards the palace while he said, “I’m returning to the palace. Order the Dragon Guard and Blood Guard to stop Yang Ye and An Nanjing. Since Yang Ye wants to destroy my Exalted Han Empire, then I’ll bury the entire continent with us!”

Hiss!

As the head of the last member of the Crimsonsky Cavalry was chopped off, all the soldiers and their mounts were annihilated!

Blood covered the entire ground before the city gate!!

Yang Ye turned around to gaze at An Nanjing who stood by his side, and then he stretched out his hand and wiped off the single drop of blood on her jade white face. After that, he turned back around and walked towards the city gate with his intent sword which was already dyed dark red from the slaughter.

An Nanjing remained silent for a moment before she followed him forward.
