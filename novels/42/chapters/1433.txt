Chapter 1434 – We’ve Been Waiting For You!

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “Brother Yang, don’t scare my younger sister like that.”

Yang Ye turned around, and he saw Nangong Qin walking over slowly from afar. There was an old man by her side. The old man was quite fat, and he wore extremely luxurious clothes. He looked very wealthy, and he even carried a faint dignified aura.

Yang Ye withdrew his sword when he saw her, “Are you alright?”

She shook her head slightly, “Actually, I was fine once you defeated Wildlands Stellar Region. Of course, nothing would have happened to me even if you failed.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She smiled and started explaining.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to come to an understanding. Actually, Nangong Qin had been released since he defeated Wildlands Stellar Region. The reason the news of her release hadn’t been made public was because she wanted to see how much their friendship was worth. If Yang Ye didn’t come to save her, then it proved that their friendship was worth nothing and Yang Ye was just using her.

Even though Azure Cloud Merchant Group couldn’t take revenge on Yang Ye, it could stay far away from him and not work together with him.

But Yang Ye had come. Not only had he come, he was actually willing to fight Azure Cloud Merchant Group for her. That proved that she was quite important to Yang Ye, and it proved that her judgment wasn’t wrong. Besides that, it proved that she’d won the high risk bet that she’d made.

“I’m sorry!” There was a trace of an apologetic gaze in Nangong Qin’s eyes. After all, it wasn’t right to test Yang Ye like that.

Yang Ye was about to speak when the old man by Nangong Qin’s side spoke abruptly, “This has nothing to do with Qin’er. It was my idea.”

Yang Ye gazed at the old man, “You are?”

“Nangong Tian!” The old man continued, “The current president of Azure Cloud Merchant Group and their grandfather. You can call me grandfather as well.”

Yang Ye’s face darkened, Fuck off!

“You look like you don’t want to!” Nangong Tian spoke angrily, “Do you know how many people in the Eastern Territory wish to call me grandfather? The queue can go all the way to the Western Territory!”

Meanwhile, Nangong Qin glared angrily at Nangong Tian, and she blushed slightly, “Grandfather!”

Yang Ye glanced at Nangong Qin, and he came to a slight understanding. Nangong Tian really wasn’t lying, and there probably really were a huge amount of people who wanted to call him grandfather. Why? Because calling him grandfather represented that one would be marrying his granddaughter and marrying his granddaughter would instantly allow the person to gain possession of half of Azure Cloud Merchant Group’s wealth!

That wasn’t a small amount at all!

But the old man wanted Yang Ye to address him as grandfather, so the meaning behind it was obvious.

However, Yang Ye had no such intention. He had more than enough wives. Adding one more would make it even more unfair to Su Qingshi and the others. Moreover, he really thought of her as just a friend.

So, Yang Ye smiled and said, “Senior, you must be joking. We’re just very good friends.”

Nangong Qin glanced at Yang Ye when she heard him refuse it. Even though she had quite a good impression of Yang Ye, it wasn’t to the point of liking him. However, as a woman, it made her feel quite uncomfortable when Yang Ye refused so decisively. Does he think I’m not worthy of him?

Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “I understand that merchants always seek profits, but I think that you shouldn’t use everything to accomplish such a goal. Miss Nangong is a person, and she isn’t a piece of goods. You shouldn’t treat her like goods and use her as a form of an investment or use her to rope in others. Don’t you think so too?”

The old man’s objective was very clear. The old man wanted to draw Yang Ye over to his side. But Yang Ye was very much against such actions. After all, love shouldn’t have any other motives hidden behind it.

Nangong Qin was slightly stunned when she heard him, and then her gaze became much gentler when she looked at Yang Ye again. Now, she had a better understanding of why an intelligent girl like Ye Liuyun was so willing to stay by Yang Ye’s side. It was none other than because while he possessed formidable strength, he was still very respectful towards women and didn’t belittle them.

Of course, the precondition was that he acknowledged the person.

The second young miss glanced at Yang Ye as well, and there was a trace of surprise in her eyes.

Nangong Tian gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then he said, “Kid, I admit that I underestimated you.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Since Miss Nangong is fine, then I’ll be bidding my farewells.” He had to travel to Wildlands Stellar Region. After all, the situation there was quite strange, so he had to deal with it himself. Only once he resolved it would he dare to head to the Ominous Territory.

Nangong Tian asked, “You’re heading to Wildlands Stellar Region?”

Yang Ye nodded, “How did you know?”

Nangong Tian replied, “Besides Wildlands Stellar Regions, all the other stellar regions have surrendered, so you definitely have to go deal with it. However, you have to be careful.”

Yang Ye gazed at Nangong Tian, “Why?”

Nangong Tian shook his head, “I’ve sent my people to investigate, but I couldn’t get any confirmed information. I’ve only heard that Wildlands Stellar Region seemed to have gained the backing of someone. However, even if they didn’t have any backing, they definitely have something to rely on. So, you should be careful. However, based on your strength, even 10 Deities can’t kill you. But you should still be careful!”

Because of Nangong Qin, the greater Yang Ye’s accomplishments were, the greater the benefits that Azure Cloud Merchant Group received would be. So, he naturally didn’t want Yang Ye to die early.

“Thank you for the warning!” Yang Ye cupped his fist towards Nangong Tian and said, “I know that Azure Cloud Merchant Group’s information networks are unparalleled. I hope that you can provide Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region some help in that aspect.”

If they didn’t have a good network of information, it would be no different than being deaf and blind. If Azure Cloud Merchant Group could provide information to Zhuang Weiran and the others, then it would definitely be much easier for them to deal with many things.

Nangong Tian smiled, “No problem!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Farewell!”

As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, he didn’t stay a moment longer and vanished on the spot.

Meanwhile, Nangong Tian suddenly shook his head, “What a pity!”

Nangong Qin gazed at Nangong Tian with a puzzled expression on her face, “What?”

The second young miss spoke indifferently, “Grandfather feels that it’s a pity that Yang Ye refused the union with you.”

Nangong Tian smiled, “Actually, it may not be a bad thing. We’re a merchant group that seeks to gain wealth in peace, and we always seek to maintain harmonious relationships with others. But the way Yang Ye does things is the absolute opposite. So, if he becomes a part of our clan, then it may not be a good thing for us.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he glanced at both the sisters and said, “Both of you should stop fighting for the position of patriarch from now on. Both of you are each other’s only loved one once I’m gone. Understand?”

They fell silent.

Nangong Tian gazed at the second young miss, “Second granddaughter, would you have been able to resist if Yang Ye really intended to kill you? See that? All plans are useless before absolute strength. You’re more suitable for cultivation than doing business. You should spend more time cultivating instead of running around and fighting with your older sister for the position of president. Understand?”

The second young miss fell silent.

Nangong Tian sighed softly, “I’m not siding with your older sister. But she really is more suited to business while you are more suited to cultivating. Once you arrive at a level comparable to Yang Ye, you’ll realize that besides strength, everything else is actually useless.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he gazed at Nangong Qin and continued, “It’s the same for you. Remember that no matter how much wealth you have, you can’t protect it without strength.”

A long moment of silence ensued before the second young miss nodded, “I understand.” Actually, she’d understood from the moment Yang Ye had pressed his sword against her forehead.

In this world, only strength was respected, and not wealth. Of course, when wealth arrived at a certain level, then it would be very terrifying as well. However, the precondition was that one had enough strength to protect that wealth. Otherwise, she wouldn’t even have the chance to use that wealth when someone targeted her.

Strength was more important than wealth!

Wealth was amassed so that one could possess even greater strength!

That was what Nangong Tian was telling them.

Meanwhile, Nangong Tian gazed at Nangong Qin, “Even though what you did was quite risky, I had to admit that you have courage. Moreover, your bold actions brought our clan a formidable ally. So long as Yang Ye’s alive, our Nangong Clan should be able to be continuously passed down. Moreover, even if I’m gone, both of you have someone to rely on.”

Nangong Qin hesitated to speak, “Grandfather, how are you....”

Nangong Tian smiled, “I’m fine. I’ve lived for very long yet have been unable to rise to a higher level. My death is just a matter of time. Resolve everything between yourselves on your own.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot.

...

Once he left Cloud Merchant Stellar Region, Yang Ye went to Stellar City. However, he hadn’t headed straight for Wildlands Stellar Region, and he sat down cross-legged and started meditating instead. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

He naturally had to be at his prime before heading there.

Just as Nangong Tian had said, Wildlands Stellar Region hadn’t done anything since it lost the battle, so there definitely was something strange going on. They either had help or had something to rely on. However, Yang Ye didn’t care about all of that. All he knew was that Wildlands Stellar Region had to pay the price. After all, it had seized Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region’s territory and even attacked it, yet it intended to act dumb now?

Impossible!

Around an hour passed before Yang Ye stood up and went to the teleportation platforms, and then he entered the teleportation formation which led to Wildlands Stellar Region.

Some time passed before Yang Ye arrived at a point in outer space. He glanced at the surroundings but noticed that there were no experts guarding the teleportation formation.

Yang Ye fell silent for an instant before he vanished on the spot.

...

Wildlands Continent!

Yang Ye had just entered Wildlands Continent when his eyes suddenly narrowed slightly, and then he stopped on the spot. At the same time, his profound energy started surging.

Meanwhile, a voice suddenly resounded, “Yang Ye! We’ve been waiting for you!”
