Chapter 1477 – The Soul Of The Dead!

Yang Ye spoke in an extremely serious manner, “Would you believe me if I said that you were the one who hugged me?”

She stared at him and said, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and said, “Can you let me ask you two questions before you attack? Just two questions.”

Yang Ye didn’t wait for her to answer him and just spoke, “Firstly, just think about it yourself. Do you remember what happened just now? Secondly, you’re so strong and far surpass my strength. Do you think that I have the ability to take advantage of you?”

Her eyes narrowed slightly and remained silent.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “Don’t you want to know why you’re acting like this?”

She slowly closed her eyes, “It’s her!”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched, “You know?”

Meanwhile, she suddenly asked, “Do you want to live?”

Yang Ye asked, “What are you trying to say?”

She released him and walked slowly to the center of the room. She placed her hands behind her back while she looked forward. A long time passed before she spoke slowly, “I’ve always thought that she was gone. But I never expected her unresolved feelings to be so strong, and she still isn’t gone. Moreover, she’s even able to take control of me. Help me with something and I’ll spare you!”

Yang Ye asked, “Who is she?”

The woman spoke coldly, “What’s with all the questions?”

Yang Ye replied, “The thing you want me to help you with is definitely related to her, right? Since it’s related to her, don’t you think you should tell me about her?”

The woman fell silent for a long time, and then she said, “She was just a strand of a perished soul that was drifting through this place, and she entered my body by chance. I thought I’d absorbed her completely, but her unresolved feelings are too strong.... Because of that, her desire to live is extremely strong as well. Thus, she has been living within my body, and she has even taken control of my body without me realizing it.”

Yang Ye asked, “How do I help you?”

She turned around to gaze at him, “You’re quite sensible.”

Yang Ye puckered his lips. What else can I do when you want me to help?

Actually, from the moment she’d asked for his help, he knew that he couldn’t refuse. It couldn’t be helped because he was no match for her!

The woman said, “Her unresolved feelings are too strong. If I try to eliminate her by force, then she’ll definitely fight to the death. At that time, even if I win, it’ll be a pyrrhic victory. Moreover, I don’t want to use force on her. So, I need you to help me make her let go. Once her unresolved feelings are resolved, she’ll vanish and enter the cycle of reincarnation. That’s the best outcome for her.”

Yang Ye asked, “Isn’t it impossible to enter the cycle of reincarnation from this place?”

“That’s on the outside. It’s possible here!” She continued, “Besides being unable to leave, we don’t suffer any further restrictions. Don’t ask about the rest. You don’t stand to gain anything from knowing about things that you shouldn’t know about. Moreover, I’m not so free as to explain it all to you. Your job is to help me make her let go and enter the cycle of reincarnation.”

Yang Ye shrugged. At this moment, he didn’t care about obtaining information related to the Ominous Territory. He was in danger, so how could he have the mood to care about the Ominous Territory?

Yang Ye immediately said, “How do I make her let go?”

The woman fell silent for a long time, and then she said, “The reason she’s still here is that her husband never came back all those years ago. Her husband wanted to leave this place by force, and so he suffered.... In any case, her husband was obliterated, and she had no further will to live because her husband was dead, so she chose to accompany him in death. But for some unknown reason, her soul didn’t perish. Even though her soul still remained, it wasn’t normal anymore.”

She gazed at Yang Ye at this point, “Pretend to be her husband and make her realize the situation she’s in right now. Once she realizes that, her unresolved feelings will be gone.”

“Pretend to be her husband?” Yang Ye frowned, “Are you joking?”

“Do I look like I’m joking?” She spoke coldly, “She treats you as her husband, so it’s the best time to make her let go, and it’s the best time for her, me, and even you to gain our respective freedom. So, you have no choice. Understand?”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “You want me to pretend to be her husband, but my question is, what do I do after that? How do I make her realize the reality before her and let go?”

The woman spoke indifferently, “I don’t know!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Yang Ye was stunned, “You don’t know?”

She replied, “Think of a way by yourself!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Suddenly, the woman appeared before him, and she stared at him, “I don’t care what methods you use. However, remember this. Don’t take advantage of this body. It belongs to me, not her. Understand?”

Yang Ye replied, “What if she wants to take advantage of me?”

“I don’t care!” The woman continued, “In any case, if I find out that you took advantage of my body....” She glanced at his lower body at this point, and then she stretched out her hand and clenched her fist, “I’ll crush that thing of yours!”

Yang Ye instantly felt a wave of coldness sweep through his lower body. How violent!

Meanwhile, she turned to look out of the door, “Make her let go and I’ll spare you.”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “Can you send me out of this place? It’s best if you can send me into the Forest of Darkness!”

“Out?” She turned to look at him, and then a wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of her mouth, “You want to leave after you entered this place?”

“What are you trying to say?” Yang Ye frowned, “I can’t leave after entering this place? Don’t scare me!”

“Scare you?" she grunted coldly, “This place is a world of its own. It only allows entry and not exit. Once someone enters, the surroundings will change. So, consider me impressed if you can still find your way back.”

The surroundings will change? Yang Ye was stunned, and then he said, “The Unfettered One! Didn’t he come in here and leave?”

The woman’s eyes narrowed slightly, “The Unfettered One? You know him?”

She frowned slightly at this point, “Wait! You have a trace of his aura on you. What’s your relationship with him? That doesn’t make sense. He came here an extremely long time ago. You weren’t even born then. You should be a descendant or someone who received his guidance!”

Yang Ye’s face twitched. He’d intended to use the Unfettered One’s name. But the woman had instantly discerned that he wasn’t really close to the Unfettered One.

So, he couldn’t use the Unfettered One’s name anymore!

Meanwhile, the woman added, “He was naturally able to leave. Who could possibly stop him with the strength he possessed? Who would dare to stop him? But what about you? You’re so weak, so who wouldn’t dare to stop you?”

Yang Ye’s face darkened, “Hey, can’t you be a little tactful?”

“Tactful?” She laughed coldly, “You’re weak yet don’t allow others to say that about you?”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes and spoke in an extremely serious tone, “Give me three years and I’ll be able to fight 10 of you!”

Her eyes narrowed slightly. She was about to speak when she suddenly frowned. She sized him up, and then she fell silent. At this moment, she recalled that the man who stood before her was just a Voider!

A Voider!

Voiders were like ants to her. Not to mention fighting her, she could kill such cultivators with a single glance. However, the man who stood before her had been able to forcefully resist a few attacks from her.

She remained silent for quite some time before she spoke again, “Your natural talent in the Sword Dao isn’t any weaker than him. If you came a few years later, then you would be just like him. No one in here would be able to harm you, and no one would dare to stop you. However, you just had to come in here when you’re weak. Whose fault is that?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Do you think I wanted to? I only came here because I got lost! Seriously, I regret it. Beautiful sister, you’re so strong. Send me out of this place, and I’ll come back to save you once I’m stronger. Alright?”

“Would I need you to save me if I could send you out of this place?” She shot an indifferent glance at him, “According to my knowledge, only two people in history were able to leave after they entered from the outside. The rest have died upon coming here.”

“Two people?” Yang Ye frowned, “Was it a middle aged man?” The middle aged man Yang Ye spoke of was naturally the middle aged man who’d given him the dragon seal.

“A middle aged man?” She shook her head, “No, that person didn’t leave like the Unfettered One. That person is still here. However, the people, demons, and all the other things here know that existence has the ability to leave this place!”

It isn’t a middle aged man? Yang Ye’s brows were pressed tightly together. He’d thought that the middle aged man had entered this place, but now it would seem like the middle aged man had clearly not come here.

But it did make sense. Even though the middle aged man was very strong, there was probably a huge gap between him and the Unfettered One. Moreover, that middle aged man’s strength probably wasn’t greater than the woman who stood before him.

Because if the middle aged man had been a Rebirth Realm expert, then even if the middle aged man couldn’t leave this place, he would have definitely been able to survive.

Meanwhile, the woman said, “I don’t care if you’ll be able to leave or not. I just want to say that you can leave once you help me deal with her unresolved feelings. As for where you go, that’s your business. That’s our deal. Understand?”

Yang Ye asked, “What if I can’t?”

“You’ll try until you can!” She looked him in the eyes and continued, “She treats you as her husband now. So, only you have the ability to make her let go. Besides that, I must remind you that while she won’t keep her guard up because she treats you as her husband, it’s best if you don’t think about seizing the opportunity to kill me. Because she’ll instinctively hide herself upon encountering danger, and then I’ll gain control of my body again. Understand?”

Yang Ye glanced at her. Sure enough, it was exactly as he’d expected. It was impossible to attack her while Suxin had control of her body. He would probably be dead if he’d tried that just now.

“One more thing!” Meanwhile, she stared at him and said, “Don’t have any other thoughts about my body. She won’t be on guard against you, but you must realize that this is my body and not hers. So, you understand, right?”

Obviously, she was afraid that Yang Ye would seize the opportunity to....

Yang Ye was about to speak when she suddenly frowned slightly, and then her expression changed. It didn’t take long for the icy cold expression on her face to become gentle again.

Yang Ye grunted coldly as he gazed at her. Nothing will happen between us, but I can still touch a little, right?

I’ll touch a little!

But where?

Yang Ye’s gaze descended on the woman, and he scanned her incessantly. In the end, his gaze stopped at a certain position.
