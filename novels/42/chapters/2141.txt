Chapter 2142 – It’s War!

The Guardian of the Human Race!

It was so dramatic!

Yang Ye, someone wanted in the Human Dimension, and instantly became its guardian. It was absolutely sudden.

The hunched old man and the others had gloomy expressions on their faces, and no one knew what they were thinking.

They represented the forces on the Sovereign of Man’s side. Yet now, the other organizations in the human race had formed a new alliance. Actually, it was equivalent to a rebellion. If Yang Ye and An Nanjing hadn’t joined it, they would still have the ability to fight for the right to govern the entire human race. Yet now, Yang Ye and An Nanjing had joined the other side, so they’d completely lost the ability to do that. Just Yang Ye and An Nanjing were enough to give them hell.

“Let’s go!” The hunched old man turned around and left once he finished speaking.

The other Sages didn’t hesitate and left with him.

Meanwhile, Lin Zhen smiled, “Young Brother Yang, come with me. I have some other seniors and experts of the human race to introduce to you.”

Yang Ye didn’t refuse. He gazed at An Nanjing, and the latter nodded slightly before entering the Primordial Pagoda within him.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Snowy sized up An Nanjing with curiosity and frequently touched her. Meanwhile, An Nanjing was looking at Snowy as well. Snowy naturally recognized An Nanjing, but she hadn’t seen An Nanjing for too long, so an unfamiliar feeling was unavoidable when meeting her again now.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing suddenly grabbed Snowy by the ear, “I need spirit energy. Come, give me a little!”

Snowy was stunned speechless.

In the outside world, Yang Ye followed Lin Zhen and the others to Nature Sacred Grounds.

Lin Zhen suddenly asked, “Young Brother Yang, who was that young miss from before?”

Yang Ye replied, “My friend!”

Yang Ye’s friend!

Lin Zhen nodded slightly, “Your friend is very amazing. I didn’t expect our human race to have such a monstrous genius other than you. Our human race is truly lucky.”

He paused for a moment at this point and continued, “Actually, many organizations in the human race refused when the Sovereign of Man kept wanting to hunt you down. We are no fools, and we understood his true intentions. Moreover, you’ve never truly threatened the human race. Unfortunately, the Sovereign of Man’s influence was too vast, so we didn’t want to throw the human race into internal strife at a time like this. Now that the Sovereign of Man is dead, we don’t have to worry about that anymore.”

Yang Ye said, “The entire human race has less than 20 Sages?”

“Around that!” Lin Zhen spoke solemnly, “It doesn’t include some hidden organizations and independent cultivators who’ve cultivated bitterly for countless years yet still keep a low profile. All of them aren’t very willing to get mixed up with the conflicts of the outside world. But it can’t be helped because this is no ordinary conflict, it’s a battle between races. If the human race loses, our human race will probably vanish from the large universe.”

Yang Ye asked, “Now that I’ve joined you, aren’t you worried about the sky race and the other races?”

Lin Zhen smiled, “We’ve discussed that problem before. This time, we don’t want to follow the sky race anymore. We want to take our own path!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

He stopped when he spoke up to this point, “We’re here!”

In a hall.

There were only 16 people here, and all of them were Sages.

The Sages were seated on both sides while Lin Zhen sat at the seat of the host. Yang Ye was by Lin Zhen’s side.

Many Sages were looking at Yang Ye, and there was curiosity in their eyes.

Lin Zhen said, “Everyone, I’m sure I don’t have to introduce the person beside me. Now, he’s one of us as well.”

As he spoke, he introduced the others to Yang Ye. When he came to the final old man, Lin Zhen bowed slightly to the old man before he said, “Young Brother Yang, this is Senior Ku Long. Senior Ku Long is an independent cultivator from the Confucianist Progenitor’s time.”

The Confucianist Progenitor’s time!

Yang Ye gazed at Ku Long and nodded slightly, “Senior!”

Ku Long gazed at Yang Ye, “The young are truly terrifying!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly and didn’t say anything in response.

Meanwhile, Lin Zhen said, “Everyone, we’ve established the Human Alliance, and that means we represent the entire human race now. At the very least, as far as the other races are concerned, we represent the human race. Now, we do have the strength to take control of the human race. However, you must remember that we’re in danger right now. The other races will definitely target us and even suppress us. So, we must resolve that problem first!”

Someone suddenly asked, “Can’t we join them?”

Lin Zhen gazed at Yang Ye, and Yang Ye replied, “Joining them represents that you’ll be targeted by the god race!”

The person asked another question, “What if we don’t join them?”

Yang Ye glanced at that person and said, “If we don’t join forces with the other races, then perhaps I’ll be able to deal with the god race for you. But if you join the other races, then I will leave. My enmity with them cannot be resolved. Moreover, I have the Sprite Lord, so they won’t just give up.”

They immediately came to an understanding when they heard this.

If they chose the other races, they would lose Yang Ye, that monstrous young woman, and the Sprite Lord. Moreover, the god race would target them. But if they chose Yang Ye, the god race wouldn’t target them, and the Sprite Lord would be on their side. Choosing Yang Ye represented that the Sprite Lord would stand on the human race’s side. Moreover, both Yang Ye and the other woman were extraordinary geniuses. So, with these two extraordinary geniuses protecting the human race, it was an absolutely good thing for the human race!

But similarly, the human race would be targeted because of these two geniuses, they would be targeted by the other races, the Alliance of All!

The hall suddenly fell silent.

It was a dilemma.

Ku Long said, “This time, we should protect them. They represent the human race’s future. So, I choose to not join the Alliance of All. Our human race will be on its own. As for the other races, if they insist on targeting us, then we’ll tell them that we’ll side with the god race if we have no other choice!”

Someone suddenly asked, “But what if the god race targets us?”

Ku Long gazed at Yang Ye, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye replied, “I’ll try my best to stop any conflicts from arising between the god race and human race.”

Ku Long nodded, “Actually, the important matter at hand is to find a way out for our human race.”

Yang Ye gazed at Ku Long with bewilderment on his face, “A way out?”

Ku Long explained, “According to the information I obtained, the three paths have started. The other races may have received news of this too, and they should be starting soon too. Our large universe is truly about to welcome a huge change, and our way out is to leave this large universe and travel to a different universe. But the large universe is surrounded by endless black holes. In the end, no one went to subdue them. Now, there are.”

Everyone gazed at Ku Long and waited for him to continue.

Ku Long continued, “Destroying a black hole may create a passageway that leads to the outside world. However, it isn’t that easy to traverse. The three paths have lost many of the experts they sent. As for our human race, we too should send experts there to open up a way out for us!”

When he heard up to this point, Yang Ye had a rough understanding of why Dao Ling had come to get him.

Obviously, they wanted him to go open up that passageway.

Lin Zhen spoke solemnly, “Is that information reliable?”

Ku Long nodded, “It should be accurate. The various organizations throughout the large universe are tangled up with each other, and some other mysterious organizations had secretly surfaced. It can be said that this world is truly about to change. If we don’t find a way out for ourselves, we’ll probably be buried with this large universe.”

Lin Zhen suddenly asked, “Who will go?”

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye, yet Ku Long suddenly said, “I will!”

Everyone gazed at Ku Long.

Ku Long smiled, “Young Brother Yang just joined us, so it isn’t right to send him on such a dangerous mission. Moreover, their presence here will definitely be able to deter the other races. After all, they have the strength to kill Sages in an instant. Besides that, if they leave the Human Dimension, I’m worried that the other races will converge their forces and annihilate both of them. But if they stay here, then with the presence of all the Sages of the human race and their own strength, the Alliance of All won’t rashly attack unless they are willing to go down with us!”

Lin Zhen nodded and said, “Senior Ku Long is correct. Moreover, we need Young Brother Yang to help us speak to the god race. We don’t want to become enemies with the other races, but we don’t want the god race to target us and scheme against us too.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “I’ll make a trip to the god race and talk to them.”

Lin Zhen nodded, and then he withdrew an ancient scroll and passed it to Yang Ye, “There’s a teleportation formation in there, and it can teleport all of us to your side in half a breath of time. If it’s necessary, just open it and we’ll be there. Of course, we have similar teleportation formations too. If we encounter an attack, we hope you’ll be able to rush over too. Presently, we can’t allow ourselves to be caught alone. Otherwise, every Sage we lose is an extremely huge loss to us!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright.”

Suddenly, a middle aged man appeared here. He glanced at them and said, “The Alliance of All sent a message. If our human race doesn’t hand over Yang Ye, then it’s war!”

War!
