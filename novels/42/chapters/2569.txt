Chapter 2570

In the Primordial Pagoda, Qi Bitian frowned slightly and looked up at the sky. Actually, she was looking outside, and she muttered softly, “The Abyss Lion.”

Lei Li asked curiously, “Big Sister, you recognize that big guy?”

Qi Bitian nodded slightly, “It tried to attack me when I passed by its territory.”

Lei Lin asked, “What happened?”

Qi Bitian replied, “And then its territory became mine. However, I didn’t kill it because it is a descendant of that existence.”

Lei Lin blinked, “But it’s trying to kill Big Brother Yang.”

Qi Bitian smiled, “It’s not trying to kill me, so what do I care?”

Lei Lin was stunned speechless.

Qi Bitian glanced at Yang Ye and spoke softly, “Allow me to give you a friendly reminder. That fellow isn’t ordinary. Besides Erya’s bloodline that can firmly suppress it, other demon beasts cower before it. Especially that dragon in here. It’s a bane of dragons, and the bane of many demon beasts. So, don’t let them go outside and die.”

She pulled Lei Lin to the side to play with her!

Nothing was more important than Gomoku and soccer to Qi Bitian!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

At this moment, Yang Ye sensed the powerful aura of that demon beast from within the encirclement of countless souls. He shot a glance to the side, and he saw a pitch-black colossus charging at him from there!

As it charged at him, the entire sky shook!

It couldn’t endure the colossus’ strength at all!

But Yang Ye couldn’t dodge at all because there were countless souls around him!

Meanwhile, the Abyss Lion was getting closer and closer!

Now, Yang Ye could see its rough outline. It was huge. It had a horn on its head and an especially long mouth that seemed like it housed a pitch-black vortex.

Suddenly, a powerful devouring force enveloped Yang Ye. As soon as it enveloped him, Yang Ye and the space around him actually started to move toward the mouth!

It wanted to swallow him alive!

“Watch out! Even that Super Divine Treasure won’t be able to slice it open from the inside!” Meanwhile, Qi Bitian’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind.

Yang Ye’s face darkened, “Then tell me how am I supposed to stop myself from being swallowed?”

Qi Bitian replied, “You fool! Hit it! It’s only truly strong internally, and its outer body is just ordinary!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then a wave of powerful sword intent and sword energy rippled out from him, and then a ray of sword energy tore through the area.

13 overlapped swings with the Sword Domain!

However, it was instantly swallowed upon arriving before the Abyss Lion!

It had been swallowed! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Meanwhile, two powerful auras swept over from behind Yang Ye!

Countless souls enveloped Yang Ye like a black snowstorm!

A vicious glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, and then he waved his sword swiftly, causing rays of sword energy to surge out!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The sound of something being sliced open resounded throughout the sky!

However, the souls simply seemed endless. They madly devoured Yang Ye’s sword energy and sword intent, and they tried to devour his sword too. It could be said that if he wasn’t holding a Super Divine Treasure, then even a divine treasure would be gone by now!

Meanwhile, the Abyss Lion was still eyeing Yang Ye ferociously and was waiting for an opportunity to strike!

But it didn’t take long for it to suddenly look toward the Ancient Sword Sect!

Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically from the sight of this!

Meanwhile, the Abyss Lion charged at the sect below!

Once it got close to the sect, the entire sect would be sucked into its stomach!

Suddenly, something unexpected occurred. A few powerful auras suddenly appeared in the air above the sect!

Yang Ye was shocked.

More Lord Realm experts?!

But it only took a moment for him to be stunned!

Because he knew the owners of those auras, it was the Grand Elder’s group that had left the Ancient Sword Sect that day!

Yang Ye frowned slightly from the sight of them.

They’re back?

Elder Xue and the others paid no attention to Yang Ye and just charged at the Abyss Lion! They were all at the Lord Realm, and they weren’t ordinary Lord Realm experts either, so their powerful auras forced the Abyss Lion away from the sect.

But it also aroused the ferocious nature within it!

A moment later, a huge mouth that stretched far and wide appeared in the sky above the sect. At the same time, an extremely powerful suction force swept out from it. At this moment, the disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect couldn’t stop themselves from shooting up into the air toward the mouth in the sky!

Even Elder Xue and the others were barely able to resist it!

Elder Xue and the Grand Elder exchanged glances, and then the elders behind them suddenly raised their swords before rays of sword energy flashed through the sky like bolts of lightning.

Meanwhile, Elder Xue suddenly shouted with fury, “Thousand Sword Formation!”

As soon as she gave the order, her sword left her grasp, and it was the same for all the other elders here. Besides that, the swords of all the disciples down below shot up into the air as well!

In an instant, countless rays of sword energy and sword intent surged into the sky!

Elder Xue formed a strange seal with both hands, and then a huge circle of swords appeared before the Abyss Lion. After that, countless rays of sword energy rained down from them!

Meanwhile, countless rays of sword energy surged up into the sky from below!

However, the Abyss Lion didn’t fear them at all!

It devoured all the sword energy, and even if some did hit it, they didn’t cause any damage to it!

Elder Xue’s face turned utterly gloomy from the sight of this!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was locked in combat with those two black robed experts from the Soul Sect, and he couldn’t leave to help the others at all!

The worst part was that around 20 more black robed figures had appeared behind the Soul Exalt!

All of them didn’t carry the aura of the Soul Sect. Obviously, they didn’t belong to the Soul Sect!

Moreover, all of them were Lord Realm experts!

The person who led the group was a Grade 3 Lord Realm expert who held a cane!

The other powers had taken action!

Meanwhile, they suddenly vanished, and they were in front of Elder Xue’s group when they appeared again!

They didn’t waste their breaths and just attacked!

They struck lethal blows!

It was utter suppression!

At this moment, all the other powers had joined forces, and the Ancient Sword Sect was utterly suppressed!

Countless disciples of the sect started to fall!

One after the other!

The sect was covered in corpses and blood!

At this moment, Yang Ye was being kept busy by those two experts from the Soul Sect. While they couldn’t kill Yang Ye, Yang Ye couldn’t kill them either! Their current mission was just to keep Yang Ye busy!

So long as they succeeded, the Ancient Sword Sect wouldn’t be able to defend itself against the joint forces of the Soul Sect and the other powers!

Just like this very moment, the Ancient Sword Sect was being completely crushed!

Meanwhile, at the Ascension Platform within the Primordial Pagoda.

The dragon had gathered all the demons here. It didn’t say a single word and just pointed into the sky. The others nodded to display their understanding!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

A moment later, numerous terrifying demon auras appeared in the sky!

At this moment, everyone’s attention was grabbed by them!

Demons!

Primal Demons!

All of them returned to their true forms, and they simply blotted out the sky!

Especially the Primal True Dragon, it practically blotted out the entire sky on its own!

Meanwhile, the Abyss Lion’s gaze instantly descended upon the dragon, and there was undisguised greed and excitement in its eyes!

The Abyss Lion!

It was a natural bane of the dragons!

A very, very long time ago, they survived feeding on dragons!

Meanwhile, the dragon’s gaze descended onto the Abyss Lion as well. It had sensed the Abyss Lion earlier, and it had chosen the Abyss Lion as its opponent too!

Because if this Abyss Lion attacked the others, they wouldn’t be able to fight back at all!

Erya wasn’t here, so he was their leader, and so he had the fight the strongest!

At this moment, he actually really missed Erya. Because he didn’t have to face the strongest opponent when she was here!

The dragon didn’t hesitate to charge at the Abyss Lion!

Meanwhile, the Abyss Lion’s eyes were filled with greed and excitement as if a feast was rushing at it!

Just like that, they entered into battle!

In the Primordial Pagoda, Qi Bitian glanced at the dragon and said, “I’m quite surprised!”

Lei Lin blinked and gazed at her.

Qi Bitian grinned, “Logically speaking, it should be afraid upon seeing the natural bane of its existence. However, it’s actually not afraid and even dared to make the first move. Hmm, this dragon is pretty good.”

Lei Lin blinked, “That big guy is terrifying, but I think Big Sister Erya is more terrifying!”

Erya!

Actually, as far as they were concerned, even the most terrifying demon beast wasn’t as terrifying as Erya, and they’d been in contact with Erya every single day… It could be said that besides Erya, no other demon beast was terrifying to them. Even the Abyss Lion wasn’t that terrifying when compared to Erya!

Besides that, they’d been with Yang Ye and Erya for so long, so their characters had been influenced by them!

It was fine to lose in battle!

But never shrink back from battle!

When the dragon thought of the disdain Erya would show him upon finding out that he’d cowered from battle, there was no fear left in his heart!

The reason Erya had acknowledged him was because he’d fearlessly protected Snowy!

If he didn’t even fear death, why should he fear the natural bane of his existence?

Once these demon beasts appeared, the situation grew better for the Ancient Sword Sect!

But it was only the beginning!

The top-figures of Eternal Kingdom were watching from afar.

Among them were the Xing Clan’s patriarch, the Leng Clan’s patriarch, and a mysterious figure in black. It was the leader of Heaven's Avatar.

Besides that, there were two other figures here. A woman in palace clothes, and a middle aged man in linen clothes.

All the powers out in the open and hidden in the shadows throughout Eternal Kingdom were here!
