Chapter 2073 – I Do!

Yang Ye watched as the trembling expanse of space suddenly calmed down, and then an old man walked out from there.

A Sage!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He hadn’t expected a Sage to be here.

However, why would he fear that Sage?

Yang Ye’s profound energy circulated while Judgment was swapped for the Sword Supreme.

The old man took a step forward and instantly arrived before Yang Ye.

At this moment, he was less than three meters away from Yang Ye.

They were extremely close.

The old man glanced at the young man’s corpse, shook his head, and then gazed at Yang Ye while a complicated expression appeared in his eyes.

Yang Ye tightened his grip on the Sword Supreme.

Meanwhile, the old man suddenly said, “There’s no need to attack. I’m not here to kill you!”

“Huh?” Yang Ye gazed at the old man with a puzzled expression.

The old man explained, “While I’m on the Sovereign of Man’s side, I refuse to slaughter humans for him. Especially human geniuses like yourself. Yang Ye, I’ve heard about the enmity between you and the Sovereign of Man, and it’s something that’s difficult to determine who’s right or wrong in it. However, there’s one thing you must understand. Both you and the Sovereign of Man are still human!”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “What are you trying to say?”

The old man placed his hands behind his back, looked up into the starry sky, and spoke softly, “Based on your current strength and identity, you should be aware that chaos is about to descend upon the world. So, how many of all the races will be able to survive it? I’m afraid not many will. If the human race wants to survive it, we must stay united!”

“United?” Yang Ye chuckled, “I’m sure you’re aware of whether it’s the human race that refuses to accept me, or is it I who refuses to accept the human race!”

The old man gazed at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, remember that you’re human. If the human race encounters danger, I hope you’ll be able to remember your identity as a human. All personal enmity is nothing before the survival of our race.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man turned around and vanished into space.

A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “The survival of the human race? The Sovereign of Man has made me a wanted person for all this time, and made the entire human race chase after me, yet I should care about their survival? Am I an idiot?”

Suddenly, Snowy appeared in front of Yang Ye, and there was a ball of green light by her side.

The Mist Sprite!

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head gently and said, “Snowy, tell it that this place has been exposed. If it stays, it’ll definitely be in danger. So, ask it if it’s willing to leave with us?”

Snowy gazed at the Mist Sprite and started communicating with it. A short while later, Snowy cracked a smile and gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye grinned when he saw the smile on Snowy’s face. Sure enough, everything worked out when Snowy was with him. The sprites didn’t really trust humans, or they could be said to be hostile to humans. However, they would never be hostile to Snowy, or it should be said that they really trusted her.

It was done!

Yang Ye told Snowy to take the Mist Sprite into the Primordial Pagoda while he transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

As soon as he left the planet, Yang Ye noticed the mist on the planet was gradually dispersing. Yang Ye glanced at it, and then he moved his gaze away and vanished into the boundless reaches of space.

He’d found one of the four sprites.

Yang Ye passed through the boundless reaches of space, and it didn’t take long for him to arrive in the world where the next sprite resided. It was called Sky Aqua Continent. As soon as he saw the name, Yang Ye guessed that the sprite in this continent was a Water Sprite!

Almost 90% of the planet was covered beneath the ocean, and there was only a very small area of land.

On a certain part of the ocean, Yang Ye summoned Snowy again. The latter glanced at the surroundings before looking down beneath the ocean surface, and then she sniffed the ocean. A short while later, she placed her paws against the surface of the ocean, and then the water started to tremble.

Yang Ye gazed at Snowy with a little curiosity in his eyes. What is she doing?

Yang Ye watched as the water started trembling violently like it was boiling.

Just like that, the trembling continued for almost 15 minutes.

Boom!

Suddenly, the surface of the ocean around 300m away from Yang Ye exploded, and then a water dragon shot up into the air and attacked Yang Ye.

Bang!

A pillar of water shot down like an arrow that instantly arrived before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye swung his sword.

Hiss!

The water dragon was instantly slashed into two.

However, countless water dragons shot up into the air all around Yang Ye.

There were hundreds of them!

Yang Ye frowned. Meanwhile, Snowy suddenly opened her mouth and sucked. In an instant, all the water dragons split open and transformed into fine pearls of water that surged toward Snowy. In the end, Snowy swallowed all of them.

Yang Ye felt speechless from the sight of this.

Meanwhile, a vortex appeared not too far away from Yang Ye, and then a tiny water dragon gradually appeared before Yang Ye.

It was extremely small, and it was as small as Snowy.

It gazed at Yang Ye, and then it gazed at Snowy. There was bewilderment in its eyes.

Snowy suddenly flew over to it and patted it lightly on the head. The water dragon gazed curiously at Snowy, and it didn’t take long for it to point its claw at Yang Ye before pointing it at Snowy.

It seemed like it was asking Snowy why she was with Yang Ye!

Snowy glanced at Yang Ye, and then she waved her little claw. Yang Ye understood her. She was telling the water dragon that Yang Ye was a good person, a very, very good person!

Yang Ye shook his head and grinned. He glanced at the water dragon and Snowy. Actually, natural beings like Snowy were usually completely safe in the world. Why? Because they were blessed by nature, and they were protected by the world.

No experts would dare to slaughter them. Even if they were captured, no expert would ill-treat them if they were willing to submit. As for slaughtering beings like them, even the evil treasure behind Yang Ye didn’t dare to do that!

Heaven’s wrath did exist for real!

Snowy and the water dragon were still talking. A short while later, Snowy flew over to Yang Ye, and then she pointed at the water dragon before waving her claws again.

Yang Ye fell silent.

The water dragon didn’t want to leave.

Suddenly, a voice resounded from behind Yang Ye, “Tell it that it’s best if it leaves!”

It was the evil treasure!

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

The evil treasure replied, “There’s a formation here, and it conceals its aura. That’s why very few experts have been here in so many years, and even if they did come here, they wouldn’t be able to find it while it didn’t reveal its presence. However, the formation has been corroded by time, and it’s on the verge of vanishing. Once it does vanish, countless experts will definitely swarm this place.”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. Only now did he recall that it was exactly as the evil treasure had said. He really hadn’t sensed anything special when he arrived here. All he sensed was a deserted planet with nothing on it, and he didn’t sense any signs of life either.

Moreover, if it wasn’t for Snowy, he would have probably been unable to find the water dragon even if he removed all the water on this planet!

So, as soon as he thought up to this point, Yang Ye gazed at Snowy and said, “Persuade it. Tell it that this place is very dangerous. So tell it to follow us, alright?” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Snowy thought for a moment, and then she nodded. After that, she turned around, gazed at the water dragon, and started talking to it.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to notice that the water dragon was visibly hesitant.

Suddenly, Snowy grabbed the water dragon’s horn and pulled it into the Primordial Pagoda.

In the Primordial Pagoda, the water dragon glanced at the surroundings. It seemed slightly afraid and couldn’t help but move closer to Snowy. Snowy patted it lightly to reassure it, and then she waved her paw. Strands of violet energy immediately floated over to the water dragon, and the latter’s eyes immediately lit up upon catching sight of the violet energy.

The water dragon sniffed lightly, and those strands of violet energy immediately entered its nose. A short moment later, desire could be seen on the little water dragon’s face.

Suddenly, Tian Xiu asked, “What is she?”

The water dragon gazed at Tian Xiu, and then its expression changed and hurriedly moved closer to Snowy.

Snowy blinked. She turned around, grabbed the water dragon’s horn, and then dragged it over to Tian Xiu. After that, she pointed at Tian Xiu, and then pointed at the water dragon. Obviously, she was introducing them. Moreover, Snowy dragged over the Mist Sprite too.

However, just like the water dragon, the Mist Sprite was quite afraid of Tian Xiu and didn’t dare to get close to her.

Tian Xiu lowered her head slightly. No one knew what she was thinking.

Meanwhile, Snowy rubbed Tian Xiu’s head gently, and then she gazed at the water dragon and Mist Sprite before waving her claws again.

A short while later, the water dragon hesitated for a moment before flying over to Tian Xiu, and then it gently touched her hand.

Tian Xiu looked up at the water dragon, hesitated for a moment, and then touched its horn. The water dragon didn’t refuse her. A short while later, the water dragon and Mist Sprite weren’t afraid of Tian Xiu anymore, and they let her touch them as she pleased.

Actually, it was mainly because they trusted Snowy. They trusted that Snowy wouldn’t harm them. So, that was why they hadn’t refused when Snowy pulled them into the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye had been watching all of this.

Yang Ye opened his eyes in the outside world, “Have you seen the young girl who’s with me? Her name is Tian Xiu. Do you fear her?”

He was naturally asking the evil treasure!

A long moment of silence ensued, and then a voice resounded, “I do!”

Yang Ye’s face froze.
