Chapter 1968 – I’ll Teach You!

Ling gazed at A’Man with quite a strange expression on his face!

All the races!

All the races in the large universe!

Yang Ye was quite surprised. He hadn’t expected A’Man to say that. However, regardless of whether she was telling the truth or not, Yang Ye was quite grateful right now.

Meanwhile, A’Man suddenly stopped, “We’re here!”

Yang Ye and Ling looked up, and they could faintly see a mountain in the distance.

“That’s Southern Qilin Mountain!” A’Man spoke in a low voice, “It’s the only spirit vein in this area.”

Spirit vein!

Yang Ye looked up. Sure enough, he could sense fluctuations of spirit energy now. However, he thought of something, and it was that there were spirit veins in the Primordial Pagoda. They were the spirit veins he’d gathered in the past.

Of course, he didn’t dare to let them outside!

Wouldn’t that be no different than courting death?

Spirit veins were the scarcest resource in this place, and he had so many. He could imagine that if he revealed that he possessed that many spirit veins, he would definitely be surrounded by all the experts in this place!

So, he couldn’t expose their existence at all!

“Be careful!” A’Man’s figure gradually descended to the ground. It didn’t take long for all of them to arrive on the ground, and then A’Man started restraining her aura.

Yang Ye and Ling completely concealed their auras as well.

The three of them arrived at the foot of Southern Qilin Mountain. But right when they were about to ascend the mountain, a black clothed man suddenly appeared before them.

The man scanned them and cracked a smile, “Three immortal crystals!”

Suddenly, a spiked club appeared in A’Man’s grasp, and then it shot through the air.

Bang!

The black clothed man was blasted over 1km away!

The black clothed man glanced at his hands. They’d cracked open, and the sight of this made a ferocious expression appear on his face.

A’Man looked the black clothed man in the eyes, “We don’t have any immortal crystals, but we have three lives. Do you want that?”

The black clothed man glanced coldly at A’Man, and then he grunted coldly and turned around with the intent to leave.

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “Wait!”

The black clothed man stopped and gazed at Yang Ye. A’Man and Ling gazed at Yang Ye too because it was Yang Ye who’d said that!

Yang Ye flipped his palm, and a sword appeared in his grasp. He walked towards the man with his sword in hand, “Three immortal crystals. Leave it here and you can go.”

A’Man glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent!

The black clothed man’s face was instantly covered with ferocity, “You’re trying to rob me?”

“I can’t?” Yang Ye’s face was covered in ferocity as well, and then a ray of light flashed.

Bang!

The black clothed man was blasted over 300m away, but as soon as he stopped himself, Yang Ye had appeared before him again, and then Yang Ye swung his sword once more.

Boom!

The black clothed man, who was at the Hear Dao Realm, was blasted away once more!

After Yang Ye swung his sword 10 times, the black clothed man had been blasted over 3km away!

He couldn’t fight back at all!

A’Man and Ling exchanged glances, and they saw a wisp of shock in each other’s eyes.

The black clothed man was even more shocked than they were!

Because he noticed that he actually felt like there was no way to counterattack Yang Ye’s attacks. Sometimes, he forced himself to attack, but his attacks were instantly destroyed with ease!

Suppression!

He was being completely suppressed by Yang Ye!

At this moment, Yang Ye’s attacks flowed smoothly as he desired!

It was truly flowing smoothly like his heart desired. Every single attack was executed freely. After he studied the sword techniques the old man in Daoist’s robes gave him, he knew that he’d undergone some sort of change. Unfortunately, he didn’t know what it was!

However, it was a good thing!

At this moment, every single time the black clothed man attacked, a few dozen methods to deal with the attack would appear in his mind, and those methods came from the sword techniques he’d studied! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

All techniques should come naturally! The sword moves as the heart wills! Strike freely!

These words were the summary of a sword technique, the Heart Killer Sword. At this moment, Yang Ye was in a state similar to those words!

The black clothed man was being pushed back repeatedly, and there were a few dozen injuries on his body.

In the end, three immortal crystals appeared before Yang Ye!

At this moment, Yang Ye and the black clothed man were only 1km away from each other, and the man’s eyes were filled with fear.

Yang Ye glanced at the immortal crystals, and then he flicked them over to A’Man.

A’Man glanced at them and remained silent.

The black clothed man glanced coldly at Yang Ye and vanished into the distance.

A’Man suddenly asked, “Why?”

Obviously, she was asking why Yang Ye attacked the black clothed man.

Yang Ye walked over to her and replied, “Big Sis, with the strength you possess, I’m sure you’ve noticed that there are others in the surroundings, right?”

She nodded slightly, “There are at least three Know Dao Realm experts amongst them!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Big Sis, this is how the world works. The nice are bullied. Even though you tried to act domineeringly, you know… you still seem quite kind in their eyes.”

“Kind?” A’Man asked, “What do you mean?”

Yang Ye answered, “You’re not ruthless enough. I attacked because I wanted to tell them that we aren’t afraid of trouble and dare to cause trouble too. If you want to avoid trouble when dealing with people like them, there’s only a single way to accomplish that, and it’s to be even fiercer, ruthless, and crueler than them.”

Ling glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent.

A’Man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then he said, “Now, I kind of understand why you were able to survive being pursued by all the races!”

All those races? Yang Ye shook his head. He’d been surviving through being hunted by people all his life.

His experiences allowed him to understand a principle—the weak feared the strong, and the stronger feared the insane!

A’Man flicked the immortal crystals in front of her. One of them flew over to Ling while another appeared in front of Yang Ye, “I won’t refuse it, but I won’t take it all. Let’s take one each, alright?”

Yang Ye wanted to refuse because he really didn’t need it. However, he didn’t say anything when he noticed her gaze. That strong woman before him was a stubborn person!

One each!

Ling glanced at Yang Ye, and he didn’t say thank you. As far as he was concerned, it didn’t make a difference, and if he really wanted to thank Yang Ye, he should just remember this kindness in his heart.

While it was only a small thing, it was still a nice thing that was done for him!

“Let’s go!” She glanced at the surroundings and started walking into the mountain.

It didn’t take long for them to enter the center of the mountain.

It was a completely different world here.

A’Man said, “The top of Southern Qilin Mountain isn’t a place we can go to, and the bottom isn’t a place we can go to either. Because the deepest parts of this mountain and the top of it are the two ends of the spirit veins. So, those supreme experts own them. We’re going to the center!”

Yang Ye asked, “The center?”

A’Man nodded, “Because the spirit energy in this mountain seeps out from above and below, that spirit energy gradually forms immortal crystals. Of course, it takes a very long time to form. Now, those experts will absolutely not let the spirit energy seep out anymore!”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “We’re just picking what others missed!”

A'Man nodded slightly, “We are. It’s the only thing we can do, and even that is extremely dangerous. Because while some pick up what others miss, others take their lives!”

A'Man sped up once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye and Ling exchanged glances, and he was about to follow after her when Ling suddenly asked, “Do you know who from the spirit race was trying to kill you?”

Yang Ye glanced at Ling and shook his head, “I don’t know. Why?”

Ling shook his head slightly, “It’s nothing.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he followed swiftly after A’Man.

Yang Ye shrugged on the spot and hurriedly followed after them.

The inside of Southern Qilin Mountain was huge, and it was simply boundless. A’Man withdrew a small disk, and there was a fine black needle swaying lightly on it.

Yang Ye asked, “What’s that?”

A’Man replied, “A Spirit Energy Detector, it has a very good chance of detecting where there’s fluctuations of spirit energy and immortal crystals!”

Spirit Energy Detector? Yang Ye was stunned. He was about to speak when the needle on it started spinning swiftly. A’Man was visibly happy from this, and she looked towards the right, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye and Ling immediately followed after her.

Yang Ye and Ling followed A’Man to a forest, and she stopped once she arrived here.

The black needle on the Spirit Energy Detector was pointing at the forest.

A long time passed before A’Man shook her head, “Let’s leave!”

She turned around and walked away.

Obviously, she’d noticed something.

Yang Ye and Ling didn’t say anything, and they just followed after her. Suddenly, a voice came from within the forest, “Since you’re here, why don’t you come in?”

A’Man stopped and gazed at Yang Ye and Ling, “Looks like we can’t leave now.”

Ling fell silent and didn’t say anything.

Yang Ye asked, “They want to rob us again, right?”

A’Man chuckled, “It’s a trick that some people here are fond of, and I encountered something similar in the past. However, it can’t be avoided. It’s part of the risk in this place!”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Have you robbed before?”

A'Man was stunned and shook her head.

Yang Ye cracked a smile, “Alright, then I’ll teach you!”

A’Man was stunned speechless.
