Chapter 990 – You’re That Weak To Me!

“Reason or the fist!?” Yang Ye’s voice resounded like a sonorous bell.

The woman stared fixedly at Yang Ye, but there was no fear or terror in her eyes, there was only calmness.

“Yang Ye, did you come here to put on a show of your strength? If you did, then you’ve succeeded, and you can leave.” Meanwhile, a voice suddenly resounded from within the city.

A Saint!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he dispersed his intent sword and looked in the direction of the city, “Senior, you must be joking. I came here under the Dean’s orders to seek assistance from the Bear Clan. As for what happened just now, I think that sparring between the younger generation should be very normal. What do you think, Senior?”

“It’s very normal indeed!” The voice said, “Since it’s like that, then the geniuses of my Bear Clan will have a little spar with you.”

As soon as he finished speaking, 9 brown bears suddenly leaped out of the city and slammed heavily against the ground.

Bang!

A huge explosion resounded as the mountains in the distance shook violently.

The brown bears weren’t huge, but every single one of them possessed an aura that was deep like an ocean. They were like 9 towering mountains which had stood there since time immemorial, and they emanated a heavy pressure.

Something worth mentioning was that all of them were completely alike. Even the moment their eyes blinked or the minute movements they made while breathing were completely the same!

Meanwhile, Xiong Baitian had walked over to Yang Ye’s side and spoke softly, “Big... Big Brother.... They can even exchange a few blows with a Saint when they join forces. You... you really shouldn’t spar with them.”

Yang Ye nodded lightly, and then he looked up at the city and said, “I don’t really understand what Senior is trying to say!”

The voice replied, “Defeat them and I’ll let you enter the city to meet me; lose and you can return from where you came from.”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment before he said, “As you wish!” He walked towards those bears once he finished speaking.

Meanwhile, the woman who was lying on Xiong Baitian’s back spoke abruptly, “You’re that Yang Ye who once challenged the Dao Order while at the Exalt Realm, slaughtered millions of wolves outside Ocean of Clouds City, and annihilated the entire secret court of Ocean of Clouds Academy?”

Yang Ye stopped, and then he turned around to look at the woman, “You know about me?”

She replied, “So, Seng Yuan lost to you?”

Yang Ye asked, “What are you trying to say?”

She gazed at him and said, “I admit that you’re very strong, but I’m not as weak as you imagine. The reason I lost is because I underestimated you, and that was my mistake.”

Yang Ye looked at her for a short while before he said, “As far as I’m concerned, you’re that weak!”

Yang Ye paid no further attention to her and started walking towards the 9 bears again.

The woman said, “I’ll make you take that back!”

“Maybe in your next life!” Yang Ye quickened his pace once he finished speaking.

She clenched her fists tightly while her chest rose and fell rapidly.

Roar!

Meanwhile, the brown bears suddenly raised their heads and roared, and then they charged at Yang Ye in unison. As their paws descended upon the ground, the ground started to tremble and quake like there was an earthquake.

At the same time, Yang Ye suddenly stopped moving. An intent sword appeared in his grasp before he pressed it against the center of his brows, and he seemed like he’d entered a meditative state.

In next to no time, the bears were less than 300m away from Yang Ye, and the powerful imposing aura they emanated pressed down upon Yang Ye. Yang Ye remained firm and immovable like a mountain, but the ground behind him had started to collapse!

At this moment, Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes!

A ray of light flashed, and then Yang Ye appeared behind the 9 bears when the ray of light dispersed.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The other bears watched with astonishment as 3 of those brown bears slowly collapsed to the ground. It didn’t take long for them to notice that the tendons on the front legs of those bears had been severed, and the cut was extremely flat and smooth like a mirror.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye vanished on the spot again, and a ray of light flashed.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

3 more brown bears crashed to the ground.

A ray of light appeared again!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The last 3 bears fell to the ground. The tendons in all of their front legs had been severed without exception.

The surroundings were perfectly silent.

All the bears here looked with disbelief at that figure in the distance who stood with a sword in his hand. 9 high rank Half-Saints, and they were even no ordinary high rank Half-Saints, yet they’d still fallen before anyone could even discern what had happened.

Is he a Saint? All of them had such a thought while shock filled them.

The woman clenched her fists tightly. There was shock, disbelief, and extreme fear in her eyes.

“Big Sister, can... can you resist that... that attack of his?” Xiong Baitian gulped and asked with a trembling voice.

Bang!

The woman suddenly smashed her fist against Xiong Baitian’s head, and he was instantly smashed into the ground and smashed open a deep hole there.

“You won’t be able to walk for a year if you continue!” She glared at Xiong Baitian who was lying flat on the ground, and then she turned around to gaze at Yang Ye while an indescribable trace of complicated emotions could be seen in her eyes.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye took a deep breath, and his countenance was slightly pale. He’d exhausted quite a bit of strength by executing Death by a Thought 3 times in succession. But it was worth it. Because he could be considered to have paid the smallest price to gain victory. If he hadn’t utilized Death by a Thought, then he would probably have to fight those bears for a few days and nights!

He didn’t have the time to waste on them!

“I underestimated you.” Meanwhile, the voice resounded from within the city again, “Come in. I’m really curious about how you’ll convince me.”

Looks like that Saint knows why I’ve come! Yang Ye nodded slightly, and then he shot towards the city.

Yang Ye was quite surprised when he entered the city. Because he noticed that many bears in the city had actually taken human form. However, most of them were still in their original form. At this moment, every single one of them was staring at him without exception.

“Big, Big Brother! Wait for me!” Meanwhile, Xiong Baitian suddenly caught up to Yang Ye and said, “Big Brother, why have you come to see my father?”

That woman was by Xiong Baitian’s side, and she was looking at him with a curious gaze.

Yang Ye glanced at Xiong Baitian and said, “You’re the Bear King’s son?”

Thump!

Xiong Baitian struck his chest and spoke complacently, “Of course!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly. While he was slightly surprised, it wasn’t really surprising to him. He’d sensed that Xiong Baitian’s identity was definitely not ordinary since the very beginning. Because all the bears they passed shot gazes of respect towards Xiong Baitian, and they hadn’t been obstructed all along the way. So, it clearly displayed how extraordinary Xiong Baitian’s identity was!

Xiong Baitian was stunned when he noticed that Yang Ye’s expression remained calm, and then he said, “Big, Big Brother, don’t you have anything to say? I... I’m the future leader of the Bear Clan!”

Yang Ye suddenly stopped moving and turned around to look at Xiong Baitian, “Is that great?”

Xing Baitian hadn’t expected that Yang Ye would ask such a question and was stunned by it, “Isn’t it great? Our Bear Clan is the strongest clan of demon beasts in Pine Prefecture!”

Yang Ye nodded, “The Bear Clan is great, but are you?”

“I....” Xiong Baitian glanced at Yang Ye and spoke softly, “Actually, I’m quite strong!”

Yang Ye asked, “Can you defeat me?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Xiong Baitian’s face stiffened, and he laughed with embarrassment, “There... there should be a small gap between me and you, Big Brother.”

Yang Ye said, “But do you realize that many others in the outside world can kill me?” When he spoke up to this point, he patted Xiong Baitian and said, “Remember that the Bear Clan’s strength has nothing much to do with you. Because their strength isn’t your strength. Just think about it. What would you do if a Saint wanted to kill you once you left Earthen City? Would you tell him that you’re the future leader of the Bear Clan?”

“Err....” Xiong Baitian had never thought about it, so he didn’t know what to say.

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Why is your name Xiong Baitian?”

“I... I gave it to myself!” Xiong Baitian struck his chest and spoke heroically, “I want to become a bear who can even defeat the heavens, and that’s why I named myself Xiong Baitian!”

“You have quite the aspirations!” Yang Ye nodded and said, “Since you’ve addressed me as your big brother, then I’ll speak a little more. Remember that you must make the Bear Clan proud because it has you, and not feel proud because you’ll lead the Bear Clan in the future. Understand?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around and walked off towards the distance.

Xiong Baitian was stunned on the spot, and a long time passed before he suddenly turned to look at the woman, “Big Sister, would they still respect me if I wasn’t the future leader of the Bear Clan?” He glanced at the other bears in the distance while he spoke. At this moment, all of them hurriedly lowered their heads respectfully when they saw him look towards them.

The woman remained silent for a long time before she said, “Baitian, it isn’t that father and I refuse to let you leave and experience the world. The reason we didn’t let you leave was because you are too weak. You really might not be able to return here if you leave and aren’t protected by Third Uncle and the others.”

She patted him lightly on the head when she spoke up to this point, and there was a rare gentle expression in her eyes, “You can head into the outside world, but you can only go anywhere you want once you’re able to defeat me!”

Xiong Baitian glanced at the other bears in the surroundings and said, “I understand now. They wouldn’t respect me at all if it weren’t for you and father.”

“If you want to take control of the Bear Clan in the future, then you must work hard on your cultivation!” The woman spoke in a low voice, “Otherwise, father would never let you take control of our clan. Because that would only bring harm to you!”

Xiong Baitian remained silent for a long time before he nodded and said, “Big Sister, I understand now.”

The woman nodded slightly, and then she lightly patted Xiong Baitian’s head, “Come, let’s go see why he’s here!”

...

The royal palace of the Bear Clan.

Yang Ye had just entered the grand hall in the palace which belonged to the Bear King when he sensed numerous terrifying auras. All of these auras weren’t being directed at him, but they made him feel suffocated.

He raised his head and looked over, and he saw 5 old men standing on each side of the hall, and a middle aged man in a yellow robe was seated on the seat of the host.

11 Saints! Yang Ye’s was astonished as he’d never expected the Bear Clan to actually possess 11 Saints!

The middle aged man in yellow robes suddenly spoke, “I know why you’re here, but we reached a unanimous decision just a little while ago. We’ve decided against interfering in the conflict between Ocean of Clouds Academy and Welkin Wolf Mountain Range.”
