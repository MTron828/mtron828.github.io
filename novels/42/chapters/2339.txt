Chapter 2340 – Tragedy!

“Impossible!” Suddenly, a voice of disbelief resounded from deep within the mountains, and then a white haired old man suddenly appeared 300m away from Yang Ye.

The old man gazed at Snowy while disbelief filled his eyes.

Snowy glanced at the old man. Meanwhile, Yang Ye slapped her butt, and she immediately turned around and rubbed her head incessantly against his chest.

She was quite embarrassed!

In the end, Yang Ye forced Snowy into the Primordial Pagoda. But when the little fellow went inside, she shot one last reluctant gaze into the distance.

“Impossible…” The old man stared at Yang Ye, “How could she have possibly taken those swords, that’s absolutely…”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “What do I cultivate in?”

The old man slowly clenched his fists.

Yang Ye said, “Why isn’t it possible? See? I’m a sword cultivator. They felt that my natural talent is extraordinary and acknowledged me as their master. Isn’t that very normal?”

“Bullshit!” The old man cursed, “Yang Ye, stop flattering yourself. There’s definitely something wrong about that Sprite Lord of yours. Make her show herself! I want…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared before the old man, and then a ray of sword energy descended.

The old man’s expression changed slightly, and his profound energy circulated. In an instant, two strands of flames appeared on his arms, and then he raised them.

Bang!

The old man forcefully clamped down upon Yang Ye’s sword,. But he was pushed around 1km back by the force of the collision! As soon as he stopped himself, a golden flying blade arrived before him.

The old man’s expression changed drastically from the sight of this, and he crossed his arms and slammed them forward.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the old man was instantly blasted away. At the same time, a pair of arms flew off into the air while accompanied by pillars of blood!

They were the old man’s arms!

The old man hadn’t even stopped himself when the sound of air being torn open resounded, and then a ray of sword energy pierced through the old man’s forehead!

Hiss!

Blood sprayed.

Yang Ye lowered his sword behind the old man, “Wasn’t it nice to hide? You just had to show yourself!”

The old man’s eyes were opened wide as he stared into the distance, and a short while passed before they gradually dimmed down.

Once he killed the old man, Yang Ye walked slowly into the distance.

Suddenly, an ethereal figure appeared near Yang Ye. It was the woman who’d warned him that the Immortal Estate’s master was on the way back. There was a thin layer of black mist around her, so it was impossible to see her appearance clearly.

A strand of sword intent swept out from Yang Ye. Meanwhile, she suddenly said, “Don’t misunderstand. I have no intention to stop you.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “I’m just curious about that cute pet of yours. I wasn’t able to see it clearly earlier, so can you make her show herself so that I can have a good look?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “I’m afraid that’s not possible.”

“I’m really just curious!” She continued, “Just let me see it, alright?”

Yang Ye tightened his grip on his sword and didn’t say a word before walking toward the Immortal Estate. When he arrived near her, she looked at him and said, “How about we make a deal? I don’t want your other treasures. So long as you give that little fellow to me, then not only will I refrain from trying to seize your other precious treasures, I’ll even give you a Pseudo Divine Treasure in exchange. Moreover, I will stop targeting you too. What do you think?”

Yang Ye stopped and gazed at her, “Are you trying to give alms to me?”

She smiled, “Of course not! Yang…”

She stopped abruptly at this point because a strand of sword energy had arrived before her.

Bang!

It dispersed, and she was pushed over 300m back.

Yang Ye glanced coldly at her, “I don’t have time to waste on you. Disturb me again and I’ll kill you first before I deal with the Immortal Estate.”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away.

A powerful aura suddenly swept out from her, but it didn’t take long before it shrunk back again.

Her icy cold voice resounded, “Let’s see how long you can keep this up!”

Yang Ye ignored her and just sped up.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to stop. There was an estate before him. It was huge, like a small city, and it was extremely quiet.

Meanwhile, the door of the estate suddenly opened, and then five mysterious black robed experts flashed out with spears in their grasps. A moment later, five spears appeared in front of Yang Ye.

True Void Realm experts!

All five of them were at the True Void Realm, but their auras were linked together like they were a single person!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly.

Bang!

A ray of blood red light surged up into the air from within Yang Ye. An instant later, Yang Ye drew the saber behind him and swung it.

It was a sweeping swing that carried an overbearing force.

As soon as it descended, a wave of powerful energy rippled out of Invincible, and the five black robed experts were instantly pushed back repeatedly. Yang Ye, on the other hand, was pushed around 30m back too!

Five spears suddenly tore through the air at him when he’d just stopped himself.

Yang Ye grabbed Invincible with both hands and hurled it forward. At the same time, a saber that was as thin as a cicada’s wings appeared in his grasp.

The Hidden Blade!

Yang Ye stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of saber energy. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

An instant later, countless rays of saber energy enveloped the black robed men, and golden light frequently flashed through the saber energy too!

The flying blades!

Two flying blades!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Horrifying sounds of slicing resounded throughout the area.

Just like that, this went on for around ten breaths of time, and then the surroundings suddenly fell silent.

Now, only one person remained there, Yang Ye.

Invincible was by his side, and Hidden Blade was in his grasp. Blood was dripping down incessantly from both sabers, and there were ten corpses around him!

Every corpse had been sliced into two, and that was why they were considered as being ten!

All five of them were dead!

Yang Ye put the saber back on his back and walked toward the estate. Meanwhile, a beautiful woman appeared at the estate’s entrance.

Based on her outward appearance, she seemed to be around the age of 30. She wore a beautiful violet dress and had a very alluring and voluptuous figure.

She glanced at him and said, “Yang Ye, what do you want?”

Yang Ye didn’t stop, “Don’t ask such a stupid question, alright?”

She stared at him, “You’ve practically killed all the experts of my Immortal Estate who hunted you down, so will you still not stop?”

“Practically all?” Yang Ye chuckled, “I’m young, so don’t lie to me. I still remember an old man at the Half-Step World Lord Realm. According to my knowledge, he’s still alive, right?”

The woman’s face turned gloomy, “He is alive, but you heavily injured him. He can’t pose a threat to you without recuperating for a few dozen years. After all, he doesn’t have Primordial Violet Energy. So, can’t you spare his life?”

“Spare him?” Yang Ye stopped and looked her in the eye while ferocity covered his face, “Why didn’t your Immortal Estate try to spare me?”

She remained silent.

“Don’t tell me that I’m going to extremes and leaving no room to maneuver!” Meanwhile, Yang Ye started walking toward the estate, “So long as that old man at the Half-Step World Lord Realm, and all the True Dao Realm, True Void Realm, and True World Realm experts of the Immortal Estate are dead, I can spare the Immortal Estate and leave!”

The woman’s face instantly became unsightly, “Yang Ye, you want the lives of all my Immortal Estate’s experts? Do you really think we fear you? I…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was in front of her when he appeared again. An instant later, a ray of sword energy descended straight down.

The woman’s expression changed drastically, and she retreated back into the estate.

Boom!

A bottomless hole appeared before the estate!

An instant later, Yang Ye stomped his right foot down and shot up into the air. A moment of silence ensued, and then a 3km long ray of saber energy shot straight down from the sky and sliced through the world!

If one looked up from below, it was like the sky had been chopped apart!

Suddenly, a huge barrier of light surged up from the estate down below, and it slammed against Yang Ye’s saber energy.

Boom!

The saber energy shook violently, and then it exploded apart with the barrier of light, causing the entire sky to ripple.

Meanwhile, a blood red saber descended from the sky, and a blood red mark was left in its wake.

Suddenly, a terrifying aura swept out from within the Immortal Estate.

Someone spoke softly from a certain point in space, “So they used it in the end?”

Another voice replied, “The Immortal Estate would probably be gone if they don’t!”

“He’s amazing for being able to force the Immortal Estate into such a corner!”

“Indeed…”

At the Immortal Estate. Along with the appearance of the terrifying aura, Yang Ye’s blood red saber suddenly stopped in midair and seemed to have been stopped by some sort of force.

A moment of silence ensued, and then a woman in an aqua blue dress walked up into the sky from within the estate.

Every step she took caused space to tremble, and the sky gradually turned ethereal before her.

It didn’t take long for her to arrive before the blood red saber. She glanced at it, and then she flicked it.

Clang!

A clear and melodious clang resounded, and then Invincible cracked open. Countless shrill cries resounded from within the saber.

It was the shrill cries of the vengeful spirits within it!
