Chapter 2664 – All of You Deserve Death!

The undying race’s patriarch?

Huang Ying frowned slightly, fell silent for a moment, and said, “Invite him in.”

A short while later, a middle aged man entered the hall.

It was the undying race’s patriarch, Feng Yihan.

If Yang Ye was here, he would definitely be shocked. After all, Tian Xiu had been hunting him. However, she seemed to have failed because he’d been constantly hiding.

Coupled with the fact that Tian Xiu had been distracted while trying to help him, the undying race’s patriarch had been able to escape death.

Since then, the undying race had vanished from the world and never shown itself again.

Now, he’d shown himself once more.

Once he entered the hall, the gazes of everyone here fell upon him.

An unfathomable aura!

It was what they sensed from him.

Huang Buer glanced at Feng Yihan and was slightly surprised.

Huang Ying said, “Why have you come here?”

A moment of silence ensued, and then he suddenly said, “To discuss something important.”

Huang Ying asked, “What?”

Feng Yihan replied, “To take over Eternal Kingdom!”

Huang Ying’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he grinned, “We welcome you!”

…

In a boundless expanse of the starry sky, Yang Ye shot through there on his sword while leaving behind a deep mark in space.

The Destiny Dimension!

His destination was the Destiny Dimension.

Actually, he wanted to have a look at the Destiny Dimension for himself. After all, Destiny had created it at her prime, so it was definitely different from other spaces!

Yang Ye stopped around four hours later.

At this moment, he was at a pitch black expanse of space, and he could faintly see some starlight beyond the pitch black space.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and asked, “That Destiny Realm of yours is here?”

The woman in black’s voice suddenly resounded, “Pass through this area!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “This place feels strange to me.”

“What are you afraid of?” She suddenly spoke angrily, “You’re carrying two of the best swords in this word. Can you stop being so cowardly?”

Is that being cowardly?

Yang Ye's face darkened. She has such a terrible temper. Did she drink the wrong milk as a child?

A short while later, Yang Ye continued forward. Because he noticed that he really didn’t have anything to fear. With those two swords in his possession, he should be fine unless he encountered one of those abnormal old geezers!

Not long after, Yang Ye’s feeling that something wasn’t right grew stronger and stronger. Because there was a mysterious aura in the surroundings.

Suddenly, a low gasp resounded in Yang Ye’s ear.

Yang Ye was stunned.

Step! Step! Step!VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The sound of footsteps resounded from afar.

Yang Ye frowned slightly, and then he issued a command in his heart. A sword shot forward from his waist.

Hiss!

The sound of something being torn open resounded. At the same time, the area ahead was lit up by his sword energy. At this moment, Yang Ye saw a monster.

It seemed human, but its skin was dry, like a mummy. It was around three times the height of a normal person, with very long hands that were practically dragged against the ground. Besides that , Yang Ye saw two rays of sword energy on its feet. They were like chains that nailed it there.

Meanwhile, the mummy suddenly swung a punch.

Boom!

Yang Ye’s sword was blasted away.

Yang Ye caught his sword. The sword was covered in some kind of mysterious dark yellow gas, and it was madly corroding his sword. Unfortunately, they failed to truly corrode his sword and were obliterated by the energy within it instead.

After all, it was Heaven Executor!

However, Yang Ye still felt a strand of lingering fear. The gas from before felt dangerous to him, and if it struck him, he would have probably been corroded in an instant!

His body couldn’t endure it at all!

Yang Ye looked up at the mysterious monster while a solemn expression appeared in his eyes.

Suddenly, the monster leaped up and pounced at him.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. He leaped up, grabbed his sword with both hands, and slashed!

A head-on collision!

He was holding Heaven Executor, so what did he have to fear?

Yang Ye’s sword descended!

Hiss!

Bam!

A figure was blasted away. It was Yang Ye. He was blasted very far away, and a mouthful of blood sprayed from him once he stopped himself!

The mummy’s strength far surpassed his expectations!

Yang Ye looked up at it and spoke solemnly, “What is that monster?”

The woman in black spoke with indifference from within the Primordial Pagoda, “See the sword energy on its feet? They have shackled it, causing it to be only capable of using around 30 or 40% of its strength. If it isn’t shackled by them, then heh…”

30 or 40% of its strength!

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. She’s trying to strike a blow to my confidence on purpose!

However, the monster before him was extremely strong indeed!

Meanwhile, the monster charged at him once more.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. He was about to attack when Erya appeared before him.

She gazed at the monster with indifference, and she suddenly swung a punch when it arrived before her.

Bang!

A resounding explosion resounded, and then a black shadow was blasted away. It was the monster. However, Erya had been pushed around 10m back too!

Of course, Erya had the absolute advantage!

Erya patted her palms together and gazed at the monster while a wisp of disdain arose on her lips, “Trash!”

Snowy suddenly jumped with joy and clapped repeatedly within the wooden house. Obviously, she was cheering for Erya!

Meanwhile, the woman in black glanced at Snowy.

Snowy blinked and slowed down her clapping, but she was still clapping. It was just quite slow. She gazed at the woman in black for quite some time before she cracked a smile and seemed as if she was asking why the woman was looking at her.

The woman’s face twitched. In the end, she moved her gaze away.

She really couldn’t deal with the little fellow!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

The monster didn’t attack again once Erya appeared. It gazed at Erya for a long time, and then it turned around and left. A short while later, it vanished from Yang Ye and Erya’s view.

Erya gazed at Yang Ye, “Big Brother Yang, am I amazing?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Yes, you’re very amazing!”

She nodded with satisfaction and returned to the pagoda.

Yang Ye rubbed his nose, shook his head, and smiled. A short while later, he continued forward, and the monster didn’t appear again.

Some time later, the woman in black’s voice suddenly resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Stop!”

Yang Ye stopped. There was a black vortex ahead. Yang Ye was about to enter it when she suddenly said, “Watch out.”

Yang Ye’s expression changed.

Meanwhile, a powerful suction force suddenly surged out from the vortex.

Yang Ye hurriedly moved back. At the same time, he swung his sword.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy shot forward.

But in just a short while, the sword energy was obliterated by the suction force, and Yang Ye was around 1km away.

As soon as Yang Ye stopped, the space around him shook, and then he noticed that the space here was being fortified repeatedly. In just an instant, it had been fortified to a terrifying degree!

Moreover, ten flags had appeared around him. They were of multiple colors. As soon as they appeared, the entire world underwent a slight change.

It was sealed off!

Yang Ye felt like the entire area around him had been transformed into a sealed off expanse of space.

It was completely sealed off!

In short, the space he resided in was comparable to the End World. Obviously, it was the End World’s doing.

Only they were capable of such extravagance!

Sure enough, a middle aged man walked out of the black vortex. It was the Divine Abode’s master whom he’d fought on multiple occasions!

Moreover, others were emerging from behind him!

In just a short while, there were 12 people by his sides!

Every one of them was at the peak of the Destiny Realm, and he even saw some familiar faces like Shui Wubian…

Meanwhile, Erya appeared by Yang Ye’s side.

She gazed coldly and indifferently at the Divine Abode’s master and the others, but her eyes had turned scarlet red.

She was the most dangerous right now!

The Divine Abode’s master and the others noticed Erya, and deep fear appeared in their eyes. They had experienced how terrifying she was!

Luckily, they were fully prepared!

Meanwhile, two figures appeared out of thin air on either side of Yang Ye and Erya.

They were Tai Huntian and Zuo Mu!

As soon as they appeared, their auras immediately locked onto Erya. Obviously, they were here for her!

Besides that, Yang Ye and Erya still sensed an extremely powerful aura in the surroundings. The owner of it was hidden in the surroundings, but that existence hadn’t concealed their aura.

The Divine Abode’s master gazed at Yang Ye and laughed coldly, “Yang Ye! Oh, Yang Ye! See the space around you? The space here has been fortified, and this area has been concealed from the workings of the heavens. Even if Destiny passed through from above, she still wouldn’t sense anything that’s happening in here. Even God can’t save you now.”

Yang Ye had indifference on his face.

In the Primordial Pagoda and within the wooden house, the woman in black was livid while killing intent surged within her eyes, “You bastards! I’m just going home! Dammit! You deserve death! All of you deserve death!”
