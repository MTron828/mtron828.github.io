Chapter 2660 – Allow Me to Introduce this Sword!

A short while later, there was no movement from the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye’s face was quite unsightly.

She refuses to show herself?

Meanwhile, the auras in the surroundings had arrived before him.

Yang Ye didn’t wait for her and raised his right hand. A moment later, a sword howl resounded.

A sword hall appeared in the air above Yang Ye!

Sword Scroll!

Her main body had been repaired, but Yang Ye had never used it until now. Because he hadn’t had a suitable opportunity. Now, he felt it was a very suitable opportunity.

Along with the appearance of the sword hall, strands of seemingly material sword energy rippled out from it.

There were so many strands of sword energy that even Yang Ye felt shocked.

There was too much!

They could simply be described as being boundless. In just an instant, the entire sky was covered in sword energy!

As for the auras of those experts, they were sliced into bits!

She’s this strong?

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he hurriedly unleashed his dual intents and dual Domains. Once they were enhanced by Yang Ye’s intents and Domains, the sword energy grew even more terrifying!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The entire sky was filled with the horrifying sound of something being sliced open.

It was space that was being sliced open!

The Divine Abode’s master and the others didn’t try to go head-on against the sword energy and retreated instead.

Yang Ye didn’t continue, and he just turned around with the intention of fleeing the End World. Since the woman in black refused to help, his strength was no match for them.

It was best to leave first!

However, a man with a saber appeared in the sky. His eyes were covered by a cloth, and he walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction while ignoring the sword energy around Yang Ye!

It was Zuo Mu!

Zuo Mu stopped, and then his saber was unsheathed by half an inch.

Hiss!

A ray of saber energy flashed through the air, and then Yang Ye’s sword energy collapsed inch by inch.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he put the Sword Hall away.

Zuo Mu walked over to Yang Ye, looked slightly to the side, and then his saber was unsheathed by an inch.

Hiss!

The space before Yang Ye was instantly sliced open, and a ray of saber energy shot at Yang Ye!

Powerful!

That was Yang Ye’s first impression. The man before him was the strongest saber cultivator Yang Ye had ever seen. He was truly incomparably strong!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, and a sword appeared in his grasp.

It wasn’t Heaven Executor, nor was it Past Life. It was the Sword Precursor!

The Sword Precursor that Snowy had repaired.

Yang Ye held his sword in his right hand, and he seemed like he was in a meditative state. The entire world fell silent.

Meanwhile, the ray of saber energy arrived just a few inches away from him.

The saber energy was very calm. It looked very ordinary from the outside, but Yang Ye could sense obliterating force!

A moment of silence ensued.

Yang Ye waved his sword!

The Domain Sword!

This time, Yang Ye’s attack had a different feeling.

Confidence!

Yang Ye didn’t use Heaven Executor or Past Life against Zuo Mu. This meant that he was very confident in himself, and his confidence didn’t come from possessing those two swords that surpassed Super Divine Treasures!

His sword shot forward!

Bam!

An explosion resounded, and Yang Ye was blasted backward repeatedly. He was blasted over 3km away, but the saber energy still hadn’t vanished, and it arrived before him again!

Yang Ye swung his sword once more.

Bang!

The Sword Precursor shook violently in Yang Ye’s grasp, and Yang Ye was instantly blasted 3km away.

However, the saber energy still hadn’t vanished, and it arrived before Yang Ye once more.

There was a long black line behind the saber energy!

The space there had been slashed open!

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and then a ferocious grin appeared there. This time, he grabbed his sword with both hands.

The Domain Sword!

Dual intents and dual Domains!

His sword descended!

Boom!

The saber energy instantly collapsed before him, and Yang Ye was pushed over 300m back!

Blood flowed from the corner of Yang Ye’s mouth!

Yang Ye wiped off the blood and said, “You take a swing of my sword too!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye tapped the tip of his foot against the ground and soared up into the air. A moment later, he appeared out of thin air above Zuo Mu.

At the same time that his sword descended, Zuo Mu’s saber was unsheathed by another inch.

Boom!

Yang Ye was instantly blasted away, but just a moment later, he appeared above Zuo Mu and swung his sword down again.

Zuo Mu moved his head slightly to the side while his saber was unsheathed by another inch.

Boom!

A wave of terrifying saber energy appeared. This time, Yang Ye wasn’t blasted away. His dual Domains and dual intents were there to protect him.

His dual domain and boundless dual intents forcefully suppressed the saber energy.

Meanwhile, Zuo Mu flicked lightly with his thumb.

The saber was drawn by another inch.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s dual intents were blasted into bits at this instant, and then Yang Ye was pushed back to where he’d come from.

Yang Ye was at a disadvantage!

However, the Divine Abode’s master and the others had extremely solemn expressions on their faces.

Yang Ye’s strength was actually this formidable!

They knew Zuo Mu’s strength very well. Even though he was at the peak of the Destiny Realm like them, they couldn’t be compared to him at all. However, Yang Ye was able to exchange a few blows with Zuo Mu!

But Yang Ye had just attained the Destiny Realm!

Such talent and combat strength was extremely terrifying!

Zuo Mu’s saber returned to its sheath, and he gazed at Yang Ye, “Not bad!”

Not bad!

It was a very high evaluation!

Since the ancient times, how many geniuses had he met? He himself was an extraordinary genius, so ordinary people were nothing to him!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. In the end, his gaze descended onto the Divine Abode’s master, “Wanna fight one on one?”

The Divine Abode’s master replied indifferently, “If we can gang up on you, why should I fight you one on one?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

“How shameless!” A voice suddenly came from above.

Yang Ye was relieved when he heard the voice.

That fellow is finally back.

It was Yin Yang Goddess’ voice.

Yin Yang Goddess appeared before Yang Ye, glanced at him, and then looked up at the sky and ridiculed, “Heng Wangu, didn’t expect someone of your status to play such tricks. Shame on you!”

A moment of silence ensued, and then a voice came from high above, “Mr. Yin Yang, you should stay out of the enmity between my End World and him.”

Yin Yang Goddess grinned, “What if I insist?”

A sigh came from the sky, “We don’t want to become enemies with you, but if you insist on becoming enemies with us, then we’ll have no choice but to play with you!”

Yin Yang Goddess spoke coldly, “You want to play? Then let’s play!”

Suddenly, Zuo Mu gazed at Yin Yang Goddess. He wasn’t the only one, many other powerful auras appeared in the surroundings.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Yin Yang Goddess frowned slightly, “What? You intend to gang up on me?”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently by her side, “Senior, did you think they would fight you one on one?”

Yin Yang Goddess shot a glance into the sky, but Heng Wangu remained silent.

Obviously, they were planning on ganging up on her!

Yin Yang Goddess’ face instantly turned cold, “Dammit! All of you are this shameless?”

Heng Wangu suddenly said, “Mr. Yin Yang, you can leave at any time. But he must stay.”

Yang Ye shrugged and remained silent.

Yin Yang Goddess laughed coldly, “That depends on whether you have the ability to do that.”

She gazed at Yang Ye, “You leave first!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Um, I can’t do that.”

Yin Yang Goddess spoke indifferently, “What’s the point of you staying? Since I promised to keep you safe, I will. However, I won’t interfere in your nonsense anymore once we get out of here.”

She’d realized that the enmity between Yang Ye and the End World was absolutely not ordinary. Because Heng Wangu even refused to give her face and insisted on killing Yang Ye. Just that was enough to explain a lot.

Actually, if she knew this would happen, she wouldn’t have asked Yang Ye to lead her here.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Take care!”

He turned around and left.

Suddenly, Zuo Mu was about to draw his saber. However, Yin Yang Goddess abruptly waved her hands. In an instant, a strand of mysterious energy appeared around Yang Ye.

“Suppress!” A voice resounded from the sky, and then a huge invisible palm descended from the sky and pressed down upon the space around Yang Ye.

A wisp of ridicule arose on the corners of Yin Yang Goddess’ mouth, “You think you can suppress my Yin Yang Technique?”

She lowered her palm once she finished speaking.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The space around Yang Ye was torn open, layer by layer. At the same time, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

A voice resounded from the sky, “Pursue him!”

The Divine Abode’s master and the others vanished. Yin Yang Goddess was about to do something about them, but Zuo Mu suddenly appeared before her.

Yin Yang Goddess’ eyes narrowed slightly, “Zuo Mu, you used to be called the number one saber of the world. Let me see for myself!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she charged at him.

Meanwhile, Zuo Mu’s saber was drawn by a few inches…

Yang Ye felt dizzy. A short while later, he shook his head, and his mind cleared up tremendously.

At this moment, he was in the End Dimension.

Yin Yang Goddess had forcefully teleported him out of there!

Yang Ye shot a glance at the teleportation formation behind him, and he wondered if she would be alright.

Yang Ye shook his head and chuckled upon thinking of that. That fellow was an ancient expert, so the End World wouldn’t try to fight her to the death. Because the price they would have to pay was too, too high. Thus, so long as Yin Yang Goddess didn’t court death, she would be safe!

Now, he should worry more about himself!

The space around him suddenly trembled, and then nine powerful auras appeared there!

They were led by the Divine Abode’s master!

Yang Ye shook his head, “Are peak Destiny Realm experts that easy to find?”

The Divine Abode’s master spoke indifferently, “Not really. At least 40 or 50% of all the peak Destiny Realm experts in the world are here. So do you think there are many of them?”

Yang Ye smiled, “All of you really think highly of me!”

The Divine Abode’s master spoke coldly, “Yang Ye, today is the day that everything will come to an end.”

Yang Ye stretched out his hand, and a sword appeared in his grasp.

Heaven Executor!

Yang Ye cracked a smile, “Allow me to introduce this sword, it’s called Heaven Executor!”
