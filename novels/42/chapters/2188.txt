Chapter 2189 – Sages Aren’t Very Strong!

In the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye’s aura was growing stronger and stronger, and a long time passed before it gradually calmed down.

However, it only took a moment for it to start rising madly once more.

Just like that, his aura kept rising and calming down, over and over again.

The Human Dimension, Nature Sacred Ground.

The Sages of the human race were in the hall there, and they were led by Lin Zhen.

The hall was extremely quiet.

A long time passed before Lin Zhen asked, “How is it?”

An old man near him shook his head, “Chaotic! Everyone was already locked in conflict, fighting and stealing from each other. Now that the experts from the Alliance of All have come, it’s even more chaotic now.”

The old man paused for a moment and continued, “Is he really unwilling to return?”

The old man was naturally talking about Yang Ye.

Lin Zhen shook his head, “He won’t return again!”

“Sigh!” The old man sighed, “A single mistake cost us everything.”

Meanwhile, an old man in a luxurious robe stepped forward, “Everyone, the human race is doomed!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

They gazed at him, and the old man spoke solemnly, “Our strength isn’t sufficient to stop the Alliance of All. Presently, all we can do is survive on our own. So, farewell.”

He turned around and left the hall!

They were disbanding!

It didn’t take long for only a few to remain here.

Lin Zhen sat down slowly in silence.

Actually, he’d expected this. The human race didn’t have a leader, and no one was willing to take the position of leader at a time like this. They one who stepped forward at a time like this would definitely be targeted by the Alliance of All.

Moreover, even if someone stepped forward, what difference would it make?

Disband and leave!

That was their choice. It was a choice they had no other choice but to make. If they refused to disband, they still couldn’t do anything. If they united the entire human race, then perhaps they could resist the Alliance of All for some time. However, the human race was in chaos right now. So, uniting the entire human race was something only Yang Ye was capable of accomplishing right now!

Leaving was their best option right now.

A long time passed before Lin Zhen spoke softly, “The human race is doomed!”

…

Void Spirit Continent. In the Primordial Pagoda.

At this moment, Yang Ye was sitting silently on the ground while a tiny golden pagoda floated above him. Little Sky and Tian Xiu were standing not too far away from Yang Ye. Tian Xiu’s arms were around her knees while she rested her chin against her arm and stared at Yang Ye.

Her gaze flickered between one that was icy cold and one that was bewildered.

Little Sky had noticed it, so she gently rubbed Tian Xiu’s head, “A’Xiu, you…”

Tian Xiu gazed at Little Sky. Her gaze was icy cold to the point that Little Sky’s entire body felt cold like she’d fallen into an abyss of ice!

Little Sky was shocked, and she gazed at Tian Xiu with astonishment.

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, “Big Brother is in pain!”

As she spoke, she closed her eyes slowly, “I can sense it! Losing friends and loved ones is very painful!”

Little Sky glanced at Tian Xiu and spoke softly, “A’Xiu, you’re really scary sometimes!”

Tian Xiu looked up at the sky, “I won’t harm all of you!”

Little Sky shook her head slightly, “I’m not afraid that you’ll harm me, I’m afraid that you’ll change. I don’t think your big brother wouldn’t want to see you change.”

Tian Xiu gazed at Yang Ye, and a long time passed before she said, “Big Brother is a good person.”

She suddenly gazed at Little Sky and continued, “You know… If Big Brother chose to give Snowy away in exchange for peace, then I would kill him myself!”

Little Sky’s expression changed. Meanwhile, Tian Xiu suddenly stood up and walked slowly to Yang Ye. She gazed at him, and the icy coldness in her eyes eased up slightly, “But he didn’t. He's still the same big brother I know.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she placed her right hand on Yang Ye’s head. The Primordial Pagoda trembled violently, and a terrifying wave of energy rippled out, but Tian Xiu’s hand didn’t move at all.

Tian Xiu glanced at the Primordial Pagoda, “Your energy isn’t enough, it isn’t enough to help him attain the Sage Realm. Let me help you!”

As soon as she finished speaking, a strand of energy seeped out from her palm and entered Yang Ye. In an instant, a terrifying aura swept out from within Yang Ye. But at this moment, Tian Xiu suddenly clapped her hand lightly, and the terrifying aura vanished without a trace.

After that, Tian Xiu returned to where she’d been just now, sat down, and watched Yang Ye in silence.

Little Sky was shocked beyond words.

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu suddenly gazed at Little Sky, “Big Sister, don’t tell him, alright?”

Little Sky nodded while staring blankly at Tian Xiu.

Just like that, time trickled by, and Yang Ye’s body was soundlessly changing.

Three days later, Yang Lianshuang suddenly entered the Primordial Pagoda and went to Yang Ye. Yang Ye was still meditating on the spot, so she frowned slightly and gazed at Little Sky and Tian Xiu, “How much longer will he take?”

Little Sky shook her head and was about to speak when Tian Xiu suddenly said, “In a moment!”

Yang Lianshuang glanced at Tian Xiu and was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly stood up slowly.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Waves of energy flowed out from him, and a short while passed before Yang Ye waved his right hand lightly. Those waves of energy instantly vanished.

Huff!

Yang Ye slowly let out a mouthful of foul air.

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang gazed at Yang Ye with astonishment, “Y-You’re a Sage now?”

The Sage Realm!

Yang Ye’s strength felt unfathomable to her right now, and she’d never felt that previously. So, she guessed that he was at the Sage Realm now!

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “I’m at the Sage Realm!”

A Sage!

Yang Ye took a deep breath. He hadn’t expected himself to attain the Sage Realm so soon! Based on his estimations, it would take countless years for that to happen. Of course, it was all thanks for the Primordial Pagoda!

If the Primordial Pagoda hadn’t done all it could to help him this time, then it would have really taken him countless years to attain the Sage Realm!

Little Sky glanced at Tian Xiu and remained silent.

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang suddenly asked, “How strong are you now?”

My strength?

Yang Ye clenched his fists slowly, and then he gazed at his right fist and said, “I can kill Sages with ease, even without my sword!”

At this moment, his strength had improved tremendously in all aspects. It wasn’t just his cultivation, even his physical strength had risen tremendously. Now, he was confident that he could kill Sages with ease, even without using his sword!

While he could kill Sages in an instant in the past, he had to use his full strength then. Yet now, he was confident that he could accomplish that with ease!

Suddenly, Tian Xiu said, “Sages aren’t very strong!”

Everyone gazed at her, and she spoke softly, “Big Brother, what do you think?”

Sages aren’t very strong!

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he asked, “Then what do you think is strong? A progenitor?

Tian Xiu stood up and spoke softly, “Progenitors are alright. They have found their own Daos, and they work hard on it. Big Brother, do you know what the Dao is?”

Yang Ye shook his head, walked over to her, and rubbed her little head, “Do you?”

She spoke softly, “There are many explanations. However, the more accurate and accepted explanation is defying the heavens to change your fate!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “Defying the heavens to change your fate?”

Tian Xiu replied softly, “The universe has its laws, the four seasons have their laws, and all other things in the world exist according to certain laws. For example, the four seasons, the rising and receding tide, the rising and setting sun… Big Brother, don’t you think all of these are a type of law?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded, “Yes!”

Tian Xiu asked, “Then do you know why it’s like this? For example, why does the sun rise again after setting?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Tian Xiu spoke softly, “No one knows why. Many will say that it’s the planets and continents circulating as nature intended. However, why do they do that? Moreover, why do they do that in such an orderly manner? No one can explain that. Because there is no answer, they call it destiny, they say that it is determined by the heavens. Everything is determined by the heavens.”

Tian Xiu suddenly looked up at Yang Ye at this point, “So, when we say defying the heavens to change your fate… Big Brother, you can destroy a planet, but can you make the sunrise and sunset go in the opposite direction?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

He couldn’t accomplish that!

Tian Xiu spoke softly, “I don’t know if anyone can accomplish that. Even if someone can, that person is definitely extremely, extremely powerful. The progenitors you speak of have found their own Dao, or to put it in simpler terms, they’ve come into contact with the traces of Destiny. Destiny is the Dao, and it contains many, many things like the laws of all things, the laws of Yin and Yang, and the laws of the universe. They followed along these laws to come into contact with the Dao and the traces of Destiny… They are quite amazing to be capable of accomplishing that!”

Quite amazing…

Everyone here had quite a strange expression on their faces.

Yang Ye rubbed Tian Xiu’s head, “Why do you know so much?”

She looked up at Yang Ye and remained silent.

Yang Ye rubbed her head gently again and said, “It’s fine if you don’t want to say. Tell me when you want to, alright?”

Tian Xiu nodded, and then she lowered her head while the expression in her eyes kept changing.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye gazed at Yang Lianshuang, and the latter spoke solemnly, “The human race is in severe trouble!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “It has nothing to do with me!”

Yang Lianshuang spoke solemnly, “It has something to do with you this time!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Huh?”

Yang Lianshuang spoke solemnly, “Qin Chuan’s clan, they are having a very hard time. Qin Chuan has a younger sister, a sister from the same father and mother. I received information that she has been kidnapped. Currently…”

“Dammit!” Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly spoke fiercely, “I deserve to die!”

He transformed into a ray of blood red light that vanished on the spot.

In the sky above Void Spirit Continent, a ray of blood red light flashed through the sky, and the entire sky instantly turned scarlet red like a horrifying ocean of blood!
