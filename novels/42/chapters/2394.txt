Chapter 2395 – Reversed Bloodline!

The two middle aged men behind the old man had locked onto him with their divine senses.

Obviously, they would attack if he refused.

The old man glanced at the bamboo house and left.

In the bamboo house, A’Leng sat cross-legged on the bamboo bed, and Right Sword and Left Sword weren’t too far away ahead of her.

A’Leng spoke softly, “Tell them to continue searching, and ask the other sects and hidden powers of the continent to help as well. Tell them I asked them to!”

Right Sword hesitated for a moment and said, “Young Master, Yang Ye’s strength may be not bad, but he’s absolutely not a match for you. Since he has Primordial Violet Energy, you can just ask him to hand it over. Why waste so much time?”

A’Leng chuckled, “He’s no ordinary person. Do you think someone who can make all the powers of Eternal Border pursue him is someone who’s easy to bully?”

Eternal Border!

They were shocked. They naturally knew of Eternal Border. It was a place that all the experts of Divine Martial Continent wished to go to!

Left Sword who’d been silent until now suddenly asked, “Young Master, why do they wish to kill him?”

A'Leng grinned, “Because of that white little fellow.”

“That pet?” Right Sword was puzzled, “Besides being a little cute, there’s nothing special about her!”

A'Leng chuckled, but it didn’t take long for her to cough violently. The two women hurriedly offered her medicine, but she waved her hand and said, “She’s not just a little cute. If she truly puts on a show of might in the future, she can destroy Divine Martial Continent in an instant. So, it's not only because he isn’t an ordinary person, it’s also because that little fellow isn’t ordinary either. In order to avoid unnecessary trouble in the future, it’s best to work with him!”

Right Sword wanted to inquire further, but A’Leng waved her hand, “Go do what I asked!”

They didn’t say another word and just bowed slightly to her before leaving.

After he left Cloud Residence with Snowy, Yang Ye headed straight for the Martial Tomb.

In the clouds, Snowy sat on Yang Ye’s shoulder while lightly rubbing her head against his face.

Yang Ye glanced at her, shook his head, and smiled. She was growing more and more intelligent. Earlier, Right Sword had spoken about her being unable to recognize the value of that fruit, and she’d actually remembered that, giving rise to what had happened before they left.

She was a petty little fellow!

Yang Ye looked up at the sky, and there was a trace of worry in his eyes. He knew An Nanjing’s character well. If she could contact him, she would definitely do so.

So, what exactly was she doing?

Was she unable to contact him, or was she too busy to contact him?

Yang Ye shook his head, restrained his thoughts, and sped up.

He shot forward swiftly on his sword, and he stopped around two hours later. He entered a boundless mountain range, and it was like entering a boundless ocean.

Yang Ye wanted to continue flying on his sword, but there was an invisible force above the mountain range, and it stopped him from doing so. Of course, he could fly by force, but he wasn’t that overbearing.

Snowy was looking left and right from his shoulder.

In order to avoid unnecessary trouble, Yang Ye summoned the Primal True Dragon. Its Dragon Pressure could deter many demons in the mountain range. Sure enough, it worked very well, and Yang Ye didn’t even sense a mosquito nearby all along the way.

After traveling for almost two hours through the mountain range, Yang Ye finally stopped, and there was a tombstone before him. There were two characters on it, “武墓”.

The Martial Tomb!

Yang Ye walked over to it. It wasn’t huge, and there was nothing special about it. However, he could sense a faint fluctuation of energy from it.

Yang Ye glanced at Snowy, and she flew over to it and patted it lightly. The tombstone didn’t move at all, so she gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye shrugged to display that he didn’t know anything. She thought for a moment, and then she withdrew the ethereal axe and placed it against the tombstone.

If being nice didn’t work, then force it is!

She’d learned this technique from Yang Ye some time back, and it was really useful!

The tombstone shuddered, and then a wave of fluctuations came from within it.

Snowy blinked, and then she looked up at Yang Ye and waved her paws. She was telling him that the tombstone was asking what they wanted!

What they wanted!

Yang Ye had quite a weird expression on his face because the tombstone was really alive!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Ask it if it’s willing to go with us!”

Snowy looked down at the tombstone and patted it lightly before pointing at herself. Obviously, she was asking if it was willing to go with her! Meanwhile, she seemed to have thought of something, and she blew lightly. In an instant, a strand of extremely pure spirit energy surged into the tombstone, and it shook violently in response.

The tombstone fell silent for a long time, and then a wave of fluctuations came from it!

Snowy looked up at Yang Ye and cracked a smile before patting the tombstone. In an instant, it moved over to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye smiled when he witnessed this.

It was willing to go with them!

It had willingly chosen to leave with Yang Ye and Snowy!

Yang Ye placed his hand on it, and it felt icy cold to the touch. He grabbed it with his right hand and was about to lift it, yet he noticed to his shock that he was actually incapable of doing so!

At this moment, a solemn expression instantly covered his face!

It was so heavy!

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while, and then he grabbed it between his arms and started to exert force. Not only did he use his profound energy, he used his Profound Primal Energy too. The tombstone gradually started to move. At the same time, it started to leave the ground, and as soon as it left the ground, Yang Ye’s face flushed red. Moreover, the veins on his arms bulged like little snakes! It was a shocking sight!

Three breaths of time later, Yang Ye released it.

The tombstone crashed to the ground!

Thud!

The ground shook violently, and countless mountains in the surroundings shook violently as well. It was like someone had slammed a heavy blow against them.

A treasure!

Yang Ye glanced at his hands, and they were completely red. It was because he’d overexerted himself.

He gazed at the tombstone again, and there was a wisp of excitement in his eyes. He knew it wasn’t ordinary!

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something and gazed at Snowy, “Ask if it belongs to someone else.”

Even though he wanted such a treasure, he had his principles. If it belonged to someone, then he wouldn’t take it, even if it was willing to go with him. He could be shameless against his enemies, but he wouldn’t do that under normal circumstances.

Snowy blinked and gazed at it, and then she waved her paws swiftly. A short while later, she gazed at Yang Ye and started to convey what the tombstone had told her!

It did!

An old man had placed it here in the past. However, the old man was gone. It had been many, many years since it had been placed here, and the old man had never returned. So, it had no owner now!

Yang Ye smiled and was just about to put it away when Erya appeared by his side. Yang Ye and Snowy gazed at her, and she gazed at the tombstone instead. She walked over to it, glanced at it, and then patted it lightly, “Big Brother Yang, I want this thing!”

Yang Ye was stunned.

Snowy blinked and gazed at Yang Ye.

She didn’t mind because no matter who got it, it would return to her if she wanted it!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Erya, this thing is really heavy!”

“Heavy?” Erya blinked, looked down at it, and then grabbed it at the corner. After that, Yang Ye watched with astonishment as she lifted it with one hand!

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Erya twirled it around, and then gazed at him, “Big Brother Yang, it isn’t that heavy!”

Yang Ye smiled embarrassedly, “Yes, it isn’t. Since you like it, it’s yours!”

She cracked a smile, “Thank you!”

“Erya!” Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Why do you want this thing?”

She patted it and said, “Oxxy has a weapon now, and I want one too. Moreover, it gives me a special feeling like I’ve seen it before!”

“You’ve seen it?” Yang Ye frowned, “What do you mean?”

She shook her head, “I don’t know either!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Meanwhile, Snowy flew over to Erya and placed her paw on Erya’s head. There were two small pitch black horns there!

Horns!

Yang Ye gazed at those horns too and asked, “Erya, what are those?”

She shook her head, “I don’t know!”

Yang Ye felt speechless because she knew nothing!

Meanwhile, Erya patted the tombstone and smiled, “Not bad, not bad indeed. Hmm, I’m going to spar with Oxxy. Let’s see if his axe or my rock is stronger!”

She grabbed the tombstone and entered the Primordial Pagoda!

Spar with Oxxy? Actually, Oxxy was against it. Unfortunately, Oxxy couldn’t refuse!

Yang Ye ignored them. He would have to dissuade Erya if she went for the Primal True Dragon. Because they really didn’t get along. So, if she went to spar with it, she may really kill it. However, he wasn’t worried if she was sparring with Oxxy because Oxxy had some status in her heart.

Yang Ye took Snowy in his arms and walked toward the depths of the mountain range. But he hadn’t even gone far before a wave of invisible energy pressed down upon him. At the same time, a voice came from deep within the mountain range, “You even took my tombstone! You’re terrible! Hmm, that little girl from before… How inconceivable, she actually possesses that bloodline. This little fellow too, isn’t this a Sprite Progenitor? Eh? Your bloodline! Tsk, tsk, you were actually able to reverse your bloodline. Interesting!”

Yang Ye was stunned.
