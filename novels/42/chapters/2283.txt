Chapter 2284 – One With the Sword!

Deal with her!

Yang Ye gazed at the woman in a linen dress, hesitated for a moment, and said, “Can we go inside?”

“No!” The woman didn’t even look up at them.

Yang Ye’s face fell, “What if I insist?”

Suddenly, she stopped sweeping and gazed at Yang Ye. A moment later, she grabbed the huge sword behind her, and then she dashed over to Yang Ye.

The huge sword was dragged against the ground, causing sparks to spray.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he grabbed the hilt of his sword with his right hand.

The woman’s speed could be described as being very slow, like the speed of an ordinary person. However, Yang Ye’s face gradually became solemn. The closer she came to him, the stronger the pressure that assaulted his face. In the end, he was on the verge of being suffocated.

It was extremely strong pressure!

Yang Ye suddenly drew his sword and swung it.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy flashed.

Suddenly, the woman’s body left the ground by around 1m, and then she slammed her sword down.

Bang!

The huge sword slammed down, and Yang Ye was blasted over 30km away.

Yang Ye glanced at his right hand, and there was astonishment in his eyes. His arm and half his body was numb, he couldn’t feel them at all.

Her strength was simply unprecedented!

Suddenly, Yang Ye looked up, and the woman appeared before him. At this moment, the huge sword was on her back, and a sword that was fine as a hair was in her grasp.

Ray of light flashed!

Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically, and then he activated the Sword Domain. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Strands of blood sprayed, but the woman was already back where she’d been standing. The fine sword had vanished from her grasp, and it was replaced by a broom.

Yang Ye stood in midair with around 10 injuries around his body.

His face was unprecedentedly solemn as he gazed at her.

How fast had her sword been? It was so fast that he couldn’t sense it at all. If it wasn’t for the Sword Domain, he would have died for sure. Because the woman’s speed was too fast for him to react to!

Shock!

It was the first time he’d met someone with such powerful strength and such agile speed. The ability to crush everything with strength or overcome everything with speed, she had it both!

Meanwhile, the woman in red clothes by Yang Ye’s side suddenly said, “She hasn’t used sword intent yet.”

Yang Ye’s face froze. He glanced at her, and at this moment, he recalled that she hadn’t utilized sword intent at all just now!

Meanwhile, the woman in a linen dress gazed at the woman in red clothes, “Sword Scroll, he’s the one you selected?”

The woman in red clothes nodded, “What do you think?”

The woman in a linen dress glanced at Yang Ye, “Acceptable.”

Sword Scroll grinned, “Give me some face and evaluate him, alright?”

The woman in a linen dress pondered deeply for a moment and said, “Strength that doesn’t conform to his age. Such strength at such an age is rarely seen in the world.”

Sword Scroll looked the woman in the eyes, “Flaws!”

The woman fell silent for a while and replied, “A little impulsive, and messy. His sword is messy, and his heart even more. If he can abandon all these distracting thoughts and make his heart one with his sword, his strength will rise a level higher.”

Sword Scroll gazed at Yang Ye, and Yang Ye bowed slightly to the woman in a linen dress, “Thank you for your guidance, Senior.”

The woman in a linen dress glanced at Yang Ye, “Very good mentality that’s rarely seen.”

Sword Scroll couldn’t help but glance at Yang Ye, and there was a trace of praise and surprise in her eyes.

Both Sword Scroll and the woman in a linen dress were quite surprised by Yang Ye’s attitude. Young geniuses like Yang Ye were absolutely proud and arrogant, and they were the type who never acknowledged anyone else’s strength. But they were surprised. Not only did Yang Ye show no displeasure toward her evaluation, he accepted it humbly instead. That surprised both of them, and it was why the woman in a linen dress had said that Yang Ye’s mentality was very good and rarely seen.

Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “Senior, what did you mean by making my heart one with the sword? Please provide me with your guidance!”

The woman in a linen dress glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Focus. When you swing, you focus on swinging the sword, when you strike, you focus on the sword striking. If while you swing, you think of striking; and when you strike, you think of the next attack, your heart will be messy. A messy heart will make a messy sword. If you keep thinking about everything, it may very likely have been for naught. One is one, two is two, do you understand what I mean?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand!”

Messy!

He truly understood what that meant now. It could be said that he’d achieved instant enlightenment at this moment. Just as the woman had said, his heart was in quite a mess while he attacked. When he attacked, he should do everything he could to bring forth its strength and speed, and not consider the next attack or anything else. It was what the woman meant when she spoke about focus!

Focus!

It wasn’t a great principle, and it was a principle that any new cultivator was aware of. However, the more insignificant it seemed, the easier it was to overlook.

Meanwhile, Sword Scroll spoke abruptly, “I’m here for that.”

The woman in a linen dress pondered deeply for a moment and said, “Can he control it?”

Sword Scroll replied, “Let him try!”

The woman fell silent for a long time and said, “He may die!”

Sword Scroll gazed at Yang Ye, “Are you afraid of death?”

Yang Ye nodded seriously, “I am!”

Sword Scroll was stunned speechless.

The woman in a linen dress glanced at Yang Ye in silence.

Suddenly, Yang Ye asked, “Can it improve my strength?”

Sword Scroll nodded, “It can improve your sword intent by a realm for a short while, and even if your sword intent is at the True Dao Realm, it can still improve your sword intent by a realm. Even if your sword intent is above the True Dao Realm, it can still improve your sword intent by a realm.”

Yang Ye’s expression changed, “Such a divine treasure exists?”

Sword Scroll nodded, “Yes! But do you dare to take it?”

Yang Ye asked, “Is it very dangerous?”

She nodded, “Extremely dangerous. So, do you dare to risk it?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded, “Yes, a man has to take risks in life, right?”

She nodded, “Go inside.”

Yang Ye asked, “What about you?”

She replied, “I’ll be there in a while.”

Yang Ye glanced at her, and then he was about to fly off on his sword into the boundless mountain range. However, she suddenly said, “Walk. It’ll be beneficial to you!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and then he started walking into the distance.

Once Yang Ye vanished into the mountain range, the woman in a linen dress suddenly said, “There’s something dangerous within him.”

“The Primordial Axe of Creation!” The Sword Scroll continued, “It should be that.”

The woman in a linen dress gazed at her, “He’s even more difficult to control than the Limitless Sword Master.”

Sword Scroll closed her eyes slowly, “No one is more suitable than him. Even if there’s someone better, I don’t have the time to wait anymore.”

The woman in a linen dress shook her head slightly, “Why don’t you let it go?”

Sword Scroll replied indifferently, “My body was destroyed, and then I was exiled. If that happened to you, would you be able to let that go?”

The woman in a linen dress shook her head, “You helped me all those years ago, so let me say a little more. He’s a ruthless person, more ruthless than the Limitless Sword Master. Most importantly, he possesses numerous divine treasures, he’s a person with great karmic luck. If you fail, he…”

“I have no other choice!” Sword Scroll continued, “I either succeed or die trying!”

The woman in a linen dress nodded, “Be careful of that axe.”

She turned around and left.

Sword Scroll remained silent on the spot.
