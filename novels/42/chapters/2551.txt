Chapter 2552

Flee!

With the boost he obtained from Flash and his bloodline, Yang Ye’s speed could be truly described as being at his peak!

He was like a ray of light flashing through the air!

Around two hours later, Yang Ye stopped at a mountain range, entered it, and concealed himself completely.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged in the cultivation room and madly utilized Primordial Violet Energy to heal himself.

However, not long after he sat down, the black robed men had appeared not too far away from where he was in the outside world!

Yang Ye was shocked and hurriedly left the pagoda!

As soon as he left the Primordial Pagoda, two rays of black energy descended from above toward him!

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. He didn’t try to fight back and just transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky!

The two auras followed closely behind him!

Yang Ye frowned in midair as he wondered how they had found him!

After all, he was concealing himself with the Sword Domain!

While he didn’t know how they’d accomplished that, Yang Ye had learned something from this, and it was that the Sword Domain wasn’t truly all-powerful!

Moreover, he realized that the Soul Sect was stronger than he’d imagined!

Because he had the boost from Flash and his bloodline, the black robed men weren’t able to catch up to him. But Yang Ye wasn’t able to create distance with them either!

They maintained a certain distance between each other!

However, Yang Ye’s secret technique would lose its effect soon!

Once the effects of the secret technique faded, those black robed men would catch up in an instant. Moreover, once the secret technique faded, his body and soul would be at their weakest, so he would be no match for them!

While Oblivion Maiden, the Primal True Dragon, and the others were in the Primordial Pagoda, they wouldn’t be of much help!

Asking them to join the battle would only end in meaningless sacrifice!

Those black robed men were truly too strong, and even he wasn’t able to resist them, let alone the others?

Flee!

However, Yang Ye didn’t flee in the Ancient Sword Sect’s direction!

Fleeing toward the Ancient Sword Sect was very dangerous because they would certainly think that he would flee in that direction. Thus, it was very likely that they would send experts to obstruct his path!

Thus, Yang Ye didn’t flee toward the sect, he fled to the War Dimension!

The War Dimension!

Yang Ye used a teleportation talisman and arrived there. However, he was shocked to see the black robed men appear there as well!

They had teleportation talismans to the War Dimension too!

What did that represent?

It represented that they were from the War Dimension in the past!

Just thinking about it gave Yang Ye a good understanding of their strength. After all, the War Dimension boasted the highest quality of experts.

Yang Ye entered War City!

War City was still under the demon race’s control, and there were numerous powerful demons hidden within the city. Because Yang Ye sneaked in and had the Sword Domain to conceal his presence, he hadn’t alarmed any experts of the demon race!

However, those black robed men were stopped by two powerful auras upon arriving before the city!

An old man appeared in the air above the city walls and glanced at them, “The Soul Sect?”

One of them nodded.

The old man stated indifferently, “Your War Dimension’s identity?”

Meanwhile, one of the black robed men flicked a pitch black command token to the old man.

The old man gazed at the command token for a long time before he gazed back at them, “So it’s both of you. You’re actually from the Soul Sect. I’m truly surprised!”

They didn’t offer any response!

The old man didn’t say another word and just vanished on the spot.

The War Dimension had its own enmities, and so long as these enmities didn’t affect the foundation of the War Dimension, then they would just ignore it all!

Just like this very moment! Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Once he’d verified that they were part of the War Dimension, the old man didn’t pay any further attention to them.

An identity from the outside world was useless here. If they were unable to prove their identity as a part of the War Dimension, they would be immediately kicked out. It was the same for Yang Ye.

Yet now, they were members of the War Dimensions, so no one could drive them out!

Once Yang Ye entered the city, he immediately went to the underground trade area, and then he sat down cross-legged and placed some things on the ground.

A short while later, those two black robed men arrived here.

Even though Yang Ye was wearing a black robe, they still were able to immediately lock onto him.

Yang Ye remained indifferent as he focused on healing.

He needed to heal up first!

It wouldn’t take long, just around two hours at most!

It could be said that because he had Primordial Violet Energy, the side-effects of secret techniques could be practically ignored. Of course, if it was anyone else, then such a secret technique would take days to recover from!

The powerful auras emanated by the two black robed men enveloped Yang Ye, and the others in the surroundings immediately gazed at the experts of the Soul Sect.

Were they going to attack?

Everyone here was quite surprised because fighting was prohibited here!

The experts from the Soul Sect hadn’t just released their auras, countless strands of black energy had appeared around them…

They were really about to attack!

Some of the people here left, but some stayed.

Obviously, they planned to watch the show!

Suddenly, Zhu Yuanxuan, whom Yang Ye had met the other day, appeared here.

Zhu Yuanxuan could be considered as the person in charge of this area!

Zhu Yuanxuan walked over to them and asked, “Are you planning on fighting here?”

One of them pointed at Yang Ye, “Him!”

Zhu Yuanxuan glanced at Yang Ye. While Yang Ye was wearing a black robe, he still recognized Yang Ye, and felt quite the headache strike him!

He knew Yang Ye was using this place as a shelter!

Zhu Yuanxuan walked over to Yang Ye and laughed bitterly, “Brother Ye…”

“I’m here to sell stuff!” Yang Ye suddenly said, “What? I can’t sell here?”

Zhu Yuanxuan glanced at Yang Ye, and there were three swords before Yang Ye. All of them were divine treasures!

Zhu Yuanxuan hesitated for a moment and asked, “What’s the price?”

Yang Ye replied, “Three Worldborn Fruits each! It’s fixed!”

Zhu Yuanxuan’s face darkened!

Three Worldborn Fruits!

It wasn’t that these swords weren’t worth such a price, the issue was that such fruits were practically extinct! The only one they had had been sold to them by Yang Ye...

Zhu Yuanxuan laughed bitterly, “Sect Master Ye, we don’t wish to interfere in the enmity between your sect and the Soul Sect, so please…”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand! You’re afraid of the Soul Sect, so you dare not let me sell things here. Right?”

Zhu Yuanxuan felt speechless.

But Yang Ye packed up and said, “It’s alright. If you refuse to let me sell here, I’ll leave. But… Sigh, I never expected you to fear the Soul Sect! Alas, don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone about it. I definitely won’t. I guarantee it on the character of the Soul Sect’s Master!”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away.

Zhu Yuanxuan’s face was absolutely unsightly, and a short while passed before he said, “Sect Master Ye, please wait!”

Yang Ye stopped and gazed at him, “What is it? Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone. Don’t you know what kind of person I am?”

Zhu Yuanxuan smiled, “Sect Master Ye, you must be joking. How could I prohibit you from selling here? You can sell as you wish!”

Yang Ye asked, “Really?”

Zhu Yuanxuan smiled, “Of course!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Then I will!”

Yang Ye sat down cross-legged and placed the swords before him.

While he called it selling these swords, he was actually healing!

Those experts from the Soul Sect naturally understood that. So, they planned to attack after seeing Zhu Yuanxuan make a compromise.

Zhu Yuanxuan’s face turned cold when he noticed this, and then two old men appeared behind him.

They instantly obstructed those two experts of the Soul Sect!

Their auras weren’t any weaker to the experts from the Soul Sect!

The atmosphere here was slightly stiff!

Meanwhile, Zhu Yuanxuan suddenly said, “We prohibit fighting here during business hours. So, you can deal with your business once we’ve closed. It’s just two hours away from the end of our business hours. You should be able to wait that long, right?”

Zhu Yuanxuan naturally wouldn’t fight them to the death. They didn’t want to get involved in the conflict between Yang Ye and the Soul Sect!

The experts from the Soul Sect fell silent for a short while, and then they nodded!

Two hours!

They were willing to wait that long!

Similarly, they didn’t want to fight this underground trade organization to death because while they didn’t fear it, it wasn’t worth it!

Yang Ye would be the one who benefitted if something like that really happened!

Zhu Yuanxuan nodded slightly when he saw them agree, and then he glanced at Yang Ye, “Good luck, Sect Master Ye!”

He vanished with the two old men.

Some of the other black robed figures in the surroundings left, and only Yang Ye and the two black robed men remained here!

Yang Ye ignored them and continued recuperating.

The experts from the Soul Sect didn’t attack. They were waiting for the moment this trade area’s business hours were up!

Time trickled by, and it didn’t take long for two hours to pass.

The black robed men were about to attack when a black robed figure suddenly arrived at the street. Or to be more precise, the black robed man arrived before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye looked up at the black robed man, and the latter said, “How much is this sword?”

Yang Ye was stunned.

It was a very familiar voice!
