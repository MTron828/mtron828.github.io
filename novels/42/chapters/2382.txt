Chapter 2383 – I Don’t Like It!

Kill!

He wasn’t a magnanimous person, and he always treated people the same way they treated him.

Kindness had to be repaid a hundredfold, and enmity had to be repaid a hundredfold too!

Yang Ye sent the Primal Vicious Tiger back into the Primordial Pagoda, and then he walked toward the exit with Nanli Meng.

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something as they walked and gazed at her, “There should be a power supporting you too, right?”

“The Southern Villa.” She explained softly, “An organization that focuses on gathering intelligence. It has information on all the worlds. Of course, it’s the major events of those worlds. For example, the war between the undying race and void spirit race of the large universe. We gained information about it quite some time in advance.”

Yang Ye asked, “What’s your status in it?”

Nanli Meng smiled, “An Honorary Elder without any real authority. Actually, we’re just using each other.”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Were they among those who attacked Tian Xiu?”

She shook her head, “No.”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, and she shook her head and chuckled, “I’m not lying. They really weren’t. While they covet your Snowy too, they didn’t go to extremes.”

Yang Ye asked, “Who participated then?”

She hesitated for a moment and sighed softly, “Vengeance never ends. How about I help you mediate between them. You can all sit down and have a chat.”

“Chat about it?” Yang Ye grinned, “How?”

She said, “Allow me to be honest, your current strength does completely crush those ordinary Limitbreaker Realm experts outside, but they have existed for countless years, so they still have some resources and reserves. Moreover, their real experts are at the Eternal River, and they are on the way back. Seriously, if you choose to fight, this slaughter will go on for very, very long.”VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

She paused for a moment and continued, “There’s the Guardians too. They won’t take your side!”

Yang Ye said, “They joined the attack on Tian Xiu, right?”

She nodded, “They did.”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “As the Guardians of Eternal Border, shouldn’t they be fair?”

Nanli Meng replied, “They are, at many times. However, it depends on the person they face too. I’m sure you’re aware that there’s no absolute fairness in the world!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand!”

He stopped at this point because the exit was right before him.

Nanli Meng looked at Yang Ye, “Are you really going to take this path? I can tell you for a fact that if you do take this path, it will bring you on a road of endless slaughter. It’s no different than fighting all the strongest powers in Eternal Border.”

Yang Ye walked over to her, “Is it I who wish to fight them, or is it they who wish to fight me? As for what you spoke about meditating, you should know very well that they won’t accept it. Unless I kill until blood flows into rivers and corpses cover the world, and once they find that they are no match for me, only then will they be willing to negotiate with me and seek peace. Right?”

She gazed at him for a long time before shaking her head and sighing, “Good luck!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she walked out of the door and vanished.

Only Yang Ye remained here.

Yang Ye roared with laughter and left with his sword in hand.

A ray of light flashed, and then Yang Ye appeared outside. He glanced at the surroundings and soared up into the air.

However, it didn’t take long for an old man to appear before him.

Yang Ye didn’t recognize the old man.

The old man glanced at him, “I didn’t expect you to be so daring to actually dare to return to Eternal Border!”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “What’s your name?”

The old man laughed coldly, “I’m the Vice Sect Master of the Creation Sect, Mo Xian.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he appeared before the old man and drew his sword from its sheath.

Heavenrend!

It was Heavenrend! A technique Yang Ye hadn’t used in a very long time!

At the instant his sword was drawn, the world turned ethereal.

Heavenrend focuses upon explosive force. It relied on speed and ferocity. But in order to accomplish that, a strong body was required, and he didn’t just possess a strong body now, he had Profound Primal Energy too. Besides that, his control of energy far surpassed what it had ever been. It could be said that his current Heavenrend far surpassed the Heavenrends he executed in the past.

As soon as Yang Ye swung his sword, Mo Xian’s expression changed drastically. At this moment of danger, he stomped his right foot down and shot backward. However, no matter how he shot back, there was always a sword descending from above him.

At this moment, Mo Xian panicked.

He clenched his right fist.

Crack!

The space around his fist exploded apart, and then he slammed his fist at Yang Ye.

The strength of a world!

His fist could destroy a world.

The sword and fist collided.

Bang!

An explosion resounded and the old man’s right arm was instantly obliterated. At the same time, he was blasted away.

Suddenly, a ray of sword energy flashed!

Hiss!

It shot through the old man’s stomach!

The old man’s eyes opened wide while disbelief filled them.

Yang Ye’s attack had only carried the strength to destroy a single world, but it was much, much stronger than the strength to destroy a world which he possessed.

There was a talisman in the old man’s grasp. He wanted to crush it and notify his sect of Yang Ye’s strength. Unfortunately, he wasn’t even able to crush it before a ray of sword energy sliced his body into bits!

Yang Ye sheathed his sword and left.

The Sword Ruins.

Yang Ye came to the Sword Ruins again. Jian You was seated before a tree, and a huge sword was by her side!

Suddenly, she opened her eyes and looked to the side. Yang Ye was there.

She sized up Yang Ye and asked, “You’re been to the Northern Sword Sect?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She fell silent for a short while and asked, “Do you know why it was annihilated?”

Yang Ye nodded, “A little.”

She gazed at him and waited silently for him to explain.

Yang Ye explained, “Its sect master flaunted his ability too much. In short, it was done by the experts from the Eternal Universe.”

The Eternal Universe!

Jian You fell silent for a long time, and then she looked into the depths of the Sword Ruins, “Actually, my clan guessed so. Because that sword is very likely to have come from the Eternal Universe.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “What do you plan to do now?”

Yang Ye smiled, “What do you think I should do?”

She fell silent.

What should he do?

Because of Snowy, it could be said that reconciliation was impossible between Yang Ye and those other powers. Unless Yang Ye was willing to give Snowy to them. So long as he did that, they would definitely not pursue him further.

No one was willing to offend Yang Ye for no reason right now!

But would Yang Ye give them Snowy?

The answer was an absolute no!

Jian You shook her head slightly, “Good luck!”

She closed her eyes slowly once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye nodded, “No matter what happens, thank you for helping me in the past. Feel free to ask if you need my help.”

Jian You fell silent for a short while before she said, “Alright!”

Yang Ye didn’t say anything else and just left.

Jian You sighed softly on the spot.

Yang Ye hadn’t gone far before an old man in a black robe appeared in front of him. At the same time, a wave of powerful aura obstructed Yang Ye’s path.

Yang Ye stopped and had a calm expression on his face. It was because he was well aware that from the moment he’d openly left the Primal Battlefield, trouble would come for him!

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “I’m a Guardian.”

A Guardian?

Yang Ye glanced at the old man. He hadn’t expected the Guardians to be the first to come for him.

A smile arose on Yang Ye’s lips, “What? Do you need something?”

The old man spoke indifferently, “You possess the strength of the Limitbreaker Realm. According to the rules, you cannot stay in Eternal Border.”

“Rules?” Yang Ye walked slowly toward the old man, “Tell me, who made those rules?”

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Yang Ye, these rules were set during the Primal Era. Everyone must follow them. Don’t overestimate yourself!”

“Overestimate myself?” Yang Ye stopped and grinned, “Don’t speak about the rules to me. So many Limitbreaker Realm experts attacked Tian Xiu that day. Where were you then? Did you care about the rules? Of course, I understand. The rules have always had a double standard. The rules are for others, not yourselves. I understand, I really do.”

Yang Ye suddenly appeared in front of the old man.

His sword left its sheath!

A sword howl resounded, and then a brilliant ray of sword energy lit up the sky.

The old man’s expression changed drastically as he shot backward repeatedly. But the sword energy refused to stay away from him!

At the critical moment, the old man disregarded everything in this moment of horror, and his profound energy surged out while a golden barrier appeared above him.

Defense!

At this moment, he could only think of putting up a defense! Because Yang Ye’s attack far surpassed his expectations, and it wasn’t something he could resist at all.

The sword descended!

Bang!

The golden barrier instantly shattered, and the old man was blasted away. Meanwhile, another ray of sword energy flashed, and then a sword pressed against the old man’s forehead.

The old man looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Yang Ye, I’m a Guardian here. If you kill me…”

Hiss!

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s sword stabbed forward.

It pierced through the old man’s forehead, and blood sprayed!

The old man’s eyes opened wide. I’m dead? Yang Ye really dares to kill a Guardian?!

Yang Ye sheathed his sword and spoke softly, “I don’t like this rule. So, from this moment onward, it has no reason to exist!”
