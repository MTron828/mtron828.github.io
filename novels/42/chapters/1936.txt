Chapter 1937 – I Dare Not Stop Master’s Aura!

The sky race’s protector!

Needless to say, the old man shocked Yang Ye. The sky race wasn’t a small clan, it was an entire race of beings. Moreover, it was a powerful race. Yang Ye was frankly insignificant before the entire sky race.

So, how could he be their protector?

He didn’t have the ability to do that! Moreover, he was human. Based on the sky race’s awful attitude towards humans, they would never allow a human to be their protector!

The old man seemed to be aware of Yang Ye’s thoughts and added, “You think your strength isn’t sufficient, right?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Senior, this isn’t just an issue of strength. Don’t forget that I’m human!”

“Human!” The old man chuckled.

Yang Ye asked, “What?”

The old man smiled, “There was once an extremely powerful race of beings. They were blessed by nature and stood above all other races. As far as they were concerned, all other races were lowly when compared to them. However, there was once a human who became their leader!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Senior, are you talking about the god race?”

The old man nodded slightly, “Every race in this world will never refuse the strong. So long as you’re strong, it doesn’t matter what race you’re from, you will still receive their respect or fear. If you’re strong enough, my sky race will wish for nothing more than to see you stay!”

Yang Ye smiled and said, “Senior, I don’t understand. Why do you think that I can become the sky race’s protector?”

The old man replied, “Just your ability to get here safely is sufficient to prove many things!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and asked, “Let me be frank. Why should I become the sky race’s protector?”

The old man smiled and pointed outside the Sky Stairs, “There’s something over there that’s absorbing your Vitality Star. It might not take long for you to die because of it.”

As he spoke, he waved his right hand, and the small white dragon above him flew down in front of him, “This is the Sky Dragon, it was a True Dragon, but it absorbed over a million spirit veins to transform into a Sky Dragon. If you have it with you, you’ll be invulnerable to all evil!”

Yang Ye asked, “Can the Sky Dragon counter that thing out there?”

“No, but it can stop that thing out there for some time.” The old man continued, “Even I can’t see through it, but I think it’s probably not something that was made by someone. It's a treasure that was born naturally.” He sized up Yang Ye and asked, “How did you get mixed up with it?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. Actually, he’d guessed what that thing was.

The Evil Artifact!

It was definitely the weapon of evil that the Sage had sealed in that city. He hadn’t paid much attention to it that day, and he hadn’t expected it to actually be so terrifying. It could even injure a Saint. It wouldn’t be a problem if it entered his body, but the problem was that it didn’t dare to get close to him at all!

Obviously, it sensed danger coming from him!

“The Sky Dragon comes with many benefits!” Meanwhile, the old man continued, “If you’re able to fuse perfectly with it, you’ll be able to achieve Draconification and possess the strength, roar, and body of the Sky Dragon. Let me explain it in simpler terms. If you’re able to fuse perfectly with it right now, then even Sages won’t be able to kill you while you’re draconified. Besides that, there are many other benefits!”

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, you’re from the sky race, so why don’t you give it to one of the geniuses of the sky race?”

The old man shook his head, “No genius from the sky race can come here.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

His intuition told him that if he accepted it, then he would definitely face quite a bit of trouble. But while it would be quite a bit of trouble, it was very beneficial to him too.

It was beneficial and troublesome at the same time!

In the end, Yang Ye nodded. As far as he was concerned, he should ignore the trouble for now and reap the benefits!

The Sky Emperor grinned when he saw this. He looked at the white dragon with a complicated gaze, and then he flicked. The white dragon transformed into a ray of white light that entered Yang Ye’s head.

Yang Ye’s body shook, and then white energy appeared around him.

“Merge!” The old man said, “It has just entered your body and hasn’t merged with you yet. So, you’re unable to share its strength right now, and you can’t share its life as well. The merging is divided into three parts, the body, the spirit, and the soul. Every single part will give you a qualitative increase in strength. Take your time to slowly figure everything out!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly and gazed at the old man, “Does the sky race know that you’re alive?”

The old man smiled, “No. Why? You want to ask them to save me?”

Yang Ye replied, “If you want, I can notify them!”

The old man shook his head, “They don’t have the ability to do it, and they won’t.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

The old man smiled, “Everything is replaced under new leadership. The sky race isn’t the same anymore. If I leave this place, what would the current Sovereign of Sky do?”

Yang Ye was quite disappointed. This old man was clearly not related to the current Sovereign of Sky. In other words, the Sovereign of Sky out there may not be willing to give the old man face at all. As for the reason he was disappointed, it was because it would be difficult for him to meet Xiao Qi and Zi’er.

“There’s one more thing!” Meanwhile, the old man flicked a fist-sized dragon-shaped seal to Yang Ye.

“The Sovereign of Sky’s Seal!” The old man explained, “It doesn’t have any real abilities, and it’s just a symbol of status. Even though I perished here, some who followed me all those years ago should have survived until now. So, this seal may be able to help you in the future!”

Yang Ye didn’t refuse it and put it away. He said, “Senior, if there’s nothing else, then I have to leave!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The old man nodded, “Go on!”

Yang Ye cupped his fists to the old man and left.

Around 10 breaths of time after Yang Ye left, a voice suddenly resounded, “You old bastard! How dare you spoil things for me!”

The voice was vicious and carried bone-piercing coldness.

The old man glanced indifferently towards its source, “If I wasn’t trapped here, killing you would only take a wave of my hand!”

“Stop boasting!” The voice laughed coldly, “If I wasn’t sealed and suppressed by him all those years ago to the point my core was damaged, I can fucking fight 10 people like you!”

The white robed old man fell silent for a few moments and said, “You’re a naturally born treasure that had cultivated a consciousness of your own. It’s truly a rare achievement. So, allow me to say a few extra words. The person you’re trying to attach yourself to carries great karma and fortune. I’m afraid it won’t end well for you!”

“I wouldn’t have chosen him if he didn’t have all of that!” The voice laughed coldly, “Devouring his fortune and Vitality Star isn’t just able to help me recover rapidly, it’ll allow my strength to rise rapidly as well. Yet now, you’ve given that dragon to him, and that dragon can ward off evil! Unfortunately, it’s just a slightly larger worm, and it won’t take long for me to tear it apart!”

Meanwhile, the old man suddenly asked, “Why don’t you just attach yourself directly to him?”

The voice fell silent.

The old man chuckled and didn’t say another word. Because the owner of the voice had left.

The old man stood on the spot for some time before he suddenly said, “Throughout these years, you’ve never allowed anyone to come before me, but he has. Why?”

A long moment of silence ensued, and then a voice resounded, “I dare not stop one who carries master’s aura!”

Master’s aura!

The old man’s pupils constricted.

…

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was at the center of the stairway. There weren’t many people left here.

He didn’t stay a moment longer. He left and went to Yin Hou. Li Jiang, Li Tong, and Li Wu were already by Yin Hou’s side.

All of them gazed at Yang Ye.

Yin Hou smiled, “So? You benefitted quite a bit, right?”

Yang Ye smiled, “It was alright!”

Yin Hou grinned and said, “We’re leaving the Sky Dimension now. What about you? Are you going to stay or are you coming with us?”

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to reply, “I’ll be staying!”

Since Xiao Qi refused to come see him, he intended to go see her.

Yin Hou hesitated for a moment and nodded in the end, “Be careful. If there’s no place for you in the Human Dimension once you leave the Sky Dimension, come to the Shaman Dimension. While the Sovereign of Man is powerful, he can’t do anything to you while you remain in the Shaman Dimension!”

“Thanks!” Yang Ye smiled, “I’ll come to the Shaman Dimension if I have trouble getting by!”

Yin Hou grinned. She didn’t say anything else and just left while taking Li Jiang and Li Tong with her.

Yang Ye gazed at Li Wu who was still here.

Li Wu said, “The Grand Shaman asked me to give you a message.”

The Grand Shaman? Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he realized that she should be referring to the Sage of the shaman race that the old woman had told him about.

Yang Ye was quite curious, “What is it?”

She spoke softly, “Be careful!”

Be careful!

Yang Ye frowned, “What does he mean?”

Li Wu shook her head slightly, “I’m not very sure. In short, be careful. Farewell!”

Li Wu’s figure shook and vanished into the distance.

Yang Ye frown deepened.

Suddenly, a woman in a white dress appeared in front of him.

It was the same woman whom he’d fought in the life and death arena that day.

She sized up Yang Ye and said, “Leave the Sky Dimension!”

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and looked her in the eyes, “Why?”

She replied, “Some people are beyond you. Don’t hold any unrealistic thoughts. Because it’ll end with you losing your life. Understand?”
