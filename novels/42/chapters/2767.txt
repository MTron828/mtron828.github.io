Chapter 2768 – Slash!

A moment later, Erya was in front of the colossus.

She seemed quite lost as she gazed at it. Some time passed before she shot a glance at Yang Ye, and it was full of reluctance.

Right when the sword energy was about to completely disperse, Erya pulled her gaze away and walked over.

Along with a flash of sword energy, the four rays of sword energy exploded into bits. However, they didn’t disperse and just drifted toward the surroundings!

Sword energy that shattered yet didn’t disperse!

Yang Ye ignored the shattered sword energy and gazed toward Erya. His expression changed drastically when he saw her horns, and he swiftly looked to the right and howled with fury, “ERYA!!”

Boom!

As soon as Yang Ye said that, a wave of monstrous pressure appeared here.

A powerful evil aura crushed the space here.

At the critical moment, Yang Ye hurriedly took the horns and shot backward. At the same time, he waved his sword to ceaselessly slice apart the pressure and energy rushing toward him!

A short while later, Yang Ye had retreated over 10km back!

The space where he’d been earlier had transformed into a pitch black hole in space now!

Meanwhile, an aura in there was growing increasingly stronger, and it was causing the black hole to warp!

Yang Ye was livid as he stared ahead, and he held tightly onto those horns.

Just like that, Yang Ye watched as the black hole started to shake violently. In the end, the entire starry sky started to crack open!

Yang Ye was forced to retreat again!

After retreating more than 10km again, Yang Ye stopped, but a moment later, his expression changed drastically!

The black hole suddenly exploded apart.

A wave of energy that carried monstrous pressure swept toward him.

Yang Ye swung his sword with an indifferent expression on his face.

Hiss!

The wave of energy before him was instantly sliced into bits. Suddenly, the entire starry sky started to shake.

Yang Ye sheathed his sword and looked forward. He saw a familiar figure there!

Erya!

At this moment, her body was still the same size. However, she wasn’t wearing that small dress with flower patterns anymore, she was wearing a dark red dress instead. She had a pair of horns on her head, but they weren’t dark gold, they were dark red. Her tail was dark red now too, and it was even longer like the tail of a dragon.

She walked toward Yang Ye with bare feet and indifference on her face. Her eyes were dark red, and every step she took caused space to shake.

Her physical strength was so tremendous the world couldn’t support it!

Yang Ye didn’t leave. He was still hopeful!

He didn’t want to give up on that hope, even if he knew he was in a very dangerous situation right now!

Suddenly, Erya stopped and gazed at Yang Ye. She revealed an evil grin while licking her lips, “Evil… Good…”

She’d vanished on the spot when she finished speaking.

The space in front of Yang Ye exploded inch by inch!

It was being blasted apart by physical strength!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly.

Erya was gone.

Once he realized that, Yang Ye shot backward, but Erya was even faster than him!

A small fist instantly arrived in front of him!

Yang Ye didn’t swing his sword. He just raised his arms with Heavenshield on them.

Bam!

An explosion resounded, and he was blasted over 30km away!

As soon as he stopped himself, a mouthful of blood sprayed from him!

Yang Ye looked up at Erya with shock. Her strength was simply indescribable at this point! He couldn’t feel his arms anymore, and even Heavenshield was covered in cracks!

If it hadn’t been for the enhanced form of Heavenshield, his body would have been shattered from going head-on against her!

Her strength was beyond anything human!

Suddenly, Erya appeared in front of him. She cracked a smile and tried to bite him!

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched! She clearly planned to eat him!

He didn’t dare to hold back and swung his sword.

Meanwhile, Erya suddenly raised her arm to block the attack.

Bam!

Yang Ye was blasted backward from the force of his attack instead!

Meanwhile, Erya remained motionless on the spot.

Yang Ye glanced at his right hand that was completely numb, and he had an extremely solemn expression on his face!

Erya was growing stronger!

She was growing increasingly stronger!

Suddenly, Erya appeared in front of him and was about to attack. Yang Ye hurriedly withdrew the horns.

Erya suddenly stopped her punch and gazed at the horns with a frown on her face. A short while later, she touched the horns on her head, and then she gazed at the horns in Yang Ye’s grasp with bewilderment.

Yang Ye was delighted by this reaction of hers and hurriedly said, “Erya…”T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Suddenly, she looked up at him and swung a punch.

Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically as he raised his sword to stop the attack.

Bam!

Yang Ye was instantly blasted far away.

Heavenshield had completely cracked apart. However, the Sword Precursor had strangely not cracked!

Yang Ye suppressed the shock in his heart and looked up at Erya. In the beginning, he’d planned to hold back, but now it seemed like that decision was absolutely foolish.

Erya could blast him into bits!

Erya didn’t attack again. She gazed at the horns for a long time. In the end, she gazed at Yang Ye with undisguised greed.

She was the Evil Progenitor, and she was most interested in evil. As for Yang Ye, he possessed slaughter intent and the Demonic Sword Dao. They could be described as things Erya was most fond of!

She wanted to attack, but for some reason, she moved her gaze toward the horns.

She fell silent as she gazed at them, but the space around her was obliterated incessantly.

Her strength was too overwhelming!

Suddenly, she looked up at Yang Ye, and his expression changed. However, she didn’t attack. She touched the horns on her head, and then she turned around and walked away.

Yang Ye looked forward, “Erya!”

Erya’s figure trembled slightly, but she continued forward just a moment later.

Just like that, Erya vanished from Yang Ye’s field of vision.

Yang Ye fell silent.

Erya was gone.

Regret!

At this moment, Yang Ye was undoubtedly full of regret. He hadn’t expected her to make such a choice!

It was something he’d never expected.

Erya was gone just like that!

Yang Ye gazed at the horns in his grasp and fell silent.

Meanwhile, Snowy suddenly appeared on his shoulder and rubbed her drowsy eyes. Obviously, she’d just woken up!

A moment later, she gazed at the horns, and she was stunned by them. After that, she gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Erya went to a place she used to live in. She’ll be back soon!”

Snowy blinked and looked forward with bewilderment in her eyes.

She tightened her grip on Yang Ye. Obviously, she’d realized something.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “It’s the truth. She’ll be back really soon!”

Snowy gazed forward for a long time. In the end, she nodded and looked at Yang Ye, but two streams of spirit energy flowed down her eyes.

Yang Ye gently wiped off her tears and smiled, “Why are you crying, little fellow? I guarantee that Erya will come back! She will!”

Snowy hugged Yang Ye’s neck and just pressed her head against him.

Yang Ye shot a glance in the direction Erya had vanished toward, and then he left with Snowy.

Suddenly, he stopped and looked to the side. A huge demon that blotted out the sky had appeared nearby, and it was traveling through space in his direction!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. Obviously, it was someone from the Four Dimensional Universe.

Yang Ye patted Snowy lightly, and she immediately took the horns and went back into the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye just stood there and waited in silence. A moment later, the demon grew increasingly closer to her.

Meanwhile, a wave of powerful pressure swept toward Yang Ye like a wave.

Obviously, the demon had noticed him!

Yang Ye remained indifferent, but his gaze was icy cold to the extreme!

No one could understand how he felt upon watching Erya leave!

Why had she made such a choice? Because she wanted to help him! And why was he in this current situation?

He’d been forced into it!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly.

Boom!

A wave of terrifying sword intent surged up into the air!

The Demonic Sword Dao!

At this moment, Yang Ye instantly reached his prime!

Suddenly, he opened his eyes, and then he dashed forward at maximum speed!

A moment later, he was above the demon, but the demon didn’t stop. Conversely, it sped up!

It wanted to knock Yang Ye to death!

The demon’s eyes were full of indifference and contempt!

Yang Ye’s actions were undoubtedly no different as a man trying to stop an elephant.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye drew his sword.

“Slash!” A furious shout resounded through space.

A moment later, a sword howl tore through the area.

Bang!

The demon was instantly blasted away. At the same time, Yang Ye was blasted away too. But it only took a moment for him to force himself to a stop, and then he charged forward again…

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

In the starry sky, rays of brilliant sword energy and pitch black sword energy crisscrossed!

The pitch black sword energy was Burial, of course!

The demon was pushed back repeatedly while blood sprayed incessantly from it.

In the end, a ray of sword energy slashed down its throat!

Hiss!

The demon’s head was chopped off its body!

Yang Ye stood there on its back. His entire body was dyed blood red from the demon beast’s blood.

He looked up into space and spoke fiercely, “Destiny and the Four Dimensional Universe, listen up! I don’t care what you want, I’ll fight you until the end!”

Suddenly, a sword shot down from above!

Justice!

Yang Ye looked up and tightened his grip on the Sword Precursor. He was just about to attack when the Sword Precursor suddenly struggled free of his grasp, shot up into the air, and shot at Justice!

Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically as he understood what the Sword Precursor was doing.

In the end, he didn’t stop it!

It was the Sword Precursor’s choice!
