Chapter 2796 – Not Human!

Bam!

Emperor Li was blasted over 300m away!

Emperor Li had quite an unsightly expression on his face, but he didn’t say a word. Because he’d sensed the mysterious expert’s desire to kill just now!

Zuo Mu suddenly asked, “Then what should we do now?”

Monarch Yan had suddenly taken Destiny’s side. Not to mention Yang Ye, even they had been taken by surprise. Because their agreement with Monarch Yan was nothing like that.

The mysterious expert glanced at Monarch Yan and Yang Ye, “Yang Ye isn’t the same person we knew, so Monarch Yan can’t kill Yang Ye on his own! Monarch Yan knows that, so he’s keeping Yang Ye busy while the Four Dimensional Universe’s forces destroy the Three Dimensional Universe. As for us…”

All of them gazed at him and waited for him to continue.

The mysterious expert spoke softly, “Help Yang Ye!”

All of them were stunned upon hearing this!

Help Yang Ye?

They thought they’d heard him wrongly!

Emperor Li looked the mysterious expert in the eyes, “Are you sure?”

The mysterious expert replied, “Once Yang Ye dies, we will be Monarch Yan’s next target. So, Yang Ye cannot die! Of course, we don’t have to act now. If we help him kill Monarch Yan now, that fellow would either go for that woman or me. No matter who he attacks, it won’t be a good thing for me!”Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

He would have a lot of trouble if Yang Ye chose him, and Yang Ye was very likely to die if he went for Destiny!

Yang Ye’s strength was at a certain level now, and he didn’t want Yang Ye to just die!

The mysterious expert turned around and left, “Come with me.”

Zuo Mu and the others hesitated for a moment before following him, but Emperor Li didn’t.

Emperor Li stared at Yang Ye’s figure in midair while the desire to kill filled his eyes.

Shu Wubian spoke abruptly as they shot off far away, “Emperor Li…”

The mysterious expert replied indifferently, “It’s his own choice. Of course, if he is aware of Yang Ye’s true strength right now, he wouldn’t make that choice.”

In this entire world, perhaps only he and Monarch Yan truly understood Yang Ye’s strength!

Yang Ye wasn’t at the Destiny Realm, he was at the Destiny Transcendence Realm. Moreover, he possessed the Demonic Sword Dao and Fate Sword Dao, two extreme Sword Daos. Besides that, he was at the Ordinary Sword Realm!

The Ordinary Sword Realm!

That was the most lethal part of it all!

Actually, Yang Ye’s Demonic Sword Dao hadn’t been that strong before this, and his attainments in the Sword Dao played a huge part in that. Because he hadn’t attained the Ordinary Sword then. But now that he had, then when it was combined with the strength of those two extreme Sword Daos of his, it wasn’t a simple matter of one plus one.

As far as he was concerned, perhaps only Destiny could kill Yang Ye in single combat right now.

Shu Wubian suddenly asked, “Where are we going?”

The mysterious expert pulled the space before him in opposite directions, and it was torn open. They entered the spatial rift, and then the black robe around the mysterious expert suddenly vanished.

Besides Shu Wubian, the others were stunned on the spot when they saw his figure!

The mysterious expert wasn’t human!

While he was in the shape of a human, he wasn’t a human!

The mysterious expert walked forward and raised his hands. A moment later, six pitch black pillars appeared in that sealed-off expanse of space. Every one of them was 3km long and around 1km wide.

They formed a circle in this boundless expanse of space they were in!

Only five of the six pillars was extremely huge statues of demon beasts. Every one of them seemed like they were dead, but they emanated an invisible pressure upon all those who were here.

The mysterious expert raised his right hand, and a shadow flashed out of his palm. The shadow expanded in midair, and a moment later, there was a huge dragon soaring through the sky!

Shu Wubian looked up at the beasts on the pillars, “The Sky Phoenix, Black Tortoise, Vicious Tiger, Qilin, Ten-Tailed Fox… All of them are extraordinary evil beasts from the era of the Heaven Dao! They are only slightly inferior to the Evil Progenitor!”

As she spoke, she gazed at the mysterious expert, “According to rumor, the Heaven Dao of their time killed them. Could it be… they are still alive?”

The mysterious expert nodded, “They were only sealed.”

Shu Wubian spoke solemnly, “As far as I know, all of them were extremely violent. If they are awakened, the consequences would be unimaginable!”

She was the sprite of the Boundless Divine Tree, so she knew the Three Dimensional Universe’s history very well!

These demon beasts… No, they couldn’t be called demon beasts. These evil beasts reigned supreme over the Three Dimensional Universe when it was formed. Their viciousness and ferocity was something only those who’d lived through that era could understand!

The mysterious expert replied softly, “At a time like this, do you think any consequence could be worse?”

Shu Wubian spoke solemnly, “You want to use them against Destiny?”

The mysterious expert replied softly, “I want to try.”

Shu Wubian hesitated to speak.

The mysterious expert chuckled, “You think the chances are very slim?”

She nodded.

She’d experienced the era when these evil beasts roamed the Three Dimensional Universe, but she’d also experienced the era of Destiny. Especially the era of Destiny, she hadn’t just experienced it, she’d fought Destiny too! At that time, she was at her prime.

But she’d still lost!

Many didn’t really understand why Monarch Yan had knelt before Destiny, but the mysterious expert and her understood why.

Only those who’d fought Destiny could truly understand how strong she was!

She was an existence who’d suppressed the Three Dimensional Universe and Four Dimensional Universe on her own for countless years!

The mysterious expert walked over to the center of the pillars. He glanced at the evil beasts and said, “Just like Yang Ye, we have no choice but to risk our lives.”

As he spoke, he raised his right hand, “It would be more perfect with that Evil Progenitor. What a pity!”

Rumble!

Suddenly, the pillars started to tremble.

Zuo Mu and the others’ expressions changed slightly as they moved back. They didn’t dare to stay too close!

All of them were peak Destiny Realm experts, but these existences before them weren’t existences that peak Destiny Realm experts could fight!

The pillars started to shake more and more violently, and then they started to crack…

Universe City.

At this moment, Universe City was in ruins, and the people in the city were either dead or had fled.

In the sky above the city, sword howls and explosions were resounding incessantly.

Ding Shaoyao glanced at the surroundings from down below.

Suddenly, the old man with the bamboo chest appeared by her side.

Ding Shaoyao asked, “Are they gone?”

The old man nodded, “They are!”

They were speaking about the mysterious expert’s group!

The old man had been hiding and hadn’t shown himself until now because he’d been there to prevent a sudden attack from the mysterious expert!

Ding Shaoyao spoke solemnly, “It seems that there has been a disagreement between him and Monarch Yan. That mysterious expert refuses to side with Destiny.”

The old man nodded, “Probably!”

Ding Shaoyao spoke softly, “The current situation is just slightly better for us now.”

She looked up at the sky while she spoke.

At this moment, the situation in the Three Dimensional Universe was still bad. Under the condition that Yang Ye was being kept busy, the Destiny Realm experts of the Three Dimensional Universe couldn’t resist the Four Dimensional Universe. If it wasn’t for the help of some of Chen Dao’zi’s formations, the Destiny Realm experts of the Three Dimensional Universe would be dead by now.

The old man with the bamboo chest spoke solemnly, “Tell me what you think about all of this!”

The situation in this universe was terrible right now, so they needed a strategy!

Ding Shaoyao replied, “Senior Chen.”

As soon as she spoke, an old man who was in a slightly embarrassing state appeared before her. When the city had been breached just now, the formations in the city had naturally been destroyed as well, and he was the first to bear the brunt of that. If the old man with the bamboo chest hadn’t helped him in time, he would be dead by now!

Ding Shaoyao fell silent for a long time. In the end, she suddenly looked up, “Everyone! Don’t fight to the death! Retreat as you fight!”

Once they received her orders, the experts in the sky were stunned for a moment, but it didn’t take long for them to figure out what she meant.

They would never win even if they put their lives on the line!

If they retreated while fighting, they would be buying time for themselves to catch their breaths!

Because Universe City was empty now. Practically everyone in the Eternal Kingdom had fled to the outside world… Simply speaking, Ding Shaoyao planned to abandon Eternal Kingdom!

They had no choice but to do that!

A short while later, all the Destiny Realm experts started to retreat as they fought, and they stretched the battlefield into numerous smaller battlefields.

“Roar!” Suddenly, a Devil Caracal dived down from the sky. Its target was Ding Shaoyao.

Ding Shaoyao remained indifferent while the old man with the bamboo chest took a step forward, and then he clenched his right fist and pushed it downward.

An huge, ethereal fist formed in the air, and then it slammed down on the Devil Caracal.

Bang!

The Devil Caracal was slammed down from midair.

Ding Shaoyao looked up at Yang Ye and Monarch Yan, “Senior, can you join that battle?”

The old man looked up at that area. At this moment, countless rays of sword energy and arcs of fiery lightning filled the area. A short while later, the old man shook his head, “I can’t! Their strength is practically at the peak of this world. If I interfere, it would change nothing.”

Ding Shaoyao nodded slightly, “Then I’ll be counting on you to keep those peak Destiny Realm experts busy!”

“Of course!” The old man vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

In the sky.

Boom!

The Devil Caracal was blasted into the sky.

Ding Shaoyao was quite shocked. The old man was extremely strong!

A moment later, four Devil Caracals surrounded the old man.

Obviously, the Four Dimensional Universe’s forces had realized how strong he was!

Ding Shaoyao gazed at the pitch black vortex in the sky. The black vortex had just suddenly appeared there, and experts from the Four Dimensional Universe were pouring out of it.

Most of them weren’t at the Destiny Realm, and some were relatively weak. But their objective wasn’t the experts of Universe City, it was the other parts of the entire Three Dimensional Universe!

To a certain extent, the Three Dimensional Universe had fallen!

Meanwhile, at a point in the starry sky, a sword cultivator was walking toward an area covered in clouds.
