Chapter 526 – Stepping Into Its Boundaries!

Sandstorms!

Violent winds were whistling through the distance, and it caused the sand on the desert to be swept up endlessly into the air and blot out the sky.

Yang Ye asked softly. “This is the Desert of Exile?”

Yin Xuan’er nodded and said, “It’s the territory of the Scorpion and Pit Viper Clans. Just like other clans of demons, they are extremely hostile to humans. So long as humans were to enter the desert, then even Exalt Realm experts would only have a slim chance of surviving.”

“Are they really that formidable?” Lu Jianyao was slightly doubtful.

Yin Xuan’er created a suction force in her calm, and then a small stone fell into her grasp. She flicked it with her finger, and it fell onto the desert in the distance. Yang Ye and the others watched with astonishment as a small multicolored snake appeared from beneath the sand and swallowed the stone as soon as it fell onto the sank, and then the snake went beneath the sank as if it had never appeared there.

Lu Jianyao was astounded and said, “There... there are snakes beneath the sand?”

Yin Xuan’er said, “There are countless pit vipers and scorpions within this desert, and so long as humans.... Actually, anything that enters the desert will suffer their attacks. Just think about it, how huge is this desert? So, how many pit vipers and scorpions would there be within it? Coupled with the fact that they reside beneath our feet and can take us by surprise, then do you think we would be able to defend ourselves against Exalt Rank scorpions or pit vipers?”

A chill couldn’t help but run down Lu Jianyao’s spine when she thought about countless scorpions and pit vipers emerging from below the ground and attacking her. She said, “There are so many sandstorms, so it’s definitely impossible to fly. What should we do if we can’t fly?”

Yang Ye said, “Miss Yin probably has a way to pass through the desert, right? If you truly have no other way, then I’ll have no choice but to kill my way through this place!”

Jin Sha, Po Kong, and Po Xing’s eyelids twitched when they heard Yang Ye. This human is even more domineering than members of the demon race!

“Call me Xuan’er!” Yin Xuan’er glared at him, and then she said, “Have you taken a living for Shu Xin and intend to abandon me?”

Yang Ye was speechless.

“Hey, can you have a little shame. Yang Ye had said that he isn’t your husband, yet you still constantly call him your husband. You’re a woman at any rate, so can’t you be a little reserved?” Lu Jianyao really couldn’t stand the sight of Yin Xuan’er. Especially when she found out that Yin Xuan’er was one of those foxes of legend.

“What? Are you jealous?” Yin Xuan’er had a spurious smile on her face as she glanced at Lu Jianyao.

“What would I be jealous of!?” Lu Jianyao’s face flushed red from anger.

“Miss Xuan’er, tell me if you do have a way through the desert. Otherwise, I can only kill my way through it.” Yang Ye had a slight headache with the two of them because they refused to stop arguing for even a moment while they were together.

Yin Xuan’er smiled, and then she glanced at Jin Sha. The latter understood her intentions. His figure flashed and returned to his original form before he shot into the desert.

“Jin Sha has a slightly friendly relationship with the Patriarch of the Scorpion Clan, so it shouldn’t be a problem for us to pass through this place after Jin Sha notifies them. Husband, I’ve helped you so much, so how do you intend to repay me? Why don’t you allow me to give birth to a child for you?” Yin Xuan’er blinked her eyes and spoke shyly.

“Shameless!” Lu Jianyao grunted.

“You really intend to give birth to a child for me?” Yang Ye’s face didn’t become slightly like the ‘囧’ character this time, and he stared straight at her and asked this question in an extremely serious manner.

Yin Xuan’er was stunned. Obviously, she’d been caught slightly off guard by Yang Ye’s reaction. However, she calmed her emotions in next to no time, and then she said shyly, “Of course. I’m absolutely devoted to you, my husband.”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Alright. Since it’s like that, then let’s look for a time to make a child!” Constantly backing down would only make this fox reach for a yard after being given an inch. Since it was like that, Yang Ye felt it was better to attack her head-on. In any case, he believed that she would absolutely not give birth to a child for him.

Yin Xuan’er was the one who was speechless this time.

Yang Ye paid no attention to her, and he closed his eyes slightly before he immersed his consciousness into his body. A wisp of a smile appeared on the corners of his mouth while he gazed at the green pearl in the pool of profound energy within the tiny vortex. Needless to say, the Greenwood Spirit had helped him greatly. Because he was at the Exalt Realm now. So long as a Monarch Realm expert didn’t act against him, then he was confident to face any Exalt Realm expert!

After he attained the Exalt Realm, Yang Ye noticed that the space within the tiny vortex had expanded to an extremely terrifying state. According to his estimation, it was at least capable of housing a small city with 100,000 inhabitants. Moreover, his violet profound energy had turned dark violet in color. Besides that, he had two more Sword Servants, Ding Xiang and that elder of the Skydevil Sect.

In other words, he had 10 Sword Servants now. Moreover, the speeds of cultivation of Hong, Black One, and the other Sword Servants were extremely swift while they cultivated within the tiny vortex. He believed that it wouldn’t be long before all of them could attain the fifth rank of the Exalt Realm.

In short, this advancement of his had provided him with a huge amount of benefits, and it was an extremely timely assistance to him!

Yang Ye withdrew his consciousness from within his body, and then he flipped his palm before the ancient sheath appeared in his grasp. He issued a command in his heart, and then the ancient sheath shot Void Flash out from within it before he put the ancient sheath away and grasped Void Flash in his hand. At this moment, he was able to truly control Void Flash after he’d grasped spatial energy, and he was able to bring forth Void Flash’s true strength!

Something else worthy of mentioning was that his Sword Domain had become stronger as well. The changes his Sword Domain had undergone even shocked him a great deal, and it was even more shocking than the might of the Heavenrend Drawing Technique when executed with Void Flash and the ancient sheath.

He wasn’t talking nonsense when he said that he intended to kill his way through the desert, it was because he felt that he could really accomplish it now.

Of course, it was best to keep a low profile.

Meanwhile, Jin Sha had returned, and a middle aged man who had a sharp golden sting on his head had come here with Jin Sha.

“Princess, this is the Patriarch of the Scorpion Clan, Ye Xie’zi.” Jin Sha introduced.

Yin Xuan’er nodded and said, “Patriarch Ye, you should be aware of the reason that we’ve come here, right? Our objective is the Saint Ruins, and we won’t be staying on the Desert of Exile.”

Ye Xie’zi glanced at Yang Ye and Lu Jianyao before he frowned and said, “Princess Yin, it wouldn’t be a problem to pass through the desert if it was just you, Jin Sha, and those two fellows behind you. But these two humans.... Princess Yin, I’m not making it difficult for you on purpose. You should be clearly aware that humans aren’t allowed in the Desert of Exile. Truthfully speaking, it’s very dangerous if you bring these two humans with you into the desert. Even you know that my Scorpion Clan isn’t the only clan in the desert.”

Yang Ye shook his head upon hearing this. At this moment, he really missed the little fellow. If the little fellow was here, then all those poisonous beasts throughout the desert would just be trash! After all, would anyone dare to stop the little fellow? In any case, he’d never seen a single member of the demon race that didn’t give the little fellow face.

Yin Xuan’er smiled and said, “It’s fine so long as your Scorpion Clan doesn’t attack us. Just leave the rest to us.”

Ye Xie’zi said, “Since it’s like that, then I won’t say anything else. Princess Yin, please go on ahead. Right, allow me to warn you that besides that crazy pit viper, all of you have to be careful of the sandstorms as well. Even Exalt Realm experts will be torn into pieces if you get swept into the sandstorms by accident.”

“Thank you for the warning” Yin Xuan’er nodded.

Ye Xie’zi glanced at Yang Ye, and then a wisp of surprise flashed through his eyes before he turned around and left.

After Ye Xie’zi left, all of them waited on the spot for a while, and then they entered the desert once the sandstorm in the distance had dispersed.

“We’ll be at the wilds once we pass through the Desert of Exile. You’ll have to face Luo Jun head-on at that time. Are you confident in your ability to do so?” asked Yin Xuan’er.

Yang Ye thought for a while and said truthfully, “I’m very confident if it’s a one on one battle. But I might not be confident at all if it’s a group battle!”

“Luo Jun won’t fight you in a one on one battle!” Yin Xuan’er smiled and said, “He has so many experts by his side, so he won’t take a risk himself. However, it’s fine. Because even though he has many experts by his side, we have many as well. So long as we join forces after we enter the Saint Ruins, then he may not necessarily be able to occupy an advantaged position. But we have to be careful of one person.”

“Who?” asked Yang Ye.

“An Nanjing!” Yin Xuan’er had a solemn expression on her face as she said, “Her An Clan has sided with Luo Jun. If she helps Luo Jun, then we’ll be in quite a bad situation. You’ve fought her so you should be clearly aware of the strength she possesses right?”

“An Nanjing, huh?” Yang Ye’s brows knit together slightly. He was naturally clearly aware of her strength. If nothing unexpected occurred, then she should have attained the Exalt Realm by now. If she really does help Luo Jun, then it will be extremely troublesome to deal with. Because she’ll definitely be able to keep me constantly busy, and only I can keep her busy. Otherwise, if Yin Xuan’er and the others were to go against her, then they would die no matter which one of them fought her.

Yang Ye remained silent for a short while before he said, “Besides the profounders of our human world, even the demon race is able to head to the Saint Ruins as well?”

“Of course!” Yin Xuan’er said, “After all, the current strength of your human race isn’t strong enough to forcibly take possession of the Saint Ruins. Otherwise, the human race wouldn’t have signed that agreement with the demon race and devil race. The human race and demon race are both parties which will be heading to the Saint Ruins this time, and if nothing unexpected occurs, then the devil race will send their forces over as well. I just don’t know if it’ll be Mo Ke.”

Yang Ye suddenly said, “What do you think will happen if Luo Jun dies?”

Yin Xuan’er’s eyelids twitched, and she took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye before she said, “If he dies, then the central territory will definitely fall into chaos. Because those powers that have allied themselves with the Exalted Han Empire will definitely break their promises. The biggest reason why they’ve sided with the Exalted Han Empire is because Luo Jun is the Mortal Emperor and messenger of the world. However, if that messenger of the world were to have died, then doesn’t it mean that the world has given up on the Exalted Han Empire? Would anyone dare become allies with the Exalted Han Empire then?”

Yang Ye tightened his grip of Void Flash when he heard this.

Yin Xuan’er asked. “You want to kill Luo Jun?”

“Can I not?” Yang Ye said, “He’s a human and not a god.”

“It’s very difficult!” Yin Xuan’er said in a low voice, “There are countless experts by his side, and with the resources and reserves possessed by the Exalted Han Empire, it would have definitely given him all sorts of Dao Artifacts or other methods to protect his life. So, unless it’s a Monarch Realm Expert.... No, even a Monarch Realm expert would probably find it difficult to kill him!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye was just about to say something when their group suddenly stopped moving because the sand around them had started to move.
