Chapter 1835 – I Think I’ve Seen You Somewhere!

Footsteps!

Needless to say, a chill ran down Yang Ye’s spine. Someone had appeared behind him without making a single sound!

However, he hadn’t sensed the person’s presence, even until now. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

At the same time, he finally understood that the treant wasn’t afraid of him, it was afraid of the person behind him.

Who’s behind me? Yang Ye turned around.

A woman in a tight violet gold dress was behind him. Her dress was very long and was dragged against the ground. There were many flowers embroidered all over her dress.

Yang Ye just happened to recognize the flowers.

It was the Paramita Flower!

Qin had used a similar flower that day in Merak System!

There was a violet belt around her waist, and it wrapped around her fine waist. This made her seem even more slender.

Yang Ye gazed at the woman’s face, there was a mask on it. A strange mask, and it completely obstructed his view of her face.

At this moment, she’d stopped moving.

Yang Ye glanced at her and asked, “Who are you?”

The woman didn’t speak. She gazed at the treant, and then she stretched her right hand forward. Yang Ye and the others watched with astonishment as a golden circle of light appeared above the treant, and then it wrapped around the treant.

In an instant, the treant was locked on the spot!

It didn’t even have the strength to fight back!

At this moment, the expressions of everyone here had changed.

Yang Ye hurriedly tried to contact Hou Qing and Qiong Qi. However, he noticed to his astonishment that they didn’t reply. It wasn’t just them, even the Primordial Pagoda had gone completely silent.

Yang Ye’s heart immediately sank!

Meanwhile, the masked woman suddenly looked towards the side and waved her right hand. The space there flickered before a veiled woman and a woman in a wheelchair appeared before them.

Blood Maiden gazed at the veiled woman and was slightly surprised, “Pavilion Master?”

Yang Ye was quite surprised too. He was surprised because he hadn’t expected the Martial Envoy to be here as well.

The Martial Envoy nodded to Yang Ye and gazed at the masked woman.

At this moment, everyone was looking at the masked woman.

However, she was looking at Yang Ye instead.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. What does she want?

Meanwhile, she suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s expression changed and was about to move away. However, her hand appeared on his shoulder, and then Yang Ye couldn’t move.

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden and Blind Maiden wanted to help, but the masked woman waved her right hand. In an instant, an invisible barrier trapped Blood Maiden and Blind Maiden. The barrier didn’t even tremble no matter what they did!

The Martial Envoy suddenly pressed her index and middle fingers together before tapping it forward. A ruler flashed out from the tip of her finger. In an instant, the ruler emanated a dazzling glow as it appeared before the masked woman.

Meanwhile, the woman suddenly stretched out her left hand and tapped it forward lightly. The light around the ruler was instantly dispersed, and then two fingers clamped down on the Martial Envoy’s ruler.

The Martial Envoy’s face instantly became solemn at the sight of this.

Suddenly, the masked woman tapped her fingers forward, and the ruler transformed into a ray of dazzling light that vanished at the tips of her fingers. It was before the Martial Envoy’s forehead when it appeared again.

Meanwhile, the Martial Envoy moved 300m back with the wheelchair beneath her. However, the ruler was still pressed against her forehead when she arrived there!

The Martial Envoy moved 300m back again. However, the Martial Ruler was still pressed against her forehead.

A short while later, the Martial Envoy didn’t try to do anything. She just stared at the masked woman and asked, “Who are you?!”

The masked woman didn’t answer her and just gazed at the veiled woman.

Meanwhile, the veiled woman suddenly raised her hands and twisted them slightly in midair. In an instant, the space around Yang Ye and the masked woman started to ripple violently like boiling water. At the same time, strands of extreme coldness appeared in the surroundings.

It was icy cold to the bone!

That was what Yang Ye felt right now.

Suddenly, the masked woman tapped her right foot down.

The rippling expanse of space instantly calmed down.

The veiled woman’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then she flipped her right palm. A pitch black command token appeared in her grasp, and her profound energy surged madly.

The Nether Token!

It was the symbol of identity for the Nether Pavilion’s master! The Nether Token!

As her profound energy surged incessantly into it, the command token suddenly started trembling violently. An instant later, she tossed it forward, and it appeared in midair before arrows of light energy flashed out from it.

They shot forward in succession towards the masked woman.

These arrows of light contained extremely terrifying energy. Based on Yang Ye’s estimations, even 6th stage True Realm experts would find them difficult to defend against one of them, and there were so many of them now!

The masked woman looked up at the arrows of light, pondered deeply for a moment, and then raised her hand. The space above her instantly became ethereal, and then the arrows of light instantly slowed down!

The arrows of light had been extremely fast earlier, yet now, they had become extremely slow!

Meanwhile, the masked woman’s fingers clamped down on an arrow, and then she shook it slightly.

Bang!

The string of arrows shattered. She waved her right hand, and the Nether Token immediately fell into her palm. A moment later, it shot out and instantly pressed against the veiled woman’s forehead before the latter could even react.

The veiled woman’s body instantly stiffened, and she didn’t dare to move a muscle.

The others were rendered speechless.

Needless to say, all of them were beyond shocked.

Especially Yang Ye.

At this moment, he couldn’t move at all. Because her right hand was on his shoulder, and it was heavy like the sky, so he couldn’t move at all. Even his profound energy had gone completely silent.

Qiong Qi and Hou Qing refused to respond, and the Primordial Pagoda was silent.

What did that represent?

It represented that she was extremely dangerous to the point that they didn’t dare to expose their presence. Perhaps their main bodies didn’t fear her, but they were definitely not a match for her in their current state.

That wasn’t even the main point, the main point was that she was keeping him here with one hand while she fought the others with her other hand…. Simply speaking, she’d used just a single hand to defeat everyone here besides Nether Dream!

He knew the Martial Envoy’s strength very well. Ordinary 6th stage True Realm experts were no match for her. After all, she was able to fight an ancient cultivator like the woman in a red dress. But at this moment, she was actually unable to fight back against the masked woman!

So, who was the masked woman?

Meanwhile, the masked woman gazed at the only person that she hadn’t defeated, Nether Dream.

Nether Dream gazed coldly at the masked woman, and then she vanished on the spot. An instant later, a pair of footprints appeared in front of the masked woman.

The Nether Ghoststeps!

Meanwhile, the masked woman suddenly tapped her finger forward.

The space in front of her instantly rippled like the surface of a lake, and the ripples surged towards Nether Dream.

Rumble!

Explosions resounded incessantly. Everyone watched as numerous afterimages appeared in the space before the masked woman. The afterimages were images of Nether Dream.

At this moment, Nether Dream’s afterimages were vanishing rapidly.

It didn’t take long for the last afterimage to vanish.

Boom!

Meanwhile, a figure was blasted out from that expanse of space. It was Nether Dream!

She’d been defeated!

Blood Maiden and the others’ faces fell. They hadn’t expected that even Nether Dream’s Nether Ghoststeps would be overcome by force!

All of them gazed at the masked woman. Who is she?

Suddenly, Nether Dream soared up into the air, and then numerous black circles of light appeared around her. More and more appeared around her, and it only took a short breath of time for over 100 to appear there!

A moment later, she tapped a finger in the masked woman’s direction.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

The circles of light instantly transformed into rays of black light that shot towards the masked woman. Everywhere they passed, space was instantly sliced open.

Meanwhile, the masked woman suddenly tapped her left hand forward, and the space in front of her warped. The circles of light warped along with the space there. Besides that, once the circles of light arrived around 10m away from her, they weren’t able to slice up the space there.

Conversely, the circles of light were forcefully warped by the space there.

Meanwhile, the masked woman waved her left hand, and then the space before her returned to normal.

However, the black circles of light just gradually vanished. In less than two breaths of time, all the circles of light had vanished without making a sound.

After that, the masked woman tapped her finger in Nether Dream’s direction, “Bind!”

As soon as she finished speaking, a golden circle of light appeared around Nether Dream, and then her body stiffened on the spot. Just like the treant, Nether Dream couldn’t move at all!

After Nether Dream was bound, the masked woman turned to look at Yang Ye. At the same time, Yang Ye said, “Err… Big Sister, I think that violence can’t solve anything. The only way to solve problems is through discussion! What do you think?”

Meanwhile, the masked woman suddenly said, “I think I’ve seen you somewhere!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
