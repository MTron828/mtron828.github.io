Chapter 2205 – I’ll Do It Myself!

At the instant Yang Ye was about to leave Void Spirit Continent, a black shadow suddenly shot down from deep within outer space.

Yang Ye frowned when he sensed this and stopped in the clouds.

It didn’t take long for a black figure to appear over 1km above him.

Yang Ye frowned at the sight of the person before him.

An undying cavalry!

It was the same undying cavalry he’d met that day!

Yang Ye didn’t say a word and just shook his hand slightly.

A sword howl resounded, and a ray of light shot up into the air. It instantly stopped the undying cavalry in midair.

As soon as she stopped, the undying cavalry drew her spear and swung it.

Bang!

An explosion resounded and Yang Ye’s blood red sword was blasted away. Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared behind it, and then he grabbed it and flashed. A ray of sword energy formed a strange arc as it shot toward the undying cavalry.

Boom!

The undying cavalry was blasted over 10km away!

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was behind the undying cavalry. An instant later, his sword pressed against the undying cavalry’s back.

As expected, it stabbed into the latter’s back, right through the heart!

Meanwhile, the undying cavalry swung a backhand stab at Yang Ye with her spear.

Bang!

Yang Ye stopped it with his sword, and the powerful force it carried pushed him backward repeatedly. His face grew even more solemn when he stopped himself.

Because the undying cavalry was completely fine!

The undying cavalry was alive, and the hole in her back had vanished.

Are they really impossible to kill? Yang Ye frowned, and then he stomped his right foot down.

A blood red ray of sword energy flashed forward.

Meanwhile, the undying cavalry’s eyes narrowed slightly. She grabbed her spear with both hands and swung it straight against Yang Ye’s blood red sword energy.

Bang!

The blood red sword energy exploded apart, and the undying cavalry was blasted away. Right when Yang Ye was about to attack again, the undying cavalry whistled, and then the space before her trembled. After that, a demon beast tore through the space there and emerged before her.

The Nefarious!

The undying cavalry leaped onto the Nefarious, and then her aura instantly changed.

If she was like a tiger earlier, she was like a dragon now!

It was a qualitative transformation!

“Kill!” Meanwhile, the undying cavalry roared with fury, and then a ray of dark light flashed.

Bam!

Yang Ye was blasted away. However, at the instant that happened, rays of blood red sword energy flickered incessantly and instantly covered the sky.

“Break!” The undying cavalry’s voice resounded from within the blood red sword energy, and then a spear tore through the air.

Suddenly, Yang Ye took a step forward, and then he transformed into a ray of blood red light that stabbed against the spear.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the undying cavalry was blasted away with the Nefarious.

Suddenly, Yang Ye grabbed his blood red sword and hurled it.

Hiss!

A ray of light that was thin as an ox’s hair flashed through the air, and then it stabbed into the woman’s chest. The powerful force it carried blasted her away, and she flew over 10km away before it nailed her to the ground.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye stomped his right foot down and shot forward. However, the Nefarious suddenly leaped up and slammed itself at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye didn’t dodge and just swung a punch.

Bang!

His fist slammed straight against the Nefarious’ head, and then it was blasted away.

Meanwhile, the undying cavalry suddenly stood up, and the injury on her chest had vanished!

Yang Ye frowned once more from the sight of this!

Is she really impossible to kill?

Yang Ye refused to believe this and intended to attack again. However, she leaped up onto the Nefarious, and then it carried her on its back and instantly vanished into the distance.

“Just you wait!” The undying cavalry’s voice resounded from far away.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye frowned. The undying cavalry was truly quite mysterious and terrifying. Those two attacks of his were lethal attacks, yet she had been completely unharmed. He naturally didn’t believe she was impossible to kill, because if that was so, wouldn’t all of them be invincible?

“The Undying Physique!” Suddenly, a voice came from Yang Ye’s side.

Yang Ye turned and saw that it was none other than the Dao Progenitor.

The Dao Progenitor walked slowly to Yang Ye’s side, “All of those women possess a unique physique, the Undying Physique. It’s a very rare physique, and it’s unique because it makes its possessor difficult to kill, and it gets even more terrifying if it’s nurtured further. Besides absolute strength that can instantly obliterate all vitality within them, they can recover from any other injury. Moreover, no matter how great the injury is, they can swiftly recover with death energy so long as their souls remain!”

Yang Ye said, “Senior, you seem to know a lot about it.”

The Dao Progenitor replied softly, “I’ve investigated them.”

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, are you here for a reason?”

The Dao Progenitor gazed at Yang Ye, “Do you resent me?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “If I resent you just because you refused to help me, then what kind of person would I be? While there’s deep enmity between me and the other two Paths, the Dao Path doesn’t owe me anything.”

A wisp of complicated emotions flashed through the Dao Progenitor’s eyes, and then he shook his head slightly and said, “I came because I want to discuss something with you. It’s about the undying race. I’m sure you’re aware that the Buddhist Path and Weapon Path have formed an alliance with my Dao Path. We plan to bring you and the Alliance of All to our side to jointly resist the undying race. I…”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I refuse.”

The Dao Progenitor asked solemnly, “Why?”

Yang Ye gazed at the Dao Progenitor, “If the undying race cannot annihilate the Alliance of All and those two Paths, then I will. Even if they can, I’ll still do it. There isn’t much enmity between me and the undying race, and even if there is enmity that will lead to our mutual demise, I’ll annihilate the Buddhist Path, Weapon Path, and Alliance of All before that happens. Besides killing, I don’t want to do anything else in the remainder of my life. I’m going to kill until my eyes recover!”

Yang Ye turned around and left.

Form an alliance with the Alliance of All and the two Paths? Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

As far as Yang Ye was concerned, the Dao Progenitor’s suggestion was a joke, a huge joke.

The safety of the universe? The future of the universe? What did that have to do with him?

As far as he was concerned, his most important task for the remainder of his life wasn’t to attain the Dao and ascend to the Progenitor Realm, it was to kill. It was to avenge his father and friends.

Even if the large universe perished, he would still choose revenge!

The Dao Progenitor sighed softly.

Actually, he’d expected this.

He knew quite a bit about Yang Ye’s temper, and he knew that it was impossible for Yang Ye to take the three Paths and the Alliance of All’s side. Just as he’d expected, Yang Ye Had refused.

Yang Ye hadn’t even hesitated!

The Dao Progenitor shook his head again and left.

If Yang Ye was willing to take their side, they would have a very good chance against the undying race. After all, every single expert on Yang Ye’s side was no weakling. Unfortunately, Yang Ye couldn’t put down the enmity he carried!

The Dao Progenitor was helpless against that!

…

After he left the Dao Progenitor, Yang Ye entered the boundless reaches of space and traveled through it until he arrived at a continent. It was a continent called the God Realm.

The God Realm!

It was the god race’s new territory. After Shi Tian had been revived, the entire god race had moved here. As far as the god race was concerned, it needed a new home to develop and rise back to its former glory!

Suddenly, a ray of blood red light appeared in the sky above the God Realm, and then it entered the ancient city below.

Sky Realm City.

It was the current capital of the god race.

Yang Ye looked up at it. At this moment, countless experts had leaped out of the city, and it only took a short while for around 20 people to appear in front of Yang Ye.

All of them were Sages!

Many of them had even met Yang Ye in the past!

Their faces fell when they saw him. It wasn’t just the Alliance of All and the three Paths that feared Yang Ye, the god race feared him too!

He was too insane.

Suddenly, a woman appeared in front of Yang Ye.

It was Zhi’er!

Complicated emotions flashed through her eyes as she gazed at him, but it didn’t take long to vanish. She spoke softly, “Leave, alright?”

She naturally knew what Yang Ye was here for. However, she knew that the god race would never give up Snowy!

Yang Ye stretched out his hand, “Give me Snowy and I’ll leave!”

Snowy!

Zhi’er gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before she shook her head, “The Sprite Lord is too useful to my god race, so I can’t give it to you. You…”

Suddenly, a ray of sword energy flashed.

“AH!” A shrill cry resounded, and then the head of a Sage near Zhi’er instantly flew up into the air while accompanied by a fountain of blood. It was an extremely bloody sight.

A Sage had been killed in an instant!

Zhi’er and the others’ expressions instantly turned unsightly.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye started walking slowly in their direction, “The alliance of all the races wasn’t able to annihilate your god race all those years ago. That’s fine, I’ll do it myself!”
