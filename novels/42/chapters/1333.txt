Chapter 1334 – Ye Liuyun Is Here!

Yang Ye’s face slowly turned icy cold when he saw the enforcement team charge at him.

He had some doubts about what Xiao Lan had said because he felt that the enforcement team would absolutely not act that lawlessly. After all, the enforcement team represented the Sword Alliance, and they supervised the order in Doomsday City. If those who supervised the order here didn’t follow the rules and sought personal gain instead, then wasn’t that equivalent to bringing shame to the Sword Alliance?

But in reality, they were acting with complete disregard of the laws. If he wasn’t the master of the Sword Alliance, he would think the Sword Alliance was bullying the weak. Actually, it wasn’t just a feeling because that was exactly what was happening right now!

They had just attacked him without finding out what had happened, and they even accused him of challenging the Sword Alliance. Obviously, they’d done the same in the past. If they didn’t like someone, or someone refused to obey them, then they just accused that person of challenging the Sword Alliance before openly killing that person!

They were parasites in the Sword Alliance!

Yang Ye took a deep breath, took a step forward, and waved his right hand. The middle aged man who led the group was instantly blasted over 3km away and slammed against a wall. The wall crumbled and buried him beneath it. Meanwhile, Yang Ye waved his hand swiftly again....

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Countless figures were flying incessantly. In just a few breaths of time, all the members of the enforcement team had been blasted away.

The spectators were flabbergasted.

After all, they were all Emperors! However, they’d been crushed just like that. Moreover, the spectators hadn’t even been able to see how Yang Ye defeated them!

Someone spoke in a low voice, “The enforcement team has bitten off more than it can chew!”

Someone else said, “So what? Don’t forget that this is Doomsday City. It’s the Sword Alliance’s territory. Does anyone on the continent dare to go against the Sword Alliance?”

The others nodded with agreement.

Presently, the Sword Alliance was the rightful overlord of the continent, so only death would come to those who opposed the Sword Alliance.

Meanwhile, Lin Mo emerged from the rubble, and his face was extremely unsightly as he gazed at Yang Ye. He hadn’t imagined that he would actually be unable to resist even a single move from this fellow before him. Even though his rage was blazing, he hadn’t lost all reason. Just a single collision had allowed him to realize that he was absolutely no match for the man who stood before him.

So, he crushed a transmission talisman.

“They’re calling for backup! The enforcement team is calling for support.”

“I wonder who will come. Will it be the Blade of the Sword Alliance? I heard they are genius sword cultivators that the master of the Sword Alliance, Yang Ye, chose himself. Every single one of them can surmount their realms of cultivation to do battle, and their equipment is at the Emperor Rank as well. If they come....”

“That’s probably impossible. Blade is the strongest force in the Sword Alliance. How could they possibly pay attention to such trivial matters?”

“This is no trivial matter. Just look at that fellow. Even Emperors aren’t able to fight back against him. Ordinary experts of the Sword Alliance would probably be unable to deal with him! I presume only Blade or those old fellows in the Sword Alliance can deal with him.”

“Cut the crap and watch. The Sword Alliance’s forces will be here soon.”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Snowy suddenly rubbed her head against his cheek, and then she pointed at the store.

Yang Ye glanced at Snowy, and he noticed that she’d finished the fruit. He smiled and gazed at Xiao Lan who stood at the store’s entrance. At this moment, the young woman’s eyes were opened wide and filled with shock. Obviously, she had been shocked by the strength Yang Ye revealed.

Yang Ye smiled, “Miss Xiao Lan, do you have more of that fruit?”

Xiao Lan was stunned, and then she hurriedly nodded, “I do.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Snowy flew over to her, and then she watched with astonishment as Snowy handed a pile of violet crystals to her. Xiao Lan gulped and instinctively took them. Meanwhile Snowy immediately revealed a brilliant smile when she saw Xiao Lan accept the violet crystals.

Xiao Lan counted them and noticed there were around 100 there. In other words, they were sufficient for 10 fruits. She glanced at Snowy, and then Snowy immediately cracked a smile and drew the shape of the fruit in midair.

Xiao Lan grinned when she saw how cute Snowy was, and she said, “Come with me!” She turned around and walked into the store.

Snowy turned to look at Yang Ye, and once she saw Yang Ye nod, she immediately shot forward and followed after Xiao Lan.

Meanwhile, Lin Mo spoke ferociously, “How dare you try to go against my Sword Alliance! No matter who you, you won’t be able to leave Doomsday City today!”

Yang Ye turned to look at Lin Mo and said, “Is the Sword Alliance a big deal?”

The others in the surroundings had weird expressions on their faces when they heard Yang Ye.

Is the Sword Alliance a big deal?

It sounded like a bunch of nonsense to them. The Sword Alliance wasn’t just a big deal, it was extraordinary. If the Veiled Region wasn’t considered, then would anyone throughout Dark Hell Continent dare to provoke the Sword Alliance? Even the Veiled Region didn’t dare it. After all, 2 Voiders from the Veiled Region had been instantly killed by the Sword Alliance’s master that day!

“How laughable!” A wisp of ridicule arose on the corners of Lin Mo’s mouth, “I never expected someone on this continent to actually look down upon my Sword Alliance. Do you know who stands behind us? It’s Yang Ye! Do you know Yang Ye? Don’t tell me you haven’t heard of him!”

“Yang Ye?” Yang Ye nodded and said, “I have heard of him. But is he a big deal?”

Clamorous noise resounded. Everyone looked at Yang Ye as if they were looking at a freak. Is Yang Ye a big deal? He was, of course!

The number one genius of the continent, the number one sword cultivator of the continent, the master of the number one power of the continent, and the only person on the continent who’d killed Voiders at the Quasi Emperor Realm.

If that wasn’t a big deal, then what was?

Some gazed at Yang Ye and muttered softly, “Was he living in a cave?”

Actually, Yang Ye wasn’t trying to act cool. He was very clearly aware of how strong he was. There were countless experts in this world. A person should be confident, but a person should have humility. Because only then can that person avoid becoming conceited. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Lin Mo immediately roared with laughter when he heard Yang Ye, and it was like he’d heard an extraordinarily amusing joke. He laughed for a long time before he gazed at Yang Ye, “How laughable! Truly laughable! Needless to say, you’ve renewed my knowledge of ignorant people.”

Yang Ye shook his head and didn’t waste his breath on Lin Mo anymore. He just glanced at the surroundings and said, “Why haven’t the ones who’re backing you arrived yet?”

“Hahaha....” Suddenly, laughter arose from afar, “I never expected someone to actually dare to look down upon our Sword Alliance. I’m really quite curious now.”

As soon as the voice finished resounding, a middle aged man in silver armor appeared before them, and there was a group of profounders in black armor standing behind him.

Someone amongst the crowd had a solemn expression on his face as he said, “It’s the Vice-Captain of the Enforcement Teams, Mo Ranxiong!”

“Big Brother Mo!” Meanwhile, Lin Mo hurriedly went over to greet the man, and then he gazed at Yang Ye and said, “That fellow didn’t just injure Elder Xu’s grandson, he even injured all of us....” He paused for a moment and continued, “He’s extremely strong.”

Mo Ranxiong glanced at Xu Yuntian who was lying beneath Yang Ye’s foot in an unconscious state, and his face immediately fell when he saw the miserable state Xu Yuntian was in. He gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Such gall! You dare to provoke my Sword Alliance in Doomsday City?”

Yang Ye glanced at them, and then he kicked Xu Yuntian and said, “This fellow was committing crimes in the city and collecting so-called ‘security fees’. You should be aware of it, right?”

Mo Ranxiong nodded and said, “I do.”

Yang Ye asked, “Then why aren’t you doing anything about it?”

Mo Ranxiong glanced at Yang Ye and chuckled, “So it’s a busybody. Your strength isn’t bad, but it doesn’t seem enough to interfere in our Sword Alliance’s business. I don’t want to waste my breath on you. Release Young Brother Xu and I’ll allow both of you to die a swifter death. Otherwise, you won’t be able to die even if you beg for it!”

Yang Ye shook his head, and then his figure vanished on the spot. He was in front of Mo Ranxiong when his figure appeared once more. Mo Ranxiong’s expression changed drastically, and he was about to retreat. But it was too late because Yang Ye’s hand had clamped down on his throat.

Everyone here was shocked!

Especially Lin Mo’s group. They hadn’t expected that even Mo Ranxiong couldn’t resist a single move from Yang Ye!

Yang Ye ignored the others in the surroundings, and he gazed at Mo Ranxiong whose eyes were wide open right now, “I’ll just ask you once. Who is backing all of you up and allowing all of you to act so arrogantly in Doomsday City?!”

Mo Ranxiong gazed at Yang Ye and spoke in a hoarse voice, “Who... who... who exactly are... are you?”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye slammed Mo Ranxiong against the ground.

Bang!

The ground cracked apart while Mo Ranxiong’s head was buried into the ground, causing his body to twitch repeatedly.

Yang Ye turned around to gaze at Lin Mo, “Continue calling for reinforcements until the one supporting you is here.”

At this moment, Lin Mo truly felt quite terrifying, “You....”

“Hurry up!” Yang Ye suddenly howled, and it instantly terrified Lin Mo to the point of shivering and hurriedly withdrawing a transmission talisman.

This time, the reinforcements arrived very quickly. An old man in black robes arrived here.

“Elder Xu!” Lin Mo hurriedly walked over to the old man, bowed respectfully, and said, “We were useless and weren’t able to save Brother Xu.”

The old man waved his hand and gazed at Yang Ye. He frowned when he saw Yang Ye, “Have we met?”

Yang Ye didn’t answer the old man. He just pointed at Xu Yuntian and said, “You are the one who allowed your grandson to do as he pleased and commit crimes in the city?”

The old man replied, “He was just collecting some fees to keep them safe. It isn’t a crime, right?”

Yang Ye asked, “What if they refused?”

The old man frowned. He was about to speak when Yang Ye continued, “You annihilate them if they refuse, right?”

The old man gazed at Yang Ye for a short while, and then he said, “That’s none of your business. Now, it’s time to pay for your actions.”

As he spoke, he was about to attack. However, a voice suddenly resounded, “Counsellor Ye is here.”

“Even Counsellor Ye was alarmed. That fellow is finished.”

“He was finished from the moment he offended the Sword Alliance.”

“But that fellow, Xu Yuntian, has been collecting ‘security fees’....”

“You fool! Would Counsellor Ye believe that fellow or these fellows from the Sword Alliance?”

The black robed old man was slightly stunned, and then a wisp of ridicule curled up on his mouth, “Weren’t you very strong? Let’s see how great you are later.”
