Chapter 502 – A So-called Genius!

Qin Chuan grinned as he gazed at Yang Ye. There wasn’t a trace of fear in his eyes because of the corpses all over the ground, and there was only a warm smile and confidence on his face.

The Ascension Sect was a Ninth Rank Sect, so it was impossible to join such a sect without being a peerless genius. Qin Chuan just happened to be a genius amongst geniuses. He’d attained the ninth rank of the Spirit Realm at the age of 19, and he became the younger ninth rank Spirit Realm profounder in the last 100 years of the Ascension Sect’s history. Moreover, he was very likely to be the youngest Exalt Realm expert in the Ascension Sect as well!

So, the Sect Master of the Ascension Sect had taken Qin Chuan as his own personal disciple and had even given him a Pseudo Dao Artifact. Qin Chuan’s combat strength had instantly multiplied upon obtaining the Pseudo Dao Artifact, and it was even possible for him to kill Exalt Realm experts. Even some Supreme Elders of the Ascension Sect had left their secluded cultivation to provide him with guidance as they felt that he was the future hope for the sect!

It wasn’t the Ascension Sect which had sent him to look for Yang Ye this time, and he’d come here on his own. Because Yang Ye’s reputation was truly too great and killing Yang Ye would allow his reputation to shock the entire continent. Moreover, he felt that he wouldn’t lose to anyone in the same realm of cultivation, even the Sword Emperor and Martial God!

Yang Ye grinned to Lu Wan’er to indicate that she shouldn’t be nervous, and then he turned around to glance at Qin Chuan’s group as he said, “The Ascension Sect? I never expected that even the Ascension Sect has become Luo Jun’s dog. Alright, let’s cut the crap. Are all of you going to fight me as a group?”

“No!” Qin Chuan shook his head and said, “A gentleman doesn’t bully others with numbers. I asked my junior brothers to come with me to bear witness to the battle and prevent you from fleeing.”

“You want to fight me in a one on one battle?” Yang Ye was astounded.

Qin Chuan nodded, and then he opened up his right palm before a sword which was covered in a cold glow appeared in his grasp. Qin Chuan placed the flat of the sword against his forehead while his left finger pressed down upon its tip. He said, “Yang Ye, rumors say that the Sword Emperor is the best amongst all sword cultivators, and it’s said that no sword cultivators stand before the Sword Emperor. I, Qin Chuan, am not very capable, but I want to see if the rumors are true!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a ray of light suddenly erupted from within him, and it remained condensed around Qin Chuan without dispersing.

8th level Sword Intent! Yang Ye was slightly surprised. He hadn’t expected that this fellow had actually attained 8th level Sword Intent. After all, this fellow was only around the age of 20 yet had attained the ninth rank of the Spirit Realm and even comprehended 8th level Sword Intent. Besides An Nanjing, Mo Ke, and Luo Xue, this fellow was the most monstrous genius that Yang Ye had seen!

Yang Ye flipped his palm, and then Dragonbone appeared in his hand. He said, “That sword in your hand is a Pseudo Dao Artifact, right?”

“That’s a good discerning gaze you have!” Qin Chuan said, “It’s called Frostlight! It was given to me by my master. Yang Ye, I don’t want to win an unfair battle. You have a Dao Artifact yourself, so use it. I want to defeat you in an upright manner and allow the world to know that the so-called Sword Emperor isn’t invincible. The reason they couldn’t defeat you is only because they were weak!”

“I don’t need a Dao Artifact to deal with you. Come at me!” Yang Ye pointed his sword at Qin Chuan while he gazed calmly at him. Actually, it should be said that Yang Ye was looking at Qin Chuan’s sword. Yes, he’d taken a liking to it.

“They say that you, Yang Ye, are arrogant to the extreme. I never expected that it would be true. Fine, I’ll make you pay for your arrogance today!” The glow Qin Chuan emanated grew increasingly denser and fiercer. In the next moment, Qin Chuan suddenly slashed Frostlight at Yang Ye. Countless rays of light transformed into a blizzard of the sword that was over 30m tall. The blizzard was seemingly material when enhanced by his 8th level Sword Intent, and the formidable might of his Sword Intent and the pressure it emanated caused the other disciples of the Ascension Sect to dare not look right at his attack!

However, Yang Ye had no intention of dodging it!

The blizzard collided with Yang Ye’s body, and then the others watched in astonishment as the blizzard seemed to enter Yang Ye’s body and vanish.

Qin Chuan’s eyes opened wide, and they were filled with disbelief.

Yang Ye greedily took a deep breath. Needless to say, the feeling of devouring Sword Intent was really not bad. Yang Ye felt that if this fellow continuously exerted his Sword Intent against him while he just absorbed it without end, then he might be able to attain perfection in Sword Intent very soon!

“How could that be possible? You.... How could that be possible....” Qin Chuan gazed at Yang Ye with disbelief. This had completely exceeded the scope of his understanding. After all, it was 8th level Sword Intent! But it was gone just like that!

Qin Chuan refused to believe it, and he swung his sword again. A strand of sword qi shot out explosively, yet Yang Ye still didn’t dodge and allowed it to enter his body. Yang Ye had no choice but to admit that Sword Intent and sword qi were like medicinal herbs to him, and he actually felt extremely comfortable when the Sword Intent and sword qi entered his body!

“You....” Suddenly, Qin Chuan seemed to have thought of something, and it caused his expression to change. He pointed a finger at Yang Ye in disbelief and said, “You... you’ve attained 9th level Sword Intent?”

The expressions of the others from the Ascension Sect changed drastically when they heard him.

Yang Ye didn’t answer Qin Chuan. His figure flashed and appeared before Qin Chuan. The latter was astounded, and he stabbed swiftly with his sword. However, his sword had merely travelled halfway when a terrifying pressure pressed down upon him, causing the glow on his sword to instantly vanish. Qin Chuan was horrified. At this moment, he truly understood that Yang Ye’s Sword Intent had attained the 9th level!

That was his last thought because a sword had stabbed through his chest!

After he killed Qin Chuan, Yang Ye gestured with his right hand and caused Frostlight to fall into his grasp. Meanwhile, the others from the Ascension Sect had recovered from their shock. Their countenances had turned pale when they saw Qin Chuan’s corpse. Qin Chuan was a peerless genius of the Ascension Sect, and he was the personal disciple of the Sect Master. Since he’d left the sect in secret with them and was killed by Yang Ye, they were able to imagine the outcome that awaited them!

“Kill Yang Ye and avenge Senior Brother Qin Chuan!” One of them shouted these words, and then all of them pounced at Yang Ye.

Rays of light flashed incessantly from Yang Ye’s sword, and all of them were lying on the ground in less than 15 minutes of time.

“Young Master Yang....” Meanwhile, Lu Wan’er walked over to Yang Ye with the intention of saying something. However, Yang Ye frowned before turning around to look at the sky behind him. He pondered deeply for a moment before he placed his right hand around Lu Wan’er’s waist, and then he utilized the Ninth Hell Swordwings to vanish on the spot.

Less than 10 minutes after Yang Ye left, a middle aged man appeared at the entrance of Huntsman City. He frowned upon noticing the corpses that covered the ground. Suddenly, his gaze descended onto Qin Chuan’s corpse, and his figure stiffened. Moreover, his eyes instantly turned crimson red while his countenance turned horrifyingly savage.

“AH!!! Yang Ye!!! I swear that I, Qin Tian, will kill you!” The middle aged man roared like a wild beast.

Meanwhile, an old man in a blue robe appeared before the city gates. He gazed at the middle aged man who had Qin Chuan’s corpse in his arms, and then the old man shook his head and sighed. “I was still too late!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

As soon as he finished speaking, a cold glow flashed through the old man’s eyes as he said, “What a Sword Emperor! He has actually attained 9th level Sword Intent. Besides An Nanjing, he’s definitely invincible amongst the younger generation!”

Qin Tian bowed to the old man and said, “Sect Master, please save Little Chuan!”

The old man glanced at Qin Chuan’s corpse before he shook his head and said, “If it was an ordinary injury from a sword, then I would be able to bring him back to life even if his heart was injured. However, this is no ordinary injury. Yang Ye’s Sword Intent has attained the 9th level, and it completely destroyed the vitality within Little Chuan. Even I am helpless against that!”

Qin Tian’s face was covered in dejection when he heard this, but it quickly turned into a ferocious expression.

“I know you want to avenge him, but even you aren’t able to defeat Yang Ye now, and he might even kill you instead. Take Little Chuan’s body back to the Qin Clan for a proper burial. He is a disciple of my Ascension Sect, so he should naturally be avenged by my Ascension Sect as well!” said the old man in a low voice.

“Sect Master, are you going to make a move against him?” Qin Tian raised his head and gazed at the old man.

The old man shook his head and said, “I can’t act against him because of certain reasons. However, it doesn’t mean that my Ascension Sect can’t kill him. I’ve ordered Liu Changyuan to return to the sect. It shouldn’t be difficult for him to kill Yang Ye with the strength he possesses!”

“Liu Changyuan?” Qin Tian was shocked. “The King of Spears, Liu Changyuan, who fought 3 Exalt Realm experts without losing while at the ninth rank of the Spirit Realm 10 years ago? Didn’t he vanish for over 10 years of time? He’s still alive?”

The old man nodded and said, “He merely went to the demon territory to temper himself. He’s at the third rank of the Exalt Realm now. His tempering in the demon territory has allowed his strength to far surpass his peers. Even ordinary ninth rank Exalt Realm experts might not be able to defeat him now. So, it shouldn’t be difficult for him to kill Yang Ye who isn’t even an Exalt Realm expert!”

“Thank you, Sect Master!”

“Alas! What a pity! If I weren’t in closed door cultivation, Little Chuan wouldn’t have suffered such a fate. Alas....”

...

“A group of guards came to our Lu Clan after you left, and they asked about our relationship with you. I told them that there was no relationship between us, and then they started to slaughter my Lu Clan. Besides me, the entire Lu Clan was completely slaughtered in less than 15 minutes. Everyone was dead.” Lu Wan’er had the infant in her arms as she sat on the ground, and her face was covered in tears.

“I’m sorry. I never expected that it would bring such a calamity to your clan!” Yang Ye gazed at Lu Wan’er who was covered in the scars created by whips, and he felt quite guilty in his heart. Because everything she suffered could be said to be his fault.

Lu Wan’er shook her head and said, “It would be no different even if Young Master Yang didn’t appear in my Lu Clan. The Chen Clan has been planning to take control of my Lu Clan for a very long time. Marrying me is merely their method to take control of my Lu Clan. The laughable thing is that my father wasn’t able to see through it!”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment before he said, “Miss Lu, what do you intend to do from now on?”

“I want to become strong!” She raised her head to gaze at him while the gentleness on her face had vanished.

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment before he passed Dragonbone to her, and he said, “You can’t stay in the central territory. Take this sword and head to the southern territory’s Sword Sect. Say that I recommended you to the sect. They’ll take good care of you. As for how far you’ll go in your path of cultivation, all of that depends on your own fortune!”

“I might not be able to arrive at the southern territory!” said Lu Wan’er softly.

Yang Ye withdrew a spatial ring and gave it to her as he said, “There are 100 top-grade energy stones here, and they are sufficient for your cultivation. As for your safety, you don’t have to worry about it at all. You just have to continue travelling towards the southern territory. Someone will be there to protect you on your way!”

She took the spatial ring from him, nodded, and then gazed at the child in her arms. “What about her?”

Yang Ye shrugged and said, “I’m definitely unable to take her with me. If you’re willing, then take her to the sword sect with you; if you’re not, then give her to a family in the vicinity!”

Lu Wan’er nodded, and then she left with the child in her arms. But she merely took a few steps before she stopped, and then she turned around and gazed at Yang Ye.
