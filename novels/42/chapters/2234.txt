Chapter 2235 – The Undying Race’s Plan!

The Demonspawn glanced at Yang Ye with a weird expression in its eyes, “Kid, are you playing some kind of trick again?”

“A trick?” Yang Ye shook his head, “No, absolutely not. Senior, didn’t you want to use my Primordial Violet Energy and Bodhi Tree?”

The Demonspawn replied, “Are you really that generous?”

Yang Ye replied, “Senior, you’re only borrowing, not stealing. It’s my honor to become friends with an expert like you!”

“No! No!” The Demonspawn shook its head, “You’re an absolutely cunning fellow. I don’t trust you. Just name your conditions and we’ll make a fair trade!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

While it hadn’t been in contact with Yang Ye for long, just the previous incident told it that Yang Ye was full of tricks, and it didn’t want Yang Ye to lead it into another trap!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Senior, I’m sincere. I have no ill intent.”

The Demonspawn replied indifferently, “Just name your conditions! Stop all the nonsense!”

Yang Ye sighed, “It’s so hard to be a good person in this world!”

The Demonspawn grunted to itself. A good person? This fellow’s a good person? I’ll never believe that.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “Senior, since you insist on me naming my conditions, then I won’t hold back. Right, I’m sure you’ve noticed the enmity between me and the undying race. They’ll be coming to look for trouble with me soon, so I hope you’ll remain in the city to protect me. Alright?”

The Demonspawn pondered deeply for a long time and said, “Kid, allow me to be honest. I’m afraid you’re no match for them.”

Yang Ye asked, “You’re afraid?”

The Demonspawn glanced at Yang Ye, “There’s no need to egg me on. You should know if they’re strong or not. Those undying cavalry aren’t the problem. It’s very difficult for them to kill you with the strength they possess. However, if that expert behind the door of light comes over, then killing you would probably just take a flip of the palm.”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “Can you deal with that expert?”

The Demonspawn fell silent for a long time before it shook its head.

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Even you can’t?”

The Demonspawn spoke softly, “Kid, you haven’t exchanged blows with that fellow, so you don’t know how terrifying that person is. That person’s strength has surpassed the limits of this universe. It’s very difficult to attain the Progenitor Realm in this universe, and it’s extremely difficult to go above the Progenitor Realm. It would be pretty good if even one appears in tens of thousands of years. However, you don’t have to worry because you have support…”

Yang Ye suddenly said, “I do?”

The Demonspawn asked, “You don’t know?”

Yang Ye asked, “Who?”

The Demonspawn shot a weird glance at him, thought for a while, and said, “Forget that. I agree to your conditions. I’ll stay, but let me warn you in advance, I won’t fight to the death if it’s against someone I don’t stand a chance against.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright!”

Just like that, they formed an agreement.

Yang Ye brought the Demonspawn into the Primordial Pagoda. Currently, he wasn’t afraid of letting outsides inside. While the Demonspawn was formidable, he had An Nanjing and the Primordial Pagoda, so it wouldn’t be too difficult to annihilate the Demonspawn.

In the Primordial Pagoda, the Demonspawn sized up the surroundings and said, “The Primordial Pagoda and Bodhi Tree. There are a total of five Sacred Artifacts, yet you possess three. Looks like you’re a lucky person.”

Yang Ye smiled and said, “Senior, just cultivate here. The Bodhi Tree is over there, and you can go over whenever you want.”

The Demonspawn nodded and was about to speak when it suddenly looked behind Yang Ye. There was a white little fellow jumping around over there.

Snowy!

“A Sprite Lord?” The Demonspawn frowned slightly, “Kid, you’ve really surprised me. You even possess a Sprite Lord. You’re really rich!”

It paused for a moment and continued, “In these chaotic times, a Sprite Lord is even more important and precious. But your strength isn’t bad, so I don’t think many will dare to target you. Even then, it’s best to be careful!”

“Thanks for the reminder!” Yang Ye nodded, and then he took Snowy in his arms and left the Primordial Pagoda.

The Demonspawn glanced at Yang Ye and spoke softly, “He actually dared to let me in here. That kid is really confident in himself!”

It vanished on the spot once it finished speaking.

…

After he left the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye went to the area behind Void Spirit Hall. Su Qingshi and the others lived in the courtyard house here.

After the last battle, he’d rarely been able to spend time with them.

So, for the next few days, Yang Ye just accompanied his family.

On the fourth day, a ray of sword energy suddenly shot up into the sky above the city, and then it vanished into the sky.

At the endless black holes.

Yang Ye had just arrived there when a middle aged man appeared in front of him. It was the god race’s Shi Tian, and Ding Shaoyao was by his side.

Yang Ye asked, “Do you need something?”

Ding Shaoyao nodded slightly, “According to the information we’ve gathered, some of the experts from the undying race and the five progenitors are here. They seem to be planning something. So, I called you here to have a look. If it’s necessary, we can rope them over to our side…”

“Rope them over?” Yang Ye suddenly said, “You must be dreaming!”

Ding Shaoyao glanced at him and said, “They won’t be willing to be dogs for the undying race, and so long as they hold such emotions, we have a chance. We…”

Yang Ye shrugged, “Strategist Ding, allow me to be honest. I’m determined to kill them.”

Ding Shaoyao said, “If they’re willing to take our side, then we…”

“Then I’ll leave!” Yang Ye said, “Strategist Ding, I don’t care about the overall situation. All I do know is that my father and brothers died because of them. Work with them? My brothers and father wouldn’t be able to rest in their graves.”

Ding Shaoyao gazed at him for a long time, “We can’t fight the undying race on our own.”

“So what?” Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “It’s just death. I’ll be frank, I won’t join forces with them. Not ever. If the god race joins forces with them, that’s your business. However, I think that our alliance can end here. We can go our separate ways. Farewell!”

Yang Ye turned around and left.

Join forces with the five progenitors?

If Yang Ye really did that, what would his dead father and brothers think?

The overall situation?

Yang Ye didn’t care about all of that. The five progenitors had joined forces against him, and he would never forget that.

A debt of blood had to be paid with blood!

Meanwhile, Ding Shaoyao obstructed Yang Ye’s path. She glanced at him and said, “It was just a possibility, so there’s no need to be so impulsive.”

“A possibility?” Yang Ye walked over to her, “Miss Ding, you can stop at nothing for the overall situation and your race, but I can’t. I won’t just forget about the dead for the sake of those who are alive.”

“Enough!” Meanwhile, Shi Tian suddenly said, “It’s practically impossible for them to side with us. Unless we possess the strength to fight the undying race. So, let’s not argue about something that hasn’t occurred. Our goal is to see what the undying race and those progenitors are doing.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished into the endless black holes.

Ding Shaoyao glanced at Yang Ye. She was about to speak when Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light and vanished on the spot.

Ding Shaoyao fell silent for a long time, and then she followed them.

The boundless black holes were completely pitch black, and a powerful pulling force was tearing apart everything in its vicinity. However, such a force posed no threat to Yang Ye’s group.

Around two hours later, they stopped. They’d been searching for so long yet hadn’t even found a shadow of the undying race.

Shi Tian said, “Searching like this won’t work!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and summoned the Black Hole Sprite. Presently, it was Snowy’s lackey, and it was always playing with Snowy’s side. So, it was time for it to do some real work.

Yang Ye patted it lightly and said, “Help me see if there are people here.”

However, the Sprite just swayed from side to side, and then it ceaselessly rubbed its head against Yang Ye’s chest. It wanted to go back into the Primordial Pagoda.

It was addicted to staying in there.

It was filled with spirit energy, and it was even extremely pure spirit energy. So, it didn’t want to stay outside for even a moment!

Yang Ye’s face darkened. He patted it lightly, “Find them and you can go inside. Otherwise, you’re staying outside!”

The Sprite instantly became agitated, and it ceaselessly rubbed its head against Yang Ye’s chest.

Yang Ye had no choice but to summon Snowy. Once she was here, it instantly became much more obedient, and it didn’t take long for Snowy’s ‘Divine Might’ to make it unwillingly lead Yang Ye’s group forward.

Yang Ye shook his head and felt defeated in his heart. After all, it didn’t fear him at all, yet it really feared Snowy…

Everything had its own counter!

It didn’t take long for the Sprite to lead them deep into the endless black holes.

Around two hours later, Yang Ye gradually frowned. At this moment, all three of them had quite a bit of vigilance on their faces.

It was because the space around them was extremely unstable. It seemed like some sort of energy was shaking the space here.

It didn’t take long for them to stop, and their expressions changed when they saw the scene before them.
