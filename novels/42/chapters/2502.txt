Chapter 2503 – Limitbreaker!

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye’s aura was growing stronger and stronger, and the space around him gradually started to ripple.

Just like that, a long time passed before a wave of powerful pressure swept out from him.

Bang!

The entire cultivation room shook violently!

Yang Ye stood up and clenched his fists, causing space to ripple!

The Two World Realm!

After he consumed the inner core, Yang Ye’s body had finally advanced to the Two World Realm!

The Two World Realm in the body!

At this moment, his strength had improved tremendously.

However, it wasn’t the end because he started to improve his cultivation!

Once he stopped suppressing it intentionally, his aura grew stronger and stronger, and it didn’t take long for him to attain the Two World Realm!

His body and cultivation had improved in succession!

His strength had risen tremendously!

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he went to the world on the 1st level of the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye shot through the clouds on his sword!

Fast!

His Sword Control Technique was fast to the absolute limit. Besides that, two flying swords shot through the sky, and every one of them left a long mark in the air!

Release!

Yang Ye had just improved his cultivation, so he wanted to release himself to his heart’s content. He felt like he was full of energy right now!

After he activated the Sword Domain, his flying swords grew even faster.

Yang Ye withdrew Executor in midair, glanced at it, and smiled, “It seems I should go look for Senior Chen Xuanan to get you completely unsealed!”

Completely unsealed!

He was confident in being able to control Executor in its fully unsealed form!

If it was fully unsealed, his strength would grow even more terrifying!

However, it was still far from sufficient because his enemy was Eternal Kingdom! It was a power that didn’t just possess numerous Five World Realm experts, it had Lord Realm experts, and even experts above the Lord Realm. His current strength was far from sufficient to go against the Eternal Kingdom!

So, in determining if he was strong or not, it depended on who his opponent was!

Suddenly, Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda, and Emerald was outside his room.

Yang Ye said, “Come in!”

She entered the room and said, “Young Master Yang, you must head out to the city to fight against our enemies!”

“Enemies? The desolate race is attacking?” Yang Ye blurted out.

She glanced at him with a strange expression in her eyes, “Of course not! It’s the army of demon beasts!”

The army of demon beasts!

Yang Ye frowned, “This is the War Dimension, yet demon beasts are attacking?”

Emerald explained, “The Demon Dimension is part of the War Dimension. Their responsibility is to fight the desolate race too. Now, for the sake of tempering everyone’s strength, the higher-ups don’t prohibit battle between us. Simple speaking, it’s a fight for resources. We need resources to cultivate here, we need World Crystals. The demons are attacking for World Crystals, and we humans attack the demons for similar reasons. In short, it’s quite a complicated relationship!”

After thinking about it for a while, Yang Ye came to an understanding!

Competition!

Eternal Kingdom was fostering these geniuses by giving them high degrees of freedom and forcing them to survive here. They had to go through endless battles to maintain their own combat strength and improve themselves!

It was a very brutal method, but it was absolutely effective!Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Obviously, the desolate race had instilled fear in Eternal Kingdom all those years ago!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and asked, “Can I refuse?”

She nodded, “Yes, but you have to pay 50 World Crystals.”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Emerald spoke indifferently, “Young Master Yang, demon attacks are no joke. While we are fostered here as geniuses, people die here. The demons won’t hold back during their attacks. Once the city is breached, countless people will suffer miserable deaths. Unite! At times like this, even if some powers were in severe conflict, they would all unite against our common enemy!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Let’s go have a look then!”

He left the hotel. At this moment, it was night, and stars filled the sky while a tense atmosphere filled the city.

Yang Ye went to the city walls on his own. At this moment, some people were gathered here, and the weakest among them was at Limitbreaker Realm. There were many, many Four World Realm experts here! Moreover, all of them possessed thick auras and were clearly Four World Realm experts who’d attained their strength through their own hard work!

Besides that, Yang Ye sensed a few powerful auras!

They were obscure and hidden within the crowd!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and didn’t see Mo Ya’s group.

Yang Ye looked up into the distance. It was completely pitch black, and he couldn’t see anything.

Rumble!

Suddenly, the ground started to quake more and more violently, and then a wave of powerful pressure slammed down from afar!

Demons!

Hundreds of powerful demons were dashing over like an army from afar, and the demons weren’t just coming from this direction, they were coming from the other two directions as well!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and he noticed that the weakest demon among them was at the Limitbreaker Realm!

The Limitbreaker Realm!

Yang Ye frowned. Isn’t this a little frightening?

At this moment, he thought of something—Limitbreaker Realm experts as numerous as dogs!

It was quite unusual!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to notice something. He discovered that the cultivations of these demon beasts was quite weak! Their auras weren’t that stable, and they didn’t seem like they’d advanced through normal means.

There were some Four World Realm demon beasts among them, but they were too, too inferior when compared to Oxxy and the others!

Meanwhile, a voice resounded in Yang Ye’s ears, “You think their cultivations are weak and unstable?”

Yang Ye turned around and saw the woman with the veil, Xing Biqing!

Yang Ye nodded, “A little!”

Xing Biqing explained softly, “There’s a fruit in Eternal Kingdom, the Limitbreaker Fruit. It can help these demons attain the Limitbreaker Realm. Since it’s done by force with a fruit, their cultivations aren’t very stable, but it can be mended.”

Yang Ye said, “Battle!”

Xing Biqing nodded, “The leader of the demon race is an extraordinary existence! He has control over the Limitbreaker Tree of Eternal Kingdom, and the higher-ups have made many allowances for him. Besides resources, the main reason they launch attacks against us is to use us to train their forces. Because every one of these demons that can survive around 10 of these attacks would become true elites of the demon race.”

Yang Ye asked, “Aren’t you afraid of internally exhausting your own forces?”

She glanced at him, “The Eternal Lord said this—Either die at the hands of your own, or die at the hands of the desolate race. If we don’t work hard to improve ourselves now, we’ll be souls that perish beneath the blades of the desolate race!”

Yang Ye glanced at the experts on the city wall. He didn’t see any fear in their eyes, only excitement and fervor!

Battle!

They yearned for battle!

Meanwhile, Xing Biqing added, “They walk away with spoils from every battle, like the inner cores, blood, and other parts of the demon beasts. Besides that, those who survive the battles will be rewarded with two World Crystals. If one survives a second battle, the reward is three World Crystals, and so on and so forth!”

She glanced at Yang Ye and spoke indifferently, “It’s my 9th time now. If I survive this battle, I’ll be rewarded with 11 World Crystals!”

Yang Ye asked, “What if they die?”

She replied, “Their corpses will be sent home, and their family will get a spot, a spot to enter the War Dimension. Of course, certain conditions have to be met.”

At this moment, the demon army had arrived near the city. Meanwhile, the experts on the city wall couldn’t restrain themselves any longer. They leaped off the wall and charged at the demon arm.

They took the demon army to be their prey. Meanwhile, the demons had excitement and fervor in their eyes too. It was because if they survive, they wouldn’t just obtain the World Crystals possessed by these humans, they would get better rewards once they returned home!

Surviving was repaid with rewards!

It didn’t take long for both sides to enter into combat. Needless to say, the humans possessed extremely terrifying combat strength, and they weren’t any weaker than the demons in their own realm of cultivation!

Yang Ye gazed at Xing Biqing, “Aren’t you going down there?”

She shook her head, “They aren’t the true elites of the demon race. My opponents are their Five World Realm experts. I would be breaking the rules if I kill those below the Five World Realm.”

“Rules?” Yang Ye asked, “There are rules?”

She replied, “Kings fight kings, and soldiers fight soldiers! That’s the rule. Otherwise, if a Five World Realm expert attacked a Four World Realm expert, do you think the Four World Realm expert can survive? That isn’t tempering, that’s a slaughter! It’s pointless! Only a battle against the Five World Realm experts of the demon race will benefit experts like us!”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “But you can head down there. Of course, it’s only for today. The demon race will definitely send an expert at the same level to fight you next time!”

Yang Ye glanced at the battle below and shook his head, “I’m not interested.”

She nodded and didn’t say anything.

But it didn’t take long for her to seem like she’d thought of something, and she said, “Once this is over, be careful of the Leng Clan!”

The Leng Clan!

Yang Ye said, “Can I ask you something?”

She replied, “Go on!”

Yang Ye asked, “Is there a woman in the Leng Clan called A’Leng?”

A'Leng!

Xing Biqing fell silent for a short while and replied, “Do you know her full name?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “All I know is she’s from the Leng Clan, and her name is A’Leng.”

Xing Biqing nodded slightly, “I’ll help you inquire about it later!”

Yang Ye replied, “Thank you!”

She suddenly looked off into the distance, “A Demon King is here.”

A colossus that seemed like a mountain crashed down from the distant sky.

Its aura was extremely powerful!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He knew that the War Dimension’s strength was much, much stronger than he’d imagined!
