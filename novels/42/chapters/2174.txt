Chapter 2175 – The Monkey!

Changing the laws of the heavens and the earth!

It was naturally the Laws of the Universe that were being changed. Everything in the world had laws that it followed, and Snowy was restoring the spirit energy in Sky Sky Continent. That was no different than going against the heavens!

She was truly defying the heavens at this moment!

Snowy blinked when she saw the blood red lightning, and then she gazed at Yang Ye with slight fear in her eyes.

Yang Ye grinned, “Don’t worry, I’m here!”

Snowy cracked a smile when she heard him.

After that, he appeared in the sky, and his face remained expressionless as he gazed at the blood red bolt of lightning. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

It was much stronger than any of the lightning he’d ever encountered, and the energy it carried was sufficient to instantly annihilate a Sage. So, Yang Ye didn’t dare to act carelessly.

In an instant, a sword appeared in his grasp.

Judgment!

As soon as it appeared in his grasp, a ray of sword energy shot up and slammed against the lightning.

Boom!

The powerful sword energy Yang Ye released made the lightning shake violently, but it didn’t shatter. Meanwhile, another ray of sword energy shot up into the air and struck it.

Boom!

A loud explosion resounded once more. An instant later, the lightning exploded apart. But at the instant that happened, countless arcs of electricity scattered throughout the sky, and they descended swiftly.

Suddenly, Little Sky said, “Don’t let them hit the ground!”

Yang Ye nodded. He stomped his foot down, and then countless rays of sword energy shot forward.

They tore through the sky like shooting stars, and it was an extremely shocking sight!

A short while later, all of the arcs of electricity had been blasted into bits by Yang Ye’s sword energy, and the sky returned to calm.

However, Yang Ye felt like something had descended upon him!

It felt extremely uncomfortable!

Yang Ye looked up at the sky and said, “Little Sky, do you think the destiny that people speak, is it a person, or something else?”

Little Sky shook her head slightly, “I don’t know.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “Everything in the universe, including us, definitely exist for a reason. If destiny is a person, then it was that person who created us? Yet now, that person wants to destroy us?”

Yang Ye smiled, “If it really is a person, then wouldn’t it be too terrifying. Moreover, I think that if someone could attain such a level and be able to create all things in this universe, then that person would have no need to use the End Times to annihilate all things in this universe. It would probably just take a wave of the hand.”

He looked up at the sky, and there was a trace of icy coldness in his eyes.

Earlier, he was certain that something had descended upon him.

It was an invisible thing!

According to his own inference, something had taken note of him after he destroyed that divine lightning from before!

A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, and then he gazed at Snowy, “I’m saving Sky Sky Continent today!”

The spirit energy in Merak System gradually returned to normal with Snowy’s help.

However, it didn’t make Yang Ye and Little Sky happy. Because returning to normal didn’t represent it returning to how it had been. Snowy had merely used her ability to make Merak System have spirit energy again. Simple speaking, she’d extended its life, but it wasn’t eternal. It had merely slowed down its death.

The End Times!

Yang Ye fell silent. At this moment, he finally understood how terrifying those words were.

The spirit energy in the large universe wasn’t made to go missing by man, and it was the living beings of the large universe which had finished the spirit energy.

Spirit energy wasn’t endless!

So, it was an impossible problem!

Karma!

At this moment, Yang Ye thought of that word. The living beings of the universe had used the spirit energy here without trying to limit themselves at all, so when the spirit energy in the universe vanished, their karma had arrived!

It was the cycle of karma!

Yang Ye gazed at Snowy, “It’s truly laughable that they are placing their hopes on you!”

Not to mention one Sprite Lord, even ten Sprite Lords couldn’t save the large universe. After all, a Sprite Lord wasn’t a god. However, the End Times was really coming, and it was absolutely easy for her to survive with her special abilities.

Yang Ye shook his head, restrained his thoughts, and said, “If Merak System really dies, then it’s the fault of the people from Merak System itself, including my fault. If I die from the End Times, it’s my own fault as well. So, come with me, alright?”

Little Sky remained silent.

Snowy waved her claws at Little Sky as well. She wanted Little Sky to come with them too.

Yang Ye added, “You can’t do much if you stay here. Moreover, Merak System will be able to last for a year or two now. But I’m sure you’re aware of what will happen once the spirit energy in other worlds vanishes while Merak System still has spirit energy. At that time, the experts of countless words will come here to take the spirit energy here. In that way, it won’t even take a year or two. Just a month or two will be sufficient for all the spirit energy to vanish. Who can resolve such endless and unstoppable conflict?”

While he was advising her to leave, he’d decided that he would take her by force, if he had to!

He would absolutely not let her die with Merak System!

It was utterly meaningless!

Little Sky remained silent for a long time before she said, “This is my home, my roots!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “You’re wrong, Little Sky.”

She gazed at him, and he smiled, “Are Snowy and I not your family?”

She was slightly stunned.

Yang Ye continued, “If you’re able to help the living beings here by staying, then I would absolutely not stop you. But the problem is that your presence won’t make a difference. Staying is no different than committing suicide. As for the home you spoke of, your home is where your loved ones are. Snowy and I are your loved ones, right?”

Little Sky gazed at them for a long time, and then she suddenly grinned.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief when he saw this.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. There were countless worlds throughout the large universe where fighting and killing for spirit energy was going on!

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something, and then he shook his head and said, “When did I become so kind hearted? I actually started thinking about things like this!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot with Little Sky and Snowy.

Yang Ye shot through outer space on his sword. He had to rush back to the Human Dimension and discuss the human race’s future with the other Sages.

He was the leader of the human race, so he naturally had to find a way out for the human race. Moreover, the human race was definitely facing many problems now, like the drying up of spirit energy and killing each other!

If it were in the past, he would naturally ignore it all. But he couldn’t do that now!

As soon as he returned to the large universe, he was about to travel to the Human Dimension when a strand of flames shot through space toward him.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He was about to do something about it, but he was suddenly stunned a little, “It’s you!”

Meanwhile, the flames arrived before him.

It dispersed to reveal the monkey whom Yang Ye hadn’t seen for a long time!

Yang Ye was about to speak when the monkey suddenly grabbed his shoulder, “I have something to discuss!”

He vanished on the spot with Yang Ye.

Yang Ye felt speechless.

The Demon Dimension!

The monkey brought Yang Ye to the Demon Dimension.

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

The monkey glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Is the demon race enemies with you right now?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Yes, but it doesn’t matter. You’re you, and the demon race is the demon race!”

He looked Yang Ye in the eye, “Help me take control of the demon race, and then the demon race will become allies with the human race!”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he asked, “You want to take control of the demon race? Why?”

The monkey looked up at the sky, “To fight against the Buddhist Path, and to find a way out of this for my Spirit Ape Clan. Instead of following the Sovereign of Sky, it’s better to follow you. We may have a chance to survive if we stay with you!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Can’t you take control of the demon race with your strength?”

He shook his head slightly, “The Demon God and the Buddhist Path, I can only deal with one of them!”

The Demon God and Buddhist Path!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “I’m afraid it’s not that simple. If you try to take control of the demon race, the Alliance of All won’t just let that happen. So, it isn’t just the Demon God and the Buddhist Path, there’s the Alliance of All too. Most importantly, how many demon kings actually support you?”

The monkey glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Qiong Qi!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Qiong Qi!

Yang Ye had naturally not forgotten that fellow!

Yang Ye thought for a long time and said, “It’s quite difficult. Allow me to be honest, if you can’t get the support of all the Sages in the demon race, then killing the Demon God and annihilating those who oppose you will just cause the demon race to suffer severe losses.”

The monkey fell silent.

Yang Ye continued, “It’s not that I refuse to help you, but I think that we have to discuss it properly. Like how will you get the support of the other Sages in the demon race. If you can get their support, I’ll help you deal with the Alliance of All and the Buddhist Path.”

The monkey thought for a long time, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “There’s only one way. You step forward and convince them. Because you have the Sprite Lord, and you may be able to make them take our side by using that.”

The Sprite Lord!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded, “Then let’s give it a try!”

Yang Ye gazed at the monkey at this point and asked, “Brother Monkey, what happened at the Buddhist Path?”

The monkey replied indifferently, “I killed a few Sages, and then I had to flee when the Buddhist Progenitor acted against me.”

The Buddhist Progenitor!

Yang Ye glanced at him, This fellow is really strong!

After all, he’d actually been able to escape a progenitor!
