Chapter 1178 – Searched Thousands Of Worlds!

“Let’s go!” Ye Liuyun didn’t hesitate at all. She immediately gave the order and shot towards the distance.

The others hesitated for a moment before quickly following her as well. Nan Shuang wanted to stay back, but she was dragged away by Mu Canglan and the others.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye stopped moving, and 35 grey robed cultivators stood not too far away from him. All of them were Quasi Emperors!

Quasi Emperors are numerous like dogs here! Yang Ye tightened his grip on the ancient sheath as he gazed at the Quasi Emperors here. Dark Hell Continent didn’t have a Heaven Dao, so it allowed many to attain the Quasi Emperor Realm. However, their quality couldn’t compare to the Radiant Dimension. The Quasi Emperors of the Radiant Dimension had survived their respective heavenly tribulations, and those who didn’t possess sufficient strength had been obliterated by their heavenly tribulations.

So, the strength of those who survived would definitely not be bad.

As for the Quasi Emperors of Dark Hell Continent, many of them weren’t as strong as they should be. Because they hadn’t experienced any heavenly tribulations. Besides the huge improvement of his strength, that had been the other reason why he’d been able to kill Quasi Emperors with such ease just now!

The person who led the group before Yang Ye was a grey robed old man. The 2 other Quasi Emperors from Doomsday City who’d fled earlier were standing by the old man’s side.

The grey robed old man gazed at Yang Ye and asked, “You killed the members of my Doomsday City?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I did!”

The old man’s face instantly fell, “How dare you!”

Yang Ye didn’t speak. He just condensed an intent sword, sheathed it, and then drew it swiftly!

Om!

A ray of sword energy flashed forward while accompanied by a sword howl that shot up into the sky!

It was 150 overlapped Heavenrends! Moreover, it was even enhanced by Void Rank sword intent and slaughter intent!

The space in its path was instantly torn open.

Meanwhile, the grey robed old man and the others’ pupils constricted. Even though they were astounded, the grey robed old man’s reaction wasn’t slow at all. The profound energy within him instantly surged into the black walking stick he held before he slammed it forward!

Hiss!

The walking stick was blasted apart in an instant. The grey robed old man was horrified, and a strand of white light surged out from within him and collided with Yang Ye’s sword energy.

Bang!

An explosion resounded as the old man’s figure was blasted 3km away. Moreover, his chest was in an utterly mangled state.

When they witnessed this scene, the other Quasi Emperors turned around to gaze at Yang Ye and were about to attack. At the same time, Yang Ye sheathed the intent sword again and gazed at them while revealing a ferocious smile, “Bring it!”

Seriousness flashed through their faces as they gazed at Yang Ye with slight fear. Even though Yang Ye was just a Saint, they didn’t dare underestimate him at all. Because the grey robed old man was the strongest amongst them. But even the grey robed old man had almost been killed in an instant, so they would be utterly incapable of resisting that attack!

But they were Quasi Emperors at any rate, and there were so many of them. So, it was naturally impossible for them to be terrified by Yang Ye just like that. Otherwise, they would truly be trash.

They immediately charged at Yang Ye.

Om!

A sword howl resounded as Yang Ye’s figure transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot. After that, the head of the Quasi Emperor at the front of the group instantly flew up into the air.

Blood sprayed out like a fountain!

A moment later, Yang Ye stomped his right foot against the space beneath him, and he transformed into another ray of light that vanished on the spot. Another Quasi Emperor’s head flew into the air.

After that, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light once more.

In less than 5 breaths of time, 5 Quasi Emperors had fallen!

A ray of light flashed, and Yang Ye appeared 3km away. He held the ancient sheath in his grasp, and there was an intent sword sheathed in it while his right hand was holding tightly onto the intent sword’s hilt. He gazed at the experts from Doomsday City while a trace of madness could be seen on his face, “Continue!”

The experts from Doomsday City gazed at him with solemn expressions on their faces while fear filled their eyes. Not a single one of them dared to step forward.

That’s a Saint? That’s an Emperor! He kills Quasi Emperors like slaughtering chicken!

Suddenly, the grey robed old man whom Yang Ye had heavily injured in the beginning asked, “Who are you!”

Yang Ye glanced at the grey robed old man while a cold smile curled up on the corners of his mouth, “Why don’t you take a guess?”

The grey robed old man’s face twitched. Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “You’re not attacking? Then I’m leaving.”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away once he finished speaking.

“Stop right there!” The grey robed old man hurriedly shouted at Yang Ye when he saw Yang Ye turn around and try to leave.

Suddenly, Yang Ye turned around and drew his sword. A ray of sword energy shot at the old man!

It was extremely swift to the point that the Quasi Emperors here were practically incapable of catching sight of it!

At the moment it appeared, the grey robed old man was horrified, and his profound energy surged out and formed a barrier before him.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded as the barrier before the old man shattered into pieces. At the same time, blood sprayed from the old man’s mouth while his figure was blasted over 3km away! Once he stopped moving, he spat out a few more mouthfuls of blood in succession!

Yang Ye gazed at the group of Quasi Emperors, laughed coldly, and then left.

This time, not at a single one of them dared to stop him. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

After Yang Ye left, one of the Quasi Emperors walked over to the old man, “Elder Yu, that fellow’s strength was extraordinary. His identity is definitely not ordinary!”

The old man’s face was extremely gloomy. He remained silent for a long time before he turned around to gaze at one of the middle aged men, “Was it really a ray of light from a sword that took the Divine Grade spirit vein in the ruins?”

The middle aged man nodded, “The tracks of the person who took it vanished after we pursued him for some time. But we saw that fellow from just now standing there instead. However, we ignored him because his cultivation was too low. Now it would seem like the Divine Grade spirit veins is definitely in his possession!”

“The Divine Grade spirit vein!” The grey robed old man clenched his fists slowly. A long time passed before he said, “Come, let’s return to the city first. We’ll discuss this matter after the City Governor and the others return from the ruins of the Sword God’s Palace!”

As soon as he finished speaking, all of them turned around and vanished into the horizon.

...

Yang Ye sat cross-legged in the sky, and there was a trace of blood at the corner of his mouth. At the same time, his body started to crack apart.

Could he defeat over 30 Quasi Emperors? The answer was naturally no! He wasn’t invincible! He’d relied on the ultimate version of Death by a Thought to kill 5 Quasi Emperors in succession just now. But his body suffered a certain amount of harm with every execution of Death by a Thought’s ultimate version.

Even though it was strong, the price he paid wasn’t small!

Of course, the main reason was because he’d fought an Emperor before the battle. He’d utilized the Brink Laws in that battle. Even though he’d injured the Emperor in the end, his body had suffered a certain amount of harm as well. It could be said that he was already injured after his battle with that Emperor.

So, over exhausting himself just now could be considered as piling even more injuries onto himself. So, he would actually have no choice but to flee if they decided to risk their lives against him!

Fortunately, he had sufficient violet crystals now, so such injuries were nothing to him.

An hour later, Yang Ye’s injuries had been practically healed by the Primordial Violet Energy within him. He glanced at the surroundings, frowned, and then closed his eyes. A long time passed before he opened his eyes again, and he spoke softly, “Was I mistaken?” His figure flashed and vanished into the horizon once he finished speaking.

Right after Yang Ye left, a black robed figure suddenly appeared where Yang Ye had been a moment ago.

“Interesting! Truly interesting! I wonder if he’s the person I’ve been looking for.... I’ve been to a few thousand worlds by now.... I hope he doesn’t disappoint me!” As soon as he finished speaking, the black robed man vanished on the spot.

Not long after the black robed man vanished, Yang Ye appeared there once more. He gazed for a long time at the spot the black robed man had stood at, and then he vanished on the spot.

...

Cloudfall City.

Yang Ye frowned when he arrived at Cloudfall City. Because Ye Liuyun and the others were being surrounded at the entrance of the city. Yang Ye glanced through the area and noticed that the strengths of the group which had surrounded Ye Liuyun and the others was actually not bad. There were almost 17 Quasi Emperors and a few thousand Saints amongst them!

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to go to Ye Liuyun’s side. The members of the Sword Alliance instantly heaved sighs of relief when they saw Yang Ye return safely. It could be said that Yang Ye was their pillar of confidence and support right now.

Yang Ye gazed at Ye Liuyun, “What’s going on?”

“We were too late. The Cyclops Mercs took Cloudfall City.” Ye Liuyun sent Yang Ye a voice transmission at this point, “They have a bad reputation. Especially their leader, Song Jiji. There are no limits to what he’s capable of. He seduced his past leader’s wife, Ma Rong, to kill his past leader and seize control over the mercenary group. He’s ruthless and infamous! So, we didn’t want to offend him and intended to leave. However, he refused to allow it and insisted on us paying him 5,000 violet crystals as toll. Besides that, he wants me, Canglan, and Nan Shuang.”

Yang Ye turned around to glance at the middle aged man who led the group. The middle aged man was a Quasi Emperor as well. His eyes were covered by translucent patches, and he carried a large saber on his shoulder. Besides that, he had a vicious and wretched appearance. It was clear at first sight that he wasn’t a good person.

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and said, “First come, first served. Since they were here first, then let’s leave!”

Ye Liuyun glanced at Yang Ye and nodded.

Right when Yang Ye and the others were about to leave, Song Jiji suddenly spoke from afar, “You’re going to leave just like that?”

Yang Ye stopped and turned around to look at Song Jiji, “What? You want us to stay for food?”

“Food?” A slight smile curled up on the corners of Song Jiji’s mouth, “There’s no food here, but we do have shit. Do you want some?”

Yang Ye gazed at Song Jiji. He was about to speak when Song Jiji suddenly chuckled, “Could it be that you really want to eat shit? It can’t be, right? You actually have such interests!”

As he spoke, the other members of the Cyclops Mercs instantly started roaring with laughter.

Yang Ye turned around and gazed at Ye Liuyun, “Order the others to prepare some shit. Right, get 5kg of it. I’m going to make him eat it mouthful by mouthful! Not one mouthful less!”

Ye Liuyun was speechless.
