Chapter 2479 – Never Submit!

Just like that, the Primordial Pagoda had a new pool of lightning.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye didn’t know what level the lightning was at. In any case, he knew that even Erya couldn’t resist them!

Erya could resist a single bolt, but she couldn’t resist an entire pool of it.

Now, the entire pool belonged to Snowy.

At the entrance of Desolate City, Huang Ying sent Yang Ye off.

Huang Ying cupped his fists to Yang Ye, “Brother Yang, be careful on your trip to Eternal Kingdom.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Farewell!”

Yang Ye turned around and vanished on the spot.

Once Yang Ye left, Huang Tianxing and Huang Ye appeared behind Huang Ying. Now, Huang Tianxing and Huang Ye were Huang Ying’s right-hand men.

The people of the desolate race were very united!

Huang Ye suddenly said, “You should have made him stay!”

Huang Tianxing nodded to display his agreement.

Huang Ying spoke softly, “Are you worried that the Sprite Progenitor and him will fall into Eternal Kingdom’s hands?”

Huang Ye and Huang Tianxing nodded.

Yang Ye had the Sprite Progenitor with him, so if they fell into the hands of Eternal Kingdom, it would definitely be extremely disadvantageous to the desolate race.

Huang Ying grinned, “No, he won’t fall into their hands.”

Huang Tianxing and Huang Ye didn’t say anything.

Huang Ying glanced at them, “Our desolate race cannot be arrogant and conceited like it was. I’ll leave gathering the strength of all the worlds to the two of you.”

Huang Ye nodded, “I’ve gotten the support of quite a few worlds, including the Hell World. They are on our side. However, Eternal Kingdom is doing the same, and their conditions are much better than what we are promising.”

Huang Ying nodded slightly, “Try your best. Anyway, what is the Di Clan’s attitude toward all of this?”

Huang Tianxing spoke solemnly, “Their attitude is quite vague. They were leaning toward us before this, but after that incident with Yang Ye, their attitude has become quite vague. According to my knowledge, they have started to come in contact with Eternal Kingdom.”

Huang Ying fell silent for a long time and said, “Big Brother, go ask them for a certain answer. Tell the Sky Lord to go with you!”

Huang Tianxing glanced at him and said, “I understand!”

Both of them vanished on the spot.

Huang Ying looked into the distant sky, “Brother Yang, I don’t have many friends. I don’t want to lose you. So, keep a low profile in Eternal Kingdom!”

Huang Ying turned around and left.

…

Eternal Border. Sword Sky City.

Yang Ye returned the corpse of Sword Sky City’s founder, the Sword Master, to them.

When he saw the corpse, the Master of Sword Sky City, Fen Tianyu, had quite a complicated expression on his face. A long time passed before he calmed himself and gazed at Yang Ye, “Thank you!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “It was nothing.”

Fen Tianyu hesitated for a moment and asked, “Chaos is arriving. What should my Sword Sky City do?”

It was no secret that the desolate race had shown itself. Besides that, there was the Eternal Kingdom and all sorts of other powers. Under such circumstances, survival for smaller powers had become a huge problem.

Sword Sky City!

Yang Ye thought for a while and said, “If you need anything, go to the desolate race and see Huang Ying, the current Crown Prince of the desolate race. He’ll understand if you say that I told you to go to him. However, I’ll be frank. If you go to him, it represents that you’ll be taking the desolate race’s side. To be honest, I have irreconcilable enmity with Eternal Kingdom, so I don’t want to see you join the Eternal Kingdom!”

Fen Tianyu laughed bitterly, “Of course. I understand. But, um… I’m afraid the desolate race won’t want a small power like mine.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Your strength is slightly weak, but you have room for improvement. Of course, you can’t go without any trump cards.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand, and then 10,000 swords floated in the sky above the city.

The sword formation!

All of them were Pseudo Divine Treasures!

Fen Tianyu was astounded, “W-What is this?”

Yang Ye explained, “Consider these 10,000 swords a gift from me to your Sword Sky City. It’s quite a threat to Limitbreaker Realm experts. So, you won’t be completely useless there if you have this formation.”

Fen Tianyu bowed respectfully to Yang Ye, “Thank you!”

It was a sincere expression of gratitude!

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Take care.”

Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Fen Tianyu gazed at the sky. At this moment, he felt very lucky. He felt lucky he’d made the decision he made that day. When countless powers throughout Eternal Border wanted to kill Yang Ye and take Yang Ye’s treasures, Sword Sky City had chosen to be friends with Yang Ye.

The outcome was all the powers who’d once tried to kill him were gone, but Sword Sky City was fine and well. Moreover, everyone knew that Sword Sky City had a good relationship with Yang Ye, so practically no power throughout Eternal Border, including the Guardians, were willing to rashly offend Sword Sky City.

The kindness he’d shown that day had grown into a good outcome!

…

The Nanli Clan.

Only Yang Ye and Nanli Meng were in the hall here.

Nanli Meng asked, “You’re going to Eternal Kingdom?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’m going to go have a look.”

She nodded slightly, “Be careful!”

Yang Ye said, “I came to see you because I wanted you to help me collect information on some people.”

Nanli Meng asked, “Your friends who came to Eternal Border with you?”

Yang Ye nodded.

He'd naturally not forgotten Yang Lianshuang, Sky Maiden, and the others.

Nanli Meng hesitated for a moment and said, “I’ve found some of them for you, but not all of them. For example, those geniuses from the Nether Pavilion, I have no information on them.”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “Why?”

Nanli Meng glanced at him, “Do you really think I’m all powerful? Those women aren’t ordinary, and they have their own fortune and extraordinary aspects. I think you don’t have to worry about them. All of them are extraordinary, and even if they are inferior to you and Miss An, they aren’t much inferior!”

Yang Ye visibly relaxed slightly. None of those sisters from the Nether Pavilion were ordinary people, so perhaps letting them take their own paths was for the best.

Yang Ye asked, “What about the others? Are they in Eternal Border?”

Nanli Meng shook her head, “That woman, Yang Lianshuang, led them to a place called the Origin World. She’s an extraordinary woman who established a small kingdom there. The systems of that kingdom is very, very unique. You should go have a look for yourself.”

The Origin World!

Yang Ye nodded and was about to leave.

Meanwhile, Nanli Meng suddenly said, “According to my knowledge, the Eternal Kingdom’s current Eternal Lord isn’t ordinary at all. Besides that, both the desolate race and Eternal Kingdom seem to be waiting for something. I don’t know what it is, but I do know that once the time comes, both sides will immediately attack. Besides that, Eternal Kingdom is determined to obtain Snowy, so take care!”

Yang Ye glanced at her, “Which side will you take?”

She smiled, “I’ll take whichever side that can keep my clan alive!”

Yang Ye didn’t say anything else and just vanished into the sky.

Once Yang Ye left, the ancestor of the Nanli Clan, Nanli Yin, appeared here. She laughed with ridicule, “He actually plans to head to Eternal Kingdom? He overestimates himself! I…”

Suddenly, Nanli Meng grabbed at Nanli Yin from afar, and then a strand of mysterious energy suddenly enveloped Nanli Yin. The latter was shocked and was about to resist, but she noticed to her shock that the energy instantly tried to shatter her body when she tried to resist it!

Nanli Yin shouted furiously, “Nanli Meng! What are you doing?!”

Nanli Meng gazed at her coldly, “If I’m not wrong, you plan to tell Eternal Kingdom that Yang Ye is going over there, right?”

Nanli Yin replied coldly, “Can’t I?”

Nanli Meng shook her head, “How foolish. The Nanli Clan is doomed in your hands. From this moment onward, you will remain here for 100 years. You will cease to exist for the next 100 years!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she pressed her right palm down. In an instant, an ethereal bell enveloped Nanli Yin.

Nanli Yin cursed madly from within the bell.

Nanli Meng ignored her and looked up at the sky, “Take care!”

A ray of sword energy vanished into the distant sky.

It was Yang Ye!

Nanli had been present during their discussion, but Yang Ye hadn’t made her leave. However, if Nanli Yin left the Nanli Clan, then her head would definitely fall from her neck!

Nanli Meng seemed to be punishing Nanli Yin, but she was actually keeping Nanli Yin safe!

Nanli Meng closed her eyes slowly as she sat there in the hall.

…

Once he left the Nanli Clan, Yang Ye withdrew the Myriad World Diagram, and then he teleported to the Origin World.

The Origin World was tiny, and there were many powers throughout it. According to the information Nanli Meng provided him, Yang Lianshuang and the others were at the southernmost area of it. They had established a country called Huaxia!

A country!

Yang Ye couldn’t help but feel quite amused when he found out.

Around an hour later, Yang Ye arrived before a city’s gates.

There were three characters above it “华夏国”.

Huaxia!

It was called a country, but it was actually just a city!

Obviously, it was Yang Lianshuang who’d created it.

Yang Ye was about to enter the city when a few powerful auras approached from outside the city, and then a wave of pressure enveloped the entire city.

Yang Ye looked over, and he saw a group of people. They were led by a middle aged man at the Limitbreaker Realm!

The middle aged man glanced at the city below and said, “Yang Lianshuang, I’ll give you one last chance. Is this stubborn country of yours going to submit to my Origin Sky Sect or not?!”

A voice suddenly came from within the city, “Huaxia never submits!”
