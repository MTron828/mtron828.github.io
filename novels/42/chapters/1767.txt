Chapter 1768 – Unforeseen Event In the Yang Clan!

Phecda City.

There was a hill in Phecda City, and it was called Meditation Hill. It wasn’t very large, and there weren’t any dangerous beings in it. It was where the disciples of the Yang Clan were sentenced to face walls and contemplate their mistakes.

It was extremely quiet!

At this moment, two young girls were playing happily at the top of the hill.

They were Lei Lin and Yang Nianxue. Even though the Yang Clan was in a terrible situation, it didn’t affect the little girls. It could be said that they were the most carefree people in Phecda City!

In the shadows.

The young man pointed at the little girl and said, “Brother, see that? That’s Yang Ye’s daughter!”

Yang Ye gazed at the little girl and nodded, “I see!”

The young man nodded, “There are experts from the Yang Clan protecting them. So, we can’t act now.”

Yang Ye asked, “What do you need me to do?”

A smile curled up on the corners of the man’s mouth, “Actually, your job is very simple. Just run with me!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Run with you?”

“To be more precise, run in a different direction!” The young man smiled, “I’ll be frank. After we capture her, we’ll split up. So, if the experts of the Yang Clan discover us, they’ll have to split up to chase us. In that way, we’ll face comparatively lesser pressure.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “Of course, that’s the worst case scenario. Because we may not be discovered. Or perhaps, I should say that we would have left Heaven Void Continent when they discover what we’ve done.”

At this moment, Yang Ye finally understood the young man’s plan. Actually, the young man was looking for someone to die for him. Because he had someone in the Yang Clan. So, his informant in the Yang Clan would definitely chase after Yang Ye. Once that person starts chasing after Yang Ye, the others would chase after him too.

At that time, the young man would be able to escape!

It was a very good plan!

Time trickled by, and the two little girls were still playing. Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye suddenly frowned because the two experts from the Yang Clan, who were protecting the little girls, had vanished.

Meanwhile, a wisp of excitement flashed through the young man’s eyes, “Now!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure vanished on the spot, and he appeared before Yang Nianxue and Lei Lin. After that, his hand shot forward to grab Yang Nianxue.

He was extremely swift, and it would take less than half a breath of time for him to grab her!

Lei Lin and Yang Nianxue were stunned when they saw that hand suddenly appear before them.

At this moment, their minds were completely blank.

Suddenly, that hand fell to the ground, and then a torrent of blood sprayed forward. Right when the blood was about to spray on them, it suddenly vanished into thin air, and then a familiar face appeared before them.

Yang Nianxue was slightly stunned, and then she pounced over to that person, “Daddy!”

Yang Ye took her in his arms, kissed her on the cheek, and then he carried Lei Lin in the same arm as well.

“You… you….” Meanwhile, the young man gazed at Yang Ye with horror, “You’re Yang Ye….”

Yang Ye paid no attention to the young man. He put both of the girls down, and then patted their heads and smiled, “Go to mommy. Daddy has business to take care of. Alright?”

“Okay!” Yang Nianxue smiled sweetly, and then she took Lei Lin’s hand and hopped off into the distance.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

At this moment, the experts of the Yang Clan had been alarmed, so over a dozen True Realm experts appeared here.

Meanwhile, two True Realm experts went over to Yang Ye, and one of them lowered his head slightly before Yang Ye, “Young Master Yang, I’m sorry. It’s our fault!”

They were the experts who were entrusted with protecting Yang Nianxue and Lei Lin!

Yang Ye shook his head, “It has nothing to do with you. Why did both of you leave?”

The man spoke in a low voice, “We received a message from Elder Yang Mu. He said he had something urgent to discuss with us!”

Yang Ye suddenly looked towards Phecda Hall, “Yang Mu! Get the fuck out here!”

Bang!

Suddenly, an aura shot up into the air from within Phecda Hall, and it shot towards the depths of space.

He was fleeing!

However, it only took a moment for a ray of black light to appear above that aura.

Boom!

An instant later, an explosion resounded, and a figure crashed down from the sky.

Bang!

The figure slammed against the ground, causing Phecda City to tremble. Three breaths of time later, Yang Lianshuang brought an old man over to Yang Ye and the others.

She tossed the old man on the ground, “Do as you please!”

She turned around and walked away once she finished speaking.

“Patriarch, I didn’t betray the Yang Clan!” Yang Mu hurriedly said, “I didn’t betray the clan! Patriarch, please be merciful!”

Yang Lianshuang stopped and said, “What you did was worse than betrayal of the clan.”

She vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

Yang Mu’s face turned ghastly pale at the sight of this. He turned to look at Yang Ye and ferocity covered his face, “Yang Ye, do you know why I did this? Because….”

A ray of light flashed!

Hiss!

Yang Mu’s head flew up into the air.

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye. Yang Ye sheathed his sword and spoke indifferently, “The process isn’t important. What’s important is that you did it. Since you did it, then you deserve death. As for all that nonsense, save it for your next life!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he gazed at the young man. The young man was about to speak but Yang Ye suddenly said, “Keep your nonsense for your next life too!”

Hiss!

As soon as he finished speaking, the young man’s head flew up into the air. The eyes on that head were opened wide and filled with regret.

He shouldn’t have come. Not only that, he just had to make Yang Ye his escape plan….

After he killed the young man, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

The others exchanged glances and shook their heads.

They felt quite a bit of pity towards Yang Mu because he was still an elder of the Yang Clan. But no one would step forward and beg for mercy on his behalf. Because they were very well aware that it wouldn’t make a difference. What was Yang Ye’s reverse scale? It was his wives and daughter!

Anyone who dared to target them was someone he would definitely kill, and there was no room for discussion.

No one could stop him, including Yang Lianshuang.

Phecda Hall.

At this moment, the core figures of the Yang Clan were present here, and it included Yang Ye.

Yang Lianshuang glanced at the people here and said, “I’m sure all of you know what happened just now. Do you have any thoughts about it?”

They fell silent.

Yang Lianshuang nodded, “Since you’re not saying anything, then I will. Our Yang Clan is in the worst situation it has been in throughout the history of the clan, and I know that all of you think that we won’t be able to get through this. It’s exactly why it’s unavoidable that all of you will think about preparing a way out for yourselves!”

She glanced at them again and continued, “Everyone should be given a chance. I summoned all of you here because I’ve made a decision. If any of you wish to leave the Yang Clan, you may. Not only can you leave, you can take your family with you!”

The expressions of all the people here changed, and the leader of the Council of Elders, Yang Lin, hurriedly said, “Patriarch, what are you….”

Yang Lianshuang waved her hand and said, “You’re all members of the clan, but you have the right to decide on the future of your own lives. I do as I say. Anyone who doesn’t want to stay can leave, and I won’t stop them or act against you later!”

All of them fell silent when they noticed that she didn’t seem to be lying.

If they were to be honest, even if the Yang Clan had forced the alliance of the five clans to retreat, could they do it again? The same strategy wouldn’t work twice, right? Moreover, what would the Yang Clan do then?

They remained silent for a long time before an old man suddenly stepped forward, “Young Miss Lianshuang, I’m withdrawing from the Yang Clan!”

It was an elder from the council of elders, Yang Gui. He was a core figure in the council of elders.

Yang Lianshuang slowly closed her eyes, fell silent for a moment, and said, “Approved!”

Yang Gui bowed slightly to her, “I’m sorry!”

He turned around and vanished from the hall.

Once someone started it, there naturally would be a second. It didn’t take long for another old man to step forward. He wasn’t from the council of elders, he was the Vice Hall Master of the Discipline Hall, Yang You!

He bowed slightly to Yang Lianshuang and said, “I’m sorry!”

He turned around and vanished from the hall.

It didn’t take long for a third, fourth, and fifth to appear.

In just a short while, 11 had left! All of them were True Realm experts!

The hall was deathly silent!

A long time passed before Yang Lianshuang glanced at the 15 remaining True Realm experts here, “What about all of you?”

Yang Lin shook his head slightly, “If you can’t go through the difficulties together, do you have the right to enjoy the wealth and prestige that comes later?”

One of the other old men nodded, “As a clan, we naturally have to go through thick and thin together!”

The others nodded to display their agreement!

A wisp of gratification flashed through Yang Lianshuang’s eyes, “My Yang Clan still has hope.”

She suddenly looked towards the distance. Yang Ye had appeared there.

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “I didn’t expect this to happen!”

Yang Lianshuang shook her head slightly, “This is a good thing. Because if they don’t leave and betray us in the future, then that would be absolutely lethal to us.”

As she spoke, she walked towards the entrance of the hall and looked up at the sky, “A clan has its good days and bad days. I believe that the Yang Clan will thrive. I, Yang Lianshuang, swear on my soul that I’ll definitely make the Yang Clan renowned throughout the world. No, that’s not enough! It’ll make it renowned through a myriad of universes. I’ll make the members of the Yang Clan take pride in possessing this surname.”
