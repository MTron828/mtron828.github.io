Chapter 2333 – The Beginning!

Su Qingshi and the others’ main objective right now was to get Yang Ye to White Emperor City.

Based on Yang Ye’s recuperative ability, it would take just a few days for him to recover completely. So long as he did, then it wouldn’t be that easy for the Immortal Estate to kill him. Of course, they had thought about whether they could get him there safely and protect him from the Immortal Estate until then, but they had no other choice!

Something worth mentioning was that the Sword Gourd had followed them.

However, Snowy, in her state of sorrow, ignored it completely, and it didn’t dare to approach Snowy either.

I was quite afraid of Snowy right now.

Her temper was really terrible.

Su Qingshi gazed at Bai Zhixian, “Our arrival at White Emperor City may bring calamity to it. Are you sure about this?”

Bai Zhixian closed her eyes slowly, “Then do you want me to watch him die?”

Su Qingshi sighed softly and didn’t say more. She gazed at Yang Ye who was in Zhuang Weiran’s arms instead.

Will we be able to get through this?

Regardless of whether they could get through it, they planned to face it together!

Zhuang Weiran gazed at Yang Ye, and the scenes of the past couldn’t help but flash through her mind.

All those years ago, Yang Ye was still so weak…

Suddenly, Sword Scroll, who led the group, stopped.

Su Qingshi and the others' faces fell.

Sword Scroll looked up, and three black robed figures had appeared high above.

Sword Scroll asked, “The Immortal Estate?”

The black robed man who led the group shook his head slightly, “Our objective isn’t Yang Ye, it’s the treasures he possesses. We won’t ask for much, and just want the Bodhi Tree. We’ll leave once we get it.”

The Bodhi Tree!

Sword Scroll sized up the three of them and said, “Have you not heard about how he fought the Immortal Estate and almost annihilated the six clans?”

The black robed man nodded, “We have. But times change, and he’s on the verge of death now, isn’t he?”

A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of Sword Scroll’s mouth. Meanwhile, Bai Zhixian suddenly gazed at Wang Erya and Oxxy. Wang Erya nodded, and then she tapped her foot down and shot at them.

The black robed man who led the group suddenly withdrew an iron sword, and then it stabbed forward like a bolt of lightning.

It stabbed directly against Erya’s fist.

Bang!

The black robed man’s sword instantly cracked open while his figure was blasted away. However, he suddenly vanished into thin air, and then Wang Erya frowned slightly and slammed her fist forward!

Boom!

The space in front of her exploded apart, and then a shrill cry came from there. Wang Erya didn’t stop. Her figure shot at the exploded expanses of space, and it didn’t take long for her to appear before everyone again.

There was a corpse in her grasp.

It was the black robed man from before!

Wang Erya casually tossed it away, and it descended before the other two black robed men. She patted her hands together and started licking a tanghulu, “So weak!”

Erya and Oxxy were unable to resist experts above the True World Realm, just like the old man from the Immortal Estate who fought Yang Ye at the Sword Ruins. They were helpless against experts like that. However, experts at the True World Realm or below were nothing before them. Of course, monstrous geniuses like Yang Ye were excluded.

Suddenly, Sword Scroll’s expression changed slightly, “Erya, watch out!”

Wang Erya’s eyes opened wide because the two black robed men before her had suddenly appeared in front of her. At the same time, two powerful auras locked down the space around her! Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The True World Realm!

They weren’t at the True Void Realm but the True World Realm!

Wang Erya quickly recovered from her shock, but because she’d been careless, she was only able to counterattack in a hurry.

Wang Erya’s fists slammed forward.

Boom! Boom!

Two explosions resounded, and then she was blasted away. At the same time, a black chain pierced through space and coiled around her.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Rays of black light ceaselessly rippled out of the black chain and tried to corrode her body. Fortunately, her body was able to resist the corrosion, but she was visibly in extreme pain.

Oxxy was about to lend her a hand, but Bai Zhixian stopped Oxxy.

Bai Zhixian stared at them and asked, “Who are you?!”

They weren’t from the Immortal Estate yet had sent two True World Realm experts at once. Needless to say, Bai Zhixian was very puzzled. She wondered if there were powers greater than the Immortal Estate in Eternal Border!

One of them replied indifferently, “Those who know, know; those who don’t know, have no right to know. So, do you still want to ask?”

She nodded, “I see.”

She gazed at Su Qingshi as she spoke, the latter fell silent for a moment and closed her eyes slowly.

A moment later, a palm-sized tree floated slowly out of Yang Ye’s stomach.

It was the Bodhi Tree that had shrunk in size!

Su Qingshi flicked it over to them, and the black robed man who led the group took it. After that, he glanced at them, and there was a wisp of ghastly killing intent in his eyes.

“You’re still not going to leave after getting it?” Suddenly, a voice resounded.

The black robed experts looked over, and they saw a woman with a huge sword on her back. At this moment, she was looking coldly at them.

Jian You!

The black robed man fell silent for a long time, and then he said, “Alright, I’ll give your Jian Clan some face.”

He and the other black robed man immediately vanished into the sky.

Once they left, Bai Zhixian gazed at Jian You, “Who are they?”

Jian You closed her eyes slowly, “Just as he said, those who know, know; and those who don’t know have no right to know. I’m not looking down on you, but it does you no good to know right now.”

“Why didn’t they ask for the axe or pagoda?” Bai Zhixian asked. As far as she was concerned, they should be more valuable than the Bodhi Tree, but those experts had asked for the Bodhi Tree. That made her curious.

Jian You glanced at her and replied, “It’s not that they do not want it, but others have probably booked those two treasures.”

Bai Zhixian’s pupils constricted!

Others had booked them!

In other words, this wasn’t the end, it was only the beginning!

Jian You glanced at the surroundings, fell silent for a long time, and then gazed at Snowy. A long time passed before she said, “I’ll send you there!”

Bai Zhixian glanced at her and bowed slightly, “Thank you!”

After what happened just now, she was very well aware that they wouldn’t be able to get to White Emperor City without Jian You.

The world was aware that Yang Ye was heavily injured, so no one would worry about him now, and no power would fear him. Because everyone was very well aware that the Immortal Estate wouldn’t spare him, and they would definitely converge their forces to kill him.

At this moment, everyone wanted to take a share of the spoils!

After all, Yang Ye had quite a few precious treasures!

Jian You glanced at the surroundings, and then she gazed at Snowy, “You go inside the pagoda!”

She was most afraid that someone recognized Snowy. If that happened, Yang Ye would definitely die with the strength he possessed now. Moreover, he would die soundlessly. Not just Yang Ye, everyone except Snowy would die!

A Sprite Progenitor!

A Sprite Progenitor was enough to make all the powerful organizations and old existences of Eternal Border go mad. Moreover, even Eternal Universe would be shaken.

If it was a matured Sprite Progenitor, there would naturally be no one who dared to target her. Moreover, she only had to say the word and even 10 Immortal Estates would be annihilated. But the problem was that she hadn’t matured fully, she was just a Sprite Lord who was transforming into a Sprite Progenitor. So, that was why people were targeting her and even stopping at nothing to take control of her.

It could be said that if Snowy’s existence was exposed, it would definitely cause a storm of blood in Eternal Border.

Snowy wiped off the tears on the corners of her eyes, and then she gazed at Jian You before raising her paws to ask why.

Jian You had quite a weird expression on her face. She wondered if that sad little fellow in front of her would really become a Sprite Progenitor.

Meanwhile, Su Qingshi walked over to Snowy, “Listen to her and go inside for now, alright?”

Snowy blinked, and then she pointed at Yang Ye to display that she wanted to stay with Yang Ye.

Su Qingshi rubbed Snowy’s head and felt quite helpless. In the end, she had no choice but to summon Zi’er. Once Zi’er appeared, she grabbed Snowy in her arms and returned to the pagoda.

While Snowy was quite unwilling, she was quite afraid when she saw the stern expression on Zi’er’s face.

There were only two people whom she feared. Yang Ye, and Zi’er who had sort of raised her. Zi’er had given her quite a few good lessons when she just met Yang Ye!

Once Snowy was dealt with, their group continued toward White Emperor City.

Jian You led the group now!

Meanwhile, the Sword Gourd was still following not too far behind them. When it saw Snowy enter the Primordial Pagoda, it went in as well. However, it only took a moment for it to be kicked out.

The Primordial Pagoda refused it entry!

The Primordial Pagoda was extremely close to Snowy, so it naturally took Snowy’s side.

Sword Scroll glanced at the Sword Gourd, hesitated for a moment, and then walked over to it and whispered a few words.

A short while later, the Sword Gourd shook and transformed into a ray of light that appeared by Yang Ye’s waist!

Staying with Yang Ye was staying with Snowy!

That was what Sword Scroll had told it.

An hour later, Bai Zhixian could faintly see the outline of an ancient city at the end of her vision.

She heaved a sigh of relief, “We’re here!”

Meanwhile, Jian You suddenly stopped, and everyone looked at her!

Jian You closed her eyes slowly, “I’m just sending them to White Emperor City. Please give my Jian Clan some face!”

Meanwhile, an old man in a linen robe appeared not too far away from her. He coughed lightly and said, “I want the Primordial Pagoda. Leave it to me and I’ll give your Jian Clan some face, alright?”
