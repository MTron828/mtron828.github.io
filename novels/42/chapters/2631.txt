Chapter 2632

The Dark Lord fell silent for a short while and said, “You want to go to them?”

Yang Ye’s expression returned to normal, “No, I’m just asking.”

The Dark Lord replied, “If I’m not wrong, they may come to you very soon.”

Yang Ye nodded, “No matter what, thank you for answering my questions.”

Yang Ye turned around and left.

Eternal Border.

Yang Ye went to Eternal Border. He still had some acquaintances here.

The Nanli Clan.

Yang Ye went to the Nanli Clan, and Nanli Meng appeared before him.

She scanned him and smiled, “Long time no see!”

Yang Ye nodded, “It’s been a long time.”

She asked, “Are you coming inside?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I have many other things to do, so I’ll just speak to you out here.”

She nodded slightly, “The desolate race is about to attack!”

Yang Ye said, “I know. What do you plan to do?”

Nanli Meng smiled, “What can I do?”

Yang Ye said, “Don’t get mixed up in the battle between them.”

Nanli Meng smiled, “Why?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “If your Nanli Clan joins the battle at its current strength, it’ll be nothing more than cannon fodder. Just hide, take the Nanli Clan with you and hide. If it’s possible, help me take care of Sword Sky City too.”

The Sword Sky City he mentioned was naturally the same Sword Sky City which had helped him in the past.

In the battle between Eternal Kingdom and the desolate race, these small powers were very likely to be obliterated from the slightest mistake, even the Nanli Clan.

Nanli Meng nodded, “I see. Take care!”

Yang Ye said, “You take care too.”

He turned around and vanished into the sky.

Nanli Meng fell silent for a long time, and then she returned to the Nanli Clan. She stood at the center of the hall for a long time before she spoke abruptly, “Give the order for everyone to come see me immediately. We’re leaving Eternal border.”

“Patriarch…” Meanwhile, a voice came from the shadows, “You’ve attained the legendary Destiny Realm, yet…”

Nanli Meng glanced coldly at the source of the voice, “I asked you to go, so go. Understand?”

“Yes!” The voice didn’t dare to hesitate and hurried off.

It didn’t take long for the entire Nanli Clan to vanish.

Yang Ye didn’t return to Eternal Kingdom immediately. He went to the desolate race.

At this moment, the desolate race was camped outside Eternal Kingdom, and he openly showed himself before their army.

A short while later, Huang Ying appeared before him.

Huang Ying sized up Yang Ye and smiled, “Long time no see!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Are you going to start?”

Huang Ying smiled, “Haven’t you already seen it?”

Yang Ye nodded. Indeed, the Eternal Kingdom and all the other powers had suffered some losses in Eternal Kingdom. So, it was the desolate race’s best opportunity.

The more chaotic the universe got, the more beneficial it would be for the desolate race!

Yang Ye looked behind Huang Ying. It was a void, and the desolate race’s army was within the space there.

As for what kind of experts were there, Yang Ye didn’t know.

However, as far as he was concerned, just the Desolate Emperor alone was sufficient to give the Eternal Kingdom a huge headache.

Yang Ye didn’t say anything else and just left.

Huang Ying didn’t say anything and just watched Yang Ye leave.

A long time later, he turned around and entered that void.

Yang Ye returned to Eternal Kingdom.

The Ancient Sword Sect.

Yang Ye entered the Primordial Pagoda because Sword Scroll’s main body had been repaired.

On the Ascension Platform, Sword Scroll was merging with her main body. Her main body was a vessel, and she was its spirit. So, she would recover to her original level once they merged into one.

A Super Divine Treasure!

Even though he had Executor already, Executor wasn’t complete. Moreover, in a situation like this, he would always welcome an extra Super Divine Treasure.

Snowy didn’t leave and was helping her merge with her main body!

Sword Scroll had a much, much better chance at success with Snowy there to help her.

Yang Ye went over to Erya. Erya was still absorbing the inner core fragment, and her aura was at a level that even made his heart palpitate slightly.

He knew that when she woke up, she may not be the same Erya he knew.

Suddenly, Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda.

At one of the Ancient Sword Sect’s former practice grounds, Yang Ye appeared out of thin air in the sky, and Elder Xue was in front of him.

Elder Xue bowed slightly to Yang Ye, “The Sprite Palace is here again.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Tell them to leave.”

Elder Xue said, “She said she isn’t here to ask for the Sprite Progenitor.”

As soon as Elder Xue finished speaking, a figure suddenly appeared nearby.

It didn’t take long for a woman in blazing flames to appear before them.

A Destiny Realm expert!

Moreover, she was no ordinary Destiny Realm expert.

The woman glanced at Yang Ye and spoke indifferently, “It’s really difficult to meet you, Sect Master Ye.”

Yang Ye said, “I don’t want to waste my time.”

She grunted coldly, “Yang Ye, do you know that the Sprite Progenitor is in extreme danger. According to my knowledge, that place has decided to act against her.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I know.”

She spoke coldly, “You do? Then why do you still keep her with you?”

Yang Ye smiled, “And let her go to the Sprite Palace? Can you keep her safe?”

The woman fell silent.

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “Tell me why you’re really here. Don’t waste your breath trying to argue with me. It’s meaningless.”

The woman spoke solemnly, “Yang Ye, we must join forces now. It’s the only way we’ll have a chance at keeping her safe.”

Yang Ye walked over to her and smiled, “You know who we have to face, yet you’ve still come here. Tell me, what do you want her to do? Don’t tell me you’re kindhearted and a loyal follower of the Sprite Progenitor. There is good and bad among all living beings, and sprites are no exception.”

If the Sprite Palace was truly loyal to the Sprite Progenitor, they would have come when Snowy summoned the help of the universe. However, they hadn’t!

The Sprite Palace was an organization!

If he gave Snowy to them, Snowy was very likely to fall under their control and become a puppet.

It was why he didn’t like Sprite Palace!

They didn’t even show themselves before Snowy truly became the Sprite Progenitor, but as soon as she did, they came for her. So, how could their intentions be pure?

The woman gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and smiled, “If she comes with us, she’ll gain the previous Sprite Progenitor’s inheritance. At that time, she’ll regain her full strength. As for my Sprite Palace, we have the defensive formations the previous Sprite Progenitor left behind. If you join us too, it shouldn’t be that difficult to keep her safe. Of course, it all depends on you.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I refuse. You can leave now.”

The woman took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, and then she transformed into a ray of fire that vanished into the sky.

Elder Xue spoke solemnly from Yang Ye’s side, “They won’t give up!”

Yang Ye glanced at the sky, “I know.”

Elder Xue hesitated for a moment and seemed to intend to say something. However, she didn’t say anything in the end and just left.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing appeared by Yang Ye’s side. She glanced at the flames in the distance and said, “What role do you wish to play in this war?”

The war between the desolate race and Eternal Kingdom was impossible to avoid.

Yang Ye shook his head and gazed at her, “I just want all of you to be safe and well.”

He didn’t want to get mixed up in the conflict between the desolate race and Eternal Kingdom. He just wanted Snowy, An Nanjing, the Ancient Sword Sect’s disciples, and everyone else to be safe and well.

An Nanjing nodded slightly, “We’ll all be fine.”

Boom!

Suddenly, a rumbling explosion resounded from afar.

At this moment, the entire Ancient Sword Sect shook like there was an earthquake, and even the entire Eternal Kingdom was shaking.

An Nanjing spoke softly, “The barrier between Eternal Border and Eternal Kingdom has been destroyed.”

Yang Ye nodded, “It has.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The entire Eternal Kingdom was shocked!

The desolate race was here again!

The Eternal Kingdom had never forgotten the desolate race. All those years ago, it was this race that had almost annihilated the entire Eternal Kingdom.

Countless years later, they were back again!

Were they afraid?

No!

Eternal Kingdom didn’t fear them, all Eternal Kingdom wanted was revenge!

That war had been a humiliation for them, and they plan to cleanse themselves of it!

Ancient Sword Sect. At the mountain peak.

Yang Ye left with An Nanjing.

It was time for him to watch from the sidelines as they fought.

Of course, he would stab them in the back if necessary!

He would never forget how the Soul Sect and the other powers of Eternal Kingdom had treated him.

The War Dimension.

A woman soundlessly appeared on the city walls. It was Liu Yuan.

Liu Yuan gazed at the sky with indifference on her face.

A long time later, Liu Yuan suddenly said, “War Dimension! Hear me! Come with me to battle! We shall fight the desolate race to the death!”

“To the death!” Countless voices resounded throughout the War Dimension.

A short while later, rays of light shot up from deep within the city and rushed after her.

It wasn’t just in War City, countless experts answered the call of the Eternal Lord and rushed toward the Central Region!

Of course, the Ancient Sword Sect was an exception.

Eternal Border.

Above the Eternal River, the Desolate Emperor smiled as he gazed at Eternal Kingdom. A short while later, his smile widened to a brilliant smile, “This time, you don’t have a Sprite Progenitor to help you.”

He looked into the distance and said, “You start first!”

As soon as he gave the order, a huge axe tore through the sky!
