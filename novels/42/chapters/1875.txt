Chapter 1876 – Bring It On!

Cute!

Yang Ye glanced at Hou Qing. Hou Qing and Qiong Qi were acting quite strangely today!

Meanwhile, Snowy suddenly flew over to Yang Ye, and then she started waving her claws. She grew more and more excited as time passed…

A short while passed before Yang Ye rubbed her little head, “You want to learn that sword formation?”

Snowy hurriedly nodded.

“No!”

“No!”

Suddenly, Qiong Qi and Hou Qing spoke abruptly.

Yang Ye and Snowy gazed at them. There was a trace of bewilderment in Yang Ye’s eyes. Qiong Qi and Hou Qing were acting too strangely. As for Snowy, she just kept blinking…

The corners of Qiong Qi and Hou Qing’s eyes couldn’t help but twitch at the sight of this. Because she kept threatening them!

Besides Yang Ye and Little Sky, there was no one else in the Primordial Pagoda who dared to offend her. Even the one who’d been here since the beginning, the Divine Yin Flame, gave her face. It couldn’t be helped because she was someone who could make the Primordial Pagoda help her!

That was something which even Yang Ye couldn’t accomplish!

Snowy watched as Hou Qing and Qiong Qi exchanged glances. In the end, Hou Qing took a deep breath, gazed at Snowy, and smiled, “It’s very dangerous, extremely dangerous. Yes, the slightest mistake will cause a huge amount of pain. Aren’t you afraid of pain?”

Pain?

Snowy blinked and gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was about to speak when Hou Qing’s voice suddenly resounded in his mind, “Kid, mind your actions in front of her from now on. That little fellow is acting just like you now, and she keeps drawing her sword for everything. If this continued, you’re going to lead her down the wrong bad!”

Suddenly, Qiong Qi said, “He already has!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Yang Ye looked down at Snowy who was in his arms now, and he smiled a while later. He intended to teach Snowy to differentiate between right and wrong, but he refused to change her character. He wanted her to live a carefree life because it would make her very happy.

He hadn’t forgotten what had happened to her all those years ago. She’d been imprisoned for years. At that time, she was afraid of everything, and she didn’t even dare to go out in the open. Yet now, she’d overcome all of it.

So, as far as he was concerned, it was fine so long as she was happy.

Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda after playing with Snowy for a while. Even though he’d cultivated for months within the pagoda, only a little over a dozen days had passed in the outside world.

Yang Ye stood by the precipice of a mountain. He took a deep breath as he gazed at the mountain range which coiled through the ground like a sleeping dragon. A moment later, a sword suddenly appeared beneath his feet, and then a ray of light shot into the mountains.

The Sword Control Technique!

It was a technique he’d learned very early on in his path of cultivation. However, he’d abandoned it later on because he felt that its speed couldn’t keep up with him. Yet now, after he modified it, its speed far surpassed even the Grand Teleportation Technique!

Because his Sword Control Technique wasn’t just the Sword Control Technique anymore. He’d used numerous Laws along with it. Besides that, he’d included the energy of his soul. So, its speed was at his limits.

During his closed door cultivation, the greatest gains Yang Ye obtained wasn’t the Invincible Sword Domain he’d created, it was the merging and consolidating everything he’d learned.

It was his greatest gain!

Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye arrived where Yang Lianshuang was.

She sized up Yang Ye and said, “You’ve grown much stronger, huh?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Isn’t it the same for you?”

Yang Lianshuang grinned, “Do you need something?”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, “How are the others doing?”

“Cultivating behind closed doors!” Yang Lianshuang continued, “They possess extraordinary natural talent, so attaining the 6th stage of the True Realm shouldn’t be a problem. Once that happens, we’ll have a place in Heaven Pillar Mountain too.”

Yang Ye asked, “Do you have any plans?” He knew that she was building an organization, so she definitely had some plans.

Yang Lianshuang shook her head slightly, “Not much. My only thought is that we’ll have companions when we go to the large universe!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright, we’ll go up there together!”

After chatting with her for a while, Yang Ye left the mountain range and went to Heaven Pillar Mountain.

At the foot of the mountain, Yang Ye looked up into the distance, but only mountains remained even at the ends of his vision.

Suddenly, a few auras flashed past him.

“It’s Yang Ye!” Someone suddenly exclaimed from somewhere in space.

Yang Ye hadn’t concealed himself when he came, and practically everyone here knew him. So, it was very easy for them to recognize him.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. Suddenly, he frowned slightly while he clenched his right hand slightly. However, it only took a moment for him to relax. He didn’t say a word and just entered the interior of Heaven Pillar Mountain.

Meanwhile, someone suddenly asked, “Why isn’t anyone attacking?”

“Only an idiot would…”

In the beginning, countless had ceaselessly chased after Yang Ye because they felt that they could kill him. But now, Yang Ye had used countless slaughters to prove that they couldn’t kill him.

Even though he wasn’t a Heavenly Exalt, he possessed the strength of one!

So, under such circumstances, no one dared to come looking for trouble.

Presently, Yang Ye was one of those existences in Heaven Pillar Mountain that most didn’t dare to offend.

After he entered the interior of the mountain, Yang Ye went to the 11th level. Just like the 10th level, it was an independent world. As for who created it, he didn’t know the answer to that question.

Sky Devils!

He was here to look for Sky Devils. Even though he knew the Elegant Exalt had ill intent towards him, he didn’t care. Based on his current strength, he was 90% confident that he could kill the Elegant Exalt, and it rose to 99% if he launched a surprise attack!

Why wasn’t it 100%? Because he was afraid he would be overconfident and proud!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and was about to leave. Suddenly, he looked towards the distance. A ray of green light was flickering there.

A familiar aura!

Suddenly, the green light stopped, and then it shot swiftly towards him. In less than half a breath of time, the green light was in front of him.

A moment later, it dispersed to reveal a middle aged man.

Yang Ye recognized the middle aged man. It was Hao Tian!

A trace of surprise flashed through his eyes. He hadn’t expected to see Hao Tian here.

“It’s you!” Hao Tian sized up Yang Ye and said, “Not bad. You’re at the 6th stage of the True Realm now!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “I didn’t expect to meet you here, Senior.”

Hao Tian smiled, “I can’t go up there for now, so I have no choice but to cultivate here.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, even your strength is insufficient to head up there?” Even though he didn’t know how strong Hao Tian was, he had no doubt that Hao Tian definitely surpassed the Heavenly Exalts. Moreover, Hao Tian still felt extremely dangerous to Yang Ye.

Hao Tian shook his head, “You think it’s that simple?” He glanced at Yang Ye and continued, “Sometimes, the truly terrifying thing isn’t the barrier, or the chaotic flow of space. It’s man itself.”

Man! Yang Ye glanced at Hao Tian. He’d thought that the experts here hadn’t gone up there because of the barrier and chaotic flow of space, but now it would seem like it wasn’t that simple!

“Leave!” Suddenly, Hao Tian said, “It isn’t time for you to come here!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Hao Tian explained, “The Sky Devils here are called Heart Devils too. The slightest mistake will bring eternal damnation to you. Even though your heart towards the sword is firm, it isn’t flawless. Just the slightest flaw may lead to your death!”

Yang Ye asked, “They’re that terrifying?”

Hao Tian glanced at Yang Ye and said, “You’re the weakest amongst the people I’ve met here!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, Hao Tian suddenly looked up at the sky, and there was a trace of bewilderment in them, “Interesting!”

He glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Farewell!”

After that, he vanished into the sky.

Once Hao Tian left, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and vanished on the spot.

He didn’t leave. He knew that he had his flaws, but since there were flaws, he naturally had to mend them. This place could help him attain the Quasi Enlightened Realm. No, if he obtained some sort of fortuitous encounter, he may even attain the Enlightened Realm!

Because he had Primordial Violet Energy!

Improving his strength was the important matter at hand for Yang Ye!

Not long after Yang Ye left, a woman and an armored man appeared here.

The woman was the Elegant Exalt, and the armored man was the expert that the Sovereign of Man had sent.

The Elegant Exalt gazed in the direction that Yang Ye had left towards and spoke indifferently, “I knew he would come!”

The armored man spoke solemnly, “He’s at the 6th stage of the True Realm!”

The Elegant Exalt glanced at the armored man, “If we don’t act now, he may attain the Enlightened Realm soon!”

The Enlightened Realm!

A trace of gloominess flashed through the armored man’s eyes, “You’re right, we must act as soon as possible. Once he encounters a Sky Devil, his mind will definitely be affected. That’s our best chance. We’ll attack together!”

The Elegant Exalt nodded. She was about to speak when her expression suddenly changed. Because a man in green clothes had suddenly appeared not too far away from them, and it was Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at them, and then he stretched out his right hand and gestured at them, “Come! Join forces against me!”
