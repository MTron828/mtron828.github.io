Chapter 2231 – Death is Nothing!

One attack!

The Wargod’s might was that powerful!

Yang Ye wiped off the blood from the corner of his mouth and was about to heal himself with Primordial Violet Energy. However, the voice resounded in his mind again, “Primordial Violet Energy is an external force as well. It belongs to the Primordial Pagoda and not you.”

Yang Ye was shocked!

He couldn’t use Primordial Violet Energy!

What did that represent?

It represented that he didn’t possess an undying body anymore, so would he still dare to fight fearlessly as he’d done in the past?

Would he dare to do that?

In the past, he’d dared to risk his life in battle mostly because of the Primordial Violet Energy. Because his body would recover rapidly with it. Yet now, he couldn’t use it.

Would he still dare to fight like that with just his own strength?

At this moment, Yang Ye really realized the severity of his issues.

If he didn’t dare to, then it was undoubtedly no different than denying his own ability; but if he dared to do so, would he be able to survive like he had in the past?

Yang Ye wasn’t the only one, even An Nanjing had a solemn expression on her face.

In the end, it was a test of utmost importance to Yang Ye. If he could pass it, his Sword Heart would become unprecedentedly fortified, and it would even rise a level higher while his Sword Core would condense. But if he failed the test, his Sword Heart would instantly collapse, and that represented the collapse of his Sword Dao and a tremendous decline in strength. Moreover, he may never be able to advance again!

An Nanjing gazed at Ding Shaoyao, and the latter spoke softly, “I’m not trying to harm him. Both you and him need to grow stronger, right?”

An Nanjing fell silent.

Ding Shaoyao continued, “If he succeeds, his foundation would be truly fortified, and he will attain the peak of the Sage Realm in all aspects and be just half a step away from the Progenitor Realm. That’s a good thing for him, isn’t it?”

An Nanjing spoke softly, “What if he fails…?”

Ding Shaoyao smiled, “Do you have no confidence in him?”

An Nanjing shook her head.

Ding Shaoyao looked over, “A person’s strength isn’t determined by treasures or supported by treasures. For example, someone who becomes rich overnight. That person’s confidence will definitely gain an unprecedented rise. After all, money represents confidence. However, if that person suddenly loses everything overnight as well, that person’s confidence will vanish too. But if a person relied on himself to go step by step to the top, then even if that person loses everything, that person would still have his confidence. Because he has the ability, so even if he falls, he can start all over again.”

She paused for a moment at this point and continued, “I’m sure you know of the Unfettered One and Yang Ye’s father. Where does their strength come from? It comes from themselves. As for treasures? It’s not that they don’t use them, but treasures are just tools to them. They are still strong like gods even without those treasures. A truly strong person is inwardly strong. Regardless of whether it’s you or Yang Ye, while you may be extremely strong, you can be stronger, right?”

An Nanjing remained silent.

Ding Shaoyao spoke softly, “In the past, he went to the Sword Sect for his mother and sister. At that time, he fell into hell because of the Primordial Pagoda, but he didn’t give up. No matter how long it took, he never gave up. Even now, I believe that he won’t give up. Yang Ye is still strong even without his treasures!”

An Nanjing glanced at Ding Shaoyao, “You know him very well!”

Ding Shaoyao said, “Actually, I really admire you.”

An Nanjing gazed at her with a questioning look in her eyes.

But Ding Shaoyao didn’t say anything.

Meanwhile, after the Wargod blasted Yang Ye away, he didn’t attack again and just walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction.

Every step he took caused an invisible aura to slam down upon Yang Ye.

Pressure!

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and looked up at the Wargod. His eyes were blood red.

A moment later, a sword appeared in his grasp. It wasn’t the Sword Supreme but the Sword Precursor!

The Sword Supreme was a treasure, an external source of strength, to Yang Ye. But the Sword Precursor wasn’t. The Sword Precursor was strong because of him, so the Sword Precursor couldn’t be considered as a treasure.

Slaughter intent!

Boundless slaughter intent swept out from Yang Ye, and the sword in his grasp trembled.

At the same time, Elysium left the Wargod’s grasp.

It wasn’t fast, or it should be described as alternating between fast and slow!

If it was extremely fast, Yang Ye wouldn’t really fear it, but when it alternated between fast and slow, it made a solemn expression appear on Yang Ye’s face. Yang Ye pressed his sword against his forehead, and then a ray of light flashed. It didn’t strike Elysium, and it moved in a strange arc around Elysium and stabbed at the Wargod. However, the Wargod didn’t dodge and just slammed his fist forward!

Bang!

Yang Ye’s sword energy exploded apart. At the same time, a ray of blood red light shot down at the Wargod.

As soon as it descended, even space had a huge gap torn open in it!

The Wargod suddenly looked up, and then Yang Ye’s sword couldn’t move an inch further because a pair of bracers had clamped down onto it! An instant later, the Wargod’s knee slammed toward Yang Ye’s stomach.

If it struck him, Yang Ye would be crippled even if he survived it!

Yang Ye’s reaction was extremely swift. Yang Ye had released his sword from his right grasp at the instant the Wargod had lifted his knee, and Yang Ye clenched his right fist before slamming it down!

Bang!

As soon as they collided, space shook violently, and the entire illusory world turned ethereal. Meanwhile, Yang Ye was blasted away, and at that same instant, the Wargod grabbed Yang Ye’s sword and hurled it at him.

Hiss!

A ray of blood red light flashed and shot toward Yang Ye. Everywhere it passed, space was completely sliced into bits, and the powerful energy it contained shook the world here!

Pure energy!

It was the Wargod’s pure strength. While he didn’t know the Sword Dao, his pure strength still made it extremely strong, even if he didn’t possess sword intent!

Not to mention a sword, even a blade of grass could be extremely powerful in the hands of an expert like this!

A blood red glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes as he slowly stretched his right hand forward. At the same time, the Sword Domain appeared, and the sword instantly started slowing down. In the end, it landed firmly in his grasp!

The Sword Domain!

It was one of his trump cards!

As he held the Sword Precursor in his grasp, a wave of terrifying slaughter intent suddenly swept out from him, and it quickly filled the entire Sword Domain, causing the Sword Domain to turn blood red.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Rays of blood red sword energy enveloped down toward the Wargod like a storm!

Meanwhile, the Wargod closed his eyes slightly, and a shield appeared before him. He didn’t use it to defend himself, and he just raised it and charged at Yang Ye’s sword energy.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly from the sight of this. The Wargod’s strength had surpassed his expectations slightly!

Yang Ye didn’t allow his thoughts to wander. He stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of blood red light that shot up into the air, and then he dived down.

Bang!

A moment later, a sword stabbed against the shield, and a rumbling explosion resounded. Countless rays of sword energy exploded apart. At the same time, Yang Ye and the Wargod immediately split apart and were pushed backward repeatedly!

But just a moment later, they shot at each other once more!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Explosions resounded incessantly.

How powerful was Yang Ye’s true strength?

It was obvious now.

While he was only a Sage, his slaughter intent was at the Progenitor Realm, and it was even at the peak of the Progenitor Realm. As for his combat instinct, it was extraordinary too. So, even if he wasn’t using any treasures, he could fight a progenitor. However, just as he’d said, he only had a 30% or 40% chance to kill a progenitor while not using any treasures.

He only possessed slaughter intent at the Progenitor Realm, but those progenitors were at the Progenitor Realm!

Suppression!

Yang Ye was gradually suppressed in the battle.

At this moment, he had no Primordial Violet Energy to heal himself, so his body was gradually covered in holes and blood.

But Yang Ye noticed to his astonishment that his blood was immediately reabsorbed upon flowing out! And once he reabsorbed that blood, he noticed that his slaughter intent grew even stronger!

Even stronger!

However, there was a problem. If he couldn’t defeat the Wargod before his blood dried up, he would be exhausted to death!

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and Yang Ye was blasted away while blood sprayed from him in midair. However, it didn’t take long for him to reabsorb it all, or it should be said that his slaughter intent reabsorbed it all!

Yang Ye greedily took a deep breath and gazed at the Wargod.

Now, he only had a single choice! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Fight!

Fight to the death!

He had no other way out!

No Sword Supreme, no Primordial Armor, no Primordial Violet Energy, and No Samadhi Flame. But he still dared to fight, until death!

Just like how many in the world were. While they had no money, no power, and no backing, they had courage, and they dared to fight back against anyone who tried to bully them!

One could have no money, power, and backing in life, but one had to have courage!

Death was nothing to fear!
