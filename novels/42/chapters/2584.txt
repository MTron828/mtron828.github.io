Chapter 2585

It was a very ordinary swing of the sword, an extremely ordinary one. It didn’t emanate any light, sword intent, or sword energy!

It was like an ordinary stab from someone who’d just picked up the sword for the first time!

However, it was such an ordinary stab that made Qian Ye’s expression change drastically.

The sword arrived before him!

Qian Ye’s saber descended, but as soon as they came into contact, the saber’s glow instantly vanished without a trace!

Bang!

The saber shook violently and cracked apart!

Qian Ye was blasted over 300m away!

Qian Ye gazed at Yang Ye with disbelief from afar, “Impossible…”

Yang Ye was looking at his intent sword with disbelief as well.

When did my intent sword become so strong?

Moreover, he hadn’t even used his full strength just now!

“Again!” Suddenly, Qian Ye howled with fury, and then he transformed into a ray of light that shot at Yang Ye.

The Boundless Water on both sides of the bridge started to ripple from the might of this attack!

But Yang Ye was very calm!

Strangely calm!

Because he thought of Madam Yin, and compared to her cold winds, this saber energy before him was nothing!

It was a change in his mental state!

In the past, he’d known many experts like Tian Xiu, the Unfettered One, Qi Bitian… But he hadn’t gained such a deep understanding until now.

Because Madam Yin had tried to kill him with her cold winds, but while Tian Xiu and the others were strong, they hadn’t tried to kill him. So, he only knew they were strong but had never experienced it for himself.

It was like how people knew many things, but it was so difficult to truly do it.

Of course, the changes in him weren’t just limited to mental changes!

Yang Ye swung his sword again when the saber energy arrived!

This time, Yang Ye’s sword moved very naturally and casually.

He didn’t accumulate strength, use Heavenrend, and activate the Sword Domain.

Once his sword descended, the saber energy shattered and was obliterated!

A moment later, Yang Ye took a step forward. He arrived before Qian Ye, and then he attacked once more.

A stab!

A simple and direct attack!

A vicious glow flashed through Qian Ye’s eyes, and he swung his saber with both hands.

If he was in the outside world, this attack would definitely be able to cut through space with ease. While the saber couldn’t cut through the space here, the powerful might it carries caused waves to arise in the Boundless Water on both sides of the bridge.

Yang Ye had experienced how heavy the water was, so he knew that it was definitely quite a strong attack to make them wave like that!

A direct frontal clash!

Clang!

A clear and loud clang resounded, and then they were pushed backward. But Yang Ye stopped after just being pushed a little over 1m back.

As for Qian Ye, he was pushed around 100m back!

Moreover, his broken saber shattered at this point. Only its hilt remained!

Qian Ye seemed driven to dejection as he gazed at his saber’s hilt, “Impossible…”

Previously, while he’d lost to Yang Ye by a little bit, it had taken a long and intense battle to decide. Moreover, he’d almost won too!

Yet now, he felt like he couldn’t even fight back against Yang Ye!

In just a short while, Yang Ye had undergone such changes, and he truly found it difficult to accept!

Yang Ye fell silent. He seemed to have thought of something, but he wasn’t very sure. He gazed at the old man, and the old man sighed softly, “Kid, you’ve gained fortune from misfortune!”

Yang Ye bowed slightly, “Senior, please enlighten me.”

The old man gestured for Yang Ye to sit by the bridge, and he called his disciple over as well.

The old man said, “Kid, your sword intent and heart have undergone a change, and it’s a material change.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye asked, “What changed?”

The old man smiled, “Purity!”

“Purity?” Yang Ye frowned slightly. He’d heard Qi Bitian speak about it.

The old man smiled, “Your sword intent is still Lord Realm sword intent, but it’s much purer than before. Simply speaking, it’s like forging a sword. Every strike of the hammer removes a little of the impurities within the metal. Now, your sword intent is without any impurities, so it has undergone a transformation. Of course, it’s because of you and your heart.”

He gazed at Yang Ye with a rather complicated expression on his face, “Your heart is unyielding, truly unyielding, and it allowed your sword intent and Sword Dao to be purified. While you’re only at the Lord Realm, your attainments in the Sword Dao far surpass your current realm of cultivation. Moreover, you should have noticed that your attacks are different now, right?”

Yang Ye nodded. Attacking was very casual and natural to him, it just happened as he willed it.

His sword moved with his heart, and everything was so natural!

The old man continued, “Before this, you had many other thoughts in your mind when swinging your sword. It is why your sword wasn’t pure. To put it in simpler terms, the greatest taboo when doing something is a lack of focus. Now, your sword is natural, direct, and without any hesitation. Your sword moves with your heart, and such a sword is terrifying.”

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time and said, “Is it because of that woman from before?”

The old man smiled, “If you chose to make a compromise when facing her, your sword intent and heart may have not undergone such a transformation. Your sword cultivators cultivate the heart. You chose to follow your heart at a time like that, you refused to compromise and accept humiliation. So, your sword, sword intent, and heart would do the same. It is why they underwent this transformation. It sounds like a really vague concept when explained like that, but to make it clearer, it’s a form of self-awareness which allowed you to grow.”

Yang Ye grinned, “Senior, your explanation is really…”

The old man said, “No matter what, you’ve benefited from the misfortune you suffered, right?”

He shook his head slightly, “Kid, you don’t realize how long it took me to attain a similar level all those years ago. Now that I’ve seen you attain such comprehensions at your age and possess such advanced attainments in the Sword Dao, I feel quite embarrassed!”

Comprehensions? Yang Ye smiled and remained silent.

Actually, it was worth being happy about. However, he didn’t feel really happy about such comprehensions. For some reason, after that near-death experience, many things weren’t that significant to him anymore!

For example, his sword intent and heart. He wasn’t especially happy about it, and it was just something normal to him!

His heart was calm as water!

It was the same reason why he’d attacked so calmly and naturally when fighting Qian Ye!

Meanwhile, the old man suddenly said, “It’s about time for us to leave!”

Yang Ye gazed at the old man, and the latter smiled, “I planned to let him gain some experience and tempering here. But now that I’ve met you, I think such methods won’t be of much help. Moreover, there are some issues in his mental state right now, so I have to take him home and deal with that.”

Meanwhile, Qian Ye suddenly said, “I’m fine!”

The old man glanced at him, ignored him, and gazed at Yang Ye, “Young Brother, let’s meet again if fate allows it. Farewell!”

He stood up and walked off with Qian Ye.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and wanted to ask if the old man could take him along, but Yang Ye abandoned that thought in the end. He had to rely on himself to leave this place. It was part of the agreement he’d made with Qi Bitian. If he made the old man help him, and that annoyed Qi Bitian, then not only will he suffer, the old man may get dragged in too!

When he left, Qian Ye turned around and shot a glance at Yang Ye, and then he gestured at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye smiled, “We’ll spar again if we have the chance!”

Qian Ye nodded slightly and vanished into the distance with the old man.

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while, and then he shook his head and smiled. Yang Ye raised his right hand, and an intent sword appeared in his grasp.

A moment later, numerous intent swords appeared around him!

Moreover, many other energy swords appeared in the surroundings!

Swords made from energy!

He'd been capable of that since a very, very long time ago. But this time, his energy swords were completely different!

Both his intent swords and energy swords couldn’t be compared to the past!

They were pure and solid!

They seemed simply eternal!

Actually, both Yang Ye and the old man from before didn’t know much about this change in purity.

Only Qi Bitian knew more about it!

It was a realm, a realm of the heart, and it wasn’t very closely linked to a person’s cultivation! Yang Ye had gained a clear understanding of his heart, that was called seeking the heart, then he did as his heart wanted, and that was called following the heart. Besides that, he didn’t give up on it, even in the face of death, and that was called staying true to the heart.

It could be said that Yang Ye had gotten lost in the past, but he hadn’t even realized it. He’d relied on treasures and experts, and he had no fear of death. It was a lack of fear that didn’t come from his own strength or his own lack of fear toward death, it was because he felt there would be people to help him!

It was why Qi Bitian was disappointed in him and almost gave up on him, but she’d decided to give him a chance.

She’d met many geniuses throughout the years, and even she was an unprecedented genius. So, if it wasn’t for Erya, she wouldn’t even spare a glance at Yang Ye.

Not to mention Yang Ye, only a handful throughout the universe could be taken seriously by her.

However, she’d still decided to give Yang Ye a chance! As for whether it was for Erya or some other reason, only she knew the answer.

Fortunately, Yang Ye hadn’t disappointed her.

Of course, she wasn’t very pleased either. It was just the beginning now!

On the bridge.

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the energy swords and intent swords vanished. He looked up into the distance and grinned. He knew that he had to get through all of this on his own.

A short while later, Yang Ye vanished into the distance.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Lei Lin gazed at the golden box before her and asked curiously, “Big Sis, what’s this?”

Qi Bitian patted the box and said, “I think it’s an egg!”

“What egg?” Lei Lin blinked.

Qi Bitian scanned it and spoke seriously, “A bad egg!”
