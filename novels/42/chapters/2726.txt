Chapter 2727 – What Can’t We Accomplish When We’re Together?

Emperor Li immediately attacked!

Zuo Mu wanted to stop him, but it was too late!

Yang Ye held the merged Five Element Sword in his left hand and Destiny’s sword in his right hand. He gazed coldly at Emperor Li’s approaching figure.

Emperor Li’s aura was rising rapidly as he charged at Yang Ye, and his body was like a moving volcano that was erupting.

His aura simply seemed like it could obliterate the world!

It didn’t take long for Emperor Li to arrive before Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye leaped up and swung both his swords!

Hiss! Hiss!

Space was instantly sliced open!

Space was weak like paper before his swords! It simply couldn’t resist them at all!

Meanwhile, Emperor Li had noticed the terrifying energy contained within Yang Ye’s swords.

But he had already committed to the attack and couldn’t stop now!

He would die if he tried to stop right now!

Emperor Li chose to risk his life! Ye clenched his fists, and countless arcs of lightning actually appeared on his fists!

It wasn’t just his fists, his entire body was covered by countless arcs of lightning.

Emperor Li was like a ball of lightning right now!

A short while later, they slammed against each other in the most violent manner.

In an instant, the world shook around them!

Boom!

Two figures were instantly blasted away, and they flew over 30km before finally stopping themselves!

Swish!

Countless bolts of lightning and sword energy shot violently through the surroundings!

As soon as he stopped himself, countless fragments fell from Yang Ye!

It was the armor!

At the critical moment, Yang Ye had used the armor once more, and it had forcibly stopped most of Emperor Li’s attack. However, it had been too strong, so the armor had failed to endure it all and collapsed!

However, Yang Ye merely suffered a portion of the impact as a result of that!

The fragments hadn’t even touched the ground when a gust of spirit energy surged by, and then they entered the Primordial Pagoda.

On the Ascension Platform, Snowy waved her paw, and those fragments descended before her.

She glanced at them, and then struck them with the Sprite Staff. Meanwhile, more and more spirit energy converged from all over!

Snowy seemed to have thought of something at this point and vanished on the spot.

A moment later, she was where Erya was.

Erya was still absorbing the fragment of her inner core, but her aura wasn’t that violent anymore. It was very calm and still!

Snowy glanced at Erya, sneaked over behind her, and then gazed at her tail!

Her tail was covered in countless dark gold scales.

Snowy touched them gently, and then she gently pulled on one of them…

Suddenly, Erya opened her eyes, glanced at Snowy, and felt slightly speechless, “Snowy, what are you doing?”

Snowy looked up at her, cracked a smile, and then waved her paws swiftly.

She was saying that Yang Ye’s armor was too fragile, and Yang Ye was in great danger if it remained so weak…

Erya clearly understood Snowy. She fell silent for a long time, and then she glanced at her tail. She waved her hand lightly, and then five small dark gold scales flew over to Snowy.

Snowy took the scales and left.

Erya looked up at the sky while worry appeared in her eyes, but her gaze gradually turned icy cold again. A short while later, she seemed slightly lost.

After absorbing two fragments of her original inner core, fragments of memories from her past had appeared in her mind!

A short while later, Erya moved her gaze away, “Big Brother Yang, Snowy… loved ones, loved ones, loved ones…”

She muttered softly and closed her eyes slowly.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye looked up at Emperor Li. At this moment, Emperor Li was covered in countless injuries! All of them had been caused by his sword energy!

As for Yang Ye, while he’d been injured, because of the armor, these injuries could be overlooked at his speed of recovery!

Simply speaking, Emperor Li had suffered a loss in this collision!

At this moment, Emperor Li had an extremely unsightly expression on his face. He hadn’t expected Yang Ye to become so terrifying with those two swords, and he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to be wearing armor!

Who ever said that treasures were useless?

When two people were almost equally matched, treasures were extremely useful!

Meanwhile, Zuo Mu suddenly said, “Retreat!”

He turned around and left once he said that.

If it was just Yang Ye here, he would absolutely not leave. But Yang Ye wasn’t alone. He had An Nanjing and Yin Yang Goddess. While it was four against three, they actually didn’t have a very good chance!

Yang Ye had too many extraordinary divine treasures!

It was an impossible fight!

First God glanced at Yang Ye and An Nanjing, and then he left. Sky Saber turned around and followed First God. As for Emperor Li, he seemed hesitant.

It was the first time he’d suffered such a loss since he made a name for himself!

Actually, he wanted to go all out and put his life on the line.

However, when he saw Zuo Mu and the others leave, he knew that he couldn’t do that. If he didn’t have Zuo Mu and the others to keep An Nanjing and Yin Yang Goddess busy, he would be giving his life away if he still insisted on fighting!

Emperor Li stared at Yang Ye, “Remember that you don’t have that armor anymore. You’re dead next time we meet!”

He turned around and left once he finished that threat.

Yang Ye didn’t give chase. He similarly couldn’t do anything to their group.

It was pointless to give chase!

Conversely, if Heng Wangu and the other Destiny Realm experts of the End World were to appear, he would be in huge trouble!

Once they left, Yang Ye gazed at Yin Yang Goddess, “Thank you, Senior!”

She replied indifferently, “I just wanted revenge! I wasn’t helping you!”

Yang Ye smiled, “No matter what, I will remember the help you gave me today.”

Yin Yang Goddess glanced at Yang Ye and said, “I advise you to go look for Qi Bitian, Tian Xiu, or the other forms of Destiny. I don’t know what the End World promised Emperor Li to make him willingly fight for them, but I do know that this whole thing isn’t that simple. Moreover, the End World clearly plans on going against Destiny. To be frank, if they didn’t have some shocking trump card, Emperor Li and Heng Wangu would never dare to do that.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I know.”

She said, “You’re not a good person, and you’re full of tricks. Moreover, you have Qi Bitian and those few forms of Destiny on your side, so you seem to have the advantage!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly.

The advantage?

Advantage my ass!

The world thought that Destiny was on his side, and they were on his side. The woman in white and the woman in black were on his side, but the two strongest forms of destiny were not on his side.

It was slightly better when it came to Tu. Because while she didn’t like him, she didn’t have any intention to kill him, but the strongest form of Destiny wanted to kill him!

When compared to the strongest form of Destiny, the experts of the End World really weren’t that terrifying!

Meanwhile, Yin Yang Goddess said, “I have other business to attend to. Farewell.”

She turned around and walked away.

Yang Ye suddenly said, “Senior, please wait a moment.”

Yin Yang Goddess turned around to gaze at Yang Ye, and he said, “Senior, I’m afraid the End World won’t let you live for helping me just now. If they act against you, please contact me at any time.”

She replied indifferently, “Why would I? Doing that will probably make me die faster! They will definitely send everyone they have when you’re there, but if I’m all alone, they will definitely not pay that much attention to me. So, I’ll be very safe if you stay away from me!”Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

She vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. Needless to say, what she said did make quite a bit of sense.

If she was with him, the End World would definitely pay extra attention to her!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at An Nanjing, “Are you alright?”

She shook her head. She hadn’t been injured in the battle just now.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “I was too careless. I thought the End World would restrain themselves a little after the last incident, but I never expected them to come so quickly. However, it seems like they weren’t here for me. Obviously, they have other objectives. Are they going to look for more help?”

Yang Ye’s face turned extremely gloomy when he thought of that!

Since the very beginning, the End World had been constantly finding more and more old geezers, and all of them actually targeted him for some reason!

Especially Emperor Li. That fellow was a proud and powerful expert, so Yang Ye could only wonder what the End World did to make him willingly work for them!

He couldn’t figure it out, and he knew that after what happened that day, the End World would definitely grow even more careful. If they come for him again, they would be absolutely confident in their ability to crush him!

So, he couldn’t just stay where he was. He had to become even stronger before they came for him!

He had to be a step or at least half a step ahead of the End World!

Staying on the spot would result in death!

Meanwhile, An Nanjing walked over to his side and spoke softly, “Don’t think too much about it. What haven’t we experienced throughout our journey here? And what can’t we accomplish when we’re together?”

Yang Ye roared with laughter that surged through the surroundings.

An Nanjing just stood by his side and gazed at him in silence.

Yang Ye and her were the most monstrous geniuses of this era, but for the sake of Yang Ye, she was willing to hide away from the limelight and stay with him.

If he didn’t have Yang Ye, she would become the second Unfettered One.

An expert who pursued the limits of the Martial Dao.

But once she had Yang Ye, the Martial Dao was secondary to her.

All of this came from that moment on Profounder Continent, when Yang Ye protected her with his life from the arrows at the city gates.

A short while later, Yang Ye and An Nanjing returned to the Primordial Pagoda. As soon as he arrived there, Snowy appeared before him with her paws behind her back. She gazed at Yang Ye with a wide smile on her chubby little face.

Yang Ye smiled, “Let me see it!”

Snowy blinked and raised her paws. A moment later, an armor appeared before Yang Ye.

A brand new armor!
