Chapter 2054 – Taking Up an Old Profession!

Yang Ye sized up the surroundings. It was empty. He saw nothing.

Actually, some small worlds were hidden here, and it was where those books resided.

As for the black scroll in front of him, it was the key to the library.

However, he didn’t have any authority. When others came to read or borrow books, he just had to use the key to open the entrance to the library.

To make it sound nicer, it was the job of a librarian; to be blunt, it was no different from an odd job!

However, Yang Ye didn’t mind all of that.

As far as he was concerned, he just wanted to get some points. Because he wanted to read the books in the library, especially the 4th level.

Reading the books there required 3,000 points! Moreover, only that number of points only gave a person 15 minutes to read there. If one wanted to borrow a book from the 4th level, it required 5,000 points. Moreover, it had to be returned in a day!

But he was only getting five points per month.

Obviously, he had to get points through other means.

Suddenly, Yang Ye looked out of the tower. Two rays of light descended from the sky, and a man and a woman appeared before Yang Ye.

They were probably students of the academy, but Yang Ye was surprised because they were only at the Know Dao Realm, just like him!

A short while later, they arrived in front of Yang Ye. The man sized up Yang Ye and said, “New here?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The man nodded slightly and flicked a silver card to Yang Ye, “We want to enter the 2nd level for 15 minutes.”

Yang Ye quickly glanced at the black scroll before him, and then he lightly swiped the man’s card against the scroll. A moment later, a ray of silver light flickered on the card.

Yang Ye passed it back to the man. The man didn’t say anything and just intended to enter with the woman. However, Yang Ye hurriedly stopped them, “Only one of you can go in!”

The man had only paid for a single person. So, if the woman followed him in, it would be fraud. If it was discovered, both of them may be just punished lightly, but he would definitely suffer severe punishment!

The man frowned when he heard Yang Ye, “I’ve paid the student points!”

Yang Ye replied, “I know, but you only paid for one person.”

The man looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Where’s Qin Lang?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t know. Why? Two people can go in with a single person’s student points if he’s in charge?”

The man wanted to say more, but the woman flicked a silver card to Yang Ye. Yang Ye didn’t say a word. He just swiped it and returned it to her.

She glanced at him and said, “Want to make a bet?”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Huh?”

She walked over to him, ‘You won’t live more than three days from now! Will you accept this bet?”

I won’t live for more than three days? Yang Ye was stunned and asked, “Why?”

She replied, “No reason. I just bet you won’t live for more than three days. Don’t worry, we won’t do it now! So, do you agree?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “Since you’re so confident, then let’s do it. Give me 100 student points if I’m still alive in three days, alright?”

100 points were a huge number of points!

Their expressions changed when they heard Yang Ye, and the woman smiled, “Alright, we’ll wait and see!”

She turned around and entered the 1st level once she finished speaking.

The man glanced at Yang Ye, “You brought this upon yourself!”

He turned around and followed her.

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled. He walked out of the library and soared up slowly into the sky. It didn’t take long for him to arrive high above, and he looked down at the ground below. This mountain had a single building, the Worlds library.

A forest surrounded the library. In the beginning, Yang Ye felt that the forest was just ordinary, but it didn’t take long for him to notice that energy was fluctuating through the forest!

Another formation!

Yang Ye moved his gaze to the library down below. While it seemed to be empty, Yang Ye was sure that if he dared to misuse his position, then he would be discovered immediately.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and returned to the ground. At the same time, the man and woman walked outside.

Yang Ye glanced at them, and then ignored them and returned to his table.

As far as Yang Ye was concerned, he would play with them if he was happy, but if he wasn’t, then he had no time to waste on them.

Being ignored by Yang Ye caused their faces to fall. The man walked over to Yang Ye, “Now, I’ve changed my mind. Add me into the bet between you and Young Miss Meng Yin, alright? You’ll definitely agree because if you survive three days, you’ll get another 100 student points for nothing. How could you possibly refuse that, right?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “How does this benefit you?”

The man smiled, “It doesn’t. I just think it’s fun, alright?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m quite disappointed in Martial Emperor Academy. I thought experts would be hiding everywhere here, and it would be a place I have to be cautious in. But now it seems like it isn’t much different to the world outside. It’s full of weaklings!”

The man’s face instantly became icy cold, “What? You want to die right now?”

He slowly clenched his right hand as he spoke.

Meanwhile, the woman, Meng Yin, spoke abruptly, “Brother Gao You, why make a fuss about things with someone like him? If you kill him, while the academy won’t expel you, you won’t be able to avoid being confined to a room. Moreover, the points you’ve accumulated with great difficulty may be taken completely.”

As she spoke, she glanced at Yang Ye and continued, “Killing you will dirty my hands, and that’s the only reason why you’re still alive!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “A senior of mine told me to keep a low profile here, and I felt that I should do that too. But now it seems like there’s no need for that. The people here flaunt their strength much more than I do!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye slowly clenched his right fist.

Suddenly, an old man appeared not too far away from them. Meng Yin and Gao You’s faces changed slightly upon catching sight of the old man, and then they bowed respectfully to him before leaving.

They were extremely swift and seemed like they were fleeing.

Yang Ye was stunned. He gazed at the old man, Who is this old man?

Meanwhile, the old man sized up Yang Ye and flicked a golden card to Yang Ye, “The 2nd level.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he swiped the card. The old man turned around and entered the tower. It only took a moment for the old man’s figure to vanish.

Meanwhile, a delicate voice resounded from not too far away, “You’re the new librarian?”

Yang Ye turned to look, and he saw a woman in a violet dress was looking at him. She seemed to be around the age of 15 or 16. While she seemed quite young, she was extremely gorgeous to the point that just a glance at her would imprint her looks in a person’s heart.

Yang Ye glanced at her and nodded, “Yes!”

A smile curled up on the corners of her mouth, and her eyes curved into two crescents, “Let’s discuss something, alright?”

Yang Ye smiled, “What is it?”

She walked over to Yang Ye and grinned, “Er, I want to take a look at the 3rd level, but I don’t have points.”

She revealed a bitter and pitiable expression when she spoke up to this point.

Yang Ye wasn’t affected by it at all, “You can go earn them. There are many ways to earn them.”

She replied, “But it’s really slow!”

Yang Ye shrugged, “I can’t help with that. After all, I’m really poor too.”

She blinked, “Why don’t… why don’t you just let me in. Alright?”

“No!” Yang Ye refused decisively.

Even though he was the librarian here, it was just a position that had no authority. He had nothing to do with the books in the library.

She puckered her lips and replied, “Fine.”

Yang Ye thought she would leave, but she actually swaggered off towards the library.

She ignored him!

Yang Ye would naturally not let her enter the tower. Yang Ye suddenly appeared in front of her when she was about to enter, and then he smiled, “Little Sister, you aren’t thinking about entering by force, right?”

Her brilliant smile still remained on her face as she replied, “That’s exactly what I’m planning!”

Yang Ye’s smile remained on his face, “Then why don’t you give it a try!”

She suddenly stretched out her hand and tapped it against Yang Ye’s chest.

In the beginning, Yang Ye was indifferent to it, but his expression changed drastically just a moment later. It was because his chest had cracked open!

Yang Ye hurriedly retreated around 10 steps back. However, her finger was still against his chest.

Yang Ye’s chest started to crack more and more swiftly, and blood was seeping out!

She gazed at him while a smile still remained on her face, but it seemed quite ghastly right now.

Suddenly, Yang Ye slammed a punch forward. A wisp of surprise flashed through her eyes, and she slapped her other palm against Yang Ye’s fist.

Bam!

An explosion resounded, and she was blasted around 300m away.

She glanced at her palm, and then looked up at Yang Ye, “Wow! You’re not ordinary. Come on, let’s continue!”

Suddenly, a sword pressed against her forehead.

She was stunned on the spot.

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “You’ve wasted too much of my time and energy. I think you should compensate me for that. Yes, 100 points will be enough. Huh? You don’t want to?”

Hiss!

The sword entered her forehead slightly, and a drop of blood seeped out and flowed down slowly. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Earlier, Yang Ye had been thinking about how he should earn points. But he hadn’t thought of anything until now.

He’d decided to take up an old profession of his!

Stealing from the rich!
