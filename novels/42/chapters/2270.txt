Chapter 2271 – Mysterious Person!

Kill!

Kill every instant of injustice!

That was Yang Ye’s path!

It could be summed up with a single word—kill!

The old man was extremely swift, so swift that it was beyond description. Yang Ye couldn’t even react at all before the old man arrived in front of him, and then Yang Ye felt like a mountain was pressing down upon him!

Bang!

Yang Ye hadn’t even done anything when his figure was pushed backward repeatedly, and the pressure pressed down upon him without letting up at all.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Horrifying sounds of space being torn open resounded!

It was the space beneath Yang Ye’s feet!

Suddenly, Yang Ye stomped his right foot down, and then a sword howl resounded.

Bang!

A ray of sword energy descended before Yang Ye, and a huge gap was instantly sliced open in the powerful pressure.

However, a palm suddenly slammed against Yang Ye’s chest!

Bang!

In an instant, Yang Ye was far away, and his figure was curved forward while he used his sword to support himself.

There was an extremely striking palm print on his chest.

Yang Ye looked down at his chest.

Crack!

A clear crack resounded, and then countless pieces of armor dropped off all over Yang Ye’s body!

The Primordial Armor!

The Primordial Armor had been completely destroyed!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly. A True Dao Realm expert! This was how terrifying a True Dao Realm expert was! Just a single attack had destroyed his Primordial Armor!

Xiao Lou!

At this moment, he thought of Xiao Lou. Needless to say, he was quite lucky to be able to kill Xiao Lou with three attacks. But at this moment, he didn’t have any slaughter intent or sword intent left, all he had was the Sword Domain. However, if he planned on just relying on the Sword Domain to kill this True Dao Realm expert, it would be difficult, extremely difficult!

“A divine armor!” The old man spoke abruptly, “It’s pretty good armor since it was actually able to resist an attack of mine! I wonder if you have one more!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man transformed into a shadow that vanished on the spot.

Suddenly, a spear appeared before him, and sparks sprayed from its tip.

An Nanjing had joined the battle!

As soon as the spear appeared, an aged hand slammed against its tip. In an instant, the sparks were extinguished, and the spear shook violently before being blasted away!

An Nanjing’s eyes narrowed slightly behind the spear. She swiftly tapped her left foot down and leaped up into the air, and then she kicked with her right foot. Her foot slammed straight against the flying spear.

Bang!

The spear surged forward like an arrow that had just left the bow! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Hiss!

Everywhere it passed, space rippled like water.

In an instant, the spear arrived before the old man. However, a cold smile arose on the corners of his mouth, and he moved slightly to the side and avoided it!

The spear wasn’t fast enough for him, not fast enough at all, or it should be described as being a little slow!

Suddenly, a sword appeared above him.

The old man swiftly looked up. The sword had descended, but it missed.

Bang! Bang!

Two muffled explosions resounded, and then two figures were blasted away.

It was Yang Ye and An Nanjing!

As soon as they dropped to the ground, the ground beneath them collapsed!

At the same time, blood seeped out from the corners of their mouths!

Meanwhile, the old man grinned and revealed a ferocious smile. A moment later, he stretched out his right hand slowly with his palm facing up, and then he clenched it. In an instant, the space in a huge area started warping!

Crack Crack!

It was like space had been put inside a grinder, and a wave of powerful energy was ceaselessly mincing up everything here. As for Yang Ye and An Nanjing, they were at the center of it.

As soon as the energy appeared, both of them felt like their bodies were being pulled apart by a million horses, and the stretching feeling covered their entire bodies!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly while his profound energy surged madly as he held tightly to his sword with both hands. An instant later, his features warped as he suddenly opened his eyes, and then he swung his sword with both hands!

The Sword Domain!

Bang!

The old man was blasted away, and space returned to normal in an instant!

The old man glanced at his hand. His entire right hand had cracked open, and blood was seeping out incessantly and had covered it with blood.

A moment of silence ensued, and then the old man looked up. Meanwhile, Yang Ye and An Nanjing had vanished.

A ferocious glow flashed through his eyes, “You think you can escape? How laughable!”

The space here shook abruptly, and the old man vanished.

…

Extremely far away, a sword shot through the air, and Yang Ye and An Nanjing were on it.

It was extremely swift and impossible to see with the naked eye!

Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s countenances were extremely pale.

They were no match for the old man!

From the previous collision between them, Yang Ye knew that a True Dao Realm expert wasn’t someone An Nanjing and him could resist right now! Unless he ignited his intents again. Moreover, he had to rely on playing tricks. If he hadn’t relied on tricks, it would have been impossible for him to kill Xiao Lou!

True Dao Realm experts were much, much stronger than he’d imagined!

Suddenly, the ray of sword energy stopped.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed while the sword in his grasp trembled. Because an old man was standing before them!

It was the old man from before!

The old man gazed coldly at Yang Ye, “A competition of speed? You are truly ignorant!”

He stomped his right foot down once he finished speaking.

Bang!

A strand of energy suddenly rippled out, and it was like a tsunami that carried monstrous might as it slammed down upon Yang Ye and An Nanjing.

An Nanjing suddenly grabbed Burning Fury and hurled it forward.

Hiss!

The spear was like a flaming dragon that surged forward.

Burning Fury!

Its powerful flames turned the entire sky blood red. At this moment, the entire sky seemed like it was burning!

However, when compared to the energy the old man released, An Nanjing’s attack was much inferior in both power and aura. As soon as they collided, An Nanjing’s attack wasn’t even able to persist for half a breath of time before collapsing!

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded, and then a ray of sword energy descended from the sky!

Bang!

The sword energy instantly sliced open a huge hole in the energy. However, an aged hand suddenly appeared before Yang Ye and An Nanjing!

The hand waved lightly.

Bang!

Yang Ye and An Nanjing were slapped away! However, it didn’t cause any material harm to them!

The old man gazed at Yang Ye and An Nanjing, and a trace of solemness flashed through his eyes!

Shock!

At this moment, the old man was extremely shocked. They were merely peak Sages and not even Progenitors, but they had been able to last for so long against him. Moreover, they were even counter attacking from time to time!

As far as he was concerned, this was absolutely impossible. But it was a fact!

Their natural talent wasn’t any weaker to the best geniuses of the initial race!

The most terrifying part was that Yang Ye possessed those three divine treasures!

They had to die!

That was the thought which had appeared in the old man’s mind! As someone from a large race, he was very well aware of this principle. If one made enemies of a genius like this, that genius must be killed before he or she had the time to grow completely!

As for seeking reconciliation?

He had never considered that. Seeking reconciliation would mean giving up on those three treasures. While Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s natural talent was great, it wasn’t terrifying enough to make the initial race seek reconciliation. However, he did understand why the patriarch had sent him!

Anyone else would have been free practice for these two before him!

The old man restrained his thoughts, and even colder killing intent flickered within his eyes as he gazed at Yang Ye and An Nanjing.

He didn’t say anything and just leaped above them, and then a huge palm covered the entire sky!

A moment later, it descended upon them!

Bang!

In an instant, it seemed like the sky was collapsing. A powerful wave of pressure slammed down, and it caused Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s expressions to instantly change drastically!

They would die if they couldn’t resist this attack!

That was the first thought that appeared in their minds!

They exchanged glances, and then a ray of sword energy and fire surged up into the air.

Bang! Bang!

Two rumbling explosions resounded through the surroundings, and the entire world shook while space was instantly obliterated!

At the same time, two figures crashed down from midair and slammed into the ground.

“Die!” Meanwhile, a furious shout resounded from high above, and then a huge palm emerged from space and smashed into the ground below.

Boom!

A huge abyss was blasted open!

A sword howl resounded from within the abyss, and then a ray of sword energy surged up from within. However, as soon as it emerged from the abyss, it was blasted into bits, and then a ray of terrifying energy descended abruptly!

Bang!

An explosion resounded deep beneath the ground, and a huge expanse of the ground started collapsing rapidly!

It was truly collapsing!

The old man had a cold smile on the corners of his mouth as he stood in midair, “It’s time to end this!”

He was about to attack once he finished speaking, but a ray of white light suddenly flashed, and then it shot underground!

The old man’s face instantly changed drastically, “Don’t you dare!”

He immediately went underground, but a strand of powerful energy surged up from down below.

Bang!

In an instant, the old man was blasted back to where he’d been a moment ago!

But it didn’t take long for him to charge back down there. A few more explosions resounded from deep underground. Obviously, Yang Ye and An Nanjing were fighting the white light from before. The old man was shocked and sped up, but when he arrived underground, Yang Ye and the white light were gone!

Only a woman was lying there!

An Nanjing!

At this moment, there was blood on the corner of An Nanjing’s mouth, and she was heavily injured and unconscious!

The old man’s face was extremely unsightly, “Who was it?!”

A short while later, he gazed at An Nanjing, “Hmph! So long as I have you, I refuse to believe that Yang Ye won’t come to me!”

He waved his right hand, and then he vanished on the spot with An Nanjing!
