Chapter 2556

Even though he said that, he was inwardly overjoyed!

Help him become stronger!

It was like good fortune had dropped down from the sky! It was a change in his luck!

How could he allow such a rare opportunity to slip by?

Before she could even say anything, Yang Ye hurriedly said, “You’re absolutely correct. I’m too weak now, and I’m afraid I won’t get to see tomorrow’s sun if I leave now. I need to grow stronger!”

She sized up Yang Ye and said, “Can you endure suffering?”

Yang Ye spoke seriously, “Yes! I’m very good at it!”

The Abyss Lord nodded slightly and waved her hands, “The bodies of you humans are very intriguing. It’s like a small universe, and your strength is determined by how much of this universe you can unearth.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Can you tell me about that in more detail?”

She kicked her ball as she said, “The level of a person’s achievements is determined by how far that person can develop his or her brains. Simply speaking, cultivating the Dao is actually cultivating the brain, it’s the development of your own brain. Of course, it’s not entirely accurate, but it’s roughly like that.”

She glanced at him and continued, “Your brain hasn’t been developed much, but your body has been developed quite a bit.”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Meanwhile, she added, “Do you want to develop your brain or your body?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Can I do both?”

She suddenly stopped kicking the ball and glanced at him, “It’ll be very painful.”

Yang Ye replied seriously, “I’m not afraid!”

She nodded slightly, “What’s your strongest ability?”

Yang Ye quickly replied, “The Sword Domain!”

“A Domain?” She glanced at him and was quite curious, “Let me have a look?”

Yang Ye hurriedly activated it.

The Sword Domain enveloped the entire abyss!

However, he noticed to his shock that he couldn’t sense the young girl at all! He couldn’t sense her at all!

Yang Ye was about to ask about it when she suddenly said, “What the heck…”

She stomped her right foot down.

Bang!

Something seemed to explode apart!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye felt his mind go blank, and then he crashed to the ground. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Destruction of his Domain!

His Sword Domain had been destroyed by a single stomp from her!

Along with its destruction, Yang Ye fell unconscious!

She glanced at Yang Ye and shook her head slightly, “So weak!”

She continued kicking her ball.

Around two hours later, Yang Ye regained consciousness. However, his head throbbed when he awoke. It was like his head was filled with lead.

It felt like his head was about to explode!

Yang Ye shook his head and was about to stand up, but he noticed to his shock that he actually didn’t have any strength to stand up!

“You’re awake?” Meanwhile, her voice resounded.

Yang Ye looked over and saw her looking at him.

Yang Ye shook his head forcefully again and asked, “Why?”

She asked, “What do you mean?”

Yang Ye replied, “Why did you attack me?”

She walked over to him, “I wanted you to understand that your so-called Domain is so weak.”

Yang Ye frowned, “What do you mean?”

She shook her head, “Do you know what a true Domain is?”

Yang Ye asked without even thinking, “What is it?”

The young girl explained indifferently, “A Domain is something that stands independent of the Three Dimensional Universe and Four Dimensional Universe. There is a difference between such Domains. For example, you have a Sword Domain, and someone else may have a Saber Domain, Spear Domain, or something else. Simply speaking, the Domain transcends Three Dimensional Space and does not exist in Four Dimensional Space either. But your Domain…”

She shook her head.

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “What about my Domain?”

She glanced at him, “It hasn’t even transcended Three Dimensional Space!”

Yang Ye was stunned and asked, “So, my Domain is fake?”

She shook her head, “It isn’t fake, it’s just not high leveled enough. It’s linked to your cultivation and experience. You’re lacking in knowledge and cultivation, so it makes sense that you’re incapable of truly forming a Domain.”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “How do I form a true Domain?”

She shrugged, “How would I know?”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

She sat back on her chair and said, “It depends on you. However, I can strengthen your Domain slightly, or perhaps I should say that I can fortify it slightly!”

Fortify it!

Yang Ye quickly bowed, “Please provide me with your guidance!”

She said, “Your Domain is too fragile. It’s of great help to you in battle, but it’s a lethal weak point as well. If you can fortify it, then this flaw cannot be exploited that easily anymore.”

She glanced at him, “Activate your Domain!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and did as he was told.

Meanwhile, she tapped her right foot down.

Bang!

In an instant, Yang Ye’s domain shattered, and Yang Ye was blasted away. At the same time, he felt like a sledgehammer had slammed against his head, and along with a heavy and intense wave of pain, Yang Ye fell unconscious!

She glanced at his unconscious figure and shook her head slightly, “Weak!”

Around two hours later, Yang Ye woke up again, but the pain still remained.

Especially in his head. He felt like his head was about to explode. It was extremely painful and uncomfortable!

Around an hour later, the pain finally started to fade slowly. Meanwhile, the young girl suddenly said, “Continue!”

Yang Ye was lost for words.

When she saw the bitter expression on his face, she said indifferently, “What? Didn’t you say that you’re not afraid of pain?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “U-Um… Will just destroying it constantly really make it stronger?”

The young girl spoke indifferently, “When a sword becomes a peerlessly powerful sword, how many heavy blows has it endured? How many times was it burned by blazing hot flames? You are a sword now, and my method is to destroy your Domain. As I destroy it, you’ll get used to having it destroyed, and it will naturally become fortified. Besides that, your endurance will grow tremendously too. Haven’t you noticed? You’re regaining consciousness a little faster now!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened because she was trying to make him resistant to attacks!

She suddenly said, “If you’re unwilling, you can leave. But you’re not allowed to step foot into this place again. I…”

“Of course I’m willing!” Yang Ye spoke seriously, “I trust you. Since you’re willing to waste your time on helping me, it’s a huge honor for me. So, how can I not trust you?”

He immediately activated the Sword Domain once he finished speaking.

She glanced at him and tapped her foot down again.

Bang!

In an instant, Yang Ye’s Sword Domain shattered, and he was blasted away again.

Living was worse than death!

It was such a horrible feeling!

It was extremely horrible because every time the Sword Domain shattered, his soul, spirit, and even body would be heavily injured!

It could be described as severe injuries in all aspects!

But he noticed that every single time it was destroyed, he would regain consciousness a little faster than before. For example, now that it had been destroyed almost 100 times, it only took him an hour to regain consciousness. That was an hour faster than when he started!

Besides that, he noticed that it didn’t hurt as much anymore!

Was it really working?

Just like that, Yang Ye had his Domain blasted apart over and over again at the bottom of the abyss…

Time flashed by, and seven days passed in the blink of an eye!

Throughout these seven days, Yang Ye spent most of his time unconscious. He’d forgotten how many times he’d had his domain destroyed. All he did know was that it wasn’t that painful anymore, and it only took less than 10 minutes for him to regain consciousness now.

The time it took him to regain consciousness was growing shorter and shorter!

Just like that, 10 more days passed!

Yang Ye didn’t know how many times he’d fallen unconscious throughout these 10 days, but he’d gradually noticed that it really wasn’t that painful anymore! Moreover, he only lost consciousness for a short while now!

Three days later!

Now, he didn’t lose consciousness when the Sword Domain was destroyed. But while he didn’t lose consciousness, he would still turn extremely pale and be in bad shape!

She glanced at Yang Ye and asked, “How do you feel?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Very uncomfortable.”

She spoke indifferently, “Now, your Domain’s endurance is much, much stronger than before. Now that its endurance is stronger, it will be stronger in other aspects too. You can give it a try!”

Other aspects?

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he activated the Sword Domain!

Once it appeared, he sensed many things in the surroundings. Like two old men in the darkness nearby. The old men had been there all the time, but they had never shown themselves!

Besides that, he sensed some cold and gloomy auras!

But he still couldn’t sense the young girl!

The young girl was right in front of him, and his Domain had enveloped her, but he still couldn’t sense her presence!

As if she knew what Yang Ye was thinking, she suddenly said, “It’s normal for you to be unable to sense me. It’s because you’re in my world!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Your world?”

She raised her right hand slightly. In an instant, the space here shook, and then Yang Ye’s Domain vanished!

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

She glanced at him and said, “This is my Domain!”

Yang Ye’s face stiffened, and he asked, “Y-You have a Domain too?”

She replied with a question, “Do you have a problem with that?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, she waved her hand lightly. The space before Yang Ye instantly warped, and then it gradually turned ethereal. After that, a strange scene appeared there!

A mouthful of blood sprayed from Yang Ye, and then his figure curved and was blasted away.

Meanwhile, an aged voice resounded from behind the young girl, “Master, at his current level of cultivation, he can’t come into contact with that world.”

She shrugged and continued kicking her ball.
