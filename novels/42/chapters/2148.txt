Chapter 2149 – The End Times!

Teleportation!

Every single attack Yang Ye executed was performed by teleporting to his destination and launching a sudden attack. Needless to say, its effects were very good. Especially when he merged his own Burial with Backstab, its might was even more terrifying.

However, he still wasn’t quite skilled at it, and there were some details that had to be altered!

As for An Nanjing, she’d walked out of the room. She glanced at Yang Ye’s room, and then she glanced at the surroundings. In the end, she entered the room that represented the Fist Dao!

The Hall of All possessed the techniques of all paths!

However, it’s impossible to absorb everything at once. At the very least, Yang Ye and her didn’t have the time to slowly absorb everything in this hall. So, it was best to choose what was most suitable to them.

Once she entered through the door, An Nanjing glanced at the surroundings .There were only three phantoms here, three old men!

Their gazes converged onto An Nanjing, and a few breaths of time passed before the old man in the middle frowned, “The Martial Spirit Physique?”

The old man on the left said, “It is!”

The three old men exchanged glances, and they saw a trace of surprise in each other’s eyes.

An Nanjing glanced at them and asked, “Are all of you strong?”

“Are we strong?” The old man at the center couldn’t help but chuckled, “Little girl, you’re actually asking if we’re strong. Do you know who we were in the large universe? We were invincible. We relied on our hands to crush all our enemies!”

An Nanjing glanced at the old man, “I don’t really believe you!”

“You don’t?” The old man chuckled, and then he slammed a punch at her.

It was just a simple punch!

However, it was such a light and simple punch that made An Nanjing frown slightly. While it seemed ordinary, it felt impossible to avoid. She had to face it! That was what she felt from it!

An Nanjing pressed her right foot backward a little, and then slammed a punch forward as well!

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and then An Nanjing was pushed 300m back. As for the old man, he’d been pushed 300m back as well!

The old man glanced at his fist, and then he gazed at An Nanjing, “That strong?”

An Nanjing glanced at the old man, “Do you have anything stronger?”

“Of course!” As soon as he finished speaking, he took a step forward, and then he instantly appeared in front of An Nanjing. After that, he slammed his fist at her. An Nanjing was just about to counterattack, but a wave of powerful energy suddenly surged out from the old man’s fist. This punch felt like a volcano that had been sleeping for many years was erupting at this very moment, and the violet energy it carried was enough to obliterate the world!

An Nanjing didn’t act carelessly, nor did she dare to act carefully. Perhaps these people before her weren’t from this generation, but she had to admit that they were extraordinary experts of their generation. Otherwise, the Dao Progenitor wouldn’t have kept them here.

An Nanjing took a step forward, and then she slowly clenched her right fist. A moment later, she slammed it forward. Actually, she hadn’t just swung a single punch, and it actually carried at least 100 punches. However, An Nanjing was extremely fast to the point it looked like just one punch!

Bang!

Their fists collided, and the space here trembled. After that, both of them moved backward. At the same time, the space here gradually turned slightly ethereal.

Over 1km away, the old man glanced at his fist, and then he gazed at An Nanjing. There was a trace of solemnness in his eyes. The little girl before him was much, much stronger than he’d expected.

The old man shook his head, “Without our actual bodies, the three of us may not be a match for you even if we join forces! Your strength is really not bad. However, you have some flaws when it comes to the Fist Dao. If you’re willing, you can stay, and we’ll teach you everything we know so that our legacies won’t end with us!”

An Nanjing walked over to them and bowed slightly, “Thank you!”

An Nanjing wasn’t a proud and rude person. Of course, she was very proud sometimes. However, it depended on the person. She was a little like Yang Ye. She treated others how they treated her!

The old men heaved sighs of relief in their hearts when they heard An Nanjing’s agreement. It was difficult to get a renowned teacher, but it was even more difficult to get a good student. Any expert would like a monstrous genius like An Nanjing. As for a troublemaker like Yang Ye, few would like him.

An Nanjing learned very quickly. In less than two weeks of time, she’d learned everything the three old men could offer. Moreover, she’d even discussed the Martial Dao with them and merged with the essence of their Martial Dao, improving her own.

Just like that, An Nanjing left the room after two weeks had passed.

She glanced at the surroundings, and then looked at the room Yang Ye was in. Yang Ye still hadn’t emerged from there, so she looked at another door instead.

The Spear Dao!

She was naturally skilled in the spear, so she didn’t hesitate to enter the room.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was still merging the two techniques. Or to be more precise, he was ceaselessly perfecting it.

He was perfecting Burial and Backstab!

It was a complicated job, and it was extremely complicated for Yang Ye. The reason it was complicated was because he wanted to complete it to the limit, the true limit. His enemies were Sages now, and he couldn’t be careless at all if he wanted to kill them in an instant.

He didn’t possess An Nanjing’s natural talent. She dared to learn everything, and she could learn everything. Moreover, she could even derive from it and create something new. But Yang Ye didn’t have the ability to do that. While his natural talent wasn’t bad, it was quite inferior when compared to An Nanjing. So, he could only focus on one thing.

Just like that, time trickled by.

A month passed by!

The door of the room Yang Ye was in started to open slowly, and then Yang Ye walked out. Meanwhile, An Nanjing was already waiting outside.

Yang Ye gazed at her, “How many did you go into?”

She replied, “11!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

She said, “I learned a lot. All of them weren’t bad. What about you?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I learned some things in the Slaughter Dao. It was not bad indeed!”

She asked, “Didn’t you go to the Sword Dao?”

Yang Ye shrugged, “I did. Unfortunately, they weren’t willing to teach me!”

She frowned, “Why?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “It was nothing. Our paths differed. It’s not important, let’s go!”

“Wait!” As soon as she finished speaking, she entered the door for the Sword Dao.

“Sigh!” Yang Ye hurriedly followed her, and then he quickly grabbed her hand once he got inside, “It’s fine. I have my own Sword Dao, so it’s fine if I don’t learn from them. Let’s go!”

An Nanjing glanced at him, and then she glanced at the phantoms here. She didn’t say another word and just walked away with Yang Ye.

Suddenly, a voice came from behind them, “While there are a myriad of paths of the sword, needless to say, there’s really something seriously wrong with your Sword Dao if you treat it as a weapon to kill.”

An Nanjing stopped, and then she gazed at the phantom who said that, “And there’s nothing wrong with your Sword Dao?”

That person spoke indifferently, “At the very least, I don’t look down on my sword. I…”

Suddenly, An Nanjing vanished on the spot, and then she appeared before him and slammed her fist forward.

Bang!

The other phantoms watched as the phantom who spoke just now was obliterated by An Nanjing’s punch!

An Nanjing lowered her fist and walked over to Yang Ye, “Let’s go!”

“He’s just a phantom!” Suddenly, an old man with a sword on his back suddenly said, “If his real body was there, then little girl, you…”

An Nanjing suddenly gazed at the old man, “Even if his real body was here, I can still fight ten people like him! Allow me to be honest, I can crush all of you with one hand!”

She turned around and left once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye glanced at those phantoms who had quite unsightly expressions on their faces, and he said, “Actually, she’s not joking. She really is very formidable!”

Yang Ye left once he finished speaking.

All of them felt speechless.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing left the Hall of All, and then he glanced at An Nanjing, “Actually, that wasn’t necessary.”

An Nanjing gazed at Yang Ye, “You’re the only one in the younger generation who can make me sense a bit of danger. So, how dare they look down on you? What right do they have to do that?”

A little!

Yang Ye’s face was quite dark. He could only make An Nanjing feel a little bit of danger, just a bit!

Doesn’t she know how to speak to people?

Sometimes, the things An Nanjing said really struck a blow to his confidence!

Suddenly, Dao Qing appeared before them and glanced at them. At this moment, both of them felt unfathomable to him!

It was quite an absurd feeling because they were only at the Major Zen Realm, but that was how they felt to him!

Monstrous geniuses! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Dao Qing shook his head, restrained his thoughts, and said, “Both of you should have gained something, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “It was quite fruitful.”

“Good!” Dao Qing continued, “I wonder when you’ll be setting out for the endless black holes? Master sent a voice transmission that the large universe is starting to undergo some changes, and it won’t be long before something huge changes in the large universe. So, we should start as soon as possible!”

Yang Ye and An Nanjing exchanged glances, and then Yang Ye said, “Changes?”

Dao Qing nodded, “The spirit energy in some planets is starting to dry up slowly. The End Times is probably coming!”

The End Times!

Yang Ye’s face fell.
