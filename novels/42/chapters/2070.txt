Chapter 2071 – Sprites!

Daluo’s voice stopped abruptly because Yang Ye’s sword had arrived before him.

His expression didn’t change at all as he took a small step back and pushed his right palm forward. A pitch black rod appeared in his grasp, and he grabbed it tightly before stabbing it forward.

The rod struck straight against the tip of Yang Ye’s sword.

Clang!

A sharp explosion resounded.

The powerful force from the collision blasted both of them backwards. Suddenly, Daluo’s rod transformed into a ray of black light that shot up into the air before immediately slamming down at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye took a step back and raised his hands. A sword floated above each of his palms while a huge ethereal sword appeared around him.

Yang Ye had split his attention into three.

Yang Ye stomped his right foot down, and then three rays of light flashed instantaneously.

Meanwhile, the black ray of light had enveloped Yang Ye’s sword energy. However, it only took a moment for the sword energy to slice it apart, and they didn’t slow down at all as they instantly appeared before Daluo.

The powerful sword energy sliced open numerous little holes in the space around Daluo while Daluo himself had turned quite pale, and there was an unprecedentedly solemn expression in his eyes.

If he could stop this attack, he would live; if he failed, he would die!

Daluo closed his eyes slowly when Yang Ye’s attacks arrived before him, and at the moment his eyes were fully shut, he stabbed the rod forward.

Daluo hadn’t chosen to defend himself! He’d chosen to risk his life to take Yang Ye’s life!

He had extensive combat experience, so he knew that Yang Ye would definitely suppress him in battle if he retreated. Because at that time, he would lose his momentum in battle. In many battles, momentum was very important, and retreating would destroy that for him.

So, Daluo had chosen to risk his life. Of course, he didn’t really plan to lose his life, and he merely wanted to force Yang Ye to defend himself. So long as Yang Ye defended himself, he could counterattack and suppress Yang Ye instead!

It was a move that had never failed him.

Unfortunately, he was in battle with Yang Ye. Risking his life in battle? Yang Ye couldn’t wish for anything better!

Yang Ye’s swords didn’t slow down at all, and this caused Daluo’s pupils to constrict. He knew that he’d made the wrong choice. But at this moment, he couldn’t dodge anymore.

Hiss! Hiss!

The sound of bodies being torn open resounded twice, and then the surroundings fell silent.

Three breaths of time later, Yang Ye turned around and left.

There was a bloody hole in Yang Ye’s chest because Daluo’s rod had stabbed through him. However, Yang Ye’s sword had stabbed through Daluo’s body as well. Yang Ye’s body was strong, and he had Primordial Violet Energy too. So, while it had been able to harm him, it wasn’t lethal.

As for Daluo, he wasn’t that lucky. As soon as the swords stabbed him, the powerful energy within the swords instantly destroyed the life within Daluo.

Suddenly, Yang Ye stopped and walked over to Daluo. He sized up Daluo’s body and put the corpse away.

He planned to refine a Sword Servant!

A Major Zen Realm Sword Servant was extremely useful.

An hour later, Yang Ye succeeded in making Daluo into a Sword Servant.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then a smile curled up on his face. It gradually turned into a cold smile. He knew that Daluo wasn’t the first, and he wouldn’t be the last. However, Yang Ye didn’t mind. He was all alone now, so he didn’t fear anyone!

Not to mention a Major Zen Realm expert, he didn’t even fear a Sage!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and vanished into the distance.

Yang Ye shot through the boundless reaches of space on his sword. The stellar maps the prehistoric existence gave him represented four different worlds, and he was going to a world called Mist.

It was quite a strange name, but it made sense since it had been named by someone from the prehistoric times.

As he traveled, Yang Ye noticed that the route displayed on the stellar map was exactly similar to the route he was taking!

It was exactly similar!

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something, and then a solemn expression gradually appeared on his face. A long time passed before he shook his head and smiled, “So what? I just have to do what I have to do!”

Yang Ye sped up once he finished speaking.

A day later, Yang Ye stopped.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. At this moment, he finally understood why it was called Mist. Only white mist filled his vision, or it should be said that mist covered the entire planet!

It was all mist!

Yang Ye frowned, “How do I find that Sprite?”

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s eyes lit up as he’d thought of Snowy.

Snowy!

Since it was a sprite, it would never be able to escape Snowy. After all, Snowy innately countered such sprites. Moreover, her senses were amazing, so they would be absolutely incapable of escaping her!

However, Yang Ye didn’t call Snowy out immediately. After all, the evil treasure was still behind him.

The evil treasure!

As soon as he thought about it, Yang Ye suddenly realized something. The evil treasure was fond of devouring divine beasts and natural treasures!

So, if he found the Sprite, wouldn’t the evil treasure devour it?

“Just do what you need to do!” Suddenly, a voice came from behind him.

Yang Ye’s face froze. Sure enough, it’s still behind me.

Meanwhile, the evil treasure continued, “I’m not interested in that Sprite Lord you have with you or these other sprites. I won’t devour them. Because if I do, it’ll make someone unhappy. So, you don’t have to worry about them!”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Who’s that person?”

The evil treasure suddenly replied, “That’s none of your business!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened. What the hell? What a terrible temper!

Yang Ye ignored the evil treasure and summoned Snowy.

A small head emerged from Yang Ye’s chest, and she kept looking left and right.

Yang Ye patted her on the head and smiled, “Come out! It’s safe!”

Snowy immediately relaxed when she heard him and leaped up on his shoulder. She was about to rub her head against Yang Ye’s cheek when she suddenly looked off into the distance and pointed.

Yang Ye asked, “There’s something there?”

Snowy nodded.

Yang Ye took her in his arms and started walking in that direction. However, as he walked, Snowy suddenly pointed to the right, so Yang Ye immediately changed his direction. However, it didn’t take long for Snowy to point left. Just like that, Yang Ye went in circles with Snowy.

Yang Ye raised her up to eye level and said, “Little Fellow, are you playing with me?”

Snowy revealed an innocent expression.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to understand that Snowy wasn’t playing with him, and it was the thing which was going in a circle around them.

It was just around them!

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Where is it?”

Snowy pointed behind Yang Ye. A moment later, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he shot swiftly in that direction. However, he noticed nothing. As soon as he stopped, Snowy pointed behind him again!

Yang Ye’s face fell at the sight of this.

It was far faster than him!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and gazed at Snowy, “Can you make it show itself?”

Snowy blinked. A short while passed before she suddenly looked off into the distance and waved her paw lightly.

Nothing happened.

Snowy gazed at Yang Ye, and the latter shrugged. Snowy cracked a smile, and then she looked off towards the side and waved again.

However, nothing happened again.

It refused to give Snowy face!

Snow suddenly opened her mouth. In an instant, the mist here surged towards Snowy.

Suddenly, a ball of green light appeared not too far away from them.

Snowy immediately stopped when she saw it.

Yang Ye glanced at the ball of green light, and he saw a tiny green tail at the back of it.

A Sprite!

Yang Ye knew that the ball of light was the sprite on this planet. As for why it showed itself, it was obviously because of Snowy. Snowy was a Sprite Lord, and so these sprites had a good impression of her.

However, it seemed like the sprite was apprehensive towards him.

Meanwhile, Snowy gazed at Yang Ye, pointed at the ball of light, and then pointed at herself.

Yang Ye frowned, “It wants you to stay and play with it?”

Snowy nodded.

Yang Ye shook his head, “Tell it that you can’t. However, it can come with us.”

Snowy turned to the ball of green light and started waving her paws.

A short while passed before it started to tremble in response.

Meanwhile, Snowy gazed at Yang Ye. She was about to say something when something unexpected occurred. A huge golden net appeared above them. The green ball of light immediately transformed into a ray of green light that vanished into the distance.

Yang Ye and Snowy were stunned as well.

Suddenly, the ball of green light returned to them because the golden net had surrounded a huge area of space, and it was closing on them.

“I’ve been waiting for so long! You’ve finally shown yourself!” A voice resounded, and then a young man appeared outside the net. There was a middle aged man and an old man by the young man’s side.

The old man had his arms wrapped around a sword, and he was looking down. As for the middle aged man, he had a saber hanging from his waist, and his hand was on its hilt as he gazed at Yang Ye. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The young man’s gaze descended onto the ball of green light, and he smiled, “A Mist Sprite, one that has absorbed the energy in a planet for countless years. Tsk, tsk. No wonder even some progenitors are tempted by it!”

Meanwhile, the ball of green light suddenly flew over to Snowy, and then it touched Snowy’s paw with its tiny tail.

Snowy blinked, and then she patted the ball of light. After that, she struck her own chest and seemed to be assuring the sprite that she would protect it.

Meanwhile, the young man’s gaze descended onto Snowy. His eyes lit up when he saw Snowy, “What do I see? A Sprite Lord? Haha! The heavens are truly kind to me!”
