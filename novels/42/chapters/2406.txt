Chapter 2407 – The Desolate Race!

Kill!

Kill all the way!

Yang Ye roared with laughter, and then he took her hand and tapped the Myriad World Diagram.

Swish!

Two rays of blue light instantly enveloped them, and they vanished on the spot.

The Myriad World Diagram could teleport them almost anywhere!

Eternal Border.

Presently, a storm was brewing in Eternal Border.

Countless experts had returned from the Eternal River, causing the originally calm atmosphere of Eternal Border to become tense.

The ancestors of the six clans, the ancestors of the four powers in the Eternal River, the founding ancestor of the Immortal Estate, and countless other experts had converged here.

All of them had a single objective!

Yang Ye!

Or to be more precise, the Sprite Progenitor!

The Sprite Progenitor which could take them into Eternal Kingdom!

So long as they obtained it, they would be able to negotiate with Eternal Kingdom. No matter what they asked for, Eternal Kingdom would accept it for the sake of the Sprite Progenitor.

Anything could be discussed when it involved a Sprite Progenitor!

…

World Mountain. On the teleportation platform.

A teleportation formation suddenly trembled, and then a young man in a gray robe appeared there.

The young man walked out of the formation, and then the formation behind him trembled once more before an old man walked out from within it.

The old man walked over to stand silently behind the young man.

The young man glanced at the surroundings and smiled, “This is Eternal Border? Elder Cang, tell me about this place!”

The old man spoke softly, “Eternal Border has existed for almost a million years, and it has gone through four eras. The Ancient Era, the Elemental Era, the Primal Era, and the current era. The Ancient Era was too long ago, so its history is unknown. Besides that, the most dazzling era was the Primal Era. During that era, there were countless experts and geniuses here!”

The young man smiled, “Unfortunately, that era fell at the hands of our race!”

There was a wisp of pride on the corner of the old man’s mouth, “If it wasn’t for that Sprite Progenitor, we would have annihilated Eternal Kingdom. Unfortunate! Truly unfortunate!”

“The Sprite Progenitor!” The young man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Elder Cang, did our race really lose because of the Sprite Progenitor?”

The old man sighed softly, “The Sprite Progenitor’s strength isn’t terrifying, even 10 Sprite Progenitors would be no match for our patriarch. The true reason for her being terrifying was her ability to summon and converge others! It was too, too great.”

The young man asked, “What do you mean?”

The old man sighed again, “There were some races who were staying out of the war, and the Sprites as well. Even Eternal Border had remained neutral. However, once she joined the battle, all of them took Eternal Kingdom’s side, and countless living beings and Sprites from countless universes kept coming to provide support.”

He shook his head and continued, “Our race didn’t have the slightest advantage in any aspect anymore! Especially with the network of relationships that the Sprite Progenitor possessed. Once she joined the battle, countless seniors who were just watching the battle indifferently joined in. If our patriarch had continued to fight that war, the final outcome would be that besides our patriarch, everyone in our entire race would perish during that war! So, the patriarch had no choice but to retreat!”

The young man fell silent for a long time and asked, “Who gave the order to slaughter all the living beings and Sprites during the war?”

The old man laughed bitterly, “The patriarch’s younger brother. After that battle, the patriarch personally imprisoned him in a small world. But he should be coming out soon.”

The young man gazed at the old man, “Won’t he hate the patriarch?”

The old man shook his head, “He wouldn’t dare. The patriarch’s strength will make him dare not arouse even the slightest thought of that!”

The patriarch!

A wisp of solemnness appeared in the young man’s eyes. Or it should be described as fear and reverence!

It was a person who everyone revered and feared!

Meanwhile, Elder Cang said, “Seventh Prince, when the patriarch asked you and your siblings to search for the Sprite Progenitor, it’s actually a test. The one who gets the Sprite Progenitor will be our Crown prince!”

The Crown Prince!

A wisp of excitement flashed through his eyes. It was a position only inferior to the patriarch, and it came with very, very great authority. Moreover, it allowed one to enjoy countless resources of their race. It could be said that so long as he became the crown prince, he would gain both the greatest authority and resources in an instant!

Especially the authority!

In his race, their elusive patriarch rarely managed their race. In other words, the crown prince was equivalent to the one who managed the entire race!

The Sprite Progenitor!

However, the only way to become the crown prince was to obtain the Sprite Progenitor!

The young man restrained his thoughts and looked up at the sky, “The Sprite Progenitor belongs to me, Huang Yan!”

The old man and him vanished from the teleportation platform.

Once they left, an old man appeared here, and he looked up at the sky and shook his head as he sighed, “Eternal Border isn’t going to stay peaceful for long!”

…

White Emperor City.

Two rays of light descended from the sky and entered White Emperor City. They dispersed before the main hall in the city, and then Yang Ye and Bai Zhixian appeared there.

An Nanjing sat on the city walls while leaning against her spear. She had her eyes closed and seemed to be cultivating. Meanwhile, Snowy was on her shoulder. Snowy kept looking around, and no one knew what she was thinking.

At the entrance to the hall, the City Governor appeared before them, and he spoke solemnly when he saw Yang Ye and Bai Zhixian, “Why are you back?”

Bai Zhixian smiled bitterly, “Father, if we didn’t come back, White Emperor City would probably vanish from this world, right?”

The City Governor fell silent.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and there were no less than 10 concealed auras there. Every single one of them was at the Limitbreaker Realm at least.

Obviously, White Emperor City had been surrounded a long time ago.

If Yang Ye didn’t return, they would attack White Emperor City to force Yang Ye to return!

The City Governor laughed bitterly. How could he not be aware of White Emperor City’s current situation? Even then, he still didn’t hope for them to return.

There was no hope!

He couldn’t see any hope.

There were so many powers and experts who wanted Yang Ye’s life!

Yang Ye smiled and said, “You two chat!”

He turned around and left once he finished speaking. He went to the city walls and glanced at An Nanjing, “How many are there?”

“12!” She continued, “But they’ve left!”

They left!

Obviously, they knew of Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s strength, so they were afraid that Yang Ye and An Nanjing would attack them.

After all, the death of a single Limitbreaker Realm expert was a huge loss to them.

An Nanjing suddenly asked, “What’s your plan?”

My Plan?

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he glanced into the sky. Actually, he had no plan. He just wanted the people around him to be safe. Of course, there was one other thing, he was waiting, waiting for Snowy to fully transform into a Sprite Progenitor!

Snowy still needed his protection right now! And he would absolutely not let her fall into their hands and become their puppet!

If anyone tried to touch Snowy, he would fight them to the death!

Suddenly, An Nanjing looked to the side, and a middle aged man was approaching White Emperor City.

The middle aged man was robust and bearded, and he had a huge saber on his back. The saber was very wide, even wider than his body! Every single step he took made the ground tremble violently!

Besides that, there was an imposing aura on him, an overbearing aura!𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

As the middle aged man approached the city, the aura he emanated grew stronger and stronger.

When he arrived before the city entrance, a monstrous wave of pressure enveloped the entire city.

Everyone in White Emperor City was horrified!

A Three World Realm expert! Moreover, he was a saber cultivator!

Yang Ye was about to speak when An Nanjing suddenly leaped off the city wall and appeared before him.

The middle aged man glanced at her and said, “Fuck off! I don’t hit women!”

An Nanjing didn’t say a word and just tapped the tip of her foot down.

Hiss!

An afterimage flashed.

The middle aged man frowned slightly when An Nanjing vanished, and then he clenched his right fist and slammed it forward!

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and he was pushed back repeatedly. He only managed to stop himself around 300m away, and as soon as he did that, a wave of powerful pressure arrived before him.

A spear!

At this moment, the middle aged man didn’t dare act carelessly. He drew his saber with both hands and swung it, “Skybreaker!”

Along with his furious shout, the sky shook violently, and it seemed like a pair of scissors had cut it open.

Meanwhile, the spear arrived.

Bang!

As soon as they collided, the sky trembled violently, and then the middle aged man was blasted over 1km back with this saber.

Once he stopped himself, the ground beneath his feet immediately collapsed. At the same time, blood covered his arms because An Nanjing’s attack had cracked both of them open!

The middle aged man had a solemn expression on his face. Suddenly, An Nanjing stomped her right foot down, and then she appeared in front of him. After that, she slammed the black spear down with both hands!

The middle aged man’s pupils constricted slightly. He didn’t dare act carelessly against this attack and flicked his saber upward with both hands.

Hiss!

Everywhere it passed, space was instantly sliced open.

Bang!

Spear and saber collided. The middle aged man was immediately blasted backward again. An Nanjing was about to follow up with another attack when a ray of sword energy flashed.

The hairs on the middle aged man’s body instantly stood on end, and he instinctively dodged to the right.

Hiss!

The middle aged man appeared 300m to the right, but one of his arms was still there where he’d been just a moment ago.

However, that wasn’t the end of it. At the instant his figure appeared to the right, another ray of sword energy had flashed. An instant later, the man’s eyes opened wide, “So… So fast…”

As soon as he finished speaking, his head tilted to the side and fell off his neck.

Blood sprayed out like a fountain!
