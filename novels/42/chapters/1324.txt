Chapter 1325 – Did You Grow Up On Shit?

As soon as she finished speaking, the Demon Empress’ voice became cold, and she waved her right hand, “Attack!”

Once she finished speaking, her figure shot up into the air towards the 12 rays of light. At the same time, 10 other figures within the army shot up into the air and followed closely behind her.

Voider Realm demon beasts!

Suddenly, those 12 Voiders of the Nie Clan sped up, and they transformed into a speck of light that vanished into the sky.

The Demon Empress’ eyes narrowed slightly. She waved her hands and the space before her shook violently. A huge spatial rift appeared before her, and it didn’t take long for her to enter it with those 10 Voider Realm demon beasts.

Meanwhile on Heaven Pillar Peak, Nie Hun suddenly soared into the air and said, “Everyone, the experts of my Nie Clan have headed to attack the demon race’s base camp, so come with me and kill the others!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure shot towards the distance.

Lin Qian and the others hesitated briefly before they charged after him. The Voiders of the Nie Clan had drawn away the Voiders of the demon race, so the other demon beasts outside weren’t a huge threat to them. Thus, it was the best moment for them to deal with the demon beasts.

All the human experts on Heaven Pillar Peak charged down the mountain.

The war erupted!

Mo Xiaoleng had a wisp of ridicule on the corners of her mouth as she stood on the eagle. She tapped the eagle’s back lightly with her right foot, and then it instantly flapped its wings and transformed into a gale that vanished on the spot.

Bang!

At the same time, a strand of golden flames shot up into the air and swept towards Nie Hun’s group.

Nie Hun’s expression changed. He didn’t dare act carelessly when he noticed the energy contained within the golden flames, and his profound energy surged madly before he slapped his right palm forward. A circle of white light immediately swept out from his palm, and it instantly collided with the golden flames.

Bang!

As soon as they collided, Nie Hun’s expression changed again because the circle of white light had been instantly incinerated. Meanwhile, a young woman appeared in front of him. It was Mo Xiaoleng, of course. Mo Xiaoleng glanced coldly at Nia Hun, and then a tiny fire dragon suddenly shot out from the center of her brows and charged at Nie Hun.

Nie Hun’s pupils constricted. The profound energy within him surged madly as he slapped both his palms forward, and a ray of white light surged out from within him.

Bang!

Nie Hun’s figure was blasted over 3km away while an explosion resounded. Once he stopped himself, Nie Hun was shocked because his hands were mangled and only bones remained on them. What flame is that? It can even destroy my profound energy barrier with ease!Mo Xiaoleng was about to continue attacking when she suddenly frowned and looked towards the distance. The demon race’s army was in a bad situation. They had comparatively fewer Voiders, only 6. But the human race had 14 Voiders. So, the demon race’s Voiders were at a disadvantage. Moreover, the humans had even sent 2 Voiders to kill the Emperor Rank demon beasts.

Mo Xiaoleng glanced coldly at the human Voiders, and then she raised her right hand. In an instant, the multicolored python on her right arm shot forward. It expanded in midair and instantly transformed into a huge python. The multicolored python swung its tail, and it instantly swept towards the closest Voider.

Bang!

That Voider was caught off guard and instantly whipped around 5km away!

The others here were shocked by this turn of events. Meanwhile, Mo Xiaoleng tapper her right foot lightly against the Cloud Eagle before she soared up into the air. As soon as that happened, the eagle immediately transformed into a ray of light that shot towards a human Voider.

Once the multicolored python and Cloud Eagle joined the battle, the situation was instantly turned around. The human experts were completely suppressed. Even though the human Voiders still outnumbered the Voiders from the demon race, their quality was inferior. Moreover, the Voiders from the demon race possessed extremely terrifying defensive abilities. Especially when they were wearing Emperor Rank armor. It caused the human Voiders to have a huge headache when dealing with them.

Without Voiders to help them, the situation that the Emperors of the human race were in while facing the Emperors of the demon race could only be described as horrible.

They were being crushed!

Absolutely crushed!

The human Emperors were completely crushed by the Emperors of the demon race. In next to no time, the over 100 human Emperors had perished, but just around a dozen Emperors from the demon race had perished. Something worth mentioning was that some human Emperors had actually started to flee not long after the battle began.

As for the demon race, they still maintained order, and the groups were even working together with each other.

If the human race hadn’t engaged in internal strife before this and working together wholeheartedly to fight the demon race, then perhaps it would have a chance. Yet now, the human experts were being slaughtered!

There was a cold smile on the corners of Mo Xiaoleng’s mouth. She gazed at Nie Hun and didn’t waste her breath at all. A tiny golden flame instantly appeared on her palm, and then she tossed it at Nie Hun. The flame grew in midair, and it only took a moment for it to transform into a 300m long fire dragon.

Once the golden dragon appeared, the space around it instantly became ethereal, and it seemed to be on the verge of being incinerated. It was a horrifying sight.

Nie Hun’s expression changed. He’d experienced the strength of those flames, so he didn’t dare act carelessly at all. His profound energy surged while he formed strange seals with his right hand. Space instantly started to tremble violently once he started to form the seals, and it didn’t take long for countless circles of dazzling white light to flash out from space. The circles of light overlapped upon each other before sweeping forward like a ripple.

Bang!

As soon as the flame dragon and ripple of white light collided, a rumbling explosion resounded. Countless waves of energy and flames swept towards the surroundings, but the waves of energy were instantly incinerated by the flames. Meanwhile, a small flame suddenly tore through the air and shot towards Nie Hun!

Nie Hun’s expression instantly changed drastically. This time, he didn’t fight it directly, and he just fled around 10km away.

Mo Xiaoleng was stunned when she saw Nie Hun flee. Obviously, she hadn’t expected Nie Hun to flee. Nie Hun was a Voider! A true Voider!

After she recovered from her surprise, Mo Xiaoleng glanced at Nie Hun while she laughed with ridicule, “Did you grow up on shit? Otherwise, why are you like trash?”

Nie Hun’s face twitched and was extremely unsightly.

Mo Xiaoleng paid no attention to him. She gazed at another human Voider, and then tossed the golden flame over. That Voider was horrified. He’d seen how terrifying that flame was. Even Nie Hun couldn’t resist it, let alone him!

So, he immediately fled over 10km away. However, as soon as he fled, another Voider behind him who wasn’t able to flee in time had instantly suffered the consequences. That Voider was caught off guard and was struck by the flame.

“AH!” A shrill and miserable cry resounded through the air, and it only took a moment for that Voider to be incinerated into ash.

All the other Voiders were shocked. Who is she? What is that flame? It’s actually so terrifying!

All the Voiders gazed at Mo Xiaoleng with extreme vigilance as they were very afraid that she would toss the flame at them. The facts proved that Mo Xiaoleng really was prepared to toss it at them. Another flame appeared on her palm. All the human Voiders’ expressions changed drastically at the sight of it, and then they moved back while their profound energy surged. They were ready to flee at any moment.

Mo Xiaoleng chuckled when she saw them react in that way, and then she tossed the flame. It left a very long trail of flames behind it as it shot forward.

The Voiders in the area hurriedly moved aside. They’d moved away, but the Emperors behind them suffered calamity. Those Emperors wanted to flee as well, but they couldn’t flee because the flame was truly too swift.

Bang!

Around 10 Emperors in that area weren’t able to dodge in time, and they were obliterated on the spot without leaving even a trace behind.

Meanwhile, another flame appeared on Mo Xiaoleng’s palm.

“Senior Nie!” Meanwhile, Lin Qian who was in battle with another Voider gazed at Nie Hun and roared with fury. Nie Hun was the only one amongst them who could fight the young woman. If he didn’t act, then all the other Voiders here would only suffer death if they faced her. As for the other Voiders, it was obvious that they wouldn’t even have the ability to fight back!

Nie Hun stared fixedly at the young woman. At this moment, his hands had no flesh left on them, and only the bones there remained. He could regrow his severed limbs, but he was shocked to notice that he actually couldn’t restore his lost flesh!

He gazed at the golden flame on Mo Xiaoleng’s palm. What is that flame?

After all, if he had just fled a moment later and allowed the flame to come into contact with him.... He didn’t dare think about the consequences.

Mo Xiaoleng paid no attention to the others and just tossed the golden flame again. This time, she’d tossed it at Lin Qian who spoke a moment ago.

Lin Qian’s face turned grim, and he immediately abandoned the Voider Realm demon beast before him and vanished on the spot. However, as soon as he left, 3 Emperors behind where he stood were struck by the flames. Those Emperors didn’t even get to let out a shrill cry before they were incinerated.

Lin Qian’s eyelids twitched. He turned around to look at Nie Hun, and then his face fell. Because since the very beginning, Nie Hun had no intention to do anything. He wanted to, but he wasn’t a match for the young woman. Even if he tried, he would just be giving his life away. But Nie Hun was different, while he was no match for the young woman as well, he could keep her busy!

Soldier against soldier, general against general. If Nie Hun didn’t fight her, then how could they deal with her when they weren’t even on the same level as her?

Meanwhile, another golden flame appeared on Mo Xiaoleng’s palm.

At the same time, the Emperors abandoned their opponents and fled in succession. Nie Hun and the other Voiders didn’t dare to go head-on against Mo Xiaoleng, so she would be absolutely able to annihilate all of them at will. Under such circumstances, how could they dare to stay here and fight?

In the beginning, only some fled, but it didn’t take long for more and more to flee. In just a few breaths of time, all the human Emperors had actually started to flee!
