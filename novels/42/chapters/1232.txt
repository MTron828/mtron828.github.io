Chapter 1233 – Qiong Qi! Get Out Here Right Now!

As soon as he stopped, both of them were encircled by those Swordspike Tigers.

Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto them while an arc curled up on the corners of his mouth. The weakest amongst them were Quasi Emperors, so they would definitely be extremely strong if they formed a joint army with humans.

After all, when the number of Quasi Emperors arrived at a certain level, they could pose a threat to Emperors. Especially these Swordspike Tigers, they were utterly incomparable to ordinary Quasi Emperor Realm demon beasts. Just like this very moment. While his body was comparable to an Emperor Realm demon beast, if he relied solely on his body and didn’t utilize any treasures, then he would have no choice but to flee if the Swordspike Tigers swarmed him. Actually, just over 20 Quasi Emperor Realm Swordspike Tigers were sufficient to pose a threat to him.

Of course, if he could use his sword, then he wouldn’t fear them even if they swarmed him.

In the past, his physical strength was comparable to the strength of his Sword Dao. Yet now, once he attained Rebirth Rank sword intent, his Sword Dao had far surpassed his body. As for his body at the Divine Shift Realm, it wasn’t really sufficient anymore.

Yun Banqing was stunned when she saw him stop and said, “You want to subdue them?”

Yang Ye nodded while a trace of fervor arose in his eyes. These Swordspike Tigers were already extremely strong right now, so if they were fostered into the Emperor Realm, then they would definitely be a terrifying army!

Yun Banqing said, “Let’s think about that in the future and flee first?”

Yang Ye returned to his senses. He glanced at the surroundings and noticed that the Swordspike Tigers were glaring angrily at him while ceaselessly gnashing their teeth. The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. Hearing what she said just now had caused his thoughts to fly far away, and he’d forgotten that he couldn’t fight these Swordspike Tigers right now!

2 Emperors and over 100 Quasi Emperors....

It would be quite troublesome even if he could use his sword! After all, Emperor Realm demon beasts weren’t like ordinary human Emperors. It wouldn’t be too difficult if he could pierce through their defenses, but if he couldn’t, then it would be a huge problem.

As for subduing them.... He didn’t think he had some kind of kingly aura that would make them submit obediently just like that! Demon beasts were extremely unyielding. Even if one’s strength far surpassed them, they may not submit!

After he realized the facts of the situation, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and started to prepare to flee. Meanwhile, the golden Swordspike Tiger which led the group suddenly howled, and then over 100 Swordspike Tigers howled in unison before charging at Yang Ye.

The imposing aura emanated from the charge of over 100 Quasi Emperor Swordspike Tigers was even more terrifying than the aura of 10 Emperors!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “These Swordspike Tigers really are not bad!”

Bang!

A strand of imposing aura surged out explosively from Yang Ye and instantly obstructed the imposing aura of those Swordspike Tigers. A moment later, Yang Ye stomped his foot against the ground, and his figure shot towards the golden Swordspike Tiger which led the group.

Roar!

Ferocity flashed through its eyes when it saw Yang Ye charge at it, and it immediately leaped up and slammed its head against Yang Ye.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s fist smashed against its head. The space in the surroundings rippled violently while the golden Swordspike Tiger was blasted almost 1km back. Yang Ye was blasted flying as well, but it only took him a moment to stop his figure. After that, he gazed at the golden Swordspike Tiger and said, “Just you wait. I’ll come back for you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around and vanished from its field of vision.

The Swordspike Tigers intended to pursue him. But the golden Swordspike Tiger howled, and they instantly stopped.

The gold Swordspike Tiger looked in the direction Yang Ye left towards, and a long time passed before it withdrew its gaze and left with the other Swordspike Tigers.

Yang Ye took Yun Banqing with him as he dashed forward all along the way. Now, he finally knew why Sword God Island was dangerous. It was because one couldn’t scan the surroundings with divine sense, and there were numerous demon beasts on the island, so one might run into the lair of demon beasts at any moment. The speed of ordinary humans would definitely be incapable of outrunning demon beasts that had 4 legs!

Meanwhile, Yun Banqing asked, “You really intend to subdue them?”

Yang Ye nodded. He really did have such intentions, but he knew that it was quite difficult. Demon beasts were proud, and he was very clearly aware that it was difficult to make them submit to humans!

Yun Banqing suddenly said, “I have a way!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “How?”

She replied, “Do you know why there are demon beasts on the island?”

Yang Ye asked, “What are you trying to say?”

Yun Banqing explained, “The demon beasts on the island were actually raised by Sword God’s Palace. Why? Most of them were raised to temper the disciples of Sword God’s Palace, but some are the guardian demon beasts of the Sword God’s Palace. However, there were very few demon beasts all those years ago, and the reason they’ve become so numerous and strong is because of Sword God’s Palace’s destruction. No one is there to manage them, and that’s why they’ve been multiplying without restrained and fighting each other. Under such circumstances, they grew more and more numerous, and they grew stronger and stronger!”

Yang Ye gazed at her to signal that she should continue.

Yun Banqing continued, “If you want to subdue them, then you must obtain the symbol of the Sword God’s Palace’s master, the Sword God’s Seal. They recognize the Sword God’s Seal. If you obtain it, then you won’t just be able to subdue the Swordspike Tigers, even the other demon beasts throughout the island will obey your command!”

The Sword God’s Seal! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. It was one of the objectives he had on this trip to the ruins of Sword God’s Palace. It could enhance sword intent and sword energy, and it even had a formidable formation within it. It just happened to be suitable for him!

“Actually, many clans and sects from the Veiled Region sent their forces here, and their objective was the Sword God’s Seal as well. However, no one god it.” Yun Banqing glanced at him and said, “So don’t be too hopeful!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then raised his head and looked forward. There was a towering mountain range in the distance, and they stretched beyond the limits of his vision.

There were countless formidable demon beasts hidden there, and if he could subdue them all....

Yun Banqing looked towards the distance and said, “Actually, many haven’t even been able to arrive at the ruins and died in this mountain range. If it wasn’t for you, I would definitely die in this mountain range as well.” As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before she said, “No matter what, thank you.”

Yang Ye touched his nose and said, “Miss Yun, I’m not someone who likes to beat around the bush. To be honest, I only helped you because we became acquainted earlier, and I wasn’t able to just stand by idly and watch you die. However, I have a reason as well.”

Yun Banqing seemed to have guessed he would say this and wasn’t surprised, “Go on!”

Yang Ye said, “I’ve established a small power and lack someone capable in management like Miss Yun. I hope you’ll help me!” The Sword Alliance was growing larger and larger. Even though Ye Liuyun’s ability wasn’t bad, there was a limit to it in the end. Moreover, it was truly too tiring for her to do it on her own.

Besides that, he was serious about developing the Sword Alliance, and he wasn’t just playing!

Yun Banqing fell silent.

Yang Ye said, “It’s fine if you refuse. I won’t force you!”

Yun Banqing shook her head slightly, “My mother and younger brother are at the Veiled Region....”

Yang Ye said, “I’ll get your mother and younger brother once we leave this place, alright?”

Yun Banqing looked up at him and said, “You....”

Yang Ye said, “I keep my word!”

She gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before she said, “Thank you!”

Yang Ye smiled and patted his chest. Snowy emerged from his chest. Yang Ye shook his head and smiled as watched Snowy’s eyes spin about. She was still cowardly as before, and she immediately hid herself as soon as he got into battle!

Yang Ye rubbed her head and said, “Where should we head to now?”

Snowy blinked, sniffed lightly, and then pointed towards a direction.

Yang Ye stretched out his hand and placed it around Yun Banqing’s waist, and then he vanished on the spot.

They traveled according to the direction Snowy provided them, and it didn’t take long for them to arrive at a gorge. Snowy pointed at a mountain wall, and Yang Ye was stunned when he looked over.

There was a tree there, and it was covered in fist-sized golden fruits. They were very familiar to him, and he’d even eaten those fruits in the past!

They were Adamantium Fruits!

Yun Banqing cried out involuntarily, “Ripe Adamantium Fruits!”

Yang Ye nodded while a trace of excitement arose in his eyes. These Adamantium Fruits were much larger than the Adamantium Fruits which he’d eaten in the past! Moreover, there were over 300 on the free!

Over 300 ripe Adamantium Fruits!

Yang Ye was about to take them when his expression suddenly changed. He turned to look towards the distance, and an old man in a luxurious robe had suddenly appeared there.

An Emperor!

Yun Banqing glanced at the old man and didn’t speak. After witnessing the strength Yang Ye possessed, not to mention a single Emperor, she wouldn’t be afraid even if there were 3 Emperors there.

The old man paid no attention to Yang Ye. He looked up at the tree and said, “Adamantium Fruits! Awesome! I’ll get at least a few tens of thousands of violet crystals by selling them to the oceanic demon beast clans!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

As soon as he finished speaking, he gazed at Yang Ye and said, “I saw both of you on the shuttle. I never expected you to survive before them. Looks like you have some strength.” He pointed at the tree and said, “Everyone who sees a treasure should be entitled to a share of it. So how about we share it equally?”

However, Yang Ye hurriedly shook his head, “Strength is the only respected standard. All of these belong to you, Senior. I dare not ask for any. Right, all of them belong to you. Feel free to take them!”

Yun Banqing glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent.

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “You’re quite sensible, then I’ll let you live.”

“Thank you, Senior!” Once he finished speaking, Yang Ye grabbed Yun Banqing’s hand and moved backwards.

The old man glanced at Yang Ye, and then he didn’t hesitate to flash towards the tree.

Yang Ye didn’t launch a surprise attack against the old man. He just took Yun Banqing in his arm, turned around, and ran.

“AH!” After he arrived over 1km away, a shrill and miserable cry resounded abruptly from behind him.

It was the old man’s voice!

Yun Banqing gazed at Yang Ye, but she noticed that he had an extremely solemn expression on his face. Her heart shook at the sight of that, and she turned around to look behind him. Her face instantly turned ghastly pale, and she wrapped her arms tightly around Yang Ye.

As for Snowy, she fainted from her fear.

Yang Ye ran as he struck his chest and said, “Qiong Qi! Get out here right now! Help me!”
