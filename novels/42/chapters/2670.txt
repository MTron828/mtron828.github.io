Chapter 2671 – Fuck Off!

Once Erya split open the pool, a hand suddenly stretched out from below.

Erya’s expression changed slightly, and she was about to close the pool again. However, the hand was suddenly clenched.

Bang!

The entire pool exploded apart.

Erya hurriedly pulled Snowy back. At the same time, Snowy quickly pointed at the cow and sheep, and so Erya quickly took them with her.

Meanwhile, a vortex had formed at the pool, and a ray of sword energy shot out from the wooden pavilion.

Hiss!

The pool was suddenly torn apart, and then a black shadow shot up into the air from beneath the pool and vanished into the distant sky.

A moment later.

Boom!

The entire Destiny Realm shook, and it seemed like something had been broken apart.

Meanwhile, the woman in black appeared before Erya and Snowy.

They were quite guilty because it seemed like they’d released something extraordinary!

The woman in black shot a glance into the sky and frowned.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had rushed over. He was furious when he saw them. Obviously, the two little fellows had caused trouble!

The woman in black gazed at Erya and Snowy. Snowy looked down guiltily while Erya refused to submit and gazed indifferently at her.

Erya was prepared to fight!

Yang Ye hurriedly said, “What was that?”

The woman in black replied indifferently, “Someone I imprisoned.”

Yang Ye asked, “Is that person formidable?”

The woman in black glanced at him, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

The woman gazed at Erya and Snowy. She gazed at them for a long time, and then she turned around and left.

Yang Ye glared at the little fellows and hurried after the woman in black.

Snowy and Erya exchanged glances. In the end, Snowy pointed downward. She was saying that the treasure was still there!

Erya glanced at Snowy, “Didn’t you say that it wasn’t dangerous?”

Snowy blinked and shrugged. She was saying that there was no danger!

Erya sighed softly and rubbed Snowy’s head, “You’re really brave.”

As she spoke, she walked toward the pool. Since they’d already caused trouble here, it would be a waste to not get some treasures!

The woman in black arrived at the top of the waterfall and looked down below. No one knew what she was thinking.

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Is that person very dangerous?”

The woman in black replied indifferently, “His name is Mo Yu. Another one of my forms chose him in the past. Unfortunately, his ambition was too great, even greater than the Desolate Emperor. Of course, ambition isn’t a bad thing, but if it’s built on destroying some things, then it’s ambition that must be destroyed.”

Yang Ye asked, “What does he want to do?”

She replied softly, “He wants to become the overlord of the Three Dimensional Universe, and he even wants to explore the Four Dimensional Universe.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “As he grows stronger, it’s very normal for him to have such thoughts!”

The woman in black replied indifferently, “Yes, it’s very normal. Unfortunately, you don’t understand. The more he thinks of that, the quicker death will come for him!”

Yang Ye hesitated to speak.

She laughed coldly, “Go on, I won’t hit you!”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “Firstly, I don’t know why you kill those Destiny Realm experts, but have you thought about how doing that is…”

She asked, “It’s very selfish? And cruel?”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “You’ve entered the Four Dimensional Universe but you refuse to let others do the same. Moreover, you kill everyone at the Destiny Realm. To be honest, that is really… Um…”

She remained silent.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “Can you tell me the reason?”

She glanced coldly at him, and Yang Ye said, “She gave me her sword. I think I should have the right to know a little, right?”

The woman in black fell silent for a long time, and then she said, “The Three Dimensional Universe isn’t absolutely safe!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “You mean…”

She nodded, “All those years ago, I thought everything would be over once I killed the Heaven Dao. However, once I entered the Four Dimensional Universe, I realized that it may not be the end but the beginning. The bigger fish feed on smaller fish. You understand that principle, right?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

She continued, “The Four Dimensional Universe is practically devoid of any living beings. It’s an empty universe.”

She suddenly gazed at Yang Ye and laughed coldly while killing intent surged in her eyes.

Yang Ye felt quite speechless. What’s wrong with her? Her emotions just change so quickly!

The woman in black looked up at the distant sky, “Killing them is for their own good!”

Yang Ye was truly speechless. You’re killing them for their own good? How can you be so shameless?

She continued, “Take the Desolate Emperor for example. What happened after he got there? He was killed.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “It’s their problem if they want to court death, but killing them is…”

She said, “If they die there, they will be devoured and allow some existences to grow increasingly stronger. All of them are the peak experts of this universe, and so those existences will grow stronger upon devouring them.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and cracked a smile, “Stop trying to pity them. Just wait and see. It won’t be long before some responsibilities will fall onto your shoulders, and then you won’t even have a chance to cry!”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “I can refuse it!”

“Then die!” She spoke coldly, “If you have the courage, abandon those two swords and then go into seclusion with those fellows in that pagoda of yours.”

Yang Ye fell silent.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

She continued, “Don’t even think about benefiting without doing anything. And you’ll never have peace while you have those two little fellows with you. You either have to die or become so strong that no one dares to try and kill you.”

She turned around and vanished into the distance.

Yang Ye fell silent on the mountain peak.

Go into seclusion?

Yang Ye laughed with self-ridicule. How?

If he wanted to do that, he would have to abandon Snowy and Erya.

But how could he ever do that?

Yang Ye turned around and left.

Just as she’d said, he had no way out. He could only go forward until the end.

Yang Ye went to the pool of water. Meanwhile, Erya just happened to be climbing out from below, and she was holding a pitch black armor.

The armor was completely black and seemed as if it was made from some kind of scales.

When they saw Yang Ye, Erya and Snowy exchanged glances, and then Erya raised the armor in Yang Ye’s direction while cracking a smile, “Big Brother Yang, here! This is from Snowy and me!”

Snowy hurriedly nodded.

They were using it to apologize!

Yang Ye put the armor aside and squatted before them. He gazed at the little fellows and spoke softly, “It was very dangerous just now.”

Erya gazed at Snowy. The latter blinked and smiled at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye shook his head slightly and gazed at Snowy, “Snowy, you need an accurate idea of Erya and my strength. You must know what can be done, and what can’t. You need to understand all of that very well. Understand?”

Snowy nodded. She didn’t dare to refuse because she was worried that she would be beaten!

Yang Ye led Erya and Snowy to the pavilion. He’d decided to leave.

He had many, many things to do. So, he couldn’t just stay here!

Yang Ye cupped his fist toward the pavilion, “We’re leaving. Until we meet again.”

He received no reply.

Yang Ye shook his head slightly and was about to leave with Erya and Snowy. However, a figure suddenly appeared before them.

It was the woman in black.

She glanced at Erya, “That spear and the black scroll, both of you took them, right?”

Erya gazed at her slightly vigilantly.

The woman in black frowned, “You just take what belongs to others?”

Erya spoke coldly, “Haven’t you heard that the virtuous receive the treasures of the world?”

She gazed coldly at Erya, “You really need a beating!”

Erya wanted to say more, but Yang Ye stopped her and gazed at the woman in black, “They have no ill intent. I’ll make them return those things to you…”

“Forget it!” The woman suddenly said, “I don’t care about those things.”

As she spoke, she glanced at Yang Ye, “Mo Yu is quite strong. My other form couldn’t bear to kill him, so she asked me to capture and imprison him. Now, he’s probably full of resentment, and you’re someone another form of mine chose and you even have two of our swords. So, based on his character, he’ll probably come looking for you.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I see.”

The woman in black was surprised, “You’re not afraid?”

“Afraid?” Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he shook his head and smiled, “I’ve never feared anyone in my lifetime. Anyway, if I kill him, will that other form of yours attack me?”

She gazed at him for a long time and replied, “Don’t worry, I’ll help you if she does. I can’t stand the sight of him too.”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

“Hey!” Meanwhile, Erya suddenly said, “Those people I saw in the cemetery. I mean that Mortal Emperor, that guy whose name was unknown, and that person, Yang Busi. If you’re compared to them, which one of you is stronger?”

The woman in black glanced coldly at Erya, “Almost all of them died to the Heaven Dao, but the Heaven Dao is dead now, and I’m alive. So, what do you think?”

Erya couldn’t stand the woman in black’s tone. She immediately clenched her fists and waved them, “The day will come when I beat you up until you cry!”

The woman in black replied indifferently, “Anytime!”

Erya wanted to say more, but Yang Ye shook his head slightly and stopped her. After that, he gazed at the woman in black, “One last thing, Little Qi and Tian Xiu…”

The woman in black suddenly interrupted angrily, “Why do you interfere in the business of adults? Just fuck off!”

Yang Ye, Snowy, and Erya were stunned speechless.
