Chapter 2566

Yang Ye was overjoyed!

It was a truly pleasant surprise!

Would Qi Bitian teach him trash? Absolutely not! Because she didn’t even think highly of Super Divine Treasures!

Something that could occupy her mind was absolutely amazing!

While he was overjoyed inside, Yang Ye remained quite calm on the outside. He couldn’t allow it to show at a time like this, or she would look down on him!

Yang Ye acted stunned for a moment, and then he walked over to her and smiled, “What is it?”

She sat on the steps outside the house, “A sword technique!”

Yang Ye was quite surprised, “You know sword techniques?”

She replied, “It’s just a single move. It felt pretty good, so I committed it to memory! I’d almost forgotten it, but after I saw you training, I recalled it again.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Qi Bitian said, “The Hell Sphere!”

“The Hell Sphere?” Yang Ye frowned slightly, “A sword technique?”

She nodded, “It’s pretty good, and it even injured me. Hell Sphere is creating a sphere of hell! It’s similar to your Sword Domain, but different at the same time. Do you wanna learn it?”

Yang Ye hurriedly nodded, “I do!”

Qi Bitian nodded slightly, “Hell Sphere is to create a sphere of space around you. It’s like a miniaturized version of your Sword Domain. You just have to shrink your Sword Domain to the point it’s only covers the area you stand on.”

Yang Ye quickly asked, “And then?”

She continued, “Now that you have your sphere, it’s time to create hell. Your sword cultivators use sword energy, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Of course!”

Qi Bitian said, “So, just madly release your sword intent and sword energy. But remember that they must not exceed the sphere you’ve created. They must remain within that sphere. If you can do accomplish that, then you’ve cultivated the technique successfully!”

Yang Ye was stunned, and he wondered if that was all!

Qi Bitian said, “You think it’s very easy?”

Yang Ye smiled embarrassedly, “It should be, right?”

She shrugged, “Why don’t you give it a try?”

Yang Ye went to the side, activated his Sword Domain, and started to shrink it. It didn’t take long for it to form a sphere around him. After that, he did as he said and madly released his sword intent and sword energy. However, as soon as they emerged, they shot out of that sphere…

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Qi Bitian gestured for him to continue.

Yang Ye took a deep breath. This time, he grew a little more serious as he continued releasing his sword intent and sword energy. In the beginning, they remained within the sphere, but as more and more of them emerged from him, he started to lose control of them! A short while later, they escaped the sphere again.

This time, Yang Ye had a solemn expression on his face.

Because he noticed that it wasn’t an easy task!

It was like filling a bottle with water, and the water overflowed naturally at some point!

Yet now, Qi Bitian wanted him to ceaselessly release his sword intent and sword energy within the sphere but stop it from overflowing!

In the beginning, it sounded like an easy task, but once he tried to accomplish it, he noticed that it wasn’t just difficult!

Qi Bitian spoke indifferently, “Didn’t you say it was easy? Go on!”

Yang Ye smiled embarrassedly and walked over to her before asking humbly for guidance, “Little Qi, I was wrong! Please guide me!”

She glanced at him and said, “Do you know why it’s so difficult?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

She said, “Because it’s a law of nature. Of course, that isn’t the real reason, the real reason is…”

She paused for a moment and continued, “I don’t know!”

Yang Ye was flabbergasted.

Qi Bitian added, “Just try again and I’ll try to figure it out!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened. Seriously!

Yang Ye didn’t refuse and just activated the Sword Domain again, and then he started trying again… Just like that, after doing it three more times, Qi Bitian told him to stop.

Yang Ye stood before her and listened in silence.

Qi Bitian said, “I know what’s the problem. There are two. Firstly, your control of your Sword Domain isn’t sufficient. Simply speaking, it isn’t strong enough, so it can’t suppress your sword intent and sword energy. The second reason is that you’re not sufficiently focused. You must be very, very focused. Your Sword Domain Sphere is like a bottle while your sword intent and sword energy are the water. You must put them all inside while acting as the lid. You must hold the lid tight, and only then will you be able to truly suppress them!”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “What happens after that?”

Qi Bitian smiled, “At that time, the owner of this technique used it against me, I was injured by it. Of course… Of course… Of course, I killed him, and I did it with one hand!

Yang Ye’s face darkened.

What the heck is she trying to say? Are you saying I wouldn’t be a match for you even if I succeed at cultivating this technique?!

However, he was never a match for her anyway!

Qi Bitian stood up, “A qualitative transformation! Once your sword intent and sword energy are condensed countless times, they will undergo a qualitative transformation, and it’s a terrifying transformation. It’s like blowing air into a person’s body, and that person explodes after some time!”

Yang Ye’s face was quite unsightly, “So, will I explode in the process too?”

She thought for a moment, “I’m not certain. But it’s possible. Of course, it may not happen as well!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, Qi Bitian walked over to Yang Ye and spoke seriously, “If you can accomplish that, the area within your Sword Domain Sphere will be hell that takes the lives of all who get close! Of course, it all depends on you. I’m going to play with Lei Lin. Have fun!”

She waved her hand, and a rattan ball flew into her grasp, and then she went to the side and started kicking it…

Yang Ye had quite a bitter expression on his face.

Dammit! She doesn’t seem really reliable!

Sword Domain Sphere?

Hell Sphere?

It really wasn’t very reliable! However, Yang Ye felt that it was possible!

So, to do it or not to do it?

After thinking for a while, Yang Ye decided to do it!

He'd decided to give it a try!

Yang Ye took a deep breath. He didn’t return to the cultivation room and just remained outside the bamboo house. Because if any mishaps occurred, he felt safer knowing Qi Bitian was here!

At the very least, she wouldn’t just let him die!

Yang Ye walked off to the side and activated his Sword Domain. After that, he started to condense it and release his sword intent and sword energy!

It wasn’t too bad in the beginning, all his sword intent and sword energy remained within the sphere, but as time passed, the Sword Domain Sphere was gradually losing control of the sword energy and sword intent! At this moment, he couldn’t stop because his sword energy and sword intent hadn’t undergone a qualitative transformation!

He had to continue!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and continued releasing both sword intent and sword energy. But this time, he slowed it down. Such things couldn’t be rushed, and they had to be taken slow. Especially when he was just starting out.

Meanwhile, Qi Bitian glanced at Yang Ye and muttered softly, “I didn’t misremember anything, right? Yes, I probably didn’t…”

She seemed to be slightly lacking in confidence and hurriedly went back to playing!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye went on condensing it all. Unfortunately, two hours later, he failed once more!

Moreover, he suffered backlash from it!

The backlash from his own sword intent and sword energy actually blasted him away. Fortunately, Qi Bitian had hurriedly lent him a hand and helped him escape calamity. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

She said seriously, “It’s fine. Take it slow. I’m certain you’ll succeed!”

Yang Ye was quite moved when he heard her. At least she had a heart!

After resting for a short while, Yang Ye continued. This time, he had more experience, and he took it slow from the very beginning! Previously, he’d tried to instantly fill the bottle, and he knew he couldn’t control that. So, he started to slow down and take it one step at a time!

This time, he lasted much longer!

Yang Ye gradually noticed that his sword intent and sword energy were starting to undergo a qualitative transformation. It was very subtle, but it was transforming. Because he could sense it clearly within his Sword Domain!

Yang Ye was overjoyed when he sensed this. It was really transforming!

However, it grew increasingly dangerous for him. Because he noticed that he was on the verge of losing control of it! Or it should be said that the energy they contained had started to pose a threat to him!

Fortunately, Qi Bitian wasn’t too far away. Otherwise, he wouldn’t dare to continue!

Continue!

Sweat gradually covered Yang Ye’s entire face!

However, Yang Ye’s sword intent and sword energy were transforming within the sphere, and the space around him was starting to tremble. It was very unstable!

Qi Bitian shot a glance at Yang Ye and was quite lacking in confidence.

She was afraid that Yang Ye would die!

But Yang Ye didn’t cause his own death!

As he gradually condensed and suppressed them, sword energy and sword intent filled the sphere, and they had become completely different now!

It was like an enhanced version of sword intent and sword energy!

A true qualitative transformation!

Yang Ye was overjoyed! And he pressed on!

He carefully released his sword energy and sword intent, and then carefully suppressed them to keep them from leaving the Sword Domain Sphere. Just like that, this cycle continued incessantly!

Qi Bitian had stopped playing. She just sat there and gazed at Yang Ye with curiosity on her face.

Finally, a long time later, Yang Ye finally sensed his true limit.

After that, something happened!

With Yang Ye’s Sword Domain Sphere at its center, the space in the surroundings actually started to vanish inch by inch… It truly vanished, and it hadn’t just been shattered!

At this moment, Yang Ye felt like he was full of strength!

He felt like he could destroy the world and instantly annihilate anything!

So, he gazed at Qi Bitian with a provocative look in his eyes!
