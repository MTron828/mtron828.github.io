Chapter 2704 – The Strongest is Here!

Executor was gone!

Mo Yu was stunned!

He'd been chosen by the owner of Heaven Executor in the past, so he could summon the sword through a secret technique. Of course, the precondition was that its owner, Tu, didn’t refuse. Earlier, he’d just been trying, and he was overjoyed to realize that Tu didn’t refuse.

However, he hadn’t expected it to be scared away by Yang Ye and the Good Sprite!

It had been scared away!

Crimson Sky too! It was a divine sword, yet it had been broken just like that!

It had even been broken with such ease!

He didn’t hesitate to transform into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

He’d fled!

Yang Ye glanced at the sky and didn’t give chase.

Snowy glanced at the pieces of Crimson Sky, hesitated for a moment, and then waved her paw. They returned to her grasp, and then after a few hits, Crimson Sky was restored.

At this moment, Crimson Sky was absolutely obedient.

Of course, it was linked to Mo Yu. Mo Yu had just fled without it, and that was a form of abandonment to a sword!

Snowy pointed at the sword and gazed at Yang Ye. He smiled, “You deal with it!”

Snowy nodded.

Yang Ye took Snowy back to the wooden house, glanced at the formation, and said, “Almost there.”

Outside the Destiny Dimension.

First God glanced at Mo Yu but surprisingly didn’t ridicule the latter.

Heng Wangu and the others didn’t say a word.

Heng Wangu gazed at the Destiny Dimension, “Attack!”

As soon as he said that, he tossed his folding fan forward, and it expanded as it flew. In an instant, the folding fan covered the entire area around the Destiny Dimension.

Meanwhile, Zuo Mu’s figure shot forward.

First God attacked as well.

A wave of powerful pressure rippled out of the Destiny Dimension when they attacked, but the pressure was obliterated before their joint forces!

The space there started to be obliterated!

In the Destiny Dimension.

Yang Ye glanced at the trembling space around him, grinned, and then gazed at Snowy. The latter nodded and quickly released spirit energy.

As more and more spirit energy appeared, the formation grew more and more unstable!

Especially when Heng Wangu’s group was attacking from the outside.

Around 15 minutes later, the entire Destiny Dimension was on the verge of destruction!

In the Destiny Realm, Yang Ye picked up Great Unknown and sent Zi’er into the Primordial Pagoda. After that, he took Snowy in his arms and the space before him cracked open.

Great Unknown’s teleportation ability!

Actually, Heng Wangu and the others had locked down the area outside. So, it would normally be impossible for him to leave without alerting them. However, he had Great Unknown, the divine sword that could teleport anywhere!

Right at the instant Yang Ye and Snowy vanished, a strand of pure spirit energy appeared.

At the instant that happened, the wooden house exploded into bits. At the same time, the entire Destiny Dimension exploded apart, and a wave of destructive energy swept through space.

Heng Wangu and the others’ expressions changed drastically as they retreated.

Rumble!

The entire area was obliterated, and the obliteration continued for around an hour!

At this moment, Heng Wangu and the others were in terribly embarrassing states.

Heng Wangu and the others had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces because they didn’t sense Yang Ye’s aura after it was destroyed!

He’d fled!

Yang Ye had fled right under their noses!

“Great Unknown!” Meanwhile, Mo Yu spoke abruptly, “He has that sword, Great Unknown, so he can teleport anywhere!”

Great Unknown!

First God gazed at Mo Yu, “Why didn’t you warn us earlier?”

Mo Yu replied indifferently, “I forgot, alright?”

First God’s eyes narrowed slightly while killing intent flickered within them, but Mo Yu remained unafraid.

He knew his strength was slightly inferior to First God, but he was very well aware that the End World really needed him. Moreover, he had trump cards too.

Suddenly, Heng Wangu said, “Can both of you stop causing trouble?”

They grunted coldly and didn’t say anything else.

Heng Wangu shook his head, “We have a common enemy, and I hope both of you remember that!”

He gazed at Mo Yu, “Where do you think he went?”

Mo Yu shook his head.

Heng Wangu nodded slightly, “Looks like we have to ask Mr. Jing for help.”

He turned around and left.

Zuo Mu and First God followed after him, but Mo Yu didn’t. The latter just vanished on the spot.

First God suddenly said, “He’s scheming something! I think we should get rid of him!”

Heng Wangu glanced at First God and smiled, “I know. You’re worried that because he was once chosen by the owner of Heaven Executor, he may turn on us to curry favor with her, right?”

First God nodded, “Exactly.”

Heng Wangu smiled, “Don’t worry, everything will be fine.”

First God glanced at Heng Wangu and didn’t say anything.

Not long after they left, a woman appeared here.

It was Sky Maiden.

The ethereal figure appeared once more by her side, “He has fled.”

She asked, “Where?”

The ethereal figure shook its head, “I don’t know. He can go anywhere with that sword. You don’t have to worry about him.”

She fell silent.

…

Eternal Border.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

At this moment, the war between Eternal Kingdom and the desolate race was practically at its end.

Both sides had still been unable to decide on the victory, but they were on the verge of that.

The entire Eternal River was covered in corpses, and the river itself had turned into a river of blood.

Some time later, Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes, and he was in a different world!

The woman in white’s Destiny Dimension!

He could go anywhere Great Unknown had been. Obviously, it had been here.

Actually, he’d planned everything in advance.

He couldn’t go head-on with the End World right now, so the best plan was naturally to flee.

But where to flee was a problem. In the end, he’d decided to use the Destiny Dimensions.

Besides the Four Dimensional Universe, these Destiny Dimensions were the safest.

Because of his relationship with the woman in white, he chose her Destiny Dimension.

Yang Ye scanned the surroundings. Her Destiny Dimension was unlike the woman in black’s. Because it was an ocean, and at the center of the ocean was a small island. An especially small island, and it was the only thing here besides the ocean.

Snowy scanned the surroundings curiously. Suddenly, she looked down into the ocean, and then she glanced at Yang Ye and pointed down.

Yang Ye asked, “There’s something down there?”

Snowy nodded.

Yang Ye asked, “Is it dangerous?”

Snowy shook her head.

Yang Ye naturally didn’t trust the little fellow. Even if he asked if the Four Dimensional Universe was dangerous, she may still say that it wasn’t. Besides a few existences, she didn’t fear anything else.

Yang Ye sized up the ocean, and then he saw a black shadow swimming through it.

Obviously, it was probably something the woman in white was raiding.

Yang Ye gave Snowy Past Life, and she cracked a smile before shooting down into the ocean on it.

Yang Ye didn’t go with her. Because she wasn’t in any danger. So long as she had that sword, no living being in this world would dare to harm her. Actually, it was good enough if she didn’t harm any of them!

Snowy’s strength right now was truly too, too powerful against these living beings.

Yang Ye went over to the island. At the center of it was a unique house, and around the house were countless flowers, herbs, and fruits.

Yang Ye saw a small colorful bird before the house. The bird obstructed Yang Ye’s path and chirped, “Who are you?”

Yang Ye glanced at the bird and smiled, “A guest.”

The bird glared at Yang Ye, “Leave now! Or you might die once my master returns!”

Yang Ye smiled, “What’s your name?”

The bird replied angrily, “I’m Sakura! Leave now, human!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m a friend of your master’s!”

Sakura clearly didn’t believe him, “Prove it!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and stretched out his hand, and then a strand of Past Life Energy appeared.

Sakura was stunned upon seeing it and asked, “You’re really a friend of my master’s?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Sakura immediately started crying, “Where’s my master? Where has she gone? I don’t want to be alone here! That big sea monster isn’t fun at all! Sobs…”

Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t cry! I’ll take you outside later!”

Sakura looked up at Yang Ye, “Really?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Suddenly, the water surges up in the distance.

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly as he looked over, and there was a colossus swimming swiftly on the surface of the sea outside the island. It was so fast that it had created a whirlpool.

Yang Ye saw a familiar figure on the colossus’ head!

Snowy!

Yang Ye shook his head and felt speechless as he watched Snowy enjoy herself. The little fellow had clearly succeeded at subduing the huge underwater monster.

It made sense. After all, unless it was a demon beast at Erya’s level, practically no demon beast could resist the temptation that Snowy had on them!

Sakura gazed at Snowy with curiosity, “She isn’t afraid of the big sea monster!”

Yang Ye smiled and walked toward the house.

Meanwhile, Snowy held onto the sea monster with one paw while she withdrew a fruit with the other! It was a Chaotic Fruit!

Snowy sent it over to the sea monster’s mouth, and it immediately swallowed the fruit. At this moment, the sea monster worked even harder on swimming.

As soon as he entered the house, a white figure appeared before Yang Ye.

It was the woman in white, and she spoke softly, “You have to go to the border of the Four Dimensional Universe. Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu may be in danger because our strongest form’s clone has arrived in this world!”
