Chapter 2565

Along with the voice, a petite young girl appeared behind the Soul Exalt.

The woman had her hands behind her back, a calm expression on her face, and absolute indifference in her eyes!

The Soul Exalt turned around and gazed at her, and his eyes narrowed slightly, “What’s your name?”

She walked over to him, “Didn’t you want to kill me? I’m right here!”

The Soul Exalt looked at the girl before him, and then he suddenly raised his right hand and pressed it down lightly in her direction. In an instant, strands of powerful aura of the soul rippled out from his palm.

Moreover, two other black robed experts of the Soul Sect appeared not too far behind her!

They were the black robed experts who’d hunted Yang Ye that day!

At the instant the Soul Exalt attacked, they vanished on the spot.

Bang! Bang!

Two powerful aura of the soul swept out through space, and their target was the young girl!

The young girl just stood there with indifference on her face.

It didn’t take long for three auras to envelop her.

Bang!

A moment of silence ensued, and then an explosion resounded.

After that, the auras were obliterated while a ray of dark light rippled out through that expanse of space.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Horrifying sounds of something being torn apart resounded.

Space was torn open, inch by inch!

At this moment, the Soul Exalt and the others’ expressions changed drastically, and the dark light was already in front of them!

Rumble!

Along with three explosions, they were blasted away. All resistance was futile before that dark light!

It crushed everything!

The Soul Exalt stared at the young girl, “Who are you?!”

Terror!

At this moment, he felt slight terror.

She walked slowly in his direction, “Didn’t you want to kill me? Why don’t you try?”

A wisp of viciousness flashed through his eyes, and then his body exploded apart. Only his soul remained. In this state, his aura grew even more fearsome!

The Soul Exalt raised his right hand slightly and pressed it down in her direction.

Bang!

A powerful and towering soul palm crashed down from above!

The powerful might it emanated made it seem like the sky itself was collapsing! It was extremely shocking!

The young girl didn’t even look up. She just waved her hand casually, and a ray of dark light rippled out.

Bang!

The Soul Exalt and the others watched with astonishment as the palm was blasted into bits. Meanwhile, the Soul Exalt had transformed into a ray of powerful black light that shot at her.

Her face remained indifferent. She took a small step forward when it arrived before her, and a ray of mysterious dark light enveloped her body. As soon as the black light touched the dark light, it was like snow that instantly melted in hot oil.

She stretched out her right hand and made a clawing motion, and she instantly grabbed the Soul Exalt’s throat!

The surroundings fell silent! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The Soul Exalt had been utterly overpowered!

The Soul Exalt stared at the young girl, “Who the heck are you?!”

She didn’t answer him. She was just about to squeeze down when a ray of strange energy descended from the distant sky. She frowned slightly, and then her soul actually left her body. However, along with a ray of dark light that shot up into the air, her soul returned once more into her body. However, the Soul Exalt had fled over 1km away!

She ignored the Soul Exalt and looked up at the sky. A voice came slowly from there, “You’ve broken the rules!”

The rules!

In order to maintain some kind of balance, Eternal Kingdom prohibited some experts from fighting.

Obviously, her strength was sufficient to meet the standards of that restriction!

“The rules?” She laughed coldly, “You want to talk about the rules now?”

Meanwhile, a blurry black shadow appeared in the sky, and there was a pitch black awl floating by its side!

A Super Divine Treasure!

The Soul Exalt and the others hurriedly bowed respectfully upon seeing the blurry figure.

Obviously, it was the Soul Sect’s Master!

A short while passed before the Soul Sect’s Master spoke abruptly, “You’re from the other side!”

She gradually floated up into the air, and it didn’t take long for her to stand before him, “That isn’t important.”

The Soul Sect’s Master said, “Everyone agreed to the attack on the Ancient Sword Sect and supported it.”

Everyone!

The everyone here naturally represented all the peak experts of Eternal Kingdom.

The young girl laughed coldly, “So what? Why don’t all of you join forces and see if you can kill me?”

The Soul Sect’s Master fell silent!

Kill her!

If they joined forces, it was possible, it was definitely possible. But the problem was whether they would! Killing an expert like this would definitely result in them suffering severe injuries or even death!

It wouldn’t be that bad if they succeeded at killing her, but if they failed, then once an expert like this ignored the rules and acted willfully, then it would definitely bring chaos to Eternal Kingdom!

The Ancient Sword Sect had remained safe before this because it had such an expert, the previous sect master. So long as he remained alive, the powers of Eternal Kingdom and the Soul Sect wouldn’t dare to act rashly. A living expert at that level was an extraordinary threat. Once such an expert stopped abiding by the rules and hunted their disciples, how would they stop an expert like that?

So, the Soul Sect hadn’t touched the Ancient Sword Sect until now.

Once the previous sect master of the Ancient Sword Sect perished, the Soul Sect had nothing to fear anymore, and neither did the other powers in the area. All of them started to take action. However, they hadn’t expected an unexpected change in the situation like Yang Ye!

That wasn’t even the biggest problem, the biggest problem was this young girl!

Yet now, they had already launched the attack, so it was impossible for them to stop just because she wanted it!

A short while later, the Soul Exalt said, “How about we allow the younger generation to deal with these issues? We of the older generation will stay out of it. They will decide the outcome of this, alright?”

She remained silent.

The Soul Sect’s Master continued, “If you interfere and break the rules, it won’t be a good thing for you. Moreover, if both of us stop abiding by the rules, the Soul Sect will cease to exist, but the Ancient Sword Sect will vanish completely as well. What do you think?”

She fell silent for a short while and walked away. It didn’t take long for her to vanish from their vision, but her voice drifted over slowly, “If any of you interfere, then I guarantee that I’ll turn Eternal Kingdom upside down.”

A long period of silence filled the area. Suddenly, the Soul Sect’s Master waved his right hand slightly, and the black awl immediately descended beside the Soul Exalt.

The Soul Sect’s Master turned around and vanished into the sky.

The Soul Exalt was absolutely excited as he gazed at the black awl!

A Super Divine Treasure!

The Soul Awl!

It was one of the few Super Divine Treasures in Eternal Kingdom!

The Soul Sect’s Master’s intentions were absolutely clear!

…

The young girl went to the sky above the Ancient Sword Sect and looked at the sect down below, “Show yourself!”

A woman in a red dress appeared behind her.

She spoke indifferently, “You saw everything?”

The woman in a red dress nodded.

The young girl said, “There are some rules that I too must abide by. If I don’t, they won’t. At that time, even if I destroy the Soul Sect, he and the Ancient Sword Sect will be annihilated. I’ve made them abide by some rules again, but I too cannot interfere in the battle.”

The woman in a red dress replied softly, “That’s more than enough.”

The petite young girl fell silent for a long time and said, “I’m leaving for some time. I’ll leave him in your care.”

The woman in a red dress didn’t say anything in response.

The young girl added, “Don’t offend that young girl within him. She isn’t ordinary, and she has no ill intent toward him. Just that is enough.”

The woman in a red dress spoke solemnly, “Who’s that young girl?”

The petite young girl shook her head, “I don’t know. But she should be someone from the ancient times or even much earlier. Lately, I’ve noticed that the old geezers from years ago are gradually showing themselves! Chaotic times are upon us!”

As she spoke, she shot a glance down below and left.

It didn’t take long for her to vanish into the sky.

A long time later, the woman in a red dress left.

In the Ancient Sword Sect, everything remained normal!

At Yang Ye’s abode, in the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye was still cultivating. His body was at the Five World Realm, his cultivation was at the Five World Realm, and his Sword Domain had improved tremendously. It could be said that he was at his peak in every aspect!

His peak represented a bottleneck!

Now, he was truly at a bottleneck!

His body and cultivation were impossible to improve further for now. The only thing he could do was focus on cultivating his sword techniques, secret techniques, and control over his divine treasures!

Especially Executor!

90% of Executor was unsealed now. While its strength wasn’t at its greatest, it couldn’t be compared to the past either! Now, he had to truly grasp control over it and bring forth all its might!

Of course, besides cultivating, he had to do something else. It was to play with Qi Bitian!

Moreover, he would practice with his sword after every session with her… Because she would frequently give him some guidance!

He benefited tremendously from that!

Qi Bitian’s guidance truly allowed Yang Ye to benefit tremendously. Some of her insights and pointers were absolutely useful to me. Moreover, he was improving rapidly in all aspects under her guidance.

Most importantly, his outlook on things had been raised significantly because of her!

On this day, Yang Ye finished playing with her and went to practice with his sword…

Qi Bitian had just lost, she’d lost on purpose!

She felt that she’d won so many times and should take a loss. So, she intentionally exposed a few mistakes, and Yang Ye had naturally noticed them. So, he went along with it and won!

Once he won, Yang Ye roared with laughter like an overjoyed child!

Qi Bitian’s vanity was absolutely satisfied by this.

She was very happy!

Extremely happy!

When she saw Yang Ye training again, in her joy, Qi Bitian said, “Your flying swords and sword techniques are lagging behind a little. I’ll teach you a move. Wanna learn it?”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
