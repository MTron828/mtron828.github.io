Chapter 2699 – The Yang Clan!

Yang Ye went to the Past Life Clan.

The ruins were gradually returning to their former glory.

Yang Ye and the Past Life Clan’s patriarch strolled by the River of Past Life.

Both of them were silent.

A long time passed before Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t think too much about it. It was just a suggestion. I know the situation your clan is in, so don’t think too much about it and just refuse if you want. I don’t mind!”

The patriarch shook his head, “You’re mistaken.”

Yang Ye was quite puzzled.

The patriarch explained solemnly, “Two things. Firstly, if it’s possible, my clan would naturally choose your side. Because we owe you a debt, and we naturally should help if you need it. Besides that, this may be an opportunity for our clan, an opportunity to rise up again.”

He glanced at Yang Ye.

The young man before him was chosen. Simply speaking, Yang Ye may become the strongest expert of this world in the future. So, if he chose to help Yang Ye now, the Past Life Clan would have nothing to worry about if Yang Ye is victorious.

At the very least, the Past Life Clan would have powerful backing so long as Yang Ye was still alive.

Of course, there was risk too.

If Yang Ye lost and perished, the Past Life Clan would face eternal damnation too!

Yang Ye didn’t speak and just waited for the patriarch to continue.

The patriarch of the Past Life Clan fell silent for a short while before continuing, “We have three Destiny Realm experts, and all of them aren’t weak. If you need our help, all three of us will help you.”

Yang Ye nodded, “You can raise any conditions!”

The patriarch fell silent for a long time before he said, “If you win, I’ll do it then. Alright? Otherwise, whatever I say now is meaningless.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Alright!”

The patriarch grinned as well.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “I came here with Great Unknown’s teleportation ability, so the End World probably doesn’t know of my arrival here. It’s best if you don’t go outside for now. Don’t let them notice you!”

The Past Life Clan’s patriarch nodded, “We’ll stay well-hidden.”

Yang Ye nodded and vanished into the sky.

“You’re making a huge bet!” An elderly man appeared before the patriarch once Yang Ye left.

The patriarch glanced at the surroundings, “See everything around us? While we’ve emerged from hiding, let me be honest, how long do you think it’ll take for our clan to rise up again?”

The old man fell silent.

The patriarch shook his head, “We’ve suffered tremendous losses. While the Sprite Progenitor has restored some spirit energy for us, the quintessence of this world has been damaged. The spirit energy here is enough to sustain us for 10 years at most. Once that time is up, what would our clan do then? This place isn’t suitable for us to live in anymore! We must go outside. But let me be honest, there’s no place for us in the outside world. However, if we help him, we will have a place in the outside world!”

The old man shook his head, “It’s too risky!”

The patriarch grinned, “I know. However, there’s no reward without risk. If we want to rise up quickly, we have to rely on him or the End World.”

The old man asked, “Why don’t you choose the End World?”

The patriarch smiled, “He has Destiny’s support. Is that good enough for you?”

The old man fell silent for a long time and nodded, “It is!”

The patriarch looked up at outer space, “In the past, our ancestors chose to fight against Destiny, and the outcome was that our clan suffered eternally. I hope that we won’t suffer the same fate again this time!”

A huge bet!

The Past Life Clan had preserved its inheritance, but it was still dying slowly!

The resources of the world have been divided up already, and the Past Life Clan didn’t have the strength to fight for it.

So, perhaps they could find new life through this instead!

Once Yang Ye left, he immediately teleported to the Martial Sky World.

At the entrance to the tower, Yang Ye sat down with the ethereal man for a long time. In the end, the ethereal man said, “Are you confident?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Not at all. However, I want to find more help. I’ll be looking for others besides you.”

The ethereal man fell silent for a long time and said, “What is Destiny’s stand on this?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “She has none. Moreover, I’m not sure if they will help me in the end. Actually, I’ve only obtained the acknowledgement of two forms of Destiny, and as for the other two… One of them is very hostile to me, and I’ve never even met the last one!”

The ethereal man shook his head and smiled, “You’re really honest!”

Yang Ye smiled, “So, what do you think?”

The ethereal man fell silent for a long time before he asked, “The Past Life Clan has agreed, right?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The ethereal man nodded slightly, “I see. Just like them, my Martial Sky Clan will have a request if we win.”

Yang Ye stood up and was about to leave. But he stopped a moment later and said, “Will your requests put me in a difficult position?”

The ethereal man shook his head.

Yang Ye smiled, “I understand. From this moment onward, contact me if your clan needs anything.”

The man smiled, “I just happen to need your help with something. No, I need the Good Sprite’s help!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright!”

Yang Ye followed the man to a huge altar, and on it was a head!

Yang Ye asked, “What is this?”

The ethereal man replied softly, “A former ancestor of my clan. Don’t worry, he wasn’t killed by Destiny. Destiny opened that door for him, and he went in. After that…”

Yang Ye asked, “He didn’t die?”

The man shook his head, “Half dead, but not alive anymore. His body was completely destroyed, and only his head remained. My clan has remade a new body for him, but I need spirit energy, and it has to be special spirit energy.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “I sense Polaris Energy in the Good Sprite. Coupled with her own special profound energy, I’m sure that it’ll be enough to revive this ancestor of mine.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and summoned Snowy.

Yang Ye pointed at the altar, and Snowy nodded before exhaling lightly. In an instant, countless strands of spirit energy surged into the altar.

The altar gradually started to tremble. Meanwhile, the ethereal man placed a headless body on the altar.

As more and more spirit energy surged into it, the body and head on the altar started to merge. At the same time, the ethereal man just floated into the altar.

Yang Ye was quite surprised.

It didn’t take long for quite a weird expression to appear on his face.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The ethereal man was a soul, and that head and body…

Yang Ye was still quite stunned.

Yang Ye didn’t tell Snowy to stop, and he just allowed her to continue sending out spirit energy. Around two hours later, the body and head on the altar had fused completely. At the same time, Snowy’s Polaris Energy and her own unique profound energy coiled around the man.

Around 15 minutes later, the man slowly opened his eyes.

Snowy stopped.

The man gradually opened his eyes completely, and a long time passed before he spoke softly, “I’m still not very used to it, but it’s fine.”

He gazed at Yang Ye, “Thank you!”

Yang Ye glanced at the man, and the latter smiled, “I have just my soul, and when my ancestor survived all those years ago, his soul was incomplete. So, that is why I dared to merge with him. It actually goes against certain laws, and the side effects are serious. However, with the help of the Good Sprite and the fact that she possesses Polaris Energy, it can be said that the side effects have been brought down to a minimum. That’s why I dared to do this.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “I see.”

The man grinned, “You have the Good Sprite, so what you wear and use are the best in the world. I really don’t have anything to thank you with. However, now that I’ve merged with the remnants of my ancestor’s soul and body, I may be quite strong in battle.”

Yang Ye smiled, “That’s more than enough.”

The man chuckled and said, “Right, it has been so long, but I still haven’t introduced myself. I’m Yan Wu, the current patriarch of the Martial Sky Clan.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Until we meet again, Brother Yan Wu.”

Yang Ye was about to leave once he finished speaking, but Yan Wu suddenly said, “You can make a trip to the Yang Clan!”

Yang Ye gazed at Yan Wu and was quite puzzled, “The Yang Clan?”

Yan Wu nodded slightly, “They had quite a good relationship with my clan in the past, so we have many records on them. They aren’t ordinary. Even though they still fell into decline in the end, I refuse to believe they’ve vanished from this world. So, you can try. If their people are still alive, you can try roping them over to your side. Conversely, you don’t lose anything if they are gone!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and asked, “Do you know how to get there?”

Yan Wu smiled, “I just happen to know that!”

He flicked a ray of white light into Yang Ye’s forehead, and then a pathway appeared in Yang Ye’s mind.

Yang Ye cupped his fist a short while later, “Farewell!”

Yang Ye vanished into the distant sky.

Once Yang Ye left, an old man appeared by Yan Wu’s side.

Yan Wu spoke softly, “The Past Life Clan’s patriarch is very charismatic.”

The old man nodded slightly, “The End World isn’t ordinary either. They are planning something big.”

Yan Wu closed his eyes slowly, “I know. If they don’t have some skill, how could they dare to target Destiny? The Destiny who once domineered over countless eras!”

…

Two hours later, Yang Ye arrived at a completely new world.

It was the world where the Yang Clan once lived. It was named after them as well, it was the Yang World.

As soon as Yang Ye arrived here, he suddenly frowned because his bloodline actually started trembling for no reason!
