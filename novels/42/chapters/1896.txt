Chapter 1897 – Northern Sky Prefecture!

The woman’s face was covered in a smile. A confident smiled, a smile that felt like she had everything under her control.

For some reason, it absolutely displeased Yang Ye.

Since he was displeased, he discarded his decision to make a compromise and put an end to future troubles.

Everyone watched as the aura arrived before them, and it was accompanied by a young man.

The young man seemed to be around the age of 27 or 28. He wore an embroidered robe, had sharp brows, large eyes, and seemed very handsome.

Of course, he was extremely strong too. He was at the Enlightened Realm at such a young age, and his aura was deep like an ocean. It was extremely heavy to others.

The man’s gaze immediately fell onto Nansi Yin. At this moment, his expression became gentle, and there even was a slight smile on his face, “Siyin, you should have told me that you were coming here!”

She frowned slightly, “Gong Jin, what are you doing here? Oh, it’s obvious that carefree brother of mine told you, so that you can come rescue the beauty, right?”

The man was rather embarrassed. He smiled with embarrassment, and then he gazed at Yang Ye. While he was still smiling when he gazed at Yang Ye, it wasn’t the same smile anymore.

It was a ridiculing one!

The man called Gong Jin smiled, “You’re the one who wants her to be his maidservant?”

Yang Ye ignored the man and gazed at Nansi Yin, “What…”

Nansi Yin shrugged and interrupted Yang Ye, “I’m not going back on my word. I’m still your maidservant. Of course, if you die, or something happens to you, then it’s not my fault, right? You…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Nansi Yin when he appeared again. Her expression changed drastically, and she clawed at him.

However, Yang Ye was even faster, and his hand instantly wrapped around her throat. There was a golden spear behind Yang Ye, and it was just a few centimeters away from Yang Ye’s back. The man in embroidered clothes was behind the spear.

He’d attacked as soon as Yang Ye Had. However, he’d been slightly slower.

Yang Ye ignored the man, and he squeezed down slightly and lifted her up, “I don’t like being interrupted. Understand?”

She stared at him and remained silent.

Suddenly, Yang Ye squeezed down further, causing her face to turn purple.

“How dare you!” Suddenly, Gong Jin roared angrily, “Do you know who she is? If you dare to harm a single hair on her, everyone related to you will be annihilated!”

Yang Ye suddenly gazed at Gong Jin, “I’m so afraid!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he raised Nansi Yin even higher up.

Gong Jin’s face grew terrifyingly gloomy, but he didn’t dare to do anything.

Yang Ye gazed at Nansi Yin, “Did you understand what I just said?”

She still gazed silently at Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye tightened his grip.

Nansi Yin instantly felt suffocated!

A trace of panic flashed through Gong Jin’s eyes at this point. He knew that if she died here, it would be a serious problem, and even he would probably have to suffer.

The old man frowned as well. Because if she died, even the Floating Sect would be in quite a bit of trouble. He hesitated for a moment and said, “Young Brother, don’t be rash. There’s no irreconcilable enmity between you, so it really isn’t necessary to go this far!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Senior, you’re right. It was a small matter. Unfortunately, I hate it when people act all high and mighty. They think their status is special, so they can bully and look down on everyone else.”

He gazed at Nansi Yin and continued, “I’ll ask you one last time. Did you hear me or not? If you didn’t, then trust me, your head is going to get separated from your body!”

He hadn’t intended to get entangled with her, but she didn’t just take a yard when given an inch, she even threatened him. That infuriated Yang Ye. Face was something that was given mutually. If you give me some, I will give you some too; if you don’t give me any, then why would I give you any?

Nansi Yin stared at Yang Ye. At this moment, she knew that the man before her wasn’t lying, and he really did dare to kill her!

He dared to kill her!

She had no proof, and it was just a feeling!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and his grip grew even tighter.

Nansi Yin suddenly said, “I did! I heard you!”

Gong Jin and the old man seemed visibly relieved when they witnessed this. They were afraid Nansi Yin would resist until the end and the situation would go out of hand.

Yang Ye released her and slapped her lightly on the face, “Remember that since you’re a maidservant, you should act like one.”

Suddenly, a speck of golden light appeared behind Yang Ye.

Gong Jin had attacked.

However, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was behind Gong Jin when he appeared again. After that, a sword descended upon Gong Jin.

Gong Jin’s expression changed. However, his reaction wasn’t slow at all. He turned around and raised his spear. At the same time, he clenched his left fist and was ready to attack once he stopped Yang Ye’s attack.

However…

Bang!

Gong Jin was blasted over 10km away.

Nansi Yin gazed at Yang Ye with disbelief. She hadn’t expected Yang Ye to repel Gong Jin with such ease. There was a trace of surprise in the old man’s eyes as well because Yang Ye’s strength far exceeded their expectations.

Gong Jin glanced at his spear. It had cracked open, and even his hand had cracked open.

He suppressed the shock in his heart and looked up at Yang Ye, “Who are you?!”

Yang Ye ignored Gong Jin. He turned to look at the old man from the Floating Sect, “Senior, thank you for your help. I have other matters to attend to, so I’ll be taking my leave.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The old man glanced at Yang Ye, “Farewell!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, and then he gazed at Zhi’er’s foster parents. He hesitated for a moment and said, “Your good deed should be repaid with kindness.” He flicked a spatial ring to them.

He’d gotten that from one of the people he’d killed. He didn’t need the treasures within it, but they were definitely great treasures for the young man and woman.

The young man cupped his fist to Yang Ye while a trace of excitement could be seen in his eyes, “Thank you!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he gazed at Nansi Yin, “You’re free now!”

He vanished into the sky once he finished speaking.

Nansi Yin fell silent for a moment, and then she suddenly looked up in the direction Yang Ye had vanished towards, “You think you can just escape? No way!”

As soon as she finished speaking, a ray of multicolored light appeared below her feet, and then a rainbow appeared in the sky.

“Siyin!” Gong Jin was shocked and intended to chase after her.

However, the old man suddenly said, “If you want to save her, it’s best if you notify her family.”

Gong Jin gazed at the old man, and the latter added, “Since he possesses such strength and courage at his age, he's definitely not ordinary. Not only will chasing after them change nothing, it might infuriate him and make him kill you.”

Gong Jin’s expression changed. In the end, he didn’t chase after them and withdrew a rock instead.

The old man withdrew his gaze and looked at Zhi’er’s foster parents, “From now on, you’re not inner court disciples anymore!”

Both of them were shocked.

Meanwhile, the old man added, “From now on, you’re Elite Disciples!”

They were stunned for a moment, and then wild joy filled their hearts.

…

Yang Ye shot swiftly through the sky on his sword. Suddenly, he stopped and turned around. Nansi Yin was behind him.

Yang Ye glanced at her, “What?”

Nansi Yin smiled, “Don’t forget that I’m your maidservant!”

Yang Ye asked, “You’re that desperate to die?”

Nansi Yin walked over to him, “People should always keep their word. Since I, Nansi Yin, dared to make that bet with you, I’ll naturally keep my promise. So, I’m your maidservant from now on.”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Where’s Broken Cliff Mountain?” At this moment, he recalled that he didn’t know where it was.

“Broken Cliff Mountain!” Nansi Yin was slightly stunned, and then her eyes lit up, “You’re going to the Shaman Dimension?”

Yang Ye frowned, “Mind your own business.”

Nansi Yin smiled, “Fine. But you’re going to Broken Cliff Mountain. Right, er… I just happen to be going there too. Let’s go together! I can lead the way!”

Yang Ye naturally didn’t want to let her come with him. Because her background wasn’t ordinary at all. If she stayed with him, his troubles would be endless. While he didn’t fear it, he didn’t want more trouble to come looking for him. The important matter at hand for him was to go to the Sky Dimension.

Suddenly, Nansi Yin added, “In order to get to Broken Cliff Mountain, you must pass through one of the four prefectures in the Human Dimension, the Northern Sky Prefecture, but it’s guarded by extraordinarily strong experts. Normal people aren’t able to get there at all, but I can!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Hou Qing’s voice suddenly resounded in his mind, “She’s not wrong. Northern Sky Prefecture is guarded by the Northern Sky King. No one can enter Broken Cliff Mountain without the Sovereign of Man’s approval. I snuck over, but your current strength is utterly incapable of accomplishing that.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a while, and then he gazed at Nansi Yin, “You really can?”

Nansi Yin smiled, “Of course!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Then I’ll go with you. Right, it’s best if you don’t tell your clansmen to come for you.”

She smiled, “Why? You’re afraid?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and spoke indifferently, “I’m afraid… I’m afraid I might kill them by accident!”
