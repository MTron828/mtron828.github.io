Chapter 2777 – The Battle Breaks Out!

Tian Xiu gazed coldly at the mysterious expert, and then she vanished on the spot.

The mysterious expert pressed his right palm forward.

Bang!

Space shook violently, and then Tian Xiu was back where she’d been a moment ago.

She looked down at her palm, and it was covered in cracks.

Tian Xiu gazed at the mysterious expert, and then she vanished again.

Meanwhile, Qi Bitian vanished as well.

She shot up into the air, but it only took a moment for a mysterious flame to soundlessly appear.

A vicious glow flashed through her eyes. Her right hand formed into a claw as she swiped upward.

Sky Claw!

The flame instantly exploded apart, and the area turned into an ocean of flames. In the ocean, a huge fire serpent kept slamming itself at Qi Bitian.

However, Omni Phantom was blasted away repeatedly!

Shu Wubian spoke coldly, “The Omni Phantom is no match for her! Let’s attack together!”

As soon as she said that, Zuo Mu and the others charged up into the air!

They were ganging up on her!

Just like that, Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu were kept busy.

During this time, Tian Xiu had wanted to charge off on many occasions, but the mysterious expert kept stopping her.

At this moment, even Tian Xiu was furious.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The battle grew increasingly intense.

Meanwhile, Tu and Yang Busi were still fighting, and they had been fighting for a long time now.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Meanwhile, a few mysterious auras were watching them from afar.

While they sensed those auras, the two of them ignored the auras. They were in the heat of the battle!

…

Once he left Erya, Yang Ye swiftly returned to An Nanjing.

Fortunately, nothing had occurred.

An Nanjing spoke softly, “It’s too quiet!”

Yang Ye nodded, “The quieter it is, the more unusual it is.”

An Nanjing looked off into the distance, “Something big might be about to happen.”

Yang Ye nodded. He was about to speak when ripples came from afar.

Yang Ye frowned slightly and tightened his grip on his sword sheath.

A moment later, they watched as four huge beasts appeared from that point in space.

Pantheras!

There were around 12 experts with pikes on the four beasts. All of them were huge like giants.

A shadow led the group!

A shadow whose appearance was indiscernible!

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Their leader is here!”

An Nanjing nodded.

A moment later, the shadow stopped around 300m away from them, and the four beasts stared at Yang Ye and An Nanjing ferociously.

Yang Ye glanced at the beasts for a moment before moving his gaze to the shadow, “What should I call you?”

The shadow shook its head, “That isn’t important. Yang Ye, do you realize the situation you’re in?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I do.”

The shadow said, “You aren’t my target. If both of you leave, we won’t stop you. That’s my display of sincerity to you.”

Yang Ye smiled, “If you leave, the two of us won’t stop you too. What do you think?”

The shadow shook its head slightly, “Looks like we’re at an impasse.”

As soon as he said that, one of the beasts pounced at Yang Ye and An Nanjing.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. The beast’s physical strength was terrifying, and perhaps only Erya could truly suppress it!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, exchanged glances with An Nanjing, and then they vanished on the spot.

Bang!

The Panthera was blasted away.

Suddenly, the shadow vanished on the spot. Yang Ye swiftly drew his sword while An Nanjing stabbed her spear forward.

Meanwhile, the shadow was in front of them. There were two strange black vortices in his palms, and these vortices instantly expanded and exploded upon coming into contact with An Nanjing’s spear.

Boom!

An Nanjing and Yang Ye were pushed backward repeatedly. And as soon as they stopped themselves, around a dozen pikes tore through space and rained down upon them.

Yang Ye drew his sword and swung it repeatedly!

Meanwhile, An Nanjing waved her spear. A moment later, the pikes before them had been knocked away. However, the shadow appeared before them again.

As for those four beasts, they’d gone off in the Three Dimensional Universe’s direction.

Obviously, the shadow was trying to keep Yang Ye and An Nanjing busy here.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing had realized the shadow’s intentions. So, they didn’t allow themselves to get caught in battle here and retreated as they fought.

Those beasts were extremely formidable, so Universe City wouldn’t be able to resist them without Yang Ye and An Nanjing.

Universe City.

Ding Shaoyao led a group out into the sky. At this moment, the space there was trembling, and a wave of invisible pressure was rippling down from above.

The trembling in space gradually started to grow intense.

Meanwhile, Ding Shaoyao gazed at the old man, Chen Dao’zi, who was by her side.

Chen Dao’zi nodded slightly, “It’s ready!”

Ding Shaoyao nodded, “Prepare yourselves!”

All of them stared at that point in space.

They knew that this was their real first battle, and it may be their last.

No one wanted to die, but they had no choice but to fight at a time like this!

They had no way out of this.

A short while later, the space there cracked open, and then a colossus emerged from it!

A Panthera!

Moreover, there were three more behind it!

In an instant, four Pantheras appeared in the sky above the city.

The Pantheras looked down below, and then they dived down at the city.

Based on their strength, Universe City would be instantly obliterated if they were allowed to enter the city.

Chen Dao’zi suddenly raised his right hand and lowered it gently.

Bang!

Suddenly, a huge pillar of light surged up into the air from within the city. The beast that led the charge was instantly blasted far away!

Everyone heaved sighs of relief when they witnessed this!

It worked!

A moment later, another pillar of light surged up from Universe City. The second Panthera was clearly prepared and slammed its claws at the pillar!

Bang!

The entire pillar of light shook violently, but the Panthera was blasted away!

Pillar after pillar of light surged up into the air from within the city…

Bang! Bang!

The other two Pantheras were blasted away as well.

In an instant, all four of them had been pushed back!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye and An Nanjing were still in battle in outer space, and the battle was growing increasingly intense!

While both of them were formidable, they were up against the joint forces of around a dozen Demon Guards and the shadow!

Especially the shadow. Its strength far surpassed Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s expectations.

In the city, a black clothed figure suddenly appeared before Ding Shaoyao. It whispered a few words to her and moved aside.

Ding Shaoyao pondered deeply for a moment and looked up, “They are fighting out there. Destiny Realm experts, come with me!”

She vanished into the sky.

Jian Wudi and the others didn’t hesitate to shoot up into the air!

A short while later, all the Destiny Realm experts in the city had vanished.

In the starry sky.

Boom! Boom!

Along with two explosions, An Nanjing and Yang Ye were pushed back repeatedly. But just a moment later, Yang Ye charged forward and swung his sword, and An Nanjing was by his side!

A moment later, a ray of sword energy and a spear image appeared here.

Boom!

The shadow was pushed around 300m back. Meanwhile, a black sword suddenly shot through the throat of a Demon Guard!

Hiss!

That expert’s head instantly shot up into the air!

Blood sprayed!

The others were shocked by the sight of this and retreated to the shadow’s side.

At this moment, they noticed to their shock that if they didn’t have the shadow to keep Yang Ye and An Nanjing busy, they may be annihilated in an instant!

The shadow suddenly said, “That flying sword of yours is quite extraordinary.”

He suddenly raised his right hand once he finished speaking.

Bang!

A pitch black fist suddenly descended from above Yang Ye and An Nanjing.

At the same time, the shadow vanished on the spot.

An Nanjing shot up into the air while Yang Ye dashed forward and swung his sword.

Hiss!

Space was sliced open before his sword!

However, two black hands clamped down onto his sword!

Swish!

Countless strands of sword energy and sword energy swept out of Yang Ye!

The Sword Domain Sphere!

At the instant Yang Ye activated the Sword Domain Sphere, the shadow shuddered and turned ethereal.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed and swiftly swung a horizontal slash.

Meanwhile, a palm passed through his defenses and struck his chest.

Bam!

An explosion resounded, and Yang Ye was pushed backward repeatedly. However, the black hand before his chest was still there, and it was ceaselessly destroying his body!

At this moment, Yang Ye decisively released his sword and slammed both his hands forward.

Bang!

An afterimage flashed backward repeatedly!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye stopped, and two streams of blood seeped out from the corners of his mouth.

The shadow was about to attack again when a few dozen auras shot up from below, and then around 30 experts appeared behind Yang Ye and An Nanjing.

It was Jian Wudi and the others!

Both sides were in confrontation!
