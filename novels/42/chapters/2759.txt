Chapter 2760 – Be a Little Shameless!

They seemed like they were facing a formidable enemy because this woman’s appearance was exactly similar to the woman they’d just met high above in the sky!

They looked exactly the same!

While all of them seemed like they were facing a formidable enemy, Snowy’s eyes lit up, and then she flew over to the woman in white.

The expressions of everyone here changed drastically. They were about to stop Snowy when An Nanjing shook her head. While they were quite hesitant, they didn’t do anything in the end.

Snowy arrived before the woman and waved her paws swiftly. She naturally had a good impression of the woman in white. Because the woman had helped her and Yang Ye quite a bit.

The woman grinned, rubbed Snowy’s head, and asked, “Where is he?”

Snowy cracked a smile and pointed to the right.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye appeared here.

Yang Ye grinned at the sight of her, “Long time no see!”

As soon as he said that, a sword flew out from him and went to her.

Past Life!

The woman before them was the form of Destiny who wore a white dress!

She grinned and said, “Let’s go somewhere else!”

As soon as she said that, she waved her right hand and then she vanished on the spot with Yang Ye, Snowy, and Erya.

The others exchanged glances. Destiny! That woman from before was Destiny!

Just the thought of it made many of them break out in cold sweat!

Outside Universe City.

Yang Ye and the woman walked side by side while Erya followed at the side. Snowy was seated on Erya’s shoulder, and the two little fellows were frequently looking at Yang Ye and the woman in white.

The woman in white spoke softly, “You didn’t disappoint me!”

Yang Ye remained silent.

She continued, “I know about the order you’ve created. It’s pretty good.”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Can you help me?”

The woman nodded, “I can!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she grinned, “You know… the three of us can’t really see through her!”

Yang Ye frowned, “What do you mean?”

The woman in white shook her head slightly, “Her gaze is too far ahead, and her thoughts are too far ahead as well. As for her ambition, it’s huge, unprecedentedly huge. But we don’t know what she’s planning.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “We can’t go against her because if we meet, then she can merge with us as long as she wills it. But we cannot resist her because she is the main body.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “I don’t want to see that happen.”

The woman in white smiled, “I don’t agree with some of her actions. As for you, I’m really proud of you. Because you dared to say no to her and disagree with her. Of course, if you tried to curry favor with her, you may have died even sooner.”

Yang Ye smiled and didn’t say anything.

Meanwhile, Snowy flew over to Yang Ye’s shoulder, pointed at the woman, and then waved her paws lightly.

Yang Ye gradually frowned and gazed at the woman, “You’re injured?”

She nodded, “I am.”

She glanced at Snowy and smiled, “Little fellow, you’re really amazing!”

Snowy blinked, and then she waved her paws to say something.

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “How did you get injured?”

The woman pointed upward.

Yang Ye immediately understood.

The woman in white added, “I came because I wanted to ask you for my sword. I’m at quite a disadvantage without a sword, and you seem to have found your own sword now. So, Past Life isn’t very helpful to you anymore.”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Do you need my help?”

She shook her head, “Protect this place well. We’ll help you stop the relatively stronger fellows out there.”

Yang Ye asked, “Aren’t you afraid of annoying her?”

The woman in white smiled, “We aren’t. In any case, we’re all the same person. Even though we have independent thoughts right now, we are still the same person.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “If only she was as easy to talk to as you are!”

The woman in white shook her head and smiled as she shot a glance at outer space, “She destroyed the barrier she set up all those years ago. If I’m not wrong, what she seeks is almost in her grasp. Of course, the important matter at hand for you is to face those existences from the Four Dimensional Universe.”Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Yang Ye asked, “Can you tell me about them in detail?”

He didn’t know much about the Four Dimensional Universe. All he did know was that it was a universe superior to the Three Dimensional Universe.

The woman in white pondered deeply for a moment and said, “The living beings of the Four Dimensional Universe are actually… greater than the living beings of the Three Dimensional Universe. They evolved earlier than us, and their overall strength is naturally stronger than ours. However, my complete form entered that universe in the past, and I killed many, many experts in that universe. Later on, I split myself into four because I was a little too strong. So, unless I left the Three Dimensional Universe completely, my main body would be enough to destroy the Three Dimensional Universe.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why didn’t you leave?”

She looked up and said, “I don’t know either!”

Yang Ye frowned, “Impossible…”

She replied softly, “Our strongest form is up to something, and it’s something that made her willing to split herself into order to weaken herself. Moreover, if I’m not wrong, she should have sealed off some key memories within the rest of us.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “What does he want?”

The woman in white shook her head, “I can’t see through her either. All those years ago, even the Three Dimensional Universe couldn’t stop my peak state, yet she stopped!”

She gazed at Yang Ye, “No matter what she’s planning, I think it should be done soon.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “I just happen to have run straight into it.”

The woman in white patted Yang Ye on the shoulder, “Remember what I told you. Our merged form is our strongest form, but she’s still strong even if we don’t merge. Because she has been cultivating for countless years, and I’m afraid she has cultivated to…”

She suddenly stopped at this moment.

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “What?”

The woman in white shook her head, “If she has really cultivated to that extent… In other words, the same level my main body once attained. What I’m trying to say is that she may have already attained the same level of strength that my merged form had!”

Yang Ye’s face became solemn upon hearing this.

If that was true… She was truly too terrifying. Moreover, if she merged all four forms into one in the future, then how abnormally powerful would she be once she’d converged their strength?

Just thinking about it caused a chill to run down Yang Ye’s spine.

She glanced at Yang Ye and smiled, “Are you afraid?”

Yang Ye nodded, “A little!”

She smiled.

She was drop dead gorgeous, and this smile was something that even slightly dazed someone like Yang Ye.

Luckily, it didn’t take long for him to recover, and there was only respect in his eyes when he gazed at her again.

She spoke softly, “Let’s get back on topic. We call the living beings in the Four Dimensional Universe as Outside Demons. Of course, we are probably demons to them too. The Four Dimensional Universe has already been united by a formidable clan, and besides that clan, there are no other clans throughout that universe. All those years ago, our strongest form practically stopped all of them on her own!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “On her own?”

The woman in white nodded, “She fought the master of the Four Dimensional Universe, and she won. After that, the latter didn’t dare to step foot out of the Four Dimensional Universe again. Because that fellow could only fight our strongest form by relying on the strength of the entire Four Dimensional Universe. But once that fellow leaves the Four Dimensional Universe, he would be no match for our strongest form. As for our strongest form, she could have attacked them, but she didn’t!”

The woman in white gazed at Yang Ye at this point, “Her plans don’t just include the Three Dimensional Universe, and…”

The woman’s expression suddenly changed at this point, and she looked up. A moment later, she transformed into a tray of light that shot up into the sky.

Yang Ye hurriedly follows after her.

Snowy wanted to do the same, but Erya grabbed Snowy in her arms. Erya puckered her lips, “Snowy, stop putting yourself in danger. Learn to be a little shameless!”

Snowy was speechless.

In the sky, the woman shot toward outer space on her sword, and Yang Ye was following closely behind her. However, a moment later, her voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Don’t come with me!”

As soon as she said that, a sword shot through the distant sky!

Justice!

The sword was like a shooting star, and the stars throughout the universe dulled before it!

Yang Ye’s face instantly turned gloomy from the sight of this because Justice was aimed at the woman in white.

Meanwhile, she stopped, and then she tapped her right hand forward. Past Life shot forward like a bolt of lightning.

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and then Past Life was instantly blasted away. Meanwhile, Justice didn’t slow down at all as it shot toward the woman in white!

She waved her right hand, and Past Life appeared in her grasp again. But this time, Past Life trembled violently and was covered in cracks.

The woman just silently gazes at Justice with indifference.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was about to attack when she shook her head to stop him.

Just like that, Yang Ye watched as Justice came closer and closer to her. Meanwhile, she suddenly pressed her sword against her forehead, and then she stabbed forward.

It was a very ordinary stab, but it carried the strength to destroy the world!

Even Yang Ye, someone who’d attained the Quasi Ordinary Sword, shuddered slightly before it!

However, Justice suddenly stopped at this moment.

A moment later, the woman’s pupils constricted.

Hiss!

Justice shot through the woman’s chest!

A strand of blood sprayed into the air.
