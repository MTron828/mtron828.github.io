Chapter 1585 - Ganging Up Is The Way!

Translator: InVader

Meanwhile, Little Sky was 3km away.

Even though she was holding a ball of flames in her grasp, she didn’t want to let the dragon slam its body on her. After all, it would definitely not be pleasant.

Yang Ye slowly clenched his right fist and was about to attack. However, a strand of mysterious energy suddenly descended upon the huge golden dragon.

Boom!

The dragon was slammed to the ground.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief because that mysterious treasure within the Primordial Pagoda had finally acted.

But why didn’t it do so sooner?Was it playing a joke on me?

Yang Ye shook his head and stopped thinking about it. All that mattered was that it had helped.

The huge golden dragon raised its head and looked towards the surroundings. There was a puzzled expression in its eyes. Obviously, it still hadn’t figured out what had just happened.

Meanwhile, another wave of force slammed down on it.

Boom!

The dragon howled with pain, and then its body started to tremble violently. It didn’t take long for numerous waves of mysterious energy to slam down incessantly upon it.

The huge golden dragon’s body gradually started to crack apart.

Suddenly, Little Sky appeared in front of the dragon, and she waved her hand towards the sky, “Wait a moment!”

As soon as she spoke, the mysterious energy stopped descending.

Yang Ye glanced at her. It actually listened to her!

Little Sky walked over to the golden dragon. She sized it up and spoke softly, “I understand now.”

Yang Ye asked, “What?”

She spoke softly, “I understand why such an expert would submit to her. It turns out that this big fellow’s memories have been erased.”

“Erased?” Yang Ye frowned, “What do you mean?”

Little Sky rolled her eyes at Yang Ye, “What a fool. It means that woman used some sort of force to erase his memories. Simply speaking, it doesn’t possess its past memories. Moreover, its mind has become like the mind of a child. That’s why this big fellow is willing to obey her.’ Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Little Sky shook her head, “This big fellow is really quite pitiable!”

Yang Ye nodded. Would one still be oneself without one’s memories? Strictly speaking, it wasn’t the same person anymore! The huge golden dragon was definitely an extraordinary expert, yet he’d suffered such a fate. So, he really was quite pitiable.

Meanwhile, Little Sky said, “That woman is really quite skilled.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Forget about her. Ask that big fellow if he’s willing to follow me. If he refuses, then let him suffer a little longer.”

Little Sky glared at Yang Ye, “You’re so cruel!”

Yang Ye rolled his eyes at her, “Who was the one who burned it just now?”

Little Sky blushed slightly. She grunted coldly, and then gazed at the golden dragon, “It was definitely not easy for you to attain your current cultivation, so go with him for three years. Just three years and you’ll be free again. Moreover, I may be able to recover your memories!”

“Recover its memories?” Yang Ye frowned, “It can be recovered?”

“Of course!” Little Sky explained, “Its memories were erased, but that’s only on the surface. There’s a thing called a Memory Seed, and it’s the source of all our memories. So long as that thing isn’t destroyed, our memories can be recovered. I took a look just now. That woman didn’t go too far because its Memory Seed is still intact. So, its memories can be recovered. Moreover, even if we don’t help it, it may be able to recover its memories on its own after some time.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’ll leave it to you. Help me persuade it. I don’t want to use force. I prefer to win others over with virtue.”

“Tsk! Tsk!” Little Sky sized him up, “Your skin is getting thicker.”

Yang Ye glared at her and vanished on the spot.

In the world outside.

Yang Ye had just opened his eyes when the others appeared in front of him, “Where did that big fellow go?”

Yang Ye naturally understood who they were talking about, and he shrugged, “It’s a secret.”

The pig riding young woman raised her brows, “You can’t tell us?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Only my women get to know. Do you want to know the answer?”

Bang!

She suddenly punched Yang Ye’s stomach, and he was blasted over 10m away.

Yang Ye glared at her, “I was just joking! How could you really hit me!”

She shrugged, “Your skin is so thick, a punch won’t make you pregnant. So, what are you worried about?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, Boundary Maiden walked over, “Don’t waste time. Let’s go help Second Sister and Third Sister!”

The pig riding young woman nodded solemnly when she heard this, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “Can you still fight?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I need some time.” He was about to suffer the backlash from his sword intent. Moreover, his profound energy was almost completely exhausted. His lack of profound energy wasn’t a huge problem, but he had to treat the backlash from his sword intent seriously.

The pig riding young woman nodded, “Be careful!” As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished on the spot with Boundary Maiden and Light Maiden.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

It didn’t take long for him to suffer backlash from his sword intent.

Fortunately, he was quite immune to it now. So, it didn’t really hurt. Moreover, Yang Ye was pleasantly surprised to notice that after he suffered backlash over and over again, his sword intent seemed to be growing stronger and stronger. It was like tempering metal. After a piece of metal was struck incessantly, its quality would naturally improve progressively.

After suffering backlash over and over again, will my sword intent attain the Returnal Rank? Such a thought had appeared in Yang Ye’s mind.

Time trickled by. Two hours later, Yang Ye had recovered completely, and he went to the 1st level of the Primordial Pagoda.

The scene he witnessed next almost made his jaw hit the floor. Because he saw Little Sky. Of course, that wasn’t the main point. The main point was the huge golden dragon head beneath her feet. At this moment, he was carrying her and flying around everywhere.

Little Sky waved at Yang Ye and smiled, “Hurry up here and play with me!”

Yang Ye glanced at her, and then he glanced at the dragon before shaking his head. If the Heavenly Dragon Clan were to find out that their past patriarch is being stood on like that, I wonder if they would get so angry as to swarm her?

No matter what, it seemed like Little Sky had succeeded at subduing the golden dragon.

Yang Ye didn’t waste time in the Primordial Pagoda, and he left it immediately.

In the outside world.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and was about to leave. However, the space ahead suddenly darkened, and then countless red threads crisscrossed there. After the red threads appeared, Yang Ye noticed that this spatial battlefield had been instantly sliced open.

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly, and he hurriedly flew over to that area.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to stop. He saw Blind Maiden in the shattered spatial battlefield. Her opponent was the man with a spear on his back. Besides that, the one-armed man with a saber wasn’t very far away from the man with a spear.

Besides that, the pig riding young woman, Light Maiden, and Boundary Maiden were here too.

At this moment, the man’s spear was pointed downwards at an angle, and a strand of faint aura suffused him.

The space here was on the verge of collapse.

Suddenly, the one-armed man gazed at Yang Ye, “She’s dead?”

Yang Ye glanced at him and nodded, “She is.”

The one-armed man asked, “You kill her?”

Yang Ye replied with a question, “Who else?”

The one-armed man fell silent for a long time, and then he started walking slowly in Yang Ye’s direction. A moment later, he vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Yang Ye when his figure appeared once more. After that, a ray of cold light shot towards Yang Ye’s throat.

It was absolutely swift!

Yang Ye had drawn his sword and swung it at the exact same moment that the one-armed man attacked.

Clang!

Their weapons separated upon coming into contact. Yang Ye was blasted almost 1km away while the one-armed man was similarly pushed back. However, he’d stopped after being pushed just 100m back.

As soon as he stopped himself, he tapped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light.

At the same time, Yang Ye had transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

Boom!

An explosion resounded. Both the rays of light exploded into bits. Yang Ye was pushed more than 1km away while the one-armed man had been pushed around 300m away.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. A moment later, he transformed into a ray of light that arrived before the one-armed man, and then he stabbed his sword forward.

Close quarter combat!

He had to engage the man in close quarter combat in order to gain an advantage over the one-armed [email protected]

However, the one-armed man didn’t give him the chance to engage in close quarter combat. The one-armed man swung his saber and pushed Yang Ye back.

Yang Ye glanced at his hand. At this moment, his hand was shivering slightly.

Strength!

The strength carried within the one-armed man’s saber was extremely powerful, and it may even be stronger than his physical strength. Of course, it wasn’t because the one-armed man’s body was stronger than his, and it was because the one-armed man had some sort of special energy. That was why his saber carried such strength.

Suddenly, the one-armed man vanished once more on the spot. A moment later, a ray of light appeared in front of Yang Ye.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was pushed backwards again.

Right when the one-armed man was about to attack again, Yang Ye suddenly gazed at the pig riding young woman and the others, “What are all of you standing there and watching for?! Hurry up and help me!”

The pig riding young woman was stunned, “You’re not fighting him in a one on one battle?”

“A one on one battle?” Yang Ye shook his head and spoke seriously, “Ganging up is the way to victory!”
