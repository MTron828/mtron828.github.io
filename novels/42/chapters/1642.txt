Chapter 1643 - Let The Heavens Decide!

Translator: InVader

“How dare you!” Yang Xu roared with fury, and he vanished on the spot once he finished speaking. However, a Blood Puppet immediately charged at him.

Bang!

Yang Xu was pushed over 300m away, but the Blood Puppet was pushed back too.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword had cut fully into Yang Yan’s throat. However, Yang Ye didn’t cut further in, so Yang Yan was still alive.

Lu Lige glanced at Yang Ye, and then he wiped off the cold sweat on his forehead. At this moment, he realized that Yang Ye had no intention to make peace.

A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Jian’s mouth, “He’s a man. But it isn’t very wise.”

The black robed old man behind him asked, “Young Master, do you think he’s a threat to you?”

Yang Jian chuckled, “He has no intention to be the successor of the clan!”

The black robed old man asked, “Why?”

“He has quite the temper!” Yang Jian smiled, “If he wanted to become the successor, he wouldn’t do that.”

His gaze descended onto Yang Ye, and there was a strange glow in them as he continued, “He really has quite the temper. However, the Discipline Hall and Yang Xu aren’t so easy to deal with…”

“What a temper!” Gu Xiu had a slight smile on the corners of his mouth, “Just as the information provided, he really is a fellow who disregards the consequences.”

Qian Hu spoke indifferently, “That’s exactly what we want. Isn’t it?”

The smile on Gu Xiu’s face still remained as he replied, “Of course!”

Yang Xuan glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Dammit!” A man on the walls of Phecda City cursed with fury, “So the Blood Puppets were in his possession!”

It was the seventh young master of the Yang Clan, Yang Xing!

At this moment, Yang Xing was staring at Yang Ye while the desire to kill in his eyes seemed almost material. However, he didn’t do anything. As far as he was concerned, the best choice right now was to stay and watch them fight.

Meanwhile, at the moment Yang Ye had cut open Yang Yan’s throat, the face of the elder from the Discipline Hall had turned gloomy. He said, “Do you realize what you’re doing?”

“What I’m doing?” Yang Ye laughed fiercely, “Of course I do.”

As he spoke, he moved his wrist slightly, and a string of blood sprayed from Yang Yan’s throat again. However, Yang Yan was still alive. After all, he was a Rebirth Realm expert. So long as Yang Ye didn’t completely obliterate the vitality within Yang Yan or chop off Yang Yan’s head, then Yang Yan wouldn’t die!

The eyes of the elder from the Discipline Hall narrowed slightly, “The fight for succession hasn’t begun. The disciples of the Yang Clan are prohibited from fighting against each other. Aren’t you aware of that rule? Or perhaps, you don’t take my Discipline Hall seriously?”

“The Discipline Hall?” Yang Ye chuckled, and then he pulled out his sword and stabbed it into Yang Yan’s head.

Hiss!

A torrent of blood instantly surged out along Yang Ye’s sword.

The elder’s eyes instantly turned icy cold at the sight of this. As for Yang Xu, his figure charged at Yang Ye. But it didn’t take long for him to stop because Yang Ye had extracted Yang Yan’s soul!

At this moment, Yang Yan’s eyes were filled with terror. He was just a soul right now, so it would only take an instant for Yang Ye to obliterate him!

Yang Ye held Yang Yan’s soul in his left hand as he gazed at the elder from the Discipline Hall, “The Discipline Hall? Are you kidding me? What was the Discipline Hall doing when Yang Yan acted against my friend? What was the Discipline Hall doing when I was almost killed by this pair of grandfather and grandson just now? But you’ve shown yourself when I’m about to kill them? Fucking Old Bastard! Do you think I’m easy to bully just because I have no fucking backing? Huh?!”

The elder’s face became extremely unsightly from being cursed at in public. He was about to attack, but Yang Xu stopped him and said, “Brother Yang Lin, he still has my grandson.”

The elder called Yang Lin glanced at Yang Ye, “Release his soul or I guarantee that you’ll suffer a horrible death!”

Yang Ye suddenly pointed his sword at Yang Lin, “Old Bastard! Let’s fight one on one! Let the heavens decide who lives and dies! Do you dare?!”

Clamorous noise resounded from the surroundings.

Presently, many guards of the Yang Clan had gathered on the city walls. After all, a battle had broken out outside the city, and the commotion created by the advance of Yang Ye’s slaughter intent had been so huge. So, the entire Yang Clan had been alarmed by it.

So, when they saw that Yang Ye actually dared to challenge an elder of the Discipline Hall to a one on one battle, all the guards were utterly shocked. The guards weren’t the only ones, even the other young masters and experts hiding in the surroundings were shocked by Yang Ye’s words.

He’d challenged an elder of the Discipline Hall to a one on one battle!

The Discipline Hall had quite a supreme status in the Yang Clan. After all, it managed the rules and punishment in the Yang Clan. Besides a few people, everyone else was subject to the rules of the Discipline Hall. So, not to mention the young masters who had no authority, even those who had great authority would give the Discipline Hall some face!

Yet now, someone was actually openly challenging it! Moreover, it was even a young master of the Yang Clan who they didn’t know!

Lu Lige gulped while cold sweat flowed down his face. He spoke softly, “I think I’ve gotten into big trouble…”

In the sky far above Phecda City.

There were two old men in cloud white robes there. They were standing side by side, and their gazes were on Yang Ye.

The old man on the left spoke indifferently, “Yang Gu, aren’t you going to stop them?”

“Stop them?” The old man on the right, Yang Gu, chuckled, “Why would I? That kid’s temper is good, very good. Hahaha!”

The old man on the left asked, “Aren’t you afraid that he won’t be able to deal with the situation?”

Yang Gu spoke indifferently, “If he can, then it’s because he’s capable; if he can’t, then he deserves to die!”

The old man on the left nodded, “I understand.”

Obviously, he wanted Yang Ye to fight the Discipline Hall on his own!

Yang Lin stared at Yang Ye. He hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually challenge him in public!

Should he accept or not?

He definitely had to!

If he didn’t, how would he hold his head up high in the Yang Clan? How would he be able to deter others in the future? Moreover, if he refused, then an inner demon would definitely be formed within him. After all, even he would look down on himself if he didn’t dare to accept a challenge coming from a Rebirth Realm expert. After all, it was impossible for him to swallow such an insult.

Most importantly, did he have to fear a cultivator at the Rebirth Realm?

Yang Lin glanced coldly at Yang Ye, “Let the heavens decide who lives and dies? Are you sure?”

“Of course!” Yang Ye laughed coldly, and then he walked over to Little Sky’s soul while holding Yang Yan’s soul in his grasp. At this moment, Little Sky was extremely weak, and her body was almost completely translucent.

Yang Ye took a deep breath, suppressed the raging desire to kill in his heart, and waved his right hand. He placed Little Sky’s soul within the Primordial Pagoda, and then he pressed Yang Yan’s soul against the wall before hanging Yang Yan by the neck with the same black rope which had been used to bind Little Sky just now.

“How dare you!” Yang Xu’s expression changed, and he was about to attack. However, Yang Ye suddenly looked at him, “Old Bastard, make another sound and I’ll obliterate him right now!”

“You!” Yang Xu was livid. However, he didn’t dare to threaten or curse at Yang Ye. Because he was very well aware that Yang Ye wasn’t joking.

Yang Ye glanced coldly at Yang Xu, and then he turned to look at Lu Lige, “Be careful!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand, and a Blood Puppet appeared by Lu Lige’s side. As for the other, it went over to Yang Yan’s side.

So long as he gave the command, it would instantly obliterate Yang Yan!

Lu Lige said, “Be careful!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he turned around and walked towards Yang Lin, “If I’m not wrong, the reason Yang Xu dared to openly draw me out and kill me is because he notified your Discipline Hall in advance, and your Discipline Hall tacitly approved of it. I’m right, aren’t I?”

He was no fool. He was a young master of the Yang Clan as well. So, logically speaking, Yang Xu and Yang Yan couldn’t act against him before the fight for succession. However, they’d done so. Obviously, they’d obtained the tacit approval of the Discipline Hall!

Yang Lin spoke indifferently, “Does that make a difference?”

Yang Ye nodded, “True, it doesn’t!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of blood red light that vanished on the spot.

Yang Lin’s eyes narrowed slightly. A moment later, a spear appeared in his grasp, and then he swiftly stabbed it forward.

A cold glimmer of light flashed. In an instant, a ray of light surged out from the tip of it like a bolt of lightning, and the space around it started cracking apart.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s figure suddenly stopped when he was about to arrive before Yang Lin, and then he swiftly waved his sword successively. As he waved it, wave after wave of blood red sword energy sprayed forth like a storm.

Rumble!

In an instant, numerous explosions resounded, and the space in a huge area throughout the surroundings had completely cracked open. Moreover, the cracks were spreading at a visible rate.

Yang Xu frowned, and then he seemed to have thought of something, causing his expression to change, “Watch out! Don’t let space shatter!”

As he spoke, he was about to repair the space there.

However, a sword howl suddenly resounded.

Boom!

Along with that sword howl, the cracked up space in a huge area rumbled and collapsed. As soon as space collapsed, the black hole there strangely started to shrink. At the same time, a blood red ray of light and a strand of sword energy flashed through the black hole.

“AH!” A shrill cry suddenly resounded from within the black hole.

Suddenly, a furious shout resounded from within the city, “Stop!”

A moment later, a palm suddenly flashed down from the sky and slammed its way into the black hole.

Bang!

An explosion resounded from within the black hole, and then the space there was gradually restored to normal.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye and Yang Lin’s figures had appeared once more before the eyes of everyone here.

At this moment, Yang Lin was lying flat on the ground. His arms were gone, and Yang Ye’s foot was on his head. However, there was a palm print on Yang Ye’s chest, and it was caused by the attack launched by the expert who’d shouted from within the city!

The palm print on his chest was very deep, and it had almost pierced through his entire body!

Yang Ye looked towards the distance, and he saw an old man with white eyebrows.

It was the Vice Hall Master of the Discipline Hall, Yang Wuyan!

Yang Wuyan gazed coldly at Yang Ye, “Let him go. I don’t want to repeat myself. Understand?”

Suddenly, Yang Ye stomped his right foot down.

Bang!

Yang Lin’s head instantly exploded apart, and blood sprayed in all directions!
