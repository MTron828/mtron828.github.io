Chapter 2630

The Origin World.

At this moment, the entire Origin World was being destroyed!

Snowy had absorbed an uncountable amount of spirit energy from here, and it could be said that her actions had severely damaged the Origin World.

In the end, the sword cultivator’s attack was undoubtedly the last straw that broke the camel’s back.

The entire world started to crumble, and countless fled.

Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu didn’t leave!

As far as they were concerned, this was the best opportunity they could ask for.

In the air, the woman in black glanced coldly at Tian Xiu and Qi Bitian who were charging at her.

Bang!

A rumbling explosion resounded, and then the entire Origin World collapsed, causing countless strands of Boundless Water to shoot up into the air and drown everything!

…

Eternal Border.

At a mountain range.

Bang!

A black shadow crashed down from the sky, causing the entire mountain range to tremble while clouds of dust surged up.

A figure crawled out of a huge crater.

It was Yang Ye’s figure.

Once he crawled out of the crater, he glanced at the surroundings, but he didn’t see Tian Xiu or Qi Bitian. In an instant, his face turned gloomy.

It would be a lie if he said he wasn’t worried!

After all, the woman in black was no ordinary expert.

But he knew that worrying would make no difference. He wasn’t able to interfere in a battle at that level for now.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and returned to the Primordial Pagoda.

He went to the bamboo house that Qi Bitian had once resided in. But at this moment, the house had vanished. Erya was seated there, and she was a little different than before!

She was still in human form, but she wasn’t really human at some places. For example, her hands. They were hands no more, they were claws.

Snowy wasn’t very far away from Erya, and the dragon and all the other demons were nearby as well.

Snowy gazed at Erya with worry all over her face. She immediately flew over to Yang Ye upon noticing his arrival and pointed at Erya.

Yang Ye glanced at Erya and spoke softly, “Don’t worry, she’s fine!”

Snowy nodded but was still very worried.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he gazed at the egg Qi Bitian had left behind.

While the bamboo house had been destroyed, the egg remained.

Yang Ye picked it up and passed it to Snowy. If even Snowy couldn’t notice anything unusual about it, the egg would really be just an egg!

Snowy rubbed the egg gently with her paw, and then her eyes opened wide.

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “What is it?”

Snowy pointed at the egg, and then she waved her little paw. A strand of extremely pure spirit energy surged into the egg.

The egg started to tremble violently before Yang Ye.

In the end, the egg gradually vanished, but Yang Ye noticed that the space around the egg started to wriggle.

Yang Ye asked, “What is that?”

Snowy blinked and shook her head. She grabbed with her paw, and she seemed to have grasped something. Snowy took a careful look at it, and then she released her grip. Meanwhile, the space around Snowy started to tremble violently.

Yang Ye frowned at the sight of this, and slaughter intent flashed through his eyes.

But Snowy was fine. She cracked a smile and waved her paw. Just like that, the space around her started to warp…

Yang Ye frowned and wondered what the heck it was!

Even now, he couldn’t see the mysterious fellow. Snowy seemed to be able to see it, and it seemed to be trying to flatter Snowy.

It was understandable because Snowy was the Sprite Progenitor now!

Something worth mentioning was that Snowy had brought many sprites along with her from the Origin World, and all of them had entered the Primordial Pagoda with her!

For example, the mysterious Destiny Realm flame, it had become Snowy’s bodyguard now. So long as Snowy willed it, the mysterious flame would appear. Besides that, there were many other sprites, and there were some Destiny Realm sprites among them!

Some of them had left, but many sprites had chosen to stay!

They were staying in the Primordial Pagoda!

Presently, the Primordial Pagoda was the world with the most sprites now!

Yang Ye went over to An Nanjing’s abode, and she was seated cross-legged there. A spear was floating by her side.

An Nanjing opened her eyes when she sensed Yang Ye’s arrival.

Yang Ye walked over to her and spoke softly, “Are you alright?”

An Nanjing shook her head.

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Recuperate well.”

He turned around and left once he finished speaking.

An Nanjing closed her eyes slowly.

Cultivate!

…

Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda and transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Two hours later, Yang Ye returned to Eternal Kingdom.

The Ancient Sword Sect.

Everyone in the sect was relieved to see Yang Ye return. Especially Blood Maiden. Once Yang Ye left earlier, Blood Maiden knew that based on his character, he would definitely cause trouble. Fortunately, he’d returned safely!

In Yang Ye’s abode.

Yang Ye summoned Sword Scroll to the Primordial Pagoda and brought her before Snowy, “Snowy, help her recover.”

Recover!

Snowy blinked, gazed at Sword Scroll, and then nodded slightly.

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head and left the pagoda.

He had too many things to do right now.

At the peak of a mountain, Elder Xue spoke softly from behind Yang Ye, “Sect Master, what happened?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “It’s a long story.”

Elder Xue spoke softly, “The disciples are very worried about you!”

Yang Ye grinned and looked down below. There were countless disciples training diligently down there!

The disciples of the sect were much more diligent than they ever had been.

Yang Ye was very gratified by their display.

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something at this point and gazed at Elder Xue, “Elder Xue, we have no records on the first sect master of our sect, but what about the second?”

He hadn’t forgotten Gu Jiantian!

Elder Xue asked, “Why do you ask?”

Yang Ye replied softly, “I met him somewhere.”

Elder Xue frowned slightly, “Our second sect master… I remember a little about him. There aren’t many records on him. All I do know is that he seems to have been expelled. As for the reason or who did it, I do not know. Should I investigate?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “That isn’t necessary. He’s dead.”

Suddenly, an elder of the sect appeared here. The elder bowed slightly to Yang Ye and said, “Sect Master, someone from the Sprite Palace wishes to see you!”

“The Sprite Palace?” Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What is that?”

Elder Xue explained, “The power that the previous Sprite Progenitor created.”

Yang Ye immediately recalled where he’d heard it.

That Sprite Progenitor had told Snowy to go to Sprite Palace upon arriving at Eternal Kingdom because she wanted Snowy to inherit the Sprite Palace.

Yang Ye fell silent for a short moment and said, “I’ll go meet them.”

Elder Xue nodded slightly, and then she turned around and left with the elder. A short while later, Elder Xue brought a woman in a dress to Yang Ye.

The woman had a veil on her face that obscured her appearance.

She wasn’t human, but Yang Ye didn’t know what sprite she was.

Yang Ye scanned her and spoke indifferently, “Do you need something?”

She sized up Yang Ye and said, “Sect Master Ye, we wish to take the Sprite Progenitor back.”

She was here for Snowy!

Yang Ye shook his head, “That isn’t necessary. She's doing very well with me!”

The woman spoke solemnly, “Sect Master Ye, the Sprite Progenitor should belong to our Sprite Palace!”

Yang Ye walked over to her, and she frowned while a trace of displeasure and vigilance appeared on her face.

Yang Ye chuckled, “You say she belongs to Sprite Palace? Why?”

The woman spoke solemnly, “Sect Master Ye, the Sprite Progenitor is the leader of all sprites in this world, and she is the leader of my Sprite Palace. She…”

“What if she isn’t the Sprite Progenitor?” Yang Ye suddenly interrupted the woman, “You wouldn’t care about her fate, right?”

The woman spoke solemnly, “She’s the Sprite Progenitor!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Sprite Palace should have been aware of our arrival in Eternal Kingdom for a long time. But you didn’t come to her in the beginning. Because she wasn’t really the Sprite Progenitor then, so she wasn’t very useful to all of you. Coupled with the fact that there was enmity between me and the Eternal Kingdom, so you chose not to take her back with you. Because she wasn’t worth the risk then, and she wasn’t worth being brought into Sprite Palace. Now that she is really the Sprite Progenitor, you think she is qualified now. Because she is very, very useful to all of you. Am I right?”

The woman gazed at Yang Ye, “So, you refuse to let her go?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Why? Are you planning on threatening me?”

The woman spoke solemnly, “Sect Master Ye, going to our Sprite Palace is the best option for her. The inheritance of our previous sect master is there, so it’s absolutely beneficial to her. Sect Master Ye, don’t be rash.”

Yang Ye smiled, “I didn’t see you when Snowy summoned the sprites of the universe, or can you tell me who from the Sprite Palace came to her aid?”

The woman’s eyes narrowed slightly, and she remained silent.

Yang Ye smiled, “I understand. It’s how the world works. It’s difficult to share in the difficulties of others, but it’s easy to share their wealth and success. Now, I’m telling you, and I’m telling the Sprite Palace. Since you cannot stand by her when the times are difficult, don’t even think about benefiting from her, and never ever think of using her to accomplish any goals of yours. Elder Xue, send her off.”

Elder Xue gazed at the woman, “Please come with me!”

The woman didn’t leave. She gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then she said, “Sect Master Ye, are you planning on becoming enemies with my Sprite Palace? I’m afraid the rage of my Sprite Palace isn’t something you…”

A ray of light flashed.

Hiss!

A head flew into the air!

It was the woman’s head!

Her eyes were wide open and filled with disbelief!

Yang Ye gazed at the sky, “Elder Xue, send this head back to the Sprite Palace. Tell them that if they dare to target Snowy again, then I’ll slaughter them!”
