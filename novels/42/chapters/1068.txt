Chapter 1069 – You’re Leaving Just Like That?

Yang Ye said, “Why don’t you try it?”

An Nanjing nodded and issued a command in her heart, the Skyfire Armor instantly transformed into a ray of fiery light that entered her body.

A long time passed before a ray of fiery light suddenly erupted from within her, and then her figure was covered in a very dense fiery red scale armor. An Nanjing moved her body slightly, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “It’s very soft and comfortable.”

Yang Ye flicked a strand of sword energy that was enhanced by Void Rank sword intent, and a short clang resounded as the sword energy vanished. But the scale armor was completely unharmed.

Yang Ye smiled, “Not bad. Ordinary Saints won’t be able to break through its defenses at all!”

An Nanjing nodded slightly, “That woman was warning us just now!”

Yang Ye’s face gradually became solemn, “If I were her, I would definitely not let the matter rest as well. They have no proof for now, and coupled with the scene we made, they can’t do anything to us for now. However, they will definitely not let us go just like that.”

An Nanjing asked, “What do you plan to do?”

Yang Ye smiled, “What else? We can only act according to the situation. Actually, if we join forces, then how confident are you in being able to kill that grey robed old man before him?”

An Nanjing replied, “100%!”

“Me too!” Yang Ye chuckled, “Let’s cultivate!”

An Nanjing nodded in response.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground and started drawing stellar energy into his body. He attached great importance to the cultivation of his body now. Because countless facts proved that a formidable body was extremely advantageous. Moreover, while he hadn’t attained the Saint Realm, his cultivation of the body had surpassed ordinary Saints.

His body should be at the Divine Valor Realm right now. If he attained the Divine Fortitude Realm, then he was confident that he could kill a mid-rank Saint even without utilizing a sword.

In short, regardless of whether it was his Sword Dao or body, he was working hard to improve all of them.

Even though the backlash he suffered from absorbing stellar energy was still extremely terrifying with the current strength of his body, it wasn’t absolutely unbearable as it had been in the past.

During this period of cultivation, Lin Jingfeng had frequently sent over Saint Rank fruits and violet crystals to them. Yang Ye naturally accepted all of them.

In his opinion, it was a waste to reject them!

If the violet crystals he had were combined with the violet crystals Snowy spat out and Lin Jingfeng had given him in the last few days, Yang Ye had 35 violet crystals now.

Obviously, it wasn’t much. But it was temporarily sufficient for Yang Ye.

2 days later.

Yang Ye opened his eyes while his lips parted slightly, and a mouthful of foul energy escape his mouth. After that, he stood up and stretched his body. In an instant, his body started cracking like a firecracker.

Yang Ye stretched out his hand and slowly clenched his fist. As his fist was clenched together, the space around his fist instantly started to warp. But it didn’t take long for him to release his grip because he didn’t want to cause trouble.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing walked over to him and spoke softly, “Your physical strength has grown!”

Yang Ye grinned, “Wouldn’t I have suffered for nothing in the last few days if it didn’t grow? Unfortunately, it only grew a little, and there’s quite a distance left for me to attain the realm I seek. Alas, my burdens are heavy, yet the path is still so long!”

“We’ve only just started on the path of cultivation!” An Nanjing continued, “The stronger I get, the clearer I realize how tiny I am.”

Yang Ye nodded, “All those years ago, we were called the Sword Emperor and Martial God in Profounder Continent. At that time, we were in such high spirits. But once I arrived in this world, I realized that there are too many extraordinary people here. Even though we aren’t bad, there are numerous people who are more outstanding than us.”

An Nanjing revealed a slight smile when she recalled the events of the past, “Who isn’t arrogant in their youth?”

Thump! Thump!

Meanwhile, someone knocked on their room’s door.

Yang Ye gazed at the door and said, “Come in!”

Xuwu Shen walked into the room, and he sized up An Nanjing and Yang Ye before he chuckled, “Good morning!”

Yang Ye said, “That smile of yours seems to be inviting me to punch it!”

“Why don’t we spar?” An Nanjing gazes at him with a slightly hostile expression.

“Stop!” Xuwu Shen raised his hands, “I surrender! I surrender alright?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Get to the point!”

Xuwu Shen said, “We’ll arrive at Sky Capital in an hour. It’s a small city in the outskirts of the Central Divine Prefecture. It’s a city that everyone has to pass through before entering the Central Divine Prefecture, so there are all sorts of people and powers from all over the dimension here. It’s quite chaotic. Fortunately, we’ll be fine if we pay the protection fees of the city!”

Yang Ye was quite puzzled, “Protection fee?”

Xuwu Shen shrugged, “It’s a rule established by one of the bosses of Sky Capital City. So long as you don’t cause trouble, then trouble won’t seek you out once you’ve paid the fee. Otherwise, trouble will appear out of nowhere.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye glanced at Xuwu Shen, “You’re afraid that we wouldn’t pay, so you came to remind us first, right?”

Xuwu Shen smiled with embarrassment, “Actually, I am quite worried. I’m not afraid of trouble, but some places have their own rules and laws. I think that we don’t have to challenge its rules and laws, right?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m not a fool. As I always say, I won’t offend others if they don’t offend me.”

Xuwu Shen nodded, “Once we leave the Cloud Shuttle, we’ll take the teleportation formation in the city and head to White Deer Dimension right away!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “White Deer Dimension?”

Xuwu Shen explained, “Diamond Rank powers have extraordinary experts in their midst. Those extraordinary seniors possess otherworldly ability, so creating an independent area in space is nothing to them. So, Diamond Rank powers usually possess their own independent dimension. As for the world outside, it’s occupied by the other small powers.”

“So that’s why!” Yang Ye nodded, and then he gazed at Xuwu Shen, “We aren’t heading to White Deer Academy to have fun. We’re there to cause trouble. Are you sure you intend to go with us?”

Xuwu Shen pondered deeply for a short while, and then he spoke seriously, “Do you know why my father made me come here with you?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Xuwu Shen explained, “Because he feels that you’re good at causing trouble, and there’ll be an endless stream of trouble if I go with you.”

Yang Ye’s face darkened.

Xuwu Shen said, “He told me that while he has no knowledge about your background, he noticed something since you appeared in Pine Prefecture. It’s that you’ve always been facing all sorts of trouble without end. After that, he realized that your strength improved after every single problem you faced was resolved. Moreover, according to the information he received, you cultivate very diligently. In short, he thinks that I’ll be tempered well if I go with you, and White Deer Academy is the first place I’m to be tempered at!”

When he spoke up to this point, Xuwu Shen’s tone changed, “Actually, I think I’m not his biological son. Otherwise, how could he possibly make me follow a fellow like you? He even asked me to go with you to look for trouble with White Deer Academy! I think he’s trying to indirectly kill me!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Suddenly, they felt the shuttle stop.

Xuwu Shen said, “We’ve arrived!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then they left the room. They’d just left the room when a city appeared within their fields of vision.

It was huge!

Absolutely huge!

That was Yang Ye’s first impression.

Sky City and Ocean of Clouds City were huge, but when compared to Sky Capital City, it was like comparing a child to an adult!

It didn’t take long for them to arrive before the entrance to the city. Yang Ye noticed that everyone was only being allowed into the city after they paid a violet crystal.

Suddenly, a man leaped over the guards standing in front of the entrance. The guards didn’t stop him and just laughed coldly.

Xuwu Shen shook his head, “That fellow is dead!”

“AH!!” Suddenly, a miserable and shrill cry resounded from within the city, and then a corpse flew out of the city.

Yang Ye said, “How overbearing!”

Xuwu Shen smiled, “Get used to it!”

When it was their turn, Yang Ye didn’t break the rules and was about to hand sufficient violet crystals over. However, Lin Jingfeng suddenly appeared in front of them, and he smiled, “Brother Ye, I’ll pay the entry fee. Just take it as a gift from me!” As he spoke, he tossed over a few violet crystals to those guards.

After that, he glanced at An Nanjing out of the corner of his eye, and he remained indifferent even when he noticed that she wasn’t looking at him.

Yang Ye gave Lin Jingfeng a thumbs up, “Brother Lin, you really are generous!”

Xuwu Shen did the same, “Indeed!”

Lin Jingfeng grinned, and then he turned around and walked into the city in a very carefree manner. He had a smile of confidence on his face. He was confident that they would definitely follow him and refuse to leave someone like him.

Suddenly, Elder Lin said, “Young Master, they didn’t follow us!”

Lin Jingfeng frowned, and then he turned around and saw Yang Ye’s group was walking towards another direction.

Lin Jingfeng was stunned, and then he flashed over and obstructed Yang Ye’s path, “Where are you going?”

Yang Ye smiled, “We’re naturally going where we want to go!”

Lin Jingfeng asked, “Where?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I can’t tell you that!”

Lin Jingfeng asked, “You’re leaving just like that?”

Yang Ye said, “Why not?”

Lin Jingfeng shot a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, and then he turned around to gaze at An Nanjing. His eyes were filled with tender affection as he said, “Miss Ye, from the moment I laid eyes on you, I....”

“Fuck off!” An Nanjing immediately interrupted him.

Lin Jingfeng glanced at An Nanjing, and then he glanced at Yang Ye. In the end, he spoke with a gloomy expression on his face, “Both of you tricked me!”

Yang Ye opened his eyes wide while revealing an innocent expression.
