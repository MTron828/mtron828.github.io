Chapter 2173 – Shao Siyou!

A woman in a purple dress stood before Yang Ye, and there was a cloak which was as thin as a cicada’s wings hanging from her shoulder.

Yang Ye had seen her before!

It was Shao Siyou!

Shao Siyou!

The Pavilion Master of Nether Pavilion!

As soon as Yang Ye refused, the surroundings fell silent. Or to be more precise, the atmosphere here became quite tense!

Shao Siyou gazed at Yang Ye, and he met her gaze.

A long time passed before she smiled, “Is there no room for discussion?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “None!”

Shao Siyou smiled, “How stubborn.”

As she spoke, she stretched out her right hand, and the space around Yang Ye instantly froze.

Meanwhile, a sword howl resounded. A moment later, Shao Siyou moved 300m back while blood seeped out from the corner of Yang Ye’s mouth.

Their first collision!

She sized up Yang Ye and nodded, “Needless to say, with such strength at your age, you deserve to be called a monstrous genius!”

Yang Ye said, “Does your Nether Pavilion plan to take her from me by force?”

Shao Siyou appeared in front of Yang Ye again, “What if I say yes?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Then try me.”

A smile curled up on the corners of her mouth, “Looks like you’re very confident in yourself. Or perhaps, you’re confident in that person who stands behind you.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “The Nether Pavilion is very strong. If Eldest Sister, Second Sister, and the others join forces, then killing me should be very easy. But so what? There are some things and some people in life that have to be protected, even if the consequence is death. As for whether I can succeed at protecting her, I don’t know. All I do know is that I’ll try my best to protect her while I live, and even if I die, I won’t regret my choice.”

He gazed at Shao Siyou and continued, “I have a connection to the Nether Pavilion, but if you choose to take her by force today, then we’ll consider the relationship between us to be in the past. If your Nether Pavilion wants to fight, then I’ll fight you at any time!”

Nether Maiden remained silent while she stood at the side.

“Fight?” Shao Siyou smiled, “Yang Ye, you can’t afford to! My Nether Pavilion could even annihilate the Confucianist Path, let alone you and the human race? I only brought you here because of the past relationship you had with my Nether Pavilion. Anyone else would be dead now.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Then don’t. Because I have no relationship with you.”

Shao Siyou was just about to speak when a voice came from the side, “Just go!”

Yang Ye turned around, and he saw ten women walking over slowly. They were led by Sky Maiden.

Sky Maiden!

Blood Maiden and the others were by her side.

Yang Ye gazed at Blood Maiden, nodded slightly, and smiled, “Eldest Sister, Second Sister, long time no see!”

Sky Maiden gazed at Yang Ye and nodded slightly, and then she gazed at Shao Siyou, “Pavilion Master Siyou, he has helped our Nether Pavilion repeatedly in the lower dimensions, and he saved our lives on many occasions. If you intend to act against him, then all 11 of us will withdraw from the Nether Pavilion!”

Withdraw!

Yang Ye’s heart felt warm.

They were still the same sisters of the Nether Pavilion that he knew.

Shao Siyou’s face turned slightly gloomy when she heard Sky Maiden. A long time passed before she gazed at Yang Ye, “Leave!”

Yang Ye glanced at her, and then he gazed at Sky Maiden and the others, “Come visit the Human Dimension another day.”

He didn’t hesitate to leave once he finished speaking.

Shao Siyou spoke indifferently, “Looks like all of you’ve chosen his side!”

Sky Maiden replied, “Can our Nether Pavilion not survive without the Sprite Lord?”

“Survive?” She laughed coldly, “Do you know how many powerful organizations existed in the large universe all those years ago? But what happened in the end? All of them vanished. It was the End Times that made them vanish.”

Sky Maiden replied with a question, “Having a Sprite Lord guarantees our survival through the End Times?”

Shao Siyou said, “Of course not. However, we’ll have a chance with a Sprite Lord. If we don’t have a Sprite Lord, we’ll all die once the End Times arrive and spirit energy vanishes.” She glanced coldly at them at this point and continued, “He was able to leave this time, but he won’t be that lucky again.”

She turned around and vanished on the spot.

Once she left, only Sky Maiden and the others remained here.

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden suddenly gazed at Sky Maiden, “Why did she give up?”

Sky Maiden replied indifferently, “That wasn’t her main body!”

All of them were shocked when they heard this!

“That wasn’t her main body?” Blood Maiden said, “Eldest Sister, you’re saying that was just a clone?”

Sky Maiden nodded, and then she gazed in the direction Yang Ye had left toward, “The current Nether Pavilion isn’t the same Nether Pavilion we knew in the lower dimensions. It’s too unfamiliar to us now!”

Blood Maiden said, “Eldest Sister, do you plan to leave?”

Sky Maiden fell silent for a long time and shook her head, “Let’s forget about that for now.”

She glanced at them and continued, “From now onward, work hard on your cultivations. No matter what happens in the future, we need strength to face what comes.”

They nodded.

…

After he left the Nether Palace, Yang Ye entered outer space once more.

This time, he’d been absolutely shocked. While he seemed unyielding and composed in the Nether Palace, he’d sensed a few vicious auras lock onto him. If Shao Siyou attacked, then even if Sky Maiden and the others didn’t help her, he would probably be unable to leave. The Nether Pavilion was more mysterious and powerful than he’d imagined, and he now understood why the armless man had told him to be careful!

He hadn’t been overconfident, and the main reason he’d gone was Nether Maiden. It was because he trusted his friend!

His trust wasn’t misplaced as well!

They hadn’t tried to harm him!

Suddenly, Snowy emerged from within the pagoda. She stopped Yang Ye and started waving her claws swiftly. Moreover, she seemed extremely excited. Her entire body seemed to be in a state of extreme excitement.

Yang Ye was stunned for a moment, and then he became excited as well. An instant later, he entered the Primordial Pagoda.

At the 2nd level of the Primordial Pagoda, a petite young woman stood before Yang Ye.

It was none other than Zi’er who’d been unconscious for so long.

Zi’er!

The violet mink!

Zi’er gazed at Yang Ye with a smile on her face, but it was quite pale. Obviously, she hadn’t recovered completely.

Yang Ye walked over to her and hugged her gently. He spoke in a trembling voice, “Zi’er, you… you’re awake!”

Zi’er!

She was one of the people who resided in the deepest parts of his heart. His feelings for Zi’er were a little different than what he felt for Su Qingshi and the others. Of course, it didn’t mean that he loved her more, and it was that she’d gone through thick and thin with him! She’d always been within him in the most difficult periods of his life. It was always difficult to forget the person who’d suffered with you, and Zi’er was that person for Yang Ye.

Zi’er didn’t say anything, and she just hugged him tight.

Yang Ye was everything to her!

Meanwhile, Snowy pointed at Zi’er and started introducing her to Tian Xiu.

Snowy and Zi’er had known each other for a long time too, so she had a deep relationship with Zi’er. Of course, she was afraid of Zi’er. After all, Zi’er was the person by Yang Ye’s side who held the most authority when it came to making decisions.

Tian Xiu glanced at Zi’er and spoke softly, “Hello, Big Sister Zi’er!”

Zi’er gazed at Tian Xiu, and Yang Ye smiled, “Her name is Tian Xiu!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Zi’er walked over to Tian Xiu, took Tian Xiu’s hand, and smiled, “Hello!”

Tian Xiu heaved a sigh of relief when she heard Zi’er greet her so casually. She glanced at Zi’er, hesitated for a moment, and said, “Big Sister Zi’er, are you not human?”

Surprise flashed through Zi’er’s eyes, “You noticed?”

Tian Xiu grinned, “It was a guess!”

Zi’er glanced at Tian Xiu, and then she gazed at Yang Ye. Yang Ye smiled, “I’ll explain later. Right, are you alright now?”

“She’s almost fine!” Meanwhile, Little Sky who’d been quiet until now suddenly walked over, “She’s just slightly weak and can’t endure much. So, she can’t go outside for now.”

Little Sky paused for a moment and continued, “I want to return to Sky Sky Continent!”

Sky Sky Continent!

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Why?”

Little Sky spoke softly, “I can sense the changes in the world, and I want to be with it. Moreover, I can sense that the spirit energy there is drying up. If I return…”

“No!” Yang Ye shook his head, “Little Sky, the End Times is coming, and problems will arise in all worlds. If I let you return now, I wouldn’t be able to rest at ease! I really wouldn’t!”

Little Sky walked over to Yang Ye, “Responsibility! You have yours, and I have mine. I’m the spirit of Sky Sky Continent, and it needs me now. I’ll at least be able to slow down the rate that spirit energy is vanishing if I’m there. In that way, I can help even more living beings find a new way out of this situation.”

Yang Ye wanted to say more, but Little Sky added, “I’ve made my decision. Don’t stop me, alright?”

Yang Ye’s eyes suddenly became slightly moist. He was very well aware what would happen to Little Sky if she returned!

She wouldn’t suffer a good end!

She was planning to die with Sky Sky Continent!

Suddenly, Snowy started waving her claws.

A short while later, Yang Ye’s eyes lit up, and then he gazed at Little Sky, “Little Sky, since you want to return, then I’ll go back with you. Snowy too. Let’s join forces and see if we can save Sky Sky Continent, alright?”

Little Sky hesitated for a moment, and then she gazed at Snowy, “Can you?”

Snowy blinked, and then she patted her own chest to display that she could!

Little Sky thought for a moment and spoke softly, “Then let’s try it!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Alright, let’s return to Sky Sky Continent right now!”

Bang!

Suddenly, the entire Primordial Pagoda shook violently…
