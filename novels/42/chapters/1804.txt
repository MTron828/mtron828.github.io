Chapter 1805 – Peerless Hegemon Body!

“Stop! Stop!” Suddenly, Hou Qing said, “Kid, just stop that.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Hou Qing glanced at him, “Because I don’t think I can trust an oath like that!

Yang Ye was speechless.

Suddenly, Qiong Qi appeared in front of Hou Qing, “Actually, you should just stop hesitating. Allowing this kid to learn your shaman race’s techniques may be a good thing for your race.”

“A good thing?” Hou Qing gazed at Qiong Qi, “Qiong Qi, don’t tell me you don’t know about the relationship between my shaman race and the human race!”

Qiong Qi replied, “Of course I do. But this kid doesn’t care about all of that. If your shaman race doesn’t look for trouble with him, he won’t look for trouble with your race. Moreover, he’ll definitely remember the kindness you show him, and that’s a good thing for you.”

Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “Err, I have to ask. Is the shaman race’s shaman techniques and that body refinement technique very formidable?”

“What do you think?!” Hou Qing spoke with displeasure, “It instills horror in the hearts of countless throughout the large universe.”

“Oh….” Yang Ye dragged that ‘oh’ out. Even though he didn’t say anything, his gaze clearly displayed that he didn’t believe Hou Qing.

Hou Qing was furious when he noticed Yang Ye’s gaze, “Kid, you want to give it a try?”

Yang Ye glanced at Hou Qing and said, “Your body refinement technique is definitely not weak, or you wouldn’t still be alive after being reduced to such a state. As for those shaman techniques….”

Qiong Qi suddenly said, “The strongest technique in the shaman race isn’t its body refinement technique but its shaman techniques!”

“Is that so?” Yang Ye gazed at Hou Qing, “Then let me experience it for myself!”

“Then I will!” As soon as Hou Qing finished speaking, he suddenly floated over to Yang Ye, and then a ray of red light appeared in his eyes. A moment later, Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically, and he noticed that he was actually unable to control himself!

Yang Ye was astounded. He was about to utilize his sword intent, but he suddenly noticed to his astonishment that his soul and body had been separated!

At this moment, his soul had left his body on its own!

Once his soul left his body, he noticed that numerous fine red threads had appeared on his soul. It was these red threads which made him unable to move at all.

Hou Qing gazed at Yang Ye’s soul, and his gaze gradually became icy cold.

Suddenly, Qiong Qi spoke, “This pagoda… It’s so huge!”

Hou Qing’s eyelids twitched. He fell silent for a moment, and then the red threads which bound Yang Ye’s soul vanished.

Once his soul returned to his body, Yang Ye gazed at Hou Qing while a trace of fear and seriousness could be seen in his eyes. Actually, that technique wasn’t impossible to defend against, but if one was caught off guard, even he couldn’t resist it.

Because once his soul was separated from his body, his strength was at its weakest. After all, he didn’t cultivate his soul. Moreover, even cultivating his soul wouldn’t make a difference because the technique targeted the soul. The soul was extremely weak once it didn’t have the support of a body.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing suddenly said, “It’s called Soul Extraction. It’s one of the top shaman techniques in my race. It’s used for dealing with humans, and it’s a shaman technique that humans are really afraid of. Because most humans possess extremely weak souls. So, when the experts of my shaman race fight the experts of the human race, many human experts are annihilated because they even see the experts of my shaman race.”

Yang Ye asked, “Amongst the shaman race, demon race, and human race in the large universe, which one is strongest?”

Hou Qing spoke solemnly, “None of them!”

Yang Ye was astounded, “There’s a race of beings stronger than all three races?”

Hou Qing nodded.

Yang Ye asked, “Which race is that?”

Hou Qing glanced at Yang Ye, “Why ask about all of that? Wouldn’t you find out for yourself once you get there?” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye was speechless.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing said, “Kid, I can teach you the shaman techniques and body refinement technique of my race, but I have a request. You can’t use it against the shaman race.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “I’m a man who doesn’t offend unless offended. So long as the shaman race doesn’t come looking for trouble with me, I won’t look for trouble with them. But if they want to kill me, then I’ll kill them!”

He gazed at Hou Qing and continued, “If I’m being honest, I really want to learn your shaman technique and body refinement technique, but it’s not a necessity to me. If you’re willing to help me, then I promise that I’ll let you leave this pagoda in ten years!”

Ten years!

He was confident that he wouldn’t have to fear Hou Qing in ten years from now. Even if Hou Qing was at his prime, he still wouldn’t have to fear Hou Qing!

Hou Qing looked Yang Ye in the eyes and asked, “Are you serious?”

Actually, he didn’t hold much hope about leaving. Because if he was in Yang Ye’s place, he wouldn’t release himself either. After all, if he was allowed to leave, it represented that this treasure Yang Ye had would be exposed. If the people in the large universe knew that the human race’s number one treasure was in Yang Ye’s possession, Yang Ye would definitely die!

However, he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually be willing to let him go. Even though it was ten years from now, such a period was like a nap to an expert in his realm of cultivation!

Yang Ye nodded, “Of course!”

Hou Qing gazed at Yang Ye for a long time. When he noticed that Yang Ye didn’t seem to be lying, he said, “Alright, it’s a promise!”

Qiong Qi shook his head slightly.

He has fallen into that kid’s trap.

He’d promised to follow Yang Ye for three years, but during those three years, he’d almost lost his life on many occasions. But Hou Qing had promised to stay with Yang Ye for ten years, so he could imagine how ‘miserable’ Hou Qing’s future life would be.

“Your physique isn’t bad, so I’ll teach you the body refinement technique first!” As soon as he said that, a ray of cold light shot out from the center of his forehead and instantly entered Yang Ye’s forehead. A moment later, a huge amount of information appeared in Yang Ye’s mind.

“The Undying Hegemon Technique. The supreme body refinement technique of the shaman race. If cultivated to the advanced-stage, the user can be reborn with a single drop of blood….”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time before he looked up at Hou Qing, “The Undying Hegemon Technique? Reborn with a single drop of blood?”

Hou Qing replied, “The technique I cultivate is the Undying Hegemon Technique. If the Sovereign of Man hadn’t used that wooden sword, then even if he could defeat me, it would be very difficult for him to injure me to such an extent. Even when he used the wooden sword, he still wasn’t able to kill me, and the reason is the Undying Hegemon Technique. So long as he doesn’t put an end to my vitality, I can be reborn from just a drop of blood!”

Yang Ye glanced at Hou Qing and asked, “How long will it take for you to fully recover?”

“That’s quite difficult!” Hou Qing spoke solemnly, “If I don’t have the help of any external forces, then it may take a few dozen years to rebuild my body. Because my body was damaged by that wooden sword, and that sword is a divine treasure.”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “How do I cultivate it?”

Hou Qing said, “The Undying Hegemon Technique is divided into three levels. The 1st level is called Peerless Hegemon. Your body can enter the Hegemon Body state. During this state, even 6th stage True Realm experts can’t harm you. But that’s not even the most terrifying part. The most terrifying part is that no matter how great the injuries you suffer are, you won’t be able to feel them while in the Hegemon Body state. During that period, you’ll feel like you’re invincible!”

The Peerless Hegemon!

Yang Ye nodded slightly and asked, “What about the second and third levels?”

Hou Qing replied, “The 2nd level is called Blood Rebirth. So long as your soul remains, then even if your body is destroyed, your body can be rebuilt with just a single drop of blood. There’ll be no need to find another host.”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Then why are you looking for a host?”

Hou Qing spoke solemnly, “Because if I don’t find a host, I won’t be able to return to the large universe. If I succeeded at seizing control of your body, I would have relied on your body to return to the large universe. Once I got back there, I would have abandoned your body. Because only my own body is most suitable for myself.”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “I should be able to cultivate the 1st level, Peerless Hegemon, right?”

Hou Qing fell silent for a moment and said, “Your foundation is very good, so while it may be a little difficult to attain the Blood Rebirth level, it should be quite easy for you to attain the Peerless Hegemon level. Moreover, you have that mysterious violet energy, so you can stimulate your body without any worries and allow it to be transformed from inside out!”

“Stimulate my body….” Yang Ye laughed bitterly. As he expected, cultivating the body wasn’t that easy.

“That flame of yours is very suitable for that!” Meanwhile, Hou Qing spoke abruptly, “You can make it help you and use it to stimulate your body.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded, “Alright.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he went to the cultivation room on the 3rd level.

Hou Qing and the Divine Yin Flame were in front of him within the room.

The Divine Yin Flame suddenly asked, “Are you sure?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I am.”

Body refinement was the most painful method of cultivation, but no matter how painful it was, he still intended to do it. Because it could improve his strength. Moreover, while his body’s strength was quite good, it was useless against 6th stage True Realm experts.

Especially 6th stage True Realm experts. They were able to pierce through his physical defenses with ease!

“Alright!” The Divine Yin Flame’s voice resounded abruptly, and then a strand of flames instantly enveloped Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyes opened wide in an instant.

“AHHH!” A heartrending cry resounded through the cultivation room.

At the same time, Hou Qing’s anxious voice resounded, “Divine Yin Flame, have you gone mad?! You actually used your full strength?! Are you trying to kill him?!”

A moment of silence ensued, and then the Divine Yin Flame spoke abruptly, “You should have said so sooner….”
