Chapter 2398 – I’m Really Hungry!

Yang Ye’s mind almost shattered before the shout, and it was like he was about to be killed!

Yang Ye was horrified and hurriedly fortified his mind. Moreover, the Primordial Pagoda helped to protect his soul as well. However, the energy still remained.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The old man in linen clothes suddenly pushed his right palm down in Yang Ye’s direction, causing Yang Ye to be frozen on the spot.

A moment of silence ensued, and then a voice resounded, “Oh, it’s Senior Wu Ni!”

The old man replied indifferently, “It’s just an insensible junior.”

“It’s fine!” The voice resounded, and then the energy on Yang Ye instantly vanished completely!

Once it vanished, Yang Ye’s body felt lighter, but his countenance was ghastly pale!

The old man called Wu Ni glanced at Yang Ye and said, “That world isn’t a place that just anyone can go to.”

Yang Ye cupped his fist to Wu Ni and said, “Thank you for helping me, Senior!”

He couldn’t help but laugh bitterly once he finished speaking. He’d really bitten off more than he could chew this time. At that instant earlier, the person who attacked him had been at an immeasurable distance away. However, that person could attack him through the teleportation passageway of the Myriad World Diagram. Moreover, that person had even been so terrifying! If it hadn’t been for Wu Ni, he would have been heavily injured even if he was able to avoid death!

Wu Ni glanced at the Myriad World Diagram before Yang Ye and said, “That diagram is more precious than you think. There are probably no more than three of them in this world. As for its true abilities, you’ll discover them in the future!”

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “There are too many things in this world that are still beyond my reach!”

Wu Ni replied indifferently, “The world is boundless.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “Senior, the world is boundless. Then has anyone been to the edge of the universe or its end?”

Wu Ni glanced at Yang Ye and replied, “I don’t know!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Meanwhile, Martial Ancestor suddenly said, “That old man with the bamboo chest may know a little.”

Wu Ni’s hand shuddered slightly as he lifted a GO piece, but he didn’t say anything.

The old man with the bamboo chest!

The image of the old man with a bamboo chest appeared in Yang Ye’s mind again. The old man was extremely mysterious indeed, and just a few things the old man revealed were all Divine Treasures, and he could only imagine what kind of treasures resided within the bamboo chest!

The bamboo chest!

It was a regret for Snowy!

Just thinking about how unhappy Snowy had been that day made Yang Ye grin. He restrained his thoughts and gazed at Wu Ni, “Senior, when will she be back?”

Wu Ni replied, “She’ll be back when she thinks she has overcome herself. Of course, she may never come back.”

Yang Ye asked, “It’s dangerous, right?”

Wu Ni nodded.

Yang Ye didn’t say anything else because he believed in her!

Because he had to wait for her, Yang Ye settled down on the cliff. Wu Ni paid no attention to him either. After all, he’d received Wu Ni’s acknowledgement. As far as an expert like Wu Ni was concerned, he would absolutely not allow his disciple to be with someone mediocre, but he was very well aware it was very beneficial to know even more experts on the path of cultivation!

Friends!

Everyone needed friends!

Yang Ye was no weakling. Since Yang Ye wasn’t mediocre, he naturally wouldn’t object to their relationship.

Yang Ye just cultivated every day!

He cultivated like a madman!

If he encountered anything he didn’t understand while cultivating, he would seek guidance from the old man, Wu Ni. In the beginning, the old man really wasn’t interested, but after Yang Ye constantly disturbed him for answers, Wu Ni provided Yang Ye with guidance from time to time. Yang Ye undoubtedly gained tremendously during this period.

At the peak of the cliff, Yang Ye stood by its side while the Sword Gourd hung by his waist.

During this time, he’d been constantly training with the Sword Gourd! Now, he could use it to instantly kill a Limitbreaker Realm expert who was 500km away, but it only worked on One World Realm experts!

It wasn’t fast or strong enough for Two World Realm experts!

He had to improve his speed and strength to his current limits!

At the edge of the cliff, Yang Ye closed his eyes and focused in a meditative state. Meanwhile, Snowy appeared on Yang Ye’s shoulder. She’d been in deep sleep throughout this time, and she’d finally awakened now.

When she noticed that Yang Ye was cultivating, Snowy wrapped her claws around Yang Ye’s head and rubbed her head against his. After that, she didn’t disturb him further. She leaped off his shoulder and went to the table where the two old men were playing GO.

They usually took around a month to finish a single game!

Snowy stood by the board and glanced at the white pieces before glancing at the black pieces.

The old men were in a critical moment of their game, so while they knew a little fellow was by their side, they didn’t pay the little fellow any attention.

Snowy glanced for a while and felt that it was quite boring, and then she suddenly looked off into the distance. A moment later, she leaped down to the area behind the cliff, and a beast was lying deep within the grass over there.

The beast looked like a Qilin, and it had a very long horn on its head. Besides that, its limbs were very thick like iron pillars, and its tail was very, very long like a python. But the most striking feature was its claws. Every one of the claws on its limbs were exceedingly long and so sharp they could tear through anything!

Snowy blinked as she gazed at it, and then she leaped over to it. The beast was clearly sleeping.

Snowy seemed to have thought of something and suddenly withdrew a small piece of fruit. It was the fruit that the old man with a bamboo chest had given to her. She’d given half of the 2nd fruit to Zi’er, and she had another half left. This was part of that half, but it was merely a tenth of that half!

Once Snowy withdrew the piece of fruit, the beast before her immediately opened its eyes, and its gaze instantly fell on the fruit. However, just a moment later, it gazed at Snowy, and then it was stunned.

Snowy blinked, and then she cracked a smile at it before offering the fruit to the beast.

It glanced at the fruit, gazed at Snowy, and then opened its mouth and started communicating with Snowy.

Many beasts could speak the human tongue, but Snowy was no human. So, it didn’t use the human tongue to speak to Snowy!

It was asking if the fruit was really for it!

Snowy nodded, and then she lifted the fruit toward the beast to indicate that it was true.

The beast hesitated for a moment, and then it sucked the piece of fruit into its stomach. After that, it immediately stood up.

Rumble!

At the instant it stood up, the area started to tremble violently.

Meanwhile, Wu Ni stopped what he was doing and glanced over in Snowy’s direction, “What’s that little fellow doing?”

Martial Ancestor chuckled casually, “What else? Playing!”

He placed a piece down as he spoke.

Wu Ni nodded. He didn’t say another word and just put a piece down as well.

After it swallowed the piece of fruit, it looked down at Snowy with a gaze filled with gratefulness.

Meanwhile, Snowy flew up to it, and then she pointed at the horn on its head. She was asking if she could touch it!

It hesitated for a moment and nodded.

Snowy cracked a smile, and then she touched it lightly.

Just like that, they could be considered to have become acquainted.

A short while later, Snowy blinked, and then she started waving her paws swiftly. She was inviting the beast into the Primordial Pagoda to play with her, and she kept telling it how great it was within the pagoda…

The beast glanced at the two old men in the distance and was quite hesitant. However, Snowy grabbed it by the horn and pulled it in Yang Ye’s direction.

When it noticed that both the old men didn’t object to this, it just allowed Snowy to pull it away.

It didn’t take long for Snowy to pull it into the Primordial Pagoda!

In the Primordial Pagoda, the beast sized up the surroundings while Snowy summoned Oxxy, the Primal True Dragon, and the Primal Vicious Tiger over. The beast’s eyes instantly narrowed slightly when it saw these demons, and its eyes were filled with vigilance and warning!

Hostility!

It was especially so when the beast saw the Primal True Dragon, the hostility in its eyes grew! It was hostility born from natural vigilance.

The Primal Dragon glanced at the beast and moved its gaze away.

Besides Snowy and that unreasonable little girl, Erya, the Primal True Dragon feared no one within this world!

Actually, if it wasn't for the fact that Oxxy had been constantly telling it to keep a low profile, it would have attacked the beast by now!

When had the dragons ever feared anyone?

Right, Snowy and Erya were exceptions!

Snowy had clearly noticed the atmosphere here. So, she mediated by making all of them shake their paws to display that they were friends from now on!

Oxxy was the first to join in support. He walked over to the beast, nodded slightly to it as a form of greeting, and then he went behind Snowy. While Oxxy’s cultivation was low, the beast noticed the axe on Oxxy’s back, so it had quite a solemn expression on its face. It hesitated for a moment and nodded to Oxxy.

The Primal Vicious Tiger gave Snowy face as well. It nodded to the beast, and the beast nodded slightly in response.

Only the Primal True Dragon remained!

Snowy gazed at the dragon, and it felt quite helpless. It had to give Snowy face or it would become the common enemy of everyone here. The Primal True Dragon glanced at the beast and nodded as a form of greeting.

Since the Primal True Dragon had displayed amiability, the beast naturally discarded its hostility and nodded slightly.

After all, the Primal True Dragon wasn’t any lower in status to it!

“Snowy!” Suddenly, Erya’ voice resounded.

The Primal True Dragon shuddered and vanished on the spot. Now that Erya had obtained that tombstone, she’d become beyond terrifying!

Snowy turned around, and she saw Erya walking in her direction while licking a tanghulu.

As soon as it saw Erya, the beast’s expression instantly changed, and its hairs stood on end as if it was facing a powerful enemy!

Erya walked over to Snowy and lifted the tanghulu to her, the latter stretched out her tongue and licked it. However, Snowy felt that wasn’t enough, so she took it from Erya and started licking it herself.

Erya didn’t mind. She just gazed at the beast, sized it up, and said, “Is this a new recruit of yours? Hmm, not bad. It should be quite good at fighting. Oh, right. Snowy, can you tell Big Brother Yang that I’m very hungry. I’m really very hungry. Now, I even feel like eating Oxxy!”

Cold sweat immediately surged out of Oxxy!
