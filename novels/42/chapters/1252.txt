Chapter 1253 – A Debt Of Blood Must Be Repaid With Blood!

The Quasi Returnal Rank!

Yang Ye had no intention to exchange countless blows with the old man. He was just a mid-rank Saint while the old man was a Voider. A battle of attrition? Only a fool would do that!

If he didn’t choose a battle of attrition, then he had no choice but to utilize his greatest trump card.

He had 2 trump cards like that. One was his Rebirth Rank sword intent at the brink, and the second was the Sword God’s Seal that he’d just obtained.

He’d decided to utilize the Sword God’s Seal because he wanted to see Quasi Returnal Rank sword intent!

Rebirth Rank sword intent was almost the same as the aura of Voiders, but Quasi Returnal Rank sword intent far surpassed the aura of Voiders. As soon as Quasi Returnal Rank sword intent appeared here, the old man’s aura was instantly pushed back into his body.

In the air. Yang Ye suddenly slapped the huge blood red sword, and it shook violently before shooting down at the old man.

There was a muddled expression in the old man’s eyes as he gazed at the huge blood red sword, “How could this be possible? That isn’t sword intent above the Void Rank! How could this be possible?”

Even though Rebirth Rank sword intent was a threat to him, it was just a threat. But this sword intent Yang Ye emanated wasn’t just a threat, it felt impossible to resist.

It was absolutely crushing!

It was completely crushing him!

As the huge sword grew closer and closer to the old man, the powerful pressure of the sword intent and terrifying strength of the sword energy within it had locked onto the old man. Even the space around the old man started to warp before them, and the old man’s body actually started to show faint signs of warping. It seemed like he would be obliterated in a moment!

“NO!!!” The old man howled with fury while ferocity crept up on his face. He unfurled his fists and twisted them slightly. This movement seemed to extract something from his surroundings, and the scene around him instantly changed.

“Firmament Palm!” The old man shouted with fury as a practically translucent palm carried a terrifying aura and swept forward to collide with Yang Ye’s sword.

Bang!

It sounded like spring thunder rumbling through the sky. The space throughout the surroundings was shattered, but it didn’t take long for a mysterious force to repair it in an instant. But just a moment later, the space there cracked apart once more!

After shattering and being repaired around 10 times in succession, the space there finally returned to normal. However, countless waves of energy and powerful sword energy were shooting incessantly throughout the area. But when the waves of energy and sword energy struck those pavilions in the surroundings, the pavilions would instantly emanate faint light that obstructed the sword energy and waves of energy. So, the surroundings were damaged by Yang Ye and the old man!

Once the waves of energy and sword energy lessened, Yun Banqing suddenly ran out of Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, and she immediately stopped moving when she saw the scene before her eyes.

There were 2 people standing not too far away from her. They were naturally the old man and Yang Ye, and numerous swords were scattered all around them.

The old man stared blankly ahead and said, “How strong.”

As soon as he finished speaking, his right hand moved slightly, and a talisman appeared in his grasp. A moment later, it transformed into a ray of light that entered the space before him, “Yang Ye....”

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man’s body started to turn ethereal, and it slowly turned more and more ethereal. A few moments later, the old man’s body vanished.

He was dead!

Yun Banqing wasn’t delighted at all by the sight of this, and her face became extremely solemn instead.

Suddenly, Yang Ye fell to the ground, and he held his head with both hands as he slammed it incessantly against the ground, gradually forming numerous small depressions in the ground.

Yun Banqing’s expression changed. She hurriedly ran over to Yang Ye. Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “Don’t... don’t come near me!”

Yun Banqing stopped moving, and her voice trembled as she said, “Are....”

Yang Ye didn’t speak, and he just slammed his head incessantly against the ground. Once he completely smashed apart an area, he moved to a different area, and it didn’t take long for small depressions to fill the surroundings.

Backlash!

He was suffering backlash from his sword intent!

He’d utilized the Sword God’s Seal to forcefully improve his sword intent to the Quasi Returnal Rank in order to kill the old man, but he hadn’t expected that it actually came with backlash. His sword intent was naturally not at the Quasi Returnal Rank, so once it dropped back down to the Rebirth Rank, the backlash came right after. It was like a person who could only run for 10 laps around the field had utilized external forces to make himself run 50 laps around the field.

So, there was a problem! Once the effects of the external force vanished, the body would naturally suffer backlash. Because 50 laps weren’t something the body could endure at all.

Now, he was in a similar state.

There was one thing different about backlash of sword intent when compared to physical backlash. Physical backlash caused pain throughout the body, but backlash of sword intent affected his mind and soul. So, such pain was overwhelming!

Now, he just wanted to lose consciousness!

But the sad thing was that he couldn’t fall unconscious at all.

If he had a choice, he would definitely not choose to forcefully improve his sword intent to the Quasi Returnal Rank. Because it was truly worse than dying. It was like someone was burning his mind and soul with a torch!

Such pain lasted an entire day and night!

A day later. Yang Ye was lying on the ground with Yun Banqing by his side. At this moment, Yang Ye’s countenance was ghastly pale as if it had no blood within it, and his body was twitching from time to time. However, he was much better than before. Earlier, he’d been ceaselessly slamming his head against the ground, and he’d even raised his sword to strike his head on many occasions. Fortunately, his head was hard enough and wasn’t damaged!

Of course, the main reason was that his mind was still clear. Otherwise, if he really used Rebirth Rank sword intent to strike his head, his head would have been chopped off a long time ago.

Meanwhile, Yun Banqing just gazed at Yang Ye from the side, and no one knew what she was thinking.

After quite some time passed, Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes. Yun Banqing hurriedly went over to him and said, “How are you feeling?”

Yang Ye glanced at her, and he revealed a smile on his pale face, “I’m alright....”

He was about to stand up as he spoke, but his body merely moved slightly and wasn’t able to stand up. Because he actually noticed that he didn’t have an ounce of strength in him!

He was exhausted!

That attack had instantly exhausted all his profound energy, and because of the backlash he suffered, even his body was severely exhausted beyond its limits.

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, withdrew some violet crystals, and swallowed them. As the spirit energy surged into his body, his countenance started to take a turn for the better.

After around an hour passed, the color on Yang Ye’s face was practically normal, and his body was almost completely healed with the help of the Primordial Violet Energy he possessed.

Yang Ye stood up, glanced at the swords scattered in the surroundings, and then fell silent.

It could be said that there was a huge gap between him and Voiders. Even though he’d killed the old man, it didn’t mean anything. Because he’d relied on the Sword God’s Seal. Regardless of whether it was the Quasi Returnal Rank sword intent or the Sky Eradicator formation, they both didn’t belong to him.

External sources of strength!

To be precise, it wasn’t his own strength that he’d relied on to kill the old man. Because his own strength wasn’t sufficient to kill a Voider without the Sword God’s Seal.

Yang Ye shook his head, restrained his thoughts, waved his right hand, and gathered all the swords in the surroundings. After that, he waved his right hand once more, and the treasures he obtained earlier within the pavilion appeared before him. Yang Ye glanced at them and noticed that there actually were 30 Emperor Rank swords. Coupled with the Emperor Rank swords from before, he had 78 of them now.

78 Emperor Rank swords!

Yang Ye felt his heartbeat speed up. After all, they weren’t at the Quasi Emperor Rank but the actual Emperor Rank. If Qin Zhuyao and the others were given these swords, then their strengths would definitely rise a level.

Besides those 30 swords, there were 10 sword wings and 10 sword armors. All of them at the Emperor Rank!

However, they weren’t up to his standards! Now, he was only interested in Void Rank treasures! It couldn’t be helped, he was used to utilizing Void Rank treasures, so he wasn’t really interested in Emperor Rank treasures.

After he put them away, Yang Ye flipped his palm once more, and a palm-sized dark blue shield appeared there.

This shield was the same shield Yuan Qiubai had protected himself with during the previous battle, and it had given Yang Ye a huge headache. Fortunately, he had the Head Snatch technique. Otherwise, he would really be helpless against Yun Qiubai. After all, it could even stop his Death by a Thought technique, so it was obvious that ordinary Heavenrends wouldn’t be a match for it at all. Unless he executed the true form of Heavenrend or utilized the Sword God’s Seal! Otherwise, Yuan Qiubai was practically invincible!

Yang Ye sized it up before dropping a drop of his Blood Essence on it. As soon as the Blood Essence entered it, the Phantom Shield instantly trembled violently before transforming into a ray of light that entered Yang Ye’s body. At the same time, Yang Ye sensed a connection form between him and it.

Void Rank treasures had a temper of their own, and they would definitely not submit with ease. However, no matter how great its temper was, it would lose it all before the tiny vortex. He’d tossed the Phantom Shield into the tiny vortex to deal with its temper. Now, it seemed like his plan was very successful because it hadn’t resisted at all!

Yang Ye studied it for a while and faintly understood why it was called the Phantom Shield. Because it had fused completely with his body, and so long as a part of his body was attacked, it would immediately appear there. It could be said that he wouldn’t have to fear surprise attacks while he possessed this shield.

Of course, it could be used outside of his body as well.

Yang Ye issued a command in his heart, and then a dark blue shield instantly appeared before him. The shield was only half his height, around half a meter wide, and completely dark blue.

It wasn’t like the blood red shield that had to be controlled by its user. The Phantom Shield could be commanded with the heart. For example, just a single command in the heart would make it appear where he wanted it to appear. So, it could be said to be much more convenient and effective than the blood red shield.

Yang Ye smiled and put it away. Suddenly, the space in the area where the old man had died a day ago had suddenly started to ripple.

A voice transmission? Yang Ye frowned. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

It didn’t take long for a voice to resound from there, “A debt of blood must be repaid with blood!”
