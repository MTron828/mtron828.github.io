Chapter 1027 – Light Maiden!

Yang Ye’s group of 3 arrived at an abyss under Yeman’s lead.

Yang Ye squatted down at the edge of it. The abyss was filled with rising mist, and he couldn’t see the bottom of it.

Yang Ye gazed at Yeman, and Yeman instantly shuddered in response before quickly starting to mumble to Shuai Wenyang.

A short while passed before Shuai Wenyang spoke solemnly, “He said that it’s down there!”

Down there? Yang Ye frowned.

Meanwhile, the woman on Yang Ye’s back spoke abruptly, “There’s something strange about this place!”

Yang Ye nodded with agreement. He couldn’t tell what was strange about it, but his intuition told him that there was something strange. Or to be more precise, his intuition told him that it was dangerous.

Suddenly, Shuai Wenyang spoke, “Didn’t you want to know how to leave this place?”

“How?” Yang Ye gazed at Shuai Wenyang and said, “You’re saying that it’s down there?”

Shuai Wenyang pondered deeply for an instant and said, “I’m not completely certain!”

Yang Ye asked, “What do you mean?”

Shuai Wenyang spoke solemnly, “I’m very sensitive to energy, and I’m only able to sense fluctuations of energy here throughout this damnable place. If I’m not wrong, then there should be a teleportation formation down there. But I’m not absolutely sure the fluctuations of energy are coming from a teleportation formation! I’ve wanted to head down there and have a look, but I didn’t dare to because my intuition told me that I would definitely die if I headed down there!”

“That fellow said the Adamantium Fruits are down there. In other words, he has gone down there!” Yang Ye suddenly said, “Ask him what’s down there!”

Shuai Wenyang and Yeman mumbled for quite some time before Shuai Wenyang spoke in a low voice, “He says that he usually doesn’t dare go down there, and he only heads down to gather Adamantium Fruits at a specific time.”

Yang Ye frowned, “A specific time?”

Shuai Wenyang gazed at Yang Ye, “Remember that furious roar you heard earlier?”

Yang Ye nodded. He hadn’t forgotten it, of course. Actually, he couldn’t forget it because that roar which came from so far away had caused him to bleed from all 7 apertures.

Shuai Wenyang spoke in a low voice, “That beast alternates between staying awake and sleeping for 10 years. Its roar represents that it has awakened. Yeman always waits for it to fall into deep sleep before he heads down there. But it’s awake now!”

Should I head down there or not? At this moment, Yang Ye was hesitating. He hadn’t laid eyes on the beast, but he was able to sense how formidable it was. If he was being honest, he didn’t have the slightest confidence to face that ferocious beast.

But if he didn’t head down there now, then could it be that he would have to wait another 10 years?

10 years? Yang Ye shook his head. Not to mention 10 years, he couldn’t even wait a year. Regardless of whether it was for Yu Wushuang, Ocean of Clouds Academy, An Nanjing, or Mu Hanshan, all of them needed him right now. If he waited for 10 more years, he truly didn’t dare to imagine what would happen to all of them.

Of course, he couldn’t just head down rashly. Even if he was heading down there, he had to have a sound plan. After all, there was a terrifying beast down there!

Yang Ye asked the woman, “Do you have any ideas?” At this moment, he hoped that she had a good way for him to get down there.

Unfortunately, she disappointed him.

She replied flatly, “I don’t.”

Yang Ye’s face fell. Because if even she didn’t have a way to get down there safely, then how could he? Do I really have no choice but to just head down there and risk my life against that ferocious beast?

Meanwhile, Shuai Wenyang pointed at Yeman who was lying on the ground, “What do we do with this fellow?”

The woman said, “Kill him!”

Yang Ye glanced at Yeman and shook his head. He just had to offend that woman. Isn’t that no different than courting death?

Yang Ye walked over to Yeman, and the latter seemed to know what Yang Ye intended to do. He roared furiously and used his last remaining strength to slam his body towards Yang Ye. However, he’d only just stood up when Yang Ye kicked him into the abyss.

All 3 of them looked at the abyss.

“AH!!” A long time passed before Yeman’s shrill and miserable cry resounded from within the abyss, and his voice contained boundless terror!

Yang Ye and Shuai Wenyang instantly revealed solemn expressions.

“Roar!” Meanwhile, a roar suddenly shot up into the air and pierced the sky!

Om!

Yang Ye’s felt dizzy while he instantly bled from all 7 apertures! Besides that, he felt his soul tremble from deep within!

Crack!

The ground around them instantly cracked apart. At the same time, a towering mountain over 3,000km away from them suddenly exploded apart, and countless rocks rained down from above while dust filled the air!

A long time passed before the dizziness in Yang Ye’s head faded. He exchanged glances with Shuai Wenyang, yet he noticed that while Shuai Wenyang’s face was slightly pale, Shuai Wenyang wasn’t bleeding!

Shuai Wenyang seemed to know what Yang Ye was curious about and said, “While my strength has been sealed in this place, my soul is very strong. That roar actually acts against the soul. You know, while your strength is extremely formidable, your cultivation in the soul is quite weak. In the Central Divine Prefecture, there’s practically no genius that doesn’t place emphasis on the cultivation of the soul. Because once you encounter an expert who attacks the soul and your soul is weak, then it’s very likely that you’ll be killed in an instant!”

“He’s right!” Meanwhile, the woman suddenly added, “You’re really weak when it comes to the soul, and it’s very easy for you to suffer a loss when you encounter attacks to the soul like soundwaves!”

“Thank you for the guidance!” Yang Ye nodded and expressed his gratitude. Actually, after he witnessed the strength of Lu Wan’er’s sword soul technique, he knew that he was very weak in that aspect. If it was at any other ordinary time, he would naturally not fear ordinary attacks to his soul as he possessed Void Rank sword intent to protect himself. However, once he didn’t have it like this very moment, he was practically unable to resist such attacks to the soul! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“That fellow down there isn’t something we can go up against right now!” Meanwhile, Shuai Wenyang spoke solemnly, “I don’t know why it can’t come out here, but based on the current circumstances, we’ll definitely die if we head down there!”

Suddenly, the woman on Yang Ye’s back warned, “Watch out!”

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted when he heard her, and then 5 shadowy figures flashed out from his shadow and stood on guard around him. At the same time, a black robed figure suddenly appeared not too far away from him.

The black robed figure said, “It really is the Laws of Darkness!”

The voice was clear, melodious, yet low. It belonged to a woman!

Yang Ye gazed at Shuai Wenyang, but the latter shook his head, “I never imagined that other humans existed in this damnable place.”

The black robed figure suddenly asked, “Why do you possess the Laws of Darkness?”

“I comprehended it!” Yang Ye continued, “You were the one who brought these shadowy figures here, right?”

“You comprehended it?” The black robed figure fell silent after she finished speaking.

Yang Ye asked, “Is there a problem?”

The black robed woman suddenly asked, “Do you know Shadow Maiden?”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. He naturally knew Shadow Maiden because he’d killed her. Who is she?

Yang Ye pondered deeply for an instant and spoke solemnly, “I’ve naturally heard of the Nether Pavilion’s Shadow Maiden, but I don’t know her.”

The black robed woman replied, “I feel that no one besides Shadow Maiden should possess the Laws of Darkness. What do you think?”

Yang Ye’s face fell, “I think that you’re talking nonsense. What do you think?” As soon as he finished speaking, those 5 shadowy figures around him shot explosively towards the black robed woman.

Crack! Crack!

Suddenly, a few clear and melodious sounds of cracking resounded, and then Yang Ye and Shuai Wenyang watched with astonishment as the heads of those shadowy figures were cracked into pieces.

It was too mysterious and too terrifying!

Both Yang Ye and Shuai Wenyang were astounded!

“Light Blades!” Meanwhile, the woman on Yang Ye’s back suddenly said, “You’re the Nether Pavilion’s Light Maiden!”

The Light Maiden! Yang Ye’s pupils constricted. Because she was actually a member of the Nether Pavilion, and she was one of their monstrous geniuses!

The black clothed woman who was about to continue attacking suddenly stopped. Even though Yang Ye couldn’t see her face, he felt that the woman’s gaze had descended onto the woman on his back.

Light Maiden spoke in a low voice, “Who are you!?”

The woman didn’t answer Light Maiden, she just lowered her head closer to Yang Ye’s ear and said, “Jump down there!”

Yang Ye was stunned! Jump down there? Jump down the abyss? Is she serious?

The woman spoke in a tone that was slightly more serious, “Jump down right now if you don’t want to die!”

Yang Ye’s heart shook when he heard her. He knew that she wasn’t joking. So he just hesitated for an instant before he instantly leaped down the abyss.

Shuai Wenyang was stunned on the spot, and Light Maiden was slightly stunned as well.

Obviously, both of them hadn’t expected Yang Ye and the woman to just jump down like that.

Shuai Wenyang glanced at the black robed woman, glanced at the abyss, and didn’t choose to jump down in the end.

“I surrender!” Shuai Wenyang raised his hands and said, “I really surrender!”

Light Maiden paid no attention to him and just walked over to the edge of the abyss!

Roar!

Suddenly, another furious roar resounded from within the abyss.

At this moment, the entire ground and world trembled!
