Chapter 2514 – Fine! I’ll Stay!

Yang Ye stopped in midair within the city, and Mo Ya had a solemn expression on her face as she stood behind him.

There was a young man in front of them. The young man’s upper body was bare, and he only had a pair of black trousers on. He seemed extremely robust.

Of course, he was no person, it was a demon!

The man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Interesting. It’s the first time I’m seeing someone leave the city out in the open. What? You want to challenge my demon race?”

Yang Ye grinned, “I just want to take a friend out of the city, that’s all!”

“Outside?” The man chuckled, “It depends on whether you have the ability to do so.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand!”

As he spoke, he gazed at Mo Ya, “You leave first!”

She was stunned. She glanced at the surroundings and was about to speak when Yang Ye said, “Go!”

She had quite a strange expression on her face, and she wondered if Yang Ye hadn’t noticed how many demons were staring at them! Leave? How?

Yang Ye said, “Just go!”

She hesitated for a moment and nodded, and then she walked toward the city gates.

The young man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he waved his right hand. A demon beast immediately charged at Mo Ya.

Mo Ya made a light grasping motion when she saw it charge at her, and a sword appeared in her grasp. She was about to attack when a flying sword flashed by her eyes.

Hiss!

The demon’s head flew up into the air.

Blood sprayed out like a magnificent fountain!

This scene shocked all the demons here.

The young man frowned. He’d seen Yang Ye’s attack, but it was too quick, so quick that he hadn’t been able to stop it at all!

It was too swift!

The young man’s face became much more solemn!

Mo Ya glanced at Yang Ye and continued toward the city’s gates.

Countless demon beasts watched with a ferocious glow in their eyes. If that human were to just swagger out of the city, it would be a huge humiliation to the demon race!

The young man gazed at Yang Ye. Suddenly, he raised his hand, and then numerous Four World Realm demon beasts leaped up and charged at Mo Ya.

At the same time, the young man shot at Yang Ye, and a wave of powerful pressure instantly enveloped Yang Ye.

However, along with a ray of sword energy, the young man was blasted all the way out of the city! Meanwhile, the demon beasts’ bodies were still charging at Mo Ya, but their heads were gone.

The headless demon beasts charged at her while spraying blood all over their path.

Countless demons were horrified by the sight of this!

All the demon beasts hadn’t been able to see how those demons had lost their heads!

Mo Ya glanced at Yang Ye again, and then he quickly strode out of the city. This time, no demon beast obstructed her path. However, right when she was about to leave the city, a one-armed man appeared above the city wall.

The demon beasts lowered themselves before the man.

Mo Ya’s face instantly became solemn because the one-armed man felt extremely dangerous to her!

The one-armed man glanced at Yang Ye, “Among the human experts are the Ye Clan’s Ye Zhibei, the Xing Clan’s Xing Biqing, the Leng Clan’s Leng Ao, the Lu Clan’s Lu Jue, the Ancient Sword Sect’s Gu Nie, and two other independent cultivators. But you are none of them.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “The Ancient Sword Sect! Ye Yang!”

The Ancient Sword Sect!

The one-armed man glanced at the corpses in the surroundings and said, “A life for a life. That’s what you humans like to say. I think it makes sense. What do you think?”

Yang Ye smiled, “You must first realize that you were trying to kill us, and it wasn’t the other way around. I was just exercising my right to self-defense, and that isn’t illegal, is it?”

The one-armed man grinned, “I think we should just fight!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Same here.”

The one-armed man took a step forward. At this moment, it felt like the area shook before him! A moment later, a wave of powerful pressure swept out from him.

A peak Five World Realm demon beast!

The one-armed man slammed a punch at Yang Ye from afar!

The space between them rippled while powerful strands of energy pierced through space and swept down toward Yang Ye!

Yang Ye was visibly moved. The might of this punch made him feel like the world was pressing down upon him!

It was very overbearing and powerful!

Yang Ye didn’t retreat. He took a step forward instead and swung his sword!Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Nine swings with the Sword Domain!

Once the final swing descended…

Hiss!

A huge rift suddenly appeared in the air above the battlefield. Yang Ye’s attack had sliced space open! And it had sliced open the might of the man’s punch as well.

The man’s eyes narrowed slightly from the sight of this. He was about to attack when two flying swords shot at him!

They were extremely fast to the point he hadn’t even been able to react before they cut through the sides of his throat.

However, they hadn’t been able to cut through his skin!

The one-armed man had forcefully resisted this attack!

Yang Ye frowned slightly, and he summoned the swords back into the Sword Gourd.

The one-armed man wiped his throat. While there was no blood there, there were two marks there!

A moment of silence ensued, and then the one-armed man suddenly charged at Yang Ye. Meanwhile, Yang Ye flicked a huge seal at the one-armed man!

The Universe Seal!

The seal contained the strength to destroy five worlds!

The one-armed man didn’t try to dodge away from this, and he just slammed his fist at the seal!

Bang!

Their attacks exploded apart on collision. The one-armed man was pushed backward repeatedly while Yang Ye’s Universe Seal was blasted away as well, and it was almost blasted off into the sky!

But it didn’t take long for the seal to return to Yang Ye.

At the same time, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

A moment later, a sword slashed down at the one-armed man from above!

Yang Ye didn’t use Executor. But this time, he used his bloodline. With the power of his bloodline, the strength of his attacks rose by another level.

The one-armed man wasn’t afraid of him at all and just slammed a punch at him!

Bang!

Yang Ye’s sword descended, and the one-armed man was blasted around 300m back. Meanwhile, Yang Ye was blasted away as well, but it only took a moment for a huge seal to slam down from above the one-armed man!

Bang!

The one-armed man was slammed to the ground!

As soon as that happened, Yang Ye appeared before him. At the same time, two flying swords arrived before him.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Along with a few explosions, the one-armed man was blasted out of the city. Meanwhile, a few rays of sword energy shot out of the city, and they were so fast that all of them struck the one-armed man.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Along with multiple explosions, the one-armed man was pushed back repeatedly. When the final ray of sword energy vanished, he was over 1km away, and there were no less than 10 bloody injuries on him!

Obviously, his body wasn’t capable of fully resisting Yang Ye’s attacks!

At this moment, Yang Ye and Mo Ya were outside the city and were standing at its entrance. But there were countless demon beasts eying them ferociously from the surroundings.

While the strength Yang Ye revealed was extremely formidable, it was obvious that they didn’t want to just let Yang Ye and Mo Ya go. If they were allowed to leave, wouldn’t the demon race be utterly humiliated?

It was a slap to their face!

Yang Ye glanced at the demons in the surroundings and said, “You don’t want me to leave? Then bring it!”

Bang!

The one-armed man suddenly shot at Yang Ye, and a wave of powerful energy erupted like a volcano, causing the world to shake before it.

Yang Ye grinned at the sight of this, but it was an icy cold arc on his lips. A moment later, he drew his sword and swung it, and his sword struck directly against the one-armed man’s fist. As soon as they collided, the space here shook violently, and then it started to crack apart all around them!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye and the one-armed man hadn’t moved backward at all!

They were locked in combat!

However, the space around them was trembling violently and seemed as if it would collapse at any moment!

Yang Ye and the one-armed man’s gazes met, and then Yang Ye stomped his right foot down.

Hiss!

Yang Ye’s sword sliced through the one-armed man’s fist. However, as soon as it did that, the one-armed man pulled his hand back and slammed his body at Yang Ye!

A head-on collision with brute force!

Yang Ye was facing a powerful demon beast, so he would naturally not go head-on against his opponent with just his physical body. At the instant the one-armed man slammed himself at Yang Ye, Yang Ye had moved sideways and dodged it. At the same time, two flying swords shot out from the Sword Gourd.

Hiss! Hiss!

The two flying swords left many bloody marks on the one-armed man’s body!

However, none of them were lethal!

Yang Ye put his sword away and glanced at the surroundings. At this moment, the one-armed man and the other demons were looking at him, and there was vicious killing intent in their eyes!

Yang Ye’s gaze gradually became icy cold from the sight of this, “I’ll ask you one last time! Are you going to let me go?”

Because of Snowy, Zi’er, Erya, Oxxy, and the others, he never had any adverse feelings toward demon beasts. So, he never took the initiative to slaughter them and take their inner cores.

However, just as he’d always said, if humans tried to kill him, he would kill humans; if demons tried to kill him, he would kill demons!

The demons remained silent, but their auras swept out and locked onto Yang Ye and Mo Ya!

Obviously, they’d given him their answer!

Yang Ye nodded, and then he walked toward the city, “Fine! I’ll stay! Since you want to play, I’ll play with you!”
