Chapter 2591

The middle aged sword cultivator turned around and walked away after leaving those words. However, a middle aged man in a violet robe appeared before him just a short while later.

It was the Yin Lord!

The Yin World’s forces weren’t weak, and coupled with the help of the Eternal Lord, it wasn’t difficult to locate a sword cultivator. Especially when the sword cultivator wasn’t trying to conceal his tracks.

Of course, they knew nothing about him.

The middle aged sword cultivator glanced at the Yin Lord and remained silent.

The Yin Lord waved his right hand, and then cold winds formed Yang Ye’s appearance.

The Yin Lord gazed at the sword cultivator, “Do you know him?”

The middle aged sword cultivator glanced at the portrait created from cold winds and nodded.

The Yin Lord walked slowly in his direction, “Shall we exchange a few blows?”

The sword cultivator glanced at him and shook his head slightly, “Just one is enough.”

The Yin Lord’s eyes narrowed slightly.

…

Paradise Island. Divine Above.

Yang Ye left the third floor and returned to the second floor, and he sat with the Ascetic and Elder Zhu again.

“The Desolate Emperor!” Elder Zhu suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, “That was the Desolate Emperor, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Yes!”

Elder Zhu nodded slightly, “I saw him once, a very, very long time ago.”

Yang Ye was quite curious, “Is he very famous?”

Elder Zhu smiled, “He isn’t just famous, he’s an extraordinary figure. I’m one of the few lucky people to have survived after meeting him in battle all those years ago. He reigned supreme over everyone at that time, and if it wasn’t for keeping the desolate race safe from annihilation, that war would have had no winner. Not only that, the experts of all the worlds would have been buried with him. If that happened, I can only imagine how many civilizations and inheritances would be lost forever!”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “I wonder if the world will be as lucky this time!”

All of them fell silent.

The enmity between the Eternal Kingdom and desolate race was no secret. While the Eternal Kingdom didn’t have the Sprite Progenitor now, it had been preparing for countless years. Moreover, it wasn’t arrogant as it had been, and Eternal Kingdom was getting help from others too. So, there were many variables in the war.

Meanwhile, the Ascetic smiled, “Let’s just drink!”

They continued drinking.

Suddenly, a middle aged man walked up the stairs behind Zuo Qing, and he was wearing a very ordinary and simple robe.

Zuo Qing was about to lead him up to the third floor when he suddenly stopped. He gazed at Yang Ye’s table, and his gaze descended upon Yang Ye.

The middle aged man grinned at the sight of Yang Ye and walked over, “I’m quite surprised!”

Yang Ye was a little puzzled, “You are…?”

The middle aged man smiled, “I’m a senior of Xing Biqing’s. She calls me uncle!”

Someone from the Xing Clan!

Yang Ye stood up and glanced at the man. Someone from the Xing Clan?

The middle aged man didn’t say anything and just went upstairs with Zuo Qing.

Meanwhile, the Ascetic suddenly smiled, “Young Brother, you aren’t ordinary!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Senior, I have a question. How do I make money here?”

He planned to just focus on leaving this place for now.

The Ascetic glanced at him, “You need money?”

Yang Ye smiled, “All my resources have been confiscated. I want to leave this place, so…”

The Ascetic hesitated for a moment and flicked a spatial ring over to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was about to speak when the Ascetic said, “Consider it a loan. You can return it to me when fate brings us together in the future. Don’t think about trying to earn Violetstar Crystals here. Even if there are places for that, they aren’t places you can go to right now.”

Yang Ye didn’t refuse and took it. After all, it was his own ability that enabled him to borrow money! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Around an hour later, Elder Zhu took his leave. He had to continue rowing the boat. As for the Ascetic, he chose to stay and take a look at the Divine Abode’s treasure.

He’d been invited because he was a merchant, and he possessed extensive knowledge.

A day later, Zuo Qing led Yang Ye and the Ascetic to an underground square. There were some people here, but their auras were restrained while some were even hidden in the shadows.

Zuo Qing explained to both of them, “Please don’t act rashly here. Take care!”

She turned around and left.

Yang Ye and the Ascetic found an empty spot. There was a tall platform at the center of the area, and it was empty right now.

People were coming in successively from the surroundings.

A long time passed before a man appeared on the platform.

He wore a moon yellow robe that emanated faint moonlight, and there was a symbol that seemed like a moon on his collar.

A Super Divine Treasure!

As soon as he saw the robe, Yang Ye’s first impression was that it was a Super Divine Treasure!

He gazed at the Ascetic, and the latter spoke with a solemn expression on his face, “The Moonlight Robe, a Super Divine Treasure, and not an ordinary one.”

Not an ordinary Super Divine Treasure!

Yang Ye looked up at the platform. The man glanced at the surroundings and nodded slightly, “Thank you for taking the time to come here, I’ll get straight to the point.”

He waved his right hand and a violet box appeared there.

He opened it to reveal a palm-sized fragment.

It was a crystalline and translucent fragment.

Based on its outer appearance, it should have been a pearl when it was whole.

Suddenly, Qi Bitian looked up from within the Primordial Pagoda, and she frowned upon seeing the fragment, “An inner core fragment…”

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

The man smiled on the platform, “My Divine Abode obtained this by chance. According to our analysis, it’s very likely to be the inner core of a demon beast. But after searching a myriad of universes, we haven’t been able to find any demon beast with an inner core like this.”

He grinned and continued, “Everyone here possesses vast knowledge. If anyone recognizes this and knows what demon beast it came from, we are willing to compensate you with a Super Divine Treasure!”

The Ascetic shook his head slightly, “Something feels a little off.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

The Ascetic said, “They are willing to pay a Super Divine Treasure to locate the owner of an inner core fragment. Do you think that’s normal?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Something is off. However, it has nothing to do with us.”

He didn’t recognize it, and no one else stepped forward either.

The min smiled, “Looks like no one recognizes it! It’s fine. We didn’t want to make you come here for nothing, so we have a few pretty good treasures to auction off. You can stay and have a look if you’re interested.”

The man left with the box.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye intended to leave. The Ascetic suddenly asked, “What? You’re not going to have a look?”

Yang Ye grinned, “I’m poor, so it doesn’t make a difference.”

The Ascetic smiled, “Then good luck. I’m going to see if there’s something good here!”

Yang Ye cupped his first, “Farewell!”

Once he finished speaking, he turned around and left.

Yang Ye left the Divine Abode. He didn’t stay on Paradise Island and took the boat back to the bridge.

Yang Ye didn’t know that Qi Bitian had vanished from the Primordial Pagoda.

Paradise Island.

A young girl entered the Divine Above. She went to the second floor, then the third. No one stopped her on her way.

At the third floor, the man in the Moonlight Robe suddenly looked at her, and she was just standing there.

It was Qi Bitian, of course!

The man glanced at her, and his eyes narrowed slightly, “Who are you?”

Qi Bitian walked over to the man, and there was a box before him.

She pointed at the box, “Where did you get it?”

The man smiled, “Can I refuse to answer you?”

Meanwhile, two black clothed figures appeared behind her.

She sat down, “I don’t have much time here. So, I hope you tell me what I want to know, and then I’ll take this box and leave.”

The man chuckled, “So you’re here to rob us.”

He patted the box lightly and said, “I wonder if you have the strength for that!”

Meanwhile, Qi Bitian waved her right hand.

Hiss! Hiss!

The black clothed figures exploded apart. In an instant, their bodies had been blasted into over 10,000 pieces!

However, their souls were intact. Obviously, Qi Bitian had held back.

The man’s pupils constricted, and they were filled with shock.

Qi Bitian ignored him. She took the box, opened it, glanced at the fragment, and spoke softly, “A third. If I can find the other two pieces, her inner core can be formed.”

She gazed at the man, “Do you know where the other two are?”

The man stared at her, “Y-You know who this fragment belongs to! Who are you?!”

Qi Bitian suddenly stood up, “Stop wasting time, and don’t say any useless things. Give me an answer.”

Meanwhile, a voice resounded, “Stealing isn’t a very good thing. Don’t you think so too?”

Qi Bitian sat down, “It belongs to a friend of mine. I’m just helping her retake what belongs to her.”

The voice said, “My Divine Abode can give it to you, but there’s a condition…”

Qi Bitian stood up and smiled, “You don’t have the right to speak about conditions with me.”

Meanwhile, a black spear appeared before Qi Bitian.

It was completely pitch black and covered in cracks.

Qi Bitian touched it lightly, “The energy of Destiny. Interesting. So, you’re someone who has fought Destiny. But…”

A blood red character suddenly appeared on Qi Bitian’s forehead.

Destiny!

A moment of silence ensued, and then the voice spoke once more, “Excuse my disrespect. You can take it whenever you want.”
