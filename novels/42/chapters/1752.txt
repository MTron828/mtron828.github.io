Chapter 1753 – I’ll Kill You!

As soon as Qiong Qi finished speaking, an ethereal black phoenix appeared behind Yang Lianshuang.

It wasn’t very large, but it emanated a terrifying aura that instilled fear in everyone.

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi’s eyes opened wide, and they were filled with disbelief, “How could this be..?”

At this moment, Yang Ye and Yang Xiang had stopped fighting too. Both of them were looking at the black phoenix behind Yang Lianshuang.

“Phoenix Transformation!” Qiong Qi stared at Yang Lianshuang, “It’s actually Phoenix Transformation! How did she do it?!”

Yang Ye gazed at Qiong Qi, “What is that?”

Qiong Qi spoke in a low voice, “The highest bond between a human and a member of the True Phoenixes. It’s the highest bond between us demons and humans as well. She obtained that Undying Black Phoenix’s acknowledgement, and it….”

Qiong Qi paused for a moment and continued, “That acknowledgement is like your relationship with that little fellow. A demon will only offer up itself when their relationship with a human is at a certain level…. That Undying Black Phoenix wasn’t just willing to let her devour it, it even offered up its soul to her, allowing her to be able to transform. I’ve rarely seen something like that happen throughout my lifetime!”

Yang Ye asked, “Is it powerful?”

Qiong Qi nodded, “Because it represents that she can merge with the strength of the Undying Black Phoenix. She probably hasn’t merged completely with it, but even then, the strength she has gained from it isn’t something any ordinary person can resist.”

Suddenly, Yang Lianshuang gazed at Qiong Qi, “You know a lot.”

Qiong Qi glanced at her, “Why would the extremely proud True Phoenix clan willingly sacrifice itself to you!”

Yang Lianshuang shook her head slightly, “It’s a long story, and I’m not willing to explain.” She gazed at Yang Ye, “Fight with me!”

She tapped her right foot down and transformed into a ray of black light that shot at Yang Xiang.

At the same time, an ear piercing phoenix cry resounded.

An instant later, she appeared in front of Yang Xiang, and then a black phoenix claw carried horrifying strength as it slapped down at Yang Xiang.

Yang Xiang’s expression changed at the sight of this, and then a silver spear appeared in his grasp before he stabbed it forward.

Bang!

A deafening explosion resounded, and then Yang Xiang was blasted 3km away. Numerous mouthfuls of blood sprayed from him once he stopped himself.

Everyone was shocked by this scene!

Yang Ye was quite shocked himself. The strength contained within Yang Lianshuang’s attack wasn’t weaker than his current strength. She was really strong!

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment, and then he restrained his thoughts before shooting off in Yang Xiang’s direction. Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang didn’t waste her breath and just transformed into a ray of black light that shot in Yang Xiang’s direction as well.

Yang Xiang’s eyes narrowed slightly when he saw both of them charge at him, and his eyes were filled with solemn expression. At this moment, he treated both of them as opponents on his level.

Yang Lianshuang and Yang Ye’s joint forces were indeed capable of posing a threat to him!

He didn’t dare act carelessly. Yang Xiang’s profound energy surged madly, and then a terrifying aura swept out from him. It was like a storm that raged in Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang’s direction.

Just his aura was naturally incapable of suppressing them, so countless spear images followed behind the aura!

Yang Ye tightened his grip on the wooden sword and swung it forward.

Hiss!

The aura was instantly sliced open, and the spear images in front of him were torn apart as well. An instant later, Yang Ye arrived in front of Yang Xiang.

Yang Lianshuang refused to put on a weaker display. She waved her claw, and it instantly tore apart the aura and spear images before her. After that, she appeared by Yang Ye’s side, raised her right hand, and slapped it at Yang Xiang.

Sword and claw!

A vicious glow flashed through Yang Xiang’s eyes, and then he held tightly onto his silver spear as he made a horizontal sweep with it.

Bang!

Space in a huge area trembled violently before this attack.

Bang! Bang!

Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang were blasted 3km away by the force within his attack, but Yang Xiang himself was blasted over 6km away by the force within Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang’s attacks.

However, Yang Xiang started laughing.

He laughed grimly as he gazed at Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang, “I have to admit that I’m truly helpless against your joint forces right now. But is that your own strength? It isn’t. Both of you possess strength that doesn’t belong to you, and that strength will vanish in the end. Once it does, how will you fight me?”

Their energy would vanish!

Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang exchanged glances and fell silent.

Because Yang Xiang was absolutely correct. They were using strength which didn’t belong to them, and it would vanish. Moreover, it would vanish soon. Especially Yang Ye, his body was on the verge of being unable to endure the energy within his right arm.

If the battle was dragged out, then one both his and Yang Lianshuang’s current strength vanished, they wouldn’t be a match for Yang Xiang anymore!

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Lianshuang suddenly took a deep breath, “Don’t hold back.”

She vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye tapped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that surged forward as well.

Once they joined forces, Yang Xiang was completely suppressed.

He was truly suppressed!

But anyone could see that while Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang were suppressing Yang Xiang in battle, they couldn’t kill him!

Yang Xiang was a 6th stage True Realm expert. Regardless of whether it was his combat instinct or the other aspects of his strength, they far surpassed Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang. So, while they could suppress him, they couldn’t kill him!

Once the battle dragged on until Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang’s boost in strength vanished, then even if a few more experts like them joined the battle, it still wouldn’t change anything.

Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang were naturally aware of that. So, they could be said to be using their full strength and strived to kill Yang Xiang before their strength was gone.

As for the other members of the Yang Clan, they could only watch. They weren’t able to join a battle of such a level.

As time trickled by, their hearts sunk further and further.

Because while Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang were constantly pushing Yang Xiang back, Yang Xiang was still alive. Moreover, they were naturally able to discern that something was off about Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang right now.

They knew that Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang may be about to hit their limits.

Their limits!

Once their current strength vanished, the situation would be turned around in an instant!

Bang!

After Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang blasted Yang Xiang back, they immediately stopped.

At this moment, Yang Ye’s countenance was pale, and his face was warped. As for Yang Lianshuang, her body was trembling, and she clearly didn’t look alright.

“What? You’re both out of tricks?” Suddenly, Yang Xiang laughed fiercely, “Are you starting to suffer backlash from all that energy?”

Yang Lianshuang gazed at Yang Ye, “What should we do?”

Yang Ye took a deep breath. He forcefully suppressed the raging energy within him and said, “Kill him, of course!”

Yang Lianshuang glanced at Yang Ye, “You’re a man. So you go first!”

Yang Ye turned to glance at her, “Ladies first. You go first!”

Yang Lianshuang fell silent for a moment and replied, “One of us must preserve their strength. Otherwise, even if we kill him, we’ll still be in danger. Do you understand what I mean?”

Yang Ye nodded. He naturally understood her. One of them had to preserve a certain level of their strength. Only then would they be truly safe. Because regardless of whether it was him or Yang Lianshuang, they didn’t dare to guarantee that the others in the Yang Clan didn’t have any other thoughts.

Besides that, there were the other clans. If the other clans took advantage of the situation, and both of them couldn’t fight another battle, then they would have no option but to wait for death to arrive.

Such a moment was a test of their trust.

Who would risk everything, and who would preserve their strength!

It was a huge problem!

Because even if the person who risked his or her life was able to kill Yang Xiang, that person would definitely end up completely exhausted and without the ability to fight another battle!

Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang exchanged glances, and it didn’t take long for Yang Lianshuang to say, “Then I’ll do it!”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “I’ll do it!”

If Yang Lianshuang didn’t say anything, then he would definitely not say anything as well. But Yang Lianshuang had. Since she had, he naturally had to as well. That was how he did things. If one treated sincerely, he would do the same; but if someone played tricks, then he would play tricks too!𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

There were no fools in this world.

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye started walking slowly in Yang Xiang’s direction, “I’ve killed many True Realm experts, but I’ve never killed a 6th stage True Realm expert. I’d like to try to accomplish that today!”

Bang!

As soon as he finished speaking, his body suddenly started to burn. Or to be more precise, his body was engulfed in flames.

The Divine Yin Flame!

Besides the Wargod’s arm and the wooden sword, he had another trump card, and it was the Divine Yin Flame!

Regardless of whether it was the Wargod’s arm, wooden sword, or the Divine Yin Flame, they couldn’t allow him to kill Yang Xiang on their own. Even two of them couldn’t allow him to accomplish that. But what about three?

The wooden sword didn’t reject the Divine Yin Flame, and it allowed the Divine Yin Flame to envelop it.

However, Yang Ye’s countenance turned even paler once the Divine Yin Flame appeared.

Three types of energy that surpassed the limits of his strength. At this moment, he felt like he was about to explode!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and gazed at Yang Xiang. He spoke fiercely, “Come! Take this!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a ray of flaming light flashed towards Yang Xiang!

Yang Xiang’s expression changed drastically, and he stabbed his silver spear forward.

Boom!

An explosion resounded. The silver spear in Yang Xiang’s grasp exploded into bits. At the same time, Yang Xiang was blasted extremely far back.

Crack!

As soon as he stopped himself, his body cracked open and countless strands of blood seeped out from him. After that, his body shattered. A moment later, his soul floated out, but it only took an instant for his soul to vanish in midair.

It was so fast that even Yang Lianshuang hadn’t been able to react to it!

Once Yang Xiang’s soul vanished, Yang Ye returned to normal, and the Divine Yin Flame returned to the Primordial Pagoda.

However, Yang Ye’s figure fell backwards.

But it only took a moment for Yang Ye to sense a wave of fragrance assaulting his nose, and then he felt himself fall into a soft embrace.

It was Yang Lianshuang’s arms, of course.

Yang Ye gazed at Yang Lianshuang in silence. It was because he didn’t even have the strength to spear right now.

Right when his eyes were about to shut, Yang Lianshuang’s right hand suddenly clamped down on his throat.

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Why?”

Yang Lianshuang looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “If I kill you, no one in the Yang Clan will be able to pose a threat to me.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she started squeezing down, and Yang Ye’s face turned purple.
