Chapter 1281 – I Can’t Stand The Sight Of You!

In the depths of an unknown mountain range, Yang Ye was lying on a huge smooth rock with his eyes closed. He’d fallen unconscious. A dense forest was on his left, and a lake was on his right. There was a waterfall at the end of the lake. Water was pouring down the mountain peak into the lake, causing water to spray incessantly towards the surroundings.

Qian Lankong was by Yang Ye’s side. At this moment, her gaze was on him.

As she gazed at him, Qian Lankong’s face was completely calm and emotionless, but tempestuous waves were surging through her heart. Yang Ye had killed the master of the Slayer Pavilion, an existence that she had to look up to in the past. She’d been in the Slayer Pavilion for countless years, but she’d never acted because she was very clearly aware of the strength that the master possessed.

Yet now, he was dead. He’d died at the hands of this man before her who was only a Quasi Emperor!

She’d watched the entire battle. Yang Ye’s strength was clearly weaker than the master of Slayer pavilion, but he’d won in the end.

Why?

Because Yang Ye was ruthless. He was ruthless to his enemies, but even more ruthless to himself. There was an even more important point, and it was that he was unafraid of death!

At the end of the battle, when the master of Slayer Pavilion fought Yang Ye to the death, he’d actually fallen into a disadvantaged situation. Not only was he disadvantaged when it came to his aura, even his mental state was similarly in a disadvantaged position. Because he’d been forced to fight Yang Ye to the death, but Yang Ye was doing it on his own accord. Was there a difference? Of course there was! At the very least, the master of Slayer Pavilion had lost to Yang Ye when it came to the aura and presence they possessed. Moreover, because he hadn’t wanted to put his life on the line, he had qualms in his heart. Since there were qualms in his heart, he naturally carried apprehension when he attacked. That was why Yang Ye had gradually gained the upper hand in the end.

At the end, the master of Slayer Pavilion had understood that principle and started to risk his life against Yang Ye, but it was too late.

Actually, Yang Ye’s strength was much weaker to the Slayer Pavilion’s master. That was beyond doubt. However, strength wasn’t the only thing that decided the outcome of a battle, there were various other aspects. There were too many incidents throughout history where the few defeated the many, or the weak defeated the strong.

Qian Lankong had quite a bit of admiration for Yang Ye. She could imagine that if Yang Ye didn’t die early and was able to continue growing, then he would definitely not be inferior to Jian Wuji.

Qian Lankong restrained her thoughts and sized up Yang Ye. Yang Ye’s injuries were very serious, extremely serious. It could be said that it was a miracle that he’d been able to survive such injuries.

Save Yang Ye?

She didn’t have such a thought. At the very least, she didn’t have such a thought right now. She just wanted to get her soul back right now, and Yang Ye’s unconscious state was an opportunity for her.

She walked over to Yang Ye’s side and squatted down, and then she placed her right palm against Yang Ye’s stomach. Because those strands of soul belonged to her, it didn’t take long for her to notice where they were within Yang Ye’s body. She didn’t hesitate to release a suction force from the center of her palm, and those 2 strands of soul within Yang Ye’s body seemed like they’d heard her summons. They instantly shook violently and intended to charge out of Yang Ye’s body. Qian Lankong was delighted when she noticed this.

However, the tiny vortex within Yang Ye suddenly spun, and then the two strands of soul instantly fell silent. They didn’t react at all no matter how Qian Lankong summoned them.

She frowned, “What’s going on?” She tried a few more times, but the strands of her soul didn’t react at all.

Qian Lankong remained silent for a long time before her face gradually turned icy cold. A dagger appeared in her grasp, and she pressed it against Yang Ye’s stomach. Obviously, she intended to cut Yang Ye’s stomach open.

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s voice resounded by her ears, “My body is very strong. You have to use a bit more force to cut through it!”

Qian Lankong’s dagger trembled slightly, and then she turned to look at Yang Ye. At this moment, he’d opened his eyes, and he was looking at her. Their gazes met for a few breaths of time before Qian Lankong put her dagger away. She stood up and said, “I was going to help treat you. Since you’ve woken up, then do it yourself.”

Treat me? Yang Ye glanced at her. He naturally didn’t believe that nonsense. If he’d woken up just a moment later, then she would have probably cut him open.

Meanwhile, she suddenly said, “Since you’ve woken up and are safe, then it’s time to return my soul to me.”

Yang Ye shook his head decisively, “No!”

Her face fell while killing intent flashed through her eyes, “I’ve saved you and brought you here. What else do you want?”

Yang Ye replied, “You wanted to kill me just now, right?”

Qian Lankong’s reply was very frank, “Yes!”

Yang Ye said, “See. My injuries are so serious, so I can’t fight back against you at all. If I return your soul to you, you’ll definitely end my life right away. Right?”

She gazed at him for a long time before she said, “What do you want?”

“It’s very simple!” Yang Ye continued, “I’ll return your soul once I’ve recovered, and I guarantee that I won’t go back on my word!”

“Are you kidding?” She suddenly squatted down and looked him in the eyes, “Can you even recover without spending around 15 days of time and consuming natural treasures? How will you even recover? I’m telling you that I’m not going to protect you for that long!”

“One day!” Yang Ye said, “Protect me for a day. Regardless of whether I’ve recovered after a day passes, I’ll still return your soul to you. Alright?”

Qian Lankong asked, “One day? Are you sure?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Yang Ye replied, “I am!”

She gazed at him for a long time before she said, “Alright, I’ll protect you for another day!”

Yang Ye said, “Give me violet crystals!”

She glanced at him before flipped her palm, and then over 100 violet crystals appeared by Yang Ye’s side.

Yang Ye said, “Feed them to me!”

Qian Lankong’s gaze became extremely hostile, “Don’t try to reach for a yard when given an inch!”

Yang Ye replied, “Just look at me. Can I move?” He wasn’t lying. His profound energy had dried up during the battle, and he’d fallen unconscious in the end. So, his injuries hadn’t been healed at all. Not only had they not been healed, they even showed signs of growing worse.

Qian Lankong glanced at him while her chest rose and fell. Obviously, she was furious. In the end, she picked up the violet crystals and brought them near Yang Ye’s mouth. Because she knew that if Yang Ye didn’t recover a little, he would definitely not return her soul to her.

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate at all. He opened his mouth and ate them. As soon as the violet crystals entered his stomach, the tiny vortex started to spin, and it didn’t take long for the spirit energy released by the violet crystals to be absorbed by the tiny vortex. In the end, threads of violet energy seeped out from the tiny vortex. As soon as the violet energy appeared, Yang Ye’s body was like a land covered in drought that finally received a good rain, and it instantly absorbed all the violet energy.

Meanwhile, Qian Lankong was in charge of feeding violet crystals to him. Of course, just eating them wasn’t sufficient. The violet crystals around Yang Ye started to be ignited, and they transformed into spirit energy that surged into Yang Ye.

Yang Ye asked, “Miss Qian, you’ve taken your revenge. So what do you plan to do after this?”

She glanced indifferently at him and said, “Does that have anything to do with you?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Miss Qian, you’re a Voider now, and you can be considered as one of the strongest in this world. I’d like to know if you think your strength is capable of breaking through the restrictions in the sky to leave for the outside world?”

Qian Lankong brought a violet crystal to Yang Ye’s mouth while she asked, “What are you trying to say?!”

Yang Ye swallowed the violet crystal before he said, “You can’t break through the restrictions around this world, but I can.”

“How laughable. Even....” A wisp of ridicule arose on the corners of her mouth. She was about to say something, but it didn’t take long for the ridicule on her mouth to freeze. In the end, it vanished slowly, and the words she was about to speak had stopped abruptly.

Since Dark Hell Continent suffered that calamity, countless experts had tried to break open the restrictions and head to the outside world. However, none had succeeded after so many years. So, when Yang Ye said that he could, her first reaction was that it was laughable. After all, even countless Voiders hadn’t been able to succeed, so how could Yang Ye possibly succeed?”

But it didn’t take long for her to suddenly think of something, and it was that Yang Ye was just a Quasi Emperor right now. Even if he couldn’t accomplish it now, what about in the future? What about when he’d attained the Emperor Realm? If he failed at the Emperor Realm, then what about when he attained the Voider Realm?

When she thought up to this point, she glanced at him but didn’t say a word.

Yang Ye continued, “Miss Qian, this world is a cage. Who does it imprison? Actually, it imprisons Voiders like you. Why? Because Saints and Emperors can still advance in this world, and they can continuously improve their strength and increase their lifespan. But what about all of you? Can all of you improve continuously? No! This world doesn’t tolerate your existence, nor can it afford to support all of you. If all of you want to attain more breakthroughs, then you must head to the outside world. Am I right?”

“We can’t leave, and you may not be able to leave as well!” As she spoke, she fed another violet crystal to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye swallowed the violet crystal before he looked her in the eyes, “All of you are definitely unable to leave, but I have a chance!”

Qian Lankong’s hand that was moving towards Yang Ye’s mouth had suddenly stopped. She gazed at him for a long time before she stuffed the violet crystal in his mouth and said, “Eat! Eat your fill and quickly return my soul.”

Yang Ye’s face darkened. After all that effort, I just wasted my breath for nothing!

However, Yang Ye had no intention to give up just like that. She was a Voider and an assassin. If he could obtain her assistance, then their joint forces could even kill ordinary Voiders in an instant!

However, she clearly didn’t have a good impression of him, and it would be quite difficult to make her join the Sword Alliance sincerely!

Yang Ye thought for a long time before he said, “Miss Qian, I sincerely invite you to join the Sword Alliance.” She was a smart person, so tricks were useless against her. Thus, Yang Ye had decided to be straightforward.

Qian Lankong glanced at him and said, “Even though you killed the pavilion master, there’s the Yuan Clan, the Ye Clan, and various other powers from the Veiled Region. Their joint forces are capable of casually dispatching 10 Voiders. So tell me, how many Voiders does your Sword Alliance have? As far as I know, it doesn’t even have one! Join your Sword Alliance? You’re asking me to give my life away!”

When she spoke up to this point, she tossed a violet crystal into his mouth and continued, “I wouldn’t join your Sword Alliance even if it has the ability to fight them.”

Yang Ye swallowed the violet crystal and felt puzzled as he asked, “Why?”

Qian Lankong asked, “You really want to know?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She looked him in the eyes and said, “Because I can’t stand the sight of you!”

Yang Ye was speechless.
