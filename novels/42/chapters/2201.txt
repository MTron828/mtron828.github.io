Chapter 2202 – Surrender or Die!

The woman in a violet dress just knelt silently before Yang Ye!

The Sword Supreme!

She was the number one sword of the large universe!

At this moment, it seemed like the world had frozen.

Far away in the Dao Dimension, in a palace deep within its depths, the Dao Progenitor who sat cross-legged on a cushion suddenly opened his eyes, “It’s acknowledging him…”

The Buddhist Dimension.

On the golden lotus, the Buddhist Progenitor pressed his palms together, “He can kill progenitors now.”

The Weapon Dimension.

The Weapon Progenitor gazed at Yang Ye from afar, “It still acknowledged him in the end…”

There was a trace of bewilderment and solemness in his eyes.

The number one sword of the large universe!

It could even instill fear in Progenitor Realm experts!

The Human Dimension.

The woman was still kneeling there before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time before he asked, “Why?”

She looked up at him, “Must there be a reason?”

He shook his head, “No matter what it is, I don’t accept this!”

The woman replied with a question, “Why?”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “You stubbornly adhere to your own views. If you become my sword, you’ll change me to the person you want, but I am who I am. I won’t become a person that someone else wants.”

Yang Ye turned around and left.

The Sword Supreme was the number one sword of the large universe, so he was naturally tempted. However, it wasn’t that great of a temptation. It had surpassed the scope of a sword, and it had its own thoughts and soul. So, anyone who wields her was very likely to have to follow her rules.

Yang Ye wasn’t willing to do that!

Suddenly, the Sword Supreme appeared in front of Yang Ye. She looked him in the eyes and asked, “Why?”

Yang Ye replied softly, “You saw me save the human race, so you decided to submit to me. But what if I want to slaughter the world one day?”

The Sword Supreme fell silent.

Yang Ye continued, “I don’t want a benevolent sword, I want a sword of slaughter. Sorry, you’re not qualified.”

Yang Ye left with Tian Xiu and Yang Lianshuang.

Only the Sword Supreme remained there.

She just stood there in silence.

A sword of slaughter!

Yang Ye didn’t want a benevolent sword, because he was no savior. He wanted a sword that would kill with him, and it was naturally the Sword Spirit who was willing to become a sword of blood for him!

The Sword Spirit was the most ideal sword to Yang Ye!

The Sword Supreme wasn’t!

If he wanted to save the world, the Sword Spirit would save it with him; if he wanted to slaughter the world, the Sword Spirit wouldn’t hesitate to slaughter the world with him.

Could the Sword Supreme accomplish that?

As far as Yang Ye was concerned, the Sword Supreme couldn’t!

…

After Yang Ye’s group left, a woman in a white dress suddenly appeared here.

It was Ding Shaoyao.

She walked over to the Sword Supreme, “Surprised?”

The Sword Supreme remained silent.

Ding Shaoyao said, “You thought he would be overjoyed when you submitted to him. But you never expected him to refuse. Moreover, he did it so decisively!”

The Sword Supreme gazed at her, “Why?”

“Because he’s Yang Ye!” Ding Shaoyao replied softly, “He’s a person with a terrible temper. If he likes something, even if it’s a piece of scrap, he will treat it like a treasure; but if he dislikes something, then he won’t spare it a glance, even if it’s a precious treasure of the entire universe. Besides that, he's very sentimental.”

The Sword Supreme asked, “What do you mean?”

She grinned, “Forget that. Sword Supreme, let me ask you something. Do you really think benevolence can save the world now? Or perhaps I should ask if you think this world can be saved?”

The Sword Supreme remained silent.

Ding Shaoyao continued, “This world is probably beyond saving, and no one can help it! Besides that, you should understand your position. He’s still Yang Ye even without you, and he’s still the same person that all the experts in the large universe fear. As for you, you’re just a sword. So, make your choice.”

Ding Shaoyao left once she finished speaking.

The Sword Supreme remained silent on the spot.

…

Yang Ye, Yang Lianshuang, and Tian Xiu didn’t leave the Human Dimension. After he made arrangements for the young boy and girl, Tian Xiu led Yang Ye to Nature Sacred Ground.

There was a city below Nature Sacred Ground, it was called Nature City.

Tian Xiu led Yang Ye to the city. At this moment, its doors were opened wide, and the sounds of fighting and shrill cries resounded from time to time.

Tian Xiu gazed at Yang Ye, “Big Brother, do you know why your slaughter intent attained the Progenitor Realm?”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She grinned, “Because your slaughter intent is from this large universe. It had been able to improve because your desire to kill was at its limits. However, there was a greater reason for that, and it’s because the slaughter intent floating through the large universe sensed your desire to kill, so it came to you. It converged into a torrent that ultimately allowed your slaughter intent to attain the Progenitor Realm!”

Yang Ye asked softly, “What are you trying to say?”

Tian Xiu explained, “The energy of all living beings! A large reason why you were able to attain the Progenitor Realm in slaughter intent was because you gathered the slaughter intent of all living beings, the energy of all living beings.”

She gazed at the city and continued, “Big Brother, you’re a sword cultivator, so you follow your heart. But your heart is good in the end. However, your kindness is limited. It does make sense because no one is born to be a kind or good person. You don’t see many things, so you’re naturally unable to feel any compassion for it, but you take action once you do see it. Just like what you did earlier. Cultivation isn’t just meditating behind closed doors, it’s to see, experience, and comprehend life.”

Comprehend life!

Yang Ye looked up at the city and remained silent.

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu continued, “I’m not asking you to save the human race. I’m just telling you that you must not run away from this. You must truly follow your heart.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he nodded, “Let’s go!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around. But he only took a few steps before he flicked with his finger.

A ray of blood red sword energy flashed, and then it appeared in the sky above the city.

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang walked into the sky. She glanced at the surroundings, “Everyone who isn’t from the human race must leave the Human Dimension in an hour!”

“Who do you think you are?!” Suddenly, a voice resounded from her right, and then a middle aged man appeared near her.

An expert from the demon race!

Suddenly, a ray of blood red sword energy flashed, and then his head flew off his neck.

At this moment, the city fell silent!

Yang Ye!

Did anyone in the large universe not recognize that blood red sword energy?

Yang Ye was here!

At this moment, the city fell silent.

Yang Lianshuang glanced coldly at the surroundings, “Are you still not going to fuck off?”

She received no reply!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Meanwhile, rays of blood red sword energy rained down like a storm. In an instant, countless shrill cries resounded through the city. At the same time, heads flew up incessantly. It was truly quite a horrifying sight.

At this moment, all the non-humans in the city reacted to what was going on, and they fled the city.

In just a few breaths of time, only humans remained in the city.

As for the countless experts in the city, they came outside, and they saw three figures moving off into the distance.

They were led by Yang Ye who was covered in blood red light.

Countless people knelt down slowly.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye’s words to spread throughout the Human Dimension!

At this instant, the entire human race was overjoyed. Yang Ye had finally taken action!

Yang Ye had taken action!

It could be described as news that overjoyed the entire human race. Presently, it was really in a hopeless situation, and Yang Ye’s actions had lit a flame of hope for them.

Moreover, because of how ruthless Yang Ye was, the countless experts from the other races left the Human Dimension. However, there were some who refused to give up, but they never saw another sunrise. Just like that, the Human Dimension gradually became peaceful again, but it didn’t take long for another problem to arise. The internal strife between humans itself.

Since they had no external enemies, some organizations started having thoughts about seizing spirit energy and immortal stones!

However, a mysterious organization suddenly appeared in the Human Dimension at this time.

The Sword Alliance.

Once it showed itself, anyone who dared to steal would be annihilated overnight. Moreover, it started to recruit the experts of the human race, so countless experts joined it.

Moreover, it started reorganizing the entire human race.

Receiving, distributing, recruiting, fostering…

The string of actions it carried out allowed the Human Dimension to truly attain peace in a short while.

The Sword Alliance’s headquarters was in Nature City. However, it was called Sword Alliance City now.

There was a statue outside the city.

It was a statue of a young man. He held a sword in his hands, his eyes were closed, and his hair hung down to his shoulders. Besides that, his entire body emanated faint red light.

Yang Ye!

It was Yang Ye!

The reason the Sword Alliance had been able to swiftly reorganize the human race and make countless experts join it was mainly because of that statue.

Yang Ye stood behind the Sword Alliance!

As for the other races, they didn’t cause more trouble. So, the large universe greeted a short period of peace.

However, everyone knew it was the calm before the storm.

Void Spirit Continent.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye sat cross-legged while the Primordial Pagoda floated before him.

Tian Xiu was beside Yang Ye. She spoke solemnly, “Big Brother, you’re not at the Progenitor Realm, so if you allow it into your sea of consciousness now, and truly merge with it and take control of it, it’ll be risky for you. Are you sure you want to do this?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Yes!”

Tian Xiu gazed at the Primordial Pagoda. The latter trembled and transformed into a ray of light that entered Yang Ye’s forehead.

Bang!

A ray of golden light suddenly erupted from Yang Ye’s forehead, and then violet energy enveloped Yang Ye. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Suddenly, Tian Xiu looked up, and then her eyes narrowed slightly, “Dugu Juetian…”

At the door of light far within the endless black holes.

Bang!

A terrifying aura suddenly swept out from the door of light, and then black shadows flashed out from there. In just a short while, almost 600 women appeared there.

600 undying cavalries!

A moment later, they fell down to one knee in unison.

A woman in a black mask walked out slowly from within the door. Behind her were three spears, and two short swords hung by her waist. Besides that, she was dragging a cape behind her.

She glanced slowly at the surroundings, and a short while passed before she slowly closed her eyes, “The living beings of this large universe are so weak now!”

Meanwhile, the 600 undying cavalries behind her remained on their knees in silence, and they kept their heads lowered.

Meanwhile, the masked woman suddenly said, “Give my order! All the living beings of the large universe can either surrender or die!”
