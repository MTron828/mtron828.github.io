Chapter 1654 - Swordswoman From The Ku Clan!

Translator: InVader

The mysterious figure had left without the slightest hesitation.

Yang Ye was left speechless on the spot.

Quite some time passed before Yang Ye shook his head. I guess I can only rely on myself. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

However, he knew that he couldn’t act rashly. Because based on the mysterious figure’s attitude, he could sense that the Ku Clan was definitely not ordinary.

Of course, he intended to try no matter how extraordinary it was!

Meanwhile, An Nanjing suddenly asked, “Who was that?”

Yang Ye shook his head. Actually, he was curious about that as well. The mysterious figure had been a True Realm expert, so his status in the Yang Clan was definitely not low. However, Yang Ye knew that his father was definitely the reason why that mysterious figure had been willing to help him.

The Yang Clan!

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he shook his head. He was in the heart of a storm right now. All he could do wasn’t to avoid it but to charge out of it. There were only two ways to accomplish that.

The first was to die. Once he was dead, everything would be over, and he would have naturally escaped it. The second was to charge out with his own strength. He had to be so strong that others would dare not look for trouble with him. As for death, he would naturally not choose such an option.

So, he had to grow strong!

Grow stronger incessantly!

That was his current goal.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he gazed at An Nanjing, “Enter the Primordial Pagoda?” After experiencing this incident, Yang Ye knew that many people in the Yang Clan wanted to take his life. So, he couldn’t just travel out in the open anymore.

He didn’t want to constantly encounter True Realm experts who wanted to kill him!

An Nanjing pondered deeply for a moment, and then she nodded before entering the Primordial Pagoda.

Once she’d entered the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye’s figure trembled and was concealed.

Presently, his Laws of Darkness had attained the Zenith Realm. Coupled with his Laws of Space and Sword Domain, it could be said that so long as someone didn’t lock onto him beforehand, even a True Realm expert would find it difficult to locate him.

Once Yang Ye vanished, a grey robed old man appeared where Yang Ye had been just moments ago.

A True Realm expert!

Once the grey robed old man appeared here, the mysterious figure from before appeared here once more.

The grey robed old man gazed at the mysterious figure, “I hold no ill intent towards them.”

The mysterious figure nodded slightly, and then he gazed at the old man’s left chest. There was a small ‘武’ character there.

The mysterious figure asked, “You’re from the Wu Clan?”

The grey robed old man nodded slightly, “I’ve been entrusted with protecting that little girl.”

The mysterious figure asked another question, “She’s from your Wu Clan?”

The grey robed old man replied, “Yes!”

The mysterious figure fell silent for a long time before he asked, “Your Wu Clan intends to participate in my Yang Clan’s fight for succession as well?”

The old man shook his head slightly, “We have no interest in that. But she’s very close to that kid, so my Wu Clan can’t stop her. Thus, we have no choice but to protect her in secret. Yet now, you’ve stopped me here, and based on that kid’s ability when it comes to concealment, even I will probably be unable to find him again.”

The mysterious figure said, “It’s fine. Based on his character, it won’t take long for him to cause a huge commotion. At that time, you’ll know where he is.”

The old man shook his head and smiled ,”True!”

“Farewell!” As soon as he finished speaking, the mysterious figure vanished on the spot.

The grey robed old man pondered deeply for a moment, and then he vanished on the spot.

…

There were less than 10 days before the Yang Clan’s fight for succession. But as far as Yang Ye was concerned, all he desired was to save Little Sky.

Little Sky’s soul was heavily injured. Even though the Primordial Violet Energy was keeping her soul from dispersing, it couldn’t heal her soul. So, Little Sky’s soul may gradually vanish as time passes. Because the injuries it had suffered were truly too severe.

Thus, Yang Ye was determined to obtain a piece of Soul Nurturing Wood!

…

Kuyan System.

It wasn’t called Kuyan System in the past, but it had been changed in remembrance of the Ku Clan’s ancestor. Because the Ku Clan’s ancestor’s name was Ku Yan.

Kuyan System wasn’t huge, and it should be described as being very small. The entire system only had a single large world, Kuyan Continent. Moreover, there was only a single clan on that continent, the Ku Clan.

The Ku Clan was unlike the other clans. Because they never ventured out to plunder from others or launch expeditions to other places, and it was even to the extent that very few of its disciples would ever make an appearance in the outside world. So, the Ku Clan seemed rather mysterious because no one knew what its true strength was like.

The unknown was the most terrifying!

It took Yang Ye less than two days to arrive at Kuyan System while traveling at full speed. Of course, it was mainly because Heaven Void System wasn’t very far from Kuyan System.

However, when he was about to enter Kuyan System, the space around him trembled.

Crap! Yang Ye cried out inwardly. Sure enough, it didn’t take long for a woman to appear in front of him.

She was a little over twenty years of age, had long black hair that flowed down like a waterfall that reached her waist, and she wore a light green dress. Her dress was studded with numerous fine bamboo leaves, and she was holding a fine bamboo splint.

She glanced at the position that Yang Ye resided at, and she said, “Go back to where you came from.”

A moment of silence ensued before Yang Ye walked out from that expanse of space. He knew that it was impossible for him to steal from them.

Yang Ye cupped his fist towards her and said, “The Yang Clan’s Yang Ye.”

She glanced at him and said, “Why are you here?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment before he said, “I’m here to ask for a piece of Soul Nurturing Wood!”

She gazed at him for a long time before she said, “Go back to where you came from.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I refuse.”

She looked him in the eyes and said, “Then die!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t want to die either.”

Suddenly, she vanished on the spot, and then a ray of green sword energy instantly arrived before Yang Ye.

A sword cultivator!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He hadn’t expected her to actually be a sword cultivator. Moreover, she was a formidable sword cultivator.

Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly. He clenched his right fist and slammed it forward.

Bang!

An explosion resounded as Yang Ye’s figure was pushed around 300m back. However, the green sword energy hadn’t vanished, and it shot towards him in a very strange manner.

Yang Ye fell silent for an instant, and then a sword appeared in his grasp. He stabbed it forward.

Hiss!

A ray of light flashed, and the sword energy vanished.

The woman’s beautiful brows were pressed slightly together, “A sword cultivator?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “We’re both sword cultivators, so help me. I just want a piece of Soul Nurturing Wood. I won’t take it for free. I can give you other things in exchange. Or perhaps you have a request, you can tell me about that too. I’ll definitely…”

“No!” Meanwhile, the woman interrupted Yang Ye, “Leave or don’t blame my Ku Clan for showing no mercy!”

Yang Ye fell silent for an instant and said, “I won’t leave until you give me one!”

Actually, he knew that he was in the wrong, and he was unreasonably causing trouble for them. However, it couldn’t be helped because the Soul Nurturing Wood was related to Little Sky’s fate. Not to mention being in the wrong, no matter how shameless he had to act, he was willing to do it.

The woman gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then she suddenly took a step forward. A moment later, she’d appeared in front of Yang Ye. The bamboo splint stabbed forward like a bolt of lightning, and its target was the center of Yang Ye’s forehead.

Yang Ye didn’t just stand there and wait for death to arrive. He immediately twisted his wrist and flicked his sword upwards.

Clang!

An ear piercing sound of collision resounded, and then both Yang Ye and the woman were pushed back repeatedly. Meanwhile, she suddenly flicked the bamboo splint at Yang Ye.

Hiss!

A ray of green sword energy flashed.

Yang Ye raised his sword and swung it.

Bang!

The green sword energy was blasted into bits. Meanwhile, the woman had appeared in front of Yang Ye. At the same time, the bamboo split glowed as it stabbed towards Yang Ye’s face.

Right when Yang Ye was about to raise his sword to defend himself, his expression suddenly changed. Because the bamboo splint had suddenly sped up, and the strength within it had multiplied!

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was blasted 3km away.

As soon as he stopped himself, she’d appeared in front of him again, and then a wave of powerful sword intent enveloped him!

Returnal Rank sword intent!

Countless rays of green sword energy followed closely behind the sword intent.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Explosions resounded incessantly, and Yang Ye was pushed back repeatedly along with the explosions. In just a short while, she’d pushed him over 10km back, and he was still being pushed back rapidly.

Bang!

Around ten breaths of time later, a ray of green sword energy flashed, and then Yang Ye was blasted 3km away. Meanwhile, the woman was about to attack again, but Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot.

Her expression had changed drastically when he vanished, and she was about to move away from where she stood. But it was too late.

A sword was pressed against her nape!

As for Yang Ye who’d been over 3km away from her, he’d suddenly appeared behind her, and the sword on her nape was his sword.

The Laws of Darkness!

The reason he’d displayed weakness and allowed her to push him back repeatedly was so that he could execute this move.

Yang Ye didn’t kill her. He was here to seek their help and not to cause trouble. He immediately removed his sword and moved 300m away, “See, I have no ill intent. I’m a good person. I’m telling the truth.”

She glanced at him, ‘Come! Take another attack of mine!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she closed her eyes, and then her soul flashed out from her body. After that, a ray of light flashed.

A sword soul technique!

Yang Ye’s expression instantly changed. He hadn’t expected her to be skilled in a sword soul technique. He didn’t dare act carelessly and hurriedly released his Returnal Rank sword intent, and then he swiftly raised his sword and swung it.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was blasted around 10km away.

As soon as Yang Ye had stopped his figure, the woman’s soul had arrived before him with the bamboo splint in her grasp, and then she swung it again.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he vanished on the spot.

The Sword of Rebirth!

This time, he didn’t dare to hold back, and he’d executed the Sword of Rebirth!

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded, and then countless rays of sword energy shot off in all directions.

Yang Ye had been blasted around 3km away again while the woman’s soul had returned to her body. However, it only took a moment for her soul to flash out again, and then a ray of light instantly arrived before Yang Ye!

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched when he witnessed this scene, and then he hurriedly raised his hands, “I surrender!”

Her soul instantly stopped 3m away from him when she heard him.

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s figure vanished on the spot while the shadow behind the woman’s body wriggled, and then a sword was pressed against her body’s throat.

Yang Ye held his sword against her body’s throat while looking at her soul, and he said, “I was just joking!”
