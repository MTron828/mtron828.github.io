Chapter 1532 - How Long Has It Been?

Translator: InVader

Both Yu Jiaoniang and Nan Ba were stunned.

Slaughter intent!

Quasi Returnal Rank slaughter intent!

Nan Ba’s countenance had turned slightly pale. He knew that he’d bit off more than he could chew. After all, someone who’d comprehended Quasi Returnal Rank sword intent was definitely not someone he could resist.

When he noticed that Yang Ye was still walking in his direction, Nan Ba hurriedly said, “I… I didn’t say anything. I really didn’t say anything.”

Even though it was quite humiliating, it was better than losing his life!

Yang Ye stopped moving. In an instant, the slaughter intent and blood energy returned into his body. He glanced at Nan Ba, and then he turned to look at Yu Jiaoniang, “Do you still want my spatial ring?”

Yu Jiaoniang’s expression changed slightly, and she instinctively took a few steps back and said, “I was ignorant and failed to discern your ability. Please do forgive me for what happened earlier.”

Yang Ye sized her up and said, “Not bad. At least you didn’t act very embarrassingly.”

Nan Ba’s face became quite unsightly when he heard Yang Ye. He naturally knew that Yang Ye was talking about him. However, he didn’t dare to say anything about it, and he just vanished into the distance.

Yang Ye didn’t kill the fellow because he didn’t want to waste his profound energy on such trash.

Yang Ye gazed at Yu Jiaoniang, “Tell me something. I want to go to the Demon Territory, but I don’t know anything about it. Do you know how to deal with that?”

Yu Jiaoniang glanced at Yang Ye and shook her head, “I’ve never been there. However, there’s someone who definitely has a map of the Demon Territory. But you might have to pay a certain price to get it.”

Yang Ye asked, “Where?”

She hesitated for a moment and said, “I’ll take you there!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Thank you!”

Yu Jiaoniang nodded slightly, and then she turned around and started walking into the city. Yang Ye followed her. Something worth mentioning was that those people who were fearlessly scanning him earlier had withdrawn their divine senses. Moreover, some of the people in the surroundings had even withdrawn their gazes. Even if some were still looking at him, there was no hostility in their eyes and only curiosity.

Strength!

This was the reason why he’d revealed his slaughter intent earlier. He wasn’t afraid of trouble, but he didn’t want to get into trouble. So, he revealed his slaughter intent. In that way, those people who were targeting him would naturally give up.

After he arrived at the large world, Yang Ye realized that the large world was actually no different to the lower dimensions. The only difference was the spirit energy here, the spirit energy here really wasn’t something that the spirit energy in the lower dimensions could compare to. Of course, there was one more difference, and it was that the experts in the lower dimensions couldn’t compare to the experts here. Even though Deities weren’t everywhere, there really were quite a few here!

It didn’t take long for them to arrive before a pub. The pub’s name was The Goat Pub. The pub was huge, extremely huge, and it occupied around 10% of the city.

While it was called a pub, it was actually a place to trade.

Gambling, women, auctions… So long as you could think of it, this place had it. Not all cultivators had a heart without desires and merely wanted to cultivate. Many cultivators liked to enjoy themselves, so there were many places of entertainment on the continent.

Yu Jiaoniang suddenly said while they stood outside the pub, “Go on in!”

Yang Ye asked, “You’re not coming?” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

She shook her head, “It costs 10,000 divine crystals to go in.”

“It costs 10,000 divine crystals just to go in?” Yang Ye was astounded, “Are they bandits?”

Yu Jiaoniang’s expression changed slightly, “Don’t speak rashly and watch your words.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She hesitated for a moment and said, “The Goat Pub isn’t an ordinary power. It has countless experts. Especially its owner. Its owner isn’t just strong but extremely mysterious as well. In short, it’s best to be cautious!”

Yang Ye asked, “How many stars does this pub have?”

She shook her head, “I don’t know. Because they’ve never shown their true strength. This pub appeared here around six or seven years ago, but it grew at a shocking speed. In just less than a year, it became the most bustling place in Oblivion Boundary City, and it’s also the place that others fear to offend the most.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Come in with me.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he flicked a spatial ring to the guard at the door. The guard took the spatial ring, bowed slightly to them, and then gestured for them to enter.

Yang Ye immediately walked through the entrance.

Yu Jiaoniang glanced at him and immediately walked in as well.

Once they walked through the door, a teleportation platform appeared before them. There were many small teleportation formations on the platform, and every single one of them was labelled with their destination. For example, Spa of Pleasure, House of Joy, Auction House, and many others. There were a few dozen!

Yang Ye gazed at Yu Jiaoniang, and the latter said, “We need to go to the All-Knowing Pavilion.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he walked into the corresponding teleportation formation with her. A moment later, they appeared in a pavilion. The pavilion was quite huge. It had around seven levels, and it was quite full of people./

“This place specializes in providing information!” Yu Jiaoniang continued, “However, there’s a face, and it isn’t cheap.”

Yang Ye asked, “Who should I see?”

She pointed at a room in the distance and said, “The people in there.”

Yang Ye glanced over there, and he noticed that there were actually over 100 rooms like that.

They make a lot of money!

This was the first thing that appeared in Yang Ye’s mind.

Sometimes, he attached great importance to money, but sometimes, he didn’t really care. When he felt it was important, it was because the Sword Alliance and Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region needed money. As for himself, as far as he was concerned, he just needed enough for himself to use. However, he couldn’t deny that when one’s wealth arrived at a certain level, it was extremely terrifying.

Cultivation techniques, combat techniques, mercenaries, and various other things could be bought with money! Just like this very moment, if he didn’t have divine crystals, then he wouldn’t be able to obtain a map of the Demon Territory.

It didn’t take long for a person to walk out from within the room. Meanwhile, Yu Jiaoniang said, “Go on!”

Yang Ye nodded and entered the room.

There was only a single young woman around the age of 20 within the room. She was pretty and had a gentle smile on her face. She was slightly stunned when she saw Yang Ye, and a trace of surprise flashed through her eyes. But it didn’t take long for her to return to normal.

She asked, “May I know what you need?”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. There were no guards here, but there were a few obscure auras within the pavilion. Obviously, they were Dualism Realm experts!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at her, “I need a map of the Demon Territory.”

“The Demon Territory’s map!” She glanced at him and spoke softly, “It’s 100,000 divine crystals!”

100,000! Yang Ye’s face froze. He hadn’t expected just a map to actually be 100,000 divine crystals. As far as he was concerned, it was no different to daylight robbery! However, he had no other choice because this was just business that required the agreement of both parties. After all, they weren’t forcing him to buy it. Fortunately, he’d gained more than a million divine crystals from those four Dualism Realm experts that he’d killed earlier. So, 100,000 wasn’t really difficult for him.

Yang Ye flicked a spatial ring over to the woman. She took it, glanced at it, and then smiled at Yang Ye, “Please wait a moment!”

As she spoke, she withdrew a transmission talisman and crushed it. Three breaths of time later, the space in front of her shook slightly, and then a jade slip appeared in front of her. She flicked it lightly, and it flew over to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye took the jade slip, and it transformed into a ray of white light that entered his forehead. After that, numerous strings of information surged into his mind. It didn’t take long for him to find the Divine Phoenix Clan’s position.

Meanwhile, the woman said, “The Demon Territory is huge, and that map only covers a portion of it. It isn’t even 10% of the entire Demon Territory. If you’re heading there, then please remember that the places not labelled on the map are definitely extremely dangerous places, so please don’t step foot into them. Because this map was made by a Rebirth Realm expert, the places not included on the map represent that even a Rebirth Realm expert didn’t dare enter those places.”

Yang Ye gazed at her and smiled, “Thanks for the warning!”

He hesitated for a moment and said, “Can you find out anything I want?”

She grinned, “You must be joking. Our universe is huge! How could we dare to say that we know everything? However, you can tell me what you wish to know. We have information about most things.”

Yang Ye smiled and said, “Right. So, do you know much about the Divine Phoenix Clan? I want information about them, and it’s best if it’s in detail.”

Since they were going to become enemies, he naturally had to gain information on them.

The Divine Phoenix Clan! The woman’s smile gradually vanished. A short while passed before she said, “We do, but it’s quite expensive. Moreover, our information on the Divine Phoenix Clan isn’t that detailed.”

Yang Ye asked, “How much is it?”

She glanced at him and said, “Three million divine crystals!”

“What?!” Yang Ye stood up from his seat, “Three million? Miss, that’s daylight robbery!” After all, just a single piece of information was three million divine crystals, and it made him feel like they were the greatest bandits of all bandits!

She glanced at him and said, “It is quite expensive, but you should be aware of how terrifying the Divine Phoenix Clan is. It’s extremely difficult to gather information about them. After all, they don’t really welcome humans there. Moreover, ordinary humans dare not rashly step foot into the Divine Phoenix Clan’s territory as well.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She replied, “The answer to that will cost you!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, she added, “If you’re short on money right now, you can come again. You’re always welcome to return.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly because she was telling him to leave. But he really didn’t have three million divine crystals right now!

Yang Ye shook his head, and then he was about to leave. However, an old man suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye.

A Rebirth Realm expert!

After the old man appeared, another ten more middle aged men appeared here.

Ten Dualism Realm experts!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He tightened his grip on his sword and gazed at the old man, “What?”

The old man glanced at him and said, “You can’t leave.”

Yang Ye chuckled, “So you’re really going to rob me?”

The old man shook his head slightly, “Someone wants to see you. That person will be here soon, so please wait for a moment.”

“See me?” Yang Ye frowned, “Who?”

The old man replied, “You’ll find out in a moment!”

Yang Ye’s brows were pressed even more tightly together. They were clearly not from the Emperor Sect or War Pavilion because they would have attacked by now if they were.

Since they weren’t, then who wanted to see him? He didn’t know many people in the large world. An Nanjing and Mo Xiaoleng were the only two other people he knew. It was definitely impossible to be Mo Xiaoleng because he knew that she-devil’s temper well, and she would have definitely attacked immediately and not say that she wanted to see him.

Is it An Nanjing?

Suddenly, the old man, the ten Dualism Realm experts, and even the woman who served Yang Ye earlier suddenly looked towards the door, and then they bowed, “Master!”

Yang Ye looked towards the door. Meanwhile, a voice came from there, “How long has it been since we saw each other? Six years? Seven years? Or eight years? It has been quite long, so I don’t remember!”
