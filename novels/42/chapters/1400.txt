Chapter 1401 – We’ve Lost!

However, when Yang Ye arrived where Skyriver City had once been, there was no one there. Or it should be said that there was no living person there!

There were only some scattered corpses here.

They’d hidden themselves.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then a cold smile curled up on the corners of his mouth. He didn’t go looking for them, and he just went to the center of Skyriver City and stomped his foot against the ground. His figure instantly transformed into a ray of light that shot underground and continued his descent without slowing down at all.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to stop. There was a huge white dragon not too far away from him!

A Divine Grade spirit vein!

At this moment, the dragon was looking at Yang Ye, and its eyes were filled with fear.

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath. He just flashed over to it before his Rebirth Rank sword intent slammed down upon it. The white dragon was utterly incapable to resist Yang Ye, and it was instantly dragged into the Primordial Pagoda. Once it entered the Primordial Pagoda, the slightly furious white dragon was stunned.

It sized up the world in the 1st level, and then it didn’t take long for a trace of pleasant surprise to actually appear in its eyes!

Yang Ye paid no attention to the white dragon. He just went to another area beneath the ground, and it didn’t take long for another Divine Grade spirit vein to appear within the Primordial Pagoda.

Just like that, around 15 minutes passed, and there were 5 Divine Grade spirit veins added to the Primordial Pagoda!

Skyriver City had a total of 5 Divine Grade spirit veins, and they were at its four corners and center. Yet now, Yang Ye had taken all of them.

The spirit energy here naturally suffered a sharp decline when the spirit veins vanished. So, the grey robed old man and the others who were in hiding were naturally aware that Yang Ye had taken the spirit veins by force. However, no one dared to try and stop him.

Their lives were naturally more important to them than those spirit veins!

However, their hearts were bleeding.

It didn’t hurt that much when Skyriver City was destroyed, but their hearts absolutely hurt when Yang Ye took the Divine Grade spirit veins. If Yang Ye’s strength wasn’t too terrifying, they would definitely stop him no matter what. After all, those spirit veins were the foundation of Skyriver Continent, and it would be easier for the continent to recover when it had those spirit veins present in it.

However, now that they were taken away, unless the Alliance of Guardians got replacement, Skyriver Continent wouldn’t be able to recover from Yang Ye’s attack even if it was given a hundred years.

As for getting new Divine Grade spirit mains. There were usually no powers willing to sell them. Because besides geniuses, there was a very important thing which every world needed in order to develop further, and it was spirit veins. Only by possessing sufficient spirit energy could a world draw in more people. After all, would anyone be willing to go to a world that had no spirit energy?

So, all large powers usually kept Divine Grade spirit veins for their own use. Even if independent cultivators obtained one by chance and wanted to sell it, the price for it would be absurdly high.

Tremendous losses!

It was truly a tremendous loss!

Even if Skyriver Stellar Region could kill Yang Ye, its strength would diminish tremendously. Not only had Yang Ye killed 2 Deities, he’d killed around 10 Semi-Deities and countless other Voiders and Emperors. Now, Yang Ye had even taken 5 spirit veins from Skyriver City. It could be said that Skyriver Stellar Region would take a few dozen years to recover from the damages Yang Ye had caused.

Of course, the precondition was that it could annihilate Yang Ye!

Yang Ye didn’t stop after he took those 5 spirit veins, and he headed to the city nearest to Skyriver City.

Skyriver City was the main city on Skyriver Continent, so it had the most Divine Grade spirit veins. However, Skyriver City wasn’t the only city on this continent, and there were more. Moreover, other cities had Divine Grade spirit veins too. However, they mostly had one, and some had spirit veins at a lower rank!

However, so long as they were spirit veins, Yang Ye didn’t refuse any of them!

He started plundering them like a madman!

Yang Ye raised his speed to its limits so that he could gather the spirit veins as quickly as possible. Moreover, once he finished taking the spirit vein in a city, he didn’t waste even a shred of time and immediately rushed to the next city. He didn’t kill people because they were all ordinary Voiders, so killing them didn’t make much of a difference and would just be a waste of time.

Of course, he naturally didn’t hold back against those who tried to stop him.

In less than an hour, Yang Ye had gone to 10 cities, and 5 of them had Divine Grade spirit veins while the rest had Saint Grade spirit veins. However, Yang Ye didn’t stop and continued to plunder the spirit veins through Skyriver Continent.

Just like that, another hour passed, and then Yang Ye stopped.

At this moment, he had 11 Divine Grade spirit veins and over 30 Saint Grade spirit veins!

Once all of these Divine Grade spirit veins entered the 1st level of the Primordial Pagoda, the spirit energy there became absolutely terrifying.

At this moment, the spirit energy in the 1st level was too abundant!

Just casually breathing would allow one to breath in spirit energy!

The only sad thing was that he couldn’t transform all of it into profound energy. Because the 1st level was independent. He could enter the Primordial Pagoda, but he hadn’t fully merged into one with it. The Primordial Pagoda was merely living within him and had formed a certain level of connection with him.

So, if he wanted to gain profound energy, he had no choice but to enter the 1st level and convert it himself. However, if a day came when he was able to merge completely with it, then it would represent that he could convert the spirit energy in the 1st level at any time. At that time....

At that time, he wouldn’t have to worry about not having sufficient profound energy!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and was about to head to the next city. Suddenly, he looked up into the sky, and then 3 extremely powerful auras appeared in the sky above the continent. After that, an invisible barrier appeared in the air above Skyriver Continent!

3 Deities!

A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth because he’d finally forced the other 3 Deities of Skyriver Stellar Region to return here. However, it was quite troublesome because they’d joined forces to seal up Skyriver Continent. So, there was only one way to leave the continent now, and it was to break through the seal. However, doing so would definitely alarm the 3 Deities here!

3 Deities!

That was absolutely not something he could fight right now!

So, he couldn’t go head on against them and had to use his brains!

Suddenly, Yang Ye frowned, and then his figure shook and merged into space. Right after that happened, a wave of divine sense swept through where he’d just been standing.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to walk out from space!

That divine sense belonged to a Deity. In other words, they’d started to search for him!

Yang Ye remained silent on the spot, and then he suddenly seemed to have thought of something. A vicious glow flashed through his eyes, and then he immediately transformed into a ray of light that shot underground.

After he arrived underground, Yang Ye sped up and shot towards the core of the continent. Around two hours later, Yang Ye’s figure stopped. There was an earthen wall before him. The wall was completely red, and lava was behind it.

He’d arrived deep underground at the core of the continent!

Yang Ye looked ahead for a long time, and then a wisp of ferocity curled up on the corners of his mouth, “You refuse to let me, huh?!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye drew his sword and swung it!

Om!

A sword howl suddenly shot up into the air from underground. It was extremely swift and merely took an instant to charge out from beneath the ground, and then it pierced the sky.

BOOM!

After that, an explosion that shook the continent resounded from deep underground. The ground started shaking violently like an earthquake. It didn’t take long for huge expanses of the ground to start collapsing while countless streams of lava shot up into the sky and started flowing towards the surroundings.

The ground wasn’t just collapsing at one spot. It seemed like a chain reaction was occurring as two thirds of the continent had started to quake, and then countless streams of lava seeped out from below and flowed swiftly towards the surroundings.

Doomsday had arrived!

At this moment, countless people throughout the continent were horrified!

However, all of this wasn’t the end of it. Another sword howl suddenly resounded from the distant ocean. After that, shocking waves shot up throughout the ocean and surged towards the continent.

But that still wasn’t the end of it. Just around an hour passed before another sword howl resounded from far away in the north. After that, the mountains of snow and ice that had accumulated for countless years were blasted apart by a ray of sword energy!

Avalanches rumbled down as the mountains collapsed. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

It was the end of the world!

It truly was the end of the world!

At this moment, everyone knew that someone was intentionally destroying Skyriver Continent. Those 3 Deities knew that as well, but they couldn’t find Yang Ye!

Three old men stood high above in the high, and they had horrifyingly gloomy expressions on their faces.

They were the 3 Deities that had rushed back here from Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region!

“Elder Cang, we can’t let him continue!” An old man in a luxurious robe spoke solemnly to the leader of their group, an old man who held a pitch black cane.

A moment of silence ensued, and then the old man with the cane shook his head, “His skill in concealment is too formidable. My divine sense has swept through the entire continent, but I haven’t been able to detect him!”

The other old man who wore a black robe spoke in a low voice, “What does he want?!”

A long moment of silence ensued before Elder Cang replied, “If I’m not wrong, his goal is to help Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region.”

The old man in a luxurious robe frowned, “He’s trying to help Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region?”

Elder Cang nodded, “Lady from Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region helped him in the past, so their relationship is definitely not ordinary. So, he definitely launched this surprise attack on our continent to force us back here and alleviate the pressure on Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region.”

The old man in a luxurious robe gazed at Elder Cang, “So what do we do now? Do we continue pursuing him?”

Elder Cang looked down at the continent below him, and then he remained silent for a long time before speaking again, “Besides a few living fossils, there are no Deities in the lower dimensions that are capable of fighting that kid now. We’ve lost.”
