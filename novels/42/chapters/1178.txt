Chapter 1179 – Eat! All 5 Kilograms Are Yours!

When she saw the serious expression on Yang Ye’s face, Ye Liuyun hesitated for a moment before she turned around to gaze at one of the people who stood far away from her. That person nodded slightly and left.

Song Jiji was first stunned when he heard Yang Ye, and then he dug his ear and asked, “What did you say? I didn’t hear it clearly. Repeat it again, alright?”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Song Jiji when he appeared once more. Song Jiji’s pupils constricted as he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to attack without saying anything and even do so with such speed. Because even he was only able to see a blurry shadow flash before him!

Song Jiji was caught off guard and unable to dodge, so he had no choice but to wave his saber swiftly!

However, Yang Ye didn’t try to dodge it at all. He just allowed the saber to strike his head while his fist slammed against Song Jiji’s chest.

Clang!

Bang!

Yang Ye’s figure didn’t move at all, but Song Jiji’s figure curved forward as his figure was blasted flying. But Yang Ye suddenly appeared before him just a moment later. Song Jiji was horrified and swung his saber once more, but Yang Ye still didn’t dodge and just slammed his fist forward again!

Clang!

Pu!

Yang Ye’s figure still didn’t move from the impact, but Song Jiji spat out a mouthful of blood while his figure was blasted flying again. Yang Ye suddenly appeared in front of Song Jiji when his figure had just started flying backwards, and then Yang Ye grabbed Song Jiji by the throat before slamming him against the ground!

Bang!

The ground cracked apart while Song Jiji’s head sunk into the ground.

Since Yang Ye attacked until the battle ended, less than 3 breaths of time had passed. So, many in the surroundings were still stunned.

The other members of the Cyclops Mercs had finally recovered from their shock at this moment, and they were about to attack. However, Yang Ye suddenly gazed at them and said, “Take another step forward and I’ll break his head open!”

Their expressions changed, and they didn’t dare to move another inch forward.

Yang Ye raised Song Jiji out from the ground and stomped his foot against Song Jiji’s Dantian. After that, he turned around and gazed at Ye Liuyun.

Ye Liuyun nodded slightly, and then one of them men waved his right hand. A huge basin appeared beside Song Jiji’s head. As for its contents.... Just the smell coming from it made Song Jiji start to vomit!

Yang Ye nodded slightly and said, “Eat! Eat all of it! I’ll pull off your head if you miss a single drop!”

Song Jiji’s expression changed. He hesitated for a moment before he said, “Brother, I, Song Jiji, admit defeat. Please show me some mercy!”

Meanwhile, Ye Liuyun walked over to Yang Ye’s side and said, “He’s called the cyclops, but we like to call him the ungrateful bastard. Actually, he wasn’t the leader of his mercenary group. At that time, it wasn’t even called the Cyclops Mercs, it was called the Breeze Mercs instead. He was a brother that the leader of the Breeze Mercs had acknowledged. But in the end, he joined forces with Ma Rong to kill the past leader of the Breeze Mercs. In the end, for the sake of taking full control of the mercenary groups, he and over 100 more took turns with Ma Rong.... He is absolutely heartless and without any limits. He can’t be allowed to live!”

Yang Ye immediately discarded some thoughts when he heard her, and then he looked down at Song Jiji, “Eat! All 5 kilograms are yours!”

Song Jiji’s face was gloomy, “Brother, must you really go to such extents?”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “I like to act according to the person. As for you, I think that I should go to such extents. Because if we didn’t possess enough strength, then the outcome that awaited us would definitely be 10 times worse than what you’re facing right now. I don’t like to torture, but I like to give tooth for tooth! Now, begin!”

As he spoke, Yang Ye’s foot pressed down slightly, and then it was immediately visible that Song Jiji was in pain.

Meanwhile, Song Jiji howled furiously, “Kill him!”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly drew his sword and swung it. A ray of sword energy flashed, and then the head of a Quasi Emperor who was about to attack had instantly flown into the air while a fountain of blood surged behind it!

Yang Ye glanced at the other members of the Cyclops Mercs and said, “Stand still. Move and die!”

Their expressions changed while shock and fear filled their eyes. After all, the strength to kill a Quasi Emperor in an instant was too heaven defying!

Yang Ye ignored them and looked down at Song Jiji, “Feed him!”

Ye Liuyun waved her right hand upon hearing Yang Ye. In an instant, a man walked forward and raised the basin towards Song Jiji’s mouth.

“Stop!” Song Jiji howled, “Fucking stop! Stop....”

No one stopped, of course. They watched as the cyclops, Song Jiji, was fed.... Around 15 minutes passed before the basin was empty.

“Burp!” Meanwhile, Song Jiji burped, and then some of what he’d just swallowed instantly came out from his mouth.

Song Jiji didn’t speak. He just gazed at Yang Ye, yet his eyes had no resentment in them. There was only extreme calm in his eyes, and it seemed like he wasn’t the one who’d just consumed 5 kilograms of shit.

Yang Ye gazed at Song Jiji and chuckled, “Are you thinking about how you’ll take revenge on me in the future?”

Song Jiji’s expression changed in an instant, and then he revealed a pleading gaze as he said, “Big Brother, I was wrong. I was ignorant to have offended you, and I’ve been punished now. So, I hope that Big Brother will show mercy. I’m willing to lead my Cyclops Mercs to join you, Big Brother, and serve you faithfully!”

“Your acting isn’t bad!” Yang Ye continued, “Unfortunately, that won’t work on me!”

As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, Song Jiji knew that his fate couldn’t be changed. So, his expression instantly turned savage as he spoke with resentment, “I....”

Hiss!

He hadn’t even been able to speak more than a word before a ray of light flashed by, and then his head left his body.

Yang Ye put his sword away and turned to look at the other members of the Cyclops Mercs, “Surrender and live, resist and die!”

Ye Liuyun waved her right hand, and the members of the Sword Alliance immediately surrounded the Cyclops Mercs. As expected, all of them surrendered before Yang Ye. Because one of them was unwilling and had chosen to flee, and then he was slaughtered in an instant!

None of them wanted to die!

Once all of them surrendered, Yang Ye said, “Enter the city!”

Cloudfall City wasn’t very big, and it was only large enough to accommodate a few hundred thousand. However, it was temporarily sufficient for Yang Ye’s group. There was practically no one within the city, and even if they spotted a few figures, those people were cultivator who were about to perish due to a lack of spirit energy.

Once they entered the city, everything was carried out in an orderly manner under Ye Liuyun’s command, and all the required work was divided amongst them. This made them feel even more convinced of Ye Liuyun’s ability to lead them.

Yang Ye was very satisfied as well!

In a simple hall, Yang Ye sat on a chair while Ye Liuyun stood in front of him.

Ye Liuyun said, “May I know why you’ve summoned me here, Sword Master?” Her voice carried a trace of respect. She was a smart person and usually knew how to act and what to do.

Yang Ye pointed at the chair in front of him, “Sit!”

Ye Liuyun hesitated for a moment and sat there.

Yang Ye gazed at her for a long time and said, “Miss Ye, you’re a smart person. To be honest, you’re the only person amongst all of them who is capable of making me value you. Now, let’s have an honest talk.”

Ye Liuyun pondered deeply for a short while before she said, “Alright!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Miss Ye, what plans do you have for the future? I want to know your true thoughts!”

Ye Liuyun remained silent for a short while and said, “I don’t have any special plans. I just want to lead my companions before and survive together!”

Yang Ye stood up and said, “This world is a cage that has imprisoned everyone in here. Even if you attain the Emperor Realm, it’s impossible to break out of this world. Miss Ye, you should be aware that the spirit energy in this world is actually on the verge of drying up, right? Once that happens, all of us will die without exception. I’m sure you won’t refute that, right?”

Ye Liuyun gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Sword Master, what are you trying to say?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Do you want to leave this world?”

She suddenly stood up and gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, “Can I ask you a few questions?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Go on!”

Ye Liuyun asked, “Do you have someone’s backing?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m all alone in this world. I have no backing!”

She fell silent for a short while before she asked, “Where are you from?”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a short while before he replied, “From outside this world!”

Her pupils constricted, and she gazed at Yang Ye for a very long time before she took a deep breath, “One last question, did you establish the Sword Alliance because you want to grow into the 6th Diamond Rank power of this continent?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Would it make a difference even if we become the number one power in this world? My objective is to lead everyone out of this world! Miss Ye, you should want to see the outside world as well, right?”

Ye Liuyun clenched her fists, “No one has been able to leave for tens of thousands of years!”

“That’s because I hadn’t arrived then!” Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “Now, I’m here.”

A long time passed before Ye Liuyun slowly took a knee before him and said, “I, Ye Liuyun, swear my allegiance to you!”

Yang Ye helped her up and said, “My character isn’t suitable to manage the Sword Alliance, but you’re extremely suitable. Many people in the Sword Alliance are content with how things are now, and I hope that you can change that. Besides that, I hope that everyone will be able to get stronger as soon as possible. Saints and Quasi Emperors are too weak. Not only are they unable to survive in this world, it’s absolutely impossible for them to survive outside this world.”

Yang Ye flicked a spatial ring over to her and continued, “I kept 1,000 out of the 5,000 violet crystals I extorted from the Dark Sky Sect, and you can manage the rest.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Ye Liuyun didn’t refuse and took the spatial ring. After all, the city needed violet crystals for many things right now, and 4,000 were actually not really enough.

Yang Ye added, “Presently, I need 2 things from you. Firstly, everyone must try their best to get stronger. I’ll release the spirit vein in the city later. You can distribute some violet crystals to our members who are about to break through or possess good natural endowment. Let them advance first. As for how to manage all of that, you can do as you see fit. Secondly, help me gather information about something. It’s called the Stellar Sword Diagram.”

“The Stellar Sword Diagram?” Ye Liuyun spoke with surprise, “Sword Master, you’re looking for the Stellar Sword Diagram?”
