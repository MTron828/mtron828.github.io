Chapter 77 – Is It Worth It?

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief when he saw them stop moving. He knew that with his identity as a Talisman Master, these guards wouldn’t make a move against him. When he faced those members of the Flower Palace just now, Yang Ye had thought about revealing his identity as a Talisman Master, but he didn’t in the end. Because he was afraid that death would arrive even sooner if he did so!

When they saw the badge in Yang Ye’s hand, one of the guards that seemed to be the leader said in a deep voice, “You’re a Talisman Master?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The leader bowed to Yang Ye and said, “I’ll report what you’ve done in Southpeace City to the Talisman Master’s Association. Please let me know your name and rank.”

“Yang Ye, Grade Four Talisman Master!” Yang Ye spoke indifferently. He knew that this was the rule. If he concealed it or refused, then these people had the authority to capture him.

The leader cupped his fists to Yang Ye, and then he turned around and shouted to the others. “Dismiss!”

The status of a Talisman Master was even loftier than nobles in the Grand Qin Empire, and even some nobles that were conferred titles of nobility had to bow to Talisman Masters. So, since this person that annihilated Southpeace City’s Liu Clan and the City Governor was a Talisman Master, this matter wasn’t something that he could interfere in, and the people above him in ranks would get in contact with the Talisman Master’s Association instead.

When they heard this, all of them didn’t hesitate to turn around and leave, and in less than a few breaths of time, all of them had vanished beneath the night sky.

After he watched them leave, Yang Ye gazed at the Talisman Master’s badge in his hand, and he said in a low voice, “It really is an awesome thing.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s figure flashed and vanished beneath the night sky.

......

In that stone house where Feng Yu and Little Yao were hiding before this, Qing Hong’s group of three were sitting while facing each other.

As she gazed at the candlelight that flickered indeterminately on the stone table, Qing Hong said in a low voice, “Big Brother, do you think Yang Ye will be fine?”

Man’zi said in a low voice, “Little Hong, it isn’t suitable for us to stay here any longer. We must leave as soon as possible. It’s best to leave the city immediately and never make an appearance here again.”

Man’zi still felt slightly fearful towards those members of the Flower Palace. Their strengths were utterly not something his group could go against, yet the three of them were guarding the people those members of the Flower Palace wanted to capture. Fortunately, those members of the Flower Palace weren’t bloodthirsty figures, otherwise, the three of them would have probably been transformed into corpses.

Qing Hong shook her head and said, “Big Brother, let’s wait a while longer. If Yang Ye is fine, then he’ll definitely come looking for us!”

As he gazed at Qing Hong who remained stubborn, Man’zi sighed and said, “Little Hong, Big Brother knows what you’re thinking. Brother Yang is outstanding indeed, but we’re people of two worlds. Even if he isn’t captured by them, it’s impossible for the two of you to be together.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

After depending on each other for over 20 years, how could Man’zi be unaware of Qing Hong’s thoughts? He was originally extremely supportive of this because Yang Ye was truly too outstanding after all. So, if Qing Hong was able to be by his side, then she would definitely not have to live such a dangerous life.

However, after he found out that Yang Ye was someone the Flower Palace intended to capture, he’d changed his mind. It wasn’t because he was a despicable fellow that only cared about personal gain, and it was purely because he didn’t want his younger sister to be mixed up in the matter between Yang Ye and the Flower Palace. Because enmity of such level was utterly not something little mercenaries like them could endure.

Qing Hong’s face turned slightly red from being exposed by her older brother. However, she didn’t refute it or conceal it, and she asked instead. “On what basis can we not be together? Big Brother, haven’t you heard of that saying? Love is irrespective of strength, age, or sect. So long as two people love each other, then nothing is a problem!”

Xiao Hei who’s remained silent all this while glanced at Qing Hong, and then he shook his head and continued playing with the blade in his hand.

Man’zi puckered his lips and said, “Little Hong, do you yourself believe those words? Alright, even if those words are true. But do you and Yang Ye love each other? Only a silly little girl like you would fall in love with him after just meeting him once. My dear sister, both of you’ve only met twice since you’ve known each other! How could you have fallen in love with him?”

Qing Hong glared at Man’zi and said, “A fellow that only knows how to visit brothels like you wouldn’t understand. I’m not going to waste my breath on you any longer.”

Actually, Qing Hong only had an unusual feeling towards Yang Ye at that time, and it was far from being able to be called love. The reason it had transformed into love now was that it was a transformation that had occurred while she lived together with Little Yao and Yang Ye’s mother. She’d found out about Yang Ye’s past from Little Yao and Yang Ye’s mother.

It could be said that Yang Ye’s attitude towards his family, and Yang Ye’s spirit of being unyielding before difficulty had moved her.

When he heard Qing Hong expose his deeds, Man’zi’s face turned red, and he said, “My dear sister, listen to your Big Brother’s advice and forget Brother Yang! Let’s continue our lives as mercenaries. Even though it’s slightly dangerous and arduous, we feel at ease in the heart.”

“If you want to leave then leave. In any case, I won’t be leaving!” Qing Hong puckered her lips and spoke in a slightly angry manner.

Man’zi laughed bitterly, and then he looked at Xiao Hei that had remained silent since the beginning. He said, “Xiao Hei, clarify your position alright? Will you leave or stay?”

Xiao Hei glanced at Man’zi, and then he wrote a single word on the table with his dagger ‘Stay’.

Man’zi was instantly infuriated. Right when he was about to say something, Yang Ye walked into the stone house.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief when he saw the three of them who sat before the table. He was just about to speak when a figure had already pounced into his embrace, and it caused Yang Ye’s body to instantly stiffen.

Qing Hong hugged Yang Ye forcefully and said, “You’re alright.... You’re alright....”

Yang Ye pushed her away lightly. When he saw that Qing Hong’s face was covered in tears, his heart softened, and he immediately stretched out his hand to wipe her tears as he said, “Big Sister Qing Hong, thank you.”

As he spoke, he gazed at Man’zi and Xiao Hei who remained at the side and said, “Thank you, Brother Man’zi and Brother Xiao Hei. Thank you for protecting my mother and younger sister.”

Man’zi smiled and said, “Brother Yang, there’s no need to mention it. If it wasn’t for Brother Yang, then the three of us would probably already be dead. Moreover, Brother Yang even paid us. So, no matter what, we should try our best to protect Brother Yang’s family. However, those people from tonight....”

Yang Ye shook his head and interrupted what Man’zi was about to say. He said, “I understand. Those people weren’t existences that Brother Man’zi and everyone else could resist. I don’t blame all of you for this. I came looking for all of you today.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye withdrew a saber and dagger from within Bloodhand’s spatial ring, and then he said, “Both these Dark Treasures are at the high-grade of the Yellow Rank, and it’s my compensation and thanks for protecting my younger sister and mother for this period of time.”

Man’zi hurriedly waved his hand and said, “Brother Yang, what’re you saying? The Dark Treasures and gold you gave us that day has already far exceeded the price to hire us. Moreover, the three of us weren’t able to properly protect your younger sister and mother. So, how could we possibly bear to take these two treasures now?”

Xiao Hei shook his head from the side as well.

Yang Ye placed them on the stone table and said, “Don’t refuse, this is my heartfelt intent. Moreover, these two Dark Treasures are nothing to me, yet to the both of you, they’re treasures that can improve your strengths!”

Man’zi still intended to refuse, yet Qing Hong said from the side, “Big Brother, take it.”

When they heard this, Man’zi and Xiao Hei hesitated for a moment, and then they took the treasures from the stone table. Man’zi cupped his fists and said to Yang Ye, “Thank you, Brother Yang!”

Xiao Hei cupped his fists towards Yang Ye as well in order to display his gratitude.

After they took the treasures, Man’zi and Xiao Hei exchanged glanced before they sensibly withdrew themselves from the stone house, and they left it to Qing Hong and Yang Ye.

After she noticed that they’d left, Qing Hong looked at Yang Ye and said, “Did you hear everything I said just now?”

Yang Ye was first stunned, and then he said with a slightly dazed expression, “Big Sister Qing Hong, what do you mean?”

Qing Hong didn’t speak, and she just stared at Yang Ye without unblinking.

After a short moment, Yang Ye couldn’t keep it up, and he nodded. Actually, when he’d just arrived outside the stone house, he’d heard Man’zi persuading Qing Hong to give up on him. At that time, for the sake of avoiding any embarrassment, Yang Ye hadn’t entered the house, and he listened outside for some time. In truth, he was slightly surprised at that time because he’d never imagined that this sexy and beautiful woman before him would actually like him.

Even though he was slightly surprised, Yang Ye didn’t have any other thoughts. What he desired the most now was to quickly improve his strength and rescue his mother.

Qing Hong’s face blushed slightly red when she saw Yang Ye nod, and then she averted her gaze. For a time, the atmosphere was slightly embarrassing.

After staying silent for a while, Yang Ye hesitated for a moment before he withdrew a scroll and the Crimson Red Sword he’d won from Jiang Yuan, and he passed it to Qing Hong as he said, “Big Sister Qing Hong, this is a Yellow Rank movement technique and a low-grade Profound Rank sword. It’s for you.”

“Why?” Qing Hong gazed at Yang Ye as she asked this question.

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “There’s no reason. I like to give it to you, so I gave it to you!”

Qing Hong stared at Yang Ye for a short moment, and then she received the scroll and sword from him before she said, “I’ll work hard to become strong, and I’ll work hard to catch up to your footsteps. I’ll wait for you to rescue your mother. I don’t need any promises, nor do I need you to persuade me!”

Yang Ye’s heart shook. After a long time, he sighed lightly and said, “Is it worth it!?”

Qing Hong gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Is doesn’t matter whether it’s worth it or not. I like you, so I’m acting in this way.”

Yang Ye. “....”

Yang Ye left an hour later. As she gazed at the direction Yang Ye left towards, Qing Hong’s left hand ceaselessly rubbed the pitch black ring on a finger on her right hand. The ring was something Yang Ye had given her before he left, and it didn’t just contain the movement technique and sword he’d given her, there was also over 1,000 Energy Stones within it!

A long time later, Qing Hong muttered in a low voice. “I’ll work hard to catch up to your footsteps....”
