Chapter 2791 – Yang Ye! Get Out Here!

Along with Jian Wudi’s death, numerous figures flashed out from behind Monarch Yan. In just a short while, around 20 huge demons appeared in the sky above Universe City. Besides that, there were around 30 towering giants. Every one of them was at the peak of the Destiny Realm.

Moreover, an endless stream of mysterious beings were still emerging.

Some of them were at the Destiny Realm while others weren’t.

Everyone in Universe City turned ghastly pale from the sight of this.

The Four Dimensional Universe was here in full force!

At this moment, they understood what the Four Dimensional Universe was planning.

They were here for a final battle to decide the war’s outcome!

At this moment, the hearts of everyone in the city sank.

The city had started to fall into slight panic when they saw Jian Wudi being killed in an instant.

Terror was like a plague that swept through Universe City, and so some started fleeing the city.

Terror could sometimes make people risk everything in battle and reveal strength far beyond what they were usually capable of, but it could also instantly cause the collapse of a person’s mind.

In the city.

Liu Yuan spoke abruptly, “What about the city?”

Ding Shaoyao shook her head, “Ignore it.”

Liu Yuan nodded and didn’t say anything else.

Ding Shaoyao looked up, and the experts of the Four Dimensional Universe filled the sky. Moreover, more and more experts were ceaselessly emerging from the pitch black vortex.

Even though there were no more than 50 Destiny Realm experts among them, there were countless other experts up there!

The Four Dimensional Universe was truly attacking in full force!

Ding Shaoyao spoke softly, “Activate the formation!”

Chen Dao’zi nodded and vanished on the spot. A moment later, the huge circle of light in the sky shook violently, and then countless beams of light surged up into the air and shot at the experts from the Four Dimensional Universe.

Monarch Yan took a step forward, stretched his right hand out slowly, and gently pressed it down.

Bang!

The beams of light instantly exploded apart and were obliterated!

Ding Shaoyao and the others’ expressions changed once more. Their faces were quite unsightly!

Monarch Yan’s strength was much, much stronger than before!

Ding Shaoyao commanded again, “Activate the formation!”

Bang!

At this moment, formations appeared all over the universe, and then countless beams of light that contained terrifying energy traveled through space and arrived in the air above Universe City.

The Universe Formation!

Ding Shaoyao had activated the strongest formation in Universe City!

Meanwhile, a huge barrier of white light suddenly appeared in the sky from within the city. After that, numerous powerful beams of light shot up into the air. Coupled with the beams of light that arrived from all over the universe, the entire army from the Four Dimensional Universe was enveloped by the beams of light.

Monarch Yan remained indifferent. He didn’t go head-on against the formation. While he had the strength to destroy the formation, he didn’t want to waste his energy on it. After all, the Three Dimensional Universe still had Yang Ye, Qi Bitian, Tian Xiu, and the three other forms of Destiny.

Monarch Yan retreated, and so did the other experts of the Four Dimensional Universe. They retreated behind the black vortex.

A moment later, the beams of light arrived before the black vortex. Meanwhile, the black vortex started spinning rapidly, and then waves of terrifying devouring force swept out from the black vortex.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Horrifying sounds of shattering resounded through the sky.

The beams of light started to be obliterated inch by inch before the devouring force of the black vortex!

Ding Shaoyao and the others had gloomy expressions on their faces as they watched.

“Unleash the formation again!” Ding Shaoyao’s voice resounded once more.

Meanwhile, the entire city shook violently, and then an invisible wave of light suddenly rippled up into the air!

Everywhere the wave of light passed, space was sliced open and turned ethereal as if it had been sliced open by a sharp blade! It was absolutely shocking!

As soon as the beams of light in the sky vanished, the wave of light carried a wave of monstrous might as it slammed against the black vortex.

Boom!

A moment of silence ensued, and then it sounded like a thunderclap rumbling in their ears!

After that, the sky above the city turned pitch black. It was like the sky had collapsed. Meanwhile, both the wave of light and black vortex were still within the pitch black hole in space, and they were ceaselessly destroying and devouring each other!

Ding Shaoyao gazed at the black hole for a long time. Suddenly, she turned around and walked off. A moment later, she arrived on the streets, and Yang Ye was in front of her!

Yang Ye gazed at the sword before him with a slightly blank expression in his eyes. He had a deep frown on his face, and he seemed to be slightly struggling. He seemed to be in some pain, and it was like he’d encountered some sort of dilemma.

Ding Shaoyao gazed at Yang Ye for a long time. In the end, she turned around and spoke softly, “Show yourselves!”

As soon as she said that, a group of sword cultivators appeared before her!

It was the sword cultivators of the Ancient Sword Sect!

They were led by Gu Nie!

Ding Shaoyao spoke softly, “Your strength is insufficient to participate in a battle of this level, so staying here is pointless. Now, I order you to leave Universe City for the various other worlds in this universe. Now that the war is here, many powers and people will start wars to fuel their greed, and I need all of you to patrol the universe and suppress them. If you encounter any injustice, you are authorized to kill first and report later.”

Gu Nie glanced at Yang Ye and was slightly hesitant.

Ding Shaoyao spoke softly, “All of you are the future hope of the Three Dimensional Universe.”

Destiny Realm experts may not survive this battle. Even if they did, very few would survive. So, these sword cultivators before her were the future of the Three Dimensional Universe.

They couldn’t be allowed to die here!

Otherwise, the Three Dimensional Universe’s inheritance and civilization would die here.

Gu Nie fell silent for a long time, and then he nodded. He led the others to Yang Ye, and all of them fell to one knee.

Gu Nie gazed at Yang Ye and spoke softly, “Sect Master, take care of yourself!”

A short while later, all of them silently left Universe City.

Just as Ding Shaoyao had said, once the Four Dimensional Universe attacked with everything it had, the entire Three Dimensional Universe fell into chaos. Not everyone had the resolve to fight to the death. In such a hopeless situation, the darkest parts of many fully emerged to the surface. If no one was there to suppress all of this, the entire Three Dimensional Universe would become hell.

Ding Shaoyao glanced at Yang Ye, and then she left.

In front of Universe Hall. Everyone gazed at Ding Shaoyao, and she spoke softly, “We must buy some time for him!”

The others nodded!

Meanwhile, a huge palm suddenly swept through the pitch black hole in space.

Bang!

The violent energy in the black hole was instantly swept away!

A moment later, the black hole gradually healed.

Once the space there fully healed, the experts from the Four Dimensional Universe led by Monarch Yan appeared once more before Ding Shaoyao and the others.

Monarch Yan glanced at them, “It’s such a rare occurrence to see Yang Ye not showing himself when things have already come to this. Hmm… Wait! It seems all of you are buying time for him!”

Ding Shaoyao didn’t say a word and just looked toward a certain point in the city, “Activate the formation!”

Bang!

Another wave of light surged up from the city.

As soon as it charged out of the clouds, the entire sky suddenly turned ethereal. The entire world seemed unreal before the impact of this powerful force!

Monarch Yan frowned slightly in midair. This time, he didn’t choose to retreat because the black vortex had been destroyed!

Monarch Yan took a step forward and pressed his right hand down. A huge palm that was over 3km long appeared in the sky above the city. It descended straight down like the sky was collapsing upon the wave of light!

Bang!

The entire sky shook violently. At the same time, a wave of energy rippled out through the sky.

Meanwhile, the wave of energy and the huge palm were instantly blasted into bits. Behind the huge palm, Monarch Yan shot around 300m back, and his countenance turned slightly pale!

Even though he’d forcibly stopped the wave of light, it had clearly not been that easy!

Monarch Yan looked down and waved his right hand. Countless mysterious creatures suddenly shot toward the sky from behind him!

All of them were people and living beings at the Destiny Realm or below. The true peak Destiny Realm experts remains in the sky above the city.

Liu Yuan spoke solemnly by Ding Shaoyao’s side, “They plan to attack the entire universe. Do you have a countermeasure?”

Ding Shaoyao nodded, “I’ve gotten help with that!”

Liu Yuan glanced at Ding Shaoyao and remained silent, but just a moment later, she said, “If he doesn’t show himself, we can’t reassure everyone!”

Ding Shaoyao replied softly, “Time, we need time!”

She glanced at Huang Ying and Liu Yuan, “Send the experts of the desolate race and War Dimension away from here. Ask them to fight against those experts below the Destiny Realm!”

Liu Yuan and Huang Ying nodded, and then practically all the experts below the Destiny Realm left the city and shot off in all directions.

Suddenly, everyone here looked up.

A huge black palm had appeared once more, and then it slammed down toward the city!

The palm hadn’t even fully descended when the powerful aura it emanated caused everyone here to reveal solemn expressions on their faces!

Bang!

A wave of light surged up into the air once more.

The entire world shook violently as soon as the wave of light and huge palm came into contact, but at this moment, a shadow slammed against the wave of light.

Bang!

The wave of light shattered, and then the huge palm descended toward the city!

Suddenly, a figure shot up into the sky.

Yin Yang Goddess!

She formed a seal in midair and then an ethereal shield that was black and white appeared before her.

She pressed her palms forward gently, and a strand of Yin Yang Energy surged into the shield. An instant later, the shield slammed against the huge palm!

As soon as they collided, the shield exploded into bits, and Yin Yang Goddess shouted furiously at the same time, “Yin Yang Divine Annihilation!”

As soon as she said that, a strand of mysterious energy slammed against the huge palm.

Boom!

The huge palm shook violently and was obliterated.

Meanwhile, an afterimage shot down from the sky. Yin Yang Goddess’ eyelids twitched from the sight of this, and she hurriedly shot backward, “Yang Ye, I’ve done my best. I’m really no match for this guy, so I’m fleeing now!”Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished into the sky.

Monarch Yang didn’t chase after her. He just looked down at Universe City, “Yang Ye, get out here!”

His voice was absolutely ferocious.
