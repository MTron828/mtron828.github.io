Chapter 1592 - An Approaching Storm!

Translator: InVader

Little Sky hurriedly shouted, “Little Mud, stop! He isn’t the one who wants to bully me!”

As soon as Little Sky spoke, the energy around Yang Ye vanished in an instant.

Little Sky walked over to Yang Ye and spoke in a concerned tone, “Are you alright?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Little Sky, be clearer next time!” If his body wasn’t strong, he may have been torn into pieces.

Little Sky stuck out her tongue and spoke slightly apologetically, “Alright, I’ll definitely pay attention to that. Don’t be angry!”

Yang Ye rolled his eyes at her and glanced at the surroundings. He knew that the spirit of the earth was here, but he was puzzled by why it hadn’t shown itself!

Meanwhile, Little Sky turned around and looked towards the distance, “Little Mud, prepare yourself. I’ll call for you when it’s time to fight.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Little Sky turned to look at Yang Ye, “Let’s go.”

Yang Ye asked, “She agreed?”

“Of course!” Little Sky said, “We frequently played together in the past. She’ll definitely help me if someone wants to bully me.”

Yang Ye glanced at Little Sky. Now, he was quite worried about the Nether Pavilion. This little girl before him wasn’t easy to bully at all. Not to mention her own strength, just her friends were extraordinary existences!

What about her own strength?

After all, she wasn’t without any strength, and she had just sealed her own strength. In other words, she may be able to unseal it when it was necessary. So, how strong would she be then?

It was a mystery!

However, Yang Ye knew that if nothing unexpected happened, then he would find out very soon.

Once they left the underground area, Little Sky and Yang Ye returned to the Sprite Palace. After that, Little Sky immediately summoned all the Sprite Kings and Snowy to the Sprite Palace’s main hall, Sprite Hall.

Little Sky sat at the seat of the host and Snowy was on her shoulder.

The woman in a fiery red dress was on their right. Her name was Tang Huo, and she could be considered to be the manager of the Sprite Palace before Snowy came. Actually, she could still be considered the manager as Snowy didn’t manage anything.

Countless Sprite Kings were at the center of the hall. Some had taken human form while some remained in their original form. This wasn’t the main point, the main point was that there were over 200 Sprite Kings here! Sprite Kings of all types!

It could be said that at least 90% of all the Sprite Kings throughout Merak System were here.

Little Sky glanced at them and said, “We’re going to fight a battle.”

The Sprite Kings didn’t say anything and just gazed at Little Sky.

Little Sky continued, “I refused to fight, but we have no choice but to fight this time. If those bad fellows are allowed to conquer this universe, they’ll definitely plunder everything. Moreover, they’ll enslave all the races of our world! We refuse to be slaves!”

Snowy raised her claw and waved it at Little Sky like she was saying that she would support Little Sky until the end.

Meanwhile, countless Sprite Kings made their stands clear as well. Even though the way they did it varied a little, all of them supported Little Sky without exception.

Little Sky nodded, and then she clenched her fist, “We don’t like to fight, but we’re absolutely not afraid of a fight. From now onwards, prepare yourselves, and let’s fight when the time comes!”

The Sprite Kings nodded, and then they left. It didn’t take long for only Yang Ye, Little Sky, Tang Huo, and Snowy to remain in the hall.

Little Sky gazed at Snowy, “Snowy, where’s that pearl of yours?”

Snowy blinked, and then she opened her mouth. The Spirit Pearl instantly emerged from within.

Little Sky took the pearl, glanced at it, and returned it to Snowy, “Snowy, I’ll teach you a game later. When we fight, you don’t have to do anything, just do as I tell you, alright?”

Snowy quickly nodded while excitement filled her eyes. Obviously, she looked forward to fighting as well!

Little Sky rubbed Snowy’s head, and then she gazed at Tang Huo, “Practically all these little fellows have never fought a battle. They’ll definitely be quite chaotic when the battle breaks out. You have to train them a little.”

“Alright!” Tang Huo nodded, “I’ll go make the necessary arrangements!”

She turned around and left once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye suddenly said, “You can ask the other powers of the continent to help.” If all the living beings on Sky Sky Continent were to converge together, it would definitely be extremely terrifying. At the very least, they would be able to gather over 1,000 Rebirth Realm experts!

Little Sky shook her head, “They won’t!”

“Why?” Yang Ye was puzzled, “If the Nether Pavilion occupies this world, they will gain nothing from it.”

Little Sky replied, “Regardless of whether it’s the humans, demons, or other races, as far as they are concerned, even if the sky falls, there’s always someone greater to stop it. They won’t become anxious until their interests have been truly harmed.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “Moreover, they won’t trust each other. If we gather them together, they might fall into chaos before the fight with the Nether Pavilion even begins.”

Yang Ye fell silent. Because Little Sky was absolutely correct. Regardless of whether it was the demons, humans, or the other races, they would definitely not let their experts risk their lives when the Nether Pavilion hadn’t harmed their interests at all.

The races feared each other and were wary of each other. So, unless there was no other choice, they would never unite as one. Moreover, it was just as Little Sky had said. Even if they joined forces, they would definitely be scheming against each other.

Meanwhile, Little Sky suddenly said, “I’m going to take a nap!”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, “You’re going to sleep at a time like this?”

She shook her head, “It won’t be for long this time. Don’t disturb me for the next two days!” As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and went deeper into the hall.

Snowy flew over to Yang Ye’s shoulder and gently rubbed her head against Yang Ye’s face.

Yang Ye rubbed her head gently, “no matter what, I won’t let anyone harm all of you.”

Snowy flew in front of Yang Ye, clenched her little claws, and acted as if she was very strong right now.

Yang Ye chuckled, “Alright, alright! You’re very formidable! You protect me from now on, alright?”

Snowy hurriedly nodded.

Yang Ye embraced Snowy, kissed her on the forehead, and smiled, “Come, let’s make a trip to the lower dimensions.”

As he spoke, he vanished on the spot with Snowy in his arms.

Sky Sky Continent may be about to fall into chaos.

Even though Little Sky’s forces were extremely strong, the Nether Pavilion wasn’t weak. Not to mention anything else, just Nether Maiden and the others were extremely terrifying, but the Nether Pavilion had countless other experts.

Little Sky was his friend, and the ten Nether Halls were his friends too. He naturally didn’t wish to see them fight. However, he was very well aware that it couldn’t be helped. Persuade Little Sky to surrender? Was that possible?

If he persuaded Blood Maiden and the others to not fight Little Sky, it represented that Blood Maiden and the others would have to betray the Nether Pavilion! He could see that they had a truly strong sense of belonging to the Nether Pavilion, or they wouldn’t have always considered themselves members of the Nether Pavilion.

As for who to help… Actually, it was pointless regardless of who he chose to help. Because he was too weak when compared to either side. Of course, he knew that he wasn’t able to avoid the battle.

However, he refused to think too much about all of it right now. In any case, he would know what to do when the time came.

…

The lower dimensions.

Yang Ye brought Snowy to Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region.

At this moment, Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region was clearly the most powerful power in the lower dimensions. Even though its strength wasn’t the strongest in the lower dimensions, was anyone here unaware that its lord, Zhuang Weiran, was Yang Ye’s wife?

Did anyone in the lower dimensions not know Yang Ye? Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Yang Ye had killed his way into the large world!

Moreover, some of Yang Ye’s accomplishments in the large world had found its way to the lower dimensions. As they spread, those accomplishments changed. For example, Yang Ye had almost annihilated the Divine Phoenix Clan in the large world, but in the lower dimensions, the rumor was that Yang Ye had almost annihilated the entire demon race!

Another example was how Yang Ye had killed numerous Rebirth Realm experts in the large world, but in the lower dimensions, the rumor was that he killed Rebirth Realm experts like dogs.

In short, Yang Ye’s reputation was extremely great. Presently, there was no power throughout the lower dimensions that dared to not give face to Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region and the Sword Alliance.

Yang Ye snuck back into Clouds of Heaven City with Snowy.

Clouds of Heaven City. Wargod Hall.

In the hall, Zhuang Weiran was discussing some matters related to Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region. Suddenly, she frowned slightly, and then a wisp of happiness flashed through her eyes. She gazed at the others and said, “We’ll be stopping here. Everyone can leave.”

Even though they didn’t understand why she was doing this, they still left.

Once they left, Yang Ye appeared in the hall.

She spoke softly, “You’re back.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Is everything alright?”

She nodded slightly, “Everything is fine. Are you still going to leave again?”

Yang Ye walked over to her, took her hand, and spoke softly, “This time, our universe might fall into chaos.”

She asked, “What happened?”

Yang Ye told her about the upcoming battle between the Nether Pavilion and Merak System.

Zhuang Weiran fell silent for a long time before she shook her head slightly, “The tree may wish to be still, but the wind never ends.”

“Yes!” Yang Ye sighed. To be honest, he didn’t want to fight every single day. After all, he wasn’t a battle addict like the Unfettered one. But it couldn’t be helped. There were many things that were unavoidable.

Simply speaking, even if you don’t cause trouble, it doesn’t represent that trouble wouldn’t find you!

In the next few days, Yang Ye just accompanied Zhuang Weiran and the others. However, he didn’t forget to cultivate.

Time trickled by.

Ten days later.

The large world. Sprite Palace. Sprite Hall.

Little Sky was sleeping in a room within the inner hall of Sprite Hall.

Because of her instructions, no one had disturbed her throughout these days.

Suddenly, she opened her eyes, “They’re here?”
