Chapter 2797 – If There is Life After Death!

In the starry sky, the sword cultivator traveled slowly. He wasn’t moving fast at all, and it was more like a stroll.

All his life, the sword cultivator had been thinking as he traveled!

He’d thought about many things, and the Sword Dao was only one of them!

The sword cultivator’s Sword Dao was the Emotionless Sword Dao, and its essence was naturally in having no ties.

With no ties in the heart, the sword would have no ties or shackles.

It was a very terrifying Sword Dao, of course.

But during this time, and especially after he left the Four Dimensional Universe, the sword cultivator realized that he lacked something.

He’d been thinking about that.

He sought the extremes of the Sword Dao, the peak of it! He sought to be invincible in the Sword Dao!

He advanced very quickly, so quickly that few could ever keep up with him. Or to be more precise, he was above the Three Dimensional Universe and Four Dimensional Universe.

The peak of the Sword Dao was so lonely like snow!

It was empty and puzzling as well!

He was at the end of the road, so what laid beyond it? Continue forward? Was that possible? How?

He wasn’t the woman in the clouds, his objective had always been very simple!

Seek defeat!

All he wanted was to be defeated!

The sword cultivator looked up slightly, and his gaze passed through space and arrived above the clouds.

The woman before the Go board seemed to sense his gaze and looked down. She grinned, “You’re almost here? The extremes of the Emotionless Sword Dao, amazing!”

The sword cultivator restrained his thoughts and started traveling in that direction.

It wasn’t a place in the Three Dimensional Universe or Four Dimensional Universe. He could sense the existence of that place, but he couldn’t accurately determine its location.

Of course, that wasn’t a problem. Because he could sense its direction, and that was all he needed!

As for the path there… There was nothing he couldn’t resolve with a swing of his sword!

The woman was still playing Go on her own high above the clouds, but she didn’t have an opponent anymore.

She seemed to have thought of something at this point, and she placed her hand on Justice and patted it.

A sword howl resounded, and then a ray of light shot down through layers of space. In the end, the sword arrived in the sky above the sword cultivator.

The sword cultivator looked up and flicked his thumb.

His sword left its sheath!

In the sky, two swords stabbed against each other.

Tip against tip!

Hiss!

In an instant, the space throughout the area was blasted into bits, layer by layer.

A short while later, a sword descended firmly before the Go board.

The woman looked down from the clouds and smiled, “Interesting!”

The sword cultivator didn’t say a word. He just sheathed his sword and continued forward!

As far as he was concerned, he didn’t fear a strong opponent, he feared having no opponent!

…

The Three Dimensional Universe.

In the sky above the ruins of Universe City, rays of sword energy were erupting like fireworks. Everywhere they passed, space was blasted into bits and obliterated. A short while later, the entire sky seemed like it had a huge spider web running through it!

A short while later, two figures split up in the sky.

Yang Ye stood there with sword in hand, and the space beneath him was trembling violently. Monarch Yan was standing 300m ahead of him.

Both of them failed to do anything to their opponent until this point in the battle!

Monarch Yan shot a glance at the city below. At this moment, the Four Dimensional Universe had the upper hand. Once all the Destiny Realm experts of the Three Dimensional Universe perished, the Three Dimensional Universe would be finished.

Of course, he was very well aware that the most important enemy to defeat was this young man who stood before him!

This young man’s existence made everything uncertain!

Monarch Yan pondered deeply for a moment and said, “Yang Ye, why do you insist on protecting this universe? If you choose to leave, you can go much, much further!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Monarch Yan, if you leave, you can do the same, right?”

Monarch Yan gazed at Yang Ye for a long time. In the end, a wisp of complicated emotions flashed through his eyes, “We’re the same type of person. Unfortunately, our views differ. Don’t worry, if I kill you, I will spare your loved ones. It’s my way of showing respect to you!”

Yang Ye smiled, “You’re right, our views do differ.”

As he spoke, Yang Ye shot a glance down below. The entire universe was covered in the flames of war.

Chaos!

He’d never seen a universe in such chaos!

Especially at a time like this. Once the Four Dimensional Universe’s experts had entered the Three Dimensional Universe, it had even fallen into chaos internally.

Yang Ye wasn’t a kind person, nor was he someone who wanted to save the world. But there was something he knew, and it was the helplessness and despair of the weak!

Because he’d been part of them once!

Perhaps it was compassion, pity, or something else, but he felt like he should do something.

As he thought like that, he put it into action!

Moreover, he had a bunch of people following him. The War Dimension, the desolate race, the various powers throughout the universe, Snowy, Ding Shaoyao, Su Qingshi…

Fight!

It was his only choice!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and looked at Monarch Yan. This time, he didn’t waste his breath and just tapped down the tip of his foot. His figure shot up like a hawk. At the same time, Monarch Yan vanished on the spot.

Hiss!

A sharp hiss resounded through the sky!

It was the sound of space being torn open by Monarch Yan’s physical strength!

Yang Ye suddenly stopped in midair, and then he looked up. A fiery fist was sweeping toward him.

He’d experienced this same move a few times now.

Actually, the lightning itself wasn’t that terrifying, but it was terrifying because it had fully merged into one with Monarch Yan! So, the strength it could display wasn’t just a tiny bit. Moreover, Snowy couldn’t do anything to it!

Because the lightning was Monarch Yan, and Monarch Yan was the lightning.

Snowy couldn’t counter it at all!

Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly against this. He stomped his right foot down and soared into the sky.

A sword howl cracked open the sky!

A ray of sword energy stabbed against the fist!

Bang!

The sky shook violently, and they immediately split apart. But just a moment later, Yang Ye pressed forward and swung his sword at Monarch Yan.

It was an attack that carried speed, strength, and the determination to decide their fate in one clash!

Yang Ye was utilizing his Fate Sword Dao with practically every single attack he launched against Monarch Yan. Because he didn’t dare act carelessly at all, and if he didn’t put his full strength behind every attack, it may result in his death instead!

Monarch Yan didn’t dare to act carelessly against this attack of Yang Ye’s as well. Every single swing of Yang Ye’s sword had the desire to determine their fate, and so the slightest carelessness may end in his death.

Monarch Yan clenched his right hand. In an instant, a strand of flames enveloped him. He pressed his palms together while fiery arcs of lightning rippled out incessantly. At this moment, the space in the entire area was burning.

Yang Ye’s sword arrived!

Boom!

A rumbling explosion resounded. The fiery lightning around Monarch Yan dispersed into the surroundings while his figure was pushed back repeatedly. At the instant he was pushed back, Yang Ye didn’t stop. He shot over and swung his sword over and over again!

Every one of them with the Fate Sword Dao!

Rumble!

Sword howls and explosions resounded through the entire sky, and Monarch Yan was being pushed back repeatedly.

In just a short while, he’d been blasted all the way into outer space!

Their battlefield had moved!

The confidence and morale of the experts from the Three Dimensional Universe rose explosively from the sight of this. Since the beginning, they’d been afraid that Yang Ye would fall because they would be finished once that happened!

Because no one else could stop Monarch Yan!

But now it seemed like Yang Ye was actually able to suppress Monarch Yan!

This allowed those experts from the Three Dimensional Universe to experience an explosive rise in their confidence and morale!

Meanwhile, Ding Shaoyao walked slowly toward a certain spot in the distance, and Chen Dao’zi was by her side.

Even though Chen Dao’zi was at the Destiny Realm, his combat strength wasn’t that great.

Ding Shaoyao led Chen Dao’zi out of the ruins of Universe City, and they arrived at a mountain range. Ding Shaoyao clapped, and a group of black robed figures appeared before her.

There were around 30 of them!

The black robed figure who led the group took a knee before Ding Shaoyao, “Strategist!”

All of them were experts of the divine race!

Ding Shaoyao nodded slightly, “How’s the preparations?”

The black clothed figure replied, “Everything has been prepared!”

Ding Shaoyao led Chen Dao’zi forward, and it didn’t take long for a huge open expanse of ground to appear before them. It was huge, and it was covered in all sorts of mysterious symbols.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Chen Dao’zi gazed at her, “Miss Ding, what is this?”

She replied softly, “It’s a teleportation formation that my divine race built a very long time ago. Of course, it’s nothing before someone like you.”

Chen Dao’zi spoke solemnly, “You want me to rebuild it?”

Ding Shaoyao nodded, “Is that possible?”

Chen Dao’zi fell silent.

Ding Shaoyao said, “The Three Dimensional Universe is weaker, and it’s no match for the forces from the Four Dimensional Universe without the help of formations. We have a spot that’s naturally suited to establishing a formation here, and I’ve gotten the gourd with spirit energy from Snowy too. We even have enough forces here.”

She gazed at Chen Dao’zi.

Chen Dao’zi nodded, “Then let’s begin.”

Ding Shaoyao nodded slightly, and then she glanced at the black robed figure, “Senior Chen’s orders are like my own!”

The black robed figure took a knee, “Understand!”

Ding Shaoyao turned around and left!

Once she left the mountain range, Ding Shaoyao suddenly stopped because a middle aged man was standing 300m to her right.

The middle aged man was Emperor Li!

Emperor Li gazed coldly at her, “You’re one of Yang Ye’s women, right?”

Ding Shaoyao grinned, “If I’m not wrong, you dare not go to him, so you chose to seek out the people by his side in order to threaten him, right?”

Emperor Li’s eyes narrowed slightly while undisguised killing intent could be seen in them.

Ding Shaoyao chuckled, “Emperor Li, you were an outstanding figure once. I never expected you to do something so beneath you. However, it’s understandable. Desperate times come for desperate measures!”

Emperor Li replied indifferently, “Do you have anything else to say?”

Ding Shaoyao grinned and looked up at the starry sky. She wasn’t very strong, so she couldn’t even see Yang Ye’s figure right now.

But she knew that he was up there.

At this moment, the scenes of the past and her past with Yang Ye appeared in Ding Shaoyao’s mind.

Ding Shaoyao gently combed the hair by her ear, “Actually, I’ve always owed you an apology, and I’ve always wanted to tell it to you. Unfortunately, I’ve never had the chance. Now… the one I love, if there is life after death, all I want is to be yours.”

Emperor Li was about to attack.

Bang!

Suddenly, Ding Shaoyao burst into flames.
