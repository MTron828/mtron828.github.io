Chapter 2771 – Descent!

In the boundless starry sky, Yang Ye looked ahead with a trace of worry in his eyes.

He was worried about many people!

Qi Bitian, Tian Xiu, Yang Busi, the woman in white, Erya…

Erya!

Yang Ye’s heart sank when he thought about her.

Erya had stopped attacking him, so he knew that she definitely hadn’t fully forgotten about him and Snowy.

Of course, Erya wasn’t the same Erya anymore!

Everything was gradually changing!

Besides being here to stop the Four Dimensional Universe, Yang Ye’s second goal was to find Tian Xiu and Qi Bitian!

He hoped all of them would be fine and well!

He didn’t want to lose any of them!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly and the Sword Precursor was beneath his feet.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Snowy laid there on the Ascension Platform, and the pair of horns were before her.

Erya’s horns!

Since Erya left, Snowy wasn’t as carefree as she’d used to be. She was mostly silent, and she would stay silent for a long time.

No one dared to disturb her!

A long time passed before Snowy touched the horns gently, and then spirit energy tears gradually flowed out of her eyes!

…

In the distant starry sky, at an unknown abandoned planet, a black shadow suddenly descended here.

Bang!

The black shadow descended, causing the ground in a huge area to collapse!

Meanwhile, a group appeared nearby. They were led by the mysterious expert from the End World. He was covered in black energy, and his appearance was impossible to discern!

Shu Wubian, Zuo Mu, Emperor Li with his newly recovered body, and the others were all behind him.

All of them were looking at the petite figure ahead!

They frowned upon seeing it clearly.

It was a young girl!

A young girl with dark red horns, and there was a long, dark red tail behind her.

The young girl’s eyes were dark red too. She had an indifferent expression on her face, and the aura she emanated aroused a solemn expression on all their faces!

The Evil Beast!

Emperor Li was about to attack, but the mysterious expert shook his head, “She isn’t the same Evil Beast you knew. You’ll die if you attack her!”

Emperor Li gazed at the mysterious expert, and the latter spoke softly, “It’s the Evil Beast who once dared to challenge Destiny. All of you stand back.”

Emperor Li glanced at Zuo Mu and was quite hesitant, but Shu Wubian had already retreated.

They were facing the real Evil Beast!

Shu Wubian glanced at them, “Move farther away if you don’t want to die!”

She was 30km away once she finished speaking.

Zuo Mu and the others hesitated for a moment, and they chose to retreat in the end.

They didn’t know how terrifying the real Evil Beast was, but they knew how proud Shu Wubian was. But at this moment, she hadn’t hesitated to shrink back, and just that was enough to prove many things.

A short while later, only the mysterious expert and Erya remained here.

Erya walked slowly in the mysterious expert’s direction. He crossed his arms before his chest and asked, “Is Yang Ye not here?”

Erya suddenly stopped.

The mysterious expert stretched out his right hand and clenched it. In an instant, a wave of terrifying energy surged out of his right arm!

Meanwhile, a small fist slammed down at him!

Bang!

The energy emanated by the mysterious expert was instantly obliterated before the punch. At the same time, the mysterious expert was pushed over 3km back!

As soon as he stopped himself, his figure floated forward like a phantom.

Erya suddenly slammed another punch forward.

As soon as her fist shot forward, a foot kicked it.

Bang!

The space here collapsed and formed a pitch black hole in space!

Erya suddenly unfurled her fist and grabbed the mysterious expert’s leg, and then she pulled him toward her. After that, she raised her right knee at him!

However, the mysterious expert reacted very quickly. As soon as he was pulled to Erya, he swiftly overlapped his palms and slammed them down at Erya’s knee.

Bang!

The mysterious expert was instantly blasted over 30km away!

Emperor Li and the others’ expressions turned extremely solemn from the sight of this.

While the mysterious expert hadn’t exposed too much of his strength, it was extremely terrifying. But at this moment, he was at a disadvantage against Erya!

The others gazed at Erya, and they wondered how strong her physical strength was!

Suddenly, the mysterious expert’s figure turned ethereal, and then everyone gazed at Erya.

An afterimage soundlessly appeared before Erya, and the latter remained indifferent as she slammed a punch at it.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and Erya was blasted over 10km away. Meanwhile, another afterimage appeared before her. She stomped her foot down, soared up into the air, and stomped down!

Boom!

Erya was blasted away. Meanwhile, another afterimage soundlessly appeared behind her, and then a finger tapped on her back!

Besides that, afterimages appeared on her left, right, top, and bottom. At this moment, she was surrounded by them!

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Muffled explosions resounded throughout the sky, and then a figure was blasted backward repeatedly!

It was Erya!

Zuo Mu and the others seemed to visibly relax at the sight of this, and they gazed at the afterimages. Obviously, the mysterious expert had started to gradually reveal his strength!

Suddenly, Erya, who was being suppressed, slapped her palms forward.

Boom! Boom!

The world shook before this attack, and the afterimages around her were instantly blasted into bits.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The mysterious expert’s main body was pushed backward repeatedly until he arrived right before Zuo Mu and the others.

Erya looked up at him, and her hands were emanating a scarlet red glow! Besides that, the dark matter around her had started to collapse!

The mysterious expert crossed his arms before himself, “Did Yang Ye send you?”

Erya’s face gradually turned ferocious. Suddenly, she leaped up, and then she shot toward them like a shooting star!

The mysterious expert pulled his arms back, and then Zuo Mu and the others were instantly teleported far away. Meanwhile, Erya had arrived above him.

This time, she didn’t use her fists and just slammed herself at him!

The mysterious expert raised his hands slightly. In an instant, a pitch black energy shield appeared between his hands. At the instant the shield fully condensed into form, Erya’s body had arrived before it!

Bang!

The shield exploded into bits upon coming into contact with Erya’s horns. However, the mysterious expert suddenly pressed forward at this moment and slammed a punch against her head. His fist flickered with a mysterious pitch black glow!

Boom!

Erya was blasted away while the mysterious expert was instantly pushed 30km away!

Threads of blood flowed down Erya’s forehead, and her face instantly turned blood red.

Meanwhile, she stared at the mysterious expert!

“Kill her?” Suddenly, Shu Wubian spoke from the mysterious expert’s side.

The mysterious expert shook his head, “We can’t kill her. At least not in my current state.”

Meanwhile, Erya suddenly charged at the mysterious expert. She wasn’t very fast, but every step she took caused the world to tremble before her!

Strength!

Pure physical strength!

Shu Wubian and the others had extremely solemn expressions on their faces. Her physical strength was truly too terrifying!

The mysterious expert waved his right hand, and a huge blue circle of light appeared beneath them. A moment later, their figures started to turn ethereal.

However, Erya had arrived above them.

The mysterious expert slapped his right palm upward.

Boom!

A wave of powerful energy stopped Erya’s attack!

Meanwhile, he twisted his right hand.

Bang!

The energy exploded apart and pushed Erya backward repeatedly.

Meanwhile, the mysterious expert and the others had vanished.

Erya wiped off the blood on her face and looked up into outer space. Her scarlet red eyes seemed slightly bewildered, “Why do I want to kill him…?”

A short while later, she wiped off the blood on her face again, and then she looked up, “Kill…”

She stomped her right foot down and shot up into the sky.

Her figure tore through everything in her path!

Meanwhile, a group appeared in the starry sky, and they were led by the mysterious expert.

He looked up into the distance, and then he suddenly looked back. The space below was shaking violently as if something was coming!

Shu Wubian was livid, “She’s coming! Shall we join forces and kill her?”

The mysterious expert shook his head, “We can’t!”

Shu Wubian gazed at the mysterious expert and was very puzzled, “Why?”

The mysterious expert replied softly, “Her strength is growing. If we collide head-on with her, she may exhaust all of you to death, so it’s best not to confront her directly!”

He waved her hand, and a huge teleportation formation appeared below them.

Meanwhile, Shu Wubian mocked him, “So we’re going to be cowards?”

The mysterious expert suddenly gazed at her, and then a wave of powerful energy pushed her out of the teleportation formation.

The mysterious expert said, “Since you think you’re very strong, you can face her yourself.”

They vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Shu Wubian’s face was terrifyingly gloomy.

Suddenly, a wave of energy surged up from below toward her.

Shu Wubian looked down and raised her hands slightly. In an instant, countless vines shot out from the space below!

Meanwhile, a petite figure appeared before those vines!

A punch shot forward!

Boom!

The vines exploded apart, and then Erya appeared before Shu Wubian. The latter’s expression changed drastically, and she hurriedly retreated. Erya didn’t chase after her and just swung a punch from afar!

Boom!

Shu Wubian was instantly punched away.

Her figure cracked open in midair while blood sprayed incessantly from her mouth.

Erya was about to attack again when she suddenly looked up. A woman was looking down at her from somewhere above the clouds.

Erya gazed at her, and then she suddenly raised a thumb at the woman before pointing it downward!

The woman high above the clouds grinned. She waved her hand, and a sword by the Go board flew into her grasp.

She descended from the clouds with her sword in hand!
