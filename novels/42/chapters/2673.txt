Chapter 2674 – Does That Make You Angry?

Shock!

At this moment, Yang Ye had truly been shocked by Erya!

He knew she was very strong, extremely even. She was the physically strongest existence he’d ever met.

However, lifting up a mountain range was quite unusual!

After all, while it wasn’t a very huge mountain range, it still covered a distance of over 300km, and it had over a dozen mountains that towered into the clouds!

But it could be fucking lifted?

Suddenly, Erya fell to the ground.

BOOM!

The entire mountain range crashed down, causing the earth to quake. At the same time, a storm of dust and dirt covered the sky!

Erya gasped intensely on the ground.

Yang Ye and Snowy hurriedly over. Yang Ye helped her up, and he noticed that her face was completely red. It had been caused by overuse of strength.

Snowy quickly sent her some spirit energy.

Just like that, around an hour passed before Erya finally recovered.

After that, she sighed softly and seemed quite dejected, “I still can’t do it!”

Yang Ye asked, “Erya, are you cultivating that technique you obtained in the Destiny Dimension?”

Erya nodded and passed it to Yang Ye, “Do you want to cultivate it too?”

Yang Ye flipped it open, and he laughed bitterly upon reading the first page.

He couldn’t cultivate it!

The strength requirement was too, too great!

For example, the 1st move, World Explosion. Its name was actually derived from the fact that it was so amazing, it would blow the minds of the entire world… In order to cultivate this move, one had to possess strength that could shake the earth. Or to be more precise, it was the strength to move at least over a dozen mountains and over 300km of earth.

But he couldn’t even move a single mountain!

He could slice a mountain apart with a swing of his sword, but he really couldn’t move one. Of course, Erya could.

Yang Ye knew that the Six Crushers was something that only Erya may be able to cultivate successfully!

Even the Primal True Dragon couldn’t!

Its strength requirement was just too, too huge!

Yang Ye thought for a moment as he gazed at Erya’s dejected face, and then he said, “Erya, you can’t do it in one go. You have to take it slow. For example, try moving a single mountain first?”

Erya’s eyes lit up. Right, I should move one first!

Erya jumped to her feet and went over to the nearest mountain.

The mountain was 3km tall and over 3km wide.

Erya was absolutely tiny before the mountain, and she was so tiny that it was like an ant standing before a human.

At this moment, this ant intended to move a human, and that was quite amusing indeed.

However, Erya was no ant.

She gazed at the mountain in silence, and then she suddenly pressed her right claw against the mountain wall.

Rumble!

The entire mountain started to tremble!

Boom!

A moment later, it cracked apart…

Erya stopped at the sight of this and frowned. Because if she exerted more force, the entire mountain would collapse!

Suddenly, a voice came from the side, “Don’t use brute force!”

It was a familiar voice!

Yang Ye looked over and saw An Nanjing!

He grinned, “You’re done?”

She nodded and walked over to Erya, and then she spoke softly, “Your strength is great, but it needs to be more flexible. You can try to disperse your strength to every corner of this mountain.”

Erya thought for a moment and nodded, and then she walked over to the mountain.

She placed her claws on the mountain wall.

Just like that, she started to exert force slowly.

An Nanjing spoke slowly from Yang Ye’s side, “Her strength is entirely sufficient to move that mountain, but she isn’t very used to her strength. It’s like how our strength can crush an egg with ease, so unless you can control your strength, the egg would be crushed. Holding and destroying are two different embodiments of force.”

Yang Ye nodded and gazed at Erya. At this moment, the mountain was moving slowly. It was gradually moving. Even though there were many cracks on it, it didn’t shatter.

Obviously, Erya was gradually starting to master her own strength.

Snowy was ceaselessly cheering Erya on from the side. Actually, she wanted to move a mountain too, but she couldn’t even push a rock forward!

An Nanjing gazed at Yang Ye, “Can we talk?”

Yang Ye nodded.

They walked off to the peak of a mountain behind the Sword Sect, and there was a spear following behind An Nanjing.

It just followed her. During this time, the spear had even provoked Yang Ye, or it should be said that it had provoked Heaven Executor.

Heaven Executor naturally responded to that, but Yang Ye stopped it.

As for the Dagger-Axe, it became much more obedient after An Nanjing gave it a slap!

An Nanjing looked up into the distance and spoke softly, “After I obtained this spear, I received the inheritance within it. But I also learned some things.”

Yang Ye asked, “What things?”

She replied softly, “Some things about the Destiny Era.”

Yang Ye said, “Tell me about it.”

She remained silent.

Yang Ye turned to look at her and spoke softly, “What is it?”

She looked up at him, “I have to go somewhere.”

Yang Ye frowned, “Where?”

She replied, “Where the owner of this spear was.”

Yang Ye said, “I’ll go with you!”

She shook her head slightly, “I’m going on my own.”

Yang Ye was quite puzzled, “Why?”

She gazed at him and replied softly, “There are things that I must do myself. Otherwise, I’ll never become stronger.”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a long time. In the end, he nodded.

Just like that, An Nanjing left.

She left with Dagger-Axe.

Yang Ye was a little sad. Of course he wanted An Nanjing to stay. But as she’d said, she had to walk her path on her own, and it was the only way for her to become stronger!

She wanted to grow stronger!

She didn’t want Yang Ye to leave her behind!

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden, Nether Maiden, and the others appeared before Yang Ye.

They had restored their bodies with Snowy’s help. Actually, the difference wasn’t that huge. Of course, it was mainly due to Snowy’s help.

Snowy was truly the most extraordinary existence in the entire Primordial Pagoda!

It was just that the little fellow was always playing around and didn’t have a huge presence, nor did she act like an extraordinary expert. So, she was usually overlooked a little! Actually, she was really, really amazing, and she could do many, many things!

But she was just too playful!

Blood Maiden suddenly said, “We’re leaving too!”

Yang Ye smiled wryly, “Second Sister…”

Blood Maiden spoke softly, “The world is huge, and we plan to travel it.”

Yang Ye replied in a bitter tone, “You can just travel the pagoda!”

Blood Maiden shook her head, “We don’t want to stay in this small world. There are no possibilities in here. Or to put it in simpler terms, it’s just as An Nanjing said. We’re leaving to take our own paths.”𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye shook his head.

Blood Maiden patted him lightly on the shoulder, “We’ll meet again.”

She turned around and vanished into the sky with the others.

They’d left!

Blood Maiden and the others had left without the slightest hesitation. It wasn’t that they wouldn’t miss this place, but they were very well aware that they would have no path ahead if they stayed.

Life and the Martial Dao required experience and effort!

The Primordial Pagoda felt much quieter now.

Yang Ye glanced in the direction of the Sword Sect. Su Qingshi and the others lived there. Actually, Xue’er was much older now.

Actually, even he wasn’t that young anymore.

He’d been too busy throughout his path from Profounder Continent until now, and he’d rarely had days of peace!

Rumble!

Suddenly, a loud explosion pulled Yang Ye back from his thoughts.

Yang Ye looked to the side, and he saw a mountain gradually rise from the ground.

Erya had lifted the mountain!

It seemed quite exaggerated and unreal, but it was really being lifted up!

Yang Ye was actually shocked by this. After all, her petite figure contained such terrifying strength!

Suddenly, the mountain exploded apart and countless rocks rained down from above.

Yang Ye hurriedly tapped his finger forward. In an instant, countless rays of sword energy flashed through the sky and obliterated the rocks in midair!

Yang Ye flashed over to Erya. At this moment, Erya’s face was flushed red, and she was gasping for air.

Obviously, it hadn’t been easy for her!

Yang Ye quickly asked, “How do you feel?”

She glanced at him and cracked a smile, “I’m fine! I can still go on!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “Erya, cultivating is good, but you must not overdo it. Understand?”

Erya nodded, “Don’t worry, I won’t be rash.”

She gazed at Snowy and continued, “I’ll be fine with Snowy here!”

Snowy hurriedly nodded.

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “Alright, you can continue. Remember to take it slow and don’t injure yourself. Besides that, it’s best if you go somewhere else. This place is too close to the Sword Sect!”

“Alright!” Erya nodded and impatiently vanished into the distance with Snowy.

A short while later, rumbling came from afar.

Yang Ye shook his head, smiled, and left the pagoda.

As soon as he left the pagoda, a man appeared nearby.

A man covered in an evil aura!

The man’s gaze descended onto the sword on Yang Ye’s waist and spoke fiercely, “Heaven Executor! That woman actually gave it to you.”

Yang Ye glanced at the man, “You’re Mo Yu?”

The man gazed at Yang Ye, “I am. Why? You’re planning on begging for mercy? If you kneel down and beg, then I may spare you!”

Yang Ye shook his head and drew Past Life, “See? Heaven Executor isn’t all I have. I have Past Life too. I have two of them. Does that make you angry? Does it?”
