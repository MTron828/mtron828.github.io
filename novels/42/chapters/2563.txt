Chapter 2564

Yang Ye unfurled the scroll, and within it were some of the secret organizations the desolate race possessed in Eternal Kingdom.

The desolate race had left these organizations behind very, very long ago. They usually stayed away from the Eternal Kingdom’s business and merely served the desolate race.

Now, Yang Ye could use them too!

Because the pitch black command token before him was a Desolate Token that was comparable to being in the presence of their Junior Patriarch!

Yang Ye’s heart felt warm as he gazed at the command token. He didn’t refuse this kindness because he really needed help right now.

Yang Ye put the command token and scroll away, and then he left his abode.

In the Ancient Sword Sect.

Along with Yang Ye’s arrival, the entire sect seemed to have found its pillar of support and gradually calmed down.

However, the atmosphere here in the sect was still heavy and tense.

Because all the disciples were aware that the sect had been sealed up by the Soul Sect.

Now, they couldn’t leave and could only wait here!

Wait slowly until the attack arrived!

They were quite lost when it came to the future!

Actually, Yang Ye was rather lost too!

Yang Ye went to the sect’s main hall, and a huge statue stood there!

It was the statue of a middle aged man with a sword in his grasp.

It was the sect’s founder.

As for the founder’s name and strength, it was all unknown.

Because it had been too, too long. Not to mention the current disciples, even Sword Scroll didn’t know. But she wasn’t entirely without any knowledge on him.

Sword Scroll spoke softly, “According to rumor, he wandered the world and merged the Sword Daos of them all, and then he created his own Sword Dao! So that sword cultivators wouldn’t fall into a decline, he created a sword sect. Unfortunately, for some reason, there are no records of what happened during his time!”

She gazed at Yang Ye, “That young girl in the pagoda, Qi Bitian, should be one of the few who are aware of what happened during those ancient times.”

Qi Bitian!

Yang Ye felt quite speechless when he thought of her.

Gomoku and soccer!

She was especially fond of those two things!

“I shouldn’t have made you take over of this mess!” Sword Scroll spoke abruptly, “I’m sorry, I never expected it to turn out like this.”

Sword Scroll felt extremely guilty about the situation Yang Ye was in right now. She was a huge reason why he was the Ancient Sword Sect’s Master right now!

Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t blame yourself. I accepted this responsibility, and it has nothing to do with you. Moreover, I’ve been wandering the world for so many years, and it’s the first time I’ve had such a prestigious position! The Ancient Sword Sect’s Master, it’s a very precious title.”

She glanced at him and remained silent.

Yang Ye looked up at the sky. He could still say the expanse of darkness from here.

The entire Ancient Sword Sect was surrounded by that expanse of darkness.

Yang Ye grinned and said, “Help me summon all the sect’s disciples.”

Sword Scroll glanced at Yang Ye and left.

Around 10 minutes later, all the sect’s disciples were before Yang Ye. The 11 elite disciples led the ground, and Gu Nie was leading the elite disciples. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye even saw Mo Ya, Lu Yunxian, and the others among the disciples.

Yang Ye stood there with his sword in hand as he glanced at them, “I’m sure you’re aware about the situation out there, so I won’t keep it from you. Yes, the Soul Sect has sealed off the area. That area is being protected by a Super Divine Treasure, so I can’t break it open for now!”

They fell silent.

Yang Ye smiled, “Are you afraid?”

Sword howls resounded.

They were filled with the desire to fight!

It was their answer to his question!

Yang Ye grinned, “That’s good to know. Because we may die in the upcoming battle. I’m not lying, any one of us may die. What I want from you is to remember that we will die! However, we must take someone with us before that happens. Even if our sect is going to vanish from the Eternal Kingdom, we must tell the world that we are no cowards, and we will die on our feet!”

The disciples’ blood started to boil when they heard him.

Not cowards!

They were sword cultivators, and as far as sword cultivators were concerned, there were only broken swords, no bent swords! If they surrendered, their swords would have to bend, and they would never be able to stand up straight again as sword cultivators!

Fight to the death!

Yang Ye didn’t lie to them and say the Ancient Sword Sect would definitely win, nor did he say something like good would triumph over evil. He was very frank and told them they may die!

Fight to the death!

Yang Ye’s objective was simply, he wanted them to fight to the death and perhaps pave a way through!

If they weren’t even afraid of death, there would be nothing in this world that could make them hesitate to fight.

If they were fearless, they would be unmatched!

As he gazed at these sword cultivators, Yang Ye suddenly understood a little. He understood why he’d stayed!

Trust!

These disciples and all the other elders who stayed behind had put their trust in him!

Even though many knew that his ascension to the position of sect master was just a scheme plotted by the Grand Elder’s group, they still chose to stay and take his side. It was because they trusted him!

Trust!

This group of people trusted him!

Just like this very moment, if he asked them to fight the Soul Sect to the death, they wouldn’t hesitate to do it!

Meanwhile, Gu Nie suddenly walked over to Yang Ye. Yang Ye glanced at Gu Nie. Needless to say, he was a genius in the Sword Dao, and he was one of the few elite disciples in the sect who could kill Lord Realm experts!

Gu Nie looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “If a war breaks out again, will you flee?”

Flee!

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye.

They knew Yang Ye’s strength well. In the entire sect, there were a few who could avoid the war and survive, like Yang Ye, Gu Nan, and the other Lord Realm experts!

If they focused on escaping, they had a very good chance at success!

Yang Ye glanced at Gu Nie and smiled, “I won’t.”

Gu Nie gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “From this moment onward, my life is yours, and I will do anything you ask of me!”

The Ancient Sword Sect!

The sect was home to many disciples. Especially those who grew up here, this was truly their home!

Many of them were willing to give up their lives to protect this home of theirs!

It was a form of responsibility, and it was something the Ancient Sword Sect had taught them from a young age, but it was no form of brainwashing. After all, independent cultivators usually suffered in universes like the Eternal Kingdom!

A sense of belonging!

They had a strong sense of belonging to the Ancient Sword Sect!

Yang Ye glanced at Gu Nie and grinned, “So you didn’t acknowledge me as the sect master before this?”

Gu Nie spoke frankly, “Yes, I felt you would leave, sooner or later.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Then what about now?”

Gu Nie replied, “I was wrong, and so were the Grand Elder and the others. We, the disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect, would rather die than surrender to the Soul Sect!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Everyone has their own choices to make!”

Gu Nie glanced at the distant sky and fell silent.

After that, Yang Ye returned to his abode and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Cultivate!

As far as he was concerned, no matter what the Soul Sect did next, all he could do was cultivate, work hard on growing stronger, and then face the Soul Sect’s attack!

Of course, he always spent some time playing Gomoku and soccer with Qi Bitian… He had to grab tightly to such a great source of support!

As for Qi Bitian, she grew increasingly fond of Yang Ye, and would sometimes take the initiative to guide him. Qi Bitian’s guidance was absolutely beneficial to Yang Ye!

As for the two fruits before the bamboo house, Yang Ye acted like he hadn’t noticed them. He couldn’t do anything about it! Moreover, he didn’t want to do anything. Because he noticed that her presence was very beneficial to them!

Qi Bitian had the ability to help them grow too. However, unlike Snowy, her ability was to help them improve on a certain aspect. For example, creating a new type of space without any restraints that allowed them to grow freely!

Simply speaking, they had no upper limits!

As for Snowy, her ability was to improve their speed of growth!

In short, it was very beneficial to keep Qi Bitian happy!

Outside the pagoda.

The Soul Exalt gazed coldly at the Ancient Sword Sect standing in the distance and smiled coldly.

The woman in a black dress was by his side.

A short while passed before the Soul Exalt glanced at her, “Ye Ying, I told you not to act arbitrarily. You refused to believe me, and so you suffered, right?”

Her face was icy cold as she remained silent.

The Soul Exalt shook his head, “Just stand on guard here.”

Ye Ying suddenly asked, “When are we attacking?”

The Soul Exalt glanced at the distant sky, “If nothing unexpected happens, we’ll be starting immediately!”

He turned around and left.

A short while later, the Soul Exalt appeared in the sky. He closed his eyes slowly and said, “Show yourself! Once I’m done with you, it’ll be the Ancient Sword Sect’s turn!”

He planned to deal with the person supporting Yang Ye!

It was why he still hadn’t acted against the Ancient Sword Sect. Their goal was to first deal with Yang Ye’s support.

Meanwhile, footsteps arose from behind him.

The Soul Exalt said, “It’s time to put an end to this.”

A voice came from behind him, “Allow me to be honest, I can crush ten of you with one hand.”
