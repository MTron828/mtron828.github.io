Chapter 376 – The 5th Level!

Yang Ye paid no further attention to Mo Ke and the others, and he sat down cross-legged and started to cultivate as well. At this moment, the Sword Spirit’s voice suddenly resounded in his mind. “I suggest that you head to the 5th level!”

Yang Ye’s brows knit together slightly as he asked. “The 5th level?”

“Your current strength is at the peak of the King Realm, and your cultivation is very stable. However, advancing into the Spirit Realm requires an extremely huge amount of energy. Even though you can advance here as well, you will absolutely be slower than Mo Ke, Hun You and Luo Xue. Because they are half a step into the Spirit Realm, so they’ll be able to step foot into the Spirit Realm within 2 days at most!”

Yang Ye’s brows knit together even more tightly when he heard this. However, he didn’t really mind because it was merely a level higher!

As if she knew Yang Ye’s thoughts, the Sword Spirit’s voice resounded once more. “Don’t think that you can surmount a realm of cultivation to challenge a Spirit Realm expert. After all, the profound energy within a Spirit Realm profounder has condensed a step further, and it has become an Aura. A Spirit Realm profounder can warp their opponents’ attacks that enter within the scope of their Aura! This ability can be said to be very lethal to profounders below the Spirit Realm!”

“Aura?” Yang Ye was puzzled. “What’s that?”

“You’ll understand when you attain the Spirit Realm! In short, if they attain the Spirit Realm before you, then perhaps you can still survive, but these fellows behind you will definitely be no match for a few attacks from them!”

“How long would I need to attain the Spirit Realm if I were to cultivate here?”

“Three days!”

Yang Ye smiled bitterly when he heard this number. Perhaps 3 days was extremely swift for others, but it was slightly slow to him! If it was like the Sword Spirit had said, then someone from amongst Mo Ke, Hun You, and Luo Xue would have definitely attained the Spirit Realm before these 3 days could pass. Once they became a Spirit Realm expert, then it would definitely be a calamity to the human profounders on his side!

After pondering deeply for a long time, Yang Ye said, “Can I head up to the 5th level?”

“How would you know without giving it a try?”

Yang Ye fell silent. After a short while, he suddenly smiled. The ancient sheath’s Sword Spirit is right! How would I know that I can’t if I don’t give it a try?

So, Yang Ye stood up and walked towards the entrance to the 5th level.

Meanwhile, everyone in the surroundings had opened their eyes and looked at Yang Ye.

“You’re overestimating your ability!” A wisp of ridicule arose on the corners of Hun You’s mouth.

Mo Ke frowned while a pondering expression arose in his eyes.

Luo Xue revealed an expression of extreme interest instead.

Yang Ye disregarded their gazes and walked over to the entrance of the 5th level. There was a thin blue barrier of light there. The barrier of light was crystalline, translucent, and flickered with brilliant light. Besides that, there was nothing extraordinary about it!

Yang Ye gazed at the blue light barrier for a short while before he flipped his palm, and Dragonbone appeared in his grasp. The profound energy within him instantly surged into Dragonbone. At the same time, the Nether Ghostflame attached itself to Dragonbone!

Yang Ye’s figure suddenly spun swiftly by exerting force from the tip of his foot, and then Dragonbone slashed forward horizontally towards the blue light barrier!

Bang!

Yang Ye’s expression changed as soon as his sword came into contact with it. Because a terrifying and enormous force had suddenly rebounded from the blue light barrier, and it caused his arm to instantly feel numb while his figure was blasted flying. He flew for almost 30m before he crashed to the ground!

“Laughable!” The ridiculing expression on Hun You’s face was extremely obvious.

Mo Ke shook his head and withdrew his gaze.

A wisp of disappointment flashed through Luo Xue’s eyes, and then he withdrew his gaze.

Yang Ye stood up slowly and gazed at his right hand. A scarlet red crack had split open on his palm.

Yang Ye clenched his fist tightly while his gaze descended onto the blue light battier. This time, there was unprecedented seriousness in his eyes! Even with his physical body, he had actually suffered an injury from the energy that was rebounded by it!

Of course, most importantly, the Nether Ghostflame was actually useless against it!

What exactly is that blue light barrier? Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Don’t try to use force against it. Because even if you attain the Spirit Realm and utilize your full strength, you still wouldn’t be able to break it open!” Right when Yang Ye was feeling bewildered, the Sword Spirit’s had voice resounded once more in his mind.

“Why?” asked Yang Ye.

Because it contained the energy of the Laws. Unless your strength is formidable to the point of disregarding the Laws of the person who created this light barrier, then you can break through it! Of course, if you’re able to fully display the might of the Nether Ghostflame right now, then you would be able to accomplish it as well. However, you seem to be incapable of accomplishing that right now!”

“Then why did you ask me to come here!?” Yang Ye was slightly displeased. Indeed, he could sense that it was utterly impossible for him to break through the blue light barrier with his current strength!

After a moment of silence, the Sword Spirit’s voice suddenly resounded in Yang Ye’s mind again. “You have that mysterious vortex! Perhaps it can allow you to go in there!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. Indeed, even Yang Ye believed that if the mysterious vortex was willing, then it would definitely be able to break open the light barrier! However, it didn’t obey him at all!

But Yang Ye refused to give up and wanted to give it a try!

Yang Ye walked over to the blue light barrier again, and then the others in the surroundings had opened their eyes to look at him once more. However, they quickly closed their eyes while Luo Xue hadn’t even opened his eyes in the first place.

As far as they were concerned, Yang Ye was overestimating his strength because they were very clearly aware of the blue light barrier’s ability! It was set up by the 1st Martial God, and the objective behind its creation was to stop others besides the future Martial Gods to enter the 5th level! As for why the 1st Martial God had done this, they weren’t very sure of the answer. They only knew that every single Martial God who’d walked out from the 5th level had obtained an enormous improvement in their strengths!

Simply speaking, the 5th level represented a place of inheritance for the Martial Gods, and it was undoubtedly impossible for others to enter it!

Something worthy of mentioning was that the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor hadn’t been able to enter the 5th level as well.... However, it didn’t represent anything. After all, even the Martial God of that era had been defeated by the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor upon emerging from the 5th level!

So, in the end, the rumor in the world was that the Sword Sect’s Founding Emperor disdained to enter it all those years ago. However, no one knew if he really disdained to enter it or couldn’t!

In short, besides the Martial Gods, no one had been able to enter the 5th level! Yet now, Yang Ye actually intended to ascend to the 5th level. So, wasn’t it an impossible dream?

Yang Ye didn’t care what they thought. He gazed at the blue light barrier before he slowly closed his eyes and immersed his consciousness into his body. He said, “You can enter it, right?”

The tiny vortex remained silent and didn’t react at all.

Yang Ye naturally wouldn’t give up just like that, and he said, “You must be aware that my strength would improve greatly if I enter the 5th level. Once my strength improves, you’ll naturally be able to obtain a huge amount of benefits. So, it’s a win-win situation if we go in there! What do you think?”

The tiny vortex still remained silent!

“Look, I’m very weak right now, so I have to improve my strength as soon as possible. Otherwise, I might die at any time. It’s definitely not beneficial to you if I were to die, and it might even be harmful to you. You definitely don’t wish for such a situation to occur, right? So, you just have to help me slightly and we would be able to enter the 5th level. Once we do, I’ll definitely be able to improve my strength swiftly, and then....”

Yang Ye spoke incessantly for almost 15 minutes. However, the tiny vortex didn’t react at all, and it was like it hadn’t heard Yang Ye at all. This caused Yang Ye to be filled with hatred!

After another 15 minutes passed, Yang Ye took a deep breath and said to the tiny vortex, “Haha. It looks to me like you’re completely helpless against this stupid light barrier, right!? Of course, this light barrier is so formidable while you’re so weak right now, so it’s normal for you to be helpless against it! Don’t worry, I won’t look down upon you. I really understand you... really.... Trust me....”

The tiny vortex still remained silent. A wisp of disappointment flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes when he witnessed this.

Right when he was about to give up for good, the tiny vortex suddenly started revolving, and then a strand of enormous force suddenly surged out from within it. In an instant, a wave of dizziness assaulted Yang Ye’s mind, and he heard a clear and melodious cold snort in his daze. However, he wasn’t sure of it because he’d immediately fallen unconscious....

At the same time, a ray of dark violet light instantly shot out from within Yang Ye’s body, and it blasted the blue light barrier.

Bang!

A light bang resounded before a gap instantly split apart on the blue light barrier, and then Yang Ye was carried by a strand of violet energy and directly taken through the light barrier....

After Yang Ye entered through it, the light barrier trembled slightly before it recovered to its previous state....

At this moment, everyone on the 4th level was flabbergasted!
