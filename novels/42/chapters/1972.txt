Chapter 1973 – Burial Sword!

Training with the sword!

Slash, stab, chop, flick…

He was just training with these basic moves.

His sword had once been complicated, and then simplified. Now, he was making it complicated again and simplifying it once more!

It was still being simplified, but its level was completely different!

Because while it was complicated in the past, he hadn’t learned that much, so it was very easy to simplify. Yet now, he’d learned so much, and it couldn’t be compared to the past. Thus, simplifying it now was at least 10 times greater than it had been in the past!

Besides that, he was fusing them together too!

The Sword Dao and the Weapon Dao!

Time trickled by. A month had passed in the outside world.

A’Man and Ling stood on guard outside the cave throughout the month.

Ling asked, “Is that fellow alright?”

A’Man glanced into the cave and shook her head, “He should be. He had a fortuitous encounter, and he should be digesting all of it now.”

Ling suddenly asked, “Why didn’t you ask him why all the other races were trying to kill him?”

A’Man spoke indifferently, “It doesn’t change anything, right?”

Ling thought for a moment and nodded, “True!”

A’Man wanted to say more, but she suddenly frowned slightly. A short while later, she said, “Sky Residence City is in trouble.”

Ling was about to say something, but A’Man added, “You stay here. I’ll head back.”

Ling hurriedly said, “I’ll go with you!”

A’Man shook her head slightly, “He needs someone to help protect him. Don’t worry, I can deal with it!”

A’Man vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

Ling brows were pressed together tightly as he sat there.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye arrived before a waterfall, and a tall mountain stood before him. Countless torrents of water were crashing down from it and entering the pool before his feet, causing water to spray towards the surroundings! It was quite a magnificent sight!

Yang Ye stood before the waterfall, and his heart was calm as water!

A long time later, he suddenly opened his palm slowly, and a sword appeared in his grasp. The tip of the sword was facing downwards, and it was spinning swiftly while pointed at his palm.

Suddenly, the sword stopped.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

In an instant, cracks appeared on the mountain, and they seemed like a spiderweb. After that, a gust of wind blew bi, and the mountain instantly transformed into powder that dispersed into the air.

The entire mountain had vanished like it never existed!

Once the mountain vanished, the space where it had been was covered in cracks.

A spiderweb that was over 300m long appeared before Yang Ye.

While he seemed to have only launched a single attack in that instant, Yang Ye had actually attacked at least a thousand times!

A thousand swings in a breath of time! That wasn’t difficult for him at all!

Of course, it didn’t possess such power merely because he’d launched a thousand attacks. There was one other reason, and it was because they carried the essence of 10,000 sword techniques. Moreover, he’d included the killing techniques of Man Slaughter!

Fusion of the Weapon Dao and Sword Dao!

That attack was much stronger than the Invincible Sword Domain he’d created in the past!

However, Yang Ye didn’t enhance his attack with the Sword Domain!

The reason he hadn’t was because he didn’t dare to.

Using the Sword Domain would exhaust a huge amount of his strength. But while that previous attack was powerful, it exhausted a huge amount of strength as well.

So, if he combined them both, they would be extremely strong, but the consumption would be enormous too. The slightest mistake may cause him to cripple himself before he could even launch the attack!

His realm of cultivation!

At this moment, Yang Ye knew that he had to improve his cultivation. His cultivation was his foundation, and the 2nd stage of the Enlightened Realm was far insufficient right now.

Yang Ye took a deep breath on the spot and raised his palm. A sword appeared on his palm once more. Yang Ye grinned as he gazed at the sword which was spinning rapidly above his palm, “Since it’s a fusion of 10,000 sword techniques and the Six Slaughters, I’ll call it Burial! Who can’t I bury while I have my sword in my hand?”

Yang Ye put the sword away. He didn’t leave the Primordial Pagoda because he had something else to do!

It didn’t take long for him to arrive in the clouds, and he stood there with his sword in hand.

Suddenly, the clouds stopped floating, and then they slowly moved away.

The aura of the sword and slaughter!

The pressure from these two auras made the clouds avoid him or disperse. At the same time, the space around him gradually started shaking like an earthquake was running through it!

Suddenly, numerous afterimages appeared here.

They were Yang Ye’s afterimages.

These afterimages surrounded Yang Ye and appeared successively. It didn’t take long for Yang Ye’s afterimages to cover a huge area around him.

Yang Ye was still standing on the spot without moving an inch!

Hou Qing’s face gradually became solemn as he watched this. At this moment, even he couldn’t determine which one was Yang Ye’s real body.

Yang Ye seemed like he hadn’t moved at all, but Hou Qing knew that the Yang Ye who stood on the spot was actually just an afterimage.

Suddenly, Snowy raised her claw and pointed at one of the afterimages in the sky. She was asking what Yang Ye was doing.

Hou Qing looked up, and the afterimages there were gradually vanishing. The spot Snowy was pointing at was where Yang Ye was standing.

Hou Qing turned and gazed at Snowy with astonishment, “You knew that was his real body?”

Snowy blinked and acted as if she didn’t understand what he was saying.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye appeared in front of Snowy. He rubbed her little head and asked, “How did you know that was me? Right, what I’m asking is that there were so many of me, so how did you know which one was me?”

Snowy blinked, and it took her some time to figure out what Yang Ye was asking her. She immediately pointed at Yang Ye and smiled.

Yang Ye grinned. Snowy’s answer was that she just knew!

Meanwhile, Hou Qing suddenly said, “I understand now. This little fellow is a Sprite Lord and coupled with the fact that she obtained the aura of a Sage. If I’m not wrong, all illusions are useless against her. Her eyes can see the truest of everything!”

Yang Ye turned to gaze at Snowy’s chubby face and smiled, “Looks like my Snowy is really amazing!”

Snowy cracked a smile and rubbed her head against Yang Ye’s cheek!

Meanwhile, Hou Qing suddenly asked, “What was that?”

Yang Ye replied, “A thought I had. I’ve been training every day without end, and I ceaselessly modified my techniques throughout that time. Today, I finally figured out the last problem and succeeded.”

Hou Qing asked, “A movement technique?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “A killing technique. I call it Shadow Sword. When I kill, they’ll only see my shadow and not me.” He smiled with confidence and continued, “If I’m to be frank, if I fight an ordinary Dao Realm expert now, I can kill an expert like that before he has a chance to react!”

Hou Qing laughed bitterly, “The speed you grow at is really too quick!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath, “It’s all thanks to the old man in Daoist’s robes and the middle aged man from the Weapon Path!”

The reason he’d improved so much was because he’d obtained those 10,000 sword techniques and the Six Slaughters. If he didn’t get those, then he wouldn’t have been able to possess such strength even if he cultivated bitterly for 10 more years.

Natural talent and hard work were important, but fortune was similarly important!

Yang Ye had all of them!

Hou Qing nodded slightly, “Actually, so long as you reveal your identity upon returning to the outside world, I’m sure all the races will probably stop chasing after you. The Dao Path or the Weapon Path are more than enough to make them give up!”

Yang Ye smiled, “But it may make me die even quicker, right?”

Hou Qing nodded, “Indeed!”

He was from the Dao Path and possessed the number one treasure of the Dao Path. Perhaps he would be safe with the old man in Daoist’s robes there to protect him, but if the old man didn’t pay attention to him for just a moment, he may die in that time.

Hidden schemes may not be that terrifying, but what about those schemes that openly led him into a trap?

As for the Weapon Path, it was worse. The line he’d inherited had been annihilated by someone. Moreover, it had been internally annihilated. So, if he exposed his identity, he would die before he even knew what hit him!

Yang Ye was very well aware that there was only one situation where the members of the Dao Path wouldn’t dare to look for trouble with him, and the members of the Weapon Path wouldn’t dare to do so as well. Moreover, they would do their best to draw him over to their side!

That situation was one where he possessed formidable strength!

When he was able to bring greater value to them, they wouldn’t even allow him to die!

But he was far from that right now!

Presently, he couldn’t entrust his life to the Dao Path or Weapon Path.

He had to rely on himself!

Hou Qing nodded slightly, “It’s good that you think that way! It’s best to rely on yourself. So, what do you plan to do next?”

What I plan to do? Yang Ye chuckled, “I’ll first go collect the 12 swords in the Weapon Cemetery, and then I’ll find a way to leave this place and go to the Sky Dimension!”

“The Sky Dimension?” Hou Qing spoke solemnly, “Even though you’ve grown extremely strong now, you’re still unable to fight against the sky race.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment before he replied, “I’m going to ask for Zi’er, not to kill.”

Hou Qing asked, “What if they refuse?”

A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “I’ll kill until they do!”

Yang Ye chatted with Hou Qing for a while before he left the Primordial Pagoda. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Outside the cave, Yang Ye took a deep breath when Ling suddenly appeared before him, “You’ve finally come out.”

Yang Ye asked, “What’s wrong? Where’s Big Sis?”

Ling replied solemnly, “The Dire Wolves and Devil Cave have joined forces. Sky Residence City and her are in trouble!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly when he heard this, and then he looked up into the sky, “I haven’t killed in so long! I miss it a little!”
