Chapter 2778 – We’ll Go First!

Based on what could be seen on the surface, Yang Ye’s side had the absolute advantage.

After all, they had around 30 Destiny Realm experts and both Yang Ye and An Nanjing. Such a force may not be the strongest in this world, but it wasn’t very weak.

However, the shadow had no intention to retreat.

Meanwhile, the four Pantheras appeared above them again.

While the formation had pushed them back, it hadn’t been able to kill them.

One of the Pantheras seems to have received some kind of order, and it dived down toward Yang Ye’s group.

A ray of sword energy shot up into the air.

Jian Wudi!

Besides Yang Ye and An Nanjing, he was undoubtedly the strongest in Universe City.

Meanwhile, the others went with him.

The shadow, on the other hand, was left to Yang Ye and An Nanjing.

An Nanjing was about to attack when Yang Ye suddenly stopped her. She looked at him, and he said, “Go help them!”

She frowned slightly and felt bewildered.

The shadow’s strength wasn’t something Yang Ye could go against on his own.

Yang Ye said, “If you help them, the battle can be ended as quickly as possible.”

An Nanjing pondered deeply for a moment and vanished into the distance.

In the end, she chose to trust Yang Ye!

Just as Yang Ye had said, if the shadow were to keep Yang Ye and her busy here, this battle wouldn’t end for some time. But if she went to help them, Jian Wudi and the others would be able to crush the four Pantheras and those Demon Guards as soon as possible.

Of course, it all depended on whether Yang Ye could keep the shadow busy!

The shadow said, “Are you going to use your ultimate moves now?”

Yang Ye didn’t say a word. His sword intent and aura suddenly rose explosively, and even his slaughter intent appeared around him.

The Demonic Sword Dao!

The shadow nodded slightly, “That’s quite interesting indeed.”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Swish!

Space rippled, and an afterimage shot at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye slowly grabbed the Sword Precursor in his right hand, and then he swung it. However, such a shocking attack was stopped by two hands.

Suddenly, a ray of dazzling sword energy erupted from the Sword Gourd on Yang Ye’s waist, and then a black sword shot forward.

The shadow twisted its body sideways to dodge the flying sword while simultaneously slamming Yang Ye’s sword forward.

Bang!

Yang Ye was pushed backward repeatedly!

The shadow was about to attack again, but a flying sword shot at it from behind!

It was Burial!

The shadow stopped, turned around, and slammed a punch at it.

Bam!

Burial was blasted away!

At the instant the shadow had turned around, a sword slashed down from above him.

The shadow didn’t try to dodge and just allowed the sword to descend.

Hiss!

Yang Ye’s sword slashed the shadow into bits. However, Yang Ye was alarmed instead and swiftly swept his sword to the side.

Bang!

Yang Ye felt a wave of powerful force sweep through his entire body.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted extremely far away, and as soon as he stopped himself, afterimages soundlessly appeared before him.

Yang Ye closed his eyes. The shadow was too fast! Too much faster than him! So, it was impossible for him to see with his eyes!

He had to use his heart!

Suddenly, a sword shot out from Yang Ye’s waist and slashed at the afterimage before Yang Ye, but just a moment later, Burial stopped as two fingers had clamped down on it!

Burial couldn’t move an inch forward before those fingers!

However, Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot.

A blood red ray of sword energy shot down from above.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The fingers released Burial, and then a pinch slammed against the blood red sword energy.

Bang!

The blood red sword energy exploded into bits, but just a moment later, another ray of blood red sword energy descended!

The Explosive Madness Sword Technique!

At this moment, Yang Ye’s aura and strength arrived at his peak.

Rumble!

The afterimage was pushed back repeatedly. In just an instant, he’d been pushed over 1km away. However, Yang Ye’s attacks were growing stronger with every swing.

It was the first time Yang Ye had turned the tides and started to suppress the shadow instead!

Meanwhile, the four Pantheras and the Demon Guards were completely suppressed once An Nanjing joined the battle. One of the Pantheras was covered in injuries and was on the verge of death!

The shadow had clearly realized this!

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s sword missed its target as the shadow before him was gone. At the same time, three shadows appeared around him!

Three!

These three shadows suddenly vanished simultaneously.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly as he swept his sword forward.

Hiss!

A blood red wave of sword energy rippled out, but in just a moment, the blood red sword energy shattered.

A moment later, a palm had pressed down on Yang Ye’s chest.

Bang!

Yang Ye was instantly blasted 30km away. As soon as he stopped himself, an afterimage slammed down at it from above. Yang Ye hurriedly raised his sword and slashed at it.

Meanwhile, a hand grabbed his sword. At the same time, Yang Ye decisively released his sword and slammed his arms upward.

Bang!

The afterimage was blasted 300m away!

Heavenshield was on Yang Ye’s arms!

At this moment, countless strands of blood surged into Heavenshield, and its strength rose crazily!

Yang Ye stretched out his hand and the Sword Precursor appeared in his grasp once more.

This time, he was using Heavenshield and the Sword Precursor!

The shadow said, “You have quite a few trump cards, and I…”

Suddenly, a shrill cry resounded from afar. The shadow looked over, and he saw a Panthera was falling from the sky. There was a woman standing on its head!

An Nanjing!

An Nanjing glanced coldly at the shadow, and then she charged at another Panthera.

Besides that, around five of the Demon Guards had fallen in battle!

It could be said that the shadow’s side had completely lost!

The shadow fell silent for a moment, and then he looked up at Yang Ye. A moment later, his body suddenly started trembling violently.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He knew that this may be the shadow’s final attack. If he could resist it, his side would win; and if he failed, the situation would be instantly turned around!

A pitch black pike suddenly appeared in the shadow’s grasp, and then it shot at Yang Ye.

The pike was spinning, and space exploded apart inch by inch in its wake!

Yang Ye didn’t try to defend himself, and he just swung his sword at the pike instead.

A moment later, the Sword Precursor struck the pick, and they instantly cracked open. At the same time, a flying sword shot forward from Yang Ye’s waist.

Bam!

The pike was instantly blasted into bits!

Yang Ye sheathed the Sword Precursor and grabbed Burial before swinging it forward.

Bang!

The shadow didn’t go head-on against this attack and just retreated instead. He retreated over 10km back and created a huge amount of distance between them.

Because the Pantheras and Demon Guards were being pushed back.

If this battle continued, all of them would die!

The shadow vanished on the spot. An Nanjing and the others immediately retreated upon noticing that.

Both sides created space between each other and stood in confrontation from afar.

Yang Ye glanced at the shadow, “Fuck off!”

The shadow shook his head slightly, “How could that happen?”

The space around them suddenly shook violently, and then numerous powerful auras rippled out from there.

The expressions of everyone here became solemn upon noticing this.

Yang Ye suddenly ordered, “Retreat to the city.”

They nodded and retreated while Yang Ye and An Nanjing guarded the rear.

A short while later, Jian Wudi and the others had returned to the city.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing were retreating too. For some reason, the shadow didn’t stop them.

A long time passed before the space around him cracked open, and then numerous huge demon beasts emerged!

There were Pantheras among them, but there were other demon beasts of unknown name as well. Besides that, there were more experts with pikes.

A moment later, these colossi covered the sky above Universe City.

A wave of invisible pressure enveloped the entire city!

Countless looked up at them from within the city.

Is this the final battle?

Meanwhile, a shadow suddenly appeared in the air above the city. The shadow looked down below and said, “Our target is Yang Ye. Hand him over and we’ll leave. I’ll give you two hours to consider my proposal. After that, we’ll crush Universe City if you don’t hand over Yang Ye!”

In the city.

Yang Ye glanced coldly at the sky and led the others back into the hall.

The atmosphere in the hall was very heavy.

Yang Ye glanced at the others, “What do all of you think?”

Ding Shaoyao remained silent.

It wasn’t the right time for her to speak.

Meanwhile, Liu Yuan suddenly said, “We’ll fight them of course. I’m sure no one would believe his nonsense, right?”

Huang Ying nodded, “Handing over Brother Yang would be no different than digging our own graves. Because we would be ripe for the slaughter once that happens, and they can do with us as they please!”

The others nodded.

The shadow was clearly trying to divide them. If they really believed him, they would die before they even knew it.

Meanwhile, an old man gazed at Yang Ye, “City Governor, just tell us what we should do! This time, one side has to die!”

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “Senior Chen!”

Chen Dao’zi stepped forward.

Yang Ye gazed at him, “Is the formation ready?”

Chen Dao’zi nodded, “Everything is ready!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Let’s go then. We’ll make the first move.”

All of them were stunned speechless.
