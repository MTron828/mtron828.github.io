Someone who reincarnates frequently!

Yang Ye frowned when he heard her, “What do you mean?”

Little Sky shook her head slightly, “You’ll find out in a while.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Little Sky sped up.

Yang Ye glanced at her and hurried after her.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive at an unknown grassland.

The grassland was simply boundless.

Around two hours later, a huge group of mountain goats appeared within Yang Ye’s field of vision. There were at least tens of thousands of them! Yang Ye saw a young boy around the age of six or seven at the back of the group. The young boy was riding a mountain goat, and he held a flute in his grasp.

The tune of a flute drifted through a mountain of mountain goats beneath the blue sky and white clouds.

Meanwhile, Little Sky suddenly waved at the young boy, “Hey! Little Wheel!”

Little Wheel! The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. What kind of name is that?

The young boy looked up at Little Sky when he heard her. A wisp of embarrassment flashed through his eyes, and then he became visibly delighted. After that, he rode the goat over to Little Sky and smiled, “Little Sky, long time no see!”

Baa! Baa!

The goat moved over to Little Sky and gently rubbed its horns against Little Sky’s legs. It seemed to be very close to Little Sky.

Little Sky stretched out her hand and shook the goat’s horn, and then she looked up at the boy and spoke softly, “I knew you would be with her.”

The boy grinned, “This is our final lifetime.”

Little Sky felt puzzled, “What do you mean?”

The boy looked down at the goat while a gentle expression flashed through his eyes, “All those years ago, I promised her that I would be with her for ten lifetimes. Now, it’s the final lifetime.”

Yang Ye frowned slightly and couldn’t really figure out what was going on.

Little Sky fell silent for a while before she spoke, “What will you do after that?”

“After that?” The boy grinned, “Do you know what she’ll be in her next lifetime?”

Little Sky gazed at the goat and remained silent for a long time, and then she said, “A rock.”

The boy nodded, “I’ll be a rock with her in our next lifetime. This time, we won’t wake up again.”

Little Sky fell silent.

Yang Ye, on the other hand, had a bewildered expression on his face.

Meanwhile, the boy suddenly gazed at Yang Ye. He sized up Yang Ye, and then a wisp of surprise flashed through his eyes, “I never expected another extraordinary genius in the Sword Dao to appear after the Unfettered One.”

Yang Ye gazed at the boy, “Senior, you know the Unfettered One?”

The boy grinned, “We’ve fought a few times.”

Yang Ye was visibly shocked. He has fought the Unfettered One a few times!Would someone the Unfettered One sought out for a battle be ordinary? It made Yang Ye wonder who the boy was!

Meanwhile, the boy gazed at Little Sky, “Little Sky, since you’ve come to see me, something has definitely happened, right?”

Little Sky nodded, “There’s a power that’s coming to bully me.”

The boy asked, “The Nether Pavilion?”

Little Sky nodded.

The boy nodded slightly, “I understand. I’ll be there when the time comes.”

Little Sky smiled, “Thank you!”

The boy shook his head slightly, “I should be thanking you. I’ve always desired to repay you for sparing my life and helping me. Unfortunately, I’ve never had a chance. Now, being able to help you at the end of my life is a blessing from the heavens. I’m sure you understand. It’s an end to karma.”

Little Sky rubbed the horn of that goat and said, “The world can’t be without rules and order, but it can’t do without love even more. The laws can never surpass the emotions of people. Moreover, I just did a little for all of you.”

The boy grinned, “This world is lucky to have you.”

Little Sky chuckled, “I won’t disturb both of you any longer. I have to go to one more place. See you!”

“Alright!” The boy nodded, “I’ll be there.”

Little Sky nodded and left with Yang Ye.

The boy stared at Yang Ye’s disappearing figure for a long time before he spoke softly, “Disaster? Fortune?”

A long time passed before he shook his head, and then he left on the goat.

Yang Ye asked while they traveled, “Who is he?”

Little Sky spoke softly, “Someone who frequently reincarnates, and a very powerful person.”

“Frequently reincarnates?” Yang Ye continued, “Why does he do that? Is it to charge into the realm of cultivation above the Rebirth Realm?”

Little Sky shook her head, “He surpassed Rebirth Realm experts a long time ago.”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “You’re saying that he’s an expert above the Rebirth Realm?”

Little Sky replied, “Not really. How should I explain it? He’s still at the Rebirth Realm, but if he wills it, he can surpass the Rebirth Realm at any time. Or I should say that he could surpass it a very, very long time ago.”

Yang Ye asked, “Then why does he frequently reincarnate himself?”

Little Sky explained, “Reincarnation or rebirth represents two things. Firstly, charging into the Rebirth Realm by entering the cycle of rebirth with one’s consciousness. Secondly, it’s reincarnating to one’s next lifetime. Once people die in this world, they have a next life. Of course, the precondition is that their soul isn’t obliterated by someone.”

She turned to look at Yang Ye before she continued, “Do you know why he’s constantly reincarnating?”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Little Sky answered, “Did you see that goat? That’s his wife.”

Yang Ye was stunned, and he spoke with astonishment, “Are you joking?”

Little Sky shook her head, “A very, very long time ago. He had someone he loved, his wife. However, his wife’s natural talent couldn’t compare to his, so she was never able to advance from the Dualism Realm and attain the Rebirth Realm. In the end, her lifespan was exhausted, and she entered the cycle of reincarnation. When his wife entered the cycle of reincarnation, he decided to discard his cultivation and enter it with her.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time before he asked, “That’s possible?”

Little Sky shook her head, “Even though his natural talent was outstanding, he couldn’t accomplish that. Because he didn’t know where his wife would appear or what form she would take upon completing her reincarnation. So, someone helped him in the end. That person seems to be me.”

Yang Ye felt speechless. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Little Sky continued, “He’s strong, so he was able to maintain his memories upon reincarnating. However, his wife can’t. However, as far as he is concerned, it doesn’t matter as long as he can stay by her side.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time before he spoke again, “He said his next life....”

Little Sky nodded, “Both of them will be rocks in their next life.”

“Rocks?” Yang Ye frowned, “Not people?”

Little Sky glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Who told you that people will definitely be reincarnated as people? If everyone becomes people, then who would be the demons, plants, and everything else?”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Meanwhile, Little Sky added, “In any case, we won’t be able to see them anymore very soon. Because rocks have no life, and he’ll reincarnate himself into a rock as well!”

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time before he spoke again, “How strong is he?”

Little Sky shook her head, “I’m not very sure myself. All I do know is that he possesses the memories of nine lifetimes, so it’s equivalent to nine lifetimes of cultivating. So, he probably won’t be very weak. In any case, he’s definitely stronger than you!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Little Sky looked up towards the distance, “We have one last place to go.”

Yang Ye said, “Didn’t you say he was the last person?”

Little Sky nodded, “We’re not going to see a person now.”

Yang Ye asked, “Not a person? Then what?”

She replied, “The spirit of the earth!”

“The spirit of the earth?” Yang Ye asked, “What’s that?”

Little Sky rolled her eyes at him, “Such ignorance! You know nothing!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened.

Little Sky explained, “The spirit of the earth is the spirit of the ground of Sky Sky Continent. It can be considered to be a type of Sprite King.”

Yang Ye asked, “Is it very strong?”

Little Sky glanced at him, “It’s stronger than you!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened, “Can you stop using me as the point of comparison? Don’t you feel bad for constantly belittling me?”

Little Sky chuckled, “Fine, let’s hurry up.”

She immediately sped up once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then he shook his head and laughed bitterly. In the past, he felt that besides those fellows from the Nether Pavilion, there was probably no one else on Merak System who could defeat him. But reality told him that there were many on Sky Sky Continent who were stronger than him.

Extraordinary experts were hidden here!

Actually, it was very normal. After all, not all experts like to be in the limelight. Some were very strong yet kept a very low profile. Just like that young boy on the goat, and that girl, Qin.

If it wasn’t for Little Sky, he wouldn’t have imagined that so many mysterious experts existed on Sky Sky Continent!

So, one could never be self-satisfied!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive deep beneath the ground with Little Sky.

This time, Yang Ye didn’t encounter any lava. Moreover, he sensed a faint strand of energy.

The energy of earth!

Around six hours later, Little Sky stopped moving.

Yang Ye gazed at her with a puzzled expression on his face, “What is it?”

Little Sky replied, “We’re here!”

“We’re here?” Yang Ye was stunned. He glanced at the surroundings but saw nothing.

Meanwhile, Little Sky suddenly said, “Little Mud, someone wants to bully me. What do you think we should do?”

As soon as Little Sky finished speaking, numerous strands of earthen yellow energy suddenly emerged from the surroundings, and the energy swept towards Yang Ye like a storm.

In an instant, Yang Ye felt like his body was about to be torn apart.
