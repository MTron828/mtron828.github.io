Chapter 1110 – Quasi Emperors? What’s So Great About That?

Yang Ye turned around and saw a black shadow approaching from afar, and it didn’t take long for a man in an ink black robe to arrive here.

There was a tiny embroidered ‘莫’ character on his chest.

Xiao Yuxi walked over to Yang Ye’s side and spoke softly, “Mo Yuntian!”

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and then 10 Saint Realm Sword Servants appeared here. They surrounded Xiao Yuxi and Qian Wenlan’s heavily injured figure.

Yang Ye gazed at Xiao Yuxi and said, “Keep her under you control. Kill her if it’s necessary.”

Xiao Yuxi nodded lightly, and then she withdrew a saber and pressed it against Qian Wenlan’s throat. The blade sunk a little into Qian Wenlan’s flesh, causing blood to instantly seep out.

At this moment, no one doubted if Xiao Yuxi would kill Qian Wenlan.

Yang Ye glanced at his body. At this moment, it was almost 70% healed under the effects of his violet profound energy. In other words, he’d recovered quite a bit of his combat strength.

Mo Yuntian sized up Yang Ye and said, “It’s the 1st time. The 1st time that someone has dared to try and take a woman who belongs to me, Mo Yuntian. Needless to say, you’re really brave. But I wonder....”

Mo Yuntian’s voice stopped abruptly at this point. Because Yang Ye had suddenly appeared in front of him, and then a sword was swung down towards him!

Mo Yuntian hadn’t expected Yang Ye to suddenly attack him, and a fierce expression instantly appeared on his face. He flipped his palm, and a sword appeared in his grasp before flicking it at Yang Ye’s sword.

Clang!

A clear and resounding sound of metal colliding swept through the surroundings, and then Mo Yuntian was blasted backwards by the powerful strength within Yang Ye’s attack. Moreover, Yang Ye instantly pushed forward and arrived before Mo Yuntian, and then he stabbed his sword forward!

Mo Yuntian’s expression changed. A person’s skill was obvious when he attacked. Mo Yuntian didn’t dare act carelessly at all, and his profound energy surged into his sword before he swiftly stabbed it forward as well!

Clang!

The sound of Mo Yuntian’s sword shattering resounded, and it made Mo Yuntian’s expression changed drastically. Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword stabbed against his chest.

Bang!

A muffled bang resounded as Mo Yuntian was pushed almost 3km back, and a golden chainmail armor could be seen beneath his clothes.

Mo Yuntian hadn’t even recovered from his shock when Yang Ye appeared in front of him again. After that, a ray of cold light flashed as a sword swept towards his throat. Mo Yuntian’s pupils constricted because he had no chainmail on his throat. So how could he dare to let Yang Ye’s sword strike him? His body immediately bent backwards like his back had been broken, and he avoided Yang Ye’s lethal strike.

However, it seemed like Yang Ye knew he would react in that way. As soon as his attack missed, he’d swiftly kicked Mo Yuntian’s heel.

Crack!

The sound of bones breaking resounded, and then Mo Yuntian was blasted flying. But it only took a moment for Yang Ye to instantly appear in front of Mo Yuntian, and then he held his sword in both hands as he stabbed it forward again.

This attack was extremely quick, and Yang Ye’s body had transformed into a speck of light.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was pushed over 1km back.

Meanwhile, Feng Qingyu had suddenly appeared before Mo Yuntian.

Yang Ye waved his intent sword about, and cuts instantly appeared for a moment in the space around him. Feng Qingyu was about to speak when Yang Ye gazed at Xiao Yuxi, “Cut off her other arm!”

Xiao Yu xi didn’t hesitate to raise her saber, and then Qian Wenlan’s other arm was instantly severed from her body, causing blood to spray out like a fountain. However, Qian Wenlan’s expression remained unchanged!

Feng Qingyu’s face instantly became gloomy when she witnessed this scene, “I’ll kill you even if Xiao Bieli comes!”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “Activate the teleportation formation and let Yuxi leave.”

“Don’t you dare!” Meanwhile, Mo Yuntian suddenly stepped forward from behind Feng Qingyu. He withdrew a talisman and crushed it before he gazed at Yang Ye, and he spoke ferociously, “No matter who you are, you....”

“Just shut up!” Yang Ye interrupted Mo Yuntian and said, “If I were you, I would either die in battle or just shut my mouth after I lost. Men should either fight or keep their mouths shut. Don’t be a bitch and start nagging. Besides that, don’t try to use your background after you’ve lost. That only makes you seem even more useless. If you have the ability, let’s fight right now. Do you dare?”

Mo Yuntian’s expression was unsightly to the extreme. Meanwhile, Feng Qingyu spoke abruptly, “Yang Ye, you’re really quite capable and brave. However, do you realize what you’re doing? Not to mention the current White Deer Academy, even the White Deer Academy before it split apart wouldn’t be able to save you if you offend my Thousand Crane Sect and the Mo Clan. It isn’t just you who’ll suffer, all the thousands upon thousands of students in White Deer Academy will be dragged down with you. Understand?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “I understand all of that well. However, what do you think I should do? Your Thousand Crane Sect intends to fully seal my wife’s memories and give her to someone else, and then gain benefits for your Thousand Crane Sect in return? What do you want me to do? Consider the overall situation, disregard her, and fulfil your Thousand Crane Sect’s wishes?”

Yang Ye revealed a ferocious expression at this point, “I don’t know what’ll happen in the future, and I don’t care. All I know is that I’ll kill anyone who dares to touch her.”

Xiao Yuxi stared at Yang Ye, and her hand was trembling as she held tightly onto her saber.

“Is that so? My Mo Clan would like to try!” Suddenly, a grey robed old man appeared out of thin air.

He was a Quasi Emperor!

Feng Qingyu glanced at the old man and said, “Mo Ji!”

The old man called Mo Ji nodded slightly to Feng Qingyu, and then he gazed at Mo Yuntian. The latter hurriedly stepped forward and bowed to the old man. He was about to speak when Mo Ji suddenly slapped Mo Yuntian, and a mouthful of blood sprayed from the latter while his figure was slapped flying.

But just a moment passed before Mo Yuntian suddenly flew back and arrived before Mo Ji again.

Mo Yuntian was stunned, “Second Uncle....”

Mo Ji glanced coldly at Mo Yuntian and said, “Do you know what it’s like to be shameful? Do you know what it’s like to be useless? Do you know what it’s like to be embarrassing? You’re shameful, useless, and embarrassing. You’re the 1st disciple of my Mo Clan who has utilized a transmission talisman to seek help, and your opponent is just a Half-Saint. If news of this spreads, then wouldn’t the other 3 clans laugh at my Mo Clan? Besides that, if it was your cousin brother who was in your place, then he wouldn’t seek help. He would fight his opponent to the death. He wouldn’t seek help even if he died in battle. The members of the Mo Clan can lose and die, but they can’t lose face!”

Mo Yuntian’s figure was trembling slightly, and he hurriedly knelt down in midair, “I realize my mistakes!”

Mo Ji grunted coldly, and then he gazed at Feng Qingyu, “Sect Master Feng, both of them must die. Especially that woman. If she doesn’t die, then news of your Thousand Crane Sect forcing the wife of another to marry someone else, and news of my Mo Clan trying to forcefully seize the wife of another would definitely spread. My Mo Clan would be completely embarrassed, and your Thousand Crane Sect’s reputation would probably suffer a huge decline!”

Feng Qingyu’s face fell. How could she not understand what he meant? He wanted her to abandon Qian Wenlan. That was a Quasi Emperor! Qian Wenlan was a Quasi Emperor! How could she be willing to abandon a Quasi Emperor?

Moreover, she’d brought up Qian Wenlan, and she’d fostered Qian Wenlan as the future sect master who would take over once she left.

She wasn’t willing to abandon Qian Wenlan just like that!

As if he knew what she was thinking, Mo Ji added, “Sect Master Feng, it is quite difficult for you to give up on Vice Sect Master Qian. But have you thought about what your Thousand Crane Sect would face if he’s allowed to take Vice Sect Master Qian with him? A dignified Diamond Rank power actually allowed a Half-Saint to sneak in and kill, and then even their Vice Sect Master was captured. Your Thousand Crane Sect would become the laughingstock of the Central Divine Prefecture!”

Feng Qingyu’s eyes narrowed slightly, and she slowly clenched her fists.

Just as Mo Ji had said, if Yang Ye was really allowed to take Qian Wenlan with him, then the Thousand Crane Sect’s reputation would definitely be destroyed. After all, a dignified Diamond Rank power had been attacked by a Half-Saint, and their vice sect master, a Quasi Emperor, was even captured!

Killing intent gradually appeared in Feng Qingyu’s eyes as she thought about how others would think about her sect.

Mo Ji spoke immediately when he noticed the change in her expression, “Sect Master Feng, this was caused by a member of my Mo Clan. So how about we do this? Once we kill those 2, that spirit vein Yuntian gets from being on the Martial Rankings will be given to your Thousand Crane Sect as compensation, alright?”

The reason he was so impatient to kill Yang Ye was just as he’d explained. It was naturally for the Mo Clan’s reputation and honor. Honor and reputation were everything for these huge clans! But he knew that he had to gain Feng Qingyu’s agreement if he intended to kill someone in Thousand Crane Dimension. If she didn’t agree, then it would be impossible to change anything even if his Mo Clan sent 2 more Quasi Emperors here!

Every single Diamond Rank power had its own grand formation to guard the sect, and once it was activated, then not to mention Quasi Emperors, even Emperors might perish beneath its might!

As for the spirit vein, the Mo Clan had more than enough.

The corners of Feng Qingyu’s eyes twitched slightly when she heard Mo Ji, and she said, “Is what you just said true?”

Mo Ji replied, “Of course!”

Feng Qingyi’s eyes closed, and an instant passed before she opened her eyes and gazed at Yang Ye, “Let her go and I’ll allow both of you to take your own lives. Otherwise, if we are to act ourselves, then both of you’ll be obliterated!”

Yang Ye paid no attention to Feng Qingyu. He walked over to Xiao Yuxi, and he gazed at Xiao Yuxi and smiled, “Are you afraid?”

She shook her head slightly.

Yang Ye toucher her face lightly and said, “I’m not afraid as well!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

As he spoke, Yang Ye waved his right hand, and then a ray of light shot forward before Qian Wenlan’s head flew up into the air.

After that, Yang Ye turned around to gaze at Feng Qingyu and Mo Ji, and he spoke ferociously, “Quasi Emperors? What’s so great about that?”

As soon as he finished speaking, his Void Rank sword intent and slaughter intent surged out from within him, and then they suddenly started to condense.

An instant later....

Crack!

The space in a huge area instantly cracked apart!
