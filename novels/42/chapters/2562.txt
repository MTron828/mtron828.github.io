Chapter 2563

The sword intent and sword energy erupted in all directions, but Qi Bitian waved her hand a moment later, and all of that powerful sword intent and sword energy vanished without a trace.

Meanwhile, Qi Bitian tapped Executor, and the latter shook violently!

Quite some time passed before Executor gradually calmed down.

“Huh?” Suddenly, Qi Bitian spoke with surprise, “Interesting!”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “What is it?” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Qi Bitian replied, “The person who sealed this sword of yours is quite strong.”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Qi Bitian scanned Executor and said, “I’ve undone this sword’s seal. However, there’s still 10% to be unsealed. It only has 90% of its strength right now!”

“What about the final 10%?” Yang Ye was stunned, and he asked, “Can it be unsealed?”

She shook her head, “It can’t!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She pointed at the tip of the sword. The tip was broken. She said, “This is where this sword’s strength is greatest, and it has been sealed. But the person who placed that seal isn’t the previous owner of this sword.”

Yang Ye asked, “Then who was it?”

Qi Bitian shook her head, “I don’t know! Moreover, I can sense that person didn’t just seal that part of this sword, that person even broke off this sword’s tip. This sword would be quite amazing if its tip was still intact. But now, while it’s not a lousy sword, it’s just ordinary. However, it’s alright for you. If it’s in my hands, I wouldn’t even use it. It’s too inferior!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened, and he wondered if she knew how to speak!

After all, it was such an insult!

Yang Ye endured it!

Qi Bitian placed the sword on the table, “I can help you unseal the last 10%, but this sword’s strength is mostly at its tip. If I unseal that, you won’t be able to control it. At that time, you’ll be in for some suffering when your sword is much stronger than you.”

His sword would be much stronger than him!

Yang Ye picked up Executor, and as soon as he did that, he sensed that there was something different about it!

As for what exactly was different, Yang Ye couldn’t put a finger on it. However, it was clearly much, much stronger than before! Or it should be said that he was much, much stronger than before now!

Yang Ye put the sword away and said, “Alright, let’s continue with our game.”

Qi Bitian smiled when she heard him.

In the beginning, she’d thought that Yang Ye was merely playing with her for the sake of getting her to help him, but now, she felt that Yang Ye must really like playing.

Little Yang isn’t bad at all!

That was what Qi Bitian thought!

Just like that, Yang Ye played with Qi Bitian for over two hours. During this time, he’d casually asked her some questions… In short, after these games with her, he’d benefitted tremendously!

In the end, when he noticed that she didn’t really feel like continuing, Yang Ye hurriedly proposed they continue another day, and she happily agreed to it.

Just like that, Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda.

Outside the pagoda, Yang Ye wiped off the sweat on his face. It was truly tiring! It was more tiring than fighting a drawn-out battle!

In his abode, Yang Ye gazed at Executor. There was a wisp of sword energy flowing slowly around its blade, but it would turn around upon arriving before its tip.

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while, and then his sword intent surged into it.

In an instant, a sword howl resounded through the Ancient Sword Sect!

At this moment, all the sword cultivators of the sect looked in the direction of Yang Ye’s abode.

In the abode, Executor shook violently in Yang Ye’s grasp and seemed like it was about to pierce through the sky!

It was extremely aggressive!

If this sword seemed dead and silent in the past, then it was sharp and aggressive now! Besides that, Yang Ye noticed that it was actually quite strenuous for him to hold it now!

It was strenuous!

Yang Ye was shocked in his heart. Obviously, this sword was gradually revealing its true strength. Fortunately, Qi Bitian hadn’t fully unsealed it, otherwise, he may not be able to control it!

Once it was stronger than him, their roles would be flipped!

Yang Ye put it away, left his abode, and went to the meeting hall of the Ancient Sword Sect.

There were only two people here—Sword Scroll and Gu Nan.

Yang Ye sat down and asked, “Has the Soul Sect taken any action lately?”

Sword Scroll nodded, “Yes, a mysterious barrier has appeared in an area of 500 km around our sect!”

“A mysterious barrier?” Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What barrier?”

Sword Scroll shook her head, “We don’t know yet. So, let’s go have a look!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then they left the hall and went outside the sect.

Yang Ye looked up into the sky. The area 500km away from the sect was pitch black. He glanced at the surroundings, and he noticed that it was the same in all directions around the sect.

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “They plan to lock us down here.”

Sword Scroll nodded, “Indeed. They don’t want any of us to leave. Moreover, my intuition tells me that they seem to be waiting!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Waiting?”

Sword Scroll nodded, “They are definitely waiting. I just don’t know what they are waiting for. But I have no doubt that once the time comes, they will launch the fiercest attack that they can.”

Yang Ye gazed at the darkness in the surroundings, and a short while passed before he withdrew the Universe Seal. It soared up slowly, and then a strand of mysterious energy rippled out from it!

The Universe Seal could destroy any barrier and formation!

Even though it was a little too exaggerated, he had no doubt it could break open barriers and formations.

However, the energy emanated by the Universe Seal hadn’t even arrived before the darkness when a strand of powerful energy obliterated it!

Yang Ye frowned at the sight of this.

What the heck was that?!

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Ye flicked a strand of sword energy into the sky. It entered the darkness in the distance, but it didn’t even cause the slightest fluctuation in the barrier!

Not even the slightest change had occurred!

“What the hell?” Yang Ye frowned, and then he activated the Universe Seal again. It transformed into a ray of light that shot toward the darkness, but it only took a moment for Yang Ye’s expression to change drastically while he hurriedly summoned the Universe Seal back to him!

Because when the Universe Seal shot over there, the darkness had condensed, and then a black awl emerged from within it!

A Super Divine Treasure!

Yang Ye had come into contact with it in the past!

It had almost shattered his Universe Seal!

Sword Scroll spoke solemnly, “It’s being protected by a Super Divine Treasure.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Looks like they are getting serious! Alright, let me see if their Super Divine Treasure is powerful, or is mine!”

He was about to head over but Sword Scroll stopped him.

Sword Scroll shook her head, “Don’t risk it.”

Gu Nan chimed in, “Sword Scroll is right, don’t rashly take risks. You’re linked to the survival of our entire sect. If anything were to happen to you, our sect would be forced to submit without even trying to fight back!”

Yang Ye glanced at the darkness in the distance. He did sense danger coming from it!

He knew that the Soul Sect was really serious about this attack.

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly. The space before him shook, and then an ethereal figure appeared in front of him!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly while sword intent rippled out from him, and it enveloped the ethereal figure!

“Sect Master Yang, don’t attack me!” The ethereal figure swiftly said, “I’m not from the Soul Sect.”

Yang Ye sized up the ethereal figure and withdrew his sword intent. The figure cupped its fist at Yang Ye and said, “I’m a Deathguard of the desolate race. Greetings Young Master Yang!”

A Desolate Deathguard!

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he asked, “You’re from the desolate race?”

The ethereal figure nodded, “A Desolate Deathguard. The Junior Patriarch wished to ask you if everything is alright?”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “Not really!”

The deathguard said, “Is it because of the Soul Sect?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The deathguard said, “Shall we speak someplace else?”

Yang Ye nodded and brought the deathguard to his abode.

Yang Ye glanced at the deathguard and asked, “What are you doing here?”

The deathguard replied, “Our race may not be in Eternal Kingdom, but we do know quite a bit about what’s happening here. Our Junior Patriarch sent me here immediately upon hearing about the situation you’re in.”

Yang Ye’s eyes lit up, “To help me?”

The deathguard shook his head, “He wants you to leave the Ancient Sword Sect!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

The deathguard said, “Young Master Yang, the Soul Sect isn’t ordinary, and taking over the Ancient Sword Sect isn’t something they are doing on their own. It’s something the entire Eternal Kingdom is doing together. Simply speaking, the people at the top of Eternal Kingdom agreed to this because it is aligned with their interests, and it’s for the sake of fighting my desolate race. So, they won’t stop. If it’s necessary, those people at the top of Eternal Kingdom will personally help the Soul Sect. If you stay here, it’s equivalent to going against the entire Eternal Kingdom!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while and said, “How much do you know about the Soul Sect?”

The deathguard hesitated for a moment and replied, “We know a little. It’s a mysterious organization that once disturbed the interests of some existences in Eternal Kingdom. Thus, they were punished and forced into hiding. But this time, they are being smart about it and are doing as some powers desire. So, they were allowed to emerge into the world once more. Moreover, they convinced the others to divide up the Ancient Sword Sect. Young Master Yang, the Junior Patriarch said that you should leave the Ancient Sword Sect immediately and not get involved in this. Otherwise, it’ll only lead to death!”

Death!

In the abode, Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, “Go back and tell him I appreciate his intentions.”

The deathguard hesitated for a moment and sighed softly. He withdrew a scroll and pitch black command token, placed them before Yang Ye, and said, “The Junior Patriarch said that if you refuse to leave, then these should be given to you. He said that they may be of use to you. Farewell!”

He turned around and vanished.

Yang Ye gazed silently at the two items before him.
