Chapter 1691 - Never Afraid!

However, that wasn’t the end of it. Numerous golden armored cultivators and mounted cultivators instantly arrived before Yang Ye, and then their spears stabbed at Yang Ye’s vital points.

Suddenly, a ray of golden light flashed, and a woman appeared before Yang Ye.

It was An Nanjing!

An Nanjing’s face was extremely calm when she saw the state Yang Ye was in. An instant later, she turned to look at the Zenith Realm warriors that were around Yang Ye, and then she stomped her right foot down and transformed into a ray of golden light that vanished on the spot.

Hiss!

At the same moment that her figure vanished, a spear pierced through the head of a Zenith Realm expert, and she was already behind that Zenith Realm expert. She grabbed her spear and swiftly swung it to her left.

Hiss!

A ray of golden light flashed, and the Zenith Realm expert on her left was instantly stabbed by Skysplit. Meanwhile, An Nanjing appeared behind that Zenith Realm expert, and then she tapped her right foot against the ground and soared up into the air. After that, she kicked Skysplit with her right foot.

Swoosh!

Skysplit transformed into a ray of golden light again, and it vanished on the spot.

Hiss!

An instant later, Skysplit pierced through the head of a cavalry. Meanwhile, An Nanjing had appeared behind that expert, and she kicked that cavalry’s head.

Bang!

That Zenith Realm expert’s head instantly exploded apart while An Nanjing vanished on the spot again with Skysplit in her grasp.

Hiss!

A moment later, a Zenith Realm expert not too far behind Yang Ye was instantly stabbed through the head. At the instant her spear pierced through that expert’s head, An Nanjing had appeared behind that expert, and then she stretched out her right hand. Skysplit, which had just pierced through that expert’s head, fell right into her grasp.

Suddenly, numerous golden arrows descended from the sky. An Nanjing’s expression remained indifferent as she raised her spear and stabbed repeatedly.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

The arrows were struck down, and then she tossed Skysplit towards the archers.

Swish!

Skysplit tore through the air and emanated a terrifying golden glow as it shot towards one of the archers. That archer had instantly turned ghastly pale upon witnessing this. Because it was impossible for him to dodge it!

Suddenly, an old man appeared before that archer, and then a fist-sized dragon shaped seal appeared before him. The seal instantly trembled violently upon colliding with Skysplit, and then a wave of powerful force surged out from it and blasted Skysplit away.

An Nanjing’s expression remained calm. She stretched out her hand and Skysplit returned to her grasp.

An Nanjing didn’t attack again. She walked over to Yang Ye and gazed at him for a long time before she said, “I’m late!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “It’s fine. I can still deal with this.” As he spoke, he shook his body, and the arrows in him were blasted out of him. As soon as that happened, blood sprayed out from him like fountains, and it instantly covered him in blood.

An Nanjing lowered her head slightly, “Why didn’t you call for me?”

Yang Ye grinned, “You were in closed door cultivation. I didn’t want to disturb you!”

She suddenly looked up at him, “That isn’t as important as you, right?”

Yang Ye chuckled and said, “Fine, I won’t do it again. Alright?”

An Nanjing gazed at him for a long time, and then she nodded. After that, she moved behind Yang Ye.

Bang!

Meanwhile, a loud explosion resounded from afar. After that, Yang Shen and the other old man who was in battle with Qiong Qi were blasted 3km away. Once he blasted them back, Qiong Qi’s flashed back over to Yang Ye’s side.

Yang Ye looked up at the 3rd True Realm expert to make an appearance. The old man wore a violet robe. His robe wasn’t the only thing which was violet, even his hair was violet, and there was a fist-sized dragon shaped seal floating in front of him. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

It was the leader of the Yang Clan’s Seven Marshals, Yang Ling.

Yang Ling glanced at Yang Ye, An Nanjing, and Qiong Qi. He remained silent for a moment, and then he shook his head, “We thought the 72 warriors and two True Realm experts could guarantee success. However, we never expected that they would still be incapable of killing you even after the 72 warriors were practically annihilated! Your strength and trump cards have shocked us all.”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “And?”

Yang Ling replied, “If… if we knew you possessed such strength and trump cards, we may have used a different method to deal with you. It wouldn’t just be us, even the neutral people in the Yang Clan may not have allowed us to act against you. However…”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “However, you have to die now. Even those neutral fellows will choose to kill you.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Yang Ling replied, “Because the clan will never allow someone hostile to the clan to stay alive. Especially someone that possesses formidable natural talent and potential. After all, it’s impossible for you to hold no hatred towards the clan now, right?”

Yang Ye grinned, “I understand. Actually, I had no hatred towards the Yang Clan. Of course, I had no sense of belonging to the clan as well. However, when all of you wanted me to return, you forced me to return when I refused. But once I did return, all of those young masters wanted to kill me instead. I had no choice but to fight back. Once I fought back and revealed both my strength and potential, then all of you higher-ups of the clan wanted to kill me. All of you are really acting like bullies!”

He glanced at the sky and said, “I, Yang Ye, differentiate clearly between kindness and enmity. I don’t offend unless offended. Since the Yang Clan treated me like this, I swear that if I don’t die, the day will come when I’ll definitely make the Yang Clan pay a hundredfold!”

Yang Ling suddenly said, “Saying that will only increase our determination to kill you!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “All of you’ll try to kill me even if I didn’t say that, right? Don’t tell me that the Yang Clan will let me live if I kneel down and beg for mercy.”

Yang Ling fell silent for a moment and shook his head, “We won’t. Now, you have no way out, and it’s the same for the clan. Because the clan doesn’t want there to be an extraordinary genius who’s hostile towards the clan. So, you must die today!”

Yang Ye gazed at An Nanjing, “Are you afraid?”

An Nanjing gazed at him, “When have I ever been afraid?”

Yang Ye roared with laughter. He laughed for a while before he looked up at the sky, and then he said, “Well said! Well said! When have we ever been afraid? The Yang Clan! Bring it! Let me see if one of the eight supreme clans of Milky Way System can kill me today!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Yang Ling when he appeared once more. After that, he drew his sword and swung it.

Yang Ling’s expression remained unchanged. He twisted his wrist slightly, and the golden dragon seal transformed into a ray of golden light that shot towards Yang Ye’s sword.

Golden light surged out like overlapped waves from the seal, and they instantly enveloped Yang Ye and his sword.

Bang!

An explosion resounded. The golden light shattered into bits, and the powerful energy that erupted from there blasted Yang Ye back to where he’d been standing a few moments ago.

Yang Ling glanced at his dragon seal. There was a mark on it.

Yang Ling pondered deeply for a moment, and then he looked up at Yang Ye, “That sword is supposedly still sealed. It’s truly difficult to imagine. If its seal is undone and returns to its original state, then its might would probably be sufficient to obliterate everything before it.”

It’s sealed?

Yang Ye looked down at the wooden sword in his grasp. He hadn’t expected that the wooden sword was actually in a sealed state!

It was so strong while still in a sealed state!

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment, and then he gazed at the wooden sword, “Brother, I think you can’t continue keeping a low profile. It’s time to undo your seal.”

The wooden sword shook slightly while sword howls resounded from within it, and then Yang Ye sensed a trace of its emotions!

It was disgruntled, furious, and slightly fearful!

Yang Ye possessed the Enlightened Sword Heart and Zenith Rank sword intent, so he was able to very clearly sense all the emotions of the swords in his grasp.

At this moment, the wooden sword felt disgruntled, furious, and slightly fearful!

Obviously, it hadn’t sealed itself, and it was someone else who’d sealed it!

Who sealed it? Yang Ye shook his head and restrained his thoughts. Because that wasn’t what he should be worried about right now. After he consoled the wooden sword, Yang Ye looked up at Yang Ling and said, “Come, let’s continue!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Yang Ling when he appeared again. After that, he swung his sword again.

The wooden sword descended, and the space around him collapsed in an instant.

A wisp of solemness flashed through Yang Ling’s eyes. He didn’t dare act carelessly, and he tapped a finger against the golden seal.

Roar!

A dragon roar resounded, and then a wave of terrifying dragon pressure rippled out from the seal. At the same time, the space in a huge area shook violently before cracking open.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword arrived before him!

Bang!

As soon as sword and seal collided, the space here instantly collapsed, but it only took a moment for it to return to normal.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had been blasted 3km away while Yang Lin had been blasted around 1km away!

As soon as Yang Ye stopped himself, a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth. He looked up at the dragon seal before Yang Ling. The dragon shaped seal was no ordinary treasure, and it was at the True Realm, at least. If he didn’t have the wooden sword, he would probably be unable to resist even a single attack from Yang Ling!

Yang Ling fell silent for a moment, and then he said, “Looks like I can’t kill you on my own.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand. In an instant, over 10 powerful auras suddenly charged up into the sky from all directions, and then they shot towards Yang Ye!

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he gazed at An Nanjing. An Nanjing looked him in the eyes and said, “Our heart is one. Not to mention the Yang Clan, even if we have to face all eight clans, what is there to fear?”
