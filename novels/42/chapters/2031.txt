Chapter 2032 – Why Don’t You Try?

Everyone here gazed at Yang Ye when they heard him.

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “You’ve met me?”

The black shadow suddenly asked, “What’s your name?”

Yang Ye replied, “If you haven’t, then just forget it!”

The black shadow fell silent.

Meanwhile, Ji Yue suddenly stepped forward, “Since we’re all here, let’s go.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she flipped her right palm, and a fiery red pearl appeared there. It floated up slowly and stopped in midair.

Xuanyuan Yan, Jiang Po, and the mysterious black shadow revealed pearls each as well, and those three pearls seemed to have been drawn by something. They floated up and formed a circle with Ji Yue’s pearl.

As soon as they converged together, the ground below them shook violently, and then the ground here suddenly cracked open. It wasn’t just the area below their feet, even the mountain in front of them gradually cracked open. The world around them was undergoing a tremendous change!

It didn’t take long for the base of the mountain to crack open and reveal a city.

Ji Yue waved her hand lightly, and her pearl flew back into her grasp. After that, she gazed at the others, “Let’s go!”

She gazed at the old man, “Uncle Jiang, just wait for us here!”

The masked old man nodded slightly, “Be careful!”

Ji Yue nodded, and then she started walking slowly towards the city with the others. It didn’t take long for them to arrive before its gates, and there were three words inscribed there with black lettering—Sky Capital City!

“So this is what Sky Capital City looks like!” Meanwhile, Xuanyuan Yan spoke abruptly, “It isn’t like what I imagined!”

Jiang Po added, “Indeed!”

Ji Yue grinned, “Good luck everyone. I’ll be leaving first!”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “I’ll be trouble you, Brother Ye!”

Yang Ye nodded and started pushing her towards the side.

Meanwhile, Jiang Po suddenly said, “What the heck is the Ji Clan up to? They sent two people!”

“He’s probably not from the Ji Clan!” Meanwhile, Xuanyuan Yan said, “However, that makes this even more mysterious. He isn’t from the Ji Clan, but they are willing to let him come here with her. Is he her lover?”

He shook his head, chuckled, and vanished into the distance.

The black shadow and Jiang Po fell silent for a short while before vanishing.

Yang Ye pushed Ji Yue forward according to her guidance. She spoke softly while they traveled, “This place is where our clans’ ancestors perished, including Emperor Xuanyuan. He came here too when he died. So, this is our ancestral grave.”

Yang Ye asked, “It isn’t that simple, right?”

Ji Yue smiled, “Of course. It’s a place that only the patriarchs and future patriarchs of the four clans can come to. We come here to receive our ancestor’s inheritance. This will be a turning point in our lives!”

Yang Ye said, “The Ji Clan’s divine beast…”

She spoke softly, “You’ll see it very soon.”

It didn’t take long for them to arrive before a river, and Ji Yue asked him to stop before it.

Yang Ye looked up. There was a white palace further ahead.

Ji Yue gazed at the palace and spoke softly, “Descendant of the Ji Clan, Ji Yue, is here to see you, Ancestor. I’m injured, so I can’t bow. Please forgive me!”

Suddenly, an ethereal figure floated out from the palace.

It was an old man!

The old man gazed at Ji Yue, and then surprise gradually appeared in his eyes, “That’s… the Sacred Spirit…”

She nodded slightly and seemed to be admitting something.

A smile appeared on the old man’s face, “The heavens are good to my Ji Clan.”

Meanwhile, his gaze descended upon Yang Ye, “You’re not from my Ji Clan.”

Suddenly, surprise flashed through the old man’s eyes, “Interesting… You’re not ordinary!”

Meanwhile, Ji Yue said, “The Sword Supreme is in his possession. He’s here to help me!”

The old man gazed at Yang Ye again, “You have the Sword Supreme?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The old man asked, “Can I have a look at it?”

Yang Ye didn’t refuse and flicked it over to the old man. A wisp of complicated emotions flashed through the old man’s eyes, “It really is that sword!”

A short while passed before the old man chuckled, “Emperor Xuanyuan’s strength instantly rose far above all of us because of this sword. Even gods found its might difficult to resist!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “Senior, if Emperor Xuanyuan was that strong, why did he fall in the end?”

The old man gazed at Yang Ye, “In the past, there was a hunter, and he had a hunting dog. The hunting dog helped him kill many of his prey. However, in the end, he killed that hunting dog of his.”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed because there was a lot of information in that metaphor!

Meanwhile, the old man spoke softly, “Emperor Xuanyuan died because he was too strong. If he wasn’t that strong, perhaps he would still be alive! Of course, he wouldn’t have died if he was a little stronger too. Unfortunately, he wasn’t able to break through his limits. So, he died!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man flicked the sword back to Yang Ye, “This sword is a powerful weapon, but it may inflict harm on its owner. Kid, be careful!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Thank you for the warning!”

Meanwhile, the old man gazed at Ji Yue, “Come with me.”

He vanished into the sky.

Ji Yue gazed at Yang Ye, “Brother Yang, wait a moment!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright!”

Ji Yue didn’t say anything else. Meanwhile, a ray of light suddenly enveloped her, and then she vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and sat down cross-legged.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Snowy was playing with Tian Xiu. Tian Xiu seemed to have become much livelier after she met Snowy, and she wasn’t that quiet anymore.

Yang Ye could see that she really liked Snowy, and she really treated Snowy as a friend and not a pet.

Snowy’s eyes lit up when she saw Yang Ye, and then she flew over to Yang Ye’s shoulder and rubbed her head against Yang Ye’s cheek.

Yang Ye smiled as he rubbed Snowy’s head, and then he walked over to Tian Xiu and spoke softly, “Do you like it here?”

Tian Xiu hesitated for a moment and replied, “I like Snowy!”

Yang Ye’s smile stiffened slightly, and then he looked up at the sky. Actually, he could sense that the Primordial Pagoda didn’t really welcome her, and he didn’t know the reason for that either. However, he knew that Tian Xiu was definitely not an ordinary person, and she may have made the Primordial Pagoda feel threatened!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and rubbed her head, “That’s good. Don’t worry, just play happily here. You can tell me if you want to eat anything. I’ll bring it for you!”

“Re-Really?” Tian Xiu looked up at Yang Ye with a clear pair of eyes.

Yang Ye nodded and smiled, “Of course!”

Tian Xiu said, “I… I want a steamed bun!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Alright. Once I’m done here, I’ll get you a lot to eat until you’re satisfied!”

Tian Xiu nodded, and then she seemed to have thought of something and gazed at Snowy, “Are you going to have some?”

Snowy blinked and gazed at Yang Ye. She seemed to be asking what steamed buns were.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and explained, “It’s a type of food. However, I… I don’t know if you’ll eat it…”

Snowy hurriedly nodded to indicate that she would.

Snowy eating steamed buns… It was quite an amusing thought to Yang Ye.

After playing with Snowy and Tian Xiu for a while, Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda and looked up at the white palace. There were no signs of activity coming from it.

Yang Ye started cultivating in meditation.

Just like that, three days passed before the palace doors opened, and then Ji Yue appeared before Yang Ye.

She spoke softly, “I’m sorry to have kept you waiting!”

Yang Ye sized her up. At this moment, she was a little different, but he couldn’t put a finger on it. Yang Ye didn’t think further about it and asked, “What now?”

She smiled, “Please come with me!”

Ji Yue waved her right hand at the river, and it split towards the sides.

Yang Ye glanced down, and he saw a bottomless abyss below the river.

Ji Yue said, “I’ll leave it to you!”

Yang Ye nodded and walked over to her, and then he started pushing her down the river.

Yang Ye asked, “It’s down below?”

She nodded, “Since the holy sword vanished, my Ji Clan’s divine beast has never seen the light of day for countless years.

Yang Ye asked, “It hasn’t undergone any huge changes to its personality, right?”

She smiled, “Don’t worry, Brother Yang. It’s a divine beast, not a ferocious beast. It’s gentle and won’t try to harm others unnecessarily!”

Yang Ye nodded, “That’s good to hear!”

They sped up their descent, and it didn’t take long for them to reach the ground. Yang Ye looked up, and he saw a circular platform not too far away. There was a 300m long pillar of white light on it, and Yang Ye could faintly see the outline of a colossus within it.

Ji Yue spoke softly, “That’s it!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when a ray of red light suddenly flashed out from behind Yang Ye. It was extremely swift and instantly entered the pillar of white light.

Aowu!!

An instant later, shrill cries resounded from the pillar of white light!

Both of them were stunned on the spot.

A moment later, Yang Ye was about to attack when an ethereal face suddenly appeared before him, and it cracked a smile and said, “Don’t even think about it!”
