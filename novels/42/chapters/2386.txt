Yang Ye stopped in the clouds, and the Myriad World Diagram appeared in his grasp.

The Myriad World Diagram could teleport him anywhere he wanted!

Yang Ye unfurled it, glanced at the surroundings, and then his gaze descended onto a certain point. A moment later, he tapped it.

A blue circle of light appeared below Yang Ye’s feet, and then his body gradually turned ethereal.

Right when Yang Ye was about to vanish completely, a middle aged man in a luxurious robe appeared not too far ahead of him.

The man looked Yang Ye in the eye, and then he stretched his right hand forward and grasped it.

In an instant, the space around Yang Ye warped.

Yang Ye looked the man in the eye in silence, and his body grew more and more ethereal. A short while later, he vanished completely.

The middle aged man’s expression remained indifferent. No one knew what he was thinking.

A short while later, the middle aged man looked to the left, and a man was approaching from there. The man wore a loose robe and held two balls of white light in his right hand. The man glanced at the middle aged man and smiled, “Initial Emperor, I didn’t expect you to return so quickly!”

The Initial Emperor!

The middle aged man was the former patriarch of the Shiyuan Clan, the Initial Emperor!

The Initial Emperor replied indifferently, “Beichuan Xiu, I thought you died in the Eternal River!”

Beichuan Xiu!

The man was the former patriarch of the Beichuan Clan, Beichuan Xiu!

Beichuan Xiu smiled, “I almost died on many occasions. Unfortunately, my life is a hard one to take, so I just can’t die!”

The Initial Emperor closed his eyes slowly, “Since you’re all here, then show yourselves!”

As soon as he said that, an old man appeared over 1km to his right. The old man glanced at where Yang Ye had vanished from and said, “The future generations really do grow better. I didn’t expect such an expert to come from Eternal Border.”

He gazed at the Initial Emperor and Beichuan Xiu, “I forgot to introduce myself. I’m Hanyuan Ting.”

Hanyuan Ting!

The Initial Emperor and Beichuan Xiu’s expressions changed slightly. The Hanyuan Clan’s Hanyuan Ting was someone senior to them. When they’d just arrived at Eternal Border, Hanyuan Ting was already renowned here.

Meanwhile, they suddenly looked to the right, and the space there trembled more and more violently.

Crack!

A few breaths of time later, a clear and loud crack resounded before a spear pierced through the space there, and then a ferocious voice resounded, “Where’s that little bastard, Yang Ye?”

A middle aged man wearing black clothes appeared here.

The man had short hair and a vicious expression on his face.

“Yue Gou!” Beichuan Xiu spoke abruptly, “You should be the Yue Clan’s Yue Gou.”

The man glanced at Beichuan Xiu, “And who are you?”

Beichuan Xiu smiled, “The Beichuan Clan’s Beichuan Xiu!”

The Beichuan Clan? Yue Gou frowned, “Where’s Yang Ye?”

All of them really wanted to kill Yang Ye. Not just for the Sprite Progenitor, but because Yang Ye had practically annihilated their clans. Especially Yue Gou because Yang Ye had blasted apart the entire island which the Yue Clan resided on. That was no different than annihilating his clan. Actually, he wasn’t the only one, all of them had a similar level of enmity with Yang Ye!

While they couldn’t compare to the Immortal Estate or those hidden powers like the Freedom Sect, the six clans were able to make those powers give them some face because of their presence.

However, Yang Ye didn’t give them any face, nothing at all!

Meanwhile, Beichuan Xiu smiled, “Amongst the six clans, the Nanli Clan was able to avoid suffering at Yang Ye’s hands because of Nanli Meng. So, I don’t know if their ancestor will be coming. Besides that, the Luoli Clan’s ancestor isn’t here. I wonder…”

He suddenly looked to the side, and a man in a white robe and holding a jade fan was walking through the air there.

The man was dressed like a scholar and had a very dense scholarly aura as well!

It was the Luoli Clan’s ancestor, Luoli Ming.

Luoli Ming gazed at them and grinned, “I’m late.”

Yue Gou suddenly turned around with the desire to leave, but Beichuan Xiu suddenly said, “Yue Gou, are you planning on going to kill Yang Ye?”

Yue Gou replied indifferently, “What else?”

Beichuan Xiu smiled, “Since this is such a rare occasion that we’re all gathered here, I wonder if you’ll allow me to say a few words?”

Yue Gou hesitated for a moment and didn’t leave.

Beichuan Xiu smiled, “Everyone, according to my knowledge, we aren’t the only ones who’ve come here. Up until now, the Divine Martial Rankings has existed for seven generations, and the top ten in every generation… Fine, only the top five in every generation can be considered as outstanding by all of you. According to my knowledge, they’re rushing back to Eternal Border too.”

Beichuan Xiu shook his head and smiled at this point, “Besides them, there are some other hidden experts as well. Since they have been able to enter the Eternal River and survive, it’s enough to prove their strength. Of course, the truly powerful are those powers like the Freedom sect. If I’m not wrong, their experts are returning too!”

The others gazed at Beichuan Xiu and waited for him to continue!

Beichuan Xiu continued, “Yang Ye annihilated our clans, but I’m certain the true reason you returned from the Eternal River is mostly because of that Sprite Progenitor. All of you were once people who commanded great respect and authority, but allow me to be honest, even if you obtain that Sprite Progenitor, do you think that you can keep it safe?”

They fell silent.

The Sprite Progenitor!

Beichuan Xiu was right. The real reason they’d returned was the Sprite Progenitor. But even if they obtained it, could they keep it?

Could they?

It was absolutely impossible on their own! Anyone who obtained it would become the next Yang Ye and be targeted by countless others!

Meanwhile, Beichuan Xiu said, “Don’t forget that the Freedom Sect and those other sects have joined forces, and their objective is that Sprite Progenitor too. So, I suggest that we should join forces. Only our joint forces stand a chance against those powers and the countless other experts!”

Joint forces!

The surroundings fell silent!

Luoli Ming suddenly smiled, “Beichuan Xiu is right. Since our objective is the Sprite Progenitor, we have to join forces. After all, those old bastards in the Eternal River aren’t that easy to deal with. Besides that, the Sovereign Sect still hasn’t revealed itself. I refuse to believe that it can remain indifferent even toward a Sprite Progenitor. So long as they are tempted, they will show themselves. Thus, regardless of whether it’s for the Sprite Progenitor or for safety’s sake, I think we should join forces. Even if we can’t get the Sprite Progenitor with our joint forces, our combined strength is more than enough to guarantee that we leave with our lives intact!”

Leave alive!

All of them made their decisions once they listened up to this point.

Meanwhile, Yue Gou suddenly asked, “When do we strike?”

Beichuan Xiu smiled, “We naturally can’t. Our best option right now is to watch and see what happens. After all, the first to attack will be the first to face the same situation Yang Ye is facing right now!”

Yue Gou asked, “Then are we just supposed to wait?”

Beichuan Xiu shook his head slightly, “There will definitely be some who can’t wait. For example, the Guardians! Yang Ye killed so many of them, and those fellows who are so used to feeling superior will never be able to endure that!”

The Guardians!

The fact that Yang Ye had killed Guardians was no secret, and they were actually shocked by his actions. Because even they had to give the Guardians face all those years ago, but Yang Ye killed them instead!

As far as they were concerned, he was absolutely ruthless!

Meanwhile, Beichuan Xiu suddenly looked to the right, “Actually, I’m more curious about that other person’s reaction!”

At a mountain range, there was an expanse of ruins. The ruins were the ruins of the Immortal Estate.

The Immortal Estate that Tian Xiu had destroyed that day!

At this moment, a woman in a white dress was standing there.

The Immortal Estate’s founder, Yi Shuihan!

Yi Shuihan closed her eyes slowly while a wave of invisible energy dispersed from within her. A short while later, the energy had swept toward the surroundings, and it traveled through countless worlds in the blink of an eye!

She seemed to be searching for something!

A long time passed before the energy returned to Yi Shuihan. She opened her eyes and glanced at the sky with an icy cold gaze, “I’ll kill you no matter where you go!”

Meanwhile, in a gray world, a petite young girl was walking slowly toward a bridge in the distance. She seemed to have sensed something and stopped abruptly. She shot a glance to the side while a grin curved up on her lips.

It was a grin of disdain!

The young girl moved her gaze away and looked up at the bridge before putting her hands behind her back and continuing toward it.

Her figure gradually vanished.

Eternal Border. Nanli Clan.

A young woman and a beautiful woman were sitting facing each other.

The young woman was Nanli Meng, and the beautiful older woman was the ancestor of the Nanli Clan, Nanli Yin, who’d led the Nanli Clan to Eternal Border years ago.

Nanli Yin had quite the complicated emotions in her heart as she gazed at Nanli Meng. After her, the Nanli Clan rarely produced extraordinary geniuses, and one had finally been born. However, this extraordinary genius was fond of doing meaningless things and didn’t put the clan first!

A long time passed before Nanli Yin suddenly said, “The Sprite Progenitor is an opportunity for us, and I can’t give it up!”

Nanli Meng didn’t say anything. She stood up and walked away. When she arrived at the door, she suddenly stopped and said, “That woman told me something when she left—If anything happens to him or that Sprite Progenitor, then she will bury everyone linked to it.”

Nanli Meng paused for a moment at this point and continued, “She wasn’t joking, and she can do it.”

Nanli Meng closed her eyes slowly, “After all, she possesses one of the 10 great physiques! Moreover, it’s one she cultivated on her own, the Reversed Physique…”
