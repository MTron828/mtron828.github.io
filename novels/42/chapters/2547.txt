Chapter 2548

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye went to the cultivation room, sat down cross-legged, and closed his eyes slowly.

He’d absorbed the souls of Lord Realm experts earlier!

Moreover, it wasn’t ordinary souls because the experts of the Soul Sect focused on cultivating their souls. So the purity and strength of their souls wasn’t something that ordinary Lord Realm experts could compare to.

It could be said that the soul of a single Lord Realm expert from the Soul Sect was comparable to the souls of three other Lord Realm experts!

Yang Ye had absorbed the souls of 4 Lord Realm experts and 7 Five World Realm experts earlier!

He'd rapidly absorbed these souls upon devouring them!

And he’d used all of the energy he obtained from them to strengthen his body!

His body had to advance in order for his cultivation to advance!

While Yang Ye cultivated, the Ancient Sword Sect was gradually calming down with Sword Scroll and Gu Nan dealing with all the affairs of the sect.

Sword Scroll was quite skilled in these things. Or to be more precise, she cared a lot about the Ancient Sword Sect. After all, she was born here, and while she had a bad impression of the previous sect master, she was still thankful to the other ancestors of the sect who’d forged her.

She treated this place as her home!

Besides that, she had her own selfish intentions. She hoped that Yang Ye would treat it as his home too. Of course, she felt quite guilty for having made Yang Ye take up the position of sect master and fall into such a situation.

However, there was something Yang Ye said that made her guilt vanish!

Yang Ye said that friends were there to be dragged into bad situations!

Just thinking about that made the guilt in her heart vanish…

If Yang Ye knew what she thought, he would definitely spit out blood from anger!

At the rear mountains of the Ancient Sword Sect, there was a bamboo house there, and three women were in the house!

Nether Maiden, Boundary Maiden, and the pig-riding woman!

The three of them weren’t fond of crowded and noisy places, so Yang Ye gave them a place to themselves.

They sat on the stairs outside the house.

Nether Maiden told them about what she’d experienced, including the old man with the bamboo chest. Once she finished speaking, she gazed at the other two.

Boundary Maiden thought for a moment and said, “I encountered a demon at the Eternal River. It wanted to eat me, and I refused, so we fought… In the end, I accidentally entered the depths of the river and encountered a woman. She said she belonged to some sect in Eternal Kingdom, and she was killed by the desolate race’s patriarch during the previous war against the desolate race…”

She withdrew a scroll, but there was nothing on it!

Nether Maiden asked, “What’s that?”

Boundary Maiden explained, “She gave me this, the Dao Source. She said it’s the supreme scroll of her sect, and I too felt it was pretty good after reading through it.”

The pig-riding woman asked, “And then?”

Boundary Maiden continued, “I cultivated, attained the Five World Realm, and then my Boundary Energy improved tremendously under her guidance.”

She gazed at the scroll before her and continued, “Besides to help Yang Ye, I came to Eternal Kingdom for one other reason. It’s to send this scroll back to her sect. But I don’t know where that sect is!”

The pig-riding woman asked, “What’s its name?”

Boundary Maiden thought for some time and replied, “I think it was called the Dao Source Sect.”

The pig-riding woman nodded slightly, “It’s fine. Yang Ye is the Ancient Sword Sect’s master right now, so you’ll definitely be able to find it with his help!”

Boundary Maiden nodded and gazed at the pig-riding woman, “What about you? You’re much stronger than you were!”

The pig-riding woman replied modestly, “Not at all, I’m just alright!”

While she said that, there was a very brilliant smile on her face!

Boundary Maiden felt speechless.

The pig-riding woman smiled and said, “I didn’t have any fortuitous encounters and just worked hard. While my natural talent isn’t as good as Tenth Sister and that madman, Yang Ye, it’s still not bad! I attained some accomplishments during my bitter training. However, it’s still a little inferior when compared to Madman Yang. That fellow is absolutely abnormal! I thought that when I met him again, I would definitely beat him up, but I never expected him to be strong to such an extent! Moreover, he’s even a sect master now!”

She was quite displeased at this point, “I don’t know who called him a maleficent existence in the past and said he would have a life of trouble. That’s nonsense. He’s actually chosen by the heavens. Just look at him! Even someone cheating with all kinds of treasures can’t compete with his speed!”

Nether Maiden nodded slightly and remained silent.

She was the first to meet Yang Ye, and they’d known each other since Profounder Continent. All along the way, while Yang Ye had been constantly plagued by troubles, he's been constantly receiving fortuitous encounters. Of course, Yang Ye was a very hard working person too!

Hard work!

Yang Ye had risen from the bottom, and he didn’t have luxuries others received. So, he was very well aware that he had to work much harder than everyone else, and he’d been constantly doing that throughout these years.

Even if a hard working and serious person doesn’t do that well in life, that person wouldn’t do that bad either!

Boundary Maiden suddenly asked, “What about Eldest Sister and the others?”

The pig-riding young woman shook her head, “I know Eldest Sister seems to have gone to a place called Dark Destruction World, but I don’t know anything about the others.”

“Dark Destruction World?” Boundary Maiden frowned, “What is that place?”

The pig-riding woman rolled her eyes, “Besides Eternal Kingdom, there are a myriad of other worlds. It isn’t exaggerated at all to say that there are a myriad of them. So, how would I know? In any case, she’s so strong, so she’ll be fine.”

Boundary Maiden nodded and seemed to visibly ease up.

Their eldest sister was very strong!

“But that fellow Yang Ye…” The pig-riding woman said, “Now that he’s this sect’s master, I think he’s in huge trouble. That Soul Sect doesn’t feel ordinary to me at all. Sigh, forget it. Let’s just stay and help him for now, and we can take him and run if it’s an impossible battle to win!”

Boundary Maiden grinned, “That’s a good idea!”

They sat there and constantly switched between talking about Eternal Border, Yang Ye, and Eternal Kingdom. Even when the sky had turned dark, they still sat there as if they had endless things to talk about!

After she finished dealing with the sect’s affairs, Sword Scroll went to the sect’s training grounds. Those 10 elite disciples were there. Actually, it should be 11 because Gu Nie was here now!

The disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect had a rough understanding of Sword Scroll’s identity, so they were extremely respectful toward her.

Sword Scroll glanced at them and said, “Do you have any thoughts after that battle with the Soul Sect?”

Gu Nie spoke solemnly, “They are very strong!”

Very strong!

It could be said that if Yang Ye hadn’t opened the Ancient Sword Sect’s resources to them and given them those divine treasures, they would have had no chance in the battle!

Actually, they shouldn’t have had to deal with those Lord Realm experts. After all, those experts were a level higher than them. But it couldn’t be helped because now that the Grand Elder and the others had left, only they could do it.

Sword Scroll nodded and said, “I have an understanding of all the techniques and cultivation techniques in the sect. From now on, I will spend some time guiding all of you every day. So, if you have any questions, feel free to ask me.”

All of them were overjoyed because Sword Scroll could be considered to be the oldest existence in the sect! She knew too, too much! If she was there to guide them, they would definitely obtain tremendous gains!

Sword Scroll glanced up at the sky, and there was a rather complicated expression on her face.

The Ancient Sword Sect could be said to be forcefully keeping itself alive!

In the Primordial Pagoda.

The cultivation room suddenly started to tremble because of the aura Yang Ye was emanating!

Waves of aura rippled out incessantly from Yang Ye!

He’d been meditating in the cultivation room for two weeks now!

Throughout this time, Yang Ye had been doing nothing but meditating and absorbing the energy from those souls!

Once he fully absorbed all the energy contained within those souls, his body had started to undergo a transformation… Just like that, around two more weeks passed, and his body finally advanced to the Four World Realm! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The Four World Realm in the body!

Once his body advanced, Yang Ye didn’t leave the pagoda immediately. He stopped suppressing his cultivation and allowed it to advance!

During this time, he consumed almost 50 World Crystals. He absorbed all the energy they emanated, and combined with the fact that he’d been suppressing his own cultivation, he smoothly advanced to the Four World Realm once he stopped suppressing it!

His body and cultivation were at the Four World Realm!

Besides that, Yang Ye noticed that his soul was actually slightly different now!

Or to be more precise, it was much stronger than it had been!

It wasn’t just because of the advancement in his cultivation, devouring those souls had played a huge part too!

After all, the Soul Sect’s experts improved themselves by devouring the souls of others, and the stronger the soul, the better its effects!

So, after he devoured the souls of so many Lord Realm and Five World Realm experts of the Soul Sect, while he’d used the energy obtained from them to strengthen his body, his soul had received tremendous benefits as well.

In overall, he’d benefitted tremendously!

But his true goal was the Five World Realm!

The Five World Realm!

The Five World Realm was a divide, and he could only attain the Lord Realm after he overcame it.

The Lord Realm was the minimum requirement to have some sway in Eternal Kingdom!

However, he couldn’t rush all of that, and he had to take it one step at a time!

Suddenly, Sword Scroll appeared before Yang Ye and said, “Someone wants to see you. He says he's from the underground trade area in the War Dimension!”

The underground trade area!

Yang Ye frowned slightly, and he left the Primordial Pagoda a moment later. He met a black robed figure in the great hall of the Ancient Sword Sect!

The black robed figure cupped his fist to Yang Ye and said, “Sect Master Ye, we’ve found another one of the people you asked us to search for. However, she's in trouble right now. Our Lord sent me to ask for your opinion.”

Trouble!

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What kind of trouble?”

The black robed figure replied, “Someone is hunting her down!”
