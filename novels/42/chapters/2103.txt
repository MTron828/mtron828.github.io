Chapter 2104 – The Sword Ruins!

The old man remained silent outside the bamboo house for a long time, and then he shook his head, “The world is really changing!”

He'd underestimated the god race!

Not only had all the races underestimated the god race, even Heaven Secret Hall had severely underestimated them. As far as he was concerned, the god race should keep a low profile now, but he hadn’t expected them to do the opposite and even dare to pay Heaven Secret Hall a visit. After all, Heaven Secret Hall had a supreme expert too, the founder of Heaven Secret Hall, the Heaven Secret Progenitor. He was one of the supreme experts in this world.

However, he hadn’t shown himself when the god race had!

Just that allowed the old man to figure out some things.

His ancestor hadn’t been able to take that final step yet!

The old man shook his head and entered the bamboo house.

Around two hours later, a middle aged man in a golden robe with a dragon on it appeared outside the bamboo house.

As soon as the middle aged man appeared there, a spatial ring flew out of the house.

The middle aged man frowned. At the same time, a voice came from within the house, “Yang Ye had a divine treasure that’s concealing him. Even I can’t find him anymore.’

The middle aged man spoke indifferently, “Is the price not high enough?”

“I can’t do it even if you give me 10 million!”

The old man spoke from within the bamboo house, “Sovereign of Man, I can’t locate Yang Ye for now. However, I may be able to locate the god race. I wonder if you’re willing to pay for that information. I think you will be. After all, you don’t want to take a passive stand against them, right?”

The middle aged man in the golden robe was the human race’s Sovereign of Man.

The Sovereign of Man fell silent for a short while, and then he asked, “You know where they are?”

The old man replied, “Not yet. However, I can if I’m willing to pay a certain price.”

The Sovereign of Man lowered his head and thought for a moment, “What do you want?”

The old man asked, ‘What can all of you give me?”

The Sovereign of Man glanced at the bamboo house, “Being too greedy isn’t a good thing!”

The old man said, “Looks like we’re at an impasse.”

The area fell silent.

A long time passed before the Sovereign of Man spoke, “Someone else will be here to discuss it with you. So, are you really unable to locate Yang Ye?”

The old man replied, “I can’t!”

The Sovereign of Man didn’t say another word and just vanished into the distance.

In the bamboo house.

The old man gazed at the woman in a white dress, “Why aren’t all of you joining forces and killing the Sovereign of Man first?”

She replied, “What’s the point of killing a single person? Don’t ask questions from now on. Just do what you should do!”

She closed her eyes once she finished speaking.

…

The Sky Dimension.

Yang Ye was in the Sky Dimension now.

He was being absolutely careful!

Yang Ye snuck into the Sky Dimension. As far as he was concerned, he had to be careful. If someone noticed him, then he would definitely be unable to escape the forces of all the races. Unless he left the large universe and went to the universe beyond the Void Dimension!

Even though the war still hadn’t begun, Yang Ye could still sense how tense it was in the Sky Dimension. However, it had nothing to do with him. The sky race didn’t require his protection, and if he showed himself, the sky race would probably be the first to attack and kill him.

Yang Ye rushed towards the north. A day later, he stopped. He was on an icy mountain, and ice filled his field of vision. Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and continued forward.

Meanwhile, Snowy appeared.

She pointed towards the distance.

Yang Ye asked, “Is there something there?”

She nodded.

Yang Ye asked, “Is it dangerous?”

Snowy thought for a moment and shook her head.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and shot towards the direction she was pointing toward. It didn’t take long for Snowy to signal Yang Ye to stop. Yang Ye stopped immediately, and Snowy leaped down onto the ice.

Snowy sniffed, and then she patted it lightly.

Crack!

The ice cracked open, and then a pure white ball floated out from within.

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

The ball had eyes, a nose, and all other facial features. There were even three tails behind it.

Once it appeared here, its gaze descended upon Snowy, and curiosity filled its eyes. Snowy sized up the little ball before her, and then she suddenly touched it. However, it took just a moment for Snowy to become frozen.

Yang Ye’s expression changed from the sight of this, and he was about to do something when the ice around Snowy suddenly vanished. Snowy cracked a smile at Yang Ye to tell him that there was no need to worry, and then she gazed at the small ball, grabbed its tail, and started moving towards Yang Ye.

Yang Ye felt speechless.

A Sprite!

Yang Ye had a rough guess about what the small ball was.

A Sprite! Moreover, it seemed to be quite a high level Sprite. Since it could freeze Snowy, it was definitely not ordinary. Especially when it had done so instinctively. Yet now, the ball was being pulled over by Snowy, and it wasn’t resisting. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Suddenly, the ball stopped and turned around. At this moment, Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly. He appeared beside Snowy and took her in his arms.

The ice cracked open ahead, and a woman emerged from below it.

She wore a snowy white dress studded with snowflakes, and her hair was snowy white too. However, she wasn’t old. Her appearance was exceptionally exquisite, but she was extremely cold and emotionless.

Vigilance appeared in Yang Ye’s eyes.

A Sage!

She was at least a Sage.

Snowy blinked, and then she gazed at the small ball by the woman’s side. She stretched out her paw and gestured at it. Obviously, she wanted the ball to come with her. Snowy was unhappy, of course. She’d almost taken the little fellow into the Primordial Pagoda with her.

The small ball glanced at Snowy, glanced at the woman, and then became slightly hesitant.

Actually, it really wasn’t against going with Snowy. Or it should be said that it really wanted to get close to Snowy. After all, Snowy was a Sprite Lord, and a Sprite Lord was very attractive to any Sprite in the world.

However, it clearly didn’t want to leave the woman.

Snowy seemed to have noticed the problem too. She gazed at the woman, pointed at the small ball, and pointed at herself. Obviously, she was telling the woman to give the small ball to her.

She just asked for it like it was a matter of course!

Even Yang Ye admired Snowy a little. Only Snowy was capable of asking for something like that!

She glanced at Snowy. In the end, she gazed at Yang Ye, “What are you doing here?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “We noticed this Sprite by chance. However, since it has an owner, we won’t disturb you.”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away with Snowy in his arms.

Snowy glanced at the small ball and was slightly reluctant.

Suddenly, the woman appeared not too far away from Yang Ye, and her gaze descended upon Snowy, “That’s a Sprite Lord!”

Yang Ye’s face fell.

She said, “Come with me, alright?”

Yang Ye’s face darkened quite a bit because she didn’t give him face at all! But it was Snowy’s fault for trying to make her Sprite leave her first!

Snowy gazed at her for a long time, and then she stretched out her paw and waved it.

It was a clear sign of refusal!

The woman seemed even more interested when she saw how Snowy acted like a person, “It comes with lots of benefits.”

Snowy’s eyes lit up when she heard that. Meanwhile, Yang Ye gazed at Snowy. Snowy blinked, and then she glared at the woman and started waving her claws about.

She was saying that she wasn’t that kind of Sprite Lord! Moreover, she glanced at Yang Ye out of the corner of her eye while she did that.

The woman seemed to want to say more, but Yang Ye suddenly said, “Snowy, go inside!”

Snowy nodded and fled into the Primordial Pagoda. The small ball seemed quite reluctant when it saw Snowy vanish.

A Sprite Lord!

If it could be with a Sprite Lord, its cultivation speed would multiply!

Once Snowy returned to the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye glanced at the woman before turning around and walking away. He didn’t want to waste time on her.

Meanwhile, she suddenly appeared before him.

Yang Ye clenched his right hand slowly.

She looked him in the eye, “Leave the Sprite Lord and go!”

Yang Ye chuckled. Just as Little Sky had told him, Snowy’s charm was really great. He’d merely allowed her to stay outside for a while, yet it had gotten him in trouble with a mysterious Sage!

Yang Ye felt quite helpless!

He didn’t waste his breath and just withdrew Elysium, and then he gazed at her, “Let’s just fight!”

Yang Ye’s figure vanished on the spot, and he was in front of her when he appeared again. An instant later, Elysium slammed down at her.

Her eyes narrowed slightly. Obviously, she hadn’t expected Yang Ye to just attack. She waved her hand, and countless snowflakes suddenly appeared here. They were sharp like blades, and they shot down at Yang Ye.

In just an instant, Yang Ye felt piercing coldness and pressure descend upon him.

However, he was filled with the desire to fight. While fighting a Sage on his own was quite strenuous for him right now, it wasn’t that difficult anymore.

“Slash!” Yang Ye howled with fury, and then a wave of powerful energy swept forward. The snowflakes were instantly obliterated, but Yang Ye was blasted backwards repeatedly!

Meanwhile, she suddenly took a step forward and tapped her finger at him. An ethereal sword of ice appeared in front of her, and then it stabbed against Yang Ye’s chest!

Crack!

Yang Ye’s figure was instantly frozen. But that wasn’t the end of it. Countless swords of ice appeared in the surroundings. At the same time, her voice resounded, “Ice Sword Domain!”

As soon as she spoke those words, countless swords of ice instantly enveloped Yang Ye. Moreover, a huge circle of ice appeared in the surroundings, and it revolved incessantly. As it revolved, sword after sword of ice appeared incessantly.

However, her eyes suddenly opened wide, and they were filled with disbelief, “No! What is she doing here?!”
