Chapter 2449 – Dual Swords!

At this moment, Yang Ye finally knew what happened to Sword Scroll’s main body.

Yang Ye glanced at her. Her face was emotionless, and she didn’t say a word before entering the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye looked up at the screen, and it had vanished.

A’Leng asked, “Is there no more?”

Huang Ying nodded, “The records end there. However, you know what happened after that. While our patriarch was strong, the entire desolate would have been buried in that battle if he allowed it to continue. Moreover, a mysterious expert seemed to have stepped forward at that time.”

Yang Ye gazed at him, “A mysterious expert?”

Huang Ying nodded, “However, I don’t know who it was. As for those who do know, they refuse to reveal it.”

Huang Ying shook his head, “Forget that. Brother Yang, Miss A’Leng, let me take you to the Martial Pavilion.”

They nodded.

It didn’t take long for them to get to the Martial Pavilion, and Huang Ying smiled, “Three days! You only have three days! Because my contribution points are only enough for you to stay here for three days!”

A’Leng smiled, “You’re the Crown Prince!”

Huang Ying laughed bitterly, “Besides the patriarch, everyone else has to pay contribution points to access this place, even the Crown Prince! We’re all treated as equals! As for the patriarch, his existence is the greatest contribution to our race! Anyway, I have something to attend to. Brother Yang, Miss A’Leng, take your time and look around. I’m sure the things in there will be of help to you.”

He cupped his fist at them and left.

Yang Ye and A’Leng exchanged glances and entered the pavilion.

Once they parted, Huang Ying went to a mountain in the city.

It was the tallest mountain within the city. Huang Ying didn’t go up to its top, and he just stopped at the mountainside and bowed slightly.

A long time passed before a drop of blood floated down from above and descended before him.

Huang Ying hurriedly withdrew the violet command token from before, and the blood entered it. The command token trembled slightly, and then it turned red!

A protection talisman!

If he wanted to truly become the Crown Prince, he needed a person’s acknowledgement, and that person was the Desolate Emperor!

Now, the Desolate Emperor had clearly acknowledged him.

Huang Ying bowed slightly toward the mountain and was about to leave, but a wave of energy suddenly enveloped him and brought him to the mountain top.

A man with hair that hung loosely to his shoulders was seated just a few meters away from Huang Ying.

Huang Ying naturally knew who it was, so he immediately bowed respectfully, “Patriarch!”

It was the Desolate Emperor!

A short while passed before the Desolate Emperor spoke, “Do you know why I wanted to choose a Crown Prince?”

Huang Ying shook his head, “Please enlighten me!”

The man stood up and looked into the distant sky, “My desolate race lost the battle all those years ago. I led our race away in retreat to rest and recuperate. Now, you’re all definitely thinking that we’re going to attack Eternal Kingdom again, right?”

Huang Ying hesitated for a moment and asked, “Aren’t we?”

The Desolate Emperor spoke softly, “War is unavoidable. But this time, we don’t hold the initiative anymore, and Eternal Kingdom isn’t the same Eternal Kingdom we once faced either. Of course, it’s normal because if even that war wasn’t able to wake them up, then they would truly be trash! I’ll leave the internal affairs of our desolate race to you. You aren’t capable enough to deal with the external affairs, so just leave it to me. Besides that, befriending Yang Ye was a bold move. My desolate race needs someone bold. As for strength, it doesn’t matter if yours is slightly inferior, it can be trained slowly. But a patriarch must be bold and willing to take risks. So, your eldest brother and Huang Ye are inferior in that aspect!”

Huang Ying bowed slightly to the Desolate Emperor and remained silent.

The Desolate Emperor waved his hand lightly.

Huang Ying bowed once more and left.

Once Huang Ying left, a middle aged man without any limbs appeared before the Desolate Emperor!

If Yang Ye was here, he would recognize the man.

It was the original owner of Executor!

The Desolate Emperor glanced at the man, “What’s your name?”

The man spoke softly, “They call me the Obsessed Sword! As for my original name, Chen Xuanan!”

The Desolate Emperor asked, “Yang Ye is your disciple?”

Chen Xuanan shook his head, “Not really. But I Like him.”

The Desolate Emperor said, “He shows no restraint. Even though he’s learning to restrain himself, he’s still like that deep within his bones.”

Chen Xuanan smiled, “The young wouldn’t be called the young if they weren’t like that, right? We were probably worse than him during our youths. Don’t you think so too?”

The Desolate Emperor nodded slightly, “True.”

As he spoke, he looked up at the sky, “While you’re dead, I can still sense how strong you once were. Is it really that strong?”

Chen Xuanan smiled, “It’s much stronger than you’ve imagined!”

The Desolate Emperor fell silent for a long time and said, “Which era are you from?”

Chen Xuanan replied, “The Primordial!”

Primordial!

Fluctuations arose in the Desolate Emperor’s eyes, “A forgotten era!”

Chen Xuanan shook his head slightly, “It doesn’t matter to any of us.”

He gazed at the Desolate Emperor and continued, “Thank you!”

He was thanking the Desolate Emperor on Yang Ye’s behalf. Because the desolate race had given up on the Sprite Progenitor! It could be said that if the Desolate Emperor insisted on obtaining the Sprite Progenitor, then even he wouldn’t be able to stop the Desolate Emperor. After all, he was dead. Of course, he wasn’t without any remedy. He couldn’t stop the Desolate Emperor in his current state, but besides the Desolate Emperor, no one else in the desolate race was a match for him!

Moreover, Yang Ye had Wu Ni and the Martial Ancestor too.

While the three of them were dead, even if their joint forces weren't enough to annihilate the desolate race, crippling it wouldn’t be difficult at all!

The Desolate Emperor was clearly aware of that. While he wasn’t afraid of them, he felt that it wasn’t necessary.

After all, wasn’t it better to have more friends instead of making more powerful enemies?

Chen Xuanan didn’t speak further. He just turned around and left. Meanwhile, the Desolate Emperor suddenly said, “A clone of mine encountered a sword cultivator in the Primal Battlefield, he was a very powerful sword cultivator!”

Chen Xuanan stopped and said, “We’ve met.”

The Desolate Emperor asked, “What do you think of him?”

Chen Xuanan smiled, “You want to know who’s stronger, right?”

The Desolate Emperro nodded.

Chen Xuanan smiled, “Actually, I want to know the answer to that too. Unfortunately, we’re not from the same era.”

He vanished without a trace once he finished speaking.

A long time passed before the Desolate Emperor vanished as well.

The mountain top was quiet once more.

…

The Martial Pavilion.

Once they entered the Martial Pavilion, they noticed that it was much larger than they’d expected. The tiny pavilion actually seemed to have another world within it. But they were puzzled by the fact that no one seemed to be guarding the place, and there were no experts outside the pavilion.

A’Leng spoke softly, “The desolate race isn’t ordinary at all!”

Yang Ye nodded. He’d seen many clans and races since he started his journey on Profounder Continent, but the desolate race was the most unique. Of course, it was also the strongest.

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something and said, “Miss A’Leng, about the Di Clan…”

She smiled, “What is it?”

Yang Ye said, “Let me know if you need my help.”

She smiled, “Thank you!”

Yang Ye nodded. He didn’t say anything else and just walked off. She glanced at him, didn’t say anything either, and walked to a nearby bookshelf!Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

There were around 10 bookshelves here, and every single one of them had 10 shelves. Every shelf had around 10 scrolls.

All of them were scrolls with supreme knowledge of the martial arts!

Not a single one of them was of low quality.

It could be said that it was Huang Ying’s way of repaying them.

Yang Ye summoned An Nanjing, and she glanced at the surroundings before casually picking up a scroll. She was instantly immersed in it once she took a glance at its contents.

Yang Ye immediately realized that the scrolls here were rare treasures. Otherwise, based on how selective she was, ordinary techniques would just incur her disdain. But she had been able to continue reading a scroll he casually picked up. So, it was obvious how high quality the scrolls here were.

Yang Ye ignored her and walked to the side. It didn’t take long for him to arrive before a bookshelf, and on it was a pitch black character ‘剑’.

Obviously, the scrolls in this bookshelf were sword techniques!

Yang Ye opened one of them, and a few words appeared before him—Dual Swords!

Dual Swords? Yang Ye was stunned. What the heck?

Yang Ye was curious and decided to continue reading, and a solemn expression gradually appeared on his face. He read through it for around two hours, and then he put it down and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Dual Swords!

Wild joy covered Yang Ye’s face.

Because he’d suddenly thought of something!

His Madness Sword Technique. It allowed him to swing 100 times in a breath of time, but what if he used dual swords?

Would its strength multiply?

Was it realistic?

Yang Ye didn’t know, but he planned to find out! In any case, he has no lack of swords!

Yang Ye didn’t use Executor. He placed it within the Sword Gourd and picked up the Sword Precursor and Sword Supreme instead!

His intuition told him that these two swords were more suitable!

The scroll he read had a detailed description on how to wield dual swords, and it included many techniques and skills as well. Yang Ye didn’t follow exactly what was recorded in the scroll. Simply speaking, he was using that technique to perfect his Madness Sword Technique!
