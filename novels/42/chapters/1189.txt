Chapter 1190 – We Should Destroy Everything In Our Path!

All of them were still in a state of shock, even Qin Zhuyao.

Void Rank sword intent wasn’t on the same level as Quasi Void Rank sword intent at all. Sword cultivators could absorb the sword intent of weaker opponents. In other words, all of them who possessed Quasi Void Rank sword intent were no threat to Dugu Jian. Unless they didn’t utilize sword intent and sword energy. But if a sword cultivator didn’t utilize that, then would that person still be a sword cultivator?

We’ve lost!

That was the thought which arose in their minds.

Dugu Jian looked down at them all while a smile curled up on the corners of his mouth, “All of you didn’t believe me when I said you were weak. Now, you believe me, right?”

As he spoke, he turned around to look at the peak of the mountain, and his eyes burned with desire, “I told all of you that Jian Wuji reigned supreme throughout the continent tens of thousands of years ago. Now, it belongs to me, Dugu Jian!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The others fell silent. Because his strength was clearly visible to them, so it was pointless to try and refute it.

Meanwhile, Dugu Jian suddenly gazed at Huan Kong and the others, “Shouldn’t all of you fulfil the terms of the bet before I ascend to the peak? Go on and kneel!”

Huan Kong and the others revealed extremely unsightly expressions on their faces.

Dugu Jian said, “Are all of you going to go back on your word?”

“Actually, there’s nothing great about Void Rank sword intent,” Suddenly, a voice resounded.

All of them were stunned, and then turned around to look at Yang Ye because he was the one who’d spoke.

Yang Ye glanced at them, and then he started walking towards Dugu Jian, “It’s just Void Rank sword intent. Why can’t you be a little humble? You make it seem like Void Rank sword intent is invincible.” He wasn’t trying to put on airs. But as far as he was concerned, Void Rank sword intent really wasn’t great.

Because he’d seen too many experts who were much stronger!

Dugu Jian suddenly pointed a finger at Yang Ye and laughed, “You finally weren’t able to restrain yourself? I noticed you earlier. Besides that woman, you’re the strongest here. But you concealed your strength.”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “I didn’t conceal my strength. You were just too weak to discern it.”

Dugu Jian is weak!

Clamorous noise resounded through the area as the others gazed at Yang Ye with disbelief. Dugu Jian possesses Void Rank sword intent!

If Dugu Jian who’d comprehended Void Rank sword intent was weak, then what were they?

Hua Kong gulped, and then he asked Lin Fan in a soft voice, “Ice Face, is he talking big?”

Lin Fan glanced at Yang Ye and said, “It doesn’t seem like it. Either he’s the shit or he’s talking shit!

“I asked for nothing!” Huan Kong rolled his eyes and gazed at Yang Ye again.

“HAHAHA!” Meanwhile, Dugu Jian suddenly roared with laughter, and he laughed for a while before he looked at Yang Ye, “You know... what you said just now is the most laughable joke I’ve ever heard. It’s really so funny that I still want to laugh at it. Hahahaha!”

Yang Ye was quite speechless as he watched Dugu Jian roar madly with laughter. He shook his head and said, “Let’s put that aside for now. The competition between you and us isn’t over. So, it’s too early to tell us to kneel before you.”

“Looks like you want to be their savior!” Dugu Jian beckoned to Yang Ye, “Then come up here!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he leaped up and descended not too far away from Dugu Jian. Right when the others thought that Yang Ye would be struck down, Yang Ye shrugged at Dugu Jian and said, “See, I’m here.”

All the others were speechless.

Dugu Jian’s smile vanished, and he gazed at Yang Ye for a short while before he said, “You possess Void Rank sword intent!”

Void Rank sword intent!

Clamorous noise resounded once more. Void Rank sword intent again!

All of them were sword cultivators, so they were naturally aware of how difficult it was to attain Void Rank sword intent. It could be said that amongst the sword cultivators of the continent, they’d only heard of 1 and seen 2 who possessed Void Rank sword intent. The 2 they’d seen were standing in front of them, and the person they’d heard of was naturally Yang Ye.

But they didn’t know that Yang Ye was right in front of them!

Yang Ye paid no attention to Dugu Jian, and he just turned around to look at the others who were below him, “Is Void Rank sword intent that great?”

Yang Ye didn’t wait for their answer. He immediately pointed his right index finger at Godfall Mountain and said, “No, Void Rank sword intent isn’t great at all. See that? Even Jian Wuji who’d attained such a level of sword intent was still killed. So, do you think Void Rank sword intent is great?”

All of them fell silent.

Meanwhile, Dugu Jian was about to speak. But Yang Ye suddenly gazed at him and said, “Shut up for now. I’ll speak with you in a moment.”

“How dare you!” Dugu Jian was furious. After all, when had he ever suffered such humiliation?

Suddenly, Yang Ye pressed his index and middle fingers together to form a sword, and then he waved his hand in Dugu Jian’s direction. A ray of sword energy shot forward.

Dugu Jian’s expression changed. He hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually dare to attack him here. But while he’d been caught off guard, his reaction wasn’t slow at all. He immediately pressed his fingers together and waved his hand forward as well. A ray of sword energy shot forward and collided with Yang Ye’s sword energy.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then Dugu Jian was pushed around 30m back! Dugu Jian looked up at Yang Ye while a trace of shock could be seen in his eyes. He hadn’t expected that he would have been pushed back by a sword cultivator.

The others on the foot of the mountain were stunned as well, and then they shot gazes that carried shock and curiosity at Yang Ye. However, their gazes carried a trace of rage as well.

“You actually attacked someone here!” One of them sword cultivators spoke with slight anger. The Godfall Ruins was a restricted area in the hearts of everyone throughout the continent. Especially sword cultivators like them. So, no expert would fight here. As for sword cultivators, they would absolutely not fight here. Because as far as they were concerned, fighting here would be a form of disrespect to Jian Wuji!

Yang Ye paid no attention to that fellow. He turned around to glance at Dugu Jian who was about to attack instead, “You want to attack? Sure! But you have to wait. I have some thoughts that I want to share, so wait for me to be done before we deal with the matter between us. I’m warning you, if you dare to interrupt me, then I’ll definitely bash you up so badly that even your parents won’t be able to recognize you.”

Dugu Jian’s face was unsightly. He laughed coldly and said, “Go on, I’ll let you speak. I, Dugu Jian, am not someone who doesn’t let his opponent speak his last words.”

Yang Ye ignored Dugu Jian and looked at Qin Zhuyao’s group instead, “I understand why all of you are very angry that I attacked him here. It’s because all of you respect Jian Wuji, and he is worthy of respect. But I’d like to tell all of you that you aren’t respecting him, you’re revering him!”

Huan Kong asked, “Is there any difference?”

“Of course!” Yang Ye replied, “All of you revere him and treat him like a god. You unconsciously feel that you’ll never be able to arrive at the same height as him, or perhaps all of you think that becoming on par with him is sufficient. In your hearts, he’s a mountain, a mountain you can’t climb over. Right?”

Huan Kong asked another question, “Is that a problem?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course it is. Let me tell all of you something. If you have a mountain that’s impossible to climb over in your heart, then your accomplishments will never go further!”

At this point, Yang Ye suddenly pointed at Dugu Jian and said, “Do you know why he was able to attain Void Rank sword intent? Do you know why he’s stronger than all of you?”

All of them remained silent.

Dugu Jian glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent.

Yang Ye said, “As far as I’m concerned, the difference between all of you and him is that he never treated Jian Wuji as a god. He’s always thinking that Jian Wuji is nothing, and that he will definitely surpass Jian Wuji. Even though he’s confident or even conceited, he doesn’t think of himself as being inferior. In his heart, Jian Wuji isn’t a mountain which is impossible to climb over, Jian Wuji is just a stepping stone for him! But what about all of you?”

All of them were speechless.

Dugu Jian glanced at Yang Ye and still didn’t speak.

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “Sword cultivators should be without fear. If all of you harbor fear in your hearts, then how will you ascend to the peak of the Sword Dao?”

All of them still remained silent. But many had clenched their fists, and so had Qin Zhuyao.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “We can respect people, the heavens, and the earth. However, we can’t fear people, the heavens, or the earth! So long as sword cultivators have a sword in their hand, they should fear nothing. So long as anyone or anything dares to obstruct our path, we destroy it all!”

All of them still remained silent, but many of their eyes had emotions that had never appeared there in the past.

Yang Ye pointed at the peak of Godfall Mountain and said, “He sacrificed himself for the continent, and we should respect him. But we shouldn’t allow him to become an inner demon of ours. Since he could be that strong, then why can’t we? We’re all human, so is anyone inferior to another? Do all of you think that you’re inferior? In any case, I don’t think I’m inferior. In my heart, I’m a man who will surpass him one day!”

“Well said!” Meanwhile, Lin Fan suddenly gazed at Yang Ye and said, “You’re right. Many of us were trapped by our own inner demons for many years. Unfortunately, we never realized it. Sword cultivators should fear nothing, yet we are still fearful of a person who died a few tens of thousands of years ago. How could we possibly attain Void Rank sword intent with such a state of mind?”

“Right!” Huan Kong added, “I really wasted the past few years. Motherfucker! I was wondering why I couldn’t attain Void Rank sword intent, so this was why. If I figured it out a while earlier, I would have probably surpassed the Void Rank by now!”

Lin Fan glared at Huan Kong, “Will you die if you don’t talk big?”

The others immediately grinned when they heard him.

Yang Ye smiled as well. He didn’t waste another breath and immediately turned to look at Dugu Jian, “Didn’t you want to compete? Now, let’s compete.”

Dugu Jian refused to show any weakness, “How?”

Yang Ye looked up at Godfall Mountain, “See who can go further, alright?”

Dugu Jian asked, “Will the wager remain the same?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Dugu Jian said, “Let’s begin?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Let’s begin!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye and Dugu Jian’s figures shot towards the peak.

After that, all of the spectators were stunned on the spot.
