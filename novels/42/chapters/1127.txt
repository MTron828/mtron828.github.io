Chapter 1128 – Prepare For Battle!

Elder Ren was annihilated in an instant, and only the other remaining experts of the Law Faction and Gu Yuncheng remained frozen on the spot. However, their reactions weren’t slow at all, and it didn’t take long for them to recover from their shock. They didn’t swarm Yang Ye right away, and they chose to turn around and fled madly towards the distance.

What a joke! Elder Ren was the strongest amongst them, yet he’d been killed in an instant. So, how could they possibly stand a chance against Yang Ye?

They instantly appeared far away while fleeing with all their might, but such speed was no different than the speed of a tortoise to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and then less than 3 breaths of time passed before he returned to where he’d been standing earlier. At the same time, over a dozen heads fell to the ground beneath his feet. It was the heads of those experts and Gu Yuncheng.

The expressions of all the students here changed at the sight of this.

They’d heard about Yang Ye, and some had even witnessed his strength during the competition with the Law Fact. However, they hadn’t expected him to be strong to such an extent!

After all, those Saints didn’t even have the strength to fight back against him!

Actually, while Yang Ye was a Half-Saint, his physical strength was comparable to a Quasi Emperor. So, his strength couldn’t be judged based on his realm of cultivation at all. Of course, how could anyone have expected Yang Ye’s body to be at the Divine Shift Realm? After all, he was a sword cultivator and not a body cultivator!

It was exactly why many weren’t able to estimate his strength well in battle, and it made them underestimate him.

So, while he hadn’t attained the Saint Realm, it was beneficial to Yang Ye because he could trick his opponents. He could make them underestimate his strength or even look down upon it. Of course, he couldn’t just leave his cultivation at its current realm. His realm of cultivation was his foundation, and it was necessary for him to charge into the Saint Realm. After all, his strength would definitely rise tremendously once he attained the Saint Realm.

However, he definitely couldn’t charge into the Saint Realm until the danger White Deer Academy faced was resolved. Moreover, Lady had said that his foundation wasn’t stable, and he had to resolve that problem as well.

Meanwhile, Zi Nan interrupted Yang Ye’s thoughts, “Are we heading back right now?”

Yang Ye gazed at them and said, “Besides all of you, there are around 2,000 more students outside the academy, and all of them are waiting for us to rescue them. Many of them might die if we return right now. So, I’ve decided to gather all of them before taking all of you back at once.”

Even though it was slightly risky, he had no other choice. Because if he took this group back, then it would definitely alarm the enemy forces in White Deer Dimension. At that time, it would be difficult for him to leave again and save the others. Besides that, it would definitely waste a lot of time to head back and return to get the remaining students. Perhaps countless would die at the hands of the Mo Clan, Thousand Crane Sect, and Law Faction during that period.

Zi Nan nodded lightly, “You’re right. If we head back now, then many of those students who’re left behind will definitely die at the hands of our enemies. They are definitely waiting for us to save them.” She gazed at the others at this point and said, “Does anyone object to our decision to save the others first?”

They immediately shook their heads. They’d experienced how it felt, and they knew that many were definitely on the verge of despair!

Zi Nan gazed at Yang Ye, and then he nodded, “Since no one has any objections, then get on the Imperial Cloud Shuttle!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye waved his hand and the cloud shuttle which was hidden at the side appeared before them. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“An Imperial Cloud Shuttle!” Zi Nan cried out involuntarily with shock.

Yang Ye glanced at her with surprise, “You recognize that thing?”

She glanced at him and nodded, “It’s truly surprising that you were actually able to obtain a thing like that. Our chances of returning safely are at least at 60 or 70% with it. Alright, let’s not waste more time and set out right away.” She immediately led the others up the cloud shuttle.

Yang Ye glanced at her and flashed into the cloud shuttle as well.

It didn’t take long for it to vanish on the spot.

An Imperial Cloud Shuttle was unlike ordinary Cloud Shuttles. It had a violet barrier of light surrounding it as it flew at high speeds, so those within it wouldn’t be affected by its speed at all.

Zi Nan asked, “Where are the others?”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “They are in a city called Southwind City that’s around 50,000km from us. There are around 100 plus of them there. As for the rest.... In short, it’s troublesome.” It really was troublesome because the students weren’t gathered in the same spot and were scattered all around. So, it was absolutely troublesome for him.

“We’ll be wasting too much time by trying to save them like this!” Meanwhile, Qiu Yuan suddenly walked over to them.

Yang Ye gazed at Qiu Yuan, “You have an idea?”

“Notify all of them to gather at a single place.” Qiu Yuan spoke solemnly, “In that way, we can save a huge amount of time, and we can lower the amount of danger they face. After all, the longer they stay outside, the more might die.”

“That won’t do!” Zi Nan objected, “The reason many are still alive is because they are in hiding. If they are exposed, then it’ll be even more dangerous for them.”

Qiu Yuan suddenly asked, “How many experts have the Mo Clan, Thousand Crane Sect, and Law Factions sent to hunt and kill us?”

Zi Nan asked, “What are you trying to say?”

Qiu Yuan replied, “The reason they’ve been able to slaughter us isn’t because they have numerous forces on their side, it’s because they dispatched their elites and elders. However, all our elites and elders are being forced to stay within White Deer City. So, we students are practically incapable of fighting back against them. Thus, according to my estimations, they’ve dispatched no more than 200 high-rank Saints to hunt and kill us.”

Qiu Yuan paused for a moment at this point and continued, “But we have around 2,000 students out here. They are scattered all around. So, if they are to expose themselves at once and rush towards the point that we set, then even if the experts of the Mo Clan, Law Faction, and Thousand Crane Sect want to kill them, they’ll only be able to succeed at killing a portion of them. After all, they don’t have enough forces!”

Zi Nan remained silent for a long time before she spoke solemnly, “Some will still die!”

Qiu Yuan replied, “But even more will die if we don’t do that. Moreover, many are definitely on the verge of collapse right now. Perhaps there’ll be no need for our enemies to kill them before their minds collapse themselves, and then act like fools!”

Zi Nan sighed softly and gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye looked at Qiu Yuan, and the latter gazed at him and said, “It’s the best plan we have right now. But it has a lethal flaw.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Once those students aren’t able to endure their fear of death and surrender, then our decision might have caused the deaths of everyone, right?”

Qiu Yuan nodded, “We intend to converge them all and take them back to the academy. But if the Mo Clan and the others find out, then they’ll definitely set up an ambush at the point we’re converging at. At that time, the slightest mishap might result in us digging our own graves. So, if we carry out this plan, then are you confident in your ability to face the experts of those 3 powers? There might... there might even be a Quasi Emperor amongst them! Moreover, there might be more than one!”

Yang Ye flicked a ray of white light into the center of Qiu Yuan’s forehead, “These are the locations, information, and methods of contact that Elder Su gave me. Send them voice transmissions and tell them to gather at Southwind City. They can live if they get there, and their fates will depend on their own fortune.”

Just as Zi Nan had said, it was impossible for them to head to every single hiding spot and rescue those students. It was too dangerous. It wasn’t dangerous for Yang Ye but those students instead. After all, they were hiding all over the Central Divine Prefecture, and if he were to travel to every single place and rescue them, then it would probably take a few days at the very least.

Anything could happen in that amount of time!

It would save a huge amount of time if he made them gather at Southwind City. With the strength and speed those students possessed, it would take a day at most for all of them to arrive at Southwind City!

Qiu Yuan gazed at Yang Ye and asked, “Are you really confident in this plan?”

Yang Ye replied with a question, “Can you place your confidence in anyone else but me?”

Qiu Yuan gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then he nodded and left.

Once Qiu Yuan left, Zi Nan asked the same question again, “Are you really confident?”

Yang Ye rolled his eyes and said, “Besides this plan, do we have any better plans right now? Besides that, can you place your trust in anyone else but me right now?”

Zi Nan spoke seriously, “But if you’re not confident, then all of us might be annihilated there!”

Yang Ye replied with a question, “Then what do you think we should do?”

Zi Nan thought for a while before she replied, “I don’t have any ideas.”

Yang Ye said, “Doesn’t that answer your question? Alright, stop allowing this question to trouble you. Go back to your room and rest well. Perhaps we might really have to fight an intense battle!”

Zi Nan glanced at Yang Ye, and then she nodded and left.

...

15 minutes later.

All the students that were in hiding received Qiu Yuan’s transmission, left their hiding places, and started traveling to Southwind City.
