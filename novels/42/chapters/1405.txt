Chapter 1406 – Because She Would Be Dead!

𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Was she being selfish?

Some felt that she was absolutely selfish. After all, she just had to agree, and the war could be avoided.

As far as they were concerned, it was very worth it to sacrifice one for the good of all. Moreover, they felt that regardless of whether she married into Wildlands Stellar Region or the Celestial Demon Lord, it wasn’t a sacrifice. Because regardless of whether it was the residents of Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region or Zhuang Weiran’s own parents, all of them were resentful because she kept refusing.

However, all of them and even her parents had never tried to think about it in her shoes.

She was a proud person. As far as she was concerned, marrying someone to save the stellar region wasn’t just a disgrace to her, it was a disgrace for the entire Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region, and it was a pathetic thing to do.

Wasn’t it pathetic to use a woman to gain peace?

Moreover, her own belief in the path of cultivation was to die rather than live in disgrace. Once she agreed, then it represented that she would be going against that belief of hers!

How severe was it if one’s beliefs collapsed?

Simply speaking, it was impossible for that person to improve further in their lifetime.

Zhuang Weiran didn’t want to suffer disgrace or be pathetic, but the residents of Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region and her own parents were forcing her to.

In the end, she’d chosen to ignite her soul and fight one last time for her stellar region.

Regardless of what the outcome was, it wouldn’t be important.

Because she would be dead.

The others here were shocked when they saw her ignite her soul, and even the Demon Lord and his forces were shocked. They hadn’t expected her to act so resolutely and ignite her soul!

Suddenly, Fen Cangyan appeared on the city wall and immediately went over to Zhuang Weiran’s side. He spoke anxiously, “Young Miss, stop right now. I’ve received news from a mysterious person that Yang Ye and 3 other mysterious Deities have breached Celestial Demon Continent. At this moment, Yang Ye is slaughtering the entire city! We’ve destroyed their base!”

Everyone here was stunned!

Zhuang Weiran frowned slightly while the flames she emanated were gradually extinguished. She stared fixedly at Fen Cangyan and asked, “Are you sure?”

Fen Cangyan hurriedly replied, “Absolutely!”

Zhuang Weiran looked up into the sky and said, “Are you telling me that I’m not fighting alone?”

Fen Cangyan heaved a sigh of relief when he saw her stop. He’d really been horrified just now. Because if that madman, Yang Ye, found out that Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region had forced her to ignite her soul and die, then Yang Ye would definitely aim his sword at everyone in Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region!

Yang Ye would definitely annihilate everyone here!

He didn’t doubt that at all!

Fortunately, the news had arrived in time. Actually, he wasn’t sure if it was true, but he couldn’t be bothered about that. It was fine so long as she didn’t ignite her soul!

Suddenly, the space before the Demon Lord trembled, and it didn’t take long for his face to turn gloomy. His gaze descended onto Zhuang Weiran as he said, “I never expected you to have a backup plan. I’m really quite curious. Who is it that dares to help you at a time like this.”

Zhuang Weiran paid no attention to the Demon Lord. She gazed at the others from her stellar region, “If you don’t choose to fight, then choose death!” After she found out that Yang Ye was fighting on Celestial Demon Stellar Region, she had no further tolerance for these people from her stellar region.

Of course, she wouldn’t choose to surrender or agree to their marriage proposals now. Because wouldn’t she be hurting Yang Ye by doing that? Moreover, if the people of her stellar region still had such thoughts, then it would be equivalent to trying to hurt Yang Ye, and she would absolutely not allow that!

“Weiran!”

Meanwhile, Zhuang Weitian seemed to intend to say something, but she interrupted him, “He hasn’t betrayed me, so I definitely won’t betray him. If you want me to marry someone to gain peace, then I’ll leave right now. I’ll head to Celestial Demon Continent to fight by his side!”

Why was Yang Ye there? It was because of her.

There was no enmity between Yang Ye and Celestial Demon Stellar Region. Yang Ye didn’t have to get swept into this conflict, but he’d charged in without hesitation because of her.

So if she were to choose to marry the Demon Lord now, then wouldn’t it be like betraying Yang Ye?

Zhuang Weitian and the beautiful woman exchanged glances. In the end, Zhuang Weitian spoke solemnly, “We’ll do as you say.”

She was the pillar of support for their stellar region, and she was its future. If she abandoned Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region, Zhuang Weitian and Qian Yaochan didn’t dare think about the consequences. That was the main reason why they hadn’t dared to make her marry into Wildlands Stellar Region or Celestial Demon Stellar Region. Zhuang Weiran possessed formidable strength, so unless she did so willingly, no one could force her to do anything!

She nodded, and then she turned to look at the Demon Lord, “Celestial Demon Lord, if you want to fight, then let’s fight!”

The Demon Lord stared fixedly at her.

Meanwhile, an old man by the Demon Lord’s side said, “Demon Lord, should we send some of our forces back?” Celestial Demon Continent was the main world of their stellar region. If anything were to happen to it, then the consequences would be very severe.

The Demon Lord shook his head and said, “It’s fine. If the continent is gone, then this continent will be our main continent.’

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand and said, “Attack! Leave no one alive.”

The forces behind him immediately dived down towards the city.

Meanwhile, Zhuang Weiran grasped her halberd tightly and said, “Activate the formations! Fight until your last breaths!”

Bang!

As soon as she finished speaking, a ray of dazzling golden light suddenly shot up into the sky, and then almost 150 golden figures that held spears appeared in the sky. They weren’t real people but were energy condensed into human form. But even then, they were all at the Semi-Deity Realm.

150 Semi-Deities!

At the same time, beams of energy were ceaselessly shooting up from the city and surging into the golden figures. The golden figures grew more and more solid as the energy surged into them, and their auras grew stronger as well. They became even stronger than those Semi-Deities who were charging towards Clouds of Heaven City!

Besides the golden figures, there were 2 violet figures that emanated a violet glow standing before the golden figures.

Those violet figures made out of energy were Deities!

It was the Wargod Formation!

It was a formation that Zhuang Weitian had obtained when he obtained the Wargod’s inheritance all those years ago, and it was Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region’s final line of defense. The formation was exactly why Celestial Demon Stellar Region had left Clouds of Heaven Continent as the last world to attack.

The formation could only be activated once in 30 years because it exhausted too many divine crystals. Just activating it once exhausted all the divine crystals that Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region had!

“The Wargod Formation?” A cold smile curled up on the corners of the Demon Lord’s mouth. He flipped his right hand slightly before pressing his palms together and pulling them apart. A huge hold was instantly torn open in the space before him.

Roar! Roar!

Suddenly, two furious roars resounded from within the black hole, and then the space and ground in a huge area started to quake like an earthquake was rumbling through it.

It didn’t take long for two completely black and wolf shaped colossi to appear in the sky above the city.

They looked exactly the same. They looked like wolves, were completely pitch black, and had eyes that were as large as an adult’s head. Their eyes were dark too and simply seemed like two black balls. As for their appearance, it was vicious. They had a pair of extremely sharp and long fangs, and even space was instantly sliced apart along with every slight movement they made!

Besides that, both of them had very long fur, and it was so long that their fur could sweep the ground.

Zhuang Weitian and the others had solemn expressions on their faces when they saw those colossi. Even Zhuang Weiran had a trace of seriousness in her eyes.

Celestial Demon Wolves!

Ominous beasts!

True ominous beasts!

Since time immemorial, there have been auspicious beasts in this universe like the spatial mink, Qilin, and various others. Since there were auspicious beasts, there were ominous beasts as well. The Celestial Demon Wolves were such ominous beasts of this universe!

They were ominous beasts that instilled horror in others.

Zhuang Weiran had an extremely solemn expression on her face. Those beasts were comparable to peak Deities, so she naturally didn’t dare act careless at all.

The Demon Lord spoke indifferently, “Celestial Demon Wolves, don’t both of you like to eat? Kill those fellows down there and you can eat everyone on this continent.”

Roar! Roar!

A ferocious glow instantly surged within their eyes, and then they roared with fury and charged down towards the city.

Meanwhile, Zhuang Weiran flipped her palm and transformed into a beam of white light that shot up into the sky.

The battle began!

...

Celestial Demon Stellar Region. Celestial Demon City.

“AHHHH!” Numerous shrill cries were resounding from the city.

At this moment, the entire city was covered in corpses while blood flowed like rivers through the streets. Besides that, a thin layer of blood red mist covered the sky. It was a mist of blood that had been formed because of the abundance of blood here!

After Yang Ye’s group of four attacked the city, they were instantly besieged by all the experts of Celestial Demon Continent. Obviously, it was much stronger than Skyriver Continent, and it was much more orderly as well. So, once they found out that Yang Ye’s group had invaded their continent, all the experts in the city and in the vicinity had rushed over, and countless people started to besiege them!

In the beginning, the experts of Celestial Demon Continent were filled with the spirit to fight, but it didn’t take long for fear to start appearing in them.

Once the only Deity in the city was killed by the joint forces of Yang Ye’s group, no one on the continent could stop them.

It was a slaughter!

An insane slaughter!

Especially Yang Ye. Yang Ye was clearly immersed in the slaughter. He killed everyone on sight, and countless streams of blood surged incessantly into Heaven’s Gravestone and the Heart of Slaughter within him. This made Yang Ye seem like he was made of blood. Actually, he didn’t seem like it, he was actually covered in blood.

Heaven’s Gravestone wanted to absorb all the blood, but there was too much. So, a huge amount of it was absorbed by the Heart of Slaughter within Yang Ye.

Corpses covered the ground and blood flowed into rivers! It was hell on earth!

That was a true description of the current state in the city!

After a long time passed.

Bang!

A pillar of blood shot up into the sky, and then the entire sky turned blood red!

At the same time, a wave of terrifying slaughter intent appeared out of thin air in the sky above the city, and then the slaughter intent extended to every corner of the city!

In an instant, the entire city was covered in blood red mist. Some comparatively weaker cultivators were instantly corrupted by the slaughter intent and became machines of slaughter.

Rebirth Rank slaughter intent!

Someone had attained Rebirth Rank slaughter intent, and it was still growing stronger at an extremely terrifying rate!

It didn’t take long for Elder Yuan and the others to stop, and then they looked in Yang Ye’s direction while astonishment filled their eyes. Because that slaughter intent could even corrupt them!

However, the slaughter intent was still growing stronger and stronger!
