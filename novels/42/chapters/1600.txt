Chapter 1601 - What A Familiar Bloodline!

Translator: InVader

A woman appeared in the sky.

It was Sky Maiden!

Little Sky’s face instantly became cold when she saw that huge mouth swallow an Eye of the Heaven Dao. After that, she was about to wave her hand. However, Yang Ye suddenly grabbed her hand and shook her head.

Little Sky glanced at Yang Ye and didn’t say a word.

Yang Ye nodded to her, and then his figure flashed over to Sky Maiden.

Sky Maiden glanced at Yang Ye with an emotionless expression on her face.

Yang Ye glanced at Sky Maiden, “You’re Yin’yin, right?” That huge mouth was naturally not new to him. Yin’yin had used that exact same method to devour things in the past.

Sky Maiden replied, “What difference does it make?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short moment, and then he answered, “You hadn’t awakened your memories then, right?”

Sky Maiden looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Yes!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand now. You’re not the Yin’yin I knew.”

She glanced down at Sky Sky Continent and said, “You’ve been kind to us sisters, so let me give you some advice. Leave this place.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Can you not act against Little Sky?”

Sky Maiden gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before she said, “No!”

Yang Ye flipped his palm and the Sword Precursor appeared in his grasp. At the same time, he immediately activated the Sword God’s Seal and the energy of the Demon God. His sword intent immediately rose to the Returnal Rank. At the same time, a layer of faint golden light covered his entire body!

Sky Maiden gazed at Yang Ye, “You’re no match for him. At the very least, that’s the case for now.”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he gazed at the armored woman, “Your Nether Pavilion took a liking to Merak System, so you want it to surrender. I have to say that all of you are really overbearing.”

The armored woman spoke coldly, “It’s a dog eat dog world!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand that.” He gazed at Sky Maiden, “I consider all ten of you to be very good friends of mine. But this time, I chose Little Sky’s side.”

Suddenly, the armored woman gazed at Sky Maiden, “Kill him!”

Sky Maiden glanced at her, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “This is your last chance. If you leave, I guarantee that the Nether Pavilion won’t target you or your loved ones.”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Little Sky suddenly said, “Go.”

Yang Ye gazed at Little Sky. The latter spoke softly, “Fool! Protecting this world is my responsibility. It has nothing to do with you. Go on. I’m serious, I won’t blame you. I’ll still treat you as a good friend.”

Yang Ye chuckled, “I’ve never been a selfless person. Protect the world? Seriously, I’ve never had such thoughts. Little Sky, you’re my friend. You’re in danger now, so even I would look down on myself if I left now. Fighting while having no chance is foolish, but there are many occasions where even if it’s foolish, we still have to fight to the death!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he closed his eyes slowly, and then he vanished on the spot.

The Sword of Rebirth!

The Sword of Rebirth enhanced by two types of Returnal Rank intent!

As soon as Yang Ye executed the Sword of Rebirth, the armored woman’s face became gloomy. Because Yang Ye’s target wasn’t Sky Maiden but her!

Suddenly five shadowy figures appeared in front of her, and then five rays of golden light formed a golden shield that stood in front of them. As soon as the energy shield was formed, a ray of light slammed against it.

Boom!

A loud explosion instantly resounded, and then the huge golden shield and the ray of light exploded apart simultaneously. Two waves of energy erupted out, and they caused the surrounding space to ripple.

It didn’t take long for the surroundings to calm down.

Yang Ye gazed at the shadowy figures while a gloomy expression covered his face. He’d suddenly attacked the armored woman because she was heavily injured, and he hoped to take her by surprise and kill her.

However, he hadn’t expected those shadowy figures to be so swift and stop his attack.

Meanwhile, the armored woman gazed at Sky Maiden, “Sky Maiden, is it very difficult for you to kill him?”

Sky Maiden fell silent for an instant, and then she suddenly claws at Yang Ye. In an instant, the space around Yang Ye was devoured by a mysterious force. The devouring force was extremely swift, and it instantly arrived before Yang Ye and was about to swallow him!

Qin was about to lend Yang Ye a hand, but the shadowy figures appeared around her and surrounded her. Fortunately, a ray of earthen yellow energy surged out from Yang Ye and enveloped him, causing Sky Maiden’s energy to be instantly stopped.

The energy of the earth!

At the critical moment, Little Sky had moved the energy of the Earth from herself to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at the golden barrier around him and gazed at Sky Maiden, “You were going to kill me!”

Sky Maiden replied, “I gave you a chance!”

Yang Ye nodded. This time, he didn’t waste his breath on her. Because he was very well aware that she wasn’t the Yin’yin he knew. If she was Yin’yin, she would definitely not attack him.

Meanwhile, the armored woman said, “Sky Maiden! Kill him!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Sky Maiden didn’t speak to Yang Ye again as well. She looked up at the Eyes of the Heaven Dao and said, “Star Controller, my ten Nether Halls final mission is to annihilate the Eyes of the Heaven Dao in this world. Once that’s done, we sisters will be withdrawing from the Nether Pavilion. Of course, even if we aren’t withdrawing, you have no right to give me orders. Understand?”

The armored woman revealed a gloomy expression on her face when she heard Sky Maiden.

Meanwhile, Sky Maiden shot towards the Eyes of the Heaven Dao. At the same time, a huge mouth appeared in the sky, and then Yang Ye noticed that the Eyes of the Heaven Dao were starting to tremble!

It was fear!

Little Sky suddenly said, “Stop her!”

However, as soon as she finished speaking, she suddenly noticed that she had no further help. At this moment, Qin was being kept busy by those five shadowy figures. As for the Heavenblaze Emperor Flame, she was in battle with the middle aged man from the Nether Pavilion. Meanwhile, the spirit of the earth had to be ready to protect Little Sky from any surprise attacks from Fan Yinyu.

Little Sky gazed at Yang Ye. Yang Ye was about to attack when she shook her head at him, and then she waved her hand, “Stop her!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Snowy suddenly appeared in the sky. The space behind her suddenly started to tremble, and then numerous Sprite Kings flashed out from there. In less than two breaths of time, a few hundred Sprite Kings filled the area!

Little Sky raised her hand and swung it down, “Attack!”

A wisp of excitement flashed through Snowy’s eyes. A moment later, she opened her mouth and blew lightly. A white pillar of light instantly shot out from her mouth. At the same time, the Sprite Kings behind her released beams of various different elements. These beams converged together and formed an enormous multicolored pillar of light. After that, the pillar of light shot rapidly towards Sky Maiden.

Sky Maiden’s expression changed slightly. She didn’t dare act carelessly and immediately stretched out her right hand before clenching it lightly. In an instant, the space before her was devoured by a mysterious energy. The mysterious energy was extremely swift, and it only took an instant for it to arrive before the pillar of light which Snowy and the Sprite Kings had released.

The two forms of energy collided!

Bang!

A deafening explosion resounded throughout the starry sky. Sky Maiden was instantly blasted around 30k away while the wave of energy that erupted in the sky was completely swallowed by Snowy!

Snowy burped after she finished swallowing the energy, and then she gazed at Sky Maiden. After that, she waved her claw again.

As soon as they received Snowy’s order, the Sprite Kings attacked in unison again.

Boom!

A few hundred beams of light shot through space and descended towards Sky Maiden and the others from Nether Pavilion.

Both Sky Maiden and the armored woman’s expressions were quite unsightly when they witnessed this scene. If any one of these Sprite Lords were alone, or even if they had to face Snowy alone, they could deal with them with ease. But if all of them were gathered together, then the joint forces of the Sprite Kings and Snowy wasn’t something that their individual strength could rival.

The armored woman fell silent for an instant, and then a talisman suddenly appeared in front of her. After that, it shot up into outer space and exploded.

Once it exploded, the space behind the armored woman’s group cracked open, and then a black pillar of light shot out from within it. The black pillar of light slammed against the multicolored pillar of light that Snowy and the Sprite Kings had created. It was like two shooting stars smashing against each other.

Boom!

The entire area shook violently while a huge expanse of space cracked open and seemed like it was covered in spiderwebs!

The collision caused countless strands of energy to surge towards the surroundings, and space was instantly torn open before them.

Meanwhile, a man and a beast walked out from the spatial rift behind the armored woman.

Little Sky’s eyes instantly narrowed when she saw the pair of man and beast, and a solemn expression appeared in her eyes.

Yang Ye’s face fell at the sight of this.

Meanwhile, the man who emerged from the spatial rift gazed at Little Sky. He was about to speak when he suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, “What a familiar bloodline… Have we met?”
