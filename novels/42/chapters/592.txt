Chapter 593 – Critical Strike!

It was Yang Ye of course!

Jian Kuang and the others frowned slightly when they saw Yang Ye, and then Jian Kuang laughed coldly, “I presume that you’re that so-called Sword Emperor of this world, right? You really are as Lan Ling described. You’re really arrogant and proud, huh? Haha, you know... we might have really been helpless against you if you cowered in Ancient Domain City, but I never imagined that you would have come out here on your own. You’ll pay for such conceit with your life!”

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “Actually, there really isn’t any deep-seated or irreconcilable enmity between me and your Hallowed Grounds, so there’s no need for us to fight each other to the death, right? Why don’t I be the host and let’s all sit down for a drink, have a good chat, and then let bygones be bygones, alright?”

All of them were slightly stunned when they heard this. Is he seeking reconciliation?

The disdain on Jian Kuang’s face grew even clearer, and even Jian Yan, Jian Xin, and Lan Yun revealed a wisp of contempt. This is what the Sword Emperor of Profounder Continent is like? He isn’t anything great.

“Hahaha!!!” Qing Feng roared with laughter as he pointed a finger at Yang Ye and said, “You want to seek reconciliation with us now? Weren’t you very arrogant before this? Didn’t they say that we members of the Hallowed Grounds can’t hold a candle to you? What is it? You’re shrinking back as soon as experts of our Hallowed Grounds arrive? Hahaha!”

“I’m really disappointed!” Jian Kuang spoke abruptly, “I’d been rather looking forward to fighting you because I wanted to see exactly how monstrous the profounders of this abandoned world can be. But I never imagined that you would be nothing worth mentioning!”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “So what all of you mean is we aren’t going to sit down and talk about it, right?”

Jian Kuang spoke indifferently, “Those who kill members of my Hallowed Grounds must die. All those profounders of the southern territory who insulted my Hallowed Grounds must die as well!”

Yang Ye shrugged, and then he looked up into the sky and said, “Seniors, see that? I told you that they wouldn’t bury the hatchet with us. Seeking reconciliation is merely like asking for insult.”

Even though the Demon Emperor and the others had decided not to travel to the Hallowed Grounds, they didn’t want Yang Ye to form irreconcilable enmity with the Hallowed Grounds. So, they’d specially asked Yang Ye to probe their attitude towards the matter and see if reconciliation was an option.

“Do as you wish.” A voice resounded from high above in the sky.

Yang Ye gazed at Jian Kuang’s group and said, “Now, will all of you fight me one by one, or as a group?”

“As a group?” Jian Kuang started laughing out of extreme rage, “Yang Ye, who the fuck do you think you are? Fight you as a group? We have to join forces to kill you? Three swings of my sword! Three swings are all I need or I, Jian Kuang, will never pick up a sword in my life!”

“What a fucking idiot!” Meanwhile, Corpse Ancestor spoke abruptly, “All those years ago, we actually lost to the Hallowed Grounds that specializes in producing idiots. It really seems so sad now.”

“You’re courting death!” Jian Kuang’s sword suddenly left its sheath and carried a ray of light as it stabbed Corpse Ancestor’s chest. The formidable strength within this attack caused Corpse Ancestor to take a few steps back, but that was the extent of it!

The expressions of Lan Yun and the others changed slightly when they witnessed this scene. Jian Kuang’s attack had been enhanced by 8th level Sword Intent while he was utilizing a Dao Artifact to execute it. However, he’d merely caused his opponent to take a few steps back! Exactly what sort of monster is that skeleton?

“Weak, too weak! Are the members of the Hallowed Grounds all so weak?” Corpse Ancestor shook his head.

Jian Kuang’s face turned ferocious. He pressed his index and middle finger together before flicking it before him while he said, “Wind Dance!”

As soon as he spoke, Jian Kuang’s sword suddenly started dancing through the air while countless strands of sword qi flickered through the surroundings and instantly enveloped Corpse Ancestor. These strands of sword qi seemed like fluttering butterflies, and they seemed very beautiful if based on their outward appearance alone. However, they carried extremely terrifying might and even space was actually warping as they danced about!

Yang Ye nodded slightly when he witnessed this scene, and then he grinned as he gazed at Jian Kuang. This fellow is at the fifth rank of the Exalt Realm at least, and both his Sword Intent and sword techniques are really good. He’s really suitable to be refined as a Sword Servant. But besides this fellow, the others should be not bad as well.

When he thought up to this point, Yang Ye’s smile grew even more brilliant as he gazed at them all.

A short while later, the sword qi dispersed.

“It’s still too weak!” Meanwhile, Corpse Ancestor’s voice resounded once more.

All the members of the Hallowed Grounds revealed shock on their faces, and their gazes had revealed seriousness for the first time.

Yang Ye shook his head when he witnessed this scene. Because even he couldn’t do anything to Corpse Ancestor’s physical defenses without utilizing his Sword Domain and Heavenrend Drawing Technique, so how could Jian Kuang possibly pierce Corpse Ancestor’s defenses?

“Exactly what sort of monster are you!?” Jian Kuang spoke coldly.

“It should be my turn now!” Corpse Ancestor suddenly stomped his right foot on the ground, and his figure shot forward like a cannonball. His first tore through the air and whistled sharply as it smashed forcefully towards Jian Kuang’s chest!

Jian Kuang’s eyelids twitched. He didn’t dare act carelessly in the slightest, and the profound energy within him surged into his sword before he stabbed it swiftly towards Corpse Ancestor’s fist.

Bang!

A loud bang resounded as Jian Kuang’s sword curved into the shape of a bow while Jian Kuang himself was blasted over 100m away by Corpse Ancestor’s formidable physical strength!

Corpse Ancestor chuckled and was about to follow up with another attack. However, right at this moment, a dark blue ray of light suddenly smashed against his body, and he was blasted over 30m away. Moreover, a faint mark had appeared on his chest!

A wisp of surprise flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes when he witnessed this scene, and then he gazed at Lan Yun because it was Lan Yun who’d launched the attack. She was actually able to leave a mark behind on Corpse Ancestor’s body? Her Sword Intent doesn’t seem to have attained the 10th level!

After all, it was impossible for him to injure Corpse Ancestor without utilizing his 10th level Sword Intent! However, Lan Yun had absolutely not attained 10th level Sword Intent!

“Eh? Critical Strike?” Corpse Ancestor gazed at Lan Yun and said, “I never expected that you would be proficient in a Sword Divine Technique of the ancient sword cultivators. How surprising!”

“Critical Strike? A Sword Divine Technique? What’s that?” Yang Ye spoke curiously.

Corpse Ancestor gazed at Yang Ye with his eye sockets and said, “How sad is that. You don’t even know this. How did you even become the Sword Emperor? The Critical Strike is a Sword Divine Technique. To put it simply, those who cultivate it are capable of instantly doubling the might of their Sword Intent. Hehe, it’s formidable, right?”

Yang Ye was visibly moved when he heard this. If he were able to cultivate it and utilized it with his 10th level Sword Intent, then even instantly annihilating ninth rank Exalt Realm experts would be extremely easy for him. It was even to the extent that it wouldn’t be impossible for him to leave injuries behind on Corpse Ancestor’s body!

“You want to learn it?” Right at this moment, Lan Yun gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye nodded without the slightest hesitation. After all, such a technique would be a weapon of great destruction if it fell into his hands. Especially when he utilized Heavenrend. If he enhanced Heavenrend with his Sword Intent and added Critical Strike to it as well.... Yang Ye really had the impulse to fight a Monarch Realm expert!

“Unfortunately, you won’t have the chance to anymore!” Lan Yun moved her hand slightly, and then a dark blue ray of sword qi flashed like a bolt of lightning towards Yang Ye. Space was directly torn apart wherever it passed!

However, Yang Ye didn’t move at all and just allowed it to strike him....
