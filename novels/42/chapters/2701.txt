Chapter 2702 – I’m Still Going!

The five swords followed him!

Yang Ye hadn’t summoned them over to him, it was they that had come to him!

They wanted to train with Yang Ye!

Yang Ye had noticed their arrival, but he ignored them.

Just like that, a month passed.

Throughout this month, Yang Ye did nothing but train with the sword.

Training with the sword was training the heart, and training the heart was training the sword.

Yang Ye was much less hasty and impatient now, and it was the same for his sword.

Of course, it didn’t mean that his sword didn’t carry the desire to kill.

It was just that everything had been kept within his sword now.

It remained ordinary until the moment he struck!

As for his cultivation, it was at his peak, and he was just a step away from the peak of the Destiny Realm!

Of course, it was mostly thanks to the Polaris Energy within the wooden house!

Polaris Energy could be described as the greatest type of profound energy in the world. No, Snowy’s spirit energy couldn’t be overlooked. It should be said that they were both equally matched at the top!

Polaric Energy was very beneficial to people, and Snowy’s spirit energy was very beneficial to Sprites. Conversely, Polaris Energy wasn’t as useful as Snowy’s spirit energy when it came to Sprites and beasts, and vice versa!

But that wasn’t the main point, the main point was that he had them both!

Under such circumstances, even an ordinary person would advance by leaps and bounds, let alone Yang Ye.

However, when compared to his cultivation, Yang Ye attached more importance to his Sword Dao!

He had obtained even more comprehension!

Comprehensions in the sword!

As for Snowy, besides cultivating, all she did was play all day. She’d even dragged the sheep and cows into the Primordial Pagoda.

Actually, the Primordial Pagoda was like a real world. Besides having very few people, there were also demons and Sprites. Especially Sprites, they could be said to provide boundless life to the world in the pagoda.

At this point, there was no world with spirit energy that could surpass the Primordial Pagoda!

Especially when Snowy was in this world. Snowy planted some things here like the Chaotic Fruit Tree and Worldborn Fruit Tree, and they’d grown into towering trees that were covered with fruits.

However, a portion of this had to be attributed to Polaris Energy. Snowy used it with her own spirit energy, the Primordial Violet Energy, and the Eternal Energy she multiplied herself… In short, these two trees had been grown with the best types of spirit energy in the world, and they received an endless supply of it. It could be said that even if they were just grass, Snowy could probably make them into immortal grass!

Never underestimate Snowy’s ability!

She was the most extraordinary existence here!

Yang Ye didn’t continue cultivating.

It was because a month had passed.

The End World would act against him now.

…

Meanwhile, in an unknown world. It was like the Martial Sky World and Past Life World, the spirit energy here had completely vanished. It was an abandoned world.

At an underground world, a woman waved her spear incessantly, and there was a shadow before her.

Bam!

She was suddenly pushed 300m back, and her arm cracked open!

The shadow suddenly said, “Combat techniques are supported by strength and speed. Their core is strength and speed, and the faster you are, the stronger they will be. Your speed is far from sufficient! Continue!”

The woman waved her spear, and then she appeared where she’d been a moment ago.

But just a short while later, she was pushed back again.

The shadow said, “Not enough!”

She charged once more.

Bam!

She was instantly blasted away, and the shadow said, “Slow, too slow. Speed is supreme! Continue!”

Just like that, she charged at the shadow over and over again.

…

The Void World.

Sky Maiden stopped and wanted to leave the Void World.

Meanwhile, an ethereal figure appeared before her.

Sky Maiden frowned slightly.

The figure shook its head, “Do you think that you can stop the End World?”

She replied indifferently, “I can’t stand by idly!”

The ethereal figure replied solemnly, “Let him deal with it himself.”

She gazed at the figure, and the latter spoke softly, “Trust me, it’s the best way to help him.”

Sky Maiden asked, “Why?”

The ethereal figure replied, “He has a higher chance of surviving on his own. Because he can run and play tricks when he’s alone. But if you go, he can’t flee. At that time, he will really have no chance.”

Sky Maiden fell silent.

The ethereal figure continued, “Moreover, those forms of Destiny haven’t said anything, but I refuse to believe they will just stand by idly and watch. If they help, he’ll naturally be fine; but if they don’t help, then you definitely can’t go. Because you’ll just be sacrificing yourself for nothing!”

Sky Maiden closed her eyes slowly, “Will he die?”

The ethereal figure fell silent for a short while and said, “I can’t say for sure. He’s very sly, and coupled with the backing he has, and the Good Sprite and Evil Beast… He’s like a mystery, a mystery that’s impossible to uncover. So…”

Sky Maiden looked off into the distance, “The End World won’t let him live, right?”

The ethereal figure nodded, “Unless he’s willing to abandon the Good Sprite and Evil Beast. Actually, it probably won’t end well for him no matter what he does now. He’s with Destiny now, so it’s like betrayal to countless other cultivators. Because as far as they are concerned, Destiny is their greatest enemy. Now, Yang Ye has sided with their greatest enemy.”

Sky Maiden gazed at the ethereal figure, “Will Destiny help?”

The figure shook its head slightly, “I’m not sure.”

Sky Maiden fell silent.

The figure spoke solemnly, “Going to him won’t help at all. Only he can overcome this on his own.”

She fell silent for a short while and shook her head, “I’m worried!”

She turned around and vanished on the spot.

The ethereal figure sighed softly.

…

The Destiny Dimension.

Four people arrived at its entrance.

They were led by Heng Wangu, and First God, Zuo Mu, and Mo Yu were by his side.

Heng Wangu glanced at the Destiny Dimension and spoke softly, “This is where the Destiny in black lives?”

Mo Yu replied indifferently, “What do you think?”

Heng Wangu chuckled, “I don’t really think anything of it. I’m just a little curious.”

He scanned it and said, “They are like gods of this world who rule it… However, they really haven’t done anything to those beneath the Destiny Realm.”

Mo Yu replied, “They only target Destiny Realm experts.”

Heng Wangu nodded, “Let’s forget them for now.”

He gazed at the Destiny Realm and continued, “He should be still in there.”

First God suddenly said, “What do we do if they come?”

Destiny!

The others’ expressions became quite solemn.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

No one could overlook Destiny!

Mo Yu suddenly said, “Don’t worry, they probably won’t.”

First God gazed at him, “What makes you so sure?”

Mo Yu glanced at First God, “Because I was once chosen by her.”

The First God replied indifferently, “I don’t think you are anymore.”

Mo Yu’s face instantly turned cold and gloomy.

Meanwhile, Heng Wangu suddenly said, “Don’t fight among yourselves. Our target is Yang Ye.”

First God moved his gaze away and didn’t say anything.

The more time he spent with Heng Wangu, the more mysterious the latter seemed to him.

Heng Wangu gazed at Mo Yu, “You said they have enemies too?”

Mo Yu nodded, “She told me about it once. She has to suppress some existences, especially at certain times. Once every thousand years. I counted, and this should be when they are busiest.”

Zuo Mu suddenly asked, “What are they fighting against?”

Mo Yu shook his head, “I don’t know. It may be their enemies in the Four Dimensional Space. In any case, it has nothing to do with us!”

Heng Wangu nodded. Meanwhile, First God suddenly said, “Heng Wangu, I’m quite curious. Do you have a plan for if Destiny appears?”

Heng Wangu smiled, “Are you afraid?”

First God replied indifferently, “I’m just asking!”

Heng Wangu replied softly, “I think that since we’ve chosen to go against Destiny, we should ignore our own fate. If we aren’t even prepared to die, how can we even fight Destiny?”

The others fell silent.

Heng Wangu looked at the distant Destiny Dimension, “Will you come outside, or should we destroy this place and force you out?”

They received no reply.

First God spoke indifferently, “Do you think he’ll come outside?”

Heng Wangu gazed at Zuo Mu.

Zuo Mu nodded slightly and took a step forward. A moment later, a ray of saber energy shot through space and went straight for the Destiny Dimension! This attack contained the force of the world, and it had an unstoppable aura!

Boom!

That point in space shook violently, but just a moment later, a wave of powerful energy rippled out from there!

Zuo Mu’s expression changed slightly as he took a step back, and then he drew his saber and swung it again.

Hiss!

The space before Zuo Mu was slashed open, but the attack failed to stop the energy. The energy swept over and enveloped Heng Wangu’s group.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

A few muffled explosions resounded, and all of them were pushed around 3km back!

A voice suddenly resounded from afar, “I’ll come outside if it’s a one-on-one battle! Otherwise, I won’t.”

One-on-one!
