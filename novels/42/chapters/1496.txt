Chapter 1497 - I’ll Kill You With 10 Attacks!

Translator: InVader

Actually, Yang Ye understood her decision.

If it was just a single Rebirth Realm expert, then they had a chance to buy time until Blood Maiden woke up. However, there were two Rebirth Realm experts now!

Two!

It could be said that his side had no chance of winning!

Under such circumstances, it was naturally very normal that she’d fled. After all, there was no connection between Lian Banzhuang and Blood Maiden, so she would definitely not give her life away for Blood Maiden!

What should I do now?

Fight two on my own?

Or flee as well?

Fleeing was naturally impossible. The old man had been infuriated during the previous battle, so the old man would definitely not allow him to escape. Moreover, not to mention whether he could flee, even if he could, once the old man killed Blood Maiden and came looking for him, how would he resist the joint forces of two Rebirth Realm experts?

So, his goal right now was to wait until Blood Maiden regained her consciousness!

Only then would he be able to survive!

However, he couldn’t even fight a Rebirth Realm expert in a one on one battle, let alone a two on one battle!

When force couldn’t resolve the problem, Yang Ye decided to use words. After all, discussion was a method to resolve problems as well!

So, once he thought up to this point, Yang Ye gazed at the old man and middle aged man, and he smiled, “I think that we can sit down and have a chat. After all, more enmity is usually unable to resolve the prior enmity. Don’t you think so too?”

The old man spoke gloomily, “If you want to buy time, can you use more intelligent methods?

He’d been exposed!

However, Yang Ye displayed no embarrassment, and he spoke seriously, “Actually, I’m saying that for your own good. Do you really think she didn’t make any other preparations?”

“How laughable!” Meanwhile, the old man laughed with ridicule, “You actually want to use words against us at a time like this? Are you trying to insult us?”

Yang Ye was about to speak when the middle aged man by the old man’s side spoke abruptly, “Don’t waste more time. The important matter at hand is to deal with her.” As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of light that shot forward.

A ferocious glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, and he raised the casket lid with both hands and slammed it forward!

Boom!

An explosion resounded as Yang Ye was blasted 3km back again. As for the middle aged man, he was merely pushed around 300m back. Even though the middle aged man, Yu Ming had the upper hand, there was a trace of disbelief in his eyes, “You actually stopped my attack!”

He was shocked, of course. Because Yang Ye was just a Semi-Deity, and a Semi-Deity was simply weaker than an ant to experts at his level. Even if his cultivation and strength were suppressed, he still wasn’t an existence that a Semi-Deity could resist. Or it should be said that even ordinary Dualism Realm experts couldn’t fight him!

However, Yang Ye had stopped his attack and wasn’t injured by it!

It didn’t take long for Yu Ming’s gaze to descend onto the casket lid in Yang Ye’s grasp. A wisp of surprise flashed through his eyes, “It’s not ordinary at all. No wonder you were able to resist my attack. However, you won’t be so lucky next time.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he shot towards Yang Ye again.

This time, the old man didn’t stand by idly and charged at Yang Ye as well.

Obviously, they didn’t want to waste time.

Two Rebirth Realm experts!

Yang Ye took a deep breath while a wisp of resolve flashed through his eyes. A moment later, he flipped his palm, and a diagram appeared above him. As soon as the diagram appeared, the scene here changed. It didn’t take long for them to appear within space.

The Stellar Sword Diagram!

Yang Ye intended to use the Stellar Sword Diagram. He had no other choice. If he didn’t utilize it right now, then he would have no chance to win! He was very well aware that he couldn’t resist the joint forces of two Rebirth Realm experts. He would be no match for them even with the help of the casket lid. Perhaps he could protect himself from them by hiding within the casket, but what about Blood Maiden?

Yang Ye’s eyes suddenly lit up when he thought up to this point. What should he do about Blood Maiden? He could hide her in the casket!

However, it didn’t take long for this thought of his to be discarded. If both he and Blood Maiden hid within the casket, then who would deal with these two Rebirth Realm experts? He couldn’t allow Blood Maiden to be disturbed in the slightest right now. If they hid within the casket, and those two Rebirth Realm experts attacked the casket madly, then both he and Blood Maiden would really be finished.

He could take the casket and run, but could he outrun them?

He couldn’t. So, at this moment, he had no choice but to go head on against them. If he was going to go head-on against them, he had to use the Stellar Sword Diagram!

When the surroundings were transformed into an expanse of outer space, the old man and Yu Ming’s faces became solemn. Obviously, they’d sensed danger.

Meanwhile, Yu Ming gazed at Yang Ye and spoke in a low voice, “This is Jian Wuji’s Stellar Sword Diagram!”

The old man’s expression changed. He hadn’t expected it to actually be the Stellar Sword Diagram. It hadn’t just displayed extraordinary strength in the lower dimensions, it was extremely renowned in the large world as well. Of course, it was because of Jian Wuji.

When Jian Wuji arrived at the large world, he’d offended a powerful sect, and it ceaselessly dispatched experts to kill Jian Wuji and the Sword God’s Pavilion that Jian Wuji had created. In the end, Jian Wuji went to that sect on his own and activated the Stellar Sword Diagram there, enveloping that entire sect beneath it.

The final outcome was quite amusing because they didn’t fight.

That sect, which had eight Rebirth Realm experts, had chosen to surrender, and they swore on their souls that they wouldn’t look for trouble with Jian Wuji and Sword God’s Pavilion again.

That battle raised Jian Wuji’s reputation to a completely new level, and it was that battle which allowed the world to know of the Stellar Sword Diagram! Eight Rebirth Realm experts didn’t even have the courage to fight Jian Wuji and the diagram! How terrifying was it to be actually capable of doing that?

At this moment, both of them hadn’t expected it to be in Yang Ye’s possession!

The most terrifying part was that Yang Ye was a sword cultivator, and he could utilize it!

So, they didn’t dare act carelessly!

If their cultivations weren’t suppressed, then they wouldn’t really fear it. After all, Yang Ye didn’t possess the same realm of cultivation as Jian Wuji. Yet now, their cultivation and strength had been suppressed. So, they didn’t dare act carelessly when facing Yang Ye who could activate the Stellar Sword Diagram!

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate at all, and he intended to activate it. He couldn’t hesitate as well because losing lifespan was better than losing his life. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Right when he was about to summon the stellar sword energy, six terrifying auras appeared here. Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he put the Stellar Sword Diagram Away, causing the surroundings to return to normal. Yang Ye was shocked when he saw the owners of those six auras because he actually knew three of them!

They were Lian Banzhuang who’d just left, Demon Wu who’d chased after him a while back, and the Lava Titan. As for the other three, they were an old man in a luxurious robe, and two huge demon beasts.

Yang Ye was stunned by this scene, and then he looked at Lian Banzhuang.

Lian Banzhuang glanced at him, “They are willing to help, but they have a request, and it’s to make Blood Maiden take them with her. Of course, your agreement works as well.” She hadn’t forgotten that the mysterious young girl by Yang Ye’s side was friends with the Eye of the Heaven Dao.

Yang Ye immediately came to an understanding. Lian Banzhuang hadn’t fled, and she’d gone to get help instead.

It made sense because it could be considered her only chance to leave this place, so how could she possibly give up that easily? However, she was very well aware that just Yang Ye and her strength was utterly insufficient to deal with two Rebirth Realm experts. The only way they could resist two Rebirth Realm experts was by getting help. She knew that if she used an opportunity to leave as the bait, then many demon beasts and humans here wouldn’t be able to refuse it.

Sure enough, even Demon Wu who had enmity with her couldn’t refuse such an opportunity!

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “I agree!” He naturally had to agree. He didn’t want to use the Stellar Sword Diagram if possible. After all, losing lifespan was terrible!

Demon Wu suddenly asked, “You can make decisions for her?”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “She’s my second sister. What do you think?”

His second sister!

Demon Wu’s eyelids twitched. At the same time that he felt shocked, he felt slightly fearful. He hadn’t expected Yang Ye to know Blood Maiden. If he was aware that Yang Ye knew Blood Maiden, then he wouldn’t have gone to look for trouble with Yang Ye. After all, he didn’t want Blood Maiden to look for trouble with him.

Meanwhile, Ye Ming spoke abruptly, “We have no intention to become enemies with all of you. Our target is only Blood Maiden. As for leaving this place, so long as all of you don’t interfere, we can help you leave!”

“You can help us leave?” Meanwhile, the old man in a luxurious robe laughed with ridicule, “How laughable! Do you think we’re fools? If your cultivation wasn’t suppressed, then I might believe you. But now, your strength has been suppressed, so you can’t fight the Eye of the Heaven Dao. Since both of you dared to come in here, you definitely have a way to get out. However, it’s definitely not leaving by force, and it’s some other special method. Such special methods will definitely not work on us. After all, we’re being imprisoned here while both of you are outsiders. If you leave, the Eye of the Heaven Dao won’t fight both of you until it dies; but if we try to leave, the Eye of the Heaven Dao will definitely do everything it can to stop us!”

When he spoke up to this point, he gazed at Blood Maiden, “We can only rely on her to leave. Because she can suppress the Eye of the Heaven Dao, just like the Unfettered One did!”

Yu Ming and the other man’s expressions instantly turned unsightly. Because it was just as the old man in a luxurious robe had said. Both of them really were unable to fight the Eye of the Heaven Dao, nor did they dare to risk their lives against it. After all, if they forced it to detonate itself and mark them, then they would be finished. Because if such a powerful Eye of the Heaven Dao was forced to detonate itself and mark them, then they would definitely suffer a horrible death even if they returned to the large world!

So, it wasn’t realistic for them to think about suppressing the Eye of the Heaven Dao and taking these fellows out with them!

A moment of silence ensued before Yu Ming suddenly took a step forward, and then he glanced at them, “Since that’s the case, then let’s fight! Let me see how capable foreign prisoners like you are!”

“I’ll kill you with 10 attacks!” Suddenly, a voice resounded.

Everyone here was stunned, and they turned to look. Besides Yang Ye, the expressions of everyone else changed when they saw the person who spoke those words.

It wasn’t Blood Maiden!
