Chapter 2030 – I’m Truly Speechless!

The multicolored bolt of lightning shot down from above, and it was shooting down at the carriage.

The powerful natural might it contained was simply capable of obliterating everything!

Suddenly, the masked old man shot up into the sky, and a ray of light shot swiftly towards the bolt of lightning.

Boom!

A loud explosion resounded, but the lightning still hadn’t vanished. Moreover, it had sped up.

The old man frowned.

Meanwhile, Ji Yue placed her hands on her legs, and then she exerted strength. Faint violet energy suddenly seeped out from her legs. It was the Primordial Violet Energy which Yang Ye had given her!

As soon as the Primordial Violet Energy left her legs, the multicolored bolt of lightning suddenly vanished.

The world here was calm once more as well!

The carriage door suddenly sprung open, and the old man shot a glance into the carriage. Once he saw Ji Yue was fine, he glanced at Yang Ye before leaving.

Yang Ye asked, “What was that?”

She grinned, but there was self-ridicule in it, “Heaven’s Envy!”

“Heaven’s Envy?” Yang Ye frowned, “I don’t really understand!”

Ji Yue explained, “The heavens envy someone when that person is too outstanding in some aspect.”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched, “Really? I didn’t know there was something like that!”

She nodded slightly and gazed at the violet energy that was floating before her, “Brother Yang, this violet energy of yours isn’t ordinary.”

Yang Ye replied, “Unfortunately, it couldn’t help with your injuries!”

Ji Yue shook her head, “No, heavenly wrath was called down upon us because it worked.” She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “I’m sorry for dragging you into this.”

Yang Ye glanced at her legs and didn’t say anything. It was the first time he’d encountered something like this. He hesitated for a moment and said, “Miss Ji Yue, is there no way to resolve it?”

“Of course there is!” She smiled, “But I can’t do it now. Perhaps I may be able to in the future.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why don't the heavens envy me?”

Ji Yue was slightly stunned, and then she asked, “You want the heavens to envy you?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “No. I just think that I’m quite outstanding!”

Ji Yue was speechless.

After chatting for a while, it suddenly fell silent in the carriage.

Yang Ye noticed that the carriage was much faster than he’d ever imagined.

A day later, the carriage stopped.

Yang Ye and Ji Yue opened their eyes at the same time. They exchanged glances and left the carriage.

A green mountain, white clouds, and a small town!

If they looked forward from the carriage, there were a few obscure mountains far away at the ends of their vision. Below the mountains was a town, and there was smoke curling up from it. It seemed like a village.

Yang Ye gazed at Ji Yue, “What’s this place?”

Ji Yue replied, “A small paradise. Unlike the so-called ten great paradises in the outside world, this is a true small paradise that’s protected by numerous Sages.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Brother Yang, this place is protected by Sages, and its inhabitants are mostly ordinary people. While they don’t hate outsiders like us, they don’t really welcome our presence either. So, please remember that fighting is prohibited here, especially to outsiders like us. If you break the rules, you’ll have to endure the rage of a Sage!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand. Don’t worry, I won’t act rashly!”

Ji Yue felt much more at ease when she got that promise from Yang Ye. After all, he wasn’t a good person at all, and she was afraid that he would act rashly here. At that time, everything she’d done would be for nothing!

The three of them entered the town. Some of the town’s residents merely shot a glance at Yang Ye’s group before minding their own business.

Yang Ye scanned the surroundings. Sure enough, most of the people here were ordinary people. Of course, some weren’t. However, they had no fluctuations of profound energy, and they purely cultivated the body.

Meanwhile, some clamorous noise came from the side.

They turned to look. They saw a middle aged woman scolding a little girl around the age of five, “You little uncouth bitch! Tell me! Did your mother tell you to come steal from me? Tell me! Did she?”

Before the middle aged woman was a little girl with a ponytail. Her clothes were old and worn, and there were quite a few holes and patches on them. However, her clothes were very clean. She had her hands behind her body, and there was a steamed bun with meat filling in her grasps. She was holding desperately to it, and it had even been squashed under the pressure of her grasp.

The middle aged woman continued, “As expected of a bitch with no father. You’re stealing at such a young age. You’ll turn out horribly when you’re older. That vixen you have for a mother has such a seductive face, it’s obvious that she’s a whore who’s been with a thousand men…”

The little girl suddenly looked up at the middle aged woman and spoke in a slightly timid voice, “Don’t… don’t insult my mother!”

Slap!

The middle aged woman suddenly slapped the little girl, and the little girl tumbled backwards to the ground. However, she still held tightly to the bun in her grasp.

The middle aged woman seemed to show no intent to let the little girl go. She walked over to the little girl and continued, “You bitch! You’ll be just like your mother, you’ll definitely…”

“Brother Yang, let’s go!” Meanwhile, Ji Yue spoke abruptly.

Yang Ye glanced at the middle aged woman and the little girl, and then he asked, “Aren’t you going to do anything about it?”

She shook her head slightly, “The people here aren’t cultivators, and they have their own lives. If we interfere, they’ll get tainted by our karma, and it isn’t a good thing for them!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “I don’t think the same way. I don’t care about karma, all I care about is my heart. I can’t watch such a thing and stand by idly when I have the strength to do something about it.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot.

Ji Yue remained silent.

The middle aged woman was about to curse more, but Yang Ye suddenly appeared in front of her. He flicked an immortal crystal over to her, “I’ll buy that bun for her.”

The woman was stunned, and then she glanced at the immortal crystal in her grasp. A moment later, she suddenly pointed at Yang Ye and cursed, “You bastard! You’re actually trying to trick me with a loud rock? Do you think…”

Slap!

Suddenly, a palm descended upon her face, and a loud slap resounded as her figure dropped to the ground.

Yang Ye hadn’t exerted much strength, so her face had merely swelled up, and there was no danger to her life.

The woman was quite stunned, but it didn’t take long for her to recover from her shock. As soon as that happened, she jumped up and pounced at Yang Ye while shouting madly, “You fucking bastard! How dare you hit…”

Her voice stopped abruptly.

Because a hand had clamped down upon her throat, and it raised her up slowly, and her face instantly turned purple.

Suddenly, Ji Yue said, “Brother Yang, you must not kill.”

Yang Ye ignored her and looked the woman in the eyes while ghastly killing intent flickered in his eyes.

Meanwhile, Ji Yue spoke again, “Brother Yang, you promised!”

Yang Ye suddenly released her, and she dropped to the ground. Once she caught her breath, Yang Ye thought she would charge at him, but he hadn’t expected her to sit on the ground and wail, “How can a man hit a woman?! A man hit a woman! Everyone! Just look at him…”

Yang Ye was speechless. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The woman cried as she shouted, “There’s no reason left in this world! Nothing at all! Heavens! Open your eyes and take a look at this…”

Yang Ye shook his head, “In my entire life, I’ve had countless enemies, but you’re the only one who has made me so speechless!”

More and more were coming to look.

Meanwhile, Ji Yue suddenly walked over to her and flicked a fist-sized piece of gold to the woman. The woman immediately stopped speaking when she saw the gold, and then she took it and ran.

Yang Ye shook his head and turned around to look at the little girl. She had a round and chubby face, and she looked quite cute.

Meanwhile, the little girl suddenly started running to a house behind her. Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and followed her.

It was like a house with nothing but four walls!

There were only a few pieces of furniture, and an old and worn out bed was at the corner of the room. A woman was lying on the bed, and she had an extremely pale countenance. She seemed very weak.

However, based on the shape of her face, she was a beautiful woman in the past.

At this moment, the little girl had raised the bun to the woman’s lips, “Mom… Mom… eat… eat…”

Meanwhile, the woman suddenly opened her eyes. She didn’t look at the little girl, and she looked at Yang Ye instead.

Yang Ye frowned because he felt like she could see through him, and it made him extremely uncomfortable.

Meanwhile, she suddenly stretched out her hand and spoke softly, “Come…”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and walked over. She suddenly grabbed his hand, and then placed the little girl’s hand in Yang Ye’s grasp, “Young man, her name is Tian Xiu, and she’s the last descendant of my clan. Once I go, she definitely won’t be able to survive without anyone to take care of her. So, please let her go with you!”

Yang Ye frowned. Meanwhile, the woman’s voice suddenly resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “As compensation, I’ll tell you something about yourself.”

Yang Ye asked, “What?”

She looked him in the eyes, “You have no previous life, and you have no future life either!”

Yang Ye was puzzled. Suddenly, the woman looked behind Yang Ye and said, “A treasure of absolute evil… Its evil soul is about to take form. Young man, you’re in grave danger.”
