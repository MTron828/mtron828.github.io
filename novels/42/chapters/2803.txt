Chapter 2804 – Eternal!

Yang Ye wasn’t going to have fun, he was going to stop the Four Dimensional Universe and Destiny.

With how intelligent Ding Shaoyao was, she was very well aware of what that meant.

Especially Destiny!

Even though Yang Ye was amazing, that woman high above the clouds was truly too formidable and practically induced despair in all who stood before her!

In the hall.

Yang Ye gently wiped away her tears, “I dare not promise that I’ll come back, but I’ll do my best.”

She just gazed at him while more and more tears rolled down her face.

Yang Ye chuckled, “Stop crying. You’re the advisor and strategist of our Three Dimensional Universe.”

Ding Shaoyao looked down slightly, and a short while passed before she spoke softly, “Give me a moment.”

She turned around and left.

A short while later, she returned to the hall.

Everyone was stunned by the sight of her.

At this moment, she was wearing red like a bride. She was extremely beautiful herself, and now that she was dressed like this, it made her even more alluring.

Only Yang Ye and Ding Shaoyao remained in the hall.

She walked over to him and cracked a smile, “I’ll be waiting for you to return.”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a long time, and then he nodded and left.

At the entrance of the hall, she looked up at the ray of light in the clouds and seemed quite infatuated.

When he returns on his sword, I will lean against the railing and welcome him back with a smile. You’ve seen me like this, and so we shall be together forever!

…

Eternal Kingdom.

Presently, Eternal Kingdom was the Four Dimensional Universe’s territory, and there was a huge barrier of light in the sky above it.

It enveloped the entire Eternal Kingdom!

Due to the previous battle, Eternal Kingdom was actually in ruins, and the departure of Ding Shaoyao and the others included the spirit vein here. So, it could be said that Eternal Kingdom was on the verge of destruction.

Suddenly, a ray of sword energy appeared in the sky above Eternal Kingdom.

Everyone looked up, and a sword cultivator was standing there with his sword in hand!

Yang Ye!

Their expressions changed when they saw Yang Ye.

They’d fought Yang Ye earlier, so they naturally knew how terrifying he was. It could be said that if it wasn’t for Yang Ye, the entire Three Dimensional Universe would be no match for them! The Four Dimensional Universe would have been able to crush it with absolute ease!

However, it was because of Yang Ye’s presence that everything had changed!

Yang Ye glanced at Eternal Kingdom, “I’m here just to say that I, Yang Ye, would like all of you to return to the Four Dimensional Universe.”

The response he received was a huge beam of light!

The formation had been activated again!

Yang Ye looked at the beam of light before him. It was so powerful that it was definitely capable of annihilating a Destiny Realm expert with ease, and even ordinary Destiny Transcendence Realm experts would find it difficult to resist!

However, he’d come prepared this time!

Yang Ye stood there with his sword in hand while closing his eyes slowly. At the same time, his figure turned ethereal.

The Sword Domain!

A short while later, the beam of light arrived before him. Meanwhile, Yang Ye swung his sword.

A single swing!

The experts of the Four Dimensional Universe watched as this ordinary swing of Yang Ye’s stabbed against the beam of light.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted away.

Countless experts from the Four Dimensional Universe heaved sighs of relief from the sight of this!

However, Yang Ye suddenly forced himself to a stop, and then he tapped his foot down. His figure transformed into a ray of light that slammed at the beam of light.

“Slash!” Yang Ye’s voice resounded in the sky, and a ray of sword energy slammed against the beam of light!

Boom!

The beam of light shook violently, and then countless rays of sword energy slashed down upon the beam of light from multiple angles.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The sound of something being sliced open resounded through the sky.

The experts of the Four Dimensional Universe watched as the beam of light was sliced into countless pieces, and it caused their expressions to change.

Meanwhile, a Panthera shot up into the air and slammed itself at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye didn’t even spare it a glance before swinging his sword.

A ray of sword energy flashed.

Hiss!

The Phantera was sliced into two!

Countless experts from the Four Dimensional Universe were stunned by this scene, and their eyes were full of fear and even terror!

One attack!

They knew how formidable the physical defenses of the Phantera was. Even Destiny Realm experts found it very difficult to pierce, but Yang Ye had killed it in one hit!

An instant kill!

Yang Ye gazed at the barrier of light. At this moment, the formation was the greatest threat to him among the forces from the Four Dimensional Universe!

Yang Ye walked toward the formation, and it started to tremble rapidly. Strands of terrifying aura and pressure were rippling out incessantly from it. However, the pressure and aura didn’t affect Yang Ye at all!

They were destroyed with a light wave of his sword!

Suddenly, a beam of dazzling light erupted from the formation, and it was even larger than the last. It practically blotted out the sky, and the sky immediately turned ethereal before it.

It wasn’t something the Three Dimensional Universe could endure!

Yang Ye tightened his grip on his sword and remained indifferent.

A short while later, the beam of light arrived before him.

In practically an instant, the space around him collapsed, and the powerful impact of it caused fine cracks to appear all around him!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly!

His sword shot forward like it was a very ordinary swing, and there was a strand of light flickering at its tip.

Breaking through from a single point!

Boom!

An explosion rumbled in the sky, and the huge beam of light shook violently before exploding. Yang Ye’s figure was instantly blasted extremely far away!

However, he wasn’t seriously injured. Moreover, he’d destroyed the beam of light as well!

As they say, sword cultivators were capable of destroying all things with a single swing.

After a few collisions against it, Yang Ye had found some flaws in the formation. So, he’d converged his strength to a single point and destroyed the beam of light from that point. Even though he’d paid a small price to accomplish it, it wasn’t a big deal for him. Because his recovery was truly too fast.

Countless experts of the Four Dimensional Universe started to panic when they saw Yang Ye destroy the beam of light with such ease.

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot in the sky.

Yang Ye’s sword shot straight for the formation!

Meanwhile, the formation was activated again. This time, it wasn’t a beam of light but two that surged out from the barrier of light.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, but he still pressed forward while speeding up and tightened his grip on his sword. At this moment, the aura and sword intent he emanated actually surpassed the pressure and aura coming from the formation!

When the beams of light were just around 10m away from him, Yang Ye suddenly leaped up, and then he swung his sword down!

Bang! Bang!

Two explosions resounded through the sky, and a figure was blasted away. However, the two beams of light exploded apart as well! Moreover, Yang Ye suddenly stopped himself just a moment after being blasted away, and then he transformed into a ray of light that slammed against the huge barrier of light.

Boom!

The barrier of light shook violently, and then countless cracks appeared on it!

“Stop him!” Someone howled with fury.

The formation would be able to keep Yang Ye busy for some time while it remained standing, but if Yang Ye managed to destroy it, then they wouldn’t be able to keep him busy anymore.

Countless experts charged up into the air.

Yang Ye swung his sword repeatedly before the barrier of light, causing it to shake violently while more and more cracks appeared.

Suddenly, Yang Ye stopped, and then he looked toward the side. Countless experts from the Four Dimensional Universe had arrived before him.

A vicious glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, and then he vanished on the spot.

Hiss!

The head of a nearby expert shot up into the air!

Meanwhile, a demon slammed itself at Yang Ye from above.

Yang Ye tapped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that shot up into the air.

Hiss!

The ray of light passed straight through the demon!

Yang Ye turned around in midair and raised his right hand. His sword shot forward, and then the head of an expert in black armor who was over 1km away instantly shot up into the air.

After he killed that expert, Yang Ye was about to attack again, but a voice suddenly resounded through the sky, “Get back!”

It was Monarch Yan’s voice!

The others immediately retreated upon hearing this command. At the same time, a pike shot through the air in Yang Ye’s direction!

Yang Ye raised his hand and swung his sword.

Bam!

The pike instantly cracked open, and a figure appeared before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye stabbed his sword forward.

Bang!

The figure was forced to a stop. It was Monarch Yan, and his entire body was emanating waves of terrifying energy. The energy ceaselessly surged over to envelop Yang Ye, but it was repulsed by the sword intent around Yang Ye!

Monarch Yan stared at Yang Ye. Suddenly, a black lotus appeared on his palm@

The sword intent Yang Ye emanated instantly started to turn ethereal!

Death Energy, Foul Energy, and Yin Energy!

Yang Ye frowned slightly and moved around 1m back before slashing forward with both hands.

Hiss!

It seemed like this slash could slash open the world. The energy before him was instantly sliced apart. At the same time, Yang Ye appeared before Monarch Yan and swung his sword!

Monarch Yan’s eyes narrowed slightly, and the black lotus on his palm immediately bloomed. In an instant, countless strands of black energy shot forward like venomous snakes pouncing at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye stomped his right foot down and slashed.

Bang!

The black energy was instantly slashed apart, and Monarch Yan was even blasted over 10km away by the force of it!DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

As soon as Monarch Yan stopped himself, a ray of sword energy suddenly arrived before him.

Bang!

His body exploded apart before the eyes of countless, but his soul had fled over 30km away behind the formation.

Destruction of the body with a single swing of the sword1

Yang Ye glanced coldly at the experts of the Four Dimensional Universe, “Now, I’ll repeat myself again. Are you going to fuck off from the Three Dimensional Universe or not?”
