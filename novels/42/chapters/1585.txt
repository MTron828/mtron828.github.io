Chapter 1586 - Try It In Your Next Lifetime!

Translator: InVader

One on one?

Actually, he didn’t fear the one-armed man.

Even though he was being suppressed right now, he could still fight the one-armed man if he used his full strength. However, how long would that take?

He couldn’t use the Divine Yin Flame or the Stellar Sword Diagram, so how long would it take for him to defeat the one-armed man? After all, he couldn’t kill the one-armed man, and it was clearly not easy for the one-armed man to kill him. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The pig riding young woman and the others were clearly aware of that as well, and they were about to join the battle. However, a ray of light suddenly flashed, and then an explosion resounded. Besides Blind Maiden, the pig riding young woman and the others were instantly blasted over 1km away. Even Blind Maiden was pushed around 300m back!

Yang Ye had a solemn expression on his face when he witnessed this scene, and his gaze descended onto the man with a spear.

He’s strong!

Actually, it wasn’t just the man with a spear who was strong, the others on Fan Yinyu’s side were extremely strong as well!

As one of the two Nether Envoys, how strong was Fan Yinyu?

“Be careful. He’s a Spear Saint.” Suddenly, Blind Maiden’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “His attainments in the Spear Dao are extraordinary. He can’t be underestimated at all.”

A Spear Saint? Yang Ye frowned. Suddenly, the one-armed man appeared before him again, and then a cold ray of light instantly arrived in front of him.

Yang Ye flipped his palm, and then the casket lid appeared in front of him.

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and Yang Ye was blasted around 300m away. However, the one-armed man immediately appeared in front of him, and then swung his saber at Yang Ye once more.

This time, Yang Ye didn’t choose to block it passively, and he grabbed the casket lid and slammed it in the saber’s direction.

Bang!

As soon as they came into contact, a wave of energy erupted from the point of collision. Both Yang Ye and the one-armed man were instantly blasted away. But it only took a moment for them to charge at each other again.

At this moment, Yang Ye’s fury had been aroused.

He activated the Demon God’s energy again. With the boost provided by it, his strength instantly multiplied. So, his strength wasn’t inferior to the one-armed man anymore. However, he was still in a passive position because the one-armed man’s combat experience was much greater than his, and the man’s saber was too fast. Yang Ye couldn’t locate its flaws and counter it in time!

A battle of attrition!

Yang Ye was fighting a battle of attrition with the one-armed man!

At the same time that Yang Ye was fighting the one-armed man, Blind Maiden and the others were in battle with the spear-wielding man. The spear-wielding man was extremely terrifying, and he didn’t fall into a disadvantaged position even when fighting Blind Maiden and the others by himself. Or it should be said that besides Blind Maiden, the others weren’t able to fight him at all!

Yang Ye had noticed this, and he knew that this situation couldn’t be allowed to go on.

After all, they had an even greater enemy.

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment, and then he pushed the one-armed man back before waving his right hand.

Roar!

A dragon roar resounded throughout the battlefield, and then a huge golden dragon appeared here.

Everyone here stopped fighting when they saw the huge golden dragon. The one-armed man and spear-wielding man gazed at Yang Ye, and there was a puzzled expression in their eyes.

They weren’t the only ones who were puzzled, the pig riding young woman and the others were similarly puzzled and curious.

It was especially so for the pig riding young woman, Light Maiden, and Boundary Maiden. Yang Ye had made the golden dragon vanish earlier, and they’d been extremely curious because of that. Now, he’d summoned it, so it made them feel even more puzzled.

After it appeared here, the golden dragon immediately charged towards the spear-wielding man.

The spear-wielding man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he stabbed his spear at the dragon from afar.

Bang!

The huge golden dragon was instantly pushed over 1km away!

Yang Ye had an extremely solemn expression on his face when he witnessed this scene. He’s really strong!

“Attack! End the battle as soon as possible!” Suddenly, Blind Maiden’s voice resounded.

As soon as her voice finished resounding, she charged towards the spear-wielding man. Meanwhile, the pig riding young woman and the others charged towards the one-armed man instead.

They were very well aware that even if they had the golden dragon’s assistance, it would be very difficult to kill the spear-wielding man. Because the man was too strong. So, they’d decided to help Yang Ye kill the one-armed man first. After all, the one-armed man was much easier to kill.

Once Boundary Maiden and the others joined the battle, the one-armed man instantly fell into a disadvantaged position. No, it should be said that he was completely suppressed.

Yang Ye was weaker than the one-armed man, but Boundary Maiden and the others weren’t. Moreover, it was four against one now, so how could the one-armed man possibly be a match for them?

It didn’t take long for the one-armed man to be pushed back repeatedly. Meanwhile, while the joint forces of Blind Maiden and the huge golden dragon weren’t able to suppress the spear-wielding man, he was unable to harm Blind Maiden and the golden dragon either.

Around 15 minutes later, the one-armed man wasn’t able to hold on much longer before the joint forces of Yang Ye and the others. But right when they were about to kill him, Blind Maiden and the others’ expressions changed, and they simultaneously vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he hurriedly followed after them.

It didn’t take long for them to arrive at another battlefield, and it was Blood Maiden and Fan Yinyu’s battlefield.

This battlefield was filled with the stench of blood.

Blood Maiden and Fan Yinyu were standing in front of each other, and they were no more than 1km away from each other.

When they witnessed the scene here, even Yang Ye’s expression changed because Blood Maiden’s arms were gone, and blood was flowing out incessantly from the corners of her mouth.

Obviously, Blood Maiden had lost!

Yang Ye gazed at Fan Yinyu, and there was an unprecedentedly solemn expression on his face. Fan Yinyu was the strongest amongst all the experts he’d met until now.

The old man in a Daoist’s robe and the Unfettered One were naturally not included. After all, he hadn’t really met them.

Meanwhile, Nether Maiden and the others arrived here as well. None from the Nether Pavilion were dead. As for Fan Yinyu’s side, besides the one-armed woman that Yang Ye killed, the others were alive as well. Of course, the huge golden dragon could be considered to be on Yang Ye’s side now.

Fan Yinyu glanced indifferently at Blood Maiden, “Your Blood Domain is not bad indeed. However, it’s far from sufficient to face me!”

As she spoke, she suddenly turned to look at Yang Ye, “You surprised me quite a bit, and you’re someone I overlooked. Even though your strength is inferior to her, you have a huge number of treasures and the Sword Domain. Of course, your strength isn’t bad as well. However, it’s fine. She died from the sword technique she created, and that’s a good end for her!”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “She was very strong!” He spoke those words sincerely. If he didn’t have the Heaven’s Eye Rock which Little Sky had given him, he would have definitely died even with the Sword Domain.

Fan Yinyu said, “In the history of this continent, besides the Unfettered One and Jian Wuji, her natural talent in the Sword Dao is the best. No, her natural talent in the Sword Dao is actually not inferior to them at all. Unfortunately, her unresolved issues ran too deep, and she couldn’t set herself free. If she could let go of everything and attain the same metal state that the Unfettered One had, then her attainments in the Sword Dao would be something that even I would fear.”

When she spoke up to this point, she suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, “Do you know why she didn’t utilize sword intent while fighting you?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Fan Yinyu explained, “She crippled her own sword intent.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Fan Yinyu fell silent for a moment and explained, “She didn’t want to practice the sword anymore. Or to be more precise, she didn’t want to live anymore. What a pity… What a pity indeed!”

Yang Ye fell silent. At this moment, he suddenly recalled that the woman hadn’t utilized sword intent at all while in battle with him. He, on the other hand, had utilized two intents. A sword cultivator was only truly terrifying when sword intent was utilized. If she still had her sword intent and utilized it against him, then even the casket lid may not have been able to stop the Sword of Rebirth that she executed!

Meanwhile, Fan Yinyu suddenly gazed at the huge golden dragon. Fear instantly appeared in its eyes when it saw her gaze turn to it, and then he ran into the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Fan Yinyu gazed at Yang Ye, “I’m truly surprised. You were able to make it submit to you. No, you don’t have that ability. It was that little girl who helped you?”

Yang Ye replied with a question, “What’s that little girl’s background?”

Fan Yinyu was slightly stunned, and then she replied with a question, “You don’t know?”

Yang Ye shook his head in response.

“Interesting!” There was a profound gaze in Fan Yinyu’s eyes as she said, “Interesting indeed. Actually, what I’m truly curious about is how did she end up by the side of someone who has comprehended Returnal Rank sword intent. Under normal circumstances, she should really hate you.”

Yang Ye replied, “She said that she wants to teach me to be a good person!”

“A good person?” Fan Yinyu scanned Yang Ye and said, “Try it in your next lifetime!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, Fan Yinyu glanced at Blood Maiden and the others, “I think it isn’t necessary to waste more time. Let’s put an end to everything for good.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she raised her feather fan slowly. A moment later, the spatial battlefield started trembling. The space here started to shake and bubble like it was boiling water!

At the same time, a terrifying wave of force appeared in the surroundings. Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically when it appeared because his body had instantly started to bend down. At this moment, it felt like numerous mountains were pressing down on his back, and his body was bending gradually. Moreover, his body was being torn open incessantly!

A Domain!

It was a Domain!

However, Yang Ye didn’t know what Domain it was. Of course, he didn’t have the time to care about that. All he knew was that he would be finished if this continued!

Because this force was too powerful! It was so powerful that he was almost unable to fight back against it!

The Sword Domain!

Yang Ye was about to release his Sword Domain to resist her Domain. However, that force suddenly vanished without a trace.

Yang Ye was stunned by this. He glanced at the surroundings, yet he noticed that Nether Maiden and the others had wild joy on their faces.

Sky Maiden? Yang Ye gazed at Fan Yinyu.

Meanwhile, Fan Yinyu gazed towards the right, “I thought you wouldn’t be coming!”

“Of course I would!” A voice suddenly resounded from afar.

After that, a figure walked out slowly from within space.

Yang Ye was stunned when he saw that figure. He was stunned for quite a while before he recovered from his shock, and then he gazed at that person, “You…”
