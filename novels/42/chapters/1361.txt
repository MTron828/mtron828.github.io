Chapter 1362 – I’ll Deal With It For Her!

“That’s Rebirth Rank sword intent!” Fen Cangyan stared fixedly at Yang Ye while disbelief filled his eyes. He hadn’t expected Yang Ye to have actually attained Rebirth Rank sword intent!

Yang Ye withdrew his sword, “I saved you because of her. Don’t think too much of yourself. Now, tell me about her.”

Fen Cangyan remained silent.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Do you want to continue being a slave?”

Fen Cangyan’s expression changed slightly. Only now did he recall that his soul was still in Yang Ye’s hands. He remained silent for a while before he said, “She’s in a very bad situation.”

Yang Ye said, “Tell me in detail!”

Fen Cangyan said, “Actually, once the Young Miss had recovered, while we were still no match for Celestial Demon Stellar Region, we’d alleviated the situation a little and were barely able to resist them. However, some experts appeared amongst the forces of Celestial Demon Stellar Region, and we instantly lost 7 worlds. Moreover, the Patriarch and Young Miss were injured in a battle with the Demon Lord of Celestial Demon Stellar Region.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Yang Ye slowly clenched his fists, and a long time passed before he said, “Go on.”

Fen Cangyan glanced at Yang Ye and continued, “According to the information we gathered, those experts were from Skyriver Stellar Region!”

The Alliance of Guardians! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. The Radiant Dimension was within the Skyriver Stellar Region’s territory, and it belonged to the Alliance of Guardians!

Fen Cangyan said, “Celestial Demon Stellar Region found out about what happened in the Radiant Dimension, so they sent their forces to form an alliance with the Alliance of Guardians. As for the Alliance of Guardians, they were displeased by the Young Miss’s interference that day, so they immediately agreed to send experts to assist Celestial Demon Stellar Region.”

“I caused this!” Yang Ye took a deep breath and closed his eyes slowly.

Fen Cangyan sized up Yang Ye and felt extremely shocked in his heart. After all, Yang Ye was merely a Half-Saint when they met that day. Yet now, he was an Emperor. Moreover, Yang Ye’s strength was so terrifying! Even though he’d been taken by surprise earlier and didn’t have any profound energy because he’d just regained his freedom, Yang Ye was just an Emperor, and he was a true Voider!

If it was any ordinary Emperor, he could eliminate that Emperor with a wave of his hand, even if he had no profound energy!

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time before he said, “How is the current situation?”

“We only have 3 worlds left.” Fen Cangyan continued, “If this continues, we’ll be able to hold on for a year at most.”

A year! Yang Ye tightened his grip on the sword in his grasp, and then he glanced at Fen Cangyan, “How did you get captured?”

Fen Cangyan hesitated for a moment and said, “We’re in a terrible state right now. If we gain no outside help, then Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region will definitely be destroyed. However, there’s no power willing to assist our stellar region now. Besides the Wildlands Stellar Region.”

Yang Ye asked, “That stellar region that your patriarch wanted to use her to form an alliance with?”

Fen Cangyan nodded, “Wildlands Stellar Region is formidable and on par with Celestial Demon Stellar Region. If they are willing to help, then our Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region will definitely be able to overcome this danger it’s facing. However, they have a condition. If we want them to step forward and help, then the Young Miss must be married into their clan. I was specially sent to Wildlands Stellar Region....” He glanced at Yang Ye when he spoke up to this point, “To discuss the alliance through marriage.”

A ghastly cold glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, “Was it your patriarch’s decision, or her decision?”

Fen Cangyan hesitated for a moment and said, “It was hers!”

Yang Ye gazed at Feng Cangyan while his face instantly turned icy cold, “Want to die?”

Fen Cangyan was shocked because Yang Ye had really aroused killing intent towards him!

Yang Ye spoke coldly, “Tell me the truth!” Based on Lady’s character, he was absolutely certain that she was definitely not someone who would make such a compromise and marry another to gain help. She would absolutely not do something so humiliating. Yang Ye knew that if he didn’t go find her in 3 years, then she would definitely fight to the death!

Fen Cangyan remained silent for a while before he said, “It was the patriarch.”

Y said, “Your patriarch dares to do that without her approval?”

Fen Cangyan replied, “If she doesn’t agree, then everyone in our stellar region will die!”

Yang Ye spoke coldly, “All of you are forcing her to do it!”

Fen Cangyan explained, “What else can we do? Do you know? Countless people are dying every single day. Remember those people who came to the Radiant Dimension with me, all of them have died in battle.”

Yang Ye remained silent for a short while before he said, “You don’t have to go to Wildlands Stellar Region.”

Fen Cangyan asked, “What do you mean?”

“She’s mine!” Yang Ye looked him in the eyes and said, “I’ll deal with it for her!”

Fen Cangyan was stunned, and then he spoke without thinking, “You’re overestimating....” He’d wanted to tell Yang Ye that Yang Ye was overestimating his ability, but Fen Cangyan had suddenly stopped. His soul was still in Yang Ye’s hands, and Yang Ye was clearly not a normal person. What if he infuriated Yang Ye and Yang Ye crushed his soul?

Yang Ye naturally knew what Fen Cangyan was thinking, but he didn’t care. He sized up Fen Cangyan and said, “How did you become a slave?”

Fen Cangyan replied, “I encountered the Evilrise Cult’s members while traveling to Wildlands Stellar Region and was captured by them.”

“The Evilrise Cult?” Yang Ye frowned, “Which stellar region are they from?”

Fen Cangyan shook his head, “It’s an organization that doesn’t belong to any stellar region. They specialize in capturing all sorts of demon beasts, Sprite Kings, human experts, and even the devil race.... In short, they capture anyone and anything, and then sell them. Countless powers have a huge headache because of them, and they want to eliminate the Evilrise Cult. However, the Evilrise Cult is very mysterious and doesn’t have a fixed base. So, not to mention eliminating them, we don’t even know how many experts or members the Evilrise Cult has.”

Fen Cangyan glanced at Yang Ye and continued, “If you encounter them, then run as far away as you can. Their experts far surpass your imagination. Even Celestial Demon Stellar Region doesn’t dare to offend them.”

The Evilrise Cult! Yang Ye shook his head, “From this moment onward, you’ll follow me and obey my orders. Understand?”

Fen Cangyan said, “I want to go back. Our stellar region really needs my help!”

“It won’t change a thing!” Yang Ye said, “I’ll take you there soon.”

Fen Cangyan spoke in a low voice, “You’re really going to go there?”

Yang Ye replied, “Of course.”

Fen Cangyan said, “Allow me to be honest. You’ll actually just be giving your life away!”

Yang Ye said, “I’m going even if that’s true.”

Fen Cangyan was about to speak when Yang Ye waved his hand and said, “Cut the crap. I told you to follow me, so just do as I say.”

Fen Cangyan glanced at Yang Ye and didn’t speak.

Yang Ye didn’t pay any further attention to Fen Cangyan, and he turned to look towards the stone platform instead. A few items had already been auctioned away. There had been techniques, equipment, and even natural treasures. All of them had been extraordinary treasures, and some had even been sold for over 10,000 divine crystals.

Not enough money!

It was the first time Yang Ye felt so poor!

Yang Ye watched a while longer. All the following treasures were very good, and he was even quite tempted by some. However, they were too expensive! In the end, Yang Ye decided to leave because not seeing them was better.

Right when Yang Ye’s group was about to leave, Yang Ye heard Tingyu suddenly say, “Everyone, the next item is a technique, the Stellar Ward Technique. It’s a low-grade Origin Rank technique....”

Yang Ye suddenly stopped when he heard up to this point, and there was a trace of pleasant surprise in his eyes when he turned to look at the stone platform!

The Stellar Ward technique!

He’d cultivated it, but it wasn’t the complete version of it. According to the dean of White Deer Academy, Xiao Bieli, an expert of the academy had obtained it by chance while traveling through outer space. But for some reason, it was an incomplete copy. But while it was incomplete, it was extremely heaven defying!

However, the incomplete version wasn’t very useful to him at his current strength. Because his body was already far stronger than it.

Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto Tingyu, and he listened quietly.

Tingyu glanced at the surroundings and explained with a smile on her face, “The Stellar Ward technique is at the Origin Rank. If it’s cultivated, even a Semi-Deity would probably find it difficult to pierce your physical defenses. The starting bid is 5,000 divine crystals and the minimum increments are 1,000 divine crystals!”

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “Miss Tingyu, only those who can cultivate stellar energy are able to cultivate that technique, right?”

Tingyu’s expression changed slightly, and then she glanced at Yang Ye’s room with an icy cold gaze. She naturally knew that it could only be cultivated by someone who’d cultivated stellar energy, but besides the residents of Stellar Continent, there was practically no one else in this world who could cultivate stellar energy. In other words, unless that cultivator had cultivated stellar energy, the Stellar War technique was barely useful to ordinary cultivators. No, it was actually useless!

The others weren’t aware, so they would have definitely fought to obtain it. Yet now, they knew, so there would definitely be no one who would bid for it.

Sure enough, no one made a bid once they found out that stellar energy was required.

Tingyu glanced coldly at the room Yang Ye was in. She was just about to speak when a voice suddenly resounded, “6,000 divine crystals!”

Tingyu’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye’s room again because the voice had come from there.

A long period of silence filled the surroundings. There was still no one who made a bid.

Even though an Origin Rank technique was good, what was the point of obtaining it when it couldn’t be cultivated? 6,000 divine crystals weren’t a small amount.

A few breaths of time later, there were still no other bids.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “Miss Tingyu, does it belong to me now?”

Tingyu looked in Yang Ye’s direction for a short while before she smiled, “Of course!”

It didn’t take long for the Stellar Ward Technique to be sent to Yang Ye’s room. However, it was Tingyu who brought it to them.

Tingyu passed a scroll to Yang Ye and smiled, “Congratulations, Alliance Master Yang!”

Yang Ye’s eyes instantly narrowed slightly.
