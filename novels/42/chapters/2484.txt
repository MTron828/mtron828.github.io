Chapter 2485 – What the Heck?

The Primal True Dragon attacked!

All the demons watched as it slammed itself at Yang Ye!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then his figure turned completely ethereal as if it didn’t exist in this space.

Bang!

A moment later, Yang Ye was blasted away.

He flew over 10km away!

The dragon was stunned!

He’s not fighting back?

The dragon became quite anxious when it saw a trace of blood seep out from the corner of Yang Ye’s mouth. If Snowy and Erya found out that it had made Yang Ye bleed, it would be skinned alive!

While the dragon was feeling anxious and uneasy, Yang Ye crawled up from the ground and said, “Come on, continue!”

The dragon was stunned.

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and said, “Come! Don’t worry, you’re just training with me.”

It nodded when it noticed that Yang Ye didn’t seem to be lying, and it charged at Yang Ye again.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly as he stared at the dragon, and it didn’t take long for the dragon to slam against him.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted away once more!

This time, Yang Ye took a long time to get back on his feet. This time, blood wasn’t just coming out from his mouth, even his face had turned ghastly pale.

The dragon didn’t dare to attack when it noticed this. However, it had no choice when Yang Ye urged it to do so.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Just like that, Yang Ye was blasted away, over and over again. But it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to get up again and make the dragon attack once more.

As time passed, all the demons felt that Yang Ye had a thing for being hit!

…

Outside the Primordial Pagoda. There was quite a huge flow of people in and out of the inn.

At the counter, the beautiful woman gazed at the accounts before her, and the old man, the manager, stood before her.

She asked, “So?”

The old man replied softly, “They have agreed to it. However, they want 70% of the young man’s treasures once it’s done!”

70%!

The woman laughed coldly, “Aren’t they being a little too greedy?”

The old man laughed bitterly, “They’ve always been this greedy!”

The woman fell silent for a long time and said, “60%, that’s the most. If they want more, we will pull out.”

The manager nodded, “Alright!”

“Right.” She suddenly asked, “How many experts are they sending?”

The manager replied solemnly, “Just himself. He’s a Three World Realm expert. As far as he’s concerned, it’s guaranteed to succeed with us. Actually, he may think that just he alone is sufficient for it.”

The Three World Realm!

Her eyes narrowed slightly, “I’m afraid it may not be enough!”

The old man said, “He’s only at the True Void Realm. Even if he has trump cards, our forces and a Three World Realm expert should be enough, right?”

She shook her head, “He feels very dangerous to me. He isn’t ordinary. Ask him if he can contact some higher-ups of the Ancient Sword Sect. It’s best if success is absolutely guaranteed!”

The old man nodded and left.

Once the old man left, she looked up at the stairs and spoke softly, “Honest business never makes money as fast as robbing! So, you can only blame yourself for having such bad luck!”

…

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye was still training. Presently, his body was on the verge of collapse.

The dragon couldn’t bear to attack again.

Ten days later.

As always, the dragon charged at Yang Ye. While it was enveloped by the Sword Domain, causing it to sense a strand of pressure, it didn’t affect the dragon’s speed and strength!

It was very fast!

It practically took an instant to arrive before Yang Ye!

Right when the dragon slammed against Yang Ye…

Boom!

Suddenly, the dragon seemed like it had been struck by a sledgehammer and was blasted down from midair!

The dragon looked up at Yang Ye with bewilderment on its face!

Yang Ye took a deep breath while excitement filled his eyes. He waved at the dragon, “Continue!”

The dragon hesitated for a moment and charged at Yang Ye once more.

However, as soon as it did that, he was blasted to the ground before it could even react.

The dragon was utterly stunned!

Yang Ye’s laughter grew louder!

The Sword Domain!

Throughout this time, he’d been focused on a single thing, and it was to analyze his opponent with the Sword Domain. He was analyzing his opponent’s flaws, moves, and everything else!

Simply speaking, he’d completely analyzed his opponent and attacked based on what he’d discovered!

In the Sword Domain, he could sense everything! It could be said that it was like a huge brain, and this brain helped him analyze and sense everything. If someone was within the Sword Domain, it was like that person was stripped bare before him. That person was translucent and without any secrets!

In the beginning, when he tried to quickly analyze the dragon’s flaws and attack patterns, he found it to be quite difficult. Because the dragon was very fast and strong, he couldn’t accomplish it in an instant. But after training over a long period, and repeated trials and errors, Yang Ye had created a method. A method to swiftly detect his opponent’s flaws and attack pattern!

The method required him to merge into space and use the changes in space to sense his opponent!

Besides that, he’d changed the way his flying swords attacked too!

When he thought of the flying swords, Yang Ye gazed at the dragon and smiled, “Come, let’s continue!”

The dragon glanced at him and leaped up. At the same instant, the Sword Gourd on Yang Ye’s waist shook, and then a flying sword appeared above the dragon and pressed against its forehead.

The dragon was stunned speechless.

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, and then the flying sword kept appearing all over the Sword Domain. It wasn’t flying, it was just emerging out of space!

The flying swords didn’t fly in the Sword Domain, they used the space in the Sword Domain to teleport instantaneously. Moreover, they didn’t grow weaker and had grown stronger instead. Because they were using the powerful propulsion force in space, the enhancement provided by the Sword Domain, and the explosive force that came from the Sword Gourd.

It could be said that their speed and strength had risen a level higher!

The ability to detect flaws with the Sword Domain could be considered as a huge improvement to Yang Ye!

If he fought a Five World Realm expert again, while he didn’t dare to say he could kill such an expert with ease, it would absolutely not be that difficult as his last battle! Moreover, he was 80% confident in winning the battle!

Without using any external sources of strength!

Just his own pure strength!

Now, he just wanted to fight! Especially with An Nanjing! Because her combat instinct was extraordinary, and he wanted to know if he could suppress her with the Sword Domain!

An Nanjing!

Yang Ye dispersed the Sword Domain and looked up at the sky. He wondered how An Nanjing, Erya, and Snowy were doing!

A long time passed before he shook his head and smiled. Instead of worrying about them, he should worry about himself. He knew their strength well, and even a Five World Realm expert would be beaten up like a dog before them!

Suddenly, Yang Ye looked up at the sky and left the pagoda.

A voice came from outside the door, “Young Master, can I come in?”

It was the beautiful woman’s voice!

Yang Ye waved his right hand and the door opened. She grinned at Yang Ye and entered the room. She glanced at the surroundings and asked, “Were you cultivating?”

Yang Ye nodded, “What is it? Have the people of the Ancient Sword Sect arrived?”

She smiled, “Yes. Congratulations because we’ve contacted Elder Li of the Ancient Sword Sect, and he had agreed to meet you. Your own attainments aren’t bad, so if you are able to curry favor with Elder Li, then entering the Ancient Sword Sect will be practically guaranteed!”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “Thanks!”

She smiled, “Don’t mention it. I’ve gained quite a bit from you. Right, if it’s possible, can you come with me to meet Elder Li now?”

Yang Ye asked, “Is he not coming over here?”

She rolled her eyes at him, “Young Master, just think about his identity, and we are the ones seeking his help. How could he possibly come to us? It’s naturally we who have to go to him. Right?”

Yang Ye stood up, “Then we shall!”

She hesitated for a moment and asked, “Young Master, what’s your name?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Ye!”

She thought for a moment and asked, “There’s a clan in the South Region, the Ye Clan. Are you from there?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “No, I’m just an independent cultivator.”

While she didn’t really believe him, she didn’t ask further.

It didn’t take long for them to leave the inn, and then she led Yang Ye out of the city toward a mountain range.

Yang Ye asked, “He’s outside the city?”

She smiled, “Elder Li prefers quiet places, so he set the meeting point outside the city.”

He's fond of quiet places!

Yang Ye glanced at her, smiled, and didn’t say anything.

However, the woman’s heart shuddered for some reason!

It didn’t take long for them to arrive deep within the mountains, and there was no one here for miles.

She led Yang Ye deep into a forest, and Yang Ye saw a middle aged man in a gray robe.

Obviously, it was Elder Li!

Elder Li glanced at Yang Ye and asked, “You want to join the Ancient Sword Sect?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Senior, please…”

The old man suddenly waved his hand, “I’ll be frank. A Treasure Seeking Mouse sensed the aura of various treasures including Divine Treasures in your possession. Are you going to hand them over, or shall I take them instead?”

Yang Ye was stunned for a moment, and then he gazed at the beautiful woman. At this moment, there was no smile on her face, only extreme coldness.

Yang Ye’s face turned pale as he pointed at her with a trembling hand, “W-What are you planning?!”

She replied indifferently, “What are we planning? You fool! Have you not realized? We plan to rob you!”

“Rob me?” Yang Ye suddenly spoke angrily, “D-Do you not respect the law? Do you not respect reason? You’re actually trying to rob me in broad daylight?! W-W-What are you waiting for then?! Hurry up and do it!”

The woman was stunned speechless.
