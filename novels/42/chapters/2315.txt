Chapter 2316 – I Didn’t Steal, I Took!

Yang Ye had recovered his consciousness?

That was the first thought that came to mind for Bai Zhixian, but it didn’t take long for her to reject that thought.

Because Yang Ye didn’t seem like he’d regained consciousness.

The woman didn’t resist him, and a long time passed before she suddenly said, “Actually, I really want to kill you!”

Bai Zhixian’s expression changed, and she hurriedly ran over and pulled Yang Ye to her side.

The woman spoke softly, “There’s a saying amongst the humans. Even the heavens would be disappointed if a man does not act for himself. Her presence by your side fills me with fear, fear that you’ll harm her one day. She would have nothing to worry about if you’re gone, and she’ll live a better life.”

Bai Zhixian gazed vigilantly at the woman, “Senior, he may be mad, but he isn’t bad.”

The woman spoke softly, “That’s what I’m curious about too. She’s kindhearted by nature, so how could she possibly be with a monstrous murderer? I thought about it for a long time, but I couldn’t figure it out, so I stopped thinking about it.”

She stood up slowly as she spoke.

Suddenly, Yang Ye pulled Bai Zhixian behind him, and a pitch black sword appeared in his grasp.

He sensed hostility!

The woman turned around and walked slowly in Yang Ye and Bai Zhixian’s direction. Suddenly, Bai Zhixian pulled Yang Ye behind her, and she looked the woman in the eyes, “Senior, I don’t know why you want to kill him, but I want to ask you something. Do you really think that person you spoke of wants you to kill him?”

The woman stopped.

Bai Zhixian continued, “Senior, there are a lot of times that when you think you’re doing something for the good of someone, it isn’t something that person wants.”

The woman remained silent.

Meanwhile, Bai Zhixian continued, “Senior, have you not noticed? He isn’t in a normal state right now. But he got close to you just now. Obviously, he sensed something from you, and it was absolutely something he really, really cares about. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have acted like that. Just like me, he thinks I’m one of his wives, so while he attacks everyone else he seems, he never harms me and even protects me with his life!”

The woman shook her head slightly, “He may not know what she is right now, and I can’t guarantee that he wouldn’t do anything bad when he does find out.”

Bai Zhixian suddenly smiled.

The woman asked, “Why are you smiling?”

Bai Zhixian smiled, “Senior, he doesn’t even know what she is, yet he cares so much about her. So, what does that represent? It represents that he cares about her, not because of what she can give him. Right?”

The woman gazed at Bai Zhixian, “I won’t kill you. You can leave yourself, or I can send you away.”

Bai Zhixian chuckled, “That isn’t necessary. While we are no match for you, we still want to try!”

The woman said, “I told you that I’ll send you out of here.”

Bai Zhixian looked the woman in the eyes, “As I said before, that isn’t necessary. We came here together, and we’ll either leave together or die together.”

The woman nodded slightly, “Then I’ll fulfill your wish.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she raised her hand slowly. In an instant, a strand of white mist enveloped Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye raised his sword and swung it.

Hiss!

The black sword exploded apart, and countless vengeful spirits seemed like they’d encountered something terrifying and surged into the blood red saber in his palm. At the same time, the madness intent within him had been instantly suppressed before it could even surge out of him.

Meanwhile, a wave of powerful aura swept out of Bai Zhixian. However, it vanished without a trace before it could even get close to the woman in a white dress!

Bai Zhixian’s face turned pale. The woman wasn’t someone they could rival in strength!

Bai Zhixian gazed at Yang Ye whose face was covered in pain right now, “If this is the end, so be it.”

She closed her eyes slowly.

Suddenly, a ray of black light flashed.

Hiss!

The black light instantly shattered the energy that enveloped Yang Ye!

Meanwhile, a voice resounded, “Sprite Progenitor, killing the innocent isn’t your style!”

As soon as the voice resounded, a black shadow suddenly appeared near Yang Ye and Bai Zhixian. The shadow was huge, but it wasn’t human, and it was covered in countless strands of black energy that obscured its true form from them.

Sprite Progenitor!

Bai Zhixian gazed at the woman with astonishment!

Sprite Progenitor!

She’d never seen a Sprite Progenitor, but she’d heard of one. It was a supreme expert in the entire universe. There were records about them in the ancient texts, and such Sprite Progenitors were only ever born on the other side of the Eternal River!

There had never been one in Eternal Border!

She had never imagined that this woman before her was actually a Sprite Progenitor of legend!

There was a Sprite Progenitor here!

The woman withdrew her hands and gazed at the black shadow, “Nine Hells Emperor, what brought you here today? And you actually saved someone!”

The black shadow chuckled, “I noticed them as soon as they entered that battlefield.”

She asked, “Why didn’t you kill them?”

Nine Hells Emperor replied with a question, “Why should I?”

The woman in a white dress glanced at Nine Hell Emperor and said, “Didn’t you say that the people of that village are not allowed to step foot in that battlefield, and you’ll kill all who do?”

Nine Hells Emperor roared with laughter, “But these kids aren’t ordinary. Especially this kid. Sprite Progenitor, oh Sprite Progenitor, do you think that only you can sense her aura? In the beginning, I wasn’t completely certain, but when he got here, I was sure. As for trying to kill him, I presume it’s because you’re afraid I’ll notice her through him, right?”

The woman clenched her fists slowly.

“Thinking of attacking me?” Nine Hells Emperor chuckled, “If this was your main body, I would run as far as I can. Unfortunately, it’s just a strand of your soul.”

Meanwhile, the woman relaxed her grasp, “It’s fine, you can’t leave either.”

Nine Hells Emperor replied indifferently, “Why would I go outside? I just have to take a few strands of his soul, then once he regains his consciousness in the world outside, he’ll naturally bring the Sprite Progenitor here, right?”

Suddenly, the woman waved her hand, and a strand of white mist enveloped Yang Ye and Bai Zhixian. An instant later, they were tossed into the sky. Suddenly, a black hand appeared there.

Bang!

An explosion resounded in the sky. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The white mist that surrounded them instantly exploded apart, and then were blasted away!

“You think you can send them away?” Cold laughter resounded in the sky, and then a hand grabbed at them.

Meanwhile, a white shadow appeared before them.

It was the Sprite Progenitor!

The Sprite Progenitor glanced at Yang Ye and Bai Zhixian, “Take him and leave. Once he regains consciousness, tell him to take good care of her.”

Once she finished speaking, she looked up and raised her hands slowly. In an instant, the entire world turned ethereal, and then she took a step forward and gently tapped forward.

Hiss!

The space before her cracked open. At the same time, a wave of invisible force moved along space and rippled toward the black hand.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the hand exploded into bits. Meanwhile, the powerful force of the collision pushed Nine Hells Emperor back.

While this occurred, the Sprite Progenitor had helped transport Yang Ye and Bai Zhixian through the sky, and they’d arrived in the village.

“You’re mad!” Nine Hells Emperor’s voice resounded, “Aren’t you afraid that you’ll vanish from exhausting that little bit of your soul that remains?”

The Sprite Progenitor glanced at her slightly ethereal body, and then looked up at the sky. A black shadow stood there.

The Sprite Progenitor replied indifferently, “So what if I do? It’s just a strand of soul.”

“You’re absolutely mad!” The black shadow cursed, and then it charged toward the village.

The Sprite Progenitor was just a strand of soul.

But even someone as strong as Nine Hells Emperor didn’t dare to kill her. He was from the Primal Era. While he was just a youngling at the time, he’d witnessed the death of a Sprite Progenitor, the death of the woman’s main body. Moreover, he’d witnessed the consequences for the person who killed her.

He would never forget it!

The Sprite Progenitor wasn’t something that anyone could just kill.

He didn’t linger on that scene from the past, and he just shot past her and gave chase in the village’s direction.

Eternal Village.

Bang! Bang!

Two figures slammed into the village. It was Yang Ye and Bai Zhixian.

It didn’t take long for Wang Erya’s grandfather, the slovenly old man, Butcher, and Auntie Vege to arrive before them.

Yang Ye crawled up from the ground and helped Bai Zhixian up, and then he pushed her behind Auntie Vege before turning around with his sword in hand.

Bang!

A wave of powerful intent swept out from him.

He was no match for his opponent, but he still planned to fight!

It didn’t take long for the others’ expressions to change slightly. They looked up into the sky, and they saw a black shadow arrive soundlessly.

Their expressions instantly turned solemn at the sight of it.

Nine Hells Emperor!

They clearly recognized the black shadow.

Meanwhile, Nine Hells Emperor spoke abruptly, “I want that kid!”

His voice carried an indisputable tone.

The four of them exchanged glances, and then the other three gazed at Wang Erya’s grandfather. The latter grinned and said, “What else can we do? Fight, of course!”

Fight!

All four of them looked up.

At this exact same moment.

Eternal Border, Eternal Immortal City.

A middle aged man in a cloud white robe appeared at the entrance to the city, and he held a sword in his grasp.

He walked into the city and arrived before the entrance to Eternal Secret Realm.

There were 7 True Void Realm and 17 True Dao Realm experts here!

As soon as he saw the middle aged man, Wang Yun from Immortal Estate had a grim expression on his face. He stood up and looked at the middle aged man, “You’re the sword cultivator who stole a precious treasure from my Immortal Estate!”

The others were shocked and gazed at the middle aged man.

There was curiosity and ill intent in their eyes.

If they could kill this sword cultivator and make the Immortal Estate owe them a favor, they felt that it was a good trade!

Meanwhile, the middle aged man looked up slowly at Wang Yun and said, “Stole?”

He shook his head slightly, “Allow me to correct you. I didn’t steal, I took!”
