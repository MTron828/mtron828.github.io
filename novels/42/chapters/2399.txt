Chapter 2400 – An Nanjing!

Needless to say, Yang Ye was quite shocked!

A Three World Realm expert!

Three World Realm experts weren’t common. He remembered Nanli Meng saying that practically all Three World Realm experts were at the Eternal River. So, the Three World Realm expert who’d come for him was clearly from Eternal River.

However, Cloud Residence had a Three World Realm expert too, and that was quite unusual!

What was A’Leng’s identity?

The robust man had chains coiled around his arms, and he waved his hands around as he stood there high above in the clouds, causing the chains to sweep through the clouds.

An old man in a luxurious robe stood deep within the clouds, and he held a black umbrella. Every wave of it made countless rays of black light rain down from above.

Rumble!

The entire sky shook violently and seemed like it was about to collapse.

A’Leng spoke softly, “Lock down the area!”

Right Sword and Left Sword nodded slightly, and then they left. It didn’t take long for them to appear in the sky with four flags in their grasps. They tossed the flags forward, and the flags appeared in four corners of the area.

Bang!

In an instant, the surroundings calmed down.

However, the battle was still going on outside. But no matter how the two of them fought there, no fluctuations entered the area!

Snowy’s eyes lit up when she saw the flags, and she seemed itching to get them. Meanwhile, A’Leng smiled, “Little Fellow, those four flags are treasures passed down in my family, so don’t try to take them!”

While she was saying that to Snowy, she was actually talking to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at Snowy and shook his head. Snowy puckered her lips and pointed at the flags to indicate that they were very good!

Yang Ye spoke seriously, “They belong to her!”

Snowy blinked and waved her paws. So was saying that they could become hers instead!

Yang Ye had quite the headache, “What kind of shameless logic is that? Who taught you that?”

Snowy pointed at Yang Ye to indicate that he did!

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

In the end, Snowy didn’t try to tempt those flags to follow her because Yang Ye was against it. If she really did that, Yang Ye was certain that the four flags wouldn’t be able to escape her paws. But even a bandit had to have principles!

A’Leng glanced at Snowy and Yang Ye, and then she smiled, “Young Master Yang, this Sprite Progenitor of yours is different from what I imagined!”

It wasn’t just difficult, it was absolutely different from what she’d expected!

Snowy was just a cute pet!

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head gently, “I wish she was just an ordinary Sprite Lord. Being a Sprite Progenitor is too tiring!”

A’Leng smiled and didn’t say anything.

Snowy hugged Yang Ye’s head and rubbed her head against it, and she didn’t pay further attention to the flags.

A long time passed before Yang Ye looked up at the sky and said, “Miss A’Leng, these injuries of yours…” She’d almost exhausted all his Primordial Violet Energy!

She pulled her hand away, “Sorry, I was too greedy!”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Is all that Primordial Violet Energy insufficient to treat your injuries?”

She shook her head, “I’m afraid it’s far from enough!”

Yang Ye frowned!

Meanwhile, A’Leng smiled, “How about we do this? I won’t take your Primordial Violet Energy for free. I can help you deal with the powers from Eternal Border while you’re treating me. If I’m not wrong, you need time right now. The more time you have, the stronger you can be, and you’ll have a greater chance at success. Right?”

Yang Ye looked toward the sky and spoke softly, “Miss A’Leng, your identity and strength have really surprised me.”

She grinned, “What do you think about my suggestion?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Deal!”

Just as she’d said, he lacked time the most!

A'Leng grinned, and then she looked up at the sky, “It’s over!”

As soon as she finished speaking, a ray of light flashed in the sky, and then the robust man appeared before her. He went down on one knee and said, “Forgive me, I failed to kill him!”

A'Leng shook her head, “He had the aura of the Eternal River. Anyone able to survive there isn’t ordinary, so it’s normal that you were unable to kill him!”

A'Da lowered his head slightly, “Forgive me!”

She smiled, “Go on with your own work!”

He nodded and vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye suddenly said, “Miss A’Leng, you’re not from Eternal Border?”

She smiled, “Not really! As for where I’m from, I can’t tell you!”

Yang Ye smiled and didn’t pursue an answer. After that, he started to heal her every day. Besides that, he returned to the Southern Desolate Lands to seek guidance from Wu Ni and Martial Ancestor.

Yang Ye finally understood the difference between having a master and not having one now!

Having a master represented having guidance, and guidance represented the ability to avoid many mistaken paths. While Martial Ancestor and Wu Ni were no sword cultivators, their attainments in the Martial Dao was absolutely not something Yang Ye could compare to! There was some overlap between the Martial Dao and Sword Dao, especially some techniques.

Actually, his greatest gain was his flying swords. Now, even Two World Realm experts couldn’t resist them anymore!

Not long after Yang Ye left Cloud Residence, an old man in a luxurious robe appeared before the bamboo house. The old man glanced at the surroundings, and then gazed at the bamboo house, “Can we talk?”

A voice came from within the bamboo house, “Two weeks, don’t touch him for two weeks. After that, you can resolve your enmity on your own!”

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Two weeks is enough for him to do a lot, like grow a little stronger.”

“Did you not hear me?” The voice within the house grew slightly icy cold.

The old man grinned, “I’m here on behalf of many people, and there are 7 Three World Experts among them. As for the Two World Realm experts, I don’t have to say much about that. Besides that, some are already on the way to Divine Martial World, including Xiao Shenwu. According to my knowledge, he desires the Sprite Progenitor. Are you really going to stop us?”

The door to the bamboo house suddenly opened, and then a jade token appeared before the old man.

The old man was stunned when he saw it.

Meanwhile, a voice came from within, “Tell them I said to wait for two weeks. Come see me if they don’t want to wait.”

The old man took a deep and long glance at the jade token. In the end, he bowed respectfully and said, “If you say two weeks, then two weeks it is. We won’t act against him in these two weeks. I apologize for my offense. Farewell!”

He turned around and vanished into the end.

Silence fell upon Cloud Residence.

The Southern Desolate Lands. Within the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground.

Cultivate!

Presently, he didn’t want to waste even a moment of his time!

Three World Realm experts had come from Eternal Border, and that meant the experts in Eternal River had started to rush over. He was very well aware that there was definitely more than one Three World Realm expert, and there may even be Four World and Five World Realm experts!

He had to grow stronger!

His strongest attacks right now were the Sword Domain and the flying swords from the Sword Gourd! Simply speaking, if he couldn’t kill with these two moves, then he would be killed instead!

Of course, he had many Divine Treasures like the True Energy Mirror and Seal of Suppression. If he used all of them, even a Three World Realm expert would be of no threat to him. Of course, it was a different story if he had to face many of them.

As for Four World Realm experts, he hadn’t fought one, so he didn’t know how strong they were!

Suddenly, Yang Ye opened his eyes, and then he left the pagoda and appeared on the cliff.

Yang Ye bowed to the two old men, and Wu Ni said, “She’s back!”

An Nanjing is back!

Yang Ye was delighted and hurriedly asked, “Where is she?”

Wu Ni replied indifferently, “At the outer area of the Hell World. She seems to be in trouble, so get her. Any objections?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “None at all!”

Wu Ni nodded, “Be careful!”Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Be careful!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. Wu Ni had told him to be careful. Obviously, the trouble she faced was no ordinary trouble!

Suddenly, Wu Ni waved his right hand and Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Martial Ancestor suddenly said, “You’re pushing him into the fire!”

Wu Ni replied indifferently, “Just cultivating like this is useless. If he doesn’t experience some life and death, it doesn’t matter how seriously or painstakingly he cultivates, it won’t change much. Battles, battles of life and death are the best to temper someone.”

Martial Ancestor smiled, “That’s true! However, that kid doesn’t have a very good temper. Aren’t you afraid that he’ll act rashly?”

“What?” Wu Ni replied indifferently, “His temper will get much better once he meets those madmen!”

Martial Ancestor shook his head and smiled without saying another word.

At an expanse of the starry sky, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and was quite bewildered. Wu Ni had tossed him here just now.

A short while later, Yang Ye looked up, and there was a huge black vortex in the distance, and it covered the entire area.

Suddenly, Yang Ye saw a person there, and he was overjoyed.

It was An Nanjing!

However, ferocity instantly covered Yang Ye’s face just a moment later. An Nanjing’s left arm was gone, and her entire body was covered in injuries. Especially her stomach, blood was surging from there.

There were five shadows behind her, and they were madly chasing after her!

Ferocity curled up on Yang Ye’s lips. In an instant, a ray of red light swept out from him, and then he turned blood red!
