Chapter 2494 – Yang Ye? Who’s That?

Very strong!

Everyone gazed at him. Isn’t that a little too arrogant?

The young man was stunned for a moment and chuckled, “Good, very good. Let me see how strong you are!”

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath and just flashed over to the young man before swinging a punch!

The young man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he too swung a punch at Yang Ye!

He had really never feared anyone in the same realm of cultivation when it was a melee battle!

However, his expression changed drastically when his fist came into contact with Yang Ye’s fist.

Bang!

The young man was blasted over 300m away.

But Yang Ye didn’t stop. He appeared before the young man again, and then he stomped his foot down at the young man.

The young man didn’t dare to act carelessly. He took a step back, and then his figure soared into the air before he slammed his fist at Yang Ye.

Boom!

A wave of powerful energy rippled out from his fist, causing space to shudder. Moreover, a wave of powerful fist energy appeared on his fist!

But Yang Ye wasn’t pushed back at all!

Bang!

An explosion resounded in the sky, and space shook violently as if an earthquake was running through it.

A few dozen breaths of time passed before space gradually calmed down.

They didn’t attack each other again!

The young man glanced at his trembling hand and gazed at Yang Ye, “You pass!”

Pass!

Yang Ye glanced at his own hand, and it was trembling slightly too. Needless to say, the experts in the War Dimension were of an extremely high standard. So, it would probably be very difficult for him to defeat the young man if he relied on his physical strength alone.

But it was normal because they would be fighting against the desolate race in the future, so how could they possibly be weak?

The young man glanced at the others down below, “Who else?”

Mo Ya suddenly stepped forward and smiled, “Let me try!”

She tapped her foot against the ground and instantly transformed into a ray of sword energy that surged up into the air.

The young man was about to attack when she suddenly vanished on the spot, and this made the young man’s expression changed drastically. He immediately pushed his palms out toward both sides.

Bang!

A wave of powerful energy rippled out with him at its center!

At this moment, the space around the area turned ethereal!

No one could see the battlefield clearly!

A few breaths of time later, the space there returned to normal. At this moment, Mo Ya had returned to where she was.

The young man took a deep and long glance at her, “I made a mistake!”

She nodded slightly and didn’t say anything.

The others here were stunned, and they wondered how she’d just passed like that!

Yang Ye glanced at Mo Ya. Others may not have been able to see it clearly, but he did. Mo Ya had defeated the young man with a single attack!

A very strange attack!

It was quite extraordinary!

“Let me try too!” Meanwhile, another man stepped forward.

It was Xue Yiren!

Xue Yiren cupped his fist at the young man, and then a sword suddenly shot out from the sheath by his waist. The sword was like a bolt of lightning that shot at the young man.

A flying sword!𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

At the instant the flying sword shot forward, the young man tapped a finger forward, causing space to ripple.

Bang!

The powerful energy contained within the flying sword pushed the young man backward, but the flying sword itself suddenly appeared behind the young man instead.

However, the young man’s reaction was extremely swift, and he immediately turned around and swung a punch.

A wave of powerful fist energy rippled forth from his fist, but it wasn’t able to repulse the flying sword. Conversely, the young man was pushed backward repeatedly!

This time, the flying sword didn’t follow up with another attack, and it just turned around and returned to Xue Yiren’s sheath.

Xue Yiren cupped his fist, “It was a good battle!”

The young man glanced at Xue Yiren, and then he gazed at the others, “Anyone else?”

None of the others stepped forward.

The young man spoke indifferently, “Since no one else is stepping forward, all of you can return. Otherwise, you’ll just be giving your lives away!”

The other disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect had quite a bit of dejection on their faces. They had come here full of hope, yet now, they were heading back without even entering the War Dimension. It was a terrible feeling no matter who experienced it.

Yang Ye and the others didn’t say anything. Just as the young man had said, it was best to head home if their strength was insufficient. Otherwise, they would probably just be courting death.

Meanwhile, Tie Yuan stepped forward and glanced at Yang Ye and the others, “Congratulations. Be careful in there.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Take care!”

Tie Yuan grinned, “We’ll meet again in the sect!”

He led the others away on their swords.

The young man said, “The four of you can come with me!”

As he spoke, he formed a strange seal with both hands, and then a teleportation formation appeared nearby. A short while later, all five of them entered it.

The War Dimension!

In the teleportation passageway, the young man said, “You’ve joined the War Dimension. Of course, you’re still disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect, but once you receive orders from the War Dimension during the war with the desolate race, you must come to the War Dimension immediately and receive your orders.”

Mo Ya suddenly asked, “Will there be any conflicts between the War Dimension and our sect?”

The young man replied indifferently, “The War Dimension is a place jointly created by the Eternal Lord and the entire Eternal Kingdom. It transcends all others! Under normal circumstances, there won’t be any conflict because your target is the desolate race!”

“The desolate race?” Mo Ya frowned slightly, “It’s just the desolate race. Do we have to treat them so seriously?”

The young man glanced at her, “Put thoughts like that away. Otherwise, you’ll die before you even know it!”

Mo Ya frowned, but she didn’t say anything. Obviously, she’d realized some things.

If the desolate race really was that weak, then why would Eternal Kingdom spend countless resources on this mysterious War Dimension?

Obviously, they wouldn’t!

Meanwhile, the young man added, “I heard the number one genius of your Ancient Sword Sect, Gu Yuexian, is at the Five World Realm?”

Xue Yiren replied, “War Dimension has heard of Senior Brother Gu too?”

The young man nodded, “We know every genius of the Eternal Kingdom well. We extended an olive branch to Gu Yuexian, but he didn’t come!”

Xue Yiren asked, “Why?”

The young man replied indifferently, “At that time, his reason was that he was on the verge of advancement. But now, he has no reason not to come.”

Xue Yiren asked, “Do you summon people by force?”

The young man glanced at him, “Eternal Kingdom doesn’t belong to a single person, it belongs to everyone. Gu Yuexian has a responsibility to protect Eternal Kingdom. He isn’t the only one, all of us have the same responsibility. We would have nothing without Eternal Kingdom. If the desolate race defeats Eternal Kingdom, your Ancient Sword Sect or whatever clan you represent will cease to exist, won’t they?”

He looked up into the distance and continued, “All those years ago, the master of your Ancient Sword Sect led a few dozen powerful sword cultivators in battle to stop the desolate race. During that battle, your sect lost a few dozen sword cultivators, your Super Divine Treasure was destroyed, and even your sect master himself lost his body. That is why the Ancient Sword Sect is allowed to send people here today, and it’s also why your sect is respected by the world. Isn’t it?”

Needless to say, the young man was right!

The Ancient Sword Sect had suffered tremendous losses during the battle and had almost been annihilated. However, no power had targeted the Ancient Sword Sect after the war, and its status had grown even greater in Eternal Kingdom.

There was a War Tablet in the Central Region of Eternal Kingdom, and it was around 300m tall. On it were the names of all the experts who’d lost their lives during the war. The Ancient Sword Sect had almost 100 names on it, so it was a very huge and striking amount!

Meanwhile, the young man suddenly said, “Speaking of sword cultivators makes me think of someone, a man called Yang Ye!”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned and gazed at the young man.

He knows about me?

“Yang Ye?” Mo Ya asked, “Who’s that?”

The young man replied, “A sword cultivator who killed a Five World Realm expert while at the True Void Realm!”

A Five World Realm expert at the True Void Realm!

Mo Ya was astounded, “That’s impossible!”

The young man nodded, “I think it’s impossible too. However, that’s the news we received.”

Xue Yiren suddenly asked, “Why haven’t we heard of such a genius?”

The young man replied, “Because he’s from Eternal Border, or as we call them, he’s one of the people on the outside!”

Mo Ya frowned slightly, “An outsider? Impossible! The spirit energy there is scarce, and there’s no Eternal Energy. How could such a genius exist? Is it just an exaggerated rumor?”

The young man replied, “Perhaps. However, he isn’t ordinary. He has a Sprite Progenitor with him. I really don’t understand why a Sprite Progenitor would stay with him.”

A Sprite Progenitor!

All of them were truly shocked when they heard this.

A Sprite Progenitor!

They may not know about the desolate race or Yang Ye, but they knew about the Sprite Progenitor!

The Sprite Progenitor had once been the symbol of the Eternal Kingdom!

The progenitor of all sprites!

The young man continued, “Let’s forget the Sprite Progenitor and focus on Yang Ye himself. If the rumors are true, then it’s quite terrifying that he’s able to kill a Five World Realm expert while at the True Void Realm. Such a person can’t be allowed to live when he is hostile toward our Eternal Kingdom. Of course, he won’t be allowed to live. Some people in the War Dimension have already requested to be sent to kill him.”

Yang Ye just followed the group in silence.
