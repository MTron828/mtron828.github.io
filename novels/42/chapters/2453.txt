Chapter 2454 – Brainless!

In the Primordial Pagoda!

After they consumed the Chaotic Fruit, Oxxy and the others returned to their territories, and then powerful auras seeped out from the mountain range.

Advancement!

The Chaotic Fruits revealed their potency once more!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was cultivating madly in the cultivation room too. His Divine Avatar Technique was gradually working.

A month later.

A powerful aura surged up into the sky and shook the world around it.

The aura of a Four World Realm demon!

Oxxy!

It was Oxxy who’d advanced!

Oxxy’s advancement was the greatest. He advanced into the Four World Realm!

Once he advanced, Oxxy went to the Ascension Platform with the Primordial Axe of Creation on his back. Snowy was there right now, and she grinned as she gazed at Oxxy. It was because Oxxy had grown stronger!

Oxxy nodded slightly and stood respectfully behind Snowy.

Bang!

Meanwhile, another powerful aura surged up into the air from the distant mountain range, and it carried a dense vicious aura.

The Primal Vicious Tiger!

Roar!

A tiger roar resounded abruptly from the mountain range, and then a black shadow descended onto the Ascension Platform.

It was the Primal Vicious Tiger!

The Four World Realm!

At this moment, the Primal Vicious Tiger was at the Four World Realm, and the peak of it too!

The tiger glanced at Snowy and Oxxy, nodded slightly, and stood respectfully at the side. At this moment, its viciousness was much lesser.

On the Ascension Platform, the two demon beasts and Snowy were looking at the distant mountain range. They waited for quite some time before a powerful aura dispersed from there, and the space there shook violently.

A short while later, a demon descended upon the Ascension Platform. It was the Martial Qilin!

The Martial Qilin’s aura was very powerful and a little oppressive. However, once it arrived at the Ascension Platform, its aura gradually calmed down. It nodded to Snowy and the others before standing silently at the side.

Three Four World Realm demons!

Snowy’s smile grew even more brilliant!

However, there was one more!

Snowy looked into the distance, there was a dragon there! Snowy and the others waited and waited, yet after waiting for so long, the dragon still didn’t come over! In the end, Snowy couldn’t wait any longer and went to the dragon’s territory. She was furious when she saw the Primal True Dragon!

It was sleeping!

At this moment, the Primal True Dragon was sleeping on a huge rock!

Snowy flew over to the dragon’s head and kicked it.

The other demons felt speechless.

The Primal True Dragon shook its head and continued sleeping.

This made Snowy even more furious!

The dragon didn’t meet her expectations!

Snowy waved her paw and the Primordial Axe of Creation on Oxxy’s back flew into her grasp. She held it in her arms and pressed it against the dragon’s head. However, she seemed to have thought of something and flipped it so that its back was pressed against the dragon’s head. After that, she kept rubbing it against the dragon’s head like she was trying to saw it open.

It didn’t take long for the dragon to open its eyes, and it hurried up to its feet when it saw Snowy.

Snowy glared at the dragon, pointed at Oxxy and the others, and then pointed at the dragon. What she was trying to convey was obvious!

The Primal True Dragon glanced at Oxxy and the others. At this moment, they were all at the Four World Realm, just like it!

The dragon felt really helpless!

It was easy to advance from the Three World Realm to the Four World Realm, but it was very difficult to ascend to the Five World Realm!

After it swallowed the Chaotic Fruit, it had ascended to the peak of the Four World Realm, and it was much stronger than before! However, it couldn’t advance to the Five World Realm!

The Five World Realm wasn’t that easily attained!

Unfortunately, Snowy didn’t understand that principle, and she felt that the dragon had been slacking off!

So, the Primal True Dragon suffered. Snowy chased it all over the pagoda with the axe in her arms!

Oxxy and the others felt quite a bit of pity as they watched it flee, but did it have anything to do with them?

Meanwhile, An Nanjing sat by a pool, and there was a spear by her side.

It was the spear, Nameless!

During this time, those demons weren’t the only ones who’d improved tremendously, An Nanjing had improved greatly too. The books she’d read in the Martial Pavilion and Dao Pavilion had been committed to her memory and merged into one with her.

She’d removed the excess and absorbed the essence of them all!

It could be said that An Nanjing had improved tremendously throughout this period!

However, perhaps only she could guess how strong she was right now.

In the cultivation room, Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground and just sat there. A long time passed before he suddenly opened his eyes, and then another copy of him appeared on his right.

Both Yang Ye’s exchanged glances, and then one of them vanished!

Yang Ye stood up!

He’d succeeded!

He'd truly succeeded!

After months of bitter training, he’d finally succeeded at cultivating the Divine Avatar Technique!

It could be said that he had another trump card now!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and left the pagoda.

It was time to leave!

At the entrance of Desolate City.

Huang Ying walked over to Yang Ye, “Brother Yang, are you sure about leaving?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Why?”

Huang Ying replied solemnly, “Brother Yang, if I’m not wrong, Eternal Kingdom is definitely waiting for you out there. If you go now, they will never let you live! Especially when you’re friends with my desolate race, that will only make them more determined to kill you! You’ll be very safe here instead!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Can the desolate race protect me forever?”

Huang Ying fell silent.

Yang Ye said, “Brother Huang Ying, I appreciate your kind intentions. I’ve always believed that a person can only rely on himself! If I entrust my future hope to someone else, that’s a foolish thing to do. As for Eternal Kingdom, if I’m no match for them, I can still escape, right?”

Huang Ying glanced at him and said, “Since you’ve made up your mind, then I won’t try to dissuade you. Take care.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Take care!”

He turned around and walked away. Suddenly, Huang Ying flicked a talisman over to Yang Ye.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Yang Ye asked, “What is this?”

Huang Ying smiled, “Crush it if you need help.”

Yang Ye didn’t refuse. He just cupped his fist and left.

Huang Ying watched Yang Ye go further and further away, and it didn’t take long for him to notice a white little fellow appear on Yang Ye’s shoulder!

The Sprite Progenitor!

Huang Ying shook his head slightly, “A storm of blood is coming!”

He knew that once Yang Ye left the Desolate World, he would cause another storm of blood.

However, Yang Ye wasn’t the same Yang Ye anymore!

…

Yang Ye left the Desolate World and used the teleportation formation to arrive at Hell World.

The Demon Wings of Death!

As soon as he arrived at Hell World, Yang Ye thought of the Demon Wings of Death, and it made his heart hurt. It was because he hadn’t been able to keep it in his possession, and it had become Erya’s possession. According to her, she was slow and needed it!

She was slow!

Yang Ye almost slapped her flying! Because she dared to use such a lousy excuse!

However, he still gave it to her in the end!

Because he noticed that only she could fully utilize its strength!

The Demon Wings of Death were too fast. Even his body couldn’t endure its speed. Even though he’d used it the other day, he hadn’t used it to its full potential!

It was because the wings were too fast, so fast that they could tear open his body! His body had almost been torn apart when he used it that day!

But Erya wouldn’t suffer the same fate!

Her body was terrifyingly strong!

It was so terrifying that even if she used it to its full potential, the speed of it wouldn’t tear open her body! Moreover, her explosive force was simply beyond terrifying once she used the wings. She was like a human cannonball! As for profound energy, while Erya didn’t have profound energy, she had a bunch of World Crystals. So, she just had to feed it World Crystals to store up energy within it. So, it could just use that profound energy when Erya wanted to use it!

In short, the Demon Wings of Death suited Erya better!

While it hurt, it wasn’t that bad because Erya was one of his own!

As for Snowy, she actually didn’t care who got it in the end. Because all of them were hers, and she could use any Divine Treasure as she pleased. In any case, she considered them all hers!

Yang Ye stopped thinking about that, glanced at the surroundings, and shot toward Eternal Border.

He planned to take Erya to Eternal Village first!

He too wanted to pay a visit to Butcher, Auntie Vege, and the slovenly old man who was always drinking!

Of course, there was that demon beast there too, Nine Hell Emperor!

When Yang Ye arrived at the entrance to Eternal Border, the space around him shook abruptly, and then a green barrier enveloped the area around him!

Along with the arrival of the barrier, the space in the surroundings started to tremble! It was solidifying!

The space around Yang Ye had started to turn solid, and a green cage seemed to appear around that expanse of space!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “I didn’t expect you to be so fast!”

A woman walked over slowly from nearby. There were six mysterious armored experts behind her!

It was that group from Eternal Kingdom!

They walked closer to Yang Ye, “I didn’t expect the desolate race to not only let you live and keep the Sprite Progenitor, they even let you leave. I’m truly surprised. Can you tell me why they did that?

Yang Ye glanced at her chest and shook his head, “Don’t they say those with big chests are brainless? Yours doesn’t look very big! So, why don’t you have any brains?”

The woman’s face instantly became gloomy.
