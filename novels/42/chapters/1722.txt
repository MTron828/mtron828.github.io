Chapter 1723 - It Won’t Be Long!

Yang Ye’s visit to the Lu Clan was no secret, so it quickly spread throughout the medium universe of Milky Way System.

However, the fact that the Lu Clan had lost a few True Realm experts hadn’t spread. Besides that, news of Yang Ye’s fight with Lu Yuntian hadn’t spread as well.

Obviously, the Lu Clan had sealed off all information about it.

But that wasn’t what everyone was paying attention to. What they cared about was that Yang Ye had shown himself at the Lu Clan.

It didn’t take long for many to rush towards the area.

There were always brave people in the face of abundant rewards. Yang Ye’s head was worth so much, so many refused to give up. Even if they knew that Yang Ye was definitely not an ordinary person, they still refused to give up. As far as many were concerned, Yang Ye’s head was an opportunity for them. He was a living precious treasure, and an opportunity to become strong!

Wealth could make people lose their minds!

…

Yang Ye didn’t stay near the Lu Clan, and he immediately left Skyfire System.

In the boundless starry sky, Yang Ye found a safe spot and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Heal!

He’d suffered injuries during the battle with Lu Yuntian. But it was normal. After all, the gap between their cultivations was so huge. Unless he used the wooden sword, it would be utterly impossible for him to defeat Lu Yuntian.

It was suppression by realm of cultivation!

Something worth mentioning was that Lu Yuntian really did want to kill him. If he didn’t possess sufficient strength or Lu Yuntian felt that it was possible to kill him, then Lu Yuntian would have done that without the slightest hesitation. However, the facts proved that Lu Yuntian couldn’t!

If Lu Yuntian used the entire Lu Clan’s strength, then it wouldn’t be difficult to kill him. But Lu Yuntian would never do that. Because it was just as Yang Ye had expected, the Lu Clan wouldn’t pay such a huge price to kill him!

So, he’d won the battle between him and the Lu Clan!

The reason he’d won was his strength! His strength instilled fear in the Lu Clan!

Strength! Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Strength was the most important thing!

Yang Ye sat cross-legged in the Primordial Pagoda. In less than an hour, the Primordial Pagoda had fully restored him. Not only had his injuries been healed, he was even back in his peak state.

After he recovered, Yang Ye didn’t leave the Primordial Pagoda, and he continued sitting there. At this moment, he was recalling the battle with Lu Yuntian.

He’d done his best just now, but he was still unable to do anything to Lu Yuntian.

Combat instinct!

Lu Yuntian’s combat instinct far surpassed his expectations. Lu Yuntian’s sense for danger was absolutely sensitive, and his reaction was extremely quick too. Moreover, he was able to immediately launch a lethal strike upon stopping Yang Ye’s attacks!

The gap between them wasn’t just reflected in their cultivations, it was reflected in their combat instinct too!

Flaws!

Presently, he was locating his own flaws by recalling the mistakes he’d made during the battle with Lu Yuntian.

One would remain ignorant if one didn’t think about it, but it would be shocking once one did.

Yang Ye noticed that when he recalled the previous battle, he noticed numerous mistakes that he’d made. Or it should be said that he could have done better. Especially when doing just a little bit better would have allowed him to avoid suffering injuries.

Time trickled by. A day later, Yang Ye opened his eyes.

He stood up and took a deep breath.

Even though his strength hadn’t really improved in the last day, he’d gained a lot.

Accumulation!

He was gradually accumulating experience in battle, and he was confident that if he fought Lu Yuntian again, he would definitely not make similar mistakes.

Yang Ye went to the 1st level. Snowy was still playing with the wooden sword.

Or to be more precise, Snowy was training with the sword. Obviously, the wooden sword was teaching her.

Yang Ye smiled and was about to leave, but a wisp of surprise suddenly flashed through his eyes. Snowy held the wooden sword with a single claw, and the wooden sword was trembling violently. But Snowy was still ceaselessly sending profound energy into it.

The wooden sword shook more and more violently while sword howls resounded incessantly.

Suddenly, Snowy grabbed the wooden sword with her other claw, and then Yang Ye watched with astonishment as she swung it at Qiong Qi who was in deep sleep.

Om!

An ear piercing sword howl resounded. The sword howl caused the space here to tremble violently, and then almost 10,000 rays of sword energy appeared here. All of them rained down upon Qiong Qi!

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Numerous explosions resounded in succession. At the same time, a furious howl resounded, “Yang Ye! What the hell are you doing now?!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

A powerful aura shot up into the air, and the rain of sword energy was instantly dispersed before Qiong Qi appeared in front of Yang Ye and Snowy.

At this moment, Qiong Qi… was in quite a sorry state.

Marks densely covered his body. Even though they hadn’t broken through his defenses, it still wasn’t a pleasant experience. Because those marks were quite deep, and they would have drawn blood if they went just a little deeper.

Qiong Qi was glaring angrily at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye had a very innocent expression on his face.

Snowy immediately put on an innocent expression when she saw Yang Ye’s innocent expression.

Qiong Qi was no fool, so it didn’t take long for him to look at Snowy. Snowy blinked and pointed at the sword in her grasp as if she was saying like it had done it. However, it only took a moment for her to hide the sword behind herself as if she was saying that he couldn’t touch it!

Qiong Qi gazed at Snowy for a long time, and then he withdrew his gaze. He wouldn’t go so low as to get angry with Snowy. Moreover, he really liked Snowy.

Or it should be said that all demon beasts and other beings of nature were fond of Sprite Lords like Snowy.

Pure and genuine!

It was Snowy’s character. But now, another description should be added — mischievous!

After she started staying with Yang Ye, she was growing more and more mischievous.

Qiong Qi glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Kid, you’ve grown much stronger?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Brother Qiong Qi, aren’t you the same?”

Qiong Qi shook his head slightly, “I’m just recovering my strength, but you’re not doing the same. You’re growing. Your speed of growth is quite shocking. However, you work quite hard too.”

He knew how Yang Ye had been training bitterly in the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye smiled, “I have to work hard!”

Countless people throughout the medium universe wanted his head, and he had the Yang Clan to worry about as well. There had been no movement from the Yang Clan lately, but he was very well aware that it was definitely because the Yang Clan wasn’t confident in its ability to kill him yet. Once the Yang Clan made its move, it would definitely be a storm!

Qiong Qi nodded, “When will you be going to the Yang Clan?”

The Yang Clan! Yang Ye tightened his grip on his sword, fell silent for a few moments, and replied, “It won’t be long from now!”

Qiong Qi said, “Even though you’re much stronger now, it’s still insufficient to go against that Yang Clan of yours. Continue working hard on growing stronger” As soon as he finished speaking, Qiong Qi flashed off into the distance, laid flat on the ground, and fell into deep sleep again.

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he grabbed Snowy in his arms and said, “Don’t just randomly hit others from now on, alright?”

Snowy blinked, and then she started waving her claws about.

Yang Ye rubbed her head gently, “It’s best if you didn’t do it on purpose. Just be careful from now on. Understand?”

Fortunately, Qiong Qi had thick skin. If he suffered that attack and was caught off guard, then it may have crippled him even if he could avoid death.

Even though Snowy wasn’t strong, the wooden sword was!

Snowy nodded when she heard him, and then she cracked a smile. She wrapped her arms around Yang Ye’s head and rubbed her head against his head.

This move always worked!

This time was no exception!

After that, Yang Ye didn’t leave the Primordial Pagoda, and he stayed to play with Snowy. However, they didn’t get to play for long. Just around five or six hours later, he left the Primordial Pagoda.

He frowned a little once he left the Primordial Pagoda, and then the scroll Yang Lianshuang gave him appeared before him.

Ferocity filled his face when he read its contents.

“Yang Clan!” Yang Ye’s furious voice resounded.

Yang Lianshuang told him that the Yang Clan was actually spreading that if people captured his loved ones in Merak System, then he would show himself, and they could even use those loved ones to make Yang Ye do as they said.

So, countless people who wanted to take Yang Ye’s head instantly moved their attention to Merak System!

The Yang Clan wanted to make him become enemies with the entire world!

Yang Ye stood on the spot while he tightened his grip on his sword.

Return to Merak System?

I can’t!

Once I go back there, the trouble I face will never end.

Moreover, once he returned, the flames of war would burn through Merak System. Merak System was too small, and it couldn’t endure a war of such scale.

Besides that, he would fall into a passive position that never ended. Because he couldn’t leave Merak System, and it would make it much easier for the Yang Clan to deal with him.

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he smiled ferociously, “You want my head to be exchanged for treasures? Alright, then come take it!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he gazed at the scroll and said, “Help me do something. Tell your people to spread the word that I’ll be at Sword Immortal City, and I’ll be waiting for all those who want to take my head!”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

A day later, the news of Yang Ye’s presence in Sword Immortal City swept through the medium universe like a storm. It spread so swiftly that it only took a short while for countless people to receive information about his whereabouts.

So, countless experts rushed to Sword Immortal City. They were absolutely afraid that they would get there too late, and Yang Ye’s head would fall into someone else’s hands.

Kill Yang Ye and save 100 years of hard work!

It was the most popular line in the entire medium universe of Milky Way System right now!
