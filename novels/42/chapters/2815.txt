Chapter 2816 – Justice!

Snowy didn’t get flustered this time, and she just slammed the ball of fiery lightning and black lotus at the woman in a plain dress.

Two precious treasures of the Four Dimensional Universe!

The woman in a plain dress shook her head, and then two rays of sword energy slashed against the fiery lightning and black lotus.

Boom! Boom!

Both of them shattered into countless pieces that rained down from there.

Snowy was stunned by the sight of this.

But just a moment later, she recovered from her shock. She didn’t attack again and just gazed at Yang Ye who’d lost his eyes at the hands of the woman!

She started crying as she gazed at him.

The woman in a plain dress tapped a finger forward, and rays of sword energy appeared around Snowy. A moment later, she walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction. She was still as composed and calm as ever.

Yang Ye closed his eyes while the Sword Precursor trembled incessantly in his grasp!

At this moment, the sword intent and slaughter intent he emanated were practically at their respective peaks.

The Fate Sword Dao!

Yang Ye suddenly attacked.

A ray of sword energy flashed like a bolt of lightning!

The extremes of the Fate Sword Dao!

And it could be described as an attack at Yang Ye’s limit!

The woman in a plain dress stopped. Meanwhile, a ray of sword energy appeared a few inches before her forehead. It stopped there and was unable to move further!

It was because her fingers had clamped down on the end of that sword energy!

She twisted her fingers slightly. In an instant, Yang Ye’s sword energy shattered into bits!

After shattering Yang Ye’s sword energy, she surprisingly refrained from attacking again and looked down, “Witness the destruction of the world with me.”

As soon as she said that, she waved her finger, and Justice suddenly appeared above the Four Dimensional Universe instead.

At this moment, countless experts in the Four Dimensional Universe looked up, especially the experts in the floating city. All of them started fleeing the city when they saw Justice.

However, it was all in vain!

Along with Justice’s descent, the entire Four Dimensional Universe started to collapse inch by inch. Everything was being obliterated beneath Justice!

Just like that, the Four Dimensional Universe started to be obliterated while she watched, and the living beings there couldn’t fight back at all. Only death awaited them!

No one could escape!

High above in the clouds, the smile on her face had changed slightly, there was a trace of evil and excitement on it.

In just a single thought, she could change everything!

As she watched the universe and its Grand Dao collapse bit by bit, her feelings were something that most were unable to understand.

She smiled, “See? Even the Grand Dao of the universe and all Laws are still so weak. There is no end to the Dao of the world, but I am the end!”

It didn’t take long for the Four Dimensional Universe to be completely obliterated, and nothing was left behind!

It had been wiped out from existence!

The Four Dimensional Universe was gone.

The woman waved her fingers, and Justice traveled through space and arrived above the Three Dimensional Universe. As they gazed at it, practically all the experts of Eternal Kingdom and Eternal Border were filled with despair.

She looked up at Yang Ye, “Watch and see how weak your so-called Sword Dao of Order is!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she lowered her right hand.

Justice descended from above Eternal Border.

Suddenly, a ray of sword energy flashed through the sky, and it slammed against Justice.

Bang!

The sky shook violently while Justice was forced to a stop!

A woman suddenly appeared in the sky above Eternal Border.

It was a woman who looked exactly like the woman in a plain dress, and she was holding a sword in each hand!

The woman in a plain dress smiled, “You’ve merged! Interesting!”

The woman in the sky above Eternal Border was the merged form of the woman in white and woman in black, and those swords she held were the Great Unknown and Past Life!

The woman in the air suddenly pressed her swords together, and then she vanished on the spot. She was before the woman above the clouds when she appeared once more!

They looked exactly the same as if they were looking at themselves in the mirror.

The woman in a plain dress smiled, “Looks like you want to protect that universe down there.”

The woman with the merged swords didn’t waste her breath and just swung it.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy instantly arrived before the woman in a plain dress, and the latter used her hand as a sword and swung it lightly. The sword energy was instantly slashed into bits, but an afterimage suddenly appeared behind her at the same time, and then a sword stabbed at her nape!

It was Yang Ye!

The woman in a plain dress grinned and tapped her right foot down.

Bang!

The space around Yang Ye collapsed, and it was like a sledgehammer had slammed against his chest. Yang Ye was blasted over 3km away, and as soon as he stopped himself, his entire body actually started to crack rapidly!

Yang Ye hurriedly circulated the Primordial Violet Energy and Polaris Energy he had within him, and with their help, the cracking gradually started to slow down!

Yang Ye looked off into the distance. The woman had suddenly vanished on the spot, and she was before the woman with the merged swords when she appeared again, causing the latter to suddenly stab her sword forward!

Bang!DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Two types of sword intent rippled forward, but the woman in a plain dress just waved her hand, and the sword intent vanished without a trace. A moment later, an ethereal sword pierced through the woman with the merged swords’ chest!

Hiss!

The woman was blasted away.

The woman stopped herself around 300m away. There was a bloody hole in her chest, and her body actually started to turn ethereal.

The woman in a plain dress glanced at the woman who looked exactly like her and smiled, “Our origin is the same, so I don’t want to kill you. I wish to pursue my own Dao, so why do you stop me?”

“Shut up!” The woman with the merged swords suddenly howled with fury, “Do you still remember why our previous whole form cultivated in the sword?”

The woman in a plain dress’ smile gradually vanished.

The woman with the merged swords walked slowly toward the woman in a plain dress, “All those years ago, the Heaven Dao was heartless and destroyed the world with divine lightning. Our family was annihilated by the divine lightning, and our elder brother took us with him as he fled. At that time, he was eight, and we were six. Do you still remember how he died all those years ago?”

The woman in a plain dress replied indifferently, “I remember, he gave me the last half of a steamed bun he had…”

“Is that all?” The woman with the merged swords was practically howling with rage, and two streams of tears were flowing down her face.

The woman in a plain dress slowly clenched her right fist while closing her eyes.

Scenes from very, very long ago appeared in her mind.

It was the apocalypse. Countless bolts of black lightning filled the sky, and they were ceaselessly obliterating the cultivators on the ground below.

At a mountain range, a young boy around the age of 8 was running with a young girl, who had dirt covering her face, on his back. The young boy’s shoes were torn, and his feet were covered in cuts!

Lightning was flashing above them.

Just like that, he carried her all the way to a narrow crevice in a mountain. It was very small to the point it was just able to fit two children.

The young boy wiped off the sweat on his face and hugged her tight, “Qing’er… D-Don’t be afraid…”

He may have not noticed it himself, but his voice was trembling.

The young girl held his arm tightly with both hands while looking outside through the cracks of the crevice. Countless bolts of lightning were flashing through the sky outside, and all sorts of colossi were flying through the air from time to time.

The young girl spoke softly, “B-Big Brother… What is that lightning? And those flying things. W-Why are they eating people…?”

The young boy shot a glance at the sky. Lightning was descending from time to time, and every bolt was accompanied by a deafening explosion.

The young boy gulped and spoke in a slightly trembling voice, “T-That lightning… Father said it’s punishment sent by the heavens…”

“Punishment?” She gazed at the young boy, “W-Why? D-Did we do something wrong?”

The young boy hugged her tight and seemed to sob a little, “F-Father said that the gods want to kill us, so… we must die. Father and mother are dead, so we… must live well…”

The young girl looked outside from the cracks in the crevice, and she had a slightly lost gaze in her eyes.

The sky outside was covered in countless bolts of lightning and all sorts of demon beasts that were rampaging through the world.

The two children in the crevice hugged each other tightly.

One night.

“Brother, I-I’m hungry.” The young boy passed half a steamed bun to her, “Q-Qing’er, eat this…”

The young girl took a bite, but she seemed to have thought of something and passed it to the young boy, “Brother… Y-You eat too…”

The young boy shook his head, “I-I’ve had some… You eat, Qing’er.”

As he spoke, he deliberately swallowed.

The young girl believed him.

Late at night.

Thunder was still flashing outside the crevice, and the roars of demons resounded from time to time.

The young boy hugged the young girl right while speaking in quite a weak voice, “Q-Qing’er… I remember that you seemed to be fond of training with the sword!”

The young girl nodded, “I want to protect you, daddy, and mommy…”

Tears suddenly started rolling down the young boy’s face. However, the young girl couldn’t see it in the darkness of the night.

The young boy kissed her gently on the forehead, “Qing’er… I-If you become strong in the future, you must… you must protect… protect those who are weak like us… If mother… and father had someone to… protect them… they would be still alive… A-And, you must kill… kill that god out there… They… I’m so hungry… so hungry…”

Dawn arrived.

The young boy remained motionless, and his body was icy cold.

The young girl buried the young boy in the crevice and knelt before the crevice for a day and night.

On the next day, the young girl stood up and walked out of the mountain range. She saw some corpses on the way, and she walked over to one of them and took the sword in the corpse’s grasp. She held it in both hands while coldness and indifference which didn’t conform to her age appeared in her eyes, “From now on, your name is Justice, and you will uphold justice with me.”

Just like that, she left the mountain range with that sword in hand…
