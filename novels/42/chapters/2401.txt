Chapter 2402 – Bite Me!

The middle aged man froze on the spot.

A single attack!

He hadn’t even been able to stop a single attack!

Such a sword cultivator existed in this world!

The middle aged man broke out in cold sweat!

…

When Yang Ye opened his eyes, he was in a boundless mountain range, and there was a huge palace deep within it.

Imposing!

That was the impression Yang Ye had about it!

It was the first time he’d seen such an imposing palace.

At the top of the palace was two pitch black characters ‘修罗’!

Asura!

The entire palace emanated a ghastly aura!

Wu Ni glanced at the palace and gazed at Yang Ye, “You do it!”

Yang Ye glanced at him. Yang Ye didn’t mind because he’d never feared anyone!

Yang Ye’s figure appeared before the palace, and then he walked slowly in its direction.

Wu Ni suddenly asked An Nanjing, “You chose him?”

She nodded, “Yes!”

He nodded, “He acts like a man.”

An Nanjing nodded slightly. While her face remained without any expression, she was quite happy because the old man acknowledged Yang Ye!

Acknowledgment!

After she met the old man, she knew how picky the old man was, and few in the world were able to make him take a liking to them!

Meanwhile, Wu Ni continued, “While his natural talent isn’t great, his character and mentality are extremely good. Especially the ruthlessness deep down in his bones, he’d someone destined for great things. Moreover, he’s quite loyal, so you can depend on each other on your future paths.”

An Nanjing nodded slightly and remained silent.

Yang Ye was right in front of the palace now.

Yang Ye thought for a moment as he gazed at the imposing palace, and then he swung his sword.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy flashed and struck the palace. It hadn’t even gotten close to the palace when a wave of mysterious energy shattered it into bits!

Meanwhile, a middle aged man in black armor appeared in front of Yang Ye. He sized up Yang Ye and frowned slightly, “The True Dao Realm?”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “Tell your Junior Hall Master to get out here! I’m going to kill him!”

The man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Who are you?!”

This True Dao Realm cultivator actually dared to openly attack the Asura Hall, so he refused to believe the man before him was someone ordinary.

Who was he?

Yang Ye shook his head and didn’t waste his breath. He just appeared above the middle aged man, and then his sword descended.

Hiss!

Space was instantly sliced into bits!

Killing intent flashed through the man’s eyes, and then he twisted his right hand upward and clawed at Yang Ye’s sword. It was like he was clawing the entire world. However, in this instant, a pitch black seal appeared above him, and then a ray of black light enveloped him!

The man was immediately suppressed to a lower realm of cultivation!

He was astounded, and he immediately clenched his other fist and slammed it upward!

Bang! Bang!

Two explosions resounded, and he was blasted backward until he arrived before the palace’s doors. He looked down at his hands, and he noticed that they had been sliced into bits!

He'd lost both his hands!

Yang Ye ignored the middle aged man and glanced at the palace, “Is the Junior Hall Master of Asura Hall such a coward?”

“Who do you think you are?!” Suddenly, a disdainful voice resounded from nearby, and then a young man in a violet robe appeared before Yang Ye. He sized up Yang Ye, “Where did you come from, bastard? How dare you cause trouble at my Asura Hall?!”

Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot.

The young man’s expression changed because a powerful aura enveloped him, and then a ray of sword energy descended!

Three swings with the Sword Domain!

It was absolutely terrifying! Especially when the Seal of Suppression was included!

The young man was horrified. At the critical moment, a pitch black shield emerged from within him, and it enveloped the young man. When Yang Ye’s sword struck it, it shook violently, and then countless rays of black light surged from it.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted backward!

He only stopped after being pushed almost 300m back!

Yang Ye glanced at his trembling hands, and then he gazed at the black shield.

A Divine Treasure!

It was an actual Divine Treasure!

Yang Ye grinned as he thought of something. Meanwhile, the young man ridiculed, “The True Dao Realm. Your sword may be good, but what can you do to me? Come, don’t blame me for bullying you. I’ll let you attack 10 times!”

10 times!

Yang Ye glanced at the young man and patted his chest, and then a white little head emerged from there.

It was Snowy!

Snowy glanced at the surroundings, and then her gaze descended onto the shield. Her eyes immediately lit up, and then she waved at it.

However, the pitch black shield didn’t react at all.

Snowy frowned at the sight of this and glanced at Yang Ye. A moment later, she inhaled in its direction, causing the black light it emanated to dim down slightly. After that, the shield started to tremble violently.

Sprite Destruction!

Snowy was destroying its spirit!

Actually, Snowy would usually not use that, because it would erase the intelligence of a treasure. However, the situation was different now. The person who owned the shield was fighting Yang Ye, and that was something she refused to tolerate!

She didn’t care if it was a Divine Treasure! If it dared to go against Yang Ye, she would destroy them all!

At this moment, the shield was quite afraid!

Yang Ye’s sword was very powerful, but it could stop Yang Ye’s attacks. However, it couldn’t endure Snowy! Because Snowy could destroy its intelligence!

Suddenly, Snowy waved at it again. Obviously, she was asking if it was coming to her. Otherwise, she was going to inhale again!

The shield hesitated for quite some time, and then it suddenly struggled free of the young man, destroyed the link between them, and shot over to Snowy.

Snowy grinned, and then she grabbed it and went into the Primordial Pagoda!

The young man was stunned!

Utterly stunned!

He couldn’t sense the Divine Treasure anymore! He couldn’t sense it at all!

A short while later, the young man recovered from his shock and gazed at Yang Ye before howling with rage, “Little Bastard! Hand it over now! Otherwise, I’ll…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared before him, and then a sword slammed down.

The young man was horrified. He quickly formed a strange seal with both hands and slammed them upward.

A wave of powerful energy rippled out of the seal, but it was obliterated as soon as it came into contact with Yang Ye’s sword!

The sword descended!

Bang!

The young man was blasted away, but at the instant his figure was blasted away, a hand clamped down on his throat.

Yang Ye held the young man by the throat and slammed him into the ground.

Boom!

The ground exploded apart!

But Yang Ye wasn’t satisfied!

He kicked the young man’s nether regions without holding back at all.

Crack!

It was the sound of his balls shattering!

A shrill cry resounded, and then the young man’s eyes opened wide as he curled up on the ground!

Yang Ye raised the young man up and said, “How dare you tease my wife and send people to kill her? How many lives do you think you have?”

Yang Ye slammed his fist against the young man’s stomach.

Bang!Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The young man was slammed to the ground and blasted open a huge hole there!

But that wasn’t the end of it. Yang Ye raised him up again, and then went over to Wu Ni and An Nanjing. But Yang Ye was stunned when he arrived there. The corpses of three old men were in front of them!

The young man in Yang Ye’s grasp turned pale from fright when he saw the corpses.

An Nanjing glanced at Yang Ye and said, “They wanted to attack you, so Master killed them!”

Yang Ye was quite embarrassed at this point. He’d been wondering why Asura Hall hadn’t sent anyone at him when he’d beaten up the young man like that. Now, he understood why. It wasn’t that they hadn’t, the problem was that those people were dead!

Yang Ye shook his head, smiled, and tossed the young man over to An Nanjing, “Kill him yourself!”

She glanced at Yang Ye, “You do it!”

Yang Ye smiled and was about to kill him when a wave of powerful pressure seeped out from Asura Hall, and it pressed down upon Yang Ye. It seemed capable of obliterating the world!

A supreme expert!

A voice came from within the Asura Hall, “Why don’t you try killing him!”

Wu Ni didn’t help suppress the pressure. He just glanced at Yang Ye, and no one knew what he was thinking.

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s sword descended.

Hiss!

The young man’s head flew up into the air, and then Yang Ye tapped with his finger and made it descend before the entrance to Asura Hall.

Yang Ye gazed at the palace and said, “I killed him! Bite me!”

As he spoke, he moved closer to Wu Ni!
