Chapter 2590

It was just Zuo Qing who was shocked, the Ascetic and Elder Zhu were shocked too.

Someone capable of ascending to the third floor of the Divine Abode.

It could be said that Zuo Qing hadn’t met many capable of ascending to the third floor in her entire lifetime. Or it should be said that it had been a very, very long time since someone had gone up there.

But today, she’d been ordered to lead someone to the third floor.

That person was the man by her side.

Yet now, this great figure by her side was actually inviting someone who was merely at the Lord Realm to go up to the third floor with him!

Actually, Yang Ye was quite surprised too because he knew the man before him.

It was the desolate race’s patriarch, the Desolate Emperor!

He hadn’t expected the Desolate Emperor to be here!

The Desolate Emperor!

The Desolate Emperor smiled, “You’re not coming?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Then I shall! But I almost didn’t have the right to stay on the second floor, so the third floor…”

He gazed at Zuo Qing.

The Desolate Emperor smiled, “It’s just a single floor. Come on!”

He turned around and walked up to the third floor.

Yang Ye cupped his fist to the Ascetic and Elder Zhu, “I’ll have to excuse myself for a moment.”

He followed the Desolate Emperor once he finished speaking.

Zuo Qing seemed hesitant to speak when Yang Ye was ascending the third floor, but she seemed to have received some kind of order. So, she didn’t hesitate to follow respectfully behind Yang Ye.

The third floor was very spacious and only had two tables.

There was a jug of wine waiting on the table, and there were some fruits there too.

All of them were precious fruits. Of course, they were inferior when compared to a Worldborn Fruit.

The Divine Abode wasn’t rich enough to entertain guests with that!

Only one existence in this world was wealthy enough for that, and it was Snowy!

Yang Ye and the Desolate Emperor sat facing each other while Zuo Qing stood respectfully by the side.

The Desolate Emperor didn’t ask her to leave.

He grinned and said, “I didn’t expect to see you here. I’m quite surprised.”

Yang Ye replied, “I didn’t expect to see you here either.”

The Desolate Emperor took a sip of wine and said, “It’s normal for me to be here, but it’s not very normal for you to be here. So, was it the patriarch of the void spirit race?”

He glanced at the surroundings while he spoke, “I don’t sense her presence, and you’re enveloped by a mysterious energy.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m all alone here.”

The Desolate Emperor glanced at Yang Ye and smiled, “That’s good. You can gain some experience and temper yourself. Anyway, you’re much stronger than before now. Huang Ying may not be a match for you anymore!”

Yang Ye took a sip of wine and said, “I’m sure you didn’t bring me up to the third floor just to say that, right?”

The Desolate Emperor said, “I’m afraid the matter between my desolate race and the Eternal Kingdom is about to be done once and for all.”

Yang Ye remained silent.

The Desolate Emperor gazed at him and smiled, “Alright, let’s not talk about those things. I brought you here mainly to ask you about something. How is that pool of lightning that you took from the Desolate World?”

The pool of lightning!

Yang Ye was quite embarrassed. The Desolate Emperor had brought him there to temper his body, but he let Snowy take the entire pool of lightning. That wasn’t a very nice thing to do!

The Desolate Emperor smiled, “You have that little fellow with you, so they are lucky to be with you. Thus, I didn’t interfere that day.”

Yang Ye chuckled embarrassedly, “They are doing very, very well.”

The Desolate Emperor nodded slightly, “That’s good!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “Senior, this place seems very special!”

The Desolate Emperor grinned, “What do you want to know?”

Yang Ye said, “Please enlighten me.”

The Desolate Emperor pondered deeply for a moment and said, “Alright, you can be considered to have the right to know about this place. This is the Origin of Eternal Kingdom, and it’s the last Origin of a superior universe.”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “The last?”

The Desolate Emperor smiled, “The last. In the past, like during the Primordial Times, there were many other universes on par with Eternal Kingdom, but they are gone now. This place is relatively special because it possesses things that many other places do not. For example, the Boundless Water. It doesn’t exist in the outside world. Besides that, there are other mysterious existences, and people or treasures that have existed since the Primordial Times or even before that.”

He tapped the table lightly and continued, “It can be said that this place is the essence of the universe. All clans, people, and organizations with sufficient strength would come here. The people you can see here are very rarely seen in the outside world, and it’s even to the extent that existences like them may not even exist in an entire world. Every single person here is rarely seen in the outside world.”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m not rare!”

The Desolate Emperor shook his head slightly, “Your current strength cannot be underestimated. Of course, you’re still young, and you still have a ways to go.”

Yang Ye was about to say something when footsteps came from down below, and it didn’t take long for a middle aged man in a violet robe to walk up here. Zuo Qing gazed at him, hurriedly bowed, and then respectfully moved aside.

The middle aged man glanced at the Desolate Emperor and Yang Ye, and then he walked over to the window. Zuo Qing hurriedly served him a jug of thousand-year-old brew.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man suddenly asked, “You’re the Desolate Emperor?”

The Desolate Emperor smiled, “Why?”

The middle aged man gazed at him, “I’m just a little curious. I’ve always heard legends about you, but I’ve never met you for myself.”

The Desolate Emperor smiled, “You’re the Yin Lord of the Yin World, right?”

The middle aged man nodded slightly, “My wife, Madam Yin, was killed on the bridge. The bridge’s guardian did not say who did it, but I think that even if it’s in a place like this, very few are able to kill my wife with ease. Of course, you are definitely one of them!”

Madam Yin!

Yang Ye frowned slightly. He wondered if the woman the man was speaking about was the same woman on the bridge who used cold winds! And Yang Ye was shocked to learn that she was dead!

The Desolate Emperor shook his head.

The Yin Lord nodded slightly, “I apologize for disturbing you!”

He naturally chose to believe the Desolate Emperor because such experts disdained to lie. If they killed someone, they would admit it!

They had their own pride.

Meanwhile, the Yin Lord suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, “My wife came into contact with you before she died, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “She almost killed me!”

The Yin Lord said, “But she is dead, and you’re alive.”

Yang Ye shrugged, “Do you think I can kill her?”

The Yin Lord gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, “What about your elders? I’ve been following you for a long time, and I didn’t notice anyone protecting you.”

Yang Ye replied, “I came here on my own!”

The Yin Lord grinned, “You don’t have the ability to do so.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “A person called the Unfettered One sent me here. He’s a sword cultivator too, and he should be in Eternal Kingdom right now. You can go look for him if necessary.”

The Yin Lord took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, and then he walked toward the stairs. But he stopped right before the stairs and said, “I hope you aren’t lying to me. Otherwise, I’ll kill you no matter where you go!”

He walked down the stairs.

Once he left, the Desolate Emperor smiled, “You lied!”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “He would kill me if I didn’t!”

The Desolate Emperor smiled and gazed at Zuo Qing, “How long before it begins?”

She replied softly, “One day!”

The Desolate Emperor nodded slightly, “Then I’ll wait!”

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

The Desolate Emperor smiled, “The Divine Abode obtained a precious treasure, but they cannot uncover its secrets. So, they’ve invited people from all over the universe to try helping them.”

Yang Ye asked, “Aren’t they afraid of being robbed?”

Zuo Qing glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent.

“Haha!” The Desolate Emperor shook his head and smiled, “It wouldn’t be the Divine Abode if it could be robbed. Kid, you are still too young. Let me explain it like this. Perhaps the joint forces of two experts like me might have a chance at robbing them.”

Zuo Qing glanced at him and then remained silent with her head lowered.

Meanwhile, the Desolate Emperor glanced at Yang Ye, “You should stay too.”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m afraid I wouldn’t be qualified!”

The Desolate Emperor smiled, “You’re the person with the most secrets I’ve ever met. Perhaps you may be able to uncover its secrets. It’s a feeling of mine!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “Senior, is the Yin World beyond the Eternal Kingdom?”

The Desolate Emperor nodded, “There are a myriad of worlds outside Eternal Kingdom. Actually, Eternal Kingdom is part of those worlds. However, they isolated themselves. Of course, I know what you wish to know. Some of these worlds remain out in the open, but some are hidden. Even my Desolate World used to be hidden in the past.”

He gazed at Yang Ye at this point, “Do you know why my desolate race and Eternal Kingdom are not at war yet?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

The Desolate Emperor smiled, “Because we must deal with the other worlds. Otherwise, it would be bad if they try to reap the rewards after we start fighting. Besides that, the reason my desolate race chose to retreat all those years ago was mostly because the Sprite Progenitor of that time chose to take their side in the end. Moreover, she made some promises to the powerful organizations of all the other worlds. My desolate race was forced to retreat because all of these organizations and powers suddenly stepped forward against us.”

Yang Ye glanced at the Desolate Emperor. While the latter was speaking very calmly as if it was a very normal thing, Yang Ye could sense that he wasn’t calm at all. The Desolate Emperor felt very, very dangerous to him at this moment!

The Desolate Emperor grinned and took a sip of wine, “If they dare to interfere again, I will abandon the desolate race and bury all the worlds with us.”

The world feared the Desolate Emperor in the past, and if it wasn’t for the sake of keeping the desolate race safe, everyone who interfered in that battle would have died.

For the sake of protecting the desolate race, the Desolate Emperor had stopped. Because if he fought, he could kill them all, but he would be the only survivor from the desolate race!

…

Eternal Kingdom.

Once the Yin Lord stepped foot into Eternal Kingdom, some of the hidden powers here started searching for a sword cultivator known as the Unfettered One. In the end, the entire Eternal Kingdom started searching for him.

Because the Yin Lord sought help from the Eternal Lord!

The Eternal Lord had to give the Yin Lord some face.

Before a mountain wall of unknown name, a sword cultivator seemed to be slightly absent-minded as he stared at it.

There was a line of words on the mountain wall.

A long time passed before the sword cultivator suddenly drew his sword, and then another line of words appeared on the mountain wall, “My thousand-year journey of the sword is at its end, but who can be my match? Sigh!”𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
