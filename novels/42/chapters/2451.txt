Chapter 2452 – Kill!

Just like that, Erya’s days of pain began.

She who was once free had to spend some of her time learning combat techniques from An Nanjing every day. In the beginning, she was very unwilling, but after learning for some time, she suddenly became quite happy.

Because she noticed that some human thoughts and techniques were very interesting!

As for Yang Ye, he was training like a madman too.

Dual Swords!

At his level, pure strength and speed were the most terrifying. Of course, sword and martial techniques were extremely important as well. They were an extension of strength and speed!

Besides the Divine Treasures he possessed, Yang Ye’s current trump card was his Sword Domain and flying swords!

The Sword Domain was a form of enhancement, and the flying swords were a sword technique!

His Sword Domain could improve the strength of his attacks by countless times, and if he used Executor, it would grow even more terrifying!

It could be said that Yang Ye’s true strength was using the Sword Domain, Madness Sword Technique, and flying swords while he went mad with the madness intent!

He was the most terrifying in that state!

Of course, his greatest trump card was his own cultivation!

He was still suppressing it. If he stopped, how much would it rise?

He didn’t know!

However, so long as he could continue suppressing it, he planned to continue! All the way until he couldn’t anymore!

In the Martial Pavilion, Yang Ye read through all the sword techniques there, but he didn’t cultivate them! At his level, both his Sword Dao and sword techniques carried his own unique style. What he needed wasn’t to thread on another’s path, it was to learn, refer, and perfect. The use of those techniques to him was to help him perfect his own Sword Dao and sword techniques. Even the Dual Sword Technique was something he only learned the advantages of so that he could perfect his own sword technique! He wasn’t learning it as it was!

He wasn’t the only one doing that, An Nanjing was doing the same.

Day after day passed. It wasn’t long before Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda! Because it was the last day he could stay in the Martial Pavilion!

Once he left the pagoda, Yang Ye noticed that A’Leng was gone.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and left the Martial Pavilion.

Huang Ying was waiting at the entrance.

Huang Ying smiled, “How was it?”

Yang Ye replied, “I gained a lot!”

“Great!” Huang Ying smiled, “Go have a look at the Dao Pavilion now. There are many, many divine techniques, secret techniques, and the comprehensions of countless ancestors from my desolate race within there.”

Yang Ye nodded and asked, “Where’s Miss A’Leng?”

Huang Ying spoke solemnly, “Her clan sent her a letter to return immediately. It seems there’s something important.”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “Eternal Kingdom?”

Huang Ying nodded, “It should be something urgent or she wouldn’t have rushed back like that. Don’t worry, she’d friends with us now, thus so long as her clan isn’t too foolish, it wouldn’t force her to do anything stupid.”FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye nodded, “How long can I stay in the Dao Pavilion?”

Huang Ying laughed bitterly, “One day! Sorry, I really don’t have more contribution points.”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s enough!”

Huang Ying smiled, “I hope you gain a lot!”

He turned around and walked away.

Yang Ye followed him to the Dao Pavilion.

Yang Ye saw a familiar face in the pavilion, Huang Tianxing. Huang Tianxing nodded slightly when he saw Yang Ye walk in, and Yang Ye nodded in response.

They didn’t speak!

Yang Ye walked to the side, glanced at the surroundings, and noticed only five bookshelves in here. There were very few scrolls on the shelves too, just around 20 of them! However, they were divided into clear categories. The Martial Dao, divine techniques, secret techniques… Everything was labeled clearly.

An Nanjing appeared here too. She read every one of them because she could absorb their contents, but Yang Ye couldn’t. He was truly inferior to An Nanjing when it came to talent, so he only looked at what was suitable to him!

Yang Ye arrived before one of the bookshelves and picked up a scroll. There were two large words on it ‘剑道’!

Yang Ye had searched the surroundings, and he’d only noticed this single scroll that was on the Sword Dao!

Meanwhile, a voice came from the side, “Throughout the history of my desolate race, there have been many sword cultivators, but only one of them was truly accomplished. Only his comprehensions in the Sword Dao has the right to be kept here.”

Yang Ye looked over and saw that it was Huang Tianxing.

Huang Tianxing continued, “However, I think his comprehensions aren’t suitable for you!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Huang Tianxing explained, “Because his Sword Dao and yours are completely different. He took the path of kings, a righteous path! As for you… If I’m to be honest, your Sword Dao focuses on slaughter, so both your Sword Daos are completely different. Thus, his comprehensions aren’t very useful to you!”

Yang Ye unfurled the scroll and took a glance. The first line in it was—“The sword, a gentleman’s weapon. One who wields the sword must have a righteous heart, character that’s…”

Yang Ye shook his head and put it away.

Just as Huang Tianxing had said, these comprehensions in the Sword Dao were completely different from his Sword Dao!

The Sword Dao!

What was his Sword Dao?

It was one where he would rather die than yield, it was an unyielding Sword Dao… But was it really that?

Yang Ye shook his head. Actually, all of that was meaningless.

The Sword Dao!

In actuality, he felt that the sword was used to kill people. Instead of calling it the Sword Dao, it should be called the Slaughter Dao. There was no difference between them. No matter what he said about it, it was impossible to conceal the fact that his sword was used to kill!

The sword was used to kill! But the world gave the sword many layers of gorgeous clothing, yet even then, it was impossible to conceal that the sword was a tool, a tool to kill.

Of course, this tool had different meanings when held in the hands of different people.

However, in essence, it was created to kill!

Yang Ye smiled when he thought up to this point.

His objective wasn’t to pursue the Sword Dao, it was to pursue how to kill!

Not to kill for the sake of killing, but for the sake of protecting!

The world was vast, but loved ones were the best. If anyone dared to attack his loved ones, only death awaited!

As soon as he thought up to this point, the slight bewilderment Yang Ye felt vanished completely.

His mind and heart were clear, and the benefits of this toward his Sword Dao was naturally huge.

Huang Tianxing glanced at Yang Ye and didn’t say anything. Huang Ying was the Crown Prince now, and Huang Ying was friends with Yang Ye, so it could be said that the desolate race had acknowledged Yang Ye. Besides that, the desolate race respected the strong, so he would naturally not do something stupid like continue looking for trouble with Yang Ye! After all, he was a young master of the desolate race, not a brainless son of someone rich and powerful.

The path of the Martial Dao or Sword Dao was a long one, and they had to stay true to their heart at all times, they had to stay true to their own path. Because too, too many people got lost on the way or abandoned their original path.

Yang Ye understood this principle very well, so he had to understand his heart and path well at all times.

Only those with great willpower were able to reach the peak of the world!

After that, Yang Ye found a secret technique instead!

The Divine Avatar Technique!

The Divine Avatar Technique was actually just a clone technique. These clones were very special because they possessed 95% of the main body’s combat strength! Of course, there was a time limit. It could only exist for ten breaths of time and up to 100 breaths of time at most! It depended on the user’s strength!

What did 95% of the user’s combat strength represent?

It meant that he could instantly turn a fight into a two on one battle!

Just think about it, if two Yang Ye’s activated the Madness Sword Technique or swung five times with the Sword Domain at the same time, how terrifying would that be?

However, Huang Tianxing poured a bucket of cold water on Yang Ye, “The Divine Avatar Technique is one of the best among all the secret techniques here, but very few people in my desolate race have cultivated it. Do you know why?”

Yang Ye gazed at Huang Tianxing and asked, “Why?”

Huang Tianxing explained, “It doesn’t just require splitting the body, it requires splitting the soul. Splitting the body is easy, but not the soul. It wouldn’t be a big problem if anything happens while splitting the body. At the very worst, it would just cause some pain. However, if something goes wrong while splitting the soul, it would be a huge problem. Just the slightest mistake may lead to death! So, countless in my desolate race dare not learn it!”

Splitting the soul!

Yang Ye frowned, “Has no one ever succeeded?”

Huang Tianxing replied, “Yes, two people. One of them is the ancestor who created this technique, and the other is another ancestor of my desolate race. He was able to succeed because he had a divine treasure that could guard the soul and protect it. He was only able to learn it successfully under such circumstances. As for everyone else, there are two other people in the records of my desolate race. One of them died, the other suffered a severe injury to the soul that made him lose his mind.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “If you plan on cultivating it, it’s best if you don’t try unless you have a precious treasure that can protect your soul! You can’t afford to suffer the consequences of failure!”

Protect the soul!

Yang Ye was stunned, and it didn’t take long for him to think of something.

The Primordial Pagoda!

Wasn’t the Primordial Pagoda capable of protecting the soul?

Yang Ye grinned when he thought up to this point. He knew he was truly blessed by the heavens!

Huang Tianxing glanced at Yang Ye, “Congratulations!” He knew that Yang Ye definitely had a precious treasure that could protect the soul.

However, it made sense to him. Yang Ye had a Sprite Progenitor with him, so would Yang Ye ever lack any treasures? Even if he didn’t have a specific treasure, the Sprite Progenitor could definitely find him one!

Yang Ye was truly blessed by the heavens!

Huang Tianxing shook his head and walked away.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s voice came from behind him, “Thanks!”

Huang Tianxing’s footsteps stopped. He nodded and continued walking.

Outside the pavilion, Huang Tianxing looked up at the sky. He suddenly felt that Yang Ye wasn’t as proud as the rumors said, and Yang Ye was easy to get along with if he didn’t make an enemy out of Yang Ye!

In the pavilion.

Yang Ye entered the Primordial Pagoda. In the cultivation room, Yang Ye sat cross-legged, and a small golden pagoda floated above his head!

It was the Primordial Pagoda!

Cultivating like a madman!

He didn’t want to be hunted anymore once he left the Desolate World!

He’d been hunted for too long, and it had been too aggrieving. It was time for him to raise his sword and hunt others instead!
