Chapter 1332 – It’s Not Too Late To Fuck Off!

How terrifying was Nether Maiden’s strength?

However, she said that there was something dangerous in the ocean. In other words, it was dangerous even for her.

What exactly was it?

Yang Ye didn’t get an answer because she didn’t speak another word.

Yang Ye remained silent before the wooden house for quite some time, and then he took Snowy in his arms and left.

Zi’er appeared by Yang Ye’s side while he traveled back to the Sword Alliance, and she spoke softly, “She’s very strong.”

Yang Ye nodded. The strength Blind Maiden revealed earlier might just be the tip of the iceberg. He was growing even more curious about the Nether Pavilion.

What sort of organization is it? Every single one of them is so strong, and they are such monstrous geniuses. How terrifying would their 2nd sister and big sister be?

The Nether Pavilion!

Yang Ye took a deep breath, as time went by, he came into contact with more and more people, and only then did he notice how huge the world was. When you feel you’re very strong, there’s actually someone even stronger.

The path of cultivation had no end!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and brought both Zi’er and Snowy along with him as he sped up. He didn’t have the time to think about all of that. He had to make good use of every single second because it was very likely for the demon race’s army to leave the Veiled Region and attack the Sword Alliance. He had Blind Maiden’s help this time, but what about next time? He couldn’t keep looking for her when something occurred, right?

Even if he decided to act completely shamelessly and look for Blind Maiden, but what about the Sword Alliance?

Besides the demon race, the Nie Clan’s Nie Wuming was a huge threat as well. If that old geezer broke through again, he would definitely come looking for Yang Ye. After all, Yang Ye had killed so many members of the Nie Clan and practically annihilated the Nie Clan, so Nie Wuming would absolutely not let him go.

It could be said that both he and the Sword Alliance were in an extremely bad situation.

An hour later, Yang Ye arrived at Doomsday City with Zi’er and Snowy. He was just about to fly in when he was stunned on the spot. Because numerous swords were actually flying through the sky above Doomsday City. There were many of them, and there were just around 2 or 3 thousand there. Their quality wasn’t good at all, and they were just high-grade Divine Rank swords.

When he got close to the city, the sword instantly shook violently before locking onto him. Yang Ye knew that they would definitely shoot at him if he took another step closer.

Yang Ye glanced at the swords and a smile curled up on the corners of his mouth, Interesting. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

While the quality of the swords was inferior, the sword formation that covered the city wasn’t bad. Even though it couldn’t stop Voiders, it could kill Emperors with absolute ease.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and then he descended to the ground.

Even though those swords were no threat to him at all, he would definitely alarm the residents of the city by flying through by force. It was truly unnecessary to cause such a commotion when heading home!

Yang Ye held Zi’er’s hand as he walked towards Doomsday City. Snowy was on his shoulder. Yang Ye paid 200 energy stones when he entered the city.

It was an entrance fee!

Yang Ye had been against it, but Ye Liuyun had insisted. Because it was a rule, and if they didn’t do that, then everyone could enter Doomsday City. So, it wouldn’t take long for Doomsday City to be too full. Besides that, the entrance fee was a source of income for the Sword Alliance.

The Sword Alliance needed a huge amount of funds to develop. According to Ye Liuyun, Yang Ye couldn’t be giving the Sword Alliance violet crystals forever! The Sword Alliance had to be able to provide for itself, and only then could it sustain itself permanently.

As for why the fee was so high, it was naturally because Doomsday City had 2 Divine Grade spirit veins. After all, since the Sword Alliance had 2 Divine Grade spirit veins, Doomsday City was like a paradise of cultivation for the profounders of Dark Hell Continent. It really was a paradise. As soon as he entered the city, Yang Ye felt spirit energy assault his face. It was extremely abundant and many times more abundant than it was outside the city.

Something worth mentioning was that paying the fee of 200 energy stones didn’t represent that one could stay forever. 200 energy stones only allowed one to remain in the city for 10 days. If one wanted to stay longer, then there were only 2 ways to accomplish that. Either continue paying energy stones or join the Sword Alliance.

But the Sword Alliance didn’t just accept anyone. Strength was required to join the Sword Alliance!

In short, the people of Dark Hell Continent were proud to join the Sword Alliance. If the Veiled Region was excluded, then the Sword Alliance was definitely the strongest power on the continent.

The city was quite bustling and filled with streams of people. There were some stalls on the sides of the street, and they were naturally selling things like treasures, techniques, and other small things.

Yang Ye was naturally not interested in them, but Snowy seemed to be very interested. Her eyes were spinning about on his shoulder, and she was looking here and there.

Yang Ye and Zi’er exchanged glances and smiled when they saw Snowy react like that, and then they slowed down. Since Snowy liked it, then they naturally didn’t mind indulging here.

Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “Why don’t they recognize me?” Since he entered the city, he noticed that they clearly didn’t recognize him. He wasn’t being vain, but he’d shown himself in the sky above the city. So, logically speaking, they should have an impression of him.

Zi’er rolled her eyes at him and said, “Just think about it. Would anyone think that the master of the Sword Alliance would stroll through the streets like this? Moreover, you’ve always been elusive and rarely show yourself. So, even if they’ve seen you in the past, they might have completely forgotten you.”

Yang Ye smiled, “That is true!”

Zi’er puckered her lips and smiled, “If you really want to show off, you can just shout that you’re the master of the Sword Alliance. In that way, many would definitely run over here to pay respects to you.”

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “I’m not that free.”

She covered her mouth and chuckled, “Recently, you’ve been either killing or being chased after. It’s really quite tiring. So, let’s use this opportunity that Snowy created to look around and relax.”

The smile on Yang Ye’s face gradually vanished when he heard this. Zi’er immediately asked softly when she noticed his smile vanish, “What’s wrong?”

Yang Ye held tightly to her hand and said, “You’ve suffered because of me.”

He felt rather guilty towards Zi’er, An Nanjing, and the others. Because they’d practically never known peace after they stayed by his side. Especially Zi’er. Since she’d been with him until now, she’d encountered countless dangers and even almost lost her life on a few occasions.

Even though Zi’er and the others had never complained, how could he not feel guilty?

Zi’er glanced at Yang Ye and spoke softly, “I like being tired with you!”

Snowy flew from his shoulder and arrived in front of Yang Ye. She pointed at Zi’er before pointing at herself, and then she started waving her claws about. After that, she wrapped her claws around Yang Ye’s face and rubbed her head lightly against Yang Ye’s forehead.

Yang Ye understood what she was trying to say. Snowy was saying that it was the same for her, and that she liked staying with him!

Yang Ye took Snowy in his arms, exchanged glances with Zi’er, smiled, and then continued forward.

Doomsday City was much more prosperous than Yang Ye had ever imagined. Not only was it full of people, there were numerous stores as well. These stores sold techniques, treasures, herbs, and various other things. Moreover, some were even selling quite good treasure.

Even though Doomsday City was mostly filled with mercenaries that strived for success and superiority, Doomsday City was very peaceful. No one caused trouble. Of course, it was mainly because of the Sword Alliance. After all, the enforcement teams of the Sword Alliance patrolled the streets every now and then.

The enforcement teams were formed from the members of the Sword Alliance. They were forced to do so, and they did so willingly. Because patrolling the streets allowed them to earn points. As far as the members of the Sword Alliance were concerned, violet crystals weren’t the most attractive thing in the Sword Alliance, and it was the points that the Sword Alliance gave out. Because they could get any techniques they wanted with sufficient points.

Zi’er spoke softly, “Liuyun is really quite skilled!”

Yang Ye nodded. Needless to say, Ye Liuyun’s ability in management was very good indeed. If he were the one that managed the city, then Doomsday City would definitely be a mess.

Suddenly, Snowy pointed at a store on the right. After that, she didn’t even wait for Yang Ye to say anything and just flew over to it.

Yang Ye and Zi’er were slightly stunned, and then they hurriedly followed after Snowy.

The store was one that specialized in treasures like spirit herbs and spirit fruits. After Yang Ye and Zi’er entered, they saw Snowy holding a pure white fruit and eating it. There was a young woman around the age of 17 or 18 standing in front of Snowy. At this moment, her eyes were opened wide as she gazed at Snowy. Where did this little fellow fly in front?

After she saw Yang Ye and Zi’er walk in, the young woman hurriedly said, “That fruit is very expensive.... It costs 10 violet crystals....”

Yang Ye flicked 10 violet crystals over to her. The young woman was stunned, and then she quickly put the violet crystals away before glancing at Yang Ye and Zi’er. Obviously, they weren’t ordinary people.

Yang Ye was quite curious and asked, “What fruit is that?”

After all, Snowy was very picky, and she would absolutely not take a liking to just any fruit.

The young woman spoke softly, “A Honey Orange. It’s extremely sweet and nurtures the meridians.”

It’s extremely sweet! Yang Ye understood now. The fruit wasn’t a high quality fruit, but it was extremely sweet. It was the type that Snowy liked.

Suddenly, a young man in luxurious robes and 3 old men walked into the store. The young woman’s expression changed slightly when she saw the young man, and then she hurriedly withdrew a spatial ring and passed it to the young man, “Young Master Xu, this is for this month. All 30 violet crystals are in that spatial ring.”

The young man took the spatial ring and shook his head, “Xiao Lan, why do this? You just have to agree to spending a night with me, and you won’t have to pay this security charge forever. It’s just a night and not your entire life. Why not?”

The young woman called Xiao Lan shook her head slightly and moved aside.

The young man shrugged and was about to leave when he suddenly noticed Snowy who was eating at the side. His eyes immediately lit up when he saw Snowy, and he said, “What a cute little fellow. Gu Lan would love it.”

As he spoke, he was about to grab Snowy, but Snowy was very alert. As soon as she noticed someone trying to grab her, she immediately took the fruit in her claws and flew over to Yang Ye’s shoulder.

The young man gazed at Yang Ye and Zi’er, and his eyes lit up again when he saw Zi’er, “What a gorgeous young beauty. Tsk tsk, truly gorgeous.”

As he spoke, he gazed at Yang Ye and said, “I want both that little fellow and this young beauty.”

Yang Ye glanced at the young man and said, “It’s not too late to fuck off.”

The young man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “No one in Doomsday City dares to not give me, Xu Yuntian, face! Anyone who did is dead.”
