Chapter 2754 – Get Help!

Restrict Eternal Kingdom!

They gazed at Yang Ye with bewilderment.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Since the divine vein is here, this place is bound to be different from any other place, and it’s bound to be a place that countless cultivators yearn for. However, just as you’ve said, if it’s not restricted, this place won’t be able to endure the burden brought about by the increasing population from the outside. But if we restrict them from entering, they will definitely be resentful, and it may come to the point that countless join forces to attack Eternal Kingdom.”

He paused for a moment at this point and continued, “So, this restriction is necessary. However, we cannot just restrict the people outside and must do the same for the people here.”

Ding Shaoyao asked, “How?”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment and replied, “We can do this. If anyone commits a crime in Eternal Kingdom, we will expel them. Of course, there should be a certain severity to it, and that’s something we must discuss and decide on later. As for the people outside, if they want to enter Eternal Kingdom, the first criteria is to have a clean record. For example, they must not have carried out slaughters in the past. Simply speaking, the evil aren’t allowed entrance into her. Of course, in order to avoid killing the innocent or misjudging someone, we must establish an organization. That organization will be in charge of investigating things like this.”

Everyone fell silent upon hearing this.

Yang Ye smiled, “Is that too much?”

Ding Shaoyao shook her head, “No, but doing that will make everything quite troublesome, and we may need more personnel.”

Yang Ye grinned, “The world has been in chaos for far too long. I want to build a new order, and so it will take a lot of effort. Besides that, let’s take the guardians of this universe that I will select. If they arrive at a certain level and need to improve their strength further, they can come seek my help. I will ask the Sprite Progenitor to give them a hand.”

The Destiny Realm experts here were visibly happy to hear this.

The Sprite Progenitor!

Yang Ye’s swift advancements in strength were closely linked to the Sprite Progenitor. If they had the Sprite Progenitor’s help, it would be absolutely beneficial to them.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Yang Ye added, “Your efforts will not be for nothing. We’ll be managing the Three Dimensional Universe together, and if anyone needs my help, especially those of us here right now, I will help within the scope of my ability. Of course, if anyone has their own selfish motives and tries to spoil everything, then let me be honest, I won’t hold back at all when I kill them!”

Huang Ying chuckled, “Don’t worry, Brother Yang. You aren’t the only one, none of us will allow anyone to act rashly!”

In the current state of the world, the powers here right now would get relatively better resources. So, under such circumstances, they wouldn’t allow others to spoil all of this.

Even though Yang Ye knew that it wasn’t quite fair to the relatively weak powers and cultivators of the universe, he was very well aware that absolute fairness didn’t exist in this world. These powers and experts were strong, and they would be putting in the work, so they naturally deserved more.

Those who put in effort deserved to get a little more.

Yang Ye added, “Besides that, while Eternal Kingdom may be superior to the rest of the universe, I hope all of you don’t have a sense of superiority like you stand above the rest. Times change, and if we get overconfident one day, lose ourselves to the power we hold, and forget our original intentions, I believe that we will be overthrown one day.”

They nodded to display their agreement.

After all, hadn’t the past Eternal Kingdom been overthrown by the desolate race and the other powers of the universe?

Who dared to guarantee that someone monstrous like Yang Ye wouldn’t be born in the outside world?

Yang Ye continued, “Besides that, you must restrain your own forces throughout the universe and stop them from acting as they please.”

He gazed at Huang Ying and the others.

Huang Ying spoke softly, “Don’t worry, I’ll take care of my desolate race and our subordinate powers.”

The others nodded as well.

Yang Ye nodded, “Do all of you need anything else?”

“There’s one more thing.” Huang Ying said, “Even if we send Destiny Realm experts to patrol the universe, the universe itself is too huge. So, how about we select some local cultivators from every world and make them manage their own worlds? Of course, Eternal Kingdom will manage them all.”

Yang Ye thought for a while and nodded, “It’s a good idea. However, you must select them carefully and avoid selecting people who will try to misuse their power. While it’s impossible to do everything perfectly, I hope that we can do our best. Besides that, select some experts to stay in the shadows. Their job will be to monitor the guardians of the universe. What do you think?”

They exchanged glances and nodded. They knew Yang Ye was afraid that those guardians would do as they pleased, and having these experts to monitor them would definitely stop the guardians from acting rashly!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and added, “Besides that, I want to establish a Council of Elders. We can’t have many of those, so just 11 will be sufficient. The minimum requirement is the Destiny Realm. The Council of Elders will be the final decision makers. If the others below them are unable to come to a decision or have a difference of opinion, the Council of Elders will decide. Besides that, a spot in the Council of Elders isn’t a permanent position. They will be changed every five years. As for how the switch will be done, it can be decided by strength, or something else!”

Meanwhile, an old man suddenly asked, “Young Brother Yang, will you be part of the Council of Elders? Or perhaps you will be above them? I know you’re not someone who’s greedy for power, but we have a rough idea on how to manage the Three Dimensional Universe, and you need an identity in all of it.”

The others gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye smiled, “To be honest, I haven’t given it much thought. What do all of you think?”

The old man hesitated for a moment and said, “You possess the Sprite Progenitor and divine vein, and your strength is the strongest among us. So, you should be the master of the Three Dimensional Universe, you…”

Yang Ye suddenly shook his head.

The old man stopped, gazed at Yang Ye, and waited for him to continue.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “That isn’t necessary. Not now, not ever!”

They gazed at Yang Ye with bewilderment on their faces.

Yang Ye explained, “Firstly, I’m not suited to be the master of the Three Dimensional Universe. I’m a lazy person, and I really don’t want to bother with all of that. Secondly, I don’t want anything to stand above the Council of Elders. Once someone is above them, it won’t be a good thing for the Three Dimensional Universe. As for my identity, why don’t I be the Protector of Order?”

“The Protector of Order?” All of them gazed at him with bewilderment.

Yang Ye nodded, “This order isn’t just something I set, it’s something all of us set together. So, I will protect it. If there is a problem with the Council of Elders or between all of you, I will step forward then. As for any other ordinary time, I wouldn’t be managing anything. Of course, let me be frank. I don’t wish to see any of you causing trouble. I’ll tell you right now that if anyone dares to break the rules of the order we’ve created, I won’t hold back at all!”

All of them came to an understanding at this point!

Yang Ye was the one who would monitor the Council of Elders. Or it could be said that he would be monitoring the Council of Elders and every other mechanism in the Three Dimensional Universe. He stood above the Council of Elders, but he would usually not interfere in their management, and he would only step forward to resolve the issues that arise internally in the Council of Elders!

They thought about it for a moment and nodded to display their agreement.

All of them were Destiny Realm experts, and if conflict were to arise between them, the entire Three Dimensional Universe may be thrown into chaos if someone didn’t stop them.

So, if someone was there to watch them, those with selfish intentions and motivations would have to reconsider their plans.

After all, Yang Ye was easy to get along with at most times, but when he wasn’t being nice, he was extremely difficult to get along with it!

Both the desolate race and Eternal Kingdom had experienced that for themselves!

Most importantly, Yang Ye was strong, and he could protect the universe.

Since they had no objections, Yang Ye nodded, “It’s decided then. As for the details of it, all of you can discuss it among yourselves and decide. Of course, you must remember that Eternal Kingdom isn’t absolutely safe right now. That mysterious expert and the remnants of the End World will not just give up, so you must be ready to fight at any moment!”

An old man at the Destiny Realm nodded, “Of course, Eternal Kingdom is our final home. If they dare to cause trouble here, all of us will protect this place with our lives!”

The others nodded.

Eternal Kingdom didn’t just belong to Yang Ye, nor did it belong to the Eternal Lord and the others, it belonged to the entire universe!

If anyone dared to cause trouble here, it would be harming all of their interests!

Ding Shaoyao glanced at Yang Ye and grinned.

It could be said that Yang Ye had used a rope to tie together all of these powers and experts from all over the universe!

Needless to say, it was a very wise decision. At any other ordinary time, asking them to protect a certain world would be something they would absolutely refuse to do. Every power and person had their own selfish desires!

But it was different now. This world belonged to them. At the very least, that was how they saw it. This world and the entire Three Dimensional Universe belonged to them. So, at a time like this, anyone who tried to destroy this world would be destroying their interests!

It could be said that it wasn’t Yang Ye who held the strongest hatred for the End World now, it was these powers!

Because the End World was the only threat to them in the entire Three Dimensional universe!

He moved their hearts with benefits!

They dispersed and only Ding Shaoyao remained.

Yang Ye looked up at the distant sky. He had two biggest enemies. The first was naturally the End World led by that mysterious expert.

The second was the strongest form of Destiny!

That woman who’d once suppressed the experts of the ages!

Ding Shaoyao asked softly, “What do you plan to do now?”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, “Continue investigating the whereabouts of that mysterious expert and the others.”

Ding Shaoyao hesitated for a moment and said, “Why not allow time to do the work for you?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “He still has some worries right now, but I’m afraid it won’t be long before he has nothing to worry about.”

Yang Ye looked up at the distant sky and continued, “Besides that, help me find someone!”

Ding Shaoyao asked, “Who?”

Yang Ye replied softly, “The Unfettered One!”

She asked, “Why?”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, “That mysterious expert has been getting help from the experts of Destiny’s era, and I want to get some help too!”

Ding Shaoyao was stunned speechless.
