Chapter 2308 – The Sword Too!

An act!

At this moment, the slovenly old man felt that Yang Ye was definitely acting like he was mad!

Obviously, Yang Ye knew the middle aged woman was strong, so he actually refused to attack her! Just think about it, how could a madman possibly be so rational?

Meanwhile, a palm suddenly pressed down on Yang Ye’s shoulder.

Bang!

A wave of powerful aura suppressed Yang Ye on the spot.

She sized up Yang Ye and said, “It isn’t an act.”

“Impossible!” The old man refused to believe it, “Big Sis, you saw it yourself. This fellow…”

She shook her head, “Instinct, it was an instinctive reaction!”

She gazed at him and continued, “Why does he keep looking for you?”

“I want to know the answer to that too!” The old man spoke angrily, “For some reason this kid just keeps trying to chop me into bits! I don’t remember ever offending him!”

She sized up Yang Ye and said, “He probably wants to train with you!”

The old man felt speechless.

She said, “His speed of cultivation is pretty good. He actually attained the 1st level of the Primal Saber Scroll in such a short while, and he even succeeded at cultivating Life Isolation. Even though it only has its form, but not its essence, it’s still difficult to come by. Especially after it has been enhanced by his Sword Domain and madness intent. They make its strength quite extraordinary.”

“Big Sis!” Meanwhile, the old man asked, “He can still use the Sword Domain with a saber in his grasp?”

“Why not?” She glanced at the old man, “There are numerous Grand Daos, yet they all converge and lead to the same path. Of course, using the Sword Domain on a saber isn’t as powerful as using it on a sword, but his madness intent makes his saber technique completely different from Third Brother. Third Brother’s attacks are swift, accurate, and carry a righteous aura, but this fellow’s attacks can be described with two words, mad and ruthless!”

The old man asked, “Which one of them is more promising?”

The woman shook her head, “That depends on them. However, this kid’s blade is more terrifying. His blade is used to kill. Once he enters into a state of madness, he won’t stop until the other person is dead. You don’t feel any pressure now because your strength far surpasses his, and you suppress him with your realm of cultivation. But if you’re near his realm of cultivation, you’ll sense how terrifying his blade is.”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and shook his head, “Even in the Primal Era, this fellow would definitely be able to survive and even become an overlord. But this character of his… Sigh, I wonder if it’s a good thing or bad thing for the Primal Saber Sect.”

She closed her eyes slowly, “Who knows? Right, don’t harm him if he comes to practice with you again. Just practice with him. Since he’s Third Brother’s disciple, he’s half a disciple to us too.”

The old man laughed bitterly, “Of course. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have shown mercy. Oh, Big Sis, why does that sly old man think so highly of this kid?”

She replied indifferently, “Ask him yourself!”

She glanced toward the distance and said, “Little girl, come with me!”

There was a woman standing there, Bai Zhixian! Actually, she’d arrived a long time ago. However, she didn’t show herself once she determined that they had no intent to harm Yang Ye.

Bai Zhixian thought for a moment on the spot and left with her.

The slovenly old man had quite a bit of embarrassment on his face, “Big Sis is still as hot tempered as always!”

Once she left, Yang Ye regained his freedom.

Once he was free again, Yang Ye grabbed his chopper with both hands and swung it at the old man.

The slovenly old man felt speechless.

Just like that, they started fighting again.

This time, the old man didn’t push Yang Ye back, and he just dodged and blocked Yang Ye’s every attack.

Just like that, rumbling resounded incessantly from outside the village.

…

In the village, the middle aged woman arrived at a garden. She withdrew a basket and passed it to Bai Zhixian, “Help me gather some vegetables!”

Bai Zhixian glanced at the woman. She didn’t refuse and just took the basket before walking into the garden.

Just like that, they each held a basket and started picking the vegetables in the garden.

A short while passed, and then Bai Zhixian hesitated for a moment and said, “Senior…”

The woman suddenly said, “You can call me Auntie Vege.”

Bai Zhixian thought for a moment and asked, “Auntie Vege, do you have any requests?”

Auntie Vege walked over to Bai Zhixian with her basket and squatted down beside her, “Little girl, I remember that old man gave you a spatial ring, so why did you refuse it?”

Bai Zhixian fell silent.

The woman smiled, “You like that kid!”

Bai Zhixian shook her head, “Senior, you may not know it but he thinks I’m someone else.”

“Oh?” The woman stopped what she was doing and said, “Tell me about it.”

Bai Zhixian fell silent for a while and explained, “He became like this because the woman he loved was killed by an organization in the outside world. He was too sad and became like this.”

The woman nodded slightly, “I didn’t expect him to be someone like that.”

She gazed at Bai Zhixian and continued, “What about you?”

Bai Zhixian was puzzled, “Me?”

The woman said, “We’re cultivators, so whenever we do things, even when it comes to emotions, we should follow our hearts. If we like something, we like it; if we dislike something, we dislike it. If you like something, strive to obtain it; if you dislike something, decisively choose to give up on it.”

Bai Zhixian fell silent.

Meanwhile, the woman walked over to Bai Zhixian and sat by her side. She said, “Do you know why that old man offered you that spatial ring and asked you to leave him?”

Bai Zhixian gazed at her, “Why?”

She smiled, “If you took that spatial ring, I guarantee that you wouldn’t be able to leave this place!”

“He would kill me?” Bai Zhixian’s expression changed slightly, “Why?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The woman explained, “Because that kid is someone he chose. I don’t know why he chose that kid, but I’m certain that kid is hiding some kind of secret. Obviously, that old man doesn’t want anyone with ill intent to be by that kid’s side. So, he offered you that spatial ring to test you. Luckily, you had some feelings for him, and that’s why he didn’t kill you and gave you Eternal Crystals instead!”

Bai Zhixian spoke solemnly, “Auntie Vege, why did he choose Yang Ye?”

She shook her head slightly, “I don’t know.”

She stood up slowly, “I need someone to help me manage this garden of mine. Are you willing to be that person?”

Bai Zhixian stood up, and then she knelt down before the woman, “Master!”

The woman looked up at the sky, “I’m a successor of the Immortal Slayer Sect from the Primal Era. If you become my disciple, it represents joining my Immortal Slayer Sect. Are you willing?”

Bai Zhixian naturally wouldn’t refuse, “Yes!”

The woman nodded slightly and raised her hands. Bai Zhixian was immediately lifted up by a wave of energy, and the middle aged woman said, “From this moment onward, you’ll stay with me! In the next year, the amount you learn will depend on your own luck!”

Bai Zhixian was puzzled, “A year?”

The woman nodded, “A year. One year from now, this village will vanish, and we will vanish too. Don’t ask me why. You’ll find out when you should find out!”

Bai Zhixian glanced at her, and she grew even more curious about everything in this place.

…

After that day, Bai Zhixian stayed with the woman, and Yang Ye practiced with the slovenly old man every day.

As time trickled by, Yang Ye’s saber technique grew in speed, ferocity, and strength.

At the village’s entrance.

Many villagers would spectate whenever Yang Ye went to the village’s entrance.

Yang Ye had the chopper in his grasp as he walked over to the slovenly old man, and the latter gazed at him and said, “Kid, bring it!”

Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot, and he was in front of the old man when he appeared again. After that, Yang Ye transformed into numerous afterimages, and the spectators could only see rays of light and nothing more.

“Madness Saber Technique!” Someone exclaimed.

Madness Saber Technique!

That was what they were here to watch! Some time during his training, Yang Ye had formed his own Madness Saber Technique. It was called Madness Saber Technique because Yang Ye swung like a madman every single time he attacked.

A breath of time later, Yang Ye suddenly stopped, but the saber energy was still there.

Yang Ye put the saber away and left.

Meanwhile, the slovenly old man stretched out his hand and touched the space in front of him. There was a palm-sized rift there.

A spatial rift!

Above the spatial rift was 100 marks from a saber.

100 swings in a breath of time!

He looked up at Yang Ye’s vanishing figure, and there was a trace of solemness in his eyes. In the beginning, when Yang Ye came to him to practice, Yang Ye’s saber technique was just a series of random swings. But as time passed, he noticed that Yang Ye’s saber technique was growing slightly different.

Firstly, it was growing in speed. Secondly, every single swing struck at the same spot! Moreover, Yang Ye could swing 100 times in a breath of time. That wasn’t terrifying, the true terrifying part was that no matter how he dodged, Yang Ye’s 100 strikes would still strike the same spot. For example, if Yang Ye’s fist swing struck his hand, then the second, the third, and every swing after that would strike his hand!

The most terrifying part was that the speed and strength of every single strike was the same!

That was why he didn’t forcefully block Yang Ye’s attack just now. Because even he couldn’t block it without suffering any injury. But his realm of cultivation was far above Yang Ye.

Of course, even though he couldn’t stop Yang Ye’s Madness Sword Technique without suffering any injury, he could destroy it. However, if he destroyed it by force, it would injure Yang Ye. So, he chose to dodge.

The slovenly old man was quite shocked.

Because Yang Ye was only at the Progenitor Realm!

But he was very well aware that even a True Void Realm expert wouldn’t be able to break open the space here with ease. But Yang Ye had accomplished that just now. This represented that Yang Ye’s combat strength was at the True Void Realm!

But Yang Ye was just at the Progenitor Realm!

Three days later.

Yang Ye arrived at the village’s entrance with his chopper, and the old man immediately jumped up from his wooden bench. He was still quite vigilant against Yang Ye. The kid before him would use surprise attacks. On one occasion, he’d gotten drunk and fell asleep, and he’d almost had his throat slit by Yang Ye. So, he didn’t dare to underestimate Yang Ye or be careless when facing Yang Ye anymore.

The old man gazed at Yang Ye with vigilance because Yang Ye never said a word before attacking.

Sure enough, Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot, and he was in front of the old man when he appeared again. Just as before, rays of saber energy surged toward the old man.

100 swings in a breath of time!

However, the old man managed to dodge 100 times in a breath of time.

At the instant Yang Ye’s final swing descended, a smile curled up on the corners of the old man’s mouth. But just a moment later, his expression changed drastically, and he forcefully twisted his body and dodge over 30m away.

There was a deep gash in his stomach!

The old man was stunned, and then he looked up at Yang Ye and cursed furiously, “Motherfucker! You’re using your sword too? The sword too?!”

Yang Ye stood not too far away from the old man, and he had the chopper in his left hand and a sword in his right hand!
