Chapter 2623

World! Assist me!

The Desolate Emperor was stunned by the sight of this, and then he roared madly with laughter!

“Haha!” The Desolate Emperor’s laughter resounded like thunder through the Origin World!

Meanwhile, Gu Jiantian’s expression turned extremely unsightly!

“Haha!” The Desolate Emperor almost teared up as he laughed. He gazed at Gu Jiantian and said, “I bet you never expected this! I bet you didn’t! Haha! I’m dying of laughter!”

Gu Jiantian glanced coldly at the Desolate Emperor, and then he gazed at the Divine Abode’s Master and the others, “You’re all a bunch of fools!”

At this moment, the Divine Abode’s Master and the others were watching the developments here.

Their expressions instantly turned unsightly when they saw Snowy!

If it was possible, they would kill the old man who harmed Snowy once more. No, they would do it thousands and thousands of times more!

In the beginning, the old man merely wanted to infuriate Yang Ye. Or to be more precise, he wanted to vent. After all, Qi Bitian had forced all of them to submission that day, and his brother had even died at Qi Bitian’s hands!

So, he wanted to vent!

But he just had to vent with the Sprite Progenitor… Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Even though she wasn’t the Sprite Progenitor yet, she was guaranteed to evolve into one!

Yet now, the little fellow had truly become the Sprite Progenitor!

As soon as Snowy said that, the entire Origin World was filled with clamorous noise!

No, the entire universe was surging!

Including Eternal Kingdom. At this moment, countless sprites heard Snowy’s call.

The call of the Sprite Progenitor!

Thus, countless sprites throughout the universe rushed toward the Origin World.

Including some of the sprites hiding within the Origin World!

Waves of spirit energy and pressure appeared within the Origin World.

Gu Jiantian’s expression turned extremely unsightly. Meanwhile, the Divine Abode’s Master’s voice came from above, “Seal off the Origin World! Don’t let those sprites get in here!”

Seal it off!

Gu Jiantian glanced coldly at Snowy, and the swords behind him trembled.

He seemed to be on the verge of attacking!

“Kill her!” The Desolate Emperor roared with laughter, “Gu Jiantian, hurry up and kill her! You’re so strong, so just one attack would be enough to kill her!”

Gu Jiantian stared at Snowy, but he didn’t attack or leave.

Meanwhile, the Desolate Emperor said, “Stop looking at her and just seal off the Origin World. You wouldn’t dare to kill her no matter how brave you are. She’s blessed by the heavens and protected by it. Killing her will doom you forever.”

Gu Jiantian glanced at him, “Didn’t you kill a Sprite Progenitor once too?”

The Desolate Emperor’s face instantly turned icy cold, “A piece of trash like you isn’t worthy of being compared to me!”

Gu Jiantian revealed a wisp of ridicule on his lips, “Desolate Emperor, you’ll suffer a horrible death!”

He vanished into the sky once he finished speaking.

A short while later, countless rays of sword energy surged up into the sky, and then they rippled towards the surroundings.

Sealing off the Origin World!

Many experts were helping from the shadows as well.

More and more sprites were gathering outside the Origin World… Actually, the experts of the Origin World didn’t fear these sprites.

The problem was they couldn’t kill them!

They would get into serious trouble if they killed these sprites!

The heavens didn’t pay attention to the killing between humans and the other races of this universe! However, if the humans and the other races dared to slaughter these sprites, they would definitely suffer calamity!

The sprites were born of this world, and they were part of the Three Dimensional Universe… Simply speaking, they were on Destiny’s side.

Destiny may fail to sense the death of a few, and Destiny may ignore it as well.

However, if they dared to slaughter such sprites and catch Destiny’s attention… Then they wouldn’t have to worry about how troublesome it would be, they would have to be thinking about how they wished to die.

They cared so much about that mysterious place because it had an important function, and it was the ability to conceal them from Destiny and allow them to survive!

So, they could only keep the sprites from entering the Origin World!

However, it couldn’t be maintained for long. Because the sprites gathered here weren’t weak at all. Otherwise, the desolate race wouldn’t have been repulsed!

At that time, the Desolate Emperor was absolutely formidable, but he had no choice but to choose to retreat.

It was because even if the desolate race could win the battle, they would be courting death. Because it was victory built on the slaughter of countless sprites.

Many weren’t aware of it but the Desolate Emperor had been punished for that battle!

It was the true reason why he’d willingly gone into seclusion for so many years!

Snowy flew over to Yang Ye and An Nanjing.

At this moment, Snowy was emanating a pure aura. Her appearance hadn’t changed, but her aura had!

It was very strong!

Not any weaker to a Destiny Realm expert!

If the sprites of the universe could get into the Origin World, she would be able to converge their strength, and that would make her even stronger!

Unfortunately, the sprites were being kept outside.

Of course, the seal couldn’t stop them. After all, there were countless sprites in the Origin World too.

Snowy touched Yang Ye gently. Fortunately, there was Primordial Violet Energy, so Yang Ye was still fine. But An Nanjing wasn’t in a very good state!

She didn’t have Primordial Violet Energy!

Snowy hurriedly poured Primordial Violet Energy into An Nanjing, and her injuries gradually started to heal up.

However, Yang Ye’s slaughter intent was growing even denser.

His slaughter intent was unprecedentedly strong!

Meanwhile, An Nanjing stood up, and then she hurled her spear forward.

Hiss!

Something seemed to be pierced open above Erya, and then Erya’s figure was freed. She returned to Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s side.

At this moment, she was covered in a vicious aura!

She seemed to have sensed something and entered the Primordial Pagoda. She arrived before the bamboo house that Qi Bitian had lived in, and then her gaze descended upon the box within it.

Erya walked over with indifference on her face. A moment later, the box shook, exploded apart, and then a pure white fragment floated over to her.

The pure white fragment entered her body!

Boom!

In an instant, the bamboo house was obliterated, and then Erya’s pupils gradually started to transform.

They were growing darker. In the end, they were pitch black like an abyss. Besides that, her claws had grown longer. Most importantly, the horns on her head were many times longer… And they were still growing!

Just like that, Erya started to transform in every aspect… It was especially so for her aura. It was growing increasingly evil and vicious!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Snowy held Yang Ye tight and didn’t let him run wild.

At this moment, Yang Ye was being influenced by his slaughter intent and just wanted to kill!

However, for Yang Ye’s safety, Snowy didn’t dare to let him go anywhere. She just held tight to his neck. While Yang Ye’s desire to kill was extremely strong, he was exceptionally normal when facing Snowy and An Nanjing. Or it should be said that he wouldn’t attack them!

An Nanjing walked over to Yang Ye and glanced at the surroundings. At this moment, Tian Xiu was in battle with four peak Destiny Realm experts!

Just as the white robed middle aged man had said, “While they couldn’t kill her, Tian Xiu couldn’t overcome their joint forces either!

Qi Bitian and the other group were in a deadlock as well.

She didn’t attack, but the Violet Dimensional Threads around her were getting closer.

It could be said that if this continued, it would be very bad for them!

An Nanjing gazed at Snowy. Snowy was furious!

She felt like everyone was bullying them!

So, Snowy floated up into the air, and then ripples of spirit energy swept toward the surroundings.

At this moment, the entire universe shook!

Because countless sprites were rushing madly toward the Origin World. In the beginning, they just wanted to enter the Origin World. Yet now, they were attacking the Origin World!

Attacking it!

Meanwhile, some sprites had appeared around the bridge. There were all sorts of sprites here. Some weren’t very strong, but some were.

For example, a flame behind Snowy. Its true form was unknown, but it was at the Destiny Realm!

It was the first to come to Snowy’s side!

Moreover, besides the especially weak sprites within the Primordial Pagoda, the powerful sprites had left the pagoda. Especially the pool of lightning!

It was outside of the pagoda!

The pool of lightning converged in the sky above the bridge, and countless arcs of lightning flashed within it!

It was like the end of the world was here!

At this moment, the Origin World had undoubtedly incurred public wrath!

True public wrath!

Suddenly, Gu Jiantian appeared on the bridge, and he arrived near Yang Ye and the others. He glanced coldly at Snowy, and then he gazed at An Nanjing, “Woman! Tell her to stop! Otherwise, I’ll kill all of you!”

The flame behind Snowy abruptly transformed into a wave of fire that swept at Gu Jiantian!

A ferocious grin appeared on Gu Jiantian’s lips, and then a wave of sword energy rippled out and sliced apart the ocean of flames!

Gu Jiantian stared at Snowy, “I’ll tear you apart if you don’t stop now!”
