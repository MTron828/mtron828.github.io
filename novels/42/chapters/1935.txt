Chapter 1936 – Protect My Sky Race for Years to Come!

The Sages of the human race and shaman race!

Yang Ye found out from the old woman that two extraordinary experts were actually hiding here.

She was about to leave when Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Why?”

She stopped and gazed at him.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “I think that’s not normal! Look, my natural talent and strength aren’t bad. Logically speaking, they should be fighting to take me as their disciples!”

“Fighting to take you as their disciples?” The woman laughed coldly, “You’ve trained your skin to such a thickness at your age! Amazing!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

Meanwhile, the old woman added, “Your natural talent can only be considered to be ordinary, but since you were able to get here, it represents that your fortitude and strength are extremely formidable. Inferior natural talent isn’t a big problem for us, the most important is fortitude and strength. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have been waiting at the back of the Sky Stairs.”

Yang Ye asked, “And?”

She continued, “Do you know why they’re unwilling to give you their inheritances?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

The old woman looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Because you’re dying!”

I’m dying?! Yang Ye was stunned on the spot.

Meanwhile, the old woman continued, “Your Vitality Star has dimmed down to the point it’s almost dead. I forgot that you can’t see your own Vitality Star, so enjoy the remaining time you have!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished on the spot.

Vitality Star?

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he asked, “Senior, do you know what she’s talking about?”

Hou Qing spoke solemnly, “You can consider it as a person’s vitality. Everyone has their own Vitality Star, but only Sage Realm experts can see it. You… you don’t seem like someone who’ll die earlier! So, the only explanation is that someone or something is absorbing your Vitality Star!”

Yang Ye’s face fell!

He’d encountered a Sage previously, but that Sage hadn’t told him about that. Obviously, his Vitality Star was fine then. In other words, the problem occurred when he arrived at the Sky Dimension!

Is it an expert from the sky race?

However, that explanation wasn’t very likely. After all, if the sky race wanted to kill him, they had many ways to do so. They could even just kill him without hiding it, and there was no need to go to such lengths.

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a long time and asked, “Can’t the Primordial Pagoda sense it?”

Hou Qing spoke solemnly, “That’s the terrifying part of it. Even the Primordial Pagoda can’t sense it. So, it means there are only two possible circumstances. That old woman was trying to scare you, or the strength of the person who’s acting against you has arrived at an extremely terrifying level. For example, a Sage. However, if it’s a Sage, there’s no need to use such tricks to kill you!”

Hou Qing paused for a moment and continued, “No matter what, tell Yin Hou to take you back to the Shaman Dimension once you’re done here and tell her to take you to one of the almighty figures of my shaman race. Let them have a look at you.”

Yang Ye nodded. That was the only thing he could do.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, looked up, and saw that he only had around 100 steps left to reach the end of the stairway.

To go? Or not to go?

Yang Ye thought for a moment and continued forward.

Since he was here, he intended to go until the end!

Just like that, Yang Ye continued forward, and he moved quite quickly. Yang Ye gradually noticed something off about the area.

His feet felt heavy!

His feet had suddenly started to feel heavier, and he was still around 70 steps away from the end!

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he turned around to have a look.

As soon as he did that, Yang Ye was stunned.

Because there was no one behind him. Even Yin Hou and the others outside the Sky Stairs had vanished!

It was strange!

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he looked up at the end of the stairway. It was extremely calm, and there was nothing there!

A short while later, Yang Ye continued forward.

It didn’t take him long to grow closer and closer to the end of the stairway. Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye stood at the end of it, and the boundless starry sky was beyond it.

Besides that, there was nothing else here!

Yang Ye shook his head and intended to leave. Suddenly, a voice resounded in his ears, “Sigh, after so many years, it’s a fellow who has great karma coiled around him!”

As soon as the voice finished resounding, a white robed old man appeared in front of Yang Ye.

The old man had snow white hair, kept his hands behind his back, and had a strange mark on his forehead.

Yang Ye glanced at the old man and asked, “Senior, who are you?”

The old man shook his head slightly, “Do you know that you’re the first person to get here safely in the countless years of the past?”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “Is it very difficult?”

The old man replied with a question, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye replied, “It was very easy for me. I didn’t encounter any difficulties!”

The old man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “I’m really curious. Why didn’t the Sky Stairs stop you?!”

“Stop me?” Yang Ye asked, “It always stops others?”

The white robed old man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “Strange! So strange!”

He gazed at Yang Ye, “You’re strange too. I’ve never seen someone who’s entangled with so much karma. Most importantly, every single one of them counters the other…” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, can you help me deal with them?”

The old man was slightly stunned, and then he shook his head, “I can’t!”

Yang Ye asked, “Can you see my Vitality Star?”

The old man moved his gaze over to Yang Ye’s head and nodded, “I can!”

Yang Ye asked, “Is it very dim?”

The old man nodded slightly, “It’s about to die!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

The old man replied, “You’re gotten mixed up with something unclean!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Meanwhile, the old man suddenly asked, “Why is it targeting you?”

Yang Ye was about to speak when the white robed old man frowned slightly, and then he waved his right hand. An explosion suddenly resounded deep within the starry sky outside the Sky Stairs.

Yang Ye glanced in that direction before looking at the old man. At this moment, the old man had looked down at his palm, and there was an extremely deep cut there.

He’d been injured!

Yang Ye’s expression instantly changed. The old man’s strength was at least at the Sage Realm! However, that thing hiding in the shadows had actually been able to harm him?

When did I get mixed up with something unclean?”

Yang Ye was filled with questions!

A short while passed before the old man gazed at him, “Do you have something with you?”

Yang Ye asked, “What do you mean?”

The old man spoke solemnly, “Based on its strength, killing you is absolutely easy. But it has chosen to use such a method to seize the energy of your Vitality Star. If I’m not wrong, you have something that instills fear in it and has made it fear getting close to you!”

The Primordial Pagoda!

Yang Ye thought of the Primordial Pagoda. Because only the Primordial Pagoda could instill fear into something that could harm a Sage.

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, can you help me eliminate it?”

The old man shook his head, “I can’t. because I can’t leave the Sky Stairs!”

So, Yang Ye was in trouble!

Yang Ye’s heart sank. Because unless a Sage was willing to help him, even Yin Hou would probably be unable to help him deal with it!

“I’m more curious about why the Sky Stairs didn’t stop you!” The white robed old man suddenly said, “For countless years, no matter which race someone came from, they’ll be stopped 50 steps away from me. However, you were able to get here. Kid, can you tell me why?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Senior, why think so much about it? Let’s be direct. If you want to give me your inheritance, then do so. I usually don’t refuse. Conversely, be frank if you don’t want to. I wouldn’t dare to force you!”

The old man shook his head, “You’re quite frank!”

Yang Ye smiled and didn’t say another word. He just gazed at the old man.

The old man didn’t say anything as well. Both of them fell silent.

A short while later, the old man shook his head, “I’m afraid no one else will be able to get here after you. Even if someone does, I’m afraid I’ll have to wait countless years. Fine, I’ll let the heavens decide if it’s fortune or bad luck!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand, and white energy streamed out from him. The white energy converged above him, and it didn’t take long for a small pure white dragon to appear above him!

However, the dragon was in deep sleep.

Yang Ye asked, “What’s that?”

The white robed old man replied, “The Sky Dragon! The Sky Dragon that’s considered an equal to the True Dragon!”

Yang Ye asked, “What can it do?”

The old man looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Have you heard how they say someone is the son of the dragon?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The old man explained, “In the Human Dimension, the Sovereign of Man possesses the protection of the True Dragon. So, he’s the leader of the human race, and he’s the son of the dragon. As for my sky race, the Sovereign of Sky possesses the protection of the Sky Dragon!”

The Sovereign of Sky!

Yang Ye glanced at the white robed old man before him. At this moment, he knew who the old man was.

Yang Ye said, “The sky race has a Sovereign of Sky! Is he a descendant of yours?”

The old man shook his head slightly, “Just like the human race, the position of sovereign isn’t passed down in a family, and it’s taken by the strong. After all, if a weakling rules, then that race would be in grave danger. Moreover, weaklings can’t convince their entire race to follow them. Right?”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Senior, you want me to become the sky race’s Sovereign of Sky?”

The old man replied, “No! Because you’re not suited to be a leader. I want you to become the sky race’s protector and protect my sky race for years to come!”
