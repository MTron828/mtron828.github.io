Chapter 1818 – I’ll Show You A Bloodbath!

Come get it!

As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, the surroundings fell silent, and only the sound of the wind could be heard.

An instant!

A 6th stage True Realm expert had been killed in an instant!

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye, and there was deep fear in their eyes!

It wasn’t rare to see monstrous geniuses defeat 6th stage True Realm experts or even kill them, but a 2nd stage True Realm expert had actually killed a 6th stage True Realm expert in an instant!

An instant!

What did that mean?

It meant that Yang Ye’s strength far surpassed ordinary 6th stage True Realm experts!

People with such strength did exist, but they were older cultivators or ancient cultivators!

But Yang Ye was clearly not someone like them!

A monstrous genius!

A true monstrous genius!

Ye Ku’s eyes had a solemn expression in them as well. Because even he couldn’t kill a 6th stage True Realm expert in an instant, but Yang Ye could.

At this moment, he’d truly stopped underestimating Yang Ye!

However, it was clearly impossible to make him give up. Not to mention him, the others around him wouldn’t give up so easily as well.

Everyone here had experienced moments of life and death, so Yang Ye’s strength wasn’t enough to scare them off.

Unless an ancient cultivator came here!

Meanwhile, Ye Ku suddenly said, “I underestimated you. However, do you think that you can fight my organization with just you and these women by your side? If that’s what you think, then I can only say that you’re mistaken!”

“One on one!” Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly raised his sword and pointed it at Ye Ku, “I don’t know what the Night Assassins are, and I don’t want to know. All I want is to fight you, one on one!”

Ye Ku’s face fell, “Looks like you’re very confident. Young man, you….”

Yang Ye interrupted Ye Ku, “Can you cut the crap? Are you going to fight me one on one, or will it be a group battle? Fighting you one on one isn’t bullying you, right? If it’s a group battle, then let’s just begin!”

Ye Ku’s face became extremely unsightly when Yang Ye acted so aggressively. However, no one could see the change in his expression because he was covered in his black robe. However, the violent aura coming from him allowed everyone to know that he was furious!

One on one or a group battle?

If he were being honest, he wanted to fight Yang Ye in single combat. After all, he was at the 6th stage of the True Realm, and Yang Ye was just at the 2nd stage of the True Realm. If he didn’t accept the challenge, then it would be a huge humiliation for him. However, the scene of Yang Ye instantly killing a 6th stage True Realm expert still lingered in his mind.

A moment of silence ensued before Ye Ku suddenly replied, “I’m not a match for you!”

Everyone here was stunned by this. Even Yang Ye was stunned. Is he trying to play some sort of trick? Or is he really admitting defeat?

Suddenly, Yang Lianshuang said, “How smart!”

Nether Maiden and the others gazed at her.

Yang Lianshuang smiled, “Saying that represents that he doesn’t have to fight Yang Ye in single combat. Because he has admitted defeat. I know you’re all puzzled by why he did that. It’s because of his mental state. It’s so that no inner demons are formed within him.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “He had no way out of the situation just now. Fighting would lead to his death; and refusing to fight would allow him to live. However, he’ll suffer from inner demons if he refuses to fight. Even if he makes up reasons for himself, inner demons will still be formed. Deceiving oneself is a taboo for all cultivators.”

An Nanjing said, “So, he chose to just admit defeat instead?”

Yang Lianshuang nodded, “By admitting defeat and admitting he’s no match for Yang Ye, he doesn’t have to fight Yang Ye in single combat, and he doesn’t have to risk forming inner demons within him. Because he didn’t lie to himself. He really is no match for Yang Ye, and it isn’t an excuse but an admission of his own weakness. Under such circumstances, not only will he be able to avoid any inner demons, he may even be able to improve his mental state!”

Nether Maiden and the others nodded as they understood Ye Ku’s plan.

Needless to say, what Yang Lianshuang said made a lot of sense. If Ye Ku chose to fight under such circumstances, he would die; if he chose not to fight, he would have to make up an excuse. The reason he had to make up an excuse was so that he wouldn’t lose face. But once he did that, it would be no different than lying to himself!

However, he didn’t make up an excuse and just admitted to being no match for Yang Ye. In that way, he didn’t have to fight Yang Ye in single combat or lie to himself, so it wouldn’t cause inner demons to form within him and spoil his mental state!

It was a smart choice!

Ye Ku glanced at Yang Lianshuang, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, I admit that you’re an outstanding genius. But your current strength can’t keep that sword safe. Hand it over, and I can guarantee that we Night Assassins won’t pursue the matter of you killing our members. Moreover, you can even join the Night Assassins. What do you think?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “How about you let me think about it for three days?”

Ye Ku’s face fell, “Looks like you insist on courting death.”

He immediately waved his right hand, and a talisman shot up into the sky. A moment later, the talisman exploded apart in midair, and then a teleportation platform appeared there.

Yang Ye looked up at it and said, “I’m so envious!”

Blood Maiden asked, “About what?”

Yang Ye replied, “It would be great if I could just toss a talisman, and then people would come to help me!”

Blood Maiden patted him on the head, and then she shook her head, “Stop daydreaming!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Suddenly, a black robed old man emerged from the teleportation platform in the sky, and then the expressions of everyone here changed.

Pressure!

As soon as the old man arrived here, everyone felt a wave of invisible pressure descend upon them!

Meanwhile, Ye Ku went over to welcome the old man and bowed slightly, “Elder Ye Ning, I had no choice but to disturb you….” As he spoke, he pointed at Yang Ye and started to explain.

Around ten breaths of time later, the old man, Ye Ning, suddenly gazed at Yang Ye. His gaze stopped at Yang Ye for a moment, and then it fell onto the wooden sword.

A moment of silence ensued, and then he waved his right hand. In an instant, the wooden sword shook violently and seemed to be about to fly towards him.

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded from the wooden sword, and then a ray of sword energy surged out from it. The sword energy was extremely swift, and it instantly arrived before Ye Ning.

Resistance!

The wooden sword was resisting! It was resisting before Yang Ye even did anything!

Meanwhile, Ye Ning waved his right hand, and the sword energy vanished without a trace. After that, he immediately clenched his right fist in the wooden sword’s direction, and then a wave of powerful suction force enveloped the wooden sword.

Suddenly, a wave of powerful sword intent enveloped the wooden sword.

Om!

As soon as the sword intent enveloped it, the wooden sword shook violently, and then a sword howl shot up into the sky. The sword howl obliterated the suction force, and the wooden sword flew into Yang Ye’s grasp!

Meanwhile, Ye Ying’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye, “I’ve met many monstrous geniuses, and I’ve killed many as well.”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Blood Maiden suddenly grabbed his arm, “I’ll do it!”

Yang Ye felt warm. He knew that she was worried about him. Because the old man wasn’t comparable to any ordinary 6th stage True Realm expert. Perhaps the old man couldn’t compare to the ancient cultivators, but he was definitely one of the older experts!

A true old monster!

Yang Ye shook his head, “It’s fine! I’ll do it!”

Blood Maiden was very strong, and she may not lose to Ye Ning. However, he still wanted to do it himself.

Fight!

He too yearned for battle. Battle with a true expert. Every single battle with his life on the line was able to help him improve, and that improvement wasn’t just in terms of strength, it was an improvement of the mental state as well.

Blood Maiden asked, “Are you sure?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I am!”

Blood Maiden nodded slightly, “I believe in you!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she gazed at Ying Ku’s group, “My Nether Pavilion doesn’t want trouble, but we don’t fear trouble either. If you want to fight, we’ll accompany you to the end!”

She waved her right hand, “Kill them without hesitation!”

Her figure immediately transformed into a blood red ray of light that shot towards Ye Ku. At the same time, Yang Lianshuang and the others charged at the experts behind Ying Ku.

Fight!

A fierce battle instantly erupted!

Fortunately, the space in Divine Ruins City was sufficiently strong, or the entire city may have collapsed from the battle.

Even then, the buildings in a huge area were obliterated.

At this moment, countless experts were curious. They were curious about who Nether Maiden and the others were. After all, they’d never been seen in Heaven Pillar Mountain before this. So, the others were naturally curious, and they were especially curious about Nether Maiden and the others’ strength. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Even though they were just ordinary True Realm experts, their strength was absolutely extraordinary. Every single one of them could surmount their realms of cultivation to do battle!

Where did they come from?

Yang Ye and Ye Ning still hadn’t entered into combat. The reason Yang Ye had chosen not to attack was that he wanted to recover even more profound energy.

Utilizing the Grand Teleportation Technique and Split Second earlier had exhausted almost half of his profound energy reserves. So, if Ye Ning didn’t attack, he would naturally not attack. Every single moment he delayed was a little more time to recover!

Ying Ning wasn’t attacking because he had something to say.

Ying Ning gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “You’re a genius. Unfortunately, you’re not very bright!”

Yang Ye chuckled and said, “That’s how I am. I don’t have anything but a terrible temper. If someone is good to me, then I’ll be good to them; if someone bullies me….” Yang Ye’s face suddenly became ferocious, “I’ll show that person a bloodbath!”
