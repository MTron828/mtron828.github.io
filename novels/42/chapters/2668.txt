Chapter 2669 – We Have Big Brother Yang!

The Destiny Realm!

Yang Ye was full of curiosity toward the place the woman in black resided in.

What kind of place was it?

There was a huge stellar vortex before him.

An endless expanse of stars was within it.

Besides that, Yang Ye saw the mummy from before standing by the stellar vortex.

An Emperor Corpse!

At this moment, Yang Ye knew its origins. It was a being from a very, very long time ago. It was once an extremely formidable existence. Unfortunately, it met Destiny.

Moreover, it had met the complete form of Destiny!

So, it suffered for its bad luck and was nailed here!

Simple speaking, all who tried to defy the heavens in the past suffered, practically none of them ever had it turn out well for them!

The mummy immediately gazed at Yang Ye upon noticing his arrival. It was about to attack when a pitch black sword floated before Yang Ye.

The mummy hesitated for a moment upon seeing the sword, and then it moved to the side.

Yang Ye walked over to the Emperor Corpse, sized it up, and said, “I think you’ve been punishing it for far too long!”

The woman in black laughed coldly from within the Primordial Pagoda, “Do you know that this fellow slaughtered the living beings of an entire world just to grow stronger? He turned them into an army of corpses, and then he made them attack the Three Dimensional Universe in order to break through it and enter the Four Dimensional Universe. Do you know how many living beings suffered because of him?”

Yang Ye’s face froze. In the end, he patted the mummy’s shoulder lightly, “You brought this upon yourself. I can’t help you!”

If it had just fought against Destiny, then Yang Ye felt that getting it freed wouldn’t be that difficult. The problem was that this fellow had slaughtered the living beings of an entire world. That was a little too cruel!

Once he finished speaking, Yang Ye was about to enter the stellar vortex when the mummy spoke abruptly, “Help…”

Yang Ye stopped and glanced at it. He was slightly shocked because it could still speak!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and nodded, “I’ll try my best!”

He turned around and walked into the vortex.

Once Yang Ye entered the stellar vortex, the Emperor Corpse suddenly said, “Thanks…”

Obviously, it has discerned the unusual relationship between Yang Ye and the woman in black, and it felt that Yang Ye was its only chance. After all, it had been imprisoned here for so long. It couldn’t gain freedom yet didn’t wish to die either, so now that it finally had a chance, it naturally refused to let that chance escape it!

Once Yang Ye entered the vortex, it didn’t take long for him to arrive within a teleportation passageway.

In the passageway, Yang Ye saw many strange symbols, and they covered the entire teleportation formation.

Yang Ye sized up the surroundings and said, “Right, I met someone called the First God. He seemed to have been imprisoned by you too?”

In the Primordial Pagoda, the woman in black replied indifferently, “So?”

Yang Ye smiled and replied, “It’s nothing. I’m just curious. Anyway, how many existences like that have you imprisoned?”

She thought for a moment and said, “Quite a few. However, at that time, a certain fellow with horns on her head was my biggest target!”

Erya!

Yang Ye’s face darkened. He knew she was talking about Erya!

In the Primordial Pagoda, Erya suddenly stopped in the middle of playing with Snowy and glanced at the wooden house. She laughed coldly, “Just you wait. I’ll punch apart the heads of every one of you people called Destiny!”

The woman in black laughed coldly as well.

Yang Ye had quite the headache. Both of them were too hostile, and he could imagine how fierce their conflict had been in the past.

In order to prevent any fights from breaking out in the pagoda, Yang Ye hurriedly diverted the woman in black’s attention, “Um, can I ask you something? What’s the strongest existence you’ve imprisoned? Is it that mummy from before? Or was it First God?”

This time, she fell silent.

Yang Ye wanted to ask more, but she suddenly spoke coldly, “What’s with all the questions? Are you asking for a beating?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Her temper was like that of a child, her emotions just changed in an instant!

Yang Ye didn’t pursue an answer. He just sped up, and it didn’t take long for him to arrive at the end of the passageway.

Yang Ye left the teleportation passageway, and he appeared on a boundless plain.

On the plain, there were flocks of sheep and herds of cows dashing by from time to time.

Yang Ye was stunned.

Meanwhile, the woman in black appeared by his side.

She glanced at him. Yang Ye wisely chose not to provoke her because her temper was absolutely terrible.

Meanwhile, the cows and sheep suddenly charged at her. A short while later, they were surrounded by the cows and sheep.

At the same time, Snowy and Erya appeared here.

The two little fellows had been in the pagoda for too long and wanted to have some fun outside.

Even though the woman in black didn’t get along with Erya, fortunately, they didn’t get into a fight!

The woman in black walked over to a sheep that led the flock. It was slightly different from the others. Its horns were violet while the others had black horns.

The woman in black touched its horns gently, and it gently rubbed its head on her. Meanwhile, the woman waved her right hand, and then all sorts of spirit herbs and fruits rained down here.

The cows and sheep were overjoyed.

Meanwhile, Snowy flew over to the sheep that led the flock. The woman in black frowned slightly from the sight of this, but it didn’t take long for her frown to ease up.

Snowy held the sheep’s horns with both her paws and was jumping about on it.

Yang Ye’s face darkened.

The woman in black’s face was quite dark too, and no one knew what she was thinking.

Meanwhile, Erya suddenly leaped up and appeared on the cow that led the herd. It was an extremely huge cow, and it was much larger than the others.

Erya had chosen it!

Erya gazed at Snowy, and Snowy gazed at her. The two little fellows smiled at each other, and then Erya kicked the cow lightly, causing it to charge off into the distance.

Actually, the cow below Erya was absolutely anxious!

It was anxiety that came naturally. Erya was too, too terrifying to it! So, once Erya sat on it, it didn’t dare to resist at all. Moreover, it hurriedly showed respect to Erya!

It was much better for the sheep below Snowy. After all, Snowy was a kind sprite.

Just like that, Snowy led the flock of sheep while Erya led the herd of cows, and the two little fellows and their groups charged through the plain.

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled wryly as he sighed to himself.

Meanwhile, the woman in black suddenly gazed at Yang Ye and laughed coldly, “Look how you’ve taught them. These two fellows don’t act like strong experts at all!”

Yang Ye felt speechless. It’s my fault now?

The woman in black ignored Yang Ye and the two little fellows. She just walked off to the side, and Yang Ye hurriedly followed her.

He wasn’t worried about Snowy and Erya’s safety because it would be quite strange for there to be danger here.

Who would dare to come here and cause trouble?

Yang Ye followed the woman to a river. The river ran through the plain, and both of its ends stretched far beyond the limits of Yang Ye’s vision. There was a small pavilion made of wood by the river.

Yang Ye saw a painting by it. A blue painting. It was a painting of the starry sky, and it included everything within it!

The woman in black entered the pavilion while Yang Ye stopped before the painting instead. He scanned it curiously, and it didn’t take long for a solemn expression to gradually appear on his face. It was because he’d noticed that it was actually a map!

A map of the Three Dimensional Universe!

This map could be said to be the most comprehensive map of the Three Dimensional Universe!

Yang Ye gazed at it for a long time. After he memorized it, he entered the pavilion. It was empty on the inside. There was just a hexagonal stellar array in there, and the woman in black was seated cross-legged on it.

Countless strands of spirit energy were surging out of the array and converging into her.

Suddenly, she opened her eyes and gazed at him, “What?”

Yang Ye smiled embarrassedly, “Nothing. I just came in to look out of curiosity.”

She withdrew her gaze and continued absorbing the spirit energy from the hexagonal array.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Yang Ye left the pavilion. He glanced at the surroundings, and this place felt extremely peaceful to him.

Yang Ye looked back at the pavilion, and he knew it wouldn’t take long for the woman to recover.

Yang Ye’s face fell when he thought of some things.

A short while later, he shook his head and smiled.

Why am I worried about all of that? Everything will work out in the end.

Meanwhile, rumbling came from afar.

Yang Ye looked over, and he saw Snowy and Erya charging with their gang of cows and sheep. The two little fellows were having the time of their lives!

Yang Ye didn’t pay further attention to them. He just sat down cross-legged by the pavilion and started cultivating!

The spirit energy here was quite different from the outside world, and he planned to use this opportunity to cultivate.

An hour later, Snowy and Erya stopped.

Snowy sat on Erya’ shoulder and commanded Erya forward. The cows and sheep followed behind them!

Erya withdrew a tanghulu, licked it, and then said, “Snowy, are you sure there are treasures ahead?”

Snowy nodded. She was very certain!

Erya shot a glance in the pavilion’s direction and spoke casually, “Snowy, I have to warn you, that woman is quite strong, and her temper isn’t that great either. If we steal her treasures. Oh, I mean… If we take them. If we take her treasures, what if she notices? We may suffer a beating.”

Snowy blinked and glanced in the direction of the pavilion. In the end, she thought for quite a while before pointing at Yang Ye’s figure by the pavilion. She was saying that they had no nothing to fear because they had Yang Ye.

Erya thought for a moment and said, “Right, we have Big Brother Yang!”

As they spoke, the two little fellows sped up.
