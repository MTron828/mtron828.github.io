Chapter 1189 – The Sword Intent From Godfall Mountain!

The corners of their mouths twitched when they heard him. His confidence is truly unbelievable!

Huan Kong gazed at Dugu Jian and said, “Can’t you just be a little humble?”

“Humble?” Dugu Jian laughed coldly, “That’s what weaklings do. Alright, let’s cut the crap and begin right now. I’ve waited too long for this day to come!”

Qin Zhuyao glanced indifferently at Dugu Jian, and then he glanced at the others, “All of you have no objections, right?”

They hurriedly shook their heads. Obviously, they were infuriated by Dugu Jian.

Qin Zhuyao nodded slightly, “Since no one has any objections, then let’s continue!”

As she spoke, she turned around and started walking towards Godfall Mountain.

Huan Kong glanced at Dugu Jian and said, “Let’s go, master of bragging. Let us see how great you are.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he didn’t wait for Dugu Jian to reply and just followed after Qin Zhuyao.

Lin Fan glanced at Dugu Jian, and then he followed them as well. Yang Ye followed behind Qin Zhuyao as well. He wasn’t really interested in the competition; all he was interested in was whether the Stellar Sword Diagram resided at the top of the mountain. Not only did it possess extraordinary might, it might carry the secrets of the Sword Domain. So, he had to obtain it!

Dugu Jian glanced at Qin Zhuyao and the others, grunted coldly, and then started traveling forward as well. He was extremely swift, and it only took him a short while to be at the front of the group. Qin Zhuyao and the others naturally refused to allow that, so they sped up simultaneously. Especially Huan Kong and Lin Fan, both of them seemed like they’d used a Strider Talisman and were moving swiftly.

Yang Ye smiled as he watched them, and then he sped up as well.

In the beginning, all of them could maintain almost the same distance between each other, but as they continued forward, the gap between them grew clearer. Many were growing slower, and in the end, they were practically forcing themselves to persist forward. Only Qin Zhuyao, Dugu Jian, Huan Kong, Lin Fan, and Yang Ye were able to maintain a stable speed.

It wasn’t too difficult for Yang Ye, Qin Zhuyao, and Dugu Jian, both Lin Fan and Huan Kong were finding it quite difficult to maintain.

As they grew closer to Godfall Mountain, the sword intent Jian Wuji left behind grew more and more terrifying. Presently, they felt like over a dozen mountains were pressing down onto them, and every single step they took felt like 5,000kg was weighing down on them! Moreover, the vicious energy within the sword intent was growing stronger and stronger, and many were on the verge of being unable to resist it anymore.

Yang Ye frowned. Because the sword intent didn’t just contain a vicious aura, he’d noticed the intent to kill within it as well.... However, this didn’t really surprise him. The most surprising fact to him was that he’d noticed a trace of unwillingness in the sword intent, and it was growing stronger the closer they got to Godfall Mountain.

Vicious energy, killing intent, and unwillingness! Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye looked up at Godfall Mountain, are these a representation of Jian Wuji’s feelings from all those years ago?

“I... I can’t go on anymore!” Suddenly, a weak voice resounded from behind the group. They turned around and saw a young man in linen robes supporting himself up with one of his knees, and he was gasping for breath on the ground.

The others glanced at him before withdrawing their gazes and continuing forward. Because it was very normal for something like that to happen. Every single year, many would fail before they even arrived at the foot of the mountain.

The expression of the man in linen robes eased up when he saw the others continuing forward, and he lied on the ground and relaxed completely.

This was how the world was. So long as you gave up, your life would be very relaxed at all times. But while it seemed to be relaxed, it was actually very sad.

Yang Ye gazed at the man and hesitated for a moment before flashed over to the man’s side, “You’re giving up just like that?”

The man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “I... I can’t hold on any longer!”

Yang Ye asked, “Their sword intent is at the Quasi Void Rank just like you, so why can they but you can’t?”

The man’s lips moved slightly, but he didn’t say much in the end, “I....”

Yang Ye gazed at him and said, “If I’m not wrong, your strength is the weakest amongst the people here, right?”

His face grew slightly unsightly, but he couldn’t refute it because it was a fact.

Yang Ye pointed at the others in the distance and said, “They are able to persist, yet you’ve given up. Will you be able to obtain their acknowledgement and respect if you act like this? To be honest, I believe that so long as it’s someone who possesses strength, that person will not become friends with someone who gives up easily, let alone respect that person. This is a world where strength is respected, and only strength will bring you respect!”

“I....” The main was about to speak when Yang Ye interrupted him, “Do you want to be stuck at Quasi Void Rank sword intent forever?”

The man immediately replied, “I don’t!”

Yang Ye said, “But do you think someone who likes to give up will be able to attain Void Rank sword intent? To be honest, while you’re at the Quasi Void Rank as everyone else, your sword intent is much weaker. If you don’t work hard, persist, and change, then you’ll be stuck at the Quasi Void Rank forever!”

As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, he stretched out his hand and said, “Don’t waste your breath. If you’re a man, then stand up and continue!”

The man in linen robes gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then he stretched out his hand and took Yang Ye’s hand. Yang Ye exerted a little force and instantly pulled him up, “Trust me. If you don’t push yourself, you’ll never realize how outstanding you truly are.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around and started walking towards Godfall Mountain.

The man behind Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he started walking again. Even though it was still extremely strenuous, he didn’t give up this time. He gritted his teeth and persisted.

Yang Ye didn’t move very quickly and just followed by the man’s side, “See, you’ve gone so far by just persisting for a while.”

The man nodded while a slight smile curled up on the corners of his mouth.

After walking for around 15 minutes, the man in linen robes turned to look at Yang Ye and said, “I’m Zuo Lang, what’s your name?”

Yang Ye grinned, “Yang Ye!”

Zuo Lang was stunned, and then he shook his head, “Since you’re unwilling to tell me, then it’s fine. No matter what, thank you for the guidance. You were right, I should push myself.”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched slightly, he doesn’t believe me.

Meanwhile, Zuo Lang suddenly said, “They’ve sped up!”

Yang Ye raised his head and looked over. Sure enough, Qin Zhuyao and Dugu Jian were speeding up incessantly, and they were practically jogging.

As for Lin Fan and Huan Kong, they’d been left far behind.

Zuo Lang said, “That fellow, Dugu Jian, is quite strong!”

Yang Ye glanced at Dugu Jian and nodded slightly, “He’s not bad indeed!”

Zuo Lang suddenly said, “You seem to be quite strong as well!”

Yang Ye grinned, “I’m alright!”

Zuo Lang continued, “You should go on first. There’s no need to wait for me. I’ll persist until I’m forced to the ground!”

Yang Ye glanced at him and said, “You’re an independent cultivator?”

Zuo Lang nodded, “Actually, most of the people here are independent cultivators.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’m at Cloudfall City. You can come to Cloudfall City if you have the chance, and we can spar in the Dao of the sword!”

Zuo Lang smiled, “Of course!”

Yang Ye smiled. Actually, it was just a spur of the moment that made him guide Zuo Lang. He felt a rather strong connection when he saw Zuo Lang give up. After all, while he was a Labor Disciple in the Sword Sect, he’d thought about giving up as well. However, what was the consequence of giving up? In this world where strength was respect, one might die at any moment if one didn’t possess powerful strength!

It was too easy to give up yet too difficult to persist. One should always push oneself to go on. If one did that, one would notice that one was actually much more outstand than one had ever imagined! It was like Yang Ye’s body. Everyone just saw how strong his body was, but they didn’t know what sort of horrible pain he’d endured to attain such physical strength and defenses. If he hadn’t been able to endure the pain, then would his body have been able to become so strong? Obviously, that would be impossible.

Since the time that he was a Labor Disciple until attaining the Saint Realm now. Yang Ye had been constantly pushing himself!

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, restrained his thoughts, and gazed towards the distance. At this moment, Dugu Jian and Qin Zhuyao had left the others far behind them, and they were less than 300m away from Godfall Mountain. However, they’d slowed down as well. Moreover, their countenances had started to turn pale. It was even to the extent that every single step they took would leave behind a deep footprint on the ground.

It was a sign that their sword intent’s ability to resist the sword intent coming from Godfall Mountain was weakening!

Meanwhile, many others in the surroundings had slowed down. Many even took more than 100 breaths of time just to take a single step forward. However, Yang Ye was quite surprised because not a single one of them had given up, not even Zuo Lang who’d given up before. At this moment, all of them were gritting their teeth tightly as they persisted forward, and some of their eyes were even bloodshot.

But none gave up!

Yang Ye glanced at them and thought to himself, “These fellows are not bad....”

“Shit! Dugu Jian is about to overtake us!” Meanwhile, someone in the surroundings spoke abruptly. The others immediately raised their heads, and they saw that Dugu Jian was already over 1m ahead of Qin Zhuyao.

The others’ expressions changed slightly when they witnessed this. Because they naturally didn’t want Dugu Jian to win. But based on the current situation, Dugu Jian had an extremely high chance to win!

“Look! Qin Zhuyao is speeding up as well!” Meanwhile, Qin Zhuyao was growing faster and faster, and the gap between her and Dugu Jian was growing shorter. Moreover, she faintly showed signs of overtaking him.

Just like that, both of them chased after each other, and it didn’t take long for them to arrive at the foot of Godfall Mountain. Right when they arrived there, a strand of terrifying pressure pressed down from above and slammed them towards the ground.

Pu! Pu!

Both of them spat out a mouthful of blood at the same time and almost fell to their knees. However, they forcefully prevented that from happening.

Both of them looked up and there was shock in their eyes. A moment later, they charged forward once more, but they were pressed back down again.

Huan Kong who’d just rushed over and arrived behind them said, “We can’t go up!”

Lin Fan nodded, “No more than 5 throughout history have been able to ascend the mountain! As for someone capable of reaching the peak, that has never happened. The best had only been able to travel around 1km up the mountain!”

Huan Kong turned to look at Dugu Jian, “Let’s consider it a tie?”

“A tie?” How laughable!” Dugu Jian laughed coldly, and then a strand of terrifying sword intent surged out from within him. As soon as the sword intent emerged from him, Qin Zhuyao and the others were instantly pushed over a dozen steps back!

Void Rank sword intent!

All of them were stunned!

Dugu Jian leaped up onto the mountain. After he arrived over 10m up the mountain, he looked down at Qin Zhuyao and the others, “I possess Void Rank sword intent!”

As he spoke, he stretched out his hand and pointed at them before he shouted, “I, Dugu Jian, possess Void Rank sword intent! Hahaha!”
