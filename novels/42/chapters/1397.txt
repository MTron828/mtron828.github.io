Chapter 1398 – Doomsday!

The sword energy shot into the city.

Bang!

The shattered remains of Skyriver City were instantly blasted into bits.

Cries of shock and misery resounded incessantly throughout the city.

The lucky survivors fled madly towards the surroundings because no one dared to stay in the city now.

Yang Ye watched coldly from high above, and there was no pity in his eyes.

Feeling pity for one’s enemies was foolish.

His plan was to cause the greatest commotion as possible, try his best to make the Alliance of Guardians call back its forces from Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region, try his best to draw the attention of Celestial Demon Stellar Region and Skyriver Stellar Region, and try his best to alleviate the pressure Lady was enduring.

The best way to do that was what he was doing right now!

Even their base of operations had been destroyed, so he refused to believe that the experts from the Alliance of Guardians could still remain calm and composed. Of course, it didn’t matter if they really refused to return. In any case, there were no Deities in Skyriver Stellar Region, so he could kill as he pleased!

A wisp of ruthlessness curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth as he looked down below, and then he sheathed his sword. At the same time, the profound energy within the Worldmend Stone started to circulate madly.

Rumble!

Meanwhile, 10 auras shot up into the air from the ruins of Skyriver City. It didn’t take long for 10 old men to appear where Yang Ye had been standing.

At this moment, Yang Ye was gone. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The black robed man who led the group spoke ferociously, “Who is that? Why is he targeting our Alliance of Guardians?!”

Meanwhile, a grey robed old man by his side spoke solemnly, “It should be Yang Ye!”

Yang Ye!

All of them gazed at the grey robed old man, and then they seemed to have thought of something, causing their expressions to become extremely unsightly.

That name was naturally not unfamiliar to them. It belonged to someone that the Alliance of Guardians had unanimously agreed to eliminate. Because Yang Ye’s strength was too terrifying. The largest reason was Yang Ye’s natural talent and potential. In just less than 2 years, Yang Ye had grown to the point of being able to kill Semi-Deities.

If he attained the Voider Realm, would he be able to kill Deities like they were just helpless sheep?

So, the only Deity left in Skyriver Stellar Region had decided to head to the Radiant Dimension.

Logically speaking, since a Deity had gone to deal with Yang Ye, it should have been accomplished with ease. But they still hadn’t seen that Deity until now. However, they weren’t worried because it was truly quite difficult to kill a Deity.

Yet now, Yang Ye was here. But there had been no news from that Deity.

All of them had thought of a certain possibility, so their faces had instantly turned pale.

Meanwhile, the grey robed old man spoke in a low voice, “Don’t scare yourselves. Yang Ye is an extraordinary genius, but it’s impossible for him to kill a Deity. Someone definitely helped him.”

All of them fell silent.

They would have believed the grey robed old man if he said all of that a while ago, yet now.... Yang Ye had instantly annihilated 3 Semi-Deities just now!

3 Semi-Deities in an instant!

Such strength was something only a true Deity possessed. In other words, Yang Ye’s strength was already comparable to a Deity.

A few moments of silence ensued, and then a white robed old man spoke solemnly, “Immediately notice Elder Cang’s group!”

“That’s not advisable, right?” Meanwhile, one of the old men said, “The battle on Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region is at its peak. It won’t take long for it to be completely conquered. At that time, our territory will double at the very least. If we retreat now, we might be unable to gain any new territories once Celestial Demon Stellar Region conquers Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region.”

All of them fell silent. Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region was about to fall, and if nothing unexpected happened, it would definitely be crushed. If they retreated now, it would be equivalent to giving everything away to Celestial Demon Stellar Region. That would harm all their interests, and it would be a huge loss for all of them!

Meanwhile, one of the old men spoke in a low voice, “We have 4 Deities there, so we can bring one back. A Deity and us should be sufficient to deal with Yang Ye.”

All of them hurriedly nodded because it was a good solution.

An old man immediately withdrew a violet transmission talisman and crushed it, and it didn’t take long for the space in front of them to tremble before returning to normal a few breaths of time later.

The grey robed old man spoke solemnly, “From this moment onward, we have to be absolutely careful and be vigilant at all times. Moreover, we can’t split up. Once we split up and give him an opportunity, then we....”

Suddenly, the space around 30m before them rippled, and then a beam of sword energy swept out from there. It was so swift that they hadn’t even been able to react before one of the old men stiffened on the spot. It didn’t take long for the old man’s figure to become ethereal and vanish on the spot.

All of them were horrified!

This time, their reaction wasn’t slow, and they immediately slapped their palms at the expanse of space where the sword energy had come from.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

In an instant, that expanse of space was obliterated.

A short while later, it was completely repaired, but there was no sign of Yang Ye.

All of them had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces!

Yang Ye had killed another Semi-Deity in front of them, yet they hadn’t even been able to catch sight of his shadow!

That was absolutely terrifying!

Actually, once they found out that it was Yang Ye, the fear they experienced had reduced quite a bit. Because so long as Yang Ye dared to show himself, they would definitely dare to fight him. After all, Yang Ye was just an Emperor and not a Deity. If they were terrified by an Emperor to the point of being afraid to fight, then it would be an absolute humiliation for them, and they wouldn’t be able to let themselves do that.

Yet now, Yang Ye refused to show himself and fight them, and he was just launching surprise attacks! The most terrifying part was that Yang Ye’s ability to conceal himself was too formidable!

He was completely undetectable and killed with a single strike!

Was he even a sword cultivator? No! He was like an assassin!

A long while of silence ensued, and then the grey robed old man spoke solemnly, “Ask Elder Cang to send someone back as soon as possible. From this moment onwards, we’ll join forces to fortify the space in an area of 300m around us, and then we wait for our reinforcements to arrive!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the 9 of them nodded and started fortifying the space around them. It didn’t take long for the space around them to be strong like a fort. Now, it was impossible for anyone to enter this expanse of fortified space without them noticing. Moreover, once someone entered by force, they would sense it at the first possible moment!

Time passed slowly, yet there was no movement in the surroundings.

However, all 9 of them didn’t dare act carelessly at all. Their minds were tense, and their eyes were filled with vigilance.

Around 15 minutes later.

“Ah!!” Shrill cries suddenly started resounding in the ruins down below.

All 9 of them were shocked. Meanwhile, a middle aged man arrived before them and spoke in a trembling voice, “Someone is assassinating our Voiders!”

The Voiders! Their expressions instantly turned gloomy when they heard this. The Voiders were the middle level force of a power, and they absolutely couldn’t be overlooked. After all, once a war occurred, it was impossible for only Deities to fight. Moreover, Voiders could pose a threat to Semi-Deities. Because the gap between Voiders and Semi-Deities wasn’t that huge!

They hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually act against the Voiders. Even they couldn’t resist him, let alone those Voiders!

One of the old men spoke in a low voice, “What do we do now?”

“Head down there!” The grey robed old man spoke in a low voice, “If we don’t, he’ll annihilate all the Voiders. Moreover, it’ll bitterly disappoint all our subordinates. So, we must head down there!”

They nodded, and then she shot towards the ruins of Skyriver City.

However, Yang Ye was gone when they arrived there, and only corpses were left behind. There were Voiders and Emperors amongst the corpses, but most were Voiders.

One of the old men spoke in a low voice, “He’s too swift, and his ability to conceal his aura is too formidable!”

“Ah!!” Suddenly, a shrill cry resounded from 3km away.

Their expressions changed, and then immediately shot over to the source of the shrill cry. At this moment, a corpse was lying there.

The corpse of a Voider!

Meanwhile, another shrill cry resounded from over 5km away!

They were about to rush over when the grey robed old man suddenly said, “There’s no need to go there. It’s too late. Notify all the Voiders and Emperors to converge with us. We must form a joint defense!”

They nodded, and then they hurriedly notified the Emperors and Voiders in the city.

It didn’t take long for all of them to converge with the grey robed old man’s group.

At this moment, there were 9 Semi-Deities, 26 Voiders that were made up of true and ordinary Voiders, and over 300 Emperors.

They were all the experts of Skyriver City!

The grey robed old man ordered in a low voice, “Fortify the space around us!”

As soon as he finished speaking, all of them hurriedly did as he said. It didn’t take long for the space around them to be solid as dark steel, but they still didn’t dare relax and were fully vigilant!

One of the old men by the grey robed old man’s side spoke in a low voice, “Now what?”

“Wait!” The grey robed old man said, “Wait for a Deity from our side to arrive!”

All of them nodded. Yang Ye was too terrifying, and only a Deity could deal with Yang Ye. If they were to leave this place, then not to mention killing Yang Ye, they might not even be able to see him before they lost their lives.

They had to wait!

Wait until a Deity arrived!

Suddenly, someone cried out involuntarily with astonishment, “Look there!”

They looked over towards the distance, and they saw a man in green clothes walking slowly towards them with a sword in his grasp.

Yang Ye!

Their expressions instantly changed.

Yang Ye couldn’t be said to be walking very quickly, but every single step he took seemed like it stomped down on their hearts, causing them to feel suffocated.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to grow closer and closer to them!
