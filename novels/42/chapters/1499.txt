Chapter 1500 - That Sword! It’s Mine!

Translator: InVader

Little Sky spoke with Little Little Sky for around 15 minutes before she turned around and floated over to Yang Ye and the others.

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “What did it say?”

Little Sky nodded slightly, “It agreed.”

Lian Banzhuang and the others were overjoyed when they heard this. They were finally able to leave after being imprisoned here for so long, so how could they not be happy?

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief as well. He’d promised them that he would take them out of this place, so he would be in trouble if she refused. He didn’t want to be someone who didn’t keep his promises. However, he didn’t want to fight the Eyes of the Heaven Dao. Moreover, even if he did try to fight them, he couldn’t win against over 100 Eyes of the Heaven Dao!

Fortunately, he didn’t have a problem now!

Suddenly, Little Sky added, “But there’s a condition!”

Yang Ye asked, “What condition?”

Little Sky glanced at Lian Banzhuang and the others, “They can’t stay in this universe. As invaders, they aren’t welcomed by the Eyes of the Heaven Dao in this universe. If they don’t leave this universe upon leaving this place, it’s very likely that they’ll be pursued by the Eyes of the Heaven Dao. So, they must leave this universe once they leave this place.”

“Of course!” Meanwhile, the old man with a hunched back hurriedly said, “Don’t worry, Miss Little Sky. We’ll immediately leave this universe upon leaving this place!”

Little Sky nodded slightly, “Then go on.”

“Thank you!” Lian Banzhuang and the others bowed slightly to Little Sky, and it was a sincere bow.

Little Sky spoke softly, “It’s quite sad that all of you have been locked up for so long. But it’s still best not to kill too much from now on. Karma will come to bite you if you kill too many. In most cases, it isn’t that there’s no karma, it’s because it isn’t time for karma to strike.”

The old man with the hunched back spoke seriously, “We will remember that!”

Little Sky nodded, “Go on, Little Little Sky will send all of you out of this universe.”

As she spoke, she transformed into a ray of light that entered Yang Ye’s chest.

Once she left, the old man and the others gazed at Yang Ye and Blood Maiden. They bowed towards Yang Ye and Blood Maiden, and then the old man said, “Thank you. We will never forget this kindness!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t mention it. We would be dead if it wasn’t for all of you.”

The old man grinned, “Young Brother, if you have the time, come to Stellar Cloud System. I…”

Yang Ye gazed at the old man with a puzzled expression on his face, “Stellar Cloud System?”

“It’s the name of their universe!” Blood Maiden spoke abruptly, “An area larger than a world is called a Stellar Region, and an area larger than a Stellar Region is called a universe. In the beginning, the universe was a single whole, but they split the entire universe into countless small universes. Simply speaking, it’s like a continent that was split into countless smaller kingdoms! Our universe is called the Merak System.”

Yang Ye asked, “Then how huge is the universe?”

Blood Maiden shook her head, “No one knows the answer to that question. Even the cultivators of the ancient times don’t. Because it’s truly too huge. It’s really boundless.”

The old man nodded, “The entire universe is really too huge. However, the smaller universes aren’t that huge. Our Stellar Cloud System isn’t far from Merak System, so you can come visit in the future.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course!”

The old man smiled, “Young Brother, see you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man with a hunched back shot up into the air, and then he arrived before Little Little Sky. The latter shook slightly, and it didn’t take long for a circle of light to appear by Little Little Sky’s side. The old man took a deep breath as he gazed at the circle of light, and his eyes flickered with excitement. He didn’t hesitate to enter the circle of light. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Meanwhile, Demon Wu cupped his fist towards Yang Ye, “I’m sorry for the past offence. Farewell!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he entered the circle of light.

In next to no time, only Lian Banzhuang and the Lava Titan remained here.

Lian Banzhuang gazed at Yang Ye, “Thank you!”

As she spoke, she paused for a moment and continued, “That day when you were fighting Demon Wu, I didn’t stand by idly on purpose. I hadn’t recovered fully. I merely said what I said on a whim.” As soon as she finished speaking, she entered the circle of light.

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he shook his head and smiled. On a whim…

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at the Lava Titan, “Aren’t you going to leave?”

The Lava Titan shook its head, and then it stretched out its hand. A ball of flames appeared on its palm, and then a young girl emerged from the flames. It moved the young girl towards Yang Ye.

As soon as she saw Yang Ye, a brilliant smile instantly appeared on her face, and then she flew over to him and started clapping happily.

Yang Ye rubbed her little head and gazed at the Lava Titan, “What do you mean?”

The Lava Titan spoke, “She goes with you!” Even though it was speaking the human tongue, it wasn’t smooth.

“With me?” Yang Ye was slightly stunned and asked, “Why?”

The Lava Titan replied, “Go with you! Good for her!”

Yang Ye came to an understanding. The little girl had been transformed by the Divine Yin Flame, and the Lava Titan had definitely noticed the changes in her. So, it wanted her to go with him.

Yang Ye fell silent for a while, and then he gazed at the young girl, “Are you willing to go with me?”

She bit her finger, glanced at Yang Ye, glanced at the Lava Titan, and seemed quite hesitant. Meanwhile, Yang Ye smiled, “If you miss it, we can come back at any time to visit. Alright?”

The young girl’s eyes lit up, and then she nodded.

A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth. The young girl was a Sprite King, and she was at a much higher level than the flames which Mo Xiaoleng possessed. Coupled with the fact that the Divine Yin Flame had improved her, she was definitely much stronger than ordinary Sprite Kings. So, having her with him was a good thing!

The little girl flew over to the Lava Tian, and then hugged it for a long time. In the end, the Lava Titan turned around and left. Two streams of tears instantly flowed down from her eyes when she saw the Lava Titan leave. No, it should be two streams of lava.

Yang Ye took her in his arms and consoled her, “We can come here frequently to visit.”

She glanced at Yang Ye, nodded, and then tapped his chest while looking at him with eyes filled with a hopeful gaze.

Yang Ye smiled, and then he waved his right hand. He instantly transported her to the 2nd level of the Primordial Pagoda. Once she arrived there, she instantly ran over to the Divine Yin Flame!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye gazed at Blood Maiden, “Where do you plan to go now?”

Blood Maiden pondered deeply for a moment and said, “I plan to look for them, and then go find our eldest sister!”

“Find her?” Yang Ye continued, “Even you don’t know her whereabouts?”

Blood Maiden shook her head slightly, “Her injuries were too severe, and her body couldn’t be used anymore. So, she chose to be reincarnated. She was afraid that the Oracle would determine her whereabouts, so she sealed her memories and everything else. Unless her memories are unsealed, no one can find her. However, her memory should be recovering slowly now. So, we must find her before the Oracle does. Otherwise, she’ll be in huge danger!”

“The Oracle?” Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “Who is that?”

“A person who says that she can predict the future!” Blood Maiden spoke solemnly, “Since you helped me, you have definitely become one of her targets. You have to be careful from now on. She’s very adept at scheming. She was a huge part of the reason why we were forced to flee to the lower dimensions. So, you must be careful of her.”

Yang Ye nodded. Since the Oracle could make Nether Maiden and the others suffer a loss, he naturally wouldn’t underestimate the Oracle.

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something and said, “Can you help me with something?”

Blood Maiden replied, “Go on!”

Yang Ye said, “Come with me!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot with Blood Maiden.

15 minutes later, Yang Ye arrived at a pool. It wasn’t part of Yellow Springs River, but that old man was imprisoned below it.

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment, and then he went below the pool.

The old man was slightly stunned when he saw Yang Ye. Obviously, he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to come so soon. It didn’t take long for a wisp of surprise to flash through his eyes, “You’ve attained the Semi-Deity Realm?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Not too long ago!”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye, “I presume you obtained some sort of fortuitous encounter, right?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Indeed. I’m here to free you.”

The old man asked, “You can accomplish that with your current strength?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I should be able to. However, I have a question. Why were you imprisoned here?”

He’d always been very curious about that. Because it was definitely not the Lord of the Heaven Dao who’d imprisoned the old man here. The formation that imprisoned the old man was done by a cultivator.

The old man remained silent for a short while, and then he said, “A mysterious person. I don’t know who he was. All I do know is that there was another snake that was imprisoned at the same time as me!”

A snake! Yang Ye glanced at the old man. Obviously, it was the Ancient Emperor Python. Why was the Ancient Emperor Python imprisoned? It was because of its vicious nature and because it wreaked havoc everywhere. Obviously, the old man wasn’t a good person as well. Otherwise, that expert wouldn’t have imprisoned the old man.

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment, and then he walked over to the old man and said, “I promised you that I would free you when I had the ability. Now, I’m here to fulfil my promise.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he flipped his palm, and the Sword Precursor appeared in his grasp.

The old man’s eyes instantly narrowed when he saw the Sword Precursor, “A sword that surpasses the known ranks of quality!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he raised it and swung it!

Crack!

A clear and resounding crack resounded, and then the iron chains that imprisoned the old man broke into pieces.

Bang!

Meanwhile, a terrifying aura suddenly surged out from within the old man!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly because the old man was a Dualism Realm expert!

What did that represent?

It represented that the old man was once a Rebirth Realm expert, and then his cultivation was suppressed upon arriving here. After all, this place wasn’t the forbidden area of the Ominous Territory.

Huff!

The old man took a deep breath, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “That sword of yours could have cut these chains that day, so why didn’t you do so?”

Yang Ye glanced at the old man and said, “No matter what, you’re free now, and I’ve fulfilled my promise. Farewell!”

Suddenly, the old man appeared in front of Yang Ye, “That sword! I want it!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “What are you trying to say?”

“You don’t understand?” The old man spoke coldly, “I said that I want that sword.”

Yang Ye replied, “What if I refuse?”

“Then die!” As soon as he finished speaking, the old man slapped his palm at Yang Ye.

However, Blood Maiden suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye.
