Chapter 1830 – World Transformation!

Pierced?

My defense was pierced?

Yang Ye was quite stunned. His current defense was absolutely terrifying. However, the wooden sword had actually pierced through it with such ease!

That was very abnormal!

Because while the wooden sword was powerful, it wasn’t that easy for it to pierce through his defenses. Yet now, it had done so with such ease!

Suddenly, Snowy was stunned, and then she started crying before grabbing the wooden sword with both claws and pulling it.

Hiss!

Blood instantly sprayed out.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Snowy glanced at the wooden sword, glanced at Yang Ye, blinked, and revealed an innocent expression.

Suddenly, Yang Ye gazed at his arm. The injury on his arm was healing at a visible pace, and it took less than two breaths of time to be completely healed!

Yang Ye gazed at Snowy. The latter blinked, rubbed her eyes, and then gazed at Yang Ye’s arm. There was no injury there. Meanwhile, Snowy suddenly raised the wooden sword with the intent of stabbing Yang Ye’s arm, but Yang Ye hurriedly moved his arm away. He didn’t dare to let the wooden sword stab himself again.

It was quite mysterious!

Meanwhile, Hou Qing appeared by Yang Ye’s side, “Are you very curious? Curious about why it can pierce through your defenses with such ease?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Hou Qing asked, “Do you know why this sword was made?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Hou Qing replied, “Because of the shaman race. My shaman race fought the human race on countless occasions. But the physical defenses possessed by my shaman race was the humans’ worst headache. In the end, for the sake of countering my shaman race, they asked many almighty figures to create this sword. Understand now? This sword was specially made to deal with my shaman race. It innately counters many cultivation techniques of my shaman race! Not to mention the Undying Hegemon body, even a better body refinement technique would still be incapable of stopping it.”

So that’s why! Yang Ye laughed bitterly. He hadn’t expected the wooden sword to have been specially made to counter the shaman race. So, he had been courting death just now.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing added, “Kid, you must remember that there’s no form of absolute defense in this world. Everything has a counter, and the most formidable defense has something that can pierce through it. So, you can’t get overconfident. Once you do, you’ll lose yourself, and then you won’t be able to understand your own limits. At that time, you won’t live for long. Understand?”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a long time and cupped his fist to Hou Qing, “I understand!” Just as Hou Qing had said, he’d become a little too overconfident. Once that happened, one would become conceited, and the consequence of conceit was usually death!

Hou Qing nodded, “It’s good that you understand. Your Blood Rebirth has actually surpassed its original effects. Just like that injury from before. If I suffered that injury, it would take over two minutes before it started to recover slowly, and it would take at least an hour to be completely healed. But you only took a few moments to get fully healed!”

Yang Ye asked, “Is it because of my violet energy?”

“That's the main reason!” Hou Qing continued, “Your pure violet energy is very extraordinary. However, it isn’t the only reason, the Fruit of Rebirth played a big part too. The Fruit of Rebirth has fused with your body, and it has healing properties too. Coupled with your own self recovery, it can be said that your body has three types of recuperative abilities.”

Three types!

A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth. Presently, unless he encountered one of those truly terrifying experts like the woman in a red dress, Ying Jing’s main body, or Hao Tian, he was impossible to kill!

His current strength was extraordinary even without a sword!

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something and suddenly gazed at Hou Qing, “Senior, doesn’t the Undying Hegemon technique have three levels? What's the third level?”

Hou Qing pondered deeply for a moment and replied, “World Transformation!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “World transformation? What’s that?”

Hou Qing replied, “Transforming your body into a world. You are the heavens and the earth. In short, it’s a very miraculous state. Even in my shaman race, no more than ten have succeeded at cultivating it. Only those with great wisdom and natural talent are able to succeed because it requires comprehension and not cultivation!”

World Transformation! Yang Ye looked forward to it. Even though he focused on the cultivation of the sword, the feeling of using his fists in battle was extremely pleasant.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing added, “Kid, you have the aura of my shaman race now. So, it’s very likely that you’ll encounter a huge amount of trouble once you go to the large universe. Besides that, you’re a human too. So, if the members of my shaman race find out that you’re human yet have cultivated our techniques, you’ll be in deep trouble too. In short, you’ll be in deep trouble!”

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “I have to go up there no matter what problems I have to face!”

At this point, he’d realized that many things were impossible to avoid, and he had to face it.

Hou Qing nodded slightly and remained silent.

After chatting with Hou Qing and Qiong Qi for some time, Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda. He hadn’t forgotten that his destination was the Nether Abyss.

In the outside world, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. Endless mountains filled his eyes, and they stretched on until the end of his vision.

Even though his strength had risen tremendously, he still didn’t dare to act carelessly. Because it was very likely that an existence like Hao Tian was present within these mountains. Encountering experts at such a level was still very dangerous for him.

Meanwhile, Snowy appeared on his shoulder.

Snowy scratched his ear gently and pointed ahead.

Yang Ye rubbed his head against her head, and then vanished into the boundless forest.

He’d sped up!

He’d wasted some time cultivating, so Yang Ye sped up. All along the way, he shot forward while relying solely on his physical strength, and it caused the space around him to ripple.

A day later, Yang Ye stopped.

There was a towering mountain not too far away from him. It extended far into the distance like a colossal beast.

“Nether Mountain!” Blood Maiden suddenly appeared beside Yang Ye.

Yang Ye looked over. The mountain was absolutely silent, and there wasn’t even the sound of an insect.

Blood Maiden suddenly frowned, “Something seems off.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Very!”

It was quiet!

Too quiet!

Based on his experience, it was absolutely impossible for this endless mountain range to be this quiet. There could only be two reasons for this. The first was that there was no life here, and the second was that a powerful existence resided here. So, no other living beings dared to get close to this place!

Yang Ye felt that the second possibility was more likely.

Blood Maiden said, “Be careful!” She entered the Primordial Pagoda once she finished speaking.

If it was in the past, she would definitely go with Yang Ye. Yet now, based on Yang Ye’s current strength, unless he encountered an ancient cultivator, then ordinary 6th stage True Realm experts were nothing to him!

Once Blood Maiden entered the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye looked up at the mountain. He didn’t hesitate to shoot towards it.

Yang Ye didn’t notice anything all along the way, but he remained vigilant at all times.

Snowy seemed quite carefree on his shoulder. She was looking all around and seemed to have no idea that there might be danger here.

In next to no time, Yang Ye arrived at the top of the mount.

Yang Ye looked around, and then a solemn expression appeared on his face.

There were numerous stone poles before him, almost 100 of them. They were around 15m tall, and they had sharp tops. There was a person stabbed on every one of them.

Every one of them had died the exact same way, the tip of the stone poles had stabbed through their heads.

Yang Ye gazed at the stone pole right before him. There was an old man there. The old man had clearly not died for long because blood was still dripping from his head.

Most importantly, Yang Ye noticed that the weakest amongst the dead here were at the 5th stage of the True Realm!

What the heck is this place? Yang Ye frowned.

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi’s voice suddenly resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Kid, something feels off!”

Yang Ye rolled his eyes. Isn’t that obvious?

Meanwhile, Hou Qing’s voice resounded in his mind as well, “I can’t sense anything from within this pagoda, but my instinct tells me that you shouldn’t stay here for long.”

Yang Ye nodded. He didn’t want to stay too. Even though he was very confident in his current strength, there were countless experts in this world, and those with strange and extraordinary ability were innumerable as well. So, it was best to keep a low profile and be careful!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. Once he confirmed that there was no danger, he shot towards the distance.

The Nether Abyss was at the back of Nether Mountain. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

His objective was the back of Nether Mountain!

But he didn’t go far before stopping again. There were over 20 bloody heads in front of him. All of them were looking in his direction, and every single one of their eyes was open. Yang Ye saw terror in their eyes!

Snowy blinked on Yang Ye’s shoulder. In the end, she patted Yang Ye on the shoulder, and then fled into the Primordial Pagoda.

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. That little fellow just fled once she noticed the situation is bad! Traitor!

Yang Ye glanced at those heads and was about to continue forward when Hou Qing’s voice suddenly resounded in his mind, “You’re finished!”

Yang Ye was puzzled when a pair of hands suddenly covered his eyes. At the same time, a voice resounded in his ears, “Guess who….”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
