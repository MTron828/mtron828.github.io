Chapter 2784 – Self-Sacrifice to the Sword!

Along with the mysterious expert’s arrival, the situation here grew even more disadvantageous to Yang Ye’s group.

Yang Ye gazed at the woman in white, “I’m sorry!”

He chose to attack, yet now, not only was he in a hopeless situation, he’d dragged her into it. He couldn’t help but feel quite apologetic about it.

She smiled, “It was coming sooner or later!”

Once she finished speaking, Past Life suddenly started shaking violently, and then it shot up into the air. In an instant, countless rays of sword energy rained down like a storm.

Yang Ye gazed at An Nanjing, and she shook her head. Yang Ye smiled bitterly, “Just this once.”

She fell silent for an instant, and then she entered the Primordial Pagoda.

An Nanjing was strong, but only people who were exceptionally strong could fight this battle. He was very sure that if An Nanjing fought in this battle, she would definitely die under the joint forces of dozens of peak Destiny Realm experts!

Not to mention the mysterious expert and Monarch Yan were here!

Once she entered the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly. In an instant, he emanated boundless slaughter intent and sword intent!

The Demonic Sword Dao!

At this moment, he didn’t dare to hold back at all!

Suddenly, Monarch Yan’s pike left his grasp. In an instant, the woman in white’s sword energy was obliterated inch by inch. At practically the exact same moment, the mysterious expert appeared before Yang Ye!

Yang Ye’s sword left its sheath!

The mysterious expert didn’t try to dodge it and allowed Yang Ye’s sword to descend. However, it only hit an afterimage. Meanwhile, a black palm suddenly slammed down on Yang Ye”s chest!

Yang Ye’s figure curled forward, but his sword swept forward horizontally at the instant his figure was blasted away!

Hiss!

It sounded like something had been sliced open, and an afterimage flickered backward repeatedly.

But at this moment, Yang Ye was far away. As soon as he stopped himself, the mysterious expert stretched out his right hand and pressed it down.

Bang!

The space above Yang Ye collapsed and crashed down upon him.

In an instant, Yang Ye’s figure warped!

Meanwhile, Burial flashed out of the Sword Gourd.

Hiss!

The space around Yang Ye was sliced open.

The mysterious expert suddenly vanished, and he was in front of Yang Ye when he appeared again. Yang Ye took a small step back, and a pitch black palm arrived just around an inch before his stomach. If he’d been just a little slower, the palm would have struck him!

At the instant he took that step back, Yang Ye’s sword had descended simultaneously. However, a hand clamped down on the sword!

A moment later, the hand shook slightly.

Bang!

Yang Ye was pushed backward repeatedly!

The mysterious expert took a step forward and instantly arrived before Yang Ye. However, he was greeted by a sword to his head. However, this attack missed. Because the mysterious expert had retreated 300m back at the instant the sword descended!

His speed far surpassed Yang Ye!T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and then he looked up at the mysterious expert in the distance. Meanwhile, the latter suddenly turned ethereal.

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted, and then Burial suddenly appeared in his left grasp. After that, he swung both swords simultaneously!

But they still hit nothing but air!

At the instant they missed, the mysterious expert’s palm suddenly struck Yang Ye’s chest.

A ferocious expression arose on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth. At this moment, he activated the Sword Domain, and in this instant, he sensed the location of the mysterious expert’s main body!

And it was in this instant that Burial slashed forward!

Bang!

In the Sword Domain, a muffled explosion resounded, and then an afterimage flashed backward. But just a moment later, the afterimage suddenly vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye stabbed his sword toward the right.

An afterimage just happened to arrive there as if it was slamming itself against his sword!

Bam!

The afterimage was pushed back again, but it vanished right after. At the same time, Yang Ye swung his sword again!

Bam!

The afterimage was pushed back again.

Yang Ye looked up at the afterimage, and his sword was trembling.

He’d been at a disadvantage because he couldn’t grasp the movements of the mysterious expert, but after a few collisions, he’d gained a rough grasp of the mysterious expert’s strange movement technique.

The mysterious expert spoke softly, “As expected of the Ordinary Sword, you’re much stronger than before.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the space around Yang Ye suddenly started to crack open.

At this moment, Yang Ye was like a cracked mirror, and he’d cracked into countless pieces!

Space had cracked, and he was still there!

At this moment, Yang Ye’s expression changed.

It was because he’d noticed that his body was cracking into countless smaller pieces!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly. A moment later, the cracked space around him suddenly calmed down. Or to be more precise, he’d calmed down, but the space around him had cracked into countless fine pieces!

However, he was fine!

The Sword Domain!

It formed a world of its own!

He'd used the Sword Domain to escape the space under the mysterious expert’s control. So, even if that expanse of space cracked open, he was completely unharmed!

Besides that, he’d discovered something new!

Yang Ye looked up at the mysterious expert, “So that’s the secret behind your movement technique…”

He'd been suppressed by the mysterious expert’s speed mainly because they weren’t in the same expanse of space. The mysterious expert had been switching expanses of space to get so fast!

Now, he’d discovered it, and he could do the same with his Sword Domain!

The mysterious expert slowly crossed his arms before his chest, “The Ordinary Sword… To be honest, I knew you were an extraordinarily monstrous genius, but I never expected you to attain the Ordinary Sword in such a short amount of time. But it still doesn’t make a difference!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he was about to attack, but Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot.

The mysterious expert frowned and waved his right hand. The space there instantly started rippling, and then a sword pierced through space and arrived before his forehead.

Hiss!

This attack still missed!

However, the space around the mysterious expert warped strangely, and then Yang Ye’s sword stabbed into space.

Bang!

A moment of silence ensued, and then the space there exploded apart before two figures appeared here.

It was Yang Ye and the mysterious expert.

Yang Ye had accurately located the mysterious expert earlier. Now, he wasn’t in such a passive position anymore. He didn’t have to defend himself in order to attack anymore. He could go on the offensive now!

Bang!

Suddenly, an explosion resounded from nearby, and then countless rays of sword energy and black energy rippled out incessantly!

Yang Ye looked over, and he saw the woman in white and Monarch Yan in intense battle.

While the woman in white hadn’t gained the upper hand, she wasn’t at a disadvantage either!

However, as far as Yang Ye was concerned, it felt like both Monarch Yan and the mysterious expert still hadn’t revealed their true strength!

Their true objective, the one they truly feared and wanted to eliminate was actually the woman above the clouds!

Suddenly, Monarch Yan retreated and created distance between himself and the woman in white.

Monarch Yan gazed at the mysterious expert, “Kill him!”

The mysterious expert nodded.

Once they gave the order, all the Destiny Realm experts here attacked.

Their charge was led by Monarch Yan and the mysterious expert!

At this moment, their auras actually started rising rapidly, and it was more than just a few times stronger than before!

At this moment, even the woman in white’s face had turned solemn!

She suddenly appeared by Yang Ye’s side and grabbed his shoulder. At the same time, a white teleportation formation appeared below Yang Ye.

However, Yang Ye tapped his right foot down.

Bang!

The teleportation formation shattered!

She glanced at Yang Ye, and for the very first time, there was anger in them.

Yang Ye cracked a smile, “I don’t want anyone to sacrifice themselves for me again.”

How could he not know what she was planning? She planned to teleport himself away while staying behind!

She had no chance to win against their joint forces!

Of course, they had no chance even if he stayed!

But he still chose to stay!

She shook her head slightly, “Even if we escape today, I won’t survive. You don’t have to die here!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly. He was about to speak when she suddenly turned around and swung her sword.

Bang!

As soon as her sword descended, both Yang Ye and her were blasted away. Zuo Mu and the other Destiny Realm experts were behind them…

Yang Ye forcibly twisted his body and transformed into a ray of sword energy that charged at Zuo Mu and the others!

Meanwhile, the woman in white faced the mysterious expert and Monarch Yan.

Bang!

As soon as they collided, she was instantly blasted away. Her sword energy hadn’t even been fully released when it was suppressed and blasted into bits!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was suppressed as well!

He was facing dozens of Destiny Realm experts, and all of them were at the peak of the Destiny Realm!

However, while he was being suppressed, he didn’t fall to them. Conversely, he was growing increasingly ferocious.

Hiss!

A sword soundlessly flashed through the throat of a Destiny Realm expert. A moment later, Yang Ye appeared behind that expert. Meanwhile, a few dozen powerful waves of energy descended upon the area he was at!

Bang!

Yang Ye hurriedly released his sword intent, but it exploded apart in an instant.

Bang!

Yang Ye was pushed over 30km back.

As soon as he stopped himself, a few dozen experts appeared around him. Suddenly, the woman in white appeared in front of Yang Ye, and there was a pike in her stomach!

Yang Ye was stunned by the sight of this.

She glanced at Yang Ye and said, “There’s too many of them. Go to my other two forms.”

Boom!

As soon as she finished speaking, a strand of blood red flames suddenly appeared around her!

She’d ignited her soul!

At the same time, her blood, spirit energy, and Soul Energy were surging into Past Life.

She was sacrificing herself to her sword!
