Even though that voice from before had been changed, Supreme Exalt He was no ordinary expert! How could he possibly not discern it to be Yang Ye’s voice?

But when he looked over towards the source of the voice, that spot was completely empty.

Right when he was about to search carefully, the defiant profounders at the side had charged at him!

Defiant profounders surged incessantly into the city while more and more Half-Saints of the Hallowed Grounds rushed towards the city gates from all directions.

A shocking battle erupted within the Ancient City of Hallows!

Meanwhile, the person who started the entire battle, Yang Ye, was no long in that area. He’d gone to the Technique Pavilion within the city. He did want to continue gathering even more corpses, but Supreme Exalt He had noticed his presence. So, if he were to stay behind and continue gathering corpses, then he would definitely be dead if he was noticed.

As he gazed at the plaque that read ‘Technique Pavilion’, a smile appeared on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “Everything in there is mine now!”

As he spoke, Yang Ye swaggered into the Technique Pavilion.

There were 10 Saint Rank techniques within the Technique Pavilion, and he’d never forgotten about them. In fact, he’d wanted to obtain them for a very long time! Now that practically all the Half-Saints in the city had gone to the entrance of the city, didn’t it just happen to give him the best opportunity? So, how could he possibly let such an opportunity slip by?

Yang Ye didn’t stop at all and headed straight for the 3rd floor. Yang Ye gazed at the Dao Rank techniques here, and then he waved his right hand. Countless Dao Rank techniques were instantly placed within the Primordial Pagoda. After that, he ascended to the 4th floor. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Yang Ye laughed with ridicule as he gazed at the barrier of light that covered the jade counter. He flashed over to one of them, and then he stabbed his sword against it.

The barrier of light trembled violently while countless cracks appeared on it, and then it shattered apart.

Yang Ye frowned because there were only 3 black scrolls on the jade counter.

Did someone else take them? Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment before he waved his right hand and took the 3 scrolls. He naturally wouldn’t see what techniques they contained right now.

He flashed over to the 1st level, and he was just about to walk out the door when a voice resounded by his ears, “You’re Yang Ye, right? You really are an extraordinary genius in the Sword Dao. You blasted apart the Violetlight Barrier with just a single strike. You’re much stronger than many old fellows. No wonder the Hallowed Grounds suffered so many losses at your hands!”

Yang Ye’s heart shook, and he stopped moving before turning around to look towards the source of the voice. There was a sling chair made of bamboo at the nearby corner on the left, and an old man with slightly narrowed eyes laid on it. The old man’s hair was ruffled, his clothes ragged, and his face was covered in wrinkles and stubbles. He seemed very unkempt.

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze, and then he looked out the door and said, “I never expected that a supreme expert like you would actually be hiding in the Technique Pavilion.” He hadn’t noticed the old man when he entered, and he still hadn’t noticed the old man when he left. Obviously, the old man’s strength wasn’t inferior to Supreme Exalt He, and it might even be stronger than Supreme Exalt He. Because Yang Ye still didn’t sense a trace of danger coming from the old man even now.

That was the most terrifying part!

“A supreme expert? I’m just an old geezer who’s about to reach the end of his lifespan. I didn’t intent to call out to you, but I wasn’t able to stop myself in the end. It’s rare for a genius to appear on Profounder Continent, and it would truly be a pity if you were to die here. Based on how you acted earlier, you clearly aren’t satisfied with just 3 scrolls of techniques, and you intend to head to the Treasure Pavilion and Cultivation Technique Pavilion, right?” said the old man.

Yang Ye didn’t conceal his intentions and nodded. Because he really did intend to plunder the treasures of the Hallowed Grounds.

“Every single pavilion has a Pavilion Master. If you went to the other pavilions first, then I presume you would either be dead or fleeing for your life right now!” said the old man.

“Are they very strong?” asked Yang Ye.

The old man said, “Your strength improved at an extremely swift pace. You haven’t experienced the consolidation of your cultivation through time, nor have you tried to sense and comprehend the world, and you haven’t even comprehended your own Dao. Everything you’ve learnt are only things you gained from your predecessors. Even though that allows you to be extremely strong and even possess the ability to surmount your realm of cultivation to do battle, you’re still too weak when compared to some people. For example, I can defeat you with one move and kill you with the second. Do you believe that?”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “I don’t!”

“Why don’t you give it a try?”

Yang Ye replied, “Senior, what would you do if you can’t kill me with 2 moves?”

The old man flipped his right palm, and a fruit appeared in his palm. A refreshing fragrance instantly suffused the air when the fruit appeared here, and just the fragrance itself made Yang Ye’s entire body feel relaxed and refreshed.

The old man said, “This is the Saint Spirit Fruit that those fellows were fighting for. It’s yours if I can’t kill you with 2 moves. I won’t kill you if you can’t resist 2 moves of mine, but I just so happen to lack someone to pour my tea, and I feel that you’re very suitable for the job!”

“Can that fruit really help someone attain the Half-Saint Realm?” asked Yang Ye.

The old man answered, “It depends on the person!”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “I understand. Let’s do it!”

“Are you that confident?” asked the old man.

“I’m really very curious!” Yang Ye continued, “I’m curious how you will make me feel despair with just 2 moves!”

Meanwhile, the old man slowly opened his eyes. His gaze was calm, and it wasn’t sharp at all. He gazed at Yang Ye for a short while before he nodded, and then he slowly stretched his right hand forward and made a grasping motion towards Yang Ye. In an instant, the scene in the surroundings changed. Everything vanished, and only he and the old man remained.

Yang Ye’s expression changed, and it was unprecedentedly solemn. He gazed at the old man and said, “The might of a Domain!” At this moment, tempestuous waves were surging through his heart. It was the first time that he’d witnessed the might of another Domain besides his own Sword Domain!

At this moment, Yang Ye understood once more how there was always someone stronger and greater in the world!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to realize that something didn’t seem right. He couldn’t put a finger on it, but in any case, he felt that there was something wrong with this Domain. A moment later, Yang Ye realized what was wrong. This Domain wasn’t independent, and it had merged with the world and relied on the force of the world!

On the contrary, his Sword Domain was independent, and it didn’t rely on the force of the world!

“Looks like you’ve realized!” The old man suddenly said, “This isn’t a true Domain. It’s something I created myself. I call it a Pseudo Domain! Even though it isn’t a true Domain, it isn’t weak at all. My strength will rise five times while within its scope, whereas your strength will decline five times. Moreover, you’ll be suppressed as well!”

As soon as the old man finished speaking, Yang Ye suddenly felt a strand of powerful pressure descend upon him. It was like instantly feeling 10 mountains pressing down upon him, and it caused his internal organs to be on the verge of shattering!

A strand of sword intent surged out from within Yang Ye.

“2nd level Heaven Rank sword intent? Not bad. Unfortunately, it hasn’t broken through the shackles of the Heaven Dao while this Domain of mine is equivalent to the Heaven Dao of this world. So, your sword intent can’t destroy it!” said the old man.

Sure enough, Yang Ye felt that his sword intent was forcefully suppressed by a mysterious force upon leaving his body!

“We’ll consider this as your loss, alright?” asked the old man.

“You’ve really surprised me. However, you truly underestimate me if you think you can make me admit defeat just like that!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s body that had bent slightly under the pressure of that mysterious force gradually straightened. In the end, 2 rays of light surged from within his eyes before countless rays of light shot out from within him, and they surged around him....

Crack!

It sounded like glass had shattered, and then the surroundings returned to normal.

“The Sword Domain, that’s the Sword Domain?” The old man gazed at Yang Ye with a trace of fervor in his eyes.

Yang Ye nodded. Even though he’d shattered the old man’s ‘Domain’, he still felt admiration for the old man. Because he wouldn’t have been able to overcome it if he hadn’t grasped the Sword Domain. 2nd level Heaven Rank sword intent could suppress a Half-Saint, but his Heaven Rank sword intent was suppressed to the point it couldn’t even resist just now!

Since he comprehended sword intent, this was the first time he’d experienced something like that!

“The fake is fake in the end. Domains surpass the Heaven Dao and are independent above it. Yet mine contains the Heaven Dao and has fused with the world. Even though it’s still strong, its strength is limited.” The old man shook his head and seemed slightly flagging with interest, “I have one more move. Are you sure you want to receive it?”

“Of course!” replied Yang Ye.

The old man said, “I can discern that while you’ve grasped the Sword Domain, you haven’t fully grasped its strength. If my attack surpasses the scope of your Sword Domain’s ability, then you’ll suffer from backlash. You have around 10 years of life left, and your hair is completely white. I presume it’s because you forcefully utilized the Sword Domain, right?”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Indeed. However, I still want to try that move of yours!”

The old man nodded in response, “Since it’s like that, then let’s begin!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he pointed his finger at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye instantly felt a strand of mysterious energy lock onto him. It was very strong, and it was even stronger than the pressure he experienced from the old man’s Domain, causing him to even be unable to arouse the intention to resist. However, that wasn’t the end of it. He felt suffocated when it locked onto him, and it was like someone was squeezing down on his heart!

Yang Ye was horrified. What sort of force is this?Should I use the Sword Domain again?

However, he absolutely didn’t dare to do that. Because even if he could resist this attack by utilizing the Sword Domain, he would die right away. Because he didn’t have enough lifespan to do that!

How should I resist this move without the Sword Domain?

“This attack is called the Hellshackle Finger. It encloses the world in a cage, and it uses spiritual energy as a shackle. It’s something I created many years ago. I once utilized it to surmount my realm of cultivation and kill a high-grade Half-Saint that was Supreme Exalt He’s equal. At that time, I’d only just attained the Half-Saint Realm. Now, I only have to issue a command and you’ll be instantly crushed into bits. Of course, you can activate the Sword Domain as well!” said the old man.
