Chapter 2126 – The Universe Must Be Destroyed!

Snowy was in danger!

Ferocity instantly covered Yang Ye’s face as he entered the Primordial Pagoda.

At this moment, in the Primordial Pagoda.

There was a completely pitch black being not too far away from Snowy. It was completely pitch black, with just two small ears on its head, eyes that were like crescents but blood red crescents, and there was black energy coiled all around it.

Its size was around the same as Snowy!

At this moment, there was a small golden pagoda in front of Snowy.

The Primordial Pagoda.

That being had pounced at Snowy as soon as it charged into the Primordial Pagoda, but the Primordial Pagoda had pushed it away and saved Snowy.

Tian Xiu was beside Snowy, and she was holding Snowy in her arms while looking coldly at that being.

There was no fear in Snowy’s eyes now, only rage. Her paws were clenched tightly together, and the spirit energy around her had become unstable. She was like an undersea volcano that was about to erupt.

It was the first time she’d been bullied like this, and she couldn’t endure it!

The being gazed at Snowy with greed in its eyes, but it was quite afraid of the Primordial Pagoda before Snowy.

It has been at a disadvantage in the collision which occurred earlier!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye entered the Primordial Pagoda and went over to Snowy. Snowy immediately flew over to Yang Ye’s shoulder and pointed at the being.

Yang Ye asked, “You want to beat it up?”

Snowy nodded.

Yang Ye rubbed her head, “Then do it!”

Once she obtained Yang Ye’s permission, Snowy stopped hiding behind the Primordial Pagoda, and she just flew up into the air. A moment later, Snowy opened her mouth and inhaled. In an instant, the entire world turned ethereal.

What did Snowy rely on in battle? It was spirit energy, of course. The more spirit energy she took in, the stronger she would be. However, the Primordial Pagoda flew over to her and stopped her.

Because if Snowy continued, the spirit energy in this entire world would be gone.

In this world, the Primordial Pagoda was like the spirit of this world, so it naturally didn’t want the spirit energy here to vanish.

Snowy pointed at the being, and then she waved her little fists.

She was saying that she couldn’t let it go!

The Primordial Pagoda shook slightly.

Snowy blinked, pointed at the Primordial Pagoda, then pointed at the being.

The Primordial Pagoda shook slightly in response.

Actually, the Primordial Pagoda was telling her not to absorb the spirit energy here, and it would deal with the being. That being had suddenly entered the Primordial Pagoda, and that was a form of provocation to the Primordial Pagoda! So, Snowy wasn’t the only one, even the Primordial Pagoda couldn’t endure this!

Snowy hesitated for a moment, and then she patted the Primordial Pagoda. She was wishing it good luck.

The Primordial Pagoda shook slightly, and then it transformed into a ray of golden light that slammed against the being.

Viciousness flashed through the being’s eyes when it saw the Primordial Pagoda attack, and it raised its claw and slapped it forward.

Bang!

Just one claw had been enough to stop the Primordial Pagoda, and the space in the pagoda shook violently. Suddenly, countless rays of golden light surged out from the pagoda, and they blasted the being away. However, it only took a moment for the being to pounce at the pagoda again. At the same time, a huge pitch black claw slapped against the pagoda.

But it wasn’t able to slap the Primordial Pagoda away. As soon as the Primordial Pagoda was struck, a thick layer of golden light had appeared around it, and it was exactly that light which had resisted the powerful force of the being’s attack. However, the being suddenly grabbed the Primordial Pagoda, and it seemed like it wanted to tear the pagoda into two.

The Primordial Pagoda was no weakling, and it immediately slammed itself against the being.

Boom!

The being was blasted away, and a ray of golden light shot down from the sky and slammed against it.

Bang!

It was blasted away once more.

The being had been completely crushed in this collision!

However, the battle didn’t end there.

The being glanced at its body, and there was a horrifyingly ferocious expression on its face. It looked up at the pagoda, and then it slapped its right claw against its chest. In an instant, a terrifying wave of energy swept out from it. At the same time, its figure instantly expanded almost ten times in size, and there was a ball of red and black flames on its claws.

Danger!

Yang Ye’s expression changed. He sensed unprecedented danger from it!

Snowy shrunk back behind him too, and her eyes were filled with curiosity. What is that? It’s so powerful!

The Primordial Pagoda clearly felt threatened too. Countless rays of golden light immediately appeared around it. Suddenly, the being vanished on the spot.

The pagoda was about to attack, but it was stunned at this moment.

Because the being hadn’t charged at it, the being had charged at Snowy!

The pagoda transformed into a ray of golden light that shot at the being, but the being was much faster than the pagoda.

Yang Ye’s expression had changed drastically when he saw it charge at Snowy, and he instantly pulled Snowy behind him before grabbing Judgment with both hands and swinging it.

Boom!

A loud explosion resounded, and Yang Ye was blasted away. His attack had forced the being to a stop, but it didn’t make a difference because that’s all his attack had done.

At the instant Yang Ye was blasted away, the being appeared in front of Snowy, and then it clawed at Snowy while its eyes burned with desire.

“NO!” Yang Ye’s eyes were filled with rage, and he transformed into a ray of light that shot at it.

At this moment, there was no fear in Snowy’s eyes. She just gazed at Yang Ye and waved her little paw as if she was saying goodbye. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Right when the being’s claw was about to strike Snowy, a little girl appeared in front of Snowy.

The claw suddenly shot backwards when it was about to hit the little girl.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye and the pagoda had rushed over.

Yang Ye took Snowy in his arms. At this moment, he was shivering.

Regardless of what kind of expert he faces, and even if he faced a progenitor, Yang Ye had never felt fear. However, he was afraid this time. He was afraid of losing Snowy, he was afraid of the feeling of losing someone he loved!

He’d experienced it in the past, and he didn’t want to experience it again.

Snowy was much calmer. She just rubbed her head against Yang Ye’s face to console him.

Yang Ye gazed at the pagoda, “You take care of her, alright?”

The Primordial Pagoda didn’t answer him, but it floated over to Snowy’s head, and then a pillar of golden light enveloped Snowy. Yang Ye glanced at the pillar of light, and he knew that Snowy was quite safe unless a progenitor acted against her.

Only quite safe!

Yang Ye gazed at the being, and it was in confrontation with Tian Xiu.

Tian Xiu walked slowly in its direction. The viciousness in its eyes gradually vanished as it gazed at Tian Xiu. Yang Ye noticed that there was a trace of fear in its eyes!

It feared Tian Xiu!

Yang Ye gazed at Tian Xiu. What is her background? She can actually instill fear in it!

Tian Xiu was still walking in its direction. Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, but he didn’t choose to stop her in the end. Because his intuition told him that it wouldn’t dare to attack her.

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu suddenly clenched her fist, “Snowy is my friend. Snowy is my friend…”

Actually, she was very scared too, but her anger surpassed her fear.

Suddenly, Tian Xiu looked up at the being, and the latter’s eyelids twitched and moved 300m away from Tian Xiu.

Tian Xiu gazed coldly at it, and it was looking at her too. It just looked at her like that. In the end, it hesitated for a moment and left the Primordial Pagoda!

It had left!

Once it left, the Primordial Pagoda shook violently and transformed into countless rays of golden light that covered the sky. At the same time, faint golden light appeared around the tiny vortex within Yang Ye.

Obviously, the Primordial Pagoda had set up defenses. Now, the being couldn’t enter the pagoda with such ease. The pagoda hadn’t set up any defenses previously because it had been too confident in itself. Yet now, why it naturally didn’t fear that being, if that being focused on Snowy, then the pagoda could do nothing about it. So, the pagoda had chosen to set up defenses.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye walked over to Tian Xiu, rubbed her head, and asked, “Are you alright?”

She shook her head slightly, “I… I was so angry just now, and then I felt that something was about to awaken.”

“Something was about to awaken?” Yang Ye squatted down and spoke softly, “Do you know what it was?”

Tian Xiu shook her head, “I felt like it was about to awaken as soon as I got angry. However, Mother said that I can only truly get angry when I grow up. So, Mother didn’t let me get angry even when she died.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “It wanted to kill Snowy just now, and I was really… really so angry!”

Meanwhile, Snowy went over to Tian Xiu and rubbed her head while smiling. Obviously, she was consoling Tian Xiu.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Listen to your mother and don’t rashly get angry. Alright?”

Tian Xiu spoke softly, “Alright. I won’t get angry while Snowy and Big Brother are safe!”

Yang Ye nodded and smiled, “Alright, then it’s decided. Right, I have something to deal with, so I’ll play with you later, alright?”

Both the little fellows had no objections towards this.

Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda.

Meanwhile, Ding Shaoyao was standing in front of him.

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she fell silent for a short while before she said, “That was the Evil Yin Sprite. Its origins are unknown, and it’s fond of eating all Sprites. The Sprites of the entire large universe were almost completely annihilated when it appeared in the past. In the end, my god race helped to seal it in order to gain the support of the Universe Sprite. Now, we’ve unsealed it to deal with some people!”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “How do I kill it?”

She glanced at him and said, “You can’t. Patriarch Shi Tian tried to kill it too. The universe must be destroyed to kill it.”
