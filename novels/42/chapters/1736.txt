Chapter 1737 – Behind You!

Yang Ye was shocked. He hadn’t expected her to actually be aware that there was a treasure within him!

Yang Ye stared at her for a long time before he said, “How did you know?!”

She pointed at her eyes, “I saw it!”

Yang Ye asked, “How did you see it?!”

She replied, “I was born with unique eyes, and they’re able to see things that many aren’t able to. Your strength isn’t sufficient to kill him, but that treasure within you can. I can sense that it’s very strong, extremely strong!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t want to kill him! Get someone else to help you!”

She said, “Once he escapes from the seal, all of you will die.”

“Then I’ll run!” Yang Ye continued, “If I’m no match for him, can’t I just run?”

She looked him in the eyes, “If he escapes, many people in the outside world will die!”

Yang Ye replied, “I can’t do anything about that, and I don’t care about them. I just have to take care of myself and my own loved ones.”

What sort of existence was her father? An ancient cultivator! Someone from the same generation as the old man in Daoist’s robes. Even though her father wasn’t as strong as the old man in Daoist’s robes, he was absolutely not someone that Yang Ye could fight.

Most importantly, why should he kill her father?

To save the world?

Who cares?! He hadn’t forgotten how countless people throughout the world wanted his head!

So, such a noble deed like saving the world was better left to someone else!

She shook her head slightly, “You’re too cold blooded!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Miss, we have to act according to the limits of our ability. Your father’s strength definitely far surpasses my own. Tch! If I go to kill him, I’ll probably die trying. So, you should get some other capable person to do it!”

She nodded slightly, “I won’t force you! But… There are many treasures with my father. Don’t you want them?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I do. But my life is more important!”

She fell silent for a long time before she said, “How about you just help me do a little thing, and I’ll give you a treasure.”

Yang Ye asked, “What treasure?”

She flipped her right hand, and a blood red leather armor appeared, “It’s called the Blood Armor. If you wear it, it’ll merge into one with your blood. It can resist the attacks of 5th stage True Realm experts. You just have to do something small for me and it’s yours!”

It can stop the attacks of 5th stage True Realm experts!

Needless to say, Yang Ye was quite tempted, but he didn’t lose his composure.

Yang Ye asked, “What do you need my help with?”

“Go to Moment City with me!” She continued, “My father left something behind there. I intend to take it. Otherwise, if he escapes from the seal and obtains that thing, I’m afraid no one in this medium universe will be able to stop him!”

Yang Ye asked, “That’s all?”

She nodded, “That’s all!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Alright, I agree.”

She glanced at him and flicked the armor over to him.

Yang Ye was stunned and asked, “You’re giving it to me just like that? Aren’t you afraid that I’ll go back on my word?”

She replied, “I believe you’re not that kind of person!”

Yang Ye took the armor, hesitated for a moment, and replied, “Actually, I do that sometimes!”

Her eyelids twitched, but she remained silent.

Yang Ye asked, “How do I use it?”

She replied, “Drop a droplet of your blood on it!”

Yang Ye nodded and flicked a droplet of his blood on the armor. It didn’t take long for the armor to tremble, and then Yang Ye felt some sort of link had formed between them.

Yang Ye issued a command in his heart. The armor instantly entered his body, and then a faint layer of blood appeared all over his body.

Yang Ye touched it, and he noticed that it was very soft and smooth. Moreover, it felt very nice!

He gazed at Ku Zhuyi, “Strike me!”

Ku Zhuyi hesitated for a moment, and then she stabbed his chest with her sword.

Clang!

A clear and loud clang resounded, and then Ku Zhuyi was pushed over 10m backwards!

As for the armor on Yang Ye, there wasn’t a single scratch on it!

Nice! Yang Ye was delighted. Because he hadn’t felt any force when Ku Zhuyi stabbed him just now! It was like her sword hadn’t struck him!

Meanwhile, the woman in a red dress said, “It’s good, but it’s best if you don’t use it often!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

She explained, “If your opponent is too strong, and it’s unable to endure the force of the attack, then the force of the attack will damage your bloodline. Or to be more precise, it’ll damage the blood vessels throughout your body. If the force far surpasses the limits of the armor, it will shatter your blood vessels. Because the armor and your blood vessels are linked. I’m sure you’re very well aware what it means to have your blood vessels shattered!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’ll remember that!”

She nodded and said, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye asked, “Now?”

“Now!” She walked out of the hall once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye and Ku Zhuyi exchanged glances, fell silent for a moment, and then Yang Ye said, “Miss Ku, you should leave this place!”

“Leave?” Suddenly, the woman in a red dress said, “Forget it. She can’t!”

Yang Ye and Ku Zhuyi gazed at her, “Why?”

She spoke indifferently, “If it was possible to leave, those rotting corpses and blood corpses would have left. Do you think they want to stay in this huge cage? No! They want to leave more than anyone.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why can’t we leave?”

She explained, “Moment Mountain only allows entrance not departure. There are two formations here. One was set up by my father, and the other was casually set up by that old man in Daoist’s robes. Both of them were set up to prevent the rotting corpses and blood corpses here from leaving. If I’m to be honest, both of you wouldn’t be able to destroy those formations even if you’re at the 5th stage of the True Realm!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she didn’t speak another word and just quickly walked out of the hall.

Yang Ye and Ku Zhuyi’s faces turned gloomy after they heard her.

It was especially so for Yang Ye. He couldn’t stay here for long.

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time before he said, “Let’s go with her! Perhaps she knows how to leave!”

As soon as he finished speaking, both of them followed the woman out.

It didn’t take long for them to leave the city. There were some human corpses outside the city. These corpses belonged to the people who’d been following Ying Mu. However, Ying Mu’s corpse wasn’t amongst them.

The woman in a red dress said, “Walk, don’t fly!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She started walking towards the distance, “The rotting corpses will sense you if you use profound energy.”

Yang Ye asked, “They aren’t afraid of you?”

She glanced at him and continued forward, “Why would they fear me?”

Yang Ye replied with a question, “Why don’t those blood red figures harm you?”

She replied, “The Blood Corpses have a trace of intelligence left. They fear my father, so they dare not harm me. As for the Rotting Corpses, they are completely devoid of intelligence. In short, don’t use your profound energy. So long as there are no fluctuations of profound energy, they won’t sense your presence, and even if they do sense your presence, they won’t pursue you!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. If he knew this, he wouldn’t have fallen into such an embarrassing situation earlier.

Just like that, they started walking towards Moment City.

Needless to say, Yang Ye and Ku Zhuyi were quite fearful all along the way. Because there were truly too many Rotting Corpses all along the way.

If all the Rotting Corpses left this place, they would be a calamity for the medium universe of the Milky Way System. Unless the eight clans join forces, they wouldn’t be able to deal with those corpses at all. There were truly too many of them! Just looking at them caused a chill to run down one’s spine!

The woman in a red dress seemed very calm and composed, and it was like she didn’t notice the corpses at all.

Even though they were walking, all three of them weren’t ordinary people, so they were extremely fast.

At this moment, it was almost dawn, so the surroundings were pitch black. Yang Ye had the Laws of Darkness, so he didn’t fear the darkness. However, the darkness in the surroundings wasn’t very normal because his divine sense wasn’t able to stretch far.

Presently, his divine sense could only sense an area of 1.5km, and everything further was unknown to him.

“That’s Corpse Gas!” The woman in a red dress explained, “The surroundings are filled with such gas, and it’s able to obstruct the divine sense of humans. It’s really extraordinary for you to be able to sense an area of 1.5km. If you don’t believe me, ask the woman by your side. She may not even be able to sense an area of 30m.”

Yang Ye gazed at Ku Zhuyi, and the latter was looking at him. She said, “You can sense everything in an area of 1.5km?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Ku Zhuyi took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, “What a freak!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Yang Ye gazed at the woman in a red dress, “What about you? Are you a normal person, or a Blood Corpse?” Yang Ye had wanted to ask this question for a long time. Because he felt that she wasn’t very normal.

The woman stopped moving and gazed at Yang Ye, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t know.”

She withdrew her gaze and continued forward.

Yang Ye glanced at her, and then he followed her with Ku Zhuyi. Actually, he slightly regretted his decision to help her. At this moment, his intuition told him that he may have accepted quite a bit of trouble.

Suddenly, she stopped.

Ku Zhuyi asked, “What is it?”

The woman in a red dress glanced at the surroundings and spoke indifferently, “Something is following us!”

Ku Zhuyi’s expression changed, and she immediately became vigilant.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he gazed at the woman, “I don’t sense anything.”

The woman in a red dress looked Yang Ye in the eyes and said, “It’s behind you.”
