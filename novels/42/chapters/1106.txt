Chapter 1107 – Even An Emperor Can Dream Of Harming You While I’m Here!

Surprisingly, Xiao Yuxi didn’t stop him when she witnessed this scene. She didn’t remember much, but it was enough.

She could sense that Yang Ye was angry, extremely angry. As for the reason, it was her. At this moment, a strand of unusual emotions arose from the depths of her heart.

Ding Lin’s body was twitching incessantly while her face was warped to the limit, and her eyes were filled with terror. Because Yang Ye had stabbed her no less than 100 times now.

Every single stab sliced off a bit of her bones!

Such sharp pain was undoubtedly like hellish torture to someone who hadn’t purposely cultivated the body like her. She wanted to scream and howl, but she was helpless. Yang Ye’s Sword Domain and sword intent were suppressing her completely, and she couldn’t move a muscle.

Yang Ye’s sword was stabbing her incessantly, and it didn’t take long for her to be soaked in blood.

Yang Ye was naturally furious at her. Because if he was just a moment later, then Xiao Yuxi’s memories might have been completely erased by her. It was even to the extent that she might cripple Xiao Yuxi’s cultivation just to curry favor with that fellow, Mo Yuntian!

Besides that, when he thought about how she’d once controlled Xiao Yuxi by sealing Xiao Yuxi’s memories, he couldn’t restrain his desire to kill her!

Yang Ye finally stopped after 10 minutes had passed.

At this moment, Ding Lin was on the verge of death, and her eyes were filled with terror. Her current expression was no different than the one Lin Yueyin had revealed earlier. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Yang Ye said, “Now, you can undo the seal on Yuxi’s memories. Right, you wouldn’t play any tricks, right?”

Ding Lin shook her head hastily.

Yang Ye released her hands, but his sword was still pressed against her throat, “You can start now.”

Ding Lin’s hands trembled as she stretched them forward and placed them on Xiao Yuxi’s head. In next to no time, 2 strands of mysterious energy surged out from her palms and entered Xiao Yuxi’s mind. Xiao Yuxi instantly frowned, and pain was visible on her face.

Yang Ye’s expression changed. Meanwhile, Ding Lin hurriedly spoke, “It’s... it’s a normal reaction.”

Yang Ye’s sword that was against her throat had immediately moved back when he heard her, and it allowed her to heave a huge sigh of relief.

Time passed by slowly. It was torture for both Yang Ye and Ding Lin. Ding Lin was naturally afraid that a mishap would occur, and then she would lose her life here. As for Yang Ye, he was naturally worried that something would happen to Xiao Yuxi. After all, he absolutely wouldn’t allow anything to happen to her.

After around 15 minutes passed, Ding Lin withdrew her hands. Yang Ye noticed Ding Lin heave a sigh of relief, and it allowed him to relax a little as well.

A while passed, and then Ding Lin and Yang Ye watched with anxiety as Xiao Yuxi opened her eyes slowly. After that, she gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye immediately revealed a smile because her gaze wasn’t unfamiliar to him anymore.

“You’re finally here!” Xiao Yuxi gazed at Yang Ye as she spoke with a calm voice, but tears were seeping out of her eyes.

When she was separated from Yang Ye that day, it was when Profounder Continent was on the verge of destruction. So, she’d been constantly worried about Yang Ye once she left and before her memories had been sealed. Now, when she saw that Yang Ye was alive, what she felt was simply indescribable with words.

Yang Ye grinned, “You’ve finally truly remembered me!”

Xiao Yuxi spoke softly, “I never forgot you!”

“Let’s go!” Yang Ye was about to end Ding Lin’s life as he spoke, but Xiao Yuxi suddenly said, “You can’t kill her!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Xiao Yuxi replied, “As a Saint, she has a Soul Tablet in the sect. If she dies, her Soul Tablet will definitely shatter. At that time, we’ll be exposed.”

“A Soul Tablet!” Yang Ye’s expression changed, “Shit! We’ve probably been exposed already!”

Xiao Yuxi asked, “Why?”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “I killed Lin Yueyin. If I’m not wrong, then the Thousand Crane Sect might be looking for me.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s expression changed once more because he sensed a few strands of divine sense sweeping towards them.

Yang Ye continued to use the Sword Domain to conceal their auras, and it didn’t take long for those divine senses to leave them. Yang Ye heaved a slight sigh of relief.

Suddenly, one of them suddenly came back, and then stopped at their position. Yang Ye’s eyes instantly narrowed slightly. He knew that they’d been found!

Bang!

A huge explosion resounded from outside the palace.

Xiao Yuxi spoke solemnly, “The formation has been activated!”

“Are you going to come out yourself, or should I bring you out myself?” A dignified female voice resounded from outside.

A Quasi Emperor! Yang Ye dispersed the Sword Domain, and then he waved his right hand. 10 Saint Realm Sword Servants appeared around Xiao Yuxi. These Saint Realm Sword Servants were those 10 Saints from the Law Faction who’d fought him and An Nanjing that day. He hadn’t destroyed their bodies after killing them that day, and he’d preserved their corpses.

Even though they were only Saints, even ordinary high-rank Saints were no match for their joint forces. Of course, it was definitely useless before the Thousand Crane Sect. Because there were at least 2 Quasi Emperors out there. However, it was better than nothing. After all, besides Quasi Emperors, ordinary high-rank Saints wouldn’t be able to overcome them with ease.

Yang Ye ordered one of the Sword Servants to restrain Ding Lin, and then he gazed at Xiao Yuxi, “Are you afraid?”

Xiao Yuxi shook her head slightly.

Yang Ye stretched out his hand, and she immediately took his hand. Yang Ye roared with laughter. Just like that, they walked out of the palace.

Thousands of disciples from the Thousand Crane Sect were gathered outside the palace. There were over 100 high-rank Saints amongst them, and the weakest amongst the rest were Half-Saints.

Xiao Yuxi said, “Inner court disciples and the Enforcement Teams!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, and then his gaze shot towards the woman in a green dress who led the group. She was only a mid-rank Saint, but her aura was even stronger than the other high-rank Saints. Meanwhile, Xiao Yuxi’s gaze had descended on her as well, and Xiao Yuxi said, “Hua Mujin, one of the most outstanding disciples in the current younger generation of the Thousand Crane Sect. She’s ranked at the 2nd position amongst the younger generation of the sect. She and Mu Liufeng who’s ranked at the 1st position have the best chance to ascend the Martial Rankings throughout Thousand Crane Sect.”

Hua Mujin’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye, and she asked, “You killed Elder Lin Yueyin?”

Yang Ye replied, “Would you believe me if I said that I didn’t?”

Hua Mujin glanced at Yang Ye, and then her gaze descended onto Ding Lin. Her face instantly turned gloomy when she saw the injuries on Ding Lin’s body. In the end, she gazed at Yang Ye again and said, “Who are you? Why have you snuck into my Thousand Crane Sect and killed an elder of my sect?”

Yang Ye replied, “Xiao Yuxi is my wife. I came to the Thousand Crane Sect for her.”

“What nonsense!” Meanwhile, a voice resounded in the sky, “Yuxi will be marrying Young Master Mo Yuntian tomorrow. How could she possibly be your wife!”

“I am his wife!” Suddenly, Xiao Yuxi stepped forward and said, “Both of us are from the lower dimensions, and we were married there. Sect Master, Yuxi is thankful for the care that the Thousand Crane Sect has provided me, but now that I’ve recovered my memories, I hope that the Thousand Crane Sect will allow me and my husband to leave. Thank you!”

Clamorous noise resounded throughout the surroundings when they heard her. Many female disciples exchanged glances as they hadn’t expected that Xiao Yuxi was already married.

After all, she was going to get married to Mo Yuntian tomorrow. If Mo Yuntian found out about it, then it would be equivalent to the Thousand Crane Sect slapping Mo Yuntian and the Mo Clan on the face.

The voice resounded once more, “Yuxi, do you realize what you’re saying!”

Xiao Yuxi spoke in a low voice, “Of course!”

The voice said, “Young Master Mo will be coming to take you tomorrow. It’s related to the future of my Thousand Crane Sect, so nothing can go wrong in this matter. Understand?”

Xiao Yuxi’s face fell when she heard this. Meanwhile, Yang Ye chuckled. He pulled Xiao Yuxi behind him, and then he looked up into the sky, “A Diamond Tank power actually has to rely on giving their disciples away to have a future. How laughable! Fine, doing that has nothing to do with me. However, your sect actually intends to give my wife to someone else, and then get that so-called future in exchange. Aren’t you going a little too far?”

“We’re going too far?” The voice said, “Since she’s a disciple of my Thousand Crane Sect, then my sect has the authority to make arrangements for her future. Besides that, she has the duty to sacrifice herself for the sect. As a disciple of a sect, one should always prioritize the interests of the sect. Moreover, if she’s married to Mo Yuntian, then Mo Yuntian won’t treat her unfairly. No matter how bad it is, it would be better than being with a Half-Saint like you, right?”

The voice paused for a moment and continued, “Yuxi, the reason I’ve wasted my breath on you is because I want you to realize that my Thousand Crane Sect doesn’t have a choice, and you don’t have a choice. If you agree to marry Mo Yuntian, then I can let this fellow live, and I can even allow your memories to stay intact. Otherwise, I’ll kill him and erase your memories!”

Xiao Yuxi paid no attention to the owner of the voice, and she just gazed at Yang Ye and said, “I’ll do as you say!”

Yang Ye grinned, and then he looked up into the sky, “Let us leave!”

The voice replied, “If you have the ability, you can try and leave yourself!”

Bang!

A pillar of blood shot up into the sky, and the entire sky above Thousand Crane Sect was instantly turned blood red. The bloody aura and evil energy within it caused the expressions of the disciples in front of Yang Ye to change drastically. All of them couldn’t help but move back quickly, and some of them who’d retreated a little too late were instantly corrupted by the intent to kill with the aura, causing them to become machines of slaughter.

A blood red sword appeared in Yang Ye’s grasp. Yang Ye held Xiao Yuxi’s hand with his left hand and said, “Even an Emperor can dream of harming you while I’m here! Let’s go!”
