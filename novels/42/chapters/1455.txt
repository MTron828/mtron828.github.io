Chapter 1456 – Specialized In Dealing With Those That Refuse To Submit!

The middle aged man had vanished into thin air, and it was like he’d never been there.

He’d naturally hadn’t vanished for no reason. Obviously, the mysterious woman had obliterated him.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, fell silent for a long time, and then said, “You’ve been following me all the way here. If you need something, then tell me about it, alright? As I’ve said before this, I will definitely not refuse if it’s within my ability.”

He received no response!

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Just following me won’t change anything.”

He still received no reply!

“Forget it.” Yang Ye shook his head and disregarded the mysterious woman. He didn’t have time to waste on her. He believed that since she was following him, then she would show herself, sooner or later.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he waved his hands and stored away all the skeletons which covered the ground.

Yang Ye would naturally not refuse the middle aged man’s request. In any case, it was a small matter to him. Moreover, the middle aged man had even compensated him.

The compensation!

Yang Ye immediately flipped his palm when he thought of it, and the scroll which the middle aged man gave him appeared in his grasp. After that, he exerted a little strength and crushed the scroll, causing it to transform into a ray of dark light that entered the center of his forehead. It didn’t take long for some information to appear in his mind.

“Elemental Breaker. The body is the source of strength. It’s like a universe that’s without borders. If one is capable of unearthing 30% of that in their entire lives, even the world can be destroyed with a flick of the finger. If one is capable of unearthing 50%, the world can be transcended to live eternally with the stellar bodies in space. As for those capable of unearthing 100%....”

Yang Ye shook his head. He wasn’t interested in reading through all of that, so he skipped straight to the end.

“Elemental Breaker. It disregards all defenses. The body is used as a medium to absorb the energy of the five elements before converging it in the fist. All defenses are disregarded, and it strikes straight at the internal organs....”

Yang Ye’s face became solemn when he read up to this point.

It was quite insane since it could disregard defenses. At the very least, he really feared such an ability. After all, he usually relied on his physical defenses, but if his enemy executed Elemental Breaker upon him, then it represented that his physical defenses would be completely useless. It wouldn’t be such a huge problem if he was mentally prepared and didn’t go head on against his enemy’s fist. However, if he wasn’t prepared and was taken by surprise....

He would be killed in an instant!

However, Yang Ye was doubtful about its ability to disregard defenses. After all, nothing was absolute in the world. If Elemental Breaker really could disregard all defenses, then it was absolutely matchless.

But if it was matchless, then the middle aged man wouldn’t have died.

Unfortunately, the scroll didn’t state the grade of the technique. However, as far as Yang Ye was concerned, it was definitely not ordinary. As for its might, he had to cultivate it successfully and try it on someone or some demon beast.

The dragon seal! Yang Ye suddenly thought of the dragon seal. Because the middle aged man had said that the dragon seal had another technique, the Undying Elemental Body!

The Undying Elemental Body and the Elemental Breaker!

Yang Ye closed his eyes. The dragon seal was within his sea of consciousness. However, it kept a very low profile and merely resided at a corner. Perhaps it was because of the Primordial Pagoda. Actually, since he had the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye was invulnerable to all evil. No matter what sort of strange thing or soul it was, they would have to kneel if they entered his body!

Yang Ye’s consciousness entered the dragon seal. It didn’t take long for it to start trembling slightly, and then some information appeared in Yang Ye’s mind.

“The Undying Elemental Body. Created from the Elemental Breaker, it’s much greater than the Elemental Breaker. The body is used as the medium to absorb the energy of the five elements into the body, allowing the body to possess the energy of the five elements. The energy of the five elements circulated incessantly, and the body remains eternal....”

A body cultivation technique! Yang Ye was delighted. He needed a body cultivation technique the most. His body was formidable, but it had a flaw, and it was that he didn’t possess a good cultivation technique and a step by step process of advancement. His body’s improvement had been done forcefully by relying on external sources of stimulation. Simply speaking, he’d gone to extremes.

It was alright to do that in the beginning, but he couldn’t do it forever.

Fortunately, he had the Undying Elemental Body technique now, so he didn’t have to use such methods anymore. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

He’d gained tremendous gains!

A smile curled up on the corners of his mouth. Now, he understood why many still came here when they knew how dangerous it was. Danger and fortune coexisted here. Just like this very moment, he’d obtained a fortune. But he knew that if someone else arrived here, that person would definitely obtain the same thing. Because the middle aged man had no other choice!

In short, this place was very dangerous, but it was filled with fortune, and it all depended on one’s own strength and luck.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, glanced at the surroundings, and then immersed his mind into his body. His clone arrived before the Ancient Emperor Python. At this moment, it had curled up into a ball, and it seemed absolutely pitiable.

However, it was unyielding and refused to beg for mercy. But the Primordial Pagoda was worse. Since it refused to surrender, the Primordial Pagoda was willing to continue playing with it. In any case, it was impossible for the python to die while it was within the Primordial Pagoda. It would heal the python after it was beaten up, and then it would continue beating up the python.

Yang Ye gazed at the python for a long time, and then he turned around and vanished on the spot.

If it wanted to be unyielding, that was fine. The Primordial Pagoda could accompany it all along the way!

It specialized in dealing with those that refused to submit!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye opened his eyes in the outside world. He was about to continue forward when he seemed to have thought of something. He suddenly turned around, and the space before him was completely empty.

At this moment, Yang Ye really wanted to activate the Sword Domain right away to see if someone was standing in front of him and looking at him.

However, after thinking about it for a while, he decided against it.

Since she refused to show herself, and he forced her to reveal herself before him, then it might cause the situation to grow worse. In the end, it was best to wait and see until she made a move.

Yang Ye turned around and vanished into the miasma.

The path ahead was filled with unknown dangers, but he still had to go forward.

All along the way, Yang Ye noticed even more skeletons. They belonged to humans and the demon beasts which he’d previously. Yang Ye observed them closely and noticed that these skeletons were probably from the same group as the middle aged man from before. At this moment, Yang Ye came to a slight understanding. The middle aged man’s group had probably encountered formidable demon beasts even deeper within the Ominous Territory, and they’d fled all the way here. However, they hadn’t been able to escape the demon beasts’ pursuit in the end.

However, the middle aged man’s group was clearly extremely strong. Even though they perished, they’d still killed some demon beasts.

They’d perished along with their enemies!

As far as Yang Ye was concerned, it was good news. Because it represented that there was no danger in this area. Because these demon beasts came from even deeper in the Ominous Territory, and they might have even come from Yellow Springs River. After all, the middle aged man was a peerless expert. Based on the middle aged man’s strength, it wouldn’t be a problem for him to get to the Yellow Springs River.

Even then, he still couldn’t be careless. He didn’t possess their strength, so even if he wasn’t going past Yellow Springs River, it was still extremely dangerous for him.

Once he left this time, Yang Ye had decided to work hard and cultivate like a madman!

It was really quite aggrieving to not possess formidable strength. Presently, he seemed like he was treading on thin ice, and he was careful at all times because he was afraid that a demon beast or some other terrifying thing would suddenly appear before him.

Four hours later, the sky had turned dark, and the miasma grew thicker.

Yang Ye didn’t stop, but he’d slowed down slightly.

Suddenly, he frowned because the surroundings were getting colder. Yang Ye stopped and looked up towards the distance. He was just about to blast the miasma apart when the miasma ahead suddenly parted on its own, and then a gust of cold wind swept towards him. Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly at the sight of this. He twisted his right palm slightly, and a wave of aura surged forward and blocked the cold wind.

Yang Ye became vigilant. However, he was quite surprised to notice no further movement after the cold wind vanished.

He remained silent for a while, and then continued forward. As he went further, it grew colder and colder. In the end, even he had no choice but to utilize slaughter intent and sword intent to protect himself from the cold.

Crack!

A clear and resounding crack suddenly came from beneath his feet. Yang Ye looked down and saw that he was walking on ice.

He glanced at the surroundings before stretching his right hand forward, and then he shook it lightly. In an instant, the miasma around him was pushed away, and then he saw his surroundings clearly.

A mountain covered in ice.

A mountain covered in ice was in front of him. He didn’t know how huge it was, and he could only see a part of it.

What the heck is this place? Yang Ye remained silent for a while, and then he continued forward. He walked forward for a while before he noticed that there was no path forward.

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to soar up into the air. Since there was no path forward, he intended to fly over. He flew for almost two hours before he finally arrived at its peak!

Yang Ye was stunned when he arrived at the peak. Because he noticed that there was actually no miasma here, and his vision was completely clear.

He looked down and noticed that the miasma wasn’t able to rise further when it almost arrived at the top of the mountain. It seemed like some sort of mysterious energy was obstructing the miasma.

It was quite strange!

Yang Ye’s profound energy started to circulate while he became even more vigilant.

Yang Ye continued forward. He walked for around an hour before he suddenly stopped. There was a platform carved out of ice standing in front of him, and an ice casket that was crystalline like snow was floating above the platform.

A casket? Yang Ye was stunned.
