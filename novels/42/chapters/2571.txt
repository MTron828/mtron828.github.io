Chapter 2572

An ethereal figure appeared in the air above the Ancient Sword Sect.

It was translucent and blurry, utterly impossible to discern properly, and by the side of it was a black awl.

The Soul Sect’s Master!

The statue gazed at the Soul Sect’s Master and scanned him before nodding slightly, “One with the Soul Domain to go beyond Three Dimensional Space. Interesting!”

The Soul Sect’s Master said, “I never expected such a soul to still exist in the Ancient Sword Sect. Devouring you would be better than a hundred years of bitter cultivation for me!”

“Devour me?” The statue shook his head and smiled, “Interesting indeed.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand, and a sword shot up into the air.

Fast!

That was the first impression it gave Yang Ye, and the second was how strong it was!

The sword carried incomparably powerful energy.

He sensed many different things in the sword, but they were all as one. It was very strange!

Meanwhile, the Soul Awl suddenly vanished on the spot.

Hiss!

Along with an ear piercing sound of something being pierced open, the flying sword exploded apart in midair, and the Soul Awl emanated a wave of Soul Energy as it shot down.

It was shooting straight at the statue!

The statue remained clam as he flicked his finger lightly.

A sword howl resounded, and then a flying sword shot up into the air! However, that wasn’t the end of it. At the same time, countless other flying swords shot up into the air from down below!

Sword after sword!

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Explosions resounded, and the Soul Awl was pushed back repeatedly. In the end, it was blasted all the way back to the Soul Sect’s Master.

Meanwhile, the Soul Master pressed his right hand down slightly, and a wave of powerful Soul Energy rippled out, causing the sword energy to be instantly obliterated and vanish!

In the Primordial Pagoda, Qi Bitian shook her head slightly, “It’s not his main body, and he died too, too long ago. Sigh…”

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Once the Soul Master obliterated the sword energy, the Soul Awl shot down from above!

The Soul Awl grew in size and power as it descended!

At this moment, everyone didn’t doubt that if the Soul Awl descended to the ground, the entire sect would be obliterated!

Completely and utterly obliterated!

At this moment, the strength of that Super Divine Treasure was fully revealed!

It was truly capable of obliterating everything!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye flicked Executor over to the statue.

The statue glanced at Yang Ye and didn’t refuse it. He would naturally not be stubborn at a time like this. After all, he wasn’t his main body!

The statue waved his hand and Executor entered his grasp. He glanced at it, grinned slightly, and said, “A pretty good sword!”

He stabbed it upward into the sky.

Hiss!

Executor shot into the sky!

It seemed capable of piercing the sky as it shot upward! At the same time, a wave of powerful sword intent and sword energy rippled out and slammed against the Soul Awl.

Rumble!

Rumbling resounded throughout the sky above the sect.

It was a collision between two Super Divine Treasures!

Suddenly, the statue shot up into the air, and a wave of powerful sword intent and sword energy filled the surroundings. At this moment, the entire world seemed to be filled by the statue’s sword intent and sword energy!

The experts from the Soul Sect and all the other powers had retreated from the Ancient Sword Sect as they were worried about suffering injuries from the battle between these two experts!

After all, it was a battle between two old geezers, and ordinary people couldn’t get mixed up in it at all!

The entire sky was filled with sword intent and sword energy, and the Soul Awl frequently shot through this expanse of sword energy and sword intent.

Yang Ye moved his gaze away and looked to the side. The Abyss Lion and the Primal True Dragon were still in battle.

However, in order to avoid the battle between the Soul Master and the statue, they’d moved far away into a distant part of space.

Yang Ye’s face turned gloomy when he saw the situation in the battle.

The Primal True Dragon was being completely suppressed!

Yang Ye was about to attack when Qi Bitian’s voice suddenly resounded in his mind, “Ignore him!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Huh?”

Qi Bitian replied indifferently, “It’s his natural enemy, and he must overcome it himself. Otherwise, the Abyss Lions will still be the nightmare of the dragons. But once he overcomes his own natural enemy, he will gain benefits beyond his expectations!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “He’s been with Erya for so long but has never overcome her. So…”

“Fool!” Qi Bitian’s voice suddenly grew louder, “Erya isn’t like that fellow. Erya isn’t his natural enemy, so it isn’t fear but reverence that he feels toward her. It’s different, understand?”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Meanwhile, Qi Bitian said, “He’s at the Five World Realm now. If he succeeds at overcoming the fear in his blood, then attaining the Lord Realm won’t be an issue at all. If you help him now, he will never be able to overcome it, and that will bring harm to him instead. Understand?”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and nodded. While he agreed to refrain from helping, he would still do it if the dragon’s life was in danger!

Everything is only possible while one is alive! There would be nothing left once life was lost!

Meanwhile, the woman in a black dress from the Soul Sect and Nether Maiden were still in battle!

Their battle was extremely strange because both of them possessed very strange and unique abilities. They were truly elusive.

Yang Ye was very confident in Nether Maiden because he’d known her since Profounder Continent! Her combat instinct and attainments in every other aspect were extremely good. So, while it wasn’t impossible for the woman with the Space Domain to kill Nether Maiden in a one on one battle, it was very difficult. However, it was quite difficult for Nether Maiden to kill her too!

They were equally matched!

Meanwhile, Qi Bitian suddenly said, “You should worry about yourself!”

Yang Ye asked, “What do you mean?”

Qi Bitian replied, “Their battle may be about to come to its end.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “He’s no match for the Soul Master?”

“What do you think?” Qi Bitian continued, “He’s a dead man, so how can he defeat someone who’s still alive? Moreover, that fellow isn’t very weak either. You’re probably dead once he loses. Anyway, if you flee now, you have a very good chance of escaping death.”

Flee?

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “If I flee, what will the others do?”

She replied, “You can avenge them, right?”

Yang Ye shook his head again, “If they are already dead, vengeance won’t change anything, right?”

He looked up at the sky as he spoke. It was filled with sword intent and sword energy.

It was the first time Yang Ye had seen so much sword energy and sword intent, and they were even so strong!

It was obvious how terrifying the statue was in his peak!

Yet now, he was about to lose!

Bang!

Suddenly, a rumbling explosion resounded, and then the sword intent and sword energy in the sky gradually vanished. In just a short while, all of it dispersed completely!

Executor flew back to Yang Ye! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect had gloomy expressions on their faces when they witnessed this!

Even the mysterious expert of the Ancient Sword Sect lost?

Everyone watched as the statue returned to where it had been previously, and it was covered in cracks.

Yang Ye’s face turned gloomy from the sight of this!

The status shot a glance into the sky. At this moment, the Soul Awl was still there, and so was the Soul Master.

The statue shook his head and smiled. He didn’t say anything. He wasn’t someone from this era, so he really couldn’t do anything to change the fact that he was bound to lose to the Soul Master!

If he was alive, if he had his sword from all those years ago, if… Unfortunately, he was dead, and his sword was obliterated as well!

There were no “ifs”!

The statue restrained his thoughts and gazed at Yang Ye, “As the current Sect Master, you’re a little too weak. Of course, there isn’t anyone in the sect who’s stronger than you. I never expected my sect to decline to such an extent.”

Yang Ye was really displeased because the statue seemed like he was blaming Yang Ye for the sect’s decline!

The statue shot another glance at Yang Ye’s stomach. Actually, he was looking at the Primordial Pagoda, but he seemed to be afraid of something and quickly withdrew his gaze. He looked at Yang Ye again and said, “You may be a little weak, but as the sect master, you didn’t bring shame to the sect or the pride of a sword cultivator. I can’t do much for you. No matter what happens to the sect in the future, I hope all of you never bring shame to your swords, and never bring shame to the word “sword” in the sect’s name.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he looked up at the sky, “Thousands of years of cultivating, and for what? It all came to nothing! Destiny plays tricks on us all!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the statue started to crack apart, and then a strand of sword energy swept out from it.

The Soul Master suddenly said, “Retreat!”

He paused for a moment and added, “Immediately!”

As soon as he finished speaking, countless strands of sword intent and sword energy swept out from the statue like a tidal wave, and they shot toward the surroundings. Moreover, a ray of powerful sword energy shot directly at the Soul Master.

The sword energy and sword intent were very strange because they didn’t harm the disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect when passing through them. However, when they touched the experts of the other powers, all who were struck by them were instantly obliterated!

Endless sword intent and sword energy swept through the area. At this moment, the entire Ancient Sword Sect was covered in sword energy and sword intent, and the experts from the other forces were being forced back incessantly.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Qi Bitian strolled back to her bamboo house and looked up at the sky, “Thousands of years of cultivation? That’s nothing.”

As she spoke, she gazed at Lei Lin and said, “During my time, there was a tragedy. When you went through countless trials and tribulations to get in front of that door, and you just happen to be able to push it open, you realize… there’s another door behind it!”

Lei Lin blinked, and then she raised two fingers, “There are two doors?”
