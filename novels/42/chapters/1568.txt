Chapter 1569 - Even The Continent Might Be Blasted Apart!

Translator: InVader

As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, a middle aged man in a black robe appeared not too far in front of Yang Ye. There were 13 other old men behind the middle aged man, and all of them were Rebirth Realm experts.

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he said, “You’re Yang Ye!”

The expressions of the others changed when they heard this.

Yang Ye!

Everyone throughout the continent knew that name! After all, it belonged to an extraordinary expert who’d almost annihilated the Divine Phoenix Clan!

Meanwhile, the woman with blue hair was standing at the entrance of the Guest Hall now, and she sized up Yang Ye before speaking softly, “So he’s Yang Ye… No wonder…”

Yang Ye gazed at the middle aged man and asked, “Who are you?”

The middle aged man replied, “Ke Wuming. I’m the current emperor of Devil Crest Empire.”

“I’m looking for Ke Ni.” Yang Ye continued, “Tell him to come here.”

Ke Wuming spoke in a low voice, “May I know how my son offended you and made you come all the way to my empire?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “He hasn’t offended me. I just want to talk with him about something.”

“You want to talk about something?” The corners of Ke Wuming’s eyes twitched slightly, “Is this how you talk about things?”

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and he put the Stellar Sword Diagram away. It didn’t take long for the surroundings to return to normal. The others visibly relaxed at the sight of this.

The Stellar Sword Diagram!

They had to fear it!

If Yang Ye used the Stellar Sword Diagram here, it was obvious that the entire city would vanish. If Yang Ye released that mysterious flame, then not to mention the city, even they would vanish!

Yang Ye said, “I apologize for my rashness. Senior Ke, please allow me to meet your crown prince. I have something to talk to him about.”

A smile curled up on the woman’s mouth when she heard Yang Ye, “What an intelligent fellow.” She naturally knew what Yang Ye’s intentions were. Yang Ye had immediately activated the Stellar Sword Diagram so that he would have the right to speak. If he didn’t do that, then would the devil race pay any attention to him?

Simply speaking, Yang Ye made a show of strength before trying to engage in negotiations!

Ke Wuming glanced at Yang Ye, and then he waved his right hand. It didn’t take long for the space in front of him to tremble, and then a young man appeared in front of him.

The young man was Ke Ni, of course. Ke Ni gazed at Yang Ye and said, “May I know why you’re looking for me.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly and said, “You captured the princess of the Divine Phoenix Clan, Mo Xiaoleng, right?”

Ke Ni’s expression changed slightly, “You’re here because of her?”

Yang Ye replied, “I’m not here for her. You obtained the consciousness of a being from her, right?”

Ke Ni nodded.

Yang Ye clenched his fists slowly, “That consciousness belongs to a friend of mine. Give her back to me, alright?”

Ke Ni glanced at Yang Ye, and then he turned to look at Ke Wuming. Ke Wuming spoke gloomily, “Give it back to him!”

Yang Ye had instantly activated the Stellar Sword Diagram upon arriving here. Needless to say, it was quite a threat. So, the Devil Crest Empire would lose face a little by returning Yang Ye’s friend’s consciousness. However, what was face worth? Yang Ye wasn’t really normal, and he’d even dared to annihilate the Divine Phoenix Clan, so would he fear the Devil Crest Empire?

Ke Wuming didn’t doubt that Yang Ye would fight them to the death if he dared to refuse!

It was best not to offend someone like Yang Ye.

Ke Ni nodded when he heard Ku Wuming, and then he flipped his palm. A white jade box appeared in his grasp before he flicked it over to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s hands started to tremble as he gazed at the box. Quite some time passed before he opened it slowly, and within it was a white ball of light which seemed like mist.

Yang Ye asked in his heart, “Little Sky, is this it?”

“Yes!” Little Sky said, “Luckily, her consciousness isn’t damaged. Send it in here, I’ll help her merge back into her body.”

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief, and he hurriedly sent the box into the Primordial Pagoda. After that, he looked up at Ke Ni, “Thank you.”

After that, he looked at Ke Wuming, “Forgive me for my offense just now. Farewell.”

Ke Wuming suddenly spoke, “Wait!”

Yang Ye turned to look at Ke Wuming. The latter fell silent for a short while, and then she said, “Can we have a talk? It’s related to you, and it should be helpful to you.”

Related to me? Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded.

In the Guest Hall, there were only three people here. Ke Wuming, Yang Ye, and the woman with blue hair.

Ke Wuming introduced, “She’s the patriarch of the oceanic race, Hai Lanxin.”

The patriarch of the oceanic race!

Yang Ye glanced at her. He hadn’t expected her to be the patriarch of the oceanic race. The oceanic race wasn't any weaker to the demon race and human race! Most importantly, it was a united force. However, while it was a united force, it wasn’t a very huge threat to the other races. The main reason was that their strength would decline tremendously if they weren’t in water!

Hai Lanxin gazed at Yang Ye and grinned, “I’ve heard great things about you!”

Even though Yang Ye was just a Deity, would anyone on the continent dare to treat him as just a Deity? Presently, Yang Ye himself was equivalent to an eight star power! No, he was even more terrifying than an eight star power.

Yang Ye said, “You’re too kind.”

He gazed at Ke Wuming and continued, “May I know what you want to speak about?”

Ke Wuming and Hai Lanxin exchanged glances. In the end, Ke Wuming spoke in a low voice, “My devil race and the oceanic race obtained some information related to you. Do you know that a mysterious power is targeting you?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I know a little.”

Ke Wuming asked, “Do you know who it is?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “No. Why? Why are both of you so concerned about that?”

Ke Wuming shook his head, “That power isn’t targeting you, it’s targeting the Nether Pavilion.”

The Nether Pavilion! Yang Ye frowned, “Senior, just be frank, alright? I’m quite confused by what you’ve said so far.”

Meanwhile, Hai Lanxin said, “They used you to almost make the demon race become enemies with the Nether Pavilion. Fortunately, those old fellows from the demon race were no fools, and they didn’t fall for that trap. The reason we’re so concerned about it is because we’re slightly related to the Nether Pavilion.”

“It’s slightly related to you?” Yang Ye was puzzled, “Really?”

Hai Lanxin explained, “Ice Maiden is from my oceanic race, and Blind Maiden is from the devil race.”

This time, Yang Ye was really quite shocked. He wasn’t very surprised that Ice Maiden was from the oceanic race. Because she’d been amongst the oceanic race when he met her for the first time. But he hadn’t expected that Blind Maiden was from the devil race.

Meanwhile, Ke Wuming said, “Even though Blind Maiden is from my devil race, there’s actually no ties between us. The reason we’re paying attention to this is because we’re afraid that power will resort to other schemes. That power almost dragged the demon race into their war with the Nether Pavilion, and we’re afraid they have other schemes that would drag our devil race and oceanic race into it as well.”

Ke Wuming shook his head at this point, “The races have been at peace for many years. Once war breaks out, the consequences would be unimaginable.”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “I don’t want to care about that. All I want to do is rescue my friend.”

“It’s too late for you to back out now.” Hai Lanxin continued, “You’re quite close to the Nether Pavilion, so that power will definitely use you to get to them. Moreover, if the Nether Pavilion comes up to the large world and enters into battle with them, you will definitely help the Nether Pavilion, right? All of us are aware of that, so how can they not be aware of that?”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “Even both of you don’t know anything about the one pulling the strings?”

“We know a little!” Ke Wuming spoke solemnly, “The only thing we know is that its forces cover the entire continent, including the devil race and oceanic race. You can say that they’re definitely aware that you’re here right now. That’s the true reason for our worry. Because they have forces in every single race, so their goals are certainly not ordinary!”

Hai Lanxin shook her head, “You may not be aware of what the Nether Pavilion’s arrival here means. It means that the world will collapse. If every single one of them recovers to their prime, then even the Lord of the Heaven Dao wouldn’t be able to suppress them. Not to mention that the Lord of the Heaven Dao has vanished for countless years. In short, the day the Nether Pavilion comes up here to the large world will be the day that a storm of blood sweeps through the continent.”

Yang Ye fell silent. The Nether Pavilion was definitely going to take revenge. But the power pulling the strings and acting against the Nether Pavilion was so strong, and it was linked with all the races on the continent. Yang Ye could imagine that a war between all races may erupt at that time. As for him, he would definitely take the Nether Pavilion’s side. That power pulling the strings was definitely aware of that as well. So, in other words, that power will definitely not let him live. Or perhaps, it could be said that they had already started to plot against him.

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then he said, “No matter what, thank you for telling me all of that. I’ll remember this kindness you’ve shown me. Besides that, I know a little about the Nether Pavilion. I have no doubt that they’ll take revenge, but they have no intention to destroy the continent. Their objective is very simple, and it’s that power which acted against them all those years ago.”

Hai Lanxin nodded slightly, “Yang Ye, you’re at the center of a storm right now. Be careful!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Thank you for the reminder. Seniors, I have other matters to attend to, so I’ll be taking my leave now. I’ll pay a visit sometime later!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around and vanished from the hall.

Once Yang Ye left, Ke Wuming suddenly asked, “What do you think about him?”

Hai Lanxin replied, “An extraordinary genius!”

Ke Wuming nodded, “If he’s given a little more time, he’ll be truly extraordinary!”

Hai Lanxin said, “Actually, he’s extraordinary right now.”

Ke Wuming sighed, “The Nether Pavilion… The continent is about to fall into chaos again! I wonder if the Lord of the Heaven Dao will come…”

“Perhaps!” Hai Lanxin spoke softly, “If the Lord of the Heaven Dao doesn’t return, then the continent might be blasted apart!”
