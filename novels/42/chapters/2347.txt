Chapter 2348 – Destiny Cannot be Defied!

Invincibility!

A moment of silence ensued, and then roaring laughter came from the stone tablet. The laughter lasted for a very, very long time before the mysterious voice said, “Invincibility? Who in the world can truly accomplish that? Even the mysterious and ethereal destiny that rules over everything dares not call itself invincible.”

The woman in a white dress glanced at the stone tablet and said, “If I don’t try, how would I know? What if I succeed?”

The stone tablet fell silent.

A long time passed before it shook violently and exploded apart.

The woman’s expression remained indifferent.

After it exploded apart, an extremely old man appeared before her. The old man was old to a horrifying extent. His face was covered in wrinkles that seemed like they were carved by a blade, and his skin was so dry it seemed to be completely devoid of moisture.

Old, hunchbacked, and seeming like he would die in just a moment.

The old man sized up the woman and said, “In the Eternal Dimension, there is a saying—Destiny can be guessed, but it cannot be defied. Do you know what that means?”

She shook her head.

The old man said, “In the beginning, we believed that our destinies were in our hands, and we could overcome the heavens. But in the end, we discovered that the heavens were the heavens, and all things had their own destinies. All ends were predetermined.”

When he spoke up to this point, he walked to the side and looked up at the distant sky, “My Martial Dao is encompassed in one word—Defiance. Defy destiny and control the universe. It’s a path of no return, a path I, Wu Ni, took my entire life, and I’m unable to go further anymore. If you’re unafraid of it, you can become my disciple and take this path of mine.”

The woman looked up at the old man, “Are you strong?”

“Strong?” He glanced at her and roared with laughter.

His laughter reverberated through the world!

After laughing for a while, he looked up at the sky and said, “Since the age of 30, I’ve been unmatched my entire life and have never been defeated. Even destiny fears me!”

Wu Ni!

…

Eternal Border. In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged in the room with his aura restrained within him.

Comprehension!

What was true?

His sword intent was at the Progenitor Realm, but it was still half a step away from the True Dao Realm, and it was because he hadn’t comprehended the truth of sword intent!

Just like that, days passed, and three months passed in the blink of an eye.

Ten days had passed on the outside world!

On this day, Tian Xiu went to the cultivation room, and she fell silent as she gazed at Yang Ye. Actually, Yang Ye’s natural talent wasn’t very good, and he’d really relied on his own hard work to get where he was today. As for being able to attain his current strength at such a young age, outsiders were actually unaware of the truth. If the time Yang Ye cultivated in this cultivation room was included, his age was far more than it seemed!

While relying on the Primordial Pagoda was like cheating, which expert in this world hadn’t obtained fortuitous encounters in their lives?

Tian Xiu restrained her thoughts, watched Yang Ye for a while, and then left.

Right when she was about to take a step out of the room, she suddenly stopped and turned around. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes.

Yang Ye stretched out his palm, and then a strand of sword intent dispersed from his palm.

True Dao Realm sword intent!

Yang Ye was quite excited, and he gazed at Tian Xiu, “Tian Xiu, during this time, I used the Sword Gourd to improve my sword intent, and then repeated that while using it as reference…”

Tian Xiu suddenly interrupted him, “You’re very excited about that?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I…”

She walked over to him, “Even if your sword intent attains the True Void Realm, you’re still an ant before your enemies!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

She turned around, “Come with me to see a person, and you’ve wasted too much time.”

Tian Xiu vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye laughed bitterly and glanced at his palm. There was a blood red glow there.

Slaughter intent!

This time, he hadn’t just comprehended the truth of sword intent, he’d done the same for slaughter intent. Unfortunately, they weren’t as strong as madness intent! However, madness intent required going mad, and that was a very depressing requirement for him.

Madness intent was actually strong because it was equivalent to stimulating a person’s entire potential and indirectly improved the might of his sword intent and slaughter intent.

Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda. In the starry sky, Tian Xiu said nothing and just led Yang Ye to the depths of space.

Tian Xiu spoke softly later, “If you want to use that axe, you can do so at any time. However, it’s your biggest trump card, so don’t use it unless it’s a critical moment. The second is your Sword Gourd. It’s very strong too. Especially those three swords within it. Coupled with your Sword Supreme and Sword Precursor, you have five swords. As the Sword Gourd nourishes them, they will grow stronger and stronger. So, use them well.”

She paused for a moment at this point and continued, “Both the axe and the Sword Gourd are things you do not possess the strength to subdue, and they are mostly staying with you and letting you use them because of Snowy. However, there’s no need to belittle yourself, and don’t think too much of divine treasures like them. If they are disobedient, just destroy them! Don’t let them have their way!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Tian Xiu hadn’t kept what she said away from the others in the Primordial Pagoda, so the Primordial Axe of Creation and the Sword Gourd truly had a blow struck to them. Especially the Sword Gourd, it couldn’t help but go close to Snowy.

It was really quite afraid of Tian Xiu because even Snowy would have to use her cuteness when that woman’s fury was unleashed!

Tian Xiu added, “Sword Scroll isn’t very useful to you right now because you’re weak, and she will replace the Sword Gourd in the future to provide incredible assistance to you. As for Oxxy and Erya, while Oxxy’s bloodline is inferior to Erya, it isn’t weak. With the Primordial Violet Energy and Snowy’s help, it has boundless possibilities. If you have the time, you can help it improve too. As for Erya, she isn’t ordinary, and I can’t really see through her either. So, just treat her normally. If she leaves one day, don’t stop her. Understand?”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he gazed at her and was about to speak, but she continued, “Your Sword Domain is your greatest lethal move. When you have the time, try to study it more often. Your talent and luck will determine how far you’ll be able to develop it. As for Snowy…”Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

She stopped and gazed at Yang Ye, “There is nothing but a pure relationship between the two of you. However, the people of the world don’t care about that. Snowy is too, too useful, and she’d linked to too, too many things. Your life is bound to never be peaceful while you have her. Of course, if you’re able to survive until the day she becomes a Sprite Progenitor, your good luck shall arrive. At that time, all the enemies before you will be begging you to be their friend.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Tian Xiu, are you leaving?”

She didn’t answer him and continued forward.

While they were walking, they moved extremely swiftly.

A short while later, Tian Xiu said, “During my fight with the undying race’s patriarch, he fled in the end.”

Yang Ye frowned, “He fled?”

Tian Xiu replied indifferently, “It was my mistake. I thought he would choose to fight me to the end. Unfortunately, he didn’t. But it’s fine. He won’t be able to escape.”

She fell silent for a moment at this point and continued, "Snowy and you are the only ones I care about. However, I can’t protect both of you forever, and I don’t want to do that either. If a wolf doesn’t temper itself, it’ll never become a king amongst the wolves. Moreover, if the patriarch of the undying race remains alive, I would be disappointing all the members of my void spirit race!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “I understand!”

Tian Xiu said, “True Dao, True Void, True World, and then it’s Half-Step World Lord and World Lord. The World Lord Realm is a lord of a realm. Actually, it’s the formation of a small world within the body, and you are the lord of that world. Experts like those are still a huge threat to you. However, you have many treasures, so you still have the strength to fight them. It’s those at the Limitbreaker Realm who are a true threat to you!”

Yang Ye asked, “The Limitbreaker Realm?”

She nodded, “The Limitbreaker Realm is the ability to break through limits. The limit here is a critical point of this world. Every world has its own critical point, and so does the Eternal Border. If I attack it, my strength is sufficient to destroy the critical point of Eternal Border. In that way, Eternal Border would be destroyed. There are those who guard this world, and they won’t allow anyone to destroy this world. Just like when my void spirit race was in the large universe, I protected the large universe. If anyone wanted to destroy that critical point, that person would have to go through me!”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Expects like these cannot fight in Eternal Border, but it’s not an absolute rule. So long as they don’t damage the critical point of this world, the guardians of this world won’t have a reason to go after them. Moreover, the ties between these powers is like a huge web, so even if their relationship with the guardians of this world aren’t very good, it wouldn’t be very bad either. So, those guardians will never take your side. So long as they give those people some allowances, you’ll be finished!”

Yang Ye listened silently.

Tian Xiu continued, “Of course, that isn’t the greatest threat to you. The greatest threat to you is the strongest people of this world. Just like me, they are able to ignore the rules on many occasions. If they act against you, you wouldn’t have even the slightest chance against them. So, I’m taking you to a place to meet experts like that.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Tian Xiu replied, “So they don’t act against you!”

Yang Ye asked, “Will they agree?”

Tian Xiu glanced at him and said, “I’ll kill them if they don’t!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Suddenly, Tian Xiu stopped and said, “We’re here!”

She waved her right hand, and they vanished from the starry sky.

Both of them descended to the ground, and a violet bamboo forest was before them. Every single bamboo was thick as a pillar, and they were very tall too. They were over 30m tall, and they could simply be described as blotting out the sky!

Tian Xiu led Yang Ye to the bamboo forest and said, “This is my brother. I’ve brought him here to seek a promise from you.”

She received no reply.

Tian Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly, “The void spirit race’s Void Spirit Maiden would like to seek guidance from you. We shall decide both victory and death!”
