Chapter 2111 – Fight to the Death Against a Sage!

The main peak of the Weapon Dimension.

Yang Ye didn’t meet the Weapon Progenitor, and he only met the person in charge of the Weapon Dimension, Han Xian from the Prediction Line.

Han Xian!

There had been enmity between them in the past. After all, Zhong Ye and him had attacked the Prediction Line that day. Yet now, the Weapon Path had sent Han Xian. Obviously, they didn’t plan to let Yang Ye leave safely.

There were four experts around Han Xian, the Seal Masters of the other lines. Besides that, there was a group of youths behind them, and they were the geniuses of the Weapon Path.

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “Looks like I won’t be able to just leave safely today.”

Han Xian spoke indifferently, “Since you’re here representing the Dao Path, you naturally must have a few spars. My Weapon Path wants to witness the strength of the Dao Path’s successor. I hope you don’t disappoint us!”

“Disappoint you?” Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “I won’t.”

He glanced at the surroundings and added, “While the relationship between me and the Weapon Path is over, Zhong Ye did help me a lot. So…”

“There’s no need for that!” Han Xian suddenly interrupted Yang Ye, “You don’t have to hold back today. We really want to witness the strength of a Dao Path’s successor!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he shrugged, “Are you going to do it? Or will the younger generation of your Weapon Path fight me? Allow me to give you a friendly reminder. Don’t send the young because I’m afraid the Weapon Path’s younger generation will be annihilated!”

The atmosphere here instantly became tense.

Arrogance!

Yang Ye was still as arrogant as he’d been in the past!

“Is that so?” Suddenly, a voice resounded, and then a young man walked over slowly. He was around the age of 25, and his figure was ramrod straight. He had two swords on his back!

A sword cultivator!

Most of the experts in the Weapon Path were sword cultivators.

The man walked over to Yang Ye and said, “They say you’re the number one sword cultivator in the younger generation of this large universe. I really want to see it for myself. You won’t refuse, right?”

Yang Ye glanced at him. The young man was at the Major Zen Realm at least. Needless to say, he was extraordinary for being able to attain this realm of cultivation at his age.

Yang Ye didn’t say anything, and he just withdrew Elysium.

After that, Yang Ye appeared above the young man, and then Elysium slammed down. It was like a swing which could blast the world apart, and its powerful might caused the entire mountain range to tremble.

Strength!

Pure physical strength!

Everyone here was shocked by this.

As for the young man, his expression had changed. Yang Ye’s attack was far stronger than he’d ever expected. However, his reaction wasn’t slow at all. He immediately flipped his palms, and then the swords on his back charged out and stabbed against Elysium.

Crack!

As soon as they collided, a clear crack resounded.

The swords had instantly cracked apart! At the same time, a powerful force blasted the young man away. However, Yang Ye didn’t stop. His figure flashed over to the young man and slammed Elysium down again.

“Sword Crash!” Meanwhile, the young man’s furious shout resounded, and then countless rays of sword energy surged out from him. In just an instant, they enveloped Yang Ye and Elysium.

Yang Ye’s expression didn’t change at all, and he just took Elysium in both hands and swung it.

Bang!

The sword energy around him were instantly obliterated. However, the young man had created a distance of 3km between them.

The young man stared at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, we’re having a fair fight, yet you’re actually using a divine weapon of the god race. How shameless of you!” He was naturally unhappy because Yang Ye’s Elysium was a divine weapon!

Yang Ye laughed with ridicule when he heard this, “How childish! I obtained it with my own ability, so why can’t I use it? If you don’t like it, get a divine weapon of your own!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye stomped his right foot down.

Bam!

The space here shook violently, and then Yang Ye appeared before the young man again before slamming Elysium down.

The young man’s pupils constricted violently. He didn’t dare to act carelessly and immediately formed a strange seal with both hands. In an instant, a huge ethereal sword appeared above him, and it forcefully blocked Yang Ye’s attack. However, it instantly seemed to fade. Yang Ye didn’t stop. He spun around and swung Elysium again.

Bang!

This time, the huge sword was obliterated, and then the young man was blasted away.

Bang!

He flew almost 10km before his figure finally slammed into a mountain, and his fate was unknown.

Silence filled the surroundings.

But Yang Ye didn’t stop. He charged into the mountain.

At the same time, Han Xian spoke abruptly, “Stop!”

However, Yang Ye ignored him and was already inside the mountain. Han Xian’s face instantly turned gloomy from the sight of this, and he was about to attack. However, a shrill cry came from within the mountain, and it was extremely miserable. A moment later, Yang Ye flew out of the mountain, and he was holding a bloody head.

It was the young man’s head!

The other experts from the Weapon Path had extremely gloomy expressions on their faces when they saw that Yang Ye had killed the young man, and there was an undisguised desire to kill in their eyes.

Han Xian stared at Yang Ye, “You really go too far!”

Yang Ye walked over to stand before the experts of the Weapon Path and casually tossed the bloody head over to Han Xian, “What? Stop joking. If he had the chance, he wouldn’t hesitate to chop off my head and hang it over there. Han Xian, I heard you’re very good at scheming against others, and I know you sent him so that my relationship with the Weapon Path will grow worse. But that’s fine. I’m not afraid of that.”

Yang Ye glanced at the experts here and continued, “The spars today will not be spars to determine a victor, it will be spars to determine who survives. So long as someone from the Weapon Path dares to spar with me, I’ll dare to kill that person. Since you refuse to let me leave, then I’ll play with you!”

If it was just sparring, he would naturally not go so far. Just like when he sparred with that genius from the Confucianist Path. They had stopped before it got too dangerous. Why? Because his opponent had no intention to take his life. Since his opponent had no intention to take his life, Yang Ye would naturally not try to take his opponent’s life. Yet now, the Weapon Path’s experts clearly wanted to use these spars to kill him.

Thus, he would naturally not show mercy.

The Weapon Path naturally had a temper of its own. So, being insulted like this was naturally not something they could just let go.

An old man suddenly stepped forward and walked over to Yang Ye, “When a genius of my Weapon Path went to your Dao Path, he was ‘entertained’ by a Sage of your Dao Path. Now that a genius of the Dao Path is here, we naturally have to entertain you well too, only then will we have shown you our full respect and…”

Yang Ye waved his hand and interrupted the old man, “Just cut the crap. If you want to bully me, then just be frank. Don’t try to make up such lousy excuses to make it sound right.”

The old man was a Sage!

The old man nodded slightly, “True. Since you’ve said that, I’ll just be frank. Come, let me see how strong you really are!”

Yang Ye nodded, “After being in the world of cultivators for so long, I’ve killed many, but I’ve never killed a Sage. It has always been a regret of mine. I hope I can make up for that regret today!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was in front of the old man when he appeared again. Meanwhile, the old man slowly pressed his right palm down.

Bang!

A wave of powerful force instantly surged out from the space before the old man. Yang Ye was caught off guard by this and blasted away. But it only took a moment for Elysium to leave Yang Ye’s grasp and shoot forward like an arrow.

Boom!

The powerful force of the collision instantly blasted the old man back, and as his figure moved backwards, Yang Ye suddenly appeared in front of Elysium and grabbed it. After that, he vanished on the spot.

Slam!

When facing this Sage, Yang Ye used just a single move, slamming Elysium at him! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

At most times, techniques were useless against experts at this level. Because there was no time to execute a technique in a battle of this level. So, the simpler a move was, the more practical it was!

Even though Yang Ye was using Elysium, the old man was no weakling. As soon as Yang Ye appeared in front of him, the old man had vanished on the spot. In an instant, countless afterimages appeared here. At the same time, countless powerful palms enveloped Yang Ye.

If Yang Ye was given enough time, he was naturally able to discern which of the afterimages was real. However, he didn’t have that much time. Yang Ye had no choice but attack them all, so he swung Elysium horizontally!

Yang Ye heard the sound of space being torn open at the same time.

Yang Ye’s face fell when he heard this, and then he felt like a sledgehammer had struck his chest.

Boom!

Yang Ye was blasted away.

The old man would naturally not give up such an opportunity. A few dozen afterimages shot forward in Yang Ye’s direction, and every one of them made space collapse in their wake!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He knew that if he couldn’t stop this attack, then he would be almost finished. The old man would definitely not give him a chance to recuperate!

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then Elysium vanished from his grasp.

It was replaced by a black sword!

Judgment!

After that, Yang Ye walked slowly in the old man’s direction, and a ray of sword energy appeared beneath his feet with every step he took.

Meanwhile, the afterimages had arrived before him!

Suddenly, Yang Ye grabbed his sword with both hands and stabbed it forward.

In an instant…
