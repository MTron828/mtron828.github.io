Chapter 1062 – She’s Injured!

Book 9 — Nothing Is As It Seems

“If you don’t have the strength, then don’t speak about things beyond your strength!” Lady’s figure vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye remained silent on the spot for a long time. Needless to say, what she said really did make sense. Act according to your own ability. If one’s ambition was greater than the scope of his ability, then that person would definitely be courting death.

Meanwhile, a woman in a white dress appeared before Yang Ye.

The Asura Queen!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly while he secretly put up his guard. She wasn’t like Lady. There was a slightly friendly relationship between him and Lady, so she’d helped him repeatedly. However, he wasn’t on friendly terms with the Asura Queen at all, and she was extremely hostile towards him as well. After all, he’d taken both the Tree of Creation and its fruits!

“I really don’t know why Master helps you!” Asura Queen walked over to Yang Ye and said, “What exactly is good about you? You’re weak, ugly, and always acting conceitedly. To be honest, I really don’t understand how you’ve been able to survive until now!”

Her voice became fierce at this point, “If you’re incapable, then don’t cause trouble. Yet you cause trouble when you’re incapable, and then you can’t even resolve it yourself. Do you know that Master’s injuries grow worse every time she fights? She’d originally recovered quite a bit, but now her injuries have worsened because of you! Once she’s unable to suppress the cosmic rays within her, then....”

Yang Ye interrupted her and frowned as he asked, “You’re saying that she’s injured?”

“If she wasn’t injured, why would she even be in this world?” She continued, “Yang Ye, if you cause trouble in the future, deal with it yourself. Alright?”

“Who injured her?” Yang Ye spoke in a low voice. He was really unable to imagine that she was injured. Moreover, there was actually someone in this world capable of injuring her. How powerful is that person?

Asura Queen spoke coldly, “Someone you have to look up to for your entire lifetime!”

Asura Queen vanished on the spot once she finished speaking. At the same time, her voice resounded here, “Don’t think you’re great because you killed an Emperor. Not to mention you, even 10,000 of you wouldn’t be able to harm an Emperor if you didn’t rely on that sword of yours.”

Yang Ye’s brows were knit tightly together as he stood on the spot. He didn’t mind Asura Queens ridicule and mocking; he cared about the fact that Lady was actually heavily injured. But it was obvious because if she wasn’t facing some problems, she would have definitely not sealed herself. Moreover, there was no need for her to stay in this world with the strength she possessed.

Did she want the tiny vortex to help her suppress those cosmic rays within her? Yang Ye took a deep breath. If it was possible, he was naturally willing to help her deal with that thing called cosmic rays. However, the problem was that the Primordial Pagoda hadn’t recovered at all. Moreover, it was still in a heavily damaged state right now. If it recovered, then perhaps it would be possible to resolve the problems that Lady face. But the possibility of that was extremely low right now!

After all, based on the Primordial Pagoda’s current state, it wasn’t just an extremely low possibility, it was absolutely impossible to resolve something that even troubled her!

I must restore the Primordial Pagoda as soon as possible! Yang Ye slowly clenched his fists. Regardless of whether it was the Nether Pavilion or White Deer Academy, they might be his enemies, and they were extremely formidable enemies that he couldn’t resist at all. Besides them, there was the Eye of the Heaven Dao and those guardians. They weren’t just possible enemies for him, they were his enemies!

If he didn’t possess sufficient strength, then these powers could annihilate him with absolute ease!

Suddenly, a red haired old man appeared in front of Yang Ye, and Xuwu Shen was standing by the old man’s side.

The red haired old man said, “I’m the Master of the Endless Devil Sect!”

As he spoke, the old man waved his right hand, and 10 corpses appeared before Yang Ye.

“These are the Saints of the Raging Mammoth Clan and Sky Tiger Clan that came to assist Sky Divine Hall earlier. We’ve dealt with them!” Xuwu Shen continued, “Even though we were hiding, we didn’t stand by idly!”

Yang Ye glanced at them, and then he waved his right hand and placed those corpses within the ancient sheath before he said, “Sky Divine Hall is gone. The north belongs to your Endless Devil Sect now.”

Yang Ye got on his sword and intended to fly off once he finished speaking.

Meanwhile, the red haired old man suddenly said, “Wait!”

Yang Ye stopped, and then he turned around to gaze at the old man. The old man pondered deeply for a moment before he said, “I want Xuwu Shen to go with you to participate in the competition at White Deer Academy!”

Yang Ye asked, “Do you not know how terrifying White Deer Academy is?”

“I do!” The old man nodded, and then he glanced at Yang Ye and said, “But I’m even more well aware of how terrifying you are!”

Yang Ye gazed at the old man for a long time before he spoke, “He might die there.”

The red haired old man replied, “Then it’s his fate!”

A short while passed before Yang Ye nodded and gazed at Xuwu Shen, “Let’s go!”

Xuwu Shen chuckled, and then he went over to Yang Ye’s side and struck Yang Ye lightly on the chest, “Carry me from now on!”

The red haired old man said, “I’ll seal off the information about everything which happened earlier. Nothing will spread out from here.”

Yang Ye nodded. Just like that, Xuwu Shen followed Yang Ye to Ocean of Clouds City.

They’d only just entered the city when Yang Ye saw Yu Wushuang and Lu Wan’er, and An Nanjing was in front of them.

All of them revealed smiles when they saw him.

...

The news about Yang Ye heading to the north to fight Lou Qianxiao swept through Pine Prefecture. But everyone in the prefecture was dazed in the end. Because Lou Qianxiao and the entire Sky Divine hall had vanished. Moreover, the entire prefecture seemed like it was coming to an end. Of course, no one linked the shocking changes in the prefecture to Yang Ye.

The entire prefecture was wondering what had happened in the north. In the end, all sorts of versions were created. But all of that wasn’t important, the important point was that Lou Qianxiao was dead while Sky Divine Hall was gone. However, Yang Ye was still alive!

At this point, countless people started rushing to Ocean of Clouds City and the Ancient Sword School.

Those who traveled to Ocean of Clouds City mostly intended to join Ocean of Clouds Academy and become a student of the academy. As for those who traveled to the Ancient Sword School, they were mostly sword cultivators. Since the Ancient Sword School could foster such a peerless genius like Yang Ye, then where else could sword cultivators go but there?

Of course, Yang Ye didn’t pay any attention to all of that.

...

In Yang Ye’s room. An Nanjing was lying on the bed while Yang Ye sat by her side.

Yang Ye said, “I should have looked for you sooner!”

She shook her head slightly, “You would have only been giving your life away if you came earlier!”

Yang Ye stretched out his hand to touch her cheek, “I won’t allow us to be split apart again.” As he spoke, he withdrew a Fruit of Creation and said, “This should be able to help you recover!”

An Nanjing nodded lightly.

After she consumed the Fruit of Creation, a faint golden glow instantly surged out from within her, and Yang Ye sat there silently and waited.

4 hours later, An Nanjing’s stomach suddenly started expanding. Yang Ye was shocked and quickly walked over to her. He stretched out his hand and placed it against her stomach. However, he’d only just come into contact with her stomach when he suddenly moved his palm away. At the same time, his hand actually started freezing.

Meanwhile, Mu Hanshan appeared here. Yang Ye gazed at Mu Hanshan.

She spoke solemnly, “A mysterious cultivation technique was implanted within her, and her profound energy has been transformed into Baleful Yin Energy. Such profound energy possesses extreme Yin characteristics, so she’ll only be able to survive if that profound energy is extracted from her.”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment, and then he undid her clothes and placed his palm against her stomach. Suddenly, Mu Hanshan stopped him and said, “That profound energy possesses extreme Yin characteristics. You’ll definitely die if it enters your body!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “No, it’s the one that will definitely be destroyed if it enters my body!” As he spoke, he moved his palm slightly, and a wave of suction force surged out from his palm.

His body was extremely abnormal. Regardless of whether it was the tiny vortex, the Heart of Slaughter, or the Qiong Qi, every single one of them was a formidable existence! Could such profound energy even rival them?

It didn’t take long for threads of cold energy to slowly seep out from An Nanjing’s stomach and enter Yang Ye’s body. This caused Yang Ye’s entire body to shiver, but it didn’t take long for the tiny vortex to start revolving. After that, all the cold energy was sucked into the tony vortex.

Mu Hanshan heaved a sigh of relief when she noticed that Yang Ye was fine.

An hour passed before Yang Ye withdrew his palm. Meanwhile, An Nanjing slowly opened her eyes. Yang Ye quickly asked, “How do you feel?”

An Nanjing scanned her body before she said, “I’m practically healed!”

She issued a command in her heart while she spoke, and then the flesh on her severed arms started to wriggle. It didn’t take long for her arms to be regrown.

Yang Ye withdrew Skysplit and passed it over to her, “How’s your current strength?”

An Nanjing took Skysplit and said, “I can kill Saints!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’m much more confident in my trip to White Deer Academy with you by my side.”

An Nanjing gazed at Mu Hanshan. Yang Ye naturally understood what she meant, and he immediately gazed at Mu Hanshan. The latter hesitated for a moment before lying on the bed.

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to immediately undo her clothes and place his palm against her stomach.

It didn’t take long for the Baleful Yin Energy within Mu Hanshan to be sucked out completely as well.

Once both of them were fine, he asked them to leave his room.

Yang Ye’s figure instantly slumped to the ground once they’d left, and he slowly undid his clothes. Beneath his clothes was a body covered in cracks.

Even though he hadn’t lost his cultivation and almost died again after executing the true form of Heavenrend, it wasn’t easy to endure at all. Especially at this moment. Not only had his body cracked apart, even his meridians had cracked apart. At this moment, his meridians would definitely collapse if he utilized his profound energy too much!

A long time passed before he withdrew a violet crystal and swallowed it, and then he started to absorb profound energy like a madman to recover from his injuries.

...

3 days later.

Yang Ye slowly opened his eyes in his room, and cracking resounded throughout his body. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“I’ve finally recovered!” Yang Ye took a deep breath. He’d had to use 3 days to completely recover from the injuries he’d suffered during the battle. Of course, the main reason was that the tiny vortex had helped him. Otherwise, not to mention 3 days, even 3 months would probably be insufficient for him to recover!

Suddenly, Yu Wushuang walked into his room.

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she remained silent for a long time before she passed a golden invitation to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye took it, glanced at it, and saw the following written on it.

The competition is in half a month from now. Ocean of Clouds City will be flooded with blood if you, Yang Ye, are not there.

White Deer Academy. The Law Faction.
