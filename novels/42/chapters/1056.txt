Chapter 1057 – A Madman I Am!

7 rays of light flashed, and then Jian Wuchen and the others appeared in front of Yang Ye.

Daoist Gu and the others had vigilant expressions on their faces while their profound energy was already circulating. They were ready to fight at a moment’s notice. Because the 17 Saints of Sky Divine Hall were standing around them!

Jian Wuchen said, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye stood up and kissed An Nanjing lightly on the forehead, and then he walked over to Lou Qianxiao.

Jian Wuchen and the others’ eyelids twitched when they witnessed this scene. Because if Yang Ye killed Lou Qianxiao right now, then there probably wouldn’t be a single one of them who could make it out of the city alive.

Yang Ye placed a sword against Lou Qianxiao’s neck, and then he looked up at the white haired old man in the sky, “Let the experts of my Ancient Sword School leave. I’ll make you bury your own son if you refuse!”

The white haired old man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he said, “You’re the 2nd person who has dared to threaten me in the last 1,000 years.”

A ray of light flashed.

Hiss!

Lou Qianxiao’s other leg was separated from his body!

Everyone here was astounded.

That fellow really is a madman!

Yang Ye gazed at the white haired old man and said, “I told you to let them go. Do you not understand me? Do you want me to repeat myself?”

The white haired old man gazed at Yang Ye for a short while, and then he waved his hand lightly. In an instant, all the Saints that were surrounding Yang Ye’s group moved aside.

The white haired old man said, “They can leave now!”

Yang Ye gazed at Jian Wuchen and said, “Senior, I’ll be troubling you with taking them back to the Ancient Sword School!”

Jian Wuchen replied, “Come with us!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “None of us will be able to leave if I do that.”

After all, Sky Divine Hall would absolutely not allow him to take Lou Qianxiao with him, and he wasn’t stupid enough to do that.

Daoist Gu spoke solemnly, “I’ll stay behind!”

Yang Ye shook his head again and said, “Even Saints can’t catch up to my full speed. Senior Jian Wuchen, Senior Gu, don’t waste anymore time here. Leave first. I, Yang Ye, am a lucky person. I won’t die so soon.”

Jian Wuchen took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, and then he nodded in the end. He said, “Come back alive. So long as you can make it to the Ancient Sword School, then Sky Divine Hall won’t be able to kill you. Because we can contact our founding ancestor there and ask her to descend to this world. So, you must come back. Understand?”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he flicked a Fruit of Creation to An Nanjing, “Wait for me!”

An Nanjing blew lightly, and the Fruit of Creation instantly flew back to Yang Ye, “Give it to me when you return.”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and cracked a smile, “It’s a promise!”

“Let’s go!” Jian Wuchen waved his right hand, and a ray of light enveloped them. A moment later, all of them vanished on the spot.

The white haired old man said, “They’re gone!”

“Someone once told me that I, Yang Ye, am a rash and bold person who doesn’t know how to exercise forbearance. That person said I don’t know how to compromise and avoid trouble, and I don’t know how to consider the overall situation of things. To be a little blunt, I, Yang Ye, am an absolutely rash fellow. A rash fellow who would disregard the consequences as long as it satisfied me. Many people say that it’s a flaw, and there are many occasions where even I think it’s a flaw and I should change.” Yang Ye walked over to Lou Qianxiao, and then he looked up at the white haired old man, “Do you think I should change?”

“Kill him and you’ll definitely die!” The old man looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “So, do you think that you should change?”

“Yang Ye!” Meanwhile, the green robed old man suddenly shouted furiously, “Lou Qianxiao is a disciple of my Double Happiness Sect. I’ll definitely obliterate you if you dare to kill him.”

“The Double Happiness Sect?” Yang Ye chuckled, and then a savage expression arose on his face, “Why should I change? As a man, I should repay all enmity tenfold! No! A hundredfold! As a man, I should be ready to let blood flow when I’m displeased! As a man, I should act when I should, and I should kill when I should!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a ray of light flashed.

Hiss!

Lou Qianxiao’s head shot up into the air while followed by a pillar of blood. At the same time, a ray of light shot up into the air, and Lou Qianxiao’s head instantly exploded into pieces.

“Heaven’s Gravestone!” Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s furious roar resounded.

Bang!

A pillar of blood shot into the sky. In an instant, the sky had turned scarlet red, and it was like the end of the world had arrived.

“Slash!” Yang Ye’s voice resounded again. A blood red wave of energy flashed, and then a shrill cry resounded.

The spectators looked over to the source of the cry, and they saw a Saint from Sky Divine Hall exploding into pieces, and then countless strands of blood instantly surged towards the sword in Yang Ye’s grasp.

He killed a Saint with a single swing of his sword!All of them were stunned on the spot!

“You’re courting death!” The green robed old man was overwhelmed with rage when he saw Yang Ye disregard him and even kill Lou Qianxiao. His figure shot explosively towards Yang Ye.

This time, Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath because he’d turned completely blood red. Just like it had been before this, his left eye was blood red while his right eye was clear.

He was half awake yet half mad at the same time!

Yang Ye’s face instantly became ferocious when he sensed the old man charging at him, and he sheathed the blood red sword before drawing it swiftly!

100 overlapped Heavenrends!

It was 100 overlapped Heavenrends that were enhanced by Void Rank sword intent and slaughter intent!

Om!

A beam of blood red sword energy shot forward. The green robed old man was astounded, and countless strands of pink colored energy surged out from within him and slammed against Yang Ye’s sword energy.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded as the old man’s pink color energy was instantly blasted apart, and then a shrill cry resounded while the green robed old man was blasted away.

After he blasted the green robed old man away, Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the shadowy figures charged towards the Saints of Sky Divine Hall. It didn’t take long for his Sword Servants and the Saints of Sky Divine Hall to enter a pocket of space.

“Kill!” Meanwhile, countless cultivators from Sky Divine Hall charged at Yang Ye. Unfortunately, not a single one of them could resist a swing of Yang Ye’s sword. Conversely, some comparatively weaker cultivators even started to attack their own companions under the influence of Yang Ye’s Void Rank slaughter intent.

It was chaos! Extreme chaos!

Yang Ye raised his head to gaze at the white haired old man, and he seemed to be visibly struggling. Quite some time passed before he suddenly spoke, “Old Dog! It was you who severed An Nanjing’s arms and crippled her meridians, right?”

As he spoke, he instantly swung his sword at the old man, and a ray of blood red sword energy tore through the sky and shot at the white haired old man. However, that terrifying ray of sword energy vanished soundlessly before it could even reach the old man.

The Fox Queen and Devil Lion King’s pupils instantly constricted when they witnessed this scene. They exchanged glances and saw shock and horror in each other’s eyes.

Besides that, there was a huge amount of disbelief in their eyes!

The white haired old man closed his eyes, and quite some time passed before he opened them again. He looked down at Yang Ye and said, “I’d intended to leave this world quietly, but it looks like I won’t be able to do as I wanted. Qianxiao is dead, so I have no further worries. I, Lou Qianyun, swear that I’ll definitely slaughter everyone from your Ancient Sword School and Ocean of Clouds Academy! Everyone!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the white haired old man slapped his palm down.

The spectators watched with astonishment as Yang Ye’s figure was instantly blasted flying, and his figure flew over 10km away before his figure finally stopped upon colliding with a building.

But in the next moment, a ray of blood red sword energy shot into the sky and flashed towards the old man!

“The strength of an ant!” The white haired old man waved his right hand lightly, and Yang Ye’s sword energy was instantly obliterated!

The old man was about to attack again, but a ray of light suddenly shot towards him from the sky. His eyes narrowed slightly, and then he slapped his palm forward. The ray of light instantly exploded apart and was obliterated!

Once the ray of light was blasted apart, Daoist Gu and Jian Wuchen appeared here.

The white haired old man glanced at them and spoke coldly, “Did you come to give your lives away?”

“Seniors!” Meanwhile, Yang Ye appeared in front of them and said, “Why... why have both of you come back?” At this moment, while Heaven’s Gravestone’s slaughter intent was eroding his will, he was still fine and able to maintain his consciousness.

Jian Wuchen gazed at the white haired old man for a long time, and then he gazed at Yang Ye. At this moment, Yang Ye’s skin had split apart and blood was seeping out incessantly from within him. In the end, all the blood which seeped out was absorbed by the blood red sword in Yang Ye’s grasp.

Jian Wuchen and Daoist Gu exchanged glances, and there was an extremely solemn expression in both their eyes.

Jian Wuchen spoke solemnly, “You’re no match for him. Go back to the sword school!”

Daoist Gu spoke solemnly as well, “Go back right now!”

“Go back?” The white haired old man took a step forward. In an instant, the space throughout the area warped, “All of you can dream of leaving today!”

“Lou Qianyun, why don’t we head up into a pocket of space to fight?” Jian Wuchen took a step forward, and his sword energy shot into the sky!

“A pocket of space? No, there’s no need to go to such trouble!” The white haired old man stretched out his hand, and then a huge palm tore its way out of space and clawed at Daoist GU and Jian Wuchen!

Om!

Both Daoist Gu and Jian Wuchen attacked decisively, and countless rays of sword energy surged out from within. However, it only took a moment for their sword energy to suddenly stop on the spot, and then a moment of silence ensued before the sword energy was instantly obliterated!

Everyone here was dumbstruck, and it even included Jian Wuchen and Daoist Gu!

Bang!

Jian Wuchen and Daoist Gu were blasted away, and their figures slammed against the ground in the distance!

He’d defeated 2 Saints with a single attack!

Moreover, they weren’t ordinary Saints. After all, Jian Wuchen was called the number one sword cultivator in the south! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Tempestuous waves surged through Yang Ye’s heart as well. After all, Jian Wuchen and Daoist Gu’s strength couldn’t be compared to ordinary Saints at all. But they’d actually been defeated by a single attack from Lou Qianyun!

“The Emperor... Realm!” Suddenly, Jian Wuchen’s extremely weak voice arose from afar!

As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of light that shot forward. This time, flames were blazing all over his body!

He’d ignited his soul!

“Yang Ye! When you joined the Ancient Sword School, you once said that you’ll never betray the sword school if it doesn’t betray you. Remember that forever!”

As soon as Jian Wuchen finished speaking....

Bang!

An explosion that shook the surroundings resounded, and then a monstrous wave of energy that carried countless rays of sword energy swept towards the surroundings.

Everyone here was astounded and horrified!

But in the next moment, it seemed like time had frozen. After that, the wave of energy and rays of sword energy instantly vanished without a trace! It wasn’t just the wave of energy and rays of sword energy that had vanished, even Jian Wuchen was gone!

“Ant!” Lou Qianyun waved his right hand, and then Daoist Gu was slapped flying as well. In the end, Daoist Gu’s figure crashed to the ground. No one knew if he was still breathing.

Lou Qianyun walked towards Yang Ye as he spoke, “I suppressed my cultivation because I wanted to wait for Qianxiao’s reputation to reverberate throughout Pine Prefecture. Unfortunately, he’s dead now. That’s fine. I’ll make you and everyone related to you accompany him.”

As soon as Lou Qianyun finished speaking, he stretched out his right hand, and the space around Yang Ye instantly froze!

Suddenly, a woman’s voice appeared here, “After so many years, you’re still the same.”

Bang!

The space around Yang Ye exploded into pieces!
