Chapter 1638 - Immortal Phoenix Pavilion!

Translator: InVader

One on one?

Yang Ye had never considered that. At the very least, he’d never considered fighting the white haired old man in single combat. One on one battles depended upon the opponent he faced. If he clearly was no match for his opponent yet still insisted on a one on one battle, then wouldn’t he be courting death?

Yang Ye was about to attack when the white haired old man suddenly said, “There are a total of nine young masters participating in our Yang Clan’s fight for the position of successor. Even though I don’t really know them well, I still know a little about all of them. But I’m sure that you aren’t any one of them!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “What are you trying to say?”

The white haired old man looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “I suspect you aren’t from the Yang Clan!”

At this moment, Yang Ye was using the Sword Domain to conceal his aura, so the old man couldn’t sense his bloodline at all.

Yang Ye replied, “Does it make a difference?”

The white haired old man laughed coldly, “Of course. If you belong to the Yang Clan, then the fact that you killed Yang Danqing and Yang Kong will be an internal matter of our Yang Clan, and we’ll use our own internal methods to deal with it. But if you aren’t from the Yang Clan, then it isn’t internal anymore. Do you know what’s the consequence for an outsider who kills a member of our Yang Clan?”

The old man paused for a moment at this point and continued, “I know you definitely have other trump cards. But allow me to guarantee that if you aren’t from the Yang Clan, then you won’t be able to see tomorrow’s sunrise.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he flicked a droplet of blood over to the white haired old man.

He didn’t want to become enemies with the entire Yang Clan right now. He wasn’t that stupid. If he openly went against the Yang Clan, then not to mention killing Yang Yan and recusing Little Sky, even survival would be a problem for him.

The white haired old man gazed at the pearl of blood for a long time before he said, “You belong to the Yang Clan.”

Yang Ye said, “And?”

The old man gazed at him, “Even though I don’t know which young master you are, I’m certain that I’ll find out very soon. Kid, just you wait. The Discipline Hall will come for you.”

As soon as he finished speaking, his body gradually became ethereal.

Yang Ye didn’t do anything because the old man was gone.

The old man naturally chose to leave. Even though he was strong, Yang Ye and two Blood Puppets weren’t something that he could fight again. If he allowed the fight to continue, then he may lose his life here. So, he’d decisively chosen to leave.

Yang Ye didn’t chase after the old man. If an expert like the white haired old man chose to leave, then he could do nothing about it. Moreover, he didn’t want to make things irreconcilable. Killing the white haired old man would be a little too much. It wasn’t necessary to fight the Discipline Hall to the death! It wasn’t worth it!

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while and was about to leave. However, he suddenly looked towards the right, “Show yourself?”

A moment of silence ensued, and it didn’t take long for the space there to ripple. After that, Yang Xuan appeared not too far away from him.

Yang Xuan said, “You really are alive!”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “I had good luck.”

Yang Xuan glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Let’s talk about that later. Come back with me. We have many more things to do.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “We do?”

She replied, “Do you know what the fight for succession represents? Simply speaking, it’s like the fight for the throne in the mortal world. Perhaps the losing side won’t be annihilated in our Yang Clan, but the losing side will definitely be pushed far away from the center of authority. As for the winning side, they won’t just possess supreme authority in the clan, the others who follow them will enjoy status and wealth too.”

Yang Ye asked, “What are you trying to say?”

Yang Xuan replied, “Being the successor has its benefits. What benefits? Let’s skip the future benefits for now. So long as you become the successor, you’ll gain priority access to all the resources of the Yang Clan. Cultivation techniques, combat techniques, weapons… So long as the Yang Clan has them, you can have them. Because you’ll be fostered to be the next patriarch. Simply speaking, so long as you become the successor, the gap between you and the other young masters will grow larger and larger.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “You won’t be the only one who benefits. Everyone who stands by your side will be on the priority list to be fostered. If you become the successor, then I’ll definitely advance a step further and obtain even more authority.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand.” It was as they say, when one attains success, everyone around him benefits.

Yang Xuan nodded, “Come, there are two people who want to meet you.”

Yang Ye asked, “Who?”

Yang Xuan remained silent for an instant and replied, “Your father’s old subordinates and two of the current seven marshals. Be respectful.” As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he followed her.

She knew Yang Ye didn’t know much about the Yang Clan, so Yang Xuan ceaselessly told him about the Yang Clan while they traveled.

Yang Ye gradually gained a rough understanding of the Yang Clan.

The patriarch was naturally the one with the greatest authority in the Yang Clan. The patriarch’s name was Yang Wutian. he was the strongest expert in the Yang Clan, and one of the strongest experts in the medium universe of Milky Way System. Right below him was the Council of Elders. The Council of Elders was made up by the experts of the main and branch families of the Yang Clan.

All of them were top-rate experts, and their status in the Yang Clan was merely inferior to the patriarch. Besides that, the Council of Elders had another right, and it was to impeach the patriarch. If the patriarch tried to do something that harmed the interests of the clan, the Council of Elders could remove the patriarch from his position. Of course, the precondition was that over 80% of the elders agreed.

Beneath the Council of Elders was the Discipline Hall, and it was formed from the elites of the Yang Clan. As they say, a kingdom had its laws, and a family had its rules. The Yang Clan has its own rules, and there were numerous rules. However, it wasn’t easy to make people abide by those rules.

So, the Discipline Hall was born.

The Discipline Hall was authorized to kill before questioning when dealing with those who broke the rules. So, the Discipline Hall’s authority in the Yang Clan was huge.

Below the Discipline Hall were the seven marshals. They controlled 70% of the Yang Clan’s forces, and they guarded the various worlds belonging to the Yang Clan. The seven marshals only obeyed the patriarch’s orders, and both the Council of Elders and Discipline Hall had no authority over them.

Further below the seven marshals were the 72 warriors. They were the central strength of the Yang Clan because one had to be at the Zenith Realm at least to be ranked amongst them, and it was impossible for an ordinary Zenith Realm expert to be ranked amongst them as well!

Besides the 72 warriors, there were the four armies. The Immortal Phoenix Army, the Dragon God Guard, the Black Turtle Army, and the Tiger Fang Camp. Yang Xuan was the commander of the Immortal Phoenix Army!

The main mission of the four armies and 72 warriors was to protect the Yang Clan’s headquarters, Heaven Void Continent.

Besides that, there was one other army. It was the most mysterious army of the Yang Clan. However, only the patriarchs knew about it.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye and Yang Xuan to arrive at Phecda City.

…

The Immortal Phoenix Pavilion.

Yang Xuan led Yang Ye to an underground cultivation room in the Immortal Phoenix Pavilion. There was a man and a woman in the room. The man seemed to be a little over 30 years of age. He wore a luxurious robe, had his hands behind his back, a square shaped face, a hardened appearance, and an extremely calm gaze.

As for the woman by the man’s side, Yang Ye couldn’t see her appearance because it was covered by a veil. Even though her face was concealed, her curvaceous figure was extremely hot.

Yang Ye instantly revealed an extremely solemn expression on his face when he saw them.

Because they actually felt unfathomable to him!

They were even stronger than the white haired old man from the Discipline Hall!

That was his intuition!

Experts above the Zenith Realm?

When Yang Ye walked in, the middle aged man and woman had immediately gazed at him.

A short while passed before the middle aged man suddenly said, “The Sword Domain?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The middle aged man nodded slightly, “Attack.”

Attack? Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he understood what the man meant. The middle aged man wanted to see his strength.

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Ye vanished on the spot. He was in front of the middle aged man when he appeared again, and then he stabbed his sword forward.

The middle aged man’s expression was calm as he tapped his finger against the tip of Yang Ye’s sword.

Om!

bang!

The sword shook violently, and then a huge wave of force blasted Yang Ye 3km back.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. The middle aged man’s strength wasn’t just slightly superior to the white haired old man, it was far superior!

Meanwhile, the middle aged man added, “Be more serious.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly. A moment later, his figure transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot. At the same time, a ray of sword energy flashed forward. Space was instantly torn into pieces by it, and a very long spatial rift appeared here.

The sword energy carried Yang Ye’s Slaughter Sword Intent as it arrived before the middle aged man.

The middle aged man’s expression remained calm, and he suddenly tapped his finger forward when the sword energy was just a few dozen centimeters away from him.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s sword energy was instantly blasted into bits. However, the middle aged man’s eyes suddenly narrowed. Because Yang Ye had suddenly appeared behind him. At the same time, the tip of Yang Ye’s sword had arrived before his back.

Hiss!

The sword shot through him, but Yang Ye was shocked instead. Because the middle aged man was 3km away.

The beautiful woman glanced at Yang Ye, and there was a trace of surprise in her eyes.

Because the middle aged man’s back had a cut. It wasn’t very deep, and it was just around 2cm deep.

The middle aged man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Your Laws of Darkness are quite different. You’re actually able to move so soundlessly. Ordinary Zenith Realm experts won’t be able to defend themselves against that attack.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Yang Ye shook his head, “Unfortunately, you did. Are we still going to continue?”

The middle aged man shook his head slightly, “It isn’t necessary anymore.”

Meanwhile, the beautiful woman suddenly said, “Try a move of mine, alright?”

Yang Ye gazed at her. He was about to speak when she suddenly appeared before him. After that, her eyes suddenly started to spin strangely. In an instant, Yang Ye’s eyes became blank, and then he seemed to have been petrified on the spot.

The woman took two steps back and spoke indifferently, “It’s done.”

The middle aged man said, “He possesses the Enlightened Sword Heart.”

She replied, “His cultivation is too low. Even the Enlightened Sword Heart is useless. If you don’t believe me, just watch.” As she spoke, she flicked a strand of energy towards Yang Ye’s chest.

Hiss!

A string of blood sprayed from Yang Ye’s chest. However, Yang Ye’s eyes were still blank, and he didn’t react at all.

“Be careful. Don’t destroy his mind.” Suddenly, a black shadow appeared from a distant corner, “A braindead person is useless to us.”

Yang Xuan, the middle aged man, and the beautiful woman immediately bowed slightly when they saw the black shadow.
