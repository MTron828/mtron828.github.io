Chapter 1662 - I’ve Never Backed Down!

Translator: InVader

What was it?

The Soul Nurturing Tree!

The Ku Clan’s Soul Nurturing Tree!

Yang Ye hadn’t expected the Soul Nurturing Tree to follow him again.

At the same moment that he was stunned by this, Snowy had suddenly emerged from the Primordial Pagoda. She immediately gazed at the Soul Nurturing Tree and cracked a smile, and then she flashed over to it, grabbed it by a branch, and entered the Primordial Pagoda!

Yang Ye was stunned speechless by this.

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s expression changed. He remained silent for just an instant before an idea came to him, and he hurriedly shouted with fury, “Who are you?! Let go of the Soul Nurturing Tree!”

As he spoke, he drew his sword and swung it towards the distance.

Om!

A sword howl resounded through the entire sky, and then a ray of sword energy shot into the depths of the starry sky. It didn’t take long for a loud explosion to resound far away.

After that, Yang Ye was about to ‘chase after the thief’, but three old men had appeared by his side.

Two of them were Ku Rong and the old man in a luxurious robe from before.

Yang Ye was about to speak when he saw them, but Ku Rong’s figure flashed off in the direction of Yang Ye’s sword energy. As for the old man in a luxurious robe and another old man in a linen robe, they both remained on the spot and stared at Yang Ye without blinking.

Around three breaths of time later, Ku Rong returned, and then he gazed at the other two old men and shook his head.

The face of the old man in a luxurious robe turned gloomy, and then both he and Ku Rong simultaneously gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye blinked, “Seniors, what’s going on?”

The old man in a luxurious robe fell silent for a few breaths of time and said, “You have it, right?”

Yang Ye had a puzzled expression on his face, “I have it? Have what?”

Ku Rong suddenly said, “The Soul Nurturing Tree!”

“Don’t joke with me!” Yang Ye jumped, “Seniors, are you joking? How could it possibly be with me?”

Both of them didn’t speak, and they just gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye said, “Seniors, I did see the tree just now, but I hadn’t even been able to react before a black robed old man grabbed it. Look, I even attacked him. However, he was truly too fast.”

Ku Rong shook his head slightly, “I went in that direction and didn’t see any black robed old man.”

Yang Ye shrugged, “Seniors, if you think I have it, then search me. I’m even willing to let you search my spatial ring!”

Ku Rong and the old man in a luxurious robe exchanged glances, and then the old man swept Yang Ye with his divine sense. Yang Ye didn’t resist it and allowed the old man’s divine sense to even sweep through his spatial ring.

The reason Yang Ye dared to let the old man search him was because he was confident in the Primordial Pagoda. The Primordial Pagoda couldn’t be compared to the past anymore. So long as it wasn’t willing to be detected, then no one could detect its presence.

A short while later, the old man withdrew his divine sense. At the same time, his face became extremely unsightly.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “Seniors, you believe me now, right?”

The old man fell silent for a few breaths of time, and then he said, “Can you let me search your sea of consciousness? After all, some people are able to create a pocket of space in their seas of consciousness, and they can store things there. Don’t worry, I’ll only search and will absolutely not harm you!”

Yang Ye’s face fell, “Senior, isn’t that request a little too much? I’m sure you’re aware that allowing someone to enter my divine sense is like leaving my life in your hands.”

The old man nodded slightly, “I naturally understand that. But Young Brother, the Soul Nurturing Tree is extremely important to my Ku Clan, so…”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “What if it isn’t in my sea of consciousness?”

“If it isn’t, then it isn’t. What else do you want?” Meanwhile, the old man in a linen robe, who hadn’t spoken until now, spoke coldly, “Don’t tell me you want us to apologize to you?”

Ku Rong’s expression changed when he heard this, and he knew the situation was about to take a turn for the worse.

Ku Rong was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly gazed at the old man in a linen robe, “What the heck are you saying? I’m only cooperating out of consideration for Zhuyi. If I’m to be honest, what can you do to me if I refuse to cooperate?”

Even though they were Half-Step True Realm experts, he really didn’t fear them.

The eyes of the old man in linen robes narrowed slightly, “Why don’t you give it a try?”

Yang Ye shrugged, and then he turned around and walked away. Meanwhile, the old man in a linen robe spoke coldly, “You brought this upon yourself! I tried to give you some face!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stretched out his hand and made a clawing motion at Yang Ye. This action caused a wave of powerful energy to envelop Yang Ye, and then Yang Ye’s bones started to make cracking noises beneath the pressure from it.

A vicious glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, and then a wave of terrifying slaughter intent swept out from him, and then the old man’s energy was instantly obliterated!

Zenith Rank slaughter intent!

Their expressions changed when they witnessed this. All three of them hadn’t expected that Yang Ye had actually comprehended slaughter intent, and it was even at the Zenith Rank!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot, and he was in front of the old man when his figure appeared again. After that, he drew his sword and swung it!

Ten overlapped Heavenrends!

Heavenrends that were enhanced by Returnal Rank sword intent and Zenith Rank slaughter intent!

At the instant Yang Ye’s sword energy shot forward, the powerful energy it contained pushed both Ku Rong and the old man in a luxurious robe a few steps back. As for the old man in linen robes, his expression changed. He didn’t dare act carelessly when facing this attack, and he swiftly slammed both his fists at Yang Ye’s attack.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the old man was pushed 300m back! Meanwhile, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

Boom!

At the moment Yang Ye’s figure vanished, another explosion resounded. At the same time, the linen robed old man was pushed around 1km back!

Yang Ye didn’t follow up with another attack. He just glanced coldly at the old man, “Do you understand now? I’m the one who gave you face, not you. Understand?”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away once he finished speaking.

Suddenly, the linen robed old man vanished on the spot, and he was behind Yang Ye when his figure appeared again. A huge axe had appeared in his grasp, and he held it in his right grasp as he swung it down at Yang Ye’s head.

Crack!

The space around Yang Ye instantly cracked apart as it descended.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly while the desire to kill flashed through his eyes. He immediately turned around and drew his sword.

Bang!

An explosion resounded as sword and axe collided, and then they shook violently before both Yang Ye and the old man were slammed backwards.

Ku Rong and the old man in a luxurious robe glanced at Yang Ye and the old man in a linen robe. Ku Rong was about to stop them from fighting, but the other old man stopped him and spoke indifferently, “Conceited youngsters who don’t know the limits of their own strength should be taught a lesson!”

Ku Rong glanced at the old man, hesitated for a moment, and nodded.

After they stopped themselves, the linen robed old man started walking slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, “Needless to say, your strength isn’t bad. However, do you think I’m weak? Allow me to teach you a lesson on behalf of your parents.”

Yang Ye’s face instantly turned savage when he heard the old man, and then he transformed into a ray of blood red light that vanished on the spot. He was in front of the linen robed old man when his figure appeared again, and then he swung the blood red sword in his grasp.

The old man laughed fiercely as he swung his axe forward at Yang Ye’s sword.

Clang!

Both of them were pushed back repeatedly upon colliding with each other. However, Yang Ye didn’t take long to stop himself, and then he once again transformed into a ray of blood red light that charged at the linen robed old man!

At this moment, Yang Ye was once again fighting without any regard for his life.

In the beginning, the old man had been able to fight Yang Ye equally, but he was gradually unable to withstand Yang Ye. Because Yang Ye was too ruthless. Every single attack he launched was one where he intended to trade his life for the old man’s life. But how could the old man be willing to do that?

Since he was concerned about his own life, he started to gradually fall into a disadvantaged position.

As for Yang Ye, he grew more and more ruthless and ferocious as the battle progressed!

Ku Rong and the old man in a luxurious robe had quite unsightly expressions on their faces. Because they hadn’t imagined that a Rebirth Realm cultivator like Yang Ye would actually be able to suppress a Half-Step True Realm expert.

They were about to attack when the space in the battlefield collapsed. As soon as a black hole appeared there, the expressions of both Ku Rong and the other old man changed drastically because the black hole had actually started to shrink!

“Attack!” They didn’t dare hesitate and intended to attack immediately. However, the black hole suddenly stopped shrinking, and then a figure was blasted out of it.

It was the linen robed old man!

The old man hadn’t even stopped himself when a ray of light suddenly surged out from within the black hole, and then Yang Ye appeared before the old man. He stomped his foot down on the old man’s chest, and then held his sword in both hands as he stabbed it downwards and stopped it right before it pierced the old man’s forehead. He said, “You said you want to teach me a lesson on behalf of my parents? You said that, right?”

“Yang Ye! Let him go!” Meanwhile, the old man in a luxurious robe spoke abruptly, “If you kill him, my Ku Clan will definitely not let you go! I don’t think you want to become enemies with my Ku Clan, right?”

Yang Ye turned his head and shot a glance at the old man in a luxurious robe, “Threatening me with the Ku Clan?”

The old man replied indifferently, “I’m just telling you a fact!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Indeed, I don’t want to become enemies with the Ku Clan.” He looked down at the linen robed old man and said, “I’ll give Zhuyi face. Just apologize and I’ll forget this ever happened.”

The old man stared at Yang Ye while a wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of his mouth, “Apologize? What? Did what I said strike a soft spot? However, you do seem like a pussy! And a piece of trash who didn’t have a mother to raise him!”

Yang Ye bent down to look at the old man, “You think I don’t dare to kill you?”

“Do you?” Disdain filled the corners of his mouth, “Not to mention the Yang Clan, even the Ying Clan would give my Ku Clan some face. You…”

Suddenly, a ray of light flashed through the linen robed old man’s throat.

Hiss!

His head instantly flew up into the air while accompanied by a torrent of blood.

Yang Ye sheathed his sword, and then he turned to look at Ku Rong and the old man in a luxurious robe, “In all my life, I’ve suffered, and I’ve experienced fear, but I’ve never backed down!”
