Chapter 1466 – A River!

Bang!

As soon as the fat man finished speaking, he was blasted away again, and blood sprayed incessantly from his mouth as he flew through the air.

Meanwhile, the demon beast charged at him again.

The fat man’s expression changed slightly, and he hurriedly said, “Fine, five million!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a ray of light flashed. It was extremely fast and instantly arrived behind the demon beast.

A wisp of viciousness flashed through the demon beast’s eyes when it noticed the sword energy behind it, and then it turned around and slammed its hammer down.

Boom!

The ray of light was blasted into bits, and then Yang Ye appeared before the fat man.

The demon beast turned to look at Yang Ye, and it was about to attack when Yang Ye waved his right hand. Big Blackie and Little Blackie appeared in front of him. The demon beast’s eyes instantly narrowed slightly when it saw the Celestial Demon Wolves, and then it didn’t attack.

Meanwhile, a wisp of surprise flashed through the fat man’s eyes. Obviously, he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually possess such powerful demon beasts!

Yang Ye gazed at the demon beast and spoke flatly, “Leave?”

The demon beast stared at Yang Ye while a trace of hesitation appeared in its eyes. Meanwhile, the demon wolves roared furiously into the air, and then they gazed at the demon beast with a ferocious glow in their eyes.

The demon beast glanced at them, and then a wisp of ferocity flashed through its eyes as well.

As soon as he saw that, Yang Ye waved his hand and said, “Beat it up!”

The demon wolves immediately leaped at the demon beast. Yang Ye was quite surprised because that demon beast was actually not afraid of them, and it immediately charged at them.

It’s going to fight two on its own?

Yang Ye was quite surprised. He was surprised by the demon beast’s courage. Based on its aura, it was stronger than the demon wolves, but it was only slightly stronger. The joint forces of the demon wolves were definitely stronger than it. However, it dared to fight them! Its courage was commendable!

Yang Ye was even more shocked when he saw that it was actually not disadvantaged in the battle with the demon wolves!

Its strength was really not bad!

A wisp of excitement flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, and then he waved his hand and summoned Eaglet. The demon beast’s pupils constricted when it saw Eaglet, and then it intended to flee.

Obviously, it was no fool. It could barely stand its ground against two opponents. But if it was three opponents.... Actually, it wouldn’t fear fighting three of them. However, there were two humans at the side!

So, the demon beast fled decisively.

Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “Don’t let it escape. Drag it back in!”

If it was a group of demon beasts, then he would naturally have to run on sight. However, it was just one demon beast! It was a demon beast on its own, and it was so strong! So, wasn’t that like a free subordinate for him?

Even though the demon beast was strong, it couldn’t fight against so many opponents. In the end, the fat man watched with astonishment as the demon beast was forcefully dragged into Yang Ye’s body.

...

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Big Blackie and the others released the demon beast. The demon beast was stunned for a moment, but it didn’t take long for it to recover from its shock, and it glared angrily at Big Blackie and the others while roaring madly. However, it didn’t attack. It didn’t have to be a genius to know that it couldn’t fight three other demon beasts. No, it was four.... Because a huge python that was comparable in size to a mountain was not too far away!

Big Blackie and the others paid no attention to the demon beast, and the Emperor Python didn’t pay any attention to it as well. All of them were looking at it and waiting to watch the show.

They would naturally not warn it that it should keep a low profile. After all, all of them had suffered suppression from the Primordial Pagoda, so how can the newcomer be an exception?

Sure enough, it had merely been roaring for a while when a wave of mysterious energy pressed down upon it.

Bang!

The demon beast was pressed flat on the ground.

...

In the outside world.

The fat man walked over to Yang Ye, sized up Yang Ye carefully, and spoke with curiosity in his voice, “Where did they go?”

Yang Ye didn’t answer the fat man and stretched out his hand instead. The fat man glanced at Yang Ye, and then passed a spatial ring to Yang Ye, “There’s a million divine crystals in there. I didn’t bring that much with me. Don’t worry, I, Shi Tian, am not someone who goes back on my word. Come to Stellar City and go to the Shi Clan. They’ll give you the balance.”

Yang Ye took the spatial ring and glanced at the fat man, “Shi Tian, the Shi Clan. You’re from the large world?” He’d naturally heard of the Shi Clan in Stellar City, and that Shi Clan was from the large world.

The fat man nodded and said, “That’s right. Now, you probably won’t think that I’ll refuse to pay, right?”

Yang Ye nodded. Actually, he hadn’t expected Shi Tian to even be able to produce five million divine crystals. After all, who would bring that much into this place? But he hadn’t expected this fellow to be from the Shi Clan. He didn’t know how strong the Shi Clan was, but he knew that it was absolutely terrifyingly wealthy!

How much did the teleportation formations in Stellar City bring in every year? It was unimaginable!

Five million divine crystals was an astronomical figure to others, but it might be nothing to the Shi Clan!

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright, I’ll go there to get it.”

Yang Ye naturally had an urgent need for divine crystals. Regardless of whether it was the Sword Alliance or Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region, both of them needed a huge number of divine crystals. Ye Liuyun could do a lot with five million divine crystals.

Shi Tian smiled, “I still don’t know your name!”

Yang Ye didn’t hide it from Shi Tian, “Yang Ye!”

“Yang Ye?” Shi Tian blinked, “That sword cultivator, Yang Ye?”

Yang Ye nodded, “You’ve heard of me?”

Shi Tian had quite an unusual expression on his face, “It’s actually you!”

Yang Ye asked, “What?” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Shi Tian replied, “Did you offend that little devil in our large world? Right, the Divine Phoenix Clan’s Mo Xiaoleng?”

Mo Xiaoleng! Yang Ye nodded, “I do have some enmity with her!”

Shi Tian shook his head, “Brother, you could have offended anyone, but you just had to offend her. That little devil is really difficult to deal with. Do you know why I know your name? Because she has been telling everyone in the large world that she will give one of her divine flames to us if we kill you. Moreover, we can even cultivate in the Divine Phoenix Clan’s divine grounds of cultivation, Divine Spirit Cave! Besides that, she has named many other tempting rewards. Moreover, she seems to be adding more....”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. She’s really desperate to get me killed!

“However, no one is accepting her request!” Meanwhile, Shi Tian added, “Because that little devil has never kept her word. Even though her promises are tempting to the point that even I’m tempted, we’re very well aware that she’s very likely to be tricking us. It’s not easy to get down here from the large world, so what if she doesn’t keep her word after we kill you? Wouldn’t we have done all of that for nothing? In any case, regardless of whether she does keep her word, we can’t do anything to her!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he gazed at Yang Ye and sized him up, “Actually, I’m lucky that I didn’t agree to her request. Brother, you’re not ordinary at all. You were able to get here, and you’re even just a Voider.... No wonder that little devil promised such tempting rewards. She knew that it’s difficult to kill you!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Are there many geniuses in the large world?”

Shi Tian replied, “Quite a huge amount!”

Yang Ye asked, “How’s your strength up there?”

Shi Tian thought for a moment and replied, “Not bad. There’s quite a gap between me and those top geniuses. In overall, I’m high up in the middle class.

Yang Ye nodded. He’d gained a rough estimate of the strengths of the geniuses in the large world.

Meanwhile, Shi Tian suddenly asked, “Are you here to temper yourself?”

Yang Ye gazed at Shi Tian and replied with a question, “You’re here to temper yourself?”

Shi Tian shook his head, “I came down here to deal with some business. I heard this place is very dangerous, so I decided to come and have a look. Dammit! I almost lost my life on numerous occasions! If I didn’t have quite a few treasures and things to rely on, I would have died by now. No wonder my grandfather prohibited me from coming here....”

He’s here to temper himself! The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. He’s really great! He actually treated the Ominous Territory as a place to temper himself!

Meanwhile, Shi Tian patted Yang Ye on the shoulder, “It was all thanks to you that I’m alive. I’ve finished all my life-saving treasures, and if it wasn’t for you, I would have really died here. I, Shi Tian, will never forget this!”

Yang Ye’s impression of Shi Tian grew slightly better. Because he could sense that Shi Tian was being absolutely sincere when he spoke those words. Yang Ye shook his head, “I didn’t save you for nothing. I got five million divine crystals from you, so we don’t owe each other anything!”

“What are you talking about?!” Shi Tian was quite displeased, “Is my life only worth five million divine crystals? In short, I’ll never forget this kindness. If you get into trouble in the large world, then just use my name. There’s nothing in the large world that I, Shi Tian, can’t resolve!”

Yang Ye glanced at him and said, “If I cause trouble, then it might not be a minor matter.”

Shi Tian patted his chest and guaranteed, “No matter what it is, I’ll deal with it for you!”

Yang Ye thought for a while before he replied, “Alright, I’ll look for you if I cause trouble in the future!”

Shi Tian cracked a smile and said, “Alright. Right, this place is too dangerous. I’m heading back. What about you? Are you going to come with me?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I have something else to do. I’ll leave once I’m done!”

Shi Tian nodded, “You’re quite mysterious. You should be able to protect yourself here, but I don’t dare to stay longer. Brother Yang Ye, until next time.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he was about to leave, but Yang Ye suddenly asked, “How did you notice my presence just now?”

Shi Tian chuckled, “A family secret. I’ll tell you when we meet again. Take care!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he withdrew a scroll and crushed it, and then he transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye fell silent for a while, and then he shook his head, “He’s quite a nice guy!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he continued forward.

This time, Yang Ye sped up. He was quite impatient to get the Spring of Life now.

Around four hours later.

Splash!

The sound of water suddenly came from beneath Yang Ye’s feet. Yang Ye stopped, looked down, and saw water below him.

He hesitated for a moment and pushed his right hand forward, a wave of energy surged out and blasted the nearby miasma away.

At this moment, Yang Ye saw the surroundings clearly.

It was a river that stood before him. The water in it was very clear, yet it seemed like a dead river that wasn’t flowing at all.

Yang Ye fell silent for an instant, and he was just about to continue forward when he seemed to have suddenly thought of something, and it caused his hairs to stand on end!

A river!

This isn’t Yellow Springs River, right?!
