Chapter 666 – Regret!

“Yang Ye! Don’t you dare!” Yin Xuan’er roared furiously.

Yang Ye stopped moving and said, “Miss Yin, I’ll give you one last chance out of consideration for the relationship we had in the past. Otherwise, I’ll do as I’ve said.” Not to mention slaughtering the royal family of the northern territory and the Treant Clan, he would even attack the Hallowed Grounds without the slightest hesitation for An Nanjing.

Shu Xin’s face had turned ghastly pale while terror filled her eyes. She might be doubtful if it was anyone else who spoke these words, but she absolutely believed it when it was Yang Ye. After all, if this man before her was enraged, then he would be a complete and utter god of death.

She hurriedly spoke before Yin Xuan’er could speak, “Young Master Yang, my Treant Clan is willing to give you the Life Water!”

Yin Xuan’er stared fixedly at Yang Ye while her peerlessly beautiful face seemed slightly savage from the rage she experienced.

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Thank you!”

Shu Xin heaved a sigh of relief, and then she formed a seal with both hands before a ray of green light surged out from within her. After that, a dark green drop of liquid appeared before Yang Ye.

The dark green drop of liquid had vanished as soon as it appeared, and Yang Ye vanished as well.

Yin Xuan’er was still angry, but Shu Xin had heaved a huge sigh of relief. Because she felt that Yang Ye was really quite terrifying when he was angry. Of course, she was clearly aware why Yang Ye treated them like that. Yang Ye’s attitude towards both of them was very good in the past, and the reason he’d acted so mercilessly was probably because her Treat Clan had abandoned the southern territory in the face of danger.

Shu Xin knew that the Treant Clan’s decision was wrong. Not only was the Treant Clan’s decision wrong, Yin Xuan’er and the northern territory made the wrong decision as well. The northern territory shouldn’t have stood by idly and watched the battle when the southern territory faced the Hallowed Grounds. Now that the Hallowed Grounds had been repulsed, the northern territory had immediately come over to conduct negotiations instead. So, not to mention Yang Ye, even she would feel quite displeased by that.

“Miss Yin, are you going to stay or leave right now?” An Biru took up a teacup from the table and took a light sip before she spoke flatly.

Yin Xuan’er forced herself to calm down, and then she gazed at An Biru and said, “Madam An, should I call you Madam An or Madam Yang now?”

An Biru’s hand stiffened slightly, and then she grinned and said, “Miss Yin, your tone is really quite sour!”

Yin Xuan’er laughed coldly yet didn’t speak.

An Biru said, “Miss Yin, you’re a smart person, and it’s obvious from how you approached Yang Ye and tried to draw him over to your side. Unfortunately, both of us lack Ding Shaoyao’s courage. She dared to bet her entire clan on Yang Ye, and she was able to never abandon him no matter the danger they faced. So, she’d one of the people Yang Ye trusts the most, and she’s the one with authority in the southern territory that’s only second to Yang Ye. She deserves that!”

When she spoke up to this point, An Biru paused for a moment and continued, “But what about you, Miss Yin? You helped Yang Ye, but did he not help you as well? Moreover, the northern territory did send people to contact us in the past, but what about after that? The northern territory stopped mentioning anything about an alliance once the Hallowed Grounds and Exalted Han Empire launched large scale attacks against the southern territory. No one is stupid, don’t you think?”

Yin Xuan’er’s expression was quite unsightly. She’d suggested that the northern territory should dispatch experts to assist Yang Ye. However, the seniors of the northern territory rejected her suggestion because they felt that it was best to allow the southern territory, Hallowed Grounds, and Exalted Han Empire to exhaust each other’s strength. Moreover, the entire northern territory felt that the southern territory had no chance at victory. So, dispatching forces to assist it would be no different than sending those forces to their deaths!

Actually, it wasn’t just the other members of the northern territory, even she felt that the southern territory had no chance at victory. Because the forces of the Hallowed Grounds and Exalted Han Empire were truly too numerous, and they were extremely terrifying. But no one had expected that the Half-Saint of the southern territory would actually be so formidable to the point of even successively slaughtering a few Half-Saints from the Hallowed Grounds....

Yin Xuan’er knew that the northern territory had made a wrong decision.

She’d actually come here today to make amends. However, she’d underestimated Yang Ye’s feelings for An Nanjing. In his heart, that woman called An Nanjing was far more important to her, or it could be said that she couldn’t be compared with An Nanjing at all!

An Biru said, “Miss Yin, you made a huge mistake this time, and it was using An Nanjing to threaten Yang Ye. You should have been very clearly aware that he’s one who doesn’t respond well to threats, so threatening him would only make him become hostile and fight back. If I were you, I wouldn’t have spoken about forming an alliance, and I would have said that I’d come specially to give An Nanjing the Life Water. I presume the outcome would have been very different if you did that.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Yin Xuan’er laughed bitterly and said, “Is there no way to turn the situation around?” The northern territory was the fruit of the painstaking effort of her, the Grand Preceptor, and countless loyal members of the Shang Dynasty. Not to mention that the Grand Preceptor and the others wouldn’t be willing to give it up just like that, even she wouldn’t!

An Biru stood up and said, “Miss Yin, you’ve been blinded from being too involved with it all. Take a proper look at the situation. The demon race has formed an alliance with our southern territory, and it won’t take long for the Exalted Han Empire to be defeated. At that time, the entire human race would almost be completely unified, so would anyone throughout the continent still be a match for our forces? Not to mention the northern territory, even the devil race and oceanic clans would only face death if they refuse to yield!”

Yin Xuan’er was shocked, “Yang Ye intends to unify the continent?”

An Biru answered, “The defiant profounders are about to emerge from the seal, and I’m sure you’re aware of how strong they are. Besides the defiant profounders, there’s the Hallowed Grounds as well. The only way our continent can protect itself is by joining forces. You should be very well aware of Yang Ye’s character. He would absolutely not allow any force on the continent to have a chance at stabbing him in the back. So, all the clans and forces on the continent that aren’t our friends are our enemies.”

As she spoke, An Biru had walked to the door. She knew very well what decision Yin Xuan’er had to make. No, it should be said that Yin Xuan’er and the entire northern territory didn’t have a choice at all.

At this moment, Yang Ye and the southern territory possessed absolute strength!

“Xuan’er, what should we do?” asked Shu Xin. She hadn’t expected that not only had she lost a drop of Life Water during this trip to the southern territory, the problem they came to solve hadn’t been resolved as well. She truly felt like they’d suffered a huge loss during this trip!

Yin Xuan’er fell silent for a short while, and then she said, “We’re going back to the northern territory!”

She walked out of the room while she spoke those words....

...

Within the Primordial Pagoda.

An Nanjing was lying on a bed in one of the rooms here. Even though she was no different than a cripple now, there was no gloominess on her face, and there was only calmness there.

It wasn’t long before Yang Ye arrived in this room.

After he arrived here, Xiao Yuxi and Su Qingshi who were taking care of An Nanjing exchanged glances before leaving the room.

An Nanjing said, “You’re here!”
