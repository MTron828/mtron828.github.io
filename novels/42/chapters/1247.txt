Chapter 1248 – A Peak Battle!

As soon as Yang Ye’s sword intent appeared, a strand of terrifying sword intent crashed down upon Yang Ye and Yun Banqing like an avalanche.

Rebirth Rank sword intent!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly as he took a step forward, and a strand of sword intent appeared out of thin air before him. It formed an invisible wall that obstructed the sword intent that was crashing down towards him.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded from the collision, and the space around them even started rippling violently like it was boiling.

Moreover, Yang Ye had been pushed almost 10 steps back during the collision.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed as he said, “Stand behind me!”

Yun Banqing’s figure flashed behind Yang Ye. She clenched her fists as she gazed at his back, and there was a trace of worry in her eyes.

The 2 strands of sword intent were still fighting each other in front of Yang Ye while space rippled incessantly. It was a shocking sight.

A wisp of ferocity flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes as he took a step forward before sword intent swept out from him.

Bang!

Crack!

Along with a loud explosion, the space around Yang Ye and Yun Banqing cracked apart. At the same time, the sword intent in the air vanished.

Suddenly, an intent sword shot through the sky from afar!

Even though it was just a sword, it felt like a mountain crashing down upon them, and even Yang Ye couldn’t help but feel suffocated by its aura!

Yang Ye didn’t dare act careless. He flicked a similar intent sword forward, and it collided with the other intent sword.

A sharp sword howl resounded through the air, but Yang Ye’s expression changed instead. Because his intent sword had actually cracked apart, and it seemed like it would shatter at any moment. As for the other intent sword, it was still completely intact!

Yang Ye’s heart sank slightly.

Bang!

Meanwhile, his intent sword suddenly shattered, and then the other intent sword emanated a terrifying pressure as it shot towards him like a bolt of lightning. It was extremely swift and had practically instantly arrived in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye pressed his right index and middle fingers together to form a sword, and then he tapped them forward.

Om!

The intent sword collided with his fingers, and then another sword howl resounded. Yang Ye was pushed back repeatedly once again while the intent sword was constantly pressing against his fingers. It seemed like it desired to pierce through his fingers!

“Stop!” As soon as he spoke, Yang Ye stomped his right foot against the ground and stopped on the spot. But his hand bent slightly. A moment later, a wisp of ferociousness flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes as he moved his hand slightly to the side, and then he moved his hand forward and grabbed the hilt of the intent sword. At the moment he grabbed onto its hilt, the intent sword started trembling madly with the intention of struggling free from his grasp.

Yang Ye grabbed the intent sword’s hilt with his left hand as well, and then Rebirth Rank sword intent started surging out incessantly from him to suppress the intent sword.

Bang!

A long time later, the sword suddenly shattered into pieces while Yang Ye was pushed back repeatedly.

Once he finally stopped himself, Yun Banqing hurriedly walked forward, and her expression instantly changed upon catching sight of his hands. At this moment, Yang Ye’s hands were mangled, and his arms were even covered in fine cracks that stretched through them like a spiderweb while blood seeped out incessantly from the cracks.

Yun Banqing was stunned for a moment before she withdrew a silk handkerchief with the intention of wrapping his wounds, but Yang Ye stopped her, “It’s fine!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye sent the violet energy within him to his arms and his injuries started to heal slowly.

Yang Ye remained silent as he gazed at his hands.

While it was both Rebirth Rank sword intent, he could be said to have been completely crushed!

There was a gap!

Even though both his sword intent and Jian Wuji’s sword intent were at the Rebirth Rank, there was still quite a gap between them. Yang Ye thought for a while before he came to an understanding. Jian Wuji’s Rebirth Rank sword intent was at the peak of the Rebirth Rank, at the very least. Moreover, it might have even arrived above the Rebirth Rank. But he’d just attained the Rebirth Rank, so it was normal for there to be a gap between them!

Once he figured it out, Yang Ye stopped being conflicted about it. He gazed at Yun Banqing whose eyes were filled with worry, and he smiled, “It’s fine. Just these injuries are just minor injuries to me!”

Yun Banqing glanced at him and nodded slightly.

Yang Ye looked up towards the distance, “Let’s continue! I’m getting more and more curious about what lies ahead!”

Just like that, they continued forward. This time, they didn’t encounter any sword formations around them, and it was extremely smooth all along the way.

It didn’t take long for them to walk out of the ruins. There was a palace just 3km ahead of them. It was extremely huge and simply seemed like a small city. Yang Ye noticed that the entire palace was built from numerous arm-length swords. As for the sky above the palace, there were over 10,000 swords circling the air there according to some sort of pattern. Besides that, there were swords flashing through the area around the palace as well!

All of these swords were at the Quasi Emperor Rank!

Yun Banqing spoke softly, “This is the Sword God’s Palace through was renowned throughout Dark Hell Continent?”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “It should be!”

As he spoke, Yang Ye walked forward. Meanwhile, Yun Banqing hurriedly moved forward, “I don’t think it’s that simple!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I know. However, I’m already here. Are you telling me that I should head back?”

“Right!” She continued, “But you have to be careful!”

“Of course!” Yang Ye nodded, and they both sped up. It didn’t take long for them to arrive before the entrance of the palace. There were 3 characters inscribed above the entrance ‘剑神宫’.

As he gazed at the name, Sword God’s Palace that was inscribed above the entrance, Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment before he raised his hand and pushed the door. However, a ray of light suddenly flashed out from above the door, and it shot towards him and Yun Banqing.

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly. He pulled Yun Banqing behind him, clenched his right hand into a fist, and then slammed it forward.

Bang!

The light dispersed, and then both Yang Ye and Yun Banqing were pushed backwards.

Yang Ye glanced at his fist, and there were over a dozen bloody marks on them. Suddenly, the swords that were circling the air above the palace stopped moving.

Yang Ye’s expression changed when he noticed this, and he intended to take Yun Banqing with him and leave. However, it was too late. The swords in the sky suddenly shot down towards him, and it was like a dense storm that couldn’t be avoided!

All of these swords were imbued with Rebirth Rank sword intent!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he suddenly stomped his right foot against the ground. Rebirth Rank sword intent suddenly appeared in the sky and swept towards those swords.

After Yang Ye’s Rebirth Rank sword intent appeared in the air, the swords in the sky were instantly obstructed. But Yang Ye’s body bent down. All of those swords were at the Quasi Emperor Rank, and they were imbued with Rebirth Rank sword intent. So, how terrifying was their strength? Even Yang Ye’s Rebirth Rank sword intent and body at the Divine Shift Realm couldn’t endure the pressure they placed upon him!

Om!

Meanwhile, a huge circle of light appeared in the sky. The swords started to tremble violently, and then rays of light surged out incessantly from them and slammed against the barrier created from Yang Ye’s sword intent.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded as the barrier shattered into pieces, and then the over 10,000 swords in the sky instantly descended to the ground like a mountain.

Yun Banqing’s expression changed, and her hands couldn’t help but tremble.

“Fuck off!” A furious howl resounded, and then a pillar of blood shot up into the sky. Everywhere it passed, the light was instantly dispersed. At the same time, a blood red ray of light swept up from below.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The 10,000 rays of light in the sky were instantly blasted apart by the blood red ray of light. However, the circle of light in the sky suddenly shook violently, and then those swords in the sky converged together and formed a huge sword that stretched through the sky. Once the huge sword formed in the sky, the space in the sky warped!

A vicious glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes when he saw the huge sword. A moment later, Yang Ye stomped his right foot against the ground, and he transformed into a ray of blood red light that shot up into the sky.

Meanwhile, the huge sword started to descend.

Yun Banqing watched nervously as the blood red ray of light and the huge sword slammed against each other.

Bang!

The blood red ray of light dispersed, and the huge sword exploded apart. Countless swords shot towards the surroundings. At the same time, the circle of light in the sky cracked apart as well. However, it didn’t vanish, and it didn’t take long for another sword howl to resound from the circle of light. As soon as the sword howl resounded, the swords that Yang Ye blasted apart earlier had instantly converged together once more.

Yun Banqing hurriedly shouted, “That circle of light is a sword formation, and it has to be destroyed! Otherwise, it’ll never end!”

Yang Ye turned around to glance at Yun Banqing. Her heart and mind shook when she saw Yang Ye’s eyes that seemed to hold oceans of blood in them, and she couldn’t help but take around 10 steps back.

Fortunately, it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to look up once more, and then he pressed his sword against the center of his forehead. A moment later, his figure vanished on the spot.

Yun Banqing was stunned and hurriedly looked up.

Bang!

A brilliant ray of light and dazzling ray of red light erupted in the sky, and they drowned Yang Ye beneath their radiance.

Meanwhile, Yun Banqing stared fixedly at the sky while her hands were trembling incessantly.

Om!

After a long moment of silence, a sword howl suddenly resounded in the sky, and then an explosion resounded as the circle of light in the sky shattered apart.

Countless rays of sword energy shot swept through the sky, and even space was torn apart before them. In an instant, the entire sky was covered in cracks, and it was an extremely shocking sight!

A ray of blood red light shot down from the sky, and Yun Banqing quickly ran over to it. But she hadn’t even come close when baleful energy and slaughter intent blasted her away.

Yun Banqing stood up and gazed at Yang Ye who was covered in a blood red glow, and her eyes were filled with anxiety.

A long time passed before the blood red light dispersed, and then Yang Ye appeared before Yun Banqing’s eyes. Yang Ye gazed at her and grinned, and she immediately heaved a sigh of relief.

She quickly went over to Yang Ye’s side. At this moment, there weren’t any injuries on Yang Ye’s body, but he was slightly exhausted and was practically unable to stand properly.

Yun Banqing supported Yang Ye’s body and was about to speak when the door to the palace suddenly opened up. At the same time, a voice came from within the palace, “As expected of you! Yang Ye! Come in, I’ve been waiting a long time for you.”

Yang Ye was stunned when he heard this.
