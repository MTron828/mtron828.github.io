Chapter 2374 – Myriad Immortal Sect!

A corpse was floating not too far ahead of them.

It was the corpse of a man, and he seemed around the age of thirty. He wore a white robe and had a spear stabbed through his chest. Besides that, a soul was floating by the corpse.

It was the man’s soul!

His body and soul had been separated!

At this moment, the soul was looking at Yang Ye and Nanli Meng with a trace of surprise but even more bewilderment in its eyes.

As for Snowy, Erya, and Oxxy, he’d sent them into the Primordial Pagoda.

Meanwhile, the soul suddenly asked, “Did you see that old man?”

Yang Ye asked, “Old man?”

The man said, “The old man with a bamboo chest on his back.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I did.”

The man replied, “I did too.”

Yang Ye glanced at him, “What a coincidence.”

The man shook his head slightly, “Leave. This isn’t a place you should be.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “Is it very dangerous?”

The man nodded, “It’s dangerous to you!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, the man suddenly asked, “How’s the outside world?”

Yang Ye replied, “Which one are you talking about?”

The man said, “The Eternal Universe!”

Yang Ye and Nanli Meng exchanged glances. In the end, Yang Ye said, “I don’t know. Most people aren’t able to get there.”

The man closed his eyes slowly. A long time passed before he glanced at the surroundings and said, “This battlefield is huge, extremely huge, and many died here. Not just humans, there are other living beings too. Many existences did not vanish after their death, just like me. There are some whose resentment still lingers. Besides that, some even survived completely. Perhaps these survivors were very weak in the past, but none are weak now.”

Nanli Meng suddenly asked, “Why don’t they go outside?”

“Outside?” The man shook his head, “The outside world isn’t as safe as this place.”

He pointed behind himself and said, “There’s a forest over there. A powerful figure fell there, so you can try your luck over there. But don’t go beyond the forest. Your strength isn’t sufficient to go there.”

The man closed his eyes once he finished speaking.

Meanwhile, Nanli Meng suddenly said, “Can you reveal what happened during the Primal Era? For example, information about that battle?”

The man glanced at her, “It’s meaningless, isn’t it?”

She smiled, “I’m just quite curious.”

The man fell silent for a short while and said, “When it comes to cultivation, humans, demons, and all others cultivate. But what’s most important when you cultivate? Resources. The longer you live, the more indifferent you get toward things, and as time passes, you’re the only person left in your world. So, for the sake of even better resources, they are able to stop at nothing. However, it is impossible to avoid. If you don’t fight for it, you’ll die. So, there is no good or bad in this cruel world, there is only strong and weak.”

He gazed at them and continued, “That battle caused the fall of an era. As for the secrets of it, finding out will not do you any good.”

Nanli Meng wished to ask more, but Yang Ye shook his head at her. He gazed at the man, hesitated for a moment, and said, “Senior, your body is here, and your soul is complete. Why don’t you enter your body?”

The man pointed at the spear in his body, “If I hadn’t reacted swiftly and left it in the form of my soul, I would have died the moment that spear stabbed me. As for why I don’t enter my body again, it’s because that spear is suppressing my body.”

“Then just pull it out!” said Yang Ye. He regretted his words as soon as he said that. It was quite stupid. Because if it was possible, the man would have done so by now.

The man suddenly chuckled, “I’ve been waiting here for thousands of years, and I’ve only met two capable of pulling out this spear. The first was a sword cultivator who arrived here not too long ago. He glanced at me and went to the forest. As for the second, it was the old man with the bamboo chest. He was willing to help, but I couldn’t accept his conditions, so he refused.”

“A sword cultivator?” Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Was he wearing a cloud white robe?”

The man nodded, “You know him?”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Sort of!”

The man spoke softly, “He’s very strong.”

Suddenly, Snowy emerged from Yang Ye’s chest. The man was stunned when he saw her. Obviously, he’d recognized Snowy.

Meanwhile, Snowy’s gaze fell on the spear in the man’s corpse. It was quite strange. Completely pitch black and extremely smooth like a mirror. Besides that, its tip was around two times longer than an ordinary spear.

Snowy’s eyes lit up from the sight of it, and then she went over and wrapped her arms around it. After that, she pulled it out! However, the spear was very long while her arms were quite short, so it was quite difficult for her to hold it. Thus, she patted it lightly, and the spear seemed to understand what she wanted. It instantly shrunk to a size she could hold!

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Nanli Meng glanced at Snowy with a strange expression on her face.

Meanwhile, the man’s hands trembled slightly. But the man’s face was very calm.

Snowy went over to Yang Ye with the spear, cracked a smile at him, and then passed it to him. Yang Ye glanced at the spear and took it, but he noticed to his shock that he couldn’t move it!

He couldn’t move it at all!

Yang Ye was quite shocked. How strong was he right now? But he couldn’t move the spear?

Meanwhile, the man suddenly said, “It’s normal. Even I can’t move that spear.”

Yang Ye gazed at the man, and the latter explained, “It has a spirit of its own, and only someone it acknowledges can move it.”

He gazed at Snowy and continued, “Of course, she’s an exception. Even this spear has to give a Sprite Progenitor face!”

Give Snowy face!

Yang Ye suddenly thought of something, and he joked, “Senior, how much face would things give her?”

How much?

The man glanced at Yang Ye and smiled, “A lot. It has been like that for all the Sprite Progenitors.”

Yang Ye smiled and didn’t ask more. He rubbed Snowy’s head and said, “Senior, your soul can fuse with your body now, right?”

The man nodded and said, “Young Brother, what is your name?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Yang Ye!”

The man said, “I’m Nan Yu, the master of the Myriad Immortal Sect. Of course, my sect doesn’t exist anymore.” He glanced at Snowy and continued, “I’ll remember this debt I owe you.”

Yang Ye smiled, “It was nothing. Right, can you leave this place now?”

The man shook his head, “I have to repair my body, and then merge my soul with it.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Then I won’t disturb you further.”

The man said, “Don’t forget that you must never cross that forest. It’s a forbidden area.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Thanks for the reminder!”

He took Snowy in his arms and walked off. Nanli Meng glanced at the man and followed Yang Ye.

Nan Yu glanced at Yang Ye and Nanli Meng’s figures, and then he moved his gaze away, “It shouldn’t be…”

There was slight hesitance in his eyes.

A long time passed before he restrained his thoughts and gazed at the body before him, “I hope it still works.”

…

Meanwhile, there was cold sweat on Yang Ye’s forehead.

Nanli Meng had a solemn expression on her face too.

Both of them stopped.

Nanli Meng spoke solemnly, “He’s a Three World Realm at least, and he may even be at the Four World Realm. Moreover, he may have been even stronger at his prime!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “He wanted to kill us just now!”

Nanli Meng nodded, “He wanted to kill you.”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “He gave up because of Snowy?”

She shook her head, “I’m not sure. But no matter why, he has used a different method, and it’s to become friends with you.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly and glanced at the surroundings. This place was much more dangerous than the outside world!

Nanli Meng suddenly asked, “Are you afraid?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “He asked us not to go past the forest. Do you think he told us that out of good intentions?”

Nanli Meng nodded, “Since he chose to be friends with you, then he won’t harm you. Otherwise, even if he were just a soul, his strength is still sufficient to kill you!”

“What about you?” Yang Ye gazed at her, “Can’t he kill you?”

Nanli Meng revealed a sly smile, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Forget it. Let’s go take a look at the forest.”

He sped up toward the distance.

Nanli Meng glanced at the man from before, and then she followed him.

It didn’t take long for them to arrive at the forest. It was huge, and every tree within it was extremely tall, even taller than a mountain! So, standing in the forest made them feel tiny.

Ancient trees blotted out the sky around them.

There was no gain without risk!

As far as Yang Ye was concerned, some danger was worth the risk. Since the ancient times, which expert had received fortuitous encounters that just fell out of the sky?

Fortune would never come to you!

Of course, Snowy was an exception. Fortune may come to that little fellow.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

According to Nan Yu, a great expert of the Primal Era perished in the forest. But what kind of expert was it?

Yang Ye couldn’t help but feel quite curious.

Suddenly, An Nanjing stopped. A short while later, she withdrew a leaf, and Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically, “You…”

She’d vanished completely before he could finish speaking.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye seemed to have sensed something, and a chill ran down his spine.
