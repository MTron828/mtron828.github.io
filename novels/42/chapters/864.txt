Chapter 865 – Comprehending The Laws Of Speed?

Actually, regardless of whether it was the Ancient Sword School or the Dao Order, both didn’t want a true war between the sects to break out. Because besides these 2 Platinum Rank sects, there was also the demon race in the prefecture.

Once they started killing each other, it would only benefit the demon race!

However, the matter couldn’t be let go just like that, and it was especially so for the Dao Order. After all, the Dao Order could be said to have been utterly humiliated by the Ancient Sword School, so if they were to let bygones be bygones, then how would the Dao Order maintain its foothold in the prefecture from now on?

So, if the Ancient Sword School made Yang Ye return, then the Dao Order would have no choice but to go to war with the Ancient Sword School!

Once that happened, the deaths on both sides would definitely rise to a horrifying degree!

Moreover, in Yang Ye’s opinion, if the Dao Order decided to go to war with the Ancient Sword School, then he would definitely be madly pursued by the Saint Realm expert of the Dao Order. He absolutely didn’t want to see that happen. So, he’d decided to go to the Dao Order himself. In that way, he could stop the Dao Order from going too far, and he could grab the right to decide how the situation unfolded!

Most importantly, he didn’t want more members of the Ancient Sword School to die because of him!

“Your body is very strong. But while that hammer suits you, it’s not a sword in the end, and it can’t help you bring forth your full strength....” Daoist Gu pondered deeply for a moment and said, “Give it to me. I’ll give it back to you in the morning!”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned and quite puzzled. Meanwhile, the old man on Daoist Gu’s left smiled, “What’re you still standing there for? You’re lucky, kid. Your master might not be very great when it comes to the Sword Dao, but he can be considered as the number one expert in sword forging throughout Pine Prefecture. The might of your hammer will be multiplied by at least a few times with him modifying it for you!”

Yang Ye quickly passed the Herculean Hammer to Daoist Gu when he heard this.

Daoist Gu held the Herculean Hammer for a while and sized it up, “It’s not bad. It can barely be considered to be a low-grade Immortal Rank treasure. It should be able to ascend to the mid-grade with a little bit of modification. Moreover, it should be comparable to a high-grade Immortal Rank sword to you. Rest well tonight and teach those fellows from the Dao Order a good lesson tomorrow. Let them know that our Ancient Sword Domain is the true strongest sect in the prefecture!”

Yang Ye glanced at Daoist Gu. There was a great amount of information hidden within the words that Daoist Gu had said. Especially when he asked Yang Ye to teach them a lesson. The meaning hidden behind these words that he wasn’t just going there to slap the Dao Order in the face, the main objective was to resolve the enmity between both sides and not form even more enmity with them. He naturally understood that as well, but he really couldn’t stop himself from killing sometimes.

Daoist Gu and the others told Yang Ye a few more things before they left.

Yang Ye had just descended to the ground when Daoist Gu’s disciple, Nalan Ying, obstructed his path, and both Fan Meng and Fan Li were behind her.

Nalan Ying had a very slender figure, and she could be said to be the slenderest woman he’d ever seen. But her appearance was only ordinary, but it wasn’t ugly.

Nalan Ying’s face turned cold when she saw Yang Ye, and she was just about to speak when Yang Ye spoke before her, “Senior Sister, I just happened to encounter some things which I need guidance for, so please provide me with your guidance!” He naturally knew that she was definitely very annoyed. After all, he’d done so much after pretending to be Daoist Gu’s disciple.

Senior Sister? Nalan Ying was slightly stunned and said, “Master took you as his disciple?”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Master said that I should ask Senior Sister about anything I need help with. Senior Sister, you wouldn’t refuse me, right?”

When she saw Yang Ye act so respectfully and sincerely, Nalan Ying who’d intended to look for trouble with him was at a slight loss for what to do.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye continued, “Senior Sister, you aren’t still angry, right?”

Nalan Ying hurriedly shook her head, “No, not at all....” After all, as a senior sister, she naturally couldn’t act so narrow-mindedly.

Yang Ye smiled and said, “That’s good. Oh, right. Master said that I could ask Senior Sister for anything I need. Err, I’m sure Senior Sister is aware that I used to be an independent cultivator, and I owe over 100,000 extreme-grade energy stones for the sake of cultivation. Err... err....” When he spoke up to this point, Yang Ye smiled with embarrassment and seemed as if he was too shy to continue.

“100,000 extreme-grade energy stones?” Nalan Ying waved her hand, and a spatial ring appeared before Yang Ye, “There are 200,000 extreme-grade energy stones in there. Take it as Senior Sister’s welcome gift. Junior Brother, you can come look for me if you need more in the future.”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he quickly took the spatial ring and spoke as if he was ‘overwhelmed by her kindness’, “Thank you, Senior Sister. Senior Sister is such a nice person....”

“There’s no need to thank me. Senior Sisters should take care of their junior brothers!” Nalan Ying spoke magnanimously.

“Of course, of course!” Yang Ye quickly nodded and displayed his agreement.

After he asked Nalan Ying a few questions about the Sword Dao, Yang Ye finally returned to his room. He noticed that while Nalan Ying’s strength might be inferior to his own, she did know much more about the Sword Dao. Especially when it came to some things, he hadn’t even heard of them in the past. In short, he’d gained quite a bit from his conversation with her!

On the other hand, Nalan Ying had a much better impression of Yang Ye when she saw him act so humbly and inquisitively. So, she even gave him another 100,000 extreme-grade energy stones.

...

Yang Ye sat cross-legged in his room when the door was suddenly pushed open, and then Fan Meng walked in. She immediately leaped over to Yang Ye and sized him up carefully. A short while passed before she grinned, “Yang Ye, you’re actually not ugly at all!”

“Do you prefer my old appearance or this one?” Yang Ye smiled.

She replied, “It just has to be you!”

“Why?” Yang Ye said, “I was very ugly in the past.”

She replied, “Would you still protect me if I become ugly one day?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “It has nothing to do with whether you’re ugly or beautiful!”

She gazed at him for a long time before she suddenly took a step forward and wrapped her hands around his head. After that, she lightly pecked his forehead, causing her face to flush red as she said, “It’s the same for me!” As soon as she finished speaking, she swiftly vanished from Yang Ye’s sight.

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he shook his head and chuckled. He was just about to cultivate when the door to his room was opened once more. He raised his head and saw Fan Li walking in.

After she walked in, she closed the door and started walking towards Yang Ye.

What are these sisters doing? Yang Ye gazed at her with a puzzled expression.

Once she arrived in front of Yang Ye, Fan Li suddenly stretched out her hands and undid her sash, and then her dress dropped to the ground. While she was still wearing her dudou, her proud peaks, and her pure white and supple body was visible before Yang Ye’s eyes. Yang Ye frowned and said, “What are you doing?”

She didn’t speak. She just placed her hand on the string which tied her dudou together and pulled it apart. Just like that, Fan Li’s figure was completely bare before him.

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She lowered her head and said, “Both Little Meng and I would be dead if it wasn’t for you. Even if we didn’t die, it would be a fate worse than death. We are probably unable to repay your kindness in this lifetime, and I don’t have anything that I can give you. The only thing I have is my body. Don’t worry, I’ve never been touched by another man!”

Yang Ye grabbed his blanket and walked over to her before covering her with it. Fan Li’s delicate body trembled slightly while a trace of sorrow appeared in her eyes, “You still hate me?”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “I did in the past, but during this period, I noticed that you’re actually not that detestable. Because your love for Fan Meng is real. If I placed myself in your shoes, and if someone of unknown background were to get close to my younger sister, then I might not even waste my breath on him and just end his life right there!”

Fan Li asked, “You disdain to touch me?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “I’m a man, a normal man. While you are a beautiful woman, a woman that can move the heart of any man.”

“Then why?” She continued, “Don’t worry. I’m doing it out of my own free will!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m a normal man, but I’m one who has principles. I refuse to take advantage of another’s weakness, and I disdain such actions. There are no feelings between us. So if anything were to occur between us, then I would have been irresponsible to you, and my wives. I already owe them a lot, and I don’t want them to experience even a shred of unhappiness!”

Yang Ye paused for a moment before he continued, “I know why you’re doing this, and all I want to say is that if you want to thank me, then there’s absolutely no need to do this. Because so long as I want to do something, then I never think about whether anyone would repay me for it. Conversely, if I don’t want to do something, then not to mention a woman, even a thousand drop dead gorgeous beauties lying before me wouldn’t be able to make me do it!”

She asked softly, “You have wives?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I came here to look for them!”

She glanced at him and said, “Being yours probably fills them with happiness!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she started wearing her clothes, and she didn’t even try to hide it from Yang Ye. After she finished, Fan Li walked over to Yang Ye and said, “Do you know? I’ve always felt very fortunate. I felt fortunate that I picked you up on the streets out of curiosity. But I’m also filled with regret. I regret treating you like that....” When she spoke up to this point, she moved closer to Yang Ye and lightly pecked Yang Ye’s forehead with her scarlet red lips, “I’m sorry....”

As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and walked out of his room.

As soon as Fan Li walked out of the room, a small and delicate figure leaped into her arms.

“Big Sister, you lost, you lost! He didn’t take advantage of you, and he didn’t take advantage of your moment of weakness.... You can’t make any other excuses to stop me now....”

“Who said he didn’t? He didn’t take advantage of my body, but my heart....”

...

In the room. Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground while both Nan Ketu and the black clothed man who Nan Ketu called Shadow were standing before him.

Around an hour passed before both of them were refined into Sword Servants.

“The Laws of Speed? If I’m able to comprehend it, then....” Yang Ye’s soft muttering could be heard within the room.
