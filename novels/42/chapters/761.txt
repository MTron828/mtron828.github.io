It isn’t moving?I can’t pull it out?

What the fuck?

Yang Ye lowered his head to look at the sword he held, and he couldn’t help but curse. He couldn’t pull it out from the pagoda earlier because of the seal, but it didn’t make sense for him to be unable to do so now!

Yang Ye couldn’t figure it out no matter how he racked his brains!

On the other hand, the experts from the Fire Spirit Race were stunned. They could be said to have been fully on guard when Yang Ye was about to draw his sword. Because while Yang Ye was only at the fourth rank of the Monarch Realm, they were clearly aware that he couldn’t be judged by convention at all. But they never imagined that he would actually not draw his sword....

“Yang Ye, are you trying to insult us?” Qian Yan gazed ferociously at Yang Ye and was about to attack. However, his eyelids twitched, and he stepped back once more because Yang Ye had grasped the hilt of his sword again and was trying to draw it once more....

He still vividly remembered how powerful Yang Ye’s sword technique was, so he didn’t dare act carelessly in the slightest.

This time, Yang Ye utilized his entire physical strength. The sword moved slightly, and it delighted Yang Ye. So, he continued using all his strength, and it rose half a centimeter. However, Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically because the clothes that covered his right arm had shattered apart and burnt into ashes. Moreover, his entire right arm had cracked apart while blood sprayed out from within it.

Yang Ye was horrified, and he hurriedly pushed the sword back into the sheath. He didn’t doubt that his entire arm would shatter into bits if he were to continue drawing it!

On the other hand, the experts of the Fire Spirit Race were stunned. Obviously, they hadn’t expected that Yang Ye’s arm would have actually cracked apart while he tried to draw his sword....

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly raised his head to glance at them, and he said, “Next time... next time I’ll let all of you witness the true Heavenrend!” Yang Ye immediately stomped his right foot against the ground, and then his figure transformed into a ray of light that shot towards the distance. Merely an instant passed before he vanished from their fields of vision.

“Get him!” The experts of the Fire Spirit Race immediately recovered from their shock when they saw Yang Ye flee, and they flashed off in pursuit of him.

As he flew through the air, Yang Ye’s brows knit tightly together as he gazed at the sheathed sword in his grasp. It shouldn’t have been like that. How could I have been unable to draw it? Could it be the Sword Spirit? That isn’t very likely. Right, the Sword Spirit!

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly when he thought of the Sword Spirit. Because logically speaking, the Sword Spirit should have recovered once he got the Sword Precursor, but she still hadn’t shown herself until now. Moreover, he noticed that he was actually unable to contact her right now!

What exactly happened to her?

Suddenly, the Patriarch of the Fire Spirit Race appeared in front of him and interrupted his thoughts.

“Yang Ye, do you know how long I’ve been looking for you?” He gazed at Yang Ye with a gloomy expression on his face, “I’ve been utilizing my divine sense to search an area of a few tens of thousands of kilometers around the city every single day just to find you. Unfortunately, it was like you’d evaporated into thin air after that day. Fortunately, good things come to those who wait. I detected your sword intent today! I’ll never forget the aura of your sword intent.”

He could be said to have committed sins against his race by allowing the Fire Spirit Race to be destroyed. Moreover, after the Fire Spirit Race was destroyed and they were forced to seek refuge from the Hallowed Halls, everything his race had encountered truly infuriated him. Because all of it had been caused by Yang Ye, and that was why he searched for Yang Ye at all times.

Yang Ye glanced towards the north. He couldn’t see the Ancient City of Hallows anymore. In other words, he was at least a few tens of thousands of kilometers away from the city.

“Yang Ye, you won’t be able to escape this time!” Qian Yan and the others had arrived as well. This time, the 11 Half-Saints in their group stood in various different directions to obstruct Yang Ye’s paths of retreat.

“Who said anything about escaping?” Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “Since all of you intend to court death today, then how could I not fulfil your wishes?” Yang Ye waved his right hand while he spoke, and 11 Half-Saints appeared here. Meanwhile, Yang Ye immediately withdrew the Stone of Suppression, and it instantly made their cultivations drop from the Half-Saint Realm to the Monarch Realm.

“11 Half-Saints.... One is a mid-grade Half-Saint. How could this be possible?” All of them gazed at this scene before them with disbelief. My god! 11 Half-Saints, and one of them is even a mid-grade Half-Saint! How could this be possible? How could this be possible?

“Leave! Everyone retreat and seek assistance from the Hallowed Halls!” The patriarch of the Fire Spirit Race was the first to recover from his shock. At this moment, he was very clearly aware that they were definitely incapable of killing these 11 Half-Saints while their cultivations were suppressed. So, he hadn’t hesitated to order a retreat. Unfortunately, Yang Ye refused to let that happen, and a golden barrier of light suddenly appeared around them!

The golden barrier of light was a Heaven Grade barrier created by the barrier flags he obtained from Man Yuan. Even though it consumed a very terrifying amount of extreme-grade energy stones, it would be worth it if he could kill all of these Half-Saints from the Fire Spirit Race!

“Kill!” As soon as Yang Ye spoke, the 11 Sword Servants charged madly towards the experts from the Fire Spirit Race. Meanwhile, Yang Ye withdrew a Heaven Rank sword and aimed it at one of the Half-Saints before executing his strongest attack....

They were suppressed. From the moment the battle began, every single Half-Saint from the Fire Spirit Race was completely suppressed. Their cultivations had been suppressed by the Stone of Suppression while Yang Ye’s sword intent suppressed them further, so regardless of whether it was their speed or reaction time, it couldn’t compare to Yang Ye and the Half-Saint Sword Servants. That was exactly why they immediately fell into an absolutely disadvantageous position when the battle began.

Hiss!

A ray of light flashed, and then the body of a Half-Saint from the Fire Spirit Race stiffened on the spot. A fist sized hole had appeared on his chest.

As soon as that Half-Saint died, Yang Ye waved his right hand and immediately transported the corpse into the Primordial Pagoda. Next, both he and the Half-Saint Sword Servant who was fighting that expert charged towards the next Half-Saint from the Fire Spirit Race. This time, it was 3 against 1. 2 Half-Saint Sword Servants kept that expert busy while Yang Ye’s sword pierced through that Half-Saint’s chest with absolute ease!

After that, it was 4 against 1....

5 against 1....

...

In next to no time, only 3 remained. The Fire Spirit Race’s patriarch, Qian Yan, and Tong Fen. This time, 9 Half-Saint Sword Servants surrounded the patriarch of the Fire Spirit Race while the last 2 kept Qian Yan and Tong Fen busy.

At this moment, their faces were filled with despair because the Fire Spirit Race had truly been annihilated this time. After all, once they were gone, then the remaining members of their race who resided in the Ancient City of Hallows would be like sheep who were at the mercy of others. Once the defiant profounders emerged from the seal, they would absolutely be unable to survive as there was no one left to protect them.

The patriarch of the Fire Spirit Race was truly filled with despair and regret right now. If he had killed Qian Yan that day and let Yang Ye live, then the Fire Spirit Race wouldn’t have been destroyed, and he wouldn’t have to die right now. After all, sacrificing Qian Yan alone could have given the Fire Spirit Race peace.... Unfortunately, he’d chosen to kill Yang Ye that day!

Not to mention what happened in the past, if he hadn’t come to pursue Yang Ye today, then the remaining Half-Saints of the Fire Spirit Race wouldn’t have been annihilated!

At this moment, the patriarch of the Fire Spirit Race, Qian Yan, and Tong Feng were all covered in injuries, and they were bound to be defeated and killed.

Yang Ye gazed at Qian Yan and said, “Do you know why I’ve kept you alive until now? Because I felt that I would truly be letting off too easily if I were to just kill you. I’ll make you pay a horrible and unforgettable price for killing Xiao Man!” Yang Ye couldn’t help but surge with ferocious killing intent when he thought of Xiao Man. It was a scar that would stay with him forever!

“Yang Ye, you want me to beg you for mercy? Hahaha!” Qian Yan roared like a madman, “Do you think that I would beg for mercy from you? Dream on! I only regret not risking everything to kill you that day and leaving such a calamity alive. But it’s fine because you won’t survive for long even if I die. The Hallowed Halls won’t let you go! Hahaha!”

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Four rays of light flashed, and then a shrill cry resounded from Qian Yan as 4 swords nailed him on the ground. Yang Ye flashed over to Qian Yan, stomped on Qian Yan’s chest with his right foot, and said, “Didn’t you intend to extract my soul and place it deep beneath the ground to be burned alive? Unfortunately, you couldn’t do it. But it’s fine because I’ll allow you to experience it yourself!” As he spoke, Yang Ye pressed his hand against Qian Yan’s head, and then a powerful suction force surged out from his palm.

“AHHH!!!” Qian Yan instantly let out a shrill cry....

It wasn’t long before Yang Ye had extracted Qian Yan’s soul by force. The pain from such an experience was simply impossible to describe with words, and it was to the extent that the face on Qian Yan’s corpse had warped severely.

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath at all. He immediately tossed Qian Yan’s soul to a Sword Servant, and that Sword Servant flashed into the ground and tunneled his way deep into the ground.

“It’s time to end this!” Yang Ye flipped his palm, and his sword emanated a dazzling glow as it shot towards the patriarch of the Fire Spirit Race who was persisting bitterly in battle. He was almost completely exhausted, so Yang Ye’s sword pierced through his chest without experiencing much difficulty.

A mid-grade Half-Saint perished just like that!

The patriarch of the Fire Spirit Race stared fixedly at Yang Ye with a gaze that was filled with resentment, and it remained like that until the moment he took his last breath.

Yang Ye put the corpse away, and then he looked at Tong Fen and said, “You can leave!”

“Why?” asked Tong Fen in a low voice.

“If Xiao Man was still alive, she would absolutely not want me to kill her grandfather. You should be grateful that you had a granddaughter!” Yang Ye glanced coldly at him before turning around and leaving.

Tong Fen watched Yang Ye leave, and he stood silently on the spot for a short while before he turned around and left.

After traveling a certain distance, Yang Ye suddenly stopped moving. Meanwhile, the ancient sheath in his grasp suddenly trembled violently before a ray of light flashed, and the Sword Spirit appeared in front of him.

However, the Sword Spirit was slightly different than before. She wore a dark red dress and had an extremely cold expression on her face. Moreover, her eyes were filled with viciousness and killing intent.

Yang Ye frowned. Suddenly, the Sword Spirit pressed her fingers together to form a sword, and she pointed her fingers at Yang Ye.

In an instant, a myriad of strands of sword energy shot towards him.

Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically!
