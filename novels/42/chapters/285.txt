Chapter 286 – Dispelling The Poison

After she glanced at the four talismans in her hand with a complicated expression, Liu Weiwei sighed and said, “Brother Yang, will you really not give it any more consideration?”

She really didn’t want to give up. Because if Yang Ye joined the Heavenly Sword Sect with the potential and natural talent he possessed, then it would be good for both the sect and Yang Ye!

Yang Ye shook his head and refused once more. If he’d rescued his mother, then perhaps he would take his mother to another territory with him. However, his mother was still confined in the Flower Palace, so he would absolutely not head to another territory.

A wisp of disappointment flashed through her eyes when she saw Yang Ye refuse once more, and then she said, “No matter what, I still hope that Brother Yang can reconsider. If Brother Yang comes around in the future and is willing to head to the northern territory, then you can come looking for me at the Ancient Battlefield!”

Yang Ye smiled and didn’t refuse again.

“Yang Ye, you’re heading to the Ancient Battlefield as well. Since it’s like that, then let’s go together!” Meanwhile, Cai Yanyan spoke abruptly.

Liu Weiwei gazed at him as well.

Yang Ye glanced at Leng Jun who was still twitching on the ground, and then he shook his head and said, “Both of you go on first. I still have matters to deal with!”

Liu Weiwei nodded and said, “Then we’ll meet at the Ancient Battlefield!”

“Alright!” said Yang Ye with a smile on his face.

After Liu Weiwei and Cai Yanyan left, Yang Ye turned around to gaze at Leng Jun who was still twitching on the ground. At this moment, even though Leng Jun’s body was still twitching, his eyes were open. However, his eyes were filled with resentment and strong fear. Obviously, he wished for nothing more than to eat Yang Ye’s flesh and drink Yang Ye’s blood right now!

Yang Ye disregarded Leng Jun’s resentful gaze and said indifferently, “I presume you are clearly aware of the situation you’re in now. I’ll get straight to the point. Tell me everything that you know. Don’t hold back or lie because living would become worse than death for you if you do that!”

Leng Jun spoke in a hoarse voice. “Would you give me a swift end if talk?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Give you a swift end?” The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth raised slightly to reveal slight ridicule. He said, “If you wanted to die, then why didn’t you bite your tongue and take your own life? Or directly detonate your Dantian? Since you don’t want to die, then don’t put on an act in front of me. Tell me everything you know. As for whether you die or not, that’ll depend entirely on your performance!”

Leng Jun fell silent. He naturally didn’t want to die. Otherwise, he should have taken his life at the instant that he was trapped by the violet mink. However, he hadn’t done that. In other words, he wanted to live! However, he knew that if he wanted to live, it would be equivalent to betraying the League, and it was actually equivalent to death as well. The only difference was when death arrived....

If it came later, then it meant that he had another period of time to live!

When he thought up to here, Leng Jun closed his eyes slowly, and then he said, “What do you want to know?”

The corners of Yang Ye’s eyes twitched when he heard this, and then he heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. Even though he’d said that Leng Jun was afraid of death, his intuition told him that this assassin wasn’t afraid of death, and there ought to be a special reason why this assassin was acting in this way. Of course, he wasn’t interested to find out what the special reason was. Because so long as this assassin didn’t take his own life, then it would be equivalent to Yang Ye possessed a new lackey that was an extraordinary assassin!

After 15 minutes passed, Yang Ye’s expression had turned unsightly when he finished listening to Leng Jun. Because he found out that these three assassins who’d come for his life this time weren’t sent by the Origin School, Ghost Sect, or the Flower Palace, and it was the Sword Sect instead!

Even though Yang Ye didn’t have even the slightest good impression of the Sword Sect, he’d still done a great deal for the Sword Sect out of consideration for Su Qingshi. However, not only did the Sword Sect not free grateful, it even had the intent to kill him on many occasions. This time, it had even directly dispatched assassins to take his life!

“The Sword Sect....” Yang Ye took a deep breath while his eyes were filled with an icy cold expression. This time, he’d placed the Sword Sect and the Flower Palace at a similar position in his perception.

Right at this moment, Leng Jun suddenly said while he laid on the ground, “What’re you going to do with me!?”

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, gazed at Leng Jun, and then said, “My intuition tells me that you probably aren’t one that fears death!”

Leng Jun revealed a miserable smile while his eyes were filled with a savage expression. He said, “My enemies are still alive, so how could I die?”

“Enemies?” said Yang Ye with a frown on his face.

Leng Jun knew that his fate was in Yang Ye’s hands, so he didn’t dare to be hostile and arrogant towards Yang Ye. He immediately said in a low voice, “Perhaps you don’t know how the League of Doom fosters assassins! Allow me to tell you how they do it! They start fostering assassins from a young age. In other words, they especially look for children below the age of 10 to foster. They search throughout the world for children with a good natural endowment, and so long as they find one, they’d definitely take the child with them and start fostering the child from a young age. Moreover, for the sake of making these children become utter tools of assassinations, they force these children to kill the people closest to them with their own two hands!”

“They make the children kill the people closest to them?” Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly. Isn’t the League of Doom a little too perverted!?

Leng Jun said with a savage expression on his face, “That’s nothing! For the sake of controlling these future top-rate assassins, they give these children a lethal poison from a young age. This lethal poison won’t take our lives. However, living will be worse than death for us if we’re unable to obtain the antidote every single month! It will be just like how it was for me earlier!”

“So, in that way, you’re suffering from a toxic poison right now?” Yang Ye frowned as he asked this question. He wasn’t interested at all in this person’s sad and miserable life. Yang Ye only cared about a single thing, and it was whether this assassin could become an extraordinary goon that was under his command!

“Yes!” Leng Jun didn’t conceal it.

“If it’s like that, then you’re completely worthless, huh?” said Yang Ye in an indifferent tone. He would naturally not feel any pity towards an enemy. Even though this fellow’s life was extremely tragic, he was still Yang Ye’s enemy! Since it was an enemy, then it was best that his life was tragic, and it was even to the extent that Yang Ye would make his life a worse tragedy!

Throughout these years, Yang Ye had understood a principle. One could have empathy, but one shouldn’t extend such feelings to one’s enemies. Because kindness to one’s enemies was cruelty to one’s self. Yang Ye was absolutely not do something stupid like rescuing someone only to be backstabbed right after!

Leng Jun’s eyelids twitched. Did I say all of that for nothing?

Yes, the reason he’d said all of that was because he hoped to obtain Yang Ye’s pity. So long as Yang Ye pitied him, then he just had to sacrifice something or even his freedom, and then surviving wouldn’t be difficult at all!

But now, not only did Yang Ye feel no pity towards him at all, Yang Ye wanted to kill him because he had no value anymore. Is he still human? Is he still a human being?

Yang Ye said indifferently, “Give me a reason not to kill you. Otherwise, you can take your own life.”

“Is a dead person useful to you?” Leng Jun said, “If you’re able to dispel the poison for me, then it represents that you can do the same for the other assassins. In that way, I can contact other assassins to work for you.”

Yang Ye was slightly tempted. He’d personally experienced the skill of these King Realm assassins. If he was able to take control of a group formed from mysterious assassins, then it would undoubtedly be an extremely good thing for him!

“All of you are being controlled by the League of Doom. However, if all of you come to work under me, I’ll be utilizing a similar method to take control of all of you as well. If that’s the case, would all of you still be willing?” asked Yang Ye.

“Yes!” Leng Jun didn’t hesitate at all and said, “All of us members of the League of Doom can be said to have irreconcilable enmity with the league. If it wasn’t for the poison, I believe that at least 80% or more assassins would betray the league. If you’re able to dispel the poison that plagues them, then I guarantee that they’ll definitely be willing to be controlled by you!”

After a short moment, Yang Ye shook his head and said, “All of this is established on the foundation that I can dispel the poison for all of you. However, do you think I can? Even though I don’t know what sort of poison all of you are suffering from, since the League of Doom utilized it to take control of the assassins under its command, then I presume it isn’t just trash!”

Leng Jun fell silent when he heard this. Yes, just as Yang Ye said, the conditions he spoke of were established upon Yang Ye’s ability to dispel the poison within their bodies. If Yang Ye was unable to accomplish that, then everything was just wishful thinking!

Right at this moment, the violet mink on Yang Ye’s shoulder had suddenly flashed and arrived in front of him, and then it started waving its little claws!

“You’re saying that you can do it?” Yang Ye was astounded.

The violet mink shook its little head, and then it rubbed Yang Ye’s stomach as if it was saying ‘that mysterious vortex can’....

Yang Ye’s eyes lit up. Right, how could I have forgotten the mysterious tiny vortex? Since I noticed the tiny vortex until now, there seems to have been nothing that the tiny vortex couldn’t accomplish. So, dispelling poison shouldn’t be difficult for the mysterious tiny vortex, right?

When he thought up to here, Yang Ye gazed at Leng Jun and said, “What poison are you inflicted with?”

Leng Jun shook his head and said, “I don’t know as well. In any case, it was placed in our bodies from a very young age. Now, our blood, meridians, and skin ought to have poison within them!”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched when he heard this. The League of Doom really is perverted. It actually utilized such a method to control these assassins.

Of course, there was even more pleasant surprise in his heart. Because if the tiny vortex could dispel the poison, then it represented that it was very likely for the assassins of the League of Doom to belong to him, Yang Ye!

If he had the assistance of this group of assassins, then Yang Ye would have even more confidence in his ability to face the Flower Palace or any other power!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts before he walked slowly towards Leng Jun, and then he stretched out his hand and placed it on Leng Jun’s shoulder. After that, his consciousness entered Leng Jun’s body to investigate the situation within Leng Jun’s body. He was naturally not afraid of Leng Jun playing any tricks. After all, a strand of Leng Jun’s soul was still in his possession! Thus, so long as Leng Jun wasn’t an utter idiot, then Leng Jun wouldn’t play any tricks at a time like this!

At the moment that Yang Ye touched Leng Jun’s arm, a wisp of a cold glow instantly flashed in Leng Jun’s eyes. But in next to no time, that strand of a cold glow had vanished! Indeed, that instant just now was the best opportunity to kill Yang Ye. However, he’d given it up in the end, and the reason was none other than because he wasn’t confident in his ability to kill Yang Ye!
