Chapter 2136 – So What?

100!

Needless to say, Yang Ye was quite speechless. While it was a little exaggerated, Yang Ye was sure of one thing, he was no match for her without his sword. Her combat instinct and technique were much too superior.

An Nanjing was undoubtedly the strongest when it came to close quarter combat against those at the same realm of cultivation!

The Martial God!

A god in martial arts!

Suddenly, An Nanjing said, “Let’s compete while you’re using your sword!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and nodded.

An Nanjing and him had to help each other bring out their flaws.

After that, Yang Ye and An Nanjing started training with each other every day. Once he used his sword, he could fight her equally.

They fought to their heart’s content!

As far as Yang Ye was concerned, his current objective was very simple, and it was to fight to his heart’s content while ignoring everything else!

Just fight without holding back at all!

Just like that, time trickled by, and two weeks passed.

Northern Martial Mountain. At the precipice of the mountain, Yang Ye and An Nanjing were sitting side by side.

The sun was slowly rising in the horizon.

They just sat silently by each other’s side!

A short while passed before An Nanjing asked, “What do you plan to do now?”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “I’ll take it one step at a time.”

She gazed at him.

Yang Ye smiled, “It can’t be helped. We can’t do anything in this situation. All we can do is work hard on growing stronger. As for everything else, we can only wait for those experts to fight it out.”

An Nanjing nodded slightly, “I want to enter your pagoda!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Huh?”

An Nanjing explained, “The Martial Soul Beast, I need it to be with me. It can greatly improve my strength. However, your Snowy has taken it away.”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing added, “Actually, I can make it stay with me, but letting it stay with Snowy will be very beneficial to it. Moreover, as far as I’m concerned, where I cultivate doesn’t matter, and maybe I’ll be able to help you if I stay with you!”

Yang Ye’s heart felt warm. He knew that was the real reason. Presently, he was in endless trouble, so having An Nanjing with him would be equivalent to possessing an extraordinarily strong person to help him. It could be said that they would have no need to fear three or four Sages. Even five Sages were a force they could escape even if they couldn’t defeat them.

Yang Ye didn’t refuse as he was always decisive and straightforward with her.

Both of them were very pure in this regard!

Suddenly, the Vice Dean appeared not too far behind them.

As he gazed at Yang Ye and An Nanjing, the Vice Dean shook his head. He knew that she was definitely going to leave with Yang Ye. While he felt that it was quite a pity, it wasn’t that bad. After all, many people from Martial Emperor Academy chose to leave in the end.

This was just a place to learn for them.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing walked over to the Dean, and the latter glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Someone from the Dao Path is here!”

The Dao Path? Yang Ye frowned, “What are they here for?”

The Vice Dean replied, “They’re here for you. They’re waiting at the entrance to Martial Emperor Cavern, so go meet them!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and nodded, and then he vanished on the spot.

The Vice Dean gazed at An Nanjing and said, “If you’re willing to stay, my academy is willing to foster you with everything it has and even make you the next Dean. If you’re willing!”

Willing!

Needless to say, it was a very attractive offer. Of course, it was only attractive to others.

An Nanjing shook her head slightly, “I’m going with him!”

The Vice Dean laughed bitterly, “Why?”

She replied, “He needs me!”

The Vice Dean shook his head, “Little Girl, Martial Emperor Academy isn’t as simple as it looks. We…” He hesitated for a moment and continued, “Anyway, if you’re able to gain control of the academy, then no matter what happens in the large universe, the academy will still remain an overlord. This is something I can guarantee you.”

An Nanjing shook her head slightly, “My heart only has room for the Martial Dao, and him!”

“Alright!” The Vice Dean smiled, “I would become annoying if I continue. No matter what, you’re a student of the academy, so I hope you come back often.”

She nodded, “I will!”

The Vice Dean nodded and left.

While he felt it was quite a pity, he couldn’t do anything about it.

…

Martial Emperor Cavern.

Yang Ye met a middle aged man in a Daoist’s robe. It was Dao Ling.

Dao Ling said, “Senior Brother Dao Qing asked me to take you back to the Dao Path!”

Return? Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he asked, “For what?”

Dao Ling said, “To make things official!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Make what official?”

Dao Ling replied, “Aren’t you a successor of my Dao Path? We’re going to officially register you in the Dao Path. Moreover, you’ll get a command token as proof of identity. From now onward, you’ll be a true successor of the Dao Path, and the Dao Path is willing to take responsibility for every word you speak and action you take. We’re…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Dao Ling was slightly stunned, “What do you mean?”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “No one’s stupid here. It’s pointless to play these games.”

Dao Ling fell silent for a long time, and then he sighed softly, “Fine, I won’t. Senior Brother Dao Qing asked me to bring you back. As for the reason, I’m not very sure. He just said that if you’re willing to return, then the Dao Path is willing to pay the price to protect you!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and chuckled, “I won’t go back anymore!”

Dao Ling was puzzled, “Huh?”

Yang Ye explained, “Senior Dao Ling, I’m a straightforward person, and I saw what I think. What did the Dao Path do when I was being ganged up on? The Dao Path asked me to leave, and so I did. Now that no one is attacking me, the Dao Path wants me to return? Senior Dao Ling, give Dao Qing a message for me. Who does he think he is? I should go when he wants and return when he wants?”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away.

Dao Ling frowned, “Yang Ye, my Dao Path doesn’t have to have you!”

The meaning behind his words was that Yang Ye shouldn’t think too much of himself. Obviously, Yang Ye’s tone had made him feel quite displeased. He was a genius at any rate, and he was a Sage too. But Yang Ye was just at the Major Zen Realm!

Suddenly, Yang Ye stopped and gazed at Dao Ling, “Allow me to be a little direct, I owe the Dao Progenitor, and I know that. However, everyone else, including you… what have all of you done for me? Nothing! So, please get that through your head and don’t act like you’re being benevolent to me.”

Yang Ye turned around and left.

That was how Yang Ye was. If someone respected him, he would respect the person; if someone was good to him, he would be good to the person. However, if someone treated him like an idiot, then he would make that person suffer.

He didn’t know why the Dao Path wanted him back, but it was definitely because he was useful to them.

He was asked to leave when he wasn’t useful to them, and he was asked to return when he was useful. Who did they think he was?

Yang Ye ignored Dao Ling and left.

Dao Ling wanted to say more, but An Nanjing suddenly appeared in front of him. He frowned slightly and was about to speak when An Nanjing suddenly raised her foot and swung it at his head.

It was swift like a bolt of lightning and impossible to dodge!

A cold glow flashed through Dao Ling’s eyes. He clenched his right fist and slammed it at her leg.

However, when it was about to strike her leg, An Nanjing suddenly moved slightly to the side, and just that slight movement made Dao Ling’s expression changed drastically.

Bang!

A muffled bang resounded, and Dao Ling was blasted over 300m back. However, An Nanjing suddenly appeared in front of him, and then her right leg slammed down from above. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Bang!

Dao Ling was blasted over 1km away this time.

This wasn’t the end of it. After she kicked him away, her red leg moved slightly as she clenched her right fist, and then her figure bent down slightly. A moment later, her figure spun, and her right fist slammed at Dao Ling from afar.

Boom!

The space around Dao Ling collapsed, but the force of An Nanjing’s attack hadn’t vanished, and it ceaselessly slammed against Dao Ling who was within a black hole now.

Around five breaths of time later, everything returned to normal.

Dao Ling was still alive, and blood was slowly seeping out of the corner of his mouth while he gazed at An Nanjing. Besides that, his internal organs had cracked open.

He wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and stared at An Nanjing, “Who are you?!”

At this moment, he was beyond shocked. The woman before him was merely at the Major Zen Realm, but he noticed that he’d been completely surpassed in their collision just now. He didn’t even have the chance to fight back. While it was because she’d attacked abruptly and taken him by surprise, she was just at the Major Zen Realm! But he was a Sage, a true Sage!

An Nanjing patted her slightly messy clothes and gazed at Dao Ling, “Don’t come looking for him again. Otherwise, I’ll kill you!”

An Nanjing turned around and left.

Dao Ling’s expression was extremely unsightly, and his voice resounded, “What? Both you and Yang Ye want to become enemies with my Dao Path?”

“Enemies?” An Nanjing turned around and gazed at him, “So be it.”

Dao Ling was stunned speechless.
