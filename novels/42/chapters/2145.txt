Chapter 2146 – Why Do You Like to Kill?

“So Sages are this weak!”

As soon as these words were spoken, the members of the Dao Path had unsightly expressions on their faces. While An Nanjing was speaking about Dao Yin, it could be said to be directed at them too. While it wasn’t nice to hear at all, they didn’t say anything about it.

The woman before them was a truly monstrous genius!

While An Nanjing had used the precious treasure of the god race in that battle, An Nanjing had the upper hand while both sides weren’t using any treasures. Just that was enough to display how terrifying her strength was!

Suppressing Sages in battle while at the Major Zen Realm!

Once she finished saying those words, An Nanjing went over to Yang Ye’s side and said, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye nodded. He ignored the others here and entered the Hall of All.

The experts of the Dao Path remained silent on the spot.

A short while passed before Dao Qing went over to Dao Yin, “Are you alright?”

She shook her head slightly and didn’t say anything.

“Don’t think too much about it!” Dao Qing spoke softly, “She should be that An Nanjing from Martial Emperor Academy, and she has obtained the Martial Emperor’s inheritance. If nothing unexpected happens, she’s this generation’s Martial God. Not to mention you, even I would have no chance to win against her. If she attains the Sage Realm, then I’m afraid I wouldn’t be a match for her at all.”

The Martial God!

Dao Yin’s pupils constricted slightly. The meaning behind those words wasn’t ordinary at all. What was the Martial God? Every single generation’s Martial God reigned supreme above all geniuses and was an unparalleled existence!

Dao Yin gazed at the Hall of All. If that woman from before really was this generation’s Martial God, then she naturally hadn’t lost unjustly!

Dao Qing heaved a sigh of relief when he noticed that Dao Yin was relieved of her negative feelings. He was afraid that Dao Yin would fall into a misguided path and be unable to overcome the fact that she’d lost to a Major Zen Realm expert, ultimately causing her mental state to be spoiled. Yet now, she had clearly let it go!

Dao Qing turned around and gazed at the Hall of All, “If she absorbs the knowledge in there, her strength will grow even more terrifying! Yang Ye too… Their joint forces…”

He naturally knew about the Sovereign of Man’s death.

The dignified leader of the human race, the Sovereign of Man, had been instantly killed by the joint forces of a man and a woman. Moreover, the Sovereign of Sky and the Alliance of All didn’t dare to touch the human race right now. One of the reasons was that they feared Yang Ye and An Nanjing. No one in the Alliance of All could go against their joint forces!

A long time passed before Dao Qing shook his head, “Let’s go!”

It didn’t take long for all of them to leave.

…

In the Hall of All.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing entered the Hall of All and glanced at the surroundings. A dense expanse of rooms filled the surroundings, and there were no less than 100 of them. Every single one of them had a type of knowledge. The knowledge here wasn’t ordinary, and they were the true essence of each type. After all, it was the Dao Progenitor who’d personally collected most of it. He would naturally not do it because it was fun, and it was to study all this knowledge!

The Dao Progenitor had his own Dao, but before he could establish his own Dao, he had to learn the Daos of others. In other words, he had to take the advantages of others and make up for his own flaws. In the end, he succeeded, and all of this knowledge was left behind.

An Nanjing glanced at the surroundings. In the end, her gaze descended upon a room in the distance. There was a ‘武’ character, the character for Martial on it!

Obviously, it was the room for the Martial Dao!

An Nanjing gazed at Yang Ye, and the latter smiled, “Go on!”

She nodded and entered through that door.

Once An Nanjing entered through the door, she found the area behind the door was a world of its own. There were numerous phantoms floating around her, and there were men and women of all ages…

Once she entered the room, all of them gazed at her. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Meanwhile, an old man suddenly said, “It has been very long since someone came in here!”

An Nanjing gazed at the old man, and the old man scanned her before he said, “Since you’ve chosen the Martial Dao, I presume your attainments aren’t ordinary at all. Let us see it, and then we’ll decide who’ll choose you!”

The knowledge here was quite different when compared to the inheritances in the outside world. An Nanjing was quite curious about it.

She scanned the surroundings and said, “All of you should show me your skill instead, and then I’ll decide who to choose!”

The surroundings fell silent once she said that.

All of them gazed at An Nanjing. In the end, the old man said, “You’re very confident!”

An Nanjing put her right hand behind her back, “Allow me to be honest. I think all of you are a little weak. Now, I don’t really feel like learning from all of you anymore!”

All of them felt speechless.

Meanwhile, the old man suddenly stretched out his hand and clawed at her. The powerful pressure of the Martial Dao it carried was like a tornado that swept toward her.

An Nanjing’s expression remained calm as she stomped her right foot down.

Bang!

A wave of powerful force swept out from within her, and it obliterated the pressure emanated by the old man.

At this moment, everyone here was shocked.

An Nanjing glanced at the phantoms here and said, “I’m not interested!”

She turned around and walked away once she finished speaking.

Everything she’d learned and comprehended far surpassed them. After all, the inheritance she’d obtained belonged to the Martial Emperor of Martial Emperor Academy, the Martial God of the large universe. It was undeniable that the experts here were definitely supreme experts in the past. Otherwise, the Dao Progenitor wouldn’t have preserved them in this manner. However, the gap between them and the Martial God was clearly huge.

“Oceanic Convergence!” Suddenly, a voice resounded, and then a finger was pointed at An Nanjing. An Nanjing’s pupils instantly constricted because she saw countless powerful techniques contained within this single attack.

Oceanic Convergence!

An Nanjing’s reaction wasn’t slow, and she raised her hand and slammed a punch at it.

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and then An Nanjing was pushed backward repeatedly.

“Torrential Convergence!’ Suddenly, the voice resounded again, and then another finger appeared before An Nanjing.

An Nanjing’s eyes narrowed slightly. She clenched both her fists, and then she slammed them forward, “Break!”

Boom!

A thunderous explosion resounded through the surroundings, and then this entire world shook violently.

A long time passed before the voice resounded abruptly, “I see the shadow of the Martial God in you, and you possess the true Martial Spirit Physique. It’s true that as far as you’re concerned, we have nothing worth learning.”

Meanwhile, An Nanjing shook her head, “No, I’m interested now. I’ve never seen your Martial Dao, and I hope to learn from you!”

A moment of silence ensued, and then the voice suddenly said, “It’s my Martial Dao’s honor!”

…

After An Nanjing entered through that door, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. In the end, his gaze fell on a door, and the ‘剑’ character for sword was on it!

The Sword Dao!

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to enter through that door.

Once he entered through the door, he was surrounded by many phantoms, just like An Nanjing had. There were men and women here, and there were over 30 of them.

All of them were top-rate sword cultivators of the past!

The Dao Progenitor had preserved a strand of their soul here with special methods. Of course, he’d paid a price to accomplish this. However, for the sake of himself and the future generations of the Dao Path, the price he paid was worth it.

Once he entered through the door, all the phantoms here gazed at him.

A middle aged man amongst them suddenly tapped his finger in Yang Ye’s direction, and a ray of sword energy shot at Yang Ye. Yang Ye didn’t dodge it. He just raised his hand and tapped his finger forward too, and a ray of sword energy shot out from the tip of his finger. In an instant, it collided with the middle aged man’s sword energy.

Bang!

Both of their sword energy exploded apart and were obliterated.

“A pure Sword Dao!” Meanwhile, the middle aged man said, “Not bad. Unfortunately, your desire to kill is too strong.”

Yang Ye replied, “The sword is used to kill. What’s the point of a sword without the desire to kill?”

The sword is used to kill!

It was quite a controversial statement. Many people felt that Yang Ye’s view of the sword was an insult to it. However, as far as Yang Ye was concerned, the sword was used to kill. Regardless of whether he was trying to protect someone or do anything else, the final goal was to kill. Since the goal was to kill, then it was normal to have the desire to kill.

The phantoms here exchanged glances. In the end, the middle aged man asked, “You think the sword is only used to kill?”

Yang Ye replied with a question, “What do you think?”

The middle aged man shook his head slightly, “Our paths differ.”

He turned around and left once he finished speaking.

Meanwhile, the others shook their heads and left.

Not a single one of them stayed behind!

Obviously, they were very displeased by what Yang Ye had said. Some people felt that the sword wasn’t used to kill, it was like their second life or loved one. So, as far as they were concerned, Yang Ye’s statement was an insult to the sword! Thus, they had left. Obviously, they didn’t want to pass down any knowledge about the Sword Dao to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and shrugged. He didn’t care at all, and he just turned around and left.

Everyone had their own Dao, and everyone’s Sword Dao was actually different. Yang Ye would not think that another’s Sword Dao was wrong and his was right. However, as far as he was concerned, regardless of right or wrong, he would stay true to his Sword Dao.

It was his Dao, and he would continue on this path.

Yang Ye left decisively. Once he arrived outside, he glanced at the surroundings. In the end, his gaze descended onto a door with the ‘杀’ character for slaughter on it.

The Slaughter Dao!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and walked in.

It was a blood red world.

Blood and spirits floated all around this world, and it was filled with boundless slaughter intent.

Suddenly, a voice resounded in Yang Ye’s ears, “Why do you like to kill?”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and replied, “It gives me joy!”
