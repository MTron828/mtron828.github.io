Chapter 1951 – I Am Here to Cause Trouble!

Yang Ye’s roaring and mad laughter resounded.

Needless to say, Yang Ye was in a very sorry state right now. There were countless injuries throughout his body. Especially his chest and back, there were quite a few parts of them which didn’t look normal anymore.

It was terrible!

Extremely terrible!

If he was an ordinary person, then such heavy injuries would have killed him a long time ago. While he wasn’t dead, it didn’t feel good at all!

The Gold Form merely strengthened his body by a large degree, so it provided him the ability to fight many on his own for a short time. But it wasn’t invincible!

It could be said that he had been in a terrible situation just now.

But at this moment, he was at the 1st stage of the Enlightened Realm!

He hadn’t advanced by chance. It was because he’d been at the peak of the True Realm, and he was just half a step away from the Enlightened Realm. The battle to the death he’d just fought had allowed him to break through the final barrier and attain the Enlightened Realm!

The Enlightened Realm!

The devil men around Yang Ye exchanged glances. Is the Enlightened Realm very great? We’re all at the Enlightened Realm!Meanwhile, one of them leaped up and rammed his body at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye took a deep breath. At this moment, he felt like everything was different! He didn’t think carefully about what had changed because the devil man had arrived before him.

Yang Ye opened his eyes, gazed at the devil man before him, and slapped his palm forward!

Everyone watched with astonishment as the devil man was slapped over 30km away!

All the other devil men here were stunned!

Yang Ye glanced at his own palm. At this moment, his strength had multiplied in all aspects. His spirit, soul, and body had undergone a huge improvement. It could be said that he was a completely different person now!

That half step he completed was a qualitative transformation!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, glanced at the devil men around him, and then a ferocious smile curled up on the corners of his mouth. After that, he vanished on the spot! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Speed!

At this moment, his speed had at least tripled!

Even though it was just three times, it was still an extremely terrifying amount. It could be said that he could suppress experts below the 4th stage of the Enlightened Realm by relying solely on his speed!

Bang!

At the same instant that Yang Ye’s figure vanished, one of the devil men was blasted flying before he could even react.

However, he survived the attack. The devil men had extremely strong physical bodies as well, so unless he used his sword, it was very difficult for him to kill them with a single attack.

If one punch wasn’t enough, then maybe two or even three would do the trick!

Just like that, the situation was turned around in an instant.

The people on the city walls watched with astonishment as Yang Ye actually fought all of them on his own!

The reason he wasn’t using his sword was that he’d come to the Dead Dimension with the goal of tempering himself and not to kill.

The sword was used to kill!

Moreover, he’d come to like the feeling of striking with his fists. Every single punch allowed him to feel the trembling of every single muscle in his body, and it was a truly wonderful feeling.

Yang Ye grew more and more excited and engrossed as the battle continued. As for the devil men, it was beyond horrible for them. At this moment, Yang Ye was like a completely different person. He’d given up on trying to defend himself, so all their attacks struck his body. But at the same time, Yang Ye’s fists would strike them too.

But there was a problem!

Yang Ye was able to endure all their attacks, but they were either killed or injured by Yang Ye’s punches. Presently, there were five devil men on the ground. While they were still alive, they were heavily injured and had lost the ability to move!

Finally, one of the devil men wasn’t able to take it any longer!

Run!

A few of them fled in an instant!

Yang Ye was stunned, and then his figure shot after one of them while he roared angrily, “Why are you running? I still want to fight!”

He suddenly slammed his fist forward!

That devil man’s expression changed. He didn’t dare to go head-on against Yang Ye’s punch. But Yang Ye’s punch was really too swift and coupled with the fact that no one was there to keep Yang Ye busy, he wasn’t able to dodge it at all!

Bang!

Everyone wasn’t even able to see the attack clearly before the devil man was blasted away. Once he blasted that devil man away, Yang Ye didn’t stop and went over to another devil man, and then he kicked that devil man’s head.

Boom!

That devil man’s head exploded apart!

Brain matter sprayed into the air!

However, the others had escaped!

Yang Ye closed his eyes and greedily sucked in a breath of air.

The Enlightened Realm!

He hadn’t expected himself to actually advance to the Enlightened Realm! Sure enough, combat was much more useful than meditating and cultivating behind closed doors.

The advancement in his cultivation didn’t just improve his physical body, even his soul, speed, strength, and one more important thing was improved along with his cultivation.

The Sword Domain!

The improvement in his Sword Domain was the most important! Based on his previous strength, his Sword Domain could only suppress experts below the 5th stage of the Enlightened Realm, and the Sword Domain couldn’t suppress those above it. Yet now, his Sword Domain could at least suppress Hear Dao Realm experts!

Moreover, as the Sword Domain grew, the Split Second and Heavenrend he executed while enveloped within the Sword Domain would definitely undergo a qualitative transformation! Especially the Invincible Sword Domain!

In short, he’d undergone an advancement in all aspects!

Besides that, this advancement allowed him to merge even more with the Sky Dragon!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and glanced at his body. At this moment, the Primordial Violet Energy had almost fully restored his body.

Yang Ye glanced at the corpses around him, and then he gazed at the small city in the distance. The man with the bow on his back was outside the city. The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth curled up into a ferocious smile when he laid eyes on the man!

“Die!” A furious howl resounded as a shadow shot towards the man with the bow.

It was Yang Ye!

The man’s expression changed slightly when he saw Yang Ye attack. However, his reaction speed wasn’t slow at all, and two arrows immediately shot forward. But those two arrows hadn’t even been able to get close to Yang Ye before they were slapped into bits!

An instant later, Yang Ye arrived before the man and slammed his palm down.

Meanwhile, a golden shield appeared to shield the man.

Boom!

The golden shield stopped Yang Ye’s attack, but the powerful force behind it caused the man and his shield to be blasted away.

Yang Ye was about to attack again, but he suddenly looked towards the side. A spear had appeared before him, and it was shooting towards his forehead!

Yang Ye raised his hand and swung it at the spear!

Bang!

The spear was blasted back to a middle aged man on the city walls!

The middle aged man stared at Yang Ye, “Who are you?!”

Yang Ye ignored the middle aged man and turned to look at the man with the bow. After that, his figure shot forward again.

Yang Ye was extremely swift. It only took him an instant to arrive before the man and swing a punch at him.

The man’s reaction wasn’t slow at all. His figure moved far backwards as soon as Yang Ye appeared before him. At the same time, a few dozen arrows shot towards Yang Ye. However, all of them were slapped into bits upon coming close to Yang Ye!

Yang Ye was about to attack again, but the middle aged man on the city walls suddenly appeared in front of him. After that, a spear shot towards his forehead.

Yang Ye’s expression remained calm. He twisted his right foot against the ground and tilted his body to the right, dodging the lethal attack. At the same time, he tapped his right foot against the ground and pressed forward before slamming his fist at the middle aged man!

Bang!

The middle aged man was blasted over 1km away!

Always press the advantage!

Yang Ye stomped his right foot down and shot forward like a bullet.

The middle aged man’s expression changed slightly, and he slammed his spear forward.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the middle aged man was blasted away with his spear! At the instant that his figure flew backwards, Yang Ye suddenly appeared behind him and slammed a punch at his head!

Based on Yang Ye’s current strength, if this punch hit its target, then the middle aged man’s head would definitely explode!

However, two golden arrows suddenly tore through the air and stabbed against his fist. While they weren’t able to pierce through his fist, they caused his fist to be pushed off target.

The middle aged man seized the opportunity to turn around and sweep his spear at Yang Ye.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted around 300m away!

The middle aged man stared at Yang Ye while vigilance filled his eyes, “Who are you?!”

Yang Ye ignored the middle aged man and gazed at the man with the bow, “Did you have fun shooting at me so much?”

The man with the bow glanced at Yang Ye and said, “You entered our territory! So, you deserve to be killed!”

“Entered your territory?” Yang Ye laughed ferociously, glanced at the surroundings, and said, “I’m doing that right now! Bite me!”

He was naturally extremely furious. Earlier, if his body hadn’t been sufficiently strong, he may have been killed by the man’s arrows.

“Who are you?!” The middle aged man behind Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “This is Sky Residence City. You…”

“I don’t care what city it is!” Meanwhile, Yang Ye gazed at the middle aged man, “Now, I just want to kill the person who kept shooting arrows at me. I’ll kill you too if you interfere.”

“Such arrogance! A mere Enlightened Realm cultivator dares to cause trouble in my Sky Residence City?!” Suddenly, a voice resounded from the distant city wall. At the same time, a powerful aura slammed down towards Yang Ye.

Suddenly, a sword appeared in Yang Ye’s grasp, and then he swung it!

Hiss!

The city wall was instantly slashed over.

Yang Ye pointed his sword at the city and walked slowly in its direction, “That’s exactly what I plan to do!”
