Chapter 2137 – My Surname Isn’t Yang!

Needless to say, Dao Ling had an extremely unsightly expression on his face right now!

After all, he’d heard a Major Zen Realm expert, an expert at a realm that was like an ant to him, provoke him like that.

It was undisguised provocation! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

An Nanjing said, “The Dao Path? Is it very strong?”

Dao Ling was speechless.

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared beside An Nanjing, and she gazed at him. Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “Let’s go!”

An Nanjing nodded.

“Yang Ye!” Suddenly, Dao Ling said, “Are you really going to cut off all ties with the Dao Path?”

Yang Ye gazed at Dao Ling, “I only recognize the Dao Progenitor in the Dao Path, and I will never forget the help he has given me. But as for everyone else, if I’m to be honest, do we even have any ties between us?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he left with An Nanjing.

Dao Ling fell silent on the spot, and his face was extremely gloomy.

Meanwhile, the Vice Dean appeared by Dao Ling’s side. He sized up Dao Ling and said, “Dao Ling, those two little fellows never give in to threats. If you threaten them, it’ll only strengthen their retaliation. But if they join forces, then if I’m to be honest, besides that drunken madman of your Dao Path, any other Sage from your Dao Path is no match for them, even you. Not to mention you, if they join forces, even I may die at their hands!”

Dao Ling spoke softly, “Both of them… are much stronger than we were!”

The Vice Dean smiled, “The next generation always surpasses the previous! So, why did Dao Qing suddenly want him to return?”

Dao Ling hesitated for a moment and explained, “All three paths have backup plans, and so does the Confucianist Path. However, they failed. It was a dual failure, both their representative and the Confucianist Progenitor failed. That’s the cause of the Confucianist Path’s destruction. Now, my Dao Path needs a representative to open up a way out for us. He’s the most suitable for that job!”

“He’s the most suitable?” The Vice Dean frowned slightly, ‘What about that drunken madman?”

Dao Ling shook his head slightly, “He can’t do it all on his own. As for the rest of us, our temperament isn’t very suitable. We won’t be able to survive in a place like that.”

“Then all of you have really courted death!” Meanwhile, the Vice Dean said, “Seriously, why did your Dao Path make a compromise when the other races were hunting Yang Ye? Not only did you do that, you want him to do something for you now? If it was you, what would you think? What would you do?”

Dao Ling laughed bitterly, “I didn’t have much hope when I came. Now, I can only let the higher-ups make the decision.”

Once he finished speaking, he vanished into the sky.

The Vice Dean was about to leave when an old man suddenly appeared by his side, “They’ve left the academy.”

He was naturally talking about Yang Ye and An Nanjing.

The Dean nodded slightly. Meanwhile, the old man added, “The Alliance of All is going to act against him.”

The Vice Dean asked, “They’ve already taken action?”

The old man nodded, “Shall we help them?”

The Vice Dean hesitated for a moment and shook his head, “No!”

“The Alliance of All is serious this time!” The old man continued, “They’ve sent quite a few experts!”

The Vice Dean said, “It’s fine. The higher-ups have sent word that besides Progenitor Realm experts, he has to face all his problems and the experts that come for him on his own!”

“I understand!” The old man vanished once he finished speaking.

…

In the boundless reaches of outer space.

Yang Ye had just left Martial Emperor Academy and arrived here. He was just about to continue forward when a middle aged man suddenly appeared not too far away from him.

The Sovereign of Man!

The middle aged man who’d appeared not too far away from Yang Ye was the leader of the human race, the Sovereign of Man!

The Sovereign of Man glanced at Yang Ye, “I didn’t expect us to meet again so soon!”

Yang Ye grinned, “Looks like you refuse to give up on killing me!”

The Sovereign of Man replied, “There are some debts that should be repaid, right?”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “You would never face me alone no matter how brave you are, so ask the others to show themselves too. Let me see how many you’ve brought with you this time!”

As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, the space around Yang Ye trembled slightly, and then 16 powerful auras suddenly appeared around him. They formed a cage that firmly locked down the area around Yang Ye.

Coupled with the Sovereign of Man, the initial count was 17 Sages!

17 Sages!

It was a terrifying force!

The Sprite Lord!

Actually, the Alliance of All wasn’t here just for Yang Ye. Yang Ye wasn’t that important. It was actually Snowy that made them send such a huge force.

The end times were upon them, and a Sprite Lord would become the most precious treasure at that time!

Coupled with the fact that Yang Ye had a good relationship with the god race, the Alliance of All was determined to obtain the Sprite Lord. Because if it fell into the god race’s hands, it would be a calamity for them.

The Sovereign of Man walked over to Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, it’s time to put an end to the enmity between us.”

Suddenly, Dao Ling—who’d left earlier—appeared here.

Everyone here gazed at Dao Ling, and so did Yang Ye. He hadn’t expected Dao Ling to show himself at a time like this.

Meanwhile, the Sovereign of Man asked, “What? Does the Dao Path plan to interfere?”

Dao Ling didn’t answer the Sovereign of Man, and he gazed at Yang Ye instead, “I’ll give you one last chance. If you’re willing to return with me, then not to mention 17 Sages, my Dao Path will protect you even from 27!”

The Sovereign of Man and the others’ expressions turned unsightly when they heard him.

It was a form of provocation!

Yang Ye chuckled, and then he gazed at the Sovereign of Man’s group, “Isn’t it just 17 Sages?”

As soon as he finished speaking, a sword appeared in his grasp, and then he stomped his right foot down. In an instant, the entire sky trembled, and then a ray of light flashed.

The Sovereign of Man and the others had solemn expressions on their faces when they saw Yang Ye attack. While they had over a dozen Sages here, they didn’t dare to act carelessly at all or underestimate their opponent when facing Yang Ye. Because as far as they were concerned, Yang Ye was an uncertain factor, and that was the main reason they’d sent so many Sages at him.

Right when they put up their guard, the scene that appeared before them made their expressions turn quite unsightly.

Yang Ye hadn’t attacked them, and he’d transformed into a ray of light that tore through their auras and vanished into the distance.

He’d fled!

No one had expected someone who’d always been so aggressive to actually flee!

He’d fled without even trying to fight them!

The difference between reality and their expectations was simply too huge!

Dao Ling hadn’t expected this as well! Yang Ye had always been very aggressive!

“Chase after him!” Suddenly, the Sovereign of Man’s voice resounded, and then the Sages here vanished.

While Yang Ye was fleeing quickly, they were locked onto him.

Just like that, Yang Ye fled while they pursued him.

Around two hours later, they were getting closer and closer to him.

Yang Ye shot through the starry sky on his sword.

His face was completely calm, and he didn’t seem anxious at all.

As they pursued him, the Sovereign of Man’s expression became quite gloomy.

Yang Ye was heading toward the Human Dimension!

Yang Ye planned to flee to the Human Dimension!

What was he planning?

The Human Dimension, Central Prefecture, Heaven’s Son City.

Heaven’s Son City was at the center of the Central Prefecture, and it was where the Sovereign of Man resided. It was the central area of the Human Dimension.

Noon.

The sun hung high above in the sky when a bright ray of light shot down from the sky like a meteor. It was so bright that it even made the scorching sun dim in comparison.

When the ray of light arrived almost 3km away from the city, a few dozen pillars of light shot up into the sky and shot towards it. However, they instantly exploded apart like fireworks upon coming into contact with that ray of light. A moment later, the ray of light arrived in the sky above Heaven’s Son City. Meanwhile, a screen of golden light suddenly enveloped the sky above the city.

Boom!

The screen of golden light stopped the ray of light in the air, but it only took a moment for a man in green clothes to appear in the sky above the city.

It was Yang Ye, of course!

“Who are you?!” Suddenly, a furious shout resounded from within the city.

Yang Ye looked down and replied indifferently, “It’s your grandad!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took his sword in both hands and swung it down.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy shot down from the sky.

Boom!

Countless people watched as it shattered the barrier of light, and then countless shards of energy rained down like a storm from above. At this moment, countless people in the city were horrified and fled the city.

After he shattered the barrier of light with a single swing of his sword, Yang Ye didn’t stop there. He held his sword with both hands and swung it down once more. Moreover, his figure flashed incessantly throughout the city above the city. Every single time his figure flashed, it would be accompanied by a ray of sword energy that shot down to the city. In just a short while, the entire city had been chopped into pieces.

Less than five breaths of time had passed since Yang Ye arrived at the city and completed this attack. So, many experts in the city hadn’t even been able to figure out what had happened before the entire city was in pieces. It was in ruins.

Meanwhile, the Sovereign of Man’s group arrived here, but Yang Ye had already vanished into the sky.

However, his roaring laughter came from far away in the sky, “Sovereign of Sky! All the other races! You want to play? I’ll play with you until the end this time! This time, my surname isn’t Yang if I don’t improve the level of my slaughter intent!”
