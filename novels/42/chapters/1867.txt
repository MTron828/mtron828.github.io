Chapter 1868 – A Warning From The Primordial Pagoda!

Slaughter the world with his sword!

Hou Qing glanced at Yang Ye and didn’t say a word. He knew Yang Ye wasn’t joking, and he believed that Yang Ye was absolutely capable of it.

A short while later, Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda.

Slaughter!

Yang Ye didn’t stop and continued his slaughter. How could he spare those who’d chased after him to kill him in the past?

At this moment, Yang Ye’s strength had risen tremendously, and his sword was unsealed. So, not to mention assassinating them, he could even kill Quasi Enlightened Realm experts in head-on collisions. If he resorted to assassinating, then even a Heavenly Exalt would be filled with fear towards him. As for the other Quasi Enlightened Realm experts, they were even worse.

In a boundless mountain range that was perfectly silent.

Om!

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded amidst the silence, and then it was followed by a miserable and shrill cry.

After those two completely different sounds resounded, the mountain range fell silent once more.

Yang Ye glanced at the corpse on the ground, and then he waved his right hand. In an instant, the corpse before him started drying up at a visible speed. Yang Ye withdrew his hand around 15 minutes later.

He took a deep breath. At this moment, he had a deeper understanding of how terrifying the Devourer Technique was. Because just absorbing that expert was superior to numerous years of bitter cultivation!

Besides that, he gained a better understanding of why the normal cultivators pursued and killed devil cultivators. It was because if everyone cultivated such a technique, the entire world would be in chaos. At that time, everyone would be cultivating it and killing others!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and looked up into the sky. A moment later, he vanished on the spot.

Two hours later, Yang Ye appeared on another mountain range…

Just like that, Yang Ye spent the next two days killing throughout Heaven Pillar Mountain, and he killed around 11 Quasi Enlightened Realm experts.

As more and more Quasi Enlightened Realm experts vanished, some finally realized that something was off.

In the end, after they investigated the matter, they realized that all the vanished Quasi Enlightened Realm experts hadn’t really vanished, they’d been killed.

Who killed them?

In the beginning, all of them were very doubtful, but in the end, they thought of Yang Ye. They recalled what Yang Ye had said that day!

Stay and kill!

Yang Ye had said that he wouldn’t go to the upper universe, and he would stay and kill instead. Now, Yang Ye had started.

Revenge!

Yang Ye was seeking revenge!

Everyone was worried for their own safety!

Because Yang Ye’s current strength combined with the holy sword made him invincible below the Heavenly Exalts.

Hide!

All the experts who’d chased after Yang Ye in the past started to go into hiding, and some even left Heaven Pillar Mountain. Yang Ye wasn’t the same Yang Ye anymore, he wasn’t the Yang Ye they’d pursued that day, and he was someone who even Heavenly Exalts didn’t dare to rashly attack!

How terrifying was a god of death whose strength was comparable to a Heavenly Exalt?

Deep within a mountain range. Before a pool of water.

Yang Ye was seated cross-legged there. A moment later, he vanished on the spot.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye went to the cultivation room and sat cross-legged on the ground. After that, he closed his eyes.

It didn’t take long for the fluctuations of profound energy around him to grow stronger and stronger.

Three days later, Yang Ye opened his eyes.

Huff!

A mouthful of foul air sprayed out from Yang Ye’s mouth, and then he stood up and took a deep breath.

The 5th stage of the True Realm!

After devouring around 15 Quasi Enlightened Realm experts, he’d advanced to the 5th stage of the True Realm! Now, he was confident in his ability to fight a Heavenly Exalt, even if he didn’t use the holy sword.

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something at this moment, and he flashed over to Hou Qing. He asked, “Senior, are there any side effects from this technique?”

Hou Qing replied, “That depends on how you do it. If you spend time consolidating your cultivation every day, then there won’t be any side effects; but if you don’t, then while there won’t be a problem in the short term, many problems will arise in the long term.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand.”

Yang Ye spoke with Hou Qing for a while, and then he went to the 2nd level. He walked over to the bed which Xiao Qi used in the past, and he fell into deep thought as he gazed at it.

Meanwhile, Little Sky walked over to him, “When are you going up there to see them?”

Yang Ye turned to look at Little Sky, and he spoke softly, “Very soon!”

Little Sky nodded slightly, “Don’t make them wait too long.”

Yang Ye walked over to her, “Are you coming with me or going back to Merak System?”

She fell silent for quite some time, and then she said, “I want to go back to Merak System.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’ll send you back soon. Don’t worry, I won’t let anyone go there and harm Merak System.”

Meanwhile, Little Sky stretched out her hand and tapped Yang Ye’s forehead. She smiled, “From this moment onwards, I, the Lord of the Heaven Dao from Merak System, appoint you as the guardian of Merak System. The safety of Merak System is in your hands now!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Understood!”

He chatted with Little Sky for a while, and then he left the pagoda.

Yang Ye didn’t continue killing after he left the pagoda, and he went to Asura City instead. Because today was the day he’d agreed to meet the Asura Exalt here.

Asura City was almost fully repaired when he arrived.

As soon as he arrived there, the City Governor, Mo Jing, appeared before him.

Mo Jing glanced at Yang Ye, “Please come with me!”

He waved his right hand, and the city gates swung open.

Once he entered the city, Yang Ye noticed that Asura City was extremely ghastly. Even though there were buildings all around it, he didn’t sense any signs of life.

It was like a ghost city!

Mo Jing glanced at Yang Ye and explained, “My master slaughtered this city all those years ago. The reason it’s called Asura City is because he’s called the Asura Exalt!”

He slaughtered the city? Yang Ye gazed at Mo Jing, “Why?”

Mo Jing spoke indifferently, “He just wanted to!”

Deterring!

It seemed like he was trying to scare Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at Mo Jing and smiled, “I’m growing to like him. However, I don’t really slaughter cities of people anymore.”

Mo Jing gazed at Yang Ye, and Yang Ye said, “I’ve grown bored of slaughtering cities!”

Mo Jing was at a loss for words.

All along the way, they didn’t say another word to each other, and it didn’t take long for them to arrive before a hall. However, the hall was empty.

“Master is in closed door cultivation. He’ll be out soon!” Mo Jing continued, “Please wait a moment!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Of course!”

The Asura Exalt had given Blood Maiden’s Quintessence Blood Pearl to him, so he was grateful.

Mo Jing nodded slightly and moved aside.

Yang Ye didn’t wait for long. The Asura Exalt appeared before him around ten minutes later.

The Asura Exalt smiled, “Sorry for making you wait!”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s fine!”

The Asura Exalt nodded and said, “Let’s go.”

Yang Ye asked, “Where?”

The Asura Exalt said, “The 10th level of Heaven Pillar Mountain!”

“The 10th level?” Yang Ye was quite surprised, “Aren’t we prohibited from heading up there?”

The Asura Exalt smiled, “That only applies to outsiders. Heavenly Exalts and those as strong as Heavenly Exalts can go there.”

I see! Yang Ye nodded, “Let’s go then!”

As he spoke, Yang Ye was about to leave. However, the Asura Exalt smiled, “That way is too slow.”

As he spoke, a fist-sized blue gemstone appeared in his grasp, and then he pressed it gently. It only took a moment for two blue circles of light to appear before them.

Yang Ye asked, “What’s this?”

The Asura Exalt glanced at the gemstone in his grasp and said, “I obtained this from an expert from the upper universe. It’s called a Dimensional Stone. It has two abilities. Firstly, it allows the user to teleport anywhere. Of course, the precondition is that you know the spatial coordinates of that place. Secondly, it can be used defensively, and it contains Dimensional Energy!”

Yang Ye smiled, “That’s an amazing treasure!”

The Asura Exalt smiled, “Indeed!”

It didn’t take long for them to enter the teleportation formation.

An instant later, Yang Ye felt his vision go black, and then he appeared on a plain. He turned to look around, and he saw the Asura Exalt not too far away from him.

The Asura Exalt smiled, “It’s fast, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “It is!” It hadn’t even taken a tenth of a breath of time for them to arrive here!

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something, and he suddenly said, “This isn’t the 10th level of Heaven Pillar Mountain!” Because he could see the sky here!

The Asura Exalt explained, “From the 10th level to the 12th level, every level is a world.”

“Every level is a world?” Yang Ye frowned, “What do you mean?”

The Asura Exalt explained, “This place is a world created by the almighty figures from years ago. While it’s really small, it’s still a world.” He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Do you know how we usually cultivate?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

The Asura Exalt smiled, “We cultivate here. A group of ancient beings appeared here; they’re called the Xenosprites. We don’t know what they are, but our cultivations rise tremendously if we devour them.”

Xenosprites!

Yang Ye gazed at the Asura Exalt, “You want me to help you kill them?”

The Asura Exalt shook his head slightly and gazed at Yang Ye, “While training here, I found a hidden area by chance. If I’m not wrong, it’s very likely to be the place an ancient almighty figure used to cultivate at or died at. However, it’s protected by a barrier.

Yang Ye immediately came to an understanding when he heard this.

The Asura Exalt wanted him to help break open the barrier!

Suddenly, the tiny vortex within Yang Ye started to spin…

Danger was present here!
