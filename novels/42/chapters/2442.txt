Chapter 2443 – You’re Shameless!

Huang Ying and A’Leng glanced at An Nanjing but didn’t say anything.

They were naturally aware of her. She possessed the Martial God Physique.

It was especially so for A’Leng because she’d experienced An Nanjing’s strength for herself. It could be said that An Nanjing wasn’t any weaker to all three of them.

An Nanjing wasn’t good with words, so she didn’t say anything, and the surroundings fell silent.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged in the cultivation room. He was thinking about something right now!

His bloodline!

He hadn’t sensed it when he used the Madness Sword Technique while in that mad state, but now that he thought about it, he noticed that his blood seemed to have been undergoing some sort of change. Moreover, at the moment he was at the peak of madness while attacking, his blood had actually started to boil slightly. However, it only took a moment to calm down again.

It was boiling!

His blood had been boiling!

That was what Yang Ye had grasped.

The Yang Clan had always possessed the Mad Demon Bloodline, but it made them go mad and lose themselves. So, the members of the clan rarely utilized it. Coupled with the fact that he’d never been in the Yang Clan, Yang Ye had no idea how to truly activate it and improve himself. His father, Yang Wudi, definitely knew how, but his father hadn’t taught him. Moreover, his father had even modified the Mad Demon Bloodline.

Modified it!

While it was said to have been modified, it was actually just suppression of the madness elements within the bloodline. So, as Yang Ye’s strength increased, and after he comprehended the madness intent, he could be said to have overcome the modified bloodline his father had left him and regained the purest form of the Yang Clan’s Mad Demon Bloodline.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Now, he had to find out how to activate his bloodline!

He hadn’t truly grasped it right now, and he merely obtained a little of its power when he released the madness intent. Even then, it raised his strength tremendously!

But what if he truly activated his bloodline?

Yang Ye had no idea how to accomplish that, and he could only gradually explore it on his own. However, after exploring it for quite some time, Yang Ye hadn’t been able to figure out anything.

Meanwhile, a voice resounded, “You want to activate your bloodline?”

Yang Ye looked up and saw Sword Scroll.

Yang Ye nodded in response.

Sword Scroll spoke softly, “I saw your last battle. I watched carefully, and I noticed that when your strength was at its peak, the blood vessels beneath your skin had started to tremble. Or I should say that your blood was boiling, but it didn’t take long for it to calm down again.”

Yang Ye asked, “What are you trying to tell me?”

She replied softly, “I mean if you want to stimulate your bloodline, battle may be your only option. Fight like a madman, and when you fight to a certain extent, or I should say that when you go mad to a certain extent, it may have a chance of being activated. Every bloodline has a different method of activation, and you Mad Demon Bloodline may require battle. Or to be more precise, it may require madness. The more insane you get, the more unclear your mind gets, the more likely you are to activate it!”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Madness!

The more mad and unclear his mind was, the greater his chances were of activating his bloodline! He seemed to have found something!

Battle!

Just like the battle from before, a battle where he fought to his heart’s content. Only such a battle had the greatest likelihood of activating his bloodline!

Meanwhile, Sword Scroll said, “You’re already showing signs of reversing your bloodline. If you’re able to grasp the Mad Demon Bloodline before completing that, it will be very beneficial to you. Moreover, reversing your bloodline isn’t something that can be completed overnight. If you’re able to grasp your Mad Demon Bloodline during this period, it’ll provide a huge increase in strength to you!”

Yang Ye nodded. It was true. If he could grasp the Mad Demon Bloodline before completing the reversal of his bloodline, then it would definitely be very beneficial to him. Unfortunately, he couldn’t rush the process of grasping it.

Yang Ye shook his head and left the Primordial Pagoda.

Outside the pagoda, An Nanjing glanced at him and entered the pagoda.

Huang Ying smiled, “Brother Yang, how do you feel?”

Yang Ye replied, “Very good.”

Huang Ying nodded and shot a glance into the distance. He said, “There’s one last barrier ahead of us, and it’s our final counterattack. Anyone who wants to be the next Crown Prince won’t let us pass, and it'll be a truly difficult battle!”

A'Leng suddenly smiled, “Are you afraid?”

Huang Ying shook his head, “I’m trying to tell you that no matter what happens, I’m happy to have left the Desolate World this time. Because this trip allowed me to get to know both of you. Perhaps both of you are unaware of it but to the geniuses of my desolate race, we only have ourselves. As far as we were concerned, the outside world is just a low level world, and the geniuses there are trash. We even hold disdain for Eternal Kingdom!”

He laughed bitterly at this point, “But after I met both of you, I realized how ignorant and laughable such thoughts were. One can never be conceited and overconfident!”

Yang Ye and A’Leng remained silent.

Actually, they had similar thoughts too. Before this, Yang Ye felt that An Nanjing was the only person in the younger generation who could compete with him. However, these princes of the desolate race weren’t any weaker than him. Then there was A’Leng, this woman from Eternal Kingdom. Her strength was terrifyingly strong too. As they always say, it was best to keep a low profile and work towards one’s goals.

No matter the time, it was always good to stay humble and maintain a low profile!

They exchanged glances, smiled, and continued forward.

They passed through the last mountain of the mountain range, and a boundless plain stood before them. They could faintly see some grand floating buildings at the end of the plain.

The desolate race!

The true territory of the desolate race was at the end of the plain!

The powerful desolate race which had almost conquered Eternal Kingdom once!

Huang Ying pointed into the distance, “That’s Desolate City!”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Let’s take a look around it later!”

A'Leng nodded, “Alright!”

Take a look around it!

Huang Ying chuckled, and his laughter surged into the surroundings. He laughed for a while before he looked ahead, “Brothers of my desolate race, feel free to do your worst!”

They walked toward the city once he finished speaking.

Suddenly, an old man appeared in front of them.

Huang Ying’s face fell when he saw the old man.

Yang Ye and A’Leng revealed solemn expressions on their faces as well.

The old man was no Four World Realm expert, he was at the Five World Realm!

A true Five World Realm expert!

Huang Ying spoke solemnly, “Elder Mortal Exalt, are you going to act against us yourself?”

The old man replied indifferently, “Can’t I?”

Huang Ying smiled, “Of course you can. But the patriarch seems to have said that Five World Realm experts are prohibited from interfering in our race’s internal affairs.”

Meanwhile, the old man’s aura suddenly weakened and weakened. It didn’t take long for his aura to cease being at the Five World Realm and arrive at the peak of the Four World Realm!

Suppression!

The Mortal Exalt of the desolate race had forcefully suppressed his cultivation from the Five World Realm to the Four World Realm!

The old man gazed at Huang Ying, “What about now?”

Huang Ying gazed at the old man for a long time and said, “Shameless!”

Ridicule curled up on the old man’s lips, “As far as I’m concerned, those who use their mouths to argue are trash! How can a piece of trash by the Crown Prince of my desolate race?”

“But he isn’t!” Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “You’re shameless, truly shameless.”

The old man gazed at Yang Ye and waved his hand.

Bang!

A wave of powerful energy rippled out and surged at Yang Ye. This casual attack of his wasn’t any weaker to the full strength of the Deathguard from before.

A true old geezer!

Yang Ye didn’t show any fear. He took a step forward and swung Executor with both hands.

Hiss!

Cracks appeared throughout space as it descended.

It forcefully obliterated the old man’s attack, but Yang Ye was pushed over 30m back!

A Five World Realm expert!

Even though the old man was at the Four World Realm now, would anyone really treat him as one?

The old man glanced coldly at Yang Ye, “You have some ability, but it isn’t enough!”

The old man vanished on the spot, and then a fist shot toward Yang Ye’s head.

It was so fast that it was speed beyond anything a Four World Realm expert should possess!

Even the Deathguards from before were far inferior in speed.

A single punch!

Simple and direct!

Yang Ye’s pupils had constricted the moment that the old man vanished. He didn’t dare to hold back at all, and he swung Executor with both hands.

The Sword Domain!

Five swings!

When the fifth swing descended, space was sliced open before Executor!

Actually, Yang Ye’s strength alone wasn’t enough to slice open the space here, but the sword in his grasp was different. It was the number one sword of Eternal Kingdom!

Or to be more precise, besides an ordinary sword, it was the number one sword in the myriad of universes!

Yang Ye’s attack struck the old man’s fist, but Yang Ye was blasted away instead, and he flew over 30km away.

Blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth once he descended to the ground!

The old man laughed with ridicule, “Your sword isn’t bad. Unfortunately, you’re too weak. Come, take another punch of mine!”

He took a step forward and slammed a punch at Yang Ye from afar!

Boom!

Yang Ye was instantly blasted away. Yang Ye stabbed his sword forward in midair, causing it to enter space slightly and force him to a stop.

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and a wisp of ferociousness appeared on his face. Meanwhile, the old man suddenly said, “The desire to kill? As far as I’m concerned, you’re a joke.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man was about to attack when Yang Ye suddenly smiled ferociously, “One attack! I’ll defeat you with one attack!”

A ray of blood red light suddenly swept out from within Yang Ye.

Madness intent!

At the same time, a pair of pitch black wings appeared behind him!

The Demon Wings of Death!
