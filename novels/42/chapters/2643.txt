Chapter 2644 – Let’s Play Up Here!

The fifth sword!

Yang Ye gazed at the old man. Obviously, he was Chen Xuanan’s master.

If Yang Ye was being honest, he hadn’t expected the old man to come.

After all, the old man hadn’t even left the cottage when he went to see the old man that day.

“The fifth sword?” Shui Wubian was quite puzzled.

Mr. Jing stared at the old man, “During that era, there were countless who used the sword, but four of them were impossible to surpass. They are the four forms of Destiny. Every one of her forms uses the sword. Beneath them was another, and it’s him, Jian Wudi. His extraordinary attainment in the Sword Dao gave him the title of the fifth sword!”

During that era, Jian Wudi was the strongest in the Sword Dao beneath Destiny.

Mr. Jing hadn’t expected that Jian Wudi was actually alive!

After all, countless experts had perished during that era, and Jian Wudi had never shown himself again. So, everyone thought he’d died!

However, he was alive, and he was even in the End World to help Yang Ye!

Mr. Jing pondered deeply for a moment and said, “Senior Jian, what did Yang Ye promise you to make you come here and help him?”

Jian Wudi didn’t say a word and just vanished on the spot.

Hiss!

A ray of fiery red sword energy flashed.

Mr. Jing’s expression changed drastically, but his reaction was swift. He immediately pressed his palms together.

Bang!

The space before him instantly warped and was compressed to form a thick spatial wall.

However, along with the arrival of the sword energy, the spatial wall was instantly breached.

Boom!

Mr. Jing was instantly blasted far away!

Mr. Jing had an extremely unsightly expression on his face.

Meanwhile, a wave of invisible pressure enveloped Jian Wudi.

The Water Domain!

Shui Wubian had joined the fight.

Countless strands of Boundless Water appeared in the surroundings. The Water Domain combined with the Boundless Water made it feel like the entire sky was falling down, and the powerful pressure from their combination was sufficient to suffocate an ordinary Destiny Realm expert.

The old man glanced coldly at Shui Wubian, and then a fiery red sword shot forward from his waist!

A powerful wave of fiery red energy rippled out from the sword.

Hiss!

In an instant, the powerful Water Domain started to collapse inch by inch!

Shui Wubian’s expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly deactivated the Water Domain and moved over 3km away to create distance between himself and the old man.

Even though they were both peak Destiny Realm experts, there was a difference in strength even among such experts.

Yang Ye glanced at Jian Wudi, and then he looked down at Snowy. Snowy nodded, and then she opened her mouth and started madly inhaling the spirit energy of the End World!

As soon as she did that, Mr. Jing and the others’ expressions changed drastically!

At the same time, countless powerful auras descended toward Yang Ye!

Every single one of them was at the peak of the Destiny Realm!

Yang Ye didn’t count the exact number of these auras, but he knew that there were many. Moreover, there may be more and more that would arrive here!

Suddenly, the old man appeared near Yang Ye, and then a wave of powerful sword intent rippled out from him.

The sword intent was like the eruption of countless volcanoes, and it instantly obliterated those auras.

Yang Ye had quite a solemn expression on his face.

The strength of this ancestor of his was a little shocking!

Even though the old man’s sword intent had crushed the auras, it didn’t take long for numerous terrifying auras to appear once more. This time, they were much, much stronger than before!

Mr. Jing spoke solemnly, “Senior Jian, this has nothing to do with you. You can leave whenever you wish.”

Jian Wudi grunted coldly, “I’m going to interfere in this. Come on! Show me what you’ve got, I’ll deal with it all.”

Mr. Jing’s face fell when he heard this, “While you’re a senior, this is connected to our fate, so if you…”

A sword howl resounded abruptly.

Jian Wudi waved his sword, “Cut the crap. If you want to gang up on me, then do it; if you want a one-on-one fight, then send someone at me. Let me see how strong you juniors are!”

“Let me try your strength!” Suddenly, a voice came from far away in the sky, and then a black shadow crashed down like a shooting star at Jian Wudi.

There was a wave of terrifying fist intent rippling within the shadow!

Monstrous fist intent!

Suddenly, Jian Wudi raised his sword and stabbed it at the black shadow.

Bang!

The black shadow was forced to a stop, and the powerful energy they emanated caused the world to shake violently.

Meanwhile, Jian Wudi tapped his right foot down.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Boom!

The black shadow was blasted away, and then Jian Wudi’s sword shot forward like an arrow.

Hiss!

An arm flew into the air while accompanied by a string of blood.

Jian Wudi waved his right hand, and the fiery red sword returned to his grasp.

Jian Wudi glanced coldly at the ethereal figure before him, “You lack training. Your master should be that fellow, Ju Mang, right? His fist intent was extremely condensed, and he relied on the energy of the world yet transcended its scope. But you haven’t learned any of it well. You’re truly an embarrassment to him.”

“Y-You know my master!” The ethereal figure was astounded.

Jian Wudi replied indifferently, “Do you know how he died?”

The ethereal figure asked solemnly, “How?”

Jian Wudi replied, “I accidentally killed him.”

The ethereal figure’s entire body trembled, “You…”

However, Jian Wudi ignored him and gazed at Mr. Jing, “Anyone else?”

Mr. Jing grinned, “Since you want to play, then we’ll play with you!”

Jian Wudi gazed at Yang Ye, “Didn’t you come here to save people? Go save them. I’ll deal with everything here.”

Yang Ye glanced at him, “Thank you, Martial Ancestor.”

Jian Wudi waved his hand, “You’re Xuanan’s disciple, but you’re not my grand-disciple. Moreover, he and I have severed all ties as master and disciple. So, you’re not my grand-disciple.”

Yang Ye said, “It doesn’t matter if you recognize me. In any case, I recognize you as my martial ancestor.”

As he spoke, Yang Ye vanished with Snowy in his arms.

However, Yang Ye returned just a moment later.

He gazed at Jian Wudi and said, “I’ll be back!”

Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

Mr. Jing glanced at where Yang Ye had vanished toward. Some in the surroundings planned to chase after Yang Ye, but they were stopped by Jian Wudi.

“I didn’t expect him to be your grand-disciple, Senior Jian!” Mr. Jing grinned, “I really didn’t expect that! The world is truly unpredictable! Plans never go smoothly!”

Jian Wudi spoke indifferently, “Just cut the crap and do your worst.”

Mr. Jing looked up at the sky, “Lord Heng, what do you think?”

A moment of silence ensued in the sky, and then a voice resounded, “Allow me to play with you instead, Brother Jian.”

An ink black rule slowly descended from the sky.

Jian Wudi frowned slightly when he saw the ruler, “Heng Wangu, I didn’t expect you to be still alive.”

A chuckle resounded in the sky, “I was lucky enough to survive. Brother Jian, let’s play up here!”

Jian Wudi nodded slightly, “Let’s play then.”

A ray of sword energy shot up into the air.

Once Jian Wudi vanished, Mr. Jing looked up at the direction Yang Ye had vanished toward, “Come with me.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Mr. Jing vanished with the Divine Abode’s master and the others.

…

Meanwhile, once he left the End World, a mysterious black clothed figure appeared before him.

It was one of the experts from the underground trade area!

The black clothed figure spoke solemnly, “The members of the Ancient Sword Sect and your friends are in the Nether World. Their souls are imprisoned. Your eldest sister is there already, and she’s keeping the Nether Lord and Death Lord busy. We must hurry!”

Yang Ye nodded and withdrew the Myriad World Diagram.

Once his strength was at a certain level, he realized that the Myriad World Diagram was truly a precious treasure. Besides extraordinarily mysterious places like the Origin World and End World, it was practically capable of teleporting him everywhere!

A moment later, Yang Ye and the black clothed figure vanished on the spot.

Around 10 minutes later, they appeared in the Nether World!

Rumble!

As soon as they arrived here, rumbling explosions resounded from the distant sky.

Yang Ye gazed at the black clothed figure, and the latter spoke solemnly, “Your eldest sister is in battle with them.”

Yang Ye asked, “Have you found where all of them are being held captive?”

The black clothed figure nodded slightly, “In Nether World’s Soul Prison. Come with me!”

As soon as he said that, the black clothed figure vanished into the distance.

The black clothed figure was so fast that even Yang Ye was almost unable to keep up.

The black clothed figure was very strong!

Yang Ye didn’t give it much thought and just quickly followed after the black clothed figure!

Yang Ye followed the black clothed figure all the way forward, and it didn’t take long for them to arrive underground. After passing through an underground palace, they arrived at an extremely gloomy place.

Dense Death Energy and Yin Energy filled the area!

Yang Ye slowly clenched his fists!

A short while later, they arrived in a black underground hall, and then Yang Ye’s expression instantly changed.

In an instant, he turned completely blood red!

In the black underground hall were many pillars that were covered in blazing flames. At this moment, Nether Maiden, Blood Maiden, and all the others were tied to those pillars, and their bodies had been completely destroyed!

Their souls were almost translucent from being tortured by those flames!
