Chapter 1649 - Kill Them!

Translator: InVader

Three moves? Everyone here was stunned. She intends to kill Yang Lang in three moves after he activated his bloodline?

Needless to say, countless people felt that An Nanjing was exaggerating. If she was at the Zenith Realm, then perhaps they would believe it. However, she wasn’t. She was just at the Rebirth Realm!

As far as they were concerned, besides the top monstrous geniuses throughout the medium universe of Milky Way System, only True Realm experts could use just three moves to kill Yang Lang in his current state.

“Kill me in three moves?” Yang Lang was stunned, and then he roared madly with laughter. He laughed for a while before he said, “Kill me in three moves? How truly laughable! Little Girl, I admit you’re very strong, but killing me in three moves? Not to mention you, even a True Realm expert can’t accomplish that. Are you telling me that you’re stronger than a True Realm expert?”

An Nanjing didn’t waste her breath, and she just took a step forward.

Bang!

As soon as her foot hit the ground, a wave of terrifying intent surged out from within her.

Fist Intent!

Returnal Rank fist intent!

Everyone here was stunned, and then they shook their heads. Even though Returnal Rank fist intent was strong, they felt she was dreaming if she thought she could kill Yang Lang with three moves by relying on that. Not to mention Returnal Rank fist intent, even Zenith Rank fist intent couldn’t accomplish that!

A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of Yang Lang’s mouth, “That’s your trump card?”

An Nanjing didn’t say a word. She just took a second step forward.

Bang!

Another wave of intent surged out from her.

Battle Intent!

Returnal Rank battle intent!

Two Returnal Rank intents!

At this moment, the expressions of countless people had turned slightly solemn. Two types of intents at the Returnal Rank did make her a genius amongst geniuses. However, they didn’t think favorably of her chances. Because Yang Ye had two intents too, and one of them was even at the Zenith Rank.

However, Yang Ye couldn’t use just three moves to kill a Half-Step True Realm expert who’d activated his bloodline!

Yang Lang laughed coldly, “Two types of intents. That’s rare. Do you have more?”

Bang!

Meanwhile, another intent surged out from An Nanjing.

Spear Intent!

Returnal Rank spear intent!

At this moment, countless were visibly moved.

While possessing two types of intents was rare, it wasn’t very rare. Because there were many in the medium universe that had comprehended two types of intent. However, three types of intent was quite rare. After all, countless people couldn’t even comprehend a single intent throughout their lifetimes!

Moreover, even if they comprehended them, it was extremely difficult to improve them. Improving two intents was even more difficult. As for three… The difficulty of that was beyond the imagination of ordinary people.

But at this moment, An Nanjing had three intents at the Returnal Rank!

The smile on the corners of Yang Lang’s face had stiffened.

However, that wasn’t the end of it. Another wave of intent had surged out from An Nanjing.

Palm Intent!

Returnal Rank palm intent!

At this moment, everyone was stunned.

However, two more intents suddenly surged out of her again.

Speed Intent!

Strength Intent!

Both were Returnal Rank intents! Six types of Returnal Rank intents!

At this moment, everyone was flabbergasted. As for Yang Lang, his smile had stiffened completely, and his eyes were filled with disbelief!

Six types of intents!

If three made her a genius amongst geniuses, then six wasn’t something that could be described with just that.

It made her a matchlessly monstrous genius!

A truly matchlessly monstrous genius!

From today onwards, one more person would be added to the ranks of the top monstrous geniuses in the medium universe of Milky Way System!

However, that wasn’t the end of it.

Suddenly, the six intents around her started to merge. In the end, they merged into a completely new intent!

They’d merged!

At this moment, all the spectators were absolutely shocked! It was extremely difficult to merge different types of intents, and it was much more difficult than comprehending and improving them. Because every single intent was unique, so it was obvious how difficult it would be to merge two completely different intents!

As for merging six types, it wasn’t just difficult, it was extremely heaven defying!

Yet now, An Nanjing had merged them together!

Suddenly, An Nanjing stopped moving, and then she turned to look at Yang Ye, “Remember that I told you I hadn’t finished learning a move?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I do. Why? You’ve succeeded?”

She nodded slightly, “I have!”

As she spoke, she took another step forward.

Bang!

The aura of the intent An Nanjing emanated suddenly rose rapidly, and it started growing stronger and stronger!

Crack!

Suddenly, the space in a huge area around her cracked apart!

At this moment, the eyes of everyone here was wide open. It wasn’t just them, even Yang Ye’s eyes were opened wide.

The Zenith Rank!

It had risen to the Zenith Rank!

High above in the sky, Yang Gu gazed at An Nanjing for a long time before he said, “Her natural talent may not be inferior to Lianshuang.”

Yang Ceng nodded, “Indeed!”

Meanwhile, Yang Lang had an absolutely unsightly expression on his face. He knew that he’d encountered a monstrous genius that he usually only heard of.

In this world, there was a type of people that couldn’t be judged by convention. Obviously, An Nanjing was such a person!

Suddenly, An Nanjing tapped the tip of her foot against the ground, and then her figure instantly shot forward like an arrow.

Crack!

Everywhere she passed, space cracked open in an instant, and the powerful aura of the intent she emanated pushed Yang Lang backwards repeatedly.

A vicious gaze flashed through Yang Lang’s eyes as the blood red glow around him grew stronger and stronger. A moment later, he stomped his right foot down and transformed into a blood red bolt of lightning.

Bang!

Space suddenly shook violently as a rumbling explosion resounded through the area, and then a figure was blasted away.

It was Yang Lang’s figure!

Suddenly, An Nanjing tossed Skysplit in Yang Lang’s direction.

The spear was like a golden ray of light that flashed through the area.

Hiss!

It stabbed straight into Yang Lang’s right shoulder, and then the powerful force it carried took Yang Lang along with it as it flew. In the end, it nailed Yang Lang’s figure on the walls of Phecda City.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing tapped her right foot lightly against the space below her, and her figure shot forward like a bolt of lightning. However, right when she approached the city, a green arrow suddenly tore through the air and arrived before her.

An Nanjing’s eyes narrowed slightly, and she slammed her fist forward!

Bang!

The arrow shattered into bits. However, another arrow had appeared in front of her. Moreover, there were eight more arrows behind it. Nine arrows in a straight light! They were like a bolt of green lightning that was striking in An Nanjing’s direction.

An Nanjing didn’t try to dodge, and she just stretched her right hand forward before slamming her palm against the area before her.

A powerful wave of energy sprayed out from her palm.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded. All nine green arrows exploded into bits, but the powerful force of the collision blasted An Nanjing an entire 3km backwards!

Nine arrows that carried the combined strength of nine Zenith Realm experts. The strength of that attack had surpassed even Yang Lang’s strength!

As soon as An Nanjing stopped herself, a spear tore through the air towards her. However, An Nanjing’s expression didn’t change at all as she slammed her fist forward.

Bang!

The spear was blasted flying. Meanwhile, another spear arrived before her. A cold glow flashed through her eyes as her body moved slightly sideway, and then she stretched her right hand forward. Just like that, she caught the spear in her right grasp, and the powerful force within it pushed her backwards repeatedly.

However, she stopped herself after being pushed less than 3m back, and then she spun on the spot before tossing the spear off into the distance.

Over 1km away, the expression of a man in golden armor changed, and he quickly stretched his right hand out. Just like An Nanjing had done, he grabbed the spear in midair. However, as soon as he did that, his expression changed drastically because the powerful force within it caused his arm to instantly crack open!

The spear continued forward and stabbed into his chest. But it merely went less than five centimeters into him before it stopped. Because he’d grabbed tightly onto the spear with his other hand.

However, the powerful force it carried still blasted him away. He flew for over 3km before he finally stopped himself, but even then, his figure was still being pushed backwards repeatedly, and he only stopped when he collided with the city walls. But at this moment, the spear had pierced through his body and nailed him on the wall!

After she tossed that spear, An Nanjing leaped forward and charged towards Yang Lang. However, it only took a moment for nine men in gold armor to obstruct her path, and then nine spears stabbed forward in unison.

Bang!

The joint forces of those nine men blasted An Nanjing around 3km backwards again. Meanwhile, they were about to attack again, but a sword howl suddenly resounded, and then a ray of light entered the group of nine.

Boom!

As soon as the ray of light descended to the ground, it instantly transformed into a ray of blood red light, and then a wave of powerful slaughter intent blasted them an entire 300m back.

An Nanjing walked over to Yang Ye’s side, and then she waved her hand.

Swish!

Skysplit shot out of the city wall and transformed into a ray of golden light that flew into An Nanjing’s grasp. After that, she gazed at Yang Ye, “What shall we do?”

Yang Ye looked up at those 23 warriors of the Yang Clan and said, “Kill them!”
