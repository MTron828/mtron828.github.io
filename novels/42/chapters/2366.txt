Chapter 2367 – Ascension Platform

Feeding his sword with his own blood!

Blood surged incessantly from Yang Ye’s wrist into Sword Spirit.

In just a short while, Yang Ye had turned pale.

Meanwhile, Sword Spirit took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye before going down to the river’s bottom.

Yang Ye lowered his hand.

He knew she wanted to grow stronger and continue fighting by his side, and he wanted the same!

Regardless of whether it was the Sword Supreme, Primordial Axe of Creation, or any other weapon, they weren’t as important as the Sword Precursor to him. It had been by his side throughout his life, and it was the only sword who was willing to become a sword of slaughter for him.

As for why he hadn’t been using her lately, it wasn’t because he felt she was too weak, he was protecting her instead.

His enemies were much, much stronger than him, and the slightest mistake may lead to her death.

Just like when he was against the founding ancestor of the Immortal Estate, both the Sword Supreme and Invincible had almost been destroyed!

Now, the Sword Spirit had an opportunity to grow stronger, so he naturally intended to help her the best he could!

In the river, the blood was gradually vanishing.

Yang Ye walked over to Nanli Meng, and she spoke softly, “This river of blood isn’t ordinary!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she spoke softly, “It’s the blood of experts! In the past, countless experts perished in this battlefield, and their blood converged into a river. Since this blood remained after so many years, it proved how powerful their former owners were. Your saber and sword will benefit tremendously. Of course, it’s the same for you!”

Suddenly, Snowy waved her paw at Sword Spirit. Nanli Meng gazed at Snowy while the latter grinned at Sword Spirit and blew.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

A strand of pure spirit energy surged into the bottom of the river, and then the entire river started to surge.

Snowy didn’t stop and ceaselessly sent more into her.

Nanli Meng had a wisp of shock in her eyes, “Sprite Ascension!”

Everything had its own spirit, and it could be improved, of course. However, most had to rely on themselves to gradually accomplish that. In other words, via cultivation. But Snowy was forcefully accomplishing that!

Needless to say, it was heaven defying!

Meanwhile, the blood within the river was still vanishing, and a long time passed before all of it vanished. A sword and a saber shot up into the air from the bottom of the river.

In an instant, the sky was blood red.

Yang Ye stretched out his hand, and a saber appeared in his grasp.

It was Invincible!

At this moment, it was vastly different from before. Its body was blood red, and a casual swing carried monstrous blood red mist. Besides that, holding it felt like he was holding a volcano, a volcano that was about to erupt, and the powerful energy it contained made even his heart palpitate slightly!

A Divine Treasure!

After absorbing the blood in the river, Invincible had finally stopped being a Pseudo Divine Treasure.

Yang Ye put it away and looked up, a blood red woman was walking over through the sky.

It was Sword Spirit!

Blood red hair, a blood red dress, and like a demon from hell. However, in Yang Ye’s eyes, she seemed so familiar and close. Because this demon had only become like this for him.

Sword Spirit walked over to Yang Ye, and she touched his face gently. Sword Spirit cracked a smile, but it was quite a horrifying smile. She seemed to have thought of something at this point and gazed at Snowy. The latter blinked while a smile appeared on her little face.

Sword Spirit!

Snowy and Zi’er were the first to join Yang Ye, then it was Sword Spirit. It could be said that they were the earliest to join Yang Ye’s group. While Snowy hadn’t really come into contact with Sword Spirit much, she still treated Sword Spirit as a friend. So, while Sword Spirit was completely blood red, Snowy didn’t fear her at all.

Sword Spirit grinned, “Thank you!”

Snowy waved her paw to display that it wasn’t necessary.

Yang Ye smiled, and then he took Sword Spirit’s hand. In an instant, Sword Spirit vanished, and a sword appeared in Yang Ye’s grasp. It seemed like a sword made of blood! Moreover, as soon as he held it, the remaining blood in his body started to surge. Besides that, he had a strange feeling like the sword was a part of him!

Nanli Meng smiled, “Congratulations, two Divine Treasures!”

Yang Ye glanced at her and put Sword Spirit back into the Primordial Pagoda. Both she and the Sword Supreme had their own territory on Void Mountain. After all, they weren’t ordinary swords.

The Sword Precursor arrived on the mountain where the Sword Supreme was, and the two of them exchanged glances from afar. A moment later, two rays of light flashed.

One good, one evil!

Sparring!

Yang Ye didn’t pay any further attention to them because their spar would be beneficial to both of them.

Outside the pagoda, Yang Ye spoke softly, “Let’s go!”

Nanli Meng nodded, and they walked toward the river.

At the end of the river was a huge circular platform that was over 3km wide and 1km tall, and there were countless mysterious symbols inscribed on it.

Nanli Meng stared at it, “If I’m not wrong, it should be an Ascension Platform from the Primal Era!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “An Ascension Platform?”

She nodded slightly, “You’re from a small world, so you should know that when many experts reach a certain level, they choose to break through the barriers of the world and rise to a higher plane.”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “Those experts from the Primal Era wanted to ascend to the Eternal Dimension?”

She fell silent for a long time and replied, “Maybe not.”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “What do you mean?”

Nanli Meng shook her head, “The history of that time is too vague. What kind of era was it, what caused the battle, who was the enemy? All of these are still a mystery!”

Yang Ye glanced at the platform, hesitated for a moment, and asked, “What can it do?”

She replied indifferently, “It’s very useful to extraordinary experts, but as for you, it’s probably useless. Because you’re too weak and can’t use it at all.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Nanli Meng was about to speak when Yang Ye waved his right hand, and he moved the huge platform into the Primordial Pagoda.

Nanli Meng felt speechless.

It had been moved to a small mountain on Void Mountain Range!

Actually, Yang Ye didn’t think too much about it and just felt that it was very imposing. However, he didn’t know that this small action of his would bring endless trouble to him in the future.

There was good trouble and bad trouble, of course.

“Are you a bandit?!” Nanli Meng walked over to him and stared at Yang Ye. She may be greedy for wealth too, but she had her principles. But Yang Ye was a complete and utter bandit!

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “In any case, no one wants it, so it doesn’t matter that I want it, right?”

She withdrew her gaze and replied indifferently, “Don’t blame me for not warning you. Everything in this world, and especially Divine Treasures, come with karma. You may be fine now, but it doesn’t mean that you’ll be fine in the future.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Thank you for the reminder.”

He glanced at Snowy and continued, “Will there be any karma if she takes them?”

Snowy blinked. Karma? Is that delicious?

The corners of Nanli Meng’s eyes twitched. What kind of karma would a Sprite Progenitor suffer from? Of course, there would be karma, but it would be good karma.

It was like after an ugly man saved a beautiful woman, the woman would only thank him at most. However, if it was a handsome man, she may get together with him.

Good or bad karma depended on the person!

Nanli Meng shook her head, “Fine, you win.”

Of course she understood what Yang Ye meant. Snowy would take the karma of all those treasures, and he would take Snowy’s karma. Simply speaking, he’d taken the greatest karma, so why would he worry about smaller ones like that?

They continued forward, and it didn’t take long for them to arrive at a mountain. It was a boundless mountain range that stood before them, and two towering mountains were not too far away from them. The towering mountains were like a gateway that kept all outsiders away.

They exchanged glances and were about to head inside. Suddenly, Nanli Meng’s expression changed drastically, and she grabbed Yang Ye’s shoulder and flashed over 300m away!

Bang!

Right after they flashed away from there, a huge hole appeared where they’d been standing. Within it was a pitch black axe.

Yang Ye and Nanli Meng looked up, and the two mountains had suddenly started moving slowly in their direction. It didn’t take long for the ground to start quaking.

Between the two mountains, a headless man walked out slowly from behind them. Every step he took made the ground and the mountains tremble.

He wore armor, was headless, held a huge axe in his right grasp, and was covered in injuries.

Yang Ye and Nanli Meng exchanged glances. Suddenly, the headless man leaped up, and it made their expressions changed drastically. They retreated again, and as soon as they did, an axe descended to the ground.

Boom!

The ground collapsed!

Yang Ye nudged Nanli Meng and said, “Senior, it’s time for you to put on a display of your strength.”

Nanli Meng gazed at the headless man, nodded, and then withdrew a white leaf. Right when Yang Ye thought she was about to fight the headless man, Nanli Meng vanished soundlessly.

She’d vanished without making a sound!

Yang Ye was stunned on the spot!

Because he couldn’t sense her aura at all, not even a little!

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something at this point, and his expression changed drastically. He cursed, “Damn you! You…”

Yang Ye’s voice stopped abruptly because the headless man was in front of him, and the huge axe which seemed capable of splitting the world arrived with him!
