Chapter 1884 – You Can’t!

How do you want to die!

As soon as he finished speaking, a man in green clothes and a woman in a green dress appeared. The man couldn’t be described as handsome, but his face was angled, and he had a sharp gaze. Besides that, he had a wild and unrestrained bearing.

The woman wore a green dress. Her beautiful long hair hung down to her shoulders, and she was gorgeous. She was the type of woman that was unforgettable with just a single glance.

They were Yang Ye and Su Qingshi.

Yang Ye!

The surroundings suddenly fell silent.

Yang Ye was an absolute taboo in Heaven Pillar Mountain. No one dared to rashly offend him. Not to mention that he had the holy sword in his possession, even if he had even better treasures, there would still be no one who dared to act against him!

But even though no one down here dared to offend him, the people from the upper universe did!

Many experts took pleasure in the golden armored man’s misfortune.

“Dad!” Meanwhile, a clear and melodious voice broke the silence, and then a petite figure flew into Yang Ye’s arms.

Bao’er and Lei Lin walked over to Yang Ye as well. But at this moment, Bao’er seemed quite careful. Obviously, she knew that she’d caused trouble. As for Lei Lin, she didn’t think too much about it. She just took Yang Ye’s hand while a brilliant smile appeared on her face.

As he gazed at her, everything he intended to reproach them with vanished without a trace.

Actually, he was mainly responsible for it all.

Suddenly, Su Qingshi said, “Come here!”

Xue’er stuck out her tongue at Yang Ye when she heard Su Qingshi, and then she obediently went over to Su Qingshi’s side. Su Qingshi rarely spoke, but Yang Nianxue knew her mother’s temper very well. She knew that if her mother got angry, then the consequence would be extremely severe.

Su Qingshi glanced at Xue’er, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “Be careful!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he looked up at the armored man, “The Sovereign of Man sent you?”

The man in golden armor sized up Yang Ye and said, “No wonder the last person we sent was killed. Needless to say, your strength really isn’t bad.”

Yang Ye asked, “You didn’t come all the way here to praise me, right?”

The armored man’s gaze gradually became icy cold, “Yang Ye, hand over the holy sword and I’ll leave your corpse intact. Alright?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “I thought you were only here for the sword. I didn’t expect you to want the sword and my life!”

The man replied, “You haven’t just cultivated an evil cultivation technique, you’ve cultivated the techniques of the shaman race. In the upper universe, you’re considered as having openly betrayed the human race. Even a million deaths wouldn’t be enough…”

Yang Ye suddenly waved his hand, “Allow me to be honest. What I learn is none of the Sovereign of Man’s fucking business! So, let’s cut the crap. I’ll separate your head from your body right now!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a ray of light flashed beneath his feet, and then he vanished on the spot. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Bang!

Everyone hadn’t even been able to see his movements clearly when the armored man was blasted 3km away. When the spectators finally reacted, countless rays of light had suddenly appeared around the man. They were extremely swift and simply impossible to catch with the eye!

At this moment, the man in golden armor was beyond shocked.

Astounded!

Yang Ye’s strength had completely surpassed his expectations. At this moment, he didn’t dare look down on Yang Ye at all. He immediately waved his right hand, and a talisman floated out of his palm. The talisman trembled slightly, and a small golden character flashed out from it.

‘镇’!

Once the ‘镇’ character appeared, the rays of light which had just arrived before the armored man were instantly blasted into bits.

A wisp of surprise flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes when he noticed this. What the heck is that?

“Be careful!” Meanwhile, the Ancient Emperor appeared by Yang Ye’s side, “It was given to him by the Sovereign of Man. It’s very strong. Don’t be careless!”

The Sovereign of Man gave it to him! Yang Ye nodded. He was about to speak when the ‘镇’ character shot towards him.

Yang Ye didn’t dare to act carelessly. His profound energy surged before he tapped his finger forward.

Sword Point!

Boom!

Yang Ye’s hand shook violently while his figure was blasted over 1km away. As for the small ‘镇’ character, it was blasted away as well.

The armored man’s face fell. He hadn’t expected it to actually be blasted away by Yang Ye.

He’d underestimated Yang Ye!

He’d severely underestimated Yang Ye!

The armored man gazed at Yang Ye. He was about to speak when Yang Ye said, “I’m not interested in hearing your nonsense!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a sword appeared beneath his feet, and then a ray of light flashed.

The armored man’s expression changed drastically. He was about to attack when a mysterious wave of energy appeared around him. As soon as that happened, Yang Ye’s sword energy suddenly sped up!

At this moment, there was only a single thought left in the man’s mind.

I’m finished!

Sure enough, he was.

A breath of time later, everything returned to normal. Everyone watched as the man’s head fell off his neck, and blood sprayed like a fountain while his head rolled on the ground.

In an instant, the surroundings fell silent!

It was deathly silent!

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the spatial ring on the man’s finger flew into his grasp. He ignored everyone here and gazed at the Ancient Emperor, “Thank you!”

The Ancient Emperor glanced at Yang Ye and smiled, “It was nothing.”

Yang Ye smiled. He was just about to speak when Bao’er suddenly said, “Little Laborer, someone sold us out just now. He told that man in golden armor to capture us!”

Yang Ye’s gaze instantly turned icy cold. He knew that countless people in Heaven Pillar Mountain wanted to see him die but having such a desire and acting on it were two completely different things. He didn’t mind if they had such desires, but he minded if they acted upon them. Especially when it affected Xue’er and the others!

It was something he absolutely couldn’t tolerate!

Yang Ye looked up at the sky and spoke coldly, “What? You don’t dare to take responsibility for what you did?”

Two breaths of time later, a black robed man appeared near Yang Ye.

“I didn’t expect you to have reached such a level!” said the black robed man, and his voice carried a trace of helplessness.

Bao’er pointed at the black robed man, “It’s him!”

Even though she didn’t recognize the man, she still remembered his voice.

The black robed man said, “Yang Ye, do you know why I did this? Because…”

Suddenly, a ray of light flashed.

The black robed man’s figure stiffened. A short while later, a gust of wind blew by, and the man’s head fell off his neck.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Sorry, I don’t want to know!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took Bao’er and Lei Lin’s hands before turning around and walking away.

A sigh suddenly resounded, “You reap what you sow…”

…

There were four more people in the Primordial Pagoda now, and it was Su Qingshi, Bao’er, Lei Lin, and Xue’er.

Snowy, Lei Lin, and the others were old friends, so they immediately started playing together. Moreover, Snowy was very generous and allowed Yang Nianxue and Lei Lin to play with the two swords.

The happiest person here was Yang Nianxue because she used the sword too, and both the swords gave Snowy face and allowed her to use them.

As he watched the children play, a rare smile curled up on Yang Ye’s face.

Su Qingshi spoke softly by his side, “We have to keep an eye on them from now on!”

Yang Ye nodded and asked, “Qingshi, Xue’er has started training with the sword?”

Su Qingshi nodded slightly, and then she took Yang Ye’s hand, “You know… She really looks up to you. Especially now.”

“She looks up to me?” Yang Ye was slightly stunned, “Why?”

“You’re strong!” Su Qingshi grinned, “She kept telling me about what happened all along the way. She said whenever she encountered danger, she just had to say your name, and then no one would dare to harm them. It was even to the extent that those people would apologize to them!”

Yang Ye couldn’t help but shake his head and smile. Actually, Xue’er and the others wouldn’t have been so lucky if they’d come a little sooner. Because if they’d come then, her father wasn’t that strong yet. As for now, there weren’t many throughout Heaven Pillar Mountain who dared to intentionally offend him.

As for the ancient cultivators, he believed that even if they had ill intent, they wouldn’t use Xue’er and the others to deal with him.

The stronger a person was, the prouder that person would be, and they would never resort to such shameless things.

On the contrary, it was the weak who would act unscrupulously!

Meanwhile, Su Qingshi said, “They may not want to go back anymore!”

Yang Ye glanced at Yang Nianxue and the others, and then he smiled, “Why should they go back?”

As he spoke, he took Su Qingshi’s hand and spoke softly, “I’ve thought it through. I want all of you to stay with me this time. No matter what happens, we’ll face it together as a family. Alright?”

Su Qingshi’s delicate figure trembled slightly, and then she hugged Yang Ye, “Alright!”

Actually, she understood why Yang Ye didn’t take them with him in the past. Because staying with Yang Ye was much more dangerous. However, Yang Ye may not be aware that she actually really wanted to go with him. She wanted to face everything with him.

Because at the very least, she wouldn’t have to live in worry and anxiety every day!

Suddenly, Xue’er ran over to Yang Ye and grabbed his hand, “Dad, teach me that move you used just now. Alright?”

Yang Ye rubbed Xue’er’s head, and then he smiled, “Which move?”

Xue’er spoke with excitement, “That move you used to instantly kill the man in golden armor!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Snowy suddenly appeared before him with a sword in her arms, and then she just gazed at him. She didn’t wave her claws, but her intent was absolutely obvious.

She wanted to learn too!

That was what she meant!

“You can’t!” Suddenly, two voices resounded.

These two voices belonged to Qiong Qi and Hou Qing.
