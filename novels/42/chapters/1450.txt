Chapter 1451 – Try To Stop Me And I’ll Kill You!

Pity filled the eyes of both the Celestial Demon Wolves as they gazed at the beast which was roaring madly. At the same time, they continued their retreat.

Meanwhile, the beast grew even more mad and arrogant when it noticed that.

Suddenly, a wave of invisible force pressed down from the sky.

Big Blackie and Little Blackie’s expressions changed when they sensed the energy. They took the initiative to lie down on the ground while fear filled their eyes.

The energy descended extremely swiftly, and it pressed down upon the beast before it could even react.

Bang!

The beast was instantly pressed down on the ground, and then....

Crack! Crack! Crack!

Numerous clear and resounding sounds of bones being dislocated resounded!

Roar! Roar! Roar!

The beast roared incessantly with misery and pain. However, the force didn’t vanish, and it pressed down incessantly upon the beast. Not only did its body start to shiver with pain, even its face had started to warp severely.

However, the force still hadn’t vanished, and it was even growing stronger.

In the end, the beast wasn’t even able to let out a shrill cry.

It wouldn’t be so bad if it was killed in an instant. Unfortunately, even though the force made it experience extreme pain, the injuries it suffered weren’t lethal.

That was the most painful part!

The beast wanted to beg for mercy, it really did! However, it wasn’t even able to do that.

Meanwhile, the demon wolves moved further back, and their eyes were filled with fear. Actually, the pain they suffered that day was comparatively mild. Especially when compared with this beast. The pain they suffered that day was really quite mild.

Actually, it was quite normal. They hadn’t even had the chance to do anything before the Primordial Pagoda had suppressed them that day.

But this beast had been acting so arrogantly and even seemed like it intended to destroy this world. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Wasn’t that like expressing contempt towards the Primordial Pagoda?

After all, even Yang Ye, the owner of the Primordial Pagoda, didn’t dare act disrespectfully towards it. Yet that beast had actually acted so arrogantly! So, wasn’t it courting death?

Suddenly, a clone of Yang Ye appeared within the Primordial Pagoda.

Why did he send a clone in? It was naturally because he didn’t dare to enter the Primordial Pagoda with his actual body. After all, the mysterious woman was still somewhere near him.

Once Yang Ye’s clone arrived before the beast, the mysterious energy which suppressed it vanished in an instant.

Yang Ye shot a glance up into the air. The Primordial Pagoda had never conversed with him, but it was always helping him. It was helping him in all aspects. Moreover, it even had some tacit understanding with him. Just like this very moment, he was very well aware that besides for the sake of punishing the beast, the Primordial Pagoda had acted against the beast for another reason, and it was to help him subdue that beast.

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and looked at the beast. At this moment, it was on the verge of death. Moreover, its body was twitching incessantly. I seemed truly pitiable!

Fortunately, it was still alive.

Yang Ye looked it in the eyes and said, “Submit to me. Agree and this will be over; refuse and you can stay here.”

It was simple and direct!

He didn’t have the time to waste on the beast. As far as he was concerned, the beast could either submit or die.

The beast opened its eyes and gazed at Yang Ye. At this moment, the ferocity and viciousness in its eyes were gone, and there was only weakness and fear left within them.

Yang Ye asked, “Have you made your decision?”

It gazed at Yang Ye in silence.

Yang Ye nodded, “I admire your unyielding spirit. Then just stay here!”

As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, he turned around and started walking away!

Suddenly, a low cry came from the beast.

Yang Ye’s lips immediately curled up into an arc. Actually, it was within his expectations. Because he knew that the beast would be absolutely unwilling to stay in the Primordial Pagoda.

The Primordial Pagoda’s ability to deter beasts was absolutely horrifying!

Amongst all the beasts he knew, only Zi’er wasn’t afraid of it. After all, she’d occupied the pool of profound energy within the tiny vortex. Actually, the Primordial Pagoda didn’t act against Zi’er solely because of Yang Ye, and Yang Ye was able to sense that the Primordial Pagoda seemed to have a good impression of Zi’er. As for the reason, it was naturally because the Primordial Pagoda, Zi’er, and him had been together from the most difficult periods in their lives.

Simply speaking, they’d gone through thick and thin together!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, turned to look at the beast, and then stretched out his hand, “A strand of your soul.”

The beast had clearly expected this. Even though it was absolutely unwilling, it still handed over a strand of its soul. Once he took the strand of soul, Yang Ye started questioning the beast.

He had to pass through this place to get to the Forest of Darkness, and if he wanted to get through this place, then he had to gain a thorough understanding of this place and the dangers within it!

A long time passed before Yang Ye gained a clear understanding of the situation.

This place was called Monkey Mountain. As for how huge it was, even the beast before him didn’t know. Because it didn’t dare to go too far away from its territory. Most beasts in the Ominous Territory had their own territory. If other beasts entered their territory, they would treat it as provocation and attack right away.

Yang Ye had entered its territory earlier, and that was why it had attacked. It was the same for his battle at Rock Mountain.

It was a taboo to enter another’s territory here!

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time.

He found out from the beast that Monkey Mountain was divided into three parts. The abyss was its base, this beast’s territory was its center, and there was one more part above its territory, the peak of Monkey Mountain. The beast didn’t know what was down within the abyss. Similarly, it didn’t know what resided at the peak.

Because it had never headed down the abyss, nor had it gone up.

Since it was born, it had never left its territory. It was part of the ancestral teachings that had been passed down to it.

Yang Ye asked about the cave, and the beast’s reply made Yang Ye’s face turn quite unsightly. According to what it said, Yang Ye should absolutely not head in there because it was very dangerous. What was in there? Even the beast didn’t know. It had tried to enter the cave once, but it had merely arrived at the entrance when something tried to drag it into the cave.

If it didn’t possess some ability, it would have lost its life.

Yang Ye pointed at himself, pointed at the demon wolves, and then pointed at the beast, “Can we go in if all four of us work together?”

The beast glanced at them, and then it shook its head.

Yang Ye felt speechless.

How strong were their joint forces? However, the beast actually said that they couldn’t enter the cave.

Is the thing within the cave even stronger than all four of us?

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then he took a deep breath and said, “We have two choices now. The first is to go over the mountain, and the second is to go through the cave. You choose.”

The beast remained silent.

As far as Yang Ye was concerned, he was here, so he had to see it through.

He couldn’t just turn around and leave, right?

There were definitely countless difficulties to face in life. If he were to stop upon encountering difficulty, then wouldn’t he be going around in circles throughout his life?

He was a man! So, he decided to face the difficulty before him!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye continued, “We must go forward, so you choose. You have to choose!”

The beast still remained silent.

“You refuse to choose?” Yang Ye said, “Fine, then we’ll go over the mountain.”

Yang Ye would rather go over the mountain than go through the dark cave. Because who knew what sort of monster was hiding in there?

However, the beast suddenly shook its head and started waving its claw.

Yang Ye frowned, “The cave?”

The beast nodded.

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to come to an understanding. According to the best, the cave was comparatively safer. As for why it was safer, it was the beast’s instinct. It felt that the cave was slightly safer.

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time before he nodded, “Recuperate for now. We’ll set out once you’ve recovered.”

The intuition of man might be wrong, but the intuition of such beasts was practically never wrong. Especially when it came to danger. If they felt it was dangerous, then it was definitely dangerous.

So, he’d decided to listen to it.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye opened his eyes in the outside world, and then he glanced at the surroundings. It was deathly silent, but he knew that the mysterious woman was definitely still here.

Actually, if she was willing to help, then it would definitely be much easier for him to get to the Forest of Darkness. However, he could only think about such a thing. After all, he should be thankful so long as she didn’t kill him.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground and started to absorb the energy within the divine crystals he’d placed around him.

Earlier, he’d given that beast a name, and it was Eaglet.

He’d exhausted some profound energy during the battle with Eaglet, and he’d even suffered some injuries. So, he had to recover all his profound energy and heal himself.

Yang Ye wasn’t the only one. Eaglet had to recover from its injuries as well. Fortunately, he had Primordial Violet Energy, so both his injuries and Eaglet’s injuries were being healed at a rapid pace.

Two hours later, both of them had recovered to their peak states, and then Yang Ye summoned Eaglet, Big Blackie, and Little Blackie.

Not too far away from the cave.

Yang Ye, Big Blackie, Little Blackie, and Eaglet had solemn expressions on their faces.

Eaglet turned to look at Yang Ye, and then it started waving its claw.

It was asking if he really intended to head in there.

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth curled up into an arc, “Of course!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he drew his sword and swung it. A beam of sword energy shot out from the ancient sheath and struck against the entrance of the cave.

At the same time, Yang Ye’s ghastly voice resounded, “I, Yang Ye, am going to pass through today. I’ll kill anyone who tries to stop me!”

Eaglet was at a loss for words.
