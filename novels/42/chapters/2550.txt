Chapter 2551

Once he left the Lu Clan, Yang Ye didn’t return to the Ancient Sword Sect immediately. He found a place to recuperate first.

He’d suffered severe injuries during the battle with the old man. Especially when he used those secret techniques. Presently, he needed some time to recover and return to his peak.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye went over to Oblivion Maiden. At this moment, her injuries were almost fully healed by the Primordial Violet Energy, and even the fox was healed.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that they were fine.

All that mattered was that they were safe and well!

If something had happened to them, then not to mention explaining it to Nether Maiden and the others, he couldn’t even let it go himself!

Once she saw Yang Ye, she asked, “I didn’t cause trouble. I asked about your whereabouts when I arrived in that city, and then one guy came before me and spoke rudely…”

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “There’s no need to explain.”

She gazed at him, and he smiled, “All that matters is you’re alright!”

She nodded slightly and didn’t say anything else.

After chatting with her for some time, Yang Ye returned to his cultivation room and started to recuperate.

He was covered in injuries from the battle!

It wasn’t just his body, even his soul was severely injured after using those two secret techniques.

But Yang Ye had gained a lot from the battle too.

These ancient clans really did have numerous powerful experts!

And the Soul Sect was on par with them, so it represented that the Soul Sect definitely had experts stronger than that old man from the Lu Clan, and there may even be much stronger experts too!

But he was the strongest in the Ancient Sword Sect for now!

Once he fell, the Ancient Sword Sect would probably be crushed!

It was a difficult situation!

Yang Ye shook his head and stopped thinking about these things. He just focused on recuperating, and it took him around two hours to fully recuperate with the help of Primordial Violet Energy.

Once he was done, Yang Ye left the pagoda and shot into the sky!

This time, he kept a very low profile and used his Sword Domain to conceal his aura.

Yang Ye shot through the sky on his sword.

At the moment he left the East Region, something unexpected happened. The space around him suddenly turned ethereal.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly from the sight of this. The Sword Gourd trembled by his waist, and then two flying swords shot out and criss crossed through the area!

However, such powerful flying swords were blasted back by some unknown force!

A short while later, the surroundings turned gray and boundless!

The space here had been enveloped by a huge barrier!

Yang Ye withdrew the Universe Seal and was about to use it when two black robed figures appeared before him.

There was strange black energy flowing around them!

If one looked carefully, one would notice that the energy was actually souls, souls that had been compressed!

Experts of the Soul Sect!

Yang Ye sized up both of them and said, “Fight me one on one if you dare!”

Meanwhile, one of them stepped back, and he appeared 3km away!

Yang Ye was stunned, “You’re really planning on fighting me one on one?”

The black robed man before Yang Ye raised his right hand slightly, causing countless strands of black energy to shoot out from his palm. These strands of black energy were like venomous snakes that shot at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye had a solemn expression on his face because he noticed that they were actually numerous souls!

Controlling souls?

Yang Ye didn’t dare to act carelessly against this attack. He patted the Sword Gourd lightly, and then two rays of sword energy immediately shot out from it. Actually, it was three swords, but one of them was invisible!

The swords arrived before the black energy, but they were instantly corroded by the souls on contact! Moreover, the swords were bound by the black energy and were immobilized!

The link between Yang Ye and the swords had been cut off!

A moment later, the black energy arrived before Yang Ye. This time, he saw it even more clearly than before. There were numerous souls within the black energy!

It really was souls that were being controlled!

Yang Ye took a small step back and swung his sword!

It was Executor!

As soon as his attack descended, the black energy at the front of the group was sliced into countless pieces. At the same time, Yang Ye used the Soul Devouring Technique to absorb all the fragments!

Meanwhile, the black robed man vanished on the spot.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Horrifying hissing resounded abruptly!

Yang Ye was shocked and tried to flash backward, but it was too late!

Bang!

Yang Ye’s figure curved forward as it was blasted away! As soon as he stopped himself, the space around him cracked open, and then black strands of energy floated out from there and instantly enveloped him.

Devouring!

The black energy wasn’t trying to devour his body, it was trying to devour his soul!

It targeted the soul!

At this moment, Yang Ye felt like his soul was about to leave his body. He was no soul cultivator, so once his soul left the body, his combat strength would drop drastically! Moreover, that wasn’t the most important issue, the most important issue was that once he was in his soul form, his soul would be instantly devoured by the black energy!

Yang Ye hurriedly calmed his heart and mind before activating the Sword Domain!

As soon as the Sword Domain appeared, the black energy around him instantly slowed down!

He was forcefully suppressing them!

Yang Ye grabbed this opportunity to swing Executor madly within the Sword Domain, and every single swing would slice open a strand of black energy!

These strands of black energy weren’t ordinary, but his sword was even more extraordinary!

It could be said that if he didn’t have Executor, he wouldn’t be able to slice up these souls with such ease!

But he had such a Super Divine Treasure!

So, not to mention souls, he could even slice up divine treasures!

Soul after soul was being blasted apart within Yang Ye’s Sword Domain, and every single destroyed soul was absorbed by Yang Ye’s Soul Devouring Technique! Yang Ye was overjoyed by the purity of these souls. If he absorbed more of them, they wouldn’t just greatly improve his soul, they would even be sufficient to help him attain the Five World Realm!

However, he’d clearly gotten ahead of himself!

The black robed man suddenly transformed into a ball of energy that vanished on the spot, and then countless strands of black energy filled the space within Yang Ye’s Sword Domain.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Terrifying strands of energy erupted like a volcano within Yang Ye’s Sword Domain!

The powerful force of it instantly brought Yang Ye’s Sword Domain to the verge of destruction!

Yang Ye was stunned and hurriedly dispersed the Sword Domain before moving 300m back. At this moment, his countenance was pale while blood was flowing from the corner of his mouth!

The black robed man didn’t stop attacking. He transformed into a ray of dark light that shot at Yang Ye.

Everywhere it passed, space started burning and was obliterated.

Moreover, strands of black energy soundlessly appeared all around Yang Ye and shot at him like venomous snakes!

A vicious glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, and then a powerful aura swept out from him!

A secret technique!

Flash!

At the same time, the blood vessels beneath his skin slowly started to tremble, and then powerful waves of Bloodline Energy condensed around him!

Bloodline Energy!

This time, Yang Ye wasn’t holding back at all!

This fellow before him could even shatter his Sword Domain, so the black robed man’s strength was definitely stronger than the old man from the Lu Clan!

Once his bloodline was activated, the powerful aura Yang Ye emanated wasn’t comparable to the Four World Realm at all. At this moment, his aura was comparable to the Lord Realm!

Moreover, Yang Ye used Flash once more!

Hiss!

Yang Ye instantly vanished on the spot, and then a ray of sword energy flashed!

Fast!

It was a few times faster than before!

It was so fast that even the black robed man was fearful of it!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

As these rays of sword energy flashed, it seemed like something was being sliced apart into bits all around here!

It was the souls and the ethereal space here!

it didn’t take long for the souls to be sliced into bits, and the space here was on the verge of shattering…

As for the black robed man, he didn’t attack again and just moved 1km back!

The black robed man hadn’t chosen to go head-on against Yang Ye’s sword energy and had chosen to temporarily avoid it instead!

He didn’t fear Yang Ye’s own strength, but he had to fear the sword in Yang Ye’s grasp!

It was a Super Divine Treasure! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Just like that, Yang Ye sliced apart all the souls in front of him and destroyed the barrier around him by force. Moreover, he’d even retrieved his 3 swords in the process!

Yang Ye and the two black robed men returned to the outside world!

After they returned to the outside world, the black robed man thought Yang Ye would continue attacking, and so he remained absolutely vigilant. However, Yang Ye didn’t attack. Yang Ye just transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky!

With the help of Flash, Yang Ye’s speed was much faster than a Lord Realm expert!

Both the black robed men were stunned!

He's gone?

He fled?!

As far as Yang Ye was concerned, he naturally had to flee. If he was no match for them, he naturally had to flee… The facts proved that he had no chance of winning against them. Not to mention both of them, he didn’t even have a chance against one of them!

Being no match for his opponent wasn’t embarrassing!

But forcefully trying to fight a battle that could not be won wasn’t just a loss of face, it would lead to a loss of life!

Yang Ye had decisively chosen to flee!

As for the two black robed men, they were stunned on the spot.

Didn’t they say he’s a tough and hotblooded guy?

He actually fled?
