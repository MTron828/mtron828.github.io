Chapter 2745 – The Most Suitable Sword!

Order!

Yang Ye couldn’t help but sigh with emotion in his heart.

Regardless of whether it was the three swords of Destiny or the Sword Supreme which had been with him for some time, all of them didn’t truly belong to him!

Only the Sword Precursor was Yang Ye’s true sword.

If he was a good person, it would be a righteous sword; and if he was a demon, it would be a demonic sword!

The swords of Destiny and the Sword Supreme were only following Yang Ye, and they weren’t truly his.

They belonged to their former masters, and they followed their former master’s Sword Dao.

The swords and his Dao did not conform to each other!

That was the problem he was facing right now! The real reason why Heaven Executor had betrayed him in the past was because it didn’t really belong to him. The Sword Dao Heaven Executor pursued conflicted with Yang Ye’s Sword Dao.

Once a sword was at a certain level, it pursued its own goals. It was why at most times, it wasn’t just the person who chose a sword, the sword chose its master too!

Fortunately, he’d realized that!

Yang Ye didn’t abandon the other swords. He gazed at them, “No matter who you once belonged to, all I want to know is if you're willing to let me be your master from now on?”

He had to organize all his swords properly now.

A short while later, the Sword Supreme entered Yang Ye’s forehead.

She’d been with Yang Ye the longest besides the Sword Precursor. Throughout these years, Yang Ye hadn’t done anything vile, and now, what he wanted to do would be beneficial to the world.

So, she chose to follow him.

Truly follow him!

Once it entered his forehead, Yang Ye’s body shook, and then he could truly and clearly sense the Sword Supreme in its entirety, including its thoughts. Similarly, the Sword Supreme could sense Yang Ye’s thoughts, his truest thoughts!

It was like a heart to heart!

Yang Ye gazed at the remaining swords. A short while later, the three swords of Destiny entered Yang Ye’s forehead!

Merged!

In the end, they had chosen Yang Ye!

However, the five element sword didn’t move.

Yang Ye didn’t force them. He smiled and waved his right hand. Heaven Executor appeared in his grasp, and he passed it to Snowy.

Snowy took it and continued her work on it.

Yang Ye rubbed her head gently and left.

At the rear mountains of the Sword Sect, Yang Ye stood at the peak of a mountain.

He looked into the distant sky in silence, and he fell into deep thought.

Order!

The world should have order. It had order now, the order that Destiny built. However, her order was too overbearing, and it was too cruel!

She didn’t give anyone a chance to survive it!

When the people below had no chance, they would definitely risk their lives!

And he, Yang Ye, planned to risk his life as well!

Because his intuition told him that he would fight Destiny, sooner or later.

Moreover, he would have to face her strongest form!

A short while later, Yang Ye suddenly chuckled. He waved his right hand and a sword shot up into the air.

A blood red sword!

It was the Sword Precursor that had fallen into the Devil Dao!

A sword howl resounded through the sky.

Yang Ye’s smile grew brighter as he watched the blood red ray of sword energy shoot through the sky. At this point, he’d finally realized that the best sword was the most suitable sword.

The strength of a sword changed because of its user!𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly. A few breaths of time later, he raised his right hand, and a ray of sword energy flashed past his wrist.

Hiss!

A strand of blood sprayed out!

The blood surged into the air and entered the Sword Precursor.

Feeding it with blood!

Once Yang Ye’s blood surged into it, the Sword Precursor started trembling violently, and then sword howls resounded incessantly.

As more and more blood surged into it, the sword trembled increasingly violently, and it grew redder and redder!

It wasn’t just blood that was entering it. Countless strands of sword intent and slaughter intent were surging madly out of Yang Ye before flowing into the Sword Precursor.

Of course, he’d stopped feeding it with his blood by now. His blood wasn’t endless, and he would die if he gave away too much!

Just like that, around two hours passed before Yang Ye stopped, and then the Sword Precursor flew over to him and transformed into a blood red woman.

Yang Ye touched her cheek gently and smiled, “After going through so many swords, you are the sword most suited to me.”

She gazed at him in silence.

“Haha!” Yang Ye suddenly shot up into the sky with his sword in hand, and the entire sky turned blood red. It was like a blood red cloth was covering the sky, and it was an extremely shocking sight!

In the sky, Yang Ye crazily released his sword intent and slaughter intent. He’d turned completely blood red now.

Suddenly, a wave of powerful pressure appeared in the sky.

The Sword Dao of Hatred!

Simple speaking, it was the Demonic Sword Dao. At the instant Yang Ye entered this state, his sword intent and slaughter intent instantly rose rapidly!

They rose at a simply unbelievable rate!

Yang Ye released it all to his heart’s content, and his aura gradually grew increasingly stronger.

Just like that, an entire day passed.

Boom!

Suddenly, the world shook, and then the sword intent and slaughter intent started to disperse. A short while later, the sky had returned to calm.

Yang Ye descended to the ground, and he’d returned to normal now.

Something worth mentioning was that he was at the peak of the Destiny Realm now!

The extremes of the Destiny Realm!

He’d used his slaughter intent, sword intent, and Demonic Sword Dao to improve his cultivation earlier. It was quite a risky method, but he didn’t have a better way!

He didn’t have time to cultivate slowly!

He could only take a risk. Fortunately, he’d succeeded!

Now that he was at the peak of the Destiny Realm, his strength had improved tremendously in all aspects. Especially the Sword Precursor, it had been improved too. Now, while it may not be as strong as Destiny’s swords, the strength it could reveal when wielded by Yang Ye was absolutely beyond the swords of Destiny.

The most suitable sword!

Regardless of how many swords he had, the Sword Precursor was the most suitable for him! It knew him the best too!

As for the other swords, there was lots of work to do. So, he wasn’t in a hurry. In any case, they didn’t reject him and had chosen to follow him. Their choice this time held a different meaning.

Previously, it was the woman in white and woman in black who’d asked them to go with Yang Ye, yet now, they could be said to have chosen to willingly follow him. It was a huge difference!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly turned around, and he saw An Nanjing walking over slowly!

Yang Ye was stunned and asked, “You’re advanced?”

She nodded slightly, “Shall we fight?”

Fight!

Yang Ye roared with laughter, “Of course!”

They didn’t do it in the Primordial Pagoda. They went to the outside world, went high above into space, and fortified the area around them.

They stood 300m away from each other.

Yang Ye smiled, “Attack me!”

An Nanjing nodded, and then she appeared in front of him.

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly. At their level of strength, the eyes were actually incapable of keeping up to their speed.

They could only rely on their hearts to see!

This time, Yang Ye had chosen to attack last and wait for an opportunity to strike!

A short moment later, a spear arrived before his forehead.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye swung his sword.

He stabbed it upward, and the tip of his sword struck the tip of the spear, forcing it to a stop. After that, Yang Ye grabbed his sword with both hands and slashed along the spear.

His sword descended at an angle!

Meanwhile, An Nanjing suddenly retreated slightly and created distance between them. Yang Ye’s sword hit nothing but air, and An Nanjing’s spear suddenly slammed down at him.

Yang Ye reacted very quickly. At the instant the spear descended, he flicked his sword upward at an angle.

Bam!

The sword and spear shook violently, and then they were instantly blasted over 300m away.

As soon as she stopped herself, An Nanjing’s spear left her grasp.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye unfurled his palm, and the Sword Precursor transformed into a ray of blood red light that shot forward at her.

An explosion resounded in the air between them, and then they simultaneously vanished on the spot.

Meanwhile, Jian Wudi and Qing Xuan were quietly watching them from afar.

Qing Xuan spoke softly, “That girl has extraordinary talent! She’s amazing!”

Jian Wudi gazed at An Nanjing and nodded slightly, “She isn’t any inferior to this grand disciple of mine!”

Qing Xuan gazed at Jian Wudi, “That grand disciple of yours is too sly and full of tricks. He’s completely different from Xuanan. I wonder why Xuanan got mixed up with him.”

Jian Wudi roared with laughter and replied seriously, “Have you not noticed? He has some things that Xuanan once gave up.”

Qing Xuan gazed at Yang Ye and spoke softly, “Indeed! However, you should know that the situation is growing more and more complicated. Do you really plan to get mixed up in it?”

Jian Wudi replied softly, “He’s my grand disciple at any rate. Am I supposed to just abandon him?”

She nodded and didn’t say anything else.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye and An Nanjing had stopped. They could only stop when appropriate because both of them couldn’t go all out!

If they couldn’t go all out, they naturally couldn’t bring forth their full strength!

They had to stop at the appropriate moment!

Yang Ye brought An Nanjing over to Jian Wudi and Qing Xuan, and he bowed slightly, “Martial Ancestor, Aunt Qing.”

Qing Xuan nodded slightly and grinned. Yang Ye was actually stronger than her, but from the beginning until the end, he’d always been extremely respectful to her. She could sense that it was sincere respect and not something feigned!

Jian Wudi asked, “Can you control that Sword Dao of yours?”

Obviously, he was speaking about Yang Ye’s Demonic Sword Dao.

Yang Ye nodded, “I can.”

Jian Wudi nodded slightly, “That’s good to hear!”

Suddenly, the Yang Clan’s grand elder appeared here. He gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Some people have arrived outside the city. They are being led by that desolate race.”

The desolate race!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. A moment later, he arrived before the city gates with the others. The group in the distance was led by Huang Ying, and there were a few Destiny Realm experts by his side!

Huang Ying gazed at Yang Ye and smiled, “All of us have clans and sects with us. There’s quite a few of us. Will you take us in?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and replied, “Of course.”

Huang Ying walked over to Yang Ye, “The powers from all over the universe are behind me. They can practically represent the entire universe, so just let us know if you need something.”

Yang Ye asked, “Will they obey my command?”

Huang Ying grinned, “That depends on you!”
