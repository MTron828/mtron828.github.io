Chapter 1902 – Killing A Dragon!

Nansi Yin suddenly said, “A Dragon Chariot!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “What the heck?”

She glanced at him and said, “It’s a symbol of status. Amongst the human race, only few powers dare to enslave the dragon clan, but those who dare are definitely not ordinary!”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Does your clan dare to do that?”

Nansi Yin smiled, “My clan doesn’t just have dragons, we have phoenixes too! Moreover, they’re golden dragons and golden phoenixes. Right, they’re two levels higher than this fellow’s dragon!”

“Oh.” Yang Ye withdrew his gaze.

Meanwhile, Nansi Yin asked, “Does your clan dare to do that?”

She was trying to find out about Yang Ye’s identity.

Yang Ye glanced at Nansi Yin and spoke indifferently, “Dragons and demons like it are too low level.”

Nansi Yin was speechless.

Actually, Yang Ye wasn’t bragging. He’d even sat on Qiong Qi’s back. Who was Qiong Qi? An ancient ferocious beast, and a demon king of the demon race. So, could an ordinary dragon even be compared to him?

However, Yang Ye always kept a low profile, and never showed off. So, while he was great, he never told anyone about it!

Suddenly, the dragon stopped when it passed by the two of them. After that, a man in an embroidered robe walked out of the palace. There was a young girl around the age of eight or nine on his right.

The man was around the age of 20. He was handsome, and there was a smile on his face. The first impression he gave anyone was very good. As for the young girl, she wore a blue dress with flower patterns, and she had a small ponytail. She was extremely cute and seemed so pretty like she was carved out of jade.

The man took her hand in one hand while pointing at Yang Ye and Nansi Yin with his other hand. He smiled, “Ling’er, you asked me why we cultivate. Now, I’ll tell you the answer. See them? They’re very weak, extremely weak. So, they don’t have any control over their lives. Because I can kill them with ease! But they can only accept their fate. That’s the fate of those who don’t work hard on their cultivation!”

The young girl blinked and asked naively, “Really?”

The man smiled, “Big Brother will show you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he tapped his foot down, and the dragon beneath him suddenly opened its eyes before biting at Yang Ye and Nansi Yin.

Nansi Yin’s face fell at the sight of this. As for Yang Ye, his face was calm, and it was impossible to see any emotions from it.

It didn’t take long for the dragon to arrive above them, and then it opened its mouth with the intent to devour them.

Suddenly, a sword appeared in Yang Ye’s grasp, and then a ray of light shot up into the air.

The sword energy shot through the dragon’s mouth.

Roar!

In an instant, a dragon roar resounded, and it carried boundless pain.

However, that wasn’t the end of it. Yang Ye, who’d arrived above the dragon’s head, suddenly swung his sword down at the dragon’s neck.

Hiss!

The dragon wasn’t even able to react before it lost its head.

He’d killed the dragon!

The dragon crashed to the ground, and blood sprayed all over.

Yang Ye descended before the man and woman. The young girl was clearly quite afraid, but the man seemed very calm and composed.

Yang Ye glanced at the young girl and said, “Actually, your brother is right. Because both of you are weaklings to me, and so long as I want to, I can make both of you lose your heads right now. Do you want to see that?”

The young girl hurriedly shook her head.

Yang Ye cracked a smile. He didn’t say another word. He lowered his sword and started walking in the city’s direction.

However, he suddenly stopped a little while later and said, “Just killing a dragon doesn’t feel enough to me. Fine, I just got here, so I should keep a low profile. Just apologize and I’ll let it go. Alright?”

He was naturally talking to the man.

The man sized up Yang Ye and said, “It was my mistake. I hope you forgive me.”

He flicked a spatial ring over to Yang Ye while he spoke, “Treat it as your compensation. Please accept it!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright.”

He waved his hand, took the spatial ring, and walked towards the city.

Nansi Yin gazed at Yang Ye’s figure, and a strange glow flickered in her eyes.

She immediately went after him.

On the dead dragon’s back, the young girl suddenly pulled on the man’s sleeve and spoke timidly, “Big Brother…”

The man withdrew his gaze and looked at the young girl. He smiled, “Ling’er don’t be afraid, nothing will happen to us.”

Ling’er spoke softly, “Should we call Grandpa Lin?”

The man said, “You want to take revenge?”

She hesitated for a moment and remained silent.

The man rubbed her head gently, “Ling’er, since you were born in our clan, you’re mature beyond your age. I understand it because I was the same. Even though it allowed you to obtain many things you wanted from the clan, it makes you lose a lot too!”

Ling’er blinked, “Big Brother, it’s too deep for me to understand!”

He smiled and said, “I taught you a principle just now. Now, I’ll teach you another one. Let me ask you something, is there any severe enmity between us?”

She shook her head.

The man smiled, “Then do you know anything about his background?”

She shook her head again.

The man continued, “Then do you know how strong he really is?”

She still shook her head.

The man rubbed her head gently and smiled, “See, there’s no enmity between us, and you don’t know his true strength or identity. So, what if Grandpa Lin can’t defeat him? Or perhaps his identity is one that’s even greater than our clan? At that time, a whim of yours will create a powerful enemy for our clan. Tell me, how will the clan treat us if that happens?”

She fell silent for a short while, and then she replied, “We’ll either be killed or expelled!”

The man nodded and smiled, “Now, do you still want to take revenge?”

She shook her head.

The man smiled, “Have you learned anything from all of this?”

She thought for a moment and replied, “We should keep a low profile.”

The man nodded, “Indeed. Right, don’t play any tricks if you meet your Big Sister Cangyue. Otherwise, she’ll kick you out of the city!”

Ling’er nodded, “I understand!”

It didn’t take long for them to enter the city.

…

Once they entered the city, Nansi Yin walked over to Yang Ye’s side and asked, “Why didn’t you kill that man?”

Yang Ye shook his head and remained silent. There were two reasons why he hadn’t killed the man. The first was because he didn’t want to get himself in too much trouble. That person’s background wasn’t ordinary, so while he didn’t fear it, it would definitely cause him a lot of trouble.

The second reason was still trouble. He’d sensed an obscure aura earlier, and it had locked onto him. If he attacked, the owner of the aura would attack as well.

So, he hadn’t attacked so that he could avoid trouble.

Meanwhile, Nansi Yin asked, “Why aren’t you saying anything?”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “I want to go to the Shaman Dimension!”

She hesitated for a moment and asked, “Can you tell me why?”

Yang Ye replied, “I can’t!”

She puckered her lips and said, “Fine! I don’t even want to know! So, if you want to go to the Shaman Dimension, you need a command token from the Northern Sky King’s estate. Only then will you be able to leave through the Northern Sky Gate.”

She seemed to know what Yang Ye was thinking and immediately continued, “Don’t even think about doing it by force. Even the Shaman Hunter Clan has to get a command token from the Northern Sky King’s estate to get through. Because there isn’t just an extremely powerful formation there, there are at least two extraordinary experts guarding it.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “You have a way through, right?”

She smiled, “I just happen to have one!”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “What are your conditions?”

She replied, “I want to go with you!”

Yang Ye frowned, “What are you going there for?”

She replied with a question, “Then what are you going there for?”

Yang Ye walked over to her, looked her in the eyes, and said, “Miss Nan, I know your identity is extraordinary, and your strength isn’t bad as well. However, I’m going to the Shaman Dimension, so your identity is useless there. As for your strength, if I’m to be honest, I can fight ten people like you!”

The corners of her mouth twitched slightly, “What are you trying to say?”

Yang Ye said, “I can’t refuse you if your condition is to go with me, but if you go there with me, I won’t protect you, nor do I have the strength to protect you.”

She said, “I don’t need you to protect me!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Then do as you wish!”

Nansi Yin said, “Come with me to the Northern Sky King’s estate!”

She started walking off into the distance, and Yang Ye just followed her without saying anything.

It didn’t take long for them to arrive before the Northern Sky King’s estate. The estate was huge, and it covered an enormous area. There were two bronze beast statues at the entrance of the estate.

“Wait here for me!” Once she finished speaking, she swaggered off towards the entrance.

She suddenly stopped when she arrived at the entrance, and then she withdrew a jade slip and waved it. Just a moment later, the door opened, and she walked in.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Not long after she went in, three old men in golden robes suddenly appeared around Yang Ye.

Their auras locked onto Yang Ye, and they even released their auras and pressed it down upon Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly and said, “Let me give you a friendly warning! I’m in a very bad mood!”
