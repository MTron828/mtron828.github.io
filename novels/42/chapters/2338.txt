Yang Ye?

The old man was stunned and hurriedly said, “He’s alive, he’s alive!”

The young girl asked, “Where is he?”

The old man replied, “He should be at the Immortal Source Abode, the base of the Immortal Estate.”

At this point, the old man hesitated for a moment and added, “It’s best if you go soon. Because his life is probably in danger.”

The young girl opened her eyes.

The old man lowered his head slightly and didn’t dare to meet her gaze.

She glanced at the surroundings and said, “Which way?”

The old man quickly pointed to the right.

A moment later, she vanished on the spot, and the powerful aura that enveloped the Shiyuan Clan vanished without a trace.

The entire Shiyuan Clan heaved a sigh of relief!

That pressure had been too terrifying! It wasn’t something the Shiyuan Clan could resist at all!

…

The Immortal Estate.

At this moment, Yang Ye was at the foot of the mountain, and he still encountered no obstruction.

Suddenly, Yang Ye kicked with his right foot.

Hiss!

He shot up into the air like a shadow, and it only took him an instant to reach the peak of the mountain.

As soon as he descended there, Yang Ye drew the saber on his back, and the mountain shook violently. He looked up at the Immortal Estate and laughed ferociously, “Didn’t you want to kill me? I’ve come to you, so where are all of you? Come kill me!”

His voice was like a thunderclap that surged through the area!

It didn’t take long for a middle aged man to appear before Yang Ye. He sized up Yang Ye and said, “Yang Ye, you should be aware of the current situation. Why benefit others just for a moment of satisfaction?”

Obviously, the Immortal Estate was aware that the others were waiting for Yang Ye to drag the Immortal Estate down with him.

“Benefit others?” Yang Ye laughed coldly, “In any case, I’m dead. So, I naturally plan to kill everyone who once harmed me before I die!”

“Yang Ye!” The middle aged man’s face turned cold, “Are you…”

“Cut the crap! I’m here to kill, not to talk!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye appeared before the middle aged man, and then a blood red saber slammed down at the man’s head. A ray of blood red light rippled through the surroundings!

The middle aged man’s face turned gloomy when he saw Yang Ye attack, and he stomped his foot down and moved 300m back.

The saber struck the ground!

Bang!

The entire mountain shook violently, and a very long rift appeared before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye didn’t stop after missing, he transformed into a ray of blood red light that charged at the middle aged man.

The middle aged man’s expression changed drastically. He didn’t dare to fight Yang Ye at all, and he immediately tapped his right foot down and moved around 300m back again. But as soon as he stopped, a golden flying blade appeared in front of him.

His eyes opened wide when he saw the flying blade.

Hiss!

A ray of golden light flashed through his forehead.

Blood sprayed!

The middle aged man’s figure stiffened on the spot.

A golden flying blade floated quietly behind him.

Yang Ye walked over to the middle aged man and put the flying blade away, and then he walked off into the distance. Suddenly, the entire mountain shook violently, and then the flying swords that circled it shot up into the air before descending upon Yang Ye in succession.

Yang Ye stopped. Meanwhile, a flying sword had arrived above him.

Yang Ye raised the saber with both hands and swung it upward.

Violent and simple!

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and Yang Ye was pushed backward repeatedly while Invincible trembled in his grasp. It wasn’t just Invincible that was trembling, his arm was shaking too.

However, that wasn’t the end of it. Another flying sword had arrived before him.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he hurled Invincible with both hands.

Hiss!

The saber shot forward.

As soon as the sword and saber collided, a wave of powerful energy rippled out, and then Invincible was blasted backward. Meanwhile, Yang Ye soared up into the air and kicked Invincible.

Bang!

It stopped on the spot while the sword arrived before it!

Meanwhile, an expanse of saber energy surged forward!

Madness Saber Technique!

Almost 100 rays of saber energy descended upon the tip of the sword, and it was forced to a stop. However, it didn’t move an inch back! Meanwhile, two more rays of sword energy flashed, and they shot toward Yang Ye’s left and right while obliterating everything in their paths!

Yang Ye frowned when he sensed this. These three swords weren’t being controlled by a person, they were being controlled by a formation, and the strength of this formation far surpassed his expectations!

Yang Ye didn’t have the time to think because the swords had arrived!

A sword howl suddenly resounded!

Yang Ye swiftly stabbed his sword both left and right, and they forced those flying swords to a stop. However, all three flying swords suddenly shook violently, and then they overlapped together. A short moment later, a ray of sword energy appeared before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye frowned and stabbed his sword forward.

The Sword Domain!

But it was just one swing!

The swords stabbed against each other’s tips.

Bang!

Countless rays of sword energy sprayed, and the space around Yang Ye instantly cracked open, causing sword energy to ripple toward the surroundings and tear open everything in their paths!

Yang Ye held his sword against the three swords that were now one huge sword, and the four swords gradually started to tremble. It didn’t take long for the three swords to start spinning abruptly.

Yang Ye’s expression instantly changed.

Sword intent!

True Dao Realm sword intent had suddenly appeared within them!

Bang!

An explosion resounded and Yang Ye was blasted off the mountain, but this wasn’t the end of it. Three rays of sword energy flashed out and stabbed at him!

At the same time, sword intent converged incessantly to them from all around the mountain!

It was endless!

However, the sword didn’t move to strike him.

“Yang Ye!” Suddenly, a voice resounded from deep within the mountain.

Yang Ye looked up, and the voice resounded once more, “This formation was created by the number one sword sect of the Primal Era, and these three swords are Pseudo Divine Treasures. You can’t overcome them alone!”

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, “And?”

“Leave immediately!” The voice spoke solemnly, “Yang Ye, my Immortal Estate can stop looking for trouble with you if you leave!”

Yang Ye frowned. Something felt off to him because they were actually making a compromise!

Suddenly, soft laughter resounded from the sky, “Don’t believe him!”

Yang Ye looked up at the sky, and he could faintly see a woman far above in the clouds. Meanwhile, she said, “Young Brother Yang, the Immortal Estate is buying time because their master is rushing back here. If he gets here, you’ll probably have no chance to survive!”

Yang Ye glanced at the woman, and then he looked toward the depths of the mountain, “I can leave if you want. Give me the heads of all your experts at the True Dao Realm and that old man in the Half-Step World Lord Realm who tried to kill me, then I’ll leave!”

He still remembered the old man who’d fought him in the Sword Ruins.

“Yang Ye, don’t go too far!” The voice resounded abruptly, “My Immortal Estate isn’t letting you leave because we fear you, we just don’t want to be used by others. If you refuse to come to your senses, then my Immortal Estate…”

“That’s exactly what I’m doing!” Suddenly, Yang Ye spoke ferociously, “Let me tell you. Everyone who hunted me down or took advantage of the situation I was in must die! If worse comes to worse, let’s just die together!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a strand of powerful sword intent swept out from him.

The voice ridiculed, “Die together? You? Die!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the three swords shook before Yang Ye.

A sword howl resounded through the sky, and then they shot at Yang Ye!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly and patted his chest. A moment later, a fluffy little head emerged from there.

Snowy!

Yang Ye pointed at the three swords, “I want them. Snowy, get them!”

Snowy blinked, and then she gazed at the swords that were shooting at them. A moment later, she leaped out and stretched out her paws…

Countless watched with astonishment as the swords stopped just a few inches away from Yang Ye’s forehead, and then the sword intent and sword energy on them dispersed before they laid firmly on Snowy’s paws.

All three of them were trembling and seemed to be excited.

Snowy looked down at them and was slightly curious. She knocked them lightly with her paws, and clear and melodious sword howls resounded from them.

After playing with them for a while, Snowy seemed to have thought of something, and she summoned the Sword Gourd on Yang Ye’s waist. After that, she pushed the three swords into it.

In the beginning, the Sword Gourd was slightly against that, and the swords seemed to fear it. However, it was no problem. Once Snowy glared at them, the Sword Gourd was obedient.

Snowy placed the three swords into the Sword Gourd, and then she flew over to Yang Ye and cracked a smile before hanging it on his waist.

When it came to treasures, hers was Yang Ye’s, and Yang Ye’s was Yang Ye’s.

That was what Yang Ye had taught her, and that was what she thought was right!

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head, and then he smiled, “Go back inside.”

But Snowy shook her head. She glanced at the surroundings, and then her eyes lit up. She was about to fly into the depths of the mountain when Yang Ye swiftly grabbed her in his arms. However, she seemed to be very excited, and she kept pointing into the distance with her eyes wide open. Moreover, she kept kicking with her tiny legs and seemed like she insisted on going…
