Chapter 1765 – I’ll Slaughter Your Entire Family!

A mouthful of blood sprayed from the old man when he heard Yang Ye, and then he took his last breath.

Everyone here was speechless.

Yang Ye turned around to look at Yang Lianshuang, and he said, “Let’s begin!”

She gazed at him for a long time before she nodded, “Alright!”

…

A day later, the Ying Clan and the other four clans suddenly declared war against the Yang Clan. At the same time, they formed a huge army. This army was formed completely out of True Realm experts, and there were 75 of them!

Every single clan had contributed 15 True Realm experts, and the weakest amongst them was at the 3rd stage of the True Realm!

Besides that, there were five 5th stage True Realm experts amongst them!

The entire medium universe was shocked by such a force!

Needless to say, it was extremely terrifying. 75 True Realm experts and even five at the 5th stage of the True Realm!

That was simply sufficient to crush the Yang Clan!

So, would the Yang Clan vanish from the medium universe?

As far as many were concerned, it was certain. Because no matter how monstrous Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang were, it was impossible for them to fight the joint forces of the five clans. Especially when the Ying Clan was amongst them!

When the Yang Clan heard about the army, it seemed exceptionally calm. At the very least, Heaven Void Continent was exceptionally calm on the surface.

No matter what, the eyes of the entire medium universe was converged on the Yang Clan.

A day later, 75 experts appeared in the sky above Heaven Void Continent!

Once they appeared there, everyone on the continent felt a wave of unprecedented pressure slam down upon them.

Their auras!

Just the aura of those 75 experts was difficult to endure for many on Heaven Void Continent.

High above in the sky.

The Ying Clan’s patriarch, Ying Qing, led the group. He glanced at the continent below and said, “Have the Wu Clan and Ku Clan made any movements?”

An old man behind him stepped forward, “There has been no movement from them until now.”

Ying Qing asked, “What about Moment Mountain?”

The old man shook his head, “No movement as well!”

Ying Qing fell silent for a long time, and then he turned around and gazed at four middle aged men behind him. They were the Wang Clan’s Patriarch Wang Gu, the Li Clan’s Patriarch Li Nianxian, the Qin Clan’s Patriarch Qin Shen, and the Lu Clan’s Patriarch Lu Yuntian!

Ying Qing said, “Since all of you are here, it represents that you don’t wish to give the Yang Clan any chances, and they won’t have a chance with our current forces. But you absolutely must not be careless!”

“Can the Yang Clan turn the situation around?” The Li Clan’s patriarch, Li Nianxian, spoke in a low voice. He hated the Yang Clan the most. Because Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang had killed around 20 True Realm experts from the Li Clan, and they’d even sent those heads back to the Li Clan.

The Li Clan had been absolutely humiliated that day!Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Ying Qing shook his head, “The Yang Clan is nothing to fear, it’s Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang who’re terrifying. Our main mission isn’t to destroy the Yang Clan, it’s to kill them. Once they die, the Yang Clan is doomed. But if they are alive, then we’ll never be able to sleep in peace!”

The Qin Clan’s patriarch, Qin Shen, frowned and asked, “Are they that terrifying?”

Lu Yuntian suddenly said, “They aren’t just terrifying, they’re absolutely terrifying. Brother Qin, you haven’t come into contact with them, so you don’t know. I don’t know much about Yang Lianshuang, but Yang Ye is a truly extraordinary genius.”

Yang Qing nodded, “He was able to injure my clan’s ancestor with a single strike, and he’s only at the Zenith Realm right now. So, tell me, is he terrifying or not?!”

The expressions of everyone here became solemn.

The Ying Clan’s ancestor was a 6th stage True Realm expert!

Ying Qing added, “They are the true danger for us. They can’t be allowed to continue growing. Once they grow further, none of us may be able to stop them! Just like Yang Wudi. If something hadn’t happened to him, would any one of your clans have been able to stop him?”

Yang Wudi!

That name wasn’t new to all of them because they were from the same generation.

At that time, the Yang Clan was the weakest amongst the clans, but it was Yang Wudi who almost led the Yang Clan to become the overlord amongst the clans in the medium universe. At that time, even the Ying Clan and Ku Clan didn’t dare to go head-on against the Yang Clan!

The main reason was Yang Wudi!

Meanwhile, Ying Qing said, “Now, Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang’s natural talent and strength aren’t inferior to Yang Wudi at all. So, just think about it. If they don’t die and are allowed to grow, then will any of our clans be able to sleep in peace?”

All of them fell silent.

No one could endure Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang’s revenge. Not to mention in the future, they weren’t really able to endure it right now!

Ying Qing suddenly said, “Actually, Yang Xiao and those other fellows from the Yang Clan were absolute idiots. If my Ying Clan had such a genius, then not to mention the rules of the clan, we would even be willing to change our clan’s rules for such a genius.”

“He couldn’t let go!” Lu Yuntian said, “He couldn’t let go of the authority he possessed. Actually, it’s not just him, how many of you can truly let go of your authority? Perhaps we will once we’ve arrived at a certain level, but we’re all still living in the world of mortals right now, right?”

The others nodded. There were some things that couldn’t be given up just because it had to be given up, and it was especially so for authority!

The feeling of holding authority was something that many couldn’t understand.

Meanwhile, Lu Yuntian suddenly said, “Right, the Yang Clan has another 6th stage True Realm expert!”

Ying Qing nodded slightly, “Don’t worry. There’ll be someone to deal with him if he lends them a hand!”

Lu Yuntian asked, “Your Ying Clan’s ancestor?”

Ying Qing nodded, “However, only one of them will be coming. As for the other two….” He shook his head when he spoke up to this point.

Lu Yuntian and the others shook their heads as well.

Every single clan had their ancestors at the 6th stage of the True Realm. But those experts only cared about their own life and death. They really didn’t carry much emotion towards their clans anymore. So, not to mention making them help in battle, they couldn’t even be certain if those 6th stage True Realm experts would help when their clans were in danger of being destroyed!

It wasn’t just a problem in the Yang Clan, all the other clans faced similar problems!

The exception to this was an ancestor who had descendants, like the Ying Clan’s ancestor. The reason Ying Qing was able to make that ancestor of the Ying Clan help was because Ying Qing was the old man’s grandson! That was why he’d been able to gain help from the old man!

But the other clans…. For example, the Yang Clan’s ancestor’s descendants were gone. So, while he was still related by blood to both Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang, the link between them was very weak when there were numerous generations between them!

Thus, it wasn’t that they didn’t want to get help from the ancestors of their clans to crush Yang Ye, the problem was that they couldn’t make those ancestors!

Just like the Yang Clan. Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang weren’t able to seek help from that old man at the 6th stage of the True Realm!

Meanwhile, Ying Qing suddenly looked down at Heaven Void Continent, “Everyone, ignore the True Realm experts of the Yang Clan. We’ll attack together if Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang show themselves, and we’ll strive to put an end to them! The Yang Clan is finished once they’re dead!”

The other behind him nodded to display their agreement!

Meanwhile, Lu Yuntian asked, “Shall we attack now?”

Ying Qing shook his head, and then he looked towards a nearby point in space, “Brother Ku, Brother Wu, are you really not joining us?”

The space there trembled slightly, and then two middle aged men appeared there.

It was the Ku Clan’s Patriarch Ku Jing and the Wu Clan’s Patriarch Wu Wen!

Ku Jing gazed at the Wu Clan’s patriarch and smiled, “Brother Wu, what’s your decision?”

Wu Wen shook his head slightly, “My Wu Clan won’t be participating.”

Ku Jing chuckled and said, “My Ku Clan won’t be participating too!”

Ying Qing spoke indifferently, “Are you telling me that you think the Yang Clan still has a chance?”

Wu Wen replied, “Actually, I’d like to take a share of this. But I’m sure all of you are aware that the little girl in my Wu Clan is close to Yang Ye, and the founding ancestor of my Wu Clan has taken a liking to her. If my Wu Clan acts against Yang Ye, then while we will gain something, we’ll lose a genius. So, I have no choice but to give up this opportunity.”

He gazed at the Ku Clan’s patriarch, Ku Jing, and asked, “What about you, Brother Ku? Why isn’t your Ku Clan joining them? According to my knowledge, there seems to be enmity between your clan and Yang Ye.”

Ku Jing chuckled, “I’m sure you’re aware that my Ku Clan doesn’t have much ambition, and we don’t have many members. Losing just one is a huge loss to my clan. So, my clan isn’t participating!”

The other patriarchs glanced at Ku Jing. Even though they didn’t say anything, they clearly didn’t believe him.

Actually, the clan they feared the most wasn’t the Ying Clan, it was the Ku Clan.

The most dangerous existence in the forest wasn’t the fierce tiger, it was the venomous snake that hid in the shadows! Because the snake was impossible to detect, and its target would probably be dead once it struck.

If the Ying Clan was the fierce tiger, the Ku Clan was the venomous snake.

As for the Yang Clan… The Yang Clan was the mad wolf right now!

Especially the Yang Clan which was led by Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang. Or it should be said the Yang Clan led by Yang Ye. That fellow was even more terrifying than the venomous snake or fierce tiger!

Because if anyone offended him, he dared to attack both the tiger and the snake! Moreover, he would fight them to the death!

There always was some conflict between all the clans, but they would hold back. But Yang Ye would never hold back. If you offended him, he would dare to kill you!

Ying Qing glanced at Ku Jing and Wu Wen, and he said, “Since you’ve made your decisions, I won’t say anything.”

He gazed at Heaven Void Continent and waved his right hand, “Attack!”

The experts behind Ying Qing were about to attack. However, the space before Ying Qing suddenly trembled, and then Ying Qing’s expression changed drastically. He howled with fury, “Yang Ye! I’ll slaughter your entire family!”

Everyone here was stunned. What happened?
