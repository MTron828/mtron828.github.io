Chapter 2775 – Conquer Her!

Yang Busi and Tu were still fighting!

Both of them were actually equally matched, so it was impossible to decide on a victor in a short amount of time.

However, they showed no signs of stopping!

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye’s injuries had practically healed. Moreover, he felt that his strength had improved slightly.

Every life and death battle allowed him to improve tremendously.

It was an improvement in all aspects.

Now, he needed battles the most. The more intense they were, the stronger he would become! Of course, they may kill him too.

Yang Ye left the cultivation room and arrived at the Ascension Platform.

Snowy wasn’t there!

Yang Ye’s divine sense swept the surroundings, and then he sensed Snowy. Snowy was in the Primal True Dragon’s territory, and she seemed to be helping it grow stronger!

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, and then he placed Heavenshield and the fragments of armor on the Ascension Platform before leaving the Primordial Pagoda.

…

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye appeared beside An Nanjing. He looked into the distance. It was extremely calm and still.

An Nanjing spoke softly, “They won’t stop!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Then let them come!”

An Nanjing gazed at Yang Ye, “Shall we kill our way there?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “We have to take precautions against those fellows from the End World too!”

If An Nanjing and him killed their way there, and the group from the End World went to Universe City during their absence, then Universe City would have no way to defend itself against the mysterious expert’s group.

Universe City only had a chance of fighting them when they had someone to keep the mysterious expert busy.

Otherwise, just the mysterious expert alone was enough to crush Universe City.

An Nanjing asked, “What about Erya?”

Erya!

Yang Ye slowly tightened his grip on his sword sheath, and a wisp of worry flashed through his eyes.

Now, Erya could be considered as the Evil Beast of the past. Her strength was naturally beyond doubt. Even then, he was still very worried. However, he couldn’t go looking for her right now!

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while, and then he withdrew a transmission stone. A moment later, Ding Shaoyao’s voice came from the other side, “What is it?”

Yang Ye replied softly, “Send people to search for Erya. If they find her, don’t get close to her or offend her. Just notify me!”

Ding Shaoyao fell silent for a short while and said, “Alright!”

Yang Ye put the transmission stone away and gazed at An Nanjing, “Stay here. I’m going to look for someone!”

An Nanjing asked, “Who?”

Yang Ye replied, “The woman in black.”

An Nanjing nodded and didn’t say anything else.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “If the forces of the Four Dimensional Universe arrive, contact me immediately. Besides that, if anything unexpected happens, don’t try to deal with it on your own. Retreat to Universe City!”

She nodded.

Yang Ye didn’t say anything else and just vanished on the spot with the help of Great Unknown.

An Nanjing looked ahead and sat on Yang Ye’s chair. She just sat there with her eyes closed.

Yang Ye was gone, so she was the first line of defense for the Three Dimensional Universe now.

Not long after Yang Ye left, a figure appeared nearby. An Nanjing gazed at the figure, and the figure said, “Are you willing to leave with me?”

It was the Mortal Emperor who’d taken Sky Maiden.

Of course, he wasn’t the first Mortal Emperor.

An Nanjing noticed that he didn’t carry any hostility toward her, so Dagger-Axe stopped trembling and calmed down.

She shook her head.

The Mortal Emperor said, “The Three Dimensional Universe is bound to fall.”

An Nanjing glanced at the Mortal Emperor, “The Three Dimensional Universe has nothing to do with me!”

The Mortal Emperor was quite puzzled, “Since it has nothing to do with you, then why stand on guard here and fight the Four Dimensional Universe, that mysterious expert, and Destiny?”

An Nanjing replied indifferently, “I go where he goes.”

She closed her eyes as she spoke.

The Mortal Emperor fell silent for a long time, and then he said, “I see. His Sword Dao is the Sword Dao of Emotion, and you possess the Martial Dao of Emotion. However, your emotions are only limited to him. Did the emotions come first, or did the emotions come for the Martial Dao?”

An Nanjing glanced at him, “I’m not interested in chatting with you. You can leave now.”

She closed her eyes and seemed to enter a state of meditation.

The Mortal Emperor fell silent for a short while, and then his figure gradually turned ethereal.

A moment later, he’d vanished completely.

An Nanjing remained still like a mountain.

After the Mortal Emperor left, he shot toward a point in space, but it didn’t take long for him to stop. A man had appeared before him.

It was Yang Ye!

Yang Ye gazed at the Mortal Emperor in silence.

The Mortal Emperor said, “Long time no see. You’ve grown stronger again.”

Yang Ye asked, “What do you seek?”

The Mortal Emperor shook his head, “Don’t worry, I don’t seek your Sprite Progenitor, nor do I want the Three Dimensional Universe.”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment and said, “You’re part of the Three Dimensional Universe too.”

The Mortal Emperor smiled, “You want me to protect this universe with you?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I do. But it looks like that won’t happen.”

The Mortal Emperor said, “Yang Ye, have you ever considered that protecting the Three Dimensional Universe is beyond you?”

Yang Ye asked, “Why do you say that?”

The Mortal Emperor chuckled, “It isn’t the End World’s mysterious expert or the Four Dimensional Universe that want the Three Dimensional Universe, it’s Destiny. The strongest form of Destiny. Protecting the Three Dimensional Universe is no different than going against her. Allow me to be honest, you don’t have the strength to resist her.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Her objective is Snowy and Erya!”

The Mortal Emperor smiled, “Abandon them, get far away from this place, and the world will be yours in the future.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Once I lose them, even the best future would be meaningless to me.”

The Mortal Emperor nodded slightly, “It’s your choice.”

He turned around and was about to leave.

Yang Ye asked, “Is my Eldest Sister well?”

The Mortal Emperor stopped, “She is. However, if you seek her help, her future may not be that good. I’m just being frank. You’re in a worse situation than you were in a while ago, and I don’t want her to get mixed up in it. I can be considered to be an ancestor of hers, and she’s the only outstanding one among my descendants.”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “All that matters is that she’s doing well. As for the Three Dimensional Universe, I’ll deal with it myself.”

The Mortal Emperor said, “Take care.”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye left as well.

Meanwhile, the Mortal Emperor was traveling through space when a mysterious figure suddenly appeared before him.

It was the mysterious expert of the End World!

The Mortal Emperor chuckled, “What? When did I become a target of yours?”

The mysterious expert said, “You’re the second Mortal Emperor!”

The Mortal Emperor nodded.

The mysterious expert said, “Are you willing to follow me?”

The Mortal Emperor shook his head, “While I’m inferior to my father, I can’t bring shame to him. Don’t you think so too?”

The mysterious expert replied, “You know who I am!”

The Mortal Emperor smiled, “My father fought you so many times, so how could I not know about you?”

The mysterious expert crossed his arms before himself.

The Mortal Emperor said, “Allow me to be honest, that woman is a god, and no one can fight her. Even if all the geniuses of my father’s era were to come back from the dead and join forces, they still wouldn’t be a match for her!”

The mysterious expert shook his head, “You don’t understand!”

The Mortal Emperor smiled, “Please do tell!”

The mysterious expert replied, “You’re inferior to your father.”

He turned around and left.

The Mortal Emperor suddenly vanished on the spot, and a wave of golden light appeared behind the mysterious expert. The latter stopped and lightly clenched his crossed fists.

Boom!

A wave of powerful energy rippled out of him, and it instantly obliterated the golden energy while the Mortal Emperor returned to where he’d been a moment ago.

The mysterious expert shook his head, “Mortal Emperor, your father led the human race to fight against this world and all the races in it, and he even dared to… refuse the Destiny of that time. Even if he died, he was respected by all.”

He vanished into the distance once he finished speaking.

Mortal Emperor remained silent on the spot.

Many, many years ago. The human race had a Mortal Emperor, his father. That time could be said to be the greatest days of glory for the human race, and all the other races feared the human race of that time!

Of course, just like the other geniuses, even someone who was strong like a god, the Mortal Emperor was still suppressed by that woman.

At that time, there were countless monstrous experts, but no matter how monstrous they were, meeting that woman would be the last thing they did in life!

Destiny annihilated the Heaven Dao of the Three Dimensional Universe and suppressed all the experts that came after.

She was the one who stood above the clouds!

The Mortal Emperor closed his eyes slowly. A long time later, he shook his head, “My father was too foolish. He died for the human race, but does anyone in the human race even remember him now?”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was traveling through space with Great Unknown. His objective was to locate the woman in black!

That irritable woman in black!

There were things he wanted to figure out!

A long time later, Yang Ye suddenly stopped because Great Unknown had started to tremble. A moment later, the space before him cracked open, and then a woman in a pitch black dress walked out from there.

She was covered in injuries. Obviously, she’d just experienced a fierce battle!Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

It was the woman in black!

Yang Ye frowned upon catching sight of her, “What happened to you?”

“Huh?” Her eyes narrowed slightly, “Are you talking to me?”

Yang Ye knew she was furious. Sure enough, she charged at him.

Yang Ye laughed bitterly and took a punch of hers.

Bam!

Yang Ye was pushed over 1km away. However, he was quite happy because she hadn’t been too hard on him.

She spoke coldly, “Let’s get to the point! What are you doing here?”

Yang Ye walked over to her and said, “Your strongest form isn’t very friendly.”

She fell silent.

Yang Ye cracked a smile, “Give me some guidance!”

She glanced at him, “Do you think you’re handsome?”

Yang Ye was stunned for a moment, and then he spoke slightly “shyly”, “U-Uh… Haha, it’s obvious to everyone…”

She spoke indifferently, “Since you think you’re really handsome, then go conquer her. Once you get her, all your problems will be resolved!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
