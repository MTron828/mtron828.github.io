Chapter 1333 – I’ll Annihilate Your Entire Family!

Xu Yuntian? Yang Ye frowned and was about to attack. But he suddenly thought of something and said, “You spoke about Gu Lan just now. Do you know her?” Yang Ye naturally knew Gu Lan. That young woman had said all sorts of bad things about him to Nan Shuang. Thinking about Nan Shuang caused Yang Ye’s expression to become much gentler. After all, he’d really treated Nan Shuang as his younger sister.

Xu Yuntian didn’t answer Yang Ye. He just walked closer to Yang Ye and said, “Let me repeat myself. This little fellow and this woman by your side....”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Slap!

A clear and resounding slap arose, and then Xu Yuntian was blasted out of the store.

Xiao Lan and the old men were stunned. The old men were the first to recover from their senses, and they immediately charged at Yang Ye!

Slap! Slap! Slap!

Slaps resounded, and the old men were blasted away.

Xiao Lan’s eyes opened wide, and her mouth could fit an egg. Xu Yuntian was a Quasi Emperor, and those old men were Emperors!

3 Emperors had been blasted away, just like that!

Snowy blinked, and then she kissed Yang Ye’s cheek and went on eating her fruit.

Yang Ye paid no attention to Xu Yuntian and those old men, and he just gazed at Xiao Lan who was still shocked, “The security fees which he spoke of just now. Are they collected by the Sword Alliance?”

Xiao Lan immediately recovered from her shock upon hearing Yang Ye, and then she hesitated for a moment before she shook her head, “No.”

Yang Ye frowned, “If it isn’t collected by the Sword Alliance, then why do you give it to him?”

Xiao Lan glanced at Yang Ye and spoke softly, “It’s a security fee. If I don’t pay it, then I wouldn’t be able to keep my store open. I’m not the only one, all the stores on my street pay it.”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment and said, “Why haven’t you reported it to the Sword Alliance?”

Xiao Lan spoke softly, “We’ll die!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. Meanwhile, Xiao Lan continued, “Quickly... Quickly leave. Even though you’re very strong, you won’t be a match for him here.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Zi’er suddenly asked, “Is he very powerful here?”

Xiao Lan nodded, “There was once a store that refused to pay, and then the store owner’s entire family vanished overnight.”

Yang Ye asked, “Does the enforcement team not do anything?”

Xiao Lan hesitated for a moment and said, “The enforcement team of this street seems... seems to be on his side.”

Zi’er asked, “Then what about the enforcement teams at other areas of the city?”

Xiao Lan replied, “The other enforcement teams dare not interfere in his business. I’ve seen some of the leaders of the enforcement teams act very respectfully towards him. I heard he has connections with the higher-ups of the Sword Alliance.”

Yang Ye’s face instantly fell.

Zi’er glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent.

Suddenly, Xu Yuntian’s voice resounded from outside, “Get the fuck out here!”

Xiao Lan hesitated for a moment and said, “Both of you should... should just flee out the back door.”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “I really want to see how great his background is to actually make the enforcement teams dare not do anything to him.” As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, he took Zi’er’s hand and walked out of the store.

Presently, many people had gathered outside the store. When Yang Ye, Zi’er, and Snowy left the store, the gazes of all the spectators shot onto them. Their eyes were filled with curiosity and a trace of pity.

“They probably came from the outside. Tsk tsk, the ignorant really are fearless. They even dared to offend Xu the Plunderer. They’re really tired of living.”

“I don’t think so. They seem so calm and composed. They should possess sufficient backing and aren’t afraid.”

“What nonsense! They seem fearless because they are ignorant. Does anyone on our continent dare to offend the Sword Alliance? Offending that fellow in the city is equivalent to offending the Sword Alliance. No matter how strong they are, can they compare to the Sword Alliance? Just watch and see how horrifying the consequences are.”

“Right, I heard that fellow’s uncle and grandfather are higher-ups of the Sword Alliance. They are the type that possess a huge amount of support. So now that he has struck Xu the Plunderer, Xu the Plunderer’s uncle and grandfather will definitely not let the matter rest. Hehe. Actually, I think that he did well. I’ve wanted to hit that fellow for a long time. Unfortunately, I don’t have the courage to do so.”

“Fool! Your words may be your ruin. If that fellow heard you, your entire family would vanish from the city!”

Countless people were in animated discussion throughout the surroundings.

Yang Ye paid no attention to the people in the surroundings, and his gaze descended onto Xu Yuntian. At this moment, Xu Yuntian had a ferocious expression on his face, and his eyes were filled with madness. His right cheek had swelled up to a huge size, and there was an extremely clear palm print there.

Xu Yuntian glared angrily at Yang Ye with his fists clenched, and his eyes were filled with madness and ferocity, “No matter who you are, I’ll annihilate your entire family. I....”

Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot.

Slap!

A clear and resounding slap swept through the surroundings, and the spectators watched as Xu Yuntian’s figure was blasted around 1km away before crashing to the ground.

Clamorous noise resounded in the surroundings. Besides being shocked by Yang Ye’s strength, they were shocked by Yang Ye’s courage.

After all, it was common knowledge that Xu Yuntian had connections with the higher-ups of the Sword Alliance, but the man before them had actually dared to hit Xu Yuntian in public!

Who is he?

All of them gazed at Yang Ye while questions filled their mind, and they were curious about Yang Ye’s identity.

The old men who were with Xu Yuntian and had been blasted away by Yang Ye just now, were furious, and they were about to attack. However, their expressions instantly changed when Yang Ye gazed at them, and then they retreated repeatedly. Besides fear, there was a trace of terror in their eyes. Only now did they recall that they hadn’t even been able to resist a single attack from the man who stood before them!

Xu Yuntian crawled up from the ground, and Zi’er was immediately unable to contain her laughter when she saw him. Because Xu Yuntian’s left check was swollen as well. At this moment, Xu Yuntian’s head was completely round and puffy like the head of a pig.

Zi’er wasn’t the only one, many others in the surroundings were on the verge of laughter, but none dared to actually laugh.

Xu Yuntian touched his cheeks and was stunned. A moment later, he howled with fury, and he howled with all his might. It sounded like a pig being slaughtered.

It was a humiliation!

An extraordinary humiliation!

Being hit in public was an extraordinary humiliation for Xu Yuntian. When had he, Xu Yuntian, ever suffered such humiliation? Xu Yuntian was overwhelmed by rage and forgot the gap in strength between him and Yang Ye. He immediately charged at Yang Ye, but he’d only just arrived before Yang Ye when his figure was blasted away again.

Pu!

A few mouthfuls of blood sprayed as his figure flew through the air, and he flew around 1km back before finally slamming heavily against the ground.

How strong! The spectators gazed at Yang Ye with solemn expressions on their faces. They were just curious about Yang Ye’s background just now, and they’d overlooked his strength. Now, when they saw Yang Ye attack, they realized that Yang Ye wasn’t just very bold, he possessed extraordinarily formidable strength as well.

Zi’er asked, “Why aren’t you killing him?”

“Let’s wait. I want to see who’s backing him and allowing him to act so arrogantly,” replied Yang Ye.

There would be many parasites as a power grew, and it was something unavoidable. Since it had happened before his eyes, then he had to deal with it.

Zi’er was about to speak. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly looked up towards the distance, “They’re here.”

Meanwhile, someone in the crowd exclaimed with shock, “The enforcement team is here!”

It didn’t take long for the crowd to split open, and then over 20 black armored profounders who held black spears approached.

All of them were Emperors!

At this moment, everyone looked at Yang Ye, and their pity for him was completely undisguised. As far as they were concerned, it didn’t matter how strong Yang Ye was! It was the Sword Alliance’s territory, so no matter how strong Yang Ye was, could he be stronger than the Sword Alliance?

The enforcement team walked over. The middle aged man who led the group looked at Xu Yuntian first, and his face fell when he saw the terrible state Xu Yuntian was in.

“Brother... Brother Lin!” Xu Yuntian crawled up from the ground and walked over to the middle aged man’s side. He pointed at Yang Ye and howled with fury, “Brother Lin Mo, kill... kill him! Help me kill him!”

The middle aged man, Lin Mo, patted Xu Yuntian on the shoulder and said, “You’re Elder Xu’s grandson and a brother of mine. Moreover, Elder Xu has taken good care of us, the Third Enforcement Team. So, don’t worry. No matter who he is, we brothers will help you seek justice from him.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he led the group of experts behind him towards Yang Ye and Zi’er. Xu Yuntian hurriedly followed them as well.

Lin Mo’s group stopped around 10m away from Yang Ye. Lin Mo hadn’t even spoken when Xu Yuntian pointed at Yang Ye and laughed fiercely, “Weren’t you very strong just now? Come on! Why don’t you try and attack now? Come....”

His voice stopped abruptly.

Because Yang Ye had appeared in front of him and grabbed him by the throat. When the others recovered from their shock, Yang Ye had already returned to where he stood earlier, and he was holding Xu Yuntian by the throat.

Xu Yuntian’s eyes were filled with terror. This time, he finally realized the gap between him and Yang Ye.

Yang Ye chuckled as he gazed at Xu Yuntian, and then he didn’t waste his breath at all. He just immediately slammed Xu Yuntian’s figure against the ground.

Bang!

The ground cracked apart and blood sprayed towards the surroundings.

Xu Yuntian wasn’t dead, but he was on the verge of it. He’d been knocked unconscious by Yang Ye.

Yang Ye paid no further attention to Xu Yuntian, and he gazed at Lin Mo instead. Lin Mo clenched his fists and spoke in a low voice, “Are you challenging my Sword Alliance?”

Zi’er couldn’t contain her laughter again, and she glanced at Yang Ye, shook her head, and didn’t speak another word.

“Challenge the Sword Alliance?” Yang Ye shook his head, “I have no intention to do that.”

“You don’t?” Lin Mo’s voice and face became ferocious, “I think you do!”

As he spoke, he waved his right hand and said, “He has openly attacked another, disregarded the rules of Doomsday City, and challenged our Sword Alliance. According to the laws of our Sword Alliance, he deserves death. I command all of you to kill him!”

As soon as he finished speaking, over 20 members of the enforcement team and even Lin Mo charged at Yang Ye.
