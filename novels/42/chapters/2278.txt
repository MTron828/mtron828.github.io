Chapter 2279 – You Should Have Heard of My Name!

The young man before Yang Ye was stunned.

A sword was less than half an inch away from the young man, and he would be dead if it descended just that half an inch of distance!

One attack!

The young man didn’t have the ability to resist at all!

Suddenly, Yang Ye looked up and frowned, and then he gazed at the young man, “Don’t say anything about me!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Not long after Yang Ye left, an old man suddenly appeared before the young man. The old man sized up the young man and asked, “Ling Fei?”

The young man recovered from his shock and bowed respectfully, “Exalt Yun!”

The old man sized up the young man again, and then his eyes narrowed slightly. He glanced at the surroundings, “T-This is the Sword Domain…”

He suddenly looked toward the side, and then he vanished on the spot.

“The Sword Domain!” Someone exclaimed!

Ling Fei looked over, and he saw numerous sword cultivators with swords on their backs. He naturally recognized them because they were his fellow disciples.

Meanwhile, a man walked over to Ling Fei, sized him up, and roared with laughter, “Ling Fei, I didn’t expect you to actually comprehend the Sword Domain and master it to such an extent. Even our ancestor’s sword bamboo forest was destroyed! Well done, kid!”

Ling Fei laughed bitterly, “Qing Yun, I…”

“Haha!” The young man called Qing Yun punched Ling Fei’s chest, “Our Sword Sky City has the southern and northern swords, and now, we will have another. Haha!”

Ling Fei was at a loss for words.

All of them surrounded Ling Fei and kept congratulating him. Of course, even more were challenging him.

Challenging him!

If a person wanted to grow stronger, that person had to challenge those who were even stronger. Only then would that person be able to efficiently improve themselves. Because fighting the strong would allow one to discover what one lacked. As for Sword Cultivators, being able to spar with a sword cultivator who possessed the Sword Domain was an absolutely rare opportunity!

In the crowd, Ling Fei laughed bitterly without end. He wanted to tell the truth, but when he thought about what Yang Ye had told him, he chose to maintain his silence.

…

Outside Sword Sky City.

A shadow emerged from the ground, and then a man appeared over 1km away from the city.

It was Yang Ye!

Yang Ye shot a glance back at the city, and then he left. Suddenly, an old man soundlessly appeared before him.

It was Exalt Yun!

Yang Ye stopped.

The old man sized up Yang Ye, and then his eyes narrowed slightly. There was a wisp of solemness and shock in his eyes!

Yang Ye asked, “Do you need something?”

The old man took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, and then he spoke solemnly, “Three people in Eternal Border possess the Sword Domain. Besides the new Sword Guardian of Sword Ruins, Dark Sword Maiden, I’ve met the other two, and I’ve never seen you!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Now you have!”

Exalt Yun nodded slightly and said, “Do you have a sect?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “No!”

Exalt Yun continued, “Would you like to join my Sword Sky City? If you agree, I can give you the position of vice city governor!”

Yang Ye glanced at him and was quite surprised, “Just because of the Sword Domain?”

The old man shook his head, “No. While the Sword Domain is very rare, my Sword Sky City just happens to have had someone with it. I think highly of your Sword Domain. It contains slaughter intent. I’ve seen experts of the Slaughter Dao, but I’ve never seen the Slaughter Sword Dao. It’s truly amazing that you were able to develop it to such an extent.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “My Sword Sky City is open to outsiders because we hope to converge the geniuses in the Sword Dao throughout this world, so that my Sword Sky City can study them all. We sword cultivators must learn from each other and use each other to mend our flaws to bring glory and prosperity to the Sword Dao!”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Exalt Yun added, “If you join my Sword Sky City, all the books on the Sword Dao and sword techniques we have will be made available to you. I believe that if you join my Sword Sky City, it won’t even take three years for your attainments in the Sword Dao and strength to rise a level higher!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “I do yearn to do that. Unfortunately, I can’t join Sword Sky City.”

Exalt Yun asked, “Why?”

Yang Ye looked Exalt Yun in the eyes, “If I join you, you’ll never have another peaceful day.”

Exalt Yun frowned slightly, “Why do you say that?”

Yang Ye walked over to Exalt Yun and smiled, “I’m Yang Ye! You should have heard of my name!”

Exalt Yun was astounded, “You…”

Yang Ye grinned and vanished into the distance.

Exalt Yun was stunned on the spot.

Yang Ye!

He’d naturally heard of that name. Every large power throughout Eternal Border knew that name!

It was the name of a moving treasure vault!

Three divine treasures!

Yang Ye had three divine treasures, so who didn’t want them? Even Sword Sky City desired it!

Exalt Yun hadn’t expected this genius in the Sword Dao to be Yang Ye!

Yang Ye!

Exalt Yun fell silent for a long time. In the end, he looked in the direction of the city, “You make the decision!”

“Work together!” A voice resounded!

Work together!

Exalt Yun nodded slightly, “I understand.”

It meant to work together with Yang Ye, but not allow Yang Ye to join Sword Sky City. Besides that, Sword Sky City wouldn’t become enemies with him. They would just help each other! That was what Sword Sky City wanted!

It didn’t take long for Exalt Yun to catch up to Yang Ye.

Exalt Yun asked, “Are you willing to work together with us?”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Work together?”

Exalt Yun explained, “It’s very simple. You leave everything you’ve learned and your understanding toward the Sword Dao in Sword Sky City, and in return, we will allow you to view everything we’ve accumulated until now. We’ll help each other. What do you think?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “That is possible. However, I have something to deal with, so I can’t do that now.”

Yang Ye turned around and left once he finished speaking. The important matter at hand for him was to rescue An Nanjing!

Exalt Yun suddenly asked, “Are you going to the Shiyuan Clan?”

Yang Ye gazed at Exalt Yun, and the latter said, “We know a little about what happened to you. Allow me to be honest, your strength is extraordinary, but it’s truly impossible for you to go against the Shiyuan Clan on your own!”

Yang Ye replied, “I still have to do it!”

Exalt Yun frowned. Meanwhile, Yang Ye had turned around and walked away.

“Wait!” Suddenly, an ethereal gray robed old man appeared in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at the old man, “Yes?”

The old man sized up Yang Ye and said, “I’m the city governor of Sword Sky City. I understand that you’re eager to rescue your friend. So, how about we do this? I’ll help you make the Shiyuan Clan keep her safe for a month, and you can stay in my Sword Sky City for this month and make the exchange with us. What do you think?”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “You can make them do that?”

The old man replied, “The patriarch of the Shiyuan Clan owes me a favor. Besides that, my Sword Sky City won’t covet those treasures, so they will give me face and grant this request.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

The old man added, “Allow me to be honest, your current strength is utterly incapable of overturning the Shiyuan Clan. You’ll die if you go now, and that’s why I’ve proposed this. I hope you’ll leave your Sword Dao behind while you’re still alive!”

Yang Ye glanced at the old man, “You’re really quite frank!”

The old man said, “There are millions of sword cultivators, but the Slaughter Sword Dao is extremely rare. Besides that, I believe that with the natural talent you possess, your strength will definitely rise a level higher by studying in my Sword Sky City. It’s very beneficial to your journey to the Shiyuan Clan, isn’t it?”

Yang Ye looked the old man in the eyes, “Tell me the true reason!”

His actions were quite abnormal. Simply speaking, the old man’s desire to make him stay was much greater than anything normal, so his intuition told him the Slaughter Sword Dao wasn’t the only thing the old man sought to obtain!

The city governor fell silent for a long time and replied, “There is a treasure in my Sword Sky City, the Limitless Sword Scroll. It was left behind here by my Sword Sky City’s Sword Master Tian Yu a long time ago. However, no one in Sword Sky City is able to decipher its secrets. If you can accomplish that, we’re willing to share it with you. Of course, it’s fine if you can’t. Just leave behind your Sword Dao!”

“The Limitless Sword Scroll?” Yang Ye frowned, “What is that?”

The old man replied, “A divine treasure! The supreme divine treasure of my Sword Sky City.”

Yang Ye said, “Since it’s a divine treasure, you’re still willing to share it?”

The old man shook his head, “It’s trash if its secrets cannot be uncovered. You aren’t the only one, all the renowned sword cultivators throughout this world have come to study it. Unfortunately, throughout countless years, no one has been able to succeed. So, you can give it a try! If you agree, I’ll go to the Shiyuan Clan now. So long as those three treasures are still in your possession, I guarantee that they won’t do anything to your friend!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Let me have a look at it!”

The old man nodded slightly, “I’ll go to the Shiyuan Clan now. I hope I’ll hear good news when I get back!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He vanished on the spot.

Exalt Yun gestured at Yang Ye to follow him, “Please come with me!”

He vanished into the distance and Yang Ye immediately followed him. It only took a while for him to enter the city again.

Exalt Yun told Yang Ye that Sword Sky City had three peaks, Sky Sword Peak, Earth Sword Peak, and Mortal Sword Peak. The sword intent on all of them was extremely powerful, especially Sky Sword Peak, the sword intent there was exceptionally powerful and even made his heart palpitate!

It was True Dao Realm sword intent!

As for the other two peaks, they only held peak Progenitor Realm sword intent!

Meanwhile, a sword howl resounded, and then a middle aged man appeared before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye frowned slightly when he saw the middle aged man because the man looked quite familiar!
