Chapter 1533 - It Really Wasn’t Me!

Translator: InVader

The voice was very familiar. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

It didn’t take long for a woman to appear in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye naturally recognized her because it was Ding Shaoyao whom he hadn’t seen for a very long time.

Ding Shaoyao!

Yang Ye hadn’t forgotten her, of course. He’d asked Ye Liuyun and Zhuang Weiran to search for her in the lower dimensions, but he hadn’t been able to gather any information about her.

Actually, Yang Ye wasn’t very worried about her because she was too smart.

Based on the intelligence she possessed, it was very difficult for her to fall into a terrible situation.

But Yang Ye had never imagined that she was actually in the large world, and she was the master of The Goat Pub.

Yang Ye grinned, “I never expected you to be in the large world.”

She grinned, “I never expected to meet you here as well.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “How did you know I was here?”

Ding Shaoyao glanced at the surroundings and said, “All of you can leave!”

The old man at the Rebirth Realm hesitated for a moment and said, “Master, but…”

Ding Shaoyao grinned, “If he wanted to kill me, then all of you wouldn’t be able to stop him.” She was naturally aware that Yang Ye had killed five Rebirth Realm experts to enter the large world.

All of them were shocked when they heard her, and then they glanced at Yang Ye before turning around and leaving.

Once they left, Ding Shaoyao said, “I heard you came up here. So, I started to search for you, but I never expected you to actually come here.”

“So that’s how!” Yang Ye nodded, “Shaoyao, how did you get here?”

She replied, “After I went to the Radiant Dimension from Profounder Continent, I met someone upon arriving there. That person is my current master. Because she was done with her business in the lower dimensions, she brought me up here with her.”

Yang Ye asked, “Your master? Who’s that?”

“The current patriarch of the Situ Clan!” Ding Shaoyao continued, “The Situ Clan is a six star power, and it was their help which allowed me to build up a power of my own here.”

A sly smile curled up on the corners of her lips at this point, “Do you know why it’s called The Goat Pub?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Ding Shaoyao smiled, “Because the word goat sounds just like the Yang in your name!”

Yang Ye was stunned by this, and then he shook his head and smiled, “No matter what, it’s great that you’re fine.”

Ding Shaoyao nodded slightly and spoke softly, “I’m fine, but I’m sure you suffered a lot during these years, right?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “I’m used to it!”

She glanced at him and said, “You’re here mainly for the Divine Phoenix Clan?”

Yang Ye nodded, “How much do you know about the Divine Phoenix Clan?”

“Not much!” Ding Shaoyao spoke solemnly, “The demon race prohibits humans from entering their territory. Even if humans enter the Demon Territory, they dare not get close to the Divine Phoenix Clan. The Divine Phoenix Clan’s true strength is unknown because it has been very, very long since it has shown itself before the eyes of humans. However, the princess of the Divine Phoenix Clan, Mo Xiaoleng, frequently travels through the world of humans.”

Mo Xiaoleng! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. That damnable little girl again!

He could be considered to have a certain level of understanding of her character, and she had a huge ego. If she wanted something, she took it, and she would even think that the other person should give it to her. If the other person refused, she would use force instead! Just like Snowy and Zi’er, they refused to go with Mo Xiaoleng, so Mo Xiaoleng took them by force!

Meanwhile, Ding Shaoyao suddenly said, “Don’t go to the Divine Phoenix Clan.”

Yang Ye frowned, “Why?”

Ding Shaoyao shook her head, “I know you’re very strong, but the Divine Phoenix Clan’s strength is even stronger than you think. If you go there now, not only will you be unable to bring them back, you’ll get yourself killed too.”

Yang Ye remained silent.

She added, “You’re thinking of being sneaky, right?”

Yang Ye nodded. He would naturally not go head-on against the Divine Phoenix Clan because he was definitely incapable of that. Even if he could utilize the Stellar Sword Diagram, it was still impossible to fight the Divine Phoenix Clan. However, he had no ties in the large world, so he could be sneaky. He didn’t have to clash head-on against them, and he could strike from the shadows instead!

Ding Shaoyao shook her head, “That won’t work!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She replied, “If it was somewhere else, then perhaps you can succeed at that because you have the Sword Domain to conceal your aura. However, it won’t work in the Demon Territory. Firstly, the Divine Phoenix Clan has numerous Rebirth Realm experts. It has over 20 of them. Secondly, the Divine Phoenix Clan’s members are extremely fast, so just the slightest mistake will cause you to be besieged by over 10 Rebirth Realm experts. Lastly, even if you don’t make a mistake and are able to deal with the Divine Phoenix Clan on your own, can you destroy it? Moreover, it has allies. If they seek help, you won’t be able to escape them while you’re in the Demon Territory!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while, and then he laughed bitterly, “I was quite confident before this, but now that you’ve made such an analysis, I don’t really dare to do so anymore.”

Ding Shaoyao spoke softly, “Your objective is to save them and not destroy the Divine Phoenix Clan. So, you can’t act rashly. If you kill your way there, you won’t be able to save them, and you’ll fall into a state of being constantly pursued instead. At that time, the Emperor Sect and War Pavilion will definitely not stand by idly. They’ll add fuel to the flame instead. At that time, life will be truly hard for you.”

“Do you have a plan?” Yang Ye gazed at her as he spoke. If it was possible, he naturally didn’t want to fight the Divine Phoenix Clan to the death. After all, his objective was just to rescue Zi’er and Snowy. However, would the Divine Phoenix Clan just give them back to him? That wasn’t even the main issue, the main issue was he was afraid that they’d harmed Snowy and Zi’er.

Ding Shaoyao fell silent for a moment, and then she said, “I’ll get someone to investigate and find out how Zi’er and Snowy are right now.”

Yang Ye said, “Can they go deep into the Divine Phoenix Clan?”

She shook her head.

Yang Ye smiled, “So, I still have to go myself. I believe that even Rebirth Realm experts can’t compete with me when it comes to concealment.”

Ding Shaoyao gazed at Yang Ye and said, “If you go, trouble will surely follow.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Do you really think of me as a person who loves to cause trouble?”

She nodded, “You don’t just like to cause trouble, you’re extremely good at it.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “I won’t stop you from going, but promise me that you won’t act rashly. If you act rashly in the Demon Territory, you may be besieged from all sides. It’s the demon race’s territory, so it’ll be very difficult for you to escape once they gang up on you!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t worry. I guarantee that I won’t act rashly!”

She shook her head, “The more you say that, the more worried I get!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

She asked, “When are you leaving?”

He replied, “Now!”

She frowned slightly, “So soon?”

He nodded, “I don’t want to waste time!”

Ding Shaoyao fell silent for a short while, and then she said, “Be careful! Right, there’s another thing which needs your attention. Someone is looking for you.”

“Looking for me?” Yang Ye frowned, “The War Pavilion or the Emperor Sect?”

She shook her head, “I don’t know who it was. However, it’s probably not the Emperor Sect or War Pavilion. Because that person was looking for someone who’d comprehended Quasi Returnal Rank slaughter intent. Moreover, the description that person gave fits you.”

Who’s looking for me? Yang Ye frowned and pondered deeply for a while, and then he shook his head, “Forget it. Right, help me look for someone. An Nanjing is here in the large world, but I don’t know where she is. Help me locate her.”

Ding Shaoyao nodded, “I’ll get them to investigate. Right, that woman outside…”

Yang Ye replied, “I met her in the city. I was new here and wasn’t familiar with the city, so I got someone to help with that!”

A smile curled up on the corners of her mouth, “You’re really good at picking. She’s beautiful.”

Yang Ye smiled with embarrassment, “If there’s nothing else, then I’m leaving now!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure vanished on the spot.

After he left The Goat Pub, Yang Ye left the city swiftly and rushed towards Oblivion Boundary.

Yang Ye was very swift, and he instantly entered the mountains.

Around two hours after Yang Ye left Oblivion Boundary City, a black robed man arrived outside the city. The black robed man’s entire body was enveloped by his black robe, and he held a blood red sword in his grasp. Besides that, he emanated faint slaughter intent. It was extremely sharp and aroused fear in the hearts of others.

The black robed man looked up at the city and was about to enter it. However, an old man suddenly appeared at the entrance and obstructed his path!

A Rebirth Realm expert!

The old man walked slowly in the black robed man’s direction, “Blood Sword Demon, there was merely slight conflict between you and the members of my War Pavilion, yet you slaughtered an entire city of ours. After that, you killed numerous Dualism Realm experts of my War Pavilion, and you even said you won’t stop until you destroy my War Pavilion? You won’t stop? Haha! Blood Sword Demon, when did you start acting so haughtily? When did you become so audacious?”

The black robed man’s face became extremely unsightly beneath his black robe, “I never said that!”

“You never said that?” The old man laughed coldly, “Quasi Returnal Rank slaughter intent and a blood red sword, and you just happen to have had conflict with my War Pavilion. So, if it’s not you, then who?”

The black robed man spoke in a low voice, “I’m looking for him too!”

“What a joke!” The old man spoke coldly, “Blood Sword Demon, I thought you were brave. After all, you’re the only one in so many years who has dared to say that he’ll never stop until he destroys my War Pavilion. But I never expected that you wouldn’t dare to admit it once I found you. Are you even a man?”

The black robed man tightened his grasp on his sword, and he spoke in a low voice, “It really wasn’t me!”

“What nonsense!” The old man suddenly shouted with rage, “You dare to do it yet dare not admit it? Fine! I can’t be bothered to waste my breath on you! Just die!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man shot towards the black robed man.
