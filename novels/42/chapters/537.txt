Chapter 538 – The Strength Of Natural Dao Artifacts!

Yang Ye was just about to attack when An Nanjing stopped him, and she said, “There’s a ninth rank Monarch Realm expert from the Exalted Han Empire outside. You can’t kill him here!”

Yang Ye shrugged when he heard this, and then he gazed at Luo Jun who had a gloomy expression on his face. “Luo Jun, do you know that I really look down upon you? I really don’t know why the heavens would have chosen someone like you to be the Mortal Emperor. I’m not bragging but I feel that I’m much more outstanding than you. Why don’t you just give me the Mortal Emperor Sword and let me be the Mortal Emperor? Because you, Luo Jun, are a true disgrace to that title!”

Luo Jun chuckled lightly and said, “Such a poor method of provocation. It isn’t your place to evaluate whether I’ve brought disgrace to the title of Mortal Emperor. I know you want to fight me. Don’t worry, I’ll make your wish come true!”

“My wish?” Yang Ye shook his head and said. “Luo Jun, you think too highly of yourself. I only want to kill you, and not fight a one on one battle with you. Understand?”

Luo Jun’s face fell while killing intent surged explosively in his eyes.

Yang Ye paid no further attention to Luo Jun. He turned around and gazed at An Nanjing as he said, “What did that ancestor of yours mean when he asked me to stay away from you?”

“He’s worried that you would take me from him!” An Nanjing spoke flatly.

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched, and then he smiled embarrassedly. “That ancestor of yours is really funny, huh?” He couldn’t help but feel embarrassed in his heart. Trick and take An Nanjing away? I wouldn’t mind, but is that even possible?

Right at this moment, the old man in Daoist robes had appeared before Yang Ye and An Nanjing, and then the old man gazed at her and said, “Little Girl, I announce that you’re qualified. There’s no need for you to pass through the other tests. Come with me to inherit Saint Liu Yun’s mantle.” The old man’s face was very calm but the excitement in his heart surged like a team of wild horses. Six types of Intent, and all of them are at the 9th level! Not to mention this current age, she’s a monstrous genius amongst monstrous geniuses even during the ancient times of over 10,000 years ago when numerous geniuses walked the continent!Even though this fellow with a sword is really good as well, I have no choice but to say that he’s really inferior when compared to this little girl. After all, he has only comprehended Sword Intent!

“Senior, this isn’t fair!” Right at this moment, Luo Jun suddenly said, “On what basis are you choosing her?” He didn’t really care about Saint Liu Yun’s inheritance, and he was just afraid that this mysterious old man would give all Saint Liu Yun’s possessions to An Nanjing. If that happened, then he would have come here for nothing. Because An Nanjing would definitely not give the World Portrait to him with the relationship they had right now!

“Fair?” The old man chuckled lightly and said, “Alright, I’ll give you a chance. I’ll allow you to inherit Saint Liu Yun’s mantle if you can defeat this little girl, alright?” As soon as he finished speaking, the old man glanced at the members of the devil race and demon race behind Luo Jun and said, “It’s the same for all of you. Defeat this little girl and you’ll have a chance!”

Luo Jun’s lips twitched, and his face was so unsightly it was like he’d just swallowed a fly.

Mo Xuan and the robust man from the Divine Gold Dragon Clan revealed very unsightly expressions as well.

The old man gazed at An Nanjing with an amiable expression and said, “Alright, pay no further attention to them. I’ve been waiting for many years. Let’s go get the inheritance. I’ll be free once you’ve obtained the inheritance.”

An Nanjing stared the old man in the eye and said, “Do you think I need Saint Liu Yun’s inheritance?”

The old man’s expression changed slightly. He fell silent for a short while before he said, “Little Girl, you possess many inheritances, and every single one of them isn’t weak. Moreover, it’s rare that you’ve actually been able to transform all of them into your own. Even I admire you for that. If it was over 10,000 years ago, then it would only be a matter of time for you to surpass Saint Liu Yun. Because regardless of whether it’s your natural talent or comprehension ability, you’re absolutely not inferior to Saint Liu Yun. But Little Girl, it’s over 10,000 years later now. Even though I’m unable to leave this place, I’m able to sense how scarce the energy in the world has become. You won’t be able to attain the Saint Realm even if you cultivate for your entire lifetime!”

“I’m going to challenge the Heavenpath!” said An Nanjing.

The old man said, “You won’t succeed!”

“Why?” It was Yang Ye who asked this question.

“Because they will absolutely not allow someone like you to attain the Saint Realm!” The old man said in a low voice, “You’re too monstrous, monstrous to the point no one is able to avoid fearing you. So, you’re bound to fail!”

Yang Ye’s expression changed and said, “The Heavenpath is being controlled by someone?”

An Nanjing’s expression became solemn as well.

The old man said, “You’re better off not knowing some things. Both of you just have to realize that you need to become strong, even stronger, and even 10 times or 100 times stronger than anything you’ve imagined. Otherwise, you’ll still transform into a pile of dirt after years of cultivation. Because we’re too weak in the eyes of some existences!”

“Senior, are you trying to terrify us?” Yang Ye said, “Someone in the continent passed through the Heavenpath 10,000 years ago!”

“Who?” The old man’s expression changed.

“The Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor!” Yang Ye said, “He was the only person in the last 10,000 years to pass through the Heavenpath. Not only did he pass through it, he completely crushed it. If it’s really as you’ve said, and those people controlling the Heavenpath are that extraordinary, then how could the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor have possibly passed through it? Besides that, even though he was a monstrous genius, I believe that An Nanjing’s future accomplishments wouldn’t be inferior to him!”

“Where’s that person, the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor, whom you speak of?” The old man’s eyes carried a trace of urgency.

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “I don’t know. He left a strand of his soul in the world, and I was lucky enough to encounter it. However, that strand of his soul didn’t have any of his memories from that time, and he just warned me to work hard and become strong!”

The old man nodded and said, “So that’s how it is, that’s how it is. Haha, do the two of you think that he really passed through it?”

“What do you mean!?” asked Yang Ye in a low voice. The Heavenpath is really getting more and more mysterious.

The old man shook his head and gazed at An Nanjing before he said, “Little Girl, I know that you’re very confident, but don’t underestimate Saint Liu Yun. He was able to become a Saint, so there’s naturally something unique about him. It would be enormously beneficial for you to obtain his inheritance.”

“How about you let him inherit it?” An Nanjing pointed at Yang Ye as she spoke these words.

Yang Ye was stunned.

The old man glanced at Yang Ye, shook his head, and said, “Even though he’s not bad, he’s too inferior when compared to you. Saint Liu Yun would probably not take a liking to his natural talent, but there’ll definitely be no problem if it’s you. Because if he isn’t even satisfied with you, then there’s probably no one in this world that can satisfy him!”

He’s looking down on me!

Yang Ye shrugged and didn’t refute it. In any case, he wasn’t interested in the inheritance. He would definitely be interested if it was a Saint in the Sword Dao. Sadly, Saint Liu Yun wasn’t such an expert.

“He’s very strong!” An Nanjing spoke in a serious tone.

“Not at all. He’s too weak when compared to you!” The old man completely disregarded Yang Ye’s feelings and continued to look down upon him while praising An Nanjing.

An Nanjing intended to say something when Yang Ye said, “Stop recommending me, otherwise, I really don’t know how much more contempt he’ll express towards me. This old man is right, Saint Liu Yun’s inheritance will definitely be helpful to you. Since it’s helpful, then why refuse it? As for me, don’t you know that I’m on a pure path of the Sword Dao, so other inheritances aren’t really helpful to me!”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye with praise. This kid is quite sensible!

An Nanjing fell silent for a moment and asked. “Where’s the World Portrait?”

“The World Portrait?” The old man revealed a slightly strange expression as he glanced at her. “Why are you looking for the World Portrait?”

“Because I need it!” Yang Ye said, “Senior, I’m quite in need of the World Portrait, may I know if....”

The old man waved his hand and spoke in a slightly cold tone. “Kid, since you were sensible earlier, allow me to provide you with a piece of advice. Don’t try to obtain the World Portrait. There are quite a few treasures in Liu Yun Palace, so just go take a few and leave.”

“Why?” Yang Ye was puzzled.

“Because you’ll die!” The old man said furiously, “Do you know what the World Portrait is? It’s a Natural Dao Artifact, a Natural Dao Artifact that has a Natural Equipment Spirit. Do you know how terrifying the Equipment Spirit of a Natural Dao Artifact is? It’s comparable to a Monarch Realm expert! So are you trying to die by seeking to obtain it?”

“Comparable to a Monarch Realm expert?” Yang Ye spoke with astonishment. “Don’t deceive me, Geezer. Are Natural Dao Artifacts that extraordinary?”

As he spoke, Yang Ye pointed at Luo Jun and said, “The Mortal Emperor Sword which is ranked at the 1st position on the Natural Dao Artifact Rankings, but it doesn’t seem to be extraordinary at all!”

“How ignorant!” The old man laughed coldly and said, “Its Equipment Spirit is merely in deep slumber. Why don’t you see how extraordinary it is once it has awakened? The Equipment Spirit in her spear is in deep slumber as well. Once it awakens and merges flawlessly with her spear, then you’ll realize how terrifying a Natural Dao Artifact really is!”

Yang Ye flipped his palm, and then the ancient sheath appeared in his hand as he said, “This ancient sheathe of mine has a Sword Spirit as well, but why isn’t she as strong as that?”

The corners of the old man’s mouth twitched, and then he said, “How would I know? Do you think I’m a god? Moreover, this ancient sheath of yours isn’t a Natural Dao Artifact!”

“How unfair! The Martial God’s weapon is a Natural Dao Artifact, the Mortal Emperor’s weapon is a Natural Dao Artifact as well, yet only mine isn’t!” Yang Ye pursed his lips as he glanced at the ancient sheath with slight displeasure because it was really much weaker in comparison.

The corners of the old man’s mouth twitched, and he was slightly furious. “You idiot that can’t discern anything! Even though it isn’t a Natural Dao Artifact, it isn’t weaker than one at all.”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked. “Why? Senior, do you know something about it?”

“Because....” The old man was just about to speak when a sword howl resounded from the ancient sheath in Yang Ye’s grasp, and then the old man glanced at it before he shut his mouth.

Yang Ye was furious. He’d finally been able to find someone who knew something about the ancient sheath, but the ancient sheath had caused trouble right when that person was about to tell him about the ancient sheath’s origins. What a bastard!

“Alright, let’s get to the point. Both of you come with me to that fellow, Saint Liu Yun’s, palace. Kid, I’m only bringing you along out of consideration for her. So behave yourself when we get there!”

The old man waved his right hand, and then all three of them immediately vanished on the spot.
