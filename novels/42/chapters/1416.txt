Chapter 1417 – Why Don’t You TeaChapter Me How?

A proposal!

Even though Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region had defeated Celestial Demon Stellar Region, it had suffered heavy losses. Just like this very moment. Besides the medium world, Clouds of Heaven Continent, it still hadn’t reclaimed its other worlds. It wasn’t that it didn’t want to, it was that Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region didn’t have the ability to do so right now. After all, Yang Ye and the reinforcements he brought had been the reason why they’d been able to defeat Celestial Demon Stellar Region!

Besides Yang Ye, Qiong, and Elder Yuan’s group of three, Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region didn’t have any other experts.

Because regardless of whether it was Zhuang Weitian or Qian Yaochan, they were all heavily injured, and it was impossible for them to fight another battle for some time!

But Wildlands Stellar Region had sent a group over at a time like this.

Moreover, they were here to propose a marriage!

“What a good plan!” A cold smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth. Even though Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region had suffered severe losses, it was a treasure trove. If Zhuang Weiran married the young master of Wildlands Stellar Region, then it could instantly take Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region as its own. Most importantly, it can rightfully swallow Celestial Demon Stellar Region’s territory!

It was like killing two birds with one stone!

So long as Zhuang Weiran married into their stellar region, it would be equivalent to obtaining two medium worlds and a few hundred small worlds!

In other words, he and the others had fought desperately, yet Wildlands Stellar Region wanted to reap the rewards.

Yang Ye’s face became icy cold when he thought up to this point.

Fen Cangyan’s heart shook when he noticed the change in Yang Ye’s expression, and he didn’t dare speak another word. Yang Ye’s character was really quite terrifying. Especially when he was angry because he would become an utter madman.

The most terrifying part was that this madman possessed terrifying strength as well!

Meanwhile, Zhuang Weiran took Yang Ye’s hand and said, “Wildlands Stellar Region is a three star stellar region that isn’t weaker to Celestial Demon Stellar Region. But it’s fine, we’ll face it all together!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Let’s go and see what they want.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye held Zhuang Weiran’s hand and walked off.

Fen Cangyan laughed bitterly as he watched them, “One storm after another....”

...

Wargod Hall.

Zhuang Weitian and Qian Yaochan sat at the seats of the host. Besides the forces of Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region, there were two comparatively striking men and a woman.

The men were extremely robust. They were much larger than ordinary people, and their entire bodies seemed to be filled with energy. Even though the woman was quite huge as well, her face was very pleasing to the eye, and she was uniquely attractive when compared to ordinary women.

Obviously, they were from Wildlands Stellar Region.

Suddenly, the leader of their group, a man in a luxurious robe, stepped forward. He cupped his fist towards Zhuang Weitian and smiled, “Congratulations, Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region, for defeating a formidable enemy. From now onwards, no power in our lower dimensions will dare to underestimate your stellar region.”

Zhuang Weitian glanced indifferently at him and said, “Man Zhi, if you’re here to congratulate us, then my stellar region welcomes it. However, if you’re here to propose a marriage, then don’t even mention it. Weiran is a stubborn woman. If she refuses, then even I can’t force her to do it.”

He naturally didn’t dare to force her to marry into Wildlands Stellar Region. He hadn’t dared to in the past, and he was even more afraid of doing so now. Because Fen Cangyan had talked to him in private, and Fen Cangyan had told him that he should absolutely not use Zhuang Weiran to make a deal with Wildlands Stellar Region or use her for any other things. Otherwise, if Yang Ye turned against them, the consequences of that were absolutely not something their stellar region could bear.

Actually, he was really afraid of Yang Ye as well. Yang Ye was someone who’d comprehended Quasi Returnal Rank slaughter intent. Moreover, he’d heard about what had happened on Celestial Demon Continent. Or it should be said that many had heard about what had happened there.

A man called Yang Ye had slaughtered an entire city!

He was no fool, he could naturally discern that there was definitely something between his daughter and Yang Ye. Otherwise, how could Yang Ye have possibly slaughtered a city for her? Moreover, Yang Ye even fought the Celestial Demon Lord who was seemingly unparalleled to them! He was very well aware that if he continued trying to force Zhuang Weiran to do things as he’d done in the past, then he wouldn’t just lose his daughter, he would offend Yang Ye!

The man called Man Zhi chuckled and replied, “Senior Zhuang, if I’m not wrong, you agreed to it in the past. You said that you would marry her to my young master, yet you’re going back on your word now? If news of this were to spread, Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region’s reputation would be adversely affected.”

“So be it!” Zhuang Weitian spoke indifferently, “Man Zhi, we’re all intelligent people, so let’s be frank. I agreed in the past because I hoped to obtain the help of your stellar region. However, your stellar region didn’t come to our aid, so I don’t think that I owe your stellar region anything!”

Man Zhi nodded, “I’m sure all of us understand that a union by marriage is actually for the sake of mutual interests. However, I’m not here today to talk about that. What I’m trying to say is that my young master holds sincere feelings for your daughter, and he wishes to be united with her. Senior Zhuang, with your daughter’s natural talent, our Wildlands Stellar Region will definitely foster her well once she is married to our young master. Moreover, it’s very likely that the joint forces of Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region and my Wildlands Stellar Region will become a four star or even five star stellar region. Moreover, it isn’t impossible for us to try and enter the large world!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The large world! Zhuang Weitian slowly clenched his fists. Entering the large world was definitely the dream of all cultivators and stellar regions. Especially those who were at the Deity Realm. Because the only way to advance further in their cultivation was to enter the large world.

It was extremely difficult for experts at their levels of cultivation to advance further outside of the large world. It wasn’t impossible, but they didn’t dare to try. Because if they advanced, then the worlds outside of the large world, the worlds they considered to be the lower dimensions, wouldn’t be able to endure their strength at all, so forcefully advancing would cause Heavenly Wrath to descend upon them.

Going head-on against the Heaven Dao wasn’t unprecedented, but those who dared to do so were peerlessly ferocious and rarely appeared even in 10,000 years!

So, they had no other choice but to advance in the large world. Even though the Heaven Dao would still try to stop them when they advanced there, it would be an ordinary tribulation. Conversely, if they tried to advance in the lower dimensions, it wouldn’t be an ordinary tribulation but a legendary tribulation of death. Simple speaking, it was a tribulation that guaranteed death!

Zhuang Weitian remained silent for a long time before he shook his head and said, “Weiran won’t agree to the proposal, and neither will I. If there’s nothing else, then please leave!”

Even though he knew that what Man Zhi spoke of might be realized. After all, Wildlands Stellar Region was very strong, and its strength would rise a level higher if Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region joined it. So, it wouldn’t be impossible for them to enter the large world. However, he didn’t want to lose his daughter, and he was even more afraid of offending Yang Ye.

Besides that, when Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region was in danger, Wildlands Stellar Region completely disregarded its fate because there were no benefits to helping it. However, Yang Ye had never thought of that and had resolutely helped them.

Even an idiot knew how to choose between Yang Ye and Wildlands Stellar Region!

The smile on Man Zhi’s face gradually vanished when he heard Zhuang Weitian. A short while passed before he spoke indifferently, “Senior, do you think the danger your stellar region is facing has been resolved?”

Zhuang Weitian’s face fell, “What are you trying to say?!”

Man Zhi chuckled, “Senior, you should be very well aware of the situation your stellar region is in. Even though you’ve defeated Celestial Demon Stellar Region, you’ve suffered heavy losses. Even both of you are heavily injured while the other Semi-Deities and Voiders have grown much fewer. Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region can be said to be very weak right now, and many powers are eyeing your stellar region!”

Zhuang Weitian spoke coldly, “That includes your Wildlands Stellar Region, right?”

Man Zhi shook his head and replied, “Senior, just like before, we truly hope to be united in marriage with Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region. So long as your daughter agrees to marry our young master, then Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region’s business is our Wildlands Stellar Region’s business as well. Moreover, our stellar region will help your stellar region reclaim everything it has lost!”

“What if I refuse?” Suddenly, a voice came from outside the hall. After that, Zhuang Weiran and Yang Ye walked into the hall.

Man Zhi’s eyes narrowed slightly as he gazed at them. The expressions of everyone from Man Zhi’s group changed when they saw Yang Ye and Zhuang Weiran holding hands.

Man Zhi’s gaze lingered on Yang Ye for a moment, and then he gazed at Zhuang Weiran, “Our young master holds sincere feelings for you.”

Zhuang Weiran replied, “What does that have to do with me?”

Man Zhi spoke in a low voice, “Our young master has feelings for you, but it doesn’t mean that you can look down on him. He represents our stellar region, so looking down on him is equivalent to looking down on everyone from our stellar region!”

“I’m looking down on Wildlands Stellar Region?” Zhuang Weiran shook her head, “I don’t want to waste my breath on you. My stellar region didn’t rely on your stellar region in the past, and it won’t start now, nor will it ever do that in the future. We’ll deal with our own business. Besides that, you have no right to try and interfere in my own business.”

Man Zhi replied, “Is this your decision?”

She replied, “It is!”

Man Zhi glanced coldly at her and said, “You should always think before you act. Otherwise, it’ll bring calamity to you and everyone around you. Don’t you think so too?”

Zhuang Weiran gazed at him and asked, “Are you threatening me?”

Man Zhi replied indifferently, “If that’s what you think. I have no power to change your mind!”

Zhuang Weiran’s face became cold. She was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly looked at her and shook his head, “Let me deal with such things!”

She glanced at him and nodded.

Yang Ye turned to look at Man Zhi and said, “We don’t want to offend Wildlands Stellar Region, but that doesn’t mean we fear your stellar region. Understand?”

Man Zhi gazed at Yang Ye with a trace of solemnness in his eyes, “You’re Yang Ye!” Obviously, he’d heard of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye replied, “Who I am isn’t important. Just as Weiran said earlier, Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region will deal with its own business, and it has nothing to do with your stellar region. Understand?”

Man Zhi glanced at Yang Ye and Zhuang Weiran, and then he said, “Looks like you really don’t want to accept the good intentions of my Wildlands Stellar Region. Alright, since that’s the case, I’ll be bidding my farewells. Allow me to say a few more words before I leave. Zhuang Weiran, we respect you now, so you’re noble and distinguished. But once we stop respecting you.... Allow me to be honest, even if you come yourself and willingly offer yourself up, whether our young master accepts you will depend entirely on his mood.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Man Zhi and the others turned around and started walking away.

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s voice resounded, “Wait!”

Man Zhi turned around and gazed at Yang Ye, “What?”

Yang Ye looked Man Zhi in the eyes and said, “Take back what you just said!”

Man Zhi stared at Yang Ye for a short while before he said, “I’ve never done that. Why don’t you teach me how?”
