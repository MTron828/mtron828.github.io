Chapter 837 – Pretending Again!

“Just stay in here!” Yang Ye flicked his finger against Fan Meng’s forehead, and then he flashed out of the carriage.

There were 3 old men, 2 young men, and a woman not too far away from them.

Yang Ye’s gaze paused for a moment on the old man who led the ground, and then his gaze moved towards the young man in a red robe. However, it didn’t take long for him to withdraw his gaze and speak fiercely, “How many years have it been? Someone has actually dared to look for trouble with my Dao Order. Needless to say, your Ye Clan is truly formidable!” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“What nonsense!” Ye Zhan roared furiously, “You still intend to put on an act when death is upon you!? You aren’t a disciple of the Dao Order at all!”

Yang Ye shrugged and said, “Since you say I’m not one, then why don’t you just attack me!”

The corners of Ye Zhan’s eyes twitched when he witnessed this scene. He did want to attack, but he was slightly worried. Because if Yang Ye truly was a disciple of the Dao Order, then the Ye Clan would be destroyed. Not only would it be destroyed, even he would definitely die a graveless death.

Even if his son and grandson were gone, more could still be made. However, he would truly be finished if he even lost his life!

When he thought up to this point, Ye Zhan gazed at the red robed man, Liu Sha. But he was stunned when he looked at Liu Sha because Liu Sha was gone! He swiftly turned around and saw that Liu Sha was already in front of Yang Ye.

Liu Sha was less than 3m away from Yang Ye, and a fierce smile had curled up onto the corners of his mouth, “Needless to say, I really admire your courage. While I can’t say that none would dare to pretend to be members of my Dao Order throughout Pine Prefecture, they absolutely can be counted on one hand.”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He hadn’t expected that he would actually encounter a disciple of the Dao Order. However, it didn’t take long for him to calm down and laugh coldly, “Your Dao Order? How truly laughable! Someone actually dares to pretend to be a member of the Dao Order in front of me. How truly laughable!”

When he spoke up to this point, he glanced at Ye Zhan’s group and said, “Your Ye Clan is amazing! You actually dared to collude with someone who’s pretending to be a member of my Dao Order. Very good indeed!”

The faces of Ye Zhan and the others turned slightly grim, and they glanced at Liu Sha with slight doubt in their eyes. At this moment, they couldn’t decide who was telling the truth!

Ye Yue gazed at her husband while the young man glanced at Liu Sha instead, and he had a questioning gaze in his eyes.

“You’re courting death!” Liu Sha shouted furiously when he heard Yang Ye spout such lies, and his eyes instantly turned crimson red. After that, a red ray of light surged out from within him and pressed down towards Yang Ye.

It was Slaughter Intent! 8th level slaughter intent!

Ye Zhan and the others were astounded by this scene. They hadn’t imagined that Liu Sha had actually comprehended 8th level slaughter intent! At the same time, they believed Liu Sha’s identity a little more. After all, the Dao Order was filled with ruthless people, and practically every single one of its disciples had blood on their hands. Since Liu Sha possessed 8th level slaughter intent, they felt that he was definitely a disciple of the Dao Order. Because slaughter intent was usually comprehended through slaughter!

After they confirmed Liu Sha’s identity, Ye Zhan intended to attack. However, he was instantly flabbergasted.

It wasn’t just Ye Zhan, even Liu Sha had opened his eyes wide and shock filled them.

Because Yang Ye hadn’t resisted the red light that came from Liu Sha, and he allowed it to envelop him. But the slaughter intent had only just covered him when it bounced back completely. It was like it had encountered something terrifying!

“You dare to display such slaughter intent before me? How laughable!” Yang Ye laughed coldly as he smashed his fist forward, and the slaughter intent was instantly dispersed. While he hadn’t comprehended slaughter intent, he’d killed many, and the baleful energy he possessed was much stronger than Liu Sha’s killing intent. The only difference was that the baleful energy he possessed couldn’t be released from him like Liu Sha’s slaughter intent could.

“You... how could you possibly....” Liu Sha gazed at Yang Ye with astonishment. There could only be 2 reasons why his slaughter intent didn’t work. The first was that Yang Ye’s strength far surpassed his own, and the second was that Yang Ye had killed much more than him!

The expression of the man by Ye Yue’s side changed drastically because he’d never imagined that Yang Ye would actually be immune to slaughter intent.... My god! Could he have killed even more than Liu Sha?

On the other hand, Ye Zhan and Ye Yue were beyond shocked. Not only were they shocked, they were terrified. Because if Yang Ye really was a disciple of the Dao Order, then wouldn’t they have colluded with a fake disciple of the Dao Order to go against the Dao Order, just as Yang Ye had said earlier? When they thought up to this point, cold sweat started to pour from them.

“Who are you!?” Liu Sha spoke gloomily. This time, he didn’t choose to attack because the man who stood before him didn’t just possess a mysterious identity, even his strength was very mysterious.

Yang Ye replied coldly, “I’m naturally from the Dao Order!”

“Impossible!” Liu Sha spoke gloomily, “I’ve asked the members of my Mortal Path, and none of them have come to Skywind City. None of them are even called Yang Ye!”

“The Mortal Path?” Yang Ye laughed with ridicule, “Did I say I was from the Mortal Path?”

“You....” Liu Sha’s eyes opened wide as he spoke with astonishment, “You... you’re from the Earthly Path?”

The Dao Order had 3 paths, and it was the Heavenly Path, Earthly Path, and Mortal Path. The Heavenly Path was the strongest. All of them were Half-Saints. Next was the Earthly Path, and they were Monarch Realm experts, at least. The last was the Mortal Path. So, Liu Sha was truly quite afraid when he heard Yang Ye. Because if Yang Ye really was from the Earthly Path, then not to mention him, even 10 of him would still die without a doubt!

After all, they weren’t purely divided by realms of cultivation. For example, if he, Liu Sha, wanted to have a chance to enter the Earthly Path, then not only did he have to attain the Monarch Realm, then he had to attain Heaven Rank slaughter intent at the very least. It was only a chance and not definite!

Ye Zhan and the others had turned ghastly pale when they heard Liu Sha.

The Earthly Path? Yang Ye was amused as he was wondering how to continue the act. He never imagined that Liu Sha would give him such a good excuse. So, he placed his hands behind his back and walked slowly towards Liu Sha before he spoke coldly, “How audacious of you to actually collude with outsides against members of my Dao Order. Perhaps I’ll have to clean up for the sect today!”

“Are you really from the Earthly Path?” Liu Sha had calmed down. While he very rarely met anyone from the Earthly Path, he knew that they were at the Monarch Realm, at least. Moreover, every single one of them possessed unique abilities. However, this fellow standing before him, Yang Ye, was only at the Exalt Realm. So, he was quite doubtful.

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath on Liu Sha. He stomped his right foot against the ground and shot forward. His figure instantly arrived before Liu Sha, and then his leg swept towards Liu Sha. The powerful force it carried simply caused the space around it to rumble.

Liu Sha was shocked when he noticed the force that Yang Ye’s leg carried, and he instinctively crossed his hands to block it.

Bang!

Ye Zhan and the others watched with astonishment as Liu Sha’s figure was blasted flying.

Yang Ye didn’t follow up with another attack, and he returned to the side of the carriage instead. Because he noticed that Ye Zhan seemed to be eager to attack.

Ye Zhan’s face fell when he saw Yang Ye return to the carriage. He’d intended to capture Fan Meng and Fan Lan to threaten Yang Ye. Because based on the current circumstances, he couldn’t flee at all. After all, even if he fled to the ends of the world, the Dao Order definitely possessed the strength to annihilate him!

The only way to live was to eliminate Yang Ye!

As for begging for mercy.... He wasn’t that naïve. After all, based on the enmity between the Ye Clan and Yang Ye, begging for mercy would be no different than asking for insult.

As if he knew what Ye Zhan was thinking, Yang Ye laughed coldly and said, “What? You intend to kill me to keep me quiet?”

Ye Zhan’s eyelids twitched, and he spoke solemnly, “I don’t know how my Ye Clan offended you to actually make you act in such a way towards my Ye Clan!”

“I couldn’t stand the sight of them!” Yang Ye continued, “Understand?”

A ferocious expression flashed through Ye Zhan’s eyes, “According to rumor, the Dao Order is arrogant and overbearing. It really does deserve its reputation!”

Yang Ye smiled, “My Dao Order loves to watch as others yearn to kill us yet are powerless to do so!”

The corners of Ye Zhan’s mouth twitched while his profound energy surged madly. Suddenly, he gazed at the man who stood by Ye Yue’s side, “Duan Lang, if he doesn’t die, then both my Ye Clan and your Broken Saber Villa will cease to exist!”

A trace of hesitance appeared in Duan Lang’s eyes. After all, killing a member of the Dao Order carried huge implications.

He hesitated for a short while before he gazed at Yang Ye, “Brother Yang, is there any room for reconciliation?”

Yang Ye paid no attention to Duan Lang. He just gazed at Liu Sha and said, “You’re a disciple of the Dao Order. What do you think?”

Liu Sha had a slightly unsightly expression on his face. At this moment, he believed that Yang Ye was from the Earthly Path. Because Yang Ye’s physical strength was truly too terrifying, and it wasn’t inferior to a Monarch Realm demon beast. Moreover, Yang Ye seemed to have not used his true strength. Of course, he still intended to head back and investigate the matter!

So, Liu Sha said, “Senior Brother Yang, perhaps we can....”

“You really bring shame to my Dao Order!” Yang Ye suddenly interrupted Liu Sha, “You’re a member of my Dao Order, so I can’t kill you. But don’t worry, I’ll report your actions to the higher-ups of the Mortal Path.”

Liu Sha’s heart shook, and he hurriedly said, “Senior Brother Yang, he... he’s just an acquaintance of mine. How could I possibly act against a brother of my Dao Order for him? I wasn’t aware of Senior Brother’s true identity before this, and so I offended Senior Brother. Please do forgive me!”

The Dao Order was cruel to outsiders, but it was even more cruel to its own. Especially when members of the sect fought each other. Just thinking about the punishment made him feel like just dying instead!

Yang Ye said, “You want me to forgive you?”

Liu Sha hurriedly said, “Senior Brother, please let me off!”

Yang Ye glanced at Ye Zhan’s group and said, “Do you know what you must do?”

Ye Zhan and the others turned slightly pale. Meanwhile, Duan Lang quickly spoke, “Brother Liu, all of this was a misunderstanding. If I knew that your senior brother was from the Dao Order, then I wouldn’t have dared to show any disrespect to him no matter what. Brother Liu....”

“It’s too late now!” Liu Sha took a deep breath while a dagger appeared in his grasp. After that, his figure vanished on the spot, and when his figure appeared next....

When his figure appeared next, it was actually not in front of Ye Zhan’s group, it was in front of Yang Ye instead. At the same time, his dagger howled sharply through the air as it swept towards Yang Ye’s throat!

This scene had exceeded everyone’s expectations!
