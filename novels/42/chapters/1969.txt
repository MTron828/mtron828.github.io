Chapter 1970 – Sword and Slaughter!

Above the Sage Realm?

What did that represent?

Yang Ye didn’t know. In any case, he knew that person could kill him with absolute ease!

He didn’t want this inheritance anymore!

He had enough trouble!

“You don’t want it?” The middle aged man grunted coldly, “It’s too late!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened, “Inheritances require mutual consent, it’s pointless to force it on someone!”

The middle aged man fell silent for a moment and replied, “You’re only aware of the danger, but do you know about the benefits?”

Benefits? Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “What benefits?”

The middle aged man replied, “Our line focuses on slaughter, and you’re born to cultivate in my line of the Weapon Path. You…”

“The benefits!” Yang Ye interrupted the middle aged man, “Senior, you should just tell me about the benefits.”

The corners of the middle aged man’s mouth twitched, and then he spoke solemnly, “The benefit is that you’ll obtain the 12 swords of slaughter!”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “The 12 swords of slaughter? What rank are they at?”

The middle aged man replied, “The Sage Rank! You’re currently at the Enlightened Realm. The Dao Realm is above the Enlightened Realm, and the Zen Realm is above the Dao Realm. As for the Sage Realm, it’s above the Zen Realm. These swords are at the Sage Rank. They’re amazing, right?”

The Sage Rank!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and withdrew the Sovereign of Man’s sword, “What rank is this at?”

“The Xuan…” The middle aged man’s expression changed at the sight of it.

He fell silent for a long time and gazed at Yang Ye, “I never expected it to be in your hands!”

Yang Ye asked again, “What rank is it?”

The middle aged man replied, “It doesn’t have one!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

The middle aged man spoke solemnly, “It was jointly forged by many supreme experts, including the Weapon Progenitor of my Weapon Path… Its weapon spirit was even…” He paused for a moment at this point and continued, “It’s called the Sword Supreme!”

Yang Ye was quite puzzled, “The Sword Supreme?”

The middle aged man nodded slightly, “The superior of all swords!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Senior, see? The best sword is in my possession, so those 12 swords of yours are…”

“Can you use it?” The middle aged man glanced at Yang Ye, “If its sword spirit awakens, then you’ll definitely be abandoned.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

The middle aged man added, “Kid, the Weapon Dao Compilation and Six Slaughters I gave you are extremely useful at your current level of strength. The compilation can improve your slaughter intent and purify your Heart of Slaughter; if you cultivate the Six Slaughters, then with the strength you currently possess and the fact that you’re a sword cultivator, you’ll definitely be able to bring out its full strength. Let me explain it like this. If you succeed at cultivating the second slaughter, Earth, then even those kids out there won’t be a match for you!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Are there any more benefits?”

“Yes!” The middle aged man continued, “But I just don’t know what they are for now!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

“Kid, I don’t have much time!” Meanwhile, the middle aged man flicked a seal over to Yang Ye, and there was a small ‘杀’ character on it.

The middle aged man said, “It’s the Weapon Seal of our Slaughter Line. Now, you'll be the Seal Master of our Slaughter Line.”

The middle aged man’s figure gradually turned ethereal once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “The swords! Where are they?”

The middle aged man replied, “In the Weapon Cemetery outside Hell Mountain Range. Once you get there, you’ll be able to subdue them with the Weapon Seal.”

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, are you alive or dead?”

The middle aged man chuckled, and his smile was quite terrifying.

He didn’t answer Yang Ye and just vanished.

Yang Ye felt like he’d been dragged into a trap!

The Weapon Path!

He was a successor of the Dao Path, and now, he was part of the Weapon Path too. Moreover, he was in the line that had been annihilated.

It was a horrible trap!

Moreover, he hadn’t jumped into it on his own, he’d been dragged in by force!

Forget it!

I’ll just deal with things one step at a time!

Yang Ye started to recall the Six Slaughters of the Weapon Dao!

The Six Slaughters of the Weapon Dao could be split into Man Slaughter, Earth Slaughter, Sky Slaughter, Slaughter All Things, Heart Slaughter, Self Slaughter.

Slaughter!

Its core was slaughter! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

There was one more thing!

It didn’t have any set moves, and it was what made it special. Since it had no moves, one would naturally have a killer move if one’s mental state was at the right level. It was completely similar to his current Sword Dao!

His current Sword Dao stressed upon attacking as the heart willed it!

The Six Slaughters stressed upon the same thing!

It was extremely suitable for him!

Man Slaughter!

Yang Ye started to study Man Slaughter first.

“Man Slaughter, kill others with your body. There are a myriad of ways to kill. This move contains techniques to kill people. When cultivated to the extreme, just a thought can kill…”

Yang Ye’s face gradually turned solemn as he read through it.

It was formidable!

Extremely formidable!

That was Yang Ye’s evaluation of the Six Slaughters. Yang Ye had killed many, and he had many techniques to kill. Even his intent to kill was extremely strong and pure. However, he was only barely able to cultivate the Man Slaughter portion of the technique.

It wasn’t that his intent to kill wasn’t pure enough, it was because his skill at killing wasn’t sufficient!

The techniques of killing contained within Man Slaughter were too numerous. Moreover, after he started looking through it, Yang Ye couldn’t help but sigh with emotion—So people can even be killed like that!

Some methods of killing were like art!

But all he did in the past was take his enemies’ heads, stab them in the forehead… His methods of killing were too monotonous!

The Sword Dao! The Slaughter Dao!

Yang Ye noticed that they didn’t conflict at all!

Time trickled by.

In the world outside.

Ling suddenly asked A’Man, “He..?”

A’Man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “It’s his fortune.”

Meanwhile, Snowy flew over to Yang Ye’s shoulder, sized up Yang Ye, and then gazed at A’Man and Ling before waving her claws.

She was asking them when Yang Ye would wake up.

But how could Ling and A’Man understand her?

They exchanged glances and shook their heads.

Snowy blinked, and then she laid down on Yang Ye’s shoulder. While she didn’t like the outside world here, Yang Ye was in danger right now, so she had to protect him. She hadn’t forgotten how she’d obliterated an extraordinary expert with one punch that day!

As far as she was concerned, besides the pagoda, Yang Ye was the strongest existence in this world, and then she was ranked third!

Suddenly, A’Man looked off into the distance, “Someone’s coming!”

Ling turned around. Three people suddenly appeared not too far away from them, and it was the woman in a green dress who led the ground. Two young men were by her side.

They stopped upon noticing A’Man and Ling.

A’Man and Ling were visibly vigilant.

Meanwhile, the woman’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye’s shoulder, and a wisp of surprise flashed through her eyes when she saw Snowy, “A Sprite Lord!”

Snowy glanced at the woman, and then patted Yang Ye’s shoulder lightly. She was telling him to wake up because someone wanted to steal her.

Snowy had seen similar gazes in the past! All the people who wanted to take her had such gazes!

Meanwhile, the woman led the young men towards Ling and A’Man.

They were less than 10m away from each other!

The woman gazed at A’Man, and then she pointed at Snowy, “30 immortal crystals. Will you see it?”

30 immortal crystals!

Snowy blinked, and then fury appeared on her face. Moreover, she’d even clenched her fists.

She was furious!

She was actually only worth 30 immortal crystals?!

It was an insult!

Snowy had never felt so insulted!

A’Man hadn’t even spoken when Snowy waved her claw, and then 30 immortal crystals appeared before her.

Everyone here was stunned by this scene.

30 immortal crystals may be nothing in the outside world, but they were extremely precious in this place.

None of them had expected Snowy to just produce 30 immortal crystals!

Meanwhile, Snowy flipped her palm, and the immortal crystals fell to the ground. After that, Snowy patted her paws together and acted like those immortal crystals were trash.

Everyone felt speechless when they witnessed this.

A’Man shook her head slightly because while Snowy had made a show of strength, they were in deep trouble.

She couldn’t really wrap her head around why even this little fellow had a temper like that.

However, only someone rich could toss 30 immortal crystals on the ground like they were trash!

The woman’s gaze grew even brighter when she saw Snowy act with such intelligence. She sized up Snowy and said, “How rare! You’ve grown to such a level. I didn’t expect to get such a pleasant surprise on this trip to the Dead Dimension.”

She gazed at A’Man and continued, “That Sprite Lord is mine.”

“Is that so?” A’Man glanced indifferently at the woman, “Why don’t you give it a try?”

The woman grinned, and then one of the young men by her side vanished on the spot. He was in front of A’Man when he appeared again.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then A’Man was blasted over 1km away, but it only took a moment for her to vanish on the spot.

Bang!

The man was instantly blasted over 3km away!

Moreover, he spat out two mouthfuls of blood!

“You have some skill!” The woman grinned and was about to attack. However, Snowy suddenly appeared in front of A’Man. She pointed at herself, and then pointed at the woman in a green dress.

This time, A’Man understood Snowy.

Snowy was telling A’Man that she would deal with them!

A’Man hesitated for a moment and asked, “Can you?”

Snowy nodded while confidence covered her face.

A’Man nodded slightly, “Then go ahead!”

Snowy turned to look at the woman, and then she clenched her right fist and slammed it forward!

Her fist shot forward.

Nothing happened!

Snowy blinked. She glanced at her fist and swung it again.

Nothing happened again!

Snowy refused to believe it and swung a few more punches in succession.

But nothing happened!

Snowy glanced at the woman, glanced at her fist, and then turned around to gaze at A’Man before waving her claws lightly.

She was telling A’Man to do it instead!

A’Man was stunned speechless.
