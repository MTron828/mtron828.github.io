Chapter 1460 – Swinging A Casket!

Little Sky Continent? Yang Ye’s face was completely dark, What the heck? She’s trying to take over this place?

Yang Ye’s clone appeared before Little Sky, and he spoke very seriously, “This is my world.”

She blinked and grinned, “I know. But what does that have to do with anything? I’m not taking it from you. I’m just staying here.”

Yang Ye spoke tactfully, “That... isn’t very good. Don’t you think so too?”

Even though she seemed harmless, let her stay here? If Yang Ye were to be honest, he couldn’t rest at ease if she was allowed to stay.

Little Sky spoke seriously, “I think it’s very good!”

“I....” Yang Ye’s face was quite unsightly, Is she really stupid, or is she naïve? Doesn’t she understand what I’m trying to say? Or perhaps she’s feigning ignorance?

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Miss Little Sky, I’ll just be frank. Your origins are unknown, so I don’t trust you. Thus, I can’t let you stay here.”

He’d spoken absolutely frankly and clearly.

“Ohhhh....” She nodded and dragged it out. When she was about to finish, she suddenly looked up at Yang Ye and said, “That’s easy. Don’t you just have to trust me?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, Little Sky walked over to Yang Ye with her hands behind her back, and then she bowed slightly and smiled, “I understand that trust between humans is mutual. Don’t worry, I won’t make you trust me for nothing. I’ll trust you too. From today onwards, we’ll trust each other. Just like.... Right, just like the friends that you humans speak about. We’ll be friends from now on!”

Yang Ye glanced at her. If she was feigning ignorance or putting on an act, then he had to admit that she was absolutely unmatched. However, everything she said and did seemed sincere. At the very least, that was what he felt.

Simply speaking, he felt that Little Sky wasn’t feigning ignorance, and she really did think like that.

At this moment, Yang Ye didn’t really know what to do. He’d never met someone like Little Sky. Should he be forceful? Should he tell her to fuck off? Even though she said that she didn’t know how to fight, who knew if it was true? Moreover, she seemed very sincere. It would have been much easier to deal with if she had a bad attitude and tried to be forceful.

But it just so happened that her attitude was very good. Moreover, Yang Ye was one who gave in to persuasion and rejected coercion. If someone respected him, then he would respect them; if someone disrespected him, then he would kill them!

Little Sky paid no further attention to Yang Ye. She just laid down in front of him, closed her eyes, and greedily sucked in the pure spirit energy and air in the surroundings.

She really likes it here! Yang Ye glanced at her. He could sense that she really liked it here.

Meanwhile, Little Sky opened her eyes and gazed at him, “This place is really nice. There’s no fighting, interests, Heaven Dao, desire.... Everything is so fresh. I want to stay here forever and never go out. Alright?”

Yang Ye asked, “You really hate the outside world?”

Little Sky floated up and nodded, “Amongst all the species in the universe, the human race is the greediest. In the beginning, they constantly strived to grow stronger, and they created cultivation systems and civilizations. But in the end, they became invasive. They invaded other species and enslaved them; they seized, they seized everything in the world. World after world was destroyed because of them. They know how to create, but they’re even better at destroying!”

“Actually, it isn’t just the human race, right?” Yang Ye said, “I admit that everything you said is true. However, besides the human race, do the other races love peace?”

“The others are the same!” Little Sky spoke softly, “So, I hate the outside world. The outside world is covered in blood, and it’s filled with an aura of evil. I absolutely hate it.”

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time before he said, “If you like this place, then stay here.”

Actually, so long as she was within the Primordial Pagoda, then he had no need to fear that she would try anything. Even though the Primordial Pagoda had refused to let her in just now, after he tried to talk with it, the Primordial Pagoda had allowed her entry. Obviously, the Primordial Pagoda felt that she wasn’t dangerous too. Otherwise, even if he tried to talk to it, the Primordial Pagoda would have definitely refused.

Actually, what he couldn’t figure out was why the Primordial Pagoda had refused her entry in the first place!

He’d asked, but he didn’t get an answer.

Meanwhile, Little Sky suddenly walked over to Yang Ye, and she stretched out her hand and tapped it against his chest, “You know... I can sense your kindness. However, your kindness has been concealed. But that’s fine. I’ll be by your side to slowly teach you how to be a good person!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

As soon as she finished speaking, she walked over to the Ancient Emperor Python, and a wisp of pity flashed through her eyes when she saw the miserable state it was in. She was about to stretch out her hand to touch it when Yang Ye suddenly appeared in front of her, and then he pulled her back, “It’s very dangerous.”

Little Sky shook her head, “It’s fine. It won’t bite me.”

As she spoke, she floated over to the python. Meanwhile, the python opened its eyes and gazed at her. It didn’t take long for viciousness to appear in its eyes, but it only took a moment for Yang Ye to see it vanish. The viciousness in its eyes was replaced by a trace of curiosity!

Little Sky rubbed his head gently, and then turned to look at Yang Ye, “Can you release it?”

Yang Ye shook his head decisively.

If the python had let him pass, then he would have naturally not looked for trouble with it. However, it hadn’t. It had almost eaten him instead. So, how could he possibly just let it go? To be honest, if it wasn’t for its strength, he would have chopped it into pieces and fed it to Big Blackie and the others.

Little Sky spoke softly while she shot him a slightly pleading gaze, “It’s very pitiable!”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently and wasn’t convinced, “It almost ate me!”

Little Sky fell silent for a long time, and then she said, “Let it submit to you for five years like the others. Set it free after that, alright?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “If you can make it submit, then I’m willing to return its freedom to it in five years.”

“Alright!” She nodded, and then she turned to look at the python, “Five years. Five years are just an instant for you. So, follow him for five years, alright?”

The python glanced at Yang Ye, and then it glanced at Little Sky before it nodded in the end.

Yang Ye took a deep and long glance at Little Sky because she really was too mysterious. He naturally knew that the python had only agreed because of her.

Who exactly is she?Why do all demon beasts give her so much face?!

Yang Ye didn’t ask her these questions because he wouldn’t get an answer. No matter what, she could be considered to have helped him tremendously. Now that he had the python’s help, his chances of getting to the Forest of Darkness was much greater. After all, it was a peerlessly ferocious beast. Especially when it wasn’t imprisoned anymore.

Little Sky patted its head gently, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “Go on with your business. I’m going to walk around in here!”

As soon as she finished speaking, her figure started floating off into the distance, and it didn’t take long for her to vanish from his vision.

Yang Ye remained silent for a while, and then he vanished on the spot.

So long as she was within the Primordial Pagoda, then he could find her at any time. It could be said that every single move she made was beneath his watch. So, he wasn’t afraid that she would play tricks on him.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye opened his eyes in the outside world. He gazed at the casket that Little Sky had been in. He hesitated for a moment, and then he walked over to it and touched it.

It was icy cold!

The ice casket seemed like it was made of ice. Actually, it really was made of ice, but the ice wasn’t normal.

What was unusual about it?

In the beginning, Yang Ye couldn’t pinpoint it as well. But it didn’t take long for him to notice it. Because when he tried to move the floating casket, he was shocked to realize that it would actually not move at all!

Yang Ye started to exert more strength. However, it still refused to move at all.

How strong was his physical strength? It was at the peak of the Epoch Realm! It could be said that he could even move a huge mountain. But at this moment, he couldn’t even move this tiny ice casket that floated in front of him.

So, how heavy was it?

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment, and then he withdrew Heaven’s Gravestone before swinging it against the casket.

Bang!

Heaven’s Gravestone shook violently while Yang Ye was blasted over 5km away. Moreover, the blood red glow on Heaven’s Gravestone had actually dimmed down slightly.

However, there wasn’t even a mark on the casket!

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he flipped his palm. Heaven’s Gravestone was exchanged for the Sword Precursor, and then he went over to the ice casket and swung his sword at it.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted away again. This time, he hadn’t held back and had used his full strength. That was exactly why the recoil was too huge, and it caused his entire right arm to feel numb. However, he paid no attention to his right arm, and he gazed at the ice casket. There was a fine mark on the casket.

Yang Ye nodded slightly at the sight of this. If even the Sword Precursor couldn’t harm the ice casket, then it would be absolutely terrifying. However, it was still terrifying because the Sword Precursor had only been able to leave a mark on it. Moreover, the mark was exceptionally faint. The ice casket was beyond strong!

However, the ice casket suddenly trembled, and then the mark on it vanished.

It just vanished like that without making a sound, and it seemed like the mark had never been there!

Yang Ye’s face became extremely solemn.

Because the ice casket wasn’t just solid, it had the ability to repair itself! That was absolutely terrifying!

At this moment, Yang Ye realized how laughable he had been when he used the ice casket to threaten the white bears. It could be said that even if he struck it, he wouldn’t have been able to damage it!

It didn’t take long for a smile to curl up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth.

Because the casket belonged to Little Sky, and she was within the Primordial Pagoda. Simply speaking, the casket was his now. Once his physical strength improved to a sufficient level, the ice casket would be extremely helpful!

It could be used to defend himself and to slam it against others! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

If he used it defensively, then even the Sword Precursor could only create a faint mark on it. If he hid within it at the critical moment in a battle, could anyone break it open?

As for swinging it at others, the casket was so heavy, so even the body of the rock titans at Rock Mountain would be deformed after suffering a hit from the ice casket!

It was an absolute treasure!!
