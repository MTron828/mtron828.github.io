Chapter 560 – Let’s Go Home!

Yang Ye was just about to chase after her when he seemed to have thought of something, and he stopped and looked at Su Qingshi.

Su Qingshi walked over to Yang Ye’s side, and then she hugged him lightly and said softly, “Go bring her back!”

Yang Ye was extremely touched by this. He kissed her, and then his figure flashed and vanished from the hall.

Su Qingshi sighed lightly in her heart as she watched Yang Ye’s figure vanish. Meanwhile, Little Yao walked over to her, took her hand, and then said, “Sister-in-law Qingshi, Little Yao will help you beat Big Brother later for not just concentrating on you. You... you have a little baby right now, so you absolutely can’t get angry, otherwise, it wouldn’t be good for you or the baby!”

Su Qingshi smiled as she rubbed Little Yao’s head in silence.

...

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to catch up to Xiao Yuxi with the Divine Gold Dragon as his steed.

Both of them stood face to face on the divine gold dragon.

A short while passed before Yang Ye laughed bitterly and said, “Yuxi, no words are able to make up for the injustice both you and Qingshi have suffered. I just want to say that I won’t give up on the two of you no matter what. You can call me shameless or even immoral. In any case, I will absolutely not allow the two of you to leave me!” Yang Ye had decided that even if he had to wipe the floor with his face, he would still not allow Su Qingshi or Xiao Yuxi to leave him!

Xiao Yuxi fell silent.

This was exactly what Yang Ye feared the most. He walked over to Xiao Yuxi, and then took her hand. He heaved a light sigh of relief in his heart when she didn’t resist, and he said, “Yuxi, do you know? I was actually almost unable to return to the southern territory.”

Xiao Yuxi’s hand trembled slightly, and then she raised her head to gaze at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye continued. “Yuxi, I experienced some things and found out about some secrets that even the Half-Saints of this world aren’t aware of. One of those secrets is that our world is on the verge of destruction. I don’t know when it’ll be destroyed, and all I want to say is that if I’m unable to lead all of you to safety, then I hope I can die with all of you. In that way, we would have no regrets at least, alright?”

Xiao Yuxi remained silent.

Yang Ye spoke softly. “I know asking both you and Qingshi to stay with me is quite shameless, but I really don’t want to lose any one of you. I’m unable to endure losing any one of you.”

Xiao Yuxi still remained silent.

Yang Ye sighed lightly, and then he wrapped his hand around Xiao Yuxi’s waist and said, “Come, let’s go home!” He issued a command in his heart as he spoke, and the divine gold dragon transformed into a ray of golden light that flew towards the sword sect.

Even though Yang Ye seemed to be very domineering right now, he was actually extremely anxious in his heart. He was clearly aware that he couldn’t allow Xiao Yuxi to leave, otherwise, they would be parting forever. Because once she’d made a decision, it was very difficult to make her reconsider it. So, he couldn’t allow her to leave regardless of whether he used words or force!

Xiao Yuxi didn’t resist and allowed Yang Ye to hold her as they flew to the Sword Sect.

...

The Sword Sect.

Yang Ye, Su Qingshi, and Xiao Yuxi sat facing each other in a room.

Yang Ye was the first to break the silence and said, “It’s all my fault. Yuxi, Qingshi, tell me what your decisions are. I... don’t worry, I... I’ll be fine no matter what decision both of you make. I won’t collapse and be eternally unable to break through into the Monarch Realm!”

Su Qingshi rolled her eyes at him. This husband of mine is actually still threatening me at a time like this. Needless to say, she was really worried that such a thing would happen to Yang Ye. She was very clearly aware how much importance Yang Ye placed upon all of this. If the two of them were to choose to leave him, then while he might not collapse from sorrow, he would definitely suffer a blow!

Xiao Yuxi glanced at Yang Ye as well, but she still remained silent.

A short while passed before Su Qingshi said, “Do you know why Yuxi was angry?”

Yang Ye glanced at Xiao Yuxi, and then he said, “Because... because... In any case, you understand why, Qingshi....”

Su Qingshi was both annoyed and amused, and she glared at him before she said, “No one likes to share their husband with another, and it’s the same for me as well. However, the real reason for our anger is that you kept it from us. Tell me, how long more would have you kept it from us if Yuxi hadn’t come to the southern territory and met me?”

“I was afraid that....” Su Qingshi interrupted him and said, “Are you afraid that the two of us would fight?”

Yang Ye hurriedly nodded.

Su Qingshi sighed and said, “How foolish. Both of our hearts belong to you, so we wouldn’t do anything that puts you in a difficult position or hurts you. The true cause of our anger is because you kept it from us. We’re both people who are very close to you, so keeping it from us makes us feel like you lied to us. Husband, do you want to be lied to by your loved ones?”

Yang Ye hurriedly shook his head.

Su Qingshi said, “Leave for now. We have something to discuss!”

Yang Ye was slightly hesitant. They won’t start fighting each other, right? It wouldn’t be a problem if it were at any other time, but Su Qingshi is pregnant right now!

“We’ll leave if you won’t!” Su Qingshi was about to stand up while she spoke, but Yang Ye hurriedly stopped her and said, “Just... just talk properly. I’ll be right outside.” As he spoke, he glanced cautiously at them before he left. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Su Qingshi shook her head and grinned when she saw him leave, and then she walked over to Xiao Yuxi and took her hand before she said, “We really terrified him by doing that!”

Xiao Yuxi finally spoke. “He deserved it!”

Su Qingshi nodded and said, “We can’t let him off that easily. How do you think we should punish him?”

Xiao Yuxi fell silent for a while, and then she shook her head.

Su Qingshi sighed lightly, and then she tightened her grip on Xiao Yuxi’s hand as she said, “He has been living his entire life in anxiety, and he hasn’t been able to relax at all since he was young. Once he grew up, he came to the Sword Sect with hopes of becoming a disciple for the sake of changing the living conditions of both mother-in-law and Little Yao. However, he encountered an unexpected event that didn’t just cause him to be unable to become a inner court disciple, he was even reduced to a Labor Disciple.

“In the end, he finally became an inner court disciple with great difficulty, yet the Flower Palace caused him to be expelled from the Sword Sect. After that, our mother-in-law was killed by the Flower Palace, and you know the rest. He can really be said to have never had a day of peace and stability throughout his life.”

Xiao Yuxi was visibly moved, and her eyes drooped.

Tears flickered in Su Qingshi’s eyes as she said, “Yuxi, have you realized? His viciousness and killing intent are very strong. He really doesn’t attach any importance to the lives of anyone but the few of us. If it weren’t in the southern territory, and if I didn’t care for the Sword Sect, then he would have definitely disregarded the fate of the southern territory once he annihilated the Flower Palace. He’d become very lonely if he loses us, and then he’ll become a downright peerless god of death.”

“He has always been lonely!” Xiao Yuxi sighed lightly.

Su Qingshi nodded and said, “He has to go through all sorts of dangers and battles in the outside world, so let’s not make it impossible for him to enjoy peace when he returns home, alright?”

Xiao Yuxi remained silent for a short while before she said, “I never thought about leaving him.”

Su Qingshi smiled lightly and said, “Even though we’ve forgiven him, we can’t allow him to continue being such a player, right?”

“Yes!” Xiao Yuxi nodded and agreed.

Su Qingshi spoke a few words by Xiao Yuxi’s ears, and then her fair face instantly turned rosy. But she still nodded in the end.

Yang Ye was burning with impatience as he waited outside. He could be vicious and ruthless to his enemies, but he wasn’t able to be ruthless to his own wives at all. Moreover, he was even in the wrong.

A long time passed before the door was finally opened.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief in his heart when he saw that both of them were fine, and then he walked over to them and said, “Both... both of you... are fine, right?”

“We forgive you!” said Su Qingshi.

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he was overjoyed. But he quickly restrained the happiness on his face because he couldn’t allow himself to become puffed up pride and happiness, otherwise, it would be very likely for extreme sadness to ensue.

Yang Ye suppressed the happiness in his heart and took both their hands. He was just about to embrace them when Su Qingshi stopped him and said, “While we’ve forgiven you, you still can’t avoid punishment. From tomorrow onward, you can’t stay in the same room with us for a year!” Su Qingshi blushed as she finished speaking.

Yang Ye smiled bitterly when he heard this, but he quickly let it go. Because it was countless times better than the outcome he’d expected.

Yang Ye thought for a moment, and then he said, “Qingshi, Yuxi, let me bring you somewhere!”

As he spoke, he waved his right hand, and the three of them instantly arrived in the 1st level of the Primordial Pagoda.

“Where are we?” Both Xiao Yuxi and Su Qingshi gazed at the surroundings with shock.

“This is my greatest secret!” Yang Ye said, “We’re in a pagoda, and this is the 1st level. This world is equivalent to our continent in size!”

Su Qingshi and Xiao Yuxi were visibly moved when they heard this, and they glanced towards the surroundings. Sure enough, they were actually unable to see the end of it even with the strengths they possessed.

Yang Ye flipped his hand, and then Sheerwing appeared in his hand. He passed it to Xiao Yuxi and said, “Yuxi, give it a try and see if it suits you!”

A wisp of fondness flashed through Xiao Yuxi’s eyes when she saw Sheerwing. She didn’t refuse at all and just took it before swinging it casually. The space before her was like a piece of paper that was split apart by a sharp blade, and a fine pitch black rift appeared before them.

“Amazing!” Xiao Yuxi praised.

Yang Ye smiled and said, “Do you like it?”

Xiao Yuxi nodded.

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and then the Mortal Emperor Armor appeared before Su Qingshi. He said, “Qingshi, this armor is for you. Even if a Monarch Realm expert attacks you in the future, you’ll still be able to resist for a while by activating this armor!”

“The Mortal Emperor Armor?” Xiao Yuxi’s voice carried a trace of surprise.

Su Qingshi was slightly moved by this gesture, but she hurriedly shook her head and was about to refuse when Yang Ye said, “Don’t refuse. It’s useless to me because my current physical body is much stronger than it!”

Su Qingshi hesitated for a moment before she accepted it.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye wrapped his arms around their waists, causing both of them to blush slightly. However, they didn’t resist.

Su Qingshi said, “We told you just now. You have to wait a year before you can....”

“I remember that you said it would be from tomorrow onwards. In other words, I’m still allowed to today....”

Both of them were at a loss for words.
