Chapter 2230 – Wanna Try?

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “The Sword Core?”

Ding Shaoyao nodded slightly, “You possess the Enlightened Sword Heart and sword intent, and your attainments in the Sword Soul aren’t bad either. Besides that, you possess the Sword Domain. However, you do not possess the Sword Core. No, you do have it, but you haven’t really utilized it!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Please do tell!”

She gazed at An Nanjing, “If I’m not wrong, Miss An has the Martial Core too, right?”

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she replied, “I don’t know!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Ding Shaoyao spoke softly, “It’s normal. Both of you are at your limits, so you know about everything you should know about, but there are many things that you do not know about. I presume even the Martial God and Yang Ye’s father didn’t get the chance to tell you about them. Or perhaps, they had never thought of it. After all, they left both of you to grow on your own.”

Yang Ye said, “Explain it!”

Ding Shaoyao nodded, “Since the ancient times, the scholars have a Scholarly Core, those who engage in martial arts have the Martial Core, and as for sword cultivators, as far as I know, only two people possess the Sword Core. One of them is you, and I’m sure you know who the other one is! The Sword Core is actually just courage. In the eyes of others, the way Miss An speaks and does things is very prideful and arrogant, but it isn’t. She has merely cultivated a Martial Core!”

She gazed at An Nanjing and continued, “Let me ask you something, Miss An, do you always dare to fight, no matter who you’re facing? Even if you’re facing your master, the Martial God, you still dare to fight him, right?”

An Nanjing pondered deeply for a moment and nodded.

Ding Shaoyao said, “That is the courage you possess! Both you and Yang Ye possess it, but you haven’t fully utilized it, or perhaps I should say that you haven’t taken it seriously.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “Both you and An Nanjing should be thinking about how to improve your strength and not go looking for more treasures. You are the true foundation of your own strength, and you’ll still be strong even without treasures. But if you’re not strong, then even the best treasures will only make you strong on the outside and weak on the inside. Of course, you need equipment. You and your enemies are not from the same time, so if you don’t use any treasures, you would be at an inherent disadvantage!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “My slaughter intent is at my peak, but my sword intent is still a step away, but that step…”

Ding Shaoyao spoke softly, “Ignore your sword intent and cultivation for now. You can’t rush them. Come, let’s go to a place and cultivate your Sword Core properly. Both of you have a core, but it isn’t strong enough!”

She raised both her hands, and the scene around them changed.

A short while later, they arrived at a wasteland.

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What is this place?”

Ding Shaoyao spoke softly, “This is where the ancestors of my god race slumber. While they have fallen, they left their inheritance behind. We can give some of these inheritances to you, like inheritances about the Martial Core and Sword Core, but….”

“I Know!” Yang Ye said, “Primordial Violet Energy and spirit energy!”

Ding Shaoyao nodded and walked off into the distance. She waved her hand gently, and the ground shook. A short while later, a ball of white light appeared before her.

Meanwhile, a surprised voice came from within it, “A human?”

Ding Shaoyao nodded, “Our god race has made a deal with them, so please provide them with guidance, Ancestor. Right, it’s about the Sword Core and Martial Core.”

“The Sword Core and Martial Core…” The voice spoke softly, “Rare young geniuses. Huh? This slaughter intent, peak Progenitor Realm slaughter intent…”

The voice was filled with surprise.

Yang Ye said, “Senior, you’re an ancestor of the god race?”

The voice replied, “To be more precise, I’m a Flame of Inheritance of the god race. When the experts and patriarch of the god race perish, they try their best to store all their knowledge with me. I can be considered as a container, and I store the history of the god race and the knowledge of all its experts.”

“I see!” Yang Ye nodded slightly. At this moment, he could be considered to have seen the god race’s resources and reserves for himself.

The voice resounded, “Do both of you know what courage is?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Bravery!”

“Yes!” The voice continued, “Courage is bravery. You possess the Sword Core because you’re a sword cultivator who dares to fight, I presume. However, do you know what its limits are?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

The voice explained, “The limits of bravery is to do what you do not dare to do. Regardless of whether it’s a person or any other living being, their final enemy is themselves. Conquer yourself, defeat yourself, and make only one voice remain in your heart. A person like that will be extremely strong!”

“Do what I dare not do?” Yang Ye frowned slightly, “There’s nothing that I dare not do!”

The voice suddenly said, “Do you dare to abandon all your treasures in a battle with a progenitor?”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and was about to speak when the voice said, “See? You hesitated. You’re very strong, but you’re not fully confident in your ability to defeat a progenitor without using any external forces, right?”

Yang Ye didn’t refute it. It was true, he’d hesitated just now, and just as the voice had said, he’d hesitated because he’d considered if he could defeat a progenitor like that.

It represented that he wasn’t sufficiently confident.

It was a problem!

He hadn’t realized it before this, but he had now. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The voice said, “Have you realized? Your bravery and courage are mostly established on the treasures you possess, and you aren’t that confident in your own strength. Since the ancient times, many intentionally stop using treasure. Why? Because they don’t want to rely on treasures and plan to temper their own courage and confidence, so that their minds and courage would be at its purest state. If you think about it carefully, you’ll notice that no peerless expert you know has a treasure that’s stronger than them, right?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Not to mention anyone else, just his father, Yang Wudi, used no treasures, and it was the same for the Martial God. As for the Unfettered One, he merely used an ordinary sword!

Meanwhile, the voice said, “Actually, it can be described as a flaw in your Sword Heart.”

Yang Ye asked, “Abandon all treasures and external sources of strength?”

“No!” The voice said, “Everything in the world can be used, so why abandon them? Your task is to become stronger than them, and not the other way around. If you are stronger than them, then using them will only add to your strength. You will be controlling their strength, and you’ll still be strong without them. But if you are weaker than them, then it’s equivalent to borrowing their strength and not controlling their strength. There’s a huge difference between them! Besides that, using the strength of treasures for too long causes you to rely on them, even if it’s just a bit. So, once you lose them, you’ll notice many problems!”

An Nanjing glanced at Elysium and fell silent.

Yang Ye said, “In the end, it’s a problem with my Sword Heart, right?”

The voice said, “Sort of. Your sword intent cant advance further into the Progenitor Realm, and this should be the reason. As for you, young miss, you don’t have many issues. Especially now that you’ve come to an understanding. I’m certain that your strength will rise to a higher level soon!”

The voice paused for a moment at this point and continued, “Let’s talk about your Sword Core. Do you want to condense it?”

“Condense it?” Yang Ye frowned, “What do you mean?”

The voice replied, “Condense your courage into a sword. Or perhaps I should say to condense your sword into courage. If you can do that, your Sword Dao will at least improve by 30% or 40%. Of course, the increase will be reflected in your strength too.”

Yang Ye asked, “How do I do that?”

“Overcome the shroud in your heart!” The voice continued, “Let me ask you, if you use all your strength, how confident are you in being able to kill a progenitor?”

Yang Ye replied, “60% to 70%!”

The voice asked, “What if you don’t use any treasures and rely solely on yourself?”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment and replied, “40% to 50%!”

The voice said, “Wanna try?”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Try?”

Meanwhile, the voice said, “Close your eyes and concentrate!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and did it. Suddenly, the scene around him changed, and he was in the boundless starry sky. A middle aged man was standing before him. The man was tall and held a spear in his right grasp.

Yang Ye recognized the spear, it was Elysium!

Elysium!

There was a shield in his left hand, and it was Elyzium. Besides that, the Elyxium was on his arms!

The Wargod of the god race!

The middle aged man was the god race’s Wargod!

Suddenly, the voice resounded in Yang Ye’s ears, “This is a battlefield simulation created from a powerful formation, so fight. Of course, remember that you should not think that you’ll be fine because it’s a simulation. If you die here, your soul will be heavily injured. Of course, that’s not the worst part, the worst part is that your Sword Heart will instantly collapse. You’ll be doomed if that happens.”

Collapse of the Sword Heart!

It was undoubtedly something no sword cultivator could accept, and it was something no sword cultivator wanted to experience!

It was like a collapse of faith!

Yang Ye understood what the voice meant. If he lost, it represented that his confidence and Sword Heart were built on external forces like treasures, and not on his own strength!

Once a person started to deny himself, everything would be over!

Meanwhile, the Wargod vanished.

Bang!

An instant later, Yang Ye’s figure curved inwardly as his figure was blasted away.

He hadn’t even stopped himself when a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth.

Crack!

At the same time, his entire body started to crack open.
