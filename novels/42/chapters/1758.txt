Chapter 1759 – Let’s Try To Pursue Peace!

It was just as Yang Lianshuang had said. The bad public opinion was actually not important at all.

Because it didn’t make a difference.

What they truly had to focus on was the alliance created between the Ying Clan and the other clans!

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang said, “In the beginning, the Ying Clan and the others merely acted against us in secret, and they didn’t do it openly. Yet now, they’ve taken off that mask they were wearing. So, I’m sure you’re all aware of the situation our clan is in right now.”

They nodded. The current situation was worse than it had been. Previously, the Ying Clan and the other clans hadn’t openly declared war against them. But now, their alliance was equivalent to a declaration of war.

Yang Lianshuang added, “I’m not afraid of extraordinarily strong enemies, but I am afraid of being backstabbed. I don’t want to see the Yang Shun incident repeat itself. Of course, I believe that all of you won’t take the same path as him!”

Yang Lin shook his head, “Yang Shun was blinded by fear.”

Yang Lianshuang nodded, “So long as we remain united, why would we have to fear them?”

Yang Ye nodded. Unity was extremely important. Even though the Yang Clan was inferior to the Ying Clan and the other clans, so long as the Yang Clan remained united, it would be impossible for those clans to crush the Yang Clan with ease.

Unless they dispatched all their experts!

But they wouldn’t dare to do that!

Because while those clans had joined forces, they would never fully trust each other. There were no eternal friends between clans. Only their interests were eternal. Moreover, the Ku Clan and Wu Clan hadn’t joined them.

So, every clan would definitely hold back!Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

This made them bound to be unable to truly join forces against the Yang Clan, and that… was an opportunity for the Yang Clan!

Yang Lianshuang suddenly said, “Everyone, go get some rest. Be ready to act on my orders at any moment!”

They nodded and left the hall.

Only Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang remained in the hall.

Yang Lianshuang said, “What do you think about the Yang Clan’s future?”

Yang Ye replied, “I haven’t thought much about it. What about you?”

She walked over to him and said, “It doesn’t matter if it’s you or me, but if we abandon our families and the Yang Clan to focus on our cultivation, then I’m certain no one in this medium universe will be a match for us in ten years. But….”

She looked out of the hall, “Responsibility. From the moment I decided to become the patriarch, the Yang Clan became my responsibility. As for you, your responsibility is protecting your wives. Both of us are tied to worldly affairs, and we aren’t able to focus on cultivation like some people.”

Yang Ye nodded, “If we don’t have our loved ones by our side, then even being invincible feels pointless to me. But the Yang Clan could be said to have let you down all those years ago, so why do you treat it as part of your responsibility?”

She replied, “The people who support me. Many experts of the Yang Clan chose to follow me. If I leave and abandon them, then what would they do? With our strength and natural talent, we can go anywhere, and no one can stop us from leaving. But they can’t.”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “You’re a very unique person!”

She smiled, “You too. To be honest, if you were from where I’m from, then your character… Tsk, tsk….”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Where you’re from?”

She spoke indifferently, “It’s nothing. If I’m not wrong, the Ying Clan and the other clans will be taking action soon. Seize this opportunity to rest up.”

She turned around and left the hall once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time before he went to his estate. Lei Lin and Xue’er were playing in the courtyard.

A smile curled up on the corners of his mouth as he watched Xue’er jump around happily. He didn’t tell them to live within the Primordial Pagoda. Because growing up in the Primordial Pagoda would be extremely harmful to their growth.

Firstly, it was too boring. So, they wouldn’t be able to take it for long. As for the second and most important reason, it was human contact. Humans were beings that lived in groups. So, making them stay far away from other humans was extremely harmful to their growth!

After watching them for a long time, Yang Ye went to the 2nd level of the Primordial Pagoda.

Besides the Divine Yin Flame, there were two young girls here. They were Little Sky and Xiao Qi, of course.

Little Sky spoke softly, “You’re here!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he gazed at Xiao Qi, “Is she going to wake up soon?”

Little Sky nodded slightly, “Her hands have been moving frequently lately. If I’m not wrong, she’s probably on the verge of regaining consciousness. But….”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “But what?”

Little Sky spoke solemnly, “Even if she wakes up, she’ll still be in quite a terrible state. Because she has lost her body, and her soul has suffered a severe amount of backlash. Coupled with the fact that her soul has been without a body for so long, she may really die if she isn’t able to regain a body soon. Moreover, she’ll be completely wiped out of existence at that point!”

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly, “It’s that serious?”

“It’s even more serious than what she just said!” The Divine Yin Flame spoke abruptly, “Kid, you must send this little girl back to her home as soon as possible. Otherwise, her life might really be in danger. Moreover, once she dies, you’ll be in big trouble.”

Yang Ye gazed at the Divine Yin Flame, “Why?”

The Divine Yin Flame spoke solemnly, “Because her identity is special. In any case, even my Master had to give her father some face, and the extent her father dotes on her is beyond your imagination. So, you have to send her home as soon as possible. Even I’m filled with fear and anxiety while she’s here!”

Yang Ye frowned, “Is her identity that terrifying?”

“It isn’t just terrifying!” The Divine Yin Flame spoke solemnly, “You know… If anyone else stole this pagoda, that person would be dead. Not just this pagoda, even I would have killed that person. But this little girl… If this little girl took it, then she took it! Moreover, both the pagoda and I have to protect her!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

The Divine Yin Flame continued, “I’m serious. If she dies, then you’ll be dead too. Because this little girl only suffered such backlash because she was protecting you.”

Yang Ye nodded and gazed at Xiao Qi who was fast asleep on the bed. He planned to send her back home. But not because her father would come looking for trouble with him. It was because he’d promised both Xiao Qi and the old man in Daoist’s robes.

A person could be shameless and go back on his word on many occasions, but there were some promises that he would fulfil even if it cost him his life!

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time before he gazed at Little Sky, “What about you? You’re in soul form right now too. You’re fine, right?”

Little Sky grinned, “I’m fine, of course. You don’t have to worry about me!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he gazed at Xiao Qi again. He spoke softly, “I’ll take you home once you wake up!”

After that, Yang Ye started cultivating again.

This time, he didn’t cultivate in the Laws of sword techniques, and he focused on his realm of cultivation.

He was at the Zenith Realm now, and it was far from sufficient for him. As one grew stronger, the people and problems one encountered would change. Presently, he was facing True Realm experts. He naturally didn’t fear ordinary True Realm experts, but he wasn’t able to defeat 6th stage True Realm experts right now.

However, did any one of those other clans lack old geezers at the 6th stage of the True Realm?

It wasn’t easy to make those old geezers emerge from their closed door cultivation. Because they were the trump cards of the various clans, and they wouldn’t show themselves unless there was no other choice. But even if it wasn’t easy, it didn’t mean that they wouldn’t!

Once they did show themselves, and if there was more than one, then how would he deal with them?

Improve his strength!

He had very little time to cultivate and comprehend in the past. Yet now, he had even more time to cultivate and comprehend the Sword Dao.

Charge into the True Realm!

His current goal was to charge into the True Realm!

So long as he attained the True Realm, his strength would undergo a qualitative change. At that time, his overall strength would improve tremendously.

The cultivation realm, the Laws, and the Sword Dao.

They were the foundation of his strength. His attainments in the Laws and the Sword Dao were at a bottleneck, so they were impossible to improve in a short amount of time. Thus, his only choice was to improve his realm of cultivation!

If it was anyone else in his situation, it would be extremely difficult for them to advance into the True Realm. But it wasn’t that difficult for Yang Ye.

Because he’d comprehended the meaning of the ‘True’ in advance.

The True Realm focused upon the truth.

The Zenith Realm represented attaining the limits in an aspect, and so it was called the zenith. As for the True Realm, to put it in simpler terms, it was the true appearance of all things. Or to put it in even simpler terms, it was returning to simplicity.

Even though he understood what ‘True’ represented, it didn’t represent that he could instantly become a True Realm expert. It required a process, and that process wasn’t that simple.

While Yang Ye was cultivating, something huge had occurred in the medium universe of the Milky Way System again.

It was that the Ying Clan and the other clans had started to act against the Yang Clan.

The Yang Clan had a few thousand worlds, and a few dozen of them were large worlds. Yet now, the Yang Clan had lost half of them.

Those lost worlds had naturally fallen into the hands of the Ying Clan and the other clans.

As for the Yang Clan, it didn’t do anything in retaliation. Moreover, it even summoned all its experts away from those worlds and back to Heaven Void Continent.

This made outsiders feel like the Yang Clan was afraid!

As for the Ying Clan and the other clans, they naturally acted even more haughtily!

The Yang Clan was losing a world with each passing moment.

…

Phecda Hall.

The experts of the Yang Clan were gathered here.

There was a long silence in the hall before Yang Lin stepped forward. He looked at Yang Lianshuang who sat at the seat of the host, “What should we do?”

“Why don’t we try to pursue peace?” A voice resounded.

The expressions of everyone here changed, and they looked towards the source of the voice. They were stunned when they saw who it was.

Because the person who’d said that was actually Yang Ye!
