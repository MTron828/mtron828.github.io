Chapter 1645 - The More Useful One Lives!

Translator: InVader

Silence!

Deathly silence!

This time, Yang Ye hadn’t just slapped the Discipline Hall on the face, he’d stomped on its face.

He’d killed two members of the Discipline Hall in succession, and they were an elder and vice hall master!

This time, the Discipline Hall had really bitten off more than it could chew.

However, it was what many people in the Yang Clan hoped to see. Or it should be said that many took pleasure in the Discipline Hall’s misfortune. After all, it was extremely arrogant, and it specialized in doing things that offended others. So, seeing the Discipline Hall suffer made many people cry out with happiness in their hearts!

If the Discipline Hall couldn’t deal with Yang Ye today, then it was obvious that its influence and prestige in the Yang Clan would vanish completely. In the future, more and more would stop giving it face!

“Why isn’t the Council of Elders doing anything?” The old man behind Yang Jian spoke abruptly in a low voice, “A senior Zenith Realm expert and a Half-Step True Realm expert were lost just like that.”

Yang Jian shook his head slightly, “They can’t!”

The old man was puzzled, “Why?”

Yang Jian gazed at Yang Ye, “This time, it’s the Discipline Hall that’s in the wrong. Because they should have stepped forward and stopped Yang Xu and Yang Yan from trying to kill Yang Ye. However, they didn’t, and they even allowed Yang Xu to continue. If Yang Ye was weak and killed, then it wouldn’t be a problem. But they didn’t expect him to be so strong. Besides that, when Yang Lin took Yang Xu’s side, the Discipline Hall was bound to have no way to back down anymore.”

Yang Jian paused for a moment at this point, and then he continued, “If the Council of Elders helps the Discipline Hall and takes its side, then it would represent that they’re abandoning Yang Ye. Just think about it, if the Council of Elders took the Discipline Hall’s side, then based on Yang Ye’s character, his heart would definitely not be with the clan anymore, and he may even leave the clan. Even if he doesn’t leave the clan, he would definitely hold a grudge against the Discipline Hall and Council of Elders. He may not have the strength to take revenge now, but what about in the future?”

The old man nodded, “Obviously, the Council of Elders doesn’t want to abandon him.”

“Of course!” A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Jian’s mouth, “Yang Ye is just at the Rebirth Realm now, but he killed a Half-Step True Realm expert, so what would happen when he attains the Zenith Realm and Half-Step True Realm?”

The black robed old man fell silent.

Meanwhile, Yang Jian added, “In the Yang Clan, the more useful person gains the clan’s support. If irreconcilable enmity arises between our eldest young miss and Yang Ye, then I believe the Council of Elders will abandon Yang Ye and allow her to kill him!”

He paused for a moment and continued, “There’s no familial love in the Yang Clan! The more useful one lives!”

The old man fell silent and didn’t dare say anything.

Meanwhile, the city gates of Phecda City creaked open slowly, and then an old man in a violet robe walked out from within the city.

The expressions of everyone here changed when they saw the old man.

Yang Xuan’s eyes narrowed slightly while her fists were clenched tightly. As for Gu Xiu and Qian Hu, they frowned.

Meanwhile, the eldest young master, Yang Jian’s, expression had turned extremely solemn as well.

At this moment, everyone had solemn expressions on their faces. Because they hadn’t expected this old man to step forward himself.

Because the old man was the Discipline Hall’s Master, Yang Lu!

The master of the Discipline Hall!

Just like the patriarch and Council of Elders, the master of the Discipline Hall was a legendary figure as well. Because even most of the Yang Clan’s members had never seen him. Yet now, they hadn’t expected that he actually came himself.

Lu Lige’s expression had turned solemn as well, “A True Realm expert!”

The True Realm! Yang Ye gazed at Yang Lu in silence, and his gaze was absolutely calm. However, the Divine Yin Flame in the 2nd level of the Primordial Pagoda had started to flicker.

Yang Lu stopped around 1.5m away from Yang Ye. He sized up Yang Ye and nodded, “Rare, truly rare. You were able to grow to such an extent without relying on the help and resources of the clan. You’re really not bad.”

Yang Ye looked up at Yang Lu, “Shall we fight?”

Shall we fight?

Countless people were stunned by this!

Shall we fight!

Yang Ye had challenged the Discipline Hall’s master!

Has he gone mad? Everyone had this question in their minds. After all, the master of the Discipline Hall was a True Realm expert!

Even though the True Realm wasn’t the limit of the medium universe in Milky Way System, they were absolutely rare. At the very least, the Yang Clan didn’t have more than five that were known to the public!

Yet now, Yang Ye had actually challenged a True Realm expert! But he was only at the Rebirth Realm!

As far as many were concerned, it wasn’t courage but madness and conceit!

Lu Lige was stunned when he heard Yang Ye, and then he gulped while cold sweat flowed down his head.

Yang Ye had challenged a True Realm expert!

Not to mention a True Realm expert, Lu Lige didn’t even dare to challenge a Half-Step True Realm expert, but Yang Ye had dared to do so!

Moreover, Yang Ye was only at the Rebirth Realm!

In the sky above Phecda City, Yang Gu suddenly chuckled, “Interesting! This little fellow is getting more and more interesting.”

Yang Ceng nodded, “It is getting more and more interesting.”

Meanwhile, Yang Lu stared at Yang Ye. Because he too had never expected Yang Ye to actually dare to challenge him.

A Rebirth Realm cultivator challenging a True Realm expert?

It wasn’t unheard of in history, but such monstrous geniuses had rarely existed. They could be counted with just two hands!

A moment of silence ensued before Yang Lu replied, “Actually, I’m quite curious. I’m curious about what makes you so confident.”

Yang Ye shrugged, “There’s no reason. I just don’t have a way out, right?”

Yang Lu nodded slightly, “Neither does my Discipline Hall. However…” He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Just killing you is quite a pity, and my subordinates were in the wrong. So, how about we do this? You resist an attack of mine. If you succeed, then my Discipline Hall will let bygones be bygones. What do you think?”

Lu Lige suddenly asked, “What if he fails?”

Yang Lu spoke indifferently, “Then he deserves death!”

Lu Lige gazed at Yang Ye, and then shook his head while speaking via voice transmission, “True Realm experts are unfathomably strong. You definitely won’t be able to withstand his full strength.”

Yang Ye gazed at Lu Lige and chuckled, “I can’t back down now, and I don’t want to!”

As he spoke, he gazed at Yang Lu, “If I succeed, then we can let bygones be bygones. However, there’s one more thing that I want. I want you to stop interfering in the enmity between me and Yang Xu’s family.”

Yang Lu fell silent for a moment before he said, “You refuse to compromise?”

Yang Ye looked Yang Lu in the eyes, “I know that if your Discipline Hall wants to protect them, then I’ll definitely be unable to kill them today. But what about in the future? I’m quite a petty and vengeful person. If you stop me today, then I’ll make the Discipline Hall vanish from the Yang Clan in the future!”

Yang Xu’s face became gloomy, but he remained silent. No one knew what he was thinking.

Yang Lu gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he said, “Aren’t you afraid that I’ll kill you?”

Yang Ye replied, “You won’t hold back anyway, right?”

Yang Lu nodded, “True. Then, are you ready?”

Yang Ye turned to look at Lu Lige, “Leave.”

Lu Life was slightly stunned, “What are you trying to say?”

Yang Ye replied, “I was very surprised that you came, but this is my own business. So, don’t interfere. Leave now. Otherwise, if anything happens to me, then you’ll be buried with me.”

Lu Lige shook his head, “I wouldn’t be able to forgive myself if I leave now. To be honest, I don’t really want to have anything to do with you. Because you’re too sneaky sometimes. But you’re really loyal too. For example, the Rebirth Fruit. If it wasn’t for you, I would probably still be at the Dualism Realm. So, since you’re a good friend, I, Lu Lige, have to be one too.”

He turned to look at Yang Xu and Yang Lu, and then he continued, “Even though I’m quite afraid right now, it can’t be helped. I can’t afford to suffer the insult and humiliation from leaving right now!”

Yang Ye gazed at Lu Lige for a long time before he said, “Why don’t you help me to the end and help me withstand that attack?”

“Fuck off!” Lu Lige cursed. However, it didn’t take long for him to pause for a moment and say, “Be careful.”

Yang Ye smiled, and then he turned to look at Yang Lu, “I’m ready. Bring it on.”

Yang Lu asked, “Are you sure?”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he vanished on the spot. At the same time, the shadow behind Yang Lu trembled slightly!

The best defense was offense!

Yang Ye would never foolishly stand there and defend himself! Attacking was his style!

Yang Ye’s sword pierced through the back of Yang Lu’s head. However, there was no blood because it was just an afterimage.

At this moment, Yang Lu was where Yang Ye had been a moment ago.

Yang Ye glanced at Yang Lu, and his face became solemn, extremely solemn.

Yang Lu glanced indifferently at Yang Ye, “The Laws of Darkness that’s comparable to the Zenith Rank. Not bad. It’s the first time I’m seeing it. Unfortunately, you don’t understand what the True Realm represents. Otherwise, you wouldn’t challenge me. Now, it’s my turn.”

He took a step forward while he spoke, and then he tapped his finger forward in Yang Ye’s direction.

Everything here seemed to have stopped at this moment, and then everyone watched as the space in front of Yang Lu started to vanish bit by bit. It seemed like paper that had been lit up in flames, and it was vanishing bit by bit.

The space there hadn’t collapsed, it had vanished! Truly vanished!

Yang Ceng asked, “Should we take action?”

Yang Gu fell silent for an instant before he shook his head, “It’s a bet between them. Even if we interfere and save him, Old Man Lu will definitely stop at nothing to kill him. Even though the Discipline Hall is below us in authority, we can’t slap their faces for no reason. After all, it’s a fair fight.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Yang Ceng nodded and didn’t speak again.

Meanwhile, at the moment the space there started to vanish, Yang Ye instantly started clenching his fists.

It was impossible to withstand!

That was what he felt!

Suddenly, a ray of white light flashed, and then Snowy appeared in front of Yang Ye. She blinked as she gazed at Yang Ye, and then cracked a smile. After that, she raised her claws, and a wooden sword appeared in her claws.
