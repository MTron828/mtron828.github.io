Chapter 1411 – Qiong Qi? Celestial Demon Wolf?

The reason he was so composed was naturally because he had a trump card, and it was Qiong Qi, of course.

Many people felt that his strength rose extremely swiftly, and he was advancing by leaps and bounds. However, Qiong Qi was actually the fast one. Qiong Qi’s strength rose at a truly terrifying rate. Actually, it couldn’t be said to be rising, it was recovering.

How strong was Qiong Qi at his peak? FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye didn’t know. In any case, he knew Qiong Qi was very strong. Even Zhuang Weiran was probably unable to restrain Qiong Qi, and only experts at Blind Maiden’s level might be able to suppress him. As for how strong Qiong Qi was, it wasn’t important. All that mattered was summoning Qiong Qi. Even if he couldn’t kill everyone here, Qiong Qi could still act as a shield for him.

The Demon Lord and the others frowned when they heard Yang Ye. He has help? They didn’t dare act carelessly and became vigilant. At the same time, their divine sense swept incessantly through the surroundings as a precaution against sudden attacks.

However, nothing happened after around 5 breaths of time passed.

Yang Ye’s face couldn’t help but darken. Why can’t that fellow give me face for one?!

“How laughable!” Meanwhile, a wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of the Demon Lord’s mouth, and then he waved his right hand. The Celestial Demon Wolves that had stopped on the spot earlier immediately transformed into two rays of dark light that charged in Yang Ye’s direction.

Roar!

Suddenly, a furious roar resounded from Yang Ye’s chest, and then a ray of black light emerged from there. It shot forward at an alarming speed and slammed against the Celestial Demon Wolves.

Bang!

The others watched with shock as both wolves were blasted over 5km away.

This shocked all the spectators, and they immediately gazed at the ball of black light near Yang Ye. It didn’t take long for the black light to disperse, and then Qiong Qi appeared before them. Just like the Celestial Demon Wolves, Qiong Qi’s entire body emanated a ferocious aura. However, it was even purer than those two wolves.

An ominous beast!

Everyone here had quite the discerning eye. Even though they didn’t know what type of demon beast Qiong Qi was because of his strange appearance, they knew that he was definitely an ominous beast, and he was an extraordinarily ominous beast. After all, he was capable of blasting both Celestial Demon Wolves away with a single attack!

The Demon Lord and the others’ expressions became solemn. They hadn’t expected Yang Ye to be hiding such a beast in his body, and it was no ordinary ominous beast.

Meanwhile, the two wolves in the distance revealed terror in their eyes!

Danger!

Qiong Qi felt dangerous to them. However, it didn’t take long for the fear in their eyes to transform into ferocity, and then they howled with fury before transforming into rays of dark light and charged at Qiong Qi.

They were ominous beasts comparable to peak Deities, so they would naturally not be afraid of Qiong Qi.

A wisp of ferocity flashed through Qiong Qi’s eyes as the wings on his back suddenly unfolded. After that, he vanished on the spot, and he was in front of the wolves when his figure appeared again. Qiong Qi didn’t use any flashy moves, and he just slammed his figure against one of the Celestial Demon Wolves.

A vicious glow flashed through that wolf’s eyes, and it didn’t dodge and sped up to slam its body against Qiong Qi as well.

Bang!

The Celestial Demon Beast that collided with Qiong Qi was blasted away!

After he blasted that wolf away, Qiong Qi turned around swiftly and slapped his claw at the other wolf which was behind him.

Bang!

An explosion resounded as that Celestial Demon Wolf was blasted backwards, and there was an almost 2m long gash on its forehead!

Suffering an injury from Qiong Qi’s attack made a vicious glow flash through that Celestial Demon Wolf’s eyes, and then ferocity covered its face while a dazzling ray of dark light erupted from within it. Its hairs instantly stood on end like numerous black needless, causing the Celestial Demon Wolf to seem even more ferocious.

At the same time, the hairs on the other wolf had stood on end as well. Moreover, their bodies had become more than three times larger.

Roar! Roar!

They didn’t waste any time. They immediately howled with fury and transformed into dark rays of light which shot explosively in Qiong Qi’s direction.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly charged off in Qiong Qi’s direction, “Qiong Qi, let me help you!”

If he joined forces with Qiong Qi, his Heavenrend’s strength would rise to a new height. So, dealing with those two Celestial Demon Wolves would only take two swings of his sword.

However, Qiong Qi waved his claw at Yang Ye and said, “I’ll do it myself.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Qiong Qi’s body gradually grew larger and larger. It didn’t take long for his body to become more than five times larger than before. After that, he flapped his wings and transformed into a beam of black light that slammed against the Celestial Demon Wolves.

Suddenly, the Demon Lord shouted, “Attack!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure shot explosively in Yang Ye’s direction. The violet robed old man and the others didn’t just stand by idly. All of them charged at Yang Ye and Zhuang Weiran as well.

When she saw them charge, Zhuang Weiran turned to look at Yang Ye who was standing by his side, “It’s my fault for dragging you into this situation.”

Yang Ye turned to look at her, took her hand, and grinned, “Why speak of such things between us?”

She nodded, “Right!”

The Demon Lord’s group was growing closer and closer. Eight formidable auras smashed down upon Yang Ye and Zhuang Weiran. At this moment, even his Rebirth Rank sword intent and Quasi Returnal Rank slaughter intent were on the verge of being unable to resist their auras.

Yang Ye’s gaze gradually turned icy cold, and it didn’t take long for the Stellar Sword Diagram to appear in his grasp.

Right when Yang Ye was about to activate it....

Roar! Roar!

Two furious roars resounded from afar, and those roars carried extremely obvious pain. The Demon Lord was shocked because those roars had come from the Celestial Demon Wolves.

The Demon Lord and the others stopped before turning around to look towards the source of the roars. The two Celestial Demon Wolves were suffering a flurry of attacks from Qiong Qi. Qiong Qi’s claws were too short, and they were much sharper than the claws of the Celestial Demon Wolves. Every single swipe of his claw left a huge gash on the Celestial Demon Wolves.

The two Celestial Demon Wolves were actually stronger than the demonic dragon Yang Ye had encountered on Dark Hell Continent. However, their defenses couldn’t compare to the demonic dragon, and even that demonic dragon couldn’t resist Qiong Qi’s claws!

Qiong Qi wasn’t just swift, he was strong, and his claws were extremely sharp. While his defenses weren’t especially strong, ordinary people were utterly incapable of harming him because of his speed.

The Demon Lord and the others were astounded when they saw that both Celestial Demon Wolves were in a disadvantaged situation. All of them exchanged glances, and it didn’t take long for the Demon Lord and the violet robed old man to charge towards Qiong Qi. As for the remaining 6 Deities, they shot towards Yang Ye instead.

Suddenly, Qiong Qi grabbed a Celestial Demon Wolf’s tail with both his claws, and then he dragged it along as he transformed into a ray of dark light that shot towards Yang Ye.

Everyone here was stunned!

Even Yang Ye was stunned. What’s that fellow trying to do?

Yang Ye watched with astonishment as Qiong Qi dragged that Celestial Demon Wolf into his chest.

Yang Ye’s figure instantly stiffened on the spot. Suddenly, Qiong Qi emerged from Yang Ye’s chest, and then he charged at the remaining Celestial Demon Wolf that had a gaze filled with bewilderment.

The other Celestial Demon Wolf had a ferocious glow in its eyes when it saw Qiong Qi charge at it, and then it charged at Qiong Qi. However, Qiong Qi didn’t go head on against it. He just went around the Celestial Demon Wolf, grabbed its tail with both claws, and then repeated the same thing he’d done earlier. He dragged the wolf along as he transformed into a ray of black light that entered Yang Ye’s chest.

Everyone was stunned by this scene!

Where did those two Celestial Demon Wolves go?

All of them were bewildered.

Others didn’t know where they’d gone, but Yang Ye naturally did. Qiong Qi had dragged them into the 1st level of the Primordial Pagoda.

After he’d dragged the 2nd Celestial Demon Wolf in there, Qiong Qi glanced up into the sky. He seemed to fear something, so he didn’t dare to stay and immediately transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot. Meanwhile, the Celestial Demon Wolves were stunned for a while, and then they intended to leave like Qiong Qi had. But a wave of terrifying pressure suddenly appeared out of thin air, and then it pressed down upon them.

Bang! Bang!

Both of them were slammed flat on the ground.

They were shocked, and they looked up towards the surroundings. They seemed to be looking for something, but there was nothing around them.

They exchanged glances and intended to stand up again. However, the pressure suddenly appeared out of thin air again and slammed down upon them.

Bang! Bang!

The Celestial Demon Wolves were pressed flat on the ground again. This time, the pressure didn’t vanish, and it just constantly pressed down upon them. It didn’t take long for them to start shivering beneath it, and they howled with sorrow. Their howls were filled with pain and a trace of despair. In the end, it even seemed like they were pleading!

...

Meanwhile, the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth had curled up slightly.

The Primordial Pagoda’s strength was limited in the outside world. But if it was inside the Primordial Pagoda, then not to mention those two Celestial Demon Wolves, even Qiong Qi would fear it.

After all, Qiong Qi hadn’t dared to enter it until now. He’d been using a special method to stay on Yang Ye’s chest and not within Yang Ye. Why? Because while there was abundant spirit energy within the Primordial Pagoda and it would be very beneficial to stay within it, Qiong Qi was afraid of the Primordial Pagoda!

The Primordial Pagoda couldn’t do anything to him while he was outside of it. At the very least, the Primordial Pagoda couldn’t do anything to him for now. But if he were to enter it, then if it acted against him, the consequences he faces would be exactly like what the two Celestial Demon Wolves were suffering right now!

The Primordial Pagoda was almighty within its territory!

“What did you do to them?!” The Demon Lord stared fixedly at Yang Ye. He hadn’t signed an agreement with the Celestial Demon Wolves. Because even he wasn’t qualified to make them submit to him. They were just working together. So, he had no idea whether they were dead or alive.

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath on the Demon Lord. He gazed at Qiong Qi and said, “Lend me your back!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye hung the ancient sheath on his waist, and then sat on Qiong Qi’s back. After that, he grabbed one of Qiong Qi’s horns with his left hand while his right hand grasped the hilt of his sword.

He glanced coldly at the violet robed old man, the Demon Lord, and the others, “Spare no one!”
