Chapter 2009 – Lowly Race!

Excuse him?

Everyone here was stunned.

All of them gazed at Yang Ye.

Who is he?

Yang Ye was slightly stunned as well. He glanced at Gu Cangyan and asked, “You know me?”

Gu Cangyan nodded slightly, “I saw you once in Southern Qilin Mountain!”

A cultivator from Southern Qilin Mountain!

Yang Ye nodded slightly. No wonder he’s so strong.

Meanwhile, Gu Cangyan said, “I didn’t expect to see you here. A Sage Ruins is opening in my Devil Dimension, three days from now. If you don’t mind, we can go together.”

All the members of the sky race were flabbergasted by this. Isn’t Gu Cangyan a little too courteous to that guy?

If Yang Ye didn’t mind!

Even though Gu Cangyan was from the devil race, they had to admit that Gu Cangyan was very strong, extremely even. However, it was exactly such an extraordinary expert who was actually being so courteous to the man in green clothes!

It was normal for Gu Cangyan to be courteous to Yang Ye, and he himself felt that there was nothing wrong about it. After all, he’d witnessed Yang Ye’s strength in the Dead Dimension. Moreover, Yang Ye had even fought a Zen Realm expert.

At that time, Zen Realm experts were existences that he could only look up to, but Yang Ye had already been able to fight them. Moreover, Yang Ye was probably even stronger now. Because his instinct told him that Yang Ye was very dangerous!

This instinct was something he’d honed in the Dead Dimension, and it was extremely accurate!

A Sage Ruins? Yang Ye frowned slightly. A short while passed before he said, “If I have the time.”

Gu Cangyan said, “I’ll be in the Sky Dimension for the next three days. You can contact me at any time if you plan on going!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Alright!”

Gu Cangyan nodded, and then he glanced at the surroundings, “Tell the next to come!”

The woman in front of Gu Cangyan spoke in a low voice, “He’ll be here very soon!”

Gu Cangyan nodded slightly, “Then I’ll wait for him!”

He closed his eyes slowly once he finished speaking.

The woman withdrew her gaze and flashed over to Yang Ye, “You dare to return?!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Why not?”

She looked him in the eyes, “Do you want to die?”

Yang Ye smiled, “You’re still so conceited. Right, I want to ask you something. Where’s Xiao Qi?”

She replied, “Out of consideration for Xiao Qi, I’ll give you a piece of advice. Leave immediately before my father notices your presence. You still have time now. Otherwise, if he notices your presence in the Sky Dimension, no one will be able to save you!”

“Is that so?” Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “I’m so afraid!”

The woman’s face fell, “Do as you wish.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and walked away. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Out of consideration for Xiao Qi, I’ll give you some advice too. Star Destroyer is a good sword, but its user is a weakling. A sword is used by a person, yet you made the sword the principal. How stupid do you have to be in order to do that?”

“You!” She turned around and glared at Yang Ye.

However, Yang Ye ignored her and gazed towards the distant sky. The space there was trembling, and then a pitch black rift appeared there. A moment later, a figure shot out from it.

Everyone watched as a ray of light shot down towards the city.

The woman spoke in a low voice, “He’s here!”

As soon as she finished speaking, a man in a white robe appeared in the arena.

The man was around the age of 27. He wore a pure white robe, and he was very handsome. As soon as he appeared there, countless women exclaimed, “Luo Wuxue!”

Luo Wuxue!

The number one genius on the Talent Rankings, and the representative of the sky race’s younger generation.

Luo Wuxue gazed at Gu Cangyan, “Clown from the devil race, how dare you cause trouble in my Sky Dimension?! You really don’t know your place!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly raised his right hand, and then faint light flickered there in his grasp. A moment later, he slapped his palm down at Gu Cangyan.

Bang!

The space around Gu Cangyan shook violently, and then the space there cracked open while Gu Cangyan’s face warped. It seemed like he was enduring extraordinary pain!

A moment of silence ensued, and then Gu Cangyan suddenly attacked. A ray of light flashed.

Hiss!

The sound of something being sliced open resounded, and then a huge spatial rift appeared in the space before Gu Cangyan. At the end of the rift, the ray of light had arrived before Luo Wuxue’s forehead!

A cold smile curled up on the corners of his mouth, and then a ray of silver light flashed on his palm.

Bang!

Gu Cangyan’s blade energy vanished.

Both of them were around 30m away from each other. A silver spear had appeared in Luo Wuxue’s grasp, and there was a small platinum dragon around the spear.

A moment later, he vanished on the spot.

Swish!

Everyone watched with astonishment as the space before Luo Wuxue suddenly cracked open, and a huge spatial rift appeared in the arena. At the same time, the arena shattered into bits!

It was too strong to the point the arena and the space there couldn’t endure the attack!

At the instant Luo Wuxue attacked, Gu Cangyan had vanished on the spot, and an extremely dazzling ray of light flashed.

A moment later, the ray of blade energy and silver light slammed against each other.

Boom!

In an instant, a wave of energy swept out from the point of collision. It moved extremely swiftly and instantly arrived before the crowd. The scene of this horrified the spectators, and they hurriedly moved backwards.

They retreated over 3km back before they finally stopped. Meanwhile, everyone noticed that someone hadn’t moved backwards, and it was Yang Ye. Yang Ye was still standing where he’d been standing a while ago.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and he noticed that they were all looking at him. Yang Ye spoke with bewilderment, “What are all of you doing?” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

All of them just gazed at him without saying a word.

Bang!

Meanwhile, an explosion resounded far away in the sky. They looked up and saw a platinum dragon soaring through the sky. At the same time, a 300m long ray of blade energy shot through the sky like a shooting star.

At this moment, their battle had reached its peak, and the outcome was about to be decided. Or perhaps, it should be said that life and death would be decided very soon. Because both of them hadn’t held back, and they were risking their lives in battle.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Explosions resounded incessantly in the sky, and the space there started turning ethereal. However, it didn’t take long for the experts watching from the shadows to fortify the space there, and it was fortified to an absolutely strong point. Luo Wuxue and Gu Cangyan’s attacks weren’t able to shake the space in that area of the sky anymore!

Suddenly, Luo Wuxue soared up into the sky, and then a silver circle of light appeared on his palm. Gu Cangyan’s expression changed at the sight of it because his instinct told him that it was dangerous!

“Go!” Luo Wuxue flicked his finger, and it transformed into a ray of silver light that shot towards Gu Cangyan!

Gu Cangyan’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he was holding his blade with two hands. When the circle of silver light arrived around 30m away from him, he swiftly swung his blade forward!

It descended at the perfect timing to hit the silver circle of light.

Time seemed like it had stopped.

This continued for around three breaths of time. Suddenly, the circle of silver light shook violently, and then numerous ethereal circles of silver light shot out from it.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

These ethereal circles of silver light slammed against Gu Cangyan’s body and instantly blasted him away. He flew for almost 3km before he finally stopped, and his body immediately cracked open once he stopped himself. Blood sprayed from him. It was an extremely shocking sight!

Luo Wuxue had won!

Countless people in the surroundings cheered and howled!

Gu Cangyan wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and then he looked up at Luo Wuxue, “A Sage Rank weapon!”

Luo Wuxue put the silver circle of light away and smiled, “You have quite the discerning gaze!”

As he spoke, he glanced at the surroundings and asked, “Everyone, tell me! Do you think he should be killed?”

“Kill him!” Countless howled in unison, “Of course he should be killed!”

“He must be killed! Those who offend our sky race must be killed!”

“Kill him! No, he should be tortured to death!”

Luo Wuxue gazed at Gu Cangyan and ridiculed, “What’s it like to overestimate your strength? This is it!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he tossed his spear at Gu Cangyan.

Gu Cangyan was about to counterattack, but a figure suddenly appeared in front of him, and then the spear was caught by a hand.

It was Yang Ye!

The woman outside the arena frowned at the sight of this. Gu Cangyan was stunned too. Obviously, he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to lend him a hand.

Luo Wuxue frowned when he saw Yang Ye, “A human?”

Yang Ye glanced at the people outside the arena, “Since he started challenging the geniuses of the sky race, I don’t think he ever killed any of the opponents he defeated!”

“He’s a human!” Someone exclaimed.

“A human? A lowly race? What’s he doing in our Sky Dimension?”

“I didn’t expect a human to be here. The guards outside the Sky Gate are getting terrible! They actually allowed a lowly human in!”

The woman down below glanced at Yang Ye, “You’re getting yourself killed!”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then a smile curled up on the corners of his mouth. After that, he vanished on the soft. An instant later, he appeared in front of Luo Wuxue, and then he swung Luo Wuxue’s spear.

Everyone watched with astonishment as Luo Wuxue was swept over 10km away!

Yang Ye patted his hands and glanced at the surroundings, “From this moment onward, I, Yang Ye, challenge all the geniuses of the sky race’s younger generation. Right here and right now. No matter how many of you choose to fight me, I’ll fight you all!”

He paused for a moment, and then a slightly cold smile curled up on the corners of his mouth. He pointed at Luo Wuxue and added, “Let me tell you a little secret. Don’t send such trash to fight me because I can fight 100 people like him!”
