Chapter 2537 – So, Please Fuck Off!

Yang Ye and Gu Nan were stunned by this.

The souls within the Sword Cave represented the seniors of the Ancient Sword Sect. They had been resting peacefully here, and they’d only left behind a strand of their soul or other similar things to preserve their inheritance for the future generation.

They were unlike Yang Ye, and they felt a strong sense of belonging to the Ancient Sword Sect.

Just like Sword Scroll. Many of them had grown up in the sect, and they treated it like their home.

At this moment, all these sword cultivators were looking at Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, a middle aged man floated over to Yang Ye, “You are really not bad!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when the souls in the surroundings transformed into rays of sword intent that swept at Yang Ye.

Every single soul transformed into sword intent that was at least at the Lord Realm!

And there were around 50 souls here!

All of the sword intent surged madly into Yang Ye!

Gu Nan was stunned by this.

These seniors of the Ancient Sword Sect were helping Yang Ye by sacrificing themselves. They were giving the sword intent they’d cultivated over a lifetime to Yang Ye.

In that way, Yang Ye wouldn’t just be able to greatly improve his sword intent, he could experience numerous different types of sword intents and wills.

It was absolutely beneficial to Yang Ye!

Gu Nan fell silent.

Obviously, these seniors agreed with Yang Ye and supported him!

Around 15 minutes passed before only a single soul remained. It was a middle aged man in an elegant robe.

He hadn’t vanished!

After Yang Ye finished absorbing the sword intent, the middle aged man spoke abruptly, “The Ancient Sword Sect has existed for at least 100,000 years.”

Yang Ye gazed at the man and waited for him to continue.

The middle aged man continued, “Since the sect was founded, it has overcome countless dangers. Many of these dangers even brought the sect to the verge of destruction. But we held on and overcame it. The Ancient Sword Sect can be destroyed. No organization has ever existed for eternity. If a day comes when my Ancient Sword Sect does get destroyed, it wouldn’t be anything surprising. However, we do not want the destruction of our sect to be one that came from submission and humiliation. The sect can be lost, but we hope it is lost with dignity and backbone.”

He floated over to Yang Ye and said, “We do not know why someone as young as you has become the sect master, but we think what you said is correct. The elders and sword cultivators of the sect do not support you, but we, the past members of the Ancient Sword Sect, support you.”T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

As soon as he finished speaking, his soul dispersed into the surroundings, and then a strand of sword energy surged into Yang Ye.

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly!

Strands of sword intent were ceaselessly rippling out of him. It was an extremely messy mass of various types of sword intents.

Gu Nan frowned because that wasn’t a good thing at all!

Suddenly, the sword intent Yang Ye emanated started to transform!

It wasn’t that messy anymore!

Some time passed, and then a strand of sword intent that contained bloody slaughter intent appeared here!

It was Yang Ye’s original Slaughter Sword Intent!

This sword intent was at the Lord Realm!

Moreover, its purity far surpassed Gu Nan’s expectations. It was extremely condensed and didn’t seem like it had been forcefully risen to this level!

Actually, it was because of Yang Ye and those seniors of the Ancient Sword Sect.

Firstly, Yang Ye’s own sword intent had been very well tempered and condensed. After all, he’d been suppressing his own sword intent. As for those seniors of the Ancient Sword Sect, no one in this Sword Cave was a weakling, so their sword intent was naturally very well tempered and condensed too. So, when their sword intent was absorbed by Yang Ye’s sword intent, it could be considered as a union of the strong. Besides that, Yang Ye’s Sword Dao and Sword Heart were extremely solid too, so it was impossible for their will in the Sword Dao to affect him. Thus, once he absorbed their sword intent, his sword intent remained pure as it grew stronger!

Lord Realm sword intent!

Moreover, it wasn’t his limit. Actually, it could rise even higher, but Yang Ye had forcefully suppressed it!

He was only at the Three World Realm right now, yet his sword intent was at the Lord Realm. It was already a huge gap. If it grew further, the gap between his sword intent and cultivation would be too huge, and that would definitely cause problems for him.

It was best to take one step at a time!

Around an hour later, Yang Ye took a deep breath and left the Sword Cave. Meanwhile, there was a new person following him, and it was Gu Nan!

Outside the Sword Cave, Yang Ye glanced at where Gu Han had been, and it was empty!

Yang Ye did say anything and just vanished into the distance.

…

The Ancient Sword Sect. Meeting Hall.

Yang Ye was seated at the seat of the host, and below him was Gu Nan, the Grand Elder, Elder Xue, and three other elders. They were Elder Mo Yan who was in charge of the Judgment Hall, Elder Qian Xuan who was in charge of the sect’s secret forces, and Elder Li Xiang who was in charge of the sect’s information infrastructure.

Coupled with Gu Nan who was guarding the Sword Cave and the two other elders, practically all the higher-ups of the sect were here.

There were 7 Lord Realm experts here!

7!

The sect did have some other forces in the shadows, but Yang Ye didn’t know much about them. It could be said that while the Ancient Sword Sect didn’t have a top-rate expert like its previous sect master, it still had its foundation!

The hall was very silent, and the atmosphere here was quite strange!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “I summoned all of you here to deal with some things.”

They still remained silent.

Yang Ye smiled, “I know that all of you made me the sect master just to let things follow its course. Or I should say that you hoped for me to just be the sect master while it goes through this difficult period. Right?”

The elders glanced at him and remained silent.

Yang Ye said, “I don’t care what all of you think. Since I chose to be the sect master, I intend to do well. Now, the Ancient Sword Sect is being targeted by the various powers, and some others are scheming from within it. It can be said that the sect is at its most dangerous moment. In order to deal with external threats, internal threats should be resolved first. So, I called all of you here to resolve such internal threats.”

All of them remained silent.

Yang Ye smiled, and then he gazed at the Grand Elder and Elder Xue, “Grand Elder, Elder Xue… Wait, I should call you the Soul Guardians!”

The Grand Elder and Elder Xue fell silent for a short while. In the end, Elder Xue spoke indifferently, “So you know everything!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I know everything I should know.”

Elder Xue glanced at the surroundings and said, “The sect master passed away and the Soul Sect attacked. Our Ancient Sword Sect has no way to resist them.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Is that the reason you surrendered?”

Elder Xue glanced at Yang Ye, “The Soul Sect promised that everyone from the Ancient Sword Sect can remain in Eternal Kingdom, and the Ancient Sword Sect will remain the Ancient Sword Sect.”

Yang Ye grinned, “But the Ancient Sword Sect must become their subordinate sect, right?”

Elder Xue looked him in the eyes, “Then what do you think we should do? Fight the Soul Sect to the death? The strongest expert in our sect is just a Grade 3 Lord Realm expert, and the Soul Sect has experts beyond the Lord Realm. How are we supposed to fight them? With the lives of countless disciples from our sect?”

Yang Ye replied, “What about the clans that are subordinate to the Ancient Sword Sect?”

Elder Xue said, “They aren’t attacking the disciples of the sect, right?”

Yang Ye smiled, “So, you mean we should sacrifice those clans that are subordinate to us in order to guarantee the safety of the sect?”

Elder Xue closed her eyes slowly, “It’s the best outcome!”

Yang Ye glanced at the other elders, “What do all of you think?”

They fell silent.

Yang Ye smiled, “Since we’re on this topic, I’ll be frank. If you plan to stay in the sect, then stand over on my side.”

They fell silent. In the end, only Gu Nan and one other black robed elder went over to Yang Ye’s side.

Only the two of them!

As for those with actual authority in the sect, none of them chose to take his side!

Elder Xue looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “I’ll give you one last chance to leave the sect.”

Yang Ye grinned, “Elder Gu Nan, gather all the disciples here! I have something to announce!”

Gu Nan nodded slightly and walked away, but a few auras suppressed him before he could even reach the exit.

Yang Ye walked over to Elder Xue and the Grand Elder. He looked them in the eye and said, “I’ll only say this once. I don’t want to take action right now, so don’t force my hand. Otherwise, I wouldn’t mind taking your heads and turning them into decorations for the sect’s entrance.”

Elder Xue looked him in the eye and didn’t say a word.

Yang Ye glanced coldly at them, “The Ancient Sword Sect belongs to everyone in the sect. If all the disciples of the sect choose to surrender to the Soul Sect and follow all of you, then I’ll leave immediately and never interfere in the Ancient Sword Sect’s business again. Now, I’m giving them the right to choose. It’s best if you don’t stop me from doing this. Otherwise, I can guarantee that you’ll lose your heads before the Soul Sect comes to the Ancient Sword Sect!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a sword floated by his side.

It was Executor!

Extremely solemn expressions appeared on all their faces when they saw it!

It was the number one sword of Eternal Kingdom!

And it was once the number one sword of the Ancient Sword Sect!

Even now, the Ancient Sword Sect still had a statue of this sword outside!

Gu Nan left the hall. Yang Ye remained seated at the seat of the sect master, and no one in the hall dared to attack him.

They were naturally aware of how Yang Ye had almost killed a Lord Realm expert from the Soul Sect at Hill City. They had started to fear this young sect master whom they’d pushed up into this position!

It didn’t take long for the outer court disciples, inner court disciples, and elite disciples to arrive in the hall. The hall wasn’t large enough, so they had to stand outside as well.

Everyone in the sect was here!

Yang Ye gazed at these disciples and said, “I presume Elder Gu Nan has briefed all of you about the situation. Now, you have the right to choose your own future! If you choose me, it represents you’ll have to fight, and you may die in battle; if you choose Elder Xue’s side, I will leave and never interfere in the Ancient Sword Sect’s business.”

A moment of silence ensued, and then the nine elite disciples who led the group suddenly knelt down, “We swear our loyalty to you, Sect Master!”

A moment later, the other disciples behind them knelt down as well, “We swear our loyalty to you, Sect Master!”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, “Grand Elder, Elder Xue, and all of you elders of the Soul Sect. You’re not welcome here. So, please fuck off!”
