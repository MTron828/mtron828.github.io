Chapter 2554

In the distant sky, the Soul Sect’s expert who had an advantage in the battle suddenly stopped. It was because two waves of powerful energy were rippling toward him from the right!

The Soul Sect’s expert didn’t dare to act carelessly before him. He raised his hands, and then countless souls rippled out from him in an instant.

Bang! Bang!

Two rumbling explosions resounded through the sky!

The souls exploded apart while the black robed man was pushed over 1km back!

Once he stopped himself, he swiftly turned around and noticed that Yang Ye was gone.

He closely clenched his fists from the sight of this, and then he gazed at the old men on the city walls!

The old men displayed no fear and met his gaze!

It was their territory!

While the Soul Sect’s expert had suddenly vanished on the spot, a beam of black light slammed down upon War City!

The two old men remained indifferent on the city walls!

The violet robed old man suddenly stretched out his right hand and flipped it.

It seemed like he was flipping the world.

Bang!

The black beam of light was blasted apart. But at this moment, the Soul Sect’s expert was in the sky above the city walls, and then a huge palm slammed down toward the city!

If it struck the city, the entire city would probably explode apart!

The violet robed old man remained indifferent as he waved his right hand, and a spear suddenly appeared in his grasp. A moment later, it shot up into the sky and struck the huge palm.

Boom!

The entire palm exploded apart and was obliterated, but the wave of energy from the explosion rippled down. If it entered the city, the city would still be unable to escape destruction!

Meanwhile, the white robed old man suddenly attacked.

He just raised his hand and slapped his palm forward!

Bang!

A strand of invisible force rippled out, and the wave of energy was instantly obliterated.

The entire sky above the city returned to normal!

The Soul Sect’s expert intended to attack again, but a black robed middle aged man appeared in the sky above the city.

It was the Soul Sect’s Exalt!

The black robed man stopped when he saw the Soul Exalt and moved aside!

The Soul Exalt gazed at the two old men on the city walls, “What? Does War City intend to openly take the Ancient Sword Sect’s side?”

The two old men gazed at him with indifference.

The Soul Exalt glanced coldly at them, “Or perhaps you would like to have a spar with my Soul Sect? If that’s the case, how about I play with both of you?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly raised his right hand and pressed it down slowly in the city’s direction!

The entire city shook before it like an earthquake was running through it! Actually, it was a wave of powerful energy that was destroying the city. If it wasn’t for the powerful defenses of the city itself, just this palm alone would have obliterated the city!

The Soul Exalt had clearly not held back. Waves of powerful energy were ceaselessly rippling down from above. The defensive formations of the city were active, but even they could barely stop the Soul Exalt’s strength!

The two old men had extremely solemn expressions on their faces. They would naturally not just watch as the city was destroyed. Even if the Soul Exalt was a grade 3 Lord Realm expert!

They charged up into the air!

The Soul Exalt laughed coldly and pressed his palms down once more!

Bang! Bang!

The old men were suppressed back to the city walls.

Even though they were only a grade apart, that difference in a single grade was like the gap between the heavens and the earth!

As soon as they pressed back down to the city walls, that section of the walls collapsed into bits!

At the same time, their bodies started to crack open and bleed!

Suddenly, a woman in a green dress appeared in the sky above the city. She glanced coldly at the Soul Exalt and waved her right hand.

Bang!

The Soul Exalt’s energy vanished without a trace and the city returned to calm!

The Soul Exalt gazed at her and laughed coldly, “I didn’t expect Lady Liu Yuan to come in person!”

She glanced coldly at him, and then she suddenly raised her hands slowly. An instant later, a furious howl resounded through the surroundings.

Bang!

A ray of dazzling white light rippled out through the sky!

The white light enveloped the Soul Exalt and the other expert of the Soul Sect, and then rumbling resounded once more in the sky above the city.

Meanwhile, the woman suddenly vanished.

Swish!

A rift was sliced open in the sky above the city, and then a figure was blasted out of the city.

It was the Soul Exalt!

The woman gazed coldly at the Soul Exalt, and then she raised her palm once more and pushed it forward.

Bang!

No one saw what happened clearly, but the Soul Exalt was blasted over 3km away again!

They were both grade 3 Lord Realm experts, but there was a difference even in the same realm of cultivation!

The Soul Exalt glanced at his chest while he stood outside the city, and there was a clear palm print there!

The Soul Exalt wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and gazed at the woman, “As expected of the one who was once known as being the strongest in the War Dimension!”

The strongest!

The woman just stood there in the sky and glanced coldly at the Soul Exalt, “This isn’t a place that the Soul Sect can do as it pleases.”

She raised a finger as she spoke, “If this happens again, even your Sect Master won’t be able to stop me from killing you. Now, fuck off.”

The Soul Exalt’s face was extremely unsightly, “What? The War Dimension refuses to play by the rules?”

Liu Yuan took a step forward, and she instantly arrived before him, “The rules? That’s up to me to decide! Do you have a problem with that?”

Overbearing!

The Soul Exalt’s face was extremely unsightly!

Liu Yuan ignored him and just walked off through the sky toward the city, “The Soul Sect is trying to devour the Ancient Sword Sect, and that’s part of the affairs of the outside world. It has nothing to do with this place. But in my personal opinion, those clans and powers are fucking terrible! If that Sword Master hadn’t led over 100 sword cultivators to obstruct the Desolate Deathguard, nobody knows how many of the current clans and powers would still exist! And if he hadn’t joined that fight, then based on his talent, living another 10,000 years wouldn’t be a problem at all.”

She suddenly stopped walking and glanced at the Soul Exalt, “But besides taking advantage of the situation for your own gain, what did you Soul Sect do all those years ago? You did nothing! So, from this moment onward, if anyone from the Soul Sect dares to step foot into War City, I’ll kill them all!”

She vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

The two old men turned around and left as well.

The Soul Exalt’s face was extremely gloomy.

A long time passed before he left with the other black robed man.

At a mountain range, the Soul Exalt closed his eyes slowly, and the black robed man stood not too far away from him!

The black robed man remained silent.

A long time later, the Soul Exalt opened his eyes, “I’ve found him!”

The black robed man spoke solemnly, “While he’s young, his combat strength is formidable. It’s difficult for me to kill him, even if I use my full strength. So, why don’t you kill him yourself, Soul Exalt?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The Soul Exalt glanced at the sky, “We underestimated him. He has the backing of some mysterious experts. They showed themselves when I attacked the Ancient Sword Sect that day.”

Mysterious experts!

The black robed man spoke solemnly, “That person who obstructed Zuo Leng at the underground trade area?”

The Soul Exalt nodded slightly, “That was just one of them.”

The Soul Exalt glanced at the surroundings and laughed coldly, “There’s one of them nearby right now. Go kill him. I’ve determined that he’s heavily injured and can’t run for long!”

The black robed man nodded slightly and left.

Once the black robed man left, the Soul Exalt spoke indifferently, “Show yourself.”

Nothing happened!

The Soul Exalt laughed coldly, “I’m truly curious. I’m curious about why you’re just stopping me but not fighting me?”

A moment of silence ensued, and then a voice resounded, “I’m helping him raise a pig until he can slaughter it himself!”

The Soul Exalt’s eyes narrowed slightly while killing intent surged within them!

…

Once Yang Ye left the city, he shot forward madly on his sword. His skin was cracked and blood was seeping out through the cracks.

He’d been severely injured during the battle just now. There was still a huge gap between him and the black robed man, and even if he used all his trump cards, he was only barely capable of fighting the black robed man!

It was very difficult for him to win the battle!

Now, he needed a place to heal!

However, he hadn’t even been able to stop for 10 minutes before he sensed an aura approaching rapidly!

“They just refuse to give up!” Yang Ye shook his head and hurriedly left the Primordial Pagoda, and then he vanished into the sky!

Yang Ye noticed that the expert from the Soul Sect refused to stop pursuing him!

He knew that he couldn’t allow this to go on!

Yang Ye shot through the clouds on his sword while a frown remained on his face. Even if he intended to fight the black robed man, he had to heal first before continuing the battle!

It wouldn’t take long, just around two hours or so!

But the expert behind him was rapidly closing the distance between them!

Yang Ye suddenly seemed to have thought of something, and then he seemed visibly conflicted. But as the expert behind him grew closer and closer, that internal conflict vanished!

Yang Ye sped up, and it didn’t take long for him to arrive before an abyss!

That abyss!

As he gazed at the abyss, Yang Ye took a deep breath and said, “Bless me, Snowy!”

As he spoke, he leaped down into it.
