Chapter 1837 – The Night Emperor!

A memory seed?

There’s a memory seed in me?!

Yang Ye refused to believe it. Because he didn’t lack any memories. He had complete memories from the day he was born.

Meanwhile, Shao Siyou said, “There was one in you. However, it has been destroyed!”

“Destroyed?” Yang Ye frowned, “What do you mean?”

She replied, “I told you that three people changed your destiny. The first was the person who placed the memory seed within you. That person intended to accomplish something through you. The second was the person who destroyed the memory seed for you. That person allowed your destiny to go back to its original path. As for the third…. I can’t see through it.”

Yang Ye slowly clenched his fists.

He didn’t think she was lying to him because she didn’t have a reason to do so. In other words, there really had been three people who’d changed his destiny. So, who were they?

Meanwhile, Shao Siyou suddenly gazed at Blood Maiden and the others, “I’ll give all of you a cultivation technique. Once you circulate it, the memory seed deep within your minds will vanish on its own.”

She flicked over rays of white light that entered their foreheads.

After that, her figure gradually became ethereal.

Blood Maiden and the others were shocked by this sight!

Shao Siyou said, “My projection has finished its mission, so it’s time for it to go.” She gazed at the treant and continued, “I came here all those years ago because I was injured, and I needed its help to recover. It helped me in the past, so don’t make things difficult for it.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she waved her right hand, and the golden ring of light around the treant immediately vanished.

After that, she gazed at Nether Dream, “Little Dream, you’re free now. You can do anything you want.” She glanced at Blood Maiden and the others before she continued, “It’s the same for all of you!”

Her figure grew more and more ethereal while she spoke.

Suddenly, Yang Ye asked, “Senior, you said you were injured? Who injured you?”

She glanced at Yang Ye, “Someone who uses the sword, just like you!”

As soon as she finished speaking, her figure vanished in midair.

Someone who uses the sword!

Yang Ye frowned. Who could it be?

The surroundings fell silent once more.

Lost!

At this moment, Blood Maiden and the others felt lost. Previously, they yearned to see Shao Siyou. But now that they’d gotten their wishes, what happened was completely different to what they’d expected!

What should we do from now on?

A long time passed before the veiled woman spoke abruptly, “I don’t care what all of you think, but I won’t leave the Nether Pavilion. I’ll reorganize it and make it the strongest power in the medium universe!”

Her figure vanished into the sky once she finished speaking.

Meanwhile, the Martial Envoy suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, “Brother Yang, you’re going to the large universe?”

Yang Ye nodded. He was definitely going there.

She grinned, “We can go together!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course!”

The Martial Envoy said, “The seal above Heaven Pillar Mountain will still take some time to weaken. I’m returning to Sword Immortal City to manage some things. So, farewell for now.”

As she spoke, she turned around with the intent to leave. However, she seemed to have thought of something and stopped, “Brother Yang, you have that sword from the large universe, so your troubles will be endless. According to the information I received, numerous powerful organizations in Heaven Pillar Mountain have started to search for you. Good luck!”

She vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

Once she left, Yang Ye gazed at Nether Dream, “What about you? Have you figured out what you plan to do?”

Nether Dream glanced at him, “No!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Er… Do you want to have a look at the large universe?”

Nether Dream asked, “Why should we go there?”

Yang Ye replied, “Because the large universe has a better system of cultivation, more experts, and… Right, it’s more fun.”

Nether Dream asked, “More fun?”

Yang Ye hurriedly nodded, “It’s very fun. The large universe is much larger than our universe, so it’s definitely more fun! Want to go up there with us? At least you’ll have company!”

Nether Dream glanced at Yang Ye before looking at Blood Maiden, “Is that true?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Blood Maiden thought for a moment and replied, “It should be very fun.” She naturally understood what Yang Ye was trying to do. Yang Ye just wanted to bring Nether Dream over to his side. She was an extraordinary expert after all!

After she heard Blood Maiden, Nether Dream thought for a moment before she looked at Yang Ye, “How do we get up there?”

Yang Ye pointed at the sky, “See that? There’s a mountain called Heaven Pillar Mountain there, and we have to go up from there!”

Nether Dream glanced in the direction of Heaven Pillar Mountain, and it didn’t take long for an extremely solemn expression to appear on her face, “We can’t go there!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She replied, “There are dangerous things there, very dangerous things! And there are more than one of them!”

Yang Ye’s face became solemn.

Dangerous things!

Nether Dream’s strength could be described as the strongest amongst the experts from the Nether Pavilion. Even though she wasn’t at the Enlightened Realm, she could fight Enlightened Realm experts. It could be said that very few people down here could pose a threat to her.

However, she said that something very dangerous was over there!

Yang Ye felt he was on the verge of being invincible before he came to Heaven Pillar Mountain. But once he arrived at this damnable place, he realized that the people here were absolutely strong and terrifying. His strength wasn’t enough at all!

Meanwhile, Nether Dream added, “Don’t go up there! You’ll die!”

Yang Ye replied, “It’s fine. Many people will be going too. If it’s really dangerous, we just have to run. So, what do you think?”

Nether Dream thought for a moment and asked, “She has gone up there, right?”

Yang Ye naturally knew who Nether Dream was talking about, so he nodded.

Nether Dream nodded slightly, “I’m going to deal with something. I’ll come find you when the time comes.”

She vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth. Nether Dream’s strength was extremely terrifying. So, it was a very good thing to get her on their side.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

Suddenly, the treant started to tremble.

Yang Ye and the others’ expressions changed at the sight of it. However, it only took a moment for their expressions to ease up because the treant was sinking slowly into the ground.

It was leaving!

Yang Ye fell silent. If he were being honest, he wanted to drag it into the Primordial Pagoda. However, it was clearly very vigilant towards him, or it should be described as hostility. Under such circumstances, he would have caused trouble for himself by acting against it.

After all, the three of them here weren’t capable of dealing with an Enlightened Realm expert like the treant!

Snowy!

Yang Ye thought of Snowy. But as soon as he thought of her, his hairs stood on end.

Because he still couldn’t sense the Primordial Pagoda, and both Qiong Qi and Hou Qing were still silent!

Danger was still present here!

Another powerful expert was nearby!

Yang Ye hurriedly looked at Blood Maiden, “Second Sister! Third Sister! Be careful!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a voice resounded, “You were actually able to notice my presence. Interesting.”

A middle aged man suddenly appeared not too far away from them.

The middle aged man looked around the age of 40. He wore a cloud white robe, had long hair that hung down to his shoulders, and a handsome appearance. Besides that, he had an unique bearing.

Yang Ye and the others’ expressions became extremely solemn when they saw him.

His strength was unfathomable!

The middle aged man felt unfathomable to them!

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye, “An outstanding genius indeed. No wonder those subordinates of mine died at your hands!”

Subordinates! Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “You’re from the Night Assassins!”

The middle aged man nodded slightly, “I’m the Night Assassins’ leader. They call me the Night Emperor!”

Yang Ye gazed at the wooden sword in his grasp, “What? You want this sword too?”

The middle aged man shook his head slightly, “I’m mainly here to kill. The sword is a secondary objective. Night Assassins isn’t even in the top five of the powers throughout Heaven Pillar Mountain, but those powers in the top five would give me some face.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “But my Night Assassins became the laughingstock of Heaven Pillar Mountain because of you. A humiliation must be washed away with blood. You and these women must die!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he tapped his finger in their direction.

Bang!

The space around them shook violently.

Boom!

An instant later, the space around them collapsed, and the force of the explosion pushed all three of them backwards. Meanwhile, a wave of powerful energy enveloped them.

After that, Yang Ye’s eyes opened wide. Because he felt that his body was actually on the verge of cracking apart.

Boom! Boom!

Suddenly, two types of intents surged out from Yang Ye, and then Yang Ye felt the weight on his body lighten. However, the Night Emperor suddenly tapped his finger forward again, “In the name of the earth, Bind!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the ground beneath Yang Ye quaked, and then a wave of mysterious light yellow energy surged up into the air and bound them.

At this moment, all three of them couldn’t move!

Crack!

Meanwhile, a clear and resounding crack arose.

It was the sound of a body cracking open!

Yang Ye’s body had cracked open, and blood sprayed from it.

The Night Emperor spoke indifferently, “Do you know how weak you are now?”

Suddenly, Yang Ye roared with fury, and then a wave of mysterious energy appeared in the surroundings.

The Sword Domain!

At this moment, Yang Ye had once again activated the Sword Domain that he hadn’t used for so long.
