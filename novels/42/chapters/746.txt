Chapter 747 – A Young Girl Without Hands!

Translator: InVader

Editor: Conspiracing

Chen Badao had just finished speaking when his eyes instantly opened wide, and they almost popped out from their sockets. Because a hand was on his neck.

The others here watched this scene with disbelief.

Yang Ye choked Chen Badao while a smile arose on the corners of his mouth, “How are you going to bully me when you’re so weak?”

Besides ferocity, there was also terror in Chen Badao’s eyes. He was at the fifth rank of the Monarch Realm, but he hadn’t even been able to see Yang Ye’s actions clearly!

My god! Is he a Half-Saint?

“You dare to kill a member of my Endless Alliance? You’re dead!” Zhang Liao roared furiously.

Crack!

The clear and melodious sound of bones cracking resounded, and then Chen Badao’s head tilted to the side as he’d lost his life.

Yang Ye withdrew his hand and glanced indifferently at Zhang Liao, “I don’t know if I’ll die, but I know that you didn’t cherish the chance to live. Then I’ll give you death!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s figure moved and instantly arrived in front of Zhang Liao, and then he smashed his right fist towards Zhang Liao. The latter’s expression changed drastically, and he pressed his palms forward to collide with Yang Ye’s attack.

Bang!

Zhang Liao was blasted flying, and he crashed through 5 houses before his figure finally stopped.

He was dead!

Instantly killed by a single punch!

The other members of the Endless Alliance were horrified, and they didn’t hesitate at all to turn around and flee. What a joke! YY was killing Monarch Realm experts like he was slaughtering sheep! How could they dare to attack him?

Yang Ye clapped his hands together, and then he turned around and returned to where he stood before. After that, he withdrew the damaged sword chest. The sword chest was pitch black, and it was densely covered by strange symbols. Besides that, there was a small corner missing from the top of it, causing it to seem quite ugly.

The effects of swords chests were usually to form sword formations or enhance the might of the swords within it. The reason Yang Ye took a liking to this sword chest was mainly because of a feeling, and once he looked at it carefully, he noticed that it really was quite extraordinary. Not to mention anything else, just the hardness of the materials used to forge it was much better than ordinary Dao Rank treasures.

Besides that, there were talismans inscribed on it. Even though he’d practiced the Dao of Talismans in the past, he could only be considered to be slightly knowledgeable in the field. So, he wasn’t able to figure out the effects of the talismans on the sword chest. However, his intuition told him that it wasn’t ordinary. Coupled with the fact that 2,000 extreme-grade energy stones weren’t a huge amount for him, he intended to buy it.

But he hadn’t expected that he would obtain it for free in the end.

“Big Brother, give me a little money, alright?” Right when Yang Ye was carefully observing the sword chest, a clear, melodious, and slightly weak voice appeared from behind him. This caused Yang Ye’s pupils to constrict slightly while a chill ran down his spin.

Danger! Extreme danger!

It wasn’t Yang Ye’s intuition but a warning from the Primordial Pagoda!

It was the first time that the Primordial Pagoda had warned him that he was in danger!

The profound energy within him surged madly while dragon scales appeared beneath his clothes.

Yang Ye turned around slowly, and he saw a young girl looking at him with a pitiable expression on his face. The young girl was around 10 years old. Her clothes were in rags, her hair completely dirty, and her face was even covered in a huge amount of mud. Most importantly, she had no hands. Both her sleeves were empty.

He wasn’t able to discern her cultivation. She was a completely ordinary little girl. However, Yang Ye was very clearly aware that it wasn’t that simple at all. Not to mention the warning he got from the Primordial Pagoda; he hadn’t even noticed when she arrived behind him. Moreover, his divine sense was still unable to sense her until now.

Yang Ye was shocked in his heart because even a Half-Saint couldn’t arrive behind him without him noticing, let alone make the Primordial Pagoda send him a warning.

“Big Brother, give me a little money, alright?” She gazed at Yang Ye while speaking in a weak and gentle voice, and she seemed so frail that she couldn’t even resist a gust of wind.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment before he withdrew an extreme-grade energy stone and placed it on the ground.

She glanced at the energy stone and said, “It’s too little. It won’t be able to satiate Yin’yin’s hunger.”

Yang Ye withdrew 10 more extreme-grade energy stones and placed them on the ground.

The little girl shook her head and said, “It isn’t enough!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. This time, he withdrew 100 energy stones.

She still shook her head again.

Yang Ye took a deep breath, withdrew 1,000 extreme-grade energy stones, and then spoke gently, “Little sister, it isn’t easy for me to earn money as well. Of course, it’s definitely more difficult for you. Since it’s difficult for both of us, then let’s not make it difficult for each other, alright?”

At this moment, Yang Ye’s heart was bleeding. It was the first time he’d been extorted in his entire life. He wanted to give her nothing, but he decided to give it to her in the end. It was none other than because the Primordial Pagoda had sent him a warning. That meant that the young girl who stood before him was definitely extremely terrifying. After all, the Primordial Pagoda hadn’t sent him a warning when he faced Lu Yan that day!

Moreover, the little girl had actually been able to live in Nameless City, so it was obvious that she wasn’t ordinary.

He was paying to avoid a calamity!

In Yang Ye’s opinion, if he could use money to deal with it, then it was best to not draw his sword. Of course, the precondition was that he couldn’t defeat the other person....

The little girl blinked and said, “Big Brother, give me 5,000, alright?”

Are you a glutton!?

Yang Ye’s face was dark, and he was almost about to shake his head. However, he didn’t in the end. Because the Primordial Pagoda gave him another warning. It wasn’t just the Primordial Pagoda, even the violet mink sent him a warning. Yang Ye knew that it was a severe situation.

He checked his possessions and noticed that he only had 10,000 extreme-grade energy stones left. This time, while it hurt, he didn’t hesitate to withdraw another 4,000 extreme-grade energy stones. He placed it on the ground before him and said, “Here, it’s all for you.”

A faint smile arose on the corners of her mouth when she saw the small hill of energy stones. Suddenly, her brows knit together slightly as she said, “Big Brother, there are too many. I can’t hold them all.”

“That’s not a problem!” He’d given her 5,000 extreme-grade energy stones, so what was a single spatial ring? Yang Ye withdrew a spatial ring, placed all the energy stones into it, and then said, “See, isn’t it alright now?”

She replied, “But Yin’yin doesn’t have any hands!”

“That’s... not a problem as well!” Yang Ye withdrew a red string and stringed the spatial ring before he said, “Wear it around your neck.”

She blinked and said, “Big Brother, I don’t have hands. Help me put it on, alright?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

The current state of his emotions was truly impossible to describe with words. Not only was he being extorted, he even had to serve his extortionist.... That was truly unprecedented for him!

Yang Ye was quite hesitant.

She was a dangerous person, and he had no doubt about it. So, he’d constantly kept his distance from her because he was worried that something would suddenly occur. Yet now, if he were to help her put it on, then it meant that he had to get close to her. At such a close distance....

The little girl blinked as she spoke, “Big Brother, come on!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly and shook his head. I’m really such a fool. Even an attack with the full strength of a Half-Saint wouldn’t be able to kill me with the defensive capabilities of my body while it’s covered in my dragon scales. Even if she does attack me, would she be able to kill me? Unless she’s a Saint Realm expert, of course.

But if she was a Saint Realm expert, then all he could do was accept his fate!

Yang Ye stopped hesitating. He walked over to her, and then he placed the strong around her neck.

“Big Brother, you’re a really good person!” said the young girl.

Yang Ye’s hand froze a little. I used 5,000 extreme-energy stones to be called a good person.... Yang Ye shook his head, and then he secured the string around her neck.

Meanwhile, she said, “You’re very generous as well. You didn’t just give Yin’yin money, you gave Yin’yin so much. Yin’yin can eat for quite a few days now. You aren’t like the others who don’t just refuse to give me money, they even intend to hit me. Even if they did give me money, they would be stingy, and Yin’yin would still feel hungry.”

Yang Ye felt quite amused when he heard her, and then he asked casually, “What do you do if they refuse and even hit you?”

“I eat them!” Yin’yin raised her head, gazed at Yang Ye, and spoke in a melodious voice.

Yang Ye’s face froze. A short while passed before he gulped down a mouthful of saliva and said, “You, really are them?”

Yin’yin nodded and said, “Yes. Unfortunately, they weren’t tasty.”

When she spoke up to this point, she suddenly moved closer to Yang Ye, and then she sniffed him lightly while a wisp of greed appeared in her eyes. She said, “Big Brother, I feel that your flesh will be much tastier than them. Right, but your skin is slightly thick, and it’s even thicker than those old geezers who call themselves Half-Saints. But it’s fine because my teeth are very strong. I’ll be able to bite through it!”

Yang Ye’d hairs stood on end while cold sweat appeared on his face. She ate them, and there were even Half-Saints.... Moreover, she sounds like she ate more than one!

Yang Ye knew that he’d encountered a true monster.

Yang Ye lowered his head to look at her, and then he forced a smile on his face as he said, “Err, you won’t eat me, right?”

She replied, “I wanted to!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

She continued, “However, Big Brother is unlike the others. You didn’t scold me or hit me, and you even gave me things. So, I won’t eat you. Big Brother, I’m leaving. See you!” She turned around and walked away while she spoke.

Meanwhile, a group led by a man in a gorgeous robe walked swiftly towards Yang Ye.

The strength of this group was very formidable, and their speed was extremely swift as well. Even though they were walking, they were even faster than a dashing horse. It didn’t take long for the group to be on the verge of colliding with the young girl.

Yang Ye’s expression changed, and he was just about to act. However, what he witnessed next caused him to be stunned and petrified on the spot.

The young girl was still walking, and the group didn’t stop as well. Just like that, they grew closer and closer, and it wasn’t long before they arrived right before the young girl.

But there was a problem!

The young girl was still walking forward!

Suddenly, she appeared behind the group, and then she continued walking slowly towards the distance while the group arrived in front of Yang Ye.

The man who led the group gazed at Yang Ye as he asked in a deep voice, “I’m the vice leader of the Endless Alliance, Ning Jun. You killed Chen Badao and Zhang Liao?”

Yang Ye pointed at the young girl in the distance, and then he gazed at Ning Jun and said, “You... you can’t see that young girl?”

“What young girl?” Ning Jun looked towards the direction Yang Ye pointed at, and there was no one there.

Ning Jun’s face fell. He turned around, gazed at Yang Ye, and said, “Are you trying to play tricks on me?”

“You’re a Half-Saint! Can you really not see her?” Yang Ye asked once more with a slightly trembling voice.

Ning Jun’s face became completely gloomy as he said, “Kid, there’s nothing besides air there. Have you gone mad?”

Yang Ye gazed at the young girl in the distance who was still walking, and he wiped the cold sweat on his face as he muttered, “Did I just see a ghost?”
