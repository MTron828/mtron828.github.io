Chapter 1042 – I’m Lou Qianxiao!

The students who knelt before Yang Ye didn’t speak a word, but they knew that Yang Ye understood what they were trying to convey!

They could go to the Ancient Sword School upon leaving Ocean of Clouds Academy, but that would be equivalent to relying on others to survive. Was anyone willing to do that? No one was!

They wanted to stay in the academy, but they knew that they could only do that if Yang Ye agreed. If Yang Ye didn’t, then no one would dare to let them stay, and they wouldn’t dare to stay as well.

After all, the cultivators of Ocean of Clouds City wished for nothing more than to eat them alive! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye fell silent. Yu Wushuang and the others were silent as well.

Meanwhile, Instructor Zhuo suddenly walked over to Yang Ye and said, “Yang Ye, the 4 of us can leave the academy, but I hope that you allow these little fellows to stay. They were only obeying our orders earlier, and you should understand that they aren’t strong enough to dare to disobey the orders of 4 Saints.”

Another Saint who stood by Instructor Zhuo’s side said, “Yang Ye, they’ve rendered meritorious service to both the academy and city. I hope that you’ll give them a chance out of consideration for that. Please!” The old man bowed slightly to Yang Ye once he finished speaking.

Shang Qingying who stood behind Yang Ye was unable to bear the sight of this, and she wanted to say something. However, Yu Wushuang had stopped her.

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then he turned around to gaze at the cultivators of the city, “All of them have fought by our side. They are the reason that the academy and city were able to survive the allied forces of Welkin Wolf Mountain Range. It was because all of them stayed to fight by our side! But all of you actually turned your blades against them!”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away when he spoke up to this point. The students who knelt before him instantly turned pale at the sight of this, and there was sorrow in their eyes.

Suddenly, Yang Ye stopped moving and said, “You can stay. You can stay if you can obtain the forgiveness of these cultivators from the city. Otherwise, leave immediately.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye vanished on the spot with Lu Wan’er.

“All of you can stand now!” As soon as Yang Ye left, Yu Wushuang walked over to the kneeling students and said, “All of you can stay!”

They were stunned, and Instructor Zhuo spoke with bewilderment, “Did Yang Ye even agree?”

“He didn’t tell all of you to leave immediately, and that’s equivalent to agreeing!” Yu Wushuang continued, “Leave the rest to me. However, I need all of you to give me your full cooperation. If you can’t do as I say, then leave the city right now.”

Instructor Zhuo hurriedly guaranteed, “I’ll make them do everything you ask!”

Yu Wushuang nodded lightly.

...

Cloud Ocean Pavilion.

Yang Ye held Lu Wan’er’s hand as they sat on a stone bench in the courtyard. He withdrew a Tree of Creation and passed it to her as he said, “Swallow it now. I’ll protect you while you cultivate!”

Lu Wan’er felt her heart tremble as she gazed at the fruit before her. She looked up at Yang Ye and said, “You weren’t in the city because you went to the Zither of Love, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Your Dantian was destroyed, and it grows worse for you as time passes. So, I took some time to make the trip. Fortunately, my luck wasn’t bad, and I got it!”

Lu Wan’er said, “It was very dangerous, right?”

Yang Ye grinned, “What danger? Isn’t it just a fruit? It’s an absolutely simple task for me!”

Lu Wan’er gazed at him for a long time, and then she suddenly cracked a smile. It was gorgeous like a garden of flowers blooming before him. But even though she was smiling, there were pearls of tears in her eyes.

She didn’t say anything. She just took the Fruit of Creation and started eating it, and it didn’t take long for her to consume it completely.

Nothing happened in the beginning, but it didn’t take long for Lu Wan’er’s body to start emanating a faint golden glow. At the same time, her aura grew stronger and stronger!

Lu Wan’er closed her eyes slowly, and then her stomach started to wriggle strangely.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief at the sight of this. Obviously, the Fruit of Creation was working.

Yang Ye remained silent for a short while before he waved his right hand, and then 10 shadowy figures appeared here.

After that, he sat down cross-legged and withdrew another Fruit of Creation. Yang Ye didn’t hesitate at all to consume it. He remembered what Asura Queen’s master, that mysterious woman, had said. The Fruit of Creation wasn’t just capable of rebuilding the Dantian, it could provide a great increase in one’s strength as well.

He needed to improve his strength right now!

As soon as it entered his body, Yang Ye felt heat rise up within him, and then countless strands of golden energy appeared incessantly within him. The golden energy swept swiftly to every corner of his body and completely filled it.

Bang!

A ray of golden light shot out from within him!

Just like Lu Wan’er, his aura was growing stronger and stronger.

In the beginning, his aura was growing increasingly stronger and violent, but it gradually calmed down and stabilized.

A day later, his aura had vanished completely. Conversely, Lu Wan’er’s aura was still growing stronger and showed signs of exploding out from within her.

Fortunately, the 10 shadowy figures who surrounded them had dispersed the aura she emanated or the entire area including Cloud Ocean Pavilion would be transformed into powder!

3 days later, Yang Ye opened his eyes slowly, and then he stood up and clenched his fists slowly.

Crack!

At the instant he did that, numerous fine cracks suddenly cracked open throughout the space around him.

Yang Ye took a deep breath and said, “I’m only a step away from the Saint Realm!”

Yang Ye hadn’t expected that swallowing a Fruit of Creation would actually allow him to advance to the high rank of the Half-Saint Realm! Moreover, his strength had naturally risen greatly along with the improvement in his cultivation. Not to mention anything else, just the volume of profound energy he could store within him was entirely sufficient for him to utilize a Divine Rank treasure at will for a certain period of time!

Besides his profound energy, his execution of techniques and speed had improved greatly as well. Most importantly, his Sword Domain had grown stronger as well.

He’d constantly had doubts about the Sword Domain. What did he have doubts about? It was naturally about whether it was useful! After all, while the Sword Domain had some effects, it was inferior when compared to how helpful his Void Rank sword intent, slaughter intent, and the Laws he possessed were. The Sword Domain could even be said to be quite useless.

However, when he saw that mysterious utilize a Domain, he knew that he was wrong. It wasn’t the Sword Domain that was weak, it was he who was weak!

How terrifying was Light Maiden’s strength? In any case, he wasn’t confident in his ability to defeat her even if he’d attained the high rank of the Half-Saint Realm now. Or it should be said that the possibility of him defeating her in battle was very small, absolutely small! However, such a terrifying expert wasn’t even able to fight back before that mysterious woman’s Domain!

She was truly unable to resist the Domain at all!

He didn’t know how that mysterious woman had accomplished that. All he knew was that she’d casually slapped Light Maiden flying!

It proved that it wasn’t the Sword Domain which was weak, it was he who was weak. Or perhaps, it was because he hadn’t truly mastered it. Of course, it wasn’t his fault. Because besides himself, he only knew 2 other people who’d possessed Domains, and it was the Unfettered One and that mysterious woman.

He had no one to learn from even if he wanted to. Because others didn’t know how to utilize a Domain at all. So, he had no other choice but to use the Sword Domain as he used sword intent. In other words, he used it to suppress his enemies!

“If I knew she possessed a Domain, I should have asked her about it while we were in that world. Now.... Alas....” Yang Ye shook his head while a feeling of helplessness arose within him, and he felt quite regretful in his heart. If he’d sought guidance from the woman during that period, then she would have probably provided him with guidance. Yet now, he didn’t want to court death.

Bang!

Meanwhile, a ray of golden light suddenly erupted from within Lu Wan’er, and then a terrifying aura surged out from within her. However, only a moment passed before the aura was blasted apart by those 10 shadowy figures around them.

The high rank of the Half-Saint Realm! Yang Ye was delighted because Lu Wan’er had actually advanced directly into the high rank of the Half-Saint Realm. In other words, her Dantian had probably been completely restored!

A short while passed before she opened her eyes slowly, and there was wild joy within them. She raised her head and gazed at Yang Ye, “I’ve recovered!”

“Congratulations!” Yang Ye smiled while he truly felt a sense of relief in his heart. If Lu Wan’er was unable to restore her Dantian forever, then he would definitely live in guilt and regret forever.

Lu Wan’er said, “My current Dantian feels even better than my previous Dantian. As for what’s better about it, I can’t really explain it!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Take your time and familiarize yourself with it!”

Lu Wan’er nodded lightly, and then she pondered deeply for an instant before she walked over to Yang Ye. She wrapped her arms lightly around Yang Ye’s waist, and then rested her head against his chest. She just laid there silently without saying a single word, nor did she utter a single word of thanks.

Because as far as she was concerned, there was no need for that between the two of them!

Yang Ye wrapped his arms around her waist as well, and they just embraced each other in silence.

“Yang Ye! Get out here!” Suddenly, a voice resounded in the sky above the city.

An instant later, it resounded once more, “Right! I seem to have forgotten to introduce myself. I’m Lou... Qian... Xiao!”

Lou Qianxiao! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly!
