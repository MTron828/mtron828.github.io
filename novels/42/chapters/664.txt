Chapter 665 – Threats?

The black clothed woman, the Assassin Sovereign, who usually stayed by An Biru’s side had perished.

She’d attempted to assassinate a Half-Saint during the battle yet was noticed, and then that Half-Saint obliterated her on the spot. She didn’t even leave a corpse behind.

Besides the black clothed woman, many other Monarch Realm experts had perished. There were some that Yang Ye knew and some that he didn’t. In short, the southern territory had won, but it was a pyrrhic victory.

Yang Ye had a bad impression of the black clothed woman. After all, she’d tried to kill him on more than one occasion. So, he’d said that the first person he killed when he attained the Monarch Realm would be her. However, Yang Ye felt quite sad when he heard of her death now. Because she’d died for the southern territory, no matter what!

Yang Ye suddenly realized that it was truly not easy for one to survive during such chaotic times!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, and then he gazed at An Biru. Her face was covered in sorrow and she even seemed to have been crying, so it was obvious to him how much pain she’d suffered from the death of the black clothed woman!

“I’m sorry!” Yang Ye felt that he had to apologize. In the end, it was he who made the Hallowed Grounds attack the southern territory, so he had to take responsibility for their deaths.

An Biru shook her head and said, “My clan avoided destruction by siding with you, so it naturally has to pay a price. It isn’t just my An Clan, there are many other clans and sects that aren’t just fighting for you, they are fighting for themselves as well. So, you don’t have to feel responsible at all.”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Did those assassins from the An Clan really have nothing to do with you?”

An Biru raised her head and gazed at him in silence.

Yang Ye said, “I’m sorry. But I’ve been constantly conflicted because of it. Because I’m unable to accept someone who tried to harm me in the past.”

She replied, “Would you believe me if I said that I didn’t?”

“I would!” Yang Ye nodded.

Her eyes flickered slightly, “Why?”

He answered, “Actually, I believed it from a very long time ago, but you never gave me an explanation.”

She exclaimed, “You never gave me the chance!”

Yang Ye said, “You were allies with my greatest enemy. How would I give you a chance? I’m not a magnanimous person, so I really did treat you as an enemy when you formed an alliance with Luo Jun.” He was a loyal person, but the precondition was that others were loyal to him. Otherwise, he was a merciless person instead.

An Biru fell silent because she had nothing to say. At that time, she hadn’t expected that Yang Ye would become enemies with Luo Jun and coupled with the powerful forces that Luo Jun possessed at the time, forming an alliance with him really could provide a huge amount of benefits to her clan. So, she’d led her clan to form an alliance with Luo Jun. But she hadn’t imagined that this decision would make her Yang Ye’s enemy.

It could only be explained as the will of the heavens playing tricks on her!

Yang Ye said, “Manage the southern territory’s affairs with Ding Shaoyao from now on, alright?” An Biru was definitely a capable person, but it wasn’t his idea to exclude her from any positions that held authority. The main reason was that Ding Shaoyao was clearly aware of the unresolved problem that existed between him and An Biru, and that was why she’d excluded An Biru from any authority.

However, An Biru shook her head and said, “My aunt was my only relative. Now that she’s dead, I’ve realized that the fate of the An Clan isn’t really important to me. If it’s possible, I would rather exchange the entire An Clan for her life. I’m tired, and I don’t want to worry about anything else anymore. I came to look for you because I wanted to tell you that I’m leaving. I won’t take the An Clan’s forces with me, so I hope that you’ll treat them well.”

“Can’t you stay?” Yang Ye stared her in the eye as he spoke.

“Do you want me to stay?” She stared him in the eye as well and replied with a question.

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and he hesitated for an instant. However, it was exactly that instant of hesitation that caused a trace of disappointment to flash through her eyes, and then she turned around and walked away.

However, An Biru stopped moving a moment later because Yang Ye had appeared in front of her, and he said, “I hope that you stay!” After experiencing so many things, Yang Ye understood that he really couldn’t just let go, because once he did, then it might be eternal.

Moreover, how could rest at ease knowing An Biru was all alone during such chaotic times?

An Biru gazed at him for a short while before she said, “Then I’ll stay!”

Just like that, she became Yang Ye’s right hand just like Ding Shaoyao, and the responsibility Ding Shaoyao shouldered reduced greatly because of it. Both of them were extremely intelligent women, so when they both worked together, everything within the southern territory was managed in an orderly fashion. Yang Ye didn’t have to worry at all.

After he finished arranging everything for An Biru, he was about to enter the Primordial Pagoda to check on An Nanjing. However, Yin Xuan’er had suddenly arrived at Ancient Domain City, and Shu Xin from the Treant Clan which had left previously was with her.

...

At the main hall of the City Governor’s Estate.

“Husband, it has been so long. I’ve really missed you!” Yin Xuan’er immediately smiled sweetly and walked over towards him. Her eyes were filled with tender affection, and it was like Yang Ye really was her ‘husband’ whom she hadn’t met for many years!

However, she’d only just arrived within a meter of him when a strand of Sword Intent pushed her back by over 10 steps. A wisp of surprise flashed through her eyes, but it wasn’t long before she recovered her composure, and she revealed sorrow instead, “Husband, what’re you doing? Why treat me like this? I’ve even been so worried about you all this time.”

Yin Xuan’er was very beautiful. Coupled with the sweet and gentle voice she used, and the extremely charming expression she revealed. She could be said to be extremely alluring.

But Yang Ye remained unfazed. He had a slightly favorable impression of her in the past, but she’d completely disregarded the situation of the southern territory throughout this period of time. Moreover, she’d immediately arrived once the Hallowed Grounds had been pushed back. He truly detested such actions.

If it wasn’t for the fact that she’d once lent him her gold guards during the battle outside the Saint Ruins, he couldn’t even be bothered to meet her.

“Miss Yin, please get to the point!” An Biru spoke flatly. Ding Shaoyao was still in the central territory as she was leading the charge against the Exalted Han Empire. So, An Biru was in charge of the affairs within the city and the southern territory. For now, Ding Shaoyao managed the external affairs while she managed the internal affairs.

Yin Xuan’er glanced at An Biru. She was a smart woman and knew that this woman from the An Clan held hostility towards her. As for the reason, it was obviously because of Yang Ye.

Yin Xuan’er withdrew her smile and revealed a calm expression as she said, “Young Master Yang, I came here on behalf of the northern territory. We want to....”

Yang Ye waved his hand and said, “I don’t want to deal with that. Ding Shaoyao has the final say. If you want to discuss it, then discuss it with her.”

Yin Xuan’er replied, “I came specially to talk to you because we weren’t able to come to an agreement with Miss Ding!”

Yang Ye asked, “What do you mean?”

She laughed bitterly and replied, “Because Miss Ding wants our northern territory to surrender unconditionally. Otherwise, she’ll lead the army to the north once she’s done with the Exalted Han Empire!”

“You don’t want to yield?” asked Yang Ye.

Yin Xuan’er pondered deeply for a moment before she said, “The northern territory is the fruit of the painstaking efforts of the Grand Preceptor and countless others from my Shang Dynasty. Even if I agree to give it away with such ease, the Grand Preceptor and those subordinates of mine wouldn’t allow it.”

“They won’t?” Yang Ye laughed coldly and said, “Then I’ll destroy it all.”

Yin Xuan’er’s expression changed, and she said, “Could it be that you really refuse to give me any leeway out of consideration for everything that has happened in the past?”

Yang Ye said, “I wouldn’t have even met you today if I didn’t. The continent must be united. If the northern territory refuses to yield, then only death will await all of you.”

Yin Xuan’er gazed at Yang Ye for a short while before she suddenly cracked a smile and said, “I heard that An Nanjing was heavily injured?”

Yang Ye’s intent sword suddenly swept forward and instantly arrived at Yin Xuan’er’s fair white forehead. Moreover, it had pierced her skin and caused a drop of blood to drop slowly down Yang Ye’s sword.

“Are you happy?” Yang Ye’s voice was icy cold, and the killing intent in his eyes was almost material.

All the others here were stunned when Yang Ye suddenly attacked, and it was especially so for Shu Xin. She’d been terrified to the point of taking a few steps back. On the other hand, Yin Xuan’er’s face had turned slightly pale while her eyes were filled with disbelief. She hadn’t expected that Yang Ye would actually attack her, and it would actually be so ruthless and merciless.

Yin Xuan’er’s temper flared up as well, and she stared coldly at Yang Ye and said, “An Nanjing’s meridians and bones were completely shattered, so only the Life Water of the Greenwood Clan is able to heal her quickly. I came here today to negotiate with you. Let the northern territory remain free and I’ll give it to you.”

Life Water! Yang Ye’s pupils constricted, and then he suddenly turned to look at Shu Xin. Shu Xin’s body trembled, and she couldn’t help but take a few steps back. She felt that Yang Ye was truly too terrifying when he was angry.

“Where is it?” Yang Ye stared her in the eyes, and his icy cold gaze carried a trace of urgency.

“She won’t give it to you!” Yin Xuan’er’s voice had turned cold, “You can dream of obtaining it if you don’t agree to my conditions. Let me see if the northern territory or An Nanjing is more important to you!”

An Biru shook her head. She knew Yang Ye’s character well, and he was absolutely one who responded very badly to threats. So, Yin Xuan’er was clearly courting death by threatening him. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Yang Ye glanced coldly at Yin Xuan’er, and then he withdrew his intent sword before he gazed at Shu Xin. He said, “I need the Life Water. Hand it over and I’ll let both of you leave safely!”

Shu Xin was quite afraid of Yang Ye. She gazed at Yin Xuan’er as if she was asking for her opinion. Yin Xuan’er grunted coldly and said, “Yang Ye, I told you just now. You can have the Life Water, but you must agree to my conditions first. I’ll hand it over immediately if you do! Otherwise, you can dream of obtaining it even if you kill us!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and said, “I’ll give you one last chance. Will you hand it over or not?”

“No!” Yin Xuan’er refused to give in!

Yang Ye nodded, and then he started walking towards the exit.

“Where’re you going?” asked An Biru.

“To slaughter the royal family of the northern territory and the Treant Clan!”
