Chapter 683 – An Expert Beneath The Ground!

Editor: Conspiracing

Silence.... Deathly silence....

There wasn’t a single person within the entire imperial palace, nor was there any sign of life. It was utterly deathly silent.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing frowned as they stood on the stone steps outside the palace.

“Be careful!” She said in a low voice, “Something seems to be off.”

Yang Ye nodded in response, and then both of them flashed into the palace. There was a single person seated on the throne, and it was Emperor Han.

Emperor Han’s hair was disheveled, his eyes completely red, and he seemed quite ferocious.

“Yang Ye, do you know why the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor didn’t destroy my empire all those years ago?” asked Emperor Han.

Yang Ye said, “I’m not interested.” The profound energy within him surged as he spoke.

Emperor Han revealed a savage smile as he said, “Because he didn’t dare to! Haha! You don’t believe me, right? Yes, he didn’t dare to. He was unmatched throughout the continent at that time, but he didn’t dare to annihilate my Exalted Han Empire. Do you know why? Because there’s someone even he fears within my empire!”

“If it’s true, then your empire wouldn’t have been reduced to such a state!” said Yang Ye.

Emperor Han stood up, and then his figure flashed and arrived before Yang Ye. He gave the mirror-like limestone floor a light tap with his right foot and said, “There’s a person beneath here, and he once killed a few dozen Saints of the continent on his own. He almost destroyed the entire continent. In the end, he was sealed by an ancestor of my Exalted Han Empire, and only the blood of someone from the royal family of my Exalted Han Empire is capable of undoing the seal!”

Rumble!

Suddenly, the entire palace started rumbling violently, and the ground started moving up and down like waves.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He took An Nanjing’s hand and flashed out of the palace. Meanwhile, both of them revealed extremely solemn expressions!

The profound energy within the grey robed man who stood far away in the distance had started to surge, and he spoke softly, “He’s finally coming out!”

“Who?” asked Yin Xuan’er.

The grey robed man replied in a low voice, “An expert that came from the same world as the defiant profounder yet isn’t a defiant profounder. The Undertaker is in danger!”

Yin Xuan’er’s heart shook because she felt heaviness in the grey robed man’s tone, and there was a trace of fear there as well!

“Hahaha!” Emperor Han’s frenzied laughter resounded from within the palace, and he said, “Yang Ye, didn’t you want to annihilate the royal family of my Exalted Han Empire? There’s no need for that because all the members of my empire’s royal family have taken their own lives. Hahaha! The Exalted Han Empire and blood of my Luo Clan will cease to exist on this continent from today onward. But it’s fine because you, the southern territory, and the entire continent will be buried alongside us. Hahaha!”

A huge explosion resounded as soon as he finished laughing, and then the entire palace collapsed.

In the next moment, something unexpected occurred!

The ground around Yang Ye and An Nanjing suddenly started to tremble. It wasn’t just all around the imperial palace, even the entire capital was trembling violently.

Countless people gazed towards the direction of the imperial palace with shock!

Crack!

A hole suddenly cracked upon on the ground over 30m away from Yang Ye and An Nanjing, and then it slowly grew in size until it was over 1km wide. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Huff! Huff!

The sound of breathing suddenly resounded from below!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed as he held An Nanjing’s hand tightly. At the same time, the Stone of Suppression appeared in front of him. He had no doubt that a peerless expert was sealed beneath the Exalted Han Empire.

Meanwhile, Elder Mu appeared before them. At this moment, Elder Mu had an extremely solemn expression on his face, and he gazed at the hole as he said, “I never expected that an expert who’s at least at the Saint Realm was sealed here on the continent!”

“The Saint Realm?” Yang Ye’s expression changed, and he said, “Elder Mu, that fellow down there is a Saint Realm expert?”

Elder Mu shook his head and said, “His aura isn’t at the Half-Saint Realm, but it isn’t at the Saint Realm either. In other words, he was definitely a Saint Realm expert in the past. Yet now, there’s no Quintessence Violet Energy on the entire continent and coupled with the fact that he has been sealed here for so long, it’s impossible for him to still remain at the Saint Realm!”

“I can still kill you even if I’m not at the Saint Realm!” A voice resounded from below the ground, “Not just you! Everything throughout this world has to die!”

Elder Mu said, “You can’t kill me. We’re only capable of heavily injuring each other at most. I presume it was the experts of the Outer Heavens and the ancestors of the Luo Clan who sealed you here. It isn’t worth it for us to heavily injure each other here. Of course, we can give it a try if you insist!”

“Then we shall!” A middle aged man rose up slowly from within the hole while these words resounded through the air. The middle aged man had long hair that hung down to his shoulders, a square face, dense brows, and wore a greyish white robe. There was a chain formed by symbols coiled around his robe, and it chained his entire body. Even his neck was chained by it.

The middle aged man exchanged glances with Elder Mu, and then both of them vanished at a speed which both An Nanjing and Yang Ye couldn’t see clearly. But it wasn’t long before they returned to where they stood earlier, and a pitch black hole which was over 600m wide had appeared before them. It was a spatial rift that had been smashed open from a powerful collision....

“Elder Mu....” Yang Ye suddenly gazed at Elder Mu with astonishment because Elder Mu’s entire right arm was actually gone....

Yin Xuan’er gazed at the grey robed man and said, “Grand Preceptor, are you not going to help?”

The grey robed man clenched his fists tightly but didn’t speak.

The middle aged man suddenly said, “Perhaps you would be able to fight me in my current state if you were at your prime. Unfortunately, the injuries within you haven’t healed completely. You’re not a match for me right now!”

“That may not necessarily be the case!” Elder Mu issued a command in his heart, and a black tombstone appeared before him, “I told you. You aren’t able to kill me in your current state!”

The middle aged man gazed at the tombstone for a short while before he nodded, “It’s a very good Dao Artifact. No wonder you’re that confident.”

He slowly closed his eyes as he spoke, and then countless material strands of spiritual energy covered the heavens and the earth as they swept off into the surroundings. He said, “So many years have passed, so I don’t know if the person I’m looking for is still alive. If he is, then all of you can thank the gods; but if he isn’t, then everyone in this world will be buried with him!”

It wasn’t long before the middle aged man opened his eyes, and a wisp of sorrow flashed through them. After that, the sorrow in his eyes transformed into ferocity, and he said, “He’s gone. I can’t find his aura. Since it’s like that, then everyone in this world can die!”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye walked over to Elder Mu’s side while his profound energy surged into the Stone of Suppression. The stone immediately emanated a strange force that enveloped down upon the middle aged man.

A wisp of surprise flashed through the middle aged man when he saw the Stone of Suppression, and then his gaze descended onto Yang Ye.

However, he was utterly stunned when he saw Yang Ye.

“Is your surname... Yang?”
