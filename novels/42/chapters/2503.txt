Chapter 2504 – Sorry! I Used a Little Too Much Strength!

The Demon King hadn’t shown itself in its true form, and it was here in the form of a human. Besides a slightly robust figure, it was no different than a normal human.

As soon as the demon king arrived, its gaze descended upon Xing Biqing. Meanwhile, Xing Biqing shot out of the city.

They entered into battle.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had turned around and left.

Actually, it was equivalent to a show put on by the War Dimension. But it was quite a brutal show because they were doing everything for real.

He wasn’t interested in all of this.

Yang Ye returned to the hotel, and he encountered a young man at the door.

Yang Ye glanced at the young man, and the latter’s divine sense was locked onto him. Obviously, the young man was here for him.

Yang Ye asked, “The Leng Clan?”

The young man nodded slightly, “Leng Xuan!”

Yang Ye said, “I don’t want to waste time with you.”

The young man smiled, “We don’t want to waste time with you either.”

As soon as he finished speaking, an old man appeared behind him.

A Five World Realm expert!

Obviously, the Leng Clan was being serious now.

Yang Ye glanced at the old man and said, “Sure enough, fight the young and the old come for you.”

The young man chuckled, “You were able to instantly kill a Four World Realm expert, so regardless of whether you used a secret technique or something else, we have to admit that you’re very, very strong. We underestimated you before this, but we won’t make the same mistake.”

Yang Ye walked over to the young man, looked the young man in the eyes, and grinned, “How are you so sure that you’re not underestimating me now?”

The young man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “And how are you so sure that this is our final trump card?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I planned on giving someone face and not allow such things to continue between us. However, after giving it further thought, I remembered that the Leng Clan hasn’t been very good to her anyway. So, since you refuse to let the matter rest, then let’s just put an end to it.”

He walked into the House of Indulgence.

The young man and old man followed him.

Yang Ye gazed at the young man, “Pay the World Crystal.”

The young man glanced at Yang Ye, “Needless to say, you’re very confident. You…”

Yang Ye waved his hand and flicked a World Crystal over to Elder Xing.

Elder Xing glanced at Yang Ye, hesitated for a moment, and said, “Young Master Yang, you’re in a deluxe room, so you’re under the House of Indulgence’s protection. Do you need it?”

A deluxe room? Yang Ye was stunned. Aren’t I in a standard room?

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to figure it out. The old man was showing goodwill to him!

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “it’s alright. Since the Leng Clan wants a fight, they can have it. I’m a professional when it comes to killing!”

Elder Xing glanced at Yang Ye and didn’t say another word. He just waved his right hand, and the surroundings changed. It didn’t take long for Yang Ye and the old man to appear in the void.

A battle against a Five World Realm expert!

The old man gazed at Yang Ye in silence while an extremely powerful wave of pressure swept out from him!

Aura!

Imposing aura!

Yang Ye looked up above him, “Elder Xing, I don’t want anyone to watch this battle.”

Elder Xing pondered deeply for a moment, and then he formed a strange seal with both hands. After that, a strand of mysterious energy covered the pocket of space that Yang Ye and the old man were in. At this moment, even Elder Xing and the young man in the hotel weren’t able to view the battle.

However, Yang Ye still wasn’t satisfied. After Elder Xing placed that mysterious seal over the battlefield, he withdrew the Myriad World Diagram and locked down the space here. So, if anyone tried to take a peek into this world, he would sense it immediately.

The old man noticed this. He glanced at the surroundings and gazed at Yang Ye, “Is my fate about to be sealed too?”

As far as he was concerned, since Yang Ye was locking down the space here and had even used a Divine Treasure to do so, it was obvious that Yang Ye’s trump card was huge! Very huge!

But it was fine to him because he’d prepared himself for the worst!

Yang Ye glanced at the old man. Suddenly, he stretched out his right hand and pressed it down.

Bang!

The entire battlefield shook violently while the old man was blasted over 1km back by a wave of powerful energy!

The old man gazed at Yang Ye with astonishment. There was a seal floating where he’d been standing a moment ago!

The Universe Seal!

The Universe Seal that possessed the strength of 5 worlds now!

Another Divine Treasure!

The old man glanced at Yang Ye with an extremely solemn expression on his face. The young man before him actually had two Divine Treasures! While Divine Treasures weren’t as precious as Super Divine Treasures, they weren’t common!

Suddenly, Yang Ye tapped a finger forward. The Universe Seal suddenly appeared above the old man. It wasn’t just the Universe Seal, another seal appeared there too!

Two seals!

The Seal of Suppression suppressed the old man’s cultivation and almost suppressed him back down to the Four World Realm. Actually, it had suppressed him to the Four World Realm, but for some reason, the old man was actually able to push his cultivation back up to the Five World Realm. However, the force of the Universe Seal had fully struck the old man.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the old man was blasted away once more.

As soon as he stopped himself, two flying swords flashed, and then they were at both sides of his throat. The old man was shocked when he sensed them, and a powerful aura instantly swept out of him. At the same time, a blood red brush appeared above Yang Ye.

Defense and counterattack!

If he only defended, the only response he would gain was an endless assault from Yang Ye!

The old man had been surviving in the War Dimension for so many years, so he naturally understood all of that. Thus, while it had been extremely dangerous, he’d still instantly reacted in many ways!

The blood red brush above Yang Ye suddenly started spinning. A moment later, a ray of bright light shot down. Its speed and strength wasn’t any inferior to Yang Ye’s flying swords!

The blood red brush was a Divine Treasure too!

Yang Ye glanced at the light, and then another sword shot up into the air and stabbed against it.

Hiss!RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

This sword instantly sliced through the light! Moreover, it didn’t stop and stabbed at the blood red brush!

However, the brush suddenly vanished.

Yang Ye frowned slightly because the brush had fled itself! Obviously, it had sensed how terrifying Executor was!

Yes, Yang Ye had sent Executor at it just now!

Yang Ye looked off into the distance. At this moment, the old man was over 1km away, and there were two blood red holes in his chest. The old man’s countenance was extremely pale and without a shred of color.

However, the space around him had condensed and formed a spatial wall!

The old man seemed extremely vigilant, or it should be said that he seemed like he was going against a formidable opponent!

The old man stared at Yang Ye, “Six Divine Treasures and a Super Divine Treasure, and it’s even the number one sword of my Eternal Kingdom! Who are you?!”

At this moment, the old man’s voice was quite hoarse!

He’d been suppressed!

However, it was quite aggrieving for him! Very, very aggrieving, even! This guy before him actually had six Divine Treasures! Six! Were they common weapons? Moreover, he even had a Super Divine Treasure!

A Super Divine Treasure!

Even the Leng Clan only had one! And it was something the Leng Clan had been passing down for generations since the ancient times! However, this guy before him actually had one. Six Divine Treasures and one Super Divine Treasure. Was this even a competition of strength? It was a competition of equipment!

Obviously, he was being completely crushed when it came to equipment.

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath on the old man. He commanded the two seals to charge at the old man once more. Moreover, two flying swords shot out of the Sword Gourd, and they were like bolts of lightning that made the old man’s expression change drastically as soon as they appeared.

In an instant, the spatial walls around the old man were sliced into bits. However, the blood red brush above the old man suddenly flickered in midair, and then a strand of blood red light instantly covered the entire battlefield.

Slaughter intent!

Powerful slaughter intent and the stench of blood suffused the entire battlefield, and the red light was ceaselessly attacking Yang Ye’s seals and swords!

Yang Ye glanced at the blood red brush, “Both offensive and defensive?”

It was a Divine Treasure just like his seals and swords, but at this moment, it was actually stopping both the seals and swords. Besides the brush itself, the most important reason was the old man’s strength!

The old man was a Five World Realm expert. When someone in his realm of cultivation used a Divine Treasure, they were able to bring a Divine Treasure’s strength to its limits! Moreover, the old man had definitely been using the brush for countless years, so he knew everything about it.

Once he thought up to this point, Yang Ye made up his mind. He planned to train with his Divine Treasures more frequently and try his best to fully utilize their strength!

“Who are you?!” Suddenly, the old man spoke in a hoarse voice. He stared at Yang Ye as if he wanted to see through Yang Ye!

Would an ordinary person be able to possess so many Divine Treasures and a Super Divine Treasure?

It was obviously impossible!

The Leng Clan had offended such a monstrous genius of unknown origin without even fully figuring out the situation, and this was very likely to bring annihilation to the Leng Clan!

Yang Ye glanced at the old man, “It’s time to end this!”

Yang Ye took a step forward.

The Sword Domain!

As soon as the Sword Domain appeared, the old man was stunned.

The Sword Domain!

A moment later, the blood red light around the old man was obliterated without making a single sound, and then two flying swords slashed through the old man’s throat!

Hiss!

The old man’s head fell off his neck!

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the old man’s spatial ring and the blood red brush immediately entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye removed the effects of the Myriad World Diagram and returned to the hotel.

Yang Ye walked over to the young man with the old man’s head in his hand, and then he placed the head before the young man, “Sorry, I used a little too much strength and accidentally took his head! You don’t mind, right?”
