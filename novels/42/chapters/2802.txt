Chapter 2803 – But I’m Afraid!

The prehistoric times!

The prehistoric times were the times before humans existed.

It was when the chaos had just been split apart, and it was a world that belonged only to demon beasts and some sprites. Humans hadn’t been born then!

Strictly speaking, these evil beasts came before Destiny.

Of course, the era before Destiny was the earliest era.

However, she’d put an end to it with her own hands!

The prehistoric times was also known as the Heaven Dao Era.

At that time, the Heaven Dao and all living beings lived in harmony.

After that, it was the Destiny Era, and even now, it was still the Destiny Era.

The mysterious expert glanced at the pillars. The evil beasts on them had started to wriggle as if they were about to awaken.

Zuo Mu and the others stood silently behind the mysterious expert.

At this moment, they grew even more curious about the mysterious expert’s identity. It was obvious that he was from an even earlier era than Destiny.

Who was he?

The mysterious expert didn’t say, and they didn’t ask!

The pillars started to crack open slowly…

Eternal Border.

Ding Shaoyao and the others descended on the peak of a mountain. There were only around 20 of them, and most of them were seriously injured.

She glanced at them and remained silent.

They’d lost almost half of their forces!

The Three Dimensional Universe had suffered severe losses in their war against the Four Dimensional Universe. It was even when they had the help of a formation. Otherwise, practically all the Destiny Realm experts from the Three Dimensional Universe would have perished in the battle!

The gap in their strength was too huge!

Huang Ying spoke solemnly, “Miss Ding, what do we do now?”

What to do now!

The others gazed at her, and she looked up at the sky. A ray of sword energy shot over from there.

A moment later, Yang Ye appeared before them.

They heaved a sigh of relief upon catching sight of him, and it didn’t just end there, even their tense nerves relaxed.

Yang Ye’s presence instilled confidence in them!

They gazed at Yang Ye, and the latter spoke solemnly, “Senior Chen, immediately set up a formation. It’s best if you can set up the Universe Formation again!”

Chen Dao’zi hesitated for a moment and said, “I’m afraid that may not be possible. The universe… is in absolute chaos right now.”

Chaos!

Ding Shaoyao nodded, “According to the information I received, all the worlds in the Three Dimensional Universe are like hell on earth. Even though the disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect and the others I sent have been trying to suppress this, it isn’t working very well!”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment and said, “Just sent the word that I’m still alive!”

Everyone was stunned for a moment, even Ding Shaoyao was slightly stunned. But just a moment later, she smiled, “I actually didn’t think about that!”

As she spoke, she clapped her hands. A moment later, a black clothed figure appeared before her, “Strategist, what is your command?”

She replied, “Spread the word that Yang Ye is still alive.”

The black clothed figure hesitated for a moment and said, “That’s it?”

Ding Shaoyao nodded, “That’s it!”

“Understood!” The black clothed figure turned around and left.

Under Ding Shaoyao’s control, it didn’t take long for the news of Yang Ye being alive to spread like the plague throughout the universe!

A short while later, the worlds throughout the Three Dimensional Universe started to calm down.

No one was suppressing them!

Just Yang Ye’s name alone was too, too heavy for them. Especially when countless powers and people were extremely fearful of how ruthless and decisive Yang Ye was.

He was alive! That meant the order and laws he established still existed, and they had to abide by them!

They could choose to not abide by it, but it would require the courage to face Yang Ye!

In the end, they were afraid!

They were afraid that Yang Ye would come for them. After all, Yang Ye was alive, and he’d stopped the Four Dimensional Universe.

In a hall, Yang Ye sat at the seat of the host, and there were only around 20 people down below. All of them were Destiny Realm experts. They were the last remaining Destiny Realm experts in the Three Dimensional Universe.

Many were gone!

Jian Wudi was gone too!

Yang Ye remained silent for some time, and the atmosphere in the hall was quite heavy.

A short while later, Ding Shaoyao broke the silence, “Our greatest enemy isn’t the Four Dimensional Universe but that woman!”

Destiny!

A solemn expression appeared on all of their faces.

The Three Dimensional Universe still had hope in battle against the Four Dimensional Universe. After all, they had Yang Ye, Yang Busi, Qi Bitian, and Tian Xiu. However, when facing that godlike woman who stood above the clouds, the entire Three Dimensional Universe really had no hope!

They weren’t being pessimistic, they were filled with despair!

Even someone as formidable as Monarch Yan had been forced to his knees before her, so how terrifying was she?

Ding Shaoyao gazed at Yang Ye, “Even if we defeat the Four Dimensional Universe, we cannot avoid destruction while she is alive. It can be said that even if we annihilate the Four Dimensional Universe, it won’t solve the root of the problem.”

Destiny!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly while the woman’s face appeared in his mind.

Even he felt powerless before her.

How to fight her?

Yang Ye was quite lost as well. Because he knew that his current strength was absolutely no match for her. Even if he fully unleashed the Fate Sword Dao, he would be no match for her.

At this moment, he recalled what Yang Busi had said in the past!

The endless path of immortality ends at Destiny’s feet!

It meant that while the path of cultivation was endless, it would be at its end when one met Destiny.

She was like a mountain in everyone’s hearts, a mountain that was impossible to surmount!

Yang Ye suddenly stood up and everyone gazed at him. He glanced at them and asked, “Do you regret your decision?”

Regret!

They understood what Yang Ye meant and shook their heads.

Liu Yuan said, “Even though all of us may die, but at the very least, we’re holding our heads up high!”

Indeed, the peak experts of the Three Dimensional Universe hadn’t cowered before the army of the Four Dimensional Universe, not even if many of them perished in Eternal Kingdom. None of them had chosen to shrink back or surrender!

Unyielding!

It was the spirit they had right now!

It could be said that many of them were much, much stronger than before. Regardless of whether it was sword cultivators or other cultivators, their mental state was extremely important. In the past, they’d kept avoiding a clash, and they kept enduring the humiliation that came with it. In the end, it made them numb and lose their edge. How far could someone go on the path of cultivation if they’d lost their edge?

If they were said to have been fighting for their own interests before, then now, they were actually fighting for their own path of the Martial Dao.

No one in the Destiny Realm didn’t want to advance further!

Yang Ye grinned, “I’m very happy. Before this, everyone here, including me, had a lot of enmity between us. However, when the universe that belongs to all of us was in danger, we were able to step forward and fight together… I’m truly happy. Everyone, let the past remain in the past. Now, let us fight them to the death. Even if we die, we will die with honor!”

Many started smiling.

Death wasn’t that terrifying to them anymore!

Actually, once death was disregarded, they realized that Destiny wasn’t that terrifying! If worse comes to worse, they would just die! If they weren’t afraid of death, why would they ever fear Destiny?

Once they thought up to this point, the atmosphere in the hall instantly lightened up.

Yang Ye gazed at Ding Shaoyao, “Miss Ding will represent me in my absence. She won’t do anything rash, so I hope all of you will work with her.

As he spoke, Yang Ye removed the Sword Gourd and flicked it over to her.

Everyone here was puzzled.

However, Ding Shaoyao obviously understood what he was doing. She didn’t accept the Sword Gourd, nor did she speak. She just gazed at him.

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m leaving that sword to you!”

She spoke solemnly, “Must you leave?”

Leave!

Everyone knew what Yang Ye was planning now.

Yang Ye smiled, “If I stay, it won’t make much of a difference. Moreover, I don’t like to wait for death to arrive. The Four Dimensional Universe and Destiny are our enemies, and there’s the revenge I must get for my martial ancestor… I will do my best to keep them busy out there. As for the experts that the Four Dimensional Universe sends into our universe, I’ll leave all of them to you.”

Ding Shaoyao frowned slightly, “You plan to stop the Four Dimensional Universe on your own?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Destiny too!”

The expressions of everyone here changed!

Not fearing Destiny was one thing, but charging at her was an entirely different thing!

Ding Shaoyao shook her head, “D-Don’t be rash!”

Her voice was trembling slightly.

Yang Ye chuckled, “She is like a barrier, and it’s actually a barrier of the heart. The more we fear her, the stronger she gets, and the weaker we are. It isn’t just me, it’s the same for all of you. If you ever encounter difficulties, try your best to face them and resolve them, not avoid them. The more you try to run away, the weaker you are, and the greater that difficulty will be.”

He walked off toward the exit once he finished speaking.

Meanwhile, Ding Shaoyao suddenly appeared before him.

She gazed at him in silence.

Yang Ye grinned, “I’m not going to give my life away. I’m just going to face the fear in my heart. I want her to know that she’s extremely formidable, but I’m not afraid of her, I’m truly not afraid of her.”

Ding Shaoyao replied softly, “That may be no different than courting death!”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “If she didn’t come looking for trouble with us, then I would really be courting death by seeking her out. However, no matter what I do, she will come to kill us. When war is unavoidable, don’t ever hope to be lucky, just face it bravely.”

He grinned at this point, “I have no fear in my heart, and so my sword is without fear!”

Ding Shaoyao looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “But I’m afraid!”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Ding Shaoyao took two steps forward, combed his slightly disheveled hair, and smiled, “I won’t try to stop you anymore, but promise me that you’ll come back. Promise me, alright?”

While she was smiling, tears were rolling down her face.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m
