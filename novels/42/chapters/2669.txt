Chapter 2670 – Yang Busi!

They had Big Brother Yang!

As far as they were concerned, they had Yang Ye to help them with everything.

So, the two little fellows had nothing to worry about. They just led the cows and sheep off as they went off happily into the distance.

Meanwhile, trembling came from the pavilion from time to time.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged near the pavilion and seemed like he was in a meditative state.

Sword intent!

He was carefully sensing the changes in his sword intent.

His sword intent had undergone slight changes when he faced the pair of eyes earlier. However, he had to send the woman in black back to her Destiny Dimension, so he didn’t have time to sense it carefully. Now, he planned to sense it properly and comprehend the changes.

The previous battle had allowed him to realize that his only advantage against those old geezers was his sword. If he lost his sword, he wouldn’t be able to fight them.

Including Tai Huntian. If it wasn’t for Past Life and Heaven Executor, he would definitely not be a match for him!

He had a lot of space to grow!

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something at this point, and he shot a glance into the distance. Snowy and Erya’s figures were gradually vanishing there.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and didn’t stop them in the end.

This place should be safe!

Even if it wasn’t, he could arrive before them in an instant!

Continue cultivating!

Erya rode the cow forward into the distance, and the cow beneath her was trembling.

Erya patted it with slight displeasure, “What are you afraid of? I won’t eat you!”

It was better when she hadn’t said anything, because as soon as she did, the cow shuddered and almost fell to the ground.

Meanwhile, Snowy appeared on its horn. She patted the cow’s horn gently to say that it had nothing to be afraid of.

At this point, she seemed to have thought of something and glanced at the sheep.

She remembered that she used to have roast lamb!

Actually, both the sheep and cow were afraid. They were mainly afraid of Erya. While Erya wasn’t that bad, the aura she emanated was a huge threat to demon beasts and beings like them!

Snowy moved her gaze away from the sheep and abandoned her desire to have roast lamb. Because she thought of the woman in black. That woman was raising these sheep. So, she would probably be beaten up if she ate them!

Moreover, she’d just ridden the sheep, so it wasn’t very nice to eat the sheep now!

The two little fellows sped up. Finally, they arrived at a gorge, and the gorge was covered in tombstones!

One after the other, they filled the gorge!

Erya gazed at Snowy, “This looks like a cemetery!”

Snowy pointed ahead.

Erya glanced at the surroundings and said, “Fine, then let’s head over. But is the treasure there good? If it isn’t, it’s best if we don’t go. Because Big Brother Yang will probably have to suffer a beating!”

Erya still had a heart!

Snowy waved her paws excitedly. She was saying that the treasures over there were absolutely great!

Erya couldn’t endure the temptation.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

In the end, the two little fellows continued forward.

However, the cows and sheep didn’t dare to follow them.

Snowy glanced at them and waved her little paws.

They gazed at her with slight bewilderment. Meanwhile, Erya said, “She’s saying that everyone who participates will get a share. So, you’ll get some treasures if you come with us!”

In the end, the lead cow and sheep followed Erya and Snowy in!

As they moved forward, they noticed that every one of these tombstones had something placed before them, and many of them were treasures.

Snowy wanted to take them, but Erya stopped her. Erya said seriously, “Snowy, it’s best not to take these. Big Brother Yang will probably get beaten up for it, and even we will suffer!”

Snowy blinked. In the end, she chose to trust Erya and didn’t take them.

The two little fellows continued forward.

Suddenly, Erya stopped and went over to a relatively huge tombstone. There was a line of words on it.

She gazed at them carefully. They were different from the writing used in this era, but she could read it!

She didn’t know why she could!

Meanwhile, Snowy pointed at it, and Erya spoke softly, “The Mortal Emperor, the first emperor of human history, and the first leader of the human race in history. He united the human race in the third month of the Year of Dawn, his sword is God Inquisitor. In the fourth month, he died in battle against the Heaven Dao.”

Once she finished, Erya looked down at the area before the tombstone. There was a hilt there, but the sword’s blade was gone. There was a seal beside it too. The seal was golden and made of unknown jade, and there was a ferocious beast inscribed on it.

Snowy gazed at Erya, and the latter spoke softly, “He must have been a very, very formidable existence in his time.”

She was about to leave when Snowy stopped her. Snowy pointed at the seal.

Erya gazed at it, and then she was stunned.

Because the demon beast on the seal had a pair of horns that were exactly like her own!

Erya touched her horns and gazed at Snowy.

Snowy lifted up the seal, and there were a few words inscribed on its bottom.

Snowy gazed at Erya, and the latter touched the words and spoke softly, “As the people wish, I slaughter the Heaven Dao.”

Erya thought for quite some time, and then she put the seal back. After that, she led Snowy away. However, the seal suddenly flew over to Erya.

Snowy and Erya exchanged glances. In the end, the seal was hung on Erya’s waist.

The two little fellows continued forward!

Right when they were about to leave the cemetery, Erya suddenly stopped. She looked to the right, and there was an extremely huge tombstone there. It was even larger than the Mortal Emperor’s tombstone.

Snowy and Erya walked over, and the cow and sheep followed closely behind.

A short while later, Erya stopped and gazed at the tombstone. There was a line of words on it as well.

Snowy gazed at Erya, and she read softly, “Name unknown. Possessor of an ordinary body who defied the heavens with his Dagger-Axe and remained unmatched against all. In the fourth month, he died in battle against the Heaven Dao after 304 exchanges.”

Erya gazed at the tombstone, and there was a spear before it. A scarlet spear covered in cracks. It had turned red from all the blood, and there was a drop of blood flowing around its tip.

Meanwhile, a figure appeared here.

An Nanjing!

It was An Nanjing who’d been in closed door cultivation all this time. She walked over to the spear known as Dagger-Axe and took it. The spear shook violently, causing An Nanjing to frown and say, “Besides me, you can’t find a better master.”

The spear gradually calmed down.

An Nanjing took it and returned to the Primordial Pagoda!

Snowy pointed at the empty spot before the tombstone and gazed at Erya with shock.

Erya asked, “Do you have an objection?”

Snowy hurriedly shook her head.

If they offended the woman in black, it may be Yang Ye who suffered, but if they offended An Nanjing, they would definitely be the ones who suffered!

Both Snowy and Erya feared and respected An Nanjing!

Erya and Snowy had no objections about An Nanjing’s actions. They just felt that she was so shameless to take someone else’s treasures like that.

At least Erya would call it borrowing, but An Nanjing had just taken it!

Erya and Snowy continued onward. Meanwhile, Snowy seemed to have thought of something and gazed at the cow and sheep. She felt slightly bad because these two followers of theirs hadn’t gotten anything!

Snowy thought for a moment and produced two fruits out of thin air.

Chaotic Fruits!

Snowy passed the fruits to them, and the cow and sheep couldn’t keep their eyes away from the fruits.

Once they consumed it, they started tearing up from excitement. After all, the grass they’d had all their life couldn’t compare to the taste of this fruit!

At this moment, the cow and sheep had decided to change allegiances!

They received the best when staying with these two little fellows!

Just like that, Snowy and Erya continued forward, and it didn’t take long for them to leave the cemetery.

Erya stopped at the final tombstone.

It was slightly special.

It wasn’t that huge, but it had three strands of sword energy before it. The seemingly material sword energy were like three incense sticks.

Erya walked over to the tombstone, and she saw a row of words on it as well.

Snowy couldn’t read them, so she gazed at Erya. The latter looked at them closely and spoke softly, “There is an end to the Heaven Dao, and immortality awaits beyond death. Yang Busi, a genius of her time who created the Six Crushers. In the 12th month of the Year of Dawn, she fought the Heaven Dao, and fought it for seven days and six nights with all six moves of the Six Crushers. She was defeated.”

Erya and Snowy looked before the tombstone, and there was a pitch black scroll placed before it.

Erya and Snowy exchanged glances. In the end, they nodded lightly and shot furtive glances at the surroundings. After that, she grabbed the scroll and tossed it into the Primordial Pagoda before walking off with Snowy as if nothing had happened.

Snowy seemed to have thought of something, so she glanced at the cow and sheep and shushed them.

The cow and sheep nodded while not fully understanding what she meant.

Erya and Snowy walked out of the cemetery. There was a river beyond the cemetery, and Snowy led them upstream along the river.

A short while later, they arrived at the end of it. There was a pool there, and a huge waterfall was crashing down from above it.

Snowy gazed at the pool, and then Erya asked, “The treasure is down there?”

Snowy nodded.

Erya asked, “Is it dangerous?”

Snowy thought for quite some time. Meanwhile, Erya felt quite speechless, “You have to think about that?”

Snowy thought for a moment. In the end, she shook her head.

Erya heaved a sigh of relief.

Actually, Snowy had estimated everyone’s strength before deducing if it was dangerous.

For example, it was dangerous if it was just her, Erya, and Yang Ye. However, if the woman in black was included, then it wouldn’t be dangerous.

At this moment, she’d included the woman in black.

Erya moved her palms in opposite directions, and the pool of water slowly split apart.

Suddenly, the woman in black opened her eyes and cursed, “You little bastards! Can’t you know your own limits?!”

Bam!

Yang Ye was blasted away outside the wooden pavilion.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
