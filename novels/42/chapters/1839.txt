Chapter 1840 – Flaw Piercer!

Cultivate the techniques of the shaman race!

As far as Yang Ye was concerned, it didn’t matter where the technique came from, so long as he could improve his strength.

Is the entire human race filled with good people? Are the members of the shaman race bad? The strong decide who’s good and bad in this world!

So long as Yang Ye was sufficiently strong, the problems that the Divine Yin Flame mentioned wouldn’t be problems at all. If his strength wasn’t sufficient, then even entering the large universe would be a huge problem!

Meanwhile, Hou Qing suddenly asked, “Are you sure that you won’t regret it?”

Yang Ye gazed at Hou Qing, “Do you think that I will?”

Hou Qing nodded slightly, “Alright, then I’ll give you a drop of my bloodline. Even though I don’t possess an Emperor Rank bloodline in the shaman race, it isn’t of low quality either. This droplet of my bloodline is fully sufficient for you right now.”

As he spoke, a pearl of blood flashed out from the center of his forehead and appeared in front of Yang Ye.

It was the size of a thumb, and it flickered with a bloody glow and contained a strand of pure energy.

Hou Qing said, “Let it into your heart and merge with your bloodline. Remember not to resist it!”

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to send it into his heart. Once it entered his heart, Yang Ye’s body started to tremble violently, and then the pearl of blood exploded apart and flowed through his heart to every corner of his body.

Rejection!

Yang Ye’s blood was instinctively rejecting it. However, it gradually stopped resisting while under Yang Ye’s control. At the same time, the Primordial Violet Energy within him enveloped the pearl of blood. With the help of the Primordial Violet Energy, it didn’t take long for the pearl of blood to merge completely with Yang Ye’s own blood!

“It was much easier than I expected!” Hou Qing continued, “Now, you have two choices. There are two divisions in my shaman race. The strength and shaman technique divisions. Which one do you choose?”

Yang Ye replied, “Both!”

Hou Qing nodded slightly, “Just as I expected. However, I have to warn you that cultivating it isn’t easy at all. Your current physical strength is at your own limit, and merely relying on Fruits of Rebirth is impossible to improve it further. Moreover, forcefully improving your physical strength will damage your body.”

Yang Ye said, “So I should learn the shaman techniques for now?”

Hou Qiong shook his head, “You’ll learn how to control and use strength. The reason that fellow, the Night Emperor, could suppress you was because his control of various forms of energy far surpasses your own. For example, his control of spatial energy is sufficient to casually reconstruct space to a state that’s most advantageous to him, and then use it to attack you. However, you can only shatter it. Modification and creation are much more difficult than destruction!”

He gazed at Yang Ye at this point, “That’s where the gap between you two lies. They aren’t just able to destroy, they can modify. Modify the Laws, intent, space, energy, and the world! That’s the Enlightened Realm. Enlightenment of all things, understanding all things, and changing all things!”

Yang Ye nodded, “What should I do?”

A rock floated over to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at Hou Qing with bewilderment. Hou Qing explained, “Hit that rock with all your strength, but I want it to remain intact!”

Yang Ye frowned, “How can that be possible?”

Suddenly, Hou Qing’s head slammed against the rock.

Boom!

A muffled explosion resounded. The space in the surroundings trembled violently, but the rock didn’t move at all and wasn’t harmed in the slightest.

Hou Qing gazed at Yang Ye, “Why not? Use something small to gain something big. I’m asking you to train like this so that you’ll be able to control your strength better. Your current attainment in the body is at the Blood Rebirth Realm. If you’re able to control it perfectly, then you can kill that fellow, the Night Emperor, with just your physical strength! I’m at the Blood Rebirth Realm, just like you. If my main body were to fight that fellow, it would take only three moves to kill him. If I used my full strength, just one attack would suffice!”

Yang Ye gazed at Qiong Qi, and the latter nodded slightly, “He isn’t lying. Kid, I was actually aware of your problems, but I’m not skilled at teaching, and I don’t know how to teach you. After all, I’m from the demon race, so the way we cultivate is completely different from humans. But Hou Qing isn’t like me. His status in the large universe isn’t low at all. In short, just listen to him!”

Yang Ye nodded and gazed at Hou Qing, “I’m sorry for doubting your ability!”

Hou Qing replied, “We’ve always been enemies, so it’s normal to not trust me. However, since you want to learn my shaman race’s techniques, you must listen to me from now on. Even if I tell you to chop off your hand, you must do as I say. Otherwise, get someone else to teach you!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath, “Alright.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he gazed at his fist and slammed it forward.

Boom!

The rock exploded into bits.

Hou Qing said, “Continue until you can leave it completely unharmed!”

Yang Ye nodded.

After that, Yang Ye started striking rocks like a madman. Over and over again…

Qiong Qi asked, “Aren’t you going to tell him how to do it?”

Hou Qing shook his head slightly, “Do you know what his greatest flaw is? Comprehension. His foundation isn’t that solid. Even though fighting can help one improve rapidly, if one doesn’t sit down to consolidate and comprehend everything, the increase in strength is limited. I want him to steady his heart and comprehend. Moreover, a person’s own comprehension is always greater than an answer provided by someone else!”

Qiong Qi turned to gaze at Hou Qing, “Why did you agree to teach him?”

Hou Qing gazed at Yang Ye, “No reason!”

Qiong Qi glanced at Hou Qing and remained silent.

In the cultivation room.

Yang Ye struck the rocks over and over again. However, he failed over and over again. In the beginning, he became slightly agitated, but it didn’t take long for him to make himself calm down.

Ponder!

He didn’t continue striking rocks, and he started to think. He was thinking about how to strike a rock and prevent it from shattering.

Just like that, Yang Ye thought for three days.

Finally, he struck it again.

His fist slammed against the rock.

Boom!

Space shook in the surroundings, but the rock exploded apart. However, a smile had curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s lips. Because the rock hadn’t been obliterated upon being shattered.

At this moment, he’d gained a little bit of understanding.

Control of strength!

The rock existed in space. So, when he swung his fist, it could merge into space and strike space. In that way, it would be space that endured the force of the blow and not the rock.

Once he thought up to this point, a thought appeared in Yang Ye’s mind.

After that, a sword appeared in his grasp. He stabbed it at the rock.

Bang!

The rock shook violently and cracked apart, but it merely cracked and hadn’t shattered!

Hou Qing and Qiong Qi exchanged glances when they witnessed this, and then Hou Qing spoke solemnly, “The sword still suits that fellow the best!”

After that, Yang Ye stopped using his fist and used his sword instead.

Every single swing carried his full strength. In the beginning, the rock still cracked open, but after around two weeks of mad training, every single swing of his sword left the rock completely unharmed.

Yang Ye didn’t stop and started to enhance his attacks with sword intent and slaughter intent. But in the beginning, not to mention the rock, he even stabbed a hole through space.

It was too powerful!

However, he didn’t give up and continued training.

Just like that, more than two weeks passed, and Yang Ye’s sword, which was enhanced with sword intent and slaughter intent, was finally able to strike the rock without shattering it.

However, that wasn’t the end of it.

Now, Yang Ye started to use his strongest attack, Split Second.

It was his strongest attack! As soon as he executed it, the rock was instantly obliterated by the powerful force his attack carried.

Training like a madman!

Swing after swing!

Just like that, three months passed. Finally, even his strongest attack didn’t shatter the rock.

Yang Ye had his sword in hand as he went over to Hou Qing with a smile on his face. He said, “Senior, I’ve succeeded in my training, but I have a question. What’s the point of it?”

Hou Qing gazed at Yang Ye, “There is none!”

Yang Ye’s face froze, “Are you joking?”

Hou Qing replied, “Do I look like I’m joking?”

At this moment, Yang Ye felt like swinging his sword at Hou Qing.

Suddenly, Hou Qing said, “It’s useless by itself, but the next move I teach you will be very useful. You have to be able to do what you just accomplished in order to learn it.”

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Hou Qing gazed at Yang Ye, “I planned to make you learn how to overcome everything with strength, but now I intend to teach you how to truly destroy all things with a swing of your sword, Flaw Piercer!”

“Piercing through flaws?” Yang Ye frowned, “I already know how to do that!”

“You know my ass!” Hou Qing said, “Aren’t you ashamed to call that a form of flaw piercing?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Hou Qing suddenly gazed at Qiong Qi and said, “Brother Qiong Qi, attack him!”

Qiong Qi nodded, and then he slammed his figure at Yang Ye.

Excitement appeared in Yang Ye’s eyes. He didn’t dodge and just swung his sword.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then Qiong Qi was blasted backwards. As for Yang Ye, he was pushed around 30m back. However, Qiong Qi had been pushed around 300m back.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing gazed at Yang Ye, “Feeling very satisfied about that?”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Hou Qing asked, “Why did you go head-on against him?”

Yang Ye was quite puzzled, “What do you mean?”

Hou Qing replied, “Now, treat him as a rock.” He gazed at Qiong Qi and continued, “Attack!”

Qiong Qi nodded slightly, leaped up, and slammed his paw at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at Qiong Qi. When Qiong Qi arrived around 10m before him, Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot and stabbed his sword forward.

It just happened to stab against Qiong Qi’s paw.

Boom!

Qiong Qi’s paw wasn’t harmed at all, but an instant later, Qiong Qi was blasted 3km away. At the same time, Qiong Qi’s entire body started to crack open.

Yang Ye was stunned on the spot.
