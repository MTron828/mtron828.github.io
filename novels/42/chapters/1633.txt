Chapter 1634 - Do You Want To Die?

Translator: InVader

Yang Shan’s eyes instantly narrowed slightly when he heard Yang Ye. He was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot.

Yang Shan was slightly stunned, and then he laughed with ridicule, “How laughable!”

As soon as he finished speaking, both of them vanished on the spot.

Once the three of them vanished, the Wu Clan’s Grand Elder appeared here. He glanced off towards the side and said, “Are you not going to show yourself?”

The space there trembled slightly, and then a woman walked out from there. It was Yang Danqing.

Yang Danqing bowed slightly to the Grand Elder, “Senior.”

The Grand Elder spoke indifferently, “Do you need something?”

Yan Danqing grinned slightly and said, “I’d like to inquire about the identity of that person from before… I’ll be extremely grateful if you can tell me who he is.”

The Grand Elder waved his hand, “I don’t know. Leave. My Wu Clan doesn’t want to get mixed up in your Yang Clan’s business.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and vanished on the spot.

Yang Danqing’s face instantly turned cold. She remained silent for a long time before she vanished into the distance.

…

Yang Ye didn’t run towards Martial Origin System, and he went towards the depths of the boundless starry sky instead. He raised his speed to its limits. So, it only took a short while for him to leave Martial Origin System and enter the boundless reaches of space.

Suddenly, Yang Ye stopped, and then Yang Shan and Yang Shi appeared not too far behind him.

“Why aren’t you running anymore?” Yang Shi ridiculed, “Or perhaps you intend to kill us instead?”

Yang Ye turned to look at them, and then he said, “Which one of you will fight me first? Or perhaps you intend to join forces?”

“Join forces?” Yang Shan laughed with ridicule, “Against you?”

He took a step forward while he spoke, and then he stretched out his right hand. A mysterious wave of energy instantly formed a spider web that enveloped down towards Yang Ye.

At this moment, Yang Ye felt like all his paths of retreat had been sealed off!

Yang Ye glanced at Yang Shan. Needless to say, Yang Shan was very strong, and he wasn’t much weaker than the Blood Puppets.

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Ye suddenly slammed his fist forward.

He didn’t use Heaven Obliteration, and it was just a very normal punch.

Bang!

As expected, Yang Ye was blasted away by Yang Shan’s energy. After flying over 3km away, Yang Ye had just stopped when his figure transformed into a shadow that fled off into the distance.

A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of Yang Shan’s mouth, “Ant!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he shot off in pursuit of Yang Ye.

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s fleeing figure vanished on the spot.

“Watch out!” Yang Shi’s astounded voice resounded.

At practically the exact same moment, Yang Shan’s expression changed, and then a shadow appeared behind him. At the same time, two waves of terrifying pressure pressed down upon him!

Hiss!

The tip of a sword pierced through the back of Yang Shan’s head.

Yang Shan’s eyes opened wide, and they were filled with disbelief and a trace of regret. Because he’d just realized that Yang Ye seeming to be utterly weak and fleeing was just an act. Yang Ye had fled to put on a display of weakness, and it was to make him lower his guard, act carelessly, and underestimate Yang Ye!

Yang Ye had succeeded!

“How dare you!” Yang Shi shouted with fury when he witnessed this scene. He was about to attack when his eyes opened wide, and his hairs stood on end. A moment later, a terrifying aura surged out from within him. However, at the same time that his aura surged out, a ray of light had pierced through the back of his head.

Just like Yang Shan, Yang Shi’s figure stiffened on the spot, and Yang Ye was 300m away from him.

“Who are you?!” Suddenly, Yang Danqing walked out from a point in space. She stared at Yang Ye. But there was no intent to kill in her eyes. Conversely, she seemed quite calm. However, her aura was forming layers around her.

Yang Shan had just been killed when she arrived, and right when she was about to attack, Yang Shi had been killed as well.

Two Zenith Realm experts had been killed in an instant!

After all, Yang Shan and Yang Shi weren’t ordinary Zenith Realm experts!

Yang Ye walked towards Yang Danqing with his sword in hand, “Who am I? Why don’t you guess?”

Yang Danqing glanced at the sword in Yang Ye’s grasp and said, “As far as I know, no one besides Eighth Brother uses a sword. But Eighth Brother has no enmity with me and my brother, so he would definitely not…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “How do you know there’s no enmity between us? If I’m not wrong, there’s a debt of blood between us.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Actually, he’d guessed who she was.

Because Yang Xuan told him that Yang Shan and Yang Shi were Yang Yan and Yang Danqing’s subordinates. So, she was clearly Yang Danqing.

“A debt of blood?” Yang Danqing’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Show me your face and let me see if you’re Eighth Brother.”

Yang Danqing had never considered that the person before her was Yang Ye. Or it should be said that many people in the Yang Clan still had no knowledge of Yang Ye. Moreover, she’d merely sent people to kill Yang Ye and hadn’t seen Yang Ye at all. Coupled with the fact that the people she sent told her that Yang Ye was dead, so as far as she was concerned, Yang Ye was dead.

“You’ll find out right away!” As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, his figure vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Yang Danqing when his figure appeared once more. After that, his sword descended upon her.

Yang Danqing’s eyes narrowed slightly. She didn’t collide directly with Yang Ye’s attack. She immediately twisted her right foot on the ground and vanished on the spot. She was almost 10km away when her figure appeared once more.

But as soon as she stopped there, she seemed to have noticed something, and it made her expression change drastically. Because a ray of light had arrived before her.

The Sword of Rebirth!

It only took a moment for Yang Danqing to calm down, and then she swiftly clenched her fist.

Bang!

Three rays of green light surged out from her. One of them shot towards Yang Ye’s attack while the other two shot off in Yang Ye’s direction.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Three explosions resounded as Yang Ye and Yang Danqing both moved over a kilometer backwards.

Yang Danqing glanced at her arms. At this moment, her arms had over a dozen tiny holes on them. She fell silent for an instant before she looked up at Yang Ye, “What a powerful sword technique!”

Yang Ye glanced at his chest. His chest was completely mangled. He looked up and shot a glance at Yang Danqing. Needless to say, she was quite strong indeed. There were two reasons why he hadn’t utilized the Laws of Darkness. Firstly, he wanted to keep her alive because he wanted to gain information about Little Sky’s whereabouts.

If he just asked her like this, he wouldn’t just be unable to gain any information, he would even expose his own identity instead.

As for the second reason, it was because Yang Danqing was in a fully vigilant state. So, he wasn’t 100% confident that using the Laws of Darkness would allow him to kill her.

Actually, there was a third reason, and it was because he wanted to experience the strength of these geniuses from the Yang Clan!

“You aren’t Eighth Brother!” Suddenly, Yang Danqing said, “You want to put the blame on Eighth Brother so that we’ll fight Eighth Brother to the death, and then you can reap the benefits. Right? Do you want to know why I’m sure you aren’t Eighth Brother? It’s because…”

“I’m not interested in listening to your nonsense!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s figure vanished on the spot.

At the instant his figure vanished, a ray of light flashed, and the space in its path was torn open like paper.

Yang Danqing’s eyes narrowed slightly at the sight of this, and the intent to kill flickered in them.

Meanwhile, the sword energy arrived before her.

A ray of green light suddenly shot out of the center of Yang Danqing’s forehead when the sword energy arrived just a few inches away from her forehead.

Bang!

The green light instantly pierced through Yang Ye’s sword energy. The sword energy dispersed immediately, but the green light continued forward towards Yang Ye like a bolt of lightning. Everywhere it passed, space was torn into bits. It was an absolutely shocking sight.

Yang Ye casually stabbed his sword forward.

Bang!

The green light rumbled and dispersed.

A moment later, Yang Ye’s figure vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Yang Danqing when he appeared again.

He sheathed his sword and drew it!

Ten overlapped Heavenrends!

Yang Danqing’s pupils constricted when she noticed the strength of Yang Ye’s attack, and then a ray of green light surged out from within her.

Bang!

A resounding explosion surged through the surroundings, and then a figure was blasted flying. Besides that, an arm flew off into space as well!

It was Yang Danqing’s figure.

At the moment Yang Danqing’s figure was blasted flying, a sword howl had suddenly resounded, and then a ray of light instantly arrived before her.

Suddenly, a glowing finger flashed down from far above.

Bang!

The sword energy was blasted into bits while a figure was blasted flying as well.

It was Yang Ye’s figure.

After flying for almost 3km, Yang Ye finally stopped himself, and then he looked up into space. Meanwhile, a voice suddenly came from high above, “The fight for succession has not begun. Return.”

An expert of the Yang Clan! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly while a ghastly expression filled his eyes.

Yang Danqing wiped off the blood on the corner of her mouth, and then she shot an icy cold glance at Yang Ye, “I’ll repay you tenfold for that arm of mine. You…”

Suddenly, her expression changed drastically. At the same time, a furious shout resounded from high above, “How presumptuous!”

After that, a finger flashed down from above and descended swiftly.

The reason Yang Danqing’s expression had changed drastically was that a figure had suddenly appeared behind her. At the same time, two terrifying intents instantly pressed down upon her. Besides that, there was a mysterious force that was even stronger than those intents.

The intents were naturally slaughter intent and sword intent, and the mysterious force was the Sword Domain.

With those three forces pressing down upon her, she wasn’t just unable to flee, even her profound energy had instantly fallen deathly silent. Of course, all of that only happened for an instant. However, that instant was entirely sufficient for Yang Ye.

A ray of light flashed.

Hiss!

A head flew up into the air.

After he sliced off Yang Danqing’s head, Yang Ye turned around, sheathed his sword, and then drew it.

A beam of sword energy shot forward. The finger which had arrived above him was instantly sliced into two, and then it exploded apart.

“How dare you!” A voice that carried boundless rage descended like a thunderclap from high above, and then an aura pressed down from above.

Yang Ye sheathed his sword!

He held the ancient sheath in his grasp as he shot an icy cold up into space, “Do you want to die?”
