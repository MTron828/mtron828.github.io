Chapter 2016 – In the Top 5!

A young man was standing before Yang Ye. He was a little over 20, wore an embroidered robe, and his long hair was tied up behind his head. Besides that, there was a bright red mark on his forehead. It was the shape of a lotus, and it was gorgeous yet mysterious.

The man was holding a green sword. Its tip looked like the tongue of a snake, and it was pressed against Yang Ye’s forehead.

The man had a cold smile on his face as he gazed at Yang Ye.

He hadn’t noticed that faint golden light was flickering below Yang Ye’s skin.

Yang Ye was about to speak when the man withdrew his sword and moved 300m away.

The man waved his sword about, and rays of light flickered from it. After that, a smile curled up on his lips, “I heard of your name as soon as I arrived in the outside world, and they said that you’re the number one genius of the large universe and the number one sword cultivator too. Now it seems like you don’t deserve your reputation at all!”

The man chuckled at this point, “I know you’ll say that I took you by surprise. That’s fine, I’ll give you another chance. Go on, make your move. Show me the true strength of the number one sword cultivator in the large universe!”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Is there something wrong with you?”

The man was slightly stunned, and then his smile gradually became icy cold, “Now I regret giving you this opportunity.”

He suddenly shook his wrist, and a ray of sword energy instantly arrived before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye flicked his finger and the sword energy instantly vanished.

“Hmm?” Surprise flashed through the young man’s eyes, “Interesting!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stabbed his sword at Yang Ye from afar. It caused the space in front of Yang Ye to explode apart. At the same time, the space in a huge area around Yang Ye cracked open. It had been cracked open by sword energy.

The strength of a single attack was that powerful!

However, the young man frowned again because Yang Ye just stood there and was completely unharmed.

The young man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “Interesting indeed.”

Yang Ye suddenly said, “Let me ask you something before you die. Who sent you?”

The young man chuckled, “Why? You’re afraid?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I just want to pull out weeds by the root!”

“Hahaha!” The young man started laughing, “Yang Ye! Oh, Yang Ye! You’re truly arrogant! Pulling the weeds out by the root? How laughable! Do you know who I am?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he pointed at his left chest, and a small golden character suddenly popped up there: ‘兵’!

The young man smiled, “Now do you know who I am? Yet you want to pull out weeds by the root? Don’t you think that’s laughable?”

The Weapon Path!

Yang Ye hadn’t expected that the young man was from the Weapon Path.

Looks like the Weapon Path has started to pay attention to me.

“The new Seal Master of the Slaughter Line?” The young man chuckled, “You’re quite weak. Why don’t you give the weapon seal to me and live a few more years?”

Yang Ye didn’t say a word. He just slowly lifted his right palm, and then a sword started spinning there.

As his sword spun, a wave of sharp aura appeared here, and the young man’s face gradually turned cold when he sensed the aura.

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s sword vanished.

A sword howl resounded, and then the young man was blasted over 10km away!

The young man looked down at his own sword, and it had cracked apart.

It shattered in his grasp!

Suddenly, he looked up into the distance, and he saw another sword appear on Yang Ye’s palm. It was spinning rapidly while flickering with rays of light.

The young man’s face fell while the solemnness in his eyes grew. It didn’t take long for his profound energy to surge into his green sword, and then numerous sword lotuses appeared around him. More and more were appearing to the point they were like snowflakes that filled his surroundings.

Yang Ye was slightly stunned by this, “Sword Lotus?”

The young man frowned, “You know this technique?”

Yang Ye had quite a weird expression on his face. A moment later, his sword vanished, and the sword lotuses around the young man immediately shot forward at the same time. In just an instant, countless sword lotuses surrounded Yang Ye, and the young man barely dodged Yang Ye’s attack!

The young man hadn’t chosen to defend himself and had chosen to suffer an injury in order to inflict one!

However, just a moment later, shock filled him. Yang Ye’s sword suddenly started moving, and every single swing made a sword lotus fall. In less than a breath of time, the sword lotuses had vanished.

“Impossible…” The young man gazed at Yang Ye with disbelief. Because that was one of his strongest sword techniques!

Yet it had been destroyed just like that!

“The Sword Lotus?” Yang Ye chuckled. He’d seen that technique before, and he’d studied it. So, he knew all its strong points and weak points. Thus, the young man was clearly courting death by using it against him.

“How do you know that technique?!” The young man stared at Yang Ye, “And you even know its weaknesses!”

Yang Ye shrugged, “I guessed!”

The young man was livid when he heard this. However, Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot, and rays of sword energy enveloped the young man.

Close quarter combat!

As soon as he got close to the young man, the latter was instantly suppressed in battle, utterly suppressed. Both his combat instinct and speed were suppressed!

10 breaths of time later.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the young man was blasted away. He flew for over 3km before he finally stopped himself, and Yang Ye was already in front of him.

Yang Ye raised his sword and swung it down! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Bang!

The young man was blasted away once more, and blood sprayed out repeatedly from his mouth.

Yang Ye was about to attack again when he suddenly looked up at the sky. He fell silent for a moment, and then he lowered his sword and looked towards the young man, “I don’t care which line you’re from, but remember that I don’t have time to play with you, so don’t come looking for me again. Otherwise, I’ll kill you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky. However, a ray of light suddenly shot down from the sky, but its target wasn’t the young man, it was a point in space around 30m behind where Yang Ye had been standing a while ago.

Bang!

The space there exploded apart, and a middle aged man walked out from there.

The middle aged man’s palm was injured, and blood was dripping from it!

The young man walked over and spoke softly, “Master Yuan!”

The middle aged man glanced at the injury on his palm and said, “You would be dead if I was just a little later!”

The young man fell silent. If he lost, then he lost. He refused to make excuses because that was despicable.

The middle aged man looked up at the sky. He could still see a faint ray of light in the distance. Since he could see it, he could chase after it. But he didn’t.

A long time passed before he said, “While the Slaughter Line doesn’t have a strong relationship with our line, there’s no enmity between our lines either. So, coming here and seeking him out was no different than causing trouble for our line!”

The young man lowered his head further, “I was wrong!”

The middle aged man said, “The Slaughter Line may seem like it has suffered decline, don’t forget that their Young Martial Uncle is still alive. If he hadn’t gone to the Stellar Battlefield outside the large universe, it would have been impossible for the Prediction Line to annihilate the Slaughter Line. Besides that, if our ancestor hadn’t stopped him after he returned, even if the Prediction Line survived him, it would have probably fallen into utter decline.”

The middle aged man shook his head, “He clearly plans to rebuild the Slaughter Line, and our ancestor is just letting him do it. After all, our ancestor hasn’t fully removed the slaughter line from our Weapon Path. Of course, if our ancestor does that, that Young Martial Uncle of the Slaughter Line will clearly go berserk.”

The young man asked, “Can’t our ancestor keep him under control?”

“Yes!” The middle aged man continued, “But our ancestor can’t be watching him forever, right? Besides our ancestor, can anyone else in our Weapon Path suppress him? Now, he has selected a successor, and he even did so in the Dead Dimension. Obviously, he plans to rebuild the Slaughter Line, and since our ancestor hasn’t done anything about it, it represents that they’ve definitely come to some sort of agreement. So, it’s the Slaughter Line and Prediction Line’s business. We can’t get mixed up in it!”

The young man spoke softly, “I heard that the new Seal Master of the Slaughter Line was a youth, and a sword cultivator. So, I couldn’t stop myself from coming!”

The middle aged man smiled, “Now, have you witnessed his strength?”

The young man nodded, “He’s very strong!”

The middle aged man smiled, “Can someone from the Dead Dimension be weak? I know that you feel some disdain towards the Dead Dimension. You think it’s a place that only geniuses of the outside world go to, and these geniuses of the outside world can’t compare to all of you, right?”

The young man fell silent.

The middle aged man sighed softly, “Kid, according to my knowledge, besides Yang Ye, there are no less than 10 others in the other races who can defeat you with ease. Every single one of them can defeat you with ease. Don’t doubt what I say because the four paths have selected them and are watching them in secret. We’re planning to seize them for ourselves. Besides them, there are some others who are gradually gaining our attention. Every single one of them is an extraordinary genius!”

“Then what about Yang Ye?” The young man asked, “How is he when compared to them?”

The middle aged man glanced at his palm, fell silent for a long time, and then he replied, “He can be ranked in the top 5!”

The top 5!
