Chapter 2315 – Nine Hell Emperor?

Barren land!

An expanse of barren land stood before Yang Ye and Bai Zhixian. The ground before them was completely barren, and there was no end to it in all other directions.

Bai Zhixian glanced at the surroundings, and then a solemn expression gradually appeared in her eyes. The barren land before them hadn’t been created naturally, and it had been created later on. Because energy was fluctuating through it!

Energy fluctuations!

Who could transform such a wide expanse of earth into a barren expanse of earth? Moreover, countless years had passed, yet energy still remained here!

What kind of place was this?

What had happened here in the past?

There were countless questions in Bai Zhixian’s heart.

But she had no answer!

They continued forward, and they walked for around an hour before Yang Ye stopped abruptly. There was a palm-sized fragment before them, and it floated there silently while growing faintly.

Bai Zhixian gazed at Yang Ye while the latter walked toward it.

When they got close to it, they noticed many strange markings on it, and it seemed like the meridians of a person.

Bai Zhixian said, “What is that?”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye put it away.

Bai Zhixian was at a loss for words.

Yang Ye took her hand and continued forward.

Bai Zhixian glanced at Yang Ye. She noticed that he was actually quite charming. Especially his character. While he was quite shameless and cunning at times, he was a true man when he didn’t do things like that. An unyielding man who never cowered!

Reality was cruel. In the beginning, many could remain like that too, but as time passed, they would learn to make compromises, back down, and exercise forbearance. Of course, that didn’t mean it was wrong.

It was another way of dealing with things!

However, Yang Ye didn’t take that path.

They continued forward, hand in hand, through the barren area, and the surroundings were completely quiet.

Eternal Village.

“They didn’t return?” Butcher gazed at the slovenly old man at the village’s entrance, and his face was quite unsightly. After he repulsed the Primal Demon, he’d immediately rushed back to Eternal Village, but he noticed that Yang Ye and Bai Zhixian hadn’t returned!

The middle aged woman, Auntie Vege, was standing by the old man’s side.

The slovenly old man spoke solemnly, “Those kids have probably gone deep into the rear mountains.”

Butcher’s expression changed slightly, and then he went toward the rear mountains.

Auntie Vege suddenly asked, “Where are you going?”

Butcher replied, “Into the rear mountains to look for those two little fellows, of course.”

She shook her head slightly, “It wouldn’t be a problem if it’s just in the outer area, but if you go deep into the rear mountains, and especially if you go to that place, that existence will definitely act against you.”

Butcher replied, “But we can’t just do nothing, right?”

Auntie Vege pondered deeply for a moment and said, “Go to that sly old man and seek his help. I’ll go ask some of the demons in the mountains.”

She vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

Butcher went to the bamboo house, and Wang Erya’s grandfather was organizing some bones near the house.

Butcher walked over to him and said, “It’s very likely that both he and that girl have gone deep into the rear mountains.”

The old man ignored Butcher and continued what he was doing, causing Butcher to frown slightly, “Old man, don’t you care about that kid?”

The old man looked up at Butcher, “Isn’t it all your fault? You don’t have sufficient strength, yet you took them to the rear mountains? Let me tell you now. If anything happens to him, all three of you are in big trouble.”

“What do you mean?” Butcher’s frown deepened, “Does that kid have some sort of prominent background?”

The old man stood up and gazed in the direction of the rear mountains, “The trigrams display great danger.” He clenched his fists slowly as he spoke.

Great danger!

Butcher’s expression changed. The old man wasn’t really reliable most of the time, but his predictions were quite accurate.

Great danger!

Butcher vanished into the distance.

The old man stared in the direction of the rear mountains, and he said, “Nine Hells Emperor, if you kill him, you’ll be digging your own grave!”

At a mountain peak.

Butcher and Auntie Vege stood side by side, and they gazed toward the boundless mountain range.

Auntie Vege spoke solemnly, “They went into that place!”

Butcher spoke softly, “Will they come out alive?”

She shook her head slightly, “I don’t know. They will definitely die if that existence acts against them!”

Butcher fell silent.

…

Deep within the rear mountains, Yang Ye and Bai Zhixian were still traveling incessantly. At this moment, Bai Zhixian was filled with worry. All along the way, it had been too quiet. So quiet that there had been no sound at all! It was very unusual!

As far as she was concerned, returning to the village was the safest. But how would they get back now? Unless they flew. Otherwise, they couldn’t find their way back. However, flying was too dangerous!

In short, they were in a terrible situation. Because she didn’t know what was waiting for them up ahead! This place was absolutely unusual!

Around an hour later, they finally left the barren lands and a grassland was before them. Flowers bloomed all over it, and the spirit energy here was extremely pure.

“What is this place?” A wisp of shock flashed through her eyes, “The spirit energy here is so pure!”

Yang Ye continued forward with Bai Zhixian. All along the way, Bai Zhixian was almost unable to stop herself from sitting down cross-legged and absorbing the spirit energy here. She had a feeling that if she cultivated here, it wouldn’t take long for her to attain the True Void Realm!

The spirit energy here was quite special!

However, Yang Ye led her forward. While she sensed that Yang Ye’s actions were quite strange, she still didn’t resist and just let him take her forward.

Just like that, a long time passed before Yang Ye and her stopped.

There was a cliff before them, and a woman in a pure white dress was seated by its edge. Her legs were dangling down the cliff, and she had her back to them.

A living person!

Bai Zhixian became vigilant. Or to be more precise, it was a living being because Bai Zhixian wasn’t very sure if the woman was human.

Bai Zhixian asked softly, “Senior?”

The woman suddenly said, “Sit!”

Her voice was beautiful like the singing of orioles.

As soon as she said that, a pure white bench appeared behind Yang Ye and Bai Zhixian. If one looked carefully, one would notice that it had been formed with spirit energy.

Bai Zhixian glanced at her, and then she led Yang Ye over to sit down.

The woman suddenly asked, “What is his name?”

Bai Zhixian was slightly stunned, “Who?”

The woman said, “The person beside you!”

Bai Zhixian hesitated for a moment and replied, “Yang Ye!”

“Yang Ye…” The woman spoke softly, “I still don’t really believe it.”

She stood up slowly, and then she walked over to Yang Ye.

Even if they were this close, Bai Zhixian noticed that she still couldn’t see the woman’s appearance! Suddenly, the woman placed her hands on Yang Ye’s shoulder, and then Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly. He was about to attack, but the madness intent within him was suppressed by a wave of mysterious energy before it could even leave his body.

As for Yang Ye himself, he was frozen on the spot.

Bai Zhixian watched with astonishment as she bent down and pressed her forehead against Yang Ye’s forehead.

The Sword Ruins.

A tiny white figure was ceaselessly flashing through the Sword Ruins. If one looked carefully, one would notice that the white little fellow had a ray of sword energy beneath her feet. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

It was Snowy, of course.

Training in the sword!

Since Yang Ye left, Snowy had been training madly every single day!

No one could stop her!

She wanted to become strong and go look for Yang Ye!

It was what Su Qingshi had told her!

Suddenly, Snowy stopped and looked up into the sky. There was a trace of bewilderment in her bright eyes.

Bang!

A moment of silence ensued, and then the sky shook violently before an ethereal face appeared there.

It was the face of a woman.

Snowy’s eyes opened wide when she saw this face, and then an ethereal axe appeared in her little paw while vigilance covered her face!

But just a moment later, Snowy sniffed lightly, and then the vigilance in her eyes turned to curiosity. A short while later, she put the axe away and floated to the face. At this moment, they were very close to each other!

The woman gazed at Snowy’s eyes, and then she grinned when she noticed the strand of dark purple in them. After that, she vanished slowly.

Snowy was stunned, and then she clawed lightly at where the face had been. She wanted to make the woman stay, but she grabbed nothing.

Snowy looked down slightly and seemed slightly depressed.

Quite a while passed before she shook her little head, and then she sneaked a glance at the surroundings before patting the Sword Gourd.

Swish!

A ray of sword energy shot into the sky.

When it was about to leave the Sword Ruins, a ray of purple light appeared before it, causing it to stop. Snowy was within the sword energy, and Zi’er was in front of her.

Zi’er walked over to Snowy, took Snowy in her arms, and spoke softly, “Don’t sneak off again, alright?”

Snowy looked up at Zi’er and started waving her paws swiftly, and tears surged out of her eyes as she did so.

She missed Yang Ye and wanted to go looking for him!

That was what Snowy was telling her!

Zi’er rubbed Snowy’s head gently, “H-He will be back for us. He will, he definitely will!”

She looked up at the sky, and then her gaze became slightly blurry.

Eternal Secret Realm.

The woman released Yang Ye’s shoulders and returned to where she’d been sitting.

Bai Zhixian gazed at the woman, “Senior?”

The woman said nothing in response.

Just like that, a long time passed before she suddenly spoke, “I never expected her to really choose a human. Perhaps it is the will of the heavens, and your arrival here is the will of the heavens too.”

Suddenly, Yang Ye stood up, and then Bai Zhixian watched in shock as he walked slowly to the woman. After that, he placed his palm on her head and rubbed it gently, “S-Snowy…”

Bai Zhixian was stunned on the spot.
