Chapter 2812 – The Dao is Natural!

It wasn’t her main body and was just a clone!

Even then, the woman in white and Tu didn’t dare to act carelessly.

However, she didn’t attack.

It was meaningless to do so!

The woman in a plain dress ignored them. She gazed at Yang Ye and the woman in black, “You’ve overlooked something.”

Tu replied indifferently, “Please do tell us what it is!”

The woman in a plain dress smiled, “Her strength is growing strong because of him. She’s using his strength to suppress him, and that strength doesn’t belong to her. In short, she’s only that strong because Yang Ye is that strong. Once he realizes that, she will lose.”

Using another’s strength!Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The woman in white and Tu gazed at Yang Ye and the woman in black.

Just as the woman in a plain dress had said, she’d been using Yang Ye’s strength and the special characteristics of the Great Unknown. She was using Yang Ye’s own strength against him! It could be said that Yang Ye wasn’t being suppressed by the woman in black, he was being suppressed by himself!

Meanwhile, the woman in black suddenly appeared behind Yang Ye after being pushed back, and her attack was even stronger than before!

Yang Ye turned around, but this time, he didn’t attack. At the instant Great Unknown arrived before him, he raised his sword before his chest.

The sword descended!

Bang!

Yang Ye was pushed over 1km away, and just as before, the woman in black appeared behind him again. Yang Ye didn’t counterattack again and still just defended himself!

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted back once more!

However, this attack of hers was weaker than before.

After around 10 more collisions like this, her attacks were many times weaker than before, and she couldn’t pose a threat to Yang Ye at all!

Around 10 minutes later, the woman in black stopped. It was because she wasn’t able to pose a threat to Yang Ye anymore.

She glanced at Yang Ye, “Do you understand now?”

Yang Ye nodded, “A little.”

She walked over to Yang Ye and looked him in the eyes, “Your Sword Dao focuses on slaughter and offense. It cannot be described as being unmatched in those aspects, but it’s definitely rare for someone to be a match for you in those aspects. However, you must realize that the Sword Dao doesn’t encompass those two aspects, and there is defense and balance too. Just slaughtering and going on the offense alone may be powerful, but it’s too extreme. This level of extremity would make you stronger at most times, but it may drag you into a hopeless situation too. You must be able to attack and defend!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Thank you for the guidance.”

He was speaking sincerely. His spar with her had allowed him to realize that the Sword Dao was more than just offensive, it was defensive too. A combination of offense and defense, that was the Grand Dao. Just like when facing some issues in life, taking a step back may change everything.

The Sword Dao and life weren’t very different.

In the past, he only knew how to advance forward, not retreat. Actually, retreat didn’t represent cowardice and abandonment at most times. A step back today was taken so that 10 steps forward could be taken in the future. Just like the previous battle, he’d taken a step back, and so her attacks weakened. In the end, her attacks couldn’t pose a threat to him anymore.

Simply speaking, an expert should know how to charge forward, but must be able to retreat as well.

A short while later, Yang Ye took a deep breath and looked at the sky with a smile on his face.

His mind was clear!

It was an extremely nice feeling!

As if he’d sensed something, Yang Ye looked to the side, and a woman in a plain dress was standing there!

The strongest form of Destiny!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly.

What is she doing here?

She grinned, “Are you surprised?”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “You’re speaking so nicely that it makes it feel like we’re good friends.”

She shook her head, “I’ve never considered you an enemy, nor do I consider anyone to be my enemy!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What do you mean?”

She smiled, “At most times, everything in this world is just a difference of opinion or standpoint.”

Yang Ye nodded, “That is true. If I’m being honest, when we’re standing beside you, it seems like we’re the bad people and you’re the good one!”

She shook her head, “You’ve missed the point. Both the good and bad just follow their hearts. Moreover, how can there be good people without bad people? The good and bad are both people, and both are equal!”

Yang Ye gave her a thumbs up. Her thoughts were beyond the minds of the ordinary!

She grinned, “Go on and continue. I’m just here to watch. Perhaps I can even offer some guidance!”

Yang Ye glanced at her, “My objective is to kill you!”

She chuckled, “Are you afraid that your enemy will be strong?”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. Her words were quite a blow to the heart, and the slightest mistake may cause his mental state to collapse!

She continued, “Never fear a strong enemy, for the stronger an enemy is, the better a stepping stone that enemy would be!”

Yang Ye fell silent. Even though it wasn’t very nice to hear, she had the right to say that.

The woman in black suddenly said, “Then let’s allow her to watch and give out some guidance!”

The woman in white nodded slightly, and then she floated over to Yang Ye and looked him in the eyes, “Just stay true to yourself!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course.”

Just a few words from her couldn’t make his mental state collapse! He wasn’t that weak!

The woman in white nodded slightly, “Watch out.”

As soon as she said that, a sword appeared in her grasp, and then a ray of sword energy slashed at Yang Ye. It was like a surging waterfall that instantly enveloped Yang Ye!

Yang Ye couldn’t dodge it at all. All he could do was go head-on against it!

And that was exactly what she wanted!

Yang Ye’s sword slashed down from above without encountering any resistance. It sliced through the sword energy, but what awaited him was a sword that shot over like a bolt of lightning!

The sword accurately stabbed against the blade of his sword, causing the Sword Precursor to tremble violently while Yang Ye’s entire arm turned numb! He was shocked by this because her strength was actually so great!

Yang Ye was pushed backward repeatedly.

At the same time, the woman in white floated forward, and then countless rays of sword energy surged down upon Yang Ye like a rainstorm.

If the woman in black had used technique against him, then the woman in white was fighting him with sword energy!

Yang Ye waved his sword rapidly, and every swing would slice apart some sword energy. However, it seemed like there was no end to the sword energy!

Yang Ye was being pushed back repeatedly. At this moment, he was being completely suppressed!

Meanwhile, Tu and the woman in black were staring at Yang Ye and the woman in white.

Suddenly, the woman in black gazed at the woman in a plain dress, “Aren’t you going to say something?”

She smiled, “Say what?”

The woman in black replied indifferently, “What do you think?”

The woman in a plain dress shook her head, “Both of them are weak!”

The woman in black frowned slightly, “Why?”

The woman in a plain dress tapped her finger forward, and a strand of sword energy appeared there. She gazed at the woman in black, “It isn’t quantity but quality, purity, and mentality that makes sword energy strong. She has overlooked all of that, and that means she has overlooked its essence. Of course, it looks very beautiful. Unfortunately, it’s not very useful.”

The woman in black asked, “What about him?”

The woman in a plain dress shook her head, “He isn’t weak, he’s stupid.”

The woman in black was stunned speechless.

The woman in a plain dress explained, “During his last battle with you, he learned that defense can be a good offense, and it perfected his Sword Dao a little more. Yet now that he is facing a new enemy, he has overlooked his ability in offense! Comprehending the Dao? Why must it be done intentionally?”

She shook her head slightly, “When many things are done intentionally in this world, they lose a little something. The Dao is natural. It is the clear flow of the heart, and the clarity of the mind. Just like how in the current world, many men choose to be with a woman for her looks, and women choose to be with a man for his appearance and wealth. It isn’t love but need.”

The woman in black shook her head, “I don’t think that’s wrong! Everyone likes good things. It’s normal for a man to love a beautiful girl, and it’s normal for a girl to love a strong man.”

The woman in a plain dress chuckled. She pointed at Yang Ye and said, “Would all of you choose him if he was a useless piece of trash?”

The woman in black frowned.

The woman in a plain dress gazed at her, “If a man is only fond of a woman’s appearance, the woman will be abandoned once he gets tired of her. Similarly, if a woman is only fond of a man’s wealth, the man will be abandoned once he goes bankrupt. They are needs, mental and physical needs, not love. Life is like the Sword Dao. At most times, a person cultivates the sword because it is necessary. The sword can bring that person dignity, a future, and strength. Just like him, the sword can help him protect his loved ones, so he cultivated the sword. However, none of them have considered what the essence of the sword is.”

She chuckled, “Do all of you really like the sword?”

The woman in a plain dress looked into the distance, “Needs are intentional, and when it’s intentional, it usually loses the intentions and trueness that was present in the beginning. At this moment, he’s intentionally seeking to comprehend the Dao, and so he has lost both of that. There is nothing left to see.”

She turned around and walked away.

The woman in black and Tu’s faces fell, and there was actually a trace of bewilderment in their eyes!

Suddenly, an explosion resounded in the distance. The expanse of sword energy created by the woman in white had exploded apart, and she was blasted away!

After he repulsed her, Yang Ye didn’t follow up with another attack, and he looked at the woman in a plain dress instead, “You’re mistaken!”

She stopped and gazed at Yang Ye with a smile on her face, “Go on!”

Yang Ye walked over to her and looked her in the eyes, “You’re just generalizing. Doing something intentionally doesn’t make one lose their original intentions. It’s a form of learning and improvement. What has humanity relied on to get where it is right now? Learning! No one was born knowing everything, and the answer to every question starts by learning. Intentionally learning isn’t wrong. Just like me, I’m lacking something, so is it wrong to learn from her?”

The woman in a plain dress grinned, “Go on!”

Yang Ye continued, “The Dao is natural and immaterial, it is born of this world; it is emotionless, and it makes the world spin; it is nameless and fosters all things…. It is the Grand Dao, but why must the Grand Dao be used when speaking about people? If people do not learn and allow nature to take its course, what would happen then…?”

Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically at this point, and he gazed at her with astonishment, “Y-You’ve…”
