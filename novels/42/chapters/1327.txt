Chapter 1328 – Above The Voider Realm?

He got it? Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he sped up. It didn’t take long for him to follow Mo Xiaoleng to the bottom of a chasm, and he saw the Demon Empress and the others there.

At this moment, only 6 of the Voider Realm demon beasts on the Demon Empress’ side remained. As for the Nie Clan, only 3 of its Voiders remained. Moreover, besides the grey robed old man who led the group, the other 2 of those Voiders had ghastly pale countenances while blood was seeping all over their bodies. Obviously, they’d suffered extremely heavy injuries.

But Yang Ye was quite surprised because besides those 3 Voiders, the Nie Clan had a Voider Realm demon beast on its side. That Voider Realm demon beast stood very close to the Nie Clan’s forces. Moreover, based on its expression, it seemed to not be hostile towards the Nie Clan, and it was hostile towards the Demon Empress’ side instead.

What’s going on? Yang Ye was absolutely puzzled.

He looked at the grey robed old man. The grey robed old man was holding a lotus shaped fruit. The fruit was violet gold in color, and it emanated faint violet light. Its top had a hole and threads of violet energy was seeping out incessantly from there. This caused an area of 3km around it to be filled with a refreshing fragrance.

Just a whiff of it refreshed and relaxed the mind and heart, and it made one feel indescribably comfortable.

It isn’t ordinary! Yang Ye’s heart shook. The fruit was definitely much better than the fruits that Mo Xiaoleng had given to Snowy.

But can it really help someone breakthrough and advance above the Voider Realm?

Yang Ye gazed at the Demon Empress.

The Demon Empress’ face was icy cold, and the hands she kept behind her back were clenched tightly. She seemed to be calm, but she felt extremely dangerous.

The grey robed old man looked up at the Demon Empress while a trace of ridicule appeared on the corners of his mouth, “Demon Empress, you thought everything was within your control, but you were wrong. Everything was within my control.”

“Nie Wuming! You really have surprised me.” The Demon Empress continued, “I never expected you to even be able to buy over a Voider Realm demon beast.”

The grey robed old man called Nie Wuming laughed coldly, “Didn’t you do the same? You have people in my Nie Clan as well. But all of that is meaningless now. Demon Empress, we’ll meet again soon!”

He was about to leave once he finished speaking, but he suddenly frowned and looked where Yang Ye was, “You’re that fellow, Yang Ye, right? Not bad, you really are the most monstrous genius on the continent after Jian Wuji. The Voiders of my Nie Clan that died at your hands didn’t suffer unjust deaths. I didn’t have the time to deal with you earlier, and I naturally have no time now. But I’ll have time in the future. Just you wait.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Nie Wuming’s figure vanished on the spot along with the other 2 human Voiders and that Voider Realm demon beast.

Mo Xiaoleng was about to attack, but the Demon Empress stopped Mo Xiaoleng and shook her head, “It’s too late.”

Mo Xiaoleng’s face became cold, “Was that the Wolf Clan’s patriarch?”

The Demon Empress nodded, “I never expected him to defect.”

Mo Xiaoleng spoke coldly, “He wasn’t satisfied that you took control of the demon race, so it’s very normal that he defected now. I told you to kill him, but you refused to listen. You have the ability, but you’re not ruthless enough.”

The Demon Empress said, “My husband once treated him like a brother. If my husband was still alive, he would definitely not let me kill him.”

Mo Xiaoleng spoke coldly, “Unnecessary kindness!”

The Demon Empress chuckled, “I never expected him to join forces with Nie Wuming.”

Mo Xiaoleng replied, “If that old bastard really breaks through and rises above the Voider Realm, then what do you think would happen to the demon race? It would be completely slaughtered by him.”

As she spoke, she pointed at Yang Ye and said, “Even though I really want to kill him, he has something that I really admire. He’s absolutely decisive, and he will definitely not show any mercy to those who deserve death. Not to mention a lousy place like this continent, a person like him would even be able to make a place for himself in the large world.”

The Demon Empress stretched out her hand and rubbed Mo Xiaoleng’s head as she smiled, “Don’t be angry. Since the mistake has been made, all we can do is mend the mistake. Fortunately, it isn’t too late.”

As she spoke, she turned to look at one of the Voider Realm demon beasts, “Give the order to kill anyone related to the patriarch of the Wolf Clan. If anyone in the Wolf Clan dares to resist, then kill them as well. Once you’ve killed them, hang their heads on the city gates so that the patriarch of the Wolf Clan can take a look in the future.”

“Yes!” That Voider Realm demon beast bowed slightly to her, and then he turned around and left.

Meanwhile, the Demon Empress turned to look where Yang Ye was standing, “Since you’re here, then why hide yourself?”

A moment of silence ensued, and then the space in the distance rippled before Yang Ye stepped out of it.

Yang Ye asked, “Does that fellow, Nie Wuming, really have a chance to advance from the Voider Realm?”

“He only has a chance!” The Demon Empress explained, “That Divine Spirit Fruit was nurtured by the violet energy of a large world, and it contains extremely pure energy. Once it ripens and is consumed, it’s very likely that he will advance from the Voider Realm if his luck is good. Of course, even if he fails to advance, it will definitely provide a huge boost in strength.”

Yang Ye asked, “That fruit hasn’t ripened yet?”

The Demon Empress nodded. Yang Ye instantly heaved a sigh of relief. After all, he’d killed so many from the Nie Clan. If Nie Wuming advanced right away, then he might be the first that Nie Wuming seeks out. At this moment, Nie Wuming’s strength was already extremely terrifying. Once Nie Wuming attained an advancement in his cultivation, Yang Ye would probably need the Sword Spirit or Qiong Qi’s help to fight Nie Wuming.

Fortunately, the fruit wasn’t ripe yet, so Nie Wuming wouldn’t be looking for trouble with him for some time.

Suddenly, the Demon Empress said, “That fruit will fully ripen in half a month from now.”

Yang Ye’s face froze, and then a short while passed before he laughed bitterly. The fruit would ripen in half a month. In other words, only had a little more than that amount of time before Nie Wuming would come looking for him.

I really don’t have much time!

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s expression changed. He gazed at the Demon Empress while vigilance appeared on his face. Because the Demon Empress’ divine sense had locked onto him.

“Now that Heaven Pillar Peak is gone, the humans throughout the Veiled Region shall die.” The Demon Empress gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “It’s the same for Dark Hell Continent.”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Demon Empress, the demon race has annihilated the Nie Clan and the human race of the Veiled Region that offended your demon race. Isn’t that enough? Dark Hell Continent is just a barren place, and it’s completely useless to the demon race, right?” He naturally didn’t want to go to war with the demon race, because doing so wasn’t beneficial at all. Not only would lives be lost, it would waste a huge amount of time. The thing he lacked the most right now was time.

However, the Demon Empress shook her head and said, “The continent needs only the demon race.”

Yang Ye’s face fell. Meanwhile, the Demon Empress added, “Yang Ye, you’re a genius. If you’re willing to surrender with your Sword Alliance and obey my commands, then I can allow you to live. Otherwise....”

“You’ll annihilate us, right?” Yang Ye interrupted her and laughed coldly, “Demon Empress, I can tell you frankly that my Sword Alliance will definitely not surrender. If your demon race really intends to attack Dark Hell Continent, then my Sword Alliance will accompany you in battle until the end.”

The Demon Empress gazed at Yang Ye for a short while and nodded, “I expected that.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she waved her right hand, and then the 5 Voider Realm demon beasts behind her immediately shot towards Yang Ye. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The Demon Empress was very well aware that the Sword Alliance was nothing to worry about, and the truly terrifying one was Yang Ye. So long as he was there, the entire Sword Alliance would converge together, and it would become an extremely difficult enemy to conquer while under Yang Ye’s lead. So, she’d chosen to attack right here and now. Because once Yang Ye was killed, the demon race’s army could crush Dark Hell Continent and the Sword Alliance.

Yang Ye’s face fell when he saw 5 Voiders charge at him. Obviously, he understood the Demon Empress’ intentions. She wanted to kill him right here and now. So, Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to flap the wings on his back and flee. What a joke! There were 7 Voiders here, and the Demon Empress and Mo Xiaoleng were no ordinary Voiders. So, how could he possibly defeat them?

Fleeing was the right choice!

Fortunately, his speed was swift enough. When Blink was combined with his Sword Control Technique and Spatial Laws, Yang Ye instantly appeared a few thousand kilometers away. But his expression changed when he was about to utilize the Sword Domain to conceal himself. Because a person had suddenly appeared out of thin air before him, and it was the Demon Empress!

Her speed was even swifter than his!

The Demon Empress didn’t speak. She just pointed her finger forward. In an instant, everything around Yang Ye seemed to freeze.

The Laws of Time!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he hurriedly activated the Sword Domain. As soon as it appeared, the energy that frozen the area around him instantly vanished, and then Yang Ye’s figure vanished on the spot. He hadn’t attacked because the young woman and those other 5 Voiders were behind him.

“The Sword Domain!” The Demon Empress frowned slightly, and then she vanished on the spot.

A few thousand kilometers away, Yang Ye stopped once more because the Demon Empress had appeared in front of him again. This time, she didn’t utilize the Laws of Time, and she just slapped her right palm at him. A wave of powerful force swept forward, and space collapsed in its wake.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He sheathed Heaven’s Gravestone within the ancient sheath, and then he drew it.

Om!

A beam of sword energy shot out of the ancient sheath.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded in front of Yang Ye, and then Yang Ye watched with astonishment as the Demon Empress’ attack actually blasted his sword energy into pieces! Yang Ye didn’t have the time to think because the wave of force had arrived in front of him. He immediately put his sword away, clenched his right fist rightly, and then slammed it forward.

The Brink Laws!

A wave of energy swept forward and collided with the wave of force that the Demon Empress had created.

Bang!

The space around the point of collision collapsed in an instant while the force of the collision blasted Yang Ye 3km back.

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth while a solemn expression filled his eyes. The Demon Empress is truly strong! She’s countless times stronger than that fellow, Nie Hun!

Meanwhile, the 5 Voiders of the demon race and the young woman appeared around Yang Ye, and they completely surrounded him.

Yang Ye’s face instantly fell.

The Demon Empress started walking towards him, and every single step she took caused space to tremble violently as if it couldn’t endure her strength.
