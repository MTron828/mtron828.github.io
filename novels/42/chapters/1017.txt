Chapter 1018 – You’ll Regret It Forever!

The group of savages howled in unison as they dashed forward, and even the ground trembled in their wake.

Should I fight or flee? Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he didn’t hesitate to carry the woman and flee.

What a joke! Even though those savages couldn’t execute techniques like normal human Saints, their bodies were comparable to Saint Realm experts.

Fight over 100 people who were equals to Saints?

There was nothing wrong with Yang Ye’s head, so he naturally wouldn’t do something so stupid!

He’d wanted to interrogate the dying savage, but now it would seem like he had no choice but to give up because keeping himself alive was the most important matter at hand!

The other savages immediately started roaring when they saw the miserable state their companion was in, and then they chased after Yang Ye like madmen!

Yang Ye dashed madly all along the way, and the corners of his mouth couldn’t help but twitch when he noticed that they seemed to have no intention to let him go. If he was in the outside world, then he could enhance his speed with the Laws of Speed, so they wouldn’t be able to catch up to him no matter what. Yet now, he could only utilize his physical strength, so his speed depended solely on his physical strength. However, he was exhausted and hadn’t recovered from the battle he had with the other savage just now. Thus, the gap between him and the group of savages was gradually getting closer.

Yang Ye gazed at the woman in his arms, “Do you have any ideas?”

She said, “Either flee or kill them!”

Yang Ye replied angrily, “That doesn’t help at all!”

She just glanced at him and didn’t speak another word.

Yang Ye took a deep breath and said, “You’re definitely no ordinary person. Or perhaps I should say that you’re definitely extremely strong. I’m sure you’ve realized that we’ll definitely die if they catch up to us. If you have a way to escape them or some sort of trump card, then use it, alright?”

The woman replied, “Just summon that tiny pagoda of yours. Not to mention those savages, it can even destroy this world!”

The Primordial Pagoda!

Yang Ye laughed bitterly and shook his head. He’d tried to call out to the Primordial Pagoda when he noticed that he couldn’t utilize his profound energy, but it didn’t respond at all! There were many times that Yang Ye couldn’t avoid thinking about whether he or the Primordial Pagoda was the true master in their relationship.

The woman spoke abruptly, “You can’t truly control it!”

Yang Ye glanced at her and nodded.

“Right!” She spoke softly, “You’re so weak, so how could you possibly take control of such a divine treasure!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened, “You’re still alive and haven’t suffered at the hands of those savages because of me, the weak person you’re speaking about!”

The woman spoke indifferently, “It isn’t terrifying to be weak, nor is it humiliating. One should be afraid of being ignorant of one’s weakness. That’s the most shameful thing for a person!”

“I think we should talk about how we’re going to survive this situation!” Yang Ye turned his head and glanced behind him. At this moment, the savages were just around 1 kilometer away from them. If this continued, then it would take less than an hour for the savages to catch up to them.

She replied, “Leave me here. That’ll be able to buy you some time!”

Yang Ye glanced at her, “Are you testing me?”

She answered, “You’ve obtained the Fruit of Creation, so I’m useless to you now. Not only am I of no worth to you, I’m also a burden to you, right?”

Yang Ye replied, “You seem to really wish for me to leave you here!”

She looked him in the eyes and said, “You’re clearly still taking me with you because you hope to gain a way to escape from me, or perhaps you think that I’ve concealed my strength or possess some sort of shocking trump card. I can tell you frankly that I’ve told you all the ways to escape. Besides that, I know no other way. As for my strength or trump cards, I don’t have that as well. At the very least, I don’t have it while I’m here. So, I’m useless to you now.”

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time before he said, “You’re very vigilant towards me, or perhaps I can even say that you’re hostile towards me. I don’t know why, but all I want to say is that perhaps working together sincerely is the best for us right now. At the very least, we should be a little more sincere to each other while we’re here, right?”

She gazed at him for a long time before she said, “I don’t have a way to get out of this situation!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath when he heard her, and then he nodded, “Since you can’t do anything, then we’ll do it my way!”

Yang Ye stopped running when he spoke up to this point, and then he placed her on his back before he started walking towards the savages.

She asked, “What are you doing?”

“I’m going to fight them on my own!” Yang Ye slowly clenched his fists while a ferocious expression appeared on his face. He was injured, so even if he continued fleeing, it was only a matter of time before the savages caught up. Since it was impossible to avoid battle, he chose to take the initiative!

She asked, “Are you sure?”

“I’m very sure!” Yang Ye roared furiously as a powerful aura surged out from within him, and then beams of crystal blue light shot down from the sky and entered his body. After the beams of light entered his body, a thin barrier of crystal blue light formed around them and stuck closely to them like a layer of skin.

After he arrived in this world, he’d noticed that while he couldn’t utilize any profound energy here, he could utilize Stellar Energy! Moreover, he’d just happened to have cultivated stellar energy. That was also why he’d dared to stop and fight the savages!

“Stellar energy!” A wisp of shock could be seen in the woman’s eyes as she gazed at the thin film of crystal blue on her body.

Yang Ye’s face started to warp at the instant the stellar energy entered his body, and once it left his body and formed a protective barrier around him, his entire face had completely warped to the point it was almost unrecognizable.

There would be no side effects when he utilized stellar energy when he had his violet profound energy to assist him. But now, he couldn’t utilize his violet profound energy, so he suffered the backlash that came with utilizing stellar energy. Such backlash was clearly extremely painful because the stellar energy’s presence within him was equivalent to a corrosive force that was corroding his internal organs and entire body!

It couldn’t be helped. He had no other choice at a time like this!

The extreme pain he suffered caused Yang Ye’s consciousness to be almost completely blurred. At this moment, he just wanted to vent. Because only venting would allow the pain throughout his body to lessen!

“AH!!!” Yang Ye roared with fury as he charged towards the savages with the woman on his back.

One of the savages stabbed his pike against Yang Ye’s chest. However, he was shocked to notice that Yang Ye was completely fine, but his pike was transformed into powder instead. At the same time, the remaining force of the collision blasted him a few dozen steps back!

All the other savages were stunned by this scene!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly charged over to the closest savage, and he smashed his fist in that man’s direction. The man was shocked and similarly launched a punch at Yang Ye. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Bang!

Their fists collided, and the savage was pushed almost 100 steps back. As for Yang Ye, he hadn’t taken a single step back! That savage was astounded by this scene.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had appeared before the man, and he slammed his fist against the man’s head.

Bang!

The man’s head was instantly deformed, and his figure was blasted flying!

“Roar!” Countless other savages roared with fury, and they started attacking madly. Unfortunately, their pikes and fists weren’t able to cause even the slightest harm to Yang Ye. It was even to the extent that they were injured by the rebounded force that shot towards them when their fists and pikes struck against Yang Ye. However, every single punch from Yang Ye either injured or killed one of them!

Yang Ye grew stronger as the battle progressed. At this moment, he’d fully disregarded his defenses because he couldn’t sense any pain. Regardless of how many pikes or fists struck him, he didn’t feel anything. Moreover, he didn’t feel anything when his fists slammed against the savages as well. At this moment, it was like he’d lost the ability to feel anything!

To be more precise, he was in an invincible state! At the very least, physical strength wasn’t able to cause any material harm to him!

Just a little while after the battle began, over a dozen savages were lying on the ground!

It didn’t take long for fear to gradually appear in the eyes of some savages. Because Yang Ye was clearly like a monster to them.

“Roar!” One of the savages suddenly roared, and then he turned around and fled. As for the others by his side, they immediately turned around and fled as well.

They naturally didn’t dare to continue fighting when facing a practically invincible person.

However, Yang Ye clearly had no intention to let them go!

Yang Ye caught up to one of them, and then he slammed his fist against the man’s back. The man was blasted flying and crashed against the ground. However, the savage wasn’t dead because his body was strong, but while he wasn’t dead, he’d suffered extremely serious injuries. He was just about to stand up when Yang Ye suddenly appeared in front of him, and Yang Ye’s foot stomped down on his stomach before Yang Ye’s fist slammed against his head!

Bang!

The savage’s head was instantly smashed into a strange shape, and then Yang Ye’s fist slammed down on his head again!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

In an instant, Yang Ye had slammed his fist countless times against the savage’s head, and he’d done it to the point that savage’s head was smashed into pieces. Only then did Yang Ye stop and chase the next savage!

He was venting!

The bone-deep pain throughout his body caused only a single thought to be left in Yang Ye’s mind, and it was to vent! Vent like a madman!

After he killed a few more savages, Yang Ye gradually slowed down. Meanwhile, the rest of the savages were nowhere to be seen.

However, the sharp pain which came from the stellar energy hadn’t vanished, and it was even growing stronger because he’d overused his physical strength.

He needed to vent!

He needed to vent without end!

Suddenly, Yang Ye pulled the woman off his back and tossed her on the ground. There was no clarity left in his eyes as he gazed at her, and there was only lust that remained in them.

The woman’s beautiful brows were pressed slightly together when she saw Yang Ye in such a state, and she said, “You’ll regret it forever if you dare to do that!”

“Roar!” Yang Ye suddenly roared, and then his figure flashed over onto the woman. He pulled open her robe, and there was nothing under it!
