Chapter 1209 – I’m Not Afraid!

Crush the World Devastator Cult first?

Dugu Tianwei and the beautiful woman’s expressions changed upon hearing Yang Ye.

A short while passed before she gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Are you sure that you’re not joking?”

Yang Ye replied, “That’s what I think, and it’s what I plan to do!”

She gazed at him for a long time before she said, “The World Devastator Cult’s true strength has always been a mystery. Because no power or person has ever been able to make them become truly serious. If I’m to be honest, then not to mention you, even the joint forces of your Sword Alliance, the 2 cities, and the 2 sects might not be able to harm them.”

“Nothing is impossible!” Yang Ye continued, “Allow me to say one final thing. The World Devastator Cult is a power that seeks hegemony. Those who obey live; those who disobey die. If you try to avoid whirlpool, then it’ll only result in your Violet Thistle City offending both sides.”

The beautiful woman looked Yang Ye in the eyes and said, “But I don’t think your Sword Alliance has any hope!”

“He’s Senior Jian Wuji’s successor!” Suddenly, a voice resounded from outside the hall. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The 3 of them looked up and saw an old man walking in. It was Jian Xu.

“Senior Jian Xu?” Dugu Tianwei and the beautiful woman hurriedly went over to greet him, and they bowed slightly to him with a rather respectful expression on their faces.

Yang Ye gazed at Jian Xu while a trace of surprise flashed through his eyes. Meanwhile, Jian XU glanced at Yang Ye and said, “I just happened to pass by when they were being pursued by enemies many years ago, and I helped them. Right, I was the one who left behind those inheritances in the Sword Dao to Dugu Jian and Xiao Yun.”

Yang Ye nodded, “So that’s why!”

Meanwhile, the beautiful woman suddenly asked, “Senior Jian Xu, you said that he’s Senior Jian Wuji’s successor?”

Jian Xu glanced at her and said, “Have you not sensed it? His sword intent is above the Void Rank.” He gazed at Yang Ye while he finished speaking.

Yang Ye nodded slightly. A moment later, a strand of terrifying sword intent appeared within the hall. As soon as it appeared, Dugu Tianwei, the beautiful woman, and even Jian Xu’s expressions changed slightly. After all, Jian Xu was a sword cultivator, and it was the most suppressive and restrictive to him.

It didn’t take long for the sword intent to vanish.

As soon as it did, the 3 of them instantly heaved sighs of relief in their heart. After all, Rebirth Realm sword intent was something that could completely suppress the auras of Emperors.

The beautiful woman glanced at Yang Ye while a trace of complicated emotions could be seen in her eyes, “There were rumors that your sword intent had surpassed the Void Rank, but I never expected it to be true. No wonder Jian’er acknowledged you as his big brother. You’re probably the number one sword cultivator on this continent right now!”

Meanwhile, Jian Xu said, “Tianwei, Little Girl Xiao, I’m not here to persuade you to join forces with the Sword Alliance. Because I know that the Sword Alliance’s strength is really incapable of going against the World Devastator Cult. But....” He pointed at Yang Ye before he pointed, “I think that you should think about the Sword Alliance, you should think about him. Just think about it, he’s only a Saint right now, but he can defeat Emperors without any problems. So what if he attains the Emperor Realm?”

The beautiful woman and Dugu Tianwei’s expressions changed when they heard this. Right! He’s already able to kill Emperors, so what if he attained the Emperor Realm?

Just the thought of it was extremely terrifying!

A long time passed before the woman gazed at Jian Xu and asked, “Senior, are you standing on the Sword Alliance’s side?”

“Kind of!” Jian Xu glanced at Yang Ye while he spoke, “I want this kid to help me with some things, but I don’t like to owe others. So, I’ll make him owe me first. In that way, it wouldn’t be difficult for me to ask him for help.”

The beautiful woman fell silent for a long time before she said, “Allow us to think for a while, alright?”

“Of course!” Jian Xu nodded, and then he glanced at Yang Ye. Yang Ye understood what he meant and immediately left the hall with Jian Xu.

Once Yang Ye left, Dugu Tianwei suddenly asked, “Yu’er, what do you think about him?”

She spoke in a low voice, “An extraordinary genius. If he’s able to get through this battle, then he’ll definitely become a peerless expert in the future. Even if he can’t compare to Jian Wuji, he would absolutely not be someone that any power can go against.”

Dugu Tianwei sighed softly, “I’d intended to live my life in peace, but the heavens just wouldn’t let me!”

Xiao Yu’er looked outside the hall while a trace of complicated emotions arose in her eyes, “If I’m not wrong, then the World Devastator Cult should be here soon.”

As soon as she finished speaking, a ray of black light suddenly shot through the sky before a grey robed man appeared in the hall.

The grey robed man waved his right hand, and a scroll flew over to Dugu Tianwei, “The Cult Leader has given the order for all the Emperors of Violet Thistle City to gather at the Dark Sky Sect. No delay will be tolerated!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the grey robed man’s figure shook slightly before vanishing on the spot.

Dugu Tianwei glanced at the scroll and said, “They’re still as domineering as always!”

As he spoke, he turned to look at Xiao Yu’er, “Which side should we choose?”

Xiao Yu’er’s eyes narrowed slightly.

...

In a room.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground while the violet energy within him was ceaselessly tempering the meridians and bones within him. Presently, Yang Ye would utilize his violet energy to temper his meridians and bones whenever he had the opportunity.

It was actually very easy for him to advance in his cultivation within this world that had no Eye of the Heaven Dao. All it took was sufficient spirit energy. However, he didn’t dare to rashly advance his realm of cultivation before consolidating his foundation.

...

Late at night.

The door to Yang Ye’s room was suddenly pushed open and Dugu Jian walked in. Yang Ye opened his eyes and looked at Dugu Jian.

Dugu Jian walked over to Yang Ye while a trace of anxiety could be seen in his eyes, “Big Brother, leave right now!”

Yang Ye asked, “What’s wrong?”

Dugu Jian shook his head, “Don’t say anything! Just leave!”

Yang Ye asked, “They’ve chosen the World Devastator Cult?”

Dugu Jian nodded, “More or less. Practically everyone sought to side with the World Devastator Cult during the meeting just now. Moreover, some even suggested to surround and kill you. In short, just leave quickly. You might be besieged if you still don’t leave. I know that you’re extremely strong, but you really don’t have to stay here and fight to the death!”

Yang Ye glanced at Dugu Jian while a trace of gratification flashed through his eyes. He patted Dugu Jian’s shoulder lightly before walking out of the room.

Once he left the room, he transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

Dugu Jian looked up into the sky while a slightly complicated expression filled his eyes.

At a certain corner, a grey robed old man looked up at the sky, and he withdrew his gaze once the ray of light vanished into the night sky. After that, he withdrew a talisman and said, “Everything is normal!”

...

At the peak of a mountain, Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground while Jian Xu sat at his side.

Jian Xu asked, “What do you plan to do now?”

Yang Ye replied, “Senior, the other members of the Sword God’s Palace are probably still alive, right?”

“Of course!” Jian Xu replied, “The Sword God’s Palace had a huge array of forces, and it was many times greater than the World Devastator Cult. Even though they were crushed, those disciples who weren’t at the Sword God’s Palace at that time had survived. However, none of them dare to call themselves disciples of the Sword God’s Palace as they are afraid that existence would take revenge on them.”

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, are you aware of their whereabouts?”

Jian Xu gazed at Yang Ye and asked, “You want to recruit them?”

Yang Ye nodded.

“Forget it!” Jian Xu continued, “All of them are extremely proud. Even though you possess Rebirth Realm sword intent, don’t even dream that they will follow you.”

Yang Ye suddenly said, “What if you tell them that I’m Senior Jian Wuji’s successor?”

Jian Xu was stunned. He thought for a moment before he said, “It might be possible if we do that. They have a deep attachment to the Sword God’s Palace. It isn’t just them, even I feel attached to the Sword God’s Palace. However, you have to realize that if others find out that you gathered these past members of the Sword God’s Palace, and especially if that existence finds out, then it’s very likely for calamity to descend upon you!”

Yang Ye fell silent.

He naturally knew everything Jian Xu had mentioned. The Sword God’s Palace’s enemy was definitely extremely strong. If that person found out that he’d converged the members of the Sword God’s Palace again, then that person would definitely think that he intended to rebuild the Sword God’s Palace. Coupled with the fact that he called himself the successor of Jian Wuji, it was very likely for that peerless expert who crushed the Sword God’s Palace to come looking for him!

At that time, he would truly be facing calamity.

Jian Xu said, “If you say that you’re Senior Jian Wuji’s successor and coupled with the Rebirth Realm sword intent you possess, I think that many will definitely be willing to follow you. All of them are living fossils, and their strength is beyond any doubt. However, you have to realize that if that existence from all those years ago is still alive, then it’s very likely for him to come looking for you! Because that existence’s resentment towards the Sword God’s Palace is extremely strong.”

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then he flipped his palm and the ancient sheath appeared in his grasp. He gazed at it for a short while before he said, “There’s no reward without risk. If that existence still hasn’t let go of the enmity from all those years ago, then that existence can come at me! I’m not afraid!”

Jian Xu gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he said, “You... really are brave!”

Yang Ye turned to look at Jian Xu, “Senior Jian Xu, I’ll be troubling you with contacting those people from the Sword God’s Palace. I’m truly unable to do it myself right now. Moreover, I have something else that I need to do.”

Jian Xu asked, “Are you really sure?”

Yang Ye stood up, took a deep breath, and said, “Consider it a gamble. A gamble on whether that person has let go of the enmity from all those years ago. If that person hasn’t and insists on kill us, then bring it on! As I said before, I’m not afraid!”

Jian Xu pondered deeply for a short moment and said, “Many might not agree to leave their places of hiding!”

Yang Ye replied, “Ask them something for me. Do they wish to cower like cowards for their entire life? If they do, then I don’t need such people.”

“I understand!” Jian Xu nodded, “Then I’ll be going. Actually, what do you plan to do after this?”

Yang Ye looked up at the sky and said, “I plan to make a trip to the Dark Sky Sect.”

“The World Devastator Cult has ordered the 2 remaining cities and the other sect to converge at the Dark Sky Sect. Don’t lose your life on your trip!” Jian Xu’s figure vanished into the sky once he finished speaking.

Once Jian Xu left, Yang Ye’s figure transformed into a ray of light that entered the expanse of space before him.

He wanted to see how many Emperors those powers had gathered, and if it was possible, it would be even better if he could kill some and refine them into Sword Servants.

The Void Flash sword technique was extremely swift, and it took Yang Ye less than 4 hours to arrive at the Dark Sky Sect.

Yang Ye who’d intended to sneak into the Dark Sky Sect had suddenly stopped. He looked up at the direction of the Dark Sky Sect and pondered deeply for a long time before he said, “1, 2, 10, 17, 23.... A total of 23 Emperors....”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched when he sensed the auras of 23 Emperors. A short while of hesitance passed before he spoke softly, “Why don’t... why don’t I come back another day.”
