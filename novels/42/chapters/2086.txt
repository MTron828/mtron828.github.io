Yang Ye glanced at the middle aged man with displeasure, Doesn’t he know how to speak to others?

“Don’t bring shame to it!” The woman in a white dress spoke abruptly.

Yang Ye was about to ask her something when she vanished into thin air.

Yang Ye gazed at the middle aged man, “Senior, who is she?”

The middle aged man glanced at Yang Ye, “I was going to ask how you knew her!”

Yang Ye was astounded, “I know her?”

The middle aged man said, “You would be dead if she didn’t, and would she have given Elysium to you?”

Yang Ye asked, “Who is she?”

The middle aged man shrugged, “The Strategist. The brains of my god race. I didn’t say anything because she asked me to give it to you. Because if she does something, there’s definitely a reason!”

She knows me? Yang Ye wracked his brains but couldn’t think who it was. Even though he knew many women, he didn’t know any one of them who possessed such ability and was a member of the god race.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and asked, “What is your god race planning?”

The god race had been showing themselves frequently lately. Obviously, they were planning something.

“What are we planning?” A smile appeared on his face, “You’ll find out soon.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he patted Yang Ye on the shoulder, “While I don’t know what kind of ability you possess, since the Strategist thinks so highly of you and even gave you Elysium, it’s clear that there’s definitely something extraordinary about you. I look forward to fighting by your side!”

He vanished into the sky once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye gazed up into the sky for a long time before he turned around and left.

No matter what the god race was up to, it wasn’t something he could interfere in. The enmity between the god race and the other races was something that no one could mediate. He felt that they would definitely fight, and it may occur very soon.

At an empty place, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and entered the Primordial Pagoda once he determined there was no one here.

Elysium!

Yang Ye fell silent as he gazed at the box before him. He hadn’t expected that woman to give this weapon to him. He was a sword cultivator, but he was a body cultivator too. So, this halberd wasn’t impossible for him to use, or it should be said to be very suitable for him.

The halberd could be said to be better than the Sword Supreme and Judgment now. Of course, that was because the Sword Supreme’s sword spirit was in deep sleep, so its strength couldn’t be fully revealed. After all, the Sword Supreme had taken one of the dragon eyes on the halberd. As for now, Elysium was clearly stronger than the Sword Supreme.

Yang Ye stretched out his hand and took Elysium in his grasp. It felt icy cold. A moment later, the dragon scales around it started to tremble and seemed like they would come to life at any moment. Yang Ye slowly exerted strength and gradually raised Elysium. In an instant, a dragon roar resounded throughout the Primordial Pagoda, and it was filled with an endless will to fight that made others’ blood boil.

Yang Ye slowly lowered Elysium back to the ground.

Boom!

In an instant, the ground shook violently and cracked open.

Strength!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly. He sensed endless strength within Elysium, and it was strength that came from Elysium itself. Moreover, his physical body couldn’t endure that strength!

His current physical strength couldn’t endure it at all. Because dense threads of blood were already covering Yang Ye’s right hand. His skin had cracked open!

His body wasn’t strong enough!

Boom!

Meanwhile, a wave of terrifying aura swept through Yang Ye, and then an ethereal white dragon appeared behind him.

The Sky Dragon!

Once Yang Ye used the Sky Dragon, he immediately felt much better. While it was still quite strenuous, he was barely able to use it. However, he couldn’t use it for long. If he used it for more than two hours, he would definitely die of exhaustion.

A smile curled on Yang Ye’s face as he gazed at Elysium. At this moment, he felt like he could really fight a Sage. Based on his current physical strength and Elysium’s strength, he could definitely fight a Sage. However, if he encountered an expert like the middle aged man, then his strength was still a little insufficient.

After that, Yang Ye started to get used to using Elysium.

He didn’t have any combat techniques, and he just trained with normal swings, flicks, stabs…

Everything always converged back to the same place. So, he used Elysium like he would a sword!

“Big Brother!” Suddenly, an anxious voice resounded in Yang Ye’s ears. He turned to look, and he saw Tian Xiu running towards him while anxiety covered her face.

Yang Ye flashed over to her and took her in his arms, “What is it?”

She gasped for breath, “Hurry! Sno-Snowy! She… She…”

Snowy? Yang Ye’s expression changed, and then he immediately searched for Snowy. A moment later, he vanished on the spot with Tian Xiu in his arms.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to locate Snowy.

She was floating in midair and trembling.

“What’s going on?” Yang Ye ran over to Snowy’s side. Meanwhile, a terrifying wave of spirit energy swept out from Snowy and pushed Yang Ye away.

Yang Ye gazed at Snowy with disbelief, “What?”

Tian Xiu spoke softly, “She… She ate that fiery flower, and then this happened!”

Fiery flower? Yang Ye was stunned, but it didn’t take long for him to realize what it was. She’s probably talking about that precious fire lotus, right?

There’s something wrong with the fire lotus? Such a thought appeared in Yang Ye’s mind, but it only took a moment for him to deny it. The Fire Sprite had no reason to harm Snowy.

“Don’t worry!” Suddenly, a voice resounded, and Yang Ye saw Little Sky.

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Is she evolving?”

Little Sky nodded, “Sprite Lords have to evolve, of course. However, Sprite Lords like Snowy take a very, very long time to evolve once. Some even take over 10,000 years to evolve once. If it was under normal conditions, she would be far from being able to evolve. However, she has been absorbing violet energy in this pagoda, and she has been ceaselessly consuming all sorts of treasures. So, she’s evolving in advance.”

Yang Ye asked, “In advance?”

Little Sky nodded slightly, “She’s evolving in advance. The Fire Lotus she consumed was the last straw to start her evolution. Once she completes it, her abilities will be improved tremendously. At that time, her utilization of spirit energy will definitely be extremely terrifying. Moreover, she will be even more deterring to other Sprites. In short, it’s a good thing.”

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief.

He didn’t really care if she was evolving or not, he was just concerned about her safety.

Meanwhile, Little Sky spoke softly, “Once she evolves, even Sages will be extremely tempted to possess her. Not to mention Sages, even those progenitors will be tempted. At that time, you can’t let her go outside at will. Otherwise, the slightest mistake may cause countless Sages to look for you.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Many Sages are already looking for me!”

Little Sky, I’m serious. Once Snowy completes her evolution, she’ll become very, very useful. One of her abilities is gathering spirit energy. She’ll be a natural spirit vein, and a top-rate one. You’ll never have to worry about spirit energy with her by your side. Besides that, possessing a Sprite Lord like her will bring many, many more benefits. In short, you must be careful and don’t let her run wild outside.”

Yang Ye smiled, “I understand. I won’t let her be so exposed in the future. But how long will this take?”

Little Sky replied, “If it happened anywhere else, it may take very long. But if it’s here, it’ll take around a month at most. After all, the spirit energy here is abundant, and it’s very, very good too. Moreover, the pagoda’s spirit is helping her!”

Yang Ye gazed at Little Sky, “The pagoda’s spirit is helping her?”

Little Sky nodded, “The pagoda’s spirit is protecting her, or to be more precise, it’s helping her stay stable.”

“What a lucky little fellow!” Yang Ye laughed bitterly. Even he couldn’t make the pagoda’s spirit guard him while he advanced, but Snowy could. It could be said that with the pagoda’s spirit there to protect her, her safety was guaranteed.

“What about you?” Meanwhile, Little Sky gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at her with bewilderment, “What about me?”

She spoke softly, “What do you plan to do?”

“Plan?” Yang Ye smiled, “What else can I plan? I have no plans. My first objective is to stay alive. If even staying alive is a problem, how can I possibly have the time to think about anything else?”

Little Sky smiled, “True. Good luck. Right, I’ve placed Zi’er’s soul in the Soulmend Casket, and it’s working very well. Both Zi’er and Blood Maiden should be able to regain consciousness very soon.”

Yang Ye took a deep breath. Now, he had nothing else to worry about. He glanced at Snowy, and he noticed that she’d calmed down.

Suddenly, Yang Ye frowned, and then he gazed at Snowy, “I’m going outside to deal with something!”

Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda once he finished speaking.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye withdrew a transmission stone. It was the stone Yang Lianshuang had given him before he left, and Yang Lianshuang’s voice came from it, “Experts from the god race are heading to the Sky Dimension. Your friend, Xiao Qi, may be in danger. Are you going to go?”

The god race has gone to the Sky Dimension? Yang Ye frowned, Are they going to attack the sky race?
