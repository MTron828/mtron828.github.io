Chapter 330 – Change In The Situation!

Yang Ye and Xiao Yuxi both stopped moving. Mo Qingyu was in front of them right now. At this moment, she was gazing ahead with an unprecedentedly solemn expression in her eyes while fierce and sharp invisible Sword Intent seemed to have formed a protective barrier around her.

Yang Ye and Xiao Yuxi looked along the direction of Mo Qingyu’s gaze. An expanse of pitch black filled their field of vision, and strands of cold wind seeped out incessantly from there. The cold winds were strong to the point it still invaded their bodies and souls even if the three of them resisted it with all their strengths. Fortunately, while their bodies and souls were invaded, it wasn’t lethal!

The shape of an enormous tornado could be faintly discerned amidst the pitch black darkness. It was spinning at a speed that wasn’t visible to their eyes, and the space around it was ceaselessly destroyed as it spun! Yes, the expanse of pitch black was exactly the spatial rifts that were blasted open by the Ninth Hell Cold Gale!

It at least required the strength of an Exalt Realm expert to cause damage to space, yet the Ninth Hell Cold Gale was able to accomplish it with ease. Moreover, it was a form of constant damage. This caused their expressions to become solemn.

“As expected of a Natural Treasure. Even though it’s still in its infancy, it already possesses a little Natural Might!” Mo Qingyu spoke in a light voice, and then she turned to gaze at Yang Ye and Mo Qingyu before she said, “Looks like both of you are targeting the Ninth Hell Cold Gale as well. Haha! Xiao Yuxi, the ignorant are fearless, but could it be that you’re ignorant as well?”

Xiao Yuxi’s fair hand moved slightly, and a strand of cold light instantly appeared in front of Mo Qingyu. The latter grinned lightly before she flicked her finger, and a strand of green sword qi instantly shot forward violently. It struck the strand of cold light, and the two instantly dispersed in midair.

“What’s the point of that?” Mo Qingyu said, “Our strengths are equally matched, and we’re both unable to do anything to each other if we don’t utilize our full strength. So, is there any point in wasting profound energy like that?”

“You talk too much!” Xiao Yuxi gazed at Mo Qingyu as she spoke indifferently.

Mo Qingyu was stunned, and then she shook her head and chuckled lightly. After that, she gazed at Yang Ye and said, “The future Sword Emperor? Do you know how unworthy you are of such a title?”

“Could it be that you are?” said Yang Ye with a smile on his face.

“Of course!” Mo Qingyu nodded and said, “Besides I, Mo Qingyu, could anyone else on this continent be more worthy of that title?” Her tone made it sound like it was a matter of course, and there wasn’t even a trace of unnaturalness.

Yang Ye didn’t reveal any ridicule or contempt when he heard this, and his expression became even more solemn instead. Her confidence made him feel slightly fearful. The Sword Dao emphasized greatly on one’s mental state. The stronger one’s mental state was, the stronger one’s Sword Dao would be. Someone that possessed such practically arrogant confidence was either formidable or an idiot. Obviously, she was the former!

Yang Ye shrugged and said, “If you like it, then just take it!” Yang Ye spoke with extreme sincerity, and he was speaking from the heart. Because not only did this title give him no benefit at all, it caused a huge amount of trouble for him instead. So, he felt that anyone who wanted it could have it. He didn’t want it at all!

“What do you think the title of Sword Emperor is? Is it an object that you can just give away?” Mo Qingyu’s gaze suddenly turned icy cold, and then a green energy sword instantly appeared in front of her. In the next instant, it transformed into a ray of light that instantly shot explosively towards Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s face fell when he saw her suddenly attacking him. What’s wrong with her?

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath. He clenched his right hand tightly into a fist, and then he blasted his fist at the green energy sword!

Bang!

The energy sword instantly dispersed.

Right when Mo Qingyu intended to continue attacking, the tornado suddenly started moving incessantly towards the surroundings. Yang Ye and the others were shocked, and they retreated repeatedly. Presently, the enormous tornado carried the energy of the heavens and the earth with it, and they would definitely perish if they moved forward!

The enormous tornado grew more and more violent, and it raged incessantly in the distance. Everywhere it passed, space was blasted into pieces inch by inch to reveal expanse after expanse of pitch black spatial rifts. This sight caused Yang Ye and the others to feel extremely horrified.

“What’s going on with it?” asked Yang Ye in a low voice.

Xiao Yuxi shook her head.

On the other hand, Mo Qingyu’s eyes lit up instead, and a glow of excitement flickered in the depths of her eyes.

Yang Ye fell silent. At this moment, he was truly conflicted as he gazed at the terrifying tornado in the distance. Even an Exalt Realm expert would probably die when facing this thing, but Elder Mu actually asked me to subdue it.... Elder Mu would naturally not send me here to give my life away. Since it’s like that, then there’s definitely a method or treasure that can deal with the Ninth Hell Cold Gale and I should possess that method or treasure!

But exactly what is it? In next to no time, Yang Ye thought of something, and it was the tiny vortex! But how should I communicate with the tiny vortex?

Since the tiny vortex had refused to give him profound energy that day, he had a feeling that the tiny vortex seemed to be very displeased with him. Moreover, if he wanted the tiny vortex to deal with the Ninth Hell Cold Gale, then he had to make it enter the tiny vortex!

As he gazed at the enormous tornado, Yang Ye resolutely abandoned this thought. What a joke! Make it enter the tiny vortex? He would definitely be courting death by doing that!

Right at this moment, an unexpected event occurred. Under the astounded gazes of Yang Ye and the others, the tornado actually started to shrink swiftly!

Xiao Yuxi spoke with a slightly trembling voice upon witnessing this scene. “I understand now. It’s transforming to form a Gale Spirit!”

Mo Qingyu glanced at Xiao Yuxi, and a cold glow flickered in her eyes.

“What do you mean?” Yang Ye was puzzled.

Xiao Yuxi said, “It was originally in an ignorant state and didn’t possess any intelligence. Yet now, it’s transforming. Once it transforms successfully, then it’ll form a Gale Spirit. At that time, it would be at its weakest state, and it would be the moment that it’s the easiest to deal with. That’s your only chance if you want to subdue it!”

Yang Ye’s eyes instantly lit up when he heard this. Now, he understood what forming a Gale Spirit meant. It should be something like the Nether Ghostflame that was within his body. Even though the Nether Ghostflame couldn’t speak or take human form, it possessed intelligence, and this was something that couldn’t be doubted. Now, the Ninth Hell Cold Gale was probably transforming into the state that the Nether Ghostflame was in! In other words, he had a chance now!

However, Mo Qingyu was at the side....

Yang Ye glanced at Mo Qingyu, and then the Hidden Sword appeared in his hand with a twist of his wrist. After that, the profound energy within his body surged madly. He was determined to obtain the Ninth Hell Cold Gale.

At this moment, a strange scene suddenly occurred here. The cold winds in the surroundings suddenly surged towards Mo Qingyu. However, they didn’t attack her and surrounded her to form a seemingly material whirlwind instead. On the other hand, Mo Qingyu’s body started to become ethereal as if she was fusing into one with the cold wind....

“Wind Intent!” Xiao Yuxi tightened her grip on the hilt of her saber upon witnessed this scene, and she said in a low voice. “Wind Intent is an extremely mysterious Intent. Because so long as it’s a place with wind, then that wind can be utilized by her. She’s actually able to control the cold wind here, so it represents that her Wind Intent has probably arrived at the 7th level or even higher!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath. Isn’t she a little too fucking monstrous? As expected, there’s always someone stronger in the world!

Xiao Yuxi suddenly said, “I might not be able to stop her!”

Yang Ye asked with an astounded expression. “Why?”

Xiao Yuxi shook her head, and then she said, “I’ll try my best. You... you have to be careful when you subdue it later. Give up if you can’t, alright?”

Yang Ye’s heart felt warm, and he nodded before he said with a smile on his face, “Don’t worry, I’ll act within the limits of my ability!”

Xiao Yuxi nodded, and then she gradually drew her saber while her gaze locked onto Mo Qingyu. The latter didn’t even look over towards Yang Ye and Xiao Yuxi, and she just stared fixedly at the tornado that was growing smaller and smaller!

The enormous tornado shrunk smaller and smaller before their gazes, and it gradually became the size of an adult’s body. Even though it had become smaller, the terrifying energy contained within it was horrifying.

At this moment, Yang Ye couldn’t help but be excited. He was naturally happier the stronger it was. After all, he urgently needed to improve his strength.

The whirlwind around Mo Qingyu grew faster and faster while her figure grew more and more translucent to the point she seemed like an expanse of clear wind.

Light flickered incessantly on the curved saber in Xiao Yuxi’s hand, and a strand of invisible, fierce, and sharp Saber Intent surged endlessly from her body. As the Saber Intent surged out from her body, it didn’t seem to be disorderly, and it moved around her body in an extremely orderly manner like it was a protective wall!

As for Yang Ye, he was swiftly slapping five talismans onto himself, and these talismans included the Strider Talisman, Strength Talisman, Energy Convergence Talisman....

At the same time, he stopped holding back at all, and the profound energy within his body surged out like a torrent. Under the enhancement provided by his violet colored profound energy, a layer of faint violet mist had mysteriously appeared around Yang Ye. However, Yang Ye hadn’t noticed it....

The speed that the tornado shrunk at grew swifter and swifter before their solemn gazes. At this point, it was only the size of an arm, and it was still shrinking swiftly at a visible speed. Suddenly, the small tornado exploded abruptly with a bang, and then a strand of a green mini tornado appeared before their fields of vision!

Right at this moment, the three of them acted! Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

A strand of cold light instantly shot at Mo Qingyu. It was swifter than a bolt of lightning, and it instantly arrived where Mo Qingyu was. However, that spot was empty right now....

Mo Qingyu had suddenly appeared in front of the mini tornado. After that, a palm-sized and golden bell-shaped cover appeared in her hand, and she cupped it down towards the green tornado!

The green mini tornado was stunned on the spot, and then it flashed towards the distance with a swish. However, the golden bell-shaped cover had pierced through space and instantly arrived above the mini tornado, and then a strand of golden light descended and trapped the mini tornado.

Mo Qingyu revealed a delighted expression when she witnessed this scene. However, right at this moment, a strand of cold light and a strand of violet sword qi shot violently towards her for both sides!

Mo Qingyu grunted coldly, and then she waved her hand before she transformed into a strand of light wind that vanished on the spot with the golden bell-shaped cover. In the next moment, she appeared over 30m away in the distance!

Yang Ye and Xiao Yuxi’s expressions changed violently when they witnessed this scene. Mo Qingyu’s speed was truly too swift, and it was swift to the point they were utterly unable to catch up to her!

In his anxiety, Yang Ye’s eyes suddenly lit up, and then he swiftly shouted. “Little Fellow, someone’s speed is faster than yours. Are you still not going to come out here!?”
