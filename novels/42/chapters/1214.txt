Chapter 1215 – The Cult Leader!

The faces of many on the city walls instantly turned ghastly pale at the sight of this, whereas a ghastly cold smile had curled up on the corners of the Head Snatcher’s mouth.

Suddenly, the Head Snatcher watched with astonishment as the wound on Yang Ye’s throat healed in an instant!

The Head Snatcher’s face was covered in disbelief, “How... how could... this be... possible!”

Yang Ye touched his throat, looked up, and had an extremely solemn expression in his eyes as he looked at the Head Snatcher. At that instant earlier, he’d actually felt his blood being moved by something. Especially the blood at his throat. It seemed to have transformed into a sharp blade that sliced at his throat from inside out. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Fortunately, the tiny vortex had revolved at the critical moment and suppressed the mysterious force that was moving his blood. Otherwise, he might have really lost his head. Of course, it was only a possibility because while his throat had split open slightly, it was just a small wound that wasn’t lethal. Moreover, now that he was vigilant against such a threat, he didn’t even need the tiny vortex’s help and could just suppress it with his sword intent!

Yang Ye had truly stopped underestimating his opponent. No, it should be said that he was fully on guard. He had never underestimated the Head Snatcher since the beginning, and it was just that strange method of attack which had almost got him”

“How... did you....” The Head Snatcher wanted to say something but Yang Ye wasn’t in the mood to listen. The ancient sheathe appeared in Yang Ye’s grasp before he sheathed an intent sword within it, and then he drew it swiftly.

Om!

An ear piercing sword howl resounded through the sky as a beam of sword energy shot through the sky towards the Head Snatcher.

200 overlapped Heavenrends enhanced by Rebirth Realm sword intent. So, its strength was simply terrifying. Everywhere it passed, space was instantly minced into bits. Moreover, the sword energy hadn’t even arrived when the powerful sword intent and energy within it forced the Head Snatcher back repeatedly.

The Head Snatcher’s pupils constricted, and he was shocked. He issued a command in his heart, and a blood red shield immediately appeared before him. After that, he bit the tip of his tongue, causing a drop of Blood Essence to shoot forward and enter the shield. The cracks throughout the shield instantly started healing at a visible speed, and a thin blood red barrier of light had appeared on the shield as well.

Bang!

The sword energy slammed against the shield. The thin barrier of light on it shattered in an instant while the Head Snatcher was blasted back!

As soon as the Head Snatcher’s figure stopped moving, a beam of sword energy which was on par with the last one had suddenly torn through the air and slammed against the shield again.

Bang!

The shield cracked apart while the Head Snatcher was blasted backwards again!

This time, the Head Snatcher’s figure hadn’t even stopped moving when Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that shot at him. Yang Ye’s speed was too swift. Even if the Head Snatcher saw the attack, he could do nothing about it. All he could do was swiftly bite the tip of his tongue and spit his Blood Essence on the shield.

At this moment, he absolutely couldn’t allow his shield to be shattered, or only death would be awaiting him!

Once his Blood Essence sprayed on the shield, it shook violently before a blood red barrier of light covered it once more. However, a sword struck it as soon as it was formed.

Bang!

The space around Yang Ye and the Head Snatcher cracked apart, and the Head Snatcher spat up a few more strands of Blood Essence on the shield. This time, he wasn’t spitting it out on purpose. It was because his internal organs had been damaged, and he had no choice but to spit it out. At the same time, the Head Snatcher was blasted back once more.

However, Yang Ye was like a shadow that appeared before the Head Snatcher again. This time, Yang Ye didn’t swing his sword. He issued a command in his heart before fiery red dragon scales instantly covered his hands and arms. After that, Yang Ye grabbed the blood red shield while the Head Snatcher watched with astonishment.

He wants to seize it! The Head Snatcher was astounded. He issued a command in his heart, and the shield immediately started spinning while countless blood red blades of light shot out from it. However, Yang Ye didn’t dodge them. In the end, all the blood red blades of light entered Yang Ye’s body.

A grin curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, and he exerted force and instantly took the shield. However, the shield trembled violently. It was linked to the Head Snatcher and had acknowledged him as its master, so it naturally wouldn’t allow itself to be taken. However, it couldn’t struggle free of Yang Ye’s grasp no matter how it tried.

Yang Ye glanced at the blood red shield, and then he tossed it into the tiny vortex.

As soon as it entered the tiny vortex, the Head Snatcher’s eyes opened wide, “How... how....”

“Just shut up!” As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of light that shot forward. The Head Snatcher was horrified. He couldn’t flee at all because Yang Ye’s speed far surpassed his own, so he had no choice but to go head-on against Yang Ye!

In an instant, Yang Ye sword arrived before him, but it stopped just shy of an inch from the center of the Head Snatcher’s forehead. Because he’d grabbed it with both hands.

A smile arose on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth as he spun the sword with his right hand.

Hiss!

The Head Snatcher’s hands were cut apart, and then Yang Ye pressed forward and slammed his body against the Head Snatcher.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded as the Head Snatcher’s figure was blasted flying. At the same time, a ray of sword energy tore through the air and shot towards the Head Snatcher. Right when it was about to strike its target, a black hand suddenly tore through space and appeared in front of the Head Snatcher before grabbing Yang Ye’s sword energy.

Bang!

The sword energy shattered while the hand vanished, and then a blue robed old man appeared in front of the Head Snatcher.

“You....” The old man was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot, and he was in front of the old man when his figure appeared once more. After that, he drew his sword swiftly.

The old man’s pupils constricted. He didn’t dare act carelessly at all, and he clenched both his hands into fists before slamming them forward in Yang Ye’s direction.

Bang!

The sword and fists collided. The old man’s arms instantly cracked apart while his figure was blasted away.

“AH!!” Meanwhile, a shrill cry resounded abruptly from afar. The old man looked up and saw a sword had stabbed through the center of the Head Snatcher’s forehead. The sight of this made the old man’s eyes narrow slightly while a trace of shock appeared within them.

Yang Ye beckoned and the Head Snatcher’s spatial ring flew into his grasp. After that, the Head Snatcher’s corpse was transported into his spatial ring with a wave of his hand.

Yang Ye turned around and gazed at the blue robed old man, “Your World Devastator Cult is finally unable to stand by idly and watch?”

The old man waved his right hand and 15 other blue robed old men appeared around him.

15 Emperors!

At this moment, the Sword Alliance and the other powers had stopped fighting.

Yang Ye had lost 6 of his Emperor Realm Sword Servants, Violet Thistle City had lost an Emperor, and both Jian Ji and Jian Xu had suffered some light injuries. As for the Dark Sky Sect and the other powers, they were in quite a miserable state. Jian Xu and Jian Ji could each fight 2 Emperors on their own. Especially Jian Ji, he could even fight 3 on his own. So, practically everyone who faced them in battle was dead.

The Dark Sky Sect had 16 Emperors on its side, yet now, only 9 remained.

They’d suffered heavy losses!

Xiao Tian, Li Canghai, and Xue Mei, the leaders of their respective powers, had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces. Because they’d truly suffered heavy losses, and they would probably be unable to recover from it without hundreds of years of time!

Meanwhile, a middle aged man who held a folding fan appeared in the sky, “I never expected the surviving fugitives of the Sword God’s Palace were supporting you!”

“Leader!” The blue robed old men bowed slightly to the middle aged man and spoke respectfully.

“Surviving fugitives?” A cold glow flashed through Jian Xu’s eyes, “Your World Devastator Cult was probably nothing during the era of the Sword God’s Palace!”

“I respect Senior Jian Wuji!” The middle aged man spoke indifferently, “But as for your Sword God’s Palace. Hahaha.... All of you don’t even dare to return to your home. You’re just a bunch of homeless dogs. I wouldn’t have paid any attention to all of you if you remained in hiding, but all of you just had to court death. Since that’s the case, then my World Devastator Cult will put an end to the Sword God’s Palace!”

“You?” Meanwhile, Jian Ji suddenly withdrew a sword chest and said, “The Leader of the World Devastator Cult? Haha! Come! Let me see how strong you are!”

“As you wish!” The middle aged man glanced indifferently at Jian Ji, and then he turned around to gaze at the blue robed old men, “Kill them! Don’t let a single one survive!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he shot up into the sky while Jian Ji followed closely behind him.

The World Devastator Cult’s arrival caused the advantage that the Sword Alliance possessed to be transformed into a disadvantage. Because when the World Devastator Cult’s Emperors were included, the enemy had 24 Emperors on their side now! But the Sword Alliance only had 10 left!

The difference was too huge!

Jian Xu and the others had unsightly expressions on their faces.

Meanwhile, Xiao Tian spoke with a ferocious expression on his face, “Yang Ye! Let me see who can save you and your Sword Alliance now! Don’t worry! I’ll annihilate the entire Sword Alliance while you watch!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Actually, I’ve been waiting for the World Devastator Cult’s forces to show themselves!”

One of the blue robed old men frowned, “Why?”

Yang Ye gazed at that old man while a grin curled up on the corners of his mouth, “Because only then can I annihilate all of you at once!”

“You?” The old man revealed a wisp of ridicule on his face.

“Yes, me!” As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, his eyes instantly turned blood red.

“Heaven’s Gravestone!”

Bang!

As soon as Yang Ye spoke, a pillar of blood suddenly shot out from Yang Ye, and then all the Emperors here were instantly forced to move backwards repeatedly.
