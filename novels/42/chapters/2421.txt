Chapter 2422 – Are You No Match?

Snowy was furious when she saw the small demon beast charge at her.

Snowy glared at it and was about to attack. However, Erya suddenly appeared in front of her and Yang Ye.

Erya gazed at the black demon beast that was charging in her direction, and her face remained emotionless. She suddenly swung a punch when it was less than 3m away.

Bang!

This punch forced the demon beast to a stop. An instant later, she swung another punch, and it was punched flying all the way to Huang Tianxing.

The pitch black demon beast was exasperated from being punched away, and a vicious glow arose in its eyes. A moment later, strands of terrifying aura seeped out incessantly from within it. At the same time, its body gradually grew larger.

Erya glanced at it and patted her hands together, “Little piece of trash!”

The demon beast was beyond furious when it heard this. It raised its right claw and placed it on the horn on its head, and it was about to attack when Huang Tianxing suddenly stopped it.

The demon beast glanced at Huang Tianxing while the intent to kill still filled its eyes!

Huang Tianxing glanced at it and spoke indifferently, “Stand down!”

The demon beast bared its fangs at him and howled. Obviously, it didn’t want to.

Huang Tianxing nodded, “Then go on!”

Once it received his permission, the demon beast’s tiny body instantly expanded over 10 times. At this moment, it was at least two times larger than an elephant, and its aura instantly rose explosively as well!

The Four World Realm!

A true Four World Realm demon beast!

The demon beast suddenly leaped up and pounced at Erya.

A powerful wave of pressure and aura swept toward her like a storm. In an instant, the space there trembled before it.

Erya’s face remained indifferent. Suddenly, she stomped her right foot down and shot up into the air, and then she slammed herself against the demon beast.

Boom!

An explosion resounded in mid-air, and then a figure was blasted away!

It was the black demon beast!

A moment later, Erya instantly appeared before it, and she slammed her fist down against its head.

As soon as it slammed down, the veins beneath her arm trembled while a wave of mysterious energy rippled out.

The energy of her bloodline!

Boom!

The demon beast’s head instantly cracked open. It wasn’t just its head which had cracked open, even its body cracked open in an instant and blood sprayed!

Meanwhile, Erya swung another punch!

Boom!

The demon beast was punched flying again.

After she punched it away, Erya didn’t attack again. She returned to Yang Ye and glanced at both Yang Ye and Snowy, “I’m amazing, right?”

Snowy nodded repeatedly.

Yang Ye glanced at her in silence.

Erya cracked a smile at Snowy, and then she turned around and walked toward the demon beast.

The demon beast gazed at Erya with astonishment and fear in its eyes. Besides that, there was a trace of terror too!

Terror!

It didn’t know what Erya was, but it knew that the little girl was absolutely not someone it could offend!

As it watched Erya walk closer, the demon beast instinctively moved behind Huang Tianxing.

Erya was stunned by the sight of this and laughed with ridicule, “Coward!”

The demon beast was exasperated by this, but it didn’t dare to step forward and fight her!

While it didn’t dare to attack, Erya did. She tapped her right foot down lightly and shot at it.

The demon beast hesitated for a moment but didn’t attack in the end. It had been traumatized by her punches.

It didn’t take long for Erya to arrive in front of it, and then she slammed her fist at Huang Tianxing.

Huang Tianxing’s expression remained indifferent as he took a step forward and slammed his fist at her.

Their fists collided.

Bang!

The entire area shook violently!

Huang Tianxing took two steps back while Erya returned to Yang Ye.

She glanced at Huang Tianxing and said, “Big Brother Yang, you deal with him!”

She moved behind Yang Ye as she spoke.

Yang Ye glared at her, and then he gazed at Huang Tianxing and swung his sword.

Hiss!

A ray of brilliant sword energy flashed.

Huang Tianxing remained indifferent as he tapped his finger forward, and it tapped on the ray of sword energy.

Hiss!

The sword energy shook violently, and then Huang Tianxing took quite a few steps back, but it didn’t take long for him to stabilize himself and twist his right hand.

Bang!

The sword energy exploded apart. Huang Tianxing took a step forward and tapped his finger at Yang Ye from afar.

Hiss!

A ray of black light flashed.

A ray of sword energy shot out from Yang Ye’s waist.

Bang!

The ray of black light exploded apart before Yang Ye, and he took a few steps back!

The surroundings fell silent!

Huang Tianxing glanced at Yang Ye, “Not bad. Unfortunately, you’re bound to die!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot with the demon beast and Ye Gou.

Bound to die!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly.

The desolate race had shown themselves, so it was obvious that Eternal Kingdom would be coming too. Regardless of whether it was the desolate race or Eternal Kingdom, their objective was definitely Snowy!

The Sprite Progenitor!

Eternal Kingdom definitely wanted to possess the Sprite Progenitor again and make the Sprite Progenitor take their side, and the desolate race definitely didn’t want history to repeat itself!

Simply speaking, Yang Ye and Snowy were stuck in between Eternal Kingdom and the desolate race!

Meanwhile, Snowy suddenly pointed down to indicate that Yang Ye should head down there.

Head down there? Yang Ye was stunned and asked, “There’s a treasure down there?”

Snowy nodded.

Yang Ye grinned, “Come on, let’s head down there!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot with Snowy and Erya.

The Abyss World was huge. It was a world, but it was very small to people like Yang Ye. After all, he could see through half of it with a single glance.

Yang Ye shot all the way down on his sword for almost two hours before he arrived at the bottom.

It was a gray and hazy world. He could neither see the sky nor the ground, and the surroundings were ghastly and cold.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Snowy pointed ahead to indicate that Yang Ye should go that way.

Meanwhile, Erya suddenly asked, “Snowy, is there any danger?”

Danger?

Snowy blinked, looked into the distance, hesitated for a moment, and then finally shook her head.

Yang Ye and Erya exchanged glances. In the end, Erya licked her tanghulu and asked, “Snowy, is it really not dangerous?”

Snowy shot a glance in that direction, blinked, and then gazed at them with a questioning gaze. Is there danger there?

Erya’s face darkened, “We’re asking you that question!”

Snowy raised her paws to display that she didn’t know.

Erya was quite displeased, “If you don’t know, then why did you say that there’s no danger there?”

Snowy pointed in that direction and blinked. She seemed to be asking if there was danger there!

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Erya walked over to Snowy, passed the tangulu to her, and said, “I’m really helpless against you!”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Big Brother Yang, you ask!”

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s little head and pointed ahead, “Snowy, whatever is over there, can Erya and I win against it?”

Erya gave Yang Ye a thumbs up, “Big Brother Yang, you really know how to do it!”

Snowy glanced ahead, thought for a while, and then nodded.

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright, let’s go!”

Erya too felt that there was no issue now.

Just like that, Yang Ye left Snowy and Erya forward, and around an hour later, he stopped.

There was a mountain wall not too far ahead of them, and there was a huge crack on it. The crack went extremely deep to the point he couldn’t see where it led. On the right of the crack was a broken saber. There was only half of it left, and it was completely cracked apart. There was no life left in it!

Snowy waved her right paw, and it immediately flew over to her. Snowy shook her head as she gazed at it.

Yang Ye asked, “What’s wrong?”

Snowy tapped it lightly, and then she waved her paw to display that it was broken.

Yang Ye asked, “Can you repair it?”

Snowy thought for a moment and blew on it. In an instant, a strand of pure spirit energy entered it, and then the saber shook violently. After that, the cracks on it gradually healed.

Erya glanced at Snowy and said, “Snowy, you can specialize in repairing weapons! You’ll make a killing!”

Snowy cracked a smile and tapped the saber a few times. A short while later, the saber howled, and then it emanated rays of light.

A Pseudo Divine Treasure!

The broken saber was definitely a Divine Treasure at least. Unfortunately, it had been broken apart, and not only had its body been destroyed, even its intelligence had been destroyed. So, the saber had instantly been reduced to nothing.

Now, Snowy had clearly given it new life.

The broken saber trembled in Snowy’s paws and seemed to be communicating with Snowy.

Snowy glanced at it, patted it lightly, and then sent it into the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye glanced at Snowy and was about to speak when the mountain wall started shaking.

Yang Ye, Erya, and Snowy hurriedly looked over, and the cracks on the mountain wall gradually grew larger.

Yang Ye walked to the front of their group, and tightened his grip on his sword while a vigilant expression appeared on his face.

Erya licked her tanghulu and just gazed at the cracks. No one knew what she was thinking.

Suddenly, a black hand stretched out from behind the cracks. Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he swung his sword.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted far away.

As soon as he stopped himself, the ground beneath his feet exploded apart, and the mountain behind him was obliterated!

Blood flowed from Yang Ye’s mouth!

Erya and Snowy’s expressions changed drastically. Both of them hurriedly went over to Yang Ye while worry covered Snowy’s face.

Yang Ye was about to speak when a strand of blood sprayed from his mouth. After spitting out a few mouthfuls of blood, Yang Ye gazed at Snowy, “D-Didn’t you say that I could win?”

Snowy blinked and waved her paws. She was asking him if he really couldn’t win?

Yang Ye’s face darkened, “My little lord, can’t you even figure that out?”
