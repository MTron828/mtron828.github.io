Chapter 1843 – It Is A Threat!

He wanted to experience Yang Ye’s strength for himself!

Yang Ye glanced at the black robed man, and the black robed man said, “The people of this world are fond of spreading rumors, so I think…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye slammed his fist forward.

Nothing happened after Yang Ye launched the punch.

However, the black robed man’s figure stiffened on the spot.

He gazed at Yang Ye with a slightly blank expression in his eyes, “You…”

However, Yang Ye ignored him and vanished into the boundless reaches of space.

Meanwhile, a black talisman suddenly floated out of the black robed man, “Don’t search for him, don’t ever…”

As soon as he finished speaking…

The black robed man’s figure became ethereal, and it only took a moment for him to vanish as if he’d never been there.

Three breaths of time later, a middle aged man with a long brush in his hand appeared where the black robed man had been.

The middle aged man glanced at the talisman above him and tapped it. A moment later, the black robed man’s voice came from it.

The middle aged man glanced at the surroundings, “What happened?”

A short while later, the middle aged man crushed a talisman.

Around 15 minutes later, the space in front of him trembled slightly, and then a voice came from there, “Use the Hunters of the Night and continue searching for him.”

The middle aged man crushed a talisman and said, “He’s not ordinary!”

A few breaths of time later, a voice came, “When has our Heaven’s Net ever feared anyone?”

The middle aged man fell silent.

Meanwhile, the voice resounded again, “Calligrapher, if we reject the agreement, we’ll have to return two times the price paid, and it’ll affect our reputation too.”

The middle aged man nodded slightly, “Send three Hunters of the Night to me.”

The voice asked, “You’re going to do it yourself?”

The Calligrapher replied, “I'd like to take a look at this new genius who dared to kill members of the Night Assassins!”

“Good.” The voice continued, “They’ll be there in 15 minutes.”

The surroundings fell silent.

The Calligrapher glanced at the surroundings, and then he waved his brush towards the space before him.

Om!

The space there trembled violently, and then it became slightly translucent. At the same time, a faint mark could be seen on the expanse of translucent space. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Yang Ye had left it behind when he left!

As he gazed at the marks, the Calligrapher frowned slightly, “Such speech….”

…

Yang Ye didn’t worry too much about Heaven’s Net, and he started searching for another dead planet.

Even though he wanted to train in the Primordial Pagoda, it wouldn’t allow him to destroy the world within it, and it would definitely give him a good beating if he tried.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to find a dead planet.

Boom!

He punched with all his might!

On a planet like this which was completely devoid of life, Yang Ye could exert his strength without any worries. He didn’t damage the space around him and merely destroyed the ground. So, every single punch of his caused a mushroom cloud to shoot up into the air.

Mushroom clouds rose incessantly, and the ground below was collapsing without end.

Explosive power!

He’d been training his control previously. Control of his energy to hit space and people. Yet now, he was training his explosive power. Conquering all things with brute strength represented that when one’s strength attained a certain level, all techniques were useless before it.

However, it required tremendous strength.

Now, he was madly unearthing the strength within him.

Yang Ye stood on the ground with his fists clenched tightly, and he looked down at his right arm. At this moment, he was able to fully control the strength within the Wargod’s arm, and he didn’t need the talisman to seal it anymore.

It didn’t take long for an ethereal beast to appear on his right arm.

The Ancient Spirit Python!

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Ye slammed his right fist down.

Bang!

The ground in an area of 300km collapsed, and the deep hole beneath him was still collapsing downwards.

Yang Ye glanced at the Ancient Spirit Python. Needless to say, its strength was quite useful. Because that punch had clearly been much stronger than before.

Suddenly, Hou Qing said, “You’re about done now.”

Yang Ye asked, “We’re not training anymore?”

Hou Qing replied, “You’re at the limits of your body. While you can still improve yourself through training, it’ll make your strength surpass your own limits, and that’ll be harmful to your body. So, you must wait for your cultivation to improve before continuing your training of the body. Remember that besides the body, a person’s realm of cultivation is one’s foundation. Because improving your cultivation will improve yourself, and then will allow you to unearth even more of your potential!”

“I understand!” Yang Ye nodded and asked, “Can I defeat the Night Emperor now?”

“It’ll be difficult!” Hou Qing replied, “However, he’ll find it very difficult to kill you now. But don’t think about killing him now because even defeating him is difficult for you. After all, the gap between your cultivations is quite huge. I know you’re able to surmount your realm of cultivation to do battle, but he was definitely an extraordinary genius in the past, so he can do the same. Understand what I’m trying to say?”

Yang Ye replied, “I do. Don’t worry, I won’t go head-on against him for now.”

The Night Emperor wasn’t alone, and he had the Night Assassins. Moreover, because he had the wooden sword, the experts throughout Heaven Pillar Mountain were targeting him. So, if he fought the Night Emperor to the point both sides were heavily injured, it would only benefit others.

The Night Emperor wasn’t the only Quasi Enlightened Realm expert in Heaven Pillar Mountain!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, glanced at the surroundings, and said, “Since I’m here, I’ll just blast it apart before leaving!”

He clenched his right fist and slammed it down.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Deafening explosions started resounding once more on the planet. At the same time, mushroom clouds shot up incessantly.

A day later, Yang Ye left the planet. No, the planet was actually gone.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and was about to leave. However, he suddenly looked towards the right, “Show yourself!”

As soon as he said that, the space not too far away on his right trembled, and then a man with a brush appeared before him.

It was the Calligrapher from Heaven’s Net!

There were three black shadows behind the Calligrapher. They had a curved saber hanging on their waists, and every single one of them had a longbow and quiver on their backs.

They seemed very strange because their figures were flickering. They existed for a moment, vanished a moment later, and appeared again. Moreover, they didn’t have an aura at all!

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “Do you need something?”

The Calligrapher gazed at Yang Ye for a short moment and shook his head, “No, we’re just passing by.” He’d watched as a planet vanished from before his eyes just now, and then Yang Ye emerged after it vanished.

Yang Ye nodded and turned around with the intent of leaving. However, he seemed to have thought of something and stopped.

The corners of the Calligrapher’s eyes twitched at the sight of this, and he tightened his grip on his brush.

Yang Ye turned around to look at the Calligrapher, “If I’m not wrong, you’re from that group, Heaven’s Net, right?”

The Calligrapher replied, “Yes!”

Yang Ye asked, “The Heaven’s Net is searching for me?”

The Calligrapher nodded, “The Night Emperor paid us to use all our forces to find you!”

Yang Ye asked, “Then what do you plan to do now that you’ve found me?”

The Calligrapher gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he replied, “Go back and try my best to make the organization refund the sale.”

Yang Ye glanced at him, “Can we work together?”

The Calligrapher thought for a moment and shook his head, “Not for now. Because we haven’t refunded the sale, so we’re still enemies until that’s done.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Help me give a message to your leader. This is between me and the Night Assassins, so it’s best if you don’t interfere!”

Suddenly, one of the black shadows behind the Calligrapher asked, “Are you threatening us?”

Yang Ye gazed at the black shadow, “I am, and what are you going to do about it?”

The black shadow was about to speak when the Calligrapher suddenly berated him, “Shut up!”

The black shadow instantly fell silent.

The Calligrapher gazed at Yang Ye, “I’ll send your message!”

Yang Ye nodded and vanished into the distance.

Once Yang Ye left, the Calligrapher visibly relaxed.

Pressure!

The pressure he felt from Yang Ye was too strong. Besides pressure from Yang Ye’s aura, it also included mental pressure.

“How strong is he?!” The Calligrapher had a solemn expression on his face, “We made a mistake. We agreed to do this before investigating his strength in detail…” He looked towards the distance and continued, “If those stubborn old fellows refuse to refund the sale, then we’re probably going to suffer heavy losses!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot with the three shadows.

After they left, a figure appeared where they had been standing. It was Yang Ye.

If it was a competition of skill in concealment, then Yang Ye was an expert amongst experts. Especially when he had the Sword Domain, even Quasi Enlightened Realm experts wouldn’t be able to notice his presence!

Yang Ye gazed at the direction they left towards, thought for a moment, and then followed them.

Since Heaven’s Net had actually been able to find him, it represented that they could locate Blind Maiden and the others. So, he had to resolve this in person!

Just like that, Yang Ye followed them without making a sound and arrived in a mountain range.
