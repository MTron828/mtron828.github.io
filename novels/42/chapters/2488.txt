Chapter 2489 – Act!

Everyone here was stunned!

Especially the other Outer Court Disciples who’d been standing behind the man!

As for the most shocked, it was Yue Qingwu because the young man in Yang Ye’s grasp was an actual True World Realm expert!

A True World Realm expert hadn’t even been able to fight back against a True Void Realm expert?

Yang Ye looked the young man in the eyes, “Why aren’t you laughing?”

He squeezed down even more as he spoke.

At this moment, how could the young man even laugh? He was on the verge of death! His face was terrifyingly pale!

“Ye Yang!” Meanwhile, an Outer Court Disciple spoke angrily, “That’s Senior Brother Xu Fan, you…”

That Outer Court Disciple hadn’t even finished speaking when Yang Ye slammed the man into the ground.

Bang!

The ground cracked open while blood sprayed!

Yang Ye patted his hands together and looked up at the Outer Court Disciple who’d just spoken, “What did you just say? I didn’t hear you properly! Why don’t you repeat that again?”

That Outer Court Disciple’s face was quite unsightly. He mustered up the courage to repeat himself, but he immediately discarded that thought when he saw the terrible state Xu Fan was in.

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and looked at Xu Fan who’d stood up now. The first thing Xu Fan did upon standing up was to draw his sword!

He swung it!

Such a terrible humiliation had made his mind lose clarity.

Under normal circumstances, he should apologize because anyone could discern that the man before him wasn’t someone he could go against.

But at this moment, Xu Fan’s mind was filled with rage and was utterly devoid of clarity!

Just like that, he was blasted away as soon as he drew his sword, and his figure flew over 1km away.

Xu Fan spat out multiple mouthfuls of blood as he flew while his body cracked open, inch by inch. It was just a tiny bit away from completely collapsing!𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

It was obvious how heavy Yang Ye’s attack had been!

Bang!

Xu Fan crashed to the ground. At this moment, his mind had cleared up completely.

He was no match for Yang Ye!

That was the conclusion he’d come to!

Yang Ye walked over to Xu Fan, and the others in the surroundings gazed at Yang Ye fearfully.

Yang Ye ignored them and looked down at Xu Fan, “No hatred is without reason, and it’s the same for conflict. So, tell me why you’ve come in search of trouble with me?”

Xu Fan stared at Yang Ye and remained silent!

Yang Ye grinned, “I’ll count to three. I’ll shatter your body if you don’t answer me!”

“Ye Yang!” One of the other Outer Court Disciples spoke abruptly, “That’s against the sect’s rules!”

Yue Qingwu spoke softly, “Brother Ya, the sect doesn’t prohibit sparring, but you can’t go too far. You’ll be expelled if you destroy his body!”

Expelled!

Yang Ye gazed at Xu Fan and smiled, “This is what you’re relying on? It’s fine, you can give it a try and see if I dare to shatter your body!”

Yang Ye raised three fingers!

Xu Fan was quite an unyielding person, and he remained silent even after Yang Ye had counter to two.

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, and then he kicked Xu Fan’s stomach.

Bang!

Xu Fan’s body instantly exploded apart!

It was gone!

His body was gone!

Everyone here was stunned, including Xu Fan. He was just a soul now, and he hadn’t expected the man before him would actually dare to destroy his body!

His body was gone!

Xu Fan’s mind had gone blank!

While his body could be rebuilt, and the Ancient Sword Sect had the treasures to assist with that, how long would it take? Moreover, having it shattered would affect him tremendously!

His future was gone!

It could be said that his future was truly gone!

Xu Fan’s face was covered in despair!

Yang Ye gazed at the other Outer Court Disciple, “You should know why he came to look for trouble with me, right?”

That Outer Court Disciple glanced at Yang Ye, hesitated for a moment, and said, “Senior Brother Lu Yunxian…”

Yang Ye asked, “He ordered this?”

That Outer Court Disciple shook his head, “Senior Brother Xu Fan knows that you sat at Senior Brother Lu Yunxian’s spot, so he came to look for trouble with you. H-He felt you had no right to sit there, so he wanted to teach you a lesson on behalf of Senior Brother Lu Yunxian!”

Yang Ye shook his head and chuckled. He gazed at Xu Fan who was just a soul now, “Are you in such a hurry to curry favor with him?”

Xu Fan stared at Yang Ye while resentment filled his eyes.

“You want revenge?” Yang Ye smiled and started walking slowly in Xu Fan’s direction.

Everyone here was shocked, and they wondered if the man before them planned to kill Xu Fan!

Suddenly, a middle aged man appeared before Yang Ye.

The Outer Court Disciples hurriedly bowed respectfully when they saw him, “Elder Kong Ming!”

Kong Ming!

One of the Outer Court Elders, and his job was to manage the Outer Court Disciples!

Kong Ming gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “Was it necessary to injure him this severely?”

Yang Ye said, “He’s the one who came looking for trouble!”

Kong Ming spoke coldly, “So you destroyed his body and want to kill him?”

Yang Ye replied, “Do you see his eyes? He will definitely seek revenge. If I don’t kill him now, he’ll stab me in the back another time. Don’t you think so too?”

Kong Ming gazed coldly at Yang Ye, “You’re all in the same sect, yet you don’t give any consideration to that. You’re not suited for my Outer Court. Do you understand what I mean?”

Yue Qingwu’s expression changed when she heard this. Kong Ming was planning on expelling Yang Ye!

The other Outer Court Disciples heaved sighs of relief. They felt it was best if someone like Yang Ye was kicked out!

Yang Ye chuckled, “Alright, since I’m not suited to be here, I’ll go to the Inner Court. That works, right?”

Kong Ming’s eyes narrowed slightly, “You think you’re very strong?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Elder Kong Ming, you must realize that I didn’t cause trouble here, it’s he who caused trouble. I was just defending myself! That isn’t wrong, isn’t it?”

Kong Ming laughed coldly, “You destroyed his body and wanted to kill him, yet you say your actions aren’t wrong? You’re amazing! I’m an Outer Court Elder, and I announce now that you, Ye Yang, are not a disciple of the Ancient Sword Sect anymore. If you’re still here in an hour from now, I’ll kill you myself!”

Yang Ye shrugged and gazed at Yue Qingwu, “Where’s the Inner Court’s test?”

She hesitated for a moment and replied, “At Inner Court Peak.”

She pointed into the distance while she spoke.

Yang Ye nodded, “Thank you!”

Once he finished speaking, Yang Ye walked off in that direction.

The other disciples were stunned by this.

Is he that audacious?

He doesn’t even fear an Outer Court Elder?

Kong Ming’s face was extremely gloomy. Suddenly, he clawed at Yang Ye from afar, causing the space around Yang Ye to warp.

The Four World Realm!

Kong Ming was at the Four World Realm!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He was on the verge of being unable to restrain his temper. Right when he was about to counterattack, a voice resounded, “Let him come!”

Kong Ming frowned, but he withdrew his attack a moment later.

Yang Ye glanced at Kong Ming and walked off.

Kong Ming fell silent on the spot for a long time, and then he followed Yang Ye. The others here did the same.

Inner Court Peak.

Yang Ye arrived at the test area to become an Inner Court Disciple, and he was greeted by a white-haired old man who was a Five World Realm expert. However, the old man was quite old, and his face was covered in wrinkles! Actually, it wasn’t difficult for experts at this level to alter their appearances. However, it depended on the person’s preference. Some preferred to let nature take its course and some preferred to stay young!

Behind Yang Ye was Kong Ming and numerous disciples from the Outer Court.

Yue Qingwu and Mo Yu were there too!

The white-haired old man glanced at Yang Ye, “Since you dared to act so fearlessly and showed no fear toward an Outer Court Elder, there are only two possibilities. Your backing is formidable, or you’re formidable! Of course, it may be both!”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “Thank you for giving me this opportunity, Senior!”

The old man shook his head, “You have this chance, but if you fail to pass the test, then I’ll destroy your body myself, and then I’ll let the Outer Court Elders deal with you.”

Yang Ye asked, “What if I pass it?”

The old man glanced at him, “Then you’ll be a disciple of the Inner Court, and Outer Court Elders can’t interfere in your business.”

Kong Ming’s face was quite unsightly.

Yang Ye smiled, “Then let’s begin!”

The old man replied indifferently, “It’s a very simple test. To be an Inner Court Disciple, you must be at the Limitbreaker Realm. Of course, if you’re not at the Limitbreaker Realm, possessing such strength in advance will make you even more welcome here in the Inner Court.”

As he spoke, he waved his right hand, and a huge cage appeared in the space around Yang Ye. The cage was made of unknown black metal, but it was ethereal. So, the people outside could still see what was happening within it.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and was quite puzzled. Suddenly, a powerful aura appeared before him, and then a huge demon beast arrived in front of him.

The demon beast was shaped like a wolf, completely dark violet, with a head like a lion and extremely long fangs that could touch the ground.

The demon beast’s eyes were filled with a ferocious glow and viciousness!

Someone outside the cage exclaimed, “It’s a Two World Realm demon beast, a Primal Lionwolf!”

The Two World Realm!

At this moment, the other Outer Court Disciples started to pity Yang Ye a little. After all, a demon beast’s strength far surpassed a human in the same realm of cultivation!

Of course, they took even more pleasure in Yang Ye’s misfortune!

In the cage, the old man glanced at Yang Ye, “Do you have a problem with this?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Of course he did. He was in quite a dilemma. How should he deal with this demon beast? Smash it down with a single punch? No, that would be too shocking for everyone here.

Draw out the battle until it ended with them being equally matched?

But he didn’t want to waste too much time!

It was difficult!

Truly a dilemma!

Suddenly, the Primal Lionwolf charged at him.

Yang Ye was about to attack when Sword Scroll’s voice resounded in his mind, “Act! You must put on an act!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
