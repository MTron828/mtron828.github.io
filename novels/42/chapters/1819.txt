Chapter 1820 – Go On!

More backup!

At this moment, Yang Ye’s eyes were filled with a vicious glow.

He had never intended to become enemies with the Night Assassins, but they didn’t want to let him go, and they were constantly sending experts to kill him.

This infuriated him!

Three more black robed old men appeared in the sky.

All of them were at the 6th stage of the True Realm! Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The old man who led the group glanced at the surroundings, and then his gaze descended upon Ye Ning, “Ye Ning, the wooden sword is so important, yet you didn’t notify the organization? What? You intend to take it for yourself?”

Ye Ning’s face turned cold, “Su Yuan, that isn’t really enough if you want to frame me.”

The old man called Su Yuan grunted coldly, and then he gazed at Yang Ye. Or to be more precise, he gazed at the wooden sword in Yang Ye’s grasp. There was undisguised greed in his eyes when he saw the wooden sword!

Suddenly, Yang Ye waved the wooden sword and said, “What? You want it?”

Su Yuan gazed at Yang Ye, “I do really want it. Why?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Come get it!”

Su Yuan gazed at Yang Ye for a moment and replied, “I’ll be right there!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure transformed into a black ray of light that shot towards Yang Ye. At the same time, a wave of boundless pressure enveloped Yang Ye, causing Yang Ye to be unable to dodge.

Yang Ye had never thought of dodging!

At the moment Su Yuan attacked, Yang Ye suddenly placed his right hand on his chest, and then a terrifying aura suddenly appeared here! After that, a ferocious beast appeared before Yang Ye.

It was Qiong Qi, of course!

Roar!

Qiong Qi roared.

Bang!

The powerful aura Su Yuan emanated was instantly blasted apart, and then Qiong Qi slammed his figure at Su Yuan.

Boom!

Everyone watched with astonishment as Su Yuan was blasted over 3km away.

“A ferocious beast!” Meanwhile, Ye Ning spoke fiercely while a trace of seriousness had appeared in his eyes. He wasn’t the only one who reacted like that, Su Yuan’s eyes had a trace of seriousness in it as well.

Qiong Qi felt threatening to them!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye leaped up onto Qiong Qi’s back, and then he patted Qiong Qi’s back lightly. Qiong Qi understood his intentions, and he immediately slammed his front legs down and vanished on the spot with Yang Ye on his back.

At the instant Qiong Qi vanished, a ray of light flashed. It was fine like a thread, and many hadn’t even been able to see it.

It was caused by extraordinary speed!

Su Yuan’s expression had changed drastically when Qiong Qi and Yang Ye vanished, and he overlapped his palms and slammed them forward.

Boom!

A beam of white light swept out from his palms, and Qiong Qi arrived before Su Yuan at the exact same time.

When Yang Ye’s sword came into contact with the white light, it instantly melted like snow in boiling oil. It vanished in an instant.

Meanwhile, an iron glove slammed against the tip of Yang Ye’s sword.

Bang!

The wooden sword shook violently, but Su Yuan had been blasted over 3km away. As soon as he stopped himself, he spat out a few mouthfuls of blood.

Surprise flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes as he sat on Qiong Qi’s back. He hadn’t expected his attack to be that strong.

No! It’s because of Qiong Qi!

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something and suddenly became quite excited.

Qiong Qi!

If he didn’t use the Grand Teleportation Technique, his speed couldn’t compete with Qiong Qi. But he could work together with Qiong Qi by executing Split Second while Qiong Qi supplied the speed and strength to execute it!

To be more precise, Qiong Qi would be providing the speed, and his strength and Qiong Qi’s strength would overlap! Under such circumstances, his Split Second’s strength would rise by countless times. Most importantly, he wouldn’t have to waste profound energy to raise his speed!

It was like killing two birds with one stone!

As soon as he thought up to this point, Yang Ye grew even more excited. A moment later, he patted Qiong Qi’s lightly. Qiong Qi understood and transformed into a ray of black light that vanished on the spot.

Hiss!

The space split apart where Yang Ye had been.

Boom!

At the same time, an explosion resounded, and then Su Yuan was blasted over 3km away. Moreover, the iron glove on his right fist had cracked open.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye and Qiong Qi vanished once more.

Su Yuan’s expression changed drastically, and he gazed at Ye Ning, “Are you still not going to help?”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure spun on the spot and a few dozen powerful energy palms flashed out. However, they were instantly sliced apart and obliterated upon coming into contact with Yang Ye’s sword.

Boom!

Su Yuan was blasted away again. This time, he flew over 1km away.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye and Qiong Qi were about to attack again, but Ye Ning and two other black robed old men suddenly appeared in front of them and attacked in unison. Yang Ye and Qiong Qi didn’t try to dodge, and then just shot forward.

Boom!

As soon as their attacks collided, the space in a huge area shook violently before cracking apart.

This time, Yang Ye and Qiong Qi were blasted around 300m back while Ye Ning’s group was blasted over 1km back.

Their strengths were at the top of the 6th stage of the True Realm, but it was still slightly insufficient when facing the combined strength of Yang Ye and Qiong Qi. After all, Yang Ye was using the wooden sword and the Wargod’s arm, so his strength wasn’t something that any ordinary 6th stage True Realm expert could compare to.

As for Qiong Qi, it was even more obvious. Qiong Qi’s strength was already comparable to a 6th stage True Realm expert, and not just any ordinary 6th stage True Realm expert either. So, the strength gained through the combination of his and Yang Ye’s strength was extremely terrifying.

Meanwhile, Ye Ning and the others had extremely solemn expressions on their faces. They hadn’t expected the combined strength of Yang Ye and that ferocious beast to be so terrifying.

Suddenly, Yang Ye and Qiong Qi vanished on the spot.

Ye Ning and the others’ expressions changed at the sight of this. They were about to take a defensive stance when Su Yuan’s expression suddenly changed drastically, and he hurriedly said, “Stop them!”

As soon as he gave the order, Su Yuan and the others vanished on the spot.

At this moment, Yang Ye and Qiong Qi had appeared at another battlefield which was over 10km away. Blood Maiden was fighting Ye Ming there.

Ye Ming’s expression changed drastically when Yang Ye and Qiong Qi vanished. At this moment, his hairs were standing on end, and he didn’t hesitate to try and leave. However, he was still a little too slow.

Hiss!

A ray of light suddenly flashed through his forehead, and then his body stiffened on the spot.

Blood slowly seeped out of Ye Ming’s forehead. In an instant, his face was covered in blood, and the color in his eyes gradually vanished.

Actually, it was difficult for Yang Ye to instantly kill Ye Ming without utilizing the Grand Teleportation Technique. Unfortunately, Ye Ming had been fighting Blood Maiden, so most of his attention had been on her, and Yang Ye had launched a surprise attack. So, Ye Ming had been caught off guard and was instantly killed by the combined strength of Yang Ye and Qiong Qi!

After he killed Ye Ming with a single attack, Yang Ye waved his right hand and stored Ye Ming’s corpse in the Primordial Pagoda. Meanwhile, Su Yuan, Ye Ning, and the others arrived before Yang Ye and Qiong Qi. However, Yang Ye and Qiong Qi ignored them and vanished on the spot again!

3,000km away!

Hiss!

A speck of cold light suddenly appeared before a 6th stage True Realm expert in front of Blind Maiden. An instant later, the 6th stage True Realm expert’s body stiffened on the spot, and then his corpse vanished on the spot!

An instant later, Yang Ye and Qiong Qi vanished on the spot again!

They were choosing the easy targets!

That was Yang Ye’s current objective!

Ye Ning and Su Yuan were much stronger than ordinary 6th stage True Realm experts. Even if he combined his strength with Qiong Qi, it was still difficult to kill them. So, he’d chosen to kill the easy targets.

Ye Ming and the others were clearly aware of Yang Ye’s plan, and they wanted to charge at Yang Ye. However, Blood Maiden and Blind Maiden obstructed them. Blood Maiden didn’t waste her breath and immediately waved her hands, causing an ocean of blood to slam towards Su Yuan’s group.

While Blood Maiden and Blind Maiden kept them busy, shrill cries resounded incessantly.

Instant kills!

Countless people watching from the shadows had extremely solemn expressions on their faces.

Because those 6th stage True Realm experts were being instantly killed in succession before the joint forces of Qiong Qi and Yang Ye!

Instant annihilation!

At this moment, countless people started to feel fear in their hearts!

Yang Ye was instantly killing 6th stage True Realm experts like he was cutting through pie!

At this moment, many people who wanted to target Yang Ye had abandoned any thoughts to do so.

Around ten breaths of time later, Yang Ye stopped.

He wasn’t the only one who’d stopped, Yang Lianshuang and the others had stopped as well, and then they surrounded Ye Ning, Su Yuan, and the other two old men.

At this moment, Su Yuan and the others had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces.

They’d been practically annihilated!

The Night Assassins had definitely suffered severe losses today! The four of them, especially Su Yuan, would definitely suffer even if they were able to survive this battle!

They remained silent for a moment, and then Su Yuan glanced at Yang Ye’s group, “From this moment onwards, we Night Assassins won’t stop until all of you are dead!”

“You won’t stop until we’re dead?” Yang Ye chuckled and said, “I’m so afraid!”

He glanced at the surroundings and spoke loudly, “I don’t offend unless offended, but if you offend me, I’ll kill you even if you’re the king of the world!”

“Is that so?” Suddenly, a voice came from the sky, “We Night Assassins are offending you, so….”

Om!

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded.

The Grand Teleportation Technique combined with Split Second and Qiong Qi!

It was the limit of Yang Ye’s strength and speed!

Everyone here was stunned. A moment later, they looked up into the sky, and Yang Ye was up there.

There was a gray robed middle aged man in front of Yang Ye. At this moment, the middle aged man’s body was stiff while his eyes were opened wide, and his eyes were filled with disbelief. Because there was a wooden sword between his brows.

Yang Ye pressed the wooden sword forward slightly, causing it to pierce through the middle aged man’s skin, and blood flowed from there.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “What did you want to say just now? Go on!”
