Chapter 2335 – Then Let’s Fight!

The statue cracked open and an ethereal figure appeared here.

It was a middle aged man in an embroidered robe. He was tall, and he carried a dignified air.

It was the founder of White Emperor City, White Emperor!

A long time passed before he opened his eyes slowly and looked up into the sky. His gaze seemed like it could see through the entire Eternal Border.

“Ancestor!” The city governor knelt down.

White Emperor withdrew his gaze and said, “Why has my White Emperor City fallen to such an extent?”

The city governor hesitated for a moment and replied, “We once had two extraordinary ancestors in our clan, but they had different thoughts and started to engage in internal strife…”

The city governor gradually explained what had happened many years ago.

“Internal strife!” White Emperor closed his eyes slowly, “Fools!”

The city governor didn’t dare to say anything in response. Both of them were his ancestors, so he had no right to judge them.

The White Emperor looked up into the sky, “Four True World Realms, and a World Lord. No, he hasn’t truly formed a world within himself, so he’s just half of it. A Half-Step World Lord! Interesting!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a white robed old man appeared before him.

The old man had a tiny “仙” character on his left chest.

The old man glanced at White Emperor and said, “Senior White Emperor, my Immortal Estate isn’t acting against White Emperor City, we just want Yang Ye. If you hand him over, we’ll leave immediately.”

While he was a Half-Step World Lord, he was nothing before the White Emperor who once commanded great power!

“Yang Ye?” White Emperor gazed at the city governor.

The city governor hesitated for a moment and said, “My daughter’s husband.”

A member of White Emperor City!

White Emperor looked at the old man, “White Emperor City may have fallen into decline, but it isn’t something just anyone can bully.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took a step forward, and the world shook violently. After that, an invisible wave of pressure slammed down upon the old man.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The space around the old man was suddenly ignited, and then strands of faint flames enveloped the old man.

In just an instant, the old man had instantly turned ethereal.

The old man was horrified, “Igniting the quintessence…”

As soon as he said that, a golden scale appeared above him, but it only took a moment for it to start burning.

However, the scale had emanated a ray of dazzling golden light that enveloped the old man. At the same time, the old man turned around and vanished into the sky.

White Emperor glanced at the burning scale. While it was burning, it hadn’t been harmed at all.

White Emperor spoke softly, “The Primal True Dragon… His luck isn’t bad to have obtained a scale of its.”

He looked up slowly as he spoke.

Meanwhile, some experts in the shadows vanished.

White Emperor closed his eyes slowly, “Show yourself!”

Bang!

A powerful aura suddenly surged out far away in the sky, and then the ethereal face of a middle aged man appeared there.

At the end of the sky, a face looked down at White Emperor and smiled, “I didn’t expect this trivial matter to alarm you, Brother White Emperor.”

“I’m quite curious myself!” White Emperor spoke softly, “What did this son-in-law of my White Emperor City do to make the former 2nd on the Divine Rankings show himself, Godless Heaven?”

Godless Heaven!

The city governor’s expression instantly changed when he heard White Emperor.

All those years ago, it was a name that everyone in Eternal Border knew! Hundreds of years ago, Godless Heaven had attained the World Lord Realm, and he was probably even stronger now.

Godless Heaven smiled, “Brother White Emperor, your son-in-law isn’t ordinary at all. He annihilated all the experts at the True Dao Realm and above from the six clans, and he even killed a True World Realm expert of my Immortal Estate with a single attack. His natural talent is something that even we can’t compare to. After all, he’s only at the Progenitor Realm right now!”

“A Progenitor killed a True World Realm expert?” White Emperor frowned slightly, and then he looked down at the city governor.

The latter nodded slightly.

A trace of interest appeared in White Emperor’s eyes, “Where is he? Let me take a look at him!”

The city governor replied solemnly, “A Half-Step World Lord heavily injured him, and he’s recuperating now.” He paused for a moment and continued, “That Half-Step World Lord was heavily injured and fled in defeat too.”

At this moment, the more outstanding Yang Ye was, the greater his chances to survive would be.

Because if Yang Ye was a useless piece of trash, then not to mention White Emperor, even he wouldn’t help. Saving a useless piece of trash by risking the entire White Emperor City? Only an idiot would do that!

White Emperor nodded slightly, “He sounds quite capable.”

He looked up at Godless Heaven, “I presume your Immortal Estate fears him, right?”

“Sort of!” Godless Heaven smiled, “We have to fear geniuses like him! Alright, let’s stop the chitchat. Our main bodies aren’t in this world, so it’s impossible for us to fight. How about you just hand him over, and my Immortal Estate will leave immediately. We won’t step foot into White Emperor City again, alright?”

Hand over Yang Ye and White Emperor City lives!

That was what Godless Heaven meant!

Meanwhile, Godless Heaven added, “Of course, if your main body comes here, my Immortal Estate will naturally leave. Unfortunately, your main body probably won’t come here at a time like this, right?”

White Emperor closed his eyes slowly.

The city governor’s face fell.

Obviously, White Emperor was giving it thought.

Protect Yang Ye?

If he could, he would naturally try to protect a genius like that. But could he? He’d only left a strand of his soul here, and driving away that old man from before could be said to be his limit. It could be said that if they had no other trump card, White Emperor City would be buried with Yang Ye!

If it was impossible to protect Yang Ye, yet he still insisted on doing so, then he would clearly be quite stupid.

A long time passed before White Emperor slowly opened his eyes again. He was about to speak when a young man in a green robe suddenly walked out slowly from a hall down below.

The man walked quite slowly, like an aged old man. There was a blood red saber in his right grasp.

The saber was being dragged against the ground!

Besides that, there was a gourd by his waist.

At this moment, everyone gazed at him.

It was none other than Yang Ye.

Not too far away within the hall, a woman was staring at Yang Ye’s back without blinking. She was Bai Zhixian.

The city governor glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent.

He’d done everything he could.

White Emperor sized up Yang Ye and asked, “You’re Yang Ye?”

Yang Ye stopped, looked up at White Emperor, and said, “Thank you for what you did just now. However, allow me to deal with the rest.”

“You?” White Emperor chuckled, “Young man, how will you deal with it? Do you know that there are at least three True World Realm experts and a Half-Step World Lord out there? Besides that, there are other hidden auras watching from the shadows. I presume all of them have you as their targets. I’m really curious, how will you deal with it?”

Yang Ye cracked a smile, “Then Senior, what do you think I should do?”

White Emperor shook his head, “There’s no answer to this situation, none at all. If my main body was here, there would be a chance. Unfortunately, it’s too, too far away.”

Yang Ye smiled, “No matter what, thank you for what you did earlier. Now, it’s my own business, so let me deal with it.”

Yang Ye walked slowly out of the city.

“Yang Ye!” Suddenly, a voice came from behind him.

It was Bai Zhixian.

Yang Ye stopped. He didn’t turn around and said, “Zhixian, you’ve done enough. Now, leave the rest to me. You must realize that protecting White Emperor City is your duty too. You can’t allow it to fall into a hopeless situation just for me.”

Yang Ye walked out of the city.

White Emperor closed his eyes slowly.

He didn’t stop Yang Ye.

If he were being honest, he quite admired Yang Ye’s actions. Being able to take responsibility like that at a time like this was what a true man would do. If his main body was here, he would definitely try to protect Yang Ye. But the problem was that his main body wasn’t here. So, taking action now would make no difference, and it would cause the destruction of White Emperor City instead. Because the Immortal Estate would have a just reason to annihilate them.

They feared him, but they were not terrified of him!

If it really came to it, Immortal Estate would definitely dare to slaughter White Emperor City. In the beginning, he thought it was just a small conflict, but now that he’d seen even Godless Heaven here, he knew that it wasn’t that simple.

It wasn’t that he refused to help, he couldn’t!

Just like that, Yang Ye walked out of White Emperor City while everyone watched him.

At the moment he stepped foot out of the city, countless divine senses locked onto him.

In the sky, Godless Heaven sized up Yang Ye and said, “A true young genius. How about we do this? If you’re willing to submit to my Immortal Estate and hand over the Primordial Axe of Creation, then I can allow bygones to be bygones. What do you think?”

Yang Ye looked up at him and smiled, “I think that a person should always keep their backs straight.”

He closed his eyes slowly at this point, “I, Yang Ye, would rather die standing than live on my knees.”

He suddenly opened his eyes at this point, and then he pointed his blood red saber at Godless Heaven, “If it’s a fight that the Immortal Estate wants, then a fight it shall have!”
