Chapter 2036 – Are You Surprised?

Yang Ye suddenly took a deep breath.

Snowy and Tian Xiu immediately gazed at him, and the small pagoda instantly transformed into a ray of golden light that vanished into the sky.

Snowy blinked. She didn’t really understand why the pagoda left.

Yang Ye stood up.

Huff!

A mouthful of foul air floated out from him.

Yang Ye looked down at his arms, and then he closed his eyes. Three breaths of time later, Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes, and then a huge ethereal white dragon appeared behind him.

At the same time, faint white light coiled around Yang Ye’s body. The white light was light armor that covered Yang Ye’s body!

He’d merged with the Sky Dragon!

At this moment, he’d merged completely with it. After he merged with it and was strengthened by it, his body had undergone a qualitative transformation. Currently, his body was much stronger than it had been.

It could be said that an ordinary Zen Realm expert would find it absolutely difficult to harm him!

Meanwhile, Snowy suddenly flew over to Yang Ye and started waving her claws swiftly.

It didn’t take long for a weird expression to appear on Yang Ye’s face, “You want to eat steamed buns?”

Snowy hurriedly nodded.

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Meanwhile, Snowy suddenly flew over to his shoulder, wrapped her paws around his neck, and rubbed her face against him.

Yang Ye chuckled, rubbed Snowy’s head, and said, “Isn’t it just steamed buns? You can have them to your heart’s content!”

Snowy’s chubby face was immediately covered with a brilliant smile.

After playing with Snowy and Tian Xiu for a while, Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda.

Meanwhile, a woman appeared in the cave.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “You’re here!”

She nodded, “I’ve been here for a day. I didn’t disturb you because I noticed you were cultivating!”

It was Yang Lianshuang.

Yang Ye had notified her and asked her to come here before he started cultivating. He had no other way to deal with the Spirit Ape Clan, but he knew that Yang Lianshuang would definitely have an idea. She was no ordinary person, so she was definitely doing something in the Human Dimension.

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang said, “They have to leave the Demon Dimension!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Do you have a place in mind that they can go to?”

Yang Lianshuang grinned, “Of course. Moreover, I need them. Giving them a place to stay won’t be a problem, but what about you? Where do you plan to go?”

“Me?” Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he smiled, “I plan to travel to the Weapon Path.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“The Weapon Path!” Yang Lianshuang frowned, “You’re already planning to get swept into fights at that level?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “It can’t be helped. That fellow threw me in a trap, so I have to go.”

Yang Lianshuang nodded and said, “Right, based on the information I received recently, it seems like something major is about to happen. It may even be linked to the four top clans!”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “The main reason is the god race!”

“The god race!” Yang Lianshuang’s pupils constricted slightly, “What do you mean?”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Lianshuang, don’t tell anyone about what I’m about to tell you. Just make preparations yourself. The god race has shown themselves, and they are coming for revenge. When the time comes, all the races will have no peace. You must be careful and avoid getting swept into it. Even if you are swept into it, don’t let yourself become someone else’s sacrifice. Understand?”

He’d decided to tell her about it. Because he was afraid that she would be caught off guard when the god race attacked.

Yang Lianshuang spoke in a low voice, “I see!”

Yang Ye said, “Just be careful. If it’s necessary, you can contact me, or Nether Maiden’s group. I’m sure that they’ll help you too.”

“You should worry about yourself!” Yang Lianshuang smiled, “You’re famous throughout the large universe right now, and countless people wish to kill you!”

Yang Ye smiled and didn’t say anything in response.

Meanwhile, Black Ape walked in.

Yang Ye said, “Senior, this is a friend of mine, you can trust her. Take the others and go with her. She’ll make arrangements for all of you.”

Black Ape nodded slightly, and then slight hesitation appeared on his face.

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

Black Ape said, “I know that my request is a little too much, but I still want to ask. Young Brother, your future is limitless, and you’ll definitely be extraordinary in the future. If you have the ability, please save my ancestor in the future!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I will.”

Black Ape was slightly stunned. He hadn’t expected Yang Ye to agree so easily!

Yang Ye said, “Brother Monkey and I can be considered to be friends. Since something has happened to him, it’s only right that I lend him a hand. Of course, I’m naturally no match for the Buddhist Path right now, and going would be no different than giving my life away. But don’t worry, if I have the ability in the future, I’ll definitely lend him a hand.”

Yang Ye chuckled and continued, “Actually, you don’t have to worry. I’m certain the Buddhist Path won’t be able to trap someone like Brother Monkey for a long time. Moreover, he doesn’t seem like a fool, so you should be a little more optimistic!”

Black Ape nodded, “No matter what, thank you!”

Yang Ye replied, “Now, let’s set out immediately. The faster we leave this place, the better!”

“I’ll go make the arrangements!” Black Ape left once he finished speaking.

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang suddenly said, “I want to ask Qingshi and the others to help me!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Huh?”

She grinned and said, “I’ve made an organization in the Human Dimension, and I need some people to help me manage it. Qingshi and the others are well suited for that. What do you think?”

Yang Ye was quite hesitant because he was worried about their safety.

Yang Lianshuang added, “You don’t have to worry about their safety. I don’t plan to do anything that’ll shock the world, so no one will pay attention to them. Moreover, staying with me is definitely much safer than staying with you. Right?”

Yang Ye replied, “I want to ask their opinion about it!”

She replied, “Of course!”

After chatting for a while, Yang Lianshuang left.

Yang Ye sat down cross-legged and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

A day later.

Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang led a group of demon beasts away from Spirit Monkey Mountain. Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang led the group while Qiong Qi followed from the sky.

Yang Ye had asked Qiong Qi to escort them because his intuition told him that their journey may not be that safe.

It didn’t take long for them to arrive at the border between the Demon Dimension and the Human Dimension.

Thousand Mile Mountain!

Thousand Mile Mountain was the border between the Human Dimension and Demon Dimension. As for why it was called Thousand Mile Mountain, it was because the mountain range was practically boundless.

It was one of the forbidden areas for humans because if any human entered the Demon Dimension without authorization, that person would definitely stay forever in the Demon Dimension.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye’s group to stop.

A middle aged man had appeared not too far ahead, and it was Demon King Xiao Tian!

“I’m here to send all of you off!” Xiao Tian spoke indifferently, “You don’t mind, right?”

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi appeared not too far away from Xiao Tian, “Xiao Tian, don’t go too far, and it may save your life. After all, that monkey isn’t dead. So, what if he comes back?”

Xiao Tian replied, “Qiong Qi, who doesn’t understand that? The problem is that since I’ve chosen my side, I can only go on this path until the end. Right?”

Qiong Qi spoke in a low voice, “You can’t stop us!”

Xiao Tian nodded, “I’m naturally incapable of that while you’re here, Qiong Qi. However…”

“What if you include us?” Suddenly, a voice resounded, and then a robust bearded man appeared before them. Besides him, there was an old man with a long beard.

Black Ape’s face fell at the sight of this.

Demon kings!

Two more demon kings!

Qiong Qi glanced at the robust man and said, “Earth Dragon.” He gazed at the old man and continued, “Grand Roc! What? Both of you plan to get mixed up in this too?”

Earth Dragon spoke indifferently, “Qiong Qi, allow me to be honest. You can’t keep them safe. A Buddhist Progenitor took action, so that monkey will never come back alive. If you’re sensible, you’ll leave now, and we won’t make a fuss about it. Otherwise, this mountain range will probably become your grave!”

“My grave?” A wisp of viciousness flashed through Qiong Qi’s eyes, “Earth Dragon, I wonder who gave you the confidence to dare act so arrogantly before me. If you have the ability, come fight me one on one. Do you dare?”

Earth Dragon’s face turned quite unsightly when he heard Qiong Qi. One on one?

Amongst the 12 demon kings of the demon race, there were definitely those who were capable of defeating Qiong Qi, but there were no more than three existences like that, and that was while the monkey was excluded. Because while the monkey was considered a demon king, he hadn’t obtained the acknowledgement of the entire demon race. However, based on his temper, he had no need for the acknowledgement of others!

“Qiong Qi!” Meanwhile, Xiao Tian suddenly said, “We don’t want to become enemies with you, so why become enemies with us for a human? Leave and we’ll all coexist peacefully. Isn’t that good?”

Qiong Qi grunted coldly, “Cut the crap. Since you want to stop us, then just come at me. I too would like to find out if I’ve grown stronger in these years!”

Xiao Tian nodded, and then he gazed at Earth Dragon and Grand Roc, “I’ll leave him to you. That’s not a problem, right?”

“Of course!” Both of them nodded and charged at Qiong Qi.

As for Xiao Tian, he gazed at Yang Ye, “Actually, my true mission is to kill you.”

Yang Ye asked, “Who gave the order?”

Xiao Tian smiled, “What? You can’t figure it out?”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Aren’t those from the Buddhist Path supposed to be benevolent?”

Xiao Tian shook his head, “They say you’ve killed too many, and you’ve committed too much sin. Killing you will bring blessings to the world!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Even I can only admit my inferiority before such thick skin!”

Xiao Tian grinned, “Come! I’ll send you off!”

Xiao Tian was about to attack once he finished speaking, and Yang Ye was about to counterattack as well.

Suddenly, a figure descended before Yang Ye, and that person placed his palm on Yang Ye’s shoulder and said, “Are you surprised?”

Yang Ye gazed at the person with astonishment, “You…”
