Chapter 1809 – I’ll Kill Anyone Who Tries To Take It From Me!

The old men immediately gazed at the saber-wielding old man upon hearing Yang Ye.

Their gazes were hostile!

Meanwhile, the saber-wielding old man spoke solemnly, “Kid, don’t play such tricks with me. I….”

Suddenly, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that shot at the saber-wielding old man.

The old man’s face sank, and he flipped his palm. In an instant, countless rays of saber energy descended like a storm upon Yang Ye. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Boom!

An explosion resounded and Yang Ye was blasted over 10km away.

The old man, who was about to launch another attack, was stunned when he saw this. Yang Ye shouldn’t be that weak!

Pu!

Meanwhile, a few mouthfuls of blood sprayed from Yang Ye while his countenance turned pale. He seemed so weak.

The saber-wielding old man was quite stunned at this moment.

That’s not how Yang Ye’s strength is!

What the heck is he doing?

Suddenly, Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and said, “I’ll make you pay a hundredfold for taking my sword!”

As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around and vanished into space.

The old man was stunned and spoke angrily, “You think you can escape?”

He was about to attack as he spoke, but the other two old men suddenly obstructed his path.

The old man in a luxurious robe stared at the saber-wielding old man, “The sword!”

The white haired old man on the right didn’t speak, but his aura had locked onto the saber-wielding old man.

The saber-wielding old man spoke solemnly, “I don’t have it!”\

Both the old men gazed at the saber-wielding old man in silence, but their eyes were filled with doubt.

The saber-wielding old man’s face fell, “This is that kid’s trick. It’s still with him. If you chase after him now, you may be able to catch up to him. Otherwise, once he conceals himself, none of you will be able to find him!”

The old man in a luxurious robe spoke indifferently, “Chase him so you can escape, right?”

The saber-wielding old man glanced at them, “I’ll say it one last time. The sword isn’t in my possession!”

The old man in a luxurious robe laughed coldly, “Yang Ye is clearly not a match for you, so your strength is entirely sufficient to take the sword from him. Besides that, if it was in his possession, why didn’t he use it? I’ll ask you one last time. Hand it over and we’ll let you leave. Otherwise, you can leave your life behind!”

At this moment, he finally understood why Yang Ye had put on such a weak display just now.

Yang Ye was throwing him into a trap!

The saber-wielding old man fell silent for a few breaths of time and said, “Alright, I’ll give it to you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a ferocious glow flashed in his eyes, and then he grabbed his saber with both hands and swung it horizontally.

A powerful wave of saber energy flashed out.

Meanwhile, the expressions of both the other old men changed slightly.

Boom!

A terrifying wave of energy erupted. Both old men were blasted over 300m away, and the saber-wielding old man was gone.

“Chase him!” As soon as the old man in a luxurious robe finished speaking, both of them vanished on the spot.

Not long after the three of them left, a man silently appeared here. It was Yang Ye who’d left just a while ago.

A smile curled up on the corner of Yang Ye’s mouth as he gazed at the direction they’d vanished towards.

Suddenly, his expression changed because a woman appeared out of thin air before him. She’d just appeared abruptly.

He recognized her. It was the woman in a red dress from Moment Mountain.

She said, “You seem quite self-satisfied?”

Yang Ye tightened his grip on his sword and replied, “How did you find me?!”

She was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly raised his sword and swung it. A ray of brilliant sword energy flashed.

She waved her hand slightly, and a ray of red light flashed. The red light instantly tore open Yang Ye’s sword energy. But Yang Ye’s figure had vanished.

She looked up, and then she vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye suddenly stopped moving a huge distance away from where he had been earlier. It was because someone had appeared before him.

It was the woman in a red dress!

She sized up Yang Ye and spoke indifferently, “You can try to continue running!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and replied, “Go on, tell me what you want. If it’s the sword, then just forget it and do your worst!”

She replied, “Do you still not understand? Your current strength isn’t sufficient to keep it. Hand it over and you won’t be in any more trouble. Understand?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course I understand that. But it can’t be helped, I don’t want to live like that. It’s mine. Why should I give it to them just because they want it? What if I do give it to them, but they want even more from me? Should I give everything to them as well? Or perhaps they want my life. Should I bare my neck and let them chop my head off?”

Yang Ye shook his head and continued, “It’s mine, so it’s mine. I’ll kill anyone who tries to take it from me.”

She gazed at him for a long time before she said, “You have quite the temper.”

Yang Ye said, “You’re an ancient cultivator, so I think that your own strength should be sufficient to overcome the barrier without the wooden sword, right?”

She looked him in the eyes, “That barrier was jointly created by the old man in Daoist robes and some other powerful cultivators. It’s so terrifying that it’s beyond your imagination. Of course, it isn’t that difficult for me. However, the true terrifying thing about Heaven Pillar Mountain isn’t the barrier. So, I don’t want to waste too much strength on the barrier!”

“The barrier isn’t the most terrifying thing?” Yang Ye frowned, “There’s something even more terrifying on Heaven Pillar Mountain?” Needless to say, he was quite curious. Her strength was absolutely terrifying, but he hadn’t expected Heaven Pillar Mountain to have something that even she feared.

She turned to look towards the distance. It was the direction of Heaven Pillar Mountain. She fell silent for a long time before she said, “You’ll find out in the future.”

Yang Ye’s face darkened. She’s actually trying to keep me guessing!

Meanwhile, the woman gazed at him, “Less than two months are left before the barrier weakens. At that time, everyone with the strength to try will head over there. All the experts of the medium universe will be converging there, and you’ll be their enemy. I’m sure you know why. So, are you really not going to hand it over?”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “I refuse!”

She nodded slightly, “Then good luck.”

Yang Ye asked, “What? You’re not going to fight me for it?”

She glanced at him, “See you in Heaven Pillar Mountain!” She vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and there was a trace of bewilderment in his eyes. There’s something strange about her!

Yang Ye shook his head, restrained his thoughts, and vanished on the spot.

…

Presently, the medium universe could be said to be a little unusual. Because countless mysterious experts were rushing towards a single direction.

It was Heaven Pillar Mountain.

Besides that, all of them were inquiring about Yang Ye’s whereabouts.

A sword had once descended from the large universe, and it had pierced through the barrier. Simply speaking, it could help them through the barrier. Yet now, it was in Yang Ye’s possession.

Find Yang Ye!

Countless people were looking for him!

At this moment, Yang Ye was on the way to Heaven Pillar Mountain. Needless to say, it was like walking into a mountain which one knew was inhabited by a tiger.

But he had no other choice.

If he didn’t go to Heaven Pillar Mountain, the old geezers there would definitely search for the Yang Clan like mad dogs, and then use everything they could use to force him to show himself. Since that was the case, it was better to just go to Heaven Pillar Mountain and put an end to it all.

He wanted them to know that he was in Heaven Pillar Mountain, and they didn’t have to look for him!

Two days later.

Yang Ye suddenly stopped because a faint yet powerful pressure was coming from an area in space. It felt very heavy to him.

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then released his intents. As soon as that happened, he felt slightly better and continued forward. However, he hadn’t gone far before he stopped again. It was because the pressure had grown stronger. At this moment, even breathing was quite difficult for him.

Yang Ye flipped his palm and a map appeared in his grasp.

It was the path to Heaven Pillar Mountain that Nether Maiden had given to him. A short while passed before he looked towards the distance, “No wonder. I’m almost there!”

He fell silent for a while, and then he descended to the ground.

He couldn’t fly anymore because he would be too obvious!

Even though he’d come to Heaven Pillar Mountain, he didn’t want to immediately face countless old geezers.

He intended to act shamelessly.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. The area was completely barren. There were no signs of life, and there was only desolation.

Yang Ye withdrew the map, glanced at it, and continued forward.

At this moment, he was wearing a black robe, and it was naturally to avoid being recognized by others!

After walking for around two hours, Yang Ye suddenly stopped, and then a ray of cold light shot towards his throat.

Yang Ye’s face fell, and he slammed his fist forward.

Boom!

A muffled explosion resounded, and then a figure was blasted out of space.

Yang Ye was about to attack again, but he was stunned when he saw who it was.

“It’s you!” There was a trace of surprise in Yang Ye’s voice.
