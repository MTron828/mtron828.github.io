Chapter 2488 – Go on! Laugh!

Many laughed when they heard Yang Ye.

Reason?

It naturally existed in this world, but the preconditioning for reasoning with others was strength. Because at most times, the strong would never reason with the weak! Just like how a human would never reason with a pig, right?

Survival of the fittest!

It was vividly displayed by humans!

Elder Xin gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “You’re either an idiot or an extraordinary genius.”

He shot off on his sword once he finished speaking.

Once Elder Xin left, everyone gazed at Yang Ye. They clearly seemed to take pleasure in his misfortune, but they were also curious. Of course, most of them were taking pleasure in his misfortune.

The first person to break a taboo would always receive strange gazes from others.

Yang Ye ignored them and left.

Yue Qingwu hesitated for a moment and followed Yang Ye.

She glanced at him and said, “We should keep a low profile.”

Yang Ye smiled, “You think I’m not?”

She nodded, “Absolutely!”

Yang Ye chuckled and said, “Miss Qingwu, I don’t agree with you. Alright, forget that. I have other things to do, so farewell.”

Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

She stopped on the spot and lowered her head slightly in deep thought. No one knew what she was thinking.

A long time passed before she sighed softly and left.

…

Yang Ye went to the mountain range behind the sect. It was part of the sect’s territory, and there were powerful demon beasts here. However, these demon beasts were being fostered by the Ancient Sword Sect itself, or they could be considered as subordinates of the sect.

After searching for a long time, Yang Ye found a quiet place and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Cultivation!

Now, he used every moment he had to cultivate, both in the Sword Domain and flying swords.

He wanted to make the best use of his Sword Domain, or to be more precise, he wanted to bring out the most from it.

Especially the ability to analyze his opponent’s flaws with the Sword Domain. He wanted to cultivate it to the extreme. So long as his enemy didn’t destroy the Sword Domain, he was invincible within it!Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Of course, there were special circumstances, like An Nanjing and Erya. He didn’t know how strong An Nanjing was, and Erya’s body was so abnormal that she was practically invincible against those in the same realm of cultivation.

Fortunately, they were on his side!

At the world in the 1st level, Yang Ye stood on the spot. The dragon and Oxxy were in front of him.

Yang Ye gazed at them and said, “Attack me together!”

Oxxy was quite hesitant, but it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to say, “If you don’t use your full strength, I’ll tell Snowy and Erya that you were talking behind their backs. I’m sure you know that they’ll believe me, right?”

Oxxy discarded his hesitance completely, and he just raised his axe and charged at Yang Ye.

At this moment, he just wanted to chop Yang Ye to death!

The dragon leaped up and slammed itself at Yang Ye as well.

Yang Ye stared at them. At this moment, he was using space to clearly sense their flaws and intentions! Especially Oxxy, he was full of flaws.

If it was a life and death battle, he could take Oxxy’s head before Oxxy’s axe even descended. As for the dragon, it was very fast and powerful, but it was using space to propel itself forward! Moreover, its weak point was the reverse scale, and Yang Ye had deduced at least three ways to strike that reverse scale at the instant the dragon had attacked!

However, Yang Ye didn’t attack!

Once he finished analyzing everything, he knew he could crush them with ease. So, at this moment, their speed started to slow down in his mind.

Actually, it was the Sword Domain that helped improve his instinct in battle!

Time trickled by, and it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to attack.

Flying swords!

His flying sword could simply be described as coming and going like a shadow within the Sword Domain. His flying swords weren’t really flying within his Sword Domain, they were teleporting through the space within the Sword Domain. It could be said that they had merged into one with space because of him!

In the Sword Domain, Three-Dimensional Space was completely within his control!

Oxxy and the dragon were gradually incapable of fighting back. It was an absolutely aggrieving battle to them. Because they were constantly being forced into a passive position and weren’t even able to touch Yang Ye’s clothes!

A short while later, they seemed to have noticed something, and they stopped attacking Yang Ye and moved their attention to his Sword Domain instead!

Destroy the Sword Domain!

Brute force!

As Oxxy and the dragon started to attack it violently, Yang Ye’s countenance instantly turned pale. He didn’t attack again and just dispersed the Sword Domain. After that, he gazed at them and laughed bitterly.

Once the Sword Domain was gone, his ability to analyze them vanished. Because he couldn’t just use space alone to sense everything about them.

Besides that, there was another critical claw, and it was that he had to end the fight quickly when he fought powerful opponents within the Sword Domain. Otherwise, if his opponent attacked the Sword Domain, it would cause grave harm to him, harm to his soul!

Actually, at the moment they wanted to destroy the Sword Domain, he could have struck a lethal strike on both of them. However, their actions allowed him to realize a flaw in his Sword Domain.

But it was normal because there was nothing truly perfect!

Yang Ye left, and Oxxy and the dragon heaved sighs of relief. They were truly afraid of Yang Ye!

Yang Ye was a terrifying threat to them!

It made them wonder if all humans were so shameless!

…

At the Ascension Platform, Yang Ye found Sword Scroll.

Sword Scroll suddenly said, “You must become an Elite Disciple!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Sword Scroll spoke solemnly, “Only Elite Disciples can enter the most secret place in the Ancient Sword Sect, the Ancient Sword Cave. It’s where the Ancient Sword Sect’s founder fell, and it’s the most mysterious place in the sect. My main body is there too. It’s protected by extraordinary experts, so you must enter openly, and that’s the only way for you to obtain the fragments of my main body.”

An Elite disciple!

Yang Ye had quite the headache, “It’s too troublesome. I don’t want to waste too much time here. Do you have any other ideas?”

She replied indifferently, “Take it by force? Want to try that?”

Force!

Yang Ye laughed embarrassedly. He knew it was impossible because he didn’t want to be hunted! Moreover, he may not even be able to succeed!

Sword Scroll said, “Based on your natural talent and strength, it won’t take long for you to succeed. Besides that, if my main body is restored, then if it’s combined with your Sword Domain, I dare guarantee that you can even annihilate Five World Realm experts in an instant! Even Lord Realm experts would be easily killed!”

Yang Ye was excited, “Is it that strong?”

Sword Scroll replied indifferently, “The spirits of the Demon Wings of Death and Executor are either in deep sleep or unconscious from a severe injury. But I’m different, my spirit is whole. So, if my main body is restored, you will truly possess a Super Divine Treasure, one with its spirit intact. That’s a completely different thing.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

He naturally understood what she meant. Executor couldn’t unleash its full strength right now, and its spirit hadn’t acknowledged him as its master, nor would it try to assist him in battle. But Sword Scroll was different. If her main body was restored, she would help him. The full support of a Super Divine Treasure combined with his own identity as a sword cultivator would allow him to unleash absolutely extraordinary strength!

A short while later, Yang Ye shook his head and chuckled, “Sword Scroll, you’re afraid I wouldn’t retrieve those fragments for you, right?”

She glanced at him and remained silent.

Yang Ye said, “I didn’t come here with you for a Super Divine Treasure. Yes, I’m someone who only seeks benefits at some times, but it depends on the person. Consider retrieving your main body as my way of repaying you for all the help you’ve given me. As for what you do after you’ve recovered, I won’t force you to stay. I’m not playing tricks or trying to make you feel moved, this is just how I think.”

Yang Ye left the pagoda once he finished speaking.

Sword Scroll remained silent on the Ascension Platform.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye returned to the Ancient Sword Sect. Every Outer Court Disciple had their own abode, and he did too.

An Elite Disciple!

He had to find a way to become an Elite Disciple now, and he had to first become an Inner Court Disciple. He could only take it a step at a time because if he did it too quickly, it would increase his chances of being suspected and getting into trouble!

He was here to steal! No, those fragments belonged to Sword Scroll, so he wasn’t really stealing. He was just returning them to their rightful owner!

An Inner Court Disciple!

Yang Ye left his room and went to Yue Qingwu.

She gazed at him with astonishment, “You want to become an Inner Court Disciple?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Can’t I?”

She glanced at him and replied, “You must pass a test to become one, and only Limitbreaker Realm experts can pass it. But you’re…”

Yang Ye was only at the True Void Realm!

Yang Ye asked, “What’s the test?”

She was about to answer him when laughter suddenly came from the side, “Wow! This young junior brother just became an Outer Court Disciple, yet he wants to become an Inner Court Disciple already. Tsk, tsk. Outstanding!”

Yang Ye and Yue Qingwu looked over, and they saw a man with a sword in his grasp. He was wearing a large and loose robe, and he had a sword chest on his back.

Yang Ye replied with a question, “Can’t I?”

The man was slightly stunned and chuckled, “Of course. But it sounds quite funny to me. Let me tell you a story. There was once an ant who actually wanted to move a tree. Tell me, isn’t that laughable? You…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and then everyone here was stunned.

Yang Ye had suddenly grabbed hold of the man’s throat!

Yang Ye squeezed down slightly and looked the man in the eyes, “Go on! Continue! Laugh for me! Huh? Why aren’t you laughing? Fucking laugh right now!”
