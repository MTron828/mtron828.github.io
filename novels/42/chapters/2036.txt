Chapter 2037 – I’ll Come for His Head Another Day!

Everyone here was stunned when they saw the person in front of Yang Ye.

Even the three demon kings had stopped moving!

A short moment later, an extremely unsightly expression appeared on Xiao Tian’s face.

Because it was the demon king of Spirit Monkey Mountain who was standing before Yang Ye, it was the monkey who was covered in flames!

The monkey!

Yang Ye was astounded because of that.

Yang Ye asked, “Weren’t you repressed by them?”

A wisp of disdain curled up on the corners of his lips, “How can a tiny minor Buddha repress me?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he gazed at Xiao Tian, “As a fellow member of the demon race, I didn’t want to be too ruthless, but you actually dared to try and annihilate my descendants. So, all of you can rest eternally in Thousand Miles Mountain today!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the monkey tapped his right foot down and transformed into a string of flames that shot forward.

Bang!

Xiao Tian was blasted into the mountains, and countless mountains collapsed in his wake.

Meanwhile, the monkey hadn’t stopped at all, and he slammed his golden rod at Xiao Tian.

A scene that astounded everyone here appeared.

Xiao Tian couldn’t even fight back before the monkey, and all he could do was suffer a beating.

He was being completely beaten up!

Explosions resounded incessantly from the mountains. Every single swing of the monkey’s rod would cause a shrill cry to resound between the mountains.

Yang Lianshuang spoke softly while standing by Yang Ye’s side, “He’s so strong!”

Yang Ye chuckled. His strength isn’t ordinary at all!

Meanwhile, Earth Dragon and Grand Roc exchanged glances and intended to leave. However, the monkey suddenly appeared in front of them, and there was a smashed up wolf corpse below his feet!

Obviously, it was Xiao Tian’s corpse!

Earth Dragon and Grand Roc’s expressions grew even gloomier from the sight of this.

The monkey said. “The death of every demon king reduces my demon race’s strength, and I didn’t want to do this. However, all of you willingly acted as servants for the Buddhist Path. Since that’s the case, I have to forget about the demon race. From today onward, anyone who dares to offend my Spirit Monkey Mountain will be killed no matter the cost!”

The monkey vanished on the spot.

Earth Dragon and Grand Roc would naturally not just stand there and wait for death to arrive, and they immediately charged at the monkey.

Yang Ye shook his head. Even Sages would probably be unable to kill the monkey. As for these two demon kings, they were absolutely too weak to offer any sort of resistance. Sure enough, it didn’t even take 10 minutes for the monkey to kill both of them.

The monkey flicked three pure white pearls over to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What are these?”

“Inner cores!” Qiong Qi spoke solemnly, “Those are treasures. If you take a single demon king’s inner core to the Human Dimension, it will sell for an astronomical price. If you consume it yourself, your body will improve by 30-40% at least.”

He gazed at the monkey and continued, “According to the rules of the demon race, killing and taking inner cores is strictly prohibited. Otherwise, the Demon God Hall will…”

The monkey said, “It’s fine. They can come look for me if they can. If they do, I’ll destroy Demon God Hall.”

Qiong Qi shook his head and chuckled because besides this monkey, there was probably no one else in the demon race who dared to say that.

Yang Ye didn’t refuse and took them before he said, “Brother Monkey, since you’re back, I’ll be taking my leave.”

The monkey shook his head, “I’m leaving!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Huh?”

The monkey’s lips curled up slightly and a ferocious smile appeared there, “I’m going to kill all the Buddhas and monks of this world.”

Yang Ye’s face froze. He knew that the monkey planned to fight the Buddhist Path until the end!

Meanwhile, the monkey glanced at the monkeys of Spirit Monkey Mountain, and he said, “Let them go with your friend. I can only rest at ease if they’ve left the Demon Dimension.”

He gazed at Yang Lianshuang and flicked a white jade bottle to her, “Those are some spirit pills I grabbed. If you consume them, attaining the Zen Realm probably won’t be a huge problem!”

Yang Lianshuang was overjoyed and hurriedly took it. She smiled, “Thank you for the gift!”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “Brother Monkey, can I have a bottle too? I’m only in the Hear Dao Realm!”

The monkey shook his head, “I’ve used all of them. That bottle is all the pills I’ve gotten bored of!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened. This monkey…

The monkey patted Yang Ye on the shoulder, “Your path is unlike hers, so just let life take its course. Besides that, you kept your promise to help my Spirit Monkey Clan, and I’ll remember that. If I don’t die, I’ll go to the Weapon Path and Dao Path with you, and I’ll help you with the fight between Paths!”

The monkey turned around and walked away once he finished speaking.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly grabbed the monkey’s hand and spoke seriously, “Brother Monkey, forget about the fight between Paths for now. Can you deal with that thing which is following me? She’s been following me for a long time. I don’t even dare to sleep with my eyes closed now!”

The evil treasure!

Yang Ye had naturally not forgotten it, and amongst the people he came into contact with lately, the monkey may have the highest chance to deal with it.

The monkey fell silent when he heard Yang Ye.

Yang Ye asked, “What? You can’t?”

The monkey shook his head slightly, “It’s not ordinary. Strictly speaking, we’re from the same course, so I can’t act against her. Moreover, I can’t destroy her either. Conversely, if I act against her, and she tries to take us down with her, then while I’ll be able to survive it, you may not!”

Yang Ye’s face fell.

Meanwhile, the monkey added, “Kid, how did you offend it? After all, while there are people who can kill her, there probably are none who would be willing to act against her. Because she has the support of an existence that countless experts are unwilling to offend!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “I don’t know how I offended it either. So, Brother Monkey, can you make it acknowledge someone else as its master? She’s seriously way beyond my league, so ask her to look for someone else!”

The monkey glanced at Yang Ye and shook his head.

Yang Ye was speechless.

Meanwhile, the monkey said, “You don’t have to worry too much. You have that thing with you, and it’s one of the few things in this world that can counter her. So, you should be fine in the short term. When the time comes, you can ask your master in the Dao Path for help. Once he’s there, she won’t dare to acknowledge you as her master, no matter what.”

The Dao Path!

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. He’d only ever met his master’s clones, so how would he go looking for his master?

The monkey patted Yang Ye on the shoulder, “Take care!”

After that, he transformed into a ray of golden light that vanished into the sky.

Yang Ye sighed softly. That evil treasure… T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Two hours later, Yang Ye’s group arrived deep in the mountain range.

Qiong Qi said, “Kid, the Human Dimension is just up ahead. My presence will definitely alarm the experts of the human race. So, I can’t send you further!”

Yang Ye cupped his fist to Qiong Qi, “Brother Qiong Qi, thank you!”

“Don’t mention it!” Qiong Qi continued, “Come visit my territory if you have the time!”

Yang Ye replied, “Of course!”

Qiong Qi nodded and vanished into the sky.

Yang Ye turned to look at Yang Lianshuang, and then he waved his right hand. Su Qingshi and the mothers appeared in front of her.

Su Qingshi smiled at Yang Lianshuang, “Long time no see!”

Yang Lianshuang grinned and said, “Thank you for agreeing to help!”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Don’t worry, I’ll take care of their safety.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he gave a bracelet to Su Qingshi, “Keep it!”

The Crimson Ox was within the bracelet, and its strength was definitely comparable to a demon king. It was one of the reasons he was confident in being able to face two demon kings earlier.

Su Qingshi didn’t refuse it and said, “Be careful on your trip to the Weapon Path!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t worry. Even if it's not for myself, I’ll be careful for all of you!”

Su Qingshi hugged Yang Ye lightly. She was still quite worried.

Yang Ye bade farewell to all of them. In the end, he watched as they vanished along with the demon beasts of Spirit Monkey Mountain.

Once all of them left, Yang Ye took a deep breath, shook his head, and smiled.

He was reluctant!

Now, he finally understood why his sword was inferior to the Unfettered One.

The Unfettered One could give up everything, but he was reluctant to give up so many things.

If one could give up everything, one would have no ties, and one’s Sword Dao would be at its purest state. So, it was naturally at its strongest too!

But Yang Ye didn’t just have the sword in his life, he had his loved ones, friends, and brothers. All of them were people he couldn’t give up.

A long time passed before Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, shook his head, and smiled, “If life is lived solely for the sword, wouldn’t it be boring? Without emotion? With emotion? I, Yang Ye, choose to keep my emotions!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

However, he’d only just arrived in the sky when a middle aged man obstructed his path.

The middle aged man sized up Yang Ye and said, “You’re Yang Ye!’

Yang Ye nodded and admitted it.

The middle aged man laughed coldly, “You’re really brave. You actually dared to return to the Human Dimension. Alright, it’s the perfect opportunity to deal with you and see the Sovereign of Man to…”

A sword howl resounded, and the middle aged man’s arm flew up into the air.

An instant later, a ray of light vanished into the sky. At the same time, a voice drifted down from there, “Go tell the Sovereign of Man to clean his neck. I’ll come back another day for his head!”
