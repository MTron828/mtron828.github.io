Chapter 2034 Chapter 2034 – One on One with a Demon King!

Three Sages!

Yang Ye hadn’t expected to see so many Sages at once, and all of them were alive!

The old man in linen robes had stopped.

He glanced at the people here, and then his gaze stopped on the middle aged man, “You’ve broken the rules twice.”

The middle aged man replied indifferently, “I have no intention to destroy this place, but there’s some enmity I have to get even on.”

The old man looked the middle aged man in the eyes, “This is my territory!”

The middle aged man gazed at the old man without showing any weakness, “It’s not easy to attain the Sage Realm. It would be such a pity to die!”

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “You seem very confident in yourself!”

The middle aged man didn’t waste his breath and just flicked a strand of white light into the old man’s forehead. A long time passed before the old man’s figure trembled slightly, and then he looked up at the middle aged man and spoke with astonishment, “You…”

The middle aged man spoke indifferently, “Say it if you want to die!”

The old man didn’t say anything and just left.

Yang Ye and Ji Yue exchanged glances, and they saw shock in each other’s eyes.

What was it that made a Sage leave?

It was naturally impossible for them to find out the answer.

The middle aged man glanced at the white robed old man in the sky, “The Xuanyuan Clan? Hmph! Don’t worry, we’ll meet again soon!”

The middle aged man turned around and left, and the white robed old man didn’t stop him! Because just the white robed old man wasn’t sufficient to stop a Sage from leaving!

The white robed man was silent for a long time, and then his divine sense swept the surroundings. To be more precise, he was searching for the Sage in linen robes. He wanted to ask about the middle aged man’s true identity, but he noticed nothing.

The old man frowned. Meanwhile, a voice resounded in his mind, “I want to live a few more years, so you should leave. I refuse to interfere in the enmity between both of you!”

The white robed old man’s frown deepened.

A long time passed before he waved his right hand, and a figure flew over to him. It was Xuanyuan Yan who’d been blasted away earlier. While Xuanyuan Yan wasn’t dead, his bones had shattered completely!

A wisp of gloominess flashed through the old man’s eyes, and then he vanished on the spot with Xuanyuan Yan.

Meanwhile, Ji Yue suddenly asked, “Who was that?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t know. But Miss Ji Yue, you should be careful from now on. Because I feel that something major is about to happen in the world.”

Ji Yue nodded slightly, “My ancestor said the same.”

Yang Ye smiled and said, “Miss Ji Yue, I must take my leave now. If you need something, feel free to let me know.”

Yang Ye immediately transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

He was extremely swift and took a mere instant to vanish from Ji Yue’s field of vision.

Ji Yue gazed at the masked old man, “Uncle Jiang, are you alright?”

The masked old man shook his head slightly.

Ji Yue spoke softly, “So many Sages showed themselves today. Looks like the world isn’t going to be quite peaceful anymore. I wonder who will rise in these chaotic times, and who will fall.”

The old man didn’t say anything in response.

Ji Yue spoke softly, “Let’s leave!”

The old man nodded, and then he pushed Ji Yue away.

…

Once Yang Ye left the town, the space before him suddenly trembled, and then Yang Ye’s face fell. After that, a ray of light flashed below his feet, and then a ray of light vanished into the sky!

The Demon Dimension!

Yang Ye raised his speed to his limits. He was rushing to Spirit Monkey Mountain.

It was because Black Ape had sent him a voice transmission that something had happened. Or to be more precise, something had happened to the monkey!

At Yang Ye’s full speed, it only took less than half a day for him to get there. As soon as he arrived, Yang Ye’s face fell because countless demon beasts were all around Spirit Monkey Mountain, and they’d completely surrounded the mountain!

Yang Ye flashed over to the mountain.

As soon as he arrived there, Black Ape appeared before him and said, “Something happened to my ancestor!”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “What happened?”

Black Ape replied, “According to the information I received, a Buddhist Progenitor took action, and it may not have been just one. They’ve repressed my ancestor.”

Yang Ye asked, “They didn’t kill him?”

Black Ape shook his head, “They want my ancestor to submit. Or I should say that they want him to become their representative in our world and strive to gain benefits for the Buddhist Path. However, based on my ancestor’s temper, that’s clearly impossible.”

He was repressed!

Yang Ye fell silent. He naturally had a good impression of the monkey. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have called the monkey brother. However, it was obvious that the monkey’s actions had been quite impulsive, even more impulsive than him!

At the very least, he wouldn’t fight to the death, and he would run if he was no match. But the monkey clearly hadn’t fled, and that’s why they were able to subdue him!

Yang Ye asked, “What about those fellows outside?”

Black Ape spoke in a low voice, “It’s the Skywolf Clan. Obviously, they’d received news about what happened. They want Spirit Monkey Mountain to submit to them. Otherwise, we have to leave Spirit Monkey Mountain!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “Leave Spirit Monkey Mountain?”

Black Ape nodded, “Our ancestor chose this place all those years ago, and it has the best spirit veins and natural landscape in the area. There were naturally no demons who dared to covet it while my ancestor was still here, yet now…”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand. Come, let’s go have a look!”

“They’re very strong!” Black Ape continued, “Even though that Demon King isn’t a Sage, he’s a peak Zen Realm expert.”

Yang Ye said, “It’s fine. My reinforcements will be here soon!”

Black Ape was stunned, “You have reinforcements?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course. Who doesn’t have a few friends?”

Yang Ye turned around and walked towards the outside.

At the foot of Spirit Monkey Mountain, a ray of sword energy suddenly descended before the demon beasts.

Aowu!

Furious howls resounded.

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “Tell your demon king to show himself!”

Suddenly, a black wolf leaped up and pounced at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then a ray of light flashed.

Hiss!

That wolf was instantly sliced into two, and blood accompanied by internal organs sprayed all over the ground.

The demon beasts before Yang Ye became furious when they witnessed this. All of them howled in unison and charged at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye took a step back, and then he grabbed his sword with both hands and swung it.

Hiss!

A brilliant ray of light flashed, and then a few dozen demon beasts at the front of the group were sliced into two!

The other demon beasts didn’t dare to charge again once they witnessed this scene. Even though they were extremely fierce, they were clearly afraid. The human before them wasn’t someone they could fight!

Meanwhile, a middle aged man suddenly walked out from behind them.

The middle aged man sized up Yang Ye and said, “You’re Yang Ye!’

Yang Ye frowned, “You recognize me?”

The middle aged man chuckled, “Why wouldn’t I? You’re the number one sword cultivator in the younger generation of our large universe.”

He glanced at Spirit Monkey Mountain and continued, “Yang Ye, you can’t protect Spirit Monkey Mountain. Leave now and I won’t act against you. Because someone else will come for you.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Brother Monkey asked me to take care of Spirit Monkey Mountain before he left. How can I leave now when it’s in trouble?”

The middle aged man said, “Looks like you want to die. That’s fine, I can use you to gain a favor!”

The middle aged man vanished on the spot.

Bang!

An explosion resounded and Yang Ye was blasted over 3km away. His figure only stopped after it slammed against the mountain wall, and Spirit Monkey Mountain shook violently while countless huge rocks rolled down from it.

The middle aged man waved his hand lightly and placed them behind his back. He gazed at Yang Ye and spoke indifferently, “You aren’t really able to take a beating!”

Yang Ye coughed, and blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth! Yang Ye chuckled and gazed at the middle aged man, “As expected of a demon king, you’re extraordinary indeed. Come, try this attack of mine!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye raised his palm, and a sword floated above it. The sword started spinning swiftly, and rays of light seeped out incessantly from it. An instant later, the sword vanished from Yang Ye’s palm.

At the same time, the middle aged man clenched his right fist and slammed it forward.

Bang!

As soon as his fist shot forward, a sword stabbed against it. The powerful force they carried caused the surrounding space to crack open, and the middle aged man was pushed over 300m back.

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared in front of the middle aged man, and he slapped the sword’s hilt.

Bang!

The middle aged man was pushed another 300m back. Right when Yang Ye intended to follow up with another attack, the middle aged man slammed his left palm forward!

Bang!

It was Yang Ye and his sword that flew away this time.

The force behind this slap had blasted Yang Ye against the mountain wall again.

The middle aged man chuckled, “Too young!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he planned to attack again, but his expression suddenly changed, and then he turned around and slammed a punch forward!

Bang!

The middle aged man was instantly blasted over 1km back! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

At the same time, a voice resounded in Yang Ye’s ears, “Long time no see, kid.”
