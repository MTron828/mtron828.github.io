Chapter 2127 – Transformation!

The universe must be destroyed!

Gloominess covered Yang Ye’s face when he heard this.

Meanwhile, Ding Shaoyao said, “Don’t worry, I won’t let it attack Snowy.”

She knew very well how important Snowy was to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye remained silent.

Ding Shaoyao added, “Actually, Snowy isn’t weaker than it!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she continued, “Snowy is formidable because of spirit energy. If she possesses sufficient spirit energy, then she’s almost invincible. However, she’s a little too playful, and that’s why she isn’t that strong right now!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Suddenly, Snowy appeared from within his chest.

There was an ethereal golden pagoda above her head.

Ding Shaoyao glanced at the pagoda and shook her head, “What a lucky little fellow.”

The pagoda was one of the best treasures in the large universe, yet it was willing to protect the little fellow at all times. So, even the Evil Yin Sprite would find it difficult to get close to Snowy now.

Snowy glanced at Ding Shaoyao, gazed at Yang Ye, and then waved her claws. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye asked, “You want to cultivate?”

Snowy nodded.

“Why?” Yang Ye asked, “Didn’t you hate cultivating?”

Snowy suddenly clenched her paws and waved them at Yang Ye.

She wanted revenge!

If it hadn’t been for Tian Xiu and the Primordial Pagoda, she would have been eaten by now, so she couldn’t just forget that.

Yang Ye was about to speak when Ding Shaoyao suddenly said, “She does need to cultivate. Otherwise, it would be a waste of her natural talent. Moreover, you can’t protect her forever, right?”

“I will protect her forever!” Yang Ye said, “However, I’ll let her cultivate too, “Snowy must have some strength to protect herself. Because many will definitely try to get a Sprite Lord like her.”

Snowy nodded, and there was determination on her face.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye gazed at Ding Shaoyao, “That Evil Yin Sprite doesn’t obey you?”

She shook her head slightly, “My god race has merely formed an agreement with it, and we have no right to order it around.”

Yang Ye asked, “Aren’t you afraid that it’ll come back to bite you?”

She smiled, “My god race isn’t weak either, and we have a common enemy right now.”

Yang Ye asked, “That mysterious figure?”

She nodded in response.

Yang Ye asked, “Who was that?”

Ding Shaoyao shook her head slightly, “You’ll find out soon. Right, where’s Elysium? Let me have a look at it!”

Yang Ye glanced at her, and then he withdrew Elysium. Ding Shaoyao took it and spoke softly, “As expected!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What?”

She explained, “Its strength can grow stronger. If you’re able to activate its hidden ability, Bloodlust, in battle, then your strength and its strength will grow stronger and stronger. I’ve taken a look, and I see that you’ve activated it in the past. I presume it was a very difficult battle.”

Yang Ye nodded, “It was.”

It had been his first battle where he killed a Sage. However, he hadn’t thought carefully about it, so he hadn’t noticed this ability within Elysium.

Ding Shaoyao passed Elysium back to Yang Ye, “Your current strength is sufficient to fight a Sage with ease. However, there is a difference in strength among Sages. Besides that, there are many unknown living beings in the world, just like the Evil Yin Sprite. While there are few existences like it, there aren’t none. So, you should be cautious!”

Yang Ye replied, “I understand.”

Many experts died at the hands of their own carelessness.

Ding Shaoyao glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Your body hasn’t arrived at the Sage Realm.” She paused for a moment and continued, “Come with me!”

She turned around and walked off into the distance.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and hurried after her.

Yang Ye followed her up to the surface. She looked up at the sky, and above them was a deep and mysterious view of outer space that was covered in stars.

Ding Shaoyao said, “You’ve come into contact with stellar energy in the past, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I once cultivated in it.”

She said, “Your body is at your current limit, and your foundation isn’t bad at all. However, if you want to take that step, it will take you at least 30 years from now. The difficulty of the process of ascending from a mortal to a Sage is beyond your imagination!”

Yang Ye gazed at her and waited for her to continue.

Ding Shaoyao continued, “Stellar energy is boundless, and its strength is unquestionable. Now, I’ll use my Stellar Convergence Formation to converge stellar energy into your and help you attain the Sage Realm in the body.”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Why?”

She turned around and looked at him.

Yang Ye continued, “Why are you helping me?”

Ding Shaoyao grinned, “When I was reincarnated into the Ding Clan, my physique was extremely weak due to the fact that I suffered extremely serious injuries all those years ago. If it wasn’t for your Primordial Violet Energy, I would have taken dozens more years to recover. Moreover, if you didn’t help me recover in advance and awaken some of my ability, I would have been forced to enter the cycle of reincarnation again when the continent was destroyed.”

Yang Ye remained silent.

Ding Shaoyao walked over to Yang Ye, “Kindness is repaid with kindness, and evil is repaid with evil. These words do make some sense at some times. Of course, I’m not helping you entirely because I want to repay you. Alright, let’s not waste time and get to it. It may be painful when the stellar energy enters your body, so try to endure it!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she formed a strange seal with both hands, and then a crystal blue circle appeared below Yang Ye’s feet.

Ding Shaoyao said, “This is a single Stellar Convergence Formation. It may be difficult for you to get used to the stellar energy entering your body, but you must hold on. If you do, everything will change; but if you fail, you’ll be brought back to square one!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she changed the seal she’d formed.

In an instant, countless rays of starlight lit up deep within outer space, and then they shot down in Yang Ye’s direction. The stellar energy formed a huge beam of stellar energy that shot into Yang Ye’s head.

Boom!

Yang Ye’s eyes opened wide. At this moment, he felt like his body was about to explode. Once the stellar energy entered his body, it started to madly squeeze down upon his body.

It was quite a violet way to improve his physical cultivation!

Ding Shaoyao had chosen such a violet method because a gentle method wasted too much time. But both she and Yang Ye had no time right now. So, she’d chosen such a method. Of course, she believed in Yang Ye and believed he could endure it.

Stellar energy descended endlessly and surged into Yang Ye.

At this moment, Yang Ye’s entire body was covered in stellar energy, and he couldn’t even be seen from the outside. Moreover, the formation below him stopped the stellar energy from escaping, so they had no choice but to surge into Yang Ye’s body. Once the stellar energy entered his body, they started to madly stimulate his body. It was like tempering steel. They were tempering him over and over again.

When steel was tempered, it was fun to hammer the steel, but the steel itself suffered.

At the moment the stellar energy entered him, Yang Ye almost shouted out for Ding Shaoyao to stop. It was a truly horrible experience. At that instant, he felt like he was about to explode into a pile of much, but it didn’t take long for him to grit his teeth and force himself to endure it.

Give up?

If he gave up this opportunity, he didn’t know when he would be able to attain the Sage Realm in the body. If he didn’t possess sufficient strength in this chaotic world, his life would be more chaotic than the life of a dog. Moreover, he didn’t want to be so powerless like he had been in the past. For example, he felt extremely powerless when the Evil Yin Sprite charged at Snowy, and that was the same powerlessness he felt when he watched his mother die!

Grow stronger!

For the sake of his mother and younger sister, his goal had been to grow stronger. To achieve that goal, no pain or exhaustion could stop him.

His loved ones were the only motivation for him to continue living all those years ago!

It was the same for any responsible man. They would do everything for their loved ones.

As time passed, the pressure Yang Ye endured was growing progressively. Presently, his mind was starting to become blurry. It was because he was on the verge of being unable to maintain his consciousness.

The feeling of having countless rays of stellar energy surge into his body was worse than being burned by the Divine Yin Flame.

Suddenly, Ding Shaoyao’s voice resounded in his mind, “This is your only chance. You’ll have to wait 30 years if you miss this opportunity.”

His only chance!

“AH!” A furious howl suddenly resounded from within the pillar of stellar energy.

It was Yang Ye’s voice, and it was hysterical!

Ding Shaoyao glanced at where he was and continued summoning more stellar energy. Just like that, around six more hours passed.

Crack!

A clear and melodious crack resounded.

Ding Shaoyao looked towards where Yang Ye was, and she noticed that his body had started to crack open.

“C-Continue!” Suddenly, Yang Ye’s voice resounded, but it was extremely weak like he was about to die.

Ding Shaoyao fell silent for a moment, and then she continued summoning more stellar energy.

Just like that, countless rays of stellar energy descended from deep within space.

In the beam of stellar energy, Yang Ye gritted his teeth tightly. At this moment, he seemed like a porcelain bottle that had suffered a heavy blow. While he hadn’t shattered completely, his body was covered in shocking cracks!

Just like that, time trickled by.

Four hours passed.

Boom!

Suddenly, the beam of stellar energy around Yang Ye exploded apart, and Yang Ye exploded along with it.

Yang Ye’s body had exploded apart at this moment!

Ding Shaoyao stopped!
