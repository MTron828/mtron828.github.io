Chapter 2571

At this moment, they were watching the Ancient Sword Sect!

Or to be more precise, they were watching Yang Ye!

Because the strength Yang Ye revealed had been too dazzling!

The Xing Clan’s patriarch, Xing Ren, spoke abruptly, “What do all of you think about him?”

They fell silent.

Xing Ren chuckled, “I have to admit that he’s an extraordinary genius, and while I can’t say none in our younger generation can defeat him, there are absolutely no more than three throughout Eternal Kingdom. Moreover, two of them can’t even be really considered as being part of the younger generation.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “If he’s given a few more years, I think even we won’t be able to fight back against him!”

Meanwhile, the Lu Clan’s patriarch spoke abruptly, “The Ancient Sword Sect’s survival doesn’t make a huge difference, but if he survives, it’ll be quite a huge problem. Moreover, according to the information I obtained, he’s quite close with the desolate race. He’s good friends with their junior patriarch, Huang Ying. The desolate race stretched out a helping hand to him this time, so if we go to war against the desolate race in the future, he will be one of our most dangerous enemies!”

The Leng Clan’s patriarch, Leng Tian, spoke abruptly, “So, all of us are of the same mind?”

They didn’t say anything, and it could be understood as tacit agreement.

Leng Tian smiled, “But I’m sure you’ve all noticed that those two Grade 2 Lord Realm experts of the Soul Sect don’t seem to be capable of killing him. Moreover, now that those demons have joined the fight, the Soul Sect will probably be incapable of crushing the Ancient Sword Sect in a short while. The more we delay, the greater the chances are of something happening!”

Xing Ren replied indifferently, “So? You want us to send more of our forces?”

Leng Tian shook his head, “Why don’t we do it ourselves?”

Ourselves?

All of them frowned.

The reason they hadn’t joined in was naturally because of how embarrassing this whole thing was. After all, the Ancient Sword Sect had been part of the Eternal Kingdom, and it had been on good terms with them!

They couldn’t go that far!

That was why the forces they sent had their faces concealed!

Leng Tian continued, “Allow me to be honest, the Ancient Sword Sect is aware that we’re helping the Soul Sect, so doing this doesn’t make a difference! Thus, why don’t we just attack ourselves and annihilate them? Otherwise, once he is allowed to escape, then he’ll definitely be a huge problem for us in the future!”

Meanwhile, Xing Ren nodded slightly, “There’s no need to keep hiding! Let’s just end it as soon as possible!”

Once he finished speaking, the others nodded, and then numerous powerful auras swept toward the Ancient Sword Sect.

At this moment, countless disciples in the sect looked up into the sky, and they turned pale while the hope in their eyes vanished without a trace.

A short while later, Xing Ren led the other patriarchs and the other two experts over to the sky above the Ancient Sword Sect.

Endless pressure surged down like a waterfall, and it almost suffocated the disciples down on the ground below.

It was overwhelming!

The Ancient Sword Sect wasn’t a god, and it had no chance before the joint forces of these powers. Even if their previous sect master was alive, they still wouldn’t have a chance!

However, their target wasn’t the Ancient Sword Sect, it was Yang Ye!

Because Yang Ye was the greatest threat to them, and the Ancient Sword Sect would die along with Yang Ye!

The patriarchs were all Grade 3 Lord Realm experts, and their auras weren’t any weaker to the Soul Exalt!

Along with their arrival, the two black robed experts from the Soul Sect stopped attacking Yang Ye, but endless souls still remained around Yang Ye. They were truly endless, and they kept appearing incessantly after Yang Ye killed some of them!

Xing Ren glanced at Yang Ye’s figure that was covered in injuries, and besides admiration, there was fear and killing intent in his eyes! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Killing intent!

If Yang Ye couldn’t be of use to them, then Yang Ye should die!

Xing Ren didn’t say anything and just raised his hands slightly. At the same instant, the others attacked.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Numerous terrifying auras instantly enveloped Yang Ye, and the souls around Yang Ye started howling hysterically.

Yang Ye had no chance against them!

Yang Ye grabbed his sword with both hands and stabbed it in space. He was exhausted. He’d been fighting for so long, and he was truly exhausted!

An unending battle!

Endless souls!

Killing just made stronger experts come!

Now, they even stopped attacking one by one, and they had chosen to openly gang up on him.

Yang Ye cracked a smile and looked up at them. At this moment, his vision was slightly blurry.

Sword Scroll stood before the main hall while countless corpses filled her field of vision. These corpses belonged to the Ancient Sword Sect and other powers. Of course, most of them were from the Ancient Sword Sect!

Fight!

No sword cultivator in the sect fled, and none tried to avoid battle!

Sword Scroll grinned, but it was quite a pale smile. She looked in Yang Ye’s direction, and her smile gradually grew as she gazed at his pale and exhausted face.

It was quite miserable!

When Xing Ren and the others were about to attack, Sword Scroll withdrew a black piece of wood, and she muttered softly, “Forgive me. I don’t know which ancestor of the sect you are, but it’s a moment of life and death for the sect now. If you think you can help, then please give us a hand; if you can’t, then continue resting. I won’t disturb you again!”

The wood didn’t react at all!

Sword Scroll closed her eyes slowly. She put it down gently, and then she shot over to Yang Ye’s side.

She gazed at Yang Ye in silence!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly and tightened his grip on Executor. He said, “Disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect! Hear me! This day next year will be the anniversary of our death. Yes, you heard me correctly. We are no match for them, but there are no cowards among us. If I die here today, then remember that all of you will be the next sect master!”

He raised Executor and pointed it at Xing Ren’s group, “We will fight to the death today!”

“Fight to the death!” Countless disciples howled madly.

Meanwhile, Elder Xue and the others gazed at Yang Ye with slightly red eyes, “Fight to the death!”

Xing Ren and the others looked down at Yang Ye from above, and then waves of terrifying energy rained down from the sky. Meanwhile, the souls around Yang Ye charged at him as well.

Five Grade 3 Lord Realm experts and two more experts from the Soul Sect who were comparable to Grade 3 Lord Realm experts! It was a total of 7 Grade 3 Lord Realm experts!

How could he possibly fight them?

Yang Ye was only human! Even if he had a Super Divine Treasure, he seemed so tiny and powerless before so many experts!

Suddenly, the piece of wood before the main hall trembled, and then countless swords throughout the sect started to tremble in unison. Even Executor and the Sword Gourd started to tremble lightly!

In the Primordial Pagoda, Qi Bitian suddenly shot a glance into the air, and she grinned, “I almost didn’t notice.”

As she spoke, she gazed at Lei Lin who was staring at her, and she spoke in a slightly helpless tone, “I can’t help him. If I do, the consequences will be very, very serious.”

She pointed at her forehead, and there was a tiny ‘命’ character there.

Qi Bitian grinned, “See that? Destiny has issued an order and marked me for death. If I help him and Destiny comes, the boom! Everyone will be gone!”

She was marked for death by Destiny!

Lei Lin didn’t understand what that meant at all.

It was terrifying to make Destiny even pay attention to someone, but even making Destiny incapable of killing her was beyond terrifying!

Even Chen Xuanan and the other ancient experts didn’t have the right to make Destiny mark them to be killed. Because they’d been killed!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

The piece of soul wood in the Ancient Sword Sect gradually floated over to the statue before the main hall. It was the statue of the sect’s founder.

A ray of blue light suddenly surged into the status, and just like that, it actually came to life!

The statue opened its eyes slowly, and endless years could be seen within them. A ray of bewilderment did flash through them, but it only lasted an instant.

The statue glanced at the surroundings, and it frowned slightly upon noticing the situation in the sect. A short while later, its gaze descended upon Yang Ye, “You’re the current sect master?”

Yang Ye glanced at the statue and nodded slightly, “I am. May I know your name?”

The statue sized up Yang Ye and shook its head, “Why are you so weak?”

Yang Ye’s face darkened.

Darn you! Whose side are you on?

Meanwhile, the statue gazed at Yang Ye’s stomach, and then its eyes narrowed slightly and were filled with solemness.

Qi Bitian grinned within the pagoda and said, “Keep your mouth shut, otherwise…”

She made a gesture of slitting the throat!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda, the statue took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, and then it glanced at the sword cultivators in the sect. It nodded slightly and said, “You may be weak, but you still have your pride and backbone. Not bad!”

Yang Ye suddenly said, “Are you the Ancient Sword Sect’s founder?”

The founder!

The experts of all the other powers frowned slightly upon hearing this. Which era did the Ancient Sword Sect’s founder even come from?

They couldn’t avoid fearing an ancient existence like that!

The statue glanced at Yang Ye, gazed at the other experts here, and then waved his right hand.

A sword howl resounded, and then a flying sword shot forward!

A moment later, the head of one of the black robed experts from the Soul Sect flew up into the air. At the exact same instant, that expert’s soul was obliterated!

“You’ve broken the rules!” Suddenly, a voice resounded from above the clouds.

A black awl descended slowly!

The Soul Sect’s Master!
