Chapter 2557

A long time passed before Yang Ye regained consciousness!

He looked up, and the young girl was still kicking her ball.

He noticed that she was always kicking it. Since the beginning, and even until now.

She was constantly kicking it as if she was very bored!

She suddenly asked, “You’re awake?”

Yang Ye nodded, “W-What was that?”

She replied indifferently, “Four Dimensional Space!”

Four Dimensional Space!

Yang Ye was stunned and asked, “It really exists?”

She nodded.

Yang Ye said, “If there is Four Dimensional Space, is there Five Dimensional Space? Six Dimensional Space? Or Seven Dimensional Space?”

She glanced at him, “Four Dimensional Space is the highest known level of space in the universe. As for whether there’s Five Dimensional Space, I don’t know. Right, that old man with the bamboo chest may know the answer. If even he doesn’t know, then I’m afraid only that existence in Four Dimensional Space is aware.”

The old man with the bamboo chest!

Yang Ye asked, “Um, do you know anything about him?”

She shook her head, “All I do know is that he has existed since a very, very long time ago. He existed even before I did. Right, he may have even existed before Erya did.”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Meanwhile, she suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, “He seems to think highly of you. Of course, according to my knowledge, he has helped many people, and you are just one of them.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

The old man with the bamboo chest!

Four Dimensional Space!

Erya, and this Abyss Lord… All of this had surpassed the scope of his knowledge.

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. Since the beginning, he’d noticed that as he grew stronger, he would feel even smaller. Was the boundless universe really without an end? Was it really that endless?

Yang Ye didn’t linger on this question. These were things that made no difference even if he learned about them now!

Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground and started recuperating. An hour later, he’d recovered and activated the Sword Domain!

He was sensing the changes in it!

Yang Ye had his eyes closed as he carefully sensed everything around him, but he didn’t notice anything different.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and then two swords shot forward.

Hiss! Hiss!

They shot through the Sword Domain…

Yang Ye suddenly grinned!

Strength and speed!

He’d noticed that their strength and speed were much greater than before. Besides that, he sensed that his Sword Domain seemed to feel solid! Simply speaking, its defense had grown stronger!

Now, even grade 2 Lord Realm experts were absolutely incapable of destroying it. Not to mention grade 2 Lord Realm experts, even grade 3 Lord Realm experts would find his Sword Domain difficult to destroy!

It represented that if he encountered that expert from the Soul Sect again, he didn’t have to worry about having his Sword Domain blasted apart!

It was an indirect increase in his strength!

Meanwhile, she suddenly asked, “Do you want to improve your body?”

Improve the body!

Yang Ye was delighted and quickly replied, “Of course!”

His body was at the Four World Realm right now, and he would be at the Five World Realm if it improved further. Once that happened, his cultivation could rise to the Five World Realm as well. At that time, he would be just a step away from the Lord Realm! Besides that, the gap between him and Lord Realm experts would shrink tremendously!

However, it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to think of something, and he hurriedly asked, “Um… Improving my body wouldn’t be by suffering a beating, right? I-I have to say that my body has been beaten up too much, so I’m afraid it won’t be effective. Thus, it’s best to improve it with some natural treasures instead.”

She gazed at him and remained silent.

Yang Ye was slightly anxious, “I-I’m not lying!”

She said, “Your body is weak, very weak!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

She spoke seriously, “Let’s compare it to a sword. If a sword isn’t tempered sufficiently, it won’t be sharp! Your body is a sword that hasn’t been tempered well. Understand?”

Yang Ye gulped and said, “Uh… So, are you trying to say that you can help me with that?”

She nodded, “Yes.”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and hesitated for a moment, “You won’t beat me to death, right?”

That was what he was worried about the most!

Her strength was absolutely terrifying. If she didn’t hold back, then he may really be hammered to death!

She blinked, “How could I bash you to death?”

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief, “That’s good to hear!”

Suddenly, she appeared before him, “Are you ready?”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Will you really not bash me to death?”

She spoke in a very serious manner, “I won’t!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath, “Let’s do this!”

She punched him as soon as he said that.

It struck his stomach, and it seemed like such a light punch…

Bang!

Yang Ye was instantly blasted away, and his body cracked open in midair while blood sprayed from it!

However, his body stopped cracking when it was on the verge of shattering. Obviously, she’d controlled her strength well!

Yang Ye’s figure slammed against the abyss’ wall, causing it to shake violently before he crashed to the ground. His eyes turned white as he fell unconscious!

Blood sprayed from his body that was on the verge of falling to pieces. Now, even a child could shatter his body!

She glanced at Yang Ye and said, “He’s not dead! I didn’t lie to him, right?”

An aged voice resounded from behind her, “You didn’t, it’s just that living is worse than death now!”

Just like that, Yang Ye remained unconscious for an entire day and night.

When Yang Ye regained consciousness, his body had recovered by around 80%. However, the tearing feeling still remained in him. Moreover, it was very intense. At this moment, he would rather remain unconscious!

Meanwhile, the young girl suddenly said, “I used a special form of energy that will remain within you and ceaselessly tear open your cells. Of course, it will only tear them open and won’t destroy them. It will just be a little painful, so you just have to endure it!”

A little painful?

Yang Ye almost leaped up and cursed at her!

That was just a little pain?

It was worse than death!

Yang Ye felt like his body was being slowly sliced open with a blade. No, it was worse than that, it was being stabbed repeatedly with a needle!

Every needle stabbed into the bone!

It was horrifying!

Meanwhile, the young girl suddenly said, “If you can’t endure it, you can just tell me. I won’t force you.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

At this moment, he adjusted his mentality toward all of this. He was asking her for help and not the other way around!

He gritted his teeth and endured it!

One had to endure enough suffering to achieve greatness!

The Ancient Sword Sect was still waiting for his triumphant return!

Just like that, the following days became an unforgettable experience for Yang Ye.

She was truly ruthless toward him!

Every single attack of hers would put his body at the brink of shattering, and once he recovered with the help of his Primordial Violet Energy, she would do it again…

Shatter and repair!

An endless cycle like this!

If it was just his body that was cracking open, he would be able to endure it well. After all, he’d experienced that on countless occasions. The problem was that it didn’t stop there! Every punch of hers carried a form of mysterious energy that attached itself to him. The energy ceaselessly tore open his body, and it wasn’t just his body, it didn’t even spare his bones and meridians!

He was being torn apart over and over again!

As for the effects, he didn’t care about that right now. All he cared about was whether he would survive this!

For the next two weeks, the young girl did two things every day. The first was playing with her ball. She seemed to never get bored of kicking it, or it should be said that she had nothing better to do.

As for the other thing, it was to punch Yang Ye!

There was a time that she seemed to be in a slightly bad mood, and she didn’t control her strength well. That punch almost blasted Yang Ye to death… Fortunately, Yang Ye was tenacious and managed to hold on to his last breath while the Primordial Violet Energy brought him back from death’s door!

The young girl seemed to feel quite embarrassed by it and started holding back a little more.

Just like that, life was worse than death for Yang Ye every single day.

A month later.

Bang!

At the bottom of the abyss, Yang Ye was punched flying by the young girl again, and he flew all the way to the abyss’s walls.

Yang Ye crashed to the ground, but it didn’t take him long to crawl back to his feet.

She glanced at Yang Ye and didn’t attack again.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was stunned once he crawled back on his feet.

I didn’t fall unconscious?

I’m even able to stand on my feet again?

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Um… Senior, did you hold back?”

She replied indifferently, “Your body has advanced.”

Advanced!

Yang Ye was stunned once more!

A short while passed before Yang Ye scanned his body. Sure enough, his body was at the Five World Realm!

I attained the Five World Realm from getting beaten up?

Yang Ye carefully inspected his body once more. This time, he noticed something different. His body was very, very solid. It wasn’t that his body was tense, it was that the internal structure of his body had undergone a qualitative transformation!

It was like how a piece of scrap could become a sword after being repeatedly tempered for thousands of times!

Now, his body was extraordinarily solid.

It could be said that it was so solid and strong that even the Primal True Dragon may not be able to compete with him in this aspect. No, it wasn’t just a possibility, he had surpassed the dragon. However, it should be inferior to Erya a little… or actually, by a lot!

Erya’s body was horrifyingly abnormal!

The young girl suddenly said, “You can leave now!”

Yang Ye was stunned, “Leave?”

She spoke indifferently, “You can take a beating now, so you won’t die that easily. Go on!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

She continued kicking her ball and ignored Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Wanna come with me? You can go have fun outside!”

“Outside?” She stopped and gazed at Yang Ye, “Is it more fun than kicking a ball?”

Yang Ye replied seriously, “It’s much better!”Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m
