Chapter 2257 – Undead Warriors!

There was a huge door of light deep within the endless black holes, and it was almost 3km wide. The door emanated a weak blue glow, and there were 10 mysterious figures in black armor not too far away from the door of light.

They stood in a row with sabers in their grasps, and they seemed just like statues.

There was a middle aged man in front of them.

He was the undying race’s Master Tian!

Besides that, there were almost 20,000 behind them. Around 10,000 of them were youths. While they were young, they emanated pretty strong auras.

They were the members of the undying race!

The entire undying race actually didn’t amount to more than a few tens of thousands.

While there were few of them, they were all elites. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have been able to annihilate the entire large universe with just such few forces.

Hiss!

Suddenly, space shook violently, and then a black shadow tore through space and arrived before them.

It was a middle aged man, Master Gui of the undying race.

The undying race had three wise men, and Master Gui was the third!

Two of them were here now!

Master Tian asked, “How is it?”

Master Gui replied solemnly, “Looks like the people of this large universe are aware of this portal. Countless are rushing here now. Obviously, they want to go through after us. Hmph! They wish! We’ll bury all of them here!”

Master Tian frowned slightly, “Don’t be careless. Our patriarch is maintaining the formation while Lord Xiao Lou and the others are keeping the Void Spirit Maiden busy. So, we can’t let any mishaps occur. We can die, but these people behind us are the future of our race. Nothing can be allowed to happen to them.”

Master Gui hesitated for a moment and said, “Brother, why don’t we annihilate Void Spirit Maiden and Yang Ye before activating this formation? Wouldn’t that be a safer option?”

Master Tian glanced at Master Gui, “What if we can’t annihilate them? What if we fail?”

“Fail?” Master Gui spoke solemnly, “How could we? We…”

Master Tian shook his head slightly and interrupted Master Gui, “All those years ago, we had almost 100,000 people, but now not even half remains. We suffered a terrible loss during that battle, and we can’t allow that to happen again. Nor can we afford that. Besides that, there’s one other reason, and it’s that our patriarch is worried that the Void Spirit Maiden would ignore everything and just kill our people. With her strength, if she disregards everything and focuses on killing our people, then even the Patriarch and the others will probably be unable to stop her!”

Master Gui nodded, “True.”

Master Tian glanced at the group behind them and said, “Patriarch isn’t afraid of Void Spirit Maiden, but he had no choice but to think about our people. So, that’s why we’re sending off our people first.”

Master Gui hesitated for a moment and said, “The initial race’s territory is at the end of the teleportation formation, and they…”

Master Tian shook his head, “I don’t know.”

Master Gui frowned, “Huh?”

Master Tian gazed at the door of light and said, “All those years ago, our undying race knew a little about the initial race’s strength. However, we were busy with another race and couldn’t deal with them. Once we dealt with that race, the initial race had left this large universe, and then we fought the void spirit race and suffered tremendous losses, causing us to go into deep sleep for all these years. Now, the initial race and that universe… are all unknown to us!”

HE shook his head and continued, “But we have no other choice. In order to awaken the experts of our undying race, we extracted the spirit energy of this large universe and used the spirit energy we had. Now, this large universe is on the brink of destruction. So, the other side of this formation isn’t just the only hope for the living beings of this large universe, it’s the same for our undying race too. No matter what’s over there, we must go there!”

It was the only path they could take!

As far as the living beings of this large universe were concerned, the teleportation formation was their only way out, but it was the same for the undying race!

“They’re here!” Suddenly, Master Gui looked toward the side, and countless were rushing over through the endless black holes. It was a dense ocean of people. There was excitement, joy, and terror in their eyes.

It was terror toward death!

There was hope here, but terror too. Because the undying race was here. However, their hope for survival suppressed that fear.

When they saw Master Tian and the others, they stopped on the spot while vigilance filled their eyes. However, even more gazed at the door of light behind Master Tian’s group.

It was their hope! Hope was right before them!

“Charge!” Suddenly, someone shouted, and then a man charged forward.

He was clearly too nervous and excited, so he hadn’t noticed that the formation hadn’t even been activated yet. Besides the man, over 100 more charged behind him. All of them weren’t weak, and the man was even at the Major Zen Realm, so it only took an instant for them to charge over to the door of light.

But something strange occurred.

Their bodies may have charged to the door of light, but their heads had been left 300m behind!

Over 100 heads just dropped nearly, and their eyes were still filled with joy and excitement.

The surroundings fell silent!

It didn’t take long for everyone to look at the 10 mysterious figures in black armor. Every single one of their sabers had blood dripping down slowly from them!

However, no one had seen them attack!

At this moment, everyone had a solemn expression on their face. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Meanwhile, in the shadows.

Elder Yuan had an extremely solemn expression on his face too. Yang Lianshuang and the others were behind him, and their faces were filled with solemn expressions too. While others hadn’t been able to see it clearly, they had.

Those 10 experts had attacked at the moment those people had charged forward.

Fast!

Extremely fast!

Those people hadn’t even realized that they were dead! It was so fast that their minds weren’t able to react to it!

Elder Yuan and the others had expected that the undying race’s experts would be here, but they hadn’t expected them to be this strong! They remained silent for a long time before Elder Yuan gazed at the Demonspawn, “Senior, can you defeat them?”

The Demonspawn shook its head, “If it’s just one, of course. But not ten.”

Elder Yuan’s eyes narrowed slightly, “They’re that strong?”

The Demonspawn glanced at them and nodded slightly, “I wouldn’t last an hour against all ten of them!”

Elder Yuan’s face fell.

The Demonspawn was the strongest amongst them, but even the Demonspawn couldn’t deal with them, so the rest of them were naturally incapable of fighting those ten experts. Moreover, besides those ten experts, there were those two middle aged men, and those middle aged men were definitely stronger!

So, how were they supposed to go over!

Suddenly, the entire expanse of space throughout the endless black holes shook violently!

It wasn’t just the endless black holes, even the space throughout the entire large universe shook violently, and then countless strands of spirit energy suddenly started fading.

The large universe didn’t have much spirit energy to begin with, and now there was none!

The spirit energy had just vanished without making a sound!

The entire large universe was drying up rapidly!

Suddenly, someone shouted from within the crowd, “Look at the portal!”

They looked over. At this moment, it had started to spin, and it started spinning faster and faster before them. A short while later, a boundless expanse of stars and space appeared within it!

Countless people seethed with excitement when they witnessed this!

The teleportation formation had been activated!

“Charge!” Someone howled fiercely, and then many started charging. However, their heads just suddenly flew into the air once they charged forward!

Because quite a few people had charged over, a very bloody scene appeared. A few thousand heads shot up into the air and blood sprayed throughout the area.

However, more and more were still charging over.

But this time, no one was able to get close to the door of light. All of them lost their heads before they could even get close!

At this moment, everyone finally realized what had happened.

It was those ten experts with sabers in their grasps.

They just stood before the door of light, and heads flew up incessantly before them. It was like a bloody rain of dumplings!

Just like that, they had stopped everyone from entering the door of light!

However, their desire to survive made them disregard everything and charge. At this moment, they just wanted to get into the door of light, so many were still charging over.

It was a bloody slaughter!

Meanwhile, Master Tian watched all of this for some time, and then he raised his right hand, “Enter!”

Master Gui walked over to the others from the undying race and said, “Come with me!”

As soon as he gave the order, they started entering the door of light.

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded from afar, and then a young man and a woman arrived here.

It was Yang Ye and An Nanjing!
