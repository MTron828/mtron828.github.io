Chapter 2667 – Merge!

Surrender!

The eyes high above seemed as if it hadn’t heard Yang Ye and just gazed coldly at him.

Meanwhile, the pressure around Yang Ye was growing heavier.

Crack!

Suddenly, the sound of bones breaking came from Yang Ye.

A ferocious smile curled up on his lips.

Bow down?

No, that was something which didn’t exist to him!

The pair of eyes wanted the woman in black’s location, and he naturally couldn’t tell it. Not because he was close to her, but because he had to take her side at a time like this.

Because even if he told the eyes where she was, the eyes would not spare him. Conversely, even if the eyes decided to spare him, the woman in black may not spare him. On the other hand,even if he died right now, the woman in black was very likely to protect the Primordial Pagoda and the others within it.

So, he couldn’t say anything no matter what!

He could only take her side!

Crack!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s figure was flat on the space beneath him.

The bones throughout his body were broken!

But during this time, Yang Ye gritted his teeth and remained completely silent!

However, the pressure was still there, and it was growing stronger!

Sword intent and slaughter intent were useless at this moment.

Both of them were obliterated as soon as they emerged from him. He couldn’t fight back at all before the pair of eyes!

Yang Ye was filled with bitterness.

He’d always felt that he was very strong, but the cruel truth before him was telling him that he wasn’t that strong. There were too, too many existences in this world who were stronger than him.

At this moment, Yang Ye thought of many, many people.

He wasn’t afraid of death, but he didn’t want to die.

A person’s desire to live was limitless!

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded, and a ray of sword intent surged out from Yang Ye. This time, the sword intent wasn’t obliterated by the pressure and shot up into outer space.

It was shooting straight for the eyes!

But just a moment later, it was obliterated!

Yang Ye’s bones were completely broken to the point his body was like mush. But at this moment, his sword intent was extremely sharp and simply capable of piercing the sky!

His sword intent was absolutely formidable!

However, it was so weak in the eyes of those eyes.

Suddenly, a huge pitch black finger appeared above, and it descended from above like a sword.

Its descent was extremely calm, like it didn’t exist in Three Dimensional Space.

At this moment, Yang Ye finally understood.

The existence above wasn’t a being of the Three Dimensional Universe.

It made sense because there were practically no existences in the Three Dimensional Universe that could instill such fear in the woman in black.

Yang Ye laughed bitterly when he sensed the finger descend.

Is this really the end for me?

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly and spoke to the woman in black, “Protect the Primordial Pagoda and everything within it. Otherwise, I’ll come look for you once I’m reincarnated!”

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Erya had a ferocious expression on her face. If the woman in black still refused to unlock the pagoda, then she would truly go all out.

The person she cared about the most in this world was her grandfather, and once her grandfather passed away, she cared about Yang Ye and Snowy the most. They were her closest family!

Snowy had her paws clenched tight too.

The woman in black fell silent for a moment, and then she grabbed the merged sword before her.

Right when she was about to do something, she suddenly looked up.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

The huge finger suddenly stopped, and a bamboo chest had appeared below it!

The bamboo chest had forced it to a stop!

Meanwhile, the eyes in the sky moved to the side.

There was an old man where the eyes’ gaze stopped.

The old man with the bamboo chest!

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and looked up at the eyes, “I’ll play with you!”

He waved his right hand.

Bang!

The bamboo chest shot up into the air and blasted the finger apart, and then the old man vanished into outer space with the bamboo chest.

Meanwhile, the eyes gradually turned ethereal, and the area above returned to normal.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief!

He’d survived!

Meanwhile, Snowy and Erya appeared by his side. Erya’s face was covered in ferocity when she saw the state Yang Ye was in, “Big Brother Yang, I’ll go avenge you!”

Yang Ye hurriedly said, “Stop her!”

Snowy reacted very quickly and hurriedly grabbed Erya’s horn to stop her.

Yang Ye said, “Don’t be rash, Erya.”

Erya clenched her fists while a vicious aura surged incessantly from her.

What a hot headed girl!

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. She had a terrible temper.

A short while later, all three of them returned to the pagoda.

Snowy started to treat Yang Ye.

Erya was still quite angry. The woman in black glanced at Erya, “What’s the point in being angry? You’re still no match for it!”Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Erya gazed at her, “I’m no match for it, but neither are you, right?”

The woman in black laughed coldly, “I may be able to try, but you don’t even have the right to try now.”

Erya clenched her fists, “Are you asking for a beating?”

The woman in black laughed coldly, “I am. Please do it!”

Erya suddenly charged at her.

The woman in black raised her sword and charged at Erya!

It was like the meeting of water and oil!

“Stop!” Yang Ye’s furious shout suddenly resounded.

Erya stopped upon hearing Yang Ye, and the woman in black stopped when she saw Erya stop.

Erya glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Big Brother Yang, let me beat her up. She’s asking for it!”

The woman in black smiled coldly while holding her sword in hand.

Yang Ye sighed inwardly.

Erya, you may not even be a match for her. If you were, I would have definitely allowed you to teach her a nice lesson!

Yang Ye gestured for Erya to come over to him, and she didn’t resist. She walked over obediently to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye grinned, “Let’s not fight each other for now, alright? Our true enemy is out there. So, if you want to fight, you can fight next time, alright?”

Erya felt quite helpless, “Fine. But I really can’t stand the sight of her!”

Yang Ye couldn’t do anything about that. He felt the same too, and he wanted to beat up the woman in black. The problem was that he couldn’t!

He had to stay calm at a time like this!

Recuperate!

Yang Ye continued recuperating while the sparks of war between the woman in black and Erya faded for now. However, both of them couldn’t stand the sight of each other, so it was only a matter of time before they fought again!

Yang Ye couldn’t do anything about that!

All he could do was delay it, and it would be best if he could delay it until Erya was a match for the woman in black… If he were being honest, he wanted Erya to win.

Even though his injuries were severe, he had Primordial Violet Energy, so it wasn’t a huge problem.

Conversely, he’d gained a little.

He’d noticed that his sword intent had undergone some changes after being suppressed by that pressure, but he couldn’t pinpoint the exact changes.

He noticed that after he became a sword cultivator, every change in his mental state would alter his cultivation in the Sword Dao!

As they said, a sword cultivator cultivated the heart!

Around six hours later, Yang Ye was finally almost fully healed.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground while he emanated extremely sharp sword intent. This sword intent was much sharper than before.

Previously, his slaughter intent had been slightly superior to his sword intent. Yet now, his sword intent showed signs of being superior to his slaughter intent.

As a sword cultivator, that was naturally a good thing!

An hour later, Yang Ye stood up and went over to the wooden house with Snowy. Once they entered the house, their gazes immediately fell on the three swords before the woman.

At this moment, they had split into three swords again!

Yang Ye glanced at the sword and asked, “They can merge?”

The woman in black replied coldly, “Why not? Why can’t they merge?”

Yang Ye was quite speechless. What did I do to offend you now? You really have a terrible temper!

Meanwhile, Snowy took the swords and had curiosity all over her face.

The woman in black glanced at Snowy and didn’t stop her. Even the woman in black felt very speechless when facing this little fellow before her. Snow wasn’t the same Sprite Progenitor she knew!

Yang Ye cracked a smile, “Right, you were amazing when you instantly killed Tai Huntian. I was truly stunned by the grace of that attack!”

The woman in black replied indifferently, “It was a very ordinary attack!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Of course, of course. If you were at your peak, killing them would have been like slaughtering chickens, right?”

The woman in black glanced at him, “Stop trying to flatter me! It won’t work!”

Yang Ye hurriedly shook his head and spoke sincerely, “Not, not at all. I’m not trying to flatter you, they are my own sincere feelings. I’m serious!”

The woman’s face remained indifferently. She glanced at the three swords Snowy was holding and said, “These three swords were always one. Because it was too strong and posed a threat to the world’s balance, I split it apart when I split myself apart. So, it’s very normal for it to be able to merge.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Then can I merge them too?”

She glanced at him and said, “I’m afraid you can’t. In this world, only me and the other forms of me are able to merge it.”

Yang Ye was quite disappointed. Meanwhile, she added, “However, if I teach you how, you can do it too.”

Suddenly, Snowy waved her little paw, and then Yang Ye watched with astonishment as the three swords suddenly merged into one!

At this moment, Yang Ye glanced at the woman in black with quite a weird expression on his face.

Meanwhile, the woman in black’s face was absolutely dark.
