Chapter 1181 – This Is It!

In the city.

When the aura of an Emperor appeared in Cloudfall City, countless people looked up into the sky while shock and terror filled their eyes.

Emperors were the strongest force on Dark Hell Continent! They were at the top of the pyramid!

Even if many had watched Yang Ye force an Emperor to flee, they still instinctively felt respect and reverence to Emperors.

As soon as the Emperor’s voice resounded, a middle aged man in a luxurious robe appeared in the sky above Cloudfall City. Right after that, a ray of light flashed before Yang Ye appeared in front of the middle aged man.

Ye Liuyun and the others heaved sighs of relief when they saw Yang Ye.

It could be said that Yang Ye was their pillar of support, even if he was only a Saint!

The middle aged man’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye, and he said, “You’re....”

“Cut the crap. Either you or I will die!” As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, he stomped his right foot down against the space beneath him, and the sky shook. At the same time, his figure transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot, and he was in front of the middle aged man when his figure appeared again. Meanwhile, 2 types of Void Rank intent instantly enveloped the middle aged man, causing the latter to feel slightly suffocated!

The middle aged man’s eyes narrowed slightly. He hadn’t expected Yang Ye to attack immediately, and it had caught him off guard and caused him to lose the initiative in the battle!

However, his reaction wasn’t slow. A black spear appeared in his grasp, and then a speck of cold light flashed. The spear was like a dragon that made the entire sky tremble in its wake!

Clang!

Yang Ye’s sword and the middle aged man’s spear collided. An ear piercing explosion resounded through the sky and shook the hearts of everyone on the ground below.

A moment of silence appeared in the sky, and then Yang Ye and the middle aged man instantly moved 3km back!

The middle aged man had a trace of seriousness in his eyes, and he looked up at Yang Ye, “I underestimated....”

He hadn’t even finished speaking when a sword howl resounded, and then Yang Ye was in front of him. At the same time, the tip of a sword shot towards the center of his forehead. The sword hadn’t even come close when a powerful wave of sword energy and pressure caused the space around him to warp slightly!

A cold glow flashed through the middle aged man when he saw Yang Ye act so overbearingly. He twisted his right hand slightly, and his spear stabbed forward swiftly, causing countless spear images to instantly fill the sky and envelope down towards Yang Ye.

Bang!

The middle aged man moved over 500m back while the spear images vanished. Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s figure appeared before everyone, and there was a bloody mark on his face.

The hearts of the Sword Alliance’s members felt heavy when they witnessed this scene. After all, the consequences they would face if Yang Ye lost was very obvious!

Ye Liuyun clenched her fists. If Yang Ye won this battle, then his name would definitely shock the entire continent. At the same time, the Sword Alliance would be renowned throughout the continent as well. At that time, no one would dare to bully the Sword Alliance. Even those Diamond Rank powers wouldn’t. Why? Because the Sword Alliance had someone who could kill Emperors!

Would anyone dare to underestimate someone who could kill an Emperor?

After all, even Diamond Rank powers wouldn’t have many Emperors! So, unless they were mortal enemies, no one would rashly offend someone who could kill Emperors!

It could be said that the Sword Alliance would rise to prominence if Yang Ye won! At that time, the Sword Alliance which had a spirit vein would definitely attract countless mercenaries and independent cultivators to join it. Moreover, Ye Liuyun could be considered to have finished planning all the follow-up action she would take if Yang Ye won!

But if Yang Ye lost! If Yang Ye lost, then all of them would die!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye stretched out his hand and touched the injury on his face. He knew that he’d underestimated his opponent slightly. The middle aged man was slightly stronger than the previous Emperor from the Dark Sky Sect.

He knew that he had to be serious!

“Your strength isn’t bad. No wonder you dared to kill members of my Doomsday City! Unfortunately, you overestimated your strength and provoked my Doomsday City. Today, I’m going to make a genius like you perish....” The middle aged man was still speaking when a ray of blood red light suddenly surged out from within Yang Ye, and then a ray of blood red sword energy shot at the middle aged man.

The sword energy still hadn’t arrived before him, but just the pungent smell of blood and baleful energy caused the middle aged man’s expression to change drastically! He didn’t dare act carelessly, and he swiftly swung the spear in his grasp!

The spear seemed like it carried the strength to split the sky, and the space throughout the sky instantly started to warp along with the spear!

Clang!

The sword and spear collided, and then the space in the sky shook before both Yang Ye and the middle aged man were blasted back. However, Yang Ye’s figure suddenly shot forward once more and instantly arrived in front of the middle aged man. After that, a wave of blood red light instantly enveloped the middle aged man!

The middle aged man had been infuriated from the battle as well, and a vicious expression flashed through his eyes. His profound energy circulated as he stabbed his spear forward, and then countless rays of light surged out and slammed against Yang Ye’s attack!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Their attacks were still colliding, and they caused numerous ripples to surge out in their wake. It was an extremely shocking sight.

Even though Yang Ye’s physical body at the Divine Shift Realm was powerful, it was only troublesome to an expert at the Emperor Realm. After all, the Divine Shift Realm was only equivalent to an Emperor’s body. So, numerous injuries appeared throughout Yang Ye’s body as he engaged the middle aged man in intense combat. However, the middle aged man wasn’t in a much better state. Countless injuries had appeared on his body while facing Yang Ye’s fearless attacks.

But Yang Ye was still in a disadvantaged position!

After all, Emperors had lived for over 10,000 years, and their mentality and combat instinct were absolutely not things that Yang Ye could compare to. If he hadn’t relied on his body at the Divine Shift Realm, he probably would have fallen by now. Because he had formidable physical defenses, Yang Ye didn’t have to defend himself at all. So, his method of fighting was very simply. If his enemy stabbed him, then he wouldn’t defend himself and stab his enemy as well!

He was exchanging injury for injury!

He was putting his life on the line!

It was exactly such a method of fighting that made the middle aged man feel so aggrieved in battle. Because he had to worry about a lot of things. For example, Yang Ye would stab his chest when he stabbed Yang Ye’s chest. He naturally wouldn’t dare to do that because Yang Ye’s physical defenses far surpassed his own. Moreover, Yang Ye’s sword was extremely sharp, and it was entirely capable of piercing through his profound energy barrier and defenses!

On the other hand, even though his spear could break through Yang Ye’s defenses as well, but....

In the end, he didn’t want to exchange his life for Yang Ye’s life. After all, he was an Emperor, and Yang Ye was just a Saint!

Exchanging the life of an Emperor for a Saint? He was no fool!

However, Yang Ye grew more and more insane as the battle continued, and he got more and more immersed in it as well. Besides that, every single attack from Yang Ye was one that displayed Yang Ye’s readiness to take the middle aged man down with him! This caused the middle aged man to grow even more aggrieved and irritated!

Because the middle aged man was worried about so much, Yang Ye actually gradually gained the upper hand. It didn’t take long for it to transform into a situation where Yang Ye started to suppress the middle aged man!

The others in the city immediately heaved sighs of relief when they witnessed this scene. At the same time, they felt even more reverence towards Yang Ye. No, it should be called veneration!

After all, he was suppressing an Emperor in battle while at the Saint Realm!

Moreover, he was their leader!

If they had a strong leader, then they could naturally live with their heads held a little higher! Just like how the members of those Diamond Rank powers acted when facing independent cultivators and mercenaries like them. They always had a sense of superiority. Why? Because their backing was formidable!

Besides one’s own strength, one’s backing was very important!

Bang!

Meanwhile, a loud explosion resounded in the sky, and then the sky shook violently before Yang Ye and the middle aged man split apart.

At that moment, the middle aged man’s entire body was covered in around 100 gashes. As for Yang Ye, he wasn’t in a much better state. His entire body was practically covered in injuries, but they were just trivial to him. Most importantly, he had Primordial Violet Energy to repair his body, so even some slightly severe injuries would be repaired really quickly.

That was his advantage!

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye with a gloomy expression on his face, and there was a wisp of ferocity in his eyes, “Good! Very good! I....”

The middle aged man intended to say something, but Yang Ye’s figure had transformed into a ray of blood red light that vanished on the spot and shot towards them.

In Yang Ye’s opinion, he was utterly disinterested in wasting his breath on the middle aged man. Since the middle aged man wanted to kill him, then they were naturally mortal enemies. Since they were mortal enemies, it meant that one of them had to die. So, did speaking make a difference in such a situation?

Yang Ye had always looked down upon people who kept wasting their breath in a life and death battle!

Since they were enemies, then fight!

A swing of the sword was much better than a bunch of nonsense!

A wisp of ridicule arose on the corners of the middle aged man’s mouth when he saw Yang Ye attack. Yang Ye arrived in front of him while Yang Ye’s sword stabbed at his chest. However, the middle aged man hadn’t dodged as he had before this, and he just stabbed his spear forward. Even space was pierced open in its wake!

He was going to take Yang Ye down with him!

At this moment, Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly. But he didn’t dodge because it was too late to dodge at a time like this. He suddenly exerted force, and the blood red sword stabbed against the middle aged man’s chest. However, a blue shield appeared before his chest and stopped Yang Ye’s sword.

“As an Emperor, how can I not have even one defensive treasure? Did you really think I was afraid of your fearless method of fighting? You’re too young!” As soon as he finished speaking, the middle aged man’s spear stabbed against Yang Ye’s chest. As expected, it pierced through Yang Ye’s chest, and a strand of blood sprayed out from Yang Ye’s back! Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The countless cultivators in the city instantly turned pale when they witnessed this scene, and they were frightened out of their wits!

However, Yang Ye suddenly pressed forward at this moment, causing the spear to continue through his body. Once he arrived in front of the middle aged man, he grabbed the middle aged man’s shoulder with his left hand, and then a ferocious smile curled up on the corners of his mouth, “Let me show you what risking your life is like! This is it!”

Crack!

Yang Ye instantly pulled off the middle aged man’s arm.
