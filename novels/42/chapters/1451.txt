Chapter 1452 – I Understand, I Really Do!

Yang Ye naturally wouldn’t be so foolish as to just walk in.

Going in represented that he would be in a defensive position. Because he didn’t know what was inside there.

Thus, the best method was to make the thing in there come out here, and then fight it out in the open here. So, if they were no match for it, they could still flee. But if they fought it inside the cave, then they may not even have the chance to flee once they lost in battle.

Yang Ye’s sword energy tore through the air and entered the cave. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Hiss!

It shot into the cave, but... nothing happened at all!

Once it entered the cave, it didn’t make another sound!

The faces of Yang Ye and the others grew even more solemn at the sight of this.

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment, and then he took a step forward. A moment later, the slaughter intent and sword intent within him surged into his ancient sheath. After that, he drew his sword and swung it at the cave.

Om!

A sword howl resounded, and then a beam of snow white sword energy flashed through the air and slammed against the cave.

Bang!

The cave was slashed into two. However, the sword energy didn’t just vanish, and it shot rapidly towards the depths of the cave.

In the beginning, the sword energy sliced through everything in its path, but it didn’t take long for it to suddenly vanish.

Something was off!

Yang Ye brows were knit tightly together. Is it so strong that it can even obliterate my sword energy without making a single sound? That’s probably not the case. If it really was that strong, then it would have shown itself by now. But it hasn’t. Obviously, it either can’t come out here for some reason, or it’s afraid of the forces I have and is waiting for us to head in there.

As for why his sword energy had vanished without making a sound, he was really curious about that!

Yang Ye glanced at the demon wolves and Eaglet, “How about one of you head in and have a look?”

The demon wolves immediately turned to look at Eaglet.

Eaglet was at a loss for words.

Yang Ye smiled when he saw the unsightly expression on Eaglet’s face, “I was joking.”

He would naturally not force Eaglet to head in there. The dangers in there were unknown, so he would clearly be forcing Eaglet into a trap if he made it head in there. That would definitely make resentment arise within Eaglet’s heart. Moreover, the demon wolves would definitely be unhappy if he used Eaglet like that.

Besides that, he wasn’t that kind of person. Since Eaglet had agreed to follow him, then he would naturally not do something like that to Eaglet.

Eaglet’s face eased up slightly when it heard Yang Ye. However, Yang Ye added, “We’ll head in together!”

This time, it wasn’t just Eaglet who had quite an unsightly expression on its face, both the demon wolves had unsightly expressions on their faces as well.

Obviously, they were extremely afraid of the cave.

Yang Ye smiled, “If you’re afraid, then hide inside.”

The demon wolves exchanged glances, and then they went over to Yang Ye’s side. They were no fools. Head into the Primordial Pagoda? And then let Yang Ye take the risk on his own? After all, they had to stay by Yang Ye’s side if they wanted to live comfortably. Eaglet was slightly tempted when it heard Yang Ye, but as soon as it saw the demon wolves stand by Yang Ye’s side, it hurriedly went over to Yang Ye’s side to display that it was willing to head in with Yang Ye as well.

It was no fool!

Yang Ye rubbed the demon wolves’ heads and smiled, “Alright. Let’s head in there and see what sort of existence is in there!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye sat on Big Blackie and said, “Let’s go!”

Big Blackie immediately started walking towards the cave, and both Little Blackie and Eaglet quickly followed after them.

Was Yang Ye acting rashly?

Actually, he wasn’t. He knew that there was definitely danger within the cave. However, so what if there was? Did he have a choice?

He did.

He had two choices. The first was to turn around and head back, and the second was to continue forward. What did heading back represent? He was very well aware that it represented that he might have to wait for death to arrive. So, he had no choice but to march forward.

If he gave it a shot, then there might be a chance in the situation!

As soon as they entered the cave, a gust of cold wind assaulted them. Yang Ye couldn’t help but frown because the cold wind had actually passed through the barrier that he’d created with his sword intent.

The wind wasn’t ordinary!

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and sized up the surroundings. Only now did he realize that there was actually no miasma in the cave. He turned to look at the entrance of the cave. Sure enough, the miasma was blocked out by the cold wind.

Yang Ye turned his gaze back towards his surroundings. He noticed that the cave was much wider than he’d expected. He couldn’t see the roof of the cave, nor could he see the walls of the cave on either side. As for the area ahead, he couldn’t see the end of it as well.

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment before he patted Big Blackie’s back. Big Blackie understood his intentions and continued forward.

Regardless of whether it was Yang Ye or the others, they maintained high levels of vigilance.

Time trickled by. Yang Ye and the others had been traveling forward for almost an hour, yet they still hadn’t reached the end. At this moment, Yang Ye understood why he’d heard no further noise from his sword energy. It was because the cave went in too deep, and his sword energy had advanced without encountering any obstructing. So, it had probably shot off somewhere ahead.

Of course, he didn’t exclude the possibility that someone or some beast had destroyed it.

In short, he still had to be careful.

As they went deeper and deeper, it grew darker and darker. Fortunately, all of them weren’t affected by darkness, and they could still see everything clearly.

Suddenly, all three of them stopped simultaneously.

Hiss!

A sound that seemed like the hissing of a snake resounded.

Big Blackie and Little Blackie’s fur stood on end when they heard it, and a thick layer of scales immediately appeared on Eaglet’s body.

Yang Ye grabbed the hilt of his sword with his right hand, and his profound energy started surging.

However, nothing happened after some time passed.

Yang Ye said, “Continue forward.”

Big Blackie hesitated for a moment and continued forward.

However, the entire ground suddenly started trembling violently, and then a terrifying aura surged out like a torrent from deep within the cave.

A cold glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, and then he leaped off Big Blackie’s back. After that, his sword intent and slaughter intent surged out madly. Meanwhile, Big Blackie, Little Blackie, and Eaglet didn’t stand by idly, and they hurriedly released their own auras.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye’s sword intent and slaughter intent to converge together with their auras, and then it surged into the depths of the cave.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded from afar, but Yang Ye and the others’ expressions changed.

Because their joint forces had actually been dispersed!

The imposing aura continued sweeping over from deep within the cave. Even though it still hadn’t arrived before them, the formidable aura made all of them move backwards repeatedly!

What sort of monster is that?

Yang Ye had an extremely solemn expression on his face. He didn’t have the time to think about anything else, and he just took a step forward, drew his sword, and swung it. A ray of sword energy shot forward.

Because the imposing aura had been struck by the joint forces of Yang Ye and the others, it was much weaker than before. So, his sword energy was able to destroy it with ease.

However, the ground suddenly started to quake, and then Yang Ye felt like something was approaching swiftly!

Yang Ye grabbed the hilt of his sword with his right hand and stared fixedly into the distance.

Meanwhile, Big Blackie, Little Blackie, and Eaglet were doing the same. They were already accumulating strength and were ready to attack at any moment.

It was growing closer and closer.

It didn’t take long for a head to appear within their fields of vision.

What sort of head?

The head of a snake!

A huge head of s snake!

How huge was it? Just a single eye on it was larger than Yang Ye’s entire body.

Regardless of whether it was Yang Ye, the demon wolves, or Eaglet, all of them seemed extremely tiny before the snake head.

“Attack!” As soon as Yang Ye gave the order, he transformed into a ray of light that shot towards the snake head. The others didn’t hesitate as well, and they immediately leaped forward and slammed their bodies against it.

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was the first to be blasted away. After that, the demon wolves and Eaglet were blasted back as well. Even though they hadn’t suffered any injuries, they’d lost in this collision.

Suddenly, the snake opened its mouth, and then sucked.

A wave of powerful suction surged out from its mouth, and it caught Yang Ye and the others off guard, causing them to be almost sucked into the snake’s mouth!

Fortunately, after Yang Ye released his dual intents and the others released their imposing auras, they were able to ward off the suction force.

Meanwhile, something seemed to be rushing over from behind the snake head.

It didn’t take long for a huge snake tail to emerge.

The tail was extremely huge, and I was bound by numerous pitch black chains. It wasn’t just the tail, there were similar chains around the base of the head as well. Those chains were bound tightly around the huge snake’s tail.

Of course, Yang Ye didn’t have the mood to think about all of that.

“Retreat!” Yang Ye didn’t hesitate at all to immediately leap back onto Big Blackie’s back, and then the latter immediately turned around and left.

Regardless of what python it was, the strongest part of them wasn’t the head but the tail. The reason the python had only used its tail now wasn’t because it was going easy on Yang Ye and the others, it was because the python was too huge. Because it was so huge, it took a very long time for its tail to circle back.

In short, Yang Ye knew that the forces he had on his side wouldn’t be able to defeat that huge fellow. Because regardless of whether it was his sword or the others’ claws, they weren’t able to pierce the python’s defenses during the precious battle. Actually, even if they could pierce through its defenses, it wouldn’t have much of an effect. Because the python’s size was beyond their imagination!

Fortunately, it wasn’t very fast. So, Yang Ye and the others were able to escape the cave. However, right when they were prepared to continue running, they noticed that the python actually didn’t leave the cave.

Yang Ye turned around and looked, and he just happened to meet the eyes of the python. Its eyes were filled with viciousness and ferocity.

It can’t leave the cave? Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly recalled the chains that bound the python.

That fellow is imprisoned in there?

Yang Ye felt that his guess was probably close to the truth. The python was definitely trapped in there. Otherwise, it would have definitely left the cave.

Who imprisoned it in there?

Yang Ye didn’t think about it. His mind was filled with what to do next.

He had to go past this mountain.

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then he placed his right palm against his chest, “Brother Qiong Qi, I think that it’s time for you to join the fight.”

Besides Qiong Qi, he really had no other way. Of course, he had the Stellar Sword Diagram. He was very confident that if he utilized it, then not to mention the huge python, even Monkey Mountain would be destroyed. However, he couldn’t afford to use it!

He didn’t have more lifespan to exhaust!

So, he had to rely on Qiong Qi!

However, Qiong Qi didn’t respond to him.

“Sigh!” Yang Ye suddenly sighed softly, “I’ve always felt that Brother Qiong Qi is the most formidable existence amongst the ferocious beasts, but.... Sigh. Actually, it does make sense. That python is so formidable. So, I can understand why you’re afraid of it, I really do....”
