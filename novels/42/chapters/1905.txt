Chapter 1906 – A Sage!

30%!

Nansi Yin naturally didn’t believe Yang Ye’s nonsense, but she was still shocked.

Yang Ye had killed a 2nd stage Enlightened Realm expert while at the 6th stage of the True Realm!

Of course, while he’d succeeded at killing the old man, the enmity between him and the Shaman Hunter Clan had become serious. Yang Ye didn’t really understand the implications of it, but she knew the Shaman Hunter Clan’s strength very well.

Yang Ye gazed at the young. Suddenly, a huge bird appeared behind her, and it stared at Yang Ye while prepared to attack at any moment.

She stared at Yang Ye and asked, “Who are you?!”

Yang Ye didn’t answer her. He just turned around and walked towards Broken Cliff Mountain.

Nansi Yin glanced at the young woman, “Hey, just stop using your Shaman Hunter Clan to scare him. Because he isn’t afraid at all.”

She quickly followed Yang Ye once she finished speaking.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The young woman gazed at the old man’s corpse in silence.

Provocation!

Yang Ye’s actions were clearly the greatest form of provocation against the Shaman Hunter Clan!

A short while later, she took the old man’s corpse and vanished on the spot with the bird.

…

Nansi Yin asked, “Why didn’t you kill her too?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I can’t outrun that bird!”

Nansi Yin was stunned speechless.

Yang Ye wasn’t lying. That bird was too swift. If it chose to flee, then he wouldn’t be able to catch up at all, unless he was willing to spend many days chasing after it. But he clearly didn’t have the time for that right now.

It didn’t take long for them to arrive at the mountainside.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Be careful. Broken Cliff Mountain is guarded by experts from the shaman race.”

Yang Ye asked, “Is the Shaman Dimension huge?”

Hou Qing replied, “Very. It’s much larger than the Human Dimension!”

Yang Ye asked, “Then why does the shaman race attack the human race?”

Hou Qing replied, “Kid, you’ve misunderstood something. At most times, it isn’t the shaman race that’s attacking the human race; it’s the human race that’s attacking the shaman race!”

Yang Ye was bewildered, “What do you mean?”

Hou Qing explained, “The shaman race, human race, or even the demon race have wild ambitions. The shaman race wants to rule over even larger territories and obtain more resources. So, it attacks the human race. But the human race does the same too. There is no right or wrong, and there’s only strong and weak. If the shaman race is weak, the human army would have gone past Broken Cliff Mountain!”

Yang Ye shook his head. Needless to say, what Hou Qing said really made sense. The weaker race of beings in the world would be bullied or even annihilated. So, there was no right or wrong between the human race and shaman race.

Just as Hou Qing had said, there was no right and wrong, there was only strong and weak.

A short while later, they arrived at the peak of Broken Cliff Mountain. Standing there was like standing at the top of the clouds, and they could see endless mountains from here. However, Yang Ye faintly saw a city from here.

“Besides the Shaman Progenitor, the shaman race has another 12 Shaman Kings!” Meanwhile, Hou Qing’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “You have to look for one of the 12 Shaman Kings, the Yin Hou. I’m quite good friends with her, so she’ll help you get to the Sky Dimension.

The 12 Shaman Kings!

Yang Ye nodded slightly and asked, “Where is she?”

Hou Qing replied, “Yin Gorge. Right, I should remind you that you have the aura of the human race, and there’s this human girl by your side. Even though there are humans who come to the Shaman Dimension and live amongst the shaman race, they conceal themselves very well. If you’re exposed, you’ll be in big trouble!”

Yang Ye nodded and restrained his thoughts. He gazed at Nansi Yin, “I’ll ask you one last time. Are you really coming with me?”

She replied, “We’re already here. Am I supposed to go back now?”

Yang Ye said, “Alright, then let’s go!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot.

She quickly followed after him.

After he arrived within the Shaman Dimension, Yang Ye didn’t fly on his sword because he would be painting a huge target on his back. It was like telling the shaman race that a human sword cultivator was here. But even if he couldn’t fly on his sword, he was still extremely fast while relying on his physical strength.

Around two hours later, they saw an ancient city ahead of them, and it was a city made of huge rocks.

It was quite small when compared to Northern Sky City, and it wasn’t as exquisite either. It seemed a little messy.

They were lagging behind when it came to progress!

The shaman race was lagging behind the human race when it came to progress, but they were comparable to humans in other aspects.

Yang Ye looked up, and he saw two words atop the city gate — Boulder City!

Yang Ye and Nansi Yin exchanged glances, and then they entered the city. Once they did, they were quite surprised because they saw many people in the city. They were from the shaman race, but they didn’t look any different from them.

It was a difference of beliefs!

At this moment, Yang Ye recalled what Hou Qing had told him in the past. The human race and shaman race actually had the same origins, but they held different beliefs and cultivated in a different way, so they’d split apart in the end and become enemies!

Suddenly, Yang Ye stopped, and then he pulled Nansi Yin to a corner.

She was puzzled, “What is it?”

Yang Ye looked towards the city gates. Five people were walking in from there, and they just happened to recognize the leader of the group. It was Bei Cangyue.

Besides that, Yang Ye recognized one of the men by Bei Cangyue’s side. It was that man on the Dragon Chariot he’d met outside Northern Sky City.

Meanwhile, Nansi Yin suddenly asked, “What are they doing here too?”

Yang Ye shook his head. He was about to withdraw his gaze when Bei Cangyue suddenly looked in their direction.

Bei Cangyue was slightly stunned when she saw that it was Yang Ye, and there was a trace of surprise in her eyes.

Yang Ye glanced at her and left with Nansi Yin.

Meanwhile, a man by Bei Cangyue’s side said, “It’s him!”

Bei Cangyue gazed at the man, “Brother Liancheng, you know him?”

Gu Liancheng shook his head, “Not really. I had a little disagreement with him outside the city, but it has been resolved.”

Bei Cangyue grinned, and then she looked towards where Yang Ye had vanished and spoke softly, “He’s actually alive! Interesting indeed!”

Meanwhile, Gu Liancheng suddenly said, “Young Miss Cangyue, let’s go!”

Bei Cangyue restrained her thoughts, nodded, and vanished with the others.

Yang Ye had no intention of staying in the city, and he intended to leave. However, Nansi Yin suddenly stopped.

Yang Ye gazed at Nansi Yin, and the latter closed her eyes. Some time passed before she opened her eyes and gazed at Yang Ye, “I know why Bei Cangyue’s group is here.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Nansi Yin spoke solemnly, “I received news that a Sage Ruins has been found in the Shaman Dimension!”

“A Sage Ruins?” Yang Ye frowned, “What’s that?”

She replied, “A Sage Ruins is a place where an extraordinarily powerful expert perished or lived out the ends of his or her lifespan.” She paused for a moment and continued, “My clan asked me to try my luck there!”

Yang Ye nodded and smiled, “Go on. I have other things to do, so I’ll be leaving.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around and intended to leave. However, Nansi Yin suddenly obstructed his path, “Do you know what a Sage Ruins represents?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

She took a deep breath and explained, “The discovery of a Sage Ruins represents that a Sage has something to be passed down. Because experts at their level usually don’t die. Once they do die, they definitely leave their inheritance behind so that their accomplishments don’t end with them. Simply speaking, they leave behind their karma. As for the reason, it may be for new life or something else. In any case, it’s a huge fortune, an absolute fortune!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m not interested!”

As he spoke, he intended to leave, but Hou Qing’s voice suddenly resounded, “If it really is a Sage Ruins, then you should have a look!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Hou Qing replied, “Do you know what kind of experts Sages are?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Hou Qing replied, “They’re experts like your master and the Shaman Progenitor. Even if they’re slightly weaker, since they can be called Sages, they are absolutely not much weaker. Right, know the Sovereign of Man? He once obtained the inheritance of a Sage, and it’s also why he possesses his current accomplishments. Right, supposedly even his sword came from a Sage Ruins.”

Yang Ye fell silent. Now, he was only thinking about how to get to the Sky Dimension as soon as possible.

Hou Qing seemed to know what Yang Ye was thinking and said, “Kid, you’re in no rush to get to the Sky Dimension. Because those two little girls are definitely safe there. You should be worried about what you would do if the Sovereign of Sky wants to kill you because he can’t stand the sight of you!”

The Sovereign of Sky!

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “My luck isn’t that bad, right?”

“Maybe!” Hou Qing continued, “You haven’t just cultivated the techniques of the shaman race, you’ve cultivated a devil technique. Most importantly, you’ve comprehended slaughter intent, and there are many types of karma coiled around you. The Sovereign of Sky will definitely not allow his daughter to have anything to do with you. People like them sometimes only require a small reason to kill someone, and they may not even need a reason!”

He paused for a moment and continued, “So, I suggest that you go. Perhaps you’ll get that Sage’s inheritance or something else. At that time, your strength will definitely rise quite a bit.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Then I’ll go!”

Yang Ye opened his eyes and said, “Come, let’s go to that Sage Ruins!”

Nansi Yin’s voice carried a trace of pleasant surprise, “You’re coming with me?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Let’s go try our luck!”

Nansi Yin smiled. She was about to speak when she suddenly frowned slightly. A short while passed before she gazed at Yang Ye, “My clan wants me to stay away from you!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Nansi Yin spoke softly, “The Shaman Hunter Clan has issued a Blood Warrant. Er, to be honest, I’m not joking when I say that if you don’t have extremely extraordinary backing, then you’re really finished!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “My backing is extremely formidable!”

Nansi Yin’s eyes lit up, and they were filled with curiosity, “What is it?”

Yang Ye walked closer to her and spoke softly, “An old man wearing a Daoist’s robes. I’m serious, if he shows himself, then the Shaman Hunter Clan would take just an instant to annihilate!”

Nansi Yin asked, “Where is he?”

Yang Ye blinked and replied, “That’s what I want to know too!”
