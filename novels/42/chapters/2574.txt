Chapter 2575

Once he left the sect, Yang Ye asked, “Where is the Eternal Kingdom’s Origin?”

He received no answer.

Yang Ye was stunned and returned within the Primordial Pagoda, and he went over to Qi Bitian.

She gazed at him in silence.

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “Don’t tell me you don’t know!”

Qi Bitian hurriedly replied, “Of course I do!”

Yang Ye asked, “Where is it?”

She blinked, “Wait! I’m thinking!”

Yang Ye almost fainted!

If he wasn’t afraid of her strength, he would even teach her a good lesson!

Was she playing him for a fool?

Meanwhile, Qi Bitian said, “I just temporarily forgot. I’ll recall it soon!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

Qi Bitian sat down, tilted her head to the side, and started to think and think while Yang Ye waited and waited!

As he gazed at her, Yang Ye really wanted to give her a good beating!

Of course, he wasn’t insane, so he didn’t do it!

He didn’t dare to try and bully her!

Just like that, around two hours passed before she suddenly stood up. She gazed at Yang Ye, “I’ve got it!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

As she spoke, she formed a strange seal with both hands, and then a hexagonal array of light appeared before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye asked, “What’s this?”

She replied, “A teleportation formation. That place is being protected, so ordinary people can’t get there. Even if some people can sense it, it’s difficult for them to get there. Now that we have this, we can get there directly!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “We’re in the Primordial Pagoda!”

Qi Bitian replied, “It’s fine. It doesn’t make a difference. Now go inside!”

Yang Ye glanced at it and asked again, “This formation works, right?”

She glared at him, “You don’t trust me?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I-I’m just asking!”

Meanwhile, she waved her right hand, and Yang Ye was involuntarily pushed into the array.

After Yang Ye went in, the array suddenly emanated dazzling blue light, and then the world within the Primordial Pagoda turned ethereal!

…

The Central Region. The Xing Clan.

At the garden in the rear mountains of the Xing Clan, a middle aged man was taking care of the garden.

Some time passed before an old man arrived here.

The middle aged man stopped and asked, “What is it?”

The old man replied solemnly, “The Soul Sect said that they deserve the Ancient Sword Sect.”

The middle aged man nodded, “I’m not stopping them.”

The old man spoke solemnly, “Many unexpected things have occurred. Now, they want to know what your decision is.”

The middle aged man stopped, returned to the courtyard, and drank a cup of his own home brewed tea, “If the desolate race captures Eternal Kingdom, then the Ancient Sword Sect and everything else would be meaningless.”

He gazed at the old man and said, “Just tell them that.”

The old man hesitated for a moment and said, “But the problem is that they want the Ancient Sword Sect right now.”

The middle aged man shook his head, “Our target is the desolate race, and the all-powerful Desolate Emperor. Tell the Soul Sect that we won’t participate in the attack on the Ancient Sword Sect, at least not until the desolate race is dealt with. If they still intend to attack the Ancient Sword Sect, that will be their own business. But tell them that the Soul Sect has lost enough experts, and if they lose more, I’m afraid they won’t even have the right to get a piece of the piece.”

The old man bowed slightly and left.

Once the old man left, a petite young girl appeared out of thin air before the middle aged man.

The middle aged man grinned, “What’s your name?”

She replied indifferently, “Tian Xiu!”

Tian Xiu!

The young girl before him was Tian Xiu!

The middle aged man nodded slightly, “You’re from Eternal Border, or I should say, you were the patriarch of the Void Race, right?”

Tian Xiu said, “You’re really well-informed.”

The middle aged man smiled, “Besides Eternal Kingdom, some extraordinary figures have appeared in the outside world over the years. For example, the Desolate Emperor, you, and some others, of course.”

Tian Xiu said, “That has nothing to do with me.”

She stood up, “You’re the Eternal Lord, the one who rules over Eternal Kingdom, and some of the rules here were set by you, right?”

The Eternal Lord!

The middle aged man was the Eternal Lord!

Emperor Xing!

It wasn’t really a title he possessed, his name, Xing Di, could be read as Emperor Xing!

Emperor Xing chuckled, “I know what you’re thinking, and I’ve never broken the rules, right?”

Tian Xiu nodded slightly, “I hope you don’t ever break them!”

She turned around and walked away.

Meanwhile, Emperor Xing suddenly smiled, “What if I break the rules?”

Tian Xiu glanced at Emperor Xing, “If the desolate race fails to destroy Eternal Kingdom, then I, Tian Xiu, will do it!”

She vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

Emperor Xing finished his cup of tea and smiled, “How confident!”

…

A long time passed before Yang Ye gradually opened his eyes.

However, all he saw was pitch black darkness!

It was absolutely pitch black to the point he could see nothing. If he wasn’t certain that he was alright, he would think that he’d gone blind!

Yang Ye asked, “What’s going on?”

Some time passed before Qi Bitian’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “U-Um… I’m sorry, I sent you to the wrong place. You’re in Darkspace right now. Right, calm down, I’ll make a new teleportation formation immediately!”

Yang Ye almost spat out a mouthful of blood when he heard her!

Can you be a little more reliable?

Just a little!

Suddenly, Yang Ye heard swishing nearby.

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What’s that?”

He sent out his divine sense, but this expanse of space was boundless. It was like a huge black hole, and all he could sense was darkness, endless darkness!

Suddenly, quite a solemn expression appeared on Yang Ye’s face.

Because he noticed that if Qi Bitian didn’t help him, he may never be able to escape this dark space!

“These are Darkspawn!” Suddenly, Qi Bitian’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “They are beings that only live in Darkspace.”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked her about what he was actually concerned about, “Are they strong?”

Qi Bitian replied casually, “They’re nothing great!”

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief. Suddenly, his expression changed drastically, and then he felt sharp pain come from his chest. After that, he was blasted away like a cannonball!

“ARGH!” A shrill cry resounded!

It was Yang Ye’s voice!

It was quite miserable!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye’s figure to crash downward, and he forced himself to a stop. He looked down, and he noticed that a palm-size piece of flesh was missing from his chest!

It had been forcefully dug out!

Yang Ye was shocked. Of course, he felt even more anger, “Little Qi, this is what you call nothing great?”

A short while passed before she said, “Uh, I forgot that they are nothing great, but… they may be a little… very strong for you. Right, they are very strong!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened, and he almost flew into a rage!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically, and he didn’t hesitate to draw his sword.

A ray of sword energy rippled out!

However, it vanished without a trace as soon as it appeared!

Bang!

An instant later, Yang Ye was blasted away again!

“Screech!” An ear-piercing screech suddenly resounded here.

A chill ran down Yang Ye’s spine when he heard it. He knew that it was absolutely not something he could resist right now, so he hurriedly said, “Oh great Little Qi, is your formation ready or not?! If it isn’t, I’m going to leave my life here!”

When he swung that attack earlier, he’d sensed a strong feeling of pressure, and his sword intent and sword energy weren’t able to be sent away from him. They would be instantly obliterated upon leaving him!

He didn’t even dare to activate the Sword Domain because he was afraid that those mysterious Darkspawn would destroy it in an instant!

Simply speaking, it wasn’t a place he should be in!

Actually, he was a victim too. He had never wanted to come here!

Fortunately, Qi Bitian’s voice resounded, “I’m done!”

A moment later, a huge hexagonal array of light appeared before Yang Ye, and he quickly entered it. A ray of blue light enveloped him, and then he vanished on the spot.

A moment of silence ensued in the Darkspace, and then countless strange cries resounded abruptly!

…

Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye finally didn’t feel like he was in danger anymore, but he was still in the teleportation passageway.

Yang Ye calmed himself and said, “Little Qi, you must be careful! I was almost killed by those mysterious Darkspawn just now!”

Qi Bitian smiled embarrassedly in the Primordial Pagoda, “I haven’t done this in so long, so I made a mistake in my calculations. That’s why we hit a little snag in our travels. It’s alright!”

A little snag!

Yang Ye spoke seriously, “There’s no problem this time, right?”

Qi Bitian hurriedly replied, “Yes, there’ll be absolutely no problems this time.”

Yang Ye was still not too certain, but in any case, he was mentally prepared. He was prepared to enter into battle at a moment’s notice!

Just like that, some time passed before the scene in front of Yang Ye changed.

Yang Ye appeared on a bridge, a seemingly endless bridge. There was endless crimson black water on both sides of the bridge!

Besides that, the area was covered in mist, so he couldn’t see anything clearly!

The entire area was strange, so Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly and remained vigilant at all times!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and asked, “This is the Origin?”

In the Primordial Pagoda, Qi Bitian blinked, “I should be… Maybe… Perhaps… I think so…”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
