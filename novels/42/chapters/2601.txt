Chapter 2602

This time, the woman was dead!

Truly dead!

Her attainments in the Space Domain were much greater than before, but his Sword Domain was tremendously stronger than before.

Coupled with Executor’s help, he’d directly destroyed her Space Domain!

He’d crushed it with absolute strength!

Regardless of whether it was the Space Domain or his Sword Domain, they weren’t truly invincible. Once a person’s strength was at a certain level, that person could destroy these Domains with overwhelming strength!

Presently, his strength was entirely capable of destroying her Space Domain!

Along with the woman’s death, the Soul Sect was shocked!

It didn’t take long for a powerful aura to suddenly appear near Yang Ye, and then a black robed figure appeared before him.

The Soul Exalt!

The Soul Exalt gazed coldly at Yang Ye.

At this moment, he was shocked too. Yang Ye had grown to such an extent in this short amount of time!

This speed of growth was really quite heaven defying!

The Soul Exalt restrained his thoughts, sized up Yang Ye, and said, “It’s only been a few days, but you…”

Hiss!

A flying sword shot forward.

The Soul Exalt’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then a pitch black awl suddenly appeared before him.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then a ray of sword energy exploded apart. There was a sword within the sword energy, and at this moment, the sword was being forcefully stopped in its tracks by the black awl. It couldn’t move forward at all!

A Super Divine Treasure!

The Soul Awl emanated powerful Soul Energy to stop Yang Ye’s sword, and Yang Ye’s absolutely powerful sword energy wasn’t that sharp anymore when facing the Soul Awl!

Suddenly, the Soul Exalt tapped his finger forward.

A strand of powerful Soul Energy erupted from within the Soul Awl, and it instantly blasted Yang Ye’s sword away! Moreover, the energy swept toward Yang Ye like a storm.

Yang Ye stood there without dodging it at all!

As soon as the Soul Energy arrived near him, they just vanished mysteriously!

The Soul Energy couldn’t get close to him at all!

The Sword Domain Sphere!

His Sword Domain Sphere may be focused on offensive capabilities, but it was still usable defensively.

The Soul Exalt’s face was extremely solemn!

The facts proved that Yang Ye wasn’t the same anymore!

Yang Ye’s sword was a truly huge threat to Lord Realm experts!

Meanwhile, another sword appeared in Yang Ye’s grasp!

Executor!

In the past, he’d relied on it too much, and that was why he had failed to make it acknowledge him as its master. Now, while he still couldn’t fully control it and bring forth its full strength, he wasn’t relying on it anymore. His sword intent could make Executor even stronger.

Now, their relationship was an equal one. No one transcended above the other, and they perfected each other’s strength instead!

Along with the appearance of Executor, the Soul Exalt’s face grew even more solemn!

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and then a strand of powerful sword energy flashed.

The Soul Exalt’s pupils constricted, and then he raised both his hands. The Soul Awl suddenly started spinning, and then sharp and ear piercing tearing sounds resounded!

Powerful Soul Energy surged incessantly from the Soul Awl, and even space was easily torn apart by it!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword arrived.

Bang!

A rumbling explosion resounded through the sky!

Countless rays of sword energy and Soul Energy surged incessantly toward the surroundings, throwing the entire sky into chaos!

Suddenly, Executor vanished from Yang Ye’s grasp, and then it charged at the Soul Awl!

The Soul Exalt was about to wield the Soul Awl again, but Yang Ye suddenly appeared before him!

Yang Ye looked the Soul Exalt in the eyes, “They have their own battle, and we have ours!”

Super Divine Treasure against Super Divine Treasure, and man against man!

The Soul Exalt suddenly chuckled, “Amazing. After just one trip to that world, you’ve changed from inside out. I should have stopped at nothing to kill you before, I really should have!”

Yang Ye nodded, “You still have a chance now, so feel free to try!”

As soon as he finished speaking, two swords appeared on either side of him!

An instant later, they transformed into two rays of sword energy that shot at the Soul Exalt!

The Soul Exalt grinned ferociously, and then he suddenly raised his hands. Two daggers appeared in his grasp.

Daggers that emanated powerful Soul Energy!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s swords arrived!

At the same time, the Soul Exalt swung his daggers.

Clang! Clang!

Along with two clear and melodious clangs, Yang Ye’s swords were blasted away, but they hadn’t flown far before two hands grabbed them!

Yang Ye’s hands!

Yang Ye shot over to the Soul Exalt!

Dual swords!

Yang Ye chose to fight in close quarters because it was an absolute strong point of his!

As soon as he got close to the Soul Exalt, Yang Ye executed the Madness Sword Technique!

Sword energy rained down from the sky. In just two breaths of time, the Soul Exalt had been blasted very far away, and Yang Ye refused to give him any time to catch his breath. He couldn’t dodge at all or create distance between him and Yang Ye!

Boom!

Finally, an explosion resounded and a figure was blasted away!

The Soul Exalt!

Meanwhile, two swords were following closely behind the figure!

Yang Ye refused to give him even a moment to catch his breath!

Right when the swords were about to strike the Soul Exalt, the Soul Exalt hurriedly crushed a talisman in this moment of horror. A moment later, an ethereal figure condensed before him!

The ethereal figure!

It was his life-saving trump card!

The ethereal figure suddenly raised its right hand, and a powerful Soul Energy vortex appeared at its palm. An instant later, Yang Ye’s flying swords were forcefully stopped by the Soul Energy emanated by it!

The swords suddenly flew backward to Yang Ye’s side!

Yang Ye gazed at the ethereal figure with indifference.

He knew it should be the Soul Master, but it wasn’t the Soul Master’s true body!

The ethereal figure gazed at Yang Ye in silence and didn’t attack!

Suddenly, Yang Ye raised his palm, and then the Sword Precursor appeared in his grasp, and then countless strands of sword intent converged.

A breath of time later, Yang Ye was in front of the figure!

Meanwhile, the vortex suddenly expanded rapidly in the ethereal figure’s palm to form a huge 3km wide vortex, and it enveloped Yang Ye!

A moment of silence ensued in the sky…

Boom!

The black vortex of souls exploded apart, and then countless rays of sword energy appeared throughout the sky.

Yang Ye was still there, and so was the ethereal figure!

The Soul Exalt stared into the distance.

Who won? Who lost?

Suddenly, a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of Yang Ye’s mouth. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The ethereal figure suddenly said, “A Domain of the sword…”

The ethereal figure gradually turned translucent and vanished in the sky.

The Soul Awl and the Soul Exalt vanished along with it!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, and his pale countenance gradually returned to normal.

Yang Ye looked down, and the pitch black palace had vanished.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and unleashed the Sword Domain, but he still couldn’t find the pitch black palace!

The palace and all the experts from the Soul Sect had been moved away!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, and then a black shadow appeared before him.

The shadow flicked a box over to Yang Ye, and there was a Worldborn Fruit within it!

The shadow said, “My Master ordered me to return this to you, and my Master said that we will refrain from interfering in your business with the Soul Sect from now on. Good luck.”

The shadow vanished on the spot upon finishing.

Yang Ye put the box away and smiled, “This isn’t the end of it!”

Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

The Soul Sect had gone completely into hiding, and he couldn’t do anything about that. However, some powers couldn’t just go into hiding!

Yang Ye left the West Region and entered the East Region!

However, as soon as he entered the East Region, an old man appeared before him. The old man was the Lu Clan’s Patriarch Lu Yanming.

There were three white haired old men behind him!

All of them were peak Lord Realm experts!

Lu Yanming glanced at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, do you really plan to incur public wrath? Everyone isn’t targeting the Ancient Sword Sect and you right now all because of the desolate race. But if you go too far, then the consequences will definitely not be something you and the Ancient Sword Sect can bear. Even if you refuse to think for your own sake, think for your sect’s and friends’ sakes.”

Yang Ye glanced at him, “Alright, go on! Continue! Why aren’t you continuing?”

Lu Yanming’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Yang Ye, do you really think no one in Eternal Kingdom can stop you?”

Yang Ye walked slowly in Lu Yanming's direction while a sword floated on either side of him.

All of their expressions turned solemn when they saw Yang Ye walking in their direction.

They feared Yang Ye. Actually, they feared Yang Ye’s backing even more.

Suddenly, Yang Ye stopped and glanced at the surroundings, “I’m here today to seek justice. The Lu Clan sent its forces to help the Soul Sect attack my Ancient Sword Sect. What do you plan to do about that? I’ll wait for your answer. If it’s a good answer, I’ll leave. Otherwise, I’ll use my sword to help you with it. Don’t try to threaten me with Destiny Realm experts either. Even though I’m all alone by myself and have no backing… Yes, I really don’t have any backing. If you have Destiny Realm experts, feel free to send them at me. If they truly do attack me, then I’ll definitely run. I’m not joking!”
