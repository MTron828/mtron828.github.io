Chapter 1889 – I Want To Kill That Bastard!

Fight the experts of the upper universe!

All of them fell silent. Their faces were quite gloomy.

“Everyone, farewell!” Suddenly, Hao Tian stood up abruptly. He cupped his fist to the others and vanished.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and followed after Hao Tian.

In the starry sky.

Hao Tian stopped. He turned to look at Yang Ye and smiled, “Let me guess, you’re here to ask if Gu Ya was telling the truth, right?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Hao Tian looked up at Heaven Pillar Mountain’s towering figure that rose deep into the starry sky, “In the past, someone once said something which I felt made a lot of sense. The weak have no dignity, no rights, and no freedom. As far as the upper universe is concerned, everyone in this universe is weak.”

Yang Ye immediately came to an understanding when he heard this.

Sure enough, this world really was like a farm.

Hao Tian smiled, “Is it cruel? Even if we’re all humans, there are many times in life when everyone else won’t treat other humans as humans.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Hao Tian added, “Actually, reality is even more brutal than you imagined.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished into the sky.

“The strong prey on the weak!” Suddenly, a voice resounded from behind Yang Ye.

Yang Ye turned to look, and he saw a woman in a red dress floating over. It was the woman in a red dress from Moment Mountain.

She glanced at the depths of space and said, “Actually, a very long time ago, evil cultivators weren’t called evil cultivators, and devil cultivators weren’t called devil cultivators. We were all called cultivators. However, someone gave all of us a new definition later on. Righteousness, evil, and devil were merely excuses that some people made up to eliminate those who were different from them!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he looked up at Heaven Pillar Mountain, “I want to revive my second sister and find Zi’er. Once I’m done with that, I’ll return to Merak System. From then on, everything in this world won’t be related to me anymore!”

“Peace?” The woman in a red dress shook her head slightly, “When the time comes, you’ll realize that peace is just a dream!”

Yang Ye didn’t say anything. A ray of light flashed beneath his feet, and he vanished on the spot.

Feng Yu Forest.

Yang Ye returned to Feng Yu Forest. He didn’t go to the pergola, and he went to the bamboo house instead. His figure stiffened when he walked in.

There was a painting on the wall in the house, and it was the painting of a woman. He just happened to recognize her.

It was his mother!

Yang Ye’s eyes were filled with disbelief, “That’s impossible…”

Suddenly, Gu Ya appeared by Yang Ye’s side and asked, “You recognize the woman on that painting?”

Yang Ye gazed at Gu Ya, “Who does this bamboo house belong to?”

Gu Ya shook his head slightly, “The blind man!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “The blind man?”

Gu Ya nodded, “A very long time ago, someone came to Heaven Pillar Mountain. He was blind, and he’d even lost both his hands. His identity was very mysterious, and he was extremely strong. He was the 2nd person that dragon didn’t dare to offend!”

Blind and without hands!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Why did he have this painting?”

Gu Ya gazed at Yang Ye, “You recognize the person on it?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Gu Ya glanced at Yang Ye and said, “So it’s you…”

Yang Ye gazed at Gu Ya, “What do you mean?”

Gu Ya gazed at the painting and said, “He saved my life. After that, he said he was going somewhere, so he asked me to take care of this place and protect it from harm. Besides that, he said that if I met someone who recognized the woman in the painting, then I should pass a message to that person…”

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

Gu Ya answered, “Sorry!”

Yang Ye slowly clenched his fists, and no one knew what he was thinking.

Gu Ya said, “Who was he to you?”

Yang Ye shook his head and left the bamboo house.

…

On the peak of a mountain in the boundless mountain range.

Yang Lianshuang and the others were before Yang Ye. Besides them, Su Qingshi, Zhuang Weiran, and the others had been brought over from the Yang Clan as well.

If he was going to the large universe, he naturally intended to bring all of them with him.

Yang Ye glanced at Nether Maiden and the others, “All of you’re at the 6th stage of the True Realm?”

They nodded.

Yang Ye looked up at Heaven Pillar Mountain, “We’re going to the large universe in two weeks from now!”

The large universe!

Two weeks passed in the blink of an eye.

Early in the morning.

Heaven Pillar Mountain suddenly started trembling.

The barrier had started to weaken!

At this moment, countless looked up towards the mountain.

In the 12th level of Heaven Pillar Mountain.

It was a restricted area here, and usually no one dared to come here. But at this moment, 11 people had appeared here.

They were led by Gu Ya, and Yang Ye was amongst them.

Suddenly, a huge dragon head emerged from above the clouds. It was the Candle Dragon!

The Candle Dragon looked down at them with indifference, but there was a trace of fear deep within his eyes.

Not a single one of the people before him was ordinary.

The Candle Dragon’s gaze stopped on Yang Ye, and then he gazed at Gu Ya, “You’ve decided to head up there?”

Gu Ya smiled, “Brother Candle Dragon, you should understand that going up there is our only hope!”

The Candle Dragon replied, “You may find despair instead!”

Gu Ya replied, “It’s better than waiting for death to arrive!”

The Candle Dragon shook his head, “Since you’ve decided, I won’t say anything. Good luck!”

He was about to leave after he finished speaking, but he seemed to have thought of something and suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, “Kid, I advise you not to head up there.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

The Candle Dragon replied, “The Sovereign of Sky has started to investigate you. If I’m not wrong, he won’t allow his daughter to have anything to do with a person like you!”

“A person like me?” Yang Ye chuckled, “Senior, what’s wrong with me? So our friendship brings shame to him?”

The Candle Dragon looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Since you refuse to listen, then do as you wish!”

He vanished into the clouds once he finished speaking.

Gu Ya suddenly said, “Let’s go!”

As soon as he finished speaking, they charged up into the sky. It didn’t take long for them to arrive in the boundless starry sky, and an ethereal barrier of light resided above them.

The barrier!

The barrier that separated their universes!

Gu Ya glanced at everyone and said, “Who will do it?”

Suddenly, a voice resounded from the group, “Yang Ye, of course!”

Yang Ye looked over. The person who said that was one of the three ancient cultivators, Qian Xie. Yang Ye glanced at him and didn’t say a word. Since Qian Xie had been targeting him since the moment they met, it was obvious that there was more to it.

Meanwhile, Qian Xie said, “Everyone here is a peak existence in this universe, but allow me to be honest, what ability does Yang Ye have to stand with us? Because he has the Sovereign of Man’s sword?”

Gu Ya gazed at Yang Ye and smiled, “Young Brother, what do you think?”

Only the strong were respected, and only the strong could be treated as equals and respected. It was an unchanging principle of this world!

Yang Ye naturally understood that. He glanced at them, and then his gaze descended onto Qian Xie, “Let’s make a bet. Do you dare?”

“A bet?” Qian Xie spoke with disdain, “I’m not interested!”

Yang Ye’s face turned cold, “If I’m not wrong, the Night Emperor and the Red Robed Heavenly Exalt were your subordinates, right?”

Qian Xie spoke indifferently, “If you say so!”

Suddenly, Yang Ye withdrew his sword and said, “Everyone, I’ve changed my mind. I’m not going to the large universe today.”

Everyone here was speechless.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye pointed his sword at Qian Xie, “I’m going to kill this bastard!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a mysterious wave of energy swept out.

The Sword Domain!

Everyone’s expressions changed slightly when the Sword Domain enveloped them, and then they flashed backwards and left the area covered by the Sword Domain. There was no enmity between them and Yang Ye, so they would naturally not destroy his Sword Domain by force.

Sword energy flashed!

Qian Xie’s expression changed slightly when he saw this. A black curved blade instantly appeared in his grasp, and then he grabbed it with both hands and swung it forward.

It seemed even capable of slashing the heavens open!

Bang!

An explosion resounded in the clouds, and the aftershock from the collision caused space in a huge area to quake as if it would collapse at any moment.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye and Qian Xie were pushed backwards repeatedly, but it didn’t take long for them to shoot at each other.

Sword howls resounded incessantly.

Everyone here had quite weird expressions on their faces when they saw Yang Ye fight Qian Xie. They’d looked down on Yang Ye a little in the past. Because Yang Ye was just a junior and at the 6th stage of the True Realm, the gap between them was huge.

Even though Yang Ye’s combat strength was extraordinary, as far as they were concerned, it was only because of the Sovereign of Man’s sword. Yet now, Yang Ye wasn’t using the Sovereign of Man’s sword!

It proved that Yang Ye’s strength was on par with them!

Bang!

Yang Ye and Qian Xie split apart, and then they were about to attack again. However, Gu Ya suddenly appeared before them.

Gu Ya glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Young Brother Yang, you’ve proved your strength. As for the enmity between you two, you can deal with it in the upper universe, alright? Don’t worry, I believe that Brother Qian Xie won’t look for trouble with you until then.”

He gazed at Qian Xie and continued, “Right?”

Qian Xie glanced coldly at Yang Ye and didn’t say a word.

Yang Ye glanced at Qian Xie and said, “I like watching you being helpless when you want to kill me!”

Qian Xie’s face instantly became gloomy.

Meanwhile, Gu Ya gazed at Yang Ye, “Young Brother Yang, your sword is the bane of that barrier. So, why don’t you complete the first step?”

Yang Ye looked up at the ethereal barrier of light. He fell silent for a short while, and then he intended to act. However, the ethereal barrier of light suddenly started trembling, and then a figure flashed out from there.

Someone had come from the upper universe!

Everyone watched as a man in violet armor appeared before them.

At this moment, the armored man was clearly very weak, and his countenance was extremely pale. He was stunned when he saw Yang Ye and the others. There are so many people here?

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “Did the Sovereign of Man send you here for Yang Ye?”

The armored man gazed at the man in green clothes who’d asked the question, “How did you know?”

Suddenly, a mysterious wave of energy appeared here.

The Sword Domain!

A moment later, Yang Ye appeared behind the armored man. At this moment, the armored man’s body had stiffened, and his eyes were opened wide and filled with disbelief.

Yang Ye put his sword away and spoke indifferently, “I guessed!”

Hiss!

As soon as he finished speaking, the armored man’s head flew up into the air!
