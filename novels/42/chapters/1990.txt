Chapter 1991 – Absolute Hell!

Yang Ye left the hall with the white robed old man.

Yang Ye asked, “Where are we going?”

The old man replied with a question, “How did you meet my master?”

Yang Ye glanced at the old man, “By chance. Why?”

The old man shook his head slightly, “I was just curious.”

As he spoke, he looked towards the distance. There was a strange hall there. It was oval, pitch black, and emanated mysterious light.

The old man said, “The Asura Grounds!”

“The Asura Grounds?” Yang Ye gazed at it, “What do you mean?”

The white robed old man explained, “My god race has many ways to foster geniuses, and the Asura Grounds is one of them, and it’s one of the more brutal places.”

As soon as he finished speaking, they arrived at the hall’s entrance.

Meanwhile, the old man gazed at Yang Ye, “The Asura Grounds is also called Purgatory. Master wants me to help you ascend to the 5th stage of the Enlightened Realm and do so without causing any side effects. So, I chose Purgatory for you. My method is very simple, and it’s to unearth your potential as far as possible. However, it’s dangerous, so mentally prepare yourself!”

Yang Ye gazed at the hall and nodded slightly, “I’m ready!”

The old man nodded, and then he waved his right hand. In an instant, a blue circle appeared below Yang Ye’s feet, and then he vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye suddenly felt dizzy, but it didn’t take long for that feeling to vanish. Yang Ye opened his eyes, and then he saw nothing.

The surroundings were pitch black!

Suddenly!

Hiss!

A gash was torn open on Yang Ye’s back, and his figure was blasted away.

Yang Ye was visibly stunned when he hit the ground.

What the hell?

Hiss!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s chest suddenly cracked open, and a string of blood sprayed. At this moment, Yang Ye’s expression finally changed.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The sound of air being torn open resounded incessantly while blood sprayed from Yang Ye!

However, Yang Ye wasn’t able to see his opponent at all.

Hiss!

Meanwhile, another string of blood sprayed from a new gash on Yang Ye’s body. It wasn’t that his opponent was holding back, it was that his body was too strong, so while his opponent could cut through his body, it couldn’t go deep enough to be lethal. However, if this continued, Yang Ye would definitely die from loss of blood!

On the outside.

Zhi’er asked softly while standing by the old man’s side, “How is he?”

The old man fell silent for a moment and replied, “He has quite a bit of problems, and he hasn’t tempered himself well enough.” He looked in the direction of the hall, “He’s a good piece of metal, but there are quite a bit of impurities in him. He can only be called a Sword Saint if he can remove them!”

A Sword Saint!

Zhi’er’s eyes narrowed slightly. The Sword Saint was a title in the god race. The god race had a long history, but only few were ever able to become a Sword Saint.

Zhi’er asked, “He has the potential to become one?”

The old man nodded slightly, “A saint of the sword. His sword is his own. While there are marks of many others in it, the core is still his own. Obviously, he has been guided by an expert. If…”

The old man paused for a moment and continued, “If he’s willing to discard some things and fully free his sword, then his sword would be even purer and sharper.”

“Then he wouldn’t be himself anymore!” Zhi’er spoke indifferently, “Do you know how many times I thought of killing him?”

The old man asked, “Why?”

She replied, “Some things he possesses are even tempting to me! If I obtained them, it would be enormously helpful to me. But I could never convince myself to kill him!”

The old man asked, “Why?”

Zhi’er looked towards the direction of the hall, “His sincerity and loyalty.”

The old man nodded slightly, “I see!”

Meanwhile, Zhi’er flicked a small white bottle to the old man, “Give this to him later!”

The old man’s expression changed, “Master, that’s…”

Zhi’er replied, “Since I’ve chosen not to become enemies with him, then we should do our best to be friends. He’s loyal, and he’ll remember the kindness we show him. So, you don’t have to worry about him doing anything that’ll be disadvantageous to us.”

The old man hesitated for a moment and nodded, “As you wish, Master!”

She nodded slightly and glanced at the surroundings, “Uncle Guan, can you deal with that evil treasure for him?”

The old man spoke solemnly, “It’s best to leave it alone!”

She asked, “Why?”

The old man shot a glance behind them and said, “It possesses a fully formed intelligence. If we act against it, we’ll definitely incur its resentment. It would be fine if we could kill it, but if we can’t, the problem we face will be quite serious.”

Zhi’er asked, “Can’t we kill it?”

“We can!” The old man continued, “But we’ll have to pay a certain price.”

Zhi’er asked, “What price?”

“Your god race will be exposed!” An icy cold voice came from behind her.

Zhi’er turned around, and she saw a ball of red light not too far away from her.

The ball of red light continued, “If I’m destroyed, this place will collapse in an instant. Your god race isn’t the same god race that it was all those years ago. If you’re exposed prematurely, I’m afraid you’ll be instantly obliterated by the other races!”

“How dare you!” The white robed old man waved his right hand, and a ray of white light flashed.

Bang!

The red ball of light was blasted 3km away, but countless rays of red light shot up into the air just a moment later. In an instant, the space in a huge area started trembling violently.

“Stop!” A cold shout resounded, and then a mysterious wave of energy appeared here. The space in the surroundings gradually returned to normal.

The old man intended to attack again, but Zhi’er waved her hand, “Forget it!”

The old man nodded slightly and stopped.

Zhi’er gazed at the ball of light, “While the god race has suffered a decline in strength, it still has the ability to kill you.”

“Is that so?” The ball of red light laughed ferociously, “I was born with the universe, and I’m linked to the quintessence of this universe. Killing me will damage the quintessence of this universe! The god race once stood above the universe, but why don’t you try now. See if the spirit of this universe will let you kill me!”

Zhi’er’s eyes narrowed slightly and gradually became icy cold. Meanwhile, the old man shook his head slightly, “You’re right. While we can’t kill you, we can still seal you!”

“You want to go down with me?” The voice laughed coldly, “So long as your god race wants that, I’ll accompany you to the end!”

The old man gazed at Zhi’er, and the latter chuckled abruptly, “You want to acknowledge him as your master, kill him, and then use him to perfect yourself, right?”

The ball of red light spoke coldly, “So what if I do?”

Zhi’er chuckled, “Unfortunately, you don’t dare to do it.”

The ball of red light fell silent.

Zhi’er spoke indifferently, “Allow me to give you a warning. Even the heavens can’t survive if it seeks death, let alone you. Don’t just look at the benefits and ignore the danger. He possesses the inheritance of the Dao Path and Weapon Path, and he’s linked with the karma of two supreme experts. Not to mention you, even my god race doesn’t dare to rashly kill him. As for you, allow me to be honest, no matter whether if it’s the Dao Path, Weapon Path, or those two experts, they aren’t people you can go against!”

“Is that so?” The ball of red light smiled, “I must admit that his background isn’t ordinary, but do you think I’m all alone?”

Zhi’er frowned slightly while the old man’s face became quite gloomy.

In the Asura Grounds.

Yang Ye was covered in blood.

The entire place was pitch black, and blood frequently sprayed from Yang Ye. It wasn’t that he refused to dodge them, it was that he couldn’t! The things which attacked him were too elusive, so he couldn’t dodge them at all.

The Sword Domain!

Yang Ye had thought of the Sword Domain. He could locate them if he used the Sword Domain, but the old man prohibited him from doing so!

He couldn’t use it!

Yang Ye was very puzzled. However, he listened to the old man and didn’t use it.

In the darkness, Yang Ye slowly closed his eyes while blood sprayed from time to time.

He was trying to sense them!

He didn’t use his eyes because those fellows in the darkness were far faster than anything his eyes could capture. So, it would be impossible to catch them with his eyes. He had to use his heart, but he still couldn’t see anything!

His heart couldn’t sense anything!

Yang Ye was quite lost.

Meanwhile, the old man’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “There are four types of eyes in the world. The naked eye, the eye of the heart, the eye of the sky…” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The old man paused for a moment and continued, “You’re attained the eye of the heart, but that’s far from enough. The reason you can’t see the evil treasure that follows you is because your vision isn’t enough.”

Yang Ye asked, “How do I attain the eye of the sky?”

“It’s very simple!” The old man continued, “Sense the world, control it, and rely on the spirit of everything to be your eyes to see all things!”

Sense the world!

Yang Ye fell silent while blood still ceaselessly sprayed from him.

Time trickled by. A long time later, Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes and grabbed towards his left. He grabbed a blood red claw!

Yang Ye pulled and slammed it down.

Boom!

Something exploded apart in the darkness.

“Looks like you’ve comprehended a little!” The old man’s voice resounded once more in Yang Ye’s mind, “However, it’s only the beginning, and it won’t be long before you understand why this place is called purgatory!”

As soon as the old man finished speaking, Yang Ye saw many blood red eyes in the darkness.

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then a sword appeared in his right grasp!

“Once you experience purgatory, your sword will be sharper, more vicious, and crueler!” The old man’s voice resounded once more, “Of course, the precondition is that you’re able to leave this place alive!”

Hiss!

As soon as the old man finished speaking, an arm that held a sword flew up into the air.

It was Yang Ye’s hang!

Was a sword cultivator without his hand still a sword cultivator?
