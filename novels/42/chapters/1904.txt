Chapter 1905 – I Only Used 30% of My Strength!

Suddenly, Bei Cangyue appeared before them.

The old man glanced at Bei Cangyue and said, “Young Miss Yue, you agreed to stop them from leaving and heading to the Shaman Dimension.

Bei Cangyue replied, “I’m sorry. Something unexpected happened!”

The old man spoke indifferently, “Forget it. We’ll forget it ever happened. Young Miss Yue, we want to go to the Shaman Dimension. Please let us through!”

“Of course!” Bei Cangyue smiled and looked up at the sky, “Uncle Zhen, please open the gate!”

A moment of silence ensued, then the gate suddenly started opening slowly.

“Farewell!” As soon as the old man finished speaking, he vanished on the spot with the young girl.

Bei Cangyue’s smile gradually vanished as she watched them leave, “The Shaman Hunter Clan is still so proud!”

Suddenly, a voice came from high above, “They have the ability to act like that!”

Bei Cangyue nodded slightly, “They do…”

Meanwhile, the voice resounded again, “Don’t get mixed up in this!”

Bei Cangyue looked up at the sky, “You’re worried about the Nansi Clan?”

The voice replied, “No, it’s that young man!”

Bei Cangyue was puzzled, “Why?”

The voice replied, “He’s not ordinary!

He’s not ordinary!

Bei Cangyue frowned slightly because it wasn’t easy to make the person who was speaking to her say those words!

Meanwhile, the voice asked, “You’re going to the Shaman Dimension too?”

Bei Cangyue nodded slightly, “I’ve gathered some friends, and I plan to try my luck.”

The voice fell silent for a moment and said, “It’s worth the risk! Be careful!”

…

Once they left the Northern Sky Gate, they immediately sped up, and it didn’t take long for a boundless mountain range to appear within their fields of vision.

It was extremely tall and endless.

“Broken Cliff Mountain Range!” Meanwhile, Nansi Yin suddenly said, “This is Broken Cliff Mountain Range. The renowned Broken Cliff Mountain is at the end of the mountain range, and the Shaman Dimension is just beyond it.”

Broken Cliff Mountain! The Sky Dimension!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and sped up. However, Nansi Yin suddenly grabbed him, “We can’t continue flying!”

Yang Ye gazed at her with a puzzled expression on his face, “Why?”

She explained, “Even though this isn’t the shaman race’s territory yet, there are experts from the shaman race here, and there even human experts here. We’ll be too conspicuous if we fly through the air, and it’s easy for trouble to find us. Especially the shaman race, it’s very likely that they’ll attack once they sense the aura of humans.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and descended to the ground with her.

Even though Yang Ye was walking swiftly on the ground, his mind was immersed within him, “Senior Hou Qing, we’re almost at the Shaman Dimension. Can you come out now?”

Hou Qing suddenly asked, “Are you sure that you want to let me out?”

Yang Ye smiled, “If I wasn’t going to let you out, then why would I have come here with you?”

Hou Qing replied, “Kid, I know about your secrets!”

Yang Ye asked, “What are you trying to say?!”

Hou Qing answered, “Once I leave and expose your secrets to the Shaman Progenitor, you’ll definitely die!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Will you?”

Hou Qing replied, “No one can say for sure.”

Yang Ye replied, “I’m someone who repays kindness with kindness and enmity with enmity. There was enmity between us, but it has been resolved. Moreover, you’ve helped me repeatedly and given me the cultivation techniques of the shaman race. That’s a kindness to me, and I naturally have to repay such kindness. So, you can leave at any time.”

Hou Qing fell silent for quite some time and said, “I can’t leave for now.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Hou Qing explained, “If I’m not wrong, people are monitoring my location, and my body hasn’t recovered fully yet. So, if I appear in the Shaman Dimension, I’ll die. The brutality of the shaman race is much more terrifying than the human race.”

Yang Ye asked, “Then what do you plan to do?”

Hou Qing replied, “I plan to stay with you for now, and I’ll return to the shaman race and take back what’s mine once I’ve fully recovered my strength and body. Of course, while I can’t show myself here, I can help you get to the Sky Dimension!”

Yang Ye nodded and restrained his thoughts. He sped up again in the world outside.

Four hours later, Yang Ye and Nansi Yin finally stopped.

At this moment, there was a mountain that towered into the clouds standing before them.

Broken Cliff Mountain.

It was the border between the Human Dimension and Shaman Dimension.

Yang Ye was about to go over when he suddenly frowned, and then a pitch black pike suddenly appeared just two centimeters away from his forehead.

It had just appeared out of nowhere!

Yang Ye’s reaction wasn’t slow at all. He grabbed the pike with his left hand as soon as it appeared before his forehead. But the force carried within it blasted him backwards, and he only stopped after being pushed over 1km back.

Meanwhile, an old man and young woman had appeared not too far in front of Yang Ye. The woman was the woman whom he’d severed an arm from earlier, but her arm was healed now.

The Shaman Hunter Clan!

Yang Ye’s face turned gloomy when he saw them. They really just refuse to give up!

Yang Ye tossed the pike at the old man.

Hiss!

Air was split open.

The old man stretched out his right hand, and a ball of black light appeared in his palm. As soon as the pike struck the black light, it instantly calmed down, and the old man didn’t move even half a step back.

Meanwhile, Nansi Yin’s voice resounded, “Be careful! He’s a 2nd stage Enlightened Realm expert!”

2nd stage!

Yang Ye gazed at her, “How many stages does the Enlightened Realm have?”

Nansi Yin seemed astounded, “You don’t know?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She glanced at him with a strange gaze in her eyes and said, “Five. After attaining the Enlightened Realm, every advancement of a stage is extremely difficult. So, every advancement provides a huge increase in combat strength. Let me explain it like this. Ten 1st stage Enlightened Realm experts may only be able to barely fight a 2nd stage Enlightened Realm expert. Of course, extraordinary geniuses who can surmount their realms of cultivation to do battle are excluded from that!”

The 2nd stage of the Enlightened Realm!

Yang Ye looked up at the old man. No wonder the old man’s strength feels much stronger than the young woman by his side.

The 2nd stage of the Enlightened Realm!

He was only at the peak of the 6th stage of the True Realm right now!

The old man sized up Yang Ye and said, “You possess such strength at such an age… You truly are extraordinary. But…”

His expression became quite vicious at this point, “How dare you kill a member of my Shaman Hunter Clan?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Old man, first get it through your head that it was your clan which wanted to kill me first!”

The old man stared at Yang Ye, “As a human, you possess the bloodline of the shaman race and have cultivated the shaman race’s cultivation technique! So, you deserve death!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “What the fuck does that have to do with you?!”

“You’re courting death!” The old man was furious, and he transformed into a ray of light that shot towards Yang Ye.

The energy he emanated caused a huge expanse of space to ripple.

Needless to say, the old man’s aura was extremely terrifying. At the very least, Yang Ye felt pressured and slightly suffocated by it!

A vicious flow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, and then he took a step forward before swinging his sword.

Bang!

A huge vortex of energy erupted, and it instantly swallowed both Yang Ye and the old man. Moreover, explosions and sword howls resounded incessantly from within the vortex.

A 6th stage True Realm expert vs as 2nd stage Enlightened Realm expert!

Nansi Yin had an extremely complicated expression in her eyes. Even though she was at the Enlightened Realm and was an expert from a large clan, it was clearly impossible for her to fight the old man if she was just at the 6th stage of the True Realm.

Because the old man’s cultivation hadn’t been gained through help from external forces! He was a true Enlightened Realm expert!

But Yang Ye was able to fight such a 2nd stage Enlightened Realm expert while he was only at the 6th stage of the True Realm!

Yang Ye was an absolutely monstrous genius!

Boom!

Suddenly, an explosion resounded, and then two figures were blasted away.

It was Yang Ye and the old man.

As his figure flew, Yang Ye pointed his finger at the old man. In an instant, the space before the old man was torn open, and then a ray of light flashed out and slashed down towards the old man!

The old man’s expression changed slightly. He tightened his grip on his pike, and then swung it forward.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s sword energy was blasted apart, but the old man was pushed back again.

Suddenly, the old man slowed down!

The Sword Domain!

Yang Ye had activated the Sword Domain. At this moment, the old man was horrified. Because Yang Ye was in front of him now, and a sword had arrived with Yang Ye.

The sword was stabbing towards his forehead!

It was an attack capable of obliterating everything around it, and it was the first time the old man sensed danger in this battle!

He didn’t dare act carelessly at all, and his profound energy surged madly. An instant later, all of it entered his pike, and then he swung his pike with both hands!

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded, and the old man’s pike was obliterated while his figure was blasted away.

But that wasn’t the end of it. Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot.

Split Second combined with the Sword Domain!

Yang Ye had executed the same attack again!

This time, the old man didn’t have a chance to dodge or defend himself.

Yang Ye appeared not too far behind the old man, and the old man’s body stiffened on the spot. An instant later, his body split open from the center, and both blood and internal organs sprayed out.

Yang Ye lowered his sword and looked at the young woman, “I’m not joking, I only used 30% of my strength just now! That old man was really too weak.”Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The young woman was stunned speechless.
