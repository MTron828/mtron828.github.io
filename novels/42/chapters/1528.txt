Chapter 1529 - Yang Ye! I’ve Been Waiting For You!

Translator: InVader

Bored of killing Rebirth Realm experts!

Everyone was stunned by these words, but it only took a moment for ridicule to curl up on the corners of their mouths. A Semi-Deity can kill Rebirth Realm experts?

Absurd!

However, the face of the old man at the Rebirth Realm had gradually become solemn. He gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “I know who you are.”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “You know who I am?”

The old man nodded, “Everyone in the human race knows you.”

He naturally knew who Yang Ye was. Because news of what happened on the Heavenpath had spread through the large world, everyone knew that another sword cultivator had killed his way up into the large world.

This time, the sword cultivator hadn’t just fought his way into the large world, he’d killed his way up, and he’d killed five Rebirth Realm experts!

The death of five Rebirth Realm experts from the War Pavilion and Emperor Sect caused quite the commotion in the large world. However, many people didn’t really believe that Yang Ye had killed them. After all, Yang Ye was just a Semi-Deity. But they had no doubt that Yang Ye was extremely strong. Because even five Rebirth Realm experts hadn’t been able to kill him. Just that made him renowned through the human race.

After all, he was just a Semi-Deity!

Yang Ye glanced at the old man and said, “I have other business to attend to. Farewell!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around and left.

He hadn’t expected that the old man would recognize him. Since the old man knew who he was, he had to leave as soon as possible. He wasn’t afraid of the old man, and he just didn’t want to get into more trouble.

“Young Brother, please wait a moment!” The old man suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye and smiled, “Young Brother, you’re new here and don’t know much about this world. So, why don’t you rest in my Qin Clan for some time? Moreover, you saved my grandson and granddaughter, so you must allow my Qin Clan to extend its hospitality to you. Otherwise, if news were to spread, others may say my Qin Clan is ungrateful.”

All the members of the Qin Clan gazed at the old man while bewilderment filled their eyes.

Polite!

They couldn’t figure out why their ancestor was being so polite to a Semi-Deity!

Yang Ye thought for a while and was about to refuse, but the old man added, “Young Brother, even though my Qin Clan’s strength is inferior to the Emperor Sect and War Pavilion, it is still strong. Since you’re new here, you definitely need help in many aspects. If you don’t mind that my Qin Clan is just a small clan, then we’re willing to provide help to you!”

After he realized who Yang Ye was, the old man knew that it was definitely a huge opportunity for his Qin Clan. Even though Yang Ye was just a Semi-Deity, his potential was huge. After all, Yang Ye was similar to Jian Wuji and the Unfettered One from all those years ago. All those years ago, once the Unfettered One and Jian Wuji’s strength had matured, no power dared to offend them!

The powers mentioned here didn’t just extend to the human race, it extended to all the races in the large world.

Besides that, Yang Ye’s potential wasn’t inferior to the Unfettered One and Jian Wuji at all. Just think about it, once Yang Ye’s strength matured, would anyone in the large world be able to fight him? But if they didn’t seize the moment while Yang Ye was comparatively weaker to form a good relationship with Yang Ye, then they wouldn’t have a chance once Yang Ye was strong. Moreover, even if they couldn’t form a good relationship with Yang Ye, just doing him a favor was good too.

Yang Ye glanced at the old man and said, “You wouldn’t expose my presence and make people besiege me, right?”

The old man laughed bitterly, “Young Brother, do I look like an idiot?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Then thank you for the hospitality.” Just as the old man had said, he didn’t know much about the large world. If he didn’t have help, then only god knows how long it would take him to get to the Demon Territory. Moreover, he needed to get a good understanding of the Divine Phoenix Clan, War Pavilion, and Emperor Sect’s strength. Since he was irreconcilable enemies with them, how would he fight them if he didn’t even know how strong they were?

The old man’s smile became brilliant when he heard Yang Ye agree. No matter what, Yang Ye had accepted the favor.

Just like that, Yang Ye went to the Qin Clan with the old man.

During their conversation, Yang Ye found out that the old man’s name was Qin Shan, and he was an ancestor of the Qin Clan. As for the black robed old man who fought Yang Ye, that was Qin Feng, the Qin Clan’s current patriarch.

In the Qin Clan’s grand hall.

Qin Shan gazed at Qin Xue and Qin Yuan who remained by Yang Ye’s side and said, “Young Brother, it was all thanks to you or my grandchildren would probably be dead. The Blood Sword Demon! He even dared to kill a member of my Qin Clan!” As he finished speaking, Qin Shan’s face had instantly turned icy cold.

“The Blood Sword Demon?” Yang Ye gazed at Qin Shan, “He’s a sword cultivator too?”

‘Kind of!” Qin Shan continued, “However, he hasn’t comprehended sword intent, but he has comprehended slaughter intent. Moreover, it isn’t low, it’s at the Quasi Returnal Rank. Even though he hasn’t comprehended sword intent, his sword is still extremely sharp when enhanced by slaughter intent. Coupled with the unique cultivation technique he possesses; even ordinary Rebirth Realm experts would find it difficult to kill him!”

“Even Rebirth Realm experts can’t kill him!” Yang Ye nodded, “That’s quite amazing!”

Qin Shan nodded, “Even though he’s just a Deity, he has made a name for himself amongst the younger generation. However, he’s ruthless and stops at nothing. He likes to kill anyone he sees, and he frequently slaughters cities that don’t have any experts. However, he’s smart too. He never offends powers that he can’t afford to offend. Coupled with his extraordinary strength, he has been able to survive until now. I just don’t understand why he slaughtered a city that belongs to the War Pavilion.”

Yang Ye said, “Let’s not pay further attention to him. Right, I need your help with two things.”

Qin Shan replied, “Go ahead!”

Yang Ye nodded, and he didn’t hold back, “Firstly, please get me information about the War Pavilion, Emperor Sect, and Divine Phoenix Clan. Secondly, how can I get to the Divine Phoenix Clan as soon as possible?”

Qin Shan spoke solemnly, “In the large world, the various sects and clans here are divided into ranks. For example, a clan like mine which has three Rebirth Realm experts can be considered as a five star power. As for powers like the Emperor Sect and War Pavilion, they possess at least ten Rebirth Realm experts, and they are considered as six star powers. But the Divine Phoenix Clan…”

He paused for a moment and continued, “A power like that is an eight star power!”

Eight stars! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. What did that represent? It represented that the Divine Phoenix Clan had numerous Rebirth Realm experts!

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time before he said, “How can I get to the Divine Phoenix Clan as soon as possible?”

Not to mention an eight star power, he would still go even if it was a ten star power!

Qin Shan replied, “Teleportation formations. Because the demon race prohibited the human race from constructing teleportation formations within their territory, you must use the Shi Clan’s stellar teleportation formation to be teleported to the border of the Demon Territory and Human Territory, Oblivion Boundary. Once you arrive at that mountain range, you just have to pass through it to arrive at the territory of the demon race. However, if you don’t have an invitation from the demon race and enter arbitrarily, then it’s equivalent to provoking the demon race. It’s very dangerous!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand!”

Qin Shan asked, “Young Brother, you intend to travel to the Divine Phoenix Clan?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Qin Shan said, “If you want to travel to Oblivion Boundary, you must head to the Shi Clan’s Formation City. Our Qin Clan has a teleportation formation that leads directly to Formation City! You can head over at any time.”

Yang Ye stood up, “I’ll go right now!”

Qin Shan was surprised, “Are you in such a rush?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I don’t want to waste time!”

Qin Shan thought for a moment and said, “I’ll send you to the teleportation formation.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Thank you.” As soon as he finished speaking, he gazed at Qin Xue and Qin Yuan, and then he rubbed their heads.

He was about to speak when Qin Xue suddenly said, “Big Brother, can I learn how to use the sword?”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he asked, “Why do you want to learn that?”

She blinked, “Because I’ll be able to protect my younger brother!”

He gazed at her for a long time, and then he gazed at Qin Yuan, “Little Fellow, you’re a man, so you can’t let your older sister protect you forever. Understand?” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Qin Yuan seemed to understand but not completely, and he nodded and said, “I want to learn too. I want to protect… protect big sister!”

Meanwhile, Qin Shan suddenly said, “Their parents passed away because of an incident many years ago. So, they are extremely close.”

So that’s what happened! Yang Ye gazed at them, and then he flicked a strand of sword intent into each of their heads. He said, “Learning how to use the sword depends on your own talent. That’s my sword intent. If you really do learn how to wield the sword, then that sword intent will be quite helpful to you in the future.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he gazed at Qin Shan, “Let’s go!”

Qin Shan glanced at Qin Yuan and Qin Xue, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “Thank you.!

If Qin Xue and Qin Yuan took the path of sword cultivation, then that sword intent was a truly priceless treasure. With that sword intent as a point of reference, they would be able to avoid many wrong paths on the path of sword cultivation!

Yang Ye smiled, “It was nothing!”

Qin Shan nodded, and then he waved his right hand and vanished with Yang Ye.

On a teleportation platform, Yang Ye cupped his fist to Qin Shan, “Farewell!” As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and entered the teleportation formation. It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to vanish on it.

The Qin Clan’s patriarch, Qin Feng, spoke solemnly, “Ancestor, who is he? You actually treated him so courteously!”

Qin Shan shook his head slightly, “Someone our Qin Clan can’t afford to offend.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot. He naturally couldn’t reveal Yang Ye’s identity. Because if he did, then Yang Ye would definitely face a huge amount of trouble, and if it was the Qin Clan that exposed Yang Ye’s whereabouts, the trouble it faced may be a little severe. So, he didn’t tell Qin Feng the answer.

Qin Feng slowly clenched his fists, but it didn’t take long for him to gradually relax. A short while passed before he shook his head and vanished on the spot.

He naturally resented that Yang Ye had almost killed him, and he’d thought about taking revenge. But he’d given up in the end.

Because Qin Shan said that Yang Ye was someone their clan couldn’t afford to offend!

Two hours later, Yang Ye arrived at Formation City. Right when he walked out of the teleportation formation, a voice suddenly resounded, “Yang Ye! I’ve been waiting for you!”
