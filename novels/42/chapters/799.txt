Chapter 800 – To The Outer Heavens!

Translator: InVader

Editor: Conspiracing

Five rays of light descended from above, and every single one of them carried a person. There were 3 men and 2 women.

All of them were at the Saint Realm! However, their bodies were ethereal. Obviously, it wasn’t their main bodies!

Everyone here was petrified upon witnessing this scene, and the defiant profounders seemed as if they were facing a powerful enemy!

Yang Ye’s gaze shot over towards one of the women. He recognized her. She was the founding ancestor of the Flower Palace, Mu Hanshan! The latter’s gaze had descended onto him as well, but her eyes carried ghastly killing intent.

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze, and there was bewilderment in his eyes. Because since they’d descended to this world, he wondered why no Quintessence Violet Energy had appeared in this world! It wasn’t just Yang Ye, Supreme Exalt He and the others were puzzled as well.

Meanwhile, one of the old men suddenly stepped forward, and he withdrew a huge pile of talismans before flicking with his finger. The talismans transformed into rays of light that flew up into the sky.

“Evaluation Talismans!” Shen Mo spoke abruptly.

Yang Ye asked, “What are they?”

Shen Mo replied, “A type of talisman that can evaluate natural talent. It’s very mysterious. I understand why they’re here. Haha, so it was because of that!”

Yang Ye was puzzled.

Meanwhile, a pillar of light suddenly enveloped Ding Shaoyao who stood by his side. Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically, and he was about to act when Shen Mo spoke, “Don’t worry, it’s fortune for her.”

Yang Ye was still puzzled, but he didn’t act. Because Ding Shaoyao didn’t seem to have been harmed, and she was merely floating slowly up into the sky.

In next to no time, numerous rays of light flew over from all directions, and every single one of them carried a person. It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to see some familiar faces....

Nether Maiden, An Nanjing, Xiao Yuxi, Mu Qingfeng, Unseeing who was ranked at the 2nd on the Hallowed Rankings, Lu Wan’er, Fu Jinxian....

In next to no time, over 100 people appeared in the sky. There were both men and women amongst them, and they only had a single similarity. It was that they were all peerless geniuses of the younger generation.

The gazes of those 5 Saint Realm experts swept through all these geniuses. In the end, most of their gazes descended upon An Nanjing and Nether Maiden.

“What’s going on?” Nether Maiden frowned.

The old man revealed a slight smile and said, “This world is about to be destroyed. Are you willing to head to the Outer Heavens with us?”

She asked, “Why?”

The old man seemed to be very patient and immediately smiled before he explained, “Presently, the thing this stellar region lacks the most isn’t resources but geniuses. We paid a huge price to send our Core Spirits down to this world so that we can save the geniuses of this world. Fortunately, this world didn’t disappoint us. Even though it has suffered from decline, it still has so many geniuses. Especially you and that little girl by yours side. Both of you really surprised me!”

The others behind Nether Maiden and An Nanjing were overjoyed when they heard the old man, and many of them even started crying tears of joy.

Because it represented that they didn’t have to die. Moreover, they would be rising in the world as well.

Nether Maiden fell silent for a short while, and then she said, “What’ll happen to this world?”

“It’ll face destruction!” The old man’s voice didn’t carry any emotion.

Mu Hanshan suddenly spoke, “Those who are willing to head to the Outer Heavens with us come stand behind us!”

In an instant, those geniuses hurriedly moved over to stand behind the 5 of them. However, there were a few who remained on the spot. They were Nether Maiden, An Nanjing, Xiao Yuxi, Lu Wan’er, and Fu Jinxian.

The old man and the others frowned when they witnessed such a scene. Because those who hadn’t moved could be said to be the best amongst these geniuses. Especially An Nanjing, Nether Maiden, and Lu Wan’er.

“Do all of you realize that this is your last chance to live!?” said the old man.

“I give up the opportunity!” An Nanjing was the one who spoke those words, and she flashed over to Yang Ye’s side once she finished speaking.

Xiao Yuxi didn’t even speak a word and just flew over to Yang Ye.

The brows of the old man and the others knit together tightly.

Fu Jinxian came over to Yang Ye’s side, and she gazed at Yang Ye as she said, “Thank you for helping me in the past. I’ll remember your kindness!” As soon as she finished speaking, she appeared behind the old man and the others.

Lu Wan’er bowed like a disciple to a master before Yang Ye, and then she said, “You won’t be angry if I go over, right?”

Yang Ye smiled as he shook his head, “Why would I? This is a fortuitous encounter for you. You shouldn’t and can’t give up on it.”

When he spoke up to this point, he gazed at Xiao Yuxi and An Nanjing, “It’s the same for the both of you. Don’t be silly. This really is the only chance all of you’ll have to survive. Don’t say anything because I know what both of you want to say. However, you really don’t have to accompany me through life and death to prove your feelings. Go over, alright?”

They didn’t speak and just gazed at him.

Yang Ye walked over to them and openly grabbed their hands, and he said, “I know that both of you want to accompany me and help me. However, I really don’t need it. Because your strengths are insufficient to be of any help at all in this current situation.”

He hugged them and said, “Sorry!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye squeezed their nape’s lightly. A strand of sword intent entered them, and then Xiao Yuxi immediately lost consciousness. As for An Nanjing, her eyes opened wide, and they carried a trace of anger, but she couldn’t move at all.

Yang Ye’s hand slowly moved up to An Nanjing’s cheek as he gazed at her, “I forgot to tell you that my sword intent is at the 3rd level of the Heaven Rank. I know that both of you will definitely not leave if I don’t do this. Don’t be angry. I’ll definitely let you hit me and vent when we meet again. Trust me, we’ll definitely meet again!”

As he spoke, he lowered his head and pecked An Nanjing’s lips lightly, and then he held them in his arms as he went over to Ding Shaoyao. Yang Ye was just about to say something when the latter said, “You don’t have to knock me out. However, you have to promise me that we’ll meet again!”

“We will!” Yang Ye nodded, and then he led the 3 of them to Nether Maiden, “Help me take care of them. I’ll owe you a favor for it!”

“Will you be able to return it?”

“Definitely!”

Nether Maiden gazed at him for a short while, and then she took An Nanjing and Xiao Yuxi, “I guarantee their safety while I’m alive!”

Yang Ye nodded. He was just about to leave when Nether Maiden suddenly pointed at him while she looked at the old man, “Why aren’t all of you choosing him?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

All the others looked at the old man as well. Perhaps these experts from the Outer Heavens were unaware of how terrifying Yang Ye’s natural talent was, but the experts of the Hallowed Grounds and Profounder Continent knew. In this world, besides Nether Maiden and An Nanjing, Yang Ye was the 3rd person with the best natural talent in this world. Since both Nether Maiden and An Nanjing had been chosen, it made them wonder why Yang Ye wasn’t!

Yang Ye gazed at the old man as well. As far as he was concerned, he should have been selected! After all, even those who were inferior to him had been selected, but he wasn’t? Of course, he wouldn’t leave with them even if he was chosen. After all, what would Elder Mu, Lu Yan, Su Qingshi, and the others do if he left?

The old man looked at Yang Ye, sized Yang Ye up, and then said, “A pretty good natural talent that isn’t inferior to these 2 little girls. Why didn’t the Evaluation Talisman choose you?” The final question he asked seemed like one he was asking himself.

The old man pondered deeply for a short while, and then he withdrew another Evaluation Talisman. After that, he flicked it onto Yang Ye. The talisman suddenly emanated a ray of light, but it didn’t take long for the light to vanish.

The old man and the others frowned. Even Mu Hanshan’s beautiful brows had knit together while a trace of bewilderment could be seen in her eyes.

The old man took out 2 more talismans and slapped them on Yang Ye, but they still vanished like the talismans from before.

The old man and the others were even more bewildered, but Yang Ye had come to an understanding. Because those talismans had emanated a thread of strange energy when it was slapped on him. Obviously, that energy was evaluating his natural talent and potential. However, it had only just appeared when it was absorbed into the Primordial Pagoda, and then it vanished without a trace.

“There’s definitely something strange about him!” Meanwhile, Mu Hanshan spoke abruptly, “It doesn't matter. Your natural talent is pretty good. You’re qualified to come with us to the Outer Heavens.”

“I refuse!” Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to refuse. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to leave, but he couldn’t. There were many people he cared about in this world like Elder Mu, Lu Yan, Lei Lin, Yin’yin, Su Qingshi....

All of them were still here on the continent. What would they do if he left?

“You refused me!?” A cold glow suddenly flashed through her eyes, and her voice was beyond icy cold, causing even the temperature here to drop greatly.

“I have things that I need to do!” Yang Ye wasn’t afraid at all and looked her straight in the eyes.

Mu Hanshan said, “The spirit energy within this world is on the verge of drying up. Moreover, all of you’ve committed such slaughter with the defiant profounders, and even the Heaven Dao of this world has been killed. Do you know that it isn’t we who want to destroy all of you and the defiant profounders now? It’s the Laws of the Heaven Dao from the Outer Heavens that intends to annihilate all of you! All of you actually slaughtered billions! Did you think the wrath of the heavens is a joke?”

“Did we have a choice? We were forced to do this by all of you!” Supreme Exalt He roared furiously, “All of you trapped us here for 100,000 years just to kill the defiant profounders. 100,000 years! How many people could have attained the Saint Realm, but they stopped at the Half-Saint Realm and perished because of all of you. Now, the defiant profounders have left the seal and a calamity is upon us. What else could we have done? We only want to survive!”

“If it wasn’t for us, your world would have been destroyed by the defiant profounders all those years ago!” The old man suddenly spoke, “Yet all of you are blaming us now? How laughable!”

“Why waste your breath on them? The Heaven Dao will deal with them!” A middle aged man who stood by the old man’s side said, “Let’s go. The important matter at hand is to discuss how to split these geniuses amongst us!”

Mu Hanshan gazed at Yang Ye and said, “This is your last chance!”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Who’s right and wrong isn’t important to me. What’s important to me is people whom I want to protect are still in this world. There are things that can be abandoned, but there are some things that can’t be abandoned even in the face of death!”

“You chose this!” Mu Hanshan took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, and then she transformed into a ray of light that shot into the sky and vanished.

It didn’t long for the old man and the others to do the same.

“Yang Ye! Remember that you owe me a favor....” Nether Maiden’s voice resounded from high above.

After the old man’s group left, a lightning vortex appeared above the blood red veil in the sky.

A bolt of lightning flashed down from it and struck the group of defiant profounders, causing a shrill cry to resound as one of them was immediately transformed into ashes!

After that, countless bolts of lightning blotted out the sky as they descended!
