Chapter 1587 - The Nether Judge!

Translator: InVader

A woman was standing not too far away from Yang Ye. She wore a white dress with a flower design, and she seemed to be around the age of 16 or 17. Of course, that wasn’t the main point. The main point was that she felt quite familiar to him.

She felt familiar!

Extremely familiar!

Yang Ye stared at her. The more he gazed at her, the more familiar she felt. Suddenly, his eyes opened wide, “Are you… are you Yin’yin?”

He finally realized why she seemed familiar. It was because her appearance was extremely similar to Yin’yin! He hadn’t forgotten that little girl, Yin’yin, of course.

After all, she ate people all those years ago!

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye when they heard him, even Nether Maiden and the others gazed at him.

The pig riding young woman asked, “You know our eldest sister?”

Yang Ye gazed at Sky Maiden, “Are… are you Yin’yin?”

Based on her outward appearance and the timeline, it was extremely likely for her to be Yin’yin. However, he didn’t dare to confirm his suspicions because she gazed at him with an extremely calm gaze.

Sky Maiden glanced at Yang Ye and withdrew her gaze, and then she gazed at Fan Yinyu, “Envoy Fan, let’s put an end to the enmity between you and us sisters.”

Fan Yinyu grinned, “I was wondering why I couldn’t find you. If I’m not wrong, you weren’t in this universe, right?”

Sky Maiden nodded, “Indeed. However, all of that isn’t important anymore.” She glanced at Fan Yinyu and the others, “Come, let me see how strong you are now.”

Fan Yinyu nodded slightly, “I’d like to witness your strength too.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she glanced at the surroundings and said, “Let’s go somewhere else.” She immediately vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

Sky Maiden glanced at Blood Maiden and the others, “I know you have many questions. I’ll tell you everything once it’s over.” She vanished on the spot.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye asked the pig riding young woman who was standing by his side, “Did your eldest sister always look like that?”

The pig riding young woman shook her head, “Of course not. She reincarnated herself to save us. So, her appearance is different now.” She paused for a moment and continued, “You’ve met Eldest Sister in the past?”

Yang Ye nodded, “But I’m not very sure if it’s her. I’m sure you noticed that she ignored me earlier.” Just as he’d said, he wasn’t sure if Sky Maiden was Yin’yin. If she was the Yin’yin he knew, then he had no doubt that she would greet him.

The pig riding young woman fell silent for a short while and said, “I don’t know either. Let’s forget about that for now. We’ll know once we ask her later.” She gazed at the man with a spear and the others, “Your profound energy has special effects, so help heal Second Sister first, alright?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Of course!”

The pig riding young woman nodded slightly. A moment later, Blind Maiden and the others charged at the spear-wielding man’s group.

In an instant, the battlefield was split into segments, and the battle began!

Yang Ye didn’t pay any attention to the battle because Blood Maiden had clearly suffered very severe injuries. He immediately went over to her and said, “Second Sister, come with me!” As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of light that vanished towards the distance.

After he took Blood Maiden a certain distance away from the spatial battlefield and confirmed that there was no one here, Yang Ye took her into the Primordial Pagoda.

Blood Maiden had suffered very severe injuries. If he healed her in the outside world, it would waste a huge amount of time. The only way to heal her as soon as possible was to do so in the Primordial Pagoda.

As for having his secret leaked… If Blood Maiden betrayed him, then he would have no choice but to accept her betrayal!

In the Primordial Pagoda, Blood Maiden glanced at the surroundings and there was a trace of curiosity in her eyes, “What’s this place?”

Yang Ye smiled, “My biggest secret.”

As he spoke, he made her lay down, and then he placed his right palm on her stomach. After that, his Primordial Violet Energy surged madly into her.

Blood Maiden sized up the cultivation room, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “This place is a world of its own, and it’s within your body. If I’m not wrong, this is a treasure, right?”

Yang Ye nodded.

“No wonder…” She glanced at the surroundings and added, “The passage of time here is different from the outside world?”

Yang Ye nodded again.

Blood Maiden fell silent for a long time, and then she said, “No matter what, thank you for trusting me!” Yang Ye had brought her in here, so it was definitely a sign that Yang Ye trusted her.

Yang Ye smiled and remained silent as he continued healing her.

Blood Maiden’s injuries weren’t just the arms that she’d lost, her internal organs were injured as well. Besides that, there was a faint strand of energy all around her, and it was ceaselessly corroding her body.

“It’s her energy!” Blood Maiden suddenly said, “It’s very strange. Even my Blood Domain can’t suppress it.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he poured some Primordial Violet Energy towards it. In the beginning, the Primordial Violet Energy was instantly pushed away, but it gradually corroded the energy. The mysterious energy grew weaker and weaker as Yang Ye’s Primordial Violet Energy corroded it incessantly, and it took less than 15 minutes for it to vanish completely.

Once the energy vanished, Yang Ye started healing her other injuries. Blood Maiden’s injuries healed at a shocking pace with the help of Yang Ye’s Primordial Violet Energy, and it took no more than four hours for her arms to be grown back. At the same time, her body which had been corroded by Fan Yinyu’s energy was almost completely healed. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Blood Maiden suddenly said, “Your profound energy is really amazing!”

“It is!” Yang Ye nodded as he deeply agreed. It could be said that if it wasn’t for the Primordial Violet Energy he possessed, he would have died on countless occasions. Every single time he fought someone, the reason he dared to fight without any regard for his life was because he possessed Primordial Violet Energy! It was where he got his confidence from!

It didn’t take long for Blood Maiden to recover completely, and then Yang Ye brought her out of the Primordial Pagoda.

In the world outside, the battles here were at their peak. However, Blind Maiden was at a disadvantage without the golden dragon’s help.

Blood Maiden didn’t waste her breath at all. Her figure immediately charged towards the spear-wielding man, and the situation was instantly turned around.

This time, their numbers and strength had both surpassed the spear-wielding man’s group. However, Yang Ye noticed that it was extremely difficult to end the battle and decide a victor!

Because both sides were very strong. So, if they really wanted to decide on a victor, they would have to decide on life and death too. But if they wanted to do that, it wouldn’t be something that could be accomplished in a short amount of time.

Yang Ye looked up at the sky. Obviously, the battle over there was the key to everything.

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then he turned to look at the spear-wielding man’s group. After that, he charged towards them.

His plan was to deal with them and gang up on Fan Yinyu!

Once Yang Ye joined the battle, the situation that the spear-wielding man’s group was in immediately worsened.

However, the spear-wielding man suddenly withdrew a transmission talisman and crushed it. It only took a while for Yang Ye and the others’ expressions to change. Because over a dozen auras were charging over from below.

They have more help? Yang Ye shot downwards. It didn’t take long for him to stop. At this moment, there were over a dozen black robed figures standing not too far before him.

All of them were Rebirth Realm experts!

Yang Ye glanced at them, and it didn’t take long for his eyes to narrow slightly. Because he noticed that besides humans, there were demons amongst them as well. Besides that, he sensed members of the devil race too.

Have the devil race, demon race, and even the oceanic race and barbaric race joined in as well? Such a thought appeared in Yang Ye’s mind. But it didn’t take long for him to reject it. If those four races were participating as well, then there would definitely be more experts here.

If all their forces came, it was absolutely possible for them to gather a few hundred Rebirth Realm experts.

“Kill!” Suddenly, a ghastly voice resounded from amongst their group, and then the black robed figures charged at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. If he couldn’t use the Stellar Sword Diagram and the Divine Yin Flame, he was no match for over a dozen Rebirth Realm experts.

Fortunately, he had help now!

Yang Ye immediately summoned the golden dragon. As soon as it appeared before Yang Ye, it slammed its body at the black robed figures.

At this moment, the huge golden dragon’s strength was vividly displayed, and those black robed figures were completely suppressed in battle due to the golden dragon’s physical defense.

Yang Ye didn’t stand by idly, of course. He stood on the golden dragon and frequently launched lethal strikes at them.

So, the black robed figures were utterly suppressed by the joint forces of Yang Ye and the huge golden dragon.

Bang!

Suddenly, a terrifying wave of pressure rained down from high above, and then the spatial battlefield shattered into bits and transformed into a black hole. Over a dozen breaths of time passed before space gradually repaired itself.

Meanwhile, Sky Maiden and Fan Yinyu had appeared above them.

The two women were facing each other.

A moment later, both of them raised their hands and were about to attack. However, a voice suddenly came from far away in outer space, “Stop!”

A moment later, a middle aged man in a violet robe appeared above them, and he was holding a black brush that was almost the length of an arm.

The expressions of all the women from the Nether Pavilion changed when they saw that brush. Even Fan Yinyu’s expression had changed.

The middle aged man scanned the surroundings and spoke coldly, “Nether Envoy and the ten Nether Hall, hear me. The Pavilion Master entrusted me with ordering all of you to return immediately.”

Yang Ye went over to the pig riding young woman and asked, “Who is he?”

The pig riding young woman had quite an unsightly expression on her face, and she remained silent for a long time before she answered him, “The Nether Judge!”
