Chapter 2526 – You’re About to be Unmatched!

Haughty!

Arrogant!

That was how Yang Ye was acting right now!

It was what he wanted. If he still kept a low profile now, why would the Ancient Sword Sect believe in him? Why would they let him become the Junior Sect Master?

He kept a low profile when it was necessary, but he knew when to make a show of strength too!

The hall fell silent when they heard Yang Ye.

A long time passed before Elder Xue said, “Come with me!”

She turned around and left.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and followed her.

Yang Ye followed her to an empty hall, and there were numerous memorial tablets there!

They were the past experts of the Ancient Sword Sect.

Elder Xue bowed slightly to them and said, “The competition in Eternal Kingdom is very great, and my Ancient Sword Sect was only able to survive until now because of the hard work and sacrifice of a senior.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “You’re heard of the desolate race, right?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Elder Xue continued, “The desolate race’s reappearance represents that they will be back. This time, we don’t know if the Ancient Sword Sect will be able to survive!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Is the desolate race very strong?”

Elder Xue smiled, “Much stronger than you think! Especially the Desolate Emperor, he can be considered as one of the strongest in this world!” She closed her eyes slowly at this point.

Yang Ye fell silent too.

A long time passed before she gazed at him, “All the other powers are seeking a way out for themselves, and my Ancient Sword Sect is no exception. We’ve been waiting for a person, someone who can lead the next generation forward.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

Elder Xue smiled, “I mean that a war is coming, and all of us in the older generation may die. But the sect’s inheritance cannot be lost. The older generation may vanish, but the younger generation must survive. Let me make it simpler. If we lose, we need the younger generation to continue passing down the inheritance of the sect; and if we win, we still need the younger generation to take over the sect!”

Yang Ye gained a rough understanding at this point.

A spark!

The Ancient Sword Sect and all the other powers were trying to preserve a spark that could reignite their powers. In that way, even if they lost in battle, their respective powers wouldn’t vanish from the world.

Or to make it even simpler, they were setting up a backup plan.

A backup plan!

Meanwhile, Elder Xue gazed at Yang Ye, “Regardless of whether we win or lose, we need a powerful youth to lead the younger generation of the sect. As for why we’ve left the spot of Junior Sect Master empty until now, it’s because we’ve been waiting for a person capable of that. Do you understand what I mean?”

Yang Ye nodded slightly. He naturally understood her. Taking the position of Junior Sect Master represented shouldering responsibility, huge responsibility!

Elder Xue walked over to Yang Ye, “You’re very suitable. You’re one of the most monstrous geniuses I’ve seen in the younger generation. While Gu Nie is extremely monstrous too, he isn’t interested in the position of Junior Sect Master, and he’s quite honest and only practices in the sword. He doesn’t really know how the world works, nor is he suited to be a leader. But you’re different, you know how to navigate the world, and you’re very thick skinned. Of course, you often go to extremes, making it easy for you to get into trouble. But you’re young, so it’s understandable!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened. Are you trying to praise me?

Elder Xue looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Can you do that?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

If he agreed, it would be equivalent to taking up that responsibility!

It wasn’t an easy job at all.

Meanwhile, Elder Xue added, “The benefit is accepting this position represents you’ll only be beneath the sect master, and even I will have to obey your orders at most times. Moreover, all the resources of the sect will be yours.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time and said, “Let me give it some thought!”

He turned around and walked out of the hall.

Elder Xue smiled when Yang Ye walked out of the hall.

Meanwhile, the Grand Elder appeared before her.

The Grand Elder asked, “Were you testing him?”

She shook her head, “He can shoulder that responsibility! However, I’m very happy. I’m happy he didn’t agree immediately. If he did that, it represents he doesn’t really care about the sect, and he has no sense of responsibility. But he refused. That represents that he’s hesitating. It’s because he knows very well that once he agrees, he’ll have to shoulder this responsibility. He is hesitating and giving it consideration, and that tells us that his promises are very important to him!”

The Grand Elder nodded slightly, “Indeed.”

Elder Xue walked out of the hall and looked up into the distant sky, “The Desolate Emperor will be attacking soon. This time, either one of us will die, or perhaps both sides will be destroyed.”

The Grand Elder hesitated to speak, “Gu Nie…”

Elder Xue spoke softly, “He grew up in the sect from a young age, so he’s the most suited to be the Junior Sect Master. But he’s a cold person who's without any friends in the sect. In the hearts of our disciples, he stands far above them, and he feels too distant to them. He isn’t suited to be a leader. But Ye Yang is different, he knows how to navigate the world. While he does go to extremes at times, he knows what to do at most times. So, he’s more suitable!”

The Grand Elder nodded slightly, “It would be better if his heart was with the sect!”

Elder Xue looked up at the distant sky while a strand of worry arose on her brows.

Eternal Kingdom was in peace right now, but everyone knew that this peace would vanish very soon.

It would be replaced with destruction!

The arrival of the desolate race would bring destruction to Eternal Kingdom!

The people of Eternal Kingdom were prepared for war, but they were also preparing backup plans.

Every power was trying to preserve a spark!

Their sects could be destroyed, but their inheritances must live on!

…

Yang Ye walked over to a flight of stone stairs and sat there.

Meanwhile, Sword Scroll’s voice resounded in his mind, “Don’t force yourself. I’m serious, you’ve done your best.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly.

Sword Scroll spoke softly, “You humans speak about fate, and so do we. Perhaps, this is my fate. Moreover, while I don’t have my main body, my spirit is still alive. So, even if I don’t have my old body, it isn’t impossible to cultivate again and form a new body!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Don’t try to deceive me!”

Cultivate and form a new body?

Take humans for example. They could form a new body once it was destroyed, but it wasn’t their original body anyone. That was why many didn’t rashly seize the bodies of others. Because it wasn’t their true body.

Moreover, how difficult would it be for her to form a new body? How could the body of a Super Divine Treasure possibly be cultivated and formed with ease?

Yang Ye naturally understood what she was telling him. She didn’t want him to force himself and stay in the Ancient Sword Sect. After all, he hated being bound, and he would definitely be bound if he stayed.

A short while passed before Yang Ye suddenly stood up and glanced at the surroundings, and then he smiled, “Elder Xue, I agree!”

As soon as he said that, Elder Xue appeared before him.

She looked him in the eyes, “Are you sure?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Yes!”

She nodded slightly, “Come with me!”

She turned around and left.

Yang Ye immediately followed her, and they arrived at the Sword Cave.

In the Sword Cave, Elder Xue brought Yang Ye to those fragments which were Sword Scroll’s main body.

Meanwhile, Gu Nan appeared before them.

Elder Xue gazed at the pillar of light, “Thanks, Brother Gu Nan!”

Gu Nan glanced at Yang Ye and didn’t say anything. He just tapped it, and the pillar of light shattered before countless fragments floated over to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye touched them gently, and then he waved his hand and sent them into the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye gazed at Elder Xue, “Thank you!”

Elder Xue nodded slightly and said, “Come with me!”

This time, she brought him to a hall.

There was a single statue within it, the statue of a middle aged man.

“Gu Jian!” Meanwhile, Sword Scroll’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “A sword cultivator from the ancient times, and the founding ancestor of the sect. He built the sect and named it.”

Gu Jian!

Yang Ye gazed at Gu Jian. It was just a statue without a soul hidden within it!

Elder Xue bowed slightly to it, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “Ye Yang, from now onward, you’re my Ancient Sword Sect’s Junior Sect Master.”

She flicked an ancient spatial ring over to Yang Ye as she spoke. Besides that, she gave him a scroll.

Yang Ye put the spatial ring away. It was very ordinary, and it was just a symbol of status.

Now, any disciple who saw him would have to address him respectfully as senior brother.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

As for whether they would accept it, Elder Xue and the others didn’t care. As far as they were concerned, if Yang Ye couldn’t make them accept him, then it was his own lack of ability.

As for the older generation, Yang Ye had passed their test!

Yang Ye wore the ring, and then he gazed at the scroll, “What is this?”

She replied indifferently, “Flash!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Flash?”

She explained, “One of the sect’s strongest secret techniques, one that improves a sword’s speed. Only two people can learn it, the sect master and junior sect master.”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Sword Scroll’s voice suddenly resounded in his mind, “You’re about to be unmatched!”
