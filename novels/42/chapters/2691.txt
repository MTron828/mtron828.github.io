Chapter 2692 – Five Element Sword!

A long time later, the area returned to calm.

Only one person remained here.

It was Tu.

She laid there on Heaven Executor with one leg crossed over the other and her hands behind her head while holding the wine gourd in her mouth.

She’d fallen asleep.

But she was muttering incessantly.

If one listened carefully, it was—“The Emotionless Sword Dao… An unfettered heart without any other desires, and so the sword is completely devoid of other desires… The body as a sword, the mind as the mind of the sword. You have no emotions, and so does your sword; you have no desires, and so does your sword.”

She suddenly sat up at this point and patted her own face, “I just lost by a single move! It’s not a big deal! I lost to our strongest form too! Sigh, she said my Sword Dao has flaws… Ugh, I need to beat someone up.”

She vanished on the spot on her sword.

Meanwhile, a sword cultivator walked slowly toward the distance.

Some time later, the sword cultivator suddenly stopped and looked toward a distant place, and he grinned, “Little fellow, there isn’t much time left until the deadline.”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly stopped as he flew on his sword, and then he glanced to the side.

A long time later, he nodded and vanished into the distance.

Martial Sky World.

Yang Ye finally arrived here. Just like the Past Life World, the Martial Sky World was actually a world that had fallen into decline.

The Martial Sky Clan!

Yang Ye didn’t know much about the clan. No, he didn’t know anything about them. So, he was absolutely vigilant upon arriving here.

This time, his cultivation wasn’t sealed.

On a boundless ocean, Yang Ye shot forward on his sword, and the ocean water beneath him was faint yellow.

The entire Martial Sky World’s spirit energy was practically nonexistent. It was worse than the World of Past Life.

Yang Ye summoned Snowy. This place wasn’t small, so he wouldn’t even find anything if he searched this place. He had to get Snowy’s help when it came to searching for treasures!

Once she appeared before him, Snowy glanced at the surroundings, and then she blinked and pointed toward the right.

Yang Ye was quite curious, “Little fellow, you don’t even have to sniff anymore?”

She cracked a smile, grabbed Yang Ye’s neck, and rubbed her head against him.

Yang Ye chuckled and vanished with Snowy.

Yang Ye proceeded forward under Snowy’s guidance. He saw many ruins of cities all along the way, and it was obvious that these ruins had been created by the sword!

Obviously, it was the woman in black’s doing!

Yang Ye sped up without thinking too much about it.

A short while later, Snowy asked Yang Ye to stop.

Yang Ye descended to a huge tower. It was like a huge city. Even if a portion of its top had been sliced off, it was still extremely grand and magnificent, and quite imposing too!

There were countless pitch black pythons that were thick like pillars coiled around it. Moreover, they were actually still alive!

While Yang Ye didn’t fear them, they did seem quite terrifying.

Snowy gazed at the wriggling pythons, and then she covered her eyes. She was quite afraid of them…

Actually, it was the pythons that should fear her.

Yang Ye rubbed her head gently and walked into the tower with her in his arms.

Huge!

Strictly speaking, it wasn’t a tower but a city. Because there were many buildings within it, and they seemed like residential buildings.

Yang Ye looked down at Snowy, and she glanced at the surroundings before pointing in the direction that Yang Ye should go toward.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “Is it dangerous?”

Actually, Snowy could sense danger, and her senses were even better than Yang Ye and Erya. Of course, she was quite oblivious in the sense that she would always overestimate Yang Ye and underestimate the danger.

Snowy blinked and shook her head.

Yang Ye pinched her cheek and spoke seriously, “Is it not dangerous at all?”

She shook her head.

Yang Ye asked, “You think I can deal with the danger?”

She nodded.

Yang Ye asked, “Do you know how strong I am?”

Snowy blinked and quickly nodded while waving her paws swiftly.

She was saying that Yang Ye was very, very, very formidable.

Yang Ye felt absolutely speechless. Obviously, the little fellow had absolutely overestimated his strength!

Yang Ye felt quite helpless toward this. He didn’t say anything and just continued forward with her!

He was the strongest in Snowy’s world. He could resolve anything, even though she usually led him into a trap, but he actually really enjoyed this feeling.

Snowy sat on his shoulder, and she was practically fearless while she was with him.

Yang Ye arrived before a huge clay statue.

The clay statue was over 10m tall, and it was in the image of a middle aged man. His fists were clenched, and he was looking forward while giving off an imposing aura!

Snowy pointed at it.

Yang Ye asked, “Inside it?”

She nodded.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “Can you make it show itself?”

Snowy blinked and gazed at the statue, and then she waved her paw lightly.

A breath of time passed!

No response!

Two breaths passed!

Still no response!

Ten breaths passed, but there was no response!

Snowy gazed at Yang Ye, and he shot her a helpless expression.

Snowy flew over to the statue and knocked it lightly. She was telling it to get out here.

However, the treasure within it didn’t give her any face and refused to show itself.

Snowy frowned, and then she opened her mouth and inhaled.

The clay statue suddenly trembled!

Yang Ye had a vigilant expression on his face. There really was treasure in there!

Meanwhile, Snowy patted the clay statue.

Crack!

It suddenly cracked open, and Snowy hurriedly returned to Yang Ye’s side. They watched as the clay statue cracked open completely, and then an ethereal man appeared before them.

While his figure was ethereal, he was holding a crimson gold sword.

It was a real sword!

The man didn’t look at Yang Ye, he looked at Snowy instead. His eyes narrowed slightly while coldness appeared within them.

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head while killing intent appeared in his eyes.

Meanwhile, the man gazed at Yang Ye, “Who are you?”

Yang Ye replied frankly, “I’m here to search for treasures!”

Treasures!

The man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time. A moment later, the crimson gold sword shot forward.

A sharp tearing sound resounded.

Yang Ye remained indifferent. Once the sword arrived around 1m away from him, Past Life left the sheath by his waist.

Bam!

The crimson gold sword was instantly blasted away!

As soon as it returned to the man’s grasp, a sword had arrived before the man, and it was just half an inch away from his forehead.

But Yang Ye frowned because the man had suddenly appeared around 30m away from him.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Past Life returned to its sheath and Yang Ye didn’t attack again.

The man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “Shall we make a deal?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Go ahead!”

The man glanced at his sword, “It’s the sword of metal in the five elements, and my Martial Sky Clan gathered the purest energy of metal and countless of the best materials in the world to forge it!”

He gazed at Yang Ye, “I’ll give it to you if you do something for me.”

Yang Ye grinned and waved his right hand. Past Life left its sheath and appeared before the man.

Yang Ye smiled, “What do you think of this sword?”

The man fell silent for a long time, and then he said, “It’s better than mine!”

He glanced at Yang Ye and continued, “I didn’t expect to see Destiny’s Past Life.”

Yang Ye nodded, “It is!”

The man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time. In the end, he said, “My Martial Sky Clan has a total of five peerless swords, and they represent all the five elements. If they are merged together, they won’t be any inferior to the sword you hold! Moreover, they come with a formation. My ancestor used that formation to fight against the Heaven Dao and Destiny.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while and asked, “What do you need from me?”

The man fell silent.

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

The man glanced at the surroundings and asked, “Can you sense the energy here? The energy of Destiny! The energy of Heaven Executor!”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and closed his eyes slowly.

Sure enough, he sensed it. However, it wasn’t exactly similar to the Heaven Executor he once had!

It was very overbearing and full of the desire to kill! Moreover, it was ceaselessly corroding the spirit energy and quintessence of the Martial Sky World.

The man gazed at Yang Ye, “Help me expel its remaining energy in this world and the swords are yours!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while before he said, “I will help you expel the sword energy and restore the spirit energy here, but in return, I don’t just want the five swords, I want the Martial Sky Invulnerable Body technique. Alright?”

“Restore the spirit energy here?” The man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he gazed at Snowy who was there on Yang Ye’s shoulder. He fell silent for a short while and nodded, “Alright!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, glanced at the surroundings, and then gradually soared up into the air. After that, he closed his eyes slowly.

A short moment later, Yang Ye unleashed the Sword Domain. It was quite strenuous for him to envelop the entire tower with his Sword Domain.

But he could still accomplish it!

Yang Ye captured the sword energy of Heaven Executor, and a moment later, he started using his own sword energy and sword intent to destroy them.

However, something unexpected happened.

Countless sword howls resounded throughout the tower, and then countless rays of sword energy rained down upon Yang Ye like a storm.

Heaven Executor’s sword energy was counterattacking!
