Chapter 1887 – Feng Yu!

Needless to say, the golden statue was extremely formidable!

However, it couldn’t compare to the Primordial Pagoda.

After being in contact with the Primordial Pagoda for so long, they knew its temper well. It hated others challenging and provoking it!

Now that the golden statue was doing so openly, they had no doubt that the Primordial Pagoda would be infuriated.

Sure enough, the sky trembled, and then waves of terrifying pressure slammed down from above.

Qiong Qi and Hou Qing’s eyelids twitched at the sight of it, and they moved backwards.

The Primordial Pagoda was clearly in a very bad mood, so it was best to go as far as possible.

The pressure slammed down upon the golden statue.

Bang!

The golden statue was pushed down incessantly. However, it was still resisting. Countless rays of golden light swept out incessantly from it to resist the pressure from the Primordial Pagoda, but it didn’t make a difference.

The golden light it emanated was suppressed and obliterated!

However, the golden statue still refused to give up!

Yang Ye had quite a solemn expression on his face. It’s truly extraordinary! Even though it’s no match for the Primordial Pagoda, it’s able to hold on for so long. It’s the only one who has been capable of doing that until now!Unfortunately, no matter how extraordinary it was, it couldn’t overcome the Primordial Pagoda.

Finally, the golden statue was pushed to the ground, and its golden light vanished.

It was defeated!

The surroundings calmed down again.

Suddenly, Hou Qing said, “Absorb it!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “Can I control it?”

Hou Qing shook his head, “It’s a precious treasure of the Buddhist Sect, and you don’t know their techniques. So, you can’t take control of it. Devouring it will strengthen your body and make it rise a level higher!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi added, “However, you may get into a lot of trouble in the future!”

“Trouble?” Yang Ye gazed at Qiong Qi, “Is the Buddhist Sect very strong?”

Qiong Qi glanced at Yang Ye and spoke indifferently, “Their ancestor is an equal to your master. So, what do you think?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Suddenly, Hou Qing said, “There’s nothing to be afraid of. There’s so many different types of karma coiled around him already! So, what will one more change? Don’t think so much about it and just improve your strength!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “I think so too!”

Presently, he was cultivating the techniques of multiple races, so becoming enemies with the Buddhist Sect didn’t really make a huge difference.

Qiong Qi glanced at Yang Ye, “I really look forward to the day you go up there.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Qiong Qi spoke indifferently, “I want to see how you survive!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

He didn’t waste any time and started absorbing the golden statue. If he was all alone, he wouldn’t really dare to do it. After all, it was quite a heaven defying treasure. But he had the Primordial Pagoda!

As soon as he started to absorb it, his entire body trembled violently, and he started to emanate faint golden light.

Qiong Qi gazed at Hou Qing, “What are you trying to do?”

Hou Qing spoke indifferently, “You think I’m leading him to his doom?”

Qiong Qi replied, “Those fellows from the Buddhist Sect are terrifying.”

Hou Qing fell silent for a short while and replied, “Is there anyone amongst the people he has offended who isn’t terrifying?”

Qiong Qi fell silent. Even though Yang Ye hadn’t been to the upper universe yet, he’d offended many powerful figures from there, and not one of them was ordinary.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing added, “Have you not noticed? The situation he’s in is already extremely bad. So, how much worse can it become? Thus, it’s better to risk everything and make it utterly horrible. Perhaps a chance to survive will appear then!”

Qiong Qi remained silent.

Hou Qing gazed at Yang Ye with a trace of complicated emotions in his eyes, “I originally planned to bring him into my shaman race. But now it seems like even my shaman race wouldn’t dare to let him stay.”

Qiong Qi spoke abruptly, “Neither would my demon race!”

Hou Qing chuckled and spoke seriously, “Actually, I really want to meet those three people who are standing behind him?”

Qiong Qi asked, “Those three who changed his fate?”

Hou Qing nodded, “If they show themselves, it’ll be quite a sight. Of course, most importantly, it’s his master… His attitude towards everything will be the key.”

Qiong Qi nodded.

If the old man in Daoist’s robes acknowledged Yang Ye as his disciple and protected Yang Ye, then every problem Yang Ye had right now wouldn’t be a problem anymore. Because regardless of whether it was the Sovereign of Man, the Sovereign of Sky, or the Buddhist Sect, they wouldn’t dare to act against Yang Ye!

However, Yang Ye was just an independent cultivator until the old man in Daoist’s robes publicly acknowledged Yang Ye!

Time trickled by, and the golden light around Yang Ye grew stronger and stronger. An ethereal golden figure gradually appeared before him, and it was the golden statue from before. However, it was countless times larger now!

“The Gold Form!” Hou Qing spoke solemnly, “The Gold Form of the Buddhist Sect. Even Quasi Enlightened Realm experts won’t be able to harm that kid now!”

Qiong Qi nodded, “I really envy him.”

Hou Qing glanced at Qiong Qi, “Would you dare to absorb it if you were given the chance?”

Qiong Qi shook his head decisively, “I don’t want to offend those baldies.”

Hou Qing gazed at Yang Ye, “Only that kid dares to do so. After all, I don’t think there’s anything he doesn’t dare to do!”

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s eyes opened slowly. As soon as that happened, two rays of golden light surged out from them. At this moment, his eyeballs were actually golden. But it didn’t take long for them to gradually return to normal.

At the same time, the golden figure around Yang Ye vanished!

Hou Qing said, “Congratulations!”

Yang Ye smiled and slowly clenched his fists. Golden light flickered on them. At this moment, he felt like he could obliterate the world!

Strength!

His entire body was filled with strength!

Yang Ye gazed at Qiong Qi and chuckled, “Brother Qiong Qi, how about we spar?”

Qiong Qi glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Once we get to the upper universe, I’ll spar with you to your heart’s content!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing suddenly said, “It’s best if you ascend to the Enlightened Realm before going up to the large universe!”

Yang Ye gazed at Hou Qing, and the latter continued, “Do you realize what kind of situation you’re in? Once you go up there, it’ll definitely not be peaceful for you. So, don’t be satisfied with your current strength and work harder on getting stronger!”

Yang Ye nodded. There was no strongest existence in this world, only even stronger ones!

Suddenly, Yang Ye flipped his palm, and a spatial ring appeared there.

It was the spatial ring that the monkey had given him.

Yang Ye glanced at it, and he noticed many books within it. It was all sorts of scriptures, cultivation techniques, and combat techniques. It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to find a thumb-sized white colored pearl.

Yang Ye withdrew it, and then Hou Qing spoke with surprise, “A Buddhist Relic!”

Yang Ye gazed at Hou Qing, and the latter explained, “It’s a treasure. If you place it within your sea of consciousness, it’ll keep your mind clear at all times. Most importantly, it can be used as an equipment spirit, and it will bestow the weapon with the ability to ward away evil and destroy all obstacles in your path.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “Simply speaking, it keeps the heart clear, wards away evil, and destroys obstacles in a person’s path. So, keeping it with you will be very beneficial to your advancement into the Enlightened Realm!”

Yang Ye glanced at the pearl. Indeed, as he held the pearl, he felt extremely calm. It was a feeling that was indescribably with words.

Yang Ye played with Snowy, Xue’er, and the others for a while, and then he left the Primordial Pagoda.

He went to Heaven Pillar Mountain.

As soon as he arrived there, a figure appeared out of thin air before him.

That person had just appeared there without any signs of movement.

He seemed to be around the age of 30. He wore white clothes, held a white fan, and his feet were around 10cm away from the ground.

He seemed completely untainted!

Like an immortal from the heavens!

Yang Ye asked, “Who are you?”

The middle aged man sized up Yang Ye and said, “Luo Wuchen. Right, you might not have heard of me. However, you should have heard of the three ancient cultivators that everyone speaks about. I’m one of them!”

An ancient cultivator!

Heaven Pillar Mountain had three ancient cultivators, four Heavenly Exalts, and five Emperors. Yang Ye had met the Heavenly Exalts and Emperors, but he’d never met any one of the three ancient cultivators.

Yet now, one of them was before him!

Yang Ye glanced at him and asked, “Do you need something?”

Luo Wuchen nodded slightly, “We’re holding a meeting, and we want to invite you.”

“A meeting?” Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What meeting?

Luo Wuchen said, “A meeting that’s related to everyone’s future. Everyone who possesses strength above the Enlightened Realm has been invited.”

Everyone stronger than the Enlightened Realm!

Yang Ye asked, “Are there many?”

Luo Wuchen smiled, “There aren’t a few!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Alright, I’ll attend it!”

Luo Wuchen nodded, “Come with me!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of white light that shot up into the sky.

Yang Ye tapped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that shot off after Luo Wuchen.

Around an hour later, they arrived in the boundless reaches of outer space. Yang Ye saw a bamboo forest there, and there was a bamboo house at the center of the forest.

The bamboo house was fully made of mysterious white bamboo. It wasn’t very large, and it was only able to accommodate around 10 people.

Yang Ye asked, “What is this place?”

Luo Chen spoke softly, “Feng Yu Forest!”

Feng Yu Forest!

Yang Ye’s entire body trembled.

Feng Yu was his mother’s name!
