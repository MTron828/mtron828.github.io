Translator: InVader Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

A ray of blood red light flashed through the sky above Oblivion Boundary City, and it didn’t take long for Yang Ye’s group to arrive within the city.

However, Yang Ye’s face became gloomy when he arrived at the Goat Pub.

Because it was empty.

No, there was one last person, and it was a woman in a green dress. Yang Ye knew the woman. Her name was Xiao Lu, and she was one of Ding Shaoyao’s trusted subordinates.

Yang Ye asked in a low voice, “Where’s your young miss?”

Xiao Lu spoke softly, “You’re too late!”

Yang Ye’s hands trembled, “What… what are you trying to say?”

She looked him in the eyes and said, “You know… My young miss expected this to happen when she started to help you investigate that power. That power is much more terrifying than we ever imagined. As for us, the resources available to us were too inferior, so no matter how careful we were, it’s impossible for us to escape their notice. We advised her to stop because we couldn’t continue doing this. But she refused to listen.”

Yang Ye closed his eyes, “Where is she?”

Xiao Lu remained silent for a long time, and then she said, “She knew they would come for her, so when they did, she took her own life. She didn’t want to be captured and used as a pawn to threaten you.”

Silence filled the surroundings.

Two streams of clear liquid had suddenly started seeping out of the corners of Yang Ye’s eyes. A long time passed before he said, “It was me. I caused her death. It was me… I should have expected that they would come for her. I should have thought of it…”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around and walked towards the door. However, he was stopped by Blood Maiden and An Nanjing.

Blood Maiden said, “Don’t be rash. You won’t be able to take revenge, and you’ll only be giving your life away.”

An Nanjing spoke as well, “If you die, wouldn’t she have died for nothing?”

Meanwhile, Xiao Lu suddenly said, “My young miss said that if you want to avenge her, then don’t act rashly. There’ll only be hope while you’re still alive.”

Yang Ye clenched his fists and remained silent for a long time. He turned around and walked away, “Let me calm down.”

Blood Maiden and An Nanjing didn’t stop him. At this moment, Yang Ye really needed to calm down.

Blood Maiden glanced at An Nanjing. The latter nodded slightly and followed Yang Ye out.

After An Nanjing and Yang Ye left, Blood Maiden gazed at Xiao Lu, “Where’s your young miss’s corpse?”

Xiao Lu shook her head, “I don’t know.”

Blood Maiden frowned slightly, “You don’t know?”

Xiao Lu nodded, “She was in the room when she met with that mysterious woman. But when I went in later, both of them had vanished. Besides that, every single member of ours that participated in the investigation of that mysterious power were killed.”

Blood Maiden gazed at Xiao Lu, “Then why are you still alive?”

Xiao Lu gazed at Blood Maiden, “She wanted me to give you a message.”

Blood Maiden asked, “What message?”

Xiao Lu said, “She said that she has prepared your graves. Now, all those graves lack are your bodies.”

Blood Maiden nodded slightly, “I’ll allow her to understand what it’s like to dig your own grave.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Blood Maiden turned around and left.

At the entrance of the Goat Pub, Yang Ye sat on the ground while lying against the wall beside the door. His gaze was aimed at the sky, and it was completely lifeless and seemed to be slightly lost.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing sat silently by his side.

Console him? She didn’t know how to do that. However, she felt that nothing she could say would make a difference. Just being by his side was enough!

A long time passed before Yang Ye spoke softly, “I never expected her to do that…” He knew Ding Shaoyao from Profounder Continent, and there had been quite a bit of conflict between them at that time. Even though they made up in the end and had a good impression of each other, it was far from being love.

But he hadn’t expected her to actually do that for him.

An Nanjing spoke softly, “Would you feel regret if you died for her sake?”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly.

An Nanjing didn’t say another word, and Yang Ye understood what she meant.

Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye stood up and took An Nanjing’s hand, “Let’s head to the Nether Pavilion together!”

Strength!

At this moment, Yang Ye desperately desired to improve his strength. Only with sufficient strength could he save Zi’er, and only then could he take revenge. Presently, he wasn’t able to fight back against that mysterious power. The important matter at hand for him was to improve his strength and not waste time here.

No matter how great the pain and sadness in his heart were, he had to keep them at bay right now.

Yang Ye’s group of three left Oblivion Boundary City.

Two hours later, Blood Maiden brought them to a desolate area.

Extremely desolate!

That was what Yang Ye thought right now.

They continued forward, and it didn’t take long for ruins to appear within their vision. Based on the appearance of the ruins, they could imagine that grand buildings definitely used to exist in this desolate area.

A short while later, a damaged palace appeared before them. Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto the center of the palace. There were three characters there ‘幽冥殿’.

Obviously, it was the Nether Pavilion’s headquarters.

Blood Maiden remained silent as she gazed at that palace. There were slight ripples of emotions in her eyes. She seemed to be recalling the past.

Quite some time passed before her gaze became calm once more, “Head in.”

Once they entered the palace, the surroundings instantly dimmed down and felt quite oppressive. It was very oppressive inside the palace.

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Second Sister, can you tell me about the Nether Pavilion?”

He was curious about the Nether Pavilion. It was an extremely mysterious power, and it was so mysterious that even the people of the large world knew very little about it.

Blood Maiden remained silent for an instant, and then she said, “The Nether Pavilion was created by someone from outside this universe. The Nether Pavilion doesn’t just have the ten Nether Halls, it has a Nether Judge, the three Nether Bureaus, the Nether Earthly Buddha, the two Nether Envoys, the three Nether Saints, the five Nether Phantoms, and so on and so forth. Besides that, there’s the Nether Cavalry beneath them.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “Amongst these, the Nether Judges are comparatively stronger and the most mysterious. Even we have never met them. The next in line is the Nether Earthly Buddhas, and then the three Nether Saints. After that, it’s the five Nether Phantoms. We, the ten Nether Halls, are ranked right at the bottom!”

Shock!

Yang Ye and An Nanjing were completely shocked when they heard her!

They hadn’t expected the ten halls of the Nether Pavilion to just be a part of the Nether Pavilion. Moreover, it was the comparatively weaker part of the Nether Pavilion!

What a joke!

How terrifying were Blood Maiden and the others?

But the ten halls of the Nether Pavilion were actually just the comparatively weaker part of the entire Nether Pavilion!

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden continued, “Our headquarters isn’t on Sky Sky Continent. We, the ten Nether Halls, merely came to Sky Sky Continent because of a mission. But not long after we arrived here, our Hall Master vanished abruptly. The Nether Pavilion instantly started falling into chaos once the Hall master vanished. Everyone was fighting for the position of Hall Master. Our eldest sister had no intention to fight for that position, so we stayed here and didn’t return. However…”

Her face became icy cold when she spoke up to this point, “But we still weren’t able to avoid it. It didn’t take long for the Nether Earthly Buddha to arrive at Sky Sky Continent to look for us. He wanted us to follow him and help him seize the position of Hall Master. Eldest Sister naturally refused, but he actually captured Boundary Maiden and Oblivion Maiden in order to threaten us. In the end, we secretly received help from the Nether Earthly Buddha’s competition and saved both of them, and we killed the Nether Earthly Buddha.”

Yang Ye asked, “Is the Nether Earthly Buddha very strong?”

Blood Maiden nodded, “Very strong. Besides the other members of the Nether Pavilion, there may only be three others, whom I’ve met, that are able to defeat him in a one on one battle.”

Yang Ye was curious, “Which three?”

She replied, “The Unfettered One at the Rebirth Realm. The Unfettered One can defeat him with a cultivation at the Rebirth Realm, but the Unfettered One wouldn’t be able to kill him. The second is that mysterious person of this world who was born along with all things. That person can kill him, but it wouldn’t be that easy. Moreover, that person will have to rely on the energy of all things. The last one is that old man in a Daoist’s robe that killed Jian Wuji! That old man is so strong that his strength surpasses my knowledge. Not to mention a Nether Earthly Buddha, I’m afraid even the Hall Master at peak strength wouldn’t be able to fight him!”

The old man in a Daoist’s robe! Yang Ye’s heart shook. Who was the old man? Perhaps only Xiao Qi, who was in deep sleep, knew the answer to that question. The old man’s strength was really quite abnormal. Actually, it wasn’t just quite abnormal, it was absolutely abnormal. After all, just a clone of his had been able to kill Jian Wuji who’d activated the Stellar Sword Diagram. Just a clone!

If just his clone was so strong, then how strong was his main body?

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden continued, “Even though we killed the Nether Earthly Buddha, that wasn’t the end of it. The one who’s pulling the strings from the shadows and acting against us is from the Nether Pavilion as well!”

Yang Ye’s expression changed, “She’s from the Nether Pavilion as well?”

Blood Maiden nodded slightly, “She’s one of the two Nether Envoys, the Scholarly Envoy. She possesses the greatest authority in the Nether Pavilion, and she manages all the affairs in the pavilion. She was the one who gave us the mission to come to Sky Sky Continent.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why is she trying to kill all of you?”

Blood Maiden replied, “Because the Nether Earthly Buddha was her older brother. Her older brother by blood. They were extremely close!”

Yang Ye nodded, “So that’s why.”

Blood Maiden said, “That’s roughly what happened. Strictly speaking, it can be considered to be an internal conflict of our Nether Pavilion. I’m sorry that you were implicated in all of this.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I have one last question. What’s the mission you were sent to complete in Sky Sky Continent?”

Blood Maiden fell silent for an instant, and then she replied, “Capture this universe’s Lord of the Heaven Dao alive.”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned. He was about to speak when a ray of white light suddenly flashed, and then Little Sky appeared in front of Blood Maiden.

“Hmph! Hmph!” Little Sky gazed at Blood Maiden and laughed coldly.
