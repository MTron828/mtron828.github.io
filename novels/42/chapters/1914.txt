Chapter 1915 – She’s Under My Protection!

The old man gazed at Nansi Yin, “Aren’t you curious why I’m giving it to you?”

She nodded, “I am quite curious!”

The old man smiled, “Actually, both of you aren’t ideal to me. However, since you were able to get here, it represents that the heavens have chosen both of you. Perhaps both of you don’t believe in that, but I still do believe in these things.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “Of course, you’re not bad yourself. The Immortal Spirit Body. I’ve only seen it a few times in my life!”

Nansi Yin lowered her head slightly, “I didn’t think you would notice!”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “What’s that?”

The old man smiled, “A unique physique.”

Yang Ye wanted to ask more, but the old man shook his head, “I don’t have much time left. Let’s begin!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man suddenly floated up into the air and arrived above Nansi Yin. After that, he placed his palms on her head.

Bang!

A strand of pure white energy surged into her.

Yang Ye watched with astonishment as Nansi Yin’s aura started rising madly. It didn’t take long for her to rise from the 1st stage into the 2nd stage of the Enlightened Realm!

After that, it didn’t stop at all, and her aura continued rising madly.

It didn’t take long for her to rise into the 4th stage of the Enlightened Realm, but her aura was still rising!

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched from the sight of this, “That’s cheating!”

Just like that, Nansi Yin advanced from the 1st stage to the 5th stage of the Enlightened Realm in a short while!

The peak! She was at 5th stage of the Enlightened Realm!

However, her aura was still rising incessantly!

The old man suddenly said, “Suppress it!”

Nansi Yin placed her hands on her stomach and started suppressing her cultivation.

She couldn’t continue higher!

Because her foundation would become severely unstable if she advanced further. She would be like a tower that hadn’t been built level by level, so it may fall from a gale!

Her aura gradually calmed down, and fully calmed down in the end. As for her cultivation, it stopped at the 5th stage of the Enlightened Realm!

However, the inheritance process hadn’t come to an end. An increase in cultivation wasn’t the only thing she was inheriting, there was the old man’s cultivation techniques and experiences in cultivation. Those were the most important parts of the inheritance.

Snowy suddenly pointed at the old man and Nansi Yin, and then she gazed at Yang Ye while curiosity filled her eyes.

Yang Ye smiled and said, “It’s an inheritance. Right, after that’s completed, she’ll become very powerful!”

Snowy blinked. Suddenly, she flew over to Yang Ye’s head, and then she placed one of her paws on Yang Ye’s head. After that, she closed her eyes like the old man did, and then a strand of pure spirit energy emerged from her paw and surged into Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

While she transferred spirit energy into Yang Ye, Snowy frequently opened an eye and shot a glance at the old man. She was watching what he was doing.

As for Yang Ye, he didn’t stop Snowy. As far as he was concerned, all that mattered was that Snowy was happy!

Time trickled by. A small white brand appeared on Nansi Yin’s forehead. It was shaped like a person, and the white robed old man’s figure was growing increasingly ethereal.

Yang Ye lowered his head slightly. A short while later, he shot a glance outside the cave and remained silent.

Others had discovered this place!

Actually, it made sense. Baili Xian had fled from here, and the old man’s aura had escaped the cave, so countless experts may have gathered outside.

Yang Ye gazed at Nansi Yin. She’s obtained great fortune, but at this moment, she was facing great danger too! He finally understood why the old man wanted him to protect her!

Two hours later.

The old man suddenly released her, and Nansi Yin opened her eyes. She gazed at the old man and knelt down slowly, “Master!”

Master!

A trace of gratification appeared in the old man’s eyes when he heard that.

The old man nodded slightly and said, “I started cultivating from a young age, and I had no one close to me or a disciple throughout my life. As I grew older and my lifespan was almost up, I finally understood something. Cultivation, the pursuit of the secrets of the universe, increased my lifespan and gave me boundless strength, but there were many better things in this world.”

He glanced at Yang Ye and Nansi Yin at this point and smiled, “You naturally have to explore and accomplish things while you’re young and without any limits, but never forget the people by your side.”

Yang Ye nodded and remained silent.

Nansi Yin replied, “I’ll remember your guidance, Master!”

The old man smiled and gazed at Yang Ye, “It’s impossible to give her my entire inheritance over a short while, and neither can her body endure it. So, I’ve sealed everything within her forehead. It’s an Inheritance Seed. Once I leave, others will come to take it from her. At that time, please help keep her safe.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’ll try my best!”

Both he and Snowy had benefited from the old man, so he would naturally not refuse such a small request. Otherwise, he would be too ungrateful.

The old man smiled, “Even though she’s at the 5th stage of the Enlightened Realm now, she didn’t accomplish it through her own cultivation. So, she hadn’t gotten used to it and absolutely can’t fight. Otherwise, it’s very likely that she’ll suffer from backlash. In short, it’s all up to you!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Farewell, Senior!”

The old man looked up slowly. It seemed like he’d glanced into the depths of space, and a short while passed before he suddenly said, “Young Brother, there is too much karma coiled around you, and I’m even helpless against some of them. I can only give you a piece of advice — never forget your original intentions. Only then will your life be complete.”

As soon as he finished speaking, his body started turning ethereal.

Nansi Yin remained on her knees, and she looked down in silence.

It didn’t take long for the old man to vanish in midair.

Bang!

In an instant, the cave vanished. Yang Ye looked up, and he saw a sky covered in dark clouds. It didn’t take long for pea-sized raindrops to shower down.

“The death of a Sage!” Meanwhile, Nansi Yin spoke abruptly, “Master was a good person.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I could sense that. Right, are all Sages good people?”

Nansi Yin shook her head, “Everyone has a different understanding of what a good person is. The Sages of the human race are evil in the eyes of other races, and the Sages of other races are evil in the eyes of the human race!”

Yang Ye smiled and gazed at her, “Congratulations!”

Nansi Yin walked over to Yang Ye, and then she withdrew a scroll and crushed it.

Yang Ye asked, “What’s that?”

She replied, “An emergency summoning token!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when the sky above them suddenly shook, and then an old man’s image appeared there. The old man gazed at Nansi Yin, “Nansi Yin, why have you used your emergency summoning token?!”

Nansi Yin looked the old man in the eyes and said, “Tell my father and the 12 Soul Attendants of my Nansi Clan to come get me!”

“What?” The old man exploded with rage, “Nansi Yin, are you joking? Do you know…”

Meanwhile, Nansi Yin waved her hand and looked the old man in the eyes, “I’ve obtained the Sage’s inheritance!”

The Sage’s inheritance!

The old man was stunned, and then he gazed at Nansi Yin’s forehead. As soon as he saw it, the old man was filled with wild joy. He spoke excitedly in a trembling voice, “Good! Good! I’ll immediately…”

Suddenly, the old man vanished, and he was replaced by a middle aged man. The middle aged man looked quite like Nansi Yin.

The middle aged man glanced at her forehead, and a wisp of joy flashed through his eyes when he saw the brand there. However, it only took a moment for him to glance at the surroundings, and then he frowned.

Nansi Yin asked, “How long will it take?”

The middle aged man fell silent for a moment and replied, “Six hours!”

The Nansi Clan was at the southern edge of the Southern Unicorn Prefecture, and they were in the Shaman Dimension that was past the northern edge of Northern Sky Prefecture.

It was too far!

Six hours!

Nansi Yin gazed at Yang Ye, and the latter said, “I’ll try my best!”

Nansi Yin spoke softly, “Thank you!”

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye, “If you can protect my daughter, my clan will help you with something once.”

Yang Ye smiled, and he didn’t say anything. After all, it was just a promise that didn’t carry any weight.

The middle aged man didn’t speak further as well. He just glanced at the surroundings while a trace of worry appeared in his eyes.

After that, his body gradually turned ethereal.

A short while later, he’d vanished completely.

The area fell silent.

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy who was in his arms and said, “Be good and go inside to play. I have something to do!”

Snowy blinked, and then she kissed Yang Ye’s forehead before flashing into the Primordial Pagoda.

She knew that Yang Ye was about to get down to business.

Once Snowy entered the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he closed his eyes slowly, “Who’s coming first?”

“Haha…” Suddenly, laughter resounded, and then a figure appeared around 300m away from them.

It was Baili Xian!

Baili Xian gazed at Yang Ye while resentment filled his eyes, “Don’t even think you’ll be able to leave with your lives after getting the Sage’s inheritance. Both of you’ve merely helped someone else collect their prize. Haha…”

He hadn’t been able to enter the cave because of Yang Ye. It was a loss of a fortuitous encounter to him, so it was obvious how much he hated Yang Ye!

Suddenly, Yang Ye opened his eyes, and then a wave of mysterious energy appeared.

The Sword Domain!

An instant later, a ray of light flashed.

Split Second!

The Sword Domain combined with Split Second!

Besides the Invincible Sword Domain, it was Yang Ye’s strongest attack.

As soon as Yang Ye attacked, Baili Xian’s expression had changed drastically, and a wave of golden light swept out from him.

Bang!

The golden light was dispersed, and Baili Xian was blasted away.

Mouthfuls of blood sprayed from him as his figure shot through the air.

However, another ray of golden light flashed within the Sword Domain.

Baili Xian’s eyes opened wide, and then…

Hiss!

His head flew up into the air.

Blood sprayed out like a fountain!

Yang Ye descended besides Baili Xian’s head. He lowered his sword and pointed at Nansi Yin, “She’s under my protection!”
