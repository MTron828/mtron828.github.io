Chapter 2752 – Order Established!

He was very well aware that Yang Busi had actually not stayed because of the Yang Clan. He could sense that the Yang Clan was still very dear to her.

The Yang Clan!

During her era, the Yang Clan had definitely been extremely united.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Unfortunately, as time passed, the Yang Clan fell into a decline.

Actually, Yang Ye was quite worried. Because the mysterious strongest form of Destiny was truly strong, and if she gathered the other three forms of Destiny and merged with them… Her strength…

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at Huang Ying’s group, “Let’s go!”

Huang Ying hesitated for a moment and asked, “Those experts from the End World…”

Yang Ye glanced at the direction the mysterious expert and the others had vanished from, and he said, “They will show themselves again!”

He led the others away once he finished speaking.

On their way back to Paradise City, Yang Ye withdrew the transmission rock, and then it trembled before a voice came from within it, “We’re still investigating. We’ll notify you when we have something!”

Yang Ye nodded. He put the transmission stone away and looked into the distance. His gaze gradually turned icy cold. Of course he refused to just let go of this. Since he’d chosen to fight them, he planned to kill them all!

Either he or the End World had to die!

Paradise City.

In the city, Yang Ye glanced at the others and said, “Everyone, while we won the battle, we didn’t really win. That mysterious expert is still alive, so don’t let your guard down!”

They nodded. The mysterious expert’s strength had been branded deep within their hearts. If it hadn’t been for Yang Busi’s arrival, the outcome may have been very different!

Yang Ye continued, “Let’s put the End World aside for now. We need to organize ourselves now.”

They gazed at Yang Ye and were quite puzzled.

Yang Ye stood up, “I’m sure there is some enmity between all of you, including between me and the Eternal Kingdom!”

The experts of the Eternal Kingdom led by Liu Yuan glanced at Yang Ye and were quite worried.

Obviously, they were worried Yang Ye would try to get even with them now!

Yang Ye continued, “What I’m trying to say is no matter what enmity you’ve had in the past, you have to let it go now. We only have two enemies right now, the End World and Destiny.”

There were four forms of Destiny, but he was naturally speaking about the strongest form of Destiny!

Yang Ye had always considered her to be an enemy!

They kept their gazes on Yang Ye and waited for him to continue.

Yang Ye was undoubtedly the person with the most authority here right now.

Yang Ye continued, “As for the division of territory and interests, let me emphasize again. It isn’t the time for that. However, I can promise all of you that once everything is over, I’ll ask the Sprite Progenitor and the divine vein to restore the spirit energy in Eternal Kingdom. Not only there, we’ll restore the spirit energy throughout the universe. Of course, the precondition is that all wars must be halted!”

“I’m afraid that will be quite difficult!” Meanwhile, Huang Ying spoke softly, “The world is huge, and some wars are unavoidable.”

The others nodded.

The universe was too, too huge. While they were from all over the universe, there were countless smaller organizations and powers throughout the universe. It was absolutely difficult to make those smaller organizations and powers abide by certain rules and order!

Yang Ye said, “We’ll make an example out of someone!”

They gazed at him.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Everyone, the Three Dimensional Universe is actually in ruins. At a time like, as a part of the Three Dimensional Universe, I think we should do some self-reflection. Otherwise, if the Three Dimensional Universe collapses, where will we go then? The Four Dimensional Universe? Do you think that will work?”

Actually, he didn’t want to go either. Or it should be said he didn’t want to go to the Four Dimensional Universe. He wanted the Three Dimensional Universe to be his last stop. He hoped that he could just stay here and spend time with his loved ones.

After so many years of fighting, he was actually tired, really tired.

The others shook their heads upon hearing Yang Ye.

The Four Dimensional Universe was too mysterious to them. Moreover, it wasn’t a place they could go. They knew that very well. It could be said that the Three Dimensional Universe was their final home.

Only experts at Jian Wudi’s level would think about going to the Four Dimensional Universe and going beyond their own limits!

Because they were really at their own limits! And they wanted to advance further!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye stood up, “I’m not a selfless person, nor am I someone who cares about the world. I can frankly tell you that the Three Dimensional Universe’s future may not be very important to me. As far as I’m concerned, the safety of my loved ones is most important to me. However, since the universe helped me this time, I’m willing to help the universe as well.”

He closed his eyes slowly, “Order. This world needs order. I will select 20 peak Destiny Realm experts to become the protectors of that order. They will patrol the universe and kill all those who act recklessly, break the rules, cause wars, kill the sprites of the world…”

At this point, Yang Ye opened his eyes and gazed at them, “Tell every person, organization, and clan in the world that the Three Dimensional Universe had nothing to do with me in the past. But now, since I’ve chosen to protect it, all of them must follow my rules. If anyone refuses to accept it, they can come see me. I’ll beat them up until they do! Of course, I’ll discuss most of those rules with all of you, and we’ll decide on them together.”

The solemn expressions on everyone’s faces eased up when they heard this.

Yang Ye didn’t plan to rule the world by force and absolute power. If everyone was going to discuss it together, it meant that everyone here would be managing the Three Dimensional Universe in the future.

All of them felt much better when they thought up to this point.

They were about to join in something big!

In the past, only the strong were respected in the Three Dimensional Universe, and it had no order or rules. The strong could do as they pleased. Yang Ye was clearly aware of that as well. Of course, if they could become stronger than Yang Ye, then they could overthrow his version of order!

All of them gazed at Yang Ye when they thought up to this point, and then they couldn’t help but shake their heads and chuckle.

In the hall, Yang Ye gazed at the sword by his waist, and then he shook his head and chuckled. In the past, he’d protected his loved ones with his sword, yet now, he would be using it to protect the entire Three Dimensional Universe! But before this, he’d been the most shameless person alive!

High above the clouds in a distant world, a woman in a dark green dress walked over to a tree from her Go board. She gazed at the tree before her and chuckled, “Boundless Divine Tree, did you hear that? Someone plans to overthrow my order.”
