Chapter 2550

As soon as he said that, his sword left its sheath!

Meanwhile, the white-haired old man slammed a punch at him!

Just a punch!

It seemed light as a feather and without any aura. It was like an ordinary punch from an old man.

However, as soon as it slammed against Yang Ye’s sword, Yang Ye’s expression changed!

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted backward with his sword, and he was pushed over 30m back!

A clear fist imprint had appeared on Executor!

However, the imprint merely remained for a moment for vanishing.

The old man glanced at Yang Ye’s sword, “Executor!”

Yang Ye glanced at his numbed arm. At this moment, there was a trace of solemness in his eyes. That punch was very powerful!

The old man’s full strength had been converged in his fist, and it had exploded forth upon coming into contact with Yang Ye’s sword. It was like an erupting volcano that could obliterate the world!

The old man wasn’t weak at all!

Yang Ye gazed at the old man, and the old man glanced at Yang Ye as well, “Sect Master Ye, let me emphasize again that this is the Lu Clan, not the Ancient Sword Sect. So, please know your limits!”

“The Lu Clan?” Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and smiled, but it didn’t take long for his smile to become cold, and then his Sword Domain surrounded the area once more!

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he clenched his right fist. Meanwhile, Yang Ye arrived before the old man and swung his sword with both hands!

12 swings with the Sword Domain!

The improvements in his body, realm of cultivation, and soul had allowed him to overlap 12 swings with the Sword Domain. When the final swing descended, the old man swung a punch as well!

Bang!

The Sword Domain vanished!

Meanwhile, the old man was blasted over 300m away!

At that instant the old man stopped himself, his face instantly became unsightly because the middle aged sword cultivator’s soul had been sliced into countless bits!

Because at the instant Yang Ye had repulsed the old man, two flying swords had shot out of the Sword Gourd. However, those two swords hadn’t attacked the old man, they attacked the middle aged sword cultivator!

The middle aged sword cultivator hadn’t expected Yang Ye to dare distract himself while dealing with an ancestor of his clan, and just that lack of precautions had caused him to be killed by an attack from Yang Ye’s flying swords!

In the Sword Domain, even Lord Realm experts would find his flying swords difficult to resist! Not to mention that this Lord Realm expert hadn’t taken any precautions! Moreover, the sword cultivator only had his soul left, so his strength wasn’t even half of what it used to be.

Once he sliced up the sword cultivator’s soul, Yang Ye devoured it!

Meanwhile, the old man’s face was extremely unsightly. Yang Ye had killed an expert of the Lu Clan in front of him and even devoured that expert’s soul. It was a slap on the Lu Clan’s face!

The old man didn’t allow his thoughts to run wild. He took a step forward, and then the ground beneath Yang Ye cracked apart. A wave of powerful energy surged up from underground and slammed against Yang Ye!

Yang Ye didn’t dare to act carelessly, and he soared up before stabbing his sword down!

Hiss!

A sharp sound of something being sliced apart resounded!

Meanwhile, the old man took a swift stride forward and slammed a punch at him!

Bang!

The space around Yang Ye was instantly turned pitch black!

At the same time, Yang Ye’s figure was blasted over 1km away!

If his body wasn’t quite strong and even protected by sword intent, he may have been obliterated along with the space around him!

The old man didn’t stop and took another step forward. Suddenly, two flying swords shot forward!

The old man grunted coldly and pressed his palm down lightly. The space before him swept forward like a storm.

Bang! Bang!

The flying swords were instantly blasted away!

Meanwhile, the old man suddenly appeared before Yang Ye and slapped his palm at Yang Ye!

Pure strength!

Yang Ye didn’t activate the Sword Domain because it couldn’t endure the old man’s strength. The old man had even almost destroyed it earlier with just a single punch! Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The old man was no ordinary Lord Realm expert!

Yang Ye didn’t shrink back. At the instant the old man swung a punch at him, two Yang Ye’s appeared before the old man!

A clone!

The Divine Avatar Technique!

It was a powerful secret technique he’d obtained from the desolate race, and this clone had 90% of his strength!

Two rays of sword energy descended!

Bang! Bang!

The swords forcefully stopped the old man’s terrifying punch, but Yang Ye and the clone were blasted over 300m away!

Meanwhile, the old man was pushed around 30m back as well!

However, as soon as he stopped himself, two flying swords shot at him!

This time, they were much faster than before! Besides an increase in speed, they were much stronger as well!

Flash!

Yang Ye had used Flash as well!

His swords were at the limits of speed that he could attain!

However, the old man was still able to catch their movements. He unfurled his palms and grabbed both of them. But he’d underestimated the power of the energy and sword intent they carried. Moreover, they were divine treasures!

As soon as he grabbed them, he immediately released them and moved around 100m back.

But as soon as he stopped there, his chest cracked open. It turned out that an invisible sword had struck him!

The sword had stabbed around an inch deep when the old man grabbed Eternal Light with one hand!

He hadn’t even pulled the sword out of himself when Yang Ye appeared before him once more. A moment later, Yang Ye swung his sword with both hands!

At this moment, Yang Ye’s both turned ethereal!

The Sword Domain!

12 swings instantly descended!

The force that erupted at the instant caused the space in a huge area to be instantly obliterated!

The old man was instantly blasted away, all the way into the city. Moreover, countless cracks covered the old man’s arms, causing blood to spray!

Yang Ye stood outside the city with his sword in hand, and peerlessly sharp sword intent surged around him!

Meanwhile, while the old man’s arm had cracked open, it clearly wasn’t a huge problem. The powerful aura the old man emanated even caused the space in a very huge area to ripple before it!

The old man glanced at his arm, and then he looked up at Yang Ye. He laughed with ridicule, “Those who come after truly are greater! As expected of the number one genius in this universe’s younger generation. If you’re given some time, I’m afraid even old geezers like me will be no match for you.”

As he spoke, he slowly clenched his fists!

Shocked!

At this moment, the old man was extremely shocked because Yang Ye was truly too young! He possessed such combat strength at such a young age! It made him seem like one of those geniuses who weren’t restricted by their realms of cultivation!

There was a type of genius in the world, and they weren’t restricted by their realms of cultivation!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly while Executor trembled in his grasp!

The battle would break out at any moment!

However, at this critical moment, the old man frowned, and then his aura was dispersed. Another short while passed, and then he glanced coldly at Yang Ye and left with the other experts of the Lu Clan!

It was sudden!

Very sudden!

Yang Ye glanced at the city.

The Lu Clan doesn’t want to fight anymore?

Yang Ye didn’t give it too much thought and just vanished into the sky!

If they wanted to fight, he would accompany them; but not fighting was fine by him too. In any case, his main enemy was the Soul Sect!

Once Yang Ye left, the white-haired old man from before—who was in the city now—gazed at a hall before him, “Why?”

A voice came from within, “He isn’t ordinary!”

The old man spoke solemnly, “That friend of his killed a member of our clan, and he killed Lu Xiu too!”

A short while later, a voice came from within the hall, “If we kill him, it’s equivalent to moving the Ancient Sword Sect’s swords from the Soul Sect onto us. At that time, the Soul Sect can watch us fight with them. While the Ancient Sword Sect isn’t as strong as it used to be, they aren’t very weak. Conversely, based on their success in repulsing the Soul Sect, they aren’t just not weak, they are very strong. We will stay out of it for now and let them fight each other until both suffer enough losses, then we will reap the rewards. As for Yang Ye, it’s fine. His end will come, one day!”

The old man fell silent for a long time, and then he sighed softly, “Patriarch, a member of our clan was killed right at our front door, yet you are considering this and that… To be honest, while I really want to kill Yang Ye, I sincerely admire everything he has done. He’s a young man, a young man full of hot blood. If my Lu Clan had a young man like him, then even if we can’t become the number one clan amongst all the clans here, we would not live a life of aggrievance and cowardice!”

He turned around and left.

The patriarch?

The old man naturally didn’t fear the patriarch because even the Lu Clan’s patriarch had to address him as uncle.

The old man was Lu Wuwei, an expert who was once renowned through Eternal Kingdom!

All those years ago, his name was known throughout Eternal Kingdom!

A sigh resounded in the hall.

As the patriarch of the Lu Clan, of course he desired to kill Yang Ye and make a show of strength after Yang Ye had humiliated his clan!

But…

Lu Yanming, the patriarch of the Lu Clan sat at the seat of the host, and a petite young girl wasn’t too far away from him.

Her figure seemed to flicker between being ethereal and material, and if one looked carefully, one would notice that it was actually just a clone!

But it was such a clone that made Lu Yanming feel like he was facing a formidable opponent, and he was extremely vigilant!

However, Lu Wuwei hadn’t noticed the presence of the young girl just now!

Lu Yanming gazed at her and remained silent!

She turned around and said, “The Lu Clan doesn’t have to vanish for now!”

She vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.
