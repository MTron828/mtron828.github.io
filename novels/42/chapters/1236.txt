Chapter 1237 – How Accurate!

The black ape roared with fury, “Quickly put your sword away!”

Yang Ye had put his sword away before the black ape finished speaking. Both of them looked up at the sky. The space there was rippling, and it made their eyelids twitch. Fortunately, the space there returned to normal after rippling for a while.

Huff! Huff!

Both of them heaved sighs of relief.

The black ape suddenly turned to look at Yang Ye and roared with fury, “Human! Do you want to die?”

Yang Ye puckered his lips, “Look how cowardly you are! To think that you’re at the Voider Realm! You’re a bigger coward than a Saint!”

The black glared angrily at Yang Ye while its chest rose and fell rapidly. Its fists were clenched tight because it really wanted to attack!

Yang Ye said, “I have other matters to attend to, so I don’t have time to play with you. Until next time!” Yang Ye turned around and walked away once she finished speaking.

The black ape didn’t stop Yang Ye this time. It was mainly because he didn’t dare stop Yang Ye. He was truly quite afraid, afraid that Yang Ye would draw his sword! Or to be more precise, he was afraid of that mysterious expert!

Even though he hadn’t stopped Yang Ye, he would definitely not let it go just like that. Unless he could vent the grievance in his heart, he would probably be unable to sleep for a very long time!

The black ape suddenly roared with fury as he watched Yang Ye’s figure vanish into the distance, and then he slammed his fists against the ground.

Bang!

The ground instantly collapsed!

Yang Ye walked forward for around 15 minutes. Once he confirmed that the black ape hadn’t followed him, he instantly fell to the ground and started gasping for breath. His injuries had naturally not healed completely. It wasn’t just his body that had cracked open earlier, even his internal organs had been injured. Even though the black ape’s injuries were very severe as well, it was merely external injuries for the black ape. It hadn’t suffered any internal injuries!

Actually, he hadn’t drawn his sword rashly earlier; he’d done it intentionally. Even though it was quite risky, he had no other choice. Because the black ape would definitely not let him leave if he didn’t do that!

Yang Ye withdrew a violet crystal and swallowed it. He just left it to transform into spirit energy that was absorbed by the tiny vortex while he looked up at the sky instead. Before this, he’d felt that his strength was sufficient to roam this world, and there probably wasn’t anyone in this world who could pose a threat to his life. Moreover, he felt that even Voids would be helpless against him if he chose to flee.

After all, he was a mid-rank Saint now, and his sword intent was at the Rebirth Realm. Coupled with the Void Flash technique, even Voiders couldn’t rival his speed when he used his full strength.

Yet now, he noticed that he was still quite weak. Not quite, very weak! Without the help of the Sword Spirit or Qiong Qi, he could only resist a Voider or flee, and he couldn’t defeat a Voider. As for experts above the Voider Realm, like that mysterious expert....

He didn’t know what realm of cultivation that person was at, but it was definitely much greater than the Voider Realm!

Rebirth Rank sword intent, the Divine Shift Realm of physical attainments, and the mid-rank of the Saint Realm are far from sufficient! Yang Ye took a deep breath as he clenched his fists slowly. If he couldn’t even kill Voiders, then how could he return to the Radiant Dimension to face the guardians? How could he go to Lady’s air?

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and started to focus on recovering. Presently, his main objective was to recover, and then travel to the ruins of Sword God’s Palace to get the Stellar Sword Diagram and Sword God’s Seal!

An hour later, Yang Ye stood up and vanished into the distance.

After traveling for 8 hours, a damaged expanse of city walls appeared within his field of vision. The city walls were almost 1km tall. As for their width, they stretched out endlessly towards the distance! However, the city walls were damaged. It was broken here and there, and the gate on it was decrepit. It seemed like it would collapse at any moment!

Yang Ye glanced at the scene before him. Meanwhile, ripples arose in the space before him.

Yun Banqing was contacting him!

A short while passed before Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye saw Yun Banqing right after he entered the city, but there were over a dozen others by her side.

Yun Banqing was delighted to see him, and she hurriedly ran over to him and said, “Are... are you alright?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m alright!”

She glanced at him, and then she withdrew a spatial ring and passed it to Yang Ye, “They’re all in there.”

Yang Ye took it and shot a glance at it. Sure enough, the Adamantium Fruit Tree and the Adamantium Fruits were within it. He nodded and said, “I wouldn’t have been able to obtain these without you, so let’s share it equally.”

He was about to give her half when she shook her head, “I don’t want it!”

Yang Ye was puzzled by her reaction, “Why?”

Yun Banqing said, “You saved my life, and I would be dead without you. So how can I take that?”

Yang Ye was about to speak when she added, “Don’t say anything. I have my own principles that I live by, and I would look down on myself if I accepted it!”

He glanced at her and smiled, “Your refusal is very welcome!”

Yun Banqing grinned. Meanwhile, a voice arose from the side, “Miss Yun, who’s that?”

Yang Ye looked over to the source of the voice. He saw a green robed man and a group of others walking towards him and Yun Banqing. She glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Ye Yang, a friend of mine.”

After that, she introduced the green robed man to Yang Ye, “Lin Huang. I encountered some trouble when I entered the city, and it was all thanks to his help that I’m safe now!”

Yang Ye gazed at Lin Huang and nodded slightly. In the end, his gaze stopped for a moment on the old man behind Lin Huang.

An Emperor! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Besides the old man, all the others in the group were Quasi Emperors, including Lin Huang. However, Lin Huang’s aura was much stronger than the others.

Lin Huan sized up Yang Ye and nodded, and then he gazed at Yun Banqing, “Miss Yun, the streets aren’t safe. Let’s return to our lodgings!”

She nodded and gazed at Yang Ye, “It’s very chaotic here. Let’s look for a place to rest for now!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright!” Even though he wanted to head to Sword God’s Palace right now, he didn’t know anything about this place. Not to mention the Sword God’s Palace’s location, he didn’t even know which direction it was in. So, the best course of action was to familiarize himself with this place.

Lin Huang nodded and led them away.

Yun Banqing explained, “This is Sword City, a city that was under Sword God’s Palace all those years ago. Don’t underestimate this city. Even if the Sword God’s Palace didn’t exist, very few would have dared to offend this city. Of course, it was because it was maintained by the Sword God’s palace. Unfortunately, because most of its experts trained in the sword, it was destroyed in the end. I can only wonder what sort of terrible enmity there is between that mysterious expert and the Sword God’s Palace!”

“I want to know the answer to that as well!” said Yang Ye. He really did want to know. Because not only did that person destroy Sword God’s Palace, that person was even hostile to all the sword cultivators in the world. He felt that it wasn’t warranted!

Yun Banqing glanced at the surroundings and said, “This city is a place to stop and rest. The experts that come to Sword God Island would usually choose to stop and rest here. Because demon beasts won’t enter this city. Even though demon beasts wouldn’t enter the city, this place isn’t safe at all and should be described as very dangerous, extremely dangerous!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Yun Banqing said, “Throughout the years, those who didn’t choose to return or couldn’t afford the return fee would choose to stay in the city. Regardless of whether it’s those who can’t go back or those who refuse to go back, they will stop at nothing. It’s extremely common for people to kill in order to seize treasures or gain spirit energy from the death of their victims!”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. Sure enough, he noticed many people watching them from the shadows. However, those people didn’t charge at them. Why? It was naturally because they had an Emperor on their side!

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and looked at Yun Banqing, “You shouldn’t have come here!”

Even though her strength wasn’t bad, it was very weak at a place like this. The weakest amongst the people here were Quasi Emperors, and all of them were ferocious experts. While Yun Banqing was a Quasi Emperor as well, she had too little experience in combat and wasn’t ferocious enough. So, she was definitely at the bottom of the ladder.

Yun Banqing remained silent for a short while before she said, “The reason I came was because that father of mine entered into closed door cultivation. I had no choice but to leave the Yun Clan. Of course, besides avoiding Yun Tianming, there’s another reason, and it’s to do my best!”

“That’s not a wrong thing!” Yang Ye continued, “However, you have to act according to the limits of your strength. Especially when you’re a woman. I’m not looking down on women, but you should realize that if you don’t possess sufficient strength, then it’s extremely dangerous for a woman like you.”

“Brother Ye is absolutely correct!” Meanwhile, Lin Huang suddenly walked over and smiled, “Miss Yun, as a woman, it really is extremely dangerous here. However, don’t worry. You’ll definitely be safe while I, Lin Huang, am here.”

Yun Banqing glanced at Lin Huang and said, “Thank you for your kind intentions!”

Lin Huang grinned, “There’s no need for that between us.” As he spoke, he gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Brother Ye, it’s very dangerous for women to be weak in the outside world. You’re very right indeed. However, I’d like to say that it’s similarly very dangerous for men to lack strength in the outside world. To be honest, you’re quite weak, Brother Ye!”

Yang Ye was stunned, “How did you discern that I’m weak?” After all, he’d concealed his aura with his Sword Domain. So not to mention a Quasi Emperor, even a Voider wouldn’t be able to see through his cultivation!

Lin Huang sized up Yang Ye and smiled, “Even though I don’t know how you concealed your aura, it’s impossible for you to be an Emperor, right? Since you’re not an Emperor, then you should be a Quasi Emperor, right?”

Yang Ye remained silent.

Lin Huang smiled, “Brother Ye, why are you showing me such an expression? Don’t tell me that you’re a Saint!”

Yang Ye shrugged, “How accurate!”

Lin Huang was stunned on the spot. As for Yun Banqing, her eyes opened wide. Besides shock, there was a trace of astonishment in her eyes!
