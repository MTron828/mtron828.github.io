Chapter 2569

Assassins!

Meanwhile, a voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “It’s Heaven’s Avatar, an organization of assassins that’s rather mysterious in Eternal Kingdom. They usually keep a very low profile and do not act against the large powers. I didn’t expect them to help the Soul Sect!”

Yang Ye turned around to gaze at Nether Maiden, and the latter nodded slightly, “We’ll deal with them.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and entered the sect with the others.

Yang Ye was very confident in them.

He turned around to gaze at the Soul Exalt’s group. Suddenly, something unexpected occurred. A translucent figure suddenly appeared in the space behind him, and then a ray of cold light shot toward Yang Ye’s nape!

An assassin!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he reacted very quickly. A moment later, he turned around and swung his sword!

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the translucent figure vanished!

Yang Ye frowned slightly.

A Lord Realm assassin!

It was obvious that the Soul Sect had really gone all out this time!

Yang Ye ignored the assassin and gazed at the Soul Exalt’s group. The Soul Exalt laughed coldly, “The pleasant surprises aren’t over!”

As soon as he said that, a man with a mask over his face appeared on Yang Ye’s right. The man held a saber, and his saber intent was at the Lord Realm!

A powerful Lord Realm saber cultivator!

Meanwhile, a woman with a golden spear suddenly appeared on Yang Ye’s left. She wore a tight black dress and a veil, so her appearance was completely obstructed from view.

Another Lord Realm expert!

The Soul Sect was very well aware that only such Lord Realm experts posed a threat to Yang Ye! They had to be those who were truly strong in the Lord Realm!

Thus, existences in the Lord Realm who could even surmount their realms of cultivation had been sent here today!

Yang Ye glanced at them and smiled, “You’re not from the Soul Sect, right?”

They remained silent.

Yang Ye nodded, “Looks like the other powers can’t wait anymore, and you plan to take matters into your own hands.”

Meanwhile, the saber cultivator suddenly vanished on the spot, and then the space above Yang Ye was sliced open. A terrifying ray of saber energy surged down from above like a waterfall.

A dense amount of pressure instantly assaulted his head!

It didn’t take long for the saber to arrive just half an inch away from Yang Ye’s head. However, a sword slammed against its blade.

Bang!

An explosion resounded!

Yang Ye and the saber cultivator immediately moved apart from each other, and they moved around 300m back. As soon as Yang Ye stopped himself, a powerful aura swept toward him!

It was the spear-wielding woman!

Her spear was like a bolt of lightning that carried the force of the world.

Yang Ye hurriedly stabilized himself, and then the Sword Gourd shook violently while two flying swords shot out from it!

The woman was instantly pushed back, but the saber cultivator charged at Yang Ye again!

The other elite disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect were about to lend him a hand, but the Soul Exalt gave the command, and the other experts behind him charged at those elite disciples!

They were overwhelming their opponents with numbers!

So, the elite disciples were instantly suppressed!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was gradually pushed into a disadvantage in his battle! Obviously, they weren’t ordinary experts. It made sense because they knew how terrifying Yang Ye was, so how could they send ordinary experts to give their lives away?

The Soul Exalt didn’t attack because an aura was locked onto him. If he attacked, the owner of that aura would attack. It could be said that they were keeping each other busy!

The Soul Exalt glanced at the black robed figures by his side. They nodded slightly, and then two powerful auras locked onto Yang Ye!

Yang Ye’s figure stiffened slightly from this, and that caused him to be blasted away by the saber cultivator and woman.

Meanwhile, the black robed figures vanished on the spot.

At this moment, Yang Ye sensed unprecedented danger!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then his figure turned ethereal!

The Sword Domain Sphere!

Bang!

The sound of something shattering resounded. Both the black robed men, the saber cultivator, and the woman were blasted away!

“What?” The Soul Exalt gazed at Yang Ye. At this moment, an extremely powerful wave of sword intent and sword energy surrounded Yang Ye!

Just a moment ago, all four of those Lord Realm experts had been instantly blasted away upon approaching Yang Ye!

The saber cultivator seemed like his entire body had been pierced by swords and was covered in holes!

The woman’s reaction was the fastest, so she’d retreated the fastest too. Thus, she was in a comparatively better state, but she wasn’t lightly injured either. She’d lost her right arm!

It was those two experts from the Soul Sect who’d suffered the least injuries!

Both of them were the strongest here, so they’d retreated as soon as Yang Ye unleashed the Sword Domain Sphere. It was why they’d suffered the least injuries.

But at this moment, they were extremely shocked!

At that instant, they had sensed intense danger!

If they had gone too close just now, they would have been severely injured even if they could avoid death!

Fear!

At this moment, all of them felt intense fear toward Yang Ye!

Yang Ye deactivated the Sword Domain Sphere. While it was extremely powerful, it was difficult to control! The slightest mistake would kill him first!

Once he deactivated it, Yang Ye immediately activated Flash, and then a few flying swords flashed!

The others’ expressions changed drastically, and they retreated. But they weren’t the targets of those flying swords. Those flying swords were aimed at the experts from the Soul Sect who were in battle with the Ancient Sword Sect’s elite disciples!

The sudden arrival of these flying swords took those experts by surprise, and a few heads instantly shot into the air.

Blood sprayed like fountains!

The Soul Exalt’s face turned gloomy from the sight of this, “What? All four of you aren’t enough to take him down?”

Meanwhile, the woman suddenly shouted with fury, and then her spear shot at Yang Ye like a bolt of lightning. Behind the spear was numerous bolts of dazzling lightning.

It shattered everything before it!

The heavily injured saber cultivator didn’t attack again. He just vanished into the sky!

He was just here to help, he wasn’t here to risk his life!

Yang Ye gazed at the spear that was surging in his direction, and then he laughed coldly. Meanwhile, Executor shot forward from his grasp.

Hiss!

A sharp and ear piercing sound of something bearing sliced open resounded!

Executor instantly sliced open the spear with ease, and it didn’t slow down at all as it continued toward the woman!

The woman’s expression changed slightly. Fortunately, those two experts from the Soul Sect suddenly appeared before her. After that, two rays of powerful Soul Energy rippled out and pushed Executor back!

Yang Ye stretched out his right hand, and Executor immediately flew into his grasp.

The fear in the woman’s eyes turned into solemness at this moment!

Yang Ye’s strength was much, much stronger than she’d imagined!

Yang Ye glanced at the experts from the Soul Sect, and he was about to attack when the space before him warped strangely!

The Space Domain!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He was about to counterattack when a wave of a sweet scent assaulted him, and then a woman appeared before him.

Nether Maiden!

Nether Maiden glanced at Yang Ye, “There are 2 Lord Realm assassins and 7 Five World Realm assassins down there!”

Yang Ye replied solemnly, “Go down there! I can deal with the battle up here!”

Nether Maiden shook her head slightly, “The others can deal with them!”

She looked forward as she spoke, “We weren’t able to kill each other that day, so let’s decide who dies today!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she raised her hands slightly, and then the space before her gradually turned ethereal…

Yang Ye didn’t pay any further attention to Nether Maiden and the woman with the Space Domain. He was confident in Nether Maiden because even he didn’t dare to guarantee that he could defeat Nether Maiden!

Yang Ye gazed at the two experts from the Soul Sect and the spear-wielding woman!

Yang Ye walked slowly in their direction, and his sword intent rippled out from him like the tide!

All three of them had extremely solemn expressions on their faces, and they didn’t dare act carelessly at all!

Meanwhile, three sword howls resounded, and then three flying swords suddenly shot forward at them!

At the same time, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

A powerful sword howl tore through space!

Yang Ye’s strength was being enhanced by flash right now, so his speed was many times faster than before. It wasn’t just his speed, his strength had been enhanced tremendously as well!

The flying swords were naturally unable to pose a threat to the black robed men, and they were immediately blasted away upon approaching them. But Yang Ye had arrived before them!

The Sword Domain swept out!

Yang Ye’s sword descended!

13 overlapped swings with the Sword Domain!

As the final swing descended, the space in the surroundings couldn’t endure its strength anymore and instantly collapsed. Meanwhile, the relatively weaker woman was blasted away while defending herself from Yang Ye’s flying sword!

The black robed men from the Soul Sect didn’t retreat or try to dodge it. Two vortexes of souls suddenly appeared before them, and then numerous souls rippled out from them!

Countless souls!

These souls forcefully stopped Yang Ye’s powerful attack, and they even devoured all the sword energy and sword intent around Yang Ye’s sword!

Bang! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

A muffled explosion resounded, and Yang Ye was blasted away with his sword!

Yang Ye stopped over 1km away. At this moment, the space in a huge area around him was covered in souls!

An endless swarm of souls!

Meanwhile, a white-haired old man standing far away in space glanced at Yang Ye’s figure within the vortex of souls, and he said, “Just that won’t be enough to kill him. You go give them a hand!”

As soon as he gave the order, a pitch black colossus soundlessly appeared behind him!

At the same time, in the Primordial Pagoda, Qi Bitian suddenly looked up while kicking her ball. She frowned slightly and said, “What the heck?!”
