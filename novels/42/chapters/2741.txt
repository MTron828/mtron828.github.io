Chapter 2742 – Burial!

Yang Ye looked up with indifference on his face.

The Past Life Clan’s patriarch and Yan Wu had indifferent expressions on their faces as well.

The End World was here!

Actually, it was within their expectations.

The End World wouldn’t just watch as Yang Ye did all of this. Because the powers throughout the universe were watching Yang Ye and them.

They would definitely side with the party that suppressed the other party!

Yan Wu gazed at Yang Ye and smiled, “Allow me!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye had already charged up into the air.

A ray of sword energy pierced through the sky and rippled through the world.

Countless watched as it obliterated the huge hand.

At the instant the hand was obliterated, a saber slashed down from above!

It carried countless rays of saber energy, and it descended like a waterfall from the sky!

Zuo Mu!

A peerless saber cultivator in this current era!

Yan Wu and the others had solemn expressions on their faces. The experts of the End World were truly strong!

Yang Ye stood there in the sky with his sword in hand. He looked up at the sword energy while slowly tightening his grip on his sword sheath. The sword within the sheath trembled lightly and seemed on the verge of leaving it.

A moment later, the saber energy was getting closer to Yang Ye!

Finally, Yang Ye suddenly drew his sword and slashed when the saber energy was around 1m away from him.

Hiss!

The saber energy was instantly sliced open!

Suddenly, a saber struck the tip of Yang Ye’s sword.

Bam!

Yang Ye crashed down rapidly, but it only took a moment for him to slam his right foot down, and then he soared into the air. Meanwhile, Zuo Mu had been blasted over 10km into the air.

Yang Ye was about to attack again, but another ray of saber energy slashed toward him from the right!

Sky Saber!

Yang Ye ignored the saber energy and just charged at Zuo Mu.

At the same time, a figure suddenly flashed by, and then Sky Saber was blasted almost 3km back!

At this moment, a woman had appeared where he’d been standing a moment ago!

It was An Nanjing!

An Nanjing gazed indifferently at Sky Saber, and Dagger-Axe was trembling in her grasp.

Sky Saber’s eyes narrowed slightly as he tightened his grip on his saber.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing suddenly vanished on the spot.

Sky Saber’s pupils constricted, and he swung his saber!

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and his figure was blasted around 3km away again!

At the same time, Yang Ye was locked in battle against Zuo Mu.

Suppression!

In the past, it had been extremely strenuous for Yang Ye to deal with Zuo Mu. Yet now, he’d immediately suppressed Zuo Mu in single combat! However, it wasn’t that easy because Zuo Mu wasn’t weak at all!

Yan Wu and the Past Life Clan’s patriarch exchanged glances. They were about to lend Yang Ye a hand when numerous powerful waves of pressure pressed down upon them!

Yan Wu was shocked and looked over. He saw a few people had appeared on the distant city walls.

They were led by Emperor Li Taixu, and First God who had recovered his body now.

Besides that, there was a black clothed figure near them. That person was covered in black and had their appearance hidden out of view.

Emperor Li glanced at Yan Wu and the others, “So it’s the 10 clans of the past. Unfortunately, the times have changed, and you’re not the same clans you used to be. Leave and don’t interfere in our business with Yang Ye, and our End World will not look for trouble with you.”

Yan Wu chuckled, “What if we refuse?”

Emperor Li replied indifferently, “Destiny didn’t annihilate all of you then, but it’s fine because we don’t mind helping her finish the job.”

Yan Wu clenched his fists slowly. Meanwhile, Emperor Li chuckled, “Have you realized the situation you’re in? Now that Yang Ye and that woman are locked in combat, your side doesn’t have anyone capable left. Do you think that you can defeat us?”

As soon as Emperor Li finished speaking, over a dozen more experts appeared on the city walls.

All of them were Destiny Realm experts!

Yan Wu and the others’ expressions turned quite unsightly.

Emperor Li, First God, and the others were experts among experts. Yan Wu and the others were slightly inferior when compared to them. Yet now, they were even at a disadvantage in numbers. So, they had no chance to win!

Emperor Li added, “I’m not one to waste my breath. I’ll ask one last time, are you going to leave or not?”

Yan Wu and the Past Life Clan’s patriarch exchanged glances. In the end, Yan Wu smiled, “I just called him brother and promised to achieve great things with him. If I were to leave upon encountering trouble now…”

He cupped his fist toward the sky, “If I really did that, the ancestors of my clan would probably rise from their graves with rage.”

The Past Life Clan’s patriarch nodded slightly, “Our clans may not be at our prime anymore, but we cannot lose our backbone. We can’t bring shame to our ancestors.”

Emperor Li gazed at them for a short while and nodded, “Good, very good. Since you’ve chosen death, I’ll fulfill your wish.”

He raised his right hand and waved it down, “Kill them.”

A moment later, over a dozen figures shot down from above the city walls.

Emperor Li led the group!

Yan Wu and the Past Life Clan’s patriarch were about to take action.

Boom!

Suddenly, Emperor Li was blasted away!

Everyone was stunned by this!

Yan Wu and the others watched with astonishment!

A slightly strange looking young girl had appeared before them!

She had two horns on her head, and a dark gold tail behind her!

Erya!

It was Erya!

The Evil Progenitor!

Yan Wu and the Past Life Clan’s patriarch seemed extremely afraid when they saw Erya. As some of the most ancient powers in this world, they knew about Erya. While their clans only had records of her, she was recorded as the most dangerous existence. Besides Destiny, Erya and Snowy were the most dangerous. They were equally matched and merely inferior to Destiny!

They actually didn’t fear Snowy that much. Because Snowy was really… quite harmless right now. She wasn’t terrifying at all. Of course, the precondition was that she wasn’t offended. If she was, she may be even more terrifying than Yang Ye!

Meanwhile, Erya glanced at Yan Wu and the Past Life Clan’s patriarch, and they hurriedly nodded to greet her.

She said, “I’ll fight the two strongest among them, and I’ll leave the rest to all of you. Alright?”

They hurriedly nodded. If all their Destiny Realm experts were combined together, they had around seven on their side. If the Yang Clan was included, and Emperor Li and First God were excluded, they would have no need to fear the Destiny Realm experts of the End World!

Erya nodded and gazed at Emperor Li. At this moment, the latter had an extremely fearful expression on his face!

He knew a little about Erya’s background. She was an existence who even Destiny hadn’t dared to look down upon!

During that era, there were truly a pitiable few capable of making Destiny dare not look down on them!

Erya stretched out her hand, and then a huge axe appeared in her grasp!

The Desolate Axe!

The old man with the bamboo chest had given it to her. But since she started absorbing the inner core fragments, she rarely fought, and so the axe was rarely used!

Erya walked slowly in Emperor Li’s direction. She gazed at him, and then suddenly hurled the axe at him.

Hiss!

Space was instantly torn into bits!

Emperor Li’s pupils constricted. He squatted halfway down, stomped his left foot against the ground and kicked forward with his left leg.

Bam!

The space before him collapsed!

Boom!

But just a moment later, he was blasted over 10km away. As soon as he stopped himself, the ground beneath him instantly collapsed. Meanwhile, Emperor Li’s entire right leg was shaking while blood dripped from it!

Terrifying strength!𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Emperor Li’s countenance was quite pale as he gazed at Erya. Her strength had far surpassed his expectations!

After she blasted Emperor Li back, Erya gazed at First God. The latter’s expression changed drastically, and he immediately retreated by 300m and created distance between them.

Erya grunted coldly and hurled her axe at him.

The axe tore through the air and slammed down at him!

At this moment, First God had turned slightly pale.

He could sense the energy it carried! It was unprecedentedly powerful! It wasn’t the strength of a person… No, the one before him was no person!

Such strength was truly capable of splitting the world!

First God had nowhere to retreat and could only go head-on against it. Because Erya’s attack covered the entire area, so it would be worse for him if he tried to retreat instead!

First God stretched his right hand forward and twisted it. In an instant, the space before him transformed into a huge vortex, and within the vortex were strands of terrifying energy that surged out like an erupting volcano.

However, along with the arrival of the axe, the huge vortex instantly collapsed, and First God was blasted away.

He was blasted over 30km away.

Bang!

First God crashed to the ground, causing it to quake. Fortunately, he’d landed on his feet, not his body.

However, First God didn’t seem to be in very good shape. His hands had cracked open, and blood was seeping out incessantly from his arms. It was an extremely shocking sight!

“We can’t go head-on against her!” Meanwhile, Emperor Li appeared beside First God. He stared at Erya with a solemn and fearful expression in his eyes!

Even now, he still sensed lingering fear from her previous attack. Luckily, he hadn’t underestimated her. If he had, he would have truly suffered just now!

Suddenly, started running in First God and Emperor Li’s direction. She wasn’t very fast, but space was blasted open in her wake… The space here was fragile like paper before her!

Emperor Li and First God’s expressions changed drastically from the sight of this, but it didn’t take long for their faces to return to normal.

Suddenly, a pitch black hand appeared near Erya. Erya didn’t hesitate to hurl her axe at it!

The pitch black hand was suddenly clenched and punched forward!

Bang!

The Desolate Axe collapsed before this punch!

Erya stopped, gazed at the pieces of the axe, and was stunned for a moment. After that, fury burned within her, and she leaped up and roared angrily at the black fist, “I’ll blast you apart!”

As soon as she said that, she slammed her head against it!

The pitch black fist slammed right against the pair of horns on her head.

Bang!

Erya was instantly blasted away!

However, the hand instantly cracked open. At the same time, it turned slightly ethereal.

Erya rolled over 1km on the ground before slowly crawling to her feet. She looked up at the black hand, and then her eyes instantly turned scarlet red. A moment later, blood red flames appeared around her.

Meanwhile, a sword appeared in the pitch black hand.

The sword was completely pitch black, hiltless, and over a meter in length.

There were two characters inscribed on it, “葬命”.

Burial!
