Chapter 1763 - The Ruthless One Wins!

The targets were Su Qingshi and the others!

Even though Yang Ye’s face was very calm right now, Yang Lianshuang sensed a strand of ghastly coldness.

She remained silent for a moment and said, “They won’t put a bounty on us. Because besides 6th stage True Realm experts, no one else would dare to try and kill us. Even 6th stage True Realm experts wouldn’t dare to try and kill us. Moreover, they wouldn’t be able to afford rewards that 6th stage True Realm experts desire!”

She paused for a moment and continued, “So, they can only target your wives and loved ones. Because they are comparatively weaker and easier to kill. Moreover, I’m sure you’re aware that your wives and loved ones are your weak spot. Instead of looking for trouble with you, it’s easier to target them. Because if they target your wives and loved ones, they will have the initiative; but if they tried to target you, they wouldn’t even be able to find you!”

Yang Ye naturally understood all of that.

Even though the five clans’ bounty was on Su Qingshi and the others, the final target was still him. However, it was in a roundabout manner. After all, it was clearly utterly pointless to place a bounty on him.

Based on his current reputation, no one would try to kill him even if they multiplied the rewards by ten. What a joke! Only someone absolutely stupid would try to kill Yang Ye. While the rewards were great, being alive was better!

However, Su Qingshi and the others were different. Because they were much weaker and easier to kill.

Most importantly, doing that could keep Yang Ye busy and stop Yang Ye from attacking them!

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang said, “The bounty isn’t just on your wives and loved ones, it’s on some of the core figures of our clan too. All the True Realm experts of our clan are included. They’re providing substantial rewards for killing any one of them!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why aren’t they just forming an army and attacking us?”

“They will!” Yang Lianshuang spoke indifferently, “But it isn’t time yet. There are many reasons for that. It’s mainly because they aren’t able to truly trust each other yet. All of them are afraid of being stabbed in the back. Besides that, there’s the Ku Clan, Wu Clan, and a place that all the clans fear!”

Yang Ye asked, “What place?”

“Moment Mountain!” Yang Lianshuang spoke solemnly, “It’s too mysterious. They dare not exhaust too much of their strength or engage in large-scale war without finding out what that existence there is planning. Everyone is afraid that someone else would take advantage of the situation!”

Yang Ye said, “But they’ll attack Heaven Void Continent, sooner or later, right?”

Yang Lianshuang nodded, “So, we don’t have much time left. Moreover, our strength isn’t sufficient to fight the joint forces of the five clans. So, we must get help!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “That isn’t very realistic!”

Their choices for help were none other than the Wu Clan and Ku Clan. But would the Wu Clan and Ku Clan help them? It was clearly unlikely. Actually, it wasn’t just unlikely but impossible!

So, both of them fell silent.

A long time passed before Yang Ye spoke abruptly, “I have an extreme idea!”

She gazed at him, “Let me hear it!”

Yang Ye replied, “Let’s abandon Heaven Void Continent.”

She frowned, “What do you mean?”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Heaven Void Continent is our base camp, but it’s also a shackle for us. Because regardless of what we do, we’ll return to Heaven Void Continent in the end. However, once we abandon it, we won’t be tied down anymore. At that time, we’ll be in the shadows. Once we’re in the shadows, I believe that the Ying Clan and those other clans won’t be able to sleep well!”

Yang Lianshuang fell silent.

What Yang Ye said made absolute sense. Once they abandoned Heaven Void Continent, all the experts of the Yang Clan and even the both of them would be hidden in the shadows. Especially both Yang Ye and her. If they started assassinating the experts of the five clans, then even the Ying Clan wouldn’t be able to sleep well!

However, Heaven Void Continent was the home of everyone in the Yang Clan, so abandoning it was…

Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “We won’t be able to defend Heaven Void Continent. Even if we can, it’ll probably be severely damaged. Not only will the continent be severely damaged; our Yang Clan would have suffered severe losses as well. So, isn’t it better to just abandon the continent?”

Yang Lianshuang spoke solemnly, “Guerilla warfare!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Guerilla warfare?”

She glanced at him and explained, “A strategy that an extremely formidable person invented. Avoid direct confrontations and just hit-and-run!”

Yang Ye nodded, “That’s what I was thinking. So, what do you think?”

Yang Lianshuang shook her head, “No!”

Yang Ye was bewildered, “Why?”

She replied, “Firstly, we aren’t able to evacuate everyone from Heaven Void Continent without anyone noticing, and even if we try, we’ll only be able to take True Realm and Zenith Realm experts with us. Just think about it, if we do take those experts with us, then what will the others do? The Ying Clan and those other clans won’t spare any of us. Once they’re unable to find us, they’ll aim their blades at the ordinary people of our clan or use those people to force us to show ourselves!”

She paused for a moment and continued, “Besides possessing experts at the highest levels of strength, the people at the lower levels are important to a clan as well. Because they are the foundation. If we abandon them, it’s equivalent to destroying our foundation!”

Yang Ye asked, “Do you have any other ideas?”

She shook her head slightly, “Not for now!”

Silence filled the surroundings again.

A short while passed before Yang Ye said, “I have another extreme idea!”

She glanced at him, “Why are they all extreme ideas?”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “It can’t be helped. Only extreme ideas work in our current situation.”

Yang Lianshuang said, “Tell me about it!”

Yang Ye nodded. He glanced at the surroundings and started explaining.

Around 15 minutes passed before Yang Lianshuang spoke solemnly, “You’re trying to compete and see who’s more ruthless!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I am. The ruthless wins. If they’re more ruthless, they win; if we’re more ruthless, we win!”

Yang Lianshuang fell silent for a long time, “Alright!”

Yang Ye said, “Then it’s decided.”

Yang Lianshuang nodded slightly. She was about to say something when both Yang Ye and her expressions changed slightly. A moment later, they gazed towards the left. The space there trembled, and then a violet robed old man appeared before them.

A wisp of surprise flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes because he recognized the old man. It was the old man from Sword Immortal City.

The old man glanced at them, and then his gaze stopped on Yang Ye, “Young Master Yang, my young miss requests your presence!”

His young miss? Yang Ye frowned, “What does she want?”

The old man replied, “You’ll know once you meet her!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and gazed at Yang Lianshuang, “You head back first. I’ll go to Sword Immortal City.”

Yang Lianshuang glanced at the old man, “It’s not dangerous, right?”

The old man laughed bitterly, “Young Miss Lianshuang, you must be kidding. Based on Young Master Yang’s current strength, even 6th stage True Realm experts won’t be able to kill him!”

Yang Lianshuang gazed at Yang Ye, “Be careful!”

She vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye gazed at the old man, “Let’s go!”

The old man nodded slightly, and then he transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

Two hours later, Yang Ye and the old man arrived at Sword Immortal City.

The Grand Immortal Pavilion. The fourth floor.

The mysterious woman chuckled behind the screen, “Long time no see. Young Master Yang, you’ve grown stronger again!”

Yang Ye replied, “Be frank if you have something to say. I’m a little busy!”

She fell silent for a moment, and then she said, “I remember that you owe me a favor, right?”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched, That favor…

The mysterious woman said, “I need your help with something.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and replied, “What is it?”

The mysterious woman explained, “I want to go somewhere, but it’s a little dangerous. So I want someone to go with me.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Can you take someone else?”

She replied, “Young Master Yang, you don’t want to return the favor?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “You’re definitely not weak, yet even you think it’s really dangerous. I think that I may not return alive if I go with you!”

The mysterious woman smiled, “Actually, if you knew something, you’ll definitely go even if I don’t say anything.”

Yang Ye frowned, “What is it?”

She replied, “I heard you have a very good relationship with the members of the Nether Pavilion.”

Yang Ye suddenly stood up and gazed at the screen for a long time, “You know about the Nether Pavilion! Who are you?!”

“Don’t be surprised!” She continued, “Because I’m from the Nether Pavilion too!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly when he heard her, “You’re from the Nether Pavilion too?”

“Surprised?” She smiled, “I was, but not anymore.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She explained, “It’s a long story, so I won’t go into detail. You just have to know that those friends of yours from the Nether Pavilion are heading to that place right now, and that place is very dangerous. I believe that you won’t stand by idly when your friends are in danger, right?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time before he asked, “Where have they gone?”

She replied, “Heaven Pillar Mountain!”

Yang Ye frowned and asked, “What’s that?”

The mysterious woman fell silent for a long time before she replied, “The place where Pavilion Master Siyou vanished all those years ago.”

Shao Siyou!

The previous pavilion master of the Nether Pavilion!
