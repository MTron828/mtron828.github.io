Chapter 1864 – Night Emperor! Get The Fuck Out Here!

Along with a sword howl, a ray of sword energy arrived before Xiao Hanyi.

Xiao Hanyi remained calm as he stretched his right hand forward, and he leaped forward as he swung his spear.

The glow of lightning flickered along with his spear.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword energy arrived.

Boom!

A deafening explosion resounded, and Xiao Hanyi was blasted over 3km back. He hadn’t even stopped himself when another ray of sword energy arrived before him.

Bang!

Xiao Hanyi was blasted away again.

Xiao Hanyi had just stopped himself around 10km away when another ray of sword energy arrived. A fierce expression covered his face when he saw the sword energy, and then his spear suddenly started to spin rapidly.

Bang!

Suddenly, countless energy spears flashed out from Xiao Hanyi’s spear. It only took a moment for them to envelop Yang Ye’s sword energy.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Explosions resounded incessantly, and Yang Ye was blasted away with his sword energy.

Once he stopped himself, Yang Ye glanced at his chest. At this moment, there was a mark on his chest. However, it hadn’t pierced through his skin, and it had merely left a faint mark.

Suddenly, Xiao Hanyi walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, “I didn’t expect you to get so strong in such a short while!”

Yang Ye looked up at Xiao Hanyi. He didn’t waste his breath and was about to attack. However, Xiao Hanyi’s spear suddenly became ethereal, and then it transformed into a ray of silver light that overlapped with him!

He’s fusing with his spear? Yang Ye frowned.

Suddenly, Xiao Hanyi transformed into a ray of silver light that vanished on the spot. Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically at the exact same moment, and then he swapped the Sword Precursor for the golden sword.

“Slash!” As soon as Yang Ye spoke, he swung his sword with both hands.

The stars shook and countless rays of starlight converged into his sword. Moreover, Yang Ye felt the energy of the earth surging madly into his sword.

Hiss!

The silver light Xiao Hanyi transformed into was instantly sliced open, and then a figure was blasted over 30km away.

It was Xiao Hanyi’s figure.

Yang Ye put his sword away and returned to normal.

Yang Ye glanced at Xiao Hanyi, and then he turned around and walked away.

Xiao Hanyi had quite a blank expression in his eyes as he watched Yang Ye leave, and he spoke softly, “Greed… really is the bane of man.”

As soon as he finished speaking, his body turned ethereal, and then it vanished on the spot.

Once he dealt with Xiao Hanyi, Yang Ye used Heaven’s Net to find another person who’d chased after him that day—Gu Huan.

A deathly silent mountain range.

Om!

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded, and then a ray of sword energy shot into the mountain.

Yang Ye passed through a dense forest and arrived below a waterfall. The waterfall was almost 10km tall and water surged down incessantly from it. In the end, all the water entered the pool below and caused water to splash towards the surroundings.

There was a bamboo house by the pool.

Suddenly, a ray of sword energy descended towards the bamboo house.

Boom!

The house shattered, and a man walked out from within it. The man was Gu Huan, and a man in green clothes was standing around 1km away from him.

It was Yang Ye, of course.

Gu Huan gazed at Yang Ye, “If I’m not wrong, those experts who vanished recently were killed by you, right?”

Yang Ye replied, “Don’t worry, you’ll be with them soon!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye was about to attack. However, Gu Huan suddenly said, “I have a piece of information that may be worth my life!”

However, Yang Ye still swung his sword.

Om!

A ray of light flashed. Gu Huan’s expression changed drastically. He waved his hands, and countless black cards shot towards Yang Ye like boomerangs. However, they were obliterated before they could even touch Yang Ye’s sword energy.

Boom!

An instant later, Gu Huan was blasted backwards and slammed against the mountain behind him, and then the entire mountain trembled violently.

Yang Ye was about to attack when Gu Huan suddenly said, “It’s related to that second sister of yours!”

Yang Ye immediately stopped when he heard this, and then he stared at Gu Huan, “What do you mean?!”

Gu Huan glanced at Yang Ye while fear filled his eyes. He hadn’t expected that Yang Ye would become so strong after such a short period.

“Hmm?” Suddenly, Yang Ye’s sword started to tremble.

Gu Huan’s expression changed at the sight of this, and he hurriedly said, “I know the Night Emperor because he came to ask for an extraordinary healing treasure, the Bitter Fruit. I…”

Yang Ye said, “Get to the point!”

Gu Huan glanced at Yang Ye and said, “He wanted to use a treasure to make the exchange with me, but I refused. That treasure was a pearl of quintessential blood essence!”

Blood essence! Yang Ye’s breathing started to quicken, “What do you mean?”

Gu Huan heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Yang Ye’s reaction, and he explained, “That pearl of blood was formed via cultivation by a woman, and it contains her consciousness and a few strands of her soul… Simply speaking, if she chances upon a great fortuitous encounter, then she can be revived.”

She can be revived! Yang Ye took a deep breath, and his hands were trembling.

Meanwhile, Gu Huan seemed to want to say something, but Yang Ye suddenly gazed at him, causing Gu Huan’s expression to change slightly while his profound energy started to surge.

Yang Ye asked, “You’re not lying to me, right?”

Gu Huan shook his head slightly, “I’m willing to suffer the wrath of the heavens if I lied to you!”

Yang Ye didn’t say a word and just vanished into the sky.

Gu Huan finally relaxed. The reason he’d chosen not to fight was because he knew that Xiao Hanyi was dead. His strength was on par with Xiao Hanyi, but Xiao Hanyi was dead. So, he naturally wasn’t a match for Yang Ye. Thus, he’d decisively chosen to seek peace!

Of course, he was clearly aware that the only reason he could seek peace with Yang Ye was because he knew about that!

Gu Huan looked up at the sky and said, “Night Emperor… Good luck!”

…

After he found out that Blood Maiden could be revived, Yang Ye stopped killing others and went straight for Night Assassin City.

“Night Emperor! Get the fuck out here!” Suddenly, a voice resounded through the sky above the city.

Countless people were shocked, and they looked out of the city. Suddenly, a ray of light flashed down from far away in the sky. IN the end, it slammed against the city gates.

Boom!

The city gates exploded into bits!

Yang Ye!

After vanishing for over a month, Yang Ye had appeared before them again. It didn’t take long for countless experts throughout Heaven Pillar Mountain to be alarmed by this, and they rushed to Night Assassin City. However, no one dared to attack now.

Because the sword Yang Ye held was a golden sword.

The might of that divine sword was something all of them had witnessed that day. Even if they hadn’t witnessed it, they’d heard of it.

Along with the collapse of the city gates, over a dozen black robed figures appeared before Yang Ye. They were led by an old man, and the old man was a Quasi Enlightened Realm expert. The old man was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly drew his sword and swung it.

Om!

A sword howl resounded, and then a golden ray of sword energy flashed.

It was swift! Swift to the limit! And it was impossible to detect with the eye!

The old man was shocked and furious when he saw Yang Ye attack without saying a word. The old man didn’t dare act carelessly, and he stomped his right foot against the ground. In an instant, the sky shook violently, and then a powerful aura swept out from the old man. It didn’t take long for the aura to slam against Yang Ye’s sword energy.

Boom!

A rumbling explosion resounded as the old man was blasted backwards, and he only stopped himself after being pushed 30km back.

At this moment, the experts hiding in the shadows were astounded. Obviously, they hadn’t expected Yang Ye to have become so strong.

The old man was extremely shocked as well. He similarly hadn’t expected Yang Ye’s strength to have arrived at such a level. After all, Yang Ye had carried out assassinations when he came to Night Assassin City that day, and he hadn’t dared to fight them openly.

Yet now, Yang Ye had come here openly!

Yang Ye didn’t launch another attack. He just glanced at the surroundings and said, “Night Emperor! Get the fuck out here!”

He flipped his palm once he finished speaking, and the holy sword flashed.

Hiss!

Everywhere it passed, all buildings were obliterated, and a bottomless rift had appeared in the ground, stretching all the way to the ends of everyone’s vision.

Traces of fear appeared in the eyes of countless when they witnessed this!

The old man’s expression had changed as well. Yang Ye was much stronger than he’d imagined!

An outstanding genius!

Suddenly, Yang Ye gazed at the old man and spoke fiercely, “Three breaths of time. If the Night Emperor doesn’t show himself within three breaths of time, then I’ll slaughter everyone in the entire city!”

Slaughter everyone!
