Chapter 134 – Self Detonation

“The sword techniques of the Sword Sect are nothing great!” Xu Yan gently wiped off the remnants of fresh blood on his sword with his finger as he gazed at Dong Wushang that stood before him and spoke indifferently.

Dong Wushang gazed at Zhao Hanyue but saw that she was steadily losing ground before Ghostarm. He immediately took a deep breath while a wisp of a resolute expression flashed in his eyes. After that, the profound energy within his body surged madly while his stomach gradually grew larger and larger....

Xu Yan’s eyelids twitched when he saw this scene, and he cried out involuntarily. “Self-detonation! You actually intend to detonate yourself! Dong Wushang, you’re crazy!”

As he spoke, Xu Yan retreated explosively.

At this moment, Zhao Hanyue and Ghostarm had stopped fighting as well. Both of their expressions changed violently when they noticed Dong Wushang’s stomach that was gradually growing, and then they retreated swiftly just like Xu Yan had.

“Open up the barrier! Quickly open up the barrier!” When he retreated to the border of the barrier, Ghostarm cried out madly to Xu Yan.

At this moment, Xu Yan’s expression was extremely unsightly. He wanted to open the barrier up as well, but how could the barrier be opened on a whim? He paid no further attention to Ghostarm, and with a flip of his right hand, an enormous shield that was covered in ice crystals appeared before him. At the same time, he hurriedly activated his Profound Energy Barrier. Moreover, he seemed to feel that it was insufficient, and he wore a piece of armor as well.

Zhao Hanyue wasn’t any slower, and she took out all the defensive treasures she possessed.

When he saw both of them withdraw their treasures, Ghostarm seemed to know that it was impossible to open up the barrier. He immediately didn’t hesitate to wave his right hand, and he wore a piece of skin armor that seemed like the skin of a person.

“It’s too late. Everything’s too late. Let us all die together!” As he gazed at the three of them, Dong Wushang had a savage expression, and he roared madly with laughter.

Actually, he didn’t want to detonate himself as well. However, he had no other choice. He would definitely die if the battle continued. Moreover, the Ghost Sect possessed a secret technique that was capable of restraining one’s soul. So, if he died, then Ghostarm would definitely execute that secret technique to take control of his soul. At that time, living would really be worse than death for him. No, he would fall to eternal damnation!

So, he’d chosen to detonate himself and drag them down with him!

Right at the instant Dong Wushang had chosen to detonate himself, Qin Xiyue’s expression had changed as well, and then she didn’t even give it any thought before putting Yang Ye along as she retreated. Moreover, she only stopped after they were almost 200m away from the chamber.

“Is the self-detonation of a King Realm expert that terrifying?” asked Yang Ye while he gazed at Qin Xiyue who was slightly pale.

Bang!

Qin Xiyue was just about to speak. Right at this moment, a world shocking bang had suddenly resounded from afar, and then the surroundings shook as if it was an earthquake.

Yang Ye was just about to speak, however, right at this moment, a wave of air suddenly surged over from the passageway. Yang Ye’s expression changed while his Sword Intent surged out to resist the wave of air.

Bang!

A muffled bang resounded as the wave of air dispersed into the surroundings. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“You understand how terrifying it is now?” asked Qin Xiyue in a low voice.

Yang Ye nodded with agreement. Even when they were so far apart, the aftershock created by the explosion was still able to affect this area. This clearly showed how terrifying the explosion within the chamber was! At the same time, Yang Ye decided in his heart that he would absolutely not give his opponents any opportunity. Just like moments before, if Xu Yan didn’t waste his breath and directly struck to kill, then how could Dong Wushang have detonated himself?

“If your opponent detonates himself in battle, then even if that opponent is merely a First Heaven Realm Profounder, you still have to leave immediately. Understand?” Qin Xiyue gazed at Yang Ye while she spoke seriously.

Yang Ye’s heart felt warm when he heard this, and then he smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I’m not a conceited person! Right, why hasn’t this place been destroyed from the explosion created by Dong Wushang?”

Qin Xiyue glanced at the surroundings before she said, “If I’m not wrong, then some sort of strange energy is present here. But I’m unable to find out exactly what it is. Perhaps that woman you’re bringing along with you might know the answer. Why don’t you ask her?”

“Ask her?” Yang Ye was stunned, and then he shook his head and said, “Forget it. It’s enough if she just stays in there obediently. Right, why have you never asked exactly where she is?”

He didn’t believe that Qin Xiyue wasn’t curious about the secrets he held, so since she was curious, why didn’t she ask about it?

“Everyone has their own secrets, right?” said Qin Xiyue in a flat tone.

Yang Ye nodded and said with a smile, “Collaborating with someone smart really is nice!”

Qin Xiyue glanced at Yang Ye before she said, “Now, let’s go deal with those fellows!”

Yang Ye said with astonishment, “They are still alive?”

“Never underestimate an expert at the King Realm!” Qin Xiyue gazed at Yang Ye and said seriously, “I know your strength is extremely formidable, and you possess the strength to surmount your realm of cultivation to do battle. However, you must remember to never underestimate any expert at the King Realm. Actually, I should say that you shouldn’t underestimate any opponent of yours. Many people in this world have died because of their carelessness and underestimating their opponents!”

Yang Ye stretched out his hand and waved it before Qin Xiyue, and then he said with a smile, “Why have you suddenly started to show so much concern towards me? Don’t tell me that you really like me.”

“Can I not?” After she finished speaking these words, Qin Xiyue turned around and walked towards that chamber from before.

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he shook his head and smiled. After that, he hurriedly followed her as well.

When the two of them returned to the chamber once more and saw the scene there, Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. Because Ghostarm, Xu Yan, and Zhao Hanyue were really still alive, but they were clearly not in a good state.

The enormous shield before Xu Yan had shattered into a pile of fragments while the clothes he wore were tattered, causing the bloodied skin beneath them to be revealed. As for those three others that were following by Xu Yan’s side, they’d been transformed into a pile of body pieces.

On the other hand, Ghostarm’s black robe was gone, causing his ghastly pale face to be revealed. Especially his hands, they had already transformed from pure white into scarlet red....

The most striking amongst them was Zhao Hanyue. At this moment, only her undergarments still remained, and it wasn’t even whole. One of her peaks were freely exposed in the air while her skirt was in rags as well, causing large amounts of enchanting scenes to be revealed....

When he saw them in such a sorry state, a wisp of cold light flashed in the eyes of Yang Ye who hid in a corner, and he was about to make a move.

Qin Xiyue pulled on his hand before she shook her head, and then she said softly. “Wait a while. Conflict will definitely arise between the three of them, so there’s no harm in us watching for now!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment before he nodded.

In the battlefield, Xu Yan withdrew a talisman and slapped it on himself. After a short while, he opened his eyes, and then he looked at Ghostarm. The latter opened his eyes as well and then nodded lightly.

“If both of you are unafraid of experiencing the detonation of one more King Realm Profounder, then feel free to make a move against me!” Right at this moment, Zhao Hanyue opened her eyes and spoke coldly to Ghostarm and Xu Yan.

Both their eyelids twitched when they heard this. Even though they’d survived, both of them had suffered heavy injuries. They were still able to join forces and kill Zhao Hanyue, but if she really chose to detonate herself, then both of them would really be in trouble.

“Don’t think that I’m not capable of it!” Zhao Hanyue spoke once more in a cold voice. “Instead of falling into Ghostarm’s hands, it would be better to detonate myself and take both of you to hell with me. What do both of you think?”

“Ha!” Meanwhile, Xu Yan chuckled and said, “Fairy Zhao, you must be joking. I’ve already said so just now, I don’t have any ill intent towards Fairy Zhao. So long as you agree to keep everything that occurred today a secret, then you can leave at any time!”

“Xu Yan....” Ghostarm spoke in a low voice. “In the world, only one that has truly perished can keep a secret. If she speaks of everything that occurred here once she leaves, then I presume the members of the Sword Sect will definitely not let the matter rest. It doesn’t matter to me because it’s fully justified for a member of my Ghost Sect to kill members of the Sword Sect. Moreover, not only would I not be punished by my sect, I would even be rewarded instead. But what about you? Would your Origin School reward you?”

“Fairy Zhao will keep the secret, right?” Xu Yan gazed at Zhao Hanyue as he spoke with a smile on his face.

Zhao Hanyue smiled as she said, “Of course.”

“Xu....” Ghostarm still intended to say something.

Xu Yan gazed at Ghostarm and interrupted him with a cold tone. “Can you endure another explosion?”

Ghostarm was speechless when he heard this.

Zhao Hanyue laughed coldly, and then she said, “You can open the barrier up now, right?”

“Of course!” Xu Yan smiled, and then he said, “But even you’ve noticed that the other disciples of my sect have perished. So, we have to work together in order to open this Barrier Ward. Otherwise, we can only wait for two hours when the Barrier Ward will be lifted automatically! What do you think?”

Zhao Hanyue glanced at the disciples of the Origin School that had been reduced to pieces, and then she said, “I hope you don’t play any tricks!”

“Of course!” said Xu Yan with a smile on his face.

“What do I have to do!?” said Zhao Hanyue.
