Chapter 2102 – The Sword Supreme’s Spirit!

They had lost countless Sages, and they naturally had to get their vengeance.

However, the god race had vanished.

Thus, they aimed their sights on Yang Ye.

Needless to say, Yang Ye felt quite aggrieved. However, he couldn’t do anything about it. Just as Yang Lianshuang had said, he really couldn’t return to the large universe because his current strength was truly insufficient to fight them.

Fortunately, he could stay in the Void Dimension and cultivate here for some time.

His battles with Li You from the Confucianist Path and that other Sage had allowed him to realize many things he was lacking. He had huge room to improve in many aspects, and he planned to work hard on it.

Especially his Sword Dao!

His best sword techniques were Sword Fusion and Burial. If he used them together, they would be even stronger. However, it wasn’t a huge threat to Sages, even if he supported them with the Sword Domain.

It was quite useless against Sages.

Now, only the Sky Dragon and Elysium could pose a threat to Sages. While it wasn’t a bad thing for Yang Ye, it represented that his Sword Dao was weak.

Strengthen the Sword Dao!

There were two ways to strengthen his Sword Dao. Firstly, by strengthening his sword techniques. Secondly, it was by improving his attainments in the Sword Dao. It was an improvement at the foundation of his Sword Dao. If his Sword Dao improved, his sword techniques would naturally improve as well. However, the second method was much more difficult.

His current attainments in the Sword Dao were at a bottleneck, and it was impossible to take a step further in a short period.

Based on the current situation, he could only choose to improve his sword techniques.

Fortunately, he’d studied thousands of sword techniques, so while he wasn’t exceptionally skilled in them, he understood them. Coupled with his own ideas, it wasn’t that difficult to improve his sword techniques, and it was only a matter of time.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged with his eyes closed.

Yang Ye was reflecting, reflecting on his sword techniques. He was trying to determine what they lacked. Especially during the battle with Li You and that Sage, in both battles, his sword hadn’t been able to pose a material threat to them!

Actually, what the people of old said was correct. Battle did help a person grow with ease. After reflecting on the battles, Yang Ye noticed many things his techniques were lacking, and the first thing was speed!

He'd felt that his sword was fast enough! However, after he fought that Sage and a genius like Li You, he realized it was far from enough. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

It had to be improved!

As far as Yang Ye was concerned, he had to improve the speed of his sword. Of course, the strength of his techniques had to be improved too. There was no other way to accomplish it but by training, training over and over again!

Yang Ye wasn’t in a rush to gain success. He knew that it wasn’t something he could complete in just a short while.

Just like that, time trickled by.

One day, Snowy suddenly went over to Yang Ye with a sword in her arms.

She pointed at the sword, and then started waving her paw while excitement covered her chubby little face.

It was the Sword Supreme that she was holding!

However, Yang Ye didn’t really understand what she meant. Because Snowy was using a single paw to communicate with him.

Yang Ye rubbed her head and smiled, “Calm down and tell me slowly.”

Snowy made the sword float in the air, and then he started waving both paws.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye’s face to gradually become solemn, “You said that it spoke to you?”

Snowy hurriedly nodded!

Yang Ye was stunned.

Its Sword Spirit is awake? Yang Ye gazed at the sword and took it in his grasp. However, he didn’t sense its spirit, and he only sensed a faint fluctuation coming from it. It was like the fluctuation of a soul. Yang Ye gazed at Snowy. Is she hallucinating?

Snowy blinked, and then she looked down at the sword. A moment later, she placed it by her ear, and then her eyes lit up. She looked up at Yang Ye and pointed at the sword. She was telling him that it was really speaking to her.

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Yang Ye glanced at Snowy, and then looked down at the sword. However, he still didn’t sense anything. Suddenly, Tian Xiu said, “Big Brother, what if Snowy’s the only one able to hear it?”

Yang Ye gazed at Snowy. Snowy had a very serious expression on her face to display that she wasn’t lying.

A short while passed before Yang Ye asked, “What did it say to you?”

Snowy knocked the sword lightly with her claw, and then she placed it by her ear. A short while later, Snowy started waving her paws about.

A short while later, Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “It wants to go somewhere?”

Snowy nodded.

“Why?” Yang Ye asked, “Ask it why it wants to go there!”

Snowy started communicating with the Sword Supreme again.

After some time of back and forth, Yang Ye finally understood what it wanted.

The Sword Supreme had recovered slightly, but it hadn’t fully recovered. It was still very weak, so weak that it could only communicate with Snowy. The reason it could communicate with Snowy was mainly because Snowy was a Sprite Lord, and one that had evolved. After evolving, Snowy had improved greatly in every aspect, especially her senses. Her senses towards beings with a spirit was much, much stronger than before.

That was the main reason why she could sense the Sword Spirit!

The Sword Spirit wanted him to go to a place called the Sword Ruins. As for why, it hadn’t been able to explain before it fell into deep sleep again.

It was weak!

The Sword Spirit was extremely weak, it was so weak that it could only stay awake for less than ten minutes at a time, and it had to fall back into deep sleep after that. As for when it would wake up again, Snowy didn’t know, and Yang Ye had no idea.

Snowy waved her paws lightly in front of Yang Ye. She was asking if he would be going.

Yang Ye gazed at the sword for a long time and smiled, “We have to!”

The Sword Supreme had helped him tremendously since it arrived by his side. Even if it wouldn’t choose him after it awoke, he would still help it. No matter what, since he could help it, he intended to help. Of course, he hoped that it would still stay with him. It was something he’d never concealed, and he wouldn’t act like a hypocrite and say that it didn’t matter if the Sword Supreme stayed or not.

It did matter, it really did!

It was the Sword Supreme, the number one sword of the large universe! If its Sword Spirit recovered, then could anyone below the Progenitor Realm fight him? Just thinking about it filled him with excitement!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and spoke softly, “The Sword Ruins!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment, but he didn’t set out immediately. He sent a voice transmission to Yang Lianshuang instead and asked her to investigate the Sword Ruins for him. It took her an entire day to complete this investigation.

Yang Lianshuang said, “I couldn’t find much about it. All I do know is that it’s where the Sword Supreme was born.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “It’s where the Sword Supreme was born?”

Yang Lianshuang replied, “It’s where those progenitors joined forces to forge it. It’s a very mysterious place. After the Sword Supreme was born, it was sealed for some reason. Besides those few progenitors, no one knows where it is. Of course, the Sword Supreme is definitely aware of its location.”

The Sword Supreme’s place of birth!

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Is it dangerous?”

“How would I know?” Yang Lianshuang spoke angrily, “I’ve never been there. However, according to my inference, it’s definitely not an ordinary place. You must be careful if you plan to go. Besides that, don’t forget that the other races have issued a bounty for you, so don’t let yourself get stuck in an endless wave of enemies.”

All the races!

Yang Ye suddenly thought of this. They’d placed a bounty on him, and it was probably not difficult for them to find him.

Yang Ye withdrew the Bodhi Leaf, and half of it had turned yellow.

Yang Ye’s face fell from the sight of this. Obviously, some experts were using some sort of method to locate him, and it was hastening the rate the Bodhi Tree leaf was turning yellow. If this continued, his location would be completely exposed once the leaf turned completely yellow.

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang added, “Anyway, be careful. I’ll pay attention to the movements of all the races, and I’ll tell you as soon as I get any information!”

Yang Ye nodded, “You should be careful too. They’ve formed an alliance now, so you must be careful. All of you’ll be in even more danger if you’re exposed!”

“I know!” Yang Lianshuang continued, “Presently, we’ve started to reduce our scope of activity, and we’ve even given up some of our outposts in the outskirts of our territory. Right, since the Sword Supreme asked you to go to the Sword Ruins, it should be able to help the Sword Supreme recover. I suggest that you go immediately. Because if it recovers, then can anyone besides the progenitors harm you?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. The problem was whether it would be willing to stay after it recovered!

However, Yang Lianshuang was right. It was a form of hope for him. If it really refused to stay with him, that was fine too, he would follow it instead! He never cared about face, all he cared about was survival!

Suddenly, Yang Lianshuang said, “You’ve got some trouble!”

Yang Ye asked, “What?”

She spoke solemnly, “I just received news that the experts of all the races are on the way to the Void Dimension. Your location has been exposed.”

Yang Ye grunted coldly, “Very good. I was just feeling like killing someone!”

She replied, “At least three Sages, maybe more!”

Yang Ye’s face froze. He hesitated for a moment and said, “I’m in a good mood today, so I don’t feel like killing now. I’ll kill another day!”
