Chapter 1694 - You’ve Gone Mad!

Seven True Realm experts and 15 Half-Step True Realm experts!

Yang Ye’s face was absolutely gloomy. Because these forces were entirely capable of crushing them.

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Ye gazed at Qiong Qi, “What’s the maximum you can take?”

Qiong Qi gazed at Yang Ye, “How many do you think I can fight?!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “How about you take five? I’ll give you the opportunity to kill five!”

The corners of Qiong Qi’s eyes twitched. He gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “I underestimated how shameless you are!”

As he spoke, he turned to look at Yang Gu’s group, “I can’t deal with five, but I can keep three busy for you. You deal with the rest.”

Boom!

Once he finished speaking, a terrifying aura suddenly surged out from within him, and then the space here instantly started rippling. After that, Qiong Qi’s body started to grow larger and larger. In less than three breaths of time, his figure was almost 3km tall. His wings were especially huge, and they simply blotted out the sky!

Besides that, numerous sharp spikes had appeared on Qiong Qi’s back, and every single one of them was a few meters long!

Beastform!

Qiong Qi’s divine ability!

The expressions on Yang Gu and the others’ faces had become solemn when they saw Qiong Qi’s Beastform.

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi flapped his wings. In an instant, the space around him warped, and then his figure vanished on the spot and shot towards Yang Gu’s group. The powerful force and extreme speed he possessed caused space to instantly collapse in his wake.

In an instant, the sky turned pitch black.

At this moment, Yang Gu and the others’ expressions grew even more solemn.

An instant later, seven powerful auras appeared in the sky, and they pressed down upon Qiong Qi.

Bang!

The sky instantly trembled violently when Qiong Qi’s aura collided with those seven auras, and then space in a huge area collapsed into a black hole.

Suddenly, Yang Gu was horrified, “Watch out!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a ray of light flashed incessantly within the black hole.

AH!!!

After that, shrill cries resounded abruptly.

Yang Ye had immediately acted when Qiong Qi shattered the space here. Because the strength of his Laws of Darkness would rise tremendously once a black hole had been created, and it was even supplemented by his dual intents and the wooden sword.

So, he would be at his prime!

The shrill cries were still resounding!

“Repair the space here!” Yang Gu’s voice resounded and carried a trace of anxiousness.

It didn’t take long for the seven True Realm experts to jointly repair the space here.

However, five corpses were on the ground.

The five corpses belonged to Half-Step True Realm experts!

Yang Gu’s face instantly turned gloomy. Meanwhile, Qiong Qi shot towards them again.

Yang Gu’s expression changed at the sight of this, and he said, “Yang Shen, you stabilize the space here! The two commanders of the Shadow Guard, both of you keep Yang Ye busy. Yang Mu, you deal with that woman. Don’t hold back and kill her as soon as possible. As for the rest of you, come with me to kill that beast!”

As he spoke, he vanished on the spot.

At the same time, the battlefields had been split.

Since space couldn’t be collapsed, Yang Ye couldn’t kill in an instant. He wouldn’t fear them if it was a one on one battle. Unfortunately, they wouldn’t fight him in single combat at all. The two black clothed True Realm experts instantly appeared in front and behind of him, and then two rays of cold light shot towards his throat and nape.

At the same time, the remaining 10 Half-Step True Realm experts attacked in unison. In just an instant, Yang Ye was surrounded.

Yang Ye’s expression remained calm when facing the attacks, and he just raised his sword and swiftly swung a horizontal attack.

Bang!

The powerful force carried within the wooden sword instantly repulsed both True Realm experts, but Yang Ye’s body shook as well because the strength of those two True Realm experts was too powerful. He’d just repulsed them when 10 old men appeared around him, and then 10 powerful auras slammed down on him.

Boom!

Unyielding Sword Intent swept out from within Yang Ye, and then a ray of light flashed.

He couldn’t kill them in an instant now that there was no black hole for him to utilize. Or, it should be said that he was suppressed as soon as the battle began.

Two True Realm experts and 10 Half-Step True Realm experts! Such a force wasn’t something he could deal with on his own. If he didn’t have the wooden sword to rely on, he probably wouldn’t even be able to fight back. Because the wooden sword crushed everything in its path, so he was barely able to fight them!

Even though Qiong Qi had used his Beastform ability, his opponents were three True Realm experts! So, he couldn’t gain the upper hand. Or it should be said that he was being suppressed as well. However, he was extremely swift and possessed formidable defenses, so he was able to hold on!

Qiong Qi and Yang Ye weren’t the only ones being suppressed in battle. Even An Nanjing was suffering the same fate. Her opponent was Yang Ling, and the dragon seal in his possession was a True Rank treasure. So, she was being suppressed by him. However, Yang Ling wasn’t able to gain the upper hand because her combat instinct was extremely good, causing him to have no chance to injure her!

In short, all three of them were being suppressed in battle.

Moreover, this was the Yang Clan’s territory. So, it was obvious that if this continued, then it would definitely grow more and more disadvantageous for them.

Yang Ye naturally understood that. Unfortunately, he wasn’t able to change anything right now.

Time trickled by. Around an hour later, numerous injuries had appeared on Yang Ye’s body and blood was flowing ceaselessly from his entire body. However, he’d killed five more Half-Step True Realm experts. So, there were only two True Realm experts and five Half-Step True Realm experts besieging him right now!

Even though they were fewer, it wasn’t easy for Yang Ye because he was heavily injured.

Bang!

Suddenly, an explosion resounded, and Yang Ye was blasted over 10km away. As soon as he stopped himself, a trace of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth.

The two True Realm experts were about to attack again when a voice suddenly resounded, “All of you’ve gone a little too far.”

As soon as the voice finished resounding, a middle aged man appeared by Yang Ye’s side.

The two black clothed True Realm experts and the five Half-Step True Realm experts immediately stopped when they saw him.

The man by Yang Ye’s side was the commander of the Yang Clan’s 72 warriors, Yang Zhen!

Once Yang Zhen arrived here, the battles instantly stopped.

Yang Gu gazed at Yang Zhen for a long time and said, “Why cause internal strife in our Yang Clan for him?”

Yang Zhen suddenly pointed at Yang Ye and looked Yang Gu in the eyes, “Is he not a member of the Yang Clan? Is the blood within him not from the Yang Clan?”

Yang Gu fell silent.

Yang Zhen continued, “I know why all of you want him to die. It’s none other than because you’re afraid he’ll take revenge on you. I really understand. After all, weeds should be pulled out by the roots, right?”

He chuckled at this point, “But don’t you feel ashamed? You actually didn’t hesitate to send out seven True Realm experts just to kill a Rebirth Realm cultivator. Everyone will laugh at our clan if news of this spreads.”

Yang Gu looked Yang Zhen in the eyes, “You should be well aware who else wants him dead!”

“Of course I know!” Yang Zhen nodded, “If that person didn’t allow it, how could all of you possibly cause such a commotion?”

Yang Gu asked, “So, do you still intend to stop us?” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Yang Zhen didn’t speak. He turned to look at Yang Ye. Meanwhile Yang Ye said, “You’re the person who saved An Nanjing and me that day, right?”

Yang Zhen didn’t answer Yang Ye. He just gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “You’re very like your father. Not only in appearance. Your characters are quite similar as well. Of course, he isn’t as insane as you.”

Yang Ye remained silent.

Meanwhile, Yang Zhen continued, “I was your father’s subordinate. Of course, he never treated me like one. He once told me that he wanted to make the Yang Clan the number one clan in the medium universe of Milky Way System. Moreover, he wanted to lead the Yang Clan into the large universe. However…”

He shook his head at this point and said, “Unfortunately, something suddenly happened to him, and I’m sure you know the rest.”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Yang Zhen suddenly looked up at the sky, “Did his father wrong the Yang Clan? Did he wrong the Yang Clan? Why is the clan treating both of them like this?!”

There was no reply from the sky!

Meanwhile, Yang Zhen added, “Yang Lin! Yang Gewu! Big Brother was kind to both of you. What? Are you really going to just stand by idly and watch his son die here?”

A long moment of silence ensued before an old man and middle aged man appeared not too far away from Yang Zhen. The old man and middle aged man were the Council of Elders’ leader, Yang Lin, and the guardian of the Yang Clan, Yang Gewu.

Yang Lin shook his head slightly, “Yang Zhen, why do this?”

Yang Zhen looked Yang Lin in the eyes, “Have you really forgotten everything that happened all those years ago?”

Yang Lin fell silent.

Yang Zhen gazed at Yang Gewu, and then he said, “Who saved you when you were almost killed outside the clan?”

Yang Gewu fell silent as well.

Meanwhile, Yang Zhen suddenly started laughing, “I understand. I really do. A change of leader brings a change of heart. Moreover, both of you possess a high position in the Yang Clan, and you’re not just warriors under Big Brother’s command any longer.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “Both of you are still here, but Big Brother is gone, and the relationship we had is gone as well.”

Meanwhile, Yang Lin said, “We won’t act against him, but as for helping him… I’m sorry. If we help him, then the clan will truly fall into internal strife.”

Yang Lin and Yang Gewu vanished on the spot.

Yang Zhen fell silent for an instant, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “Leave! Don’t let the Yang Clan find you!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “I can’t!”

Yang Zhen replied indifferently, “Leave everything else to me! You just leave!”

Yang Ye glanced at Yang Zhen, and then he said, “Thank you!”

As he spoke, Yang Ye and An Nanjing went onto Qiong Qi’s back. Qiong Qi didn’t hesitate to flap his wings, and he instantly transformed into a black pillar of light that shot up into the sky.

Yang Gu and the others were about to chase after them, but Yang Zhen suddenly appeared in front of Yang Gu’s group.

Yang Gu spoke gloomily, “Move aside!”

A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Zhen’s mouth, and then his smile froze while his abdomen started to expand.

Yang Gu’s expression changed drastically at the sight of this, “Self-detonation! Are you mad?!”
