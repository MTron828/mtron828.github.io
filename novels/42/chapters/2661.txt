Chapter 2662 – I’ll Blast Your Head Open!

A petite young girl had appeared behind Yang Ye.

It was none other than Erya!

Erya!

However, Erya was completely different from how she had been. Now, she was emanating an extremely evil aura, and it was a form of evil that came innately. As for her appearance, it had changed slightly too. She had a pair of sharp black horns on her head.

Besides that, there was a very long tail behind her!

A tail covered in sharp spikes!

It was around 3m long!

Erya’s pupils had turned scarlet red too!

It wasn’t the same shade of scarlet as Yang Ye’s eyes when he was enveloped by slaughter intent!

Yang Ye glanced at her. At this moment, she seemed a little unfamiliar to him.

Erya gazed at Yang Ye for a moment and said, “Big Brother Yang, step back for now. Let me handle this!”

Big Brother Yang!

Yang Ye was inwardly relieved. Perhaps she’d changed on the outside, but she was still the same Erya!

Yang Ye said, “Erya, you…”

She’d already walked over toward the Divine Abode’s master and the others while her tail was just dragged against space.

The Divine Abode’s master and the others hadn’t noticed, but Yang Ye had noticed that space was actually being sliced open by her tail!

That tail was truly extraordinary!

The Divine Abode’s master and the others had extremely solemn expressions on their faces because they sensed danger from Erya!

Suddenly, Dafeng said, “Let me try her strength!”

He stomped his right foot down and charged at Erya.

Boundless fist intent erupted from Dafeng’s fist. The fist intent was truly capable of shaking the world!

Even Yang Ye had to admit that his fist intent was truly strong!

Erya’s face remained indifferent, and only coldness and indifference could be seen in her eyes!

Yang Ye was prepared to lend her a hand at any moment.

Meanwhile, the fist had arrived before Erya, and everyone watched as she stretched out her right claw. A moment later, they were all stunned.

Even Yang Ye was stunned!

Erya had actually stopped that terrifying punch!

It couldn’t move an inch forward!

Once her claw grasped his fist, Dafeng’s fist intent had completely vanished without a trace. It was like his fist intent had never existed!

Dafeng was stunned!

My attack just vanished like that?

Meanwhile, Erya suddenly exerted force.

Hiss!

Dafeng’s entire arm was forcefully pulled off his body!

A moment later, Dafeng hadn’t even been able to react before Erya slammed a punch against his chest. It was absolutely swift and powerful, and her claw just pierced straight through Dafeng’s chest!

At this moment, Dafeng finally recovered from his shock, but it was too late.

Erya’s left claw swiftly slammed down upon Dafeng’s head.

Bang!

Dafeng’s head exploded apart. It wasn’t just his head, even his body was obliterated before the force of the attack!

Even his soul wasn’t left behind!Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The Divine Abode’s master and the others instantly revealed extremely unsightly expressions. A moment later, the Divine Abode’s master gazed at Yang Ye and wondered why Yang Ye always had such terrifying existences by his side!

Meanwhile, Erya gazed at the Divine Abode’s master, causing the latter’s expression to change drastically. An instant later, they joined forces, and numerous terrifying auras slammed down at Erya.

At the same time, a pike tore through space toward Erya!

Erya just stood there without dodging.

Suddenly, an evil grin appeared on her lips, and then she opened her mouth and roared.

Boom!

Their auras were instantly obliterated before her roar!

As for the pike, she didn’t try to defend herself at all and just allowed it to stab her chest!

Crack!

Erya was completely unharmed, but the pike broke!

The Divine Abode’s master stared at Erya. At this moment, she felt like she was dreaming.

It broke just like that?

The Divine Abode’s master wasn’t the only one, even Yang Ye was completely stunned. He knew Erya’s body was very terrifying, but it hadn’t been this terrifying! Now, she had actually been able to forcefully resist an attack from the Divine Abode’s master!

At this moment, he suddenly recalled something. Qi Bitian had said that Erya had helped her once!

At that time, Qi Bitian should have been in her prime, but Erya had still been able to help her. So, how terrifying had Erya been in the past?

Meanwhile, Erya suddenly vanished on the spot. She was so swift that Yang Ye couldn’t see her figure clearly…

Boom!

An explosion resounded in the distance, and then a peak Destiny Realm expert’s body exploded apart and was obliterated!

Even his soul hadn’t been able to survive!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye pointed at the Divine Abode’s master, “Erya, kill him first!”

Erya swiftly gazed at the Divine Abode’s master upon hearing Yang Ye, and the latter’s expression changed drastically, “Retreat!”

He turned around and fled upon giving the order. However, Erya was faster than him and appeared in front of him.

Erya was about to attack when she suddenly looked to the side, and a ray of saber energy shot over.

Her eyes narrowed slightly as she raised her palm and pushed it forward.

Bang!

The saber energy was blasted apart, but Erya was pushed around 300m back!

A man walked out slowly from the teleportation formation. It was Zuo Mu.

Erya had a ferocious grin on her face as she stomped her right foot down.

Boom!

It seemed like something in the world had been stomped into bits, and the End Dimension gradually turned slightly ethereal.

Zuo Mu looked slightly to the side, and then he moved backward.

Meanwhile, the expressions of the Divine Abode’s master and the others had changed, and they retreated toward the End World.

That stomp of hers had harmed the quintessence of the End Dimension, and it had destroyed their barrier. In other words, they couldn’t fight as they pleased anymore!

Even Zuo Mu didn’t attack again and retreated instead.

Those who’d never experienced that era would never be able to understand how terrifying Destiny was!

Of course, if they knew that Yang Ye was carrying one of them with him…

Erya didn’t just stop there. Her figure flashed, and she charged at Zuo Mu.

Zuo Mu suddenly stopped before the teleportation formation, and then he turned around to face Erya while his saber emerged by 5 inches from its sheath.

Hiss!

A ray of saber energy flashed.

Bang!

An explosion resounded and Erya was back where she’d been a moment ago.

There was a mark on her claw.

Erya looked up into the distance. Zuo Mu and the others had returned into the End World now.

Erya was about to charge over when Yang Ye hurriedly stopped her. Even though she was absolutely strong, he could see that while she could crush ordinary peak Destiny Realm experts, she couldn’t suppress an expert like Zuo Mu!

But he knew of at least 3 experts in the End World who were at Zuo Mu’s level!

So, if they charged into the End World, they would probably not make it out alive!

Erya patted her claws together and gazed at Yang Ye, “Big Brother Yang, am I formidable?”

Yang Ye smiled, “You’re formidable, much more formidable than me!”

She cracked a smile, “If I’m formidable, then so are you; if you’re formidable, then so am I!”

Yang Ye chuckled. He rubbed her head, or to be more precise, it was her horns.

Erya’s face stiffened slightly when Yang Ye’s hand touched her horns, but it didn’t take long for her to return to normal.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he left the End Dimension with Erya.

At this moment, he realized that he couldn’t fight the End World on his own. No matter how strong he was, he couldn’t annihilate those old geezers in the End World.

He had to gather more help, and the first people he thought about were Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu!

If they returned, and then he went to seek help from Sky Maiden and Jian Wudi… Besides that, he could get help from Sha Ji and Cang Mu too.

Sha Ji and Cang Mu were experts that Qi Bitian had left to him. However, he’d never allowed them to join the battle. They were both at the peak of the Destiny Realm, and each of them would have no problem fighting two experts in their realm of cultivation. It was pointless to make them help earlier. He wanted to keep them for a critical moment, so that he could give the experts of the End World a “pleasant surprise”.

Yang Ye returned to the Primordial Pagoda with Eray.

Or to be more precise, he returned to the wooden house with her. Once Erya arrived there, she gazed at Snowy first, but it didn’t take long for her to move her gaze onto the woman in black.

Erya clenched her claws.

The woman in black tightened her grip on her sword.

The atmosphere here instantly became tense!

Snowy blinked and gazed at Yang Ye. Obviously, she was asking Yang Ye what was wrong.

Yang Ye smiled embarrassedly and was about to speak, but the woman in black suddenly gazed at him, “What do you want to say?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “I want to ask if we can remain at peace for now. Can you resolve the enmity between you and Erya at a later time?”

She replied coldly, “What if I refuse?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Erya is my friend.”

She laughed coldly, “Allow me to be honest, perhaps I would fear her when she was at her prime. But even 10 of her are no match for me now.”

Erya frowned, “Do you want me to blast your head open?”

She clenched her right fist as she spoke.

She wasn’t joking!

The woman in black laughed coldly and raised her sword, “Come give it a try! Let’s see if you blast my head open, or I cut off your horns!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
