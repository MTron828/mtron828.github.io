Chapter 1921 – Another Twist!

Who was the Sovereign of man?

It could be said that the Sovereign of Man could be considered as the leader of the human race, and to a certain extent, he represented the human race!

Yang Ye was someone the Sovereign of Man wanted to capture!

Nansi Yin’s father and the others gazed at Yang Ye while bewilderment and curiosity filled their eyes.

Yang Ye glanced at the violet robed old man’s group. He hadn’t expected the Sovereign of Man’s forces to arrive at a time like this, and he hadn’t expected it to be a group of top-rate experts. Moreover, there were so many of them!

So, he was in quite a pickle right now!

After all, his current strength was absolutely incapable of defeating all of them!

Meanwhile, Nansi Yin’s father suddenly asked, “Is there some sort of misunderstanding here?”

The violet robed old man gazed at Nansi Yin’s father, “I presume you’re the Nansi Clan’s patriarch, Nansi Tian, right?”

Nansi Yin’s father nodded, “Indeed!”

The violet robed old man pointed at Yang Ye, “He hasn’t just stolen the Sovereign of Man’s holy sword, he has cultivated the techniques of the shaman race, and he possesses the bloodline of the shaman race. The Sovereign of Man suspects that he's here under orders from the shaman race, and he's planning something. So, we were ordered to capture him and take him back to the Central Prefecture!”

Nansi Tian frowned, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “You’re really cultivated techniques of the shaman race and possess their bloodline?”

Yang Ye didn’t conceal it and nodded.

Nansi Tian’s face fell when he saw this.

Meanwhile, the old man smiled, “You seem to know him. He possesses the shaman race’s bloodline and has cultivated their techniques. If news of this spreads to the Sovereign of Man, the Nansi Clan will…”

Nansi Tian suddenly spoke coldly, “Are you using the Sovereign of Man to threaten me?”

The old man spoke indifferently, “How could I? I’m just giving you a reminder!”

Nansi Tian fell silent.

Yang Ye had escorted Nansi Yin safely out of the Shaman Dimension, so the Nansi Clan definitely owed him a huge debt. Moreover, he’d said that so long as Yang Ye needed help, his clan would definitely not refuse if it was within their ability.

However, he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to be someone that the Sovereign of Man wanted to capture.

Meanwhile, Nansi Yin tugged the corner of Nansi Tian’s sleeve.

Nansi Tian glanced at her and grinned. After that, he gazed at the old man, “My Nansi Clan owes him, so I wonder if you can give my Nansi Clan face and let him go?”

“Let him go?” The old man spoke coldly, “Patriarch Nansi Tian, allow me to be honest. Not to mention your Nansi Clan, even if the three hallowed grounds join forces in order to protect him, they still wouldn’t be able to protect him. The Sovereign of Man is determined to kill him. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have made us come here!”

The Sovereign of Man was determined to kill him!

Nansi Tian frowned. He was about to speak when an old man behind him spoke to him via voice transmission, “It’s inadvisable for our Nansi Clan to interfere in this!”

The Nansi Clan was a large clan in the Human Dimension, and even the Sovereign of Man had to fear it. But the Nansi Clan wouldn’t offend the Sovereign of Man for no reason. After all, he was still the leader of the human race. Of course, it depended on the issue. If the Sovereign of Man wanted to kill Nansi Yin, then the Nansi Clan would fight the Sovereign of Man, no matter the consequences.

As for Yang Ye, he wasn’t worth it!

It depended on whether someone was worth it or not!

Suddenly, Nansi Yin said, “Help him!”

Nansi Tian and the others gazed at her. One of the old men behind her frowned. He was just about to berate her, but he seemed to have thought of something, and he swallowed what he was about to say.

At this moment, Nansi Yin wasn’t the same Nansi Yin he knew. She possessed the inheritance of a Sage, so she could be considered as the most important person in the Nansi Clan.

Meanwhile, Nansi Yin added, “Father, I wouldn’t have obtained this inheritance if it wasn’t for him. How can my Nansi Clan stand by idly when he’s in danger? Father, I implore you to help him. Otherwise, I would rather give up this inheritance!”

“You’re gone mad!” One of the old men behind Nansi Tian berated, “Do you know how important that inheritance is? You actually intend to give it up for someone who has no ties with our Nansi Clan? You… you…”

Meanwhile, Nansi Tian suddenly shot an icy cold glance at the old man, and the old man stopped abruptly.

Nansi Tian turned to look at Nansi Yin, and he was about to speak when Nansi Yin said, “If it wasn’t for him, I would have absolutely not gotten the Sage’s inheritance. If you refuse to help him, then I would rather give up this inheritance so that I can rest at ease and avoid feeling guilty for my entire life!”

Nansi Tian slowly clenched his fist and was hesitant.

Meanwhile, the violet robed old man spoke indifferently, “Patriarch Nansi Tian, I know that if you insist on protecting him, then we’ll definitely be unable to kill him while you’re here. However, allow me to ask you if you really intend to go against the Sovereign of Man for someone who isn’t related to your Nansi Clan at all?”

Nansi Tian looked up at the old man, “There should be quite a few in the human race who cultivate the techniques of the shaman race, but the Sovereign of Man doesn’t seem to have made such a fuss about it. I’m really curious, why does the Sovereign of Man insist on killing him?”

The old man spoke indifferently, “I don’t know the answer to that question. However, I can tell you that the Sovereign of Man is determined to take his life. If you insist on protecting him, then trust me, the Sovereign of Man will never let this matter rest!”

Nansi Tian was about to speak when an old man behind him suddenly sent him a voice transmission, “Nansi Yin obtained the Sage’s inheritance, so the other large clans and even the three hallowed grounds may keep their distance from us, and it’s even to the extent that they may try to suppress us in secret. If we offend the Sovereign of Man at a time like this, then our Nansi Clan will be in a worrying situation. Patriarch, please think of the entire clan’s interests!”

Nansi Tian closed his eyes slowly. Personally speaking, he felt that they should repay all debts of kindness that they owed, and it was the principle by which he lived by. However, as the patriarch of the Nansi Clan, he couldn’t apply too much personal emotion when making most decisions. Because it would bring harm to the Nansi Clan!

Simply speaking, the Nansi Clan couldn’t protect Yang Ye!

Nansi Yin seemed to be aware of the decision that Nansi Tian would make, so she suddenly walked over to Yang Ye. Nansi Tian hesitated for a moment and didn’t stop her in the end.

Nansi Yin walked over to Yang Ye and said, “I’m sorry!”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s fine!”

“Grab me and use me as a hostage!” Nansi Yin’s voice suddenly resounded in Yang Ye’s mind.

It was via voice transmission!

Yang Ye was stunned for a moment, and then he shook his head and smiled, “It’s fine.”

“You won’t be able to get away!” Nansi Yin’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind again, “The weakest amongst them is at the 5th stage of the Enlightened Realm. The Sovereign of Man is determined to kill you, and your current strength is utterly insufficient to escape. So, grab me and use me as a hostage, and then flee to the Shaman Dimension. They won’t dare to openly enter the Shaman Dimension!”

Use Nansi Yin as a hostage?

Yang Ye still shook his head. That wasn’t his style. Even though it would help, he didn’t want to do that.

Nansi Yin became anxious when she saw Yang Ye insist on refusing, “Why are you acting like this? Do you want me to feel guilty for my entire life?”

“You don’t have to feel guilty!” Yang Ye smiled, “This is my own problem. Actually, I expected a situation like this a long time ago.”

As he spoke, he gazed at the violet robed old man’s group, “But I never expected that fellow, the Sovereign of Man, to send such a huge force!”

The old man spoke indifferently, “In the past, we underestimated you tremendously, but we won’t do it again!”

Yang Ye smiled. He was about to speak when a sword suddenly appeared in Nansi Yin’s grasp, and then she placed it against her throat.

Nansi Tian and the others’ expressions changed drastically!

Nansi Tian’s carried a trace of anxiety, “What are you doing?!”

Nansi Yin looked him in the eyes, “Father, protect him. Otherwise, I’ll make this inheritance and myself vanish from this world!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Nansi Tian spoke in a low voice, “You’re actually threatening me for him!”

Nansi Yin looked him in the eyes and said, “You taught me that I should never be ungrateful!”

Nansi Tian slowly clenched his fists. Meanwhile, her sword had cut through her skin.

She was bleeding!

Nansi Tian’s hands trembled at the sight of this, and then he gazed at the violet robed old man, “I don’t care what enmity the Sovereign of Man has with him, but my Nansi Clan owes him a debt. So…”

“So it’s best if you don’t interfere!” Suddenly, a voice resounded from the sky, and then three men appeared here.

All of them wore black robes, and they held black pikes.

The Shaman Hunter Clan!

A cold smile curled up on the corners of the old man’s mouth when he witnessed this scene.

Amongst the three men from the Shaman Hunter Clan, the middle aged man who led the group gazed at Yang Ye, “He hasn’t just cultivated the techniques of the shaman race and possesses the bloodline of the shaman race, he even killed members of my Shaman Hunter Clan. Moreover, he openly challenged my Shaman Hunter Clan. My clan is determined to kill him, and anyone who tries to protect him is an enemy of my clan!”

The Shaman Hunter Clan!

Nansi Tian’s expression instantly became extremely unsightly.

Nansi Yin wanted to say more, but an old man suddenly appeared behind her and tapped her nape. Nansi Yin’s figure stiffened and fell unconscious.

The old man gazed at Nansi Tian and shook his head.

Nansi Tian closed his eyes slowly. A short while later, he gazed at Yang Ye who was remaining silent, “I’m sorry!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand and vanished into the sky with the other members of the Nansi Clan.

Only Yang Ye, the violet robed man’s group, and the experts from the Shaman Hunter Clan remained.
