Chapter 1192 – My Heart Houses No Fear!

Yang Ye turned around and saw a slovenly old man had appeared not too far away from him.

The reason he felt the old man was slovenly because the old man was dressed like a beggar. His hair was even so messy to the point it seemed like it hadn’t been washed for years.

Yang Ye glanced at the old man’s waist and saw a sword there.

“You’re the 3rd person to arrive here in the last tens of thousands of years.” The slovenly old man walked over to Yang Ye and sized him up, “You really are not bad. Your sword intent is temper well, and so is your slaughter intent. You have great potential indeed. Unfortunately, your cultivator is quite low.”

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, may I know who you are?”

“I’m just a slovenly old man!” The old man waved his hand and said, “You’re really not bad since you were able to arrive here. You can’t continue forward because you might die if you do?”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

The old man gazed at Yang Ye and said, “You must understand that this isn’t a test that Senior Jian Wuji left behind. His sword intent is instinctively protecting its master instead. If you continue up the mountain, it’ll treat you as an enemy.”

When he spoke up to this point, he gazed at the intent sword and said, “Senior Jian Wuji’s kindness left this sword behind to stop others from going further.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “His kindness?”

The slovenly old man looked up at the mountain peak and said, “Every person has a good and bad side. I presume you’ve realized it as well. The sword intent here is filled with killing intent, viciousness, and unwillingness. Actually, they are the negative emotions that Senior Jian Wuji had all those years ago, and a part of his sword intent carry those negative emotions. Not to mention you, even an Emperor would be instantly killed before the part of his sword intent that carry those negative emotions, let alone you!”

Yang Ye fell silent. He knew that the old man wasn’t trying to scare him. Because the intent sword before him was stronger than Emperors. Even the aura of an Emperor wouldn’t be able to make his Void Rank sword intent dare not fight back. Yet now, his Void Rank intents actually didn’t dare to fight back against the intent sword!

Moreover, based on what the slovenly old man said, the sword intent he would encounter after this intent sword was the truly terrifying sword intent. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye remained silent for a short while before he gazed at the old man, “Senior, you said that 3 people have been here. I’m one of them, you are another. Who is the last? I’m quite curious!”

The old man pointed towards the distance, “Look over there!”

Yang Ye looked along the direction that the old man had pointed towards, and he saw a huge stone there. There was a row of words on the stone. Yang Ye’s pupils constricted when he saw the words.

The words on the stone were — The Sword God? Interesting.

He recognized the writing, and the sword intent it contained was even more familiar to him.

It was left behind by the Founding Ancestor of the Sword Sect!

The Unfettered One!

Yang Ye naturally knew who he was and had even received his help. Since he started cultivating on Profound Continent until arriving at the Radiant Dimension, he’d constantly heard of the Unfettered One’s legends. But he’d never expected that the Unfettered One had actually come to Dark Hell Continent!

“See that?” Meanwhile, the slovenly old man spoke abruptly, “Because his sword intent is there, Senior Jian Wuji’s sword intent doesn’t dare to come close to that rock at all. I never expected that such a terrifying sword cultivator would have actually appeared on Dark Hell Continent after senior Jian Wuji. But why have I never heard of him?”

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then he glanced at the old man and said, “I’m unable to see through your strength, so I presume it’s at a terrifying level. But are you telling me that even you are unable to ascend to the peak of the mountain?”

“Why would I ascend to the peak?” The old man chuckled, “I can’t even compete with the 2 sword intents left behind here, so what’s the point of ascending to the peak?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

“Go back!” The old man waved his hand and said, “It’s rare that a genius in the Sword Dao has appeared on the continent, so don’t allow yourself to be killed here. Once you attain the Emperor Realm or gain another breakthrough in your sword intent, then you can come here and give it another try.”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “What’s above the Void Rank?”

“I don’t know!” The old man continued, “Only 2 knew, and only they have attained it!”

Yang Ye knew that the old man was speaking about the Unfettered One and Jian Wuji.

“Go on!” The old man waved his hand and started walking towards the side.

“Senior, I have something to say!” Meanwhile, Yang Ye spoke abruptly.

The old man turned around to gaze at Yang Ye. Yang Ye said, “Sword cultivators should charge forward courageously and grow stronger according to the circumstances, right?”

Yang Ye chuckled once he finished speaking, and then he started walking towards the intent sword, “My sword intent and slaughter intent dare not face this intent sword. Do you know what it made me think about? I didn’t think about how strong this intent sword is; I was thinking about how my sword intent and slaughter intent were actually so weak.”

The old man asked, “Is there a difference between that?”

“Of course!” Yang Ye walked over to the intent sword and stopped before it. He said, “If I thought about how strong this intent sword is, then I would arouse fear towards it. Just like you, senior. In your heart, Senior Jian Wuji is probably an insurmountable mountain. So, you dare not take a look at his sword intent that’s even stronger than what’s left here. All of you can do is gaze at this intent sword and sigh with emotion every single day. I’m not wrong, am I?”

Yang Ye turned around to look at the old man and continued, “Senior, you’ve stayed here because you hope to allow your sword intent to attain the same height as this intent sword. But you failed to realize that this intent sword has become an inner demon of yours.”

The old man gazed at Yang Ye in silence.

Yang Ye turned around to look at the intent sword and said, “We sword cultivators shouldn’t fear anything while we have a sword in hand! Those who have no fear are invincible!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a wisp of ruthlessness flashed through his eyes, and then his Void Rank sword intent and slaughter intent surged out from within him again. However, they’d just surged out when they acted like mice that had encountered a cat, and they surged back into him. As for the intent sword in front of Yang Ye, it didn’t move at all!

Yang Ye smiled, “It really is strong!”

Meanwhile, the slovenly old man walked over to Yang Ye’s side and said, “Kid, you’re right, very right. But can you feel it? This sword intent isn’t something that Void Rank sword intent can resist. Your sword intent and slaughter intent aren’t weak, but they aren’t on the same level as this sword intent. Confidence is good, but you can’t be conceited!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Senior, what is sword intent?”

The old man said, “Sword intent is the fusion of the mind and soul, it’s the harmony between the material and the void. It’s both beyond something with form, yet it possesses form as well. It’s ethereal, but once it’s at a certain level, one isn’t just able to sense it, one can even see it. Sword intent is an extension of our quintessence, and that quintessence is the sword in our grasp. When a sword cultivator possesses sword intent, the sword isn’t an inanimate object anymore, and it has a life of its own.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Senior’s understanding of sword intent is very deep. Then let me ask you another question. What’s a sword cultivator?”

The old man replied, “Those who hold a sword and have comprehended sword intent are sword cultivators!”

Yang Ye asked, “But how does one become an outstanding sword cultivator?”

The old man gazed at Yang Ye for a short while and said, “The Enlightened Sword Heart, clear thoughts, and fearlessness! Are you indirectly trying to make me praise you?”

Yang Ye stretched out his hand and made a grasping motion. An intent sword appeared in his grasp, but just as before, it vanished in an instant. Yang Ye gazed at his hand for a short while before he looked at the old man, “Senior, your attainments in the Sword Dao surpass my own. I’d like to ask whether I’m still a sword cultivator since my sword intent doesn’t dare to fight back?”

The old man was stunned. His sword intent didn’t dare to fight back. In other words, was a sword cultivator without sword intent still a sword cultivator? Why were sword cultivators strong? Because they had sword intent. Just like Yang Ye, what had he relied on to kill Quasi Emperors while he was at the Half-Saint Realm? Besides his physical strength, it was sword intent. Because sword intent could provide a drastic increase in his strength. Otherwise, his sword energy wouldn’t be able to pose a threat to Quasi Emperors at all!

It could be said that his sword intent was a huge reason why he was so strong!

Yet now, his sword intent didn’t dare to fight back. So, was such a sword cultivator still a sword cultivator?

The old man clenched his fists slowly and wasn’t able to return to his senses for a long time.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “It can be said that the reason we sword cultivators are so strong is that we’ve comprehended sword intent. In other words, sword intent is our foundation. Yet now, our sword intent doesn’t dare to fight back. Senior, you possess wide knowledge and experience, so can you provide me with some guidance? What should I do now?”

Yang Ye wasn’t someone who liked to waste his breath. But he was really lost right now. Because this had never happened to his sword intent in the past! It didn’t dare fight back, and it didn’t even dare to condense into form before that intent sword. He’d never ever imagined that his sword intent and slaughter intent would act like that!

The old man remained silent for a long time before he spoke, “Kid, you’re still young. It really isn’t necessary to force yourself here. With the natural talent you possess, it’s not impossible for you to advance higher than the Void Rank in the future. I’m serious. You’re the sword cultivator with the best natural talent that I’ve seen in the last 10,000 years. It would be a loss to our continent if you are to die here!”

“Even you have no solution?” Yang Ye took a deep breath, “Since you don’t have a solution, then I’ll use my own.”

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “What are you thinking of doing?”

Yang Ye gazed at the intent sword and said, “If I’m stopped by this sword today, then inner demons will appear within me. So, I have to pass through no matter what. Otherwise, it won’t be stopping me for a while but for a lifetime.”

When he spoke up to this point, Yang Ye’s eyes suddenly turned blood red and were filled with baleful energy, “I, Yang Ye, do not fear the earth, do not fear heavens, and do not fear any man! Since my sword intent is fearful, then I, Yang Ye, would rather lose it! My heart houses no fear!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a faint fiery glow suddenly surged out from Yang Ye!

Ignition of sword intent!

Yang Ye was burning away his Void Rank sword intent!

The old man’s eyes opened wide as he gazed at this scene with astonishment, “Have... have you gone mad?”

He hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually ignite Void Rank sword intent!

He’s burning away his Void Rank sword intent just because it showed fear.... He has gone mad!

Yang Ye paid no attention to the old man, and his Void Rank sword intent was burning madly....

It didn’t take long for it to drop to the Quasi Void Rank.

The Heaven Rank.

The 6th level.

The 3rd level.
