Chapter 649 – The 10th Pavilion Of The 10 Nether Pavilions!

“You won?” A faint smile appeared on the corners of her mouth as she gazed at Yang Ye. However, An Nanjing’s smile was slightly pale, and her left shoulder was still bleeding incessantly.

Yang Ye walked over to her. For some unknown reason, two streams of water gradually seeped out of the corners of his eyes as he gazed at her mangled left shoulder.

His heart hurt! At this moment, Yang Ye felt like his entire heart was being stabbed by needles!

An Nanjing was quite stunned when she saw Yang Ye’s tears flowing for her, and then her eyes drooped. She remained silent for a short while before she said, “I’m fine. It hasn’t harmed my foundation, so I can regrow it!”

Yang Ye pulled her into his arms and placed his right hand on her left shoulder before the profound energy within him surged madly. He just transferred his profound energy to her in silence, and he didn’t say that he was sorry, nor did he thank her. Because there was no need for all of that between him and her.

An Nanjing’s delicate figure stiffened, and she struggled slightly yet wasn’t able to struggle free from his embrace. She fell silent for a moment, and then didn’t continue trying to struggle free. She just let him embrace her while complicated emotions and a trace of bewilderment appeared in her eyes.

“You actually killed Xiahou Xuan.” Meanwhile, Unseeing spoke abruptly.

“I’ll kill you in a while as well!” Yang Ye gazed at Unseeing while his voice was completely emotionless.

“I’m not afraid of death!” Unseeing said, “I’m just curious about why you were able to kill him.”

“Does it make a difference?” Yang Ye said, “He’s dead, isn’t he?”

Unseeing was slightly stunned, and then he nodded and said, “You’re right, it’s meaningless now. What I wanted to say is that our battle isn’t over, so you shouldn’t have interfered.”

An Nanjing nodded slightly and intended to struggle free from Yang Ye’s embrace. However, he held on tightly to her and didn’t budge at all. An Nanjing was stunned by this and just stared blankly at him.

Yang Ye spoke in a gentle tone, “Don’t forget that they’d never intended to fight me in a one on one battle when they came here just now. So, just recuperate and leave him to me. Alright?”

An Nanjing stopped hesitating when she recalled how Unseeing and Xiahou Xuan had joined forces against Yang Ye just now, and she immediately nodded. She was one who adhered to principals in battle, yet she wasn’t one who adhered stubbornly to them. If Unseeing and Xiahou Xuan hadn’t joined forces against Yang Ye in the beginning, then she would absolutely not allow Yang Ye to interfere in their battle. Unfortunately, Unseeing and Xiahou Xuan hadn’t chosen a one on one battle when dealing with Yang Ye just now!

Yang Ye smiled when he saw her nod, and then his gaze instantly turned icy cold as he gazed at Unseeing and said, “The Hallowed Grounds has constantly tried to kill me. I, Yang Ye, swear to the heavens that I’ll definitely wipe the Hallowed Grounds off the face of the world one day.” He didn’t care about the fight against the defiant profounders. All he knew was that the Hallowed Grounds wanted him dead, so he would destroy it instead! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“You’re too confident!” Unseeing said, “Not to mention you, even the defiant profounders can dream of easily destroying my Hallowed Grounds!”

“Perhaps!” Yang Ye said, “But I want to give it a try.”

Unseeing fell silent for a short while, and then he said, “We shouldn’t kill each other. The defiant profounders are the true enemy of our human race. It’s not worth it regardless of whether it’s the members of my Hallowed Grounds that die at your hands or vice versa. Even if they die, they should die in the coming battle with the defiant profounders!”

“You should tell that to the Hallowed Grounds!” said Yang Ye.

Unseeing said, “They’ll understand that after what happened here today!”

“It’s too late for that!” Yang Ye took a deep breath and said, “This war is something all of you started, yet you want to put an end to it just like that? That’s impossible! Moreover, I’m very well aware that with the pride your Hallowed Grounds has, it’s absolutely impossible for it to seek reconciliation. Even if both of you died today, they would only dispatch even stronger forces tomorrow. Perhaps they might even dispatch Half-Saints, right? But don’t worry, I won’t always stay in such a passive position. Once I take the initiative, I’ll truly become the nightmare of the Hallowed Grounds!”

“Perhaps!” Unseeing said, “Once both I and Xiahou Xuan perish today, the Hallowed Grounds will truly realize how terrifying you are. At that time, they’ll have only 2 choices. The first, to draw you over to their side. Because you and your woman will grow into peerless experts in the future. The second would be to crush you. Because the Hallowed Grounds will absolutely not allow another.... No, two more formidable enemies like the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor to be born in the future!”

An Nanjing had a slightly uncomfortable expression on her face when she heard Unseeing say that about her, and she wanted to say something about it. However, while her lips twitched for a long time, she didn’t say anything in the end.

She didn’t have the habit of explaining anything to others.... Except Yang Ye!

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “The Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor went to the Hallowed Grounds?”

He’d met the Unfettered One’s soul, but he suddenly realized that the Unfettered One seemed more and more mysterious in his eyes.

“He did!” Unseeing said, “And he even killed there!”

“How many did he kill?” asked Yang Ye.

Unseeing answered, “15 Half-Saints and a few hundred Monarch Realm experts!”

Yang Ye pupils constricted. 15 Half-Saints.... His strength was countless times stronger than his depictions in the legends of the continent!

Yang Ye shook his head, let go of An Nanjing, and said, “How are you feeling now?”

She replied, “I need a month to recuperate completely!”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Don’t leave once this battle is over. Stay and help me, alright?” He didn’t know how terrifying the number one genius of the Hallowed Grounds was, but he was very clearly aware that the number one genius’ strength would absolutely far exceed his expectations. If it was a one on one battle, then he wouldn’t fear such an opponent as he was at the ninth rank of the Exalt Realm, but what if they used numbers against him?

Of course, most importantly, he wanted An Nanjing to cultivate within the Primordial Pagoda. If An Nanjing were to cultivate there, then her natural talent would definitely allow her strength to increase greatly as she cultivated there!

An Nanjing glanced at him and said, “I’m not leaving!”

Yang Ye smiled, and then he walked over to Unseeing while an intent sword appeared in his grasp. He said, “You must die!”

“I won’t go down without a fight!” Unseeing’s hand shook slightly, and his violet spear started to tremble violently. However, the injury on his stomach opened even wider, and blood started pouring out incessantly.

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to flash forward, and he transformed into a ray of light that shot towards Unseeing.

However, the voice of a woman suddenly resounded, “Nether Maiden from the 10th Pavilion of the 10 Nether Pavilions. One who lives alone on the living rock of the Netherworld to judge the souls of the dead, controls the divine energy of Yin and Yang, knows the secrets of life and death....”

Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically when he heard this. Meanwhile, he saw a black shadow flash before his eyes, and then a figure appeared in front of him. After that, his intent sword which carried 12th level Sword Intent was clasped between 2 fine and fair fingers!

“The 1st on the Hallowed Rankings, Nether Maiden!”

Bang!

An explosion resounded as soon as these words were spoken.

The intent sword in Yang Ye’s grasp exploded apart, and then it transformed into nothingness....
