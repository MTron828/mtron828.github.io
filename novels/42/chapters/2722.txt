Chapter 2723 – Sprite Creation!

Ask Snowy to create one!

The more he thought about it, the more possible it seemed!

If Snowy could create a sprite to take control of the 9th layer of space, it represented that the 9th layer of space would belong to him!

If the experts of the End World wanted to go above the 9th layer of space from here, they would have to get his approval!

It felt increasingly possible as he thought about it!

Moreover, he had some other thoughts too!

Meanwhile, Yin Yang Goddess suddenly asked, “What kind of schemes are you planning now?”

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she scanned Yang Ye and said, “Your smile was too sly just now. I’m certain you were planning something!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

She added, “I should stay away from you!”

She’d been tricked by him in the past!

She knew he was full of tricks and schemes!

Yang Ye’s face darkened. What is she trying to say?

Yang Ye ignored her and just continued recuperating!

Yin Yang Goddess didn’t leave. She just stood there and kept sizing up Yang Ye.

A short while later, shock appeared in her eyes because Yang Ye’s injuries were rapidly healing at a terrifying rate!

They were healing very, very quickly!

Yin Yang Goddess’ face gradually grew solemn. Such a speed of recovery was too heaven defying! It wasn’t something an ordinary person should possess at all!

Just like that, around two hours passed before Yang Ye’s injuries had practically completely healed.

Yang Ye stood up and cupped his fist to Yin Yang Goddess, “Senior, I’ll be leaving now.”

Yang Ye was about to leave when she suddenly asked, “You’re going to try again?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She spoke solemnly, “You have the Great Unknown, so you can just break through directly.”

Yang Ye smiled, “I want to get there with my own ability!”

She glanced at him and said, “True. It is a good thing for you!”

She paused for a moment and continued, “Aren’t the End World’s experts coming for you?”

Yang Ye replied, “I think they won’t be coming for me, for now, at least.”

She gave him a thumbs up and said, “Amazing! However, since we are acquaintances now, I should warn you not to underestimate the End World. Moreover, they won’t give up!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Thank you for the reminder.”

He cupped his fist again, “Farewell!”

He tapped his right foot down and shot up on his sword. A moment later, space was sliced open in the distance, and the ray of light entered it.

Yin Yang Goddess shot a glance in that direction and shook her head, “What a monster!”

She turned around and left.

Yang Ye entered the spatial passageway and tapped his finger forward. Five swords shot out from the sword chest on his back, and they stopped the spatial energy not too far ahead of him.

Yang Ye didn’t go further and just summoned Snowy instead.

Snowy!

Snowy blinked, hugged Yang Ye, and rubbed her head on him.

Yang Ye smiled, “This world doesn’t have a sprite, so can you create one?”

Create a sprite!

Snowy blinked and didn’t really understand what Yang Ye meant.

Yang Ye had no choice but to explain for a long time. In the end, Snowy finally understood.

She glanced at the surroundings, and then she shook her head. She couldn’t do it because this place was too huge, and she didn’t know how!

Suddenly, a young girl appeared before them.

Little Sky!

Snowy flew over to Little Sky’s shouted and rubbed her head gently against Little Sky’s face.

After she became the sprite of the world in the Primordial Pagoda, she very rarely showed herself. Because she had to ceaselessly perfect the world, and she was fond of it too.

It was a world without war!

Little Sky glanced at Yang Ye, “Let me try!”

Yang Ye decisively shook his head, “No!”

Little Sky frowned slightly, “Why? I can do it. I can become this world’s sprite with Snowy’s help.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Little Sky, it’s too dangerous to become this world’s sprite. I don’t want you to take that risk.”

Little Sky wanted to say more, but Yang Ye became serious, “Little Sky, I said no.”

She felt quite helpless.

Yang Ye walked over to her and rubbed her head gently, “Just stay in the Primordial Pagoda. That is a world that truly belongs to you. I know you want to help me, but I don’t want you to be in danger. Understand?”

She nodded, “Alright!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Go back inside.”

Little Sky glanced at the surroundings and spoke softly, “Be careful!”

She pinched Snowy’s cheek and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and felt quite helpless. His plan to create a sprite had probably gone down the drain!

Suddenly, Snowy waved her paw.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

A short while later, Yang Ye was stunned, “You’re saying that you can do it?”

Snowy nodded and waved her paws swiftly.

A short while later, Yang Ye understood what she meant.

The 9th layer of space didn’t have a sprite, but the space here still existed. Simply speaking, while she couldn’t make the space here grow a new sprite, she could make the spirit energy of this world form a sprite! After that, merge the sprite with the space here. In that way, it would be equivalent to creating a sprite for this world!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Will it work?”

She blinked to display that they could give it a try!

Yang Ye spoke seriously, “Will there be any problems?”

She hurriedly shook her head.

Yang Ye reconfirmed, “Really?”

Snowy nodded again.

Yang Ye asked again, “Are you really sure?”

Snowy blinked as she wondered if she was really sure.

Yang Ye felt utterly speechless.

A short while later, Yang Ye decided to let Snowy try.

Just like that, Yang Ye brought her to the 9th layer of space. Snowy took out her Sprite Staff and started waving it slowly.

The spirit energy in the surroundings started to fluctuate, and then the space throughout the 9th layer of space started to tremble.

A short while later, Yin Yang Goddess suddenly appeared before them. She glanced at Snowy and asked, “What are the two of you up to?”

Yang Ye smiled, “She’s playing!”

The corners of Yin Yang Goddess’ mouth twitched, “Playing?”

Yang Ye nodded and didn’t explain further.

Snowy waved the Sprite Staff, causing the entire 9th layer of space to tremble. Moreover, the spirit energy in the surroundings started to become unusual. It was gradually forming a storm of spirit energy!

Yang Ye had quite a solemn expression on his face.

He didn’t dare to underestimate the storms of spirit energy. Especially when they were under Snowy’s control. They weren’t just spirit energy, they were terrifying.

Yin Yang Goddess’ face gradually turned solemn, and she became absolutely vigilant!

Because she wasn’t sure what the little fellow was up to!

Just like that, Yang Ye and Yin Yang Goddess watched as countless storms of spirit energy converged around Snowy, and the space here shook violently. It seemed like something was invading it!

Yin Yang Goddess couldn’t help but ask, “What is she doing?”

Yang Ye replied, “Playing!”

Yin Yang Goddess was at a loss for words.

Suddenly, space warped around them, and then a powerful mincing force appeared.

Yin Yang Goddess’ expression changed, and she took a step back before pressing her palms out toward her sides. A moment later, the space around her started to be forcibly suppressed.

Sword energy had appeared around Yang Ye too, and they started to suppress the space around him.

At the same time, he had his attention on Snowy as he was worried that something would happen to her.

Suddenly, Snowy gazed at him and waved her paw. She was saying that the space here was instinctively resisting.

Yang Ye nodded, “Can you do anything about it? It’s fine if you can’t!”

Snowy thought for a moment, glanced at the surroundings, and then grunted. She started waving her paws rapidly.

A moment later, small vortices appeared in the surrounding space. No, they were vortices of spirit energy!

At this moment, the spirit energy here was madly devouring this expanse of space!

Obviously, Snowy had chosen to use force!

Yang Ye enveloped himself and Snowy with his Domains as he didn’t dare to be careless right now!

Meanwhile, Yin Yang Goddess had started to move away from them. Her intuition told her that they were very dangerous right now, and it was best to stay away!

Snowy was waving her paws faster and faster, and the spirit energy in the surroundings grew increasingly violent!

Or it should be said that the spirit energy throughout the 9th layer of space had started to act against the space of this world!

They had been coexisting in peace before, but it depended on the situation!

Presently, Snowy was trying to merge them into one so the spirit energy of this world would become its sprite too!

As for the 9th layer of space, it was actually just instinctively resisting!

The spirit energy in the surroundings started to forcibly enter the space of this world, and coupled with Snowy’s control, the space of this world was gradually suppressed.

However, it was still resisting madly!

Snowy frowned. She wondered why it was being so insensible! After all, she was acting in their interest!

With the spirit energy entering the space here, this world would have a sprite, and it would gain new life!

However, the space here was resisting that!

Snowy suddenly gazed at Yang Ye and waved her paw. Great Unknown suddenly shot out of the Primordial Pagoda and arrived before her.

Snowy grabbed Great Unknown and waved her paw swiftly. A moment later, strands of spirit energy entered it, and then Great Unknown shook violently and entered the space in front of Snowy!

Crack!

In an instant, the space in a huge area cracked open!

Great Unknown was acting against it!

Now, the space here backed down!

A moment later, the space here gradually calmed down!

Snowy suddenly waved the Sprite Staff.

Bang!

The entire 9th layer of space shook violently, and then the spirit energy in the surroundings vanished completely!

Everything returned to normal!
