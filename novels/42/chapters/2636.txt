Chapter 2637 – Door!

The Desolate Emperor’s expression changed upon seeing her.

It wasn’t just the Desolate Emperor, the Destiny Realm experts of Eternal Kingdom reacted similarly.

They had naturally not forgotten how terrifying the woman in black had been.

Now, a woman who looked exactly like the woman in black was in front of them!

The Eternal Lord’s eyes had fear and solemness in them, but it was mostly madness in his eyes.

The Desolate Emperor gazed at her with indifference.

She walked slowly to the Desolate Emperor and said, “She said the evil of this world is led by man. I didn’t really agree to that. After all, all things have a good and bad side. There is no absolute good and bad, and everything should be done as nature intended… However, after so many years, countless worlds have vanished, but most of them didn’t vanish naturally, they vanished because of man.”

She glanced at Eternal Kingdom and fell silent for a short while before she gazed at the Desolate Emperor, “The lives of an entire world is that trivial to you?”

The Desolate Emperor grinned, “I didn’t expect you to be someone benevolent. You’re really different from that woman in a black dress!”

The woman in a white dress glanced slowly at the surroundings and said, “See? This world will vanish soon because of your actions. As for the countless living beings here, and especially those without any strength, they will vanish along with this world. Countless lives will vanish!”

The Desolate Emperor smiled, “Are you judging me?”

The woman stopped, “You gave your life to entering Four Dimensional Space and advancing above the Destiny Realm… Here, I’ll show you the true power of Four Dimensional Space.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she raised her sword lightly. In an instant, the space before the Desolate Emperor cracked open, and then a door appeared there.

A strange glow flickered within the door.

Four Dimensional Space!

Countless people were unable to maintain their calm upon seeing the door. Especially the peak Destiny Realm experts like the Eternal Lord and Soul Sect’s master. They were staring at the door of legend.

Their eyes were red with desire!

Yang Ye was merely curious. He really wasn’t interested in Four Dimensional Space.

However, Snowy suddenly appeared on his shoulder. She gazed excitedly at the door and wanted to pull Yang Ye in!

Yang Ye’s face darkened, and he hurriedly stopped her. After all, not just anyone could go through that door!

Snowy gazed at Yang Ye with bewilderment, and then she just kept pointed at the door…

Yang Ye’s face darkened, “We can’t go into that place.”

Snowy blinked and gazed at him with bewilderment in her eyes. She was asking why.

Yang Ye replied quite helplessly, “Because I’m afraid of death!”

Snowy was at a loss for words.

The Desolate Emperor gazed at the door in silence.

The woman smiled, “What? You dedicated your life to entering the Four Dimensional Space, right? Now, you don’t have to kill or use Eternal Kingdom, and you’ll still be able to enter Four Dimensional Space! So, why are you hesitating?”

The Desolate Emperor fell silent for a long time before he walked slowly toward the door.

Suddenly, Huang Xuan spoke, “Eldest Brother…”

The Desolate Emperor stopped and said, “From this moment onward, Huang Yin will be the patriarch of the desolate race. My decision is final.”

He turned to look at Huang Xuan.

Huang Xuan’s expression was quite unsightly.

The Desolate Emperor just stared at him.

A short while passed before Huang Xuan spoke solemnly, “I-I will help him well.”

The Desolate Emperor nodded slightly and gazed at Huang Buer, the previous patriarch of the desolate race.

Huang Buer fell silent for a short while and nodded.

The Desolate Emperor roared with laughter and walked toward the door.

It didn’t take long for him to enter it.

The door didn’t close, but no one could see what was happening beyond it. Because the space there was very strange, and it surpassed their knowledge!

Everyone here stared at the door.

Around 15 minutes later, the door shook, and then the Desolate Emperor walked out from behind it!

At this moment, everyone held their breaths.

The Desolate Emperor gazed at the woman in white, “Why?”

As soon as he said that, his body started to crack open!

Everyone was shocked by this scene!

Meanwhile, Snowy blinked in Yang Ye’s arms. After that, she sneaked back into the Primordial Pagoda. She felt it was best not to go in there!

“HAHA!” The Desolate Emperor roared with laughter, and his laughter carried a strand of desolation. He looked up at the door and said, “Thousands of years of bitter cultivation, a lifelong pursuit, but in the end, it amounted to nothing. Haha! It’s my fault! My fault! Haha!”

Just like that, his body shattered inch by inch, and he vanished before everyone’s eyes.

He was gone!

A great overlord and emperor had vanished from the world just like that!

The surroundings fell silent.

Meanwhile, Huang Buer glanced at the woman in white and said, “Retreat!”

As soon as he gave the order, the desolate race’s army left like a receding tide under his command.

The experts of Eternal Kingdom heaved sighs of relief.

Even though the Desolate Emperor was dead, the desolate race’s overall strength still remained. If they continued to fight, then even if Eternal Kingdom won in the end, it would be a pyrrhic victory!

The desolate race’s retreat was the best outcome they could hope for!

Along with the desolate race’s retreat, Eternal Kingdom’s forces left as well. However, before they left, they made another barrier to seal off Eternal Kingdom again. Obviously, they were worried that the desolate race would return and launch another attack!

Something worth mentioning was that the woman in white didn’t kill the Destiny Realm experts of both sides.

This allowed them to heave huge sighs of relief. If she was just like the woman in black, then they would be absolutely incapable of stopping her!

Yang Ye was about to leave too. However, she suddenly appeared before him.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. It would be a lie to say that he wasn’t worried.

His intuition told him that her strength was probably superior to the woman in black!

Yang Ye remained calm on the outside as he asked, “Can I help you?”

She nodded slightly, glanced at the surroundings, and said, “This world needs to be saved. I need her help, alright?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded, and then he summoned Snowy. Snowy glanced at the woman and stretched out her paw.

The woman grinned and took Snowy’s pawn, “I’m counting on you. You just have to provide the spirit energy. I’ll do the repairing.”

Snowy gazed at Yang Ye, and the latter nodded. A moment later, Snowy opened her mouth, and countless strands of spirit energy appeared within the shattered territory of Eternal Border.

The woman in white’s sword suddenly shot forward. It pierced through the clouds while strands of mysterious energy rippled out of it.

Just like that, Yang Ye watched with astonishment as the almost destroyed Eternal Border was actually repaired bit by bit!

It was no longer within the scope of human power, it was divine power!

It was easy to destroy but difficult to repair!

Meanwhile, the woman suddenly said, “This sword is called Past Life. It represents the inconceivable process of overcoming the shackles from the karma of the past and attaining new life. It possesses indescribably ability, and it just happens to be the exact opposite of your sword.”FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“My sword?” Yang Ye frowned slightly. He withdrew Executor and said, “Wait… This is…?”

She grinned. Heaven Executor belongs to another “me”.

“Why is it called Heaven Executor?” Yang Ye was very puzzled, “Don’t all of you represent the heavens? So you seek to execute yourselves?”

She shook her head and smiled, “You’ve misunderstood.”

Yang Ye said, “Please do tell.”

She glanced at Snowy and said, “A very, very long time ago, when the universe was first formed, the Three Dimensional Space had a consciousness of its own. During that time… Right, you can treat it as a time where the Heaven Dao ruled over the Three Dimensional Space. It didn’t allow the people of this world to cultivate, nor did it allow all living beings to grow. It was the only overlord of this world. It nurtured all things, absorbed all things, and enslaved all things. It was like raising livestock. Once the livestock were mature, they would be slaughtered as nutrition for it!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

The woman glanced at Yang Ye’s sword, “All things grew freely, and many grew stronger and stronger. I was one of them… In the end, what all of you frequently say—defy the heavens—happened. We defied the heavens. During that time, 99% of all living beings perished, and I was one of the few that survived. I killed it with that sword in your hands. So, it’s called Heaven Executor.”

Yang Ye was utterly stunned.

It had completely overturned the way he saw Destiny!

Yang Ye calmed himself and asked, “Then why do you try to kill Erya, Little Qi, and the others?”

The woman in white shook her head slightly, “As a person grows stronger, so does their ambition. At the same time, as they grow stronger, they grow less worried about things. Just like the Desolate Emperor. Once his strength arrived at a certain level, the lives of all other living beings are worthless like the lives of ants to him. If his strength grew even further, even the living beings in the entire Three Dimensional Universe would be worthless to him, and he would eliminate them casually without a second thought, just like the Heaven Dao of the past did. The Heaven Dao of the past could casually take the lives of the myriad of living beings just to improve itself!”

She chuckled at this point and continued, “They say the Heaven Dao is heartless… Actually, the world didn’t become much better once the Heaven Dao was gone. Conversely, without the Heaven Dao there to suppress them, humans and many other living beings became even more unbridled. The saddest part was that they even killed each other. You know… since the ancient times, the number of humans that died at the hands of other humans has accumulated to a figure that’s countless times greater than all the humans killed by the Heaven Dao.”

Yang Ye fell silent.
