Chapter 2705 – Be Careful!

Strongest?

Yang Ye was stunned for a moment and said, “The last one of your forms?”

She nodded.

Yang Ye asked solemnly, “Is she stronger or is Tu stronger?”

The woman in white chuckled, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye replied, “Wasn’t she called the best at fighting among all of you?”

The woman in white shook her head, “She is the best at fighting, but our strongest form’s strength isn’t limited to just fighting… Moreover, let me just put it like this. She is our core, and she has all our abilities, and she has abilities that even we do not have. Besides that, she can make us all merge with her, but we cannot do the same. Understand?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. He naturally understood what she meant.

The strongest form she spoke of was clearly the main body, and to a certain extent, the rest of them were just clones.

Of course, they couldn’t be considered as merely clones.

And the strongest form she spoke of was the true form of Destiny. Of course, the real true form was when all of them were merged into one!

It could be described like that!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Is she easy to deal with?”

The woman in white smiled, “It depends.”

Yang Ye smiled wryly, “How do you think she will treat me?”

She shook her head, “I don’t know. I haven’t spoken to her in a very, very long time, and she doesn’t speak to us either.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “You can be said to be a clone of hers, yet all of you have cultivated to the point of possessing your own consciousnesses. You don’t mind me saying that, right?”

She smiled, “Why would I? We were once a single whole, and we would only be truly whole when we are merged into one.”

Yang Ye felt quite helpless. The relationship between the forms of Destiny was truly too complicated and strange!

Because he could sense that regardless of whether it was the woman in white, the woman in black, or Tu, all of them had their own consciousness, and it could be said that they were independent people!

But they didn’t reject merging together at all!

It was very difficult for him to understand!

He didn’t linger on the issue and asked, “Will she harm Little Qi and Tian Xiu?”

The woman in white nodded slightly, “It’s very likely. Because Little Qi isn’t on good terms with Tu and our strongest form. All those years ago, she fought Tu to the point of almost obliterating the world…”

The woman in white shook her head slightly, “They are irreconcilable enemies, and it is why Tu doesn’t really like you. It’s because you’re close to Little Qi, and she has even taught you in the past. So, as far as Tu is concerned, you’re like Little Qi’s successor.”

Tu!

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “I don’t really like Tu either!”

The woman in white smiled, “But you’re no match for her!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. It was like a stab at his heart!

The woman in white added, “The two of us chose you, and Tu didn’t object either. Such a situation has never occurred. So, you have the greatest chance to stop our strongest form.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’ll go to the border of the Four Dimensional Universe soon.”

She shook her head, “Your strength isn’t sufficient right now. You must rise to the peak of the Destiny Realm. Only then will you barely be able to protect yourself there!”

The peak of the Destiny Realm!

Yang Ye replied, “It isn’t that easy!”

She smiled, “You have the best spirit energy in the world and the best conditions. So, just work hard and the peak of the Destiny Realm won’t be that difficult.”

Yang Ye nodded and seemed to have thought of something at this point, “Besides that, many are hunting me out there. Of course, this isn’t the main point, the main point is they are likely to be targeting all of you!”

The woman in white fell silent.

A long time passed before she spoke softly, “You don’t have to worry about us. As for yourself, we won’t step in and help you. It’s a test for you, so live well!”

Her figure gradually turned ethereal and was about to vanish completely when she added, “Protect Snowy and Erya. We aren’t targeting them because they are with you, and they may be of help to you in the future. Don’t let them become what they used to be. It’s the same for those Destiny Realm experts, win over whoever you can. In short, we can’t interfere right now, but we will be watching you. And be careful of our strongest form, she…”

She vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he shook his head and sighed.

He knew that he really couldn’t escape some responsibilities.

As always, unless he gave up Snowy, Erya, and many things he had, only then could he gain true freedom and be free just like the Unfettered One.

But he couldn’t!

Yang Ye sat down cross-legged and started cultivating.

The peak of the Destiny Realm!

Just as she’d said, he had to attain the peak of the Destiny Realm.

He didn’t know how strong the End World was, and he had to face the strongest form of Destiny. So, if he were being honest, his future felt quite hazy to him.

He stopped thinking about it and focused on the goals at hand. He had to grow stronger, and then go look for Little Qi and Tian Xiu!

…

The End World.

Heng Wangu arrived before a mountain wall, and there was a blood red rock at the bottom of it.

He walked over to the rock and glanced at it, “How much longer?”

A long time passed before a hoarse voice came from it, “Soon.”

Heng Wangu’s eyes narrowed slightly.

Meanwhile, a voice came from the rock again, “I need the Good Sprite and Evil Beast.”

Heng Wangu nodded slightly, “I’ll help you get them!”

The voice said, “Very good!”

Heng Wangu turned around and left.

A short while later, Zuo Mu appeared by his side.

Zuo Mu spoke softly, “I’ve found Emperor Li.”

Heng Wangu asked, “What did he say?”

Zuo Mu shook his head, “I haven’t contacted him. However, he’s a proud person, so I’m afraid he won’t speak to us.”

Heng Wangu fell silent for a short while and said, “I’ll go myself.”

He vanished on the spot.

…

In an underground world.

An Nanjing waved the Dagger-Aze incessantly, and an indistinct shadow was in front of her.

A long time passed before An Nanjing stopped.

The shadow asked, “Do you understand now?”

She shook her head, “Not really!”

The shadow nodded slightly, “Then continue.”

An Nanjing vanished on the spot again.

Her spear shot through the air!

…

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Erya was still cultivating. She was absorbing the second inner core fragment, and it was a long process.

Actually, she could grow one even if she didn’t absorb the fragments, but it would take quite a long time. Conversely, she would grow much faster if she absorbed the inner core fragments!

As for Snowy, her way of life was to cultivate and play at the same time.

Cultivate for a day and play for three days!

She felt that it was the most reasonable schedule. In Yang Lianshuang’s hometown, she learned that the people there would “cultivate” for five or even six days per week, and it made her very, very angry. How could that be called living life?!Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Today was Snowy’s play day.

After taking a stroll around the place Erya was, she went to the trees. There were many, many fruits on the trees, and the Primal True Dragon and the others would get two fruits per month.

Besides that, Snowy had another mission, and it was to improve the swords!

While some of them were actually on par with some Super Divine Treasures, she could still help them improve, but it was slow. Actually, they mostly had to rely on themselves at this level of strength.

Snowy gathered the five element swords, Crimson Sky, the Sword Precursor, and the Sword Supreme.

She placed the Sword Supreme and Sword Precursor behind her. She couldn’t play around with them or she would get beaten for it!

Snowy gazed at the five element swords, Crimson Sky, and the black sword chest.

She scanned the sword chest, and then blew out a huge amount of spirit energy, causing the five element swords to tremble.

A moment later, they flew into the sword chest.

Snowy blinked, cracked a smile, and then left the pagoda with the sword chest. She sensed a formation’s presence within the sword chest and wanted to test its strength!

Meanwhile, Sword Supreme and Sword Precursor appeared before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye frowned, “What’s that little fellow up to now?”

He left the small house and scanned the surroundings with his divine sense. It didn’t take long for him to sense Snowy. She was deep underwater.

Snowy was knocking the sword chest lightly with her paw while countless strands of spirit energy surged into it. But the sword chest didn’t react at all.

A short while later, she blinked and opened her mouth. No sound came from her, but based on the way it moved, she was saying—Don’t be afraid, I’ll protect you.

A short while later, it suddenly shook, and then five different rays of sword energy shot up into the sky.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

In an instant, the entire sea was roiling!

The five swords shot up into the clouds. At this moment, the entire Destiny Dimension’s barrier was destroyed. Moreover, the Five Element Energy they emanated had immediately destroyed the Laws within the Destiny Dimension.

Yang Ye sensed a powerful wave of force was devouring everything, it was devouring this entire Destiny Dimension!

Yang Ye didn’t have the time to think and hurriedly said, “Snowy! Stop right now!”

Deep underwater, Snowy heard Yang Ye, and she knew that she was in trouble!

Snowy looked around, and then she looked down at the sword chest and started waving her paws absolutely swiftly.

She was roughly saying that the sword chest was responsible for everything and it had nothing to do with her.

The sword chest shook violently. It was saying that it wasn’t what Snowy had said earlier!

Snowy blinked, blew a lot of spirit energy into the sword chest, and it immediately calmed down.

Obviously, it planned to take responsibility.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye appeared before Snowy, and the latter blinked before pointing at the sword chest.

The sword chest was stunned.
