Chapter 1262 – Breakthrough!

The black ape was stunned when he saw Yang Ye being slapped flying, and he had a slightly embarrassed expression on his face.

Yang Ye stood up in the distance, and his face was dark as he gazed at the black ape. At this moment, his shoulder was still numb, and if his body wasn’t strong, then just that slap would have probably shattered his shoulder. Because the black ape had clearly been too excited and hadn’t controlled his strength at all.

The black ape chuckled with embarrassment, “Your... your body isn’t bad!”

Yang Ye’s face grew even darker.

Yang Ye didn’t waste time on this matter. He glanced at the centipede and said, “He’s heavily injured while you’ve recovered. Can you keep him busy? I want to absorb the pure energy from the Energy Convergence Pool to improve my strength. Because we can’t let this situation drag on.”

The centipede clearly refused to let the matter rest, so there was only one way that they could leave, and it was to defeat the centipede. The only way to defeat the centipede was to first improve his own strength!

The black ape replied, “I’m probably unable to defeat him, but keeping him busy shouldn’t be a problem. However, you have to hurry up!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Of course!”

The black ape didn’t speak further, and his figure shot towards the centipede.

A ferocious glow immediately flashed into the centipede’s eyes when he saw the black ape charge at him. He didn’t waste his breath and just slammed his fist at the black ape.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The rumbling of battle between the black ape and Ten Thousand Legged Centipede instantly resounded in the distance. Because he was heavily injured while the black ape had recovered completely, the black ape wasn’t suppressed in battle any longer. The black ape was on par with the centipede instead.

It was a battle of attrition!

The victor of the battle would be decided based on which one of them could persist longer!

“The Epoch Realm!” Once he saw that the black ape could fight the centipede equally, Yang Ye took a deep breath and walked to the Void Cloud Shuttle’s control room. The control room was huge, and there was a lounge in the control room. Yang Ye walked towards the lounge, but he suddenly stopped and looked at Yun Banqing who was controlling the Void Cloud Shuttle. He waved his right hand and another 20,000 violet crystals arrived before her, “Use it sparingly. I’m almost broke.”

She nodded, “What if he can’t keep that fellow busy?”

“Run, of course! Run as far as possible!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye entered the lounge.

“Run....” Yun Banqing was stunned, and then a smile curled up on the corners of her mouth as she spoke softly, “If he can fight them, then he fights; if he can’t fight them, then he runs. How interesting....”

...

In the lounge.

Yang Ye used swords to form a pool, and then he poured all the pure energy he obtained within the cave into that pool. Once he was done, he patted his chest and Snowy instantly emerged from there. Her eyes immediately descended onto the pool, and then she started to drool.

After that, she opened her mouth with the intention of absorbing it, but Yang Ye hurriedly covered her mouth.

How could Yang Ye dare to let her do that? If she did, then she would probably suck away all the energy here. Yang Ye rubbed her head gently and spoke softly, “Don’t absorb it. Let’s use it to bathe, alright?”

Snowy blinked, and then she nodded. She practically listened to everything Yang Ye said.

Yang Ye smiled and started to remove his clothes. When Yang Ye finished getting out of his clothes, Snowy’s face instantly flushed red, and then she covered her eyes with her claws.

Yang Ye chuckled as he gazed at her embarrassed reaction, and then he took her in his arms and jumped into the pool. Snowy instantly became excited upon entering the pool, and she couldn’t be bothered to feel embarrassed anymore. She immediately started spinning about through the pool.

Yang Ye noticed that once Snowy entered the pool, the energy within the pool seemed to really like her, and they were surging towards her, causing Snowy to grow even happier.

Yang Ye smiled, and then tapped her head lightly, “I’m going to cultivate. Don’t disturb me for now, understand?”

She blinked, and then nodded.

Yang Ye picked her up and kissed her, and then he slowly closed his eyes. Once his eyes were shut, Yang Ye immersed his consciousness into his body before making the tiny vortex revolve. It didn’t take long for the pure energy to converge towards his body before entering him. However, they weren’t absorbed by the tiny vortex, and they flowed towards every corner of his body instead. In the end, all the pure energy entered his meridians, bones, and skin.

The pure energy was fusing with him!

It was fully fusing with his body and changing his body.

At the same time, Yang Ye’s aura suddenly started to grow stronger.

Time passed slowly, and the pure energy within the pool was gradually reducing.

A day later.

After Yun Banqing shot a beam of blue light at the centipede, her expression had turned solemn. Because after a day of battle, the black ape was gradually falling into a disadvantaged position.

Yun Banqing turned around to glance at the lounge, but there was still no sign of movement from within it.

She shook her head and moved her vision back towards the battle. At this moment, she had to pay attention at all times because her interference was able to significantly reduce the pressure that the black ape experienced. Otherwise, the black ape would probably be defeated even more quickly.

In the lounge, Yang Ye sat cross-legged within the pool created by swords, and the pure energy within the pool was growing lesser and lesser. As for Yang Ye’s skin, it had undergone some changes. At this moment, his skin was faintly glowing like it was some sort of metal. However, it wasn’t very obvious. Moreover, his aura was much stronger than it was yesterday.

Snow was sizing him up incessantly. When she noticed that Yang Ye seemed to be very comfortable as he absorbed the energy around them, she blinked before blowing lightly. In an instant, the pure energy within the pool surged madly towards Yang Ye. At the same time, a strand of pure spirit energy surged out from her mouth before instantly enveloping Yang Ye.

She seemed to feel that this was really fun, so she intermittently sprayed out a strand of pure spirit energy to envelop Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s aura was growing stronger and stronger.

Meanwhile, Yun Banqing’s face was growing more and more solemn. Because the centipede had completely gained the upper hand, and the black ape was being suppressed.

Bang!

Suddenly, a loud explosion resounded from afar, and the black ape was blasted away by the centipede. He flew for over 1km before he finally stopped.

This time, the centipede didn’t attack again, and he said, “Black ape, we’re both from the demon race, so why become enemies with me for a human’s sake?”

The black ape wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and said, “I won’t be enemies with you if you leave!”

“Leave?” The centipede instantly revealed a ferocious expression on his face, “Are you joking? Black ape, I don’t want to take you down with me. Because it’ll bring me no benefit. However, it doesn’t represent that I fear you. Even if I’m injured right now while your strength has grown slightly, you’ll definitely be the one to die if we fight to the death!”

The black ape spoke coldly, “Then I’ll cripple you in the process!”

The centipede gazed at the black ape for a long time before he spoke, “Is it really worth it to fight me to the death for a human?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The black ape replied, “Before this, I was in a similar position as you. I wished for nothing more than to kill him. However, even though he could have fled while we fought earlier, he hadn’t. He came back to help me. Even a human was able to do something like not abandoning his companion before danger, so are you saying that I’m inferior to him?”

Actually, his impression of Yang Ye had changed when Yang Ye hadn’t chosen to flee in the beginning and had come back to help him. At the very least, he felt that while Yang Ye was quite shameless, Yang Ye wasn’t a bad person. Moreover, Yang Ye had healed him earlier, so he’d truly acknowledged Yang Ye.

The centipede gazed at the black ape for a short while and said, “Then there’s nothing to say between us.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the centipede vanished on the spot, and he was before the black ape when his figure appeared once more. The black ape didn’t dare act carelessly, and he roared with fury before slamming his fist at the centipede.

The centipede wasn’t willing to show any weakness, and he similarly slammed his fist forward.

Bang!

The entire sky shook violently from the collision, and the ground below instantly started to collapse. As for the black ape, he was blasted away again. This time, the centipede didn’t stop, and he charged forward and once again slammed his fist down upon the black ape.

Demon beasts usually fought with their fists. Because using the fist was the simplest and most effective method to fight!

The black ape was gradually pushed back repeatedly and was practically incapable of fighting back. As for the centipede, he grew even more frenzied as the battle progressed, and every single one of his punches struck hard.

Yun Banqing’s face became extremely solemn at the sight of this. She turned around to look in the lounge’s direction, but there was still no sign of movement there. It made her heart sink.

In the lounge.

The pure energy within the pool was growing lesser and lesser, and it was almost completely depleted.

As she watched the pure energy grow lesser and lesser, Snowy blinked before hurriedly spitting out more spirit energy. Countless strands of spirit energy surged out before being completely absorbed by Yang Ye.

...

4 hours later.

Bang!

Suddenly, a terrifying aura surged out from within Yang Ye. It was extremely strong and made the entire Void Cloud Shuttle tremble!

The high-rank of the Saint Realm!

Yang Ye had broken through to the high-rank of the Saint Realm!

Yun Banqing was delighted when she noticed the commotion in the lounge, but it didn’t take long for her to frown. Because Yang Ye hadn’t emerged from the lounge.

“What’s going on?” She started walking towards the lounge, but it didn’t take long for her to be blasted away by a strand of aura.

Yun Banqing was stunned.

After Yang Ye attained the high-rank of the Saint Realm, he still remained seated cross-legged within the pool, and his eyes were still closed. However, his aura was growing stronger and stronger, and it was even stronger than when he attained the high-rank of the Saint Realm!

Snowy blinked while happiness filled her eyes, and then she started spitting continuously in succession. Countless strands of pure spirit energy surged out from her mouth. In the end, the entire lounge was filled with pure spirit energy, but she was still spitting more out.... Moreover, she grew increasingly happy as she did it, and she started spitting even more rapidly.

At this moment, she felt that she was helping Yang Ye. So, she was extremely happy and full of enthusiasm.

It wasn’t wrong. She was helping him indeed.

Yang Ye’s aura was growing stronger and stronger.

It didn’t take long for the entire Void Cloud Shuttle to tremble violently.
