Chapter 2726 – Fight!

Come over here!

Emperor Li and the others’ expressions turned extremely unsightly!

Go over there?

What was that fellow up to?

Emperor Li and the others didn’t go forward, and they became quite vigilant instead.

Yang Ye glanced at them and asked, “You’re not coming?”

Emperor Li’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Yang Ye, are you trying to scare us?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Why would I? All of you are wise old geezers, so how could I possibly be able to scare all of you?”

He paused for a moment and continued, “I have a question, why isn’t Heng Wangu with you?”

Emperor Li and the others exchanged glances, and then they suddenly charged at Yang Ye!

Yang Ye was delaying!

Obviously, they’d noticed that Yang Ye was buying time! Since Yang Ye was doing that, it represented that he was definitely seriously injured and not at his prime!

So, they naturally had to attack him with everything they had!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly when he saw them attack, and then a sword appeared in his grasp!

A sword that was different than before!

Past Life, Great Unknown, and Heaven Executor!

All three swords had been merged into one!

Yang Ye twisted his body sideways and swung an angled slash!

Emperor Li was leading the charge, and his expression changed drastically. He crossed his arms before himself and howled with fury while a strand of powerful energy rippled out of his arms!

Hiss!

However, along with a swish, the energy was instantly sliced into bits. After that, Yang Ye’s sword descended and struck the center of Emperor Li’s crossed arms.

Bam!

A figure was instantly blasted around 3km away!

It was Emperor LI!

Meanwhile, as soon as Yang Ye swung his sword, a wave of terrifying energy instantly slammed down at Yang Ye. At practically the exact same moment, a hair-thin strand of saber energy slashed down at his head!

It was absolutely fast!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he stabbed his sword to the right. It instantly stopped the saber energy while First God’s energy slammed against him!

Bang!

Yang Ye was pushed 3km away, and he tore open the space beneath his feet as his figure moved backward!

Suddenly, a figure appeared above him. It was the Sky Saber!

A moment later, a saber emanated a dazzling glow as it slashed down at him!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He took a step back, and the saber just scraped by his nose. It was just a few millimeters away from touching him!

While it had missed, the powerful saber energy contained within the saber blasted Yang Ye’s face open. However, Yang Ye suddenly slashed upward at the moment the saber descended before him.

Sky Saber’s expression changed drastically, but his reaction was extremely fast. He moved sideways and dodged Yang Ye’s lethal attack as well. But right at this moment, Yang Ye suddenly raised his knee and slammed it against Sky Saber’s waist!

Bam!

Sky Saber was blasted away!

But right at the instant Sky Saber was blasted away, the First God suddenly appeared above Yang Ye and stomped down!

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted over 10km away. At the same time, blood kept seeping out of the corner of his mouth while his right arm started trembling violently!

As soon as he stopped himself, Yang Ye’s face changed drastically, and he swung an angled chop with his sword.

A ray of saber energy had arrived before him!

Bam!

A strand of dazzling sword energy and saber energy exploded apart, and Yang Ye was blasted 3km away!

Meanwhile, First God had arrived above Yang Ye. He was about to attack again, but a figure suddenly appeared before him. It was An Nanjing.

An Nanjing tapped her right foot down and shot forward.

First God didn’t dare act carelessly. He gave up on attacking Yang Ye and faced An Nanjing instead!Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

He’d witnessed An Nanjing’s strength in the past, and she wasn’t any inferior to Yang Ye. So, he didn’t dare act carelessly at all!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was fighting Emperor Li, Sky Saber, and Zuo Mu on his own!

One against three!

Yang Ye stood there with his sword in hand while a black sword chest suddenly appeared behind him.

Zuo Mu slowly sheathed his saber, and then he entered into a strange state.

It was like he’d been separated from this world!

Meanwhile, Sky Saber gradually soared up while a wave of terrifying energy converged toward him. A ray of dazzling saber energy appeared on his saber, and it was brighter than the sun!

Two unparalleled saber cultivators!

As for Emperor Li, he slowly clenched his fists. At the instant they were fully clenched, the space here in the 9th layer of space couldn’t endure the energy they contained and instantly cracked open!

Suddenly, a strand of divine sense descended upon Emperor Li.

Emperor Li’s eyes narrowed slightly and turned toward its source. A figure had suddenly appeared there!

It was Yin Yang Goddess!

Yin Yang Goddess spoke coldly, “Bastard! Let’s get even for that slap you gave me the other day!”

When Emperor Li had gone after Yang Ye that day, he’d encountered Yin Yang Goddess in the 9th layer of space. Yin Yang Goddess had suffered a small loss that day, and it was obvious that she still held a grudge for that!

Emperor Li laughed coldly, “Then I’ll kill you first.”

He charged at Yin Yang Goddess.

Yin Yang Goddess laughed coldly and vanished on the spot.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly.

Suddenly, Snowy appeared on his shoulder. She was just about to say something, but Yang Ye grabbed her and tossed her into the Primordial Pagoda!

On the Ascension Platform, Snowy looked up with worry all over her face.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Zuo Mu suddenly leaped up swiftly. He tapped his right foot against space and ripples instantly swept through the space beneath him. A moment later, he drew his saber and swung a vertical slash at Yang Ye from afar!

A cross-shaped beam of saber energy suddenly appeared in the space around Yang Ye.

It obliterated everything before it!

At the same time, Sky Saber suddenly started spinning rapidly, and then strands of saber energy rained down upon Yang Ye like a meteor shower!

At this moment, the entire area was covered in saber energy!

Boundless saber energy!

Suddenly, Yang Ye opened his eyes.

Yang Ye shot backward while the Sword Domain and Slaughter Domain appeared around him. Even the dual Domains couldn’t stop the cross-shaped saber energy, and it was still madly devouring the space before him. At this moment, his sword energy and sword intent were completely devoured, and even with the Sword Domain and Slaughter Domain, it still couldn’t be stopped. The cross-shaped saber energy just refused to let him go and kept chasing after him.

Besides that, countless rays of saber energy were descending behind it!

Finally, Yang Ye stopped.

A sword howl resounded!

A moment later, he turned blood red, and a wave of monstrous slaughter intent and hatred appeared here.

The Demonic Sword Dao!

As soon as Yang Ye entered this state, his sword intent and slaughter intent’s strength rose explosively and forcibly stopped the cross-shaped saber energy!

Meanwhile, he swung his sword rapidly with a single hand.

Hiss! Hiss!

The cross-shaped saber energy was instantly sliced into bits and was obliterated. However, Zuo Mu suddenly appeared before him and swung his saber repeatedly as well!

Meanwhile, five swords shot up into the air from behind Yang Ye< and they transformed into rays of light that slashed at the storm of saber energy Sky Saber had created!

The energy of the five elements emanated by the five swords forcibly stopped the storm of saber energy!

Moreover, the energy of the five elements they emanated affected the world around them, and it didn’t take long for the space in a huge area to start turning ethereal!

But the battle was still going on!

Yang Ye and Zuo Mu were still exchanging blows like madmen!

They were just exchanging blows, and they were completely evenly matched.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing was forcibly keeping First God busy. While she couldn’t defeat him, he couldn’t do anything to her either!

As for the battle between Yin Yang Goddess and Emperor Li. While she was at a disadvantage, she was keeping him busy too! Otherwise, if Emperor Li joined forces with the others, Yang Ye would have no chance to win!

Bam!

Suddenly, two figures split apart, and then Yang Ye and Zuo Mu were instantly over 10km away from each other!

Yang Ye’s entire body was blood red, and his sword was trembling violently!

Meanwhile, Zuo Mu’s entire body was covered by sword energy. While they were only flesh wounds, it was still extremely terrifying. Because there were at least 100 injuries on him!

After Yang Ye used the Sword Dao of Hatred, Zuo Mu noticed that he actually felt a little powerless before Yang Ye!

Bang!

Suddenly, explosions resounded above. Yang Ye looked up and saw the five element swords being blasted away by Sky Saber!

Yang Ye issued a command in his heart, and then the swords transformed into rays of light that returned to the sword chest on his back!

Meanwhile, Zuo Mu suddenly dashed toward him.

Zuo Mu’s saber left its sheath!

Yang Ye remained composed. He swung an angled slash at Zuo Mu and collided with that attack in the most violent manner!

It was extremely violent!

Bang!

They immediately split apart by over 3km in distance!

Yang Ye’s right hand was shaking, and blood was ceaselessly seeping out of his shoulder. Meanwhile, Zuo Mu’s saber was covered in cracks!

It had cracked open!

Zuo Mu stroked his saber gently in silence.

In the end, his saber failed to resist the three swords of Destiny that had been merged into one!

After all, his saber wasn’t an Ordinary Saber!

Zuo Mu sheathed it slowly and put it on his back. After that, he gazed at Sky Saber, and they nodded at each other. A moment later, they shot at Yang Ye!

They didn’t choose to fight Yang Ye one-on-one. It wasn’t that they were definitely incapable of defeating him in single combat, it was that they had to kill Yang Ye!

They were here to kill, not to spar!

Moreover, even Zuo Mu wasn’t confident in being able to defeat Yang Ye in single combat right now!

Yang Ye remained calm when he saw them charge at him. However, the sword intent around him was extremely violent. His current Sword Dao was one at an extreme, and his sword intent and slaughter intent were at extremes as well!

Zuo Mu was the first to arrive. While he didn’t have his saber anymore, he was still a matchless saber cultivator. He was still a saber cultivator even without a saber!

Zuo Mu used his hand as a saber, and an ethereal saber condensed into form around his arm. He was just about to raise his arm and slash at Yang Ye when the five element swords on Yang Ye”s back appeared in Yang Ye’s grasp.

A moment later, they merged into one!

Obviously, they had done so under Snowy’s instructions!

Zuo Mu and Sky Saber immediately stopped and retreated by around 1km!

The five swords had merged into one!

Yang Ye’s expression changed as well. Because he noticed that he couldn’t control the energy of the five elements the sword emanated upon merging into one.

Just controlling the merged sword of Destiny was quite strenuous for him, and it was even when all three swords were cooperating with him. Yet now, he had these five swords that had merged into one, so it was utterly too much for him!

Zuo Mu suddenly said, “Retreat!”

First God pushed An Nanjing back, and then he immediately retreated to Zuo Mu and Sky Saber’s side. At the same time, Emperor Li returned to their side too.

Emperor Li spoke ferociously, “Why do you want to retreat? You go deal with that fellow, I’ll deal with him!”

Once he finished speaking, he charged at Yang Ye!
