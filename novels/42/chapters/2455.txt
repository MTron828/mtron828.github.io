Chapter 2456 – The Village!

Yang Ye left the Nanli Clan.

Only Nanli Meng remained in the guest hall.

She sat on a chair and sipped the high quality tea here. Meanwhile, Nanli Yin walked in.

Nanli Yin sat before Nanli Meng, “He isn’t willing to take Eternal Border’s side?”

Nanli Meng replied indifferently, “Would you be willing to do so if you were in his shoes?”

Nanli Yin fell silent for a short while and said, “Based on his current strength, his presence on our side would give Eternal Border a greater amount of sway on things.”

Nanli Meng shook her head, “I know his character well. He won’t take Eternal Border’s side.”

Nanli Yin gazed at her, “Then why did you try to persuade him?”

Nanli Meng stood up and looked at the sky outside. There was a white cloud there, “I grew up here!”

Nanli Yin spoke gloomily, “Now, our Nanli Clan has one path left to it, and it’s to side with Eternal Kingdom!”

Nanli Meng shook her head.

Nanli Yin frowned, “Why?”

Nanli Meng glanced at her, “Eternal Kingdom just wants to use the people of Eternal Border. I’m sure you’re aware of that. We’ll die even faster if we take their side!”

Nanli Yin spoke solemnly, “Then what do you want to do?”

Nanli Meng replied indifferently, “My Nanli Clan won’t take any sides!”

Nanli Yin shook her head, “That won’t work. Once the desolate race and Eternal Kingdom enter into battle, Eternal Border will definitely be affected. At that time, if we still haven’t taken sides, then we’ll be hated by both. I’m sure you understand that!”

Nanli Meng sighed softly, “Ancestor, I know you’re at your own limits, and Eternal Kingdom is your last hope to advance further. I won’t stop you, but don’t interfere in the Nanli Clan’s business. Alright?”

Nanli Yin looked her in the eyes, “What are you trying to say?”

Nanli Meng walked over to Nanli Yin, “I mean that I’m in charge of the Nanli Clan now, and I wouldn’t even care about the Nanli Clan if it wasn’t for my father. He gave his life to the Nanli Clan, so I don’t want it to vanish from this world. I’ll say it one last time, you have the right to choose, and I won’t stop you from siding with anyone. However, the Nanli Clan won’t follow you.”

Nanli Meng left the room once she finished speaking, and Nanli Yin’s face was terrifyingly gloomy.

Her weight alone was limited. Only by bringing along the entire Nanli Clan could she make Eternal Kingdom take her seriously and possess some status! Yet now, the Nanli Clan wasn’t under her control anymore!

…

Once he left the Nanli Clan, Yang Ye went to the entrance of Eternal Village.

It was concealed by a barrier, and it would only show itself at specific moments in time. However, his current strength was sufficient to break through the barrier.

Yang Ye drew his sword and swung it at the entrance.

Hiss!

A wave of sword energy flashed.

It didn’t take long for the space before him to tremble violently, and then something seemed to vanish there. Another short while later, a boundless mountain range appeared within Yang Ye’s field of vision!

Eternal Secret Realm!

Yang Ye grinned and walked off into the distance. Meanwhile, Erya, Oxxy, and Snowy appeared here.

Erya had a brilliant smile on her face. This was her home! Before this, she really hated this place because she’d gotten bored of it. But after she left, she really missed this place.

As for Oxxy, it was obvious that he really missed this place too!

Erya placed her hands by her mouth and shouted, “Grandpa! I’m home!”

She ran off ahead once she finished speaking.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Yang Ye smiled and followed her.

“Big Brother Yang!” Suddenly, Erya’s sharp cry resounded from afar!

Yang Ye’s expression changed, and he transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

At the entrance of the village, Yang Ye stood there with a pale countenance. There was a trace of terror in his eyes. The village was gone, and only the ruins of a village remained before him!

“Grandpa!” Erya ran over to the ruins and shouted madly while ceaselessly digging up the ruins. Tears were pouring out of her eyes.

At this moment, Erya wasn’t a mysterious demon anymore, she was just a young girl!

What happened?

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings with a slightly blank expression.

Suddenly, there was some trembling coming from the side!

Yang Ye looked over and waved his right hand, causing the area there to be cleared up. It didn’t take long for him to see a figure.

Butcher!

A figure was lying there, Butcher’s figure! However, Butcher’s body was in a mess… If he didn’t have half of his face intact, even Yang Ye wouldn’t be able to recognize him!

Yang Ye walked over, and an ethereal soul remnant floated out of Butcher’s body.

A soul remnant!

It was a severely damaged soul remnant, and it couldn’t even be described as a soul.

Butcher glanced at Yang Ye and grinned, “I may not have been able to last if you didn’t get here soon!”

Yang Ye spoke in a trembling voice, “W-What happened?”

Butcher shook his head, “People from Eternal Kingdom came here.”

Eternal Kingdom!

Yang Ye spoke ferociously, “Eternal Kingdom? Why? Why would they attack all of you?”

Butcher shook his head, “That isn’t the main point! Kid, tell me the truth, do you have a Sprite Progenitor?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Butcher sighed when he saw Yang Ye admit it, “I didn’t expect you to really have a Sprite Progenitor!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Master, tell me what happened here!”

Master!

Butcher glanced at him with complicated emotions in his eyes, “Kid, I know you’re a sword cultivator and the saber was just a means for you to perfect your own Sword Dao. Promise me that if you meet someone good, then pass down my sect’s techniques to that person. Otherwise, my sect would go extinct once you focus solely on the sword.”

Yang Ye replied, “Why did they attack you?”

Butcher fell silent for a short while and said, “A short while ago, three people came to Eternal Village. They claimed to be from Eternal Kingdom, and they wanted us to submit to them. In return, they would allow us to enter Eternal Kingdom.”

Butcher laughed bitterly, “That was a good thing. After all, we could leave this place and go to Eternal Kingdom. We had no reason to refuse!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Then why did they attack?”

Butcher laughed bitterly, “I asked if we could bring someone with us, and they agreed. However, that person must be sufficiently strong or possess sufficient talent.”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, “You asked them about me, right?”

Butcher nodded, “But I never expected their expressions to change upon hearing your name, and then they attacked us. While they were Four World Realm experts too, I could sense that they were suppressing their cultivations and were actually at the Five World Realm!”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “They killed you just because you know me?”

Butcher laughed bitterly, “They said that you’ve gone to the desolate race and colluded with them. So, Eternal Kingdom has issued the highest warrant for you. Anyone linked to you must die.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “They are roping in the experts of Eternal Border, and Nine Hells Emperor has joined them. Besides that, some of the powerful demon beasts in the mountain range have left with them too. Even the Spirit of the Seal here left with them. I’m afraid Eternal Village isn’t their only target, and they are roping in the experts of the other worlds too. So, be careful!”

“Butcher!” Suddenly, Erya walked over to Butcher, “Did they kill my Grandpa too?”

Tears kept flowing out of Erya’s eyes.

Butcher glanced at her and sighed softly, and he hesitated for a moment before nodding.

Actually, the old man had died for her, but he didn’t want her to live a life of guilt. There were some heavy burdens, especially mental burdens, that could crush someone. Erya shouldn’t shoulder such a burden! Moreover, even if the old man was still alive, he probably wouldn’t have escaped this calamity.

Erya wiped off the tears on her face, “They killed all of you just because you know Big Brother Yang?”

Butcher sighed softly, “This world is one where being weak means you deserve death. As for reasons, they are actually meaningless. The true reason is that we were weak and were no match for them, so we deserved death. You must work hard to grow stronger, so strong that no one will dare to bully you. Understand?”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “You must understand the situation you’re in. They plan to take revenge on you, or perhaps they are trying to make an example of you. They are telling the world what happens if they go against Eternal Kingdom. They are making a show of strength with you.”

Butcher’s figure grew more and more ethereal.

Right when he was about to vanish completely, he seemed to have thought of something and added, “Bury all three of us together, or we will be lonely. While we don’t have a next life, being able to stay together in this life does leave us with no regrets. And don’t feel guilty!”

Butcher’s figure vanished completely.

Yang Ye’s face was exceptionally calm, and he found the other two corpses in the ruins.

It was Auntie Vege and the slovenly old man.

Their bodies were mangled and difficult to recognize!

Yang Ye buried them in a row within the Primordial Pagoda, and then he knelt down slowly before them.

Bai Zhixian was by his side.

Bai Zhixian knelt there with him, and they just knelt there.

Suddenly, Erya ran over to Yang Ye’s side and spoke in a trembling voice, “Big Brother Yang, I-I can’t find Grandpa’s corpse. T-They definitely ate him. I-I’m going to eat them all! I-I’m going to avenge Grandpa, Butcher, and everyone else in the village. AH! Why did they have to kill Grandpa and the others, why did they have to kill everyone in the village?! They even killed Rainy and Eggsy! They’re so cruel!”

She knelt on the ground and wept, “Why are humans so cruel?!”
