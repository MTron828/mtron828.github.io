Chapter 1391 – You Can’t Do This To Me!

However, it didn’t take long for the man’s face to stiffen.

Because Yang Ye was looking at him, and Yang Ye seemed like he was looking at an idiot.

Nether Maiden was stunned as well. Because Yang Ye was completely fine. She heaved a sigh of relief in her heart, glanced at Yang Ye, and then turned around and shot at Jin Xiu and the others who were in pursuit of her.

The pig-riding young woman glanced at Yang Ye as well, and she muttered, “That fellow... is really mysterious....” As soon as she finished speaking, she paid no further attention to Yang Ye and swung her saber at Lian Suyao’s group.

What was going on?

How was Yang Ye completely fine?

Yang Ye was naturally fine. At the moment the Soul Beast had entered his body, it had been instantly shattered by the Primordial Pagoda, and then it was transformed into strands of energy that entered Xiao Qi’s body in the 2nd level. Once the energy entered her body, while she still hadn’t woken up, there had been some changes in her body and countenance.

How is he still fine? The black robed man’s mind was filled with questions. Suddenly, his eyes opened wide, “However could this be possible? The link between me and my Soul Beast is gone! How could this be possible? How could this be possible?!”

As he finished speaking, he was practically howling.

Yang Ye withdrew some divine crystals, swallowed them, and then spoke indifferently, “Your Soul Beast said that my bones are unique, and I’m a peerless genius, so it decided to stay with me.”

“Nonsense!” The black robed man roared with fury, “I nurtured it with my soul for over 3,600 years. It’s one with my mind and body, and it acknowledged me as its master a long time ago. How could it possibly abandon me and side with you?”

3,600 years! Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. That was long.

Actually, he wasn’t actually gambling when he allowed it to enter his body. Because he was very confident in the Primordial Pagoda. Not to mention the Soul Beast, even Qiong Qi probably couldn’t escape once he entered the Primordial Pagoda. After all, it had forcefully sealed Qiong Qi while it was still injured, and Qiong Qi was extremely afraid of it.

So, if the Soul Beast entered his body, it was actually not different than giving its life away.

“Yang Ye!” Meanwhile, the black robed man suddenly howled with fury, “What have you done to it?!”

Yang Ye withdrew more divine crystals, swallowed them, and then spoke indifferently, “Nothing much. At the very least, it’s fine for now. However, I don’t know what’ll happen to it later.”

The black robed man heaved a sigh of relief when he heard Yang Ye. It’s fine so long as my Soul Beast is still alive.

He was from the large world. He’d found that Soul Beast by chance while he was young, and it was his final trump card. If he lost the Soul Beast, then his strength would plummet. Moreover, his worth would plummet as well.

If that happened, his status in his sect would plummet as well!

So long as it wasn’t annihilated, he still had a chance!

The black robed man remained silent for a moment, and then he said, “Yang Ye, release it and I’ll spare your life!”

“Spare me?” A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “Do you think I’m a fool, or are you a fool?”

The black robed man spoke in a low voice, “What do you want?!”

Yang Ye replied, “Actually, it’s very simple. I just want you to tell me a few things, and then I’ll return it to you.”

He would naturally not say something like he would let the black robed man leave. After all, that wasn’t realistic at all. The black robed man had come from the large world, and it was impossible that the black robed man would leave without accomplishing his objective. Moreover, even if the black robed man agreed to leave, Yang Ye wouldn’t believe him.

So, it was better to just buy time.

The black robed man spoke in a slightly questioning tone, “That simple?”

“Indeed!” Yang Ye continued, “So long as you tell me what I want to know, I’ll give it back to you. I will absolutely not go back on my word!”

“Alright, go on.” The black robed man quickly agreed. Yang Ye was a sword cultivator, and he was a formidable sword cultivator as well. Such people usually disdained to lie. Since Yang Ye had agreed to return it to him, Yang Ye should do so. Of course, the main reason he’d agreed was that he had no other choice.

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Besides the permits, are there other ways to enter the large world?”

He was definitely going there because Zi’er and Snowy were in the Divine Phoenix Clan. However, he didn’t know how to get up there. The permit? If he wanted a permit, then he would have to kill Nether Maiden and the others. Not to mention that he didn’t have the strength to accomplish that, he wouldn’t do it even if he had the strength.

As for his own head, that was even more impossible.

The black robed man spoke in a low voice, “You want to enter the large world!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I really want to. So, tell me if there are other ways to get there.”

The black robed man remained silent for a long while before he spoke, “There’s a spatial passageway at the end of the sky. It leads to the large world. However, there are experts guarding it. You have 3 choices. The 1st is to use a permit. The 2nd is to make the power you represent meet the required standards. In other words, you have to possess control over 100 plus worlds, and 10 medium worlds. Only then will the large world send you an invitation to enter the large world. As for the 3rd choice....”

He paused for a moment at this point, and then he continued, “The 3rd choice is to fight your way up there!”

Fight his way up there!

Yang Ye frowned. The 1st option was definitely impossible. He had no permits. As for the 2nd, if he was given the time, he had the chance to meet the requirements. However, taking control over 100 plus worlds would definitely take a huge amount of time. He couldn’t wait until then!

The 3rd!

He could only choose the 3rd!

The black robed man seemed to know what Yang Ye was thinking and said, “You intend to fight your way up there?”

Yang Ye glanced at him and replied, “That’s what I intend to do for now.”

“You’re overestimating your ability!” The black robed man continued, “From time immemorial, less than 5 have ever fought their way up into the large world. In the last tens of thousands of years, only 2 have succeeded in doing so.”

Yang Ye was quite curious, “Which two?”

The black robed man replied, “Someone called Jian Wuji. He broke through the Heavenpath with just his sword. Once he arrived at the large world, he established the Sword God’s Pavilion. All those years ago, he was reputed to be the number one sword cultivator from the lower dimensions in the last tens of thousands of years. However, it didn’t take long for that title to be disputed.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

The black robed man answered, “Because someone else broke through the Heavenpath not long after him. Moreover, that person was a sword cultivator too, and he’d used a shorter amount of time to get through the Heavenpath!”

Yang Ye asked, “His name was the Unfettered One, right?”

The black robed man was surprised, “How did you know?”

It really was that fellow! The Unfettered One!

That name was naturally not unfamiliar to Yang Ye. Since his time on Profounder Continent, Yang Ye had constantly heard about the Unfettered One. He was very curious about the Unfettered One. Because there was a faint link between him and the Unfettered One. After all, the Sword Sect had been established by the Unfettered One, and the Sword Sect’s current master was his wife!

Moreover, he’d been part of the Sword Sect in the past!

Meanwhile, the black robed man continued, “After Jian Wuji arrived at the large world, the 1st thing he did was visit all the sword cultivators there. Even though he paid them a visit, he was actually challenging them. However, he would send his greetings before he challenged every sword cultivator. So, even if they lost, they wouldn’t feel any ill intent towards him. Conversely, many of them even became friends with him.”

The black robed man fell silent at this point, and he only continued a while later, “Once that fellow called the Unfettered One arrived at the large world, the 1st thing he did was around the same as Jian Wuji, but the method he used was very different. He’d immediately gone to challenge all the renowned sword cultivating sects in the large world, and every time he defeated them, he would even say that they weren’t strong enough. So, his reputation in the large world wasn’t very good. However, it didn’t take long for him to vanish.”

“He vanished?” Yang Ye asked, “Where did he go?”

The black robed man shook his head, “I don’t know. In any case, no one saw him challenging anyone else after that. Perhaps it was because he’d fought all of them.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Meanwhile, the black robed man said, “I’ve told you what I know. Now, it’s your turn to fulfil your promise.”

“My promise?” Yang Ye was stunned and asked, “What promise?”

The black robed man’s voice became cold, “Are you planning on going back on your word?”

“You’re talking about your Soul Beast!” Yang Ye nodded and said, “I would never go back on my word, of course. Am I a person like that? I told you that you have to answer my questions before I return it to you. But I’m not done.”

The black robed man said, “Then hurry up!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “There’s a question that has been troubling me for a very long time, and I’ve never gotten an answer to it. You’re from the large world, so you possess extensive knowledge and will definitely be able to answer it for me. Right, the question is how many stars are there in our universe? This question is very simple for you, right?”

The black clothed man felt speechless.

“You don’t know?” Yang Ye continued, “If you don’t know, then I can’t return the Soul Beast to you. See, you haven’t fulfilled my request, so I’m not going back on my word!”

“How utterly shameless!” The black robed man roared with fury. At this moment, he naturally understood that Yang Ye had been buying time from the very beginning. So he didn’t waste his breath again and was about to attack.

Bang!

Suddenly, a loud explosion resounded from below, and then a strand of resentment suddenly shot up into the sky. As soon as the resentment appeared, the space in an area of almost 5,000km instantly started to ripple violently as if an earthquake was rumbling through it. At the same time, the entire sky was suddenly covered in dark clouds.

Everyone here was shocked, including Yang Ye.

All of them looked down. The area below was filled by boundless resentment, baleful energy, and slaughter intent that surged up incessantly towards the sky. Their minds were almost corrupted by it. They hurriedly moved backwards and circulated their profound energy to protect themselves.

“Get down here now! All of you! Hurry!” Boundary Maiden’s anxious voice came from below. Her voice wasn’t just anxious, it was even trembling slightly.

What are they doing? Yang Ye had a puzzled expression on his face.

Meanwhile, Nether Maiden and the pig-riding young woman didn’t hesitate to shoot down.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Suddenly, Nether Maiden appeared by Yang Ye’s side. At this moment, she had an extremely solemn expression on her face, and her countenance was even slightly pale, “She’s very important to us. Extremely important. Even if we die, we can’t allow anything to happen to her. So, we have to head down there. As for here... I have to entrust it to you! Please!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Nether Maiden flashed down there.

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Suddenly, numerous formidable auras appeared in the sky above the Radiant Dimension, and these auras were approaching rapidly.

More were here!

Yang Ye turned to look at the black robed man, Lian Suyao, and the others. He gulped and said, “While we know each other well, but... you can’t throw me in such a pit of fire!”
