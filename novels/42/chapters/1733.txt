Chapter 1734 - There’s Something Down There!

There were an entire 35 rotting corpses before them!

!

Yang Ye and Ku Zhuyi’s scalps couldn’t help but feel numb when faced with such a number. After all, just a single rotting corpse had been quite difficult to deal with for them, let alone 35!

They didn’t think about why there were so many rotting corpses here because they didn’t have the time to think.

Flee!

Flee immediately!

That was what ran through their minds at this moment, and it was what they did. They didn’t hesitate to turn around and flee.

At the moment he saw those 35 corpses, Yang Ye knew that he couldn’t deal with them even if he drew his sword. Because every single one of them was extremely terrifying, and it would be difficult to instantly kill them even if he used the wooden sword!

Perhaps two successive attacks would be able to kill them. But he didn’t have that much profound energy to last that many attacks!

Flee!

At this moment, Yang Ye and Ku Zhuyi raised their speed to their limits. However, Ku Zhuyi’s speed was limited, so the rotting corpses were getting closer and closer to her. When they were about to catch up to her, Yang Ye suddenly appeared in front of her.

Yang Ye disregarded everything and just wrapped his left arm around her waist, and then he stomped his right foot down. He relied on the counterforce to shoot forward like a cannonball with her.

Ku Zhuyi’s body had stiffened slightly. She was clearly not used to this, but she didn’t resist.

Yang Ye’s speed decreased when bringing someone along with him, but it was still faster than the rotting corpses. Just like that, the distance between them and the corpses grew greater and greater.

However, the rotting corpses behind them were still pursuing them and showed no signs of giving up!

Both of their faces grew even more unsightly when they noticed this.

Suddenly, Ku Zhuyi exclaimed while pointing towards the distance, “Look!”

Yang Ye looked over. There was an ancient city not too far ahead of them. Yang Ye was delighted by the sight of it and sped up.

They grew closer and closer to the city. They were about to enter it when a huge barrier of light appeared around the city, and a beam of dazzling light surged out from it and shot in their direction.

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly. He released Ku Zhuyi and slammed his left fist forward.

Boom!

The beam of light shattered while both Yang Ye and Ku Zhuyi were blasted to the ground.

Suddenly, a group appeared on the city walls.

The man who led the group was a familiar face to Yang Ye. It was none other than Ying Mu.

Ying Mu glanced at Yang Ye and Ku Zhuyi, “So it’s the Ku Clan.”

Ku Zhuyi cupped her fist in Ying Mu’s direction and said, “Brother Ying, please deactivate the formations and let us enter the city!”

“Deactivate the formation?” Ying Mu laughed coldly, “Sorry, I can’t!”

Ku Zhuyi frowned, “Why?”

Ying Mu spoke indifferently, “Because those rotting corpses are behind both of you.”

Ku Zhuyi spoke in a low voice, “Brother Ying, it’ll take them ten breaths of time to get here. We have more than enough time if you deactivate the formation now.”

Ying Mu grinned, “Young girl from the Ku Clan, I’ve always heard that the Ku Clan is very mysterious, but we’ve never known what’s mysterious about your Ku Clan. Why don’t you widen our horizons today?”

Ku Zhuyi’s face fell.

At this moment, how could she not understand what he meant? Actually, it was normal. Even though the Ying Clan held the title of number one clan in the medium universe of the Milky Way System, everyone felt that the Ku Clan wasn’t inferior to the Ying Clan.

Even though they hadn’t openly entered into conflict with each other, they did fight each other in secret.

Actually, to be precise, all the eight clans fought each other in secret.

Meanwhile, the rotting corpses had arrived just 3km behind Yang Ye and Ku Zhuyi. Based on their speed, it would only take three breaths of time for them to arrive before Yang Ye and Ku Zhuyi.

Ku Zhuyi intended to reason with Ying Mu, but Yang Ye waved his hand in her direction. He looked up at Ying Mu and said, “Little Bastard, I’ll ask you one last time. Will you deactivate the formation or not?!”

Ying Mu’s face fell. A wisp of ghastly killing intent flashed through his eyes, “Say that one more time?”

Yang Ye didn’t speak. He just wrapped his left arm around Ku Zhuyi’s waist and flashed over to the city wall. After that, he let her go, and then he placed his left palm on the city gates.

As soon as Yang Ye’s palm was placed on the city gates, a thin barrier of light instantly appeared on it. However, as soon as it appeared, it was corroded by a strand of mysterious force and turned ethereal!

The Laws of Decay!

The barrier of light grew more and more ethereal while being corroded by the Laws of Decay. A moment later, the barrier of light on the city gates vanished completely.

As soon as that happened, Yang Ye clenched his left fist and slammed it forward.

Boom!

The city gate shattered, and then Yang Ye and Ku Zhuyi entered the city.

However, they hadn’t noticed that the rotting corpses had stopped a short distance before the city. The vicious gaze in their eyes was transformed into fear when they looked at the city. It didn’t take long for Ying Mu and the others to watch with astonishment as the rotting corpses actually retreated slowly, and it didn’t take long for the rotting corpses to vanish from their fields of vision.

Ying Mu and the others exchanged glances when they witnessed this, and they saw bewilderment in all their eyes,

Meanwhile, Ying Mu suddenly said, “Everyone, I’m sure you’re realized that this abode is filled with danger. We’ll only be able to survive by working together. So, I suggest that we stay united. What do you think?”

The others exchanged glances and nodded.

Everyone capable of coming here was no fool, and their strength was beyond doubt. After all, how could someone without sufficient strength dare to come here?

There were at least over 50 people here. If they joined forces, they were even capable of going head on with the group of rotting corpses from before.

A man suddenly asked, “Brother Ying, what should we do now?”

The others gazed at Ying Mu as well.

Ying Mu wasn’t just the successor of the Ying Clan, he was the number two expert on the Milky Way Rankings. So, he fully deserved to be their leader.

Ying Mu glanced at the surroundings and said, “Forget those corpses for now. Let’s hide and wait for dawn!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure vanished on the spot, and the others quickly followed him.

After they entered the city, Yang Ye noticed that the city was extremely quiet, or it should be described as deathly silent. Besides Ying Mu’s group from before, he didn’t see another soul here.

As for why the corpses hadn’t followed them, both Yang Ye and Ku Zhuyi were puzzled. However, they didn’t think too much about it and just found a place to hide.

In a run down old hall, Yang Ye and Ku Zhuyi sat cross-legged. Yang Ye withdrew an Energy Pearl and flicked it over to her. She glanced at it, didn’t say a word, and just swallowed it.

Yang Ye smiled, “You’re not afraid it’s poisoned?”

Ku Zhuyi glanced at Yang Ye, “If you intended to harm me, you could have just left me there, and I would have died.”

Yang Ye chuckled and spoke seriously, “Right, you’re the only one representing the Ku Clan?”

She asked, “What do you actually want to know?”

Yang Ye replied, “You’re probably not the strongest in the Ku Clan, right?”

Ku Zhuyi shook her head, “My older brother is the strongest in the Ku Clan’s younger generation. However, he’s charging into the 2nd stage of the True Realm. So, he couldn’t come.” She paused for a moment and continued, “I didn’t expect this place to be so dangerous!”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “Neither did I!”

This place was quite terrifying indeed. Even True Realm experts would probably not dare to face those rotting corpses head-on, and the most terrifying part was that there were so many of them here!

Ku Zhuyi suddenly asked, “Which clan are you from?”

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, glanced at her, and spoke indifferently, “I’m just an independent cultivator!”

An independent cultivator!

She glanced at him and was about to speak when Yang Ye said, “Forget that for now. Recover your profound energy first.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he withdrew two Energy Pearls and consumed them, and then he closed his eyes.

After he saw those rotting corpses, Yang Ye didn’t dare to act carelessly in the slightest. In the beginning, he’d felt that there probably wasn’t anything in this place that could harm him. After all, he was quite confident in his own strength.

But now, he knew that if he still maintained such thoughts, then he wouldn’t be far from death.

Because besides having to be careful of those rotting corpses, he still had to be careful of the other cultivators in this damnable place.

Sometimes, men were more terrifying than those rotting corpses.

Time trickled by. Yang Ye’s profound energy had almost completely recovered. He glanced at Ku Zhuyi, and he saw that she was staring at him.

Yang Ye asked, “What?”

She replied, “Do we know each other?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

She frowned slightly, “Then why do you feel very familiar to me?!”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “It might be a misconception!”

Ku Zhuyi was about to speak when the ground suddenly trembled. They exchanged glances, and then they vanished on the spot.

After they left the hall, they glanced at the surroundings. There was nothing in the surroundings, but the ground was still trembling.

It was late at night. Even though the surroundings were illuminated by moonlight, it still seemed extremely mysterious.

Yang Ye gazed at the ground for a long time before he said, “There’s something down there!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Ku Zhuyi nodded with agreement.

Suddenly, their expressions changed, and they immediately soared into the air. Once they arrived in midair, numerous pairs of hands suddenly emerged from the ground, and all of them were blood red!
