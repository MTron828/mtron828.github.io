Chapter 1284 – You’ve Never Touched SuChapter A Huge Pair, Right?

Actually, Yang Ye had hesitated to save her. Because under such circumstances, the slightest mistake wouldn’t just cause him to fail, he might lose his life as well. After all, there were 7 Voiders there while one was even a living fossil. Such a force was something he couldn’t resist right now.

But he’d chosen to save her in the end. There had been 2 reasons why he’d taken such a risk to save her. Firstly, it was the principle — an enemy of my enemy is my friend. Those fellows from the Veiled Region refused to spare her, and they treated her as their enemy. If he thought about it from that angle, then both of them had a common enemy. Since they had a common enemy, they naturally had a chance to work together.

Secondly, it was because he had to divert the attention of those fellows from the Veiled Region. If they refused to give up pursuing him, then even if they couldn’t catch him, he wouldn’t have time to do anything else. He had to create some time and space for himself to breathe. So, he had to divert their attention, but where would he divert their attention to? The Slayer Pavilion, of course!

After all, they weren’t aware of the Slayer Pavilion’s master’s death. So, when compared to him, the Slayer Pavilion was a much larger threat to them.

He’d succeeded!

Qian Lankong stared fixedly at Yang Ye in silence. She naturally wouldn’t speak because there was nothing to say. Beg Yang Ye to save her? She wasn’t able to make herself do that. When she parted ways with Yang Ye earlier, she’d said that she didn’t want to see him again. Yet now, they met once more. However, it was in such a way. In short, the emotions she felt were extremely complicated.

Yang Ye sized her up. Needless to say, her figure was very good. Moreover, many parts of her body were exposed to the point large patches of snow white could be seen. Especially her faintly visible chest, it was truly visually stunning.

When she noticed Yang Ye sizing her up, her face became cold, “Have you not seen a woman before?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and smiled, “Miss Qian, you wouldn’t mind me removing your clothes, right?”

She closed her eyes slightly while killing intent flashed within them, and then a dagger appeared in her grasp. Suddenly, Yang Ye’s hand pressed down upon her hand, and he smiled, “Miss Qian, you’re very heavily injured, so it’s best not to utilize your profound energy and strength. Otherwise, you’ll die. After all, you don’t have a body as strong as mine.”

Qian Lankong’s hand was instantly immobilized when Yang Ye pressed down upon it. She gazed at Yang Ye and knew she didn’t have the ability to resist him at all. A wisp of ridicule immediately curled up on the corners of her mouth, “So what if I mind? Now, not to mention removing my clothes, I wouldn’t have a choice even if you want to force yourself on me, right?”

Yang Ye gazed at her and smiled, “Then I’ll be taking it off. You agreed to it!”

She stared fixedly at him in silence.

Yang Ye paid no attention to her, and his gaze descended onto her chest. Needless to say, she was very heavily injured. Especially the arrow in her chest, it was ceaselessly emanating weak waves of energy that were damaging her body. Besides that, there were numerous thumb sized holes on her stomach and waist. These bloody holes had pierced through her body!

In short, she was covered in injuries. Of course, they were far inferior to the injuries he’d previously sustained.

Even though Voiders could heal themselves, it depended on the injury. If they were injured by Voiders, then those injuries weren’t something that they could just heal themselves.

Yang Ye’s gazed fell on the arrow on her chest. It just happened to be at the center of her chest. Because her chest was too huge, the arrow seemed like it was being clamped there.

Yang Ye held the arrow and said, “It’s in the way, so I have to pull it out. You don’t have any objections, right?”

She didn’t speak. She just stared at him as if she wanted to kill him with her gaze.

“I’ll take your silence as approval!” Yang Ye pulled lightly once he finished speaking.

Hiss!

A string of blood immediately sprayed out from her chest while the arrow left her body, but she didn’t frown at all. She was an assassin. Since she’d been able to attain her current accomplishments, the injuries she’d suffered in the past had been much more severe than these current injuries of hers.

Yang Ye tossed the arrow aside, gazed at her, and said, “I’m going to remove your clothes now. You don’t have any objections, right?”

Qian Lankong spoke angrily, “If you want to remove it, then remove it. Why waste your breath?”

Yang Ye placed his palm on the clothes before her chest and said, “Then I’m really removing them!”

“Take it off! Hurry up!” Qian Lankong glared at him and was practically shouting, “You’re just doing a woman, do you have to be so hesitant and talk so much? Are you a man? Are you even a man?”

Yang Ye had clearly never expected her to be so agitated, and he was slightly stunned. Once he recovered from his shock, he spoke without thinking, “I’m a man, of course!”

“A man?” Her face was covered in ridicule, “Then why are you so hesitant and talking so much nonsense? If you’re a man, then....”

Hiss!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly swiped his finger over her chest, and the clothes on her chest were instantly sliced open. Those huge peaks instantly bounced out once her clothes were sliced open , and they even shook for a while. It was a rather magnificent sight.

Yang Ye gazed at her and shrugged, “Now you believe me, right?”

She just stared at him while her gaze was surprisingly calm. But it didn’t take long for her to close her eyes slowly as if she had accepted her fate.

Even though she seemed completely calm on the outside, the blood, profound energy, and Dantian within her were silently undergoing fine changes.

Time passed slowly, and a short while passed before she frowned. Because Yang Ye didn’t seem to be doing anything. She opened her eyes and noticed that Yang Ye was looking at her as well. Yang Ye pointed at her chest and said, “It’s too big. The injury....”

Qian Lankong interrupted him and spoke coldly, “Don’t men like you prefer huge ones? You’ve never touched such a huge pair, right? Go on, you can touch it to your heart’s content today.”

Yang Ye glanced at her and smiled, “You’re so agreeable. Since that’s the case, then I won’t hold back.”

As he spoke, he placed his left hand on her right breast.

It was soft, supple, and huge!

That was what Yang Ye felt right now. He restrained his thoughts and exerted a little force to move that breast slightly to the left. After that, he tapped his right index finger against the injury at the center of her chests. Violet energy immediately flowed out of his finger and entered her body.

Qian Lankong clenched her fists while her eyes closed. She was waiting for a moment to arrive. The blood, remaining profound energy, and Dantian within her were moving restlessly. So long as Yang Ye entered her body, then she was completely confident that she could kill him with her.

However, that moment didn’t come. Conversely, a strand of gentle energy appeared on her chest. Once that energy appeared, she noticed to her astonishment that the damaged internal organs, meridians, and bones within her were actually healing at an alarming rate.

What’s going on? Qian Lankong frowned and opened her eyes. At this moment, Yang Ye was still staring at her chest, but his eyes were very calm and without a strand of lust. As for the energy that entered her body, it had come from Yang Ye’s hand.

Qian Lankong was stunned for quite some time before she said, “You... you removed my clothes to heal me?”

Yang Ye glanced indifferently at her and said, “What else?”

He suddenly opened his eyes wide and continued, “You.... Oh my god! You wouldn’t have thought that I intended to do that, right? Tsk, tsk. Such dirty thoughts. You actually had such dirty and foul thoughts. I... I look down on you!”

“Yang Ye! I’ll kill you!” A furious howl resounded like the howl of a wild beast, and it carried a trace of embarrassment and rage.

A long time passed before peace returned to the area.

As his violet energy healed her, her ghastly pale face had started to grow red, and the heavily injured internal organs, bones, and meridians within her were healing swiftly.

She asked, “What profound energy is that?” She didn’t seem to be embarrassed or uncomfortable at all from being completely naked right now.

Actually, it was because she’d given up. He’d already touched her, so why would she care about him seeing her body?

Yang Ye replied, “It’s a secret!”

She glanced at him, fell silent for a long time, and then asked, “Why did you save me?”

Yang Ye moved his right hand to the bloody hole on her stomach, and then his violet energy surged towards it. However, he didn’t move his left hand. Maybe he’d forgotten.

Yang Ye replied, “Miss Qian, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Now, we have a common enemy. So, I think that we can work together. What do you think?”

She looked him in the eyes and asked, “What if I refuse?”

Yang Ye answered, “That’s fine. I can’t kill you because of that, right?”

Qian Lankong asked, “Is that what you really think?”

Yang Ye nodded. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Alright, then I won’t work together with you.” Qian Lankong said, “So long as I want to stay hidden, they won’t be able to find me.”

Yang Ye glanced at her, fell silent for a long time, and then nodded, “Do as you wish!” As he spoke, he moved his right hand to the bloody hole on her waist.

She glanced at him and remained silent.

After around 15 minutes passed, Yang Ye withdrew his right hand. He seemed to have thought of something at this point, and he removed his left hand as well. After that, he withdrew a robe and covered her body, “Miss Qian, the injuries inside and outside of your body have been mostly healed. I have many other things to deal with, so I’ll be leaving now!”

She gazed at him and asked, “Are you trying to play cat and mouse with me?”

Yang Ye gazed at her and replied, “Miss Qian, I really do want to obtain your help. However, as far as I’m concerned, it wouldn’t be the end of the world even if I can’t get your help. Understand?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s figure vanished into the horizon.

A few breaths of time later, Yang Ye suddenly stopped. He turned around and Qian Lankong instantly appeared behind him.

She said, “I have a question!”

Yang Ye said, “Go on!”

Qian Lankong looked him in the eyes and said, “Actually, you didn’t have to remove my clothes in order to heal me, right?”

Yang Ye felt speechless.
