Chapter 2633

The huge axe tore through the sky and entered Eternal Kingdom!

A middle aged man soundlessly appeared behind the shattered barrier of Eternal Kingdom. A moment later, the middle aged man forcefully stopped the huge axe!

The middle aged man was the Eternal Lord!

The supreme expert of the Eternal Kingdom for the last thousand years!

The Eternal Lord flicked the axe back to where it had come from.

The Desolate Emperor didn’t do anything. A man with shoulder-length hair appeared near him, and the man stretched out his hand. A huge hand tore through space and emerged before him.

Along with the appearance of that huge hand, the huge axe suddenly stopped in midair.

A moment later, the huge axe appeared in the huge hand’s grasp, and then the huge hand swung the axe at the Eternal Lord. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Hiss!

The world cracked open before it!

The axe descended, and an extremely long spatial rift appeared in the sky.

The might of this swing of the axe was simply capable of obliterating everything before it!

In the Eternal Kingdom, the Eternal Lord remained indifferent. A golden brush appeared in his grasp when the axe arrived just 300m away from him, and then a beam of golden light surged out from it.

Boom!

The huge axe shook violently in midair and was blasted away. At the same time, the huge hand behind the axe trembled and dispersed.

The man by the Desolate Emperor’s side had a ferocious expression on his face. He was about to attack but the Desolate Emperor stopped him.

The man gazed at the Desolate Emperor, and the latter said, “Huang Xuan, you’ve underestimated the Eternal lord.”

The man called Huang Xuan grunted coldly and remained silent.

The Eternal Lord gazed at the Desolate Emperor, “Desolate Emperor, the Origin World has been destroyed, and that place is on the verge of destruction. Even if you can take Eternal Kingdom, what difference would that make?”

The Desolate Emperor smiled, “Of course it would make a difference. All of you schemed against me and almost caused the destruction of my desolate race. How could I not avenge that?”

His smile grew even more brilliant, “Actually, I wanted to wait. Unfortunately, I didn’t expect the heavens to assist me. The Origin World was destroyed, those old geezers were either killed or fled. Now, even if they want to do something about this, they can’t. This time, Eternal Kingdom will have no help, nor will it have the Sprite Progenitor. Of course, even if you have help, it won’t make a difference. I’ll just annihilate them too. Haha!”

The Eternal Lord glanced coldly at him, “Looks like you’re very confident.”

The Desolate Emperor smiled, “Let’s cut the crap. I know you were holding back in the Origin World. You don’t have to hold back anymore now!”

The Desolate Emperor vanished on the spot.

The Eternal Lord vanished right after him.

A shocking battle erupted far away in the sky.

Once they vanished, seven figures appeared in the air above Eternal Kingdom!

Seven peak Destiny Realm experts!

Liu Yuan from the War Dimension was among them. There was also the Soul Sect’s Master, the Lu Clan’s Ancestor Lu Xuanji, the Ye Clan’s Ancestor Ye Zhitian, the Leng Clan’s Ancestor Leng Qianlin, and the mysterious master of Heaven’s Avatar.

As for the last figure, it was the Demon King of the demon race in the War Dimension!

Besides that, the elite experts of the various clans and powers were gathered behind the shattered barrier, and it included the elites of the War Dimension!

All the experts of Eternal Kingdom were here!

Eternal Kingdom was prepared for the desolate race’s invasion!

Meanwhile, once the Desolate Emperor left, the desolate race seemed to have no more experts. Of course, Eternal Kingdom would never think that.

The middle aged man called Huang Xuan didn’t attack. He was in no rush. The desolate race had waited for so many years, so they had a great deal of patience!

Meanwhile, a group of black clothed figures suddenly appeared behind Huang Xuan.

18 black clothed figures!

Desolate Deathguard!

One of the desolate race’s true elites. Most of these Desolate Deathguard had survived the previous war. Besides that, there were some that the desolate race had fostered over the years.

Even though most of them were only at the Lord Realm, their combat strength was absolutely solid. If they joined forces, even killing a Destiny Realm expert wouldn’t be difficult at all!

At this moment, Liu Yuan and the others recognized the Desolate Deathguard.

They revealed solemn expressions on their faces!

Eternal Kingdom naturally wouldn’t forget the Desolate Deathguard. All those years ago, the Desolate Deathguard had almost killed its way into Eternal Kingdom, and it was during that time that the over 100 sword cultivators of the Ancient Sword Sect had died in battle against them.

If it hadn’t been for those formidable sword cultivators, the Desolate Deathguard would have killed its way into the Central Region!

The Desolate Deathguard were like a sharp sword that could pierce anything!

Suddenly, Liu Yuan closed her eyes slowly, and then she roared, “Where are the War Guards of my War Dimension?!”

Swish! Swish!

36 figures appeared below her!

They wore violet armor, held spears or sabers, and were made up of men and women!

All of them were at the Lord Realm!

Besides that, they were wearing and holding divine treasures!

They were fully equipped with divine treasures!

All 36 of them were the extraordinary experts that Eternal Kingdom had specially fostered, so Eternal Kingdom would definitely not hold back. These War Guards ate the best and used the best. Of course, no ordinary expert could become one of them.

All of them were the most monstrous geniuses of Eternal Kingdom!

Based on their auras, they weren’t any weaker than the Desolate Deathguards!

All those years ago, Eternal Kingdom had been conceited, and it hadn’t fostered its own forces. Coupled with the fact that the desolate race had taken them by surprise, Eternal Kingdom had crumbled before the desolate race. Now, Eternal Kingdom had been waiting for this battle for a long time.

Huang Xuan had a cold smile on his face as he waved his right hand. A moment later, the Desolate Deathguards behind him charged at the War Guards.

18 against 36!

The Desolate Deathguards were at a disadvantage when it came to their numbers. However, their imposing aura didn’t lose to the War Guards of Eternal Kingdom at all!

Fight!

Once their battle began, the entire Eternal River evaporated while numerous explosions resounded through the area!

At this moment, countless experts from Eternal Border felt horrible.

Because they were very well aware that regardless of which side won this war, Eternal Border would be gone once this war was over.

All those years ago, Eternal Border was protected by the Sprite Progenitor, and she’d helped repair the area. That was how it was able to survive the war. Yet now…

No matter what, Eternal Border was about to vanish forever.

The Desolate Deathguard stopped the 36 War Guards without being pushed to a disadvantage at all. Moreover, they even showed signs of suppressing the War Guards!

Liu Yuan’s face was extremely gloomy. Now, she knew the flaws that these War Guards of hers had.

They weren’t mad and ruthless enough!

Even if the Desolate Deathguards’ strength were ignored, their ruthlessness was very terrifying.

It was ruthlessness she’d seen in one person!

The Ancient Sword Sect’s current sect master!

Liu Yuan restrained her thoughts and gazed at Huang Xuan, “What? Is that all your desolate race has?”

Huang Xuan shrugged, “We really don’t have as many forces as you do, but so what? No matter how many people you have, they are just a bunch of weaklings. Haha!”

Liu Yuan’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Attack!”

Once she gave the order, the Destiny Realm experts behind her were about to attack. However, a powerful wave of pressure slammed down from the distant battlefield!

It enveloped the Soul Sect’s master, the master of Heaven’s Avatar, and a peak Destiny Realm expert who was an independent cultivator!

They were being forced to fight!

Meanwhile, roaring laughter resounded from high above, “Just one peak Destiny Realm expert isn’t enough at all! Come! Two more! No, three more! Haha!”

It was the Desolate Emperor!

The Soul Sect’s master and the others’ expressions turned extremely unsightly.

The Desolate Emperor was still able to deal with them as well. What did that represent? It represented that his strength was above the Eternal Lord.

The Soul Sect’s master and the others gazed at Liu Yuan. She looked up at the distant battlefield, fell silent for a long time, and then nodded slightly.

All those years ago, the Eternal Lord had overestimated themselves and died at the hands of the Desolate Emperor. They could naturally not allow history to repeat itself!

Once Liu Yuan nodded, the three of them shot up into the air and entered the distant battlefield!

One against four!

Now, the Desolate Emperor who was renowned throughout the universe was finally revealing his true strength!

But Liu Yuan still had four extraordinary Destiny Realm experts on her side!

But the desolate race only had Huang Xuan!

Based on the overall situation, Eternal Kingdom still had the upper hand!

Liu Yuan walked slowly in Huang Xuan’s direction, and a few auras shot over from behind her and locked onto Huang Xuan!

However, Liu Yuan and the others still remained vigilant because they were very well aware that it was impossible for this to be the limits of the desolate race’s strength!

Of course, they had trump cards too!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was seated on the peak of a mountain in the Ancient Sword Sect. There was a sword floating by his side. It was Executor!

Suddenly, an ethereal palace appeared above him!

The Sword Hall!

A hall made of countless swords!

At this moment, countless sword howls resounded through the Ancient Sword Sect, and then the sword hall above Yang Ye shook violently while countless rays of light floated into the air.

The world was covered in swords!

A moment later, a wave of powerful intent appeared in the sky, and then half of the swords turned blood red!

Meanwhile, Elder Xue appeared behind Yang Ye.

She took a deep and long glance at the surroundings! The Sword Hall!

This Super Divine Treasure which once belonged to the Ancient Sword Sect had appeared once more!

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “What is it?”

Elder Xue bowed slightly, “Eternal Kingdom and the desolate race have started fighting!”

Yang Ye stood up slowly and said, “I’m going to watch the show.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

A ray of blood red light flashed through the distant sky!
