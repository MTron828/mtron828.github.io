Chapter 1289 – Rupture!

The Yuan Clan and the other powers were chasing him madly, and they’d almost caused his death on numerous occasions. How could he not avenge that?

It’s never too late for a gentleman to take revenge, but a petty man takes revenge all day.

Yang Ye was naturally no gentleman!

Moreover, the 4 clans and 2 sects led by the Yuan Clan were out in the open while he was hidden. It could be said that it was the best time to act against them.

Meanwhile, Qian Lankong suddenly obstructed his path, “The strength of our Slayer Pavilion is capable of going against the 5 clans and 2 sects.”

Yang Ye replied, “I know!”

“Then why are you heading out to kill? Are you trying to sacrifice the entire Slayer Pavilion to take the Yuan Clan and those other powers down with us?” As she finished speaking, her gaze had become quite cold.

Yang Ye said, “I have no intention to do that. I....”

“That’s exactly what you intend!” Qian Lankong interrupted Yang Ye and said, “You want the entire Slayer Pavilion to drag the Yuan Clan and those other powers down with it, so that your Sword Alliance can reap the rewards! Hahaha! What a great plan!”

Yang Ye frowned as he gazed at her. Meanwhile, she laughed coldly, “What? Want to kill me, and then truly gain control over the Slayer Pavilion? Let me tell you that so long as I’m alive, you can dream of trying to sacrifice the entire Slayer Pavilion for your Sword Alliance! Don’t even dream of it!”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a long time before he said, “I’d thought that we can work together because we have a common enemy, but now it would seem like I was mistaken. I’m truly unable to work together with you.”

“So, you’re going to kill me, huh?” She laughed coldly, “Kill me and you can truly gain control over the Slayer Pavilion. Moreover, no one will be able to expose your lies. Right?”

Yang Ye said, “I admit that I can’t take control of Slayer Pavilion without your help and killing you will indeed allow me to gain control over the Slayer Pavilion. But that goes against my heart.” When he spoke up to this point, Yang Ye looked her in the eyes and continued, “Now, I’ll give the Slayer Pavilion back to you, and I’ll have no further link to it. You go on your way, and I’ll be on mine. We’ll have nothing to do with each other! Alright?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he immediately moved around her and vanished into the distance.

Meanwhile, Qian Lankong was stunned on the spot. Obviously, she hadn’t expected Yang Ye to say that and actually give up on the Slayer Pavilion.

The Slayer Pavilion!

It was a Diamond Rank power!

But Yang Ye had given up on it just like that.

Is there something wrong with him? Qian Lankong was at a loss for what to do.

There was nothing wrong with Yang Ye, of course. But he’d still given up on taking control of Slayer Pavilion, and it was an impulsive action. However, what could he do besides that?

Kill Qian Lankong?

He could. But it was impossible for him to do it in an instant. Moreover, once he entered into battle with her, everyone within Slayer Pavilion would be aware of it. At that time, it would be absolutely easy for Qian Lankong to expose him.

Once that happened, he wouldn’t just be unable to take control of Slayer pavilion, he would become a target that Slayer Pavilion pursued. He was naturally not afraid of that, but what about the Sword Alliance? Could it endure being targeted by Slayer Pavilion?

Besides that, the main reason he could take control of Slayer Pavilion was Qian Lankong. Even if he could kill her in an instant, he would never do that in order to take control of Slayer Pavilion. After all, a life was only worth living if one lived it with a clear conscience. If he had a clear conscience, he would even kill a million; but if his conscience couldn’t remain clear, then he wouldn’t kill no matter what was on the line.

Perhaps others would think that was extremely foolish, but that was the principle which he lived by, and it was his path of the sword.

Yang Ye didn’t stay for even a moment, and he immediately left Darkness City once he found out where the Yun Clan was located.

...

In the hall within the headquarters of Slayer Pavilion.

Not long after Yang Ye left, Shui Linlang, Hall Master Zhao, and the others walked into the hall.

Hall Master Zhao asked, “Protector Qian, where’s the pavilion master?”

Qian Lankong spoke indifferently, “Do you need something?”

Hall Master Zhao nodded, “The forces led by the Yuan Clan have started to launch frenzied attacks against us. Up until this point in time, we’ve lost 14 hidden bases. During the battles, we lost 17 Emperor Realm assassins, and 72 Saint Realm assassins. Their forces haven’t stopped, and they are still searching for our bases. Moreover, every single attack they launch is led by Voiders. So, our forces are utterly incapable of resisting them. Once they locate a base, our forces are doomed to die or surrender to them.”

“Our forces are surrendering?” Qian Lankong frowned. The members of Slayer Pavilion were strictly disciplined, so its members would almost never surrender.

Hall Master Zhao nodded, “Yes. We wouldn’t have lost that many bases of operations if someone didn’t betray us. Especially when some extremely well hidden bases were discovered. Protector Qian, the forces led by the Yuan Clan have already launched a full scale attack upon us. We need the pavilion master’s orders!”

Qian Lankong fell silent for a long time before she said, “Abandon all other bases and go into hiding!”

Hall Master Zhao glanced at her and remained silent.

She frowned slightly in response to this, “What?”

Hall Master Zhao bowed slightly and said, “Protector Qian, I’m sorry but I only obey the pavilion master’s orders. Please ask the pavilion master to issue our orders himself.”

Qian Lankong spoke in a low voice, “Those are the pavilion master’s orders!”

Hall Master Zhao shook his head, “I want the pavilion master to tell me himself.”

Qian Lankong’s face fell. Tell you himself? Yang Ye had left Slayer Pavilion, so where would she look for the pavilion master?

She fell silent for a short while before she said, “The pavilion master is busy and has left. Just do as I’ve said. I’ll take responsibility for it.”

Hall Master Zhao still shook his head, “Protector Qian, the pavilion master didn’t order us to obey you. So, we can’t obey your orders.”

Qian Lankong spoke in a low voice, “Hall Master Zhao, I told you that the pavilion master isn’t here.”

Hall Master Zhao fell silent. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Meanwhile, Shui Linlang said, “Protector Qian, how about you ask the pavilion master to send a voice transmission to us?”

Hall Master Zhao hurriedly nodded, “That works.”

Qian Lankong glanced at them, and she felt quite helpless in her heart. She knew that while her status was above them, she didn’t have the authority to give them orders because of how the Slayer Pavilion’s system was. It could be said that if she wanted to take control of Slayer Pavilion, then she had to convince the 12 hall masters or kill them all.

Convince them? Perhaps she would have a chance if she hadn’t brought Yang Ye back with her. Yet now, it would be utterly impossible to convince them. Unless she exposed that Yang Ye was only pretending to be the pavilion master. But if she did that, it was very likely for Slayer Pavilion to split apart, and it would be finished if it were to split apart right now.

As for killing the 12 hall masters. Not to mention that she didn’t possess the strength to do that, she couldn’t kill them even if she could. Because the Slayer Pavilion would be instantly finished if she did that.

Qian Lankong fell silent for a long time before she said, “I’ll contact him!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she withdrew a transmission talisman and crushed it. For the sake of making communication between them convenient, both she and Yang Ye had given each other a trace of their spiritual brand. So, she really could contact Yang Ye.

A long time passed, but she received no reply.

Meanwhile, Hall Master Zhao and Shui Linlang frowned.

Qian Lankong withdrew another transmission talisman and crushed it. It had just shattered when Qian Lankong frowned. Because she wasn’t able to send the transmission. Yang Ye had erased the spiritual brand she left him.

Hall Master Zhao and Shui Linlang exchanged glances, and there was bewilderment in their eyes.

Qian Lankong said, “The pavilion master might have some urgent matters to attend to, so he can’t reply. Hall Master Zhao, Hall Master Shui, it’s a critical moment for our Slayer Pavilion. We have to act according to the situation at a time like this. So, immediately do as I’ve said and prevent our Slayer Pavilion from losing even more members.

Hall Master Zhao remained silent, and Shui Linlang didn’t speak as well.

“Listen to me for now while I go look for the pavilion master. Alright?” Qian Lankong spoke in a low voice. As soon as she finished speaking, she instantly felt quite unhappy. Because she was the one who’d forced Yang Ye to leave, yet now, she had to go look for him. But she had no other choice. If she didn’t bring Yang Ye back, then these fellows wouldn’t obey her at all, and if the situation continues, then the Slayer Pavilion would be without a leader and many would start having other thoughts.

Hall Master Zhao still remained slightly hesitant. Because he only obeyed the pavilion master. Besides the pavilion master, no one else could give them orders. It was a rule that the pavilion master had set in the past. Even though he knew that they should act according to the situation at a time like this, he still didn’t really dare to break that rule. Because someone had in the past, and that person died.

“Do as Protector Qian has said, for now!” Meanwhile, Shui Linlang spoke abruptly, “Don’t cause the others of our brothers because of such trivial matters.”

Hall Master Zhao hesitated for a moment longer after he heard Shui Linlang, and then he nodded and left. At this moment, Shui Linlang was a Voider as well. If Qian Lankong was included, then it was the orders or 2 Voiders. So, he had an excuse even if the pavilion master were to be displeased and wanted to punish him.

Once Hall Master Zhao left, Shui Linlang gazed at Qian Lankong and asked, “What exactly is going on?” As far as she was concerned, it was strange for Yang Ye to refuse Qian Lankong’s voice transmission.

Qian Lankong shook her head slightly, “It’s nothing. He went out to deal with something. I’ll go look for him now.”

Shui Linlang said, “Protector Qian, I just want to remind you that Yang Ye is someone the pavilion master personally sent to take charge of Slayer Pavilion. I acknowledge him, and I’m willing to cooperate with him. I hope that you don’t have any other thoughts. Because you should understand that you don’t have the authority to take charge of Slayer Pavilion. So, unless Yang Ye or the pavilion master give the order, neither I nor the others will obey your orders. This is the last time, and it’s the only time.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Shui Linlang turned around and left.

“Dammit!” Qian Lankong clenched her fists tightly, and her chest rose and fell repeatedly from the rage she experienced. She was furious, of course. She was thinking wholeheartedly for the Slayer Pavilion’s benefit, but its members actually suspected that she had ill intent!

Yang Ye’s the fake one!

She really wanted to shout loudly and tell them the truth. But the sad thing was that they wouldn’t believe her even if she did!

A long time passed before Qian Lankong’s figure flashed and vanished from the hall.

...

Yang Ye naturally didn’t know that Qian Lankong was looking for him. He’d snuck into the Yun Clan.

“Yang Ye killed my son! He must die! That bitch, Yun Banqing, as well! I’ll make living worse than death for her! I’ll make living worse than death for that bastard and whore!” Yang Ye had just snuck into the Yun Clan when a hysterical roar resounded throughout the sky above the Yun Clan, and it was so loud that it could be heard clearly throughout the area.

Yang Ye was speechless.
