Chapter 1375 – Life And Death!

What was the most wonderful thing in life?

It was naturally doing what you like with someone you love.

Yang Ye had been constantly moving about throughout the years, and he spent most of those years away from Xiao Yuxi and the others. So, Yang Ye was quite greedy for it, and he did this thing that he liked for a rather long time.

The next day.

Yang Ye opened his eyes slowly and spoke softly, “I actually fell asleep!”

Sleep!

It was an extremely normal thing, but it was quite unfamiliar to Yang Ye. Because from some point in time, he’d never slept unless he lost consciousness.

He didn’t dare to sleep, nor did he have the time to!

As far as he was concerned, every single second of time was extremely important.

Some might say that it was quite sad. After all, he lived a life where he didn’t even have the time to sleep. So, wasn’t that sad?

However, Yang Ye didn’t think so. He felt that men shouldn’t choose a life of comfort in the years that they should work hard. He could relax and live a calm and stable life. Some people say that an ordinary life is very happy, but is that really true?

Ordinary people are usually very happy in their ordinary lives. Because they pursue nothing, so they naturally have no problems. But they felt even more helpless. Because when one had something to pursue, one would realize that one didn’t have the right to pursue it at all.

If Yang Ye was an ordinary person, would Su Qingshi have fallen for him? Would Xiao Yuxi have fallen for him? Would Ye Liuyun, Dugu Jian, and the others in the Sword Alliance follow him? Even if Su Qingshi and the others did fall for him, would have the right to possess them? Would he have the strength to protect them?

Don’t call women realistic. They merely pursued the most outstanding, and that was a very normal thing. If they didn’t pursue the outstanding and pursued someone ordinary who had no ability at all, then that would be unusual instead. Just like men, if there was a beautiful woman and a very ugly one before them, which one would they choose?

Actually, men were much more realistic than women at most times.

Yang Ye’s life really was quite tiring now. However, what he possessed were things that many others didn’t possess.

If there’s pain, then there’s gain; if there’s gain, then there must be pain.

His experiences during his youth had caused his character to be quite extreme. He trusted no one, but he was no fool. Conversely, he had a deeper understanding of how those at the low levels of society lived.

Living a tiring life was better than one without dignity. If it was a choice between exhaustion and losing his dignity, he chose exhaustion.

“Mmm....” A soft mumble suddenly came from between his arms.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and looked down. Xiao Yuxi’s arms were wrapped around his waist, and she was rubbing her head lightly against his chest.

Yang Ye grinned and lightly stroked her soft and smooth back. He didn’t wake her up because he knew that he wasn’t the only one, even Xiao Yuxi had probably not had a peaceful nap for a very long time.

A long time passed before she suddenly opened her eyes and looked up at Yang Ye. Yang Ye was looking at her, and he smiled when he saw her wake up, “You’re awake?”

She nodded lightly.

He gave her a light peck on her lips and smiled, “Then get up.”

Xiao Yuxi gazed at him for a short while before she said, “Let me sleep a while longer!” As soon as she finished speaking, she suddenly wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

...

Late in the morning, Yang Ye and Xiao Yuxi finally left the room.

In a hall, Xiao Bieli and Xiao Ling sat at the seats of the host. Yang Ye and Xiao Yuxi were on their right while some students and elders of White Deer Academy filled the hall.

The students were looking at Yang Ye, and there was a trace of fervor in their eyes. Even though they hadn’t participated in the battle when the Evil Faction and 4 great clans attacked, they’d witnessed how Yang Ye had slaughtered their enemies. Those experts which they had to look up to couldn’t even fight back against Yang Ye!

They felt no envy and only admiration.

Normally, many would envy those who were better than them. However, when someone was much greater than them, they wouldn’t be envious anymore.

Envy depended on the target as well!

Xiao Bieli’s gaze was on Yang Ye, and there was a trace of gratification in his eyes as he gazed at Yang Ye. Yang Ye’s strength was much greater than it had been. Fortunately, Yang Ye hadn’t changed along with the change in his strength. For example, Yang Ye was still respectful to him and Xiao Ling, and he acted like a junior before his seniors.

It was something very normal in the past, yet now, Yang Ye’s strength was at a height that he had to look up to. But Yang Ye still treated him like a senior. He was able to sense that Yang Ye’s respect to him and Xiao Ling wasn’t faked at all!

Yang Ye was still the same person!

Xiao Bieli restrained his thoughts and said, “I received news from Pine Prefecture that they’ve set out today.”

“That’s quite fast!” said Yang Ye. He’d thought that it would take quite a few days. After all, there were so many powers and people there. So, it would definitely not be easy to arrange everything in a short while. However, it only took a while for him to realize the reason. Yu Wushuang’s ability was on par with Ye Liuyun.

“They’ll probably get here tomorrow” Xiao Bieli continued, “Our forces are prepared as well.”

Yang Ye nodded, “We’ll leave once everyone from Pine Prefecture is here.”

Xiao Bieli said, “But the Half-Saints are weak. It’ll probably be difficult for them to survive outside the Radiant Dimension.”

Yang Ye replied, “It’s fine. There’ll be someone outside the Radiant Dimension to receive all of you.”

Xiao Bieli asked, “Those people you brought over from Dark Hell Continent?”

Yang Ye nodded. He was afraid that a mishap might occur, so he’d gone ahead and come to the Radiant Dimension before them. As for the forces of the Sword Alliance, they followed behind him. All of them had arrived at the Radiant Dimension yesterday, but Yang Ye didn’t allow them to come into the Radiant Dimension and hide themselves instead. The Void Cloud Shuttle had the ability to conceal itself. So, their arrival in Skyriver Stellar Region hadn’t alarmed the Alliance of Guardians.

As for why he’d done that, it was naturally to catch the Alliance of Guardians off guard. Yet now, he’d temporarily decided not to fight the Alliance of Guardians and lead them out of the Radiant Dimension first.

Some would say that White Deer Academy and the experts of Pine Prefecture were burdens to Yang Ye. After all, based on Yang Ye’s strength, he would have no need to worry about the Alliance of Guardians if he abandoned all of them. But Yang Ye wouldn’t do that. After all, the Ancient Sword School, Ocean of Clouds Academy, and White Deer Academy hadn’t treated him like a burden when he was still weak.

Especially the Ancient Sword School and White Deer Academy. Even Jian Wuchen had sacrificed himself for Yang Ye. As for White Deer Academy, it had been reduced to such a state because of him.

Now that he was strong, wouldn’t he be worse than an animal if he were to treat them as burdens?

Never forget one’s roots!

Xiao Bieli spoke in a low voice, “Something isn’t right. The Alliance of Guardians still hasn’t sent anyone after 2 days have passed.”

Yang Ye replied, “Indeed!”

Xiao Bieli was about to speak when Su Shihe walked into the hall. He nodded slightly to Yang Ye, and then gazed at Xiao Bieli, “Everyone from the Martial Sect vanished this morning.”

Xiao Bieli’s expression changed, “Were they annihilated?”

Su Shihe shook his head, “No, they vanished. Right, someone came to our academy just now, and he said that someone tasked him with sending something here.” As soon as he finished speaking, Su Shihe flicked a transmission talisman to Xiao Bieli.

Xiao Bieli frowned, pondered deeply for a moment, and then flicked a strand of energy forward. The transmission talisman instantly exploded apart. At the same time, a voice appeared here.

“Leave right away!”

It was Wu Yuan’s voice!

Leave? Yang Ye frowned. What is he trying to say? Nether Maiden told me to leave as well. What exactly is going on?

Xiao Bieli and the others felt something was off as well, and they frowned, causing the atmosphere in the hall to become rather heavy.

Meanwhile, Su Shihe spoke, “Besides the Martial Sect, some other powers seem to have vanished as well. I’ve investigated and discovered that all of them aren’t ordinary. They might be similar to what you’ve told us about the Martial Sect. They might be from another world.”

Xiao Bieli spoke solemnly, “Something might be about to happen in the Radiant Dimension!”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Send a voice transmission to the group from Pine Prefecture. Tell them to rush here no matter the cost. Besides that, tell all the students to be prepared at all times. We’re leaving immediately once they get here.” No matter what was about to occur in the Radiant Dimension, it would have nothing to do with him once the people related to him had left.

As for the Nether Pavilion, he didn’t have to worry about them at all. It was better for him to be concerned for his own safety.

“I’ll go make the necessary arrangements!” Su Shihe turned around and left once he finished speaking.

Xiao Bieli looked out of the hall while worry filled his eyes, “A storm is coming!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when he suddenly frowned, and then he gazed at Xiao Yuxi and said, “I’ll be heading out for a moment.”

Xiao Yuxi glanced at him and nodded.

Yang Ye nodded slightly to Xiao Bieli, and then he vanished from the hall.

In the sky outside the hall.

Nether Maiden stood in front of Yang Ye.

She frowned and asked, “Why haven’t you left yet?!”

Yang Ye replied, “They aren’t here yet. We’ll be able to leave tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.”

Nether Maiden remained silent for an instant before she said, “You can’t abandon them?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

“Then do it as soon as possible!” As soon as she finished speaking, Nether Maiden was about to leave. But Yang Ye had stopped her.

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes and asked, “You really can’t tell me the reason? I won’t force you if you really can’t.”

Nether Maiden remained silent. A short while passed yet she still didn’t speak a word.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, ``Since you don’t want to tell me, then forget it.” He knew that she would definitely tell him if she could. But since she didn’t say a thing, there was definitely a reason why she refused to tell him.

Suddenly, Nether Maiden looked up into the sky. A long time passed before her gaze gradually turned icy cold.

Bang!

Nether Maiden was about to speak when a huge crack appeared in the sky, and then roaring laughter resounded from within it, “I heard the Nether Pavilion’s hall masters are peerless. I, Ye Xunhuan, only possess mediocre ability, so I’d like to seek guidance from all of you. Of course, we’ll decide on a victor, and life and death.”

“Ye Xunhuan. 3rd on the Radiant Dimension’s Martial Rankings and 26th on the Dragon Rankings.” Nether Maiden gazed up into the sky for a short while before she continued, “They’ve started to take action.”
