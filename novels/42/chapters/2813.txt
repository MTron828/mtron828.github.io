Chapter 2814 – A Game!

If it were a one on one battle, he could actually suppress any one of them. However, if they joined forces against him, the situation would be different!

In practically an instant, his Fate Sword Dao was at his peak!

His true peak!

He’d entered one of his strongest states!

Yang Ye had been pushed back repeatedly from the very beginning, and it was absolute suppression that he was facing!

Moreover, they didn’t hold back and madly besieged Yang Ye as well.

Obviously, they planned to push him to his limits.

Just like that, the four of them fought intensely.

Meanwhile, at a certain point above the clouds, the woman in a plain dress sat before the GO board. She stared at it while both of her hands were being supported on the board. In her right grasp was a white piece that she kept rolling between the tip of her fingers.

After Monarch Yan’s death, she had to play on her own!

She gazed at the board for a long time before she grinned, “I’ll just wait a while longer!”

She placed the piece back with the others.

The woman in a plain dress stood up and walked over to the nearby tree.

Shu Wubian’s true body!

She glanced at the tree and grinned, “You once said that no matter what level we reach, we must always give a chance to the boundless universe and all living things within it. In the past, I didn’t really understand what you meant, and I’m gradually understanding it now. Unfortunately, I’ve comprehended something better. But there would be no me without you, so I respect you!”

She tapped her finger forward. The tree shook violently as it seemed to have been freed of something!

The woman in a plain dress smiled, “I didn’t destroy you for my own selfish intentions. Now, I’m letting you go merely because I want to give you a chance.”

A moment of silence ensued, and then the tree shook violently and transformed into a ray of white light that vanished from there.

The woman looked down, or to be more precise, she looked down at Yang Ye who was in a certain world. Giving him a chance was giving the Three Dimensional Universe a chance.

At a certain spatial rift, the mysterious expert and Shu Wubian exchanged glances, and then they appeared outside the spatial rift. Shu Wubian looked up, and a tree was gradually descending from above.

The Boundless Divine Tree!

Shu Wubian was stunned by the sight of it, and then she charged over madly and entered the tree.

Boom!

Along with her entering the tree, the tree seemed as if it had come to life. Rays of monstrous pressure appeared throughout the area, and the entire starry sky trembled before it.

The mysterious expert looked up and crossed his arms before him. No one knew what he was thinking.

A short while later, Shu Wubian appeared before him.

However, she wasn’t the same Shu Wubian anymore. Now, her strength was completely incomparable to before!

The Boundless Divine Tree!

At her prime, she was an existence who dared to go against Destiny!

The mysterious expert spoke softly, “What are you thinking?”

She closed her eyes slowly, “She extracted me from my body and made me suffer the pain of being separated from my body… Now, she has returned my body to me, not out of kindness but because she’s too confident in herself. She doesn’t fear anything.”

The mysterious expert asked, “So?”

She opened her eyes, “I’ll fight her!”

Fight!

Regardless of whether it was Shu Wubian or the mysterious expert, if they wanted to flee, Destiny may not hunt them down. However, their only goal in life was to kill Destiny!

It was for revenge, and to fight with everything they had.

If they could kill Destiny, there would be no further shackles on their hearts, and they would be able to advance further!

Destiny was a shackle in the hearts of countless, especially those who’d once fought her!

The mysterious expert nodded slightly, “Then let’s fight her!”

Suddenly, they gazed at the spatial rift, and a terrifying aura swept out from within it.

The mysterious expert spoke softly, “The Demonic Qilin is awake!”

Shu Wubian looked down, “It’s time for everything to end!”

…

Eternal Border.

Ding Shaoyao stood by the edge of a mountain peak and could see the entire world below her.

She was still in the red dress!Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Huang Ying and Liu Yuan were by her side. They were the representatives of the younger generation, and they respectively represented the desolate race and the War Dimension.

Huang Ying spoke softly, “The Four Dimensional Universe has settled down in Eternal Kingdom!”

Ding Shaoyao smiled, “You’re not happy?”

Huang Ying chuckled, “A little!”

Ding Shaoyao shook her head, “Don’t think like that. He could annihilate the Four Dimensional Universe, but at that time, the Three Dimensional Universe would be without enemies. He wants balance.”

Huang Ying fell silent.

Ding Shaoyao added, “Once those experts from the Four Dimensional Universe are gone, these fellows in the Three Dimensional Universe will take no more than a few dozen years to run wild. Moreover, without any sense of danger, it’s easy for the unity between all of you to be lost. However, would the Three Dimensional Universe dare to stop staying united while the experts of the Four Dimensional Universe remained?”

She gazed at Huang Ying and Liu Yuan, “Would you dare?”

They shook their heads.

If those experts from the Four Dimensional Universe were gone, they would definitely start scheming many years from now, and it may even cause huge conflict to arise between them. It was a flaw of humanity. However, while those experts from the Four Dimensional Universe remained, the Three Dimensional Universe would never allow chaos to engulf them or cause chaos! Similarly, while the Three Dimensional Universe’s experts remained, the experts of the Four Dimensional Universe would never dare to cause chaos to engulf the Three Dimensional Universe!

A balance had been formed between both sides!

Ding Shaoyao looked up into the sky. Presently, the Three Dimensional Universe had practically gained peace. However, she was very well aware that it was only temporary because there was another woman high above in the clouds!

The future of everything depended on just a thought of hers!

And Yang Ye!

Ding Shaoyao’s gaze blurred when she thought of Yang Ye.

You better return!

…

At a certain ocean, a casket floated there, and there was a petite young girl seated cross-legged not too far away from it.

It was Tian Xiu!

She glanced at the casket. It had been days! But there was no movement from within the casket! However, she could sense the aura within it!

A short while later, Tian Xiu moved her gaze away and slowly closed her eyes.

…

At a point in the starry sky.

A sword cultivator in a cloud white robe was ceaselessly going deeper and deeper into outer space, and he was traveling much faster than before too.

The sword cultivator was just advancing forward like that!

Actually, the way he cultivated was unlike the people of this world. He was cultivating as he walked, and his Sword Dao had been cultivated by walking step by step, just like this.

A sword cultivator who walked the world!

…

In a certain world.

Yang Ye was still fighting the three women, but it was more like he was suffering a beating. From the very beginning, he was practically incapable of fighting back against their joint forces.

Actually, instead of saying they were suppressing him, they were actually training him!

Yang Ye’s Sword Dao was at his own limits, and it was impossible to gain comprehensions to ascend beyond that limit in the short term. Since it was impossible to comprehend normally, they were forcing him to comprehend it!

They were forcing out the limits of his limits!

That was their plan!

Just like that, days passed, and more and more injuries appeared on Yang Ye. In the end, he seemed like he’d been cut by a thousand blades, and his body was covered in injuries.

At this moment, Yang Ye’s mind was extremely tense because the slightest mistake may result in his death!

He’d never experienced a battle like this in all his life.

His Fate Sword Dao had arrived at his limits as well, or it should be said that every single swing of his sword carried the Fate Sword Dao now! Unfortunately, it wasn’t very effective against their joint forces!

Their joint strength far surpassed his own!

In the end, Yang Ye had no choice but to utilize the Fate Sword Domain!

At the instant he unleashed the Fate Sword Domain, he surpassed them and pushed them back, but just an instant later, the Fate Sword Domain was destroyed by their joint forces.

Time passed swiftly.

A month passed in the blink of the eye.

Yang Ye had improved, or it should be said that he’d clearly improved, but he was still incapable of defeating them on his own.

Another month passed.

On this day, the three women stopped.

Yang Ye laid there on the ground like a pile of mush! But he felt extremely good in his heart!

He’d fought to his heart’s content throughout this time.

He’d really unleashed his full strength without holding back at all. Of course, after fully unleashing his strength, he noticed that he could do better, and there were many flaws that he could improve on!

A limit never existed!

Tu glanced at the other two of her forms and said, “I’m leaving!”

The woman in black nodded, “Take care!”

The woman in white added, “Take care!”

Tu glanced at them, hesitated for a moment, and sighed softly, “We don’t owe this world anything, so both of you don’t have to…”

The woman in white grinned, “It’s our choice.”

Tu nodded lightly and left.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Thank you!”

Tu stopped, “I was just helping them!”

She vanished into the distance once she finished speaking.

Suddenly, something unexpected occurred. A sword suddenly appeared above them!

Justice!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “You’re finally taking action?”

Justice suddenly descended before Yang Ye, and then a voice resounded, “Get on!”

Yang Ye glanced at the woman in white and the woman in black, “You’ve both done enough for this universe, so leave the rest to me!”

Yang Ye stepped onto Justice.

Hiss!

Justice vanished into the sky.

The two of them exchanged glances. In the end, they took each other’s hand and shot up into the sky.

Justice carried Yang Ye through the sky and space, and it didn’t take long for him to see an expanse of clouds.

At the moment Yang Ye stepped foot onto those clouds, Justice suddenly shot down rapidly and arrived in the sky above Eternal Border.

The sword just floated there in the sky above Eternal Border.

Meanwhile, the woman above the clouds grinned, “Let’s play a game. If you lose, the Three Dimensional Universe will cease to exist!”
