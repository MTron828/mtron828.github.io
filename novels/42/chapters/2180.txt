Chapter 2181 – Wait!

The Demon God was dead!

The Devil Monarch and the others hadn’t expected such an outcome.

The Demon God had the upper hand from the beginning, and it was the Demon God who’d been suppressing Yang Ye in battle. However, the Demon God hadn’t been able to resist Yang Ye’s final attack.

Yang Ye had been superior in the end!

The number one expert below the Progenitor Realm!

Bang!

Suddenly, an explosion resounded from the side.

Yang Ye looked over, and he saw the monkey had just made a tiny mistake in battle against those Sages and had been blasted away. As soon as he was blasted away, over a dozen Sages pounced at him.

Yang Ye was about to attack but ten figures obstructed Yang Ye’s path.

They were led by the Spirit God, Sovereign of Sky, Devil Monarch, Shaman King, and Barbaric King. Besides them, the rest were experts among experts!

Obviously, they weren’t planning to fight him one on one this time!

The facts proved that fighting Yang Ye in single combat was a foolish decision!

Suddenly, a terrifying aura came from the side.

All the Sages looked over, and they saw the monkey’s body was expanding madly, and a towering monkey instantly appeared there.

At this moment, the monkey was over 1km tall, extremely huge, and simply seemed like a small city!

An Ancient Titan Monkey!

That was the monkey’s true form!

The monkey rarely used his true form because very few could force him to use it!

At this moment, even someone as strong as the monkey couldn’t resist the joint forces of over a dozen Sages. He would probably have no chance to return to his true form if he still refused to use it.

Once he returned to his true form, the golden rod in his grasp suddenly grew by a few hundred times.

At this moment, a powerful aura swept out from the monkey, and he simply felt invincible. As for the other Sages around him, they had extremely solemn expressions on their faces. Regardless of whether it was in terms of strength or defense, both of them had grown tremendously for the monkey. It could be said that the true battle had only just begun!

“Let’s fight!” Suddenly, the monkey roared with fury, and then he leaped up and charged at the Sages while his powerful strength shook the world around him!

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and looked at An Nanjing.

At this moment, there were multiple Sages around her too.

There were many injuries on her, and she was being suppressed too. She was practically only able to passively defend herself. If it wasn’t for her extraordinary combat instinct and extremely powerful strength, she would be dead by now.

Yang Ye’s heart sank when he noticed the situation she was in. He was about to do something when her voice suddenly resounded in his mind, “Let me do it myself!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Elysium left her grasp, and it transformed into a ray of light that shot forward. Over a dozen Sages in front of her were blasted away.

An instant later, she slowly raised both her palms, and the battlefield instantly trembled. After that, strands of faint energy appeared on her hands!

“Natural Energy!” Suddenly, one of the Sages exclaimed.

There were three types of energy at the beginning of the world. Primordial Violet Energy, Natural Energy, and Chaos Energy. Each of them carried different effects. Natural Energy was something that everyone had in their bodies. When they were in the womb, what did they rely on to breathe? It was Natural Energy. However, it would vanish when they were born. But it actually didn’t really vanish, and it remained within the body.

Of course, not everyone’s Natural Energy would remain within the body. Only those with special physiques like An Nanjing’s Martial God Physique were capable of preserving the Natural Energy in the body. Moreover, it could only preserve it, and it was absolutely difficult for the owner to control it.

Very few in the world could accomplish it, and An Nanjing was one of them!

Meanwhile, she suddenly vanished on the spot, and she was in front of the Sages when she appeared again. A moment later, she slammed her fist forward.

Bang!

A Sage before her instinctively defended himself, but he hadn’t even been able to react before he was obliterated.

The others were shocked by this scene!

“World Crusher!” Suddenly, An Nanjing’s voice resounded, and then a huge palm appeared. A moment later, he slammed down at the Sages here.

Just as it was named, it seemed like it was capable of crushing the world.

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze at this point.

She could persist for some time!

Regardless of whether it was An Nanjing or the monkey, while they couldn’t win, they could hold on for some time, just a while!

What about him?

Yang Ye slowly closed his eyes as he gazed at the Sages before him.

Run?

That was impossible!

Fight!

Fight to the death!

Yang Ye opened his eyes and looked up at the sky, “Brother Monkey, Jing’er, if nothing unexpected happens, then today will be the day we die. So, let’s kill to our heart’s content.”

As soon as he finished speaking, his sword trembled, and then he transformed into a ray of light that shot forward.

The first to step forward was the Devil Monarch. His eyes narrowed slightly while he raised his right hand slowly. In an instant, a pitch black tombstone flashed out from his palm. It expanded in the air and instantly expanded hundreds of times. At the same time, countless strands of black energy shot out like bolts of lightning. Yang Ye’s sword energy was instantly covered in the lightning, and the powerful force it carried instantly blasted Yang Ye away.

However, Yang Ye suddenly vanished while his figure was blasted away.

He was behind the Devil Monarch when he appeared again.

Backstab!

However, as soon as he appeared behind the Devil Monarch, a middle aged man with crimson red hair suddenly appeared in front of him.

The man had a blood red skeleton in his grasp, and it stopped Yang Ye’s attack. Moreover, a strand of red energy swept out from it and enveloped Yang Ye in an instant.

Meanwhile, a sword howl resounded within the red energy, and then a ray of sword energy tore through it. However, a pillar of red energy slammed against Yang Ye’s stomach.

Bam!

Yang Ye was instantly blasted away. At the moment he was blasted away, the Barbaric King suddenly appeared behind him, and he had a huge pitch black hammer in his grasp. He slammed it at Yang Ye’s head.

Yang Ye couldn’t dodge this attack!

Yang Ye didn’t dodge it and just allowed it to strike his head.

At the moment the hammer was about to strike Yang Ye’s head, the Barbaric King was stunned. Yang Ye’s going to die just like this?

He was very confident that if Yang Ye didn’t defend himself or dodge his attack, then the hammer would obliterate Yang Ye. However, his expression changed drastically when it actually struck Yang Ye’s head. Because a thin layer of armor had appeared on Yang Ye’s head.

The Primordial Armor!

Yang Ye had activated the Primordial Armor at the critical moment!

At the same time, Yang Ye stabbed his sword against the Barbaric King’s chest.

Hiss!

It sliced off half of the Barbaric King’s body, and then Yang Ye’s figure flashed over 1km to the right. However, as soon as he stopped himself, a wave of mysterious energy enveloped him. At this instantly, his mind was dazed, and he felt like he’d fallen into an abyss.

The Shaman Emperor!

It was a familiar feeling!

Yang Ye was alarmed. Suddenly, the Primordial Pagoda shook within him, and then golden light enveloped Yang Ye’s body. Or to be more precise, it protected his soul. As soon as it did that, the uncomfortable feeling he had vanished.

Meanwhile, the Shaman Emperor had appeared behind Yang Ye. However, his reaction was swift, and he swung a backhand stab at the Shaman Emperor!

Bang!

Yang Ye and the Shaman Emperor were blasted away from each other, but a few Sages immediately charged at him.

In the Primordial Pagoda!

At this moment, Snowy was beyond anxious, and there were pearls of tears in her eyes. The little fellow was jumping about and seemed to be trying to figure out a solution.

As for Tian Xiu, she stood there silently.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

The battle was at its peak.

Even if the money, An Nanjing, and Yang Ye used all their trump cards, losing was unavoidable. It was only a matter of time before they lost, and losing undoubtedly represented death for them!

An old man stood silently far away in the sky.

It was the Dao Progenitor.

Of course, he wasn’t standing by idly because he was emotionless. It was the overall situation in the large universe that made the entire universe target Yang Ye. If the Dao Path took Yang Ye’s side and went against the times, it would have to go against the entire large universe. The consequence of that was annihilation.

He wasn’t all alone, and he had the Dao Path to protect.

A single mistake could bring the annihilation of the Dao Path. Yang Ye had the Sprite Lord and refused to give it up, so it was an impossible dilemma. Actually, the Alliance of All wouldn’t let him live even if he gave up the Sprite Lord.

Since they were enemies with a genius like Yang Ye, it was best to annihilate him before he could grow further. Otherwise, the day he grew to his peak was the day they would face annihilation.

They wanted the Sprite Lord, but Yang Ye had to die too. That was what the Alliance of All, the buddhist Path, and the Weapon Path wanted!

The Dao Progenitor remained silent for a long time, and then he sighed and left.

Meanwhile, two women stood silently at the side.

It was Ding Shaoyao and Zhi’er.

Zhi’er asked, “Are we not going to do anything?”

Ding Shaoyao spoke with indifference on her face, “Wait.”

“Until when?” asked Zhi’er.

Ding Shaoyao stared at the battlefield for a long time before she answered, “Once they die in battle and cripple the Alliance of All’s Sages!”

Her voice was icy cold as ice, and there wasn’t a trace of emotion in it!
