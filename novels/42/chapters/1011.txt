Chapter 1012 – The Mermaid Clan!

Yang Ye slowly clenched his fists as he gazed at the stone tablet.

This scene before his eyes told him exactly how much hatred the Asura Queen had for human, and it told him how strong she was! Even though he could surmount his realm of cultivation to kill Saints, he knew that some Saints weren’t as weak as he imagined. Like Shang Yunxi and Jian Wuchen. If he were to fight them, then he would have no chance of winning unless he utilized Heaven’s Gravestone!

The Asura Queen was said to be the number one demon king of the prefecture, and that was equivalent to being the number one expert of the prefecture. Based on his current strength, even Heaven’s Gravestone might not be able to help him fight her equally!

Should I ask Jian Wuchen, Instructor Zhuo, and all the others to come here? Such a thought couldn’t help but appear within Yang Ye’s mind. No matter how strong the Asura Queen was, could she fight 10 on her own? But it didn’t take long for him to reject such a thought. Regardless of whether it was Jian Wuchen and the others from the Ancient Sword School or Instructor Zhuo and the others from Ocean of Clouds Academy, they couldn’t leave the sword school and the academy. Once there were no Saints left there, the consequences would be unimaginable. Moreover, it really wasn’t suitable for the academy and the sword school to enter into conflict with the demon race in the Zither of Love!

He had to rely on himself!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at the corpses of those Saints. A smile couldn’t help but curl up on the corners of his mouth. After all, they were ready to be made into Saint Realm puppets!

However, his smile froze when he arrived before them. Because it wasn’t just their souls which had been obliterated, even their bodies had been severely damaged. They merely seem unharmed on the surface, and they would transform into ashes from just the slightest touch!

What a pity! Yang Ye felt quite disappointed. Because if they were refined into Sword Servants, then it would be equivalent to possessing 4 more Saints on his side!

Yang Ye glanced at the corpses with regret and vanished on the spot.

...

The Zither of Love.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive before the ocean, and a boundless expanse of water laid before his eyes. He could faintly notice the outline of an island at the end of his vision.

Yang Ye stood at the shores for a long time, and then he suddenly removed his clothes and covered his lower body with beast skin. As for his upper body, it was completely bare. Moreover, he even draconified half his face so he seemed more like a member of the demon race. So, half his face was covered in scales, but since he’d only draconified half of his face, it was utterly impossible to discern any link between him and the Dragon Clan!

Asura Queen was hostile to humans here, but she didn’t reject the demon race. So, all members of the demon race could come here!

So, the Zither of Love was also a place where many demon beasts hid, especially those who had deep enmity with humans.

“Hey, kid over there! Are you going to Teal Island?” Suddenly, a voice resounded. Yang Ye looked over to its source and saw a boat had suddenly appeared on the surface, and an old man and woman in a blue dress were on it. Yang Ye noticed that both of them had the bodies of fishes.

They were members of the Mermaid Clan!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and then his figure flashed and was about to fly towards the boat. However, he was shocked to realize that an invisible force instantly pressed him back down when he was about to leave the ground.

There were restrictions here!

Meanwhile, the old man and woman moved the boat over to the shore, and the old man sized up Yang Ye and chuckled, “You’ve come from the outside, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “How did you know?”

“I knew the moment you tried to fly!” The old man chuckled, “Because only those from the Zither of Love know that one can’t fly here!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

The old man chuckled, “How would my Mermaid Clan earn inner cores if all of you can fly over?”

Yang Ye was speechless.

“It’s 5 Exalt Realm inner cores for the trip to Teal Island, alright? I’m leaving if you refuse!” said the old man.

Yang Ye glanced at the sky. There were restrictions there, and it wasn’t difficult for him to break through them with his current strength. But it would draw too much attention. He had to keep a low profile this time.

Yang Ye leaped up and descended on the boat, and then he flicked an inner core to the old man.

The old man and the woman were slightly stunned when they saw the inner core. Meanwhile, the woman suddenly passed it back to Yang Ye and spoke softly, “We only ask for 5 Exalt Realm inner cores. This... this is a Monarch Realm inner core....”

Yang Ye asked, “You think it isn’t enough?”

She hurriedly shook her head and said, “No, not at all. It’s too much. A single Monarch Realm inner core is sufficient to get 1,000 Exalt Realm inner cores. You’ve paid too much!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Isn’t that a good thing?”

She raised her head to glance at Yang Ye, and then she spoke softly, “Our Mermaid Clan takes its reputation seriously, and we only accept what we deserve!”

Yang Ye was quite surprised when he heard her, and then he sized her up. She was quite weak as she was only at the Exalt Realm. As for her appearance, it was pretty but couldn’t be considered to be beautiful. However, she wasn’t ugly as well. Her face was one that one could look at for a long time without getting bored.

She blushed a little when she noticed her gaze, and then she hurriedly placed it on Yang Ye’s palm before returning to the old man’s side.

As for the old man, he gazed at Yang Ye with a slightly vigilant gaze.

Yang Ye was quite embarrassed. But he was thick skinned as well, so he acted like nothing had happened. After that, he flicked the Monarch Realm inner core back to the woman and said, “I don’t have any other intentions, and I just want to ask about some things. Just take it as your compensation, alright?”

The woman spoke softly, “It’s still too much!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. It wasn’t that he wanted to force them to take that inner core, it was because the least precious inner core he had was a Monarch Realm inner core!

Yang Ye forced a smile on his face, “It’s not much, not much at all.”

The woman intended to say something else, but Yang Ye suddenly said, “Alright, let me be honest. I don’t have Exalt Realm inner cores, and I only have Monarch Realm inner cores. I’ll have no choice but to leave this boat if you refuse.”

Both of them were slightly stunned. Obviously, they hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually be so rich! She hesitated for a moment, and then looked at the old man. The latter nodded lightly. She stopped hesitating when the old man nodded and put the inner core away. After that, she said, “Go... go on ahead and ask me anything. I’ll definitely answer you if I know the answer!”

After she took the inner core, the old man’s tail which was in the water started to sway from right to left, and the boat instantly shot forward like an arrow!

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment before he said, “Is Immortal Island far from here?”

“Immortal Island?” The woman was quite surprised, “You want to head to Immortal Island?”

Yang Ye asked, “Can’t I?”

“Of course you can’t!” She continued, “That’s the Asura Queen’s territory. Not to mention demons from outside the ocean, even we who live in the Zither of Love aren’t allowed to go there!

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She answered, “Because it’s a paradise of cultivation, and only the greatest geniuses of the various clans have a chance to go there.”

Yang Ye was delighted when he heard this and asked, “Do you think I’m a genius?”

She glanced at him and asked softly, “What’s your realm of cultivation?”

Only when she asked this question did Yang Ye realize that he’d concealed his aura with the Sword Domain. Right when he was about to remove the Sword Domain, the woman continued, “Actually, you can’t go there regardless of how strong you are.”

Yang Ye was bewildered, “Why?”

She answered, “Because only demon beasts from the Zither of Love are allowed to.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time before he asked, “Is there no other way?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

She hesitated for a moment before she said, “There is one. You can marry a female demon who lives in the Zither of Love. You can go to the Immortal Island then. Of course, the precondition is that you possess sufficient strength. Otherwise, you’ll be rejected.”

Marry someone from the Zither of Love? Yang Ye was quite stunned, and then his gaze descended onto the woman. Her face turned pale when she noticed his gaze, and then she hurriedly shook her head, “I... I... I can’t. I....”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly because he knew that she’d misunderstood.

Bang!

Suddenly, a pillar of water shot out from the water, and their boat was instantly forced to a stop.

The pillar of water dispersed, and then a few men who held tridents in their grasps appeared within Yang Ye’s field of vision. The men had the bodies of men and the heads of sharks, and all of them were at the Monarch Realm!

The expressions of the old man and the woman changed drastically when they saw those men!

The man who led the ground glanced past Yang Ye and the old man, and then his gaze descended onto the woman. His eyes instantly lit up when he saw her, “I never expected my luck to be so good. I actually encountered a beautiful mermaid. Hahaha! Kill the man and the old man, but don’t harm the woman. We can sell her for a good price once we’ve had our fun!”

The woman’s face instantly turned ghastly pale upon hearing the man.

Yang Ye frowned, and he slowly clenched his right fist.

The Sharkman who led the group waved his right hand and ordered, “Attack!”

“Wait!” Suddenly, the old man pointed at Yang Ye and roared loudly, “He has inner cores, a huge number of inner cores. The weakest amongst them is at the Monarch Realm!”

When he spoke up to this point, he waved his hand, and the Monarch Realm inner core in the woman’s spatial ring flew into his grasp, “See? He gave this to us. He really has Monarch Realm inner cores, and he has a very huge number of them!”

Yang Ye who was about to launch an attack was instantly stunned when he heard the old man.
