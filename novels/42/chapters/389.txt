Chapter 390 – Love Without Regrets!

At this critical moment, Xi Luo who was standing below the arena had suddenly leaped up onto it and stood in front of Yang Ye. Yang Ye frowned slightly and was just about to speak when Xi Luo spoke first. “Leave him to me!”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he said, “Is it because of Nangong Meng?”

Xi Luo nodded.

Yang Ye said, “How is your strength in comparison to Nangong Meng and Li Qingshui?”

“We’re on par with each other!” said Xi Luo.

“He’s at the Spirit Realm right now, but what about you?”

“The King Realm!”

“Then you still intend to give your life away?” Yang Ye stared him in the eye while a trace of anger had appeared in Yang Ye’s eyes. Even though he didn’t have a close relationship with Xi Luo, there was a certain amount of friendship between them after getting along with each other during this period. While they didn’t speak of it explicitly, he believed that Xi Luo had taken him to be a friend as well!

“I know!” Xi Luo nodded.

“Then....”

Xi Luo grinned and interrupted Yang Ye. “Do you know? Meng’meng always says that I’m carefree, fooling around instead of focusing on my cultivation, immature, not as calm and mature as Li Qingshui, not as hardworking as Li Qingshui, not....”

When he spoke up to here, Xi Luo shook his head and grinned, yet his smile was slightly bitter. He said, “But she didn’t know that I truly did love her. The reason I worked hard on my cultivation was merely to catch up to her footsteps and so that I would have the qualifications to be with her. She didn’t know that the reason I didn’t focus on my cultivation was actually because I wanted to spend time with her. She didn’t know that the reason I acted in such a carefree manner was merely so that I could make her happy.... But she still chose Li Qingshui in the end!”

“Then do you still intend to die for her?” asked Yang Ye.

Xi Luo nodded and said, “I just want to prove that I, Xi Luo, can die for her. Even if it’s impossible for her to be aware of it....” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye fell silent. He couldn’t say Xi Luo was stupid nor did he have the right to do so. Moreover, he couldn’t find any reason to refuse Xi Luo’s request. Because love was really something that lasted through life and death!

“Don’t worry, I, Xi Luo, aren’t that weak!” Meanwhile, Xi Luo suddenly smiled and said, “Even though he’s very strong, I still have some trump cards.”

When he spoke up to here, he fell silent for a short while before he said, “Help me do something if I die!”

“Go on!”

Xi Luo took a deep breath and said, “Help bury me where she died. In the past, she said that I was annoying. So be it. I’ll annoy her for eternity. In any case, she can’t refuse now. Hahahaha....”

As soon as he finished speaking, Xi Luo turned around to gaze at Luo Xue, and then the enormous ax appeared in his grasp with a flip of his palm. After that, the profound energy within him surged explosively as he swung it directly towards Luo Xue!

Luo Xue shook his head and said, “I really don’t understand why you have to be so stupid? Is it really worth dying for a woman who didn’t love you? After all, life is very precious, and it would be gone as soon as you die!”

“Cut the crap!” Xi Luo roared furiously as his figure flashed and instantly arrived in front of Luo Xue. The enormous ax in his hand emanated a sharp whistled as it chopped down forcefully!

“Too weak!” Luo Xue moved his finger slightly, and then Xi Luo’s enormous ax was instantly blasted away by a strange strand of force. On the other hand, Luo Xue pressed forward and smash a punch at Xi Luo’s chest, causing a mouthful of blood to spray from the latter’s mouth while his body was blasted flying!

An Nanjing shook her head slightly, and then she closed her eyes.

The spectators remained silent. All of them had discerned that Xi Luo wasn’t a match for Luo Xue at all. If they were in the same realm of cultivation, then perhaps Xi Luo would have a slight chance. However, Luo Xue was a Spirit Realm profounder now, and the difference between them was like the difference between the heavens and the earth. So, Xi Luo was just looking for death!

After a short while, Xi Luo stood up slowly, and he’d just stood up straight when a mouthful of fresh blood sprayed once more from between his lips.

Xi Luo wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth before a savage expression flashed through his eyes. He flipped his palm, and then three 5 inch long golden needles appeared in his hand.

A wisp of a resolute expression flashed in Xi Luo’s eyes as he gazed at them, and then he pushed one each into the center of his forehead and both his temples!

Bang!

A terrifying aura surged explosively from within Xi Luo. This aura wasn’t inferior to the aura of a Spirit Realm expert, and it even surpassed it slightly!

“You improved your cultivation by force with a secret technique?” Luo Xue shook his head and said, “Looks like you really do seek death because you actually utilized such a secret technique that would harm your foundation. Unfortunately, do you think that you can really avenge the woman you love with just this? How laughable!”

“You really do spout a bunch of crap!” Xi Luo shouted furiously as his figure flashed, and he instantly tore through the air and chopped the ax down towards Luo Xue’s head. This strike was swift as a bolt of lightning, and the strength behind it was more than 10 times stronger than before!

A wisp of disdain arose on the corners of Luo Xue’s mouth while that strand of electricity suddenly erupted from his palm. In an instant, an area of over 10m around him had been enveloped by the violet electricity.

Yang Ye’s heart constricted. After a short while, he took a deep breath and tightened his grip on Dragonbone, and his Slaughter Sword Intent couldn’t help but slowly seep out from within him!

Mo Ke shook his head slightly. This fellow, Xi Luo, is very strong, but the gap between him and Luo Xue is too huge. Especially when Luo Xue clearly didn’t hold back and immediately utilized that Natural Treasure upon attacking. How could this fellow, Xi Luo, resist him?

After a short while passed, the electricity dispersed, and then a charred corpse appeared on the arena.

“You were slightly stronger when compared to the other two. Unfortunately, you’re still too weak in my opinion!” Luo Xue shook his head slowly, and then he waved his right hand and the electricity in the surroundings instantly dispersed.

Yang Ye’s aura calmed down instead when he saw that corpse. He walked slowly up the arena and gazed at the unrecognizable corpse, and then he took a deep breath as if he was suppressing something. He crouched down and said in a low voice, “Don’t worry, I’ll bury you with the woman you love!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye waved his right hand and sent Xi Luo’s corpse off the arena. After that, he said, “Even though we only knew each other for a short while, we fought together in the end, and we can be considered to be friends. Since we can be considered to be friends, then I naturally have to avenge you. Just watch and see how I avenge you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Slaughter Sword Intent surged out from within Yang Ye, and then a fine strand of flame instantly covered Dragonbone. He pointed Dragonbone at Luo Xue while a strand of light flickered incessantly at the tip of his sword.

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath. He swiftly stomped his right foot on the ground, and then the entire arena trembled violently. He relied on the enormous counterforce from the ground to tear explosively through the air and arrive in front of Luo Xue, and then he swiftly stabbed Dragonbone forward.

Clang!

The tip of an enormous black brush struck the tip of Yang Ye’s sword. After a moment of silence, an enormous bang resounded as the two of them split apart!

At this moment, Luo Xue had a black and enormous brush in his right hand while the violet electricity resided on his left!

An Nanjing frowned slightly when she saw that black and enormous brush, and it felt like she’d seen it somewhere....

Yang Ye wasn’t one who liked to waste his breath. Even though he was curious about that brush, he wasn’t stupid enough to actually ask about it. A golden sword chest appeared with a flip of his palm, and then he issued a command in his heart, causing 200 swords to shoot into the air. These swords didn’t form a sword formation, and they converged together to overlap and form an extraordinarily huge sword!

With a flick of his finger, the Nether Ghostflame shot out explosively and appeared at the tip of the enormous sword.

Bang!

The entire enormous sword seemed as if it was on fire, and it became an enormous flaming sword!

“Go!” Yang Ye shouted. The enormous sword left a trail of flame behind as it shot explosively towards Luo Xue. At the same time, Yang Ye had Dragonbone in his grasp as he stomped the ground with his right foot, and he followed closely behind the flaming sword as he shot explosively at Luo Xue.

Luo Xue had a slightly solemn expression in his eyes, and he slowly tightened his grip on the violet electricity in his left hand. In the next moment, he suddenly clenched down tightly.

Bang!

An explosion resounded as countless bolts of electricity instantly appeared around Luo Xue. After that, Luo Xue suddenly slapped his palm towards Yang Ye and the enormous sword.

In an instant, it was like countless bolts of electricity had shot out explosively like sharp arrows!

Moreover, they carried a shocking impetus with them!

The spectators were flabbergasted by the scene on the Hidden Dragon Arena. Exactly which Natural Treasure will reign supreme in this collision? Who will be the final victor of the battle between the Sword Emperor, Yang Ye, and this mysterious expert, Luo Xue?
