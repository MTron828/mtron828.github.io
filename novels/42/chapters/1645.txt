Chapter 1646 - I Didn’t Expect Him To Be So Weak!

Translator: InVader

The wooden sword!

Yang Ye gazed at Snowy and the wooden sword, and he was stunned. After that, he took the wooden sword in his left hand and quickly sent Snowy back into the Primordial Pagoda. Because the space that was 10m away from him had vanished completely.

It naturally didn’t vanish for no reason, and it had vanished because a mysterious wave of energy was stretching towards him.

Meanwhile, that mysterious energy had arrived before him.

Yang Ye looked down at the wooden sword in his grasp. He didn’t know why it wasn’t rejecting him, but he knew that it was definitely because of Snowy. He was really curious about how Snowy had convinced it to help him.

Of course, he didn’t have the time to think about that right now.

Yang Ye closed his eyes while slaughter intent surged madly towards the wooden sword. However, the wooden sword suddenly shook violently, and then a ray of light rippled out from it. In an instant, Yang Ye’s slaughter intent was obliterated!

It rejected it!

The wooden sword rejected slaughter intent!

Yang Ye was stunned. He hadn’t expected it to reject slaughter intent. Moreover, he could sense that it was actually very angry!

Yang Ye fell silent for an instant, and then he issued a command in his heart. The slaughter intent surged completely back into his body, and then sword intent appeared around him. Once the sword intent appeared, he didn’t even have to issue a command before the wooden sword trembled and absorbed all the sword intent!

Yang Ye glanced at the wooden sword, and then he slowly closed his eyes. Meanwhile, the mysterious energy was just less than 2m away from him.

A moment of silence ensued before Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes, and then he transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

The Sword of Rebirth!

The same technique but with a different sword!

At the moment Yang Ye vanished, the space around him suddenly collapsed, and then a ray of light surged in Yang Lu’s direction. Everywhere it passed, space collapsed and was obliterated, and the destruction was swiftly spreading in all directions. In just an instant, the space in an area of over 10,000km had been completely obliterated!

Moreover, the mysterious energy Yang Lu created had suddenly stopped on the spot when the ray of light appeared, and then it started to disperse slowly like ice melting beneath the scorching sun!

Actually, many hadn’t even been able to witness all of this. Because at the moment Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot, it has been absolutely too swift. Only some comparatively stronger experts here could see Yang Ye’s movements.

As for the rest, all they saw was the ray of light appear, space collapsed, and then a ray of light appeared in front of Yang Lu.

At the moment Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light and vanished on the spot, Yang Lu’s face had instantly become solemn, and there was a trace of shock in his eyes.

A moment later, he pushed her right palm forward, and he struck Yang Ye’s wooden sword with his palm!

Bang!

As soon as they collided, the space in a huge area instantly cracked apart. At the same time, Yang Lu’s feet scraped against the ground as his figure was pushed backwards by the impact.

Something worth mentioning was that after Yang Lu’s figure moved around 300m back, the ground in a huge area around him had suddenly started to collapse and cave down. In just an instant, a huge abyss had appeared on the ground, and the ground at its bottom was still collapsing incessantly.

It was because Yang Lu had diverted the force to the ground!

At this moment, everyone was stunned on the spot.

Did he take something to enhance his strength? Everyone here was wondering the same thing. Because Yang Ye had actually pushed a True Realm expert back! But it didn’t take long for some with sharp gazes to notice the wooden sword that Yang Ye was holding.

Far above in the sky, Yang Gu and Yang Ceng’s gazes descended onto the wooden sword in Yang Ye’s grasp. At this moment, there was quite a solemn expression in their eyes.

A few breaths of time passed before Yang Ceng said, “Is it that sword?”

Yang Gu nodded, “It should be.”

Yang Ceng asked, “What’s it doing in his possession?”

Yang Gu shook his head, “That isn’t the main point. The main point is why it chose him. That sword is one that seeks the absolute truth, absolute kindness, absolute pride, and absolute benevolence. All of its past owners were kind and just people… But Yang Ye is… This doesn’t make sense.”

Yang Ceng shook his head slightly, “Stop guessing. We’ll know once we ask him.”

Yang Gu nodded, “True.”

Meanwhile, Gu Xiu and Qian Hu were staring at the sword in Yang Ye’s hand. A moment of silence ensued before Gu Xiu spoke in a low voice, “What sword is that?”

Qian Hu shook her head, “I’ve never seen it in my life.”

Gu Xiu fell silent for a moment and said, “It’s so powerful!”

Qian Hu fell silent while her face was very gloomy.

Meanwhile, Yang Xuan glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent.

On the battlefield.

Yang Ye had stopped. He didn’t follow up with another attack because he was almost exhausted. No, it wasn’t almost. He was exhausted. That attack had exhausted all his profound energy and physical strength. Moreover, he felt that both his mind and soul were extraordinarily tired!

This sword is quite extraordinary! Yang Ye thought to himself.

Actually, he was very well aware that his current strength was insufficient to use the sword. Because he could sense that the strength it just revealed was far from its true strength. However, his strength wasn’t sufficient, so he couldn’t bring out that strength!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at the wooden sword. Meanwhile, the wooden sword shook abruptly, and then it transformed into a ray of light that entered his body.

Yang Ye was rendered speechless by the sight of this.

Meanwhile, Yang Lu glanced at his palm. At this moment, it had cracked open, it had cracked open completely, and the cracks extended all the way to his wrist. He fell silent for a moment, and then he looked up at Yang Ye, “I didn’t expect that sword to be in your possession.”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “You know its origins?” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Yang Lu replied with a question, “You don’t?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Yang Lu glanced at Yang Ye, “That’s interesting.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

Yang Lu shook his head slightly, “You’ll find out in the future.”

He glanced at the surroundings and continued, “My Discipline Hall didn’t act fairly today and was in the wrong. We admit our mistakes. However, if you think my Discipline Hall is easy to bully, then feel free to try!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned to look at Yang Ye, “You can try it too.”

His figure vanished on the spot.

Once Yang Lu vanished, Lu Lige’s expression suddenly changed, “Watch out!”

At the same moment, Yang Ye turned to look towards the distance. At this moment, a figure was flashing rapidly towards him.

It was Yang Xu.

Once Yang Lu failed to kill Yang Ye, Yang Xu knew that if he and his grandson wanted to survive, they had to kill Yang Ye, and this was the best opportunity to do that!

Because even an idiot could discern that Yang Ye was exhausted, and he didn’t have much strength left. At this moment, not to mention a Zenith Realm expert, even a Rebirth Realm expert would be able to kill Yang Ye with ease.

Yang Ye’s face fell. He had no profound energy left within him, and his body was completely exhausted. In his current state, he couldn’t resist a single attack from Yang Xu. However, he refused to just wait for death to arrive.

Right when he was about to risk everything to defend himself, a golden spear suddenly shot down like a bolt of lightning from the sky. It was extremely swift and instantly collided with Yang Xu.

Bang!

Yang Xu was blasted around 3km away.

In an instant, everyone looked towards the area in front of Yang Ye. A woman had appeared there.

It was none other than An Nanjing!

“She’s strong!” Yang Gu gazed at An Nanjing and spoke solemnly, “Just a casual attack from her repulsed a Zenith Realm expert that truly reached the zenith. Who is she?”

Yang Gu’s question was the same question that many people had in their minds, and all of their gazes descended upon An Nanjing.

However, An Nanjing gazed at Yang Ye, “Are you alright?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “I wouldn’t be if you didn’t get here in time.”

She turned to look at Yang Xu and asked, “Do you want him dead or alive?”

The countless spectators were stunned once more when they heard her.

Do you want him dead or alive?

Isn’t she a little too arrogant?

Yang Ye was slightly stunned as well. He glanced at An Nanjing and replied, “Alive.”

An Nanjing nodded slightly, “Ten moves!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished on the spot.

Bang!

At the exact same moment, an explosion resounded abruptly in the distance. After that, everyone watched with shock as Yang Xu’s figure was blasted 3km away!

Everyone was astounded!

Suddenly, An Nanjing vanished on the spot again.

Bang!

Yang Xu was blasted away again, and he flew over 6km away this time!

Yang Gu and Yang Ceng exchanged glances, and both of them saw a serious and shocked expression in each other’s eyes!

Meanwhile, An Nanjing tapped her right foot down, and then her figure vanished on the spot again.

Bang!

Yang Xu was blasted backwards again. This time, he flew for almost 10km before he finally stopped himself. As soon as his figure stopped, a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth. He wiped off the blood and looked up at An Nanjing, “Who are you?!”

An Nanjing didn’t speak. She just raised Skysplit and pointed it at Yang Xu. A moment later, her figure spun around on the spot, and then she tossed Skysplit in Yang Xu’s direction.

A ray of golden light flashed.

Crack!

The sound of bones breaking resounded abruptly, and everyone immediately moved their gazes towards Yang Xu.

Yang Xu’s expression had changed drastically as he quickly slapped his palm forward.

Hiss!

The spear pierced through Yang Xu’s palm, and the powerful force within it carried Yang Xu’s figure along as it continued forward.

Bang!

In the end, Yang Xu was nailed to the city wall.

He didn’t have the slightest ability to fight back!

He’d been utterly crushed!

All the spectators were rendered speechless by this scene.

Yang Ye gazed at An Nanjing, “You said ten moves, but you only used four.”

An Nanjing glanced at Yang Xu, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “I didn’t expect him to be so weak.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “I only used 40% of my strength.”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
