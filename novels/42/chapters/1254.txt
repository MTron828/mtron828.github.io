Chapter 1255 – Let’s Fight!

It wasn’t a person but an ape standing outside the entrance!

The black ape!

That ape which Yang Ye had dragged down with him that day!

At this moment, the black ape was at a normal size. Yang Ye hadn’t expected the black ape to chase him here! Once he recovered from his shock, Yang Ye secretly grew vigilant because this fellow was extremely strong, so he couldn’t afford to be careless. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The black ape stood on the spot while his gaze locked onto Yang Ye, and then he slammed his fist towards Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly. He grabbed Yun Banqing by the waist with his left hand before tossing her to the side, and then he stomped his right foot against the ground and charged at the black ape.

He would naturally not use his fist to go head-on against the black ape. After all, he didn’t want to inflict suffering onto himself.

A cold glow flashed as his sword shot forward.

Sword and fist collided.

Bang!

A muffled explosion resounded while Yang Ye was blasted 30m away, and the black ape was pushed around 10m back as well. Moreover, there was a bloody mark on his fist.

It wasn’t difficult for Yang Ye to pierce the black ape’s defenses while he had a sword in hand!

The black ape’s face turned gloomy when he saw the injury on his fist. He didn’t waste his breath at all and instantly vanished on the spot. Yang Ye immediately sensed a strand of terrifying force assault him, and it felt like a huge mountain crashing down upon him!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then Rebirth Rank sword intent appeared out of thin air before him. It blocked off the terrifying pressure, and then Yang Ye’s figure transformed into a bolt of lightning that flashed forward.

Om!

Bang!

Along with a sword howl and an explosion, the space here swiftly cracked apart, and then rays of light flickered both horizontally and vertically through the surroundings.

Yun Banqing clenched her fists tightly when she witnessed this scene, and anxiety filled her eyes. At this moment, both Yang Ye and the black ape were so swift that she couldn’t catch sight of them, and she could just see flickering rays of light and hear successive explosions.

A Voider Realm demon beast!

To a certain extent, Voider Realm demon beasts were much stronger than human Voiders. It was none other than because their defensive capabilities were too terrifying. It wasn’t even a huge problem for them to go head-on against Void Rank techniques. Yang Ye’s attacks could pierce through the black ape’s defenses, but they were only superficial injuries that didn’t cause any material harm to the black ape!

Bang!

Another explosion resounded, and both man and ape separated from each other.

There were numerous bloody marks on the black ape’s body. As for Yang Ye, there was a wisp of scarlet red seeping out of the corner of his mouth. Based on their outward appearance, Yang Ye had the upper hand. Of course, it was mainly due to the Phantom Shield. Even the black ape found it difficult to inflict any material harm on Yang Ye while Yang Ye had the Phantom Shield. However, even the Phantom Shield couldn’t fully protect Yang Ye from the black ape’s strength.

The black ape was too strong. Even if his strength couldn’t penetrate the Phantom Shield, the aftershock from it couldn’t be underestimated. The blood coming from the corner of Yang Ye’s mouth had been caused from the impact of their collisions!

The black ape stared at Yang Ye while Yang Ye stared at him as well. A moment later, both man and beast vanished on the spot.

They didn’t waste their breaths on each other, nor did they have anything to say. The hatred that the black ape held for Yang Ye was truly deep. After all, he’d almost been killed because of Yang Ye!

He’d really almost lost his life!

Moreover, Yang Ye had threatened him repeatedly. So, how could he endure it? Thus, he’d decided to pursue Yang Ye in the end. After all, once they entered Sword God’s Palace, he wouldn’t have to fear Yang Ye even if Yang Ye used his sword.

Rage blazes when enemies meet. So what was there to say? They fought immediately!

Yang Ye had a fiery temper as well. Since the black ape had attacked right away, he naturally wouldn’t waste his breath.

Even if he intended to say something, he would say it after fighting the black ape!

Yang Ye didn’t choose to go head-on against the black ape, and he wouldn’t dare to do so even if he possessed Rebirth Rank sword intent and the Phantom Shield. After all, the black ape’s strength was too terrifying! Just a single punch might cause his internal organs to be injured.

He’d tried to locate the black ape’s flaws, but he’d completely failed. The black ape’s strength was utterly superior over him, so it was useless even if he could locate the flaws in the black ape’s attacks. This time, he slightly understood how his opponents felt. Those with formidable physical bodies were truly too difficult to fight. Not to mention anything else, just that physical defense was sufficient to cause others a huge headache!

Bang!

Fist and sword collided once more. Yang Ye’s sword shook violently while his figure was pushed over 100m back. As for the black ape, he was pushed around 10m back as well. But it didn’t take long for him to vanish on the spot, and he was in front of Yang Ye when he appeared again. He slammed his fist towards Yang Ye’s head!

Meanwhile, the Phantom Shield flashed out before Yang Ye and shielded him against the punch.

Bang!

The Phantom Shield shook violently and was blasted flying, but the black ape was pushed around 10m back as well. Meanwhile, Yang Ye pressed forward, drew his sword, and swung it forcefully at the black ape. At the same time, the Phantom Shield followed him like a shadow and appeared by his side. It blocked every single punch that came from the black ape.

After he learned to use the Phantom Shield well, Yang Ye grew more and more immersed in the battle, and he would hurriedly utilize the Phantom Shield to block the black ape’s attack once he swung around 2 times.

For a time, Yang Ye actually gained a slight advantage in the battle!

Roar!

Meanwhile, the black ape suddenly roared with fury. He actually didn’t choose to go on the defensive when Yang Ye’s sword stabbed at him, and he similarly slammed his fist at Yang Ye’s chest. Moreover, his other fist shot towards the Phantom Shield.

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly. He naturally didn’t dare to risk his life like that while fighting the black ape, so his sword moved slightly to the side and stabbed the black ape’s fist.

Bang! Bang!

The Phantom Shield and his sword shook violently at the same time, and then Yang Ye was blasted away. As for the black ape, he didn’t stop at all, and he immediately shot forward before his fists rained down upon Yang Ye.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Numerous explosions instantly resounded, and Yang Ye was forced back repeatedly by the frenzied attacks of the black ape.

Bang!

Meanwhile, a pillar of blood surged out from Yang Ye. At the same time, a red glow swept out and instantly pushed the black ape back.

A blood red sword appeared in Yang Ye’s grasp, and then he transformed into a ray of red light that vanished on the spot.

The black ape’s eyes narrowed slightly as he swiftly swung his right fist forward, and it had just shot forward when a blood red sword struck it.

Bang!

Crack!

The powerful force within the fist and sword instantly cracked the surrounding space apart, and both the black ape and Yang Ye were blasted away.

But just a moment later, both the man and ape charged once more at each other!

Just like that, they were locked in fierce combat again.

After quite some time passed, Yang Ye blasted the black ape back with a swing of his sword, and then he stopped and said, “Big fella, do you really want to fight to the death!?”

The black ape stopped as well, and he gazed at Yang Ye and said, “You stole my fruits, threatened me to resist that mysterious expert with you, almost cost me my life, and even threatened me repeatedly! Human! You started this war!”

Yang Ye replied, “Wasn’t it just a few fruits? You’re being too petty and actually chased me all the way here!”

“You shameless human!” As soon as the black ape finished speaking, he was about to attack once more. But the Sword God’s Seal suddenly appeared on Yang Ye’s forehead, and he was instantly stunned by the sight of it. There was shock, disbelief, astonishment, and even a trace of fear in his fist-sized eyes.

“The Sword God’s Seal.... You....” The black ape gazed at Yang Ye, “You obtained the Sword God’s Seal!”

Yang Ye sized up the black ape and recalled the black ape’s attitude towards the Sword God’s Seal, and he immediately spoke seriously, “Of course, I’m the master of Sword God’s Palace right now!”

The black ape gazed at the Sword God’s Seal for a long time before he said, “Why did it choose such a shameless human like you?” He seemed like he was speaking to Yang Ye, yet it also seemed like he was speaking to himself.

Yang Ye’s face instantly darkened when he heard this, “Do you know how to speak to others? What do you mean shameless human?”

The black ape refused to give Yang Ye any face, “You’ve always been very shameless!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. He was just about to speak when the black ape spoke abruptly, “Human! No matter what, since it has chosen you, then don’t bring shame to it!”

The black ape turned around and walked away once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye was stunned by the sight of this, and he said, “Wait!”

The black ape turned around to gaze at Yang Ye, “What?”

Yang Ye replied, “You... you’re leaving just like that?”

The black ape answered, “What else would I do?”

Yang Ye gulped, “I have the Sword God’s Seal, so I’m the master of Sword God’s Palace right now, and you were once a member of Sword God’s Palace. In other words, you should obey me, right?”

The black ape gazed at Yang Ye for a short while before he said, “You have the Sword God’s Seal, so you’re considered the master of Sword God’s Palace, but do you possess the founding ancestor’s strength?”

Yang Ye was speechless.

The black ape said, “I once received the founding ancestor’s guidance and care while I was young, and it was he who gave the order that the members of Sword God’s Palace aren’t allowed to willfully slaughter the demon beasts on the island. All of us demon beasts on the island feel indebted to him, and it’s the same for me. So, I’ll let bygones be bygones for what happened between us.”

Yang Ye said, “So, you consider this as repaying your debt?”

The black ape replied, “Sort of.”

Yang Ye suddenly said, “You’re the shameless one!”

The black ape’s face fell, “Human! While I don’t want to kill you, I really want to beat you up. Don’t force me to attack you!”

Yang Ye said, “He guided you and took care of you all those years ago, and he even ordered the members of Sword God’s Palace to not slaughter the demon beasts on the island. He can be said to have given you new life. Yet you intend to repay such a huge debt by deciding not to kill me. So tell me, how are you not shameless? Besides that, while I can’t defeat you, you’ll definitely be unable to kill me if I choose to flee, right?”

The black ape said, “Human! Stop beating around the bush and just be frank about your intentions!”

Yang Ye replied, “I think that you should be a little sincere if you want to repay him. Presently, Sword God’s Palace has been destroyed, and sword cultivation has fallen into decline. While I carry the heavy responsibility of bringing prosperity back to sword cultivation. But I’m sure you’ve noticed that I’m so weak and without any backing, so I might be killed at any moment. Thus....”

Yang Ye gazed at the black ape and continued, “So, I think that if you really want to repay your debt, then you should help me. Help me breathe new life into sword cultivation throughout the continent and allow the past members of Sword God’s Palace to have a home to return to!”

The black ape gazed at Yang Ye for a short while and said, “Go on! Continue trying to trick me!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
