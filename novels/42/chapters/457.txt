Chapter 458 – Yang Ye’s Reputation!

Yang Ye and Ye Yun walked out of the hall and looked up into the air. An old man was floating in midair, and Shangguan Ji who Ye Yun struck earlier was standing by the old man’s side. At this moment, Shangguan Ji was staring at Ye Yun and Yang Ye with a savage gaze.

“Young Master Ye....” Pei Hu who came outside with them gazed at them with slight worry. Even though he knew that Yang Ye’s background was definitely extraordinary, they were facing the Shangguan Clan in the end. Even though the four great clans of the Imperial Capital couldn’t compare to the Origin School and the other extraordinary sects, they weren’t existences that an ordinary person could shake!

Pei Jun stretched out her hand and took Ye Yun’s hand in her grasp while her eyes were filled with worry. Ye Yun smiled to her and said, “Don’t worry, It’s only one Exalt Realm expert. My Big Brother can deal with him!”

Pei Jun nodded lightly but the worry in her eyes hadn’t vanished.

“Was it you who struck a member of my Shangguan Clan?” The old man gazed at Yang Ye and asked this question in a low voice. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Third Uncle, why waste your breath on him. Just kill them! Annihilate the Pei Estate for me as well! But don’t kill that woman. I want her alive, and I’ll make her suffer all sorts of torture until she dies because she actually dared to betray me and have an illicit relationship with some other guy!” Shangguan Ji roared madly as he looked at Ye Yun and Pei Jun’s interlocked hands.

“Young Master Shangguan, my daughter, Pei Jun, doesn’t have any connections to you at all, right? So isn’t it inappropriate to say that she betrayed you?” Pei Hu spoke in a low voice. If it was at any other time, he would naturally not dare to refuse to give Shangguan Ji face. But these two mysterious young men were here, so he had a little confidence. Of course, he mainly desired to clear his daughter’s name. Because he didn’t want there to be any misunderstandings between his daughter and this genius son-in-law of his.

“She doesn’t have any connections to me? She’s a woman that I, Shangguan Ji, have taken a liking to. She’s mine and is connected to me. Pei Hu, don’t blame this Young Master for refusing to give you a chance. Kill the two of them for me, and then bring your daughter to my Shangguan Clan. Perhaps your Pei Estate will have a chance at survival then. Otherwise, hmph! This Young Master will annihilate everyone from your Pei Estate!” Shangguan Ji spoke ferociously.

Pei Hu was instantly infuriated upon hearing this, and he said furiously, “You’re simply going too far!”

“Going too far?” The old man grunted coldly and said, “Pei Hu, it’s an honor for your Pei Estate that a member of my Shangguan Clan has taken a liking to your daughter. But not only do you refuse to feel grateful, you’ve even joined forces with outsiders to injury a member of my Shangguan Clan! Hmph! I think you want to see your Pei Estate eliminated from the Imperial Capital!”

Yang Ye shook his head. He’d realized that both the old and the young were the same type of trash. Since it was like that, he felt that there was no need to waste his breath.

Bang!

The Ninth Hell Swordwings flashed into appearance on Yang Ye’s back, and then a violent gale arose as his figure flashed into the air. After that, he flipped his palm, and Void Flash appeared in his grasp. He raised Void Flash and pointed it at the old man before a red glow suddenly surged out from the tip of his sword, and it enveloped the old man and Shangguan Ji. The old man was in a comparatively better state when suppressed by Yang Ye’s Sword Intent, but Shangguan Ji immediately crashed from the sky and fell weakly on the ground.

Pei Hu and Pei Jun were stunned when they witnessed this scene because the terrifying aura Yang Ye emanated wasn’t like the aura of a Spirit Realm profounder at all! It was slightly like an Exalt Realm expert instead!

The old man’s expression changed, and then he suddenly seemed to have thought of something, causing terror to instantly appear in his eyes. He pointed a finger at Yang Ye and cried out involuntarily. “Slaughter Sword Intent! A Natural Treasure! You’re Yang Ye....”

Yang Ye!

Hearing these two words caused Pei Hu’s mouth to instantly open wide. Presently, there was probably no one in the southern territory who was unaware of this name. It belonged to the present Sword Emperor who could kill Exalt Realm experts while at the Spirit Realm, and it belonged to an expert who destroyed the Flower Palace’s Graveyard of Flowers and killed countless disciples of the Flower Palace yet was able to leave safely.... Every single one of these deeds was simply earth shattering!

He’s my son-in-law’s big brother? Pei Hu’s blood boiled when he thought up to here!

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath and just swiftly slashed Void Flash through the sky before the tip of a sword suddenly appeared at the center of the old man’s brows. The old man was horrified, and his figure suddenly shook before he vanished on the spot.

“Young Master Yang, wait. My Shangguan Clan was at faulty in this matter. I apologize. I apologize on behalf of the Shangguan Clan!” The old man who appeared 300m away from Yang Ye waved his hands again and spoke hastily.

In the past, he wasn’t really believing of the rumors that said Yang Ye could surmount his realm of cultivation to kill Exalt Realm experts. After all, the gap between these two realms was too huge. However, he believed it now. If his reaction wasn’t quick just now, then Yang Ye’s attack would have probably been able to take his life. After all, 8th level Slaughter Sword Intent combined with a Dao Artifact was truly too terrifying!

Of course, he was even more afraid of the backing Yang Ye possessed. After all, it was the Founding Emperor, the Beast Emperor, and a mysterious Monarch Realm expert! Even the Flower Palace had almost been annihilated because it had offended Yang Ye. He was clearly aware that his Shangguan Clan was inferior to the Flower Palace, so how could he dare to make such a terrifying enemy for the Shangguan Clan?

Yang Ye stopped on the spot when he heard this, and then he said, “Apologize? You don’t seem to be sincere!”

The old man’s expression changed a little when he heard Yang Ye, and then he hesitated for a moment before a wisp of ruthlessness flashed in his eyes. After that, he suddenly slapped his palm down towards Shangguan Ji who was lying weakly on the ground. The space where the latter was trembled violently, and then a shrill cry resounded from Shangguan Ji before his figure exploded into a rain of blood that covered the sky.

After he did that, the old man gazed at Yang Ye and said, “I guarantee in the name of the Shangguan Clan that the Shangguan Clan will absolutely not make a move against the Pei Estate, and my Shangguan Clan will even compensate the Pei Clan’s losses in relation to the incident today. Moreover, if anyone in the Imperial Capital dares to act against Pei Estate, then it’s equivalent to going against my Shangguan Clan! Young Master Yang, may I know what you think about the sincerity I’ve shown?”

Yang Ye’s reputation preceded him. Yang Ye’s bloodthirsty and cruel character was something he’d heard about a long time ago. He knew that if he didn’t do his best to give in and satisfy this demon standing before him, then it was very likely for this demon to attack again. Perhaps this demon would even attack his Shangguan Clan. At that time, the Shangguan Clan would probably be in a bad situation.

After all, Yang Ye had the backing of the Founding Emperor and Beast Emperor!

Yang Ye put away Void Flash and said, “I hope you’ll do as you say. If anything were to happen to the Pei family in the future, then I’ll definitely pay a visit to your Shangguan Clan!”

The old man forced out a smile and said, “Don’t worry, Young Master Yang, I’ll keep my word.” As soon as he finished speaking, the old man’s figure flashed and vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye withdrew the Ninth Hell Swordwings and returned to the ground, and then Pei Hu smiled with embarrassment and said, “Err... are you really the Sword Emperor, Yang Ye?”

Yang Ye smiled helplessly and said, “I had no choice but to use a false name earlier. I hope you don’t mind, Senior!”

“I don’t, I don’t!” Pei Hu hurriedly waved his hand. What a joke! He didn’t even have the time to feel happy, so how could he mind? He’d heard everything that old man from the Shangguan Clan said just now. Will anyone dare to bully my Pei Estate in the future?

Yang Ye nodded, and then he walked over to Ye Yun before he flicked with his finger. A spatial ring flew over to Ye Yun before he said, “There are some energy stones in there. Take it as my wedding gift to the two of you. Right, you don’t have to head to the Ancient Battlefield with me this time. Just stay at the Imperial Capital and start your family.”

Ye Yun’s expression changed, and he hurriedly said, “Big Brother, I’m fine. I’ll rush immediately to the Ancient Battlefield once I’ve married Pei Jun, and then....”

Yang Ye waved his hand and said, “I know what you mean, I don’t mean anything else. Little Yun, I know that you want to take revenge. I know that you want to follow me to repay me while taking revenge on your enemies. But there’s no need for that. There really is no need for that. You have to realize that you’re not alone anymore. You have a wife, and you must be responsible for her. Understand? As for you revenge. You don’t have to worry. The other brothers and I will help accomplish it.”

Ye Yun shook his head and said, “Big Brother, how could I possibly leave you at a time like this?”

Yang Ye smiled and said, “If you really want to help me, then get married and settle down properly. After that, work hard on improving your cultivation. After all, my current enemies are all Exalt Realm experts and Monarch Realm experts. Besides that, cherish your loved ones well. Don’t lose someone that loves you right now because of the past. Understand?”

“I’ll go look for you once I attain the Exalt Realm!” Ye Yun gazed at Yang Ye as he spoke firmly.

Yang Ye smiled and said, “We’ll talk about it when the time comes!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye didn’t stay here any longer. His figure flashed and rose into the sky on his sword.

Pei Jun walked over to Ye Yun’s side, and she gazed at the flowing ray of light in the horizon as she said, “The rumors say that Big Brother is a bloodthirsty god of death who killed without batting an eyelid. However, I think Big Brother is a very good person. Looks like the rumors can’t be trusted.”

Ye Yun chuckled and said, “The rumors are true. Big Brother really is such a person, but it’s only towards his enemies. He’s really extremely bloodthirsty and kills without batting an eyelid when facing his enemies. I personally watched as he killed thousands of disciples from the Flower Palace, and he didn’t even frown at the time. However, he’s really nice and loyal to his own, and I’m very lucky to be someone by his side.”

“I think he’s a good person as well!” Pei Hu nodded from the side. Was Yang Ye a good person? Of course he was. At the very least, he was one in Pei Hu’s opinion. After all, Yang Ye had helped his Pei Estate, and it was also Yang Ye that provided him the ability to swagger through the Imperial Capital in the future. So, such a person was naturally a good person!

......

After he left the Pei Estate, Yang Ye arrived at the Immortal Indulgence Pavilion. He naturally had to go meet Qin Xiyue.

After he pushed open its doors and had just walked in, a figure flashed over before Yang Ye felt someone holding onto him while his lips were covered by a pair of soft flesh.

It was naturally Qin Xiyue.

“You Bastard! You didn’t even come to see me after you returned to the southern territory for so long! Have you forgotten me so quickly after getting someone new!? Dammit! To think that I was fucking saving my purity for you here in the Imperial Capital! Don’t you feel like you’ve let me down? Just you wait! I’ll squeeze you dry today!” Qin Xiyue tore Yang Ye’s clothes off in a frenzy while she said this, and her behavior stunned Yang Ye on the spot.

In next to no time, Yang Ye was fully stripped.

Muffled groans resounded as peach blossoms studded the ground. It was an extremely beautiful sight.
