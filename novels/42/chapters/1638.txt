Chapter 1639 - Playing Tricks!

Translator: InVader

The black shadow was hidden in the corner like a part of the shadow there, and it was impossible to see its appearance.

The beautiful woman bowed slightly to the black shadow and said, “Don’t worry. I know how far to go.”

The black shadow fell silent for an instant and said, “He’s proud and unyielding. It’s impossible to make him willingly be a puppet.”

The beautiful woman nodded, “Then why don’t we kill him now?”

The black shadow shook its head, “No. Since he can’t be a puppet, we’ll just change the plan. All of you can’t kill the other young masters, and neither can I. However, he can kill them openly.”

The beautiful woman hesitated for a moment and said, “I understand your intentions. However, regardless of whether it's his strength or natural talent, they’re both not bad. If he’s allowed to grow, I’m afraid…”

“It’s fine!” The black shadow continued, “If it’s in terms of natural talent and potential, he’s nothing to me. All of you will support him from now on and allow him to do as he pleases. Understand?”

“Yes!” All three of them quickly nodded.

Meanwhile, the black shadow asked, “Yang Xuan, are you sure that your brother’s old treasure is in his possession?”

Yang Xuan nodded, “It should be. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to grow to such an extent while at such a low level world.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “Does Master want it?”

“I’m slightly curious!” The black shadow continued, “However, it isn’t necessary to take it from him right now. Leave it with him for now.”

The black shadow pondered deeply for a moment before continuing, “Is your brother dead or alive?”

Yang Xuan shook her head, “I don’t know.”

“What a pity!” The black shadow continued, “Throughout the history of our Yang Clan, only the ancestor and your brother were extraordinary. The rest and especially the current young masters… Hmph! A bunch of trash! Those stubborn old fellows in the Council of Elders are too pedantic too. The day will come when I send all of them to hell!”

Yang Xuan and the others lowered their heads and didn’t dare to say anything.

Meanwhile, the black shadow added, “He’s still quite weak. Be careful. Don’t let him get killed. Especially from Yang Kong’s side of the clan. They will definitely not let the matter rest. I heard that Yang Kong’s father, Yang Xu, has rushed back from outside our system. So, don’t let him leave during this time.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the black shadow shook and vanished on the spot.

Once the black shadow vanished, the beautiful woman went over to Yang Ye. She waved her hand and a ray of pink light flashed. Yang Ye’s body shuddered, and then his gaze gradually cleared up.

A short while passed before Yang Ye shook his head, and then he glanced at them, “What happened?”

The beautiful woman gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before she said, “Nothing. I was just testing your mental state. It’s still quite lacking. Remember to temper it more.” She moved aside once she finished speaking.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man said, “I’m Gu Xiu, and she’s Qian Hu. We used to be your father’s subordinates. Now that you’re back to fight for the position of successor, we’ll help you with that.”

Yang Ye quickly cupped his fist, “Thank you.”

Gu Xiu nodded, “We’ve obtained news that Yang Kong’s father, Yang Xu, has rushed back from outside our system. He’s extremely strong and absolutely isn’t someone you can fight. Besides Yang Xu, the Discipline Hall is looking for you too. So, don’t leave this place for now. They won’t be able to openly attack you once the fight for succession begins.”

Yang Ye replied, “Understood. I won't cause any trouble during this time. However, I need the location of a person.”

Gu Xiu asked, “Yang Yan?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Exactly.”

Gu Xiu fell silent for a short while and replied, “You aren’t able to kill him right now.”

Yang Ye asked, “Is he very strong?”

Gu Xiu shook his head slightly, “If it’s in terms of strength, he’s probably inferior to you. However, because you’ve killed Yang Danqing, the Discipline Hall has started to focus its attention on protecting the young masters. With the experts of the Discipline Hall there to protect him, it’ll be very difficult for you to kill him. Moreover, Yang Yan isn’t weak either. Coupled with the fact that his grandfather is back, it’s utterly impossible for you to kill him right now. Understand?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he asked, “Why isn’t the Discipline Hall protecting me too?”

Gu Xiu’s eyelids twitched, “You should be happy if they don’t look for trouble with you.”

Yang Ye was speechless.

Meanwhile, Gu Xiu added, “Once the fight for succession begins, we won’t be able to help you. At that time, you’ll have to rely on yourself. So, seize this opportunity to work hard on growing stronger.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’m sure you’re all aware that I’ve been living far away since I was young. Regardless of whether it was techniques or treasures, everything in that world was quite ordinary, but those young masters of the Yang Clan definitely possess the best techniques and treasures. So, you know…”

Gu Xiu shook his head, “We don’t have sword techniques. As for treasures, I don’t have any good swords too…”

Yang Ye hurriedly said, “Other things are alright too!”

Gu Xiu was stunned speechless.

Yang Xuan and the beautiful woman had strange expressions on their faces. Because they felt that Yang Ye’s skin was a little too thick.

Gu Xiu hesitated for a moment, and then he flipped his palm. A black shoe appeared before Yang Ye, “Flash Boots. They give you the ability to instantly move 3km. The instant here is a tenth of a breath of time. I relied on these boots to avoid your attack earlier.”

The beautiful woman glanced at Gu Xiu and seemed to want to say something, but she hesitated for a moment and didn’t say anything in the end.

Yang Ye’s eyes lit up when he heard this. What did he need the most right now? Speed! If he had these boots and coupled with the speed he had, he could practically instantly kill a Zenith Realm expert before that Zenith Realm expert had the chance to react!

Suddenly, Gu Xiu said, “However, it can only be used once a day.”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned. He asked, “Why?”

Gu Xiu said, “These boots exhaust a huge amount of profound energy. Even my profound energy isn’t sufficient for a single usage. So, I usually store profound energy within it so that I can use it at the critical moment.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand. Right, what rank is it at?”

Gu Xiu replied, “The Zenith Rank! Treasures above those that surpass the normal ranks of quality are known as Zenith Rank treasures. It means they’ve reached the zenith, just like Zenith Realm experts. As for the difference between Rebirth Realm and Zenith Realm experts, Zenith Realm experts have reached their own limits in all aspects. One is said to be at the zenith upon arriving at one’s limit. It’s the same for treasures and techniques. Besides that, if the Laws of Darkness you just used is treated as a technique, then it’ll be at the Zenith Rank too. Because your Laws of Darkness has arrived at the zenith of your own potential!”

Zenith! Yang Ye nodded slightly and said, “Even intents are said to be at the Zenith Rank upon reaching their limits?”

Gu Xiu nodded, “If your sword intent and slaughter intent rise a level higher, they’ll be at the Zenith Rank. However, it’s quite difficult to accomplish that. Anyway, it’s very rare for someone to attain the Zenith Rank in a type of intent!”

Yang Ye asked, “What’s above the Zenith Rank?”

Gu Xiu fell silent for a long time, and then he said, “You’ll find out in the future.”

Yang Ye glanced at Gu Xiu and nodded. After that, he gazed at Yang Xuan, “Can I have a private cultivation room?”

Yang Xuan nodded, “Come with me!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and left.

Yang Ye cupped his fist to Gu Xiu and Qian Hu, “Farewell.”

After Yang Ye and Yang Xuan left, the beautiful woman suddenly said, “Wow! If I’m not wrong, that’s the only Zenith Rank treasure you have, right?”

Gu Xiu spoke indifferently, “If you want a horse to run, you must feed it grass. Right? Moreover, we should have a failsafe just in case, right?”

She was visibly surprised, “You did something to those boots?”

Gu Xiu spoke indifferently, “What do you think?”

She glanced at him, “You seem so reticent, but you’re actually quite sneaky!”

Gu Xiu glanced at her, “You too!”

…

In an underground cultivation room.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye’s gaze was icy cold, and the intent to kill flickered within his eyes.

He’d heard everything they said, of course. That beautiful woman’s technique was powerful indeed, but she’d far underestimated him. He didn’t just possess the Enlightened Sword Heart, he had Qiong Qi, the Divine Yin Flame, and the Primordial Pagoda within him!

So, how could she possibly affect his consciousness?

He knew Yang Xuan didn’t have good intentions when she made him return to the Yang Clan. Sure enough, she was using him. Moreover, she was planning to take the Primordial Pagoda from him as well. Fortunately, both Yang Xuan and the mysterious figure didn’t know that the treasure within him was the Primordial Pagoda, and they just knew he had a treasure. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

If they knew that it was the Primordial Pagoda, or it should be said that if they knew how heaven defying the Primordial Pagoda was, then he would have been in great danger just now. Because that mysterious figure felt extraordinarily dangerous to him!

“Trying to use me?” A cold smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “Dream on!”

He looked down at the boots in his grasp, fell silent for an instant, and then laughed coldly, “You’re trying to play tricks with me? Let’s see who tricks who.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he issued a command in his heart, and the boots instantly appeared on his feet.

The profound energy within him surged madly into the boots. Once all of his profound energy had surged into it, he issued another command in his heart. A moment later, Yang Ye’s figure vanished on the spot.

In an instant, over 10,000 images of Yang Ye had appeared in the surroundings. Besides Yang Ye’s actual body, the rest were afterimages, of course. However, they seemed real.

It was because he was exceedingly swift!
