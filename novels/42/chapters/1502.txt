Chapter 1503 - What Will You Do? Bite Me?

Translator: InVader

After Yang Ye’s figure vanished, Nangong Qin was stunned on the spot. Has he gone mad?

Those fellows from the large world aren’t ordinary at all! Moreover, four star stellar regions have joined forces with them. But he actually says he wants to attain Returnal Rank slaughter intent?!

What is he planning?

Nangong Qin was stunned for a while before she slowly clenched her fist, and then she gazed at the old man, “Elder Hua, summon all our Deities and come with me!”

Elder Hua hesitated for a moment and said, “Eldest Young Miss, Yang Ye has no chance! He can act like a madman, but we can’t go mad with him. After all, the slightest mistake might cause our merchant group to suffer eternal damnation!”

Nangong Qin spoke abruptly, “What do you think about his intelligence?”

The old man was slightly stunned. Obviously, he hadn’t expected her to ask this question. He hesitated for a moment and replied, “He seems to be more rash than wise, but he’s actually meticulous. He…” He seemed to have thought of something at this point, and a wisp of surprise flashed through his eyes, “You’re saying that he dares to do that because he’s confident?”

Nangong Qin nodded slightly, “He isn’t a rash fellow. Since he dares to face them on his own, he’s definitely confident. Of course, even if he isn’t confident, we still have to help him. If we can enjoy success with him, then we naturally have to go through difficulties with him as well!”

Elder Hua spoke solemnly, “Eldest Young Miss, you plan to tie us together with him!”

She spoke softly, “Our Azure Cloud Merchant Group has been tied to him for a long time!”

The old man shook his head and laughed bitterly. Yang Ye had potential, huge potential. If Yang Ye didn’t die, his future would be limitless. However, Yang Ye was absolutely amazing at causing trouble. So, it was extremely dangerous to follow Yang Ye. However, the old man knew that their merchant group didn’t have a way out anymore.

Because Azure Cloud Merchant Group’s relationship with Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region was no secret. They had no choice but to choose Yang Ye!

The old man restrained his thoughts, turned around, and left. In just a few breaths of time, he appeared within the hall again, and there were five old men behind him!

“Let’s go!” As soon as Nangong Qin gave the order, all of them vanished from the hall.

…

At this moment, practically everyone in the lower dimensions knew Yang Ye. In the past, he was just comparatively famous in the Eastern Territory. Yet now, almost the entire lower dimensions were aware of his name. Because he was the first person who made countless geniuses come down from the large world to kill him. Everyone was curious about what Yang Ye had done to actually make them come for his head!

Even though Yang Ye had the Stellar Sword Diagram, he was only a threat to four star stellar regions. After all, Yang Ye’s cultivation was too low. So, many powers hadn’t hesitated to choose those geniuses who had come down from the large world. Moreover, they used all their ability to help those geniuses find Yang Ye. If Yang Ye hadn’t gone into the Ominous Territory, he would have been found by now!

In the beginning, they just searched all around for Yang Ye, but Yang Ye never showed himself. It was like Yang Ye had evaporated into thin air. This made those geniuses from the large world start to go to extremes!

An example of it was acting against Clouds of Heaven Continent!

They intended to use Clouds of Heaven Continent to make Yang Ye show himself!

…

Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region.

Before this, Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region had practically become a forbidden area in the Eastern Territory due to Yang Ye’s reputation. Because all powers had strictly prohibited their members from offending Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region. But from some moment in time, the members of countless powers had appeared around Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region. There were experts from the Eastern Territory and other territories.

Presently, as far as everyone was concerned, Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region would definitely cease to exist.

Yang Ye was the reason that Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region was strong. So long as he was alive, even four star stellar regions would dare not rashly offend Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region. Yet now, so many geniuses had come down from the large world to look for Yang Ye, and many four star stellar regions had joined them. So, could Yang Ye survive them? As far as everyone was concerned, Yang Ye was no different than a dead man walking!

Clouds of Heaven City.

Because many powers had come to their stellar region, the Wargod Formation around the city had been activated, and everyone within the city was ready for battle!

In the air above the city, Zhuang Weiran stood there with her hands behind her back, and Peacekeeper was by her side. Ye Liuyun and the other forces of the city were standing behind her.

A young man was standing not too far ahead of her. The young man seemed to be just a little over 20 years old, and there was a very long ponytail behind his head. It practically reached his heels.

The young man seemed quite evil based on his outward appearance.

On his left was a young man in a violet robe and a woman in a dark blue dress.

The young man in a violet robe spoke abruptly, “Brother Ma, she’s Zhuang Weiran, and she’s called the Wargod. Even though she’s just a Semi-Deity, her strength far surpasses Deities. Brother Ma, you absolutely must not underestimate her!”

“Wargod?” The young man with a ponytail gazed at Zhuang Weiran, and then an evil smile curled up on the corners of his mouth, “I presume her strength is definitely not bad. I just wonder if she can be considered a ‘Wargod’ in bed. Hahaha…”

The violet robed young man smiled, “Brother Ma, if you want to know, you can try for yourself once we capture her, right?”

“I have to try. After all, she’s truly beautiful!” The young man revealed an evil smile while his gaze ceaselessly roamed Zhuang Weiran’s body while displaying undisguised greed and lust.

Suddenly, Zhuang Weiran attacked. She took Peacekeeper in her hand and instantly arrived before the young man, and then she stabbed it forward.

The young man revealed a cold smile as he slammed his fist forward.

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and then both of them moved away from each other. Zhuang Weiran moved around 100m back while the young man moved around 100m back as well.

The young man glanced at his hand. At this moment, it had cracked open, and it caused a ferocious expression to cover his face. He looked up at Zhuang Weiran and spoke fiercely, “Woman! I’ll fuck you to death!”

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “What did you say?”

Ye Liuyun and the others were stunned when they heard this voice, and then they were overjoyed. A wisp of happiness had even flashed through Zhuang Weiran’s eyes. At the same time, she heaved a sigh of relief.

Because that voice belonged to Yang Ye!

Yang Ye had gone to the Ominous Territory for almost two months, and it was like he’d vanished. It would be an absolute lie if she said that she wasn’t worried about him. After all, the Ominous Territory was extremely dangerous.

Fortunately, Yang Ye was back now!

He’d returned safely!

Yang Ye appeared before Zhuang Weiran. Everyone heaved sighs of relief when they saw him. The pressure Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region had suffered throughout this period was huge. Especially Zhuang Weiran and the others. Because they didn’t just have to face the geniuses from the large world, they had to face some four star stellar regions from the lower dimensions!

Most importantly, they hadn’t heard anything from Yang Ye, and it was like he’d vanished. That was the source of the greatest amount of pressure they experienced!

Luckily, Yang Ye had returned!

Zhuang Weiran took Yang Ye’s hand and spoke softly, “You got the Spring of Life?”

Yang Ye shook his head, causing her face to instantly stiffen. Meanwhile, he added, “But I’m a Semi-Deity now.”

Zhuang Weiran’s face eased up. She was about to speak when Yang Ye smiled, “Let me deal with the matters here first.”

She nodded slightly, “Be careful!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he looked at the young man with a ponytail. The young man was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot, and he was in front of the young man when his figure appeared once more. After that, he slammed his fist at the young man.

Yang Ye was extremely swift, so his fist was in front of the young man’s head when the young man had finally reacted. The young man was shocked and caught off guard, so he could only slam his fist forward as well.

Bang!

The young man’s right arm exploded apart, and his figure was blasted flying. Meanwhile, the violet robed young man and woman recovered from their shock as well, and they were about to attack. However, Yang Ye suddenly stopped chasing after the young man with a ponytail, and he gazed at them before slamming his fist at them!

Boom!

Everyone watched with shock as the violet robed young man and the woman in a dark blue dress were blasted around 10km away!

Everyone here was stunned.

Yang Ye is actually so terrifying?

Even Zhuang Weiran was slightly stunned. Obviously, she hadn’t expected him to have become so strong.

Yang Ye paid no further attention to the violet robed young man and the woman. His figure shot over to the young man with a ponytail, and then he slammed his fist forward again.

Even though he’d lost an arm to Yang Ye, the young man didn’t take long to calm down. So, he was mentally prepared when Yang Ye arrived before him again. As soon as Yang Ye swung that punch at him, a golden shield appeared in front of him. The golden shield was covered in sharp spikes, but Yang Ye’s fist didn’t stop at all!

Boom! FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The golden shield exploded into pieces while the young man’s figure was blasted away while repeatedly spitting out mouthfuls of blood.

It was being suppressed!

Utterly suppressed!

No one had expected a genius from the large world to be utterly suppressed by Yang Ye!

Yang Ye didn’t stop. He was about to attack again when the violet robed young man suddenly howled with fury, “Stop him!”

As soon as he gave the order, six old men suddenly appeared in the sky!

Deities!

Six old men had instantly surrounded Yang Ye, and then they released their auras towards Yang Ye. Meanwhile, the young man with a ponytail spoke fiercely, “Don’t kill him. I want living to be worse than death for him!”

Yang Ye ignored the young man and gazed at the violet robed young man instead, “Which stellar region are you from?”

The violet robed young man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Southern Territory’s Nether Emperor Stellar Region! A four star stellar region!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly and said, “Southern Territory’s Nether Emperor Stellar Region. I’ll remember that.”

“You’ll remember it? What a joke!” A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of the violet robed young man’s mouth, “What are you going to do about it? Bite me? How laughable!”

He seemed like he had nothing to fear!
