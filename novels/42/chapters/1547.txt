Chapter 1548 - We’ve Known Each Other For A Long Time!

Translator: InVader

Arrogant!

Extremely arrogant!

That was what all the demon beasts thought right now.

After all, demon beasts had to return to their true form to bring forth their true strength. As for while they were in human form, it was very difficult for them to bring forth their true strength.

Yet now, Yang Ye said that he didn’t have to return to his true form to defeat Xue You. If he really defeated Xue You, then his strength would really be quite terrifying.

Xue You’s expression instantly became extremely savage when he heard Yang Ye.

He didn’t waste his breath and just roared with fury before transforming into a ray of red light that shot in Yang Ye’s direction.

The space around him instantly started to ripple violently!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He clenched his right fist, and then he swung it forward!

The Brink Laws!

His physical strength had been brought to the brink!

As soon as his fist shot forward, Gu Mo suddenly opened his eyes. Gu Mo wasn’t the only one, Ku Moye, Yan Lingxue, and Ku Yuan’s expressions changed as well.

Obviously, they’d noticed Yang Ye’s Brink Laws!

Bang! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Xue You was blasted away and slammed against the barrier of light.

Bang!

The entire barrier of light shook violently and seemed to be on the verge of shattering. As for Xue You himself, he crashed down to the ground. However, it didn’t take long for him to stand up again. But as soon as he did, Yang Ye appeared in front of him and slammed his fist down towards Xue You.

Bang!

Xue You was slammed against the barrier of light once more. However, Yang Ye still didn’t stop. He stomped his right foot against the ground and shot forward. Yang Ye instantly arrived before Xue You, and then he swung another punch at Xue You.

Just like that, Xue You was pushed to a corner and constantly beaten, and he didn’t have the strength to fight back at all!

At this moment, all the demon beasts here had solemn expressions on their faces. Especially Ku Moye and the others in the top four. At this moment, they knew that they’d underestimated Yang Ye, they’d severely underestimated him!

As for Gu Mo who was watching from the shadows, his face had become solemn. He knew Yang Ye was a human, and he knew Yang Ye’s strength wasn’t bad. But he hadn’t expected Yang Ye’s strength to be that terrifying. Xue You’s strength was really good, and it could be considered as being outstanding in the demon race. However, he didn’t even have the strength to fight back against Yang Ye!

Most importantly, Yang Ye was only using his physical strength. But as a human, Yang Ye definitely had other abilities.

That was the true reason why Gu Mo had such a solemn expression on his face!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had stopped because Xue You was on the verge of death.

The outcome had been decided.

Yang Ye turned around and walked away. Meanwhile, Gu Mo appeared on the ring. He glanced at Yang Ye and said, “You’re really not bad!”

Yang Ye smiled and replied humbly, “I’m just alright!”

Gu Mo nodded slightly and announced, “The Goat Clan’s Xiao Yang is victorious!”

Man Shi and the others immediately started cheering when they heard Gu Mo. They weren’t the only ones; many other demon beasts were cheering as well.

Just like humans, everyone loved the unexpected. Even though Yang Ye’s previous performance was dazzling, it was only slightly dazzling. Yet now, Yang Ye wasn’t just slightly dazzling, he was extremely dazzling. It could be said that his name would spread throughout the demon race.

Reputation!

One of the reasons that many geniuses of the demon race participated in the Meeting of the Clans was to gain reputation!

Who didn’t want to be renowned throughout the world?

After Yang Ye’s victory, the competition came to a temporary end. Because the top four had experienced a few rounds of battles, and they needed time to rest. They could only bring forth their true strength once they had sufficient rest, and only then would they be able to give the spectators a very spectacular show.

The final battles would be held in three days.

Yang Ye bade farewell to Man Shi and the others, and then he returned to his cultivation room.

Cultivate!

He went back to cultivate as he always did.

He hadn’t fully grasped the rebound of energy that Little Sky had taught him. Now, he intended to grasp it completely. Only by fully grasping it could the Elemental Breaker undergo a qualitative transformation. At that time, the Elemental Breaker’s strength may not be weaker than the Rebirth Sword. Of course, it definitely couldn’t compare to the Sword of Rebirth.

The Rebirth Sword could only pose a small threat to Rebirth Realm experts, but the Sword of Rebirth could kill Rebirth Realm experts!

Unfortunately, he only had Quasi Returnal Rank sword intent now, so he couldn’t cultivate the Sword of Rebirth!

Suddenly, Yang Ye who was about to cultivate in the Primordial Pagoda frowned, and then he left the Primordial Pagoda and returned to his room.

At this moment, the door to his room was being knocked! There was someone outside!

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the restrictions on the door were removed. It didn’t take long for a young man to walk in. Yang Ye had met this young man in the past, it was the Devil Ape Clan’s Ku Yuan.

Yang Ye asked, “You need something?”

Ku Yuan nodded, “I watched you fight. That last attack you executed… The energy you released underwent a change. How did you do that?”

Yang Ye naturally knew that Ku Yuan was speaking about the Brink Laws. He smiled. Needless to say, the demon beasts of the demon race were really straightforward! Ku Yuan liked that move and wanted to learn it, so he’d just asked about it.

Yang Ye was about to speak when Ku Yuan added, “We can carry out an exchange!”

“Exchange?” Yang Ye smiled and shook his head, “It’s very, very difficult for you to learn that move!”

He wasn’t lying. Could he just learn the Brink Laws? It required comprehension. Of course, Yang Ye was comparatively special because he had the Sword Domain, so he could replicate it and use such a method to comprehend it.

But Ku Yuan couldn’t.

So, if Ku Yuan wanted to learn it, it would be extraordinarily difficult. Of course, most importantly, there was no relationship between them, so how could he possibly teach Ku Yuan?

Ku Yuan clearly didn’t want to give up, and he said, “Feel free to tell me if you have conditions. I’m willing to complete them if they’re within my ability!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “To be honest, you really don’t have anything that I need or want!” He was extremely picky now. Regardless of whether it was techniques or treasures, he really didn’t want or need most of them.

Ku Yuan fell silent for a while, and then he said, “Then can we spar?”

Yang Ye thought for a while and said, “Alright!” He wanted to train with someone as well.

Ku Yuan nodded, and then he vanished on the spot. He was in front of Yang Ye when his figure appeared again, and he slammed his fist forward.

Just a punch!

A very simple and direct attack!

Yang Ye didn’t utilize profound energy, and he similarly slammed a punch at Ku Yuan!

Bang!

As soon as they fists collided, they split apart again. Yang Ye and Ku Yuan moved backwards repeatedly. Ku Yuan had moved around 30m back while Yang Ye had moved around 45m back!

Yang Ye was at a disadvantage!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He was quite surprised by Ku Yuan’s strength. Even though he hadn’t utilized the Brink Laws, he hadn’t held back just now. However, he’d still lost in the collision with Ku Yuan after using his full strength. Ku Yuan wasn’t just a little bit stronger than Xue You!

Meanwhile, Ku Yuan said, “Use that strongest move of yours!”

Yang Ye naturally understood that Ku Yuan wanted him to use the Brink Laws.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded. A moment later, he appeared in front of Ku Yuan, and then he slammed his fist at Ku Yuan!

The Brink Laws!

Strength at the brink!

At the moment Yang Ye’s fist shot forward, the space around it started to warp from the energy in his fist. Fortunately, he was in the large world, and the space here was exceptionally strong. If he was in the lower dimensions, then his punch would have been sufficient to shatter the space around him!

Ku Yuan had a solemn expression on his face when he saw Yang Ye’s attack. He slowly clenched his right fist while a layer of thick scales suddenly covered it. A moment later, he swung his first at Yang Ye’s fist.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded. Yang Ye and Ku Yuan moved backwards simultaneously. At the same time, a wave of energy surged out in all directions from the point of collision. The space around them instantly started rippling violently!

A long time passed before everything gradually calmed down.

Ku Yuan spoke in a low voice, “You’re very strong!”

Yang Ye replied, “You’re very strong as well.”

Ku Yuan nodded slightly, “See you in three days!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and left.

Yang Ye remained silent on the spot. Ku Yuan’s physical strength and defense had completely exceeded his expectations. Because his fist that carried the Brink Laws hadn’t been able to gain the upper hand against Ku Yuan’s punch. Moreover, he could sense that Ku Yuan hadn’t used his full strength. Ku Yuan had held back. If Ku Yuan had used his full strength, then Yang Ye might have lost the collision!

A long time passed before Yang Ye took a deep breath. If it was amongst the younger generation of the human race, then there were definitely very few who could match his physical strength. But if it was amongst the younger generation of the demon race, then there were definitely many who weren’t weaker than him. After all, they had an innate advantage when compared to humans!

Yang Ye shook his head, restrained his thoughts, and intended to enter the Primordial Pagoda to cultivate. However, a figure suddenly walked into his room.

A Rebirth Realm expert!

Yang Ye gazed at the person and said, “Who are you?”

That person grinned and replied, “Stop joking! You actually don’t recognize me? We’ve known each other for a long time!”

We’ve known each other for a long time? Yang Ye frowned. He sized up the person, and then he shook his head again, “I’m sure I don’t know you!”

He only knew a single person in the demon race for a very long time, and it was Mo Xiaoleng. But the person before him wasn’t Mo Xiaoleng!

That person walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction and said, “I’ll give you one last chance! Give it more thought!”

Yang Ye slowly clenched his right fist when he heard this.
