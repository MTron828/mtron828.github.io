Chapter 2435 – Snowy! Treasures!

Huang Ying gazed at the corpse and chuckled while shaking his head, “Brother Yang, you’re really… bold and unrestrained.”

Actually, he wanted to say that Yang Ye was really great at causing trouble!

If they didn’t kill the old man, it was equivalent to not shedding all pretenses with the Hell Sect, and everything could be discussed. Yet now, Yang Ye had killed the old man, and that was no different than becoming enemies with them.

It was nice to kill the old man, but they would have a lot of trouble waiting for them now!

However, he did envy Yang Ye a little.

Huang Ying envied how Yang Ye could do as he pleased, and envied how Yang Ye could draw his sword and kill just because he wasn’t happy!

Yang Ye did as he wanted!

Sword cultivators had always been the most unrestrained and free!Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Huang Ying restrained his thoughts and smiled, “Let’s go take a look at that treasure.”

He sped up as he spoke.

Yang Ye and A’Leng followed behind him.

A short while later, A’Leng suddenly asked, “Brother Yang, do you really plan to protect that Sprite Progenitor?”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She sighed softly and just silently sped up.

Yang Ye fell silent on the spot.

The Sprite Progenitor!

He refused to let anyone harm Snowy!

Yang Ye sped up too.

It didn’t take long for them to arrive at the center of the cemetery, and it was where the Death Energy and Yin Energy were the thickest.

Huang Ying’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Show yourself!”

Suddenly, four black robed figures appeared around them. Four World Realm experts! Moreover, their auras were thick. They were no ordinary Four World Realm experts!

Meanwhile, a black circle of light appeared below their feet, and then space started to tremble around them. After that, countless strands of Death Energy and Yin Energy converged toward them.

A middle aged man appeared in the sky not too far ahead of them. He wore a black robe, had a head full of white hair, and an indifferent expression.

Huang Ying smiled, “I presume you’re the master of the Hell Sect, You Tian.”

The middle aged man nodded, “Indeed!”

Huang Ying asked, “Do you want something?”

You Tian shot a glance into the distant sky, “Ninth Prince, can you give us some face?”

Huang Ying chuckled, “No!”

You Tian moved his gaze back to Huang Ying, and he gazed at the latter for a long time before he said, “My Hell Sect will stop interfering in the desolate race’s fight to become the Crown Prince.”

Huang Ying grinned, “It’s too late!”

You Tian closed his eyes slowly.

Suddenly, A’Leng spoke, “Sect Master You Tian, you’re a peak Four World Realm expert. None of us are confident in being able to defeat you in a one on one battle, but allow me to be honest, if we join forces, then can anyone below the Five World Realm escape us?”

She shook her head and smiled, “Of course, you have many trump cards, but don’t we? Simply speaking, if you attack us, even if Hell Sect still remains in Hell World after the battle, it will be reduced to a third rate sect.”

A third rate sect!

A'Leng wanted to say more, but Yang Ye suddenly said, “Can I say something?”

Everyone including You Tian gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and looked You Tian in the eyes, “My patience is running thin. I don’t want to waste time. 10 breaths of time, if the experts of your Hell Sect are still standing in our way by then, I’ll kill them all!”

A’Leng and Huang Ying were stunned.

You Tian and the others' faces instantly turned gloomy when they heard Yang Ye.

They felt that he was going too far!

It didn’t take long for ten breaths of time to pass!

A sword howl resounded.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy suddenly appeared above the black robed figure on Yang Ye’s right.

That expert was shocked and twisted his body swiftly. In an instant, countless rays of black light rippled out and slammed against Yang Ye’s sword energy.

However, they weren’t able to stop Yang Ye’s sword energy!

Bang!

The black light instantly exploded apart while the black robed man was blasted away. He flew over 10km away, and his body exploded apart upon stopping there.

A single attack had destroyed his body!

Yang Ye didn’t stop and stabbed with his sword.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy flashed out of Yang Ye’s sword!

You Tian was about to lend that expert a hand, but A’Leng and Huang Ying appeared in front of him, and their divine senses locked onto You Tian!

You Tian gazed at them and hesitated for a moment, and it was just this moment that allowed Yang Ye’s sword to pierce through that expert’s soul.

You Tian’s face was extremely gloomy.

He really wanted to kill Yang Ye!

That was what he felt right now because Yang Ye was really going too far.

But as far as Yang Ye was concerned, since the Hell Sect dared to target Snowy, then it deserved death!

After he killed that expert, Yang Ye didn’t stop at all. He was about to draw his sword when You Tian suddenly said, “Let’s go!”

However, Yang Ye still drew his sword.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy descended upon one of the black robed experts. That expert had been on guard, he grabbed his blood red saber with both hands and swung it.

It forcefully stopped Yang Ye’s sword energy, but the black robed expert’s pupils suddenly constricted at this moment. An instant later, he swung his saber both left and right.

Flying swords!

Two flying swords had suddenly appeared on either side of him!

Bang! Bang!

Two explosions resounded, and he was blasted away.

Yang Ye was about to attack when a powerful aura locked onto him. It was You Tian’s aura!

Yang Ye gazed at You Tian, and You Tian stared at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, do you really think my Hell Sect is afraid of you?”

Yang Ye suddenly pointed his sword at You Tian, “Do you think I’m afraid of the Hell Sect? Didn’t you want the Sprite Progenitor? Didn’t you want to kill me? I’m standing right here, and the Sprite Progenitor is with me. Bring it!”

You Tian was livid!

Fight?

He wasn’t like Yang Ye. Yang Ye was all alone and didn’t have the Hell Sect to consider, but he had to consider the Hell Sect.

Once he chose to fight, then it would be just as A’Leng had said. Even if the Hell Sect won, they would be reduced to a third rate sect. Besides Yang Ye, both Huang Ying and A’Leng were backed by a power.

So, even if they won, they wouldn’t dare to kill them.

As for Yang Ye, while Yang Ye didn’t have any backing, he was actually more fearful of Yang Ye. Because Yang Ye was an utter madman! A madman who dared to do as he pleased!

You Tian stared at Yang Ye, and a short while passed before he vanished into the distance.

The experts of the Hell Sect left as well.

They refused to fight!

You Tian didn’t fear Yang Ye, nor did the Hell Sect. But they didn’t want to get dragged down with him.

Yang Ye dared to do that, but they didn’t!

Moreover, the Ninth Prince of the Hell Sect and a mysterious woman from Eternal Kingdom were with Yang Ye!

They didn’t dare to fight them!

Yang Ye didn’t give chase. He sheathed his sword instead. Meanwhile, Huang Ying and A’Leng gazed at him.

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

Huang Ying laughed bitterly, “Brother Yang, acting like that will make you lots of enemies!”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “I’ve always had lots of enemies. However, the grass on their graves have grown really high by now.”

Huang Ying’s face froze, and a short while passed before he shook his head and smiled, “Let’s go!”

They continued forward.

Yang Ye glanced at the Death Energy and Yin Energy in the surroundings but remained silent.

Just like that, they walked for quite some time before Huang Ying suddenly stopped. There was a huge golden casket not too far ahead of them.

The casket was huge, at least 5 times larger than an ordinary casket.

Yang Ye asked, “What is that?”

Huang Ying smiled, “It was left behind by the Hell Sect’s ancestor. It’s the Hell Sect’s most mysterious treasure. Because up until now, no one has ever been able to open it. You Tian knows what our objective is, and the reason he exercised such forbearance was partially because he too would like to see if we can open the casket.”

A casket!

Yang Ye looked up. It didn’t look special if it was based on outward appearance alone.

Huang Ying suddenly asked, “Who’s going first?”

Yang Ye gazed at A’Leng and the latter grinned before walking over to the casket. She gazed at it for a long time, and then she raised both hands. In an instant, countless rays of golden profound energy converged toward the casket.

She planned to open it by force!

As soon as the golden profound energy touched the golden casket, it shook violently, but just an instant later, the golden casket calmed down. A moment of silence ensued, and then it shook.

Bang!

The golden profound energy around it was blasted apart. At the same time, a wave of powerful energy rippled out from it and pushed all three of them around 300m back!

They exchanged glances and saw some shock in each other’s eyes.

They hadn’t been able to resist that energy even with their full strength.

It was very strong!

Yang Ye gazed at the casket, and it had returned to calm once more.

Huang Ying hesitated for a moment and flashed into the air above it. However, he hadn’t even done anything when a wave of powerful energy surged out from the casket and blasted him away.

He flew over 1km away!

As soon as he stopped himself, a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth.

Huang Ying wiped it off and gazed at Yang Ye, “Brother Yang, it’s up to you. I don’t plan on trying again.”

He placed his hands behind his back once he finished speaking. His hands were mangled.

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he walked over to the casket. He gazed at it for a moment, and then he patted his chest.

Nothing happened!

Nothing at all!

Yang Ye seemed quite embarrassed. He sent his divine sense into the pagoda, and he saw Snowy snoring on the Chaotic Fruit Trees.

Strands of spirit energy were ceaselessly entering Snowy from the trees.

Yang Ye walked over to Snowy and patted her lightly on the butt, “Snowy, wake up!”

Nothing happened!

Yang Ye had quite an embarrassed expression on his face, and he patted her again. But she still didn’t respond!

Yang Ye felt quite helpless, so he said, “Snowy! Treasures!”

Treasures!

Snowy shuddered, and then she opened her eyes and scanned the surroundings incessantly!

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
