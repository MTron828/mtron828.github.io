Chapter 2097 – Something’s Wrong!

Three Sages! Out of three, two had perished and one succeeded!

While the successful Sage hadn’t attained the Progenitor Realm immediately, as far as the others were concerned, he probably wasn’t too far away from it. After all, he was laughing extremely happily. Obviously, he’d obtained tremendous benefits!

Now, the hearts of countless other Sages were seething.

It was dangerous!

But there was opportunity within the danger!

As far as the Sages were concerned, all of them just lacked a trace of comprehension. If they achieved it, they would be able to become progenitors. However, they may never achieve it in their entire lives without a fortuitous encounter.

Yet now, there was an opportunity before them, and it was naturally that tree.

So, all the Sages rushed incessantly to it.

A’Man suddenly asked, “Shall we leave?”

Yang Ye was about to say something when he was suddenly stunned, and then he gazed at her, “Give me a minute!”

He closed his eyes and immersed his consciousness into his body.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye went over to Snowy. At this moment, Tian Xiu was looking ahead with excitement. Snowy was there, and she was waving her claws about like she was dreaming.

Yang Ye asked Little Sky, “What’s going on?”

Little Sky had never left Snowy’s sky throughout this time.

Little Sky spoke softly, “It seems like she’s about to wake up!”

“She’s waking up?” Yang Ye gazed at Snowy. At this moment, Snowy’s brows twitched, and then she opened her eyes.

Bang!

In an instant, a wave of terrifying spirit energy swept out from Snowy, blasting Yang Ye and Little Sky over 3km away. Because Yang Ye had been swift and took Tian Xiu in his arms, she hadn’t been able to avoid being injured by the wave of energy.

Yang Ye looked up into the distance. Snowy was stretching, and then she greedily sucked in a breath of air. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

In an instant, the world throughout the Primordial Pagoda changed, and it seemed like something had been sucked dry!

Spirit energy!

At this moment, at least 80% of the spirit energy in the pagoda had been sucked away!

Yang Ye was absolutely shocked by this.

Suddenly, a golden pagoda appeared in front of Snowy. It bumped Snowy’s head lightly with its sharp top. Snowy embraced the pagoda, rubbed her head against it, and then grinned. Meanwhile, the Primordial Pagoda bumped Snowy again and seemed to be saying something to her.

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu suddenly shouted while being embraced between Yang Ye’s arms, “Snowy, she wants you to return the spirit energy!”

Snowy blinked, and then she looked down at the Primordial Pagoda. The latter bumped her again, and she cracked a smile before spitting. In an instant, the spirit energy in the pagoda returned to normal.

Meanwhile, the pagoda bumped Snowy’s little head again and transformed into a ray of golden light that vanished into the sky.

Once the Primordial Pagoda left, Snowy flashed over to Yang Ye and Tian Xiu. She wrapped her paws around Yang Ye’s neck and rubbed her head lightly against his chin, and then she flew over to Tian Xiu and rubbed Tian Xiu’s head gently.

Tian Xiu grabbed Snowy and kissed Snowy on the head instead, “Snowy, we can play together again!”

Yang Ye was visibly happy as he gazed at Tian Xiu who seemed extremely happy. While she’d matured slightly, she was still a child. Yang Ye believed that with Snowy there to guide her, she would definitely not become bad.

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Snowy, what can you do now?”

Snowy gazed at Yang Ye and sucked in a light breath. In an instant, the spirit energy in the surroundings vanished again. However, she seemed to have thought of something and hurriedly spat it all out again. She could take as much as she wanted in the outside world, but she had to give the Primordial Pagoda face here. No, as far as she was concerned, the Primordial Pagoda was a very good friend, and while she could use her friends’ things, she couldn’t take it all!

Yes, that was how Snowy thought.

Yang Ye asked, “What else?”

Snowy blinked, and then she withdrew an immortal crystal. After that, she rubbed her paw against it, and then it multiplied into two.

Yang Ye was speechless.

In the end, Yang Ye couldn’t figure out what had changed. However, he was certain that Snowy had undergone some sort of change. After all, just her ability to take away all the spirit energy within the Primordial Pagoda was extremely terrifying.

In short, he didn’t have to worry about spirit energy while he had the little fellow. If he needed spirit energy, he just had to take her somewhere and make her take away all the spirit energy there, and he would have spirit energy.

Yang Ye played with Snowy and Tian Xiu for a while before leaving the Primordial Pagoda.

Meanwhile, more and more had arrived at the seaside. At the same time, Sage after Sage was heading towards the tree. While many of them perished before the tree, it still couldn’t stop them.

Meanwhile, A’Man suddenly said, “What a loss!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “What do you mean?”

A’Man shook her head, “While the large universe is huge, there aren’t that many Sages. All the races together only have a few hundred Sages, and that’s the total of all the races in the large universe. Now that they’re dying in succession, there’ll be a shortage of Sages for quite some time from now!”

She turned towards the distance, “Now, the number of Sages is still declining incessantly, so it’s not a good thing for the large universe at all.”

“That may not necessarily be the case!” Yang Ye said, “Every dead Sage makes the Sage Alliance weaker! That’s a really good thing for me!”

She glanced at him, “Sigh!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Let’s head to Hidden Dragon City!”

She asked, “Why?”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “I keep having the feeling that I’m being watched while I stay here.”

She wanted to say something, but Yang Ye said, “Let’s just head back to the city for now!”

A’Man nodded lightly and didn’t say anything else.

Yang Ye was about to leave when he seemed to have thought of something, and he patted his chest. A moment later, Snowy’s little head emerged from there. Her eyes scanned the surroundings, and then she leaped up onto Yang Ye’s shoulder.

Yang Ye rubbed her head and pointed at the tree, “Snowy, is that a treasure?”

Snowy looked along the direction Yang Ye was pointing towards, and then her eyes lit up while she hurriedly nodded.

Yang Ye frowned slightly, Is it really the Bodhi Tree?

Suddenly, Snowy pulled on his ear and signaled for him to run immediately.

Yang Ye asked, “It’s dangerous?”

She kept nodding, and then she felt like it wasn’t enough. So she pointed at the tree and started waving her paws about!

Dangerous, extremely dangerous!

That was what she was telling him.

Yang Ye gazed at the tree, “I knew there was something wrong with it. Luckily, I didn’t sit down there or I may be dead!”

However, based on what Snowy told him, while it was extraordinarily dangerous, it was an extraordinarily precious treasure too! Moreover, she didn’t ask Yang Ye to go take it this time, and she wanted him to run.

Obviously, it was so dangerous that even she gave up on obtaining it.

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to take Snowy with him and leave with A’Man.

Not long after they left, a young man and old man appeared where Yang Ye and A’Man had been. They wore cloud white robes, and they emanated a scholarly aura.

The young man asked, “Was that Yang Ye?”

The old man nodded slightly, “It should be him. I didn’t expect him to be here.”

The young man asked, “Is he really the successor of that existence in the Dao Path?”

The old man replied, ‘I’m not very sure. That existence’s attitude towards him is very vague, so no one knows what he’s thinking.” The old man glanced at the young man and continued, “What? Are you that interested in him?”

The young man smiled, “He’d called the number one genius of the large universe. So, I’m naturally interested. Of course, I’m more curious than interested. I’m curious if he’s worthy of that title!”

The old man said, “The number one genius? No one can call themselves the best. However, his strength is beyond doubt. As for you, if you want to spar with him, you can. But you must remember that it isn’t necessary to become enemies with him. While our Confucianist Path’s relationship with the Dao Path isn’t that good, it isn’t that bad either. So, it isn’t necessary to look for trouble with him.”

The young man nodded slightly, “I understand. I’ll just look for an opportunity to spar with him.”

He gazed at the tree and continued, “Master, do you think that’s the Bodhi Tree?”

The old man gazed at the tree, and there was a trace of bewilderment in his eyes. In the end, he shook his head, “I’m not sure.”

The young man asked, “Master, do you plan on trying?”

The old man smiled, “Of course. However, I’m not in a rush, and I’ve always believed that attaining the Dao requires one’s own comprehension, and relying on external forces is never the right way.”

The young man smiled, “I think so too.”

He glanced at the tree and continued, “Moreover, I think that there’s something off about it.”

The old man nodded, “Indeed. I’ve already sought advice from our ancestor, and the reply I received was ‘Something’s off’.”

The young man was surprised, “Even our ancestor is paying attention to this?”

The old man replied, “Even progenitors are tempted by the Bodhi Tree!”

The young man nodded and didn’t offer anything in response.

Suddenly, he said, “Master, I’m leaving for a while!”

The old man glanced at him and smiled, “Go on.”

The young man bowed and left.

The old man smiled, “Youths…”
