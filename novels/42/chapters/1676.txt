Chapter 1677 - Where I Was Born And Raised!

Translator: InVader

“Run?” Yang Xuan shook her head, “Where can you run to?”

Yang Ye replied, “Then what do you think I should do?”

Yang Xuan fell silent.

Yang Ye said, “I’ll die if I run, and I’ll still die if I don’t. So, should I run or not?”

Yang Xuan spoke solemnly, “Don’t. You’ll have a chance to survive if you don’t.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “You didn’t come here today to discuss if I should run or not, right?”

She replied, “I’m here to warn you to be careful of three people.”

Yang Ye asked, “Which three?”

Yang Xuan replied, “The Eldest Young Master, Yang Jian. The Fourth Young Master, Yang Ru. The Ninth Young Master, Yang Xian. They’ll be your greatest enemies.”

Yang Ye asked, “Which one of them has the most support? Which one of them is the strongest?”

Yang Xuan pondered deeply for a moment and shook her head, “I’m not certain. They will only reveal their trump cards at the last possible moment. As for now, their true trump cards are hidden.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “However, according to my estimations, Yang Jian’s forces are much larger in number. Because he’s skilled in management, and his reputation is very good. So, he has many friends. Of course, his strength will definitely not be weak as well!”

Yang Jian! Yang Ye nodded slightly and said, “What about Yang Ru?”

He cared more about Yang Ru because there was enmity between them, and Yang Ru would definitely not leave him alone during the competition. So, he had to take precautions against Yang Ru.

“Yang Xian too!” Meanwhile, Yang Xuan said, “He’s quite mysterious.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Mysterious?”

Yang Xuan nodded, “He has been weak and sickly since he was born, and his speed of cultivation has been much slower than others. At that time, he wasn’t favored by the clan as well.” She paused for a moment and continued, “I asked you to be careful of him because when the number one genius of the Yang Clan, Yang Lianshuang, said something when she met him!”

Yang Ye asked, “What did she say?”

Yang Xuan pondered deeply for a moment and said, “Not bad, not bad indeed!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Yang Ye was quite stunned, “That’s all?”

Yang Xuan glanced at him, “You haven’t met her, so you don’t know how proud she is. She takes very few seriously, and it can be said that she looks down on everyone. But she has the strength to do that!”

Yang Lianshuang!

The Yang Clan’s no one genius!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. It wasn’t his first time hearing that name. He fell silent for a moment and said, “How strong is she?”

Yang Xuan replied, “I don’t know the specifics. In any case, True Realm experts are definitely unable to do anything to her. Or I should say that she may have the strength to kill True Realm experts!”

The strength to kill True Realm experts! Yang Ye was shocked. It was still difficult for him to kill a True Realm expert. Actually, it wasn’t just difficult, it was impossible for him to accomplish right now. Unless he used the Wargod’s arm, the Divine Yin Flame, or the wooden sword, his current strength was definitely insufficient to kill a True Realm expert!

Of course, based on his current strength, and especially after he comprehended the Unyielding Will. Even if he still couldn’t kill True Realm experts, fighting them wouldn’t be a problem for him.

Meanwhile, Yang Xuan suddenly looked him in the eyes, “Don’t become enemies with her!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Yang Xuan fell silent for a long time and replied, “She doesn’t just possess formidable strength, the support she receives in the Yang Clan is beyond your imagination. As I mentioned, if she was a man, then all of you would have no chance to become the Yang Clan’s successor!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I won’t try to offend her, of course. I have better things to do.”

Yang Xuan nodded slightly, “She isn’t a threat to you for now. You have to pay attention to the other young masters instead. So long as the fight for succession begins, the experts of the Yang Clan will go into hiding, and the forces of the various young masters will enter Phecda City. That will be when all of you have to display your strength.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “That will be the most dangerous period for you. Because it will be the best time to kill you for many people in the Yang Clan. In short, you have to be careful!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “You once told me that my father has many loyal subordinates in the clan. Why haven none of them come to me? Don’t tell me that they don’t know that I’ve returned!”

Yang Xuan looked him in the eyes, “They are your father’s subordinates, but they aren’t yours. So, they will naturally not pledge their loyalty to you. Not to mention you, they won’t even pledge their loyalty to you father if he returns as the cripple he was when he left. This is a realistic world, understand?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand. Right, I was attacked by a mysterious True Realm expert, but another mysterious True Realm expert saved me. Do you know who they are?”

Yang Xuan shook her head slightly, “I don’t, but they are definitely members of the Yang Clan. That was just an assassination. Yet now, the fight for succession is about to begin, so they’ll have many ways to kill you out in the open. So, be careful. Understand?”

Yang Ye said, “I’ve always been very careful.” He’d never looked down on the Yang Clan’s fight for succession. He had no intention to become the Yang Clan’s successor, but he had to fight no matter what. Because he wanted to live, and if he wanted to live, then he had to fight back. Fighting back would lead to slaughter!

Give up?

He’d thought about giving up when he was in Merak System, but what did that get him?

He had no choice but to fight! He had to fight to the end!

That was the only way!

Yang Xuan glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Be careful.” She turned around and vanished once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye gazed at the direction Yang Xuan had left towards, and he just gazed at it for a long time. He naturally had his guard up against that auntie of his who just suddenly made an appearance in his life. Because she didn’t have pure intentions.

However, that wasn’t important. His strength was the most important. Because if he had sufficient strength, then all schemes would be nothing before him!

Two days of time!

Yang Ye naturally didn’t waste these two days. He returned to the Primordial Pagoda.

At the 2nd level of the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye went over to Xiao Qi’s side. At this moment, Little Sky was beside Xiao Qi, and the Soul Nurturing Tree was here too. Little Sky’s soul was seated on the tree.

Yang Ye glanced at Xiao Li and gazed at Little Sky, “How are you?”

Little Sky grinned happily, “My soul is fine now. However, I have to return to Merak System to restore my body. It can only be restored by relying on the energy of the earth there. However, I know that you definitely don’t have the time to return, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I can’t head back in the short term. However, trust me, the day will come when I take you back to Merak System.”

Little Sky grinned, “I’m sorry, I’m really not used to other worlds. I prefer returning to Merak System.”

Yang Ye went over to her, rubbed her head gently, and said, “I understand. I’ll take you back once I’m done with my business in the Yang Clan.”

Little Sky asked, “Then what about you?”

Yang Ye thought for a while and said, “No matter where I go, I promise you that once I’m old, I’ll live out the rest of my life in Merak System. Because it’s where I was born and raised. Moreover, my family and you are there!”

Even though he was a member of the Yang Clan, Merak System was his home. His loved ones and friends were there.

The smile on Little Sky’s face grew even more brilliant, “You’re right. No matter where you go, Merak System is your home!”

Yang Ye grinned, and then he gazed at Xiao Qi, “But before I return to live out the rest of my days there, I have to send her home. I promised that I would do that.”

Little Sky gazed at Xiao Qi and said, “With the Soul Nurturing Tree’s help, she’ll probably recover very soon.” Little Sky paused for a moment and continued, “Do you know where she’s from?”

Yang Ye fell silent for an instant and replied, “She should be from the large universe of Milky Way System. Moreover, her status may not be low.”

Little Sky nodded slightly, “She’s really not ordinary. Especially her soul. It gives me an extremely strange feeling.”

Yang Ye nodded, “No matter what, once she wakes up and I send her home, then my mission will be completed.”

Little Sky said, “I’ll wake her up as soon as possible!”

Yang Ye smiled, chatted with Little Sky for a while, and then went over to the pill furnace. The Divine Yin Flame was within it.

Yang Ye gazed at the Divine Yin Flame for a long time and said, “You’re very powerful, right?”

The Divine Yin Flame replied, “Burning you into ashes shouldn’t be a problem!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. He shook his head and said, “I have an idea that I want to try. I’m not sure if it’ll work.”

The Divine Yin Flame asked, “What?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and replied, “I want you to burn my sword intent!”

The Divine Yin Flame’s voice had a trace of surprise in it, “Burn your sword intent?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Yes!’

The Divine Yin Flame remained silent for a long time before it spoke abruptly, ``You want to use my strength to improve your sword intent to the Zenith Realm?”

Yang Ye nodded, “My sword intent is at the Returnal Rank. The only way to improve it further is by stimulating it with other forces. But ordinary things aren’t able to accomplish that. Only your flames can suppress my sword intent. So, I hope to rely on your strength to improve my sword intent to the Zenith Rank!”

The Divine Yin Flame replied, “I don’t know if it’ll work!”

Yang Ye replied, “I have to try!”

The Divine Yin Flame remained silent for a long time and said, “Then let’s try it!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, and then a strand of sword energy appeared out of thin air around him. As soon as his sword intent appeared, the Divine Yin Flame shot out and transformed into a ball of flames that enveloped Yang Ye.

“AH!” An instant later, a shrill cry resounded through the Primordial Pagoda.

It was Yang Ye.

On the 1st level. Snowy was playing with the wooden sword when she heard this shrill cry, and it caused her to shudder before becoming furious. She waved her claw, and the wooden sword flew over into her grasp before she closed her eyes.

Swish!

A moment of silence ensued before Snowy transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

At the same time, the Divine Yin Flame's surprised voice came from the 2nd level, “Little Fellow, what the heck are you doing? Hey! Don’t do anything rash…”
