Chapter 1860 – Ant!

Unseal the wooden sword!

If he still refused to unseal it at a time like this, then he would definitely be doomed to die. As for the monkey’s hair, the monkey had only promised to kill a single person. But there were countless people here. Moreover, the bald man was here too.

So, he wasn’t able to ask the monkey to help him!

Now, he could only rely on himself!

The wooden sword in Yang Ye’s grasp trembled more and more intensely. It didn’t take long for it to crack open while more and more golden light surged out from within it!

At this moment, Yang Ye’s hand started to tremble!

Meanwhile, numerous experts had gathered around Yang Ye. Practically all of them were Quasi Enlightened Realm experts, and there were a few dozen of them!

There was undisguised greed in their eyes as they gazed at Yang Ye. However, none of them noticed that the armored man had an extremely solemn expression on his face. Or it should be described as extremely fearful!

He tightened his grip on the silver spear in his right hand, and he seemed to intend to attack. However, for some unknown reason, he didn’t attack in the end, and he started to move backwards slowly. Because he was moving very slowly and coupled with the fact that everyone’s gazes were focused on Yang Ye, no one here noticed that he was moving backwards!

No one here knew the holy sword’s strength better than him!

The Night Emperor frowned when he noticed that the trembling of Yang Ye’s hand was intensifying, and a bad feeling suddenly arose in his heart!

At this moment, as more and more pieces of wood fell off the wooden sword, Yang Ye’s face started to warp. It didn’t take long for the last piece of wood to fall off, and then a golden sword appeared in Yang Ye’s grasp.

Strength!

At this moment, Yang Ye felt strong. This strength didn’t belong to him, and it belonged to the golden sword in his grasp. The strength within the golden sword was on the verge of exceeding the limits of his body!

Or to be more precise, he was on the verge of being unable to control the sword!

It was like a child holding a saber that was many times heavier than the child’s own bodyweight. Even though the saber was sharp, it was beyond the limits of the child’s strength!

“Let go of it!” Suddenly, Hou Qing’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Or you’ll die from the backlash!”

Let go? Yang Ye shook his head. He would be giving his life away if he released the sword now! In any case, both choices probably ended with death. Since that was the case, he naturally intended to kill a few before he died.

Yang Ye started to hold the wooden sword with both hands, and his profound energy and sword intent surged madly into it. As soon as he did that, the sky instantly dimmed down. At the same time, the stars in the sky trembled, and countless rays of starlight rained down like shooting stars. In the end, all of it surged into the golden sword in Yang Ye’s grasp.

Moreover, the ground started to quake, and countless strands of mysterious energy converged from within the ground before surging into Yang Ye’s sword.

Everyone was shocked by this scene!

The bald man glanced at the golden sword in Yang Ye’s grasp, and then he spoke softly, “The unlocked holy sword… I’m not a match for it….”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and vanished into the sky.

At this moment, the Night Emperor felt that the situation was quite bad as well. He had the intent to leave, but Yang Ye suddenly looked up at him.

The Night Emperor’s eyelids twitched when he saw Yang Ye look at him. He was about to speak when Yang Ye swung the golden sword at him!

As soon as the sword descended, a ray of golden sword energy flashed.

The entire world seemed to turn ethereal at this moment.

The Night Emperor’s expression changed drastically. At this moment, he sensed an unprecedented level of danger, and he immediately stretched out his hands and said, “Defend!”

As soon as he commanded, a black vortex appeared before him. Meanwhile, the golden sword energy shot into the vortex.

Boom!

An instant later, the black vortex collapsed, and then the Night Emperor was blasted over 30km back. As soon as he stopped himself, his arms fell off his shoulders!

Everyone was astounded by the sight of this!

He was the Night Emperor!

However, he couldn’t even resist a single swing of Yang Ye’s sword right now?

It didn’t take long for them to look at the golden sword in Yang Ye’s sword. At this moment, they finally understood why it could pierce through the barrier!

It was truly too terrifying!

Once he launched that attack, Yang Ye raised his sword again. The Night Emperor’s expression changed drastically at the sight of this, and then he didn’t hesitate to vanish into the sky.

He’d fled!

Yang Ye watched the Night Emperor escape. He wanted to chase after him, but he felt like he didn’t even have the strength to raise his feet.

That attack seemed to have exhausted all his strength, and it was even under the circumstances that the sword was cooperating with him. If it refused to cooperate, then he would be the first to die!

Many people were stunned when they saw the Night Emperor flee. None of them had expected the one of the dignified Emperors to actually run!

Suddenly, Yang Ye raised his sword and gazed at them.

All of them didn’t hesitate to turn around and flee when they saw him look at them. In next to no time, everyone had vanished from Yang Ye’s field of vision.

Leave!

That was the only thought in Yang Ye’s mind. He turned around with the intent to leave. However, the Night Emperor suddenly appeared not too far away from him again.

A fierce smile curled up on the corners of his mouth as he said, “Yang Ye, let me see if your sword can save you now!”

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath. He just raised his sword and swung it. As soon as he did that, it seemed to draw upon the stars and the ground, causing the space in an enormous area to become ethereal as if it couldn’t endure the energy within this attack!

The Night Emperor seemed completely fearless as the sword energy shot towards him.

Suddenly, a 300m long violet spike flashed out from before the Night Emperor, and it only took an instant for the spike to stab Yang Ye’s sword energy.

Bang!

A rumbling explosion resounded, and then the entire world seemed to be trembling violently.

The Night Emperor was blasted over 3km away by the aftershock!

It didn’t take long for the surroundings to calm down.

At this moment, a red robed middle aged man was standing beside the Night Emperor, and there was a red spike on the man’s right.

The red robed man sized up Yang Ye and gazed at the golden sword in his grasp, “It truly is a divine treasure. If you’re able to fully control its strength, then even an Exalt like me would have to stay away from you!”

An Exalt! Yang Ye’s heart sank.

It was one of the four Heavenly Exalts!

He hadn’t expected a Heavenly Exalt to appear here. Moreover, it was obvious that this Heavenly Exalt knew the Night Emperor.

Meanwhile, the red robed man added, “Unfortunately, your cultivation is too low, so you’re unable to fully control it. You…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye swung his sword as the red robed man.

Yang Ye almost fell to the ground after he completed this swing. That attack had instantly sucked him dry.

A ray of golden sword energy flashed. At this moment, the radiance of this sword energy overpowered the radiance of the sun! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The red robed man nodded slightly, “Strong indeed. Unfortunately, it’s far from enough!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he grabbed the red spike in his right hand, and then it transformed into a ray of red light that shot towards Yang Ye’s sword energy.

The energy contained within the red light was extremely terrifying as well. Space was instantly obliterated by it, completely obliterated. Even the black hole in space was obliterated in an instant. There was no space or black hole there. Everywhere it passed, only nothingness remained!

The strength of a Heavenly Exalt!

As soon as their attacks collided in midair, countless rays of sword energy and red light sprayed out in all directions. At this moment, an almost endless expanse of the sky was densely covered in red light and sword energy.

It continued for around 15 minutes before the surroundings gradually calmed down.

Yang Ye, the red robed man, and the Night Emperor were still here.

At this moment, the Night Emperor had an extremely solemn expression on his face. His current strength was utterly incapable of resisting that attack Yang Ye had just launched. However, it wasn’t able to kill him either. Moreover, Yang Ye would be crippled if he was able to dodge the few attacks Yang Ye could manage.

Because if Yang Ye wasn’t using his sword to control the space around him, he would have fallen to the ground by now!

Exhausted!

At this moment, Yang Ye was utterly exhausted, both physically and mentally.

The red robed man glanced at the red spike in his grasp. It had cracked open. A moment later, he moved his hand slightly, and then it was instantly transformed into nothingness!

The red robed man shook his head slightly, and then he looked up at Yang Ye, “This treasure of mine has been with me for thousands of years. I never imagined that it would be destroyed by your hands. But it’s fine. Because I’ll get a better one.” As he spoke, he gazed at the sword in Yang Ye’s grasp, “So long as I have it, I’m confident that I’ll even be able to kill one of the ancient cultivators!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he started walking slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, “If I’m not wrong, you aren’t able to launch another attack. Right?”

Suddenly, a ray of dazzling blue light flashed by…

Boom!

The Night Emperor watched with astonishment as the red robed man was blasted over 10km back.

“Ant!” A cold and indifferent voice resounded.
