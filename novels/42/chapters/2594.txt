Chapter 2595

Confidence?

Yang Ye did have no confidence in being able to defeat the bald old man before him.

It was because the bald old man’s strength was definitely at the level of the Soul Sect’s Master, and such experts weren’t existences he could rival right now.

So, it wasn’t a matter of confidence.

Yang Ye stood there with sword in hand, and there was no fear in his eyes.

Fight!

Even if the old man was extremely strong, so what?

Yang Ye dared to fight him!

Yang Ye attacked.

A sword flashed like a bolt of lightning!

Meanwhile, the old man stretched out his right hand and made a grasping motion.

He grabbed Yang Ye’s intent sword!

He’d stopped a sword with his palm!

The powerful force within Yang Ye’s sword couldn’t unleash itself at all, and it was grasped within the old man’s palm.

Meanwhile, the old man squeezed down slightly.

Bang!

The intent sword exploded apart into bits, and the powerful force of the explosion instantly blasted Yang Ye over 3km away!

Yang Ye crashed to the ground.

Bam!

The bridge shook while a wisp of blood seeped out slowly from the corner of Yang Ye’s mouth.

The bald old man grinned, “That attack’s strength wasn’t bad, it wasn’t bad at all. Unfortunately, it still lacks a little something.”

The old man took a step forward once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted, and then he raised his sword with both hands and swung it.

Bang!

A dazzling ray of energy erupted on the bridge.

All of it was formed from sword energy!

Along with the eruption of energy, a figure was blasted away.

Yang Ye!

The old man didn’t attack again. He glanced at his palm, and there was a faint mark there.

His expression became rather solemn from the sight of it.

Logically speaking, it was impossible for someone at Yang Ye’s realm of cultivation to injure him, but Yang Ye had injured him.

The old man looked up at Yang Ye, “Your attainments in the Sword Dao do not conform to your cultivation!”

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and he smiled, “Unfortunately, it doesn’t change anything, right?”

The old man shook his head, “It’s extraordinary that you were able to harm me with an intent sword. Unfortunately, it isn’t enough. It’s not at your limits. Of course, it’s still really good.”

The old man suddenly clenched his right fist, and then he swung a punch at Yang Ye from afar!

Bang!

The Boundless Water on both sides of the bridge rose up into 3 km tall waves.

The space before Yang Ye shook, and then a wave of powerful energy rippled out from it.

Yang Ye didn’t retreat and took a step forward instead. A moment later, his figure turned ethereal, and then countless strands of sword energy and sword intent surged out from him.

The Sword Domain Sphere!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Horrifying hissing resounded on the bridge.

Strands of mysterious energy were sliced apart around Yang Ye, and then the bridge returned to normal once more.

The old man nodded slightly and walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, “That move isn’t bad. It actually destroyed my punch. If I’m being honest, you’ve really surprised me.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man suddenly waved his hands, and the Boundless Water on both sides of the bridge shook. A short while later, the water surged up into the air and arrived above him. A moment later, the water shot down at Yang Ye like two arrows. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly and activated the Sword Domain Sphere again!

Hiss!

At the instant the Sword Domain Sphere appeared, one of the arrows of water exploded apart and fell back below the bridge. However, the other one shot directly through Yang Ye’s chest.

Bam!

Yang Ye was blasted away.

At the instant his figure was blasted away, two intent swords appeared on both sides of the old man, and they were aimed at his throat!

The old man shook his head slightly, stretched out his hands, and shook them gently.

Bang! Bang!

The intent swords were blasted into bits!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye crashed to the ground. There was a bloody hole on his chest, and it had been created by the arrow of water.

It had pierced through him!

Yang Ye forced himself back on his feet, but the old man didn’t attack him. As far as he was concerned, the outcome was predetermined!

Presently, he just wanted to see where Yang Ye’s limits were. Because Yang Ye was able to injure him in this realm of cultivation, and besides surprising him, it had aroused his curiosity.

The old man walked slowly toward Yang Ye, and then he flicked a Violetstar Crystal to Yang Ye, “Heal yourself.”

Yang Ye looked up at the old man, and the latter smiled, “I know you’re not at your limits, so let me see what it is.”

He was like a cat toying with a mouse!

Sometimes, when a cat caught a mouse, it wouldn’t eat the mouse. It would toy with the mouse. It was how the strong toyed with the weak.

Obviously, the old man was doing that to Yang Ye!

Yang Ye chuckled. He didn’t accept the Violetstar Crystal. He stood up and gazed at the old man, “If you want to see my limits, then why don’t you suppress your cultivation to the Lord Realm? In that way, wouldn’t you be able to truly see my limits?”

Suppress his cultivation!

The old man frowned slightly and seemed to be considering it.

Yang Ye smiled, “What? Are you afraid that you’ll die?”

The old man replied, “There’s no need to try and egg me on.”

Yang Ye shrugged, “Do as you wish.”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and smiled, “Alright, I’ll do it.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man’s aura suddenly started to grow weaker, and it gradually descended to the Lord Realm. But it was at the peak of the Lord Realm!

The old man smiled, “Is this enough?”

Yang Ye nodded, “It is.”

He swung his sword!

It was an attack that was executed without warning, and it was smooth as flowing water.

However, the old man pressed his palms together and clamped down on it. The sword seemed as if it was frozen between his palms and couldn’t move at all.

The old man glanced at Yang Ye, “Is that all?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he exerted strength.

Bang!

The intent sword exploded apart and Yang Ye was blasted away.

This time, he didn’t stop. The old man tapped his right foot down and pounced at Yang Ye like a tiger pouncing on its prey. His right hand curved into the shape of a claw, and an ethereal demon beast’s figure appeared around him!

In an instant, he arrived before Yang Ye and clawed down.

The imposing aura this attack carried was extremely formidable and caused the bridge to tremble before it. Some parts of the bridge even cracked open slightly.

Yang Ye didn’t dare to act carelessly. His figure instantly turned ethereal, and then countless strands of sword intent and sword energy swept out from him.

The Sword Domain Sphere!

However, as soon as the claw descended, the sword energy and sword intent were instantly obliterated, and the claw slapped against his chest.

But right at this moment, the intent sword in Yang Ye’s grasp suddenly stabbed the old man’s chest.

Bang!

However, Yang Ye was blasted away while the old man’s chest remained completely unharmed.

At this moment, the old man’s shirt revealed its true form. It wasn’t an ordinary piece of clothing, and it was a divine treasure that was extremely close to becoming a Super Divine Treasure!

Actually, when it was used by the old man, its might wasn’t any weaker to a Super Divine Treasure in Yang Ye’s hands.

Even though it wasn’t a real Super Divine Treasure, its strength still depended on the user!

This time, Yang Ye’s intentions to exchange injuries with the old man hadn’t worked!

The old man patted his chest lightly and looked up at Yang Ye, “Risking your life to take mine. A very good way of thinking. Unfortunately, I’m wearing a divine treasure that’s extremely close to becoming a Super Divine Treasure.”

Yang Ye glanced at himself. There was a huge claw mark on his chest. It was the claw of a beast, and there were spiderweb-like cracks around the claw mark.

His entire body was injured!

Yang Ye looked up at the old man. Even if the old man had suppressed his cultivation, he was still extremely strong!

The old man vanished on the spot, and he was in the air above Yang Ye when he appeared again. When Yang Ye looked up at the old man, he only saw an ethereal demon beast pouncing at him!

The powerful pressure from the attack caused him to feel suffocated!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly while an intent sword condensed in his grasp!

A moment later, the sword suddenly turned ethereal.

The Domain Sword!

Yang Ye suddenly stabbed his sword upward.

Boom!

A rumbling explosion resounded, and then the ethereal demon beast let out a miserable and shrill cry before it exploded apart.

A figure retreated rapidly through the sky and flashed over 300m away.

It was the bald old man!

The old man looked down at his right hand, and there was an extremely deep injury on his right palm. Besides that, his entire right arm was covered in countless cracks!

If he hadn’t withdrawn his hand quickly, he may have lost his entire arm just now!

The old man gazed at Yang Ye and grinned, “A pleasant surprise! A huge surprise! I didn’t expect you to have such a move. That move wasn’t bad. It can even pose a threat to me! You…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and then a sword descended from above the old man!

The Sword Domain!

The Domain Sword!

A ferocious smile curled up on the old man’s lips. He didn’t dodge it and just pressed his palms together instead!

Bang!

Space shook violently!

The old man’s palms clamped down on Yang Ye’s sword!

But this time, it wasn’t that easy. The sword shook violently while powerful energy ceaselessly rippled at its palms!

At this moment, the old man regretted his decision slightly. He’d underestimated the strength of this attack! Now, he’d fallen into a very awkward situation!

He couldn’t attack nor retreat!

Suddenly, the blood vessels beneath Yang Ye’s skin trembled, and then a faint blood red glow appeared on Yang Ye’s intent sword.

Bloodline Energy!

Hiss!

The old man’s hands were sliced open!

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and Yang Ye was blasted away with his sword!

The old man had restored his cultivation!
