Chapter 1363 – Hit Me!

“You know who I am?!” Yang Ye spoke in a low voice. He was naturally surprised because he’d never been to Stellar City, and it was the first time he’d met her. But she knew him.... Why did she know who he was? He didn’t think his reputation had spread through the universe.

“She investigated us!” Meanwhile, Ye Liuyun said, “If I’m not wrong, she sent her people to investigate us once we won our 1st bid. Actually, it’s very easy to determine our background. For example, they just have to find out which teleportation platform we came from, and they would naturally know where we were from.”

Tingyu gazed at Ye Liuyun, and a trace of surprise and shock flashed through her eyes. Because everything Ye Liuyun said was accurate. Once Yang Ye’s group had won their first bid, she’d sent her forces to investigate Yang Ye’s group. After all, no ordinary person could produce 5,000 divine crystals at once.

Once he noticed the change in Tingyu’s expression, Yang Ye knew that Ye Liuyun’s guess was almost completely accurate. He was quite surprised in his heart. He was surprised by the merchant group’s ability to determine their origins in such a short while. It showed how powerful the merchant group was within Stellar City.

Yang Ye said, “Miss Tingyu, do you need something?”

Tingyu withdrew her gaze and looked at Yang Ye, “I never expected that the restrictions over Dark Hell Continent were actually eliminated. Besides that, Dark Hell Continent was even completely united. The biggest surprise was that it was actually an Emperor that accomplished that.” She sized up Yang Ye at this point and continued, “I’m quite curious how you united Dark Hell Continent with your strength!”

Yang Ye said, “Miss Tingyu, you came here just for that?”

“Of course not!” She smiled, and then she withdrew a silver card and passed it to Yang Ye, “Alliance Master Yang, this is our ordinary VIP Card. Anyone who spends 10,000 divine crystals can obtain this card. You can book a room in advance with this card, and you can enjoy many member benefits of ours.”

Yang Ye didn’t refuse it and took the card, “We have other matters to attend to, so we’ll be leaving now.”

Tingyu said, “Our merchant group will be auctioning off a final item in a while. It’s a treasure at the Origin Rank. Alliance Master Yang, are you not going to have a look?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t have more divine crystals, so it’s a waste of time. Miss Tingyu, farewell.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye didn’t stay a moment longer and left.

Tingyu was stunned, and then she shook her head and chuckled, “They really are from a remote place.... What a waste of a VIP Card.” Dark Hell continent had once been a medium world, but it was even inferior to a small world now. So, a person from such a place was naturally not worth becoming on friendly terms with.

...

After he left the auction house, Yang Ye said, “Liuyun, find out when the teleportation formation will be repaired.”

After he found out about the situation that Lady was in, he couldn’t wait to head to the Radiant Dimension and get An Nanjing and the others.

Ye Liuyun said, “I sent someone earlier. We’ll find out right away once it’s repaired.”

Yang Ye nodded and thought to himself, Luckily, I brought her with me. She’s farsighted, so I can avoid a lot of trouble while I have her by my side.

Yang Ye’s group didn’t speak and just sped up. Once they returned to Divine Sky Pavilion, Yang Ye returned to his room. Moreover, he gave the order that no one beside Ye Liuyun is to disturb him.

Yang Ye withdrew the scroll with the Stellar Ward technique. He’d merely just unrolled it when it transformed into a ray of light that entered the center of his forehead. After that, a string of information appeared in his mind.

“The Stellar Ward technique, a low-grade Origin Rank technique. Once activated, stellar energy can be drawn into the body to crystallize the body....”

A long time passed before Yang Ye opened his eyes slowly, and then he vanished from the room.

Once he left the room, Yang Ye found a random pavilion, and he sat cross-legged on its roof. After that, he silently circulated the Stellar Ward technique to absorb the stellar energy in the sky. As the technique circulated, the boundless starlight in the sky started to surge slowly in Yang Ye’s direction. As they surged into his body, his body started to emanate faint starlight.

Actually, there wasn’t a huge difference between the complete and incomplete versions of the Stellar Ward technique. The method of cultivation was the same. So, it was absolutely easy for him to cultivate it. Especially when he was in Stellar City. After all, the stellar energy here was truly too thick!

In the past, the incomplete Stellar Ward technique merged the stellar energy into his skin, blood, and bones. Yet now, the complete version didn’t just merge stellar energy into his entire body, it even made his body crystallize. What did that mean?

Crystallization represented the Stellar Form. Once he activated it and drew stellar energy into himself, the stellar energy would solidify and transform his entire body into a stellar form.

It didn’t look much different in appearance to the incomplete version of the Stellar Ward technique, but there was actually a huge difference. It was a qualitative difference!

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s clothes shattered into bits, and it didn’t take long for his body to start transforming. In just a short while, there was a crystal blue layer of scales on Yang Ye’s skin, and then his entire body and even eyes were gradually covered by a layer of crystal blue scales. However, the scales over his eyes were translucent!

Moreover, there was faint crystal blue energy flickering through the scales.

A long time passed before Yang Ye stood up slowly. He gazed at the scales which covered his entire body, and then he took a deep breath and touched his chest gently. It felt icy cold like ice, and this shocked Yang Ye. After all, his hand was covered in scales, yet he was able to clearly sense how cold the scales were. What did that represent? It represented that these scales wouldn’t affect his movements at all!

Indeed. Even though there was a layer of scales over him, they felt as if they didn’t exist. Moreover, he felt like his body had grown lighter!

Yang Ye stretched his body for a while, and then he summoned the Sword Spirit.

Yang Ye pointed at his chest and said, “Try hitting me. Let’s see if you can pierce my defenses!” He wanted to know how strong his defenses were. His intuition told him that it was strong, extremely strong. Based on his current physical defenses, he wouldn’t suffer any injuries even if he stood there and allowed a Voider to hit him all day and night!

The Sword Spirit glanced at him and said, “Are you sure?” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Yang Ye nodded, “Of course!”

She nodded slightly, and then transformed into the Sword Precursor before turning into a ray of light that stabbed against Yang Ye’s chest.

Hiss!

A muffled bang resounded, and then Yang Ye was pushed over 10m away. Once he stopped moving, he had an extremely unsightly expression on his face. Because there was a hole in his chest. There was only a hole on the scales and not his body, and it was naturally because the Sword Spirit had held back.

Yang Ye had an extremely gloomy expression on his face, “It’s so weak!”

“It isn’t weak!” Meanwhile, she appeared before Yang Ye and said, “Not to mention that it’s only a low-grade Origin Rank technique, even a high-grade Origin Rank technique can’t withstand an attack from me.”

Yang Ye instantly came to a sudden understanding. He’d almost forgotten that the Sword Spirit surpassed the known ranks of quality! No matter how strong the Stellar Ward technique was, it had a rank, but the Sword Spirit surpassed the ranking system.... So, how could it resist her?

Simply speaking, the Stellar Ward technique wasn’t weak, it was the Sword Precursor that was too sharp!

Meanwhile, the Sword Spirit said, “If your current physical defenses are supplemented by the Stellar War technique and the Phantom Shield, then not to mention a Voider, even Semi-Deities would find it difficult to harm you. However, you have to be absolutely careful if you encounter an expert like Jian Xu. Such experts aren’t existences that you can fight right now. It’s impossible even if you use me. The gap between your cultivations is too huge, and it isn’t something that can be made up for with external sources of strength.”

Yang Ye nodded. Jian Xu hadn’t even used his full strength during the battle with Yang Ye that day. If Jian Xu had no intention to delay and fought with his full strength, then Yang Ye would probably be dead. As for an expert like Lady and Blind Maiden, it was obvious. It wouldn’t just be impossible if he used the Sword Spirit, it would be impossible even if Qiong Qi joined forces with him as well. However, it was still possible to struggle against such experts. After all, his strength had risen tremendously, and Qiong Qi had recovered slightly as well!

In short, he was very strong to many, but he was still very weak to some.

It depended on who he compared himself with!

He naturally wouldn’t compare himself with those who were weaker to him. After all, he would only realize what he lacked and avoid becoming conceited by comparing himself with stronger experts!

Yang Ye glanced at the scales on his body and issued a command in his heart. It didn’t take long for the scales to gradually vanish, and then a green robe covered his body. He didn’t have the habit of staying naked.

Yang Ye gazed at the Sword Spirit and said, “Let’s return!”

She nodded slightly. Suddenly, Yang Ye and the Sword Spirit frowned simultaneously, and then they looked towards the distance.

A man in a green robe was shooting forward in their direction. He was extremely swift, and it only took an instant for him to arrive before Yang Ye and the Sword Spirit.

There were a few formidable auras behind the man.

Yang Ye glanced at the man and moved aside. He was allowing the man to pass because he didn’t want to get into any trouble.

Right when the man was about to pass them, he suddenly stopped momentarily and said, “I’ve got it. Protect me. I’ll get away first!”

It seemed like he’d done it on purpose because his voice was extremely loud, and it could be heard clearly from at least 30km away.

As soon as he finished speaking, he immediately shot towards the distance.

Yang Ye’s face instantly became gloomy, Do I look like I’m easy to bully?

Yang Ye remained silent for an instant, and then Blink appeared behind him. A moment later, Yang Ye appeared in front of the green robed man.

The green robed man was shocked, An Emperor is actually that swift?

Meanwhile, Yang Ye stretched out his hand and said, “Where is it?”

The green robed man was speechless.
