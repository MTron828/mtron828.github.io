Chapter 2588

Yang Ye laid there silently in space while cracks covered his body.

The backlash from his Sword Domain wasn’t that easy to endure. Especially when he didn’t have the help of an endless supply of Primordial Violet Energy.

Just like that, it took Yang Ye an entire six hours to recover by almost 80%.

After that, he stood up.

Continue!

Yang Ye was very well aware that if someone else could use the sword to form a Domain, then he could!

So, Yang Ye started once more.

Unfortunately, no matter how he tried, he couldn’t accomplish what that sword cultivator had. Or it should be said that it was too, too difficult to shrink it.

It was so hard he practically felt despair! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After countless failures, Yang Ye slowly calmed down.

He knew that at most times, one couldn’t persist meaninglessly on things. Because it would do nothing besides waste time.

Yang Ye stopped and started to think.

Bit by bit!

A Domain of the sword!

Yang Ye looked down at his sword and fell silent.

The area around him was silent as well.

A long time passed before the intent sword in Yang Ye’s grasp suddenly started to tremble. Unlike before, his body didn’t tremble!

The sword!

Yang Ye stared at his sword!

At this moment, he suddenly realized that the Sword Domain was formed from his sword intent. In other words, they were part of him! Moreover, the Sword Domain wasn’t a domain of its own. Of course, it could do that, but the Sword Domain’s core was the sword!

The sword!

Since the very beginning, he’d overlooked this!

In the sky, Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly while the intent sword in his grasp started to turn ethereal. In the end, it started to become solid once more. But just a short while later, it exploded apart.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted backward repeatedly!

But there was a smile on his face!

Because his thoughts were correct!

In order to make a Domain of the sword, the sword must be at its core, not the user. Of course, the goal was to create a domain of its own, then the user must be at its core! Yang Ye was overjoyed by this discovery!

Presently, while he hadn’t fully succeeded at making a Domain of the sword, he’d gained some insight into it!

Continue!

Yang Ye started again!

However, time flew by. Three days later, Yang Ye received word that he must leave!

Yang Ye was quite depressed because he’d finally gotten an idea of what to do. But he had to stop now.

Yang Ye left the cultivation room, but he didn’t see Jian Bei, nor did he have a way to contact the latter.

Yang Ye decided to wait!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, left the hall, and arrived at a forest. Deep within the forest, after Yang Ye verified that the surroundings were safe, he sat down cross-legged and condensed an intent sword!

Continue!

After figuring out some things, Yang Ye noticed that forming a Domain of the sword wasn’t that difficult. At the very least, it wasn’t as difficult as the Sword Domain Sphere! Something worth mentioning was that as his attainments in the Sword Dao deepened, the strength of his Sword Domain Sphere was improving as well. Of course, his main goal was the Sword Domain now.

The space around Yang Ye suddenly turned ethereal, but it didn’t take long for space to return to normal. However, Yang Ye’s sword gradually turned ethereal. But a moment later, the sword became material once more, and then a short while later, it turned ethereal again. It was in a cycle of turning ethereal and material.

Finally, a long time later, Yang Ye’s sword turned completely ethereal.

Success!

The sword in his grasp had a domain of its own now!

Yang Ye was overjoyed.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Qi Bitian shook her head, “It’s only the beginning!”

Yang Ye hadn’t been able to hear Qi Bitian. All he did know was that he’d succeeded. While he’d faced many difficulties along the way, the outcome was a favorable one!

The sword in his grasp had a Domain of its own. While it was under his control, it was still independent. It was a very strange state that he couldn’t explain.

As he held the intent sword, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. At this moment, he really wanted to fight someone and test his Sword Domain’s strength!

Unfortunately, there was no one here!

Yang Ye calmed himself and put his sword away!

Yang Ye returned to the dock as he’d decided to wait there for Jian Bei. As for why he hadn’t gone to the hall, it was because he didn’t have any money! He was utterly poor and without any money, but everything required money there. Even a cup of tea was something he couldn’t afford.

Poverty!

It was the first time Yang Ye felt so poor!

Yang Ye sat on a huge rock and gazed at the boundless waters before him. His heart was very calm.

If there was a difference between him now and how he was when he’d first arrived here, then it was a change in his mental state. He wasn’t that restless now, and his heart was always calm no matter what he did.

Of course, his strength had undergone a tremendous change too!

He wasn’t just at the Lord Realm now, his attainments in the Sword Dao couldn’t be compared to what it was anymore!

It could be said that Lord Realm experts were no match for him now!

Even grade 3 Lord Realm experts like the Soul Exalt of the Soul Sect were existences he was confident in being able to kill!

Suddenly, a boat appeared in the distance. Yang Ye focused his gaze. He saw the same boatman, and on the boat was another person. That person seemed quite familiar to Yang Ye!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to see the person clearly.

It was the Ascetic, Ye Wenfeng. The middle aged man who’d sold him the Ancient Bell.

At this moment, the Ascetic noticed Yang Ye as well, and he grinned and nodded in greeting.

A short while later, the boat docked before Yang Ye, and then the Ascetic arrived in front of him, “I didn’t expect to see you here!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Are you here to sell things?”

The Ascetic’s eyes lit up, “Do you need more?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “No, I don’t even have anything on me!”

The Ascetic grinned, “You must be joking. You even had a token like that, so how could you be an ordinary person?”

Yang Ye shook his head. He knew the man before him didn’t believe him!

But he really didn’t even have the money to take the boat!

When he thought of money, Yang Ye realized how important money was! After all, the only way to leave this place was to use the teleportation formation which Jian Bei had told him about. But that required money!

He had to make money!

Rob?

Needless to say, the first thought that came to mind when he needed to earn money was to rob. Robbing was always the fastest way to earn money!

But it didn’t take long for him to abandon such an unrealistic thought.

Rob?

Besides that young saber cultivator, he hadn’t met a single person here who was weaker than him! Even that young saber cultivator had an extraordinary expert’s protection!

So, who would he rob?

He was lucky to not be robbed by anyone else!

Meanwhile, the Ascetic suddenly said, “Would you like to have a drink with me? The thousand-year-old brew here isn’t bad.”

Thousand-year-old brew!

Yang Ye blinked, “Is it your treat?”

The Ascetic chuckled, “Alright, it’s my treat!”

Yang Ye cupped his fist, “Then I humbly accept!”

The Ascetic glanced at the boatman, “Elder Zhu, would you like to come with us?”

The boatman was quite hesitant. Meanwhile, the Ascetic smiled, “Elder Zhu, the brew we’re going to drink is very rare. Since the Divine Abode is willing to serve it this time, it’s an opportunity for all wine enthusiasts like yourself. You won’t get another chance if you miss this one!”

The boatman put down the oar and walked off the boat.

The Ascetic grinned and gazed at Yang Ye, “Young Brother, let’s go!”

Just like that, the Ascetic led them into the palace, and far north within it was a tower made of bamboo. It had three floors.

The Divine Abode!

It was the place the Ascetic had mentioned earlier!

As soon as they entered the Divine Abode, a beautiful woman greeted them. She was truly drop dead gorgeous, with a tall figure and extraordinary bearing. Most importantly, she was strong!

Yang Ye couldn’t sense her cultivation at all!

She glanced at Yang Ye, and there was a trace of bewilderment in her eyes. A moment later, she gazed at Elder Zhu and smiled, “I didn’t expect you to grace us with your presence, Elder Zhu. Please come in!”

The Ascetic smiled, “Zuo Qing, so you’re only welcoming Elder Zhu?”

The woman, Zuo Qing, smiled, “You must be joking, Senior Ye. You’re a rare guest too. Come with me to the 2nd floor.”

The Ascetic smiled and gazed at Elder Zhu, “Elder Zhu, you really are respected. We’re able to ascend to the 2nd floor immediately.”

Elder Zhu glanced at the Ascetic, “You make it sound like you can’t!”

The Ascetic smiled and didn’t offer a reply.

Zuo Qing led them up to the 2nd floor, and they sat down at a table by the window.

Zuo Qing glanced at Yang Ye, and Yang Ye smiled, “I can’t sit here?”

She shook her head and smiled, “Of course you can. But…”

She gazed at the Ascetic and Elder Zhu.

The Ascetic smiled, “He’s someone I just met, and I think he isn’t bad. So, I invited him to have a drink with me.”

Zuo Qing was slightly hesitant, “Senior, I’m sure you know the rules of the 2nd floor. So…”

The Ascetic grinned, “You won’t even give me this bit of face?”

She smiled bitterly, “Senior, I’m sure you’re aware that there are rules, and I must abide by them.”

The Ascetic’s face was devoid of a smile now, and he gazed at Yang Ye, “I’m sorry. How about we head downstairs to drink instead?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Senior, is there a condition to drink up here?”

The Ascetic nodded slightly, “You must be acknowledged by them.”

Yang Ye asked, “How does someone get acknowledged by them?”

The Ascetic shook his head, “I don’t know what their standard is.” He gazed at Zuo Qing and continued, “Miss Zuo Qing, can you tell us what it is?”

She pondered for a moment and replied, “Either strength or wealth.”

She glanced at Yang Ye once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye smiled bitterly because she was very frank!

Strength?

How strong could a Lord Realm expert like him be? Wealth? He didn’t have anything to display that either.

Yang Ye shook his head and was about to leave, but a fruit suddenly appeared before him.

Elder Zhu and the Ascetic’s gazes instantly moved onto the fruit.

A Worldborn Fruit!

A ripe Worldborn Fruit!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye scratched his head, “I was thinking that we need something to be paired with our wine. But now it seems like… Sigh…”

As he spoke, he picked up the Worldborn Fruit and walked away.

Worldborn Fruit with wine!

Zuo Qing’s face had stiffened.
