Chapter 2678 – World of Past Life!

A bandit!

A true bandit!

The old man really wanted to cry!

Suddenly, Snowy withdrew the bamboo chest and passed it to the old man.

The old man was stunned.

Snowy cracked a smile. She pointed at the bamboo chest and pointed at both Erya and herself. She was asking him if he had anything that was suitable for them, and just one would be enough.

It was fine if he didn’t!

They didn’t want the bamboo chest!

The old man was absolutely stunned! He wondered if Snowy was up to something!

Actually, Erya and Snowy weren’t unreasonable. At most times, they just felt it was fun. Of course, they really wanted the bamboo chest because it was full of treasures!

But they remembered that the old man had helped Yang Ye and them.

They couldn’t do this!

So, they changed their usual shameless attitude for now and returned it.

The old man glanced at them, and then he smiled and opened the bamboo chest.

Erya and Snowy hurriedly looked at it. They held it in their hands and gazed at it with eyes full of anticipation.

The old man pulled out a staff. A pure white cane that seemed as if it was made of jade. It was around a meter long, less than a finger in width, and had a dark green gem at the top.

There were two characters inscribed on the gem—“灵杖”!

Sprite Staff!

There were some cracks all around it.

The old man passed the Sprite Staff to Snowy, “It’s one of the weapons you once used. It’s a treasure of utmost goodness, and it has many terrifying abilities. Unfortunately, it was severely damaged during the battle. Of course, I’m sure you can repair it!”

Snowy blinked and took it from him.

As soon as it entered her grasp, the Sprite Staff shook, and then an invisible spirit energy barrier appeared.

The old man grinned, “It’ll make using the Sprite Domain much easier for you.”

Enhancement!

One of the staff’s abilities that he knew of was its ability to enhance, it could enhance Snowy’s strength tremendously!

Snowy really couldn’t keep her paws off the staff. Every swing of it severely affected the spirit energy in the surroundings.

Meanwhile, Erya gazed at the old man. She was asking him for her gift!

The old man thought for a moment and sighed softly. After that, he withdrew something from the bamboo chest.

It was an axe!

The axe’s hilt was made of rough pitch black metal, and its blade was a piece of unknown black metal too. There were some gaps in its blade.

It didn’t look very nice in appearance!

Erya was quite disappointed!

The old man smiled, “Don’t be disappointed! Try it out!”

Erya grabbed the axe, but she almost failed to hold it up!

So heavy!

That was what Erya felt!

Erya blinked and was quite interested now. She started to exert strength, and it didn’t take long for her to raise it slowly. But it was still quite heavy.

“Use both hands!” The old man spoke abruptly.

Erya shook her head, “I can do it with one hand. Let me get used to it for a moment!”

The old man laughed bitterly. If the original owner of this axe heard her, that person would probably be embarrassed to death!

Erya raised the axe and waved it about with a single hand, and then she gazed at the old man, “Gramps, is this axe formidable in battle?”

Gramps!

The old man laughed bitterly again. He really didn’t dare to accept such a name.

In the past, Erya had been very powerful and overbearing. No one in the world was worth a glance to her!

Even Destiny had been very respectful to Erya.

Now, she was calling him gramps!

The once most evil existence in the world had become slightly different now!

The old man restrained his thoughts and answered her, “It’s called the Desolate Axe, and it’s from the Desolate Clan. Right, it’s from the former form of the current desolate race. There were around 10 extremely powerful clans then, and the desolate clan was one of them. Of course, besides the desolate race, all the others are gone now.”

He sighed softly at this point.

“They’re all gone?” Erya blinked, “Why?”

The old man replied softly, “All of them were slaughtered.”

Erya was quite curious, “Who did it?”

The old man smiled, “You’ll find out soon enough. Now, let me tell you about this axe. The Desolate Axe belonged to the patriarch of the Desolate Clan at that time. It was an extremely good weapon at the time. It was forged from the cores of many black holes, so it’s extremely heavy and impossible to lift by ordinary people. Even the patriarch of the Desolate Clan had to use two hands to wield it. It was even under the circumstances that his heart and mind were one with the axe!”

He seemed to have thought of something at this point and gazed at Erya with a smile on his face, “You’re an exception. You can wield it with a single hand!”

Erya waved the axe and gazed at Snowy, “Snowy, let me see yours!”

Snowy passed the Sprite Staff to her and she passed the axe to Snowy. Snowy held it up without any difficulty whatsoever…

Erya was at a loss for words.

The old man’s face stiffened as well.

Snowy waved the axe, knocked it, and seemed quite curious.

Erya gazed at the old man, and the old man laughed bitterly, “She’s the sprite of goodness in the world. Theoretically speaking, she can use all divine treasures, unless they are of utmost evil and counter her!”

He glanced at Erya with a weird expression in his eyes.

Utmost evil?

She was the greatest evil! But instead of clashing as they were supposed to, these two little fellows were absolutely close. Simply speaking, they had no natural enemies now that they were together!

Meanwhile, the old man gazed at Yang Ye. At the same time, Snowy and Erya went over to Yang Ye’s side.

It was because Yang Ye had regained consciousness.

The old man sighed softly when he noticed how concerned Erya and Snowy were. He wondered what kind of good deeds Yang Ye had done in his previous life to actually make these two little fellows treat him like a loved one!

Yang Ye felt very weak, extremely even. He didn’t even have the strength to stand up.

Yang Ye gazed at the old man, and the old man spoke solemnly, “I’m going to send you to a place. It’s her final test for you. If you succeed, you’ll obtain many things you never imagined possible, but if you fail, you will die. Of course, you can choose to refuse. If you give up, your cultivation will recover immediately. However, she will take back Past Life and the Energy of Past Life. She said that you have the right to choose, and she won’t force you to do anything!”

Yang Ye glanced at his body, fell silent for a moment, and then he gazed at the old man, “I agree!”

An opportunity!

He was very well aware that it was an opportunity, and he had to grab onto it!

The old man nodded slightly and gazed at both Erya and Snowy, “Now, both of you return to the pagoda, and you cannot come outside and help him!”

Erya frowned, “Why?”

The old man didn’t explain and gazed at Yang Ye. He knew that Yang Ye had to explain.

Yang Ye gazed at Erya and Snowy with a smile, “I want to grow stronger, so I must do it myself. Both of you just play in the pagoda, alright?”

Erya and Snowy exchanged glances, and then they nodded and returned to the pagoda!

They were very confident in Yang Ye.

He was their Big Brother Yang!

Yang Ye gazed at the old man, and the latter nodded slightly and waved his right hand before vanishing on the spot with Yang Ye.

The old man shot through space with Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was very weak, and he didn’t even have the ability to fly!

Moreover, he didn’t even have the ability to use his profound energy!

Something worth mentioning was that he was like an ordinary person now!

Finally, they arrived at a teleportation formation.

A stellar teleportation formation!

The old man put Yang Ye down and spoke softly, “Besides the countless geniuses of her era, there were nine heavens and ten clans. Eight of the ten clans have been annihilated, but their old homes are still there. Of course, most of them are in ruins. The World of Past Life is behind this teleportation formation, and it’s the Past Life Clan’s territory. Your objective is to get out of there alive!”

Yang Ye glanced at the teleportation formation and said, “The World of Past Life? How is she linked to it?”

The old man fell silent.

Yang Ye didn’t inquire further. He glanced at the teleportation formation and asked, “I really can’t use my cultivation?”

The old man nodded, “Most people cannot undo her seal. Unless you give up. If you give up, you’ll recover immediately.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand!”

The old man spoke softly, “You must realize that she doesn’t have much time left, and you don’t have much time either. You really don’t.”

He looked up at the sky and said, “Do you know why the Destiny in black isn’t going to kill those Destiny Realm experts?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

The old man explained softly, “Two reasons. Firstly, she has to suppress some existences. Secondly, she thinks you should put an end to their lives. Because based on the current circumstances, she had clearly accepted you.”

Yang Ye smiled wryly.

The old man placed his right hand on Yang Ye’s back, and then Yang Ye floated slowly toward the teleportation formation, “Whether your Sword Dao and strength advances further is all up to you.”

Yang Ye just happened to enter the teleportation formation once he finished speaking.

A moment later, the teleportation formation activated, and Yang Ye was sucked into it!

The old man fell silent for a long time, and then he lifted the bamboo chest on his back and left.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Once he left, the teleportation formation vanished as well.
