Chapter 2067 – Unexpected Turn!

A Sage!

An expert at this realm of cultivation was amongst the strongest existences in the world. Of course, excluding the progenitors. However, there were probably no more than a dozen existences like that. Moreover, they practically never showed themselves.

It could be said that Sages were the strongest to most people!

Moreover, Sages had the right to be crowned as the strongest.

Yang Ye hadn’t expected a mere student to make a Sage show himself. However, Yang Ye didn’t really care.

He knew very well that he couldn’t defeat a Sage. However, it didn’t represent that he didn’t have the strength to fight one. In any case, it didn’t matter whether he could defeat a Sage, the main point was not shrinking back before even trying.

The old man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he said, “You’re either from the Weapon Path or Dao Path!”

The old man had investigated him!

Yang Ye glanced at the old man and asked, “Is it important?”

The old man nodded, “Of course it is. Tell me who your master is. Perhaps I know him!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I don’t have one. However, I know someone called Zhong Ye. I wonder if you know him!”

Zhong Ye!

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly when he heard that name, “I was wondering why you were so arrogant and unrestrained. So you have the support of such a powerful figure.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Senior, you can kill me. Because Senior Zhong Ye said that he won’t save me, and he’ll only avenge me. I believe that you aren’t afraid of the Weapon Path, right?”

The old man’s eyes remained narrowed, and a cold glow flickered within them.

Yang Ye chuckled and sat down. Looks like Zhong Ye’s name is quite effective.

However, he felt it was quite a pity that he couldn’t fight a Sage now. He did want to fight a Sage right now as he wanted to determine the gap between them!

A gap definitely existed, and he just didn’t know how huge it was!

A short while passed before the old man said, “My Gu Clan will remember this.”

He turned around and left once he finished speaking, but he stopped just a short while later, “I heard that someone obtained many Originite in a mysterious ruins, and that person’s from Martial Emperor Academy. If I’m not wrong, that person is you, right?”

Yang Ye frowned slightly. Meanwhile, the old man added, “Let me see if Zhong Ye will be able to protect you now. Good luck!”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye’s face fell. Obviously, it was Han Yi’s group’s work.

Suddenly, the woman in white clothes walked out of the library. She glanced at him, and she didn’t say a word before walking off and vanishing from his field of vision.

Once she left, Yang Ye suddenly stood up, “100 points, two months. Who’s willing to look after the library?”

The spectators were quite stunned by this, but it didn’t take long for a man to run over to Yang Ye, “Me! I’m willing!”

Yang Ye nodded, withdrew his card, and passed it to the man. The man hurriedly took the card and swiped it against his own card. After that, he returned it to Yang Ye. Yang Ye took the card and vanished into the sky.

…

Avaricious Wolf Mountain.

Since he had an opportunity, he naturally planned to join Martial Emperor Academy. After all, Originite was still extremely important to him. The Inheritance Stone he obtained from that person from the Prehistoric Civilization allowed him to realize that it was Originite, but they just had different names for it.

That Originite had been extremely helpful to him, and it was the reason his Sword Domain had been able to advance into the next level. That was why he didn’t fear that Sage just now and even wanted to challenge the old man!

Because his Sword Domain had improved tremendously, and his Sword Dao was improved tremendously while within the Sword Domain.

Martial Emperor Academy!

The incident outside the library had spread through the academy, and countless heard of Yang Ye’s name.

Of course, that wasn’t the main point. The main point was that someone from the Sky Class had come and invited Yang Ye to join!

The Sky Class was the ultimate goal of all the students in Martial Emperor Academy. Yet now, a mere librarian had actually been invited to join it. This made many people feel quite displeased.

However, even if they were displeased, no one went looking for trouble with Yang Ye. After all, they weren’t fools. Just the fact he’d been invited to join the Sky Class proved many things, like Yang Ye’s strength.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had arrived at Avaricious Wolf Mountain.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then looked off into the distance. There was a hall there, and it was the only hall on the mountain.

Yang Ye walked over to it, and its door suddenly swung open. Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to walk in, and a gray robed old man suddenly appeared before him.

Yang Ye sized up the old man and flicked the black card to the old man. The old man glanced at it and frowned slightly.

A short while later, he gazed at Yang Ye, “You want to join the Sky Class?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The old man suddenly asked, “Are you ready?”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, “Ready for what?”

“Your test!” The old man continued, “A small test!”

Yang Ye replied, “What test?”

The corners of the old man’s mouth curled up slightly, “You’ll find out soon!!

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man waved his right hand, and the scene around Yang Ye instantly started to change. Or to be more precise, the surroundings darkened. In the end, it was like he was within a black hole.

It was completely pitch black!

At this moment, he could see nothing. Even if he used his heart and mind, he could still see nothing.

It was truly dark!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and sat cross-legged on the ground.

The Laws of Darkness!

Perhaps others would feel terror towards the darkness. Especially when even their senses couldn’t see through the absolute darkness around them, but Yang Ye wouldn’t. While he rarely used the Laws of Darkness, it didn’t represent that it was useless!

However, it wasn’t as simple as he’d thought. He suddenly heard footsteps in the darkness.

Yang Ye suddenly turned around, and a sharp claw had slapped down on his chest.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s figure was blasted away. At the same time, some blood sprayed from his chest.

As soon as he stopped himself, footsteps appeared in front of him. At the same time, a claw slapped down at his chest again.

Bang!

It was clearly much stronger than the last attack, and Yang Ye’s figure curled up as it flew backwards.

Yang Ye’s figure hadn’t even descended to the ground when he heard footsteps again.

Yang Ye’s expression changed, and he raised his sword and stabbed forward. However, a claw grabbed onto his sword, and then a wave of powerful force struck against his arm. It caused his entire arm to start cracking open and bleeding. At the same time, it had taken Yang Ye’s sword, and then it swung his sword horizontally at his neck.

If it struck Yang Ye, it was obvious that his neck would definitely be severed from his body.

At the critical moment, Yang Ye’s figure bent slightly and avoided the attack. At the same time, he stomped his right foot down and shot forward like a cannonball while slamming his knee upward.

At this moment, he stopped holding back. The force his knee carried was sufficient to destroy a Major Zen Realm demon beast. However, it felt like he’d slammed his knee against an iron plate, and his entire leg felt numb while the force of his own attack blasted him away.

As soon as his figure started flying, a sword appeared before him and shot towards his forehead.

A wisp of ruthlessness flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes.

Roar!

A dragon roar resounded, and an ethereal white dragon appeared behind Yang Ye. A moment later, he raised his dragon claw and slammed it forward.

Bang!

Space shook violently while a wave of terrifying energy swept out in the darkness. The powerful wave of force blasted Yang Ye away, but he hadn’t even recovered from it when a sword shot towards him.

It was his own sword!

Yang Ye stomped his right foot down and forced himself to a stop. After that, he grabbed the sword with his right hand. However, as soon as he did that, the powerful force contained within it blasted him 300m back.

At this moment, Yang Ye felt that his internal organs had cracked open.

Yang Ye looked up, but he saw nothing. However, the footsteps resounded again. Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and then stood up slowly. He raised his palm and a sword floated silently on it. At the same time, an ethereal sword appeared around him.

Sword Fusion combined with Burial!

A resounding sword howl surged through the darkness, and then a ray of light flashed. Everywhere it passed, the darkness seemed to be sliced open before it.

A claw suddenly stretched out at the end of the sword energy.

Bang!

It was like mountains were collapsing and the earth was quaking. The dark expanse of space shook violently and seemed like it was about to collapse!

Yang Ye held his sword in both hands and was about to attack again. However, the surroundings changed, and he felt dizzy. A short while later, he’d returned to the hall, and the gray robed old man was in front of him.

The old man gazed at him for a long time and said, “There are two things I must tell you. Firstly, you’ve passed the Earth Exalt’s test.”

Yang Ye asked, “What about the second?”

The old man spoke indifferently, “You can’t join the Sky Class. Moreover, you must leave Martial Emperor Academy immediately. You only have 15 minutes. If you haven’t left in 15 minutes, then the academy will declare you an enemy of the academy.”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly.
