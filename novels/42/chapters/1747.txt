Chapter 1748 - Have You Been To Hell?

Needless to say, Ying Wu and the others had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces.

They stared at Yang Ye. If their gazes could kill, Yang Ye would have died thousands of times by now. Moreover, it wasn’t just their gazes that were murderous, they really did want to attack and kill him.

However, they hesitated when they looked at the black Sword Chest in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Xiao said that Yang Ye’s profound energy had dried up, and they believed that. Because that sword formation had been so powerful, so it definitely exhausted a huge amount of energy. Thus, they believed that Yang Ye’s profound energy had dried up.

But!

What if Yang Ye’s profound energy hadn’t dried up? What if he could execute it again?

Based on their current state, if Yang Ye were to activate that sword formation again, then they would definitely be annihilated! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Ying Wu and the others were concerned about that and didn’t dare to attack, and Yang Ye naturally wouldn’t attack. He had to buy time now! The longer the better!

Meanwhile, Yang Xiao roared with fury, “If he still had strength, he would have activated it again. But he hasn’t! That’s because his profound energy has dried up. If you don’t attack now, you’ll die once he recovers his profound energy!”

Ying Wu and the others gazed at Yang Ye. At this moment, there was no hesitation left in their eyes.

Yang Xiao’s words were like a wake-up call to them!

If Yang Ye still had strength, he would definitely attack them. Since Yang Ye hadn’t attacked, it proved that he didn’t have the strength to do so!

Ying Wu and the others were about to attack, but Yang Ye suddenly wrapped his arms around the Sword Chest and started walking in Yang Xiao’s direction, “You think I don’t have any profound energy left, right? Alright, let me show you if I have profound energy in me!”

Ying Wu and the others immediately stopped when they saw Yang Ye walking in Yang Xiao’s direction.

Obviously, Yang Ye intended to attack Yang Xiao. Since he was going to attack Yang Xiao, they were naturally not in such a hurry to attack him anymore. Because even they wanted to see if Yang Ye really had no profound energy left.

Yang Xiao’s expression changed when he saw Yang Ye start walking in his direction. Even though he felt that Yang Ye’s strength was completely spent, he thought just like Ying Wu and the others, and he didn’t dare to guarantee that Yang Ye’s profound energy had really dried up.

He was similarly worried that Yang Ye had the strength to activate that sword formation once more!

Yang Lianshuang didn’t stop attacking. He waved her hand, and numerous bolts of black lightning shot towards Yang Xiao like venomous serpents.

At this moment, Yang Xiao became quite anxious.

He didn’t just have to resist Yang Lianshuang’s fierce assault, he had to be on guard against Yang Ye. It wouldn’t be so bad if Yang Ye just attacked, but Yang Ye didn’t, and he was just walking slowly in Yang Xiao’s direction!

This forced Yang Xiao to divide a huge amount of his attention to take precautions against Yang Ye.

Ying Wu and the others stared at Yang Ye and were waiting for Yang Ye to attack. If Yang Ye utilized the sword formation, they would retreat without the slightest hesitation; and if Yang Ye just executed an ordinary sword technique, they would charge forward without the slightest hesitation!

Just like that, Ying Wu and the others watched as Yang Ye stopped just 30m away from the battlefield between Yang Xiao and Yang Lianshuang.

After he stopped there, he took a deep breath and placed his left hand on the Sword Chest.

Ying Wu and the others’ hearts shook at the sight of this, and their profound energy surged madly. They were prepared to retreat at any moment.

Meanwhile, Yang Xiao’s expression changed drastically. Because he’d focused too much of his attention on Yang Ye, he was gradually being suppressed by Yang Lianshuang. Especially right now. He’d been distracted for a moment, and it caused him to be pushed over 1km back!

Moreover, a bloody injury had appeared on his chest!

However, he paid no attention to Yang Lianshuang. Practically 70% of his attention was on Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye slowly tapped the Sword Chest while everyone watched him.

Om!

The Sword Chest shook violently, and a sword howl resounded.

The expressions of everyone here changed drastically!

However, besides the sword howl, nothing else happened!

Suddenly, Yang Ye gazed at Ying Wu’s group, “Actually, he’s right. I really don’t have any profound energy.”

Pu!

A mouthful of blood sprayed from Ying Wu’s mouth.

After that, Ying Wu and the others didn’t hesitate to charge at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye immediately issued a command in his heart when he saw them charge at him. In an instant, six black swords shot out from the Sword Chest while Yang Ye simultaneously charged at Ying Wu’s group while holding the Sword Precursor in his grasp!

Even though he couldn’t activate the sword formation again, it didn’t represent that he didn’t have the strength to fight.

One against five!

Yang Ye was fighting five opponents, and he wasn’t at a disadvantage at all.

Ying Wu and the others were heavily injured from the sword formation, so their combat strengths were only comparable to ordinary True Realm experts at most. As for Yang Ye, besides overusing his profound energy, he wasn’t injured at all. So, he could fight all five of them on his own.

His focus was split into seven!

The six swords were like six of his arms, and while they weren’t able to kill any of his opponents, they were able to keep Ying Wu’s group busy. So, it prevented them from ganging up on him!

Even though he was able to keep them busy, the current situation was extremely disadvantageous to Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang. Because Yang Lianshuang’s forces were being completely suppressed once Yang Xiao’s side were assisted by the experts of the Ku Clan. Moreover, based on the current situation, Yang Lianshuang’s forces were on the verge of being annihilated!

As for Qiong Qi, he was keeping five 3rd stage True Realm experts busy on his own, and he was merely able to resist them!

Yang Lianshuang was obviously aware that she couldn’t delay any longer. So, once she repulsed Yang Xiao, she didn’t attack again.

“What?” Yang Xiao laughed fiercely, “You’re not going to attack anymore?”

She glanced at Yang Xiao, and then slowly closed her eyes. As soon as her eyes were shut, a fine bolt of lightning appeared on the center of her forehead, and it didn’t take long for countless arcs of lightning to flicker all around her.

A moment later, these arcs of black lightning stretched out in front of her. They moved extremely swiftly, and there were a huge number of them. In just an instant, an area of almost 1km before her was covered in bolts of lightning.

Yang Xiao had an extremely solemn expression on his face when he witnessed this!

He knew that it was time to get serious!

Yang Xiao took a step forward, and then he stretched his hands out. After that, he clenched them, and then space in an area of 1km around him instantly started bubbling rapidly like boiling water.

In an instant, countless energy fists flashed out from the expanse of bubbling space, and there were a few thousand of them!

“Smash!” Yang Xiao’s voice resounded, and then he slammed his fists forward.

The energy fists instantly rained down towards Yang Lianshuang like a storm.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

As soon as the energy fists came into contact with the bolts of lightning, explosions rumbled incessantly through the sky above Phecda City. At the same time, the entire city shook violently.

The heavens and the earth seemed like they were collapsing!

Around ten breaths of time later, Phecda City gradually calmed down.

However, most of its buildings had vanished, and those that hadn’t vanished had been reduced to ruins!

Yang Lianshuang and Yang Xiao stood facing each other, and they were less than 300m away from each other.

Yang Xiao was in quite a miserable state. His countenance was ghastly pale, and his body was covered in burn marks. Moreover, weak arcs of lightning were still flickering throughout his body.

As for Yang Lianshuang, besides a slightly pale countenance, there were no other injuries on her.

Obviously, she’d won the last collision.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief. If Yang Lianshuang lost, then the situation would be quite bad, and it would affect his plans!

Yang Xiao stared at Yang Lianshuang, “I didn’t expect you to have grown to such an extent! I should have killed you all those years ago!”

A cold smile curled up on the corners of Yang Lianshuang’s lips, “Unfortunately, it’s too late.” She gazed at the others behind Yang Xiao and continued, “You’re all members of the Yang Clan. I can let bygones be bygones if you realize your mistakes right now; if you insist on being stubborn, then don’t blame me for not giving consideration to the fact that we’re linked by blood!”

The people behind Yang Xiao remained silent.

They hadn’t expected Yang Xiao to lose to her!

To surrender or not to surrender?

If they surrendered, then based on their knowledge of her character, Yang Lianshuang would definitely do as she said!

Suddenly, Yang Xiao chuckled.

Everyone gazed at Yang Xiao. But Yang Xiao gazed at Yang Ye instead. He laughed as he said, “Yang Ye, I have good news for you. My people have arrived at Merak System. Hahaha!”

Meanwhile, Ying Wu slammed his fist at Yang Ye’s chest. However, right when everyone thought Yang Ye would defend himself, Yang Ye suddenly turned around and allowed Ying Wu’s fist to strike his back.

Bang!

A muffled bang resounded, and then Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot. At the same time, Yang Xiao’s expression changed drastically, and he slammed his fist forward.

As soon as his fist shot forward, a sword stabbed against it.

A moment later, the sword pierced through Yang Xiao’s fist. Yang Xiao’s expression changed drastically, and he was about to flee, but it was too late.

A sword was pressed against Yang Xiao’s throat!

The surroundings fell silent!

No one had expected Yang Ye to not defend himself against Ying Wu’s punch and willingly suffer that blow in order to rely on the force of it to attack Yang Ye!

It had exceeded everyone’s expectations!

Yang Ye looked Yang Xiao in the eyes, “Tell them to come back!”

“Come back?” Yang Xiao laughed ferociously, “It’s too late. The order I gave them was to spare no one in Merak System!”

Yang Ye’s eyes instantly turned blood red, “Have you been to hell? If you haven’t, I can give you a taste right now!”
