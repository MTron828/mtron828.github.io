Chapter 1927 – Let Him Go! Right Now!

“Is that so?” Gu He suddenly started laughing, “Perhaps what you’ve said is true, but trust me, your mouth will be split from your head before that happens.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took a step forward, and then he appeared in front of Yang Ye. He clenched his right fist, raised it, and smashed it down at Yang Ye like a hammer!

Close quarter combat!

It was exactly what Yang Ye wanted.

Yang Ye didn’t dodge and just allowed the fist to descend towards his head while his fist shot towards Gu He’s throat.

If they didn’t stop their attacks, there would only be one outcome, both of them would be injured or die on the spot!

Gu He’s expression changed when he saw that Yang Ye wasn’t dodging. He hadn’t expected it. He naturally wouldn’t exchange his life for Yang Ye’s life, so he changed the trajectory of his fist to slam against Yang Ye’s fist!

Bang!

As soon as they collided, the space around them cracked apart, and then they were pushed back repeatedly. However, it only took a moment for Yang Ye to stop himself, and then he appeared before Gu He and slammed his fist at Gu He!

Gu He’s expression changed drastically. He hadn’t expected that Yang Ye would actually be able to counterattack in such a short while! While he was shocked, his reaction wasn’t slow at all. He immediately raised his right leg and stopped himself before slamming a punch at Yang Ye!

He didn’t choose to dodge and instead chose to go head-on against Yang Ye!

Just like that, their fists slammed against each other in the most direct manner!

Bam!

Their fists immediately separated upon colliding against each other!

But it only took a moment for Yang Ye to appear in front of Gu He again, and then he slammed his fist at Gu He again…

Just like that, Yang Ye launched punch after punch.

In the beginning, Gu He was still able to resist Yang Ye’s punches, but after around 100 breaths of time passed, Gu He started being pushed back repeatedly.

He was suppressed!

He was being completely suppressed by Yang Ye!

Yang Ye had his sword in his left grasp, but he never drew it. He’d been using just one hand from the beginning. As for Gu He, he’d similarly been using a single hand in the beginning, but as time passed, he’d started to use his other hand.

However, he was still completely suppressed!

He was being pushed back repeatedly, and he’d been pushed almost 10km back now.

Li Jiang and his sister were flabbergasted by this scene. They hadn’t expected Yang Ye to be that strong!

As for Li Wu, there was a trace of surprise in her eyes. Obviously, even she was shocked by how powerful Yang Ye’s body was when he was just a human.

Gu Bang, on the other hand, had quite a gloomy expression on his face.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly stopped.

It’s over?

Yang Ye glanced at Gu He and Gu Bang, and he said, “It’s quite boring to let this continue. Let’s just forget this happened.” They were members of Xiao Qi’s race, so while it was alright to teach them a lesson, it wasn’t necessary to be too ruthless.

“Forget it?” Suddenly, Gu He spoke ferociously, “Lowly human, you think we can just forget this? You…”

Suddenly, a ray of sword energy flashed.

At the moment it appeared, Gu He’s expression changed drastically, and he instinctively slammed his fist forward.

However, his fist didn’t hit another fist this time, it struck a sword, an extremely sharp sword!

Hiss!

Gu He’s arm was instantly sliced into two, and blood sprayed!

But that wasn’t the end, Yang Ye’s sword continued forward and stabbed against Gu He’s forehead, causing the latter’s figure to stiffen on the spot.

He wasn’t dead because Yang Ye’s sword had merely gone half an inch deep!

The surroundings fell silent!

Gu He stared at Yang Ye. His fists were clenched tight, but he didn’t dare to move.

Yang Ye suddenly removed his sword and slapped Gu He’s right cheek with it, “Come on, tell me how we should deal with this?”

Meanwhile, Gu Bang suddenly said, “You’re strong. My brother lost the battle. However, it’s just a spar, so please don’t harm him. Otherwise, all of you may not be able to leave this ocean. After all, this ocean is huge, and it’s normal to get lost!”

Suddenly, Yang Ye slapped Gu He’s face with his sword again, causing a blood red mark to appear on Gu He’s face. However, Gu He didn’t move an inch because Yang Ye’s sword was pressed close to his face. So long as he dared to move, he didn’t doubt that sword would take away half his head!

Gu Bang’s face instantly turned gloomy, and the calm and composed smile he previously had was gone.

Yang Ye suddenly gazed at Gu Bang and smiled, “Compared to your brainless and arrogant younger brother, I hate you more. You clearly came looking for trouble on purpose, so why put on an act? Besides that, are you threatening me?”

As he spoke, he placed his sword against Gu He’s throat and said, “Come on! Threaten me again!”

Gu Bang stared at Yang Ye but didn’t dare to say a word.

“Kill him and you’ll never leave this ocean!” Suddenly, a voice resounded, and then a middle aged man appeared not too far away from Yang Ye.

Gu Nie!

Meanwhile, Yin Hou appeared by Yang Ye’s side.

Yang Ye turned to look at her, and she shook her head slightly. Obviously, she didn’t want it to get out of hand.

Yang Ye shrugged and was about to remove his sword. However, Gu He suddenly laughed fiercely, “Human, I’ll remember you.”

“Oh?” Yang Ye smiled, “What are you planning?”

Gu He spoke fiercely, “You lowly human, you…”

Slap!

Suddenly, Yang Ye slapped Gu He with his sword, causing Gu He’s voice to stop abruptly!

Everyone here was stunned by this!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly smiled, “I think that we can’t just let this go like this.” As he spoke, he patted Gu He’s swollen face lightly with his sword and continued, “I’m in an alright mood today, so let’s just do this. Apologize and I’ll forget this ever happened.”

“Human!” Suddenly, Gu Nie said, “I’ll repeat myself one more time. Let him go! Right now!”

Gu He gazed at Yang Ye and seemed slightly insane, “Apologize? You want me to apologize to a lowly human? Dream on!”

The smile on Yang Ye’s face gradually vanished, “I’m in a bad mood now.”

“Kill me!” Gu He laughed with fury, “Come on! Do you dare? You…”

Suddenly, a ray of light flashed through his throat, and his voice stopped abruptly.

Hiss!

A bloody head flew up into the air. It’s eyes were opened wide, and they were filled with disbelief.

Yang Ye had really killed him!

He hadn’t expected the human before him to dare to kill him!

That was the last thing Gu He thought about.

Li Jiang and the others were stunned, even Yin Hou was stunned. None of them had expected that Yang Ye would really kill him.

Yang Ye had killed him!

Yang Ye shrugged and said, “I’m sure you heard that he asked me to kill him. Sigh, I’ve killed people for years, but it’s the first time someone has begged me to kill him!”

Bang!

A powerful aura slammed down in Yang Ye’s direction.

Gu Nie was attacking!

However, Yin Hou didn’t stand by idly. She waved her right hand, and a cold aura swept out and dispersed Gu Nie’s aura.

Gu Nia gazed at Yin Hou, “You intend to protect him?”

Yin Hou was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly started laughing, and everyone gazed at him.

Yang Ye gazed at Gu Nie, and there was no fear in his eyes, “What? You can’t accept defeat?”

Can’t accept defeat!

Gu Nie’s face became quite unsightly.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “So this is what the sky race is like. The young seek a spar from others, yet they are too weak and get killed, so the seniors come for revenge. Tsk, tsk. What an embarrassment! What a fucking embarrassment!”

Gu Nie spoke gloomily, “You were just having a spar. Since it’s a spar, why did you kill him?”

Yang Ye looked Gu Nie in the eyes, “You can’t kill in a spar?”

Gu Nie spoke coldly, “You’re very good at killing?”

Yang Ye looked Gu Nie in the eye without showing a hint of fear, “I once got tired of killing!”

The atmosphere here instantly became tense.

Gu Nie clenched his fists, and a gloomy expression covered his face. No one knew what he was thinking.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “I know that with the status you possess, you definitely will feel ashamed if you act against me. However, you definitely won’t want to give up on taking revenge. So, how about we do this? Let anyone from the younger generation of the Endless Ocean fight me in single combat until one side dies. Alright?”

One on one battles!

Yin Hou glanced at Yang Ye and didn’t say anything.

Gu Nie stared at Yang Ye. Gu Bang was about to step forward, but Gu Nie shot a glance at him, and then Gu Bang hesitated for a moment before stepping back.

Meanwhile, Gu Nie turned to look at Yang Ye, “You’re a human?”

Yang Ye replied, “What?”

Gu Nie smiled, “It’s nothing. You said that I would be embarrassed to act against you. Indeed, how could I do something like bullying the young? However, I’ve taken a liking to you, so I’d like to provide you with some guidance. That’s not a problem, right?” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Yin Hou’s face instantly became gloomy. Gu Nie was trying to bully Yang Ye indirectly!

Yang Ye looked Gu Nie in the eyes, and two breaths of time passed before he asked, “I wonder how many children you have!”

“Two!” Gu Nie smiled, “Why?”

Yang Ye suddenly pointed his sword at Gu Bang, “Before you provide me with guidance, allow me to provide some guidance to your son. Right, let me give you a kind reminder. I’ve provided guidance to many in the past, but all of them might have transformed into dirt by now!”
