Yang Ye frowned, “Where is she?”

The black robed man replied, “The East Region!”

The East Region!

Yang Ye walked over to the black robed man, “Give me an exact location!”

The latter flicked a ray of white light into Yang Ye’s forehead.

A short while later, Yang Ye left the Ancient Sword Sect.

In the clouds above the Ancient Sword Sect, Nether Maiden and the others appeared by his side.

The pig-riding woman was about to speak when Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “The Ancient Sword Sect needs all of you. I’ll go to her myself. I guarantee that I’ll bring her back in one piece, alright?”

Nether Maiden and the others exchanged glances, and then the pig-riding woman nodded, “Bring her back!”

Yang Ye Nodded and vanished on the spot.

The three of them remained there for a long time after he left.

…

At a mountain range, a black robed man was down on one knee before the Soul Sect’s Exalt within a pitch black hall.

The Soul Exalt asked, “Are you sure that he left?”

The black robed man nodded, “Yes, and he should be heading toward the East Region!”

The Soul Exalt nodded, “You can leave!”

The black robed man turned around and left.

The Soul Exalt fell silent for a long time, and then he tapped the wooden table beside him.

A short while later, two pitch black balls of energy appeared before him.

He closed his eyes slowly and said, “Don’t underestimate him.”

The balls of energy didn’t offer any response and just vanished.

The Soul Exalt looked up into the distance and spoke indifferently, “Since you’re courting death, you can blame no one but yourself!”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking!

The East Region.

At an ancient city, a woman sat at a corner with a small fox in her arms. There was an extremely deep sword injury on the fox’s leg, and it was bleeding.

The woman’s body had many injuries too, and they were bleeding as well!

A middle aged man was standing not too far away from her, and he was holding a sword!

The Lord Realm!

There were three other old men behind him!

All three of the old men were quite strong. They were Five World Realm experts!

The middle aged sword cultivator gazed at the woman with a trace of solemness and fear, “Who are you?!”

She remained silent and just carefully used a white silk handkerchief to wipe the fox’s injuries.

The middle aged sword cultivator frowned, “Not only did you fail to notify my Lu Clan of your arrival in our territory, you killed a young master of ours. Isn’t that a little too much?”

She glanced at him and said, “He deserved death, so I killed him.”

The sword cultivator’s eyes narrowed slightly, and a wisp of icy coldness flashed through them, “I think you deserve death too, so I’m sorry.”

As soon as he said that, his sword left his grasp, and then an arc of sword energy arrived before her.

She placed the fox by her side and raised her right hand slightly, and then the sword energy actually started to be obliterated!

Moreover, the middle aged sword cultivator’s sword was actually starting to be obliterated as well!

A wisp of gloomy coldness flashed through his eyes, and then a powerful wave of sword intent rippled out of him. An instant later, a myriad of energy swords rained down like a storm upon her.

The woman gazed coldly at the storm of swords with indifference on her face, and she suddenly spoke when they arrived right above her, “Obliterate!”

At this moment, everything seemed to have frozen!

The sword cultivator and the others watched with shock as the sword energy was actually obliterated, and even the space around her was starting to be obliterated. It was like everything was withering before her!

The sword cultivator’s solemness had transformed into fear, but it didn’t take long for ghastly killing intent to fill his eyes instead!

Suddenly, he vanished on the spot.

A moment later, a few rays of sword energy shot at her from a tricky angle.

While the middle aged sword cultivator feared her powerful ability, it was the Lu Clan’s territory!

As soon as he attacked, the old men behind him attacked as well. Moreover, a Lord Realm old man joined the battle as well.

He was naturally a Lord Realm expert of the Lu Clan!

Two Lord Realm experts and two Five World Realm experts! She was instantly completely suppressed.

While the woman’s strange power was formidable, she couldn’t hold her own against so many opponents.

Hiss!

Suddenly, the middle aged sword cultivator’s right hand and the sword it held were transformed into a pile of dust. The sword cultivator was shocked and shot backward. Right at the same instant, the other Lord Realm expert’s palm slapped against the woman’s back, and the powerful wave of impact blasted her away.

The woman’s face remained indifferent as she held tightly to the fox!

Bang!

In the end, she slammed against the wall, causing a huge hole to be blasted open on it.

She fell to the ground outside the wall, and blood seeped out incessantly from the corner of her mouth. However, the fox in her arms wasn’t harmed at all. It anxiously gazed at her while tears seeped out of its eyes.

She grinned at the fox, but her smile was quite horrifying. She rubbed its head gently and looked off into the distance. At this moment, the sword cultivator and the others were walking in her direction, and another Lord Realm expert had joined their group!

Obviously, this incident had alarmed the higher-ups of the Lu Clan!

The sword cultivator gazed coldly at her and the fox, “You possess such strength at your age, so you’re definitely not an ordinary person. Which clan are you from?!”

She remained silent.

The sword cultivator was about to speak when the Lord Realm old man suddenly said, “There’s no need to say anything. She killed someone from our clan, so she deserves death. As for the power that stands behind her… Hmph! While our Lu Clan isn’t the strongest in Eternal Kingdom, when have we ever feared anyone?”

The sword cultivator nodded slightly and issued a command in his heart. The sword in his left grasp immediately shot at the woman and the fox.

She watched coldly as the sword approached, but she didn’t just wait for death to arrive. She was about to act when two powerful Lord Realm auras slammed down upon her like two huge mountains.

These auras caused a momentary pause in her actions, and just that moment had allowed the sword to pierce through her chest!

Hiss!

Blood sprayed!

Her figure stiffened on the spot!

Once the sword pierced through her, it shot back at her head!

Obviously, they planned to annihilate her!

Right when the sword was just half an inch away from her head, the sword suddenly stopped as if it had been obstructed by something!

The middle aged sword cultivator and the others frowned from the sight of this.

A short while later, the middle aged man noticed that it was a sword which had stopped his flying sword!

A translucent sword!

The sword cultivator looked up to the sky, and a ray of sword energy flashed. A moment later, a man in green clothes appeared before them.

The sword cultivator glanced at the man, “Your help is here?”

Yang Ye didn’t say anything. He walked over to the woman. She wasn’t dead, but she was on the verge of it.

She glared at him, “W-Why did you come… come so late?!”

A strand of blood seeped out from the corner of her mouth as she spoke.

Yang Ye was about to speak when she suddenly raised the fox toward him, “H-Help me take care of it!”

Yang Ye glanced at the fox and said, “I noticed that you won’t be dying today, so you can just take care of it yourself!”

She was none other than Oblivion Maiden!

Yang Ye had quite a deep impression of her because she’d hunted him through many regions!

Yang Ye didn’t say more and just sent her into the Primordial Pagoda, but she refused!

Yang Ye gazed at her with bewilderment, “Huh?”

She glanced at the middle aged sword cultivator’s group and said, “T-They hurt my fox. Aren’t you going to do something about it?”

Yang Ye glanced at the blood that covered her, and for some reason, he was inwardly moved. He grinned and said, “Just go inside and heal up, right? Leave the rest to me!”

Oblivion Maiden glanced at him and nodded.

Yang Ye sent her and the fox into the pagoda. With the Primordial Violet Energy in there, their wounds would heal rapidly.

Outside the pagoda, Yang Ye gazed at the sword cultivator before him, and the latter sized up Yang Ye, “You think that you can take her out of here?”

Yang Ye walked slowly in their direction and said, “She’s a friend of mine!”

“And?” The sword cultivator chuckled, “Are you trying to say that we have to pay a terrible price?”

Yang Ye looked the sword cultivator in the eyes, “I don’t know what happened, nor do I want to know. All I do know is that you tried to kill her and almost succeeded.”

The sword cultivator smiled, “I don’t want to waste my breath on you. Both of you are going to die today!”

His sword suddenly shot at Yang Ye.

But it only took a moment for the sword to be blasted away by another sword!

The sword cultivator’s pupils constricted at the sight of this, “You…”

Suddenly, a wave of mysterious energy appeared here.

The Sword Domain!

As soon as it appeared, two flying swords flashed!

They were absolutely swift!

The sword cultivator hadn’t even been able to react before they flashed through his throat!

Hiss!

His head flew up into the air!

However, he wasn’t dead because his soul had escaped his body at the last moment!

The sword cultivator gazed at Yang Ye with shock in his eyes, “Y-You’re Yang Ye!”

At this moment, he’d recognized Yang Ye!

The other experts of the Lu Clan were shocked as well, and they gazed at Yang Ye with shock in their eyes!

Suddenly, a white-haired old man appeared before Yang Ye.

The old man glanced coldly at Yang Ye, “This is the Lu Clan, not the Ancient Sword Sect!”

Yang Ye walked toward the old man, “I don’t give a fuck! If you touch someone on my side, it’s like touching me. If you do that, there are only two outcomes. Either I die, or you die!”
