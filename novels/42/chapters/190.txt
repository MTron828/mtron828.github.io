Chapter 191 – An Idiot?

All of them were clearly independent cultivators or disciples of the clans because they weren’t wearing the uniform of the six great powers!

They quickly arrived by the sides of the three brothers and sisters from the Li Clan, and then the man with long eyebrows who was in the lead of the group glanced at Yang Ye before he waved his right hand. The group of over 10 behind him immediately withdrew their weapons and surrounded the four Shadowhunter Leopards. With the sudden addition of these people, the entire situation of the battle had been instantly turned around, and the four Shadowhunter Leopards were attacked to the point they were steadily losing ground!

“Thank you for rescuing our lives, Brother!” The blue robed young man whose hands weren’t full anymore immediately cupped his fist to the man with long eyebrows, and he spoke gratefully.

The man smiled and said, “As humans, how could we do nothing to rescue the three of you?” When he spoke up to here, the man with long eyebrows paused for a moment, and then he looked at Yang Ye and said, “Brother, you hold a sword. Are you a disciple of the Sword Sect?”

Yang Ye shook his head, and then he looked at the others who were fighting the four Darkbeasts and said, “You can ask them to stop.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The man’s brows knit together when he heard this, and he said, “Brother, what do you mean?”

Right at this moment, the blue robed man glanced resentfully at Yang Ye, and then he spoke to the man with long eyebrows in a low voice. It was unknown what he’s told the man, but the man’s eyelids twitched, and then he gazed at Yang Ye while a wisp of excitement and happiness flashed in the depths of his eyes. He said, “Earlier, I noticed that these animals didn’t attack you. I presume that you possess some sort of secret technique that instills fear in them?”

Yang Ye glanced at him and said indifferently, “Indeed, but you can’t utilize it, so don’t try to obtain it. I’ll say it one more time, ask your companions to stop!”

These Shadowhunter Leopards had pursued those three members of the Li Clan under the violet mink’s orders. In other words, they could be considered as the little fellow’s subordinates. So, it was naturally impossible for the little fellow to just watch as his subordinates were killed by humans.

The man’s brows raised when he heard Yang Ye, and then a strand of cold light flashed in his eyes as he said, “You ought to be clearly aware of the assignment we have in Ascension Mountain Range. There are four King Rank Inner Cores right before us. Even if I’m willing to give up on them, these friends of mine wouldn’t be. Of course, if you’re willing to join us, then I can make the decision to give one of these four Inner Cores to you!”

Yang Ye shook his head and stopped wasting his breath because one of the Shadowhunter Leopards had been injured! His figure flashed, and he left a string of afterimages behind as he flashed towards the battlefield.

However, right when Yang Ye moved, the man with long eyebrows seemed to have expected this, and his figure moved to obstruct Yang Ye’s path. Moreover, his speed was so swift that it was even superior to Yang Ye!

Yang Ye grunted coldly when he saw the man block his path, and he drew his sword and stabbed without the slightest hesitation!

At the instant Yang Ye drew his sword, the man’s pupils constricted while astonishment arose in his heart. He wanted to dodge but it was already too late!

Bang!

His sword stabbed right onto the man’s chest. However, Yang Ye frowned because Violet Spirit had actually been obstructed by something. Right at this instant, the man seized the opportunity to flash over 30m away, and he gazed at Yang Ye as he said with shock, “You’re a disciple of the Sword Sect!”

The blue robed young man at the side was astounded. He’d never imagined that Yang Ye’s strength was actually so formidable to the point that even this man with long eyebrows who possessed a strength that far surpassed his own would be unable to dodge Yang Ye’s sword.... Coupled with what the man with long eyebrows said, the blue robed young man’s heart jerked. Earlier, he’d guessed that Yang Ye was a disciple of the Sword Sect, and now, he was practically sure of it!

When he thought up to here, the blue robed young man had the intention to retreat....

Yang Ye felt slightly helpless when he heard the man. Could it be that all those who use the sword are disciples of the Sword Sect?

Yang Ye didn’t answer the man with long eyebrows, and his figure flashed once more. He didn’t charge towards the battlefield but to the man with long eyebrows instead. Because he had to save the four Shadowhunter Leopards. As for the fact that one side was human and the other was beast, he didn’t care!

In his opinion, humans were even more terrifying than Darkbeasts sometimes, and they deserved death more!

When he saw Yang Ye attack once more, the man was astounded, and he immediately shouted loudly. “Please stay your hand. We won’t attack those four Shadowhunter Leopards anymore!”

Yang Ye stopped when he heard this, and then he looked towards the side. Sure enough, the group of over 10 had stopped attacking those four Shadowhunter Leopards. Even though they’d stopped attacking the Shadowhunter Leopards, their gazes towards him were extremely cold!

It wasn’t just them, even the siblings from the Li Clan and the man with long eyebrows gazes at Yang Ye with an extremely cold gaze. Even though no large scale battles had erupted between humans and Darkbeasts, the two races could be said to be extremely hostile against each other. However, as a human and a disciple of the Sword Sect, Yang Ye had actually stood on the side of the Darkbeasts....

As if he knew what they were thinking, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Their Inner Cores belong to me!”

Even though he didn’t dare about their thoughts, he didn’t want others to think that he was on the side of Darkbeasts. Because while he really was on their side, it couldn’t be exposed because the implications were too severe.

The consequence of even the slightest mistake might not end with just the humans looking for trouble with him, even the Darkbeast Empire would send experts after him....

Sure enough, the coldness in their hearts faded slightly when they heard Yang Ye. So long as he hadn’t betrayed the human race, then they wouldn’t be hostile towards him.

“On what basis do you ask for their Inner Cores?” Meanwhile, a man from amongst the group suddenly spoke coldly. “Because you’re a disciple of the Sword Sect? Even if you’re a disciple of the Sword Sect, we have so many in our group while you’re all alone. Do you think you can defeat us?”

“Want to give it a try?” Yang Ye gazed at this man and spoke indifferently.

Most of these people before him were independent cultivators. Even though their strengths were really not bad, it was far from sufficient to him. Because these people would probably not even be able to break through his physical defense. Coupled with the four Shadowhunter Leopards at the side, he was confident that if they made a move against him, then he would be able to annihilate all of them!

There was usually no right and wrong in the world. He wouldn’t say that they were wrong, but he had to protect these Darkbeasts. So, if he had to enter into battle with them because of this, then he wouldn’t hesitate to strike with lethal force.

When they heard him, all of them revealed furious expressions, and right when some of them were about to flare up, they were stopped by the man with long eyebrows. After that, he looked at Yang Ye. Indeed, this disciple of the Sword Sect wasn’t a match for their entire group. But the problem was that he was a disciple of the Sword Sect! Moreover, there were 10 disciples from the Sword Sect who were participating in the Ascension Rankings. If he gathered a group of them, then killing their group would be as easy as flipping his hand!

In short, it wasn’t worth it to form enmity with a disciple of the Sword Sect for the sake of four Inner Cores!

When he thought up to here, the man with long eyebrows took a deep breath, and then he stopped hesitating and said, “Let’s go!”

The blue robed young man wanted to say something, but the man with long eyebrows shot a penetrating glance at him, causing him to instantly swallow the words he was about to speak.

Even though they were unwilling, they understood the principle that it wasn’t worth it to offend a disciple of the Sword Sect for four Inner Cores.

“Wait!” Right when they were about to leave, Yang Ye suddenly spoke.

All of them stopped when they heard this, and the man with long eyebrows gazed at Yang Ye while killing intent flashed in his eyes. He said, “What?”

If Yang Ye went too far, then he wouldn’t hesitate to kill a disciple of the Sword Sect. Even though it meant that he would probably face a huge amount of trouble in the future, it was better than allowing someone to trample all over him!

Yang Ye disregarded their furious expression, and he pointed at the siblings from the Li Clan and said, “All of you can leave, but they must stay behind!”

He was a person that held grudges until the end. These three had drawn the Shadowhunter Leopards towards him just now with the intention of making him die in their place. So, how could he possibly forget this?

When they heard this, the expressions of those three siblings changed. They’d witnessed Yang Ye’s strength earlier and coupled with the fact that Yang Ye was a disciple of the Sword Sect, then with their strengths, staying behind would absolutely equal to death!

When he thought up to here, the blue robed young man looked at the man with long eyebrows and said, “Brother, I’m the young master of one of the four great clans of the Imperial Capital, the Li Clan’s Li Nan. These two by my side are my cousin sister and cousin brother. Li Nan is extremely grateful for the kindness you showed us earlier, and my Li Clan will definitely reward you greatly once we leave the Grand Myriad Mountains!”

When he spoke up to here, he hesitated for a moment before he flipped his wrist, and a scroll appeared in his hand. He passed it to the man with long eyebrows and said, “This is a combat technique of my Li Clan, and it’s a high-grade Profound Rank technique. This is for you, just take it as our gratitude for rescuing us earlier. Li Nan guarantees that you’ll definitely be heavily rewarded again once we leave the Grand Myriad Mountains!”

The man’s eyelids twitched when he heard the blue robed young man, and he hesitated for a short moment before he took the scroll in the end. He was unable to refuse the temptation of a high-grade Profound Rank technique. After all, the best technique he possessed was a high-grade Profound Rank technique, and it was only a movement technique and not a combat technique!

The siblings from the Li Clan instantly heaved sighs of relief when they saw the man with long eyebrows accept the scroll.

With this group of over 10 by our side, so what if you’re from the Sword Sect? Could it be that you can defy the heavens? When he thought up to here, the blue robed man glanced provocatively at Yang Ye!

Yang Ye smiled when he saw their actions, and then he looked at the man with long eyebrows and said, “Looks like you intend to protect them?”

The man replied in a low voice. “We’re all humans. I wonder if Brother can give me some face and let them go?” If it was possible, he didn’t want to offend a disciple of the Sword Sect!

When he heard this, Yang Ye said, “What if I can’t?”

What a joke! Let them go?

When it came to his enemies, Yang Ye had always pursued the policy of extermination!

The man’s face instantly sank when he heard Yang Ye, and then he paid no further attention to Yang Ye as he turned around and started to leave. The others by his side hurriedly followed him.

On the other hand, the blue robed young man shot another provocative glance at Yang Ye....
