Chapter 2262 – Intent Ignition!

It was daytime, but the sky above Void Spirit Continent was dark.

Once the energy appeared there, the entire continent collapsed in just a short while and was transformed into dust.

Tian Xiu didn’t stop it from collapsing.

The members of the void spirit race weren’t on Void Spirit Continent anymore, so its existence didn’t make a difference to her.

It didn’t take long for a middle aged man in a black robe to suddenly appear in front of Xiao Lou.

The middle aged man wore a mask, and he kept his left hand behind his back while his right held a scroll.

The experts of the undying race bowed respectfully to him, “Patriarch!”

The patriarch of the undying race!

The middle aged man with the scroll was the patriarch of the undying race—Feng Yihan!

It sounded like the name of a scholar, but only people who knew him were aware of how terrifying he was!

Feng Yihan sized up Tian Xiu and spoke softly, “Void Spirit Maiden, long time no see!”

Tian Xiu appeared before him, sized him up, and said, “Looks like you’ve been recovering well.”

Feng Yihan replied, “Almost 90%!”

Tian Xiu nodded slightly, “Then let’s put an end to the enmity between us today!”

Feng Yihan fell silent for a moment and nodded, “Alright!”

Peace?

It did not exist.

The enmity between them was one of annihilation, and it was an enmity that was absolutely irreconcilable. Unless one side was exterminated!

Feng Yihan gazed at Xiao Lou, and the latter nodded slightly before leading the army at the spirits of the void spirit race.

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu flipped her right hand, and a pearl appeared there. A moment later, she tapped it, and it entered the army of spirits. In an instant, their auras rose explosively.

“The initial race!” Feng Yihan spoke softly before Tian Xiu, “I didn’t expect you to be able to obtain that from the initial race. But it does make sense. You’re all alone now and have nothing to worry about, so the initial race has no choice but to make a compromise!”

Tian Xiu didn’t say a word but Netherworld Destiny slowly emerged from her forehead. It only took a moment for it to appear in her grasp.

She looked up at Feng Yihan and was about to attack when she suddenly frowned slightly. She looked to the right, and she saw a ray of sword energy and a ray of fiery light shooting in her direction.

Tian Xiu’s face fell.

It only took a while for Yang Ye and An Nanjing to appear before her.

Yang Ye was about to speak when Tian Xiu spoke coldly, “What are you doing here? To give your life away? And you’re even leading your wife to her death too?”

Yang Ye replied, “I told you that I would be back!”

She closed her eyes slowly, “It’s meaningless!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I can’t let you shoulder this burden on your own.”

She opened her eyes and gazed at him, “It is my void spirit race’s business, so it’s my business and should be shouldered by me. I…”

Yang Ye waved his hand and interrupted her, “I’m already here, so it’s pointless to say all of that, isn’t it?”

She gazed at him for a long time, and then she suddenly started smiling.

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why are you smiling?”

Tian Xiu walked over to Yang Ye, floated up slowly, and then patted him on the shoulder, “I’m very happy to have been able to get to know you and Snowy after waking up. It’s both of you who gave me joy for some time. Just as you’ve said, there’s nothing for me to say since you’re here already.

She gazed at the battlefield below and said, “Help me kill Xiao Lou!”

Yang Ye was stunned, and so was An Nanjing.

Kill Xiao Lou!

Xiao Lou was an expert on Yang Wudi’s level, and his strength could be said to be the strongest below the Unfettered One, Tian Xiu, and the patriarch of the undying race! Even the Martial Emperor and Yang Wudi wouldn’t dare to say that they could kill Xiao Lou!

But Tian Xiu wanted Yang Ye to kill Xiao Lou!

“She’s doing it for your own good!” Suddenly, Feng Yihan said, “If you kill him, you’re very likely to make a breakthrough and take a step forward. Of course, there’s also another outcome, and it’s death. So, do you want to try?”

Tian Xiu looked Yang Ye in the eyes and said, “Since you’re here, you have no other choice. Kill him and take a step forward, only then can you leave with your life. Otherwise, even I can’t keep you safe.”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “Tian Xiu, what are you saying?”

She shook her head slightly, “Just do as I say. I won’t harm you.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and nodded, “Alright!”

Yang Ye’s figure transformed into a ray of light that shot at Xiao Lou.

An Nanjing was about to follow him, but Tian Xiu stopped her.

Tian Xiu pointed at 30 mysterious figures with bows on their backs.

Tian Xiu said, “They are your opponents!”

An Nanjing spoke solemnly, “I want to help him!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Tian Xiu spoke softly, “Going to him will only harm him. He must achieve a breakthrough, otherwise, all of you will die. All the others who went to the universe of the initial race will die too.”

An Nanjing fell silent for a long time, and then she charged at those 30 experts.

She didn’t ask anything. She just chose to believe in Yang Ye!

Meanwhile, Feng Yihan spoke abruptly, “Stop now and leave with them. No one will be able to harm all of you.”

Tian Xiu closed her eyes slowly, “I told him to leave, yet he returned. It’s a path he chose. Since he chose this path, he has to take it until the end. As for me, I’ve chosen my path too. We don’t have a way out anymore. So, let’s fight!”

Hiss!

A ray of dark light shot up into space.

Bang!

The entire universe shook at this moment!

Feng Yihan pondered deeply for a moment and nodded, “All of us have no way out.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the space before him started breaking down into threads…

Breaking down space!

Every single thread of space contained extremely terrifying energy that was sufficient to obliterate the world!

Meanwhile, a ray of dark light tore through space.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

That expanse of space suddenly started burning and being obliterated, layer by layer. At the same time, faint mist appeared here. In just a short while, the mist converged into a dark green river, and even the black hole in space was obliterated by the river.

The Nether Springs.

The black hole was transformed into a place of death!

It was true destruction of the universe’s core!

Feng Yihan nodded slightly, “The Netherworld Destiny and Nether Springs!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure transformed into countless rays of black energy that vanished on the spot.

The battle up above erupted.

However, the people below couldn’t sense any of it.

Meanwhile, down below.

An Nanjing arrived before the 30 experts, but just a moment later, 30 black arrows shot at her.

An Nanjing’s eyes narrowed slightly, and she slammed Burning Fury down.

Bang!

The arrows before her were instantly blasted away, but An Nanjing was pushed over 10km back too! As soon as she stopped herself, a black arrow suddenly appeared before her forehead. An Nanjing’s reaction was instantaneous, and she grabbed with her left hand.

However…

Hiss!

An arrow pierced through her left shoulder. At the same time, many more arrows had appeared before her stomach, the back of her head, and various other vital points around her body!

Every arrow was aimed at a vital point!

Meanwhile, An Nanjing suddenly relaxed her grip, and the arrow before her forehead shot forward like a bolt of lightning.

However, An Nanjing was gone.

Hiss!

A strand of flaming light suddenly appeared before those 30 figures, and then a spear swept horizontally at them. But it stopped just halfway of the entire arc because 30 arrows had stabbed against it.

Bang!

The powerful force they carried blasted An Nanjing over 30km away!

They stood in the distance with their bows in hand and auras completely merged as one, and all of them were locked onto An Nanjing.

Once she stopped herself, An Nanjing wiped off the blood on the corner of her mouth. She knew she’d underestimated them!

While they couldn’t compare to those ten Undead Warriors, they weren’t much weaker.

An Nanjing fell silent for an instant, and then a vicious glow flashed through her eyes. She grabbed her ponytail with her left hand and wrapped it around her neck, and then she kicked Burning Fury with her right leg.

Bang!

It transformed into a flaming ray of light that shot at them.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing stomped her right foot down and followed closely behind Burning Fury!

Not too far away, Yang Ye withdrew his gaze from An Nanjing. He didn’t shoot another glance at her because he had confidence in her.

She grew stronger the more she fought!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at Xiao Lou. The latter grinned, “What? You want to fight me? Are you aware of the gap between us?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Xiao Lou grinned, “I understand what Void Spirit Maiden is trying to do. She wants to put you in a life and death situation so that you can overcome it. Unfortunately, I’m your opponent.”

He tapped his finger forward once he finished speaking.

Bang!

A wave of powerful energy blasted Yang Ye extremely far away!

Once he stopped himself, blood started seeping out from both sides of his mouth.

Xiao Lou chuckled, “Do you realize the size of the gap between us now?”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly. A moment of silence ensued before Yang Ye opened them and looked at Xiao Lou again. Yang Ye’s eyes were blood red.

He wiped off the blood on the corners of his mouth and took a step forward, “Three attacks! If I can’t kill you with three attacks, then I, Yang Ye, will take my own life!”

Bang! Bang!

As soon as he finished speaking, two types of intent surged out from within him.

Peak slaughter intent and peak sword intent!

A moment later, they started to ignite in flames!

Intent Ignition!

Ignition of Progenitor Realm slaughter intent and sword intent!
