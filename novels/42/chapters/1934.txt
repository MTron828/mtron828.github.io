Chapter 1935 – Sky Tomb!

What did Yang Ye see?

A woman had appeared before him. She was none other than his mother, Feng Yu.

Feng Yu!

An illusion!

That was Yang Ye’s first thought, and he was about to destroy it. But a voice suddenly resounded before him, “You think this is an illusion?”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he noticed a black shadow to his right. He would faintly see a person in the black shadow, but he couldn’t see the shadow’s appearance.

Meanwhile, the black shadow said, “Take a closer look!”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. In the end, his gaze descended onto Feng Yu.

“Ye’er…” Feng Yu placed her hands on his face, and her gaze was slightly blank, “You… you’ve grown up…”

It’s real!

Such a thought had suddenly appeared in Yang Ye’s mind, and it was ceaselessly telling him that she was real.

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he gazed at her, “Even if you’re fake, I won’t kill you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took a step back, and a mysterious wave of energy appeared here.

The Sword Domain!

Once the Sword Domain surrounded the area, Feng Yu transformed into a black shadow, and the true appearance of the black shadow to Yang Ye’s side was revealed.

It was a middle aged man in a black robe!

“The Sword Domain…” The man glanced at Yang Ye with quite complicated emotions in his eyes, “I haven’t seen one in many years.”

Yang Ye asked, “Who are you?”

The middle aged man said, “A lonely ghost!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What is the Sky Stairs?”

The middle aged man hesitated for a moment and said, “Fine, it isn’t a secret, so I can tell you. While it’s called the Sky Stairs, it’s actually the Sky Tomb!”

“The Sky Tomb?” Yang Ye’s frown deepened, “This is a tomb?”

The middle aged man nodded, “A tomb that has the souls of countless experts buried within it.”

“Who buried all of you?” Yang Ye asked, “The Sky Emperor?”

“The Sky Emperor?” The middle aged man chuckled, “He doesn’t have such strength. Moreover, he’s buried here too!”

Yang Ye asked, “Then who was it?”

The middle aged man fell silent for a moment and said, “An old man who wore a Daoist’s robes!”

The old man in Daoist’s robes!Yang Ye was stunned on the spot.

The old man in Daoist’s robes!

Quite some time passed before Yang Ye suppressed the shock he felt and asked, “Why did he bury all of you?”

The middle aged man laughed bitterly, “A battle between Paths. At that time, many races including the sky race, sky devil race, human race, oceanic race, demon race… Practically all the races were swept into that battle between Paths. Actually, the issue was the side we took. The people buried here are those who took the wrong side. Including the once almighty Sky Emperor. Even someone as powerful as him was so powerless and weak before that old man in a Daoist’s robes who held a horsetail whisk in his hand!”

Yang Ye glanced at the middle aged man and said, “Why did all of you get swept into such a battle between Paths?”

The middle aged man replied bitterly, “All of them, including that old man in Daoist’s robes, never displayed their strength in the past. They kept such a low profile that others thought they were nothing… But one day, he showed his strength. At that moment, everyone finally realized how terrifying he was. Unfortunately, it was too late!”

Yang Ye fell silent.

The old man in Daoist’s robes!

He had the old man’s Primordial Pagoda, and he knew that it was no coincidence. Since the old man had chosen him as the new owner of the Primordial Pagoda, then why?

Was it really because of the battle between the various Paths of cultivation in the universe?

Karma!

He’d encountered a few supreme experts, including the Sage he met in the Shaman Dimension. All of them said that he had three types of karma coiled around him, and every single one of them was more difficult to deal with than the last. One of them was definitely from the Primordial Pagoda.

At this moment, Yang Ye felt like he’d been swept into a huge vortex!

Suddenly, the middle aged man asked, “Young Brother, can you help me with something?”

Yang Ye restrained his thought and gazed at the middle aged man, “With what?”

What the middle aged man said next was absolutely shocking!

“Kill me!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

The middle aged man chuckled, “Our souls are trapped for eternity in this place. No one can leave, and neither can we die. But you can kill us!”

Yang Ye was puzzled by this, “Why?”

“Your Domain!” The man continued, “Your Sword Domain is a world of its own, and the mysterious energy here can’t affect us within your Domain.”

My Sword Domain! Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. At this moment, he finally understood why Hou Qing couldn’t detect anything strange about this place.

It was because this place was made by the old man in Daoist’s robes.

“One more thing!” The middle aged man added, “Can you give this to the patriarch of the Nie Clan in the Human Dimension?”

As soon as the middle aged man finished speaking, a spatial ring appeared before Yang Ye.

However, Yang Ye shook his head, “Senior, it’s not that I’m unwilling to help you, but my status in the human race is quite terrible. I’m sure you’re able to notice that while I’m a human, I have the bloodline of the shaman race, and I’ve cultivated the techniques of the shaman race. I’m afraid I won’t come out alive of your Nie Clan!”

“You’re afraid they’ll repay your kindness with enmity?” The middle aged man shook his head slightly, “If the Nie Clan patriarch does that, help me relieve him of his position.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Senior, that isn’t very realistic, right?”

The middle aged man glanced at the spatial ring in his grasp, “That belongs to my Nie Clan’s ancestor. It has been passed down in my clan as the symbol of the patriarch. The divine beast which protects my Nie Clan only recognizes that ring and not any individual person. If you can command our divine beast, you can command those old geezers of my clan!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “You trust me that much?”

The middle aged man walked over to Yang Ye and smiled, “I’ve seen countless people in my life, and you’re an extremely proud person. While my Nie Clan has some status in the Human Dimension, I’m certain that you won’t use that ring to take control of my Nie Clan. Of course, the main reason is because I don’t have another choice. I’ve waited for so many years. While others have come here, the stronger existences buried here take them. As for you…”

Yang Ye asked, “What about me?”

The middle aged man spoke solemnly, “They dare not seek your help!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

The middle aged man looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Something you carry arouses fear in us. I don’t know what it is, but we instinctively fear it.”

The Primordial Pagoda! Yang Ye thought of the Primordial Pagoda. It was obvious that it was what they feared!

The middle aged man said, “Through these years, the countless souls here have been searching for people from their own race, and then they passed down their inheritances to those people. The reason I came to you was for that exact reason. Because you’re human. However, it didn’t take long for me to realize that my inheritance is definitely beneath you.”

He gazed at the spatial ring and continued, “Some secrets of my clan and some other things only the patriarch is qualified to know are sealed within it. Most importantly, it’s the key to commanding the divine beast which guards my Nie Clan. Can you send it back to the Nie Clan?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Senior, allow me to be frank. If I go there, and they choose to kill me because I possess the shaman race’s bloodline, then I won’t show them mercy!”

The middle aged man smiled, “Don’t worry, you’ll have that ring with you. So, the Nie Clan’s patriarch wouldn’t dare or try to do anything to you. Of course, if the patriarch’s a brainless idiot, then it’ll be an entirely different story. However, I think the Nie Clan won’t allow a useless fellow to occupy the position of patriarch. If that has happened, then use that ring to summon the divine beast and remove him from his position.”

Yang Ye stopped hesitating and took the ring. He said, “I’ll go to the Nie Clan if I return to the Human Dimension.”

“Thank you!” The middle aged man continued, “Now, help me with one last thing.”

Yang Ye asked, “Are you really sure?”

The middle aged man smiled, “I’ve fulfilled my last wish. It’s torture to continue living in this form!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he nodded and activated the Sword Domain.

As soon as he did that, the middle aged man closed his eyes slowly. A moment later, his body grew increasingly ethereal. Around 10 breaths of time later, the middle aged man vanished on the spot.

Meanwhile, the surroundings returned to normal, and Yang Ye returned to the Sky Stairs.

Yang Ye looked down at the spatial ring in his grasp, and then he put it away before continuing up the stairway.

At this moment, there were only two people left ahead of him, a man and a woman.

They were still going forward. While they did stop from time to time, it didn’t take long for them to continue forward.

As for Yang Ye, he was growing faster and faster. Because no one else came for him after the middle aged man.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive beside the pair.

At the same time, they stopped and gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at them as well. The man wore an ink black robe, had hair that hung loosely to his shoulders, angled features, and looked very handsome.

The woman wore a green dress with flower patterns that was being dragged along behind her. Her figure was slender, but he couldn’t see her face. Because she was wearing a green mask.

The woman suddenly asked, “A human?”

Yang Ye was about to speak when the woman frowned slightly, “The shaman race’s bloodline? The shaman race’s physical cultivation technique?”

Yang Ye glanced at her while feeling quite surprised in his heart. She had actually been able to see through his secrets.

That was amazing!

Yang Ye didn’t think further about it. He just nodded slightly and continued forward.

The man and woman didn’t say anything as well, and they just continued forward too.

Just like that, they continued towards the end of the Sky Stairs.

They grew closer and closer to the end. When they were around a little over 100 steps away, all three of them suddenly stopped.

Because an old man and old woman had appeared before them.

The old man and the old man gazed at the woman and man by Yang Ye’s side.

The man bowed slightly to the old man, “You should be the Devil Exalt, Lord Zhong Qian, right?”

The old man sized up the man before he said, “The Chaos Body. After so many years, someone decent has finally come from my sky devil race.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand and vanished on the spot with the man.

The old woman gazed at the woman for a long time, and then she said, “The Sky Spirit Physique… I, Mo Xian, didn’t wait thousands of years for nothing!”

The woman exclaimed, “You’re the number one expert of the Spirit Dimension from all those years ago. The Sage of my Spirit Dimension, Mo Xian…”

The old woman nodded slightly. She didn’t say another word and just waved her right hand. The woman vanished on the spot.

Suddenly, she gazed at Yang Ye, “How pitiable. That Sage of the human race doesn’t want you, and that Sage of the shaman race doesn’t want you either. Not human or shaman. How pitiable indeed!”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes and didn’t say a word.
