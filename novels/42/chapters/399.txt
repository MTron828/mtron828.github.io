Chapter 400 – Merge!

After an unknown period had passed, Yang Ye seemed like he was made of electricity, and his entire body was densely covered by violet electricity!

Outside his room, An Biru gazed at the violet colored electricity that was raging even outside Yang Ye’s room, and her eyes carried a wisp of worry and heaviness.

“Is he subduing the Violetcloud Lightning?” asked An Biru in a low voice.

A black clothed woman appeared by her side and nodded lightly. “He should be!”

“How reckless!” An Biru frowned while her voice carried a trace of anger. She said, “The Violetcloud Lightning is ranked at the 3rd position amongst lightning element Natural Treasures, so how could it possibly be subdued that easily? Isn’t he courting death by doing that? Aunt, can you lend him a hand?”

The black clothed woman shook her head and said, “He’s at a critical juncture right now, and even the lightest touch might make him suffer calamity. After all, that Natural Treasure isn’t being controlled by anyone, so if it were to erupt, then while it wouldn’t be a threat to us, it would be lethal to him!”

“We can only wait now?”

“Yes!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

......

The electricity in the room grew steadily in both strength and amount.

Bang!

Suddenly, a strand of powerful electricity flashed through the air, and it instantly blasted the entire room into pieces before a strand of violet colored lightning that was thick as an arm shot into the sky. However, it had merely shot less than 20m above the roof when it was blasted into pieces by a strand of mysterious energy!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye slowly opened his eyes on the bed, and a strand of violet electricity flashed through the depths of his eyes. The Sword Spirit nodded lightly while standing in front of him, and then she said, “Congratulations, you’ve succeeded!

Yang Ye nodded while a wisp of happiness flashed through his eyes, and then he stretched out his right hand and spread his palm.

Hiss!

A thumb sized strand of electricity appeared on his palm, and then he gazed at it while the corners of Yang Ye’s lips curved up before a smile had appeared on his face. The smile gradually spread further, and then Yang Ye couldn’t help but roar with laughter!

He’d really suffered throughout the process of subduing the Violetcloud Lightning. If his violet profound energy hadn’t constantly repaired his body and resisted the electricity emanated by the Violetcloud Lightning, then he would have definitely perished. Even with his violet profound energy, he’d still suffered greatly. Because no one could hold on for long while being struck repeatedly by electricity at all times!

Fortunately, even though he’d really suffered, he’d succeeded in subduing the Violetcloud Lightning! From now onward, he possessed three Natural Treasures!

Bang

When he thought up to this point, Yang Ye opened up his left hand, and the Nether Ghostflame appeared on his palm. A wisp of a strange glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes while he gazed at the two Natural Treasures in his palms, and then he issued a command in his heart, causing the Ninth Hell Cold Gale to appear in front of him.

At this moment, as he gazed at these three Natural Treasures, a wisp of madness had appeared in Yang Ye’s eyes!

He issued another command in his heart, and then Dragonbone appeared and floated in front of him. He flicked his finger and the Nether Ghostflame was the first to cover Dragonbone. After that, Yang Ye flicked his finger once more, and then the Violetcloud Lightning instantly covered Dragonbone as well. However, as soon as the Violetcloud Lightning covered the sword, the Nether Ghostflame had suddenly emanated an ocean of flames, and it seemed to be unwilling to allow the Violetcloud Lightning to do that.

The Violetcloud Lightning refused to show weakness, and it immediately exploded apart into countless strands of violet electricity....

In an instant, the entire room collapsed!

Yang Ye suffered the brunt of the force, and he was blasted out of the room!

Cough!

Yang Ye crawled up slowly from the ground. Right at this moment, a wave of fragrance assaulted him before he felt that his arm had come into contact with something soft. He turned his head to look over, and he saw that An Biru had suddenly appeared by his side and was supporting him up.

“Thank you!” Yang Ye expressed his gratitude and stood up slowly, and then the corners of his mouth instantly twitched when he looked at the room he resided in just now. Because there was no such room anymore. There was only a large expanse of ruins there! Moreover, the Nether Ghostflame and Violetcloud Lightning were still colliding with each other above it!

Yang Ye’s face instantly darkened. Are these two fellows trying to rebel against me? After all, even if they disagreed with each other, he, Yang Ye, would have been transformed into a pile of mush if he didn’t possess a formidable physical body!

Yang Ye stretched out his hands and gestured, and the Nether Ghostflame and Violetcloud Lightning instantly flew into his palms. Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief in his heart because while these two fellows disagreed with each other and fought, they didn’t dare disobey his orders. But now, he had a slight problem, and it was how to make these two fellows coexist harmoniously with one another!

Otherwise, what would happen if these two fellows engaged in internal strife before he even fought his enemies?

But he was truly unwilling to give up on trying to merge the three Natural Treasures. Because he deeply believed that if he could merge them and utilize them to enhance his sword, then the might they revealed would be absolutely obliterating.

Yang Ye shook his head and sighed lightly before he put the two Natural Treasures away. At this moment, he could only put this thought aside for now.

Meanwhile, An Biru suddenly asked. “You want to make them merge?”

Yang Ye didn’t conceal his thoughts and nodded. “Indeed. After all, their might would definitely be extremely shocking if I can merge them together. Unfortunately, you’ve seen the results. The Nether Ghostflame and Violetcloud Lightning are extremely violent Natural Treasures, so it’s truly quite difficult to make them merge together!”

An Biru suddenly said, “Actually, it isn’t very difficult!”

Yang Ye turned his head swiftly to gaze at An Biru, and his eyes flickered with the glow of excitement. “You know how to accomplish it?”

An Biru pondered deeply for a moment before she said, “The reason you can’t merge them is actually that you don’t understand them, and you’re unable to take full control of them. If you attain a thorough comprehension of them and can control them skillfully, then merging them shouldn’t be difficult at all. After all, you’ve already subdued them, so they won’t refuse your will!”

“A thorough comprehension?” Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment before he shook his head and laughed bitterly. “Looks like I was too impatient!”

After all, he didn’t even dare say that he possessed a thorough understanding of the Nether Ghostflame, let alone the Violetcloud Lightning that he’d just subdued? So, he’d really been quite rash and impatient.

An Biru nodded and said, “You really can’t be impatient when dealing with Natural Treasures. They contain extremely terrifying energy, and the slightest mistake is very likely to injure you. Just like that explosion earlier. If it wasn’t for your formidable physical body, then you would probably be a corpse right now. So, you must remember to not be impulsive and rash in the future, and you must consider the consequences before you do anything. Understand?”

Yang Ye’s heart felt slightly warm when he heard her concerned tone, and then he nodded and smiled, “Don’t worry. This only happened because I was overwhelmed by my excitement and seized by impulse. It will absolutely not happen again. After all, I don’t have the habit of torturing myself!”

When he spoke up to here, he glanced at the destroyed room and smiled with embarrassment. “Err... I’m really sorry. Don’t worry, I’ll compensate....”

An Biru glanced at him and said, “There’s no need for compensation. Head to the training room if you want to cultivate in the future! You can do anything you like there, but if you cause a huge commotion here and alarm the Enforcement Team in the city, then you’ll be in huge trouble.”

When she spoke up to this point, An Biru paused for a moment and said, “You’re not young anymore, so you should think of the consequences before doing things. There’s a huge difference between acting decisively and rashly!”

Yang Ye was stunned when he heard this. Her voice carried a concerned tone, yet it seemed to carry a little bit of a different tone. Yang Ye wasn’t able to put a finger on it, and he just felt that it was strange.

An Biru revealed a slightly uncomfortable expression when she noticed Yang Ye was staring at her, and then she glanced indifferently at Yang Ye before he made a casual tossing motion at him. A white jade bottle appeared before Yang Ye as she said, “This is a bottle of healing medicine. You just subdued the Violetcloud Lightning and suffered the impact from that explosion, so you’re both internally and externally injured right now. This medicine should be extremely helpful to you!”

As soon as she finished speaking, An Biru didn’t stay here for another moment, and she turned around and left!

Yang Ye stood on the spot and just stared blankly at her leaving figure for some time....

After some time passed, Yang Ye shook his head and stopped thinking about all of that, and he took the white jade bottle and headed to the training room that An Biru spoke of. Presently, working hard to improve his strength was the most important matter at hand because it would be time for him to return to the southern territory once the Hidden Dragon Rankings truly came to an end!

At that time, there would probably be many people in the southern territory who wouldn’t want him to return alive....
