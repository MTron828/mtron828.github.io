Chapter 1825 – The Nether Abyss!

Conditions!

Needless to say, Snowy was growing shrewd.

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head and smiled, “Tell me what your conditions are!”

She cracked a smile and started waving her claws about.

It only took a moment for Yang Ye to understand what her conditions were.

Snowy’s conditions were very simple. She wanted to go out and play.

Yang Ye hadn’t allowed her to go out for safety’s sake. Because he didn’t know when he would encounter danger, and if Snowy was out there, she would be in extreme danger once he suddenly encountered danger!

Yang Ye was about to refuse, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it when he saw the hope which filled Snowy’s eyes.

Yang Ye rubbed her head gently and said, “I can let you come outside. However, you have to promise me two things. Don’t start nodding yet. I haven’t even told you what my conditions are!”

Snowy cracked a smile, and then she hugged Yang Ye’s face and rubbed her head against his forehead to display that she would agree to anything!

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled before he spoke softly, “You can go out and play, but you must enter the pagoda immediately if I get into a fight. That’s alright with you, right?”

Snowy blinked and nodded.

Yang Ye continued, “One more condition. You’re not allowed to act recklessly!”

Snowy was much more mischievous than she had been in the past. Especially now that she’d learned all sorts of sword techniques! Yang Ye was truly quite afraid of her!

For the sake of going out there to have some fun, Snowy didn’t hesitate to nod and display her agreement!

Yang Ye smiled. He didn’t choose to leave the pagoda, and he went to the cultivation room on the 3rd level instead.

Sky Maiden, Blind Maiden, and An Nanjing were here.

At this moment, An Nanjing was looking at Sky Maiden.

Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto Sky Maiden. At this moment, her eyes were shut tight, and a faint yet powerful aura was coming from her.

Yang Ye walked in her direction, but An Nanjing suddenly stopped him, “Be careful!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

An Nanjing replied, “Don’t get within 3m of her. There’s a powerful devouring force there, and it’s very dangerous!”

A devouring force! Yang Ye turned to look at Sky Maiden. He knew her ability well. Yin’yin’s unique physique had allowed her to devour many things in the past, and her ability grew even more terrifying after she obtained the Heaven Devourer Technique from Grandpa Whitebeard!

Who was the old man?

Yang Ye was quite curious. Unfortunately, she wouldn’t tell him at all. She might have if she was still just Yin’yin!

Yang Ye withdrew his thoughts and gazed at An Nanjing, “Do you want to head outside?”

She shook her head in response, “I want to cultivate here.” She paused for a moment and continued, “This is a paradise for cultivating!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I think so too!”

Actually, his natural talent was inferior to An Nanjing, Nether Maiden, and the others. The reason he possessed such accomplishments was mainly because of the violet energy and cultivation room within the Primordial pagoda. Especially the cultivation room, it allowed him to cultivate quicker!

If An Nanjing cultivated here, then based on her natural talent, it would absolutely be horrifying.

However, it was a good thing for him!

The stronger she was, the better it was for him!

Yang Ye chatted with her for a while, and then he went over to Blind Maiden.

Blind Maiden looked much better now. Of course, it was because of the Primordial Violet Energy.

Yang Ye sized up Blind Maiden and said, “Third Sister, how do you feel?”

He knew that destroying the formation with that move had exhausted her tremendously. Otherwise, Blood Maiden wouldn’t have asked him to send her here.

Blind Maiden shook her head slightly, “I’m fine now. This place is extraordinary.” She paused for a moment and continued, “Don’t let outsiders know about it. Otherwise, you’ll suffer great trouble!”

Yang Ye smiled, “You’re not an outsider!”

Blind Maiden was slightly stunned, and then an imperceptible arc curled up on the corners of her mouth. A few breaths of time later, she shook her head slightly, “Hmph. Just listen to me. The heart of man is a complicated one. Possessing such a precious treasure makes it impossible to prevent others from coveting it. So, it’s best not to expose it unless it’s necessary!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand!”

Besides those close to him, he would absolutely not allow others to be aware of the Primordial Pagoda. Because he was very well aware that once others found out that he had it, then he would never have a day of peace in his life!

Or it should be said that he would definitely die!

At that time, besides ancient cultivators, even the almighty figures of the large universe may come for him.

In short, unless the old man in Daoist’s robes came to protect him, he would die!

Yang Ye spoke with Blind Maiden for a while, and then he gazed at Snowy who was sitting on his shoulder. He smiled, “Come, let’s go outside!”

Yang Ye and Snowy vanished on the spot.

In the world outside, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he crushed a transmission talisman. It only took a moment for the space in front of him to tremble slightly.

Two breaths of time later, Yang Ye and Snowy vanished on the spot.

Even though Heaven Pillar Mountain was just a mountain, it was huge. Besides the four cities, there were numerous towering mountain ranges all around Heaven Pillar Mountain.

They were extremely dangerous mountain ranges.

Because there may be peerless experts, senior cultivators, or even ancient cultivators in the mountain ranges!

So, people normally didn’t dare to step foot into them.

Yang Ye, on the other hand, didn’t think that much. He just entered the boundless mountain range. However, he didn’t do so openly, and he concealed his aura completely.

Snowy’s face was covered in excitement as she stood on his shoulder, and she kept looking all around her.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to stop before a mountain. As soon as he did, Blood Maiden and the others appeared before him.

They seemed visibly relieved when they saw him.

They had been extremely worried just now. After all, Yang Ye had been facing over 50 6th stage True Realm experts! Even if all of them were there, they wouldn’t have been able to defeat such a huge number of experts, but Yang Ye had chosen to face them on his own!

Fortunately, he was fine!

Blood Maiden asked, “Is our eldest sister alright?”

Yang Ye nodded, “She’s very stable right now. But I don’t know when she’ll be done!”

Blood Maiden shook her head, “I don’t know either. But it’s fine so long as she’s stable.” Blood Maiden gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Besides for the sake of helping you, I made them go to you and help you for one other reason, and it’s because I hoped that you’ll help us with something!”

She seemed to have thought of something at this point and added, “We didn’t help you because we needed your help.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Second Sister, it’s fine. I’ve never thought about it like that. I’m serious. If I did, I wouldn’t call you my second sister.”

He truly trusted them. Because he knew that they wouldn’t try to harm him. Moreover, if he couldn’t even trust them, then there may be no one left in this world whom he could trust!

Blood Maiden gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and smiled, “I was overthinking things!”

Yang Ye said, “Go on, tell me what you need my help with!”

Blood Maiden spoke solemnly, “Help us destroy a barrier!”

“A barrier?” Yang Ye continued, “You aren’t thinking about asking me to destroy the barrier over Heaven Pillar Mountain right?”

Blood Maiden shook her head, “Even if you have the wooden sword, you can’t break through that barrier with your current strength. The barrier we need you to break is much easier than that. However, it isn’t very easy. At the very least, we can’t do it!”

The corners of his mouth twitched. You call that easy?

How strong were Blood Maiden, Blind Maiden, and the others? If it was a barrier that even they couldn’t break, then he didn’t even have to see it to know how terrifying it was.

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden said, “That place is a place that Pavilion Master Siyou once stayed at. However, a barrier she left behind is present there. Our strength isn’t sufficient to break through it at all. Only you, or to be more precise, only the combined strength of you and that sword of yours may have a chance to break through it!”

The wooden sword!

Yang Ye flipped his palm, and it appeared in his grasp. Needless to say, he still hadn’t seen anything that the wooden sword couldn’t pierce through!

It was extremely strong indeed!

Blood Maiden said, “It’s the place where Pavilion Master Siyou was last seen, so we must go there and have a look. Only then will we be able to find out if she has gone to the large universe or somewhere else!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Yang Ye asked, “Have the members of the Nether Pavilion come, or is it just all of you?”

Blood Maiden replied, “The Pavilion Master is here too. However, Fan Yinyu and her didn’t come with us. As for where they are, even I don’t really know. We rarely communicated with them upon arriving here!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Second Sister, are all of you searching for your previous pavilion master just to determine her whereabouts?”

Blood Maiden fell silent.

Yang Ye said, “It’s fine. If you don’t want to tell me, then I won’t ask. Let’s go!”

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden spoke softly, “It’s not that I can’t tell you, it’s that it does you no good to know. However, you’ll find out when the time is right.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Alright! Where’s the barrier?”

Blood Maiden turned to look towards the distance. She fell silent for a long time and replied, “The Nether Abyss! A forbidden area in Heaven Pillar Mountain!”
