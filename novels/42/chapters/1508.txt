Chapter 1509 - Looking Down On Others!

Translator: InVader

The old man’s face was extremely gloomy.

It was a slap to the face!

Yang Ye had slapped him on the face, and it was a slap on the Ma Clan’s face too!

Even though the intent to kill in his eyes was almost material, the old man still didn’t attack. Because he didn’t have the ability to kill Yang Ye. Not to mention killing Yang Ye, he might even be killed instead!

After all, Yang Ye had killed a Dualism Realm expert already!

The old man stared at Yang Ye for a long time, and then he said, “Good! Very good! I’ll be waiting for you in the large world! I hope you’re able to remain so arrogant once you reach the large world!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure vanished on the spot.

Zhuang Weiran asked, “Why didn’t you kill him?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I can’t!”

If it was possible, he would have killed the old man. However, the old man was clearly vigilant against him and stayed very far away. So long as he attacked, the old man would definitely be able to react. It was utterly impossible to instantly annihilate the old man when the old man was absolutely vigilant. The main reason he’d succeeded before this was that his enemy hadn’t been vigilant, and he’d taken his enemy by surprise!

So, if he attacked earlier, he would have only been wasting his profound energy!

Zhuang Weiran was about to speak when a voice suddenly resounded from the sky, “Formidable indeed! You actually don’t even fear Dualism Realm experts!”

As soon as the voice finished resounding, a young man in a luxurious robe appeared in the sky above the city.

Yang Ye glanced at him and asked, “You’re from the large world?”

“Exactly!” The young man sized up Yang Ye, “I knew it. How could someone capable of offending that little she-devil be ordinary? I’m really quite curious. How did you offend her? She was actually willing to give up one of her divine flames in order to kill you.”

Yang Ye said, “If she wants to kill me, then why didn’t she come down here herself?”

“She said she didn’t want to dirty her hands!” The young man continued, “In the past, I believed that. After all, she’s very proud. Yet now, I think we were deceived by her. You aren’t an ordinary expert. Even she may not be able to kill you if she came down here.”

Mo Xiaoleng! Yang Ye’s face gradually turned icy cold. She really refuses to give up on killing me!

“Since I’ve come down here, I can’t just go back. Otherwise, it would be so lame!” The young man added, “Yang Ye, how about we spar? I really want to see how strong a genius of the lower dimensions is. Of course, it’s just a spar, and we won’t decide life and death!”

Ye Liuyun and the others were almost unable to hold back their laughter. The young man was quite smart. If he said that, then the essence of the battle would change. In the beginning, he was here to kill Yang Ye. Under such circumstances, Yang Ye wouldn’t show any mercy to him. Yet now, he said that he was here to spar.

At this moment, Yang Ye would seem quite undignified if he killed the young man.

Simply speaking, the young man knew he was no match for Yang Ye, but he wasn’t willing to head back just like that. However, if he fought Yang Ye, he was afraid that Yang Ye would try to take his life. So, that was why he’d said all of that.

Yang Ye glanced at the young man and said, “Make you move!” He wanted to see how strong the geniuses of the large world were.

The young man nodded slightly, and then his figure vanished on the spot. He was in front of Yang Ye when his figure appeared again. At the same time, numerous afterimages appeared around Yang Ye. Those afterimages were spinning rapidly, causing the space around Yang Ye to ripple.

At this moment, the space around Yang Ye seemed like it had transformed into a rope, and the rope was coiling around Yang Ye like a python. It was about to twist him into bits.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly as he stood at the center of those afterimages. Needless to say, the young man was extremely strong. Because he actually felt sharp pain coming from his entire body. It felt like he was about to be minced into bits. His body was at the Undying Realm, and he’d even cultivated the Undying Elemental Body technique.

Under normal circumstances, even Deities would find it difficult to injure him, but he actually felt like he was about to be minced into bits!

Yang Ye stopped underestimating his opponent and took a step forward. His Quasi Returnal Rank sword intent and slaughter intent surged out madly, and then they immediately condensed. After that, they erupted towards the surroundings.

The Brink Laws!

Boom!

A loud explosion resounded as the space in a huge area shattered and collapsed, transforming the entire sky into an expanse of pitch black darkness.

A long time passed before the space in the sky was repaired by the Laws of the Heaven Dao. However, the battle wasn’t over. Explosions were resounding incessantly there. At this moment, many weren’t able to see Yang Ye and the young man at all. Because they were too quick. They were so quick that others couldn’t see their movements at all!

If it wasn’t for the explosions that were frequently resounding in the sky, no one would think that Yang Ye and the young man were in a fierce battle!

However, they didn’t fight for long. The sky suddenly cracked apart, and then Yang Ye and the young man appeared within everyone’s fields of vision.

Based on their outer appearance, both of them seemed fine. However, everyone knew that the outcome had been decided!

A long moment of silence ensued, and then the young man spoke solemnly, “Your cultivation in the body is really strong!”

Yang Ye glanced at the young man, “You’re quite strong too!”

The young man laughed bitterly, “I’m much inferior when compared to you.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he hesitated for a moment and continued, “After what happened between you, Ma Wudi, and Nether Emperor Stellar Region, many who intended to come looking for you have mostly returned. However, you have to watch out for one person. He’s quite well known in the large world, and he’s much stronger than I am.”

Yang Ye asked, “Who?”

“Li Ge!” The young man spoke solemnly, “He’s an extraordinary genius that really likes Mo Xiaoleng. So, he’ll definitely come to take your head and please Mo Xiaoleng. If you encounter him…” The young man paused for a moment and continued, “Actually, based on your strength, only a few in the younger generation of the large world can kill you.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “No matter what, thank you for the warning!”

The young man nodded, “Thank you for showing mercy. Farewell!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and vanished into the sky.

After the young man left, Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and glanced at the sky, “Do you want me to invite all of you down here to have a drink?”

As soon as he finished speaking, many people hidden in the surroundings immediately left swiftly.

Meanwhile, Zhuang Weiran said, “Many of them wanted to take advantage of the situation!”

Yang Ye laughed coldly, “They’re just a bunch of cowards. There’s no need to pay any attention to them.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took Zhuang Weiran’s hand and entered the city.

At this moment, while Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region wasn’t a four star stellar region, but it was even more terrifying than a four star stellar region because of Yang Ye’s presence.

After staying a day in Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region, Yang Ye planned to travel to Dark Hell Continent. He had two things to do before heading to the large world, and the first of those two things was to visit Su Qingshi and the others.

However, Yang Ye thought of something on his way to Dark Hell Continent, and it was the divine crystals that Shi Tian owed him. Presently, both the Sword Alliance and Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region needed a huge number of divine crystals, and Shi Tian owed him a few million. Once he got those divine crystals, then divine crystals wouldn’t be a problem for both the Sword Alliance and Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region anymore!

After he arrived at Stellar City, Yang Ye went straight for the Shi Clan.

The Shi Clan was situated at the center of Stellar City. It occupied a huge area, and it was the most luxurious building in the entire city. Of course, it was the strongest in the city as well.

Yang Ye didn’t just walk in! He was no fool!

At the entrance of the Shi Clan’s estate.

A guard gazed at Yang Ye and asked, “You’re here to see our young master?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The guard asked a second question, “You say that you’re his friend?”

Yang Ye nodded again.

“How laughable!” A wisp of ridicule had curled up on the corners of that guard’s mouth, “How laughable indeed. Many people have come looking for our young master lately, but you’re the first to use this excuse. You say that you’re his friend. Why don’t you take a look at yourself? Are you even worthy of being his friend? Go back from where you came from! Don’t waste my time!”

Yang Ye was shocked.

Precisely speaking, he was quite stunned. He hadn’t expected it to be like this. After all, he was merely here to look for someone!

But the guard was looking down on him!

He hadn’t expected to encounter a guard that would look down on everyone!

Yang Ye wouldn’t make a fuss about it, of course. So, he immediately said, “Just go notify your young master. Tell him I’m here to collect the debt he owes me. He’ll understand.”

“Don’t you understand what I just said?” Meanwhile, the guard’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Or perhaps you need to be convinced by force? You…”

His voice stopped abruptly because a hand had clamped down on his throat.

It was Yang Ye’s hand, of course!

Yang Ye lifted the guard up in front of him and looked the guard in the eyes, “Do you have to act like this? I just asked you to notify him of my arrival! Do you really have to act like this?”

As he spoke, Yang Ye slammed the guard against the ground.

Boom!

The ground cracked apart as a shrill cry resounded from the guard.

“Who dares to cause trouble at my Shi Clan’s estate?!” Meanwhile, a furious shout resounded from within the estate, and then around ten terrifying auras slammed down in Yang Ye’s direction!

Deities!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he announced himself, “Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region! Yang Ye!”

As soon as he finished speaking, those auras instantly surged backwards like a receding tide.
