Chapter 2394 – It is a Threat!

The Mysterious Spirit Fruit!

Actually, as far as Yang Ye was concerned, the fruit on the table wasn’t bad, and even Oxxy’s eyes were filled with desire within the Primordial Pagoda.

However, he was very well aware that it was nothing to Snowy!

After all, she had another fruit, the fruit from the old man with a bamboo chest. That was a true Divine Treasure!

Right Sword wanted to say more, but the woman in front of Yang Ye suddenly glanced at her, and Right Sword grunted coldly, “Young Master, he’s insulting you and that Divine Treasure!”

The woman ignored her and gazed at Yang Ye with a smile, “Brother Yang, what do you think of them?”

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “Their natural talent is very good, but their character is bad, and their mentality is worse!”

Very good natural talent!

Actually, they were only around the age of 20, but they were at the True Dao Realm. Besides that, their sword intent was at the peak of the Progenitor Realm. They were only a step away from True Dao Realm sword intent!

Such attainments at their age were extremely terrifying!

The woman in front of Yang Ye chuckled when she heard Yang Ye, but it only took a moment for her to start coughing violently instead.

The two women hurriedly walked over to her, and then Left Sword passed a white pearl to her. The woman shook her head slightly, but Left Sword got anxious and hurriedly said, “Young Master, just eat it.”

She smiled and didn’t insist when she saw the anxiety on the two women’s faces. She swallowed the white pearl. After that, she gazed at Yang Ye, “Young Master Yang, I raised these maidservants of mine. They may be my maidservants, but they are like loved ones to me. But because of me and their own natural talent, it was unavoidable that they become slightly proud and haughty.”

She gazed at the two women who’d lowered their heads, “What did I say when I asked you to invite Young Master Yang here?”

Right Sword hesitated for a moment and said, “To be respectful, and don’t insist if Young Master Yang refuses!”

She asked, “But what did both of you do?”

They fell silent.

The woman gazed at Yang Ye and grinned, “If you knew he was so strong, would you still do the same? You wouldn’t. Because the strong should be respected, but should the weak not be respected too? Remember this lesson today, and you can leave if you act with an air of superiority over others again!”

Their faces instantly turned ghastly pale, and they immediately knelt on the ground and lowered their heads as they begged for mercy.

“Stand!” The woman waved her hand lightly, and a soft gust of wind helped them up, “Apologize to Young Master Yang!”

They didn’t hesitate to walk over to Yang Ye’s side and bow slightly, “Young Master Yang, we were at wrong. Please forgive us!”

Yang Ye glanced at them, and they lowered their heads and dared not meet his gaze.

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled before looking at the woman before him, “Shall we get down to business?”

She smiled, “Of course. Right, allow me to introduce myself, A’Leng!”

A’Leng!

It was quite a different name, but Yang Ye didn’t have the mood to think too much about it. He just spoke frankly, “Miss A’Leng, you said that you can help me locate my friend. Is that true?”

She grinned, “Of course.”

Yang Ye asked, “What do you want in return?”

A'Leng took a sip from her teacup and said, “I’m sure you’ve noticed the issues I have with my body. Due to certain reasons, I’ve been sick for many years, and it’s impossible to treat it no matter how I try. I came to Eternal Border in hopes of obtaining a Divine Treasure that can treat my illness, but my search was in vain. However, right when I was about to leave, I received news, news about you!”

Yang Ye said, “The Primordial Violet Energy!”

She grinned, “Exactly. It’s one of the ten great spirit energies, and it can be described as a divine energy of healing. If I have its help, it might be possible to treat my illness.”

Yang Ye took a gulp of his tea and said, “Find An Nanjing and I’ll treat you!”

She smiled, “Alright!”

She withdrew a map and placed it before Yang Ye, “This is a map of Divine Martial Continent, and the places circled in red are the forbidden areas of this continent.” She pointed at two of the red circles and continued, “If I’m not wrong, she’s very likely to be in one of these places.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She smiled, “These are the only two places on Divine Martial Continent that aren’t familiar to me. To be honest, I sent people to search for An Nanjing before you even arrived. Unfortunately, there’s no sign of her anywhere else.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Are you sure she’s not anywhere else?”

A’Leng smiled, “I’m certain.”

Yang Ye gazed at the map. The places she was pointing at were the Martial Tomb and Southern Desolate Lands.”

Yang Ye gazed at her and asked, “What are these places?”

She replied softly, “They can be considered as the most mysterious places on Divine Martial Continent. Especially the Martial Tomb. Only Xiao Shenwu has been able to come out alive from that place. As for the Southern Desolate Lands, while I haven’t been there, I do know a little about it. There’s a mysterious expert there. As for how strong that expert is or who that expert is, I do not know!”

The Martial Tomb!

Yang Ye gazed at the Martial Tomb first, “Miss A’Leng, why is it called the Martial Tomb?”

A'Leng smiled, “According to legend, an extremely formidable expert in the Martial Dao is buried there. However, even I don’t know the truth of that legend.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’ll go have a look then!”

Left Sword and Right Sword couldn’t help but gaze at Yang Ye. Go to the Martial Tomb? It’s the most dangerous place on Divine Martial Continent!

A'Leng suddenly said, “Young Master Yang, do you need help with anything?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Please continue investigating her whereabouts, and please let me know if you find anything.”

A'Leng smiled, “Alright!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then took Snowy in his arms and was about to leave. However, Snowy suddenly gazed at Right Sword, and then she flew over to Right Sword.

Snowy lifted her palm, and an ethereal axe appeared in her grasp!

Snowy’s going to attack her?

Yang Ye was stunned, but it didn’t take long for him to chuckle.

This little fellow!

Snowy didn’t attack. She waved the Primordial Axe of Creation at Right Sword, and then put it aside.

Right Sword was stunned at the sight of the axe.

A Divine Treasure!

It was actually a Divine Treasure!

However, that wasn’t the end of it. Snowy flipped her paw, and an ethereal pagoda appeared there.

The Primordial Pagoda!

Another Divine Treasure!

Right Sword was utterly stunned!

But that still wasn’t the end of it! Snowy sped up, and it didn’t take long for the Sword Gourd, Seal of Suppression, Myriad World Diagram, and True Energy Mirror to appear before Right Sword!

Divine Treasures!

All of them were Divine Treasures!

True Divine Treasures!

Right Sword was beyond stunned, and it was like she’d seen a ghost!

Right Sword wasn’t the only one who was stunned, A’Leng was quite stunned too. Because there were just too many Divine Treasures there! It made her wonder when they had become so common!

Meanwhile, Snowy cracked a smile at Right Sword and put the treasures away. She flew over to Yang Ye’s shoulder, and Yang Ye rubbed her head, “You little fellow!”

He transformed into a ray of light and vanished into the sky.

Right Sword took a long time to finally recover from her shock, and she gazed at A’Leng, “Young Master, she… she has so many Divine Treasures, even more than the Divine Martial Sect!”

As the number one sect of this continent, it actually couldn’t compare in wealth to that white little fellow!

Divine Treasures!

Right Sword was extremely shocked. It was the first time she’d seen so many of them!

A’Leng shook her head and smiled, “You don’t know her true identity. If you did, your jaw would hit the ground! Compared to those Divine Treasures, she’s the true rare existence! Even 10,000 Divine Treasures can’t compare to her!”

Right Sword was about to ask about it when A’Leng suddenly said, “Since you’re here, show yourself!”

A moment of silence ensued, and then an old man appeared nearby.

The old man glanced at her and was about to speak when she suddenly said, “You’re here for Yang Ye?”

The old man replied, “Yes!”

A’Leng nodded, “I’ve made a deal with him, that’s all. I’m not interested in interfering in the enmity between him and the powers of Eternal Border, and I have no intent to fight for that Sprite Progenitor.”

The old man asked, “What deal have you made with him?”

She glanced at him, “You don’t need to know!”

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly while a powerful wave of pressure appeared here. Suddenly, A’Leng slapped her palm lightly against the table. In an instant, a jade cup on the table transformed into a ray of light that shot at the old man.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the old man was blasted far away!

Once he stopped himself, he looked down at his palm, and there was a bloody hole there!

it was a very deep hole that went through his arm!

The old man clenched his right fist slowly and looked up at her with deep fear in his eyes.

Meanwhile, she stood up slowly and walked out of the bamboo house, “Allow me to repeat myself. I have no intention of interfering in Yang Ye’s business with the powers of Eternal Border. However, all of you should not interfere in my business with him too. Don’t disturb him until our business is concluded, otherwise, anyone from your powers who dares to step foot into Divine Martial Continent won’t see another sunrise.”

The old man asked, “Is that a threat?”

She stopped and grinned, “It is a threat.”

She coughed lightly, “Send him off!”

As soon as she gave the order, two robust middle aged men appeared behind the old man.

Both were Two World Realm experts!

The old man’s expression changed at this moment.
