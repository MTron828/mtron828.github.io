Chapter 2441 – Weak!

Strong!

Needless to say, Yang Ye’s group was at a complete disadvantage in this collision.

The Four World Realm!

If the Four World Experts from before were compared to these three experts and that desolate beast, it was like the difference between the heavens and the earth. After all, the Four World Realm experts from before hadn’t been able to endure Yang Ye’s attack which carried five swings of his sword with the Sword Domain!

However, Yang Ye’s opponent hadn’t just withstood that attack, he’d even injured Yang Ye in the process.

A Four World Realm expert who’d truly attained this realm of cultivation without any help!

Yang Ye suddenly grinned, and then he walked toward the man with a saber.

An expert!

Yang Ye was looking for such an expert to fight with. Only then could he truly be pressured, and only with pressure could he unleash his strength. That was the only way for him to discover his own flaws and the advantages that his opponent possessed!

Fight!

He’d always yearned to fight to his heart’s content!

He could naturally do that with An Nanjing too. But he had to stop when appropriate with her. After all, it was impossible for them to fight to the death! But this expert was different.

He could decide on the victor and the person who lives when fighting this expert!

The Deathguard with the saber gazed at Yang Ye with indifference on his face, but an ethereal saber had appeared in his grasp.

At most times, a battle between experts depended on their mental states. Or to be more direct, their mentality. If their mental states collapsed, their auras would naturally weaken. As he walked toward the Deathguard, there was an indescribable aura of confidence coming from Yang Ye.

However, the Deathguard was extremely calm and wasn’t affected by Yang Ye’s aura at all!

An expert?

The Deathguards of the desolate race had seen all sorts of experts! Yang Ye may be strong, but he was quite inferior when compared to the Desolate Emperor and some of the experts from Eternal Kingdom. So, it was clearly impossible for Yang Ye to suppress him with just aura alone.

Executor suddenly vanished from Yang Ye’s grasp, and it was replaced by the Sword Precursor.

His goal wasn’t to kill but to fight!

A’Leng and Huang Ying watched as Yang Ye suddenly transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

Meanwhile, the Deathguard’s saber moved.

It chopped down!

The saber energy was ghastly, powerful, and fast!

The sword and saber collided!

Bang!

Space shook violently, and then the space in a huge area cracked open like a spiderweb!

But it didn’t take long for the space here to return to normal. At the same time, an invisible wave of energy appeared throughout the area! Along with the arrival of this energy, the space throughout the area grew even stronger.

Huang Ying looked up at the sky, “Someone is strengthening the space here!”

A’Leng replied indifferently, “The higher-ups of the desolate race are watching?”

Huang Ying nodded.

A’Leng closed her eyes slowly, “When I was in Eternal Kingdom, my clan had records on the Desolate Deathguard. According to those records, all of them have experienced numerous battles, and they would rather die in battle than surrender. They instilled horror in countless experts throughout Eternal Kingdom when you attacked all those years ago! So, let me see if they really are as those records say!”

A'Leng’s figure gradually turned ethereal!

A moment later, she vanished on the spot, and when she appeared again, she was above the Deathguard with blood red gloves.

Her palm descended!

It seemed to carry the strength of the world, and it was simply intimidating.

The Deathguard suddenly looked up and slammed his fist upward.

There was a blood red glow around his fist!

As soon as they collided, the world shook violently. However, A’Leng had vanished on the spot, and then a palm slapped down at the Deathguard’s face!

Just like that, in just a short breath of time, A’Leng and the Deathguard had collided at least 1,000 times!

Even though the Deathguard was being pushed back repeatedly, he’d withstood every one of A’Leng’s attacks. However, not only did A’Leng’s aura avoid weakening, it was even growing stronger!

She was being serious!

Huang Ying looked at his own opponent and said, “Come! Let’s have a proper fight!”

His figure transformed into a ray of light that shot at the young man.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye and the Deathguard were locked in battle again.

The most intense battle here was between Yang Ye and the Deathguard with the saber. They had completely disregarded their lives, and every collision between them left a blood red injury on them!

Just like that, it only took a short while for both of them to be covered in injuries.

Every attack drew blood!

In the Primordial Pagoda, Snowy was looking up at the sky from the Ascension Platform, and Oxxy, Erya, and Sword Scroll were with her. Anxiety filled Snowy’s eyes.

An Nanjing was standing nearby with indifference on her face.

A short while passed before Snowy glanced at An Nanjing and flew over to her. Snowy pointed up. She was asking An Nanjing if she could lead Oxxy and the others to help Yang Ye.

In the beginning, she’d already planned to lead the demon beasts to help Yang Ye, but An Nanjing had stopped her.

An Nanjing glanced at Snowy and said, “Just watch.”

Snowy was a little hesitant. Meanwhile, An Nanjing suddenly walked toward Snowy, and the latter hurriedly flew over to Erya’s shoulder and sat down obediently.

Sword Scroll was quite amused by this scene. Because even someone as lawless as Snowy had someone she feared!

Sword Scroll naturally understood what An Nanjing sought to do. Yang Ye was improving his strength through battle. If they helped him, it wouldn’t be difficult to kill the Deathguard, but Yang Ye would never get to improve himself. Moreover, if that continued, Yang Ye’s strength would start to stagnate. Yang Ye had to fight normal battles himself, and it was something he wanted too.

Sword Scroll walked over to An Nanjing and looked up at the sky, “That Deathguard is very strong.”

An Nanjing replied indifferently, “He’s not bad!”

Not bad!

Sword Scroll laughed bitterly, “An Nanjing, they aren’t just not bad. These Deathguards of the desolate rate instilled terror in countless experts of Eternal Kingdom all those years ago. During that battle, their army was unstoppable upon entering Eternal Kingdom, and they almost killed their way to the capital. They have truly experienced countless battles!”

She gazed at An Nanjing, “Of course, they wouldn’t be able to gain an advantage over someone like you!”

The Martial God Physique!

Her physique was no joke. Ordinary people couldn’t compete with her in battle at all. Even Yang Ye was inferior to her.

Actually, Sword Scroll was very curious. Who would win if Yang Ye and An Nanjing fought to the death?

Outside the Primordial Pagoda, the battle was still going on!

The force of their battles caused the space here to tremble. But no matter how they fought, the space here didn’t shatter again, and it didn’t even crack open!

The space here was strong enough to endure the strength of Five World Realm experts now!

Bang!

Suddenly, an explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye and the Deathguard split apart. They flew over 1km away respectively and slammed into the ground, and then they rolled another 300m away after that!

Everywhere they passed, the ground was dyed blood red!

It was blood!

But it didn’t take long for them to stand up again, but their hands were trembling!

They gazed at each other from afar, and then they vanished on the spot.

Bang!

Space shook violently!

They were blasted away again. However, right at the instant Yang Ye’s figure was blasted away, the Deathguard suddenly stabbed his saber into the space in front of him.

Hiss!

The ethereal saber stabbed into space, and the Deathguard used the fortified space to stop himself! A moment later, he hurled his saber at Yang Ye with both hands.

Huss!

It shot through the air, causing ripples to arise in space.

A vicious glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes while his figure flew backward. At this moment, his figure suddenly turned ethereal.

The Sword Domain!

Once the Sword Domain was activated, the saber immediately started slowing down before him, but the energy it contained was extremely powerful and showed signs of breaking through Yang Ye’s domain!

Yang Ye grabbed his sword with both hands and stabbed it forward!

Hiss!

Space rippled in its wake!

Bang!

As soon as they collided, space started rippling like an earthquake was running through it.

The ethereal saber shook violently and vanished. Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword left his grasp and flashed forward as it stabbed at the Deathguard!

The Deathguard gazed at the sword with coldness and indifference in his eyes. When the sword arrived just around 10m away from him, he suddenly used his hand like a saber and chopped down at the sword.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Saber energy surged!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Explosions resounded in the sky.

A few breaths of time later, a figure was blasted out of the sky.

It was the Deathguard with the saber.

He slammed against the ground over 3km away, but it only took a moment for him to stand up again. As soon as he stood up, his face wasn’t calm anymore, and it was replaced with a ferocious and vicious expression!

The Deathguard clenched his fists, and the veins beneath his skin were trembling.

The Deathguard’s aura gradually grew stronger and stronger, and in just a short few breaths of time, his aura had multiplied by many times!

“It’s a secret bloodline technique!” Suddenly, Huang Ying’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Be careful Brother Yang, it’s a secret bloodline technique that allows them to forcefully improve their strength. You…”

He hadn’t even finished speaking when the Deathguard vanished on the spot, and then a 300m long ray of saber energy flashed.

It was beyond fast!

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted, and he instinctively raised his sword to stop it.

Boom!

The saber energy blasted Yang Ye over 10km away!

Yang Ye’s figure slammed into the ground while blood sprayed from his mouth. Besides that, his entire body had cracked open while blood sprayed from those cracks!

The Deathguard glanced coldly at Yang Ye, “Weak!”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly looked up, and then a powerful wave of intent surged out from him!

Madness intent!

The Mad Demon Bloodline!
