Chapter 19 – Inner Core

Right when Qing Hong was stunned on the spot, Yang Ye’s figure flashed to appear before Qing Hong.

Clang!

The Dark Iron Sword left its sheath and swiftly slashed at the Twin Wing Python that was right before him. Instantly, a strand of golden sword qi shot out violently from the tip of the Dark Iron Sword, and it instantly struck the Twin Wing Python’s head.

Bang!

At this moment, the extremely hard scales of the Twin Wing Python seemed like rotten wood that were instantly broken apart by that strand of golden sword qi from Yang Ye. The Twin Wing Python’s enormous figure was split into two, and it crashed to the ground and caused dust and dirt to suffuse the air.

When they witnessed this scene, Man’zi and Xiao Hei that were charging over from the side had stopped on the spot. Both their eyes stared blankly at the eight rank Twin Wing Python that had been slashed into two, and then they glanced at Yang Ye who stood with sword in hand. They were unable to recover from their shock for a long time.

Qing Hong who stood behind Yang Ye was the first to recover from her shock, and her beautiful eyes flickered with a strange glow as she gazed at Yang Ye’s seemingly thin figure from behind.

That scene from before was too shocking!

Actually, it wasn’t just Qing Hong and the others that were shocked, even Yang Ye himself was slightly shocked. He knew that his golden Profound Energy was formidable. After all, it could actually break through the defenses of an eight rank Darkbeast while it was still light gold in color. However, he’d never expected that this golden Profound Energy would actually be so terrifying, and it slashed the Twin Wing Python into two with a single strike.

After briefly pondering about it, Yang Ye had come to a rough understanding. It was undeniable that the might of the Profound Energy within his body had become even more formidable after it transformed, but it ought to be the contribution of the Energy Split Sword Technique that allowed him to split the Twin Wing Python into two. Otherwise, if he attacked with an ordinary method, then even though he would be able to break through the Twin Wing Python’s defenses, it would definitely not be so terrifying.

“Brother, Brother Yang. You’re a disciple of the Sword Sect, right?” Meanwhile, Man’zi and Xiao Hei had walked over to Yang Ye’s side, and Man’zi gazed at Yang Ye as he smiled bitterly and spoke. That scene from before was truly too shocking. All four of them who were at the ninth rank of the Mortal Realm were unable to break through the Twin Wing Python’s defenses, yet this Profounder at the seventh rank of the Mortal Realm standing before them was actually able to split the Twin Wing Python into two with a single sword strike. Needless to say, this was quite a blow to their confidence.

Yang Ye put the Dark Iron Sword away and shook his head before he said indifferently, “I’m not a disciple of the Sword Sect. Yes, I’m still not considered as one for now.” He didn’t have much of a good impression of these two men before him. Earlier, when he said that he was at the seventh rank of the Mortal Realm, even though Man’zi’s attitude wasn’t so terrible as Xiu Yuan, the cold attitude he revealed was extremely obvious.

Man’zi felt slightly embarrassed when he heard Yang Ye’s cold and indifferent tone. He knew that Xiu Yuan and his attitudes towards Yang Ye earlier had caused Yang Ye to not have a good impression of him. When he thought up to here, Man’zi couldn’t help but laugh bitterly because he’d allowed such an opportunity to become acquainted with an expert to slip him by.

Man’zi laughed bitterly and sighed before he glanced at the Twin Wing Python on the ground, and then he said, “Brother Yang, this Twin Wing Python....” This Twin Wing Python before him had been killed by Yang Ye, so it ought to belong to Yang Ye. Because they’d only asked Yang Ye to clean up the battlefield for them, and they didn’t allow Yang Ye to join their group. So, there was no agreement between them to share their gains equally.

When he thought up to here, the regret in Man’zi’s heart grew even deeper.

Yang Ye glanced at the Twin Wing Python and pondered deeply for a moment before he said, “If there’s an Inner Core, then give it to me, and all of you can have the rest.” Yang Ye definitely didn’t need money now, and the reason he wanted the Inner Core was that he was curious and had never seen an Inner Core in the past.

Man’zi was delighted in his heart upon hearing Yang Ye. He originally thought that they wouldn’t get a share of this Twin Wing Python, yet he’d never expected that Yang Ye only wanted the Inner Core. After all, besides the Inner Core, the Twin Wing Python’s skin was extremely valuable as well, and it could be considered as a great gain to the three of them.

After they thanked Yang Ye, Man’zi and Xiao Hei hurriedly started to dissect the Twin Wing Python.

Yang Ye paid no attention to Man’zi and Xiao Hei, and he turned around to look at Qing Hong instead. He really had quite a good impression of this sexy and likeable woman. He walked over slowly to her side, and when he noticed Qing Hong looking at him as if she was looking at a monster, he couldn’t help but rub his nose as he said with a smile, “What? What’re you looking at me like that for?”

Qing Hong withdrew her gaze and shook her head, and then she laughed bitterly and said, “I never imagined that you’re actually so strong. It was I who was meddlesome earlier.”

Qing Hong recalled how she’d repeatedly instructed Yang Ye not to leave her side before this, and her beautiful face couldn’t help but flush red.

“I intended to make a move, but you never allowed me to. So, you can’t blame me for that....” Yang Ye shrugged and smiled.

Qing Hong’s face flushed even redder when she heard Yang Ye, and she glared at him before she said, “Yes, I was meddlesome.” As she spoke, she walked over towards Man’zi and Xiao Hei, and she felt slightly aggrieved when she thought about how Yang Ye might be ridiculing her in his heart for overestimating her strength earlier.

When he noticed Qing Hong seemed to be slightly angry, Yang Ye hurriedly stood in Qing Hong’s path and said in a serious manner, “Big Sister Qing Hong, don’t be angry. I truly thank you for what you did before this, and I have no intention of ridiculing you. I really took you to be a friend.”

When she noticed Yang Ye’s serious expression, Qing Hong’s expression eased up. After that, she glanced at Yang Ye, and she blushed when she recalled her behavior from before. She said in her heart, What’s wrong with me? I actually cared so much about his opinion.

Qing Hong seemed to have thought of something, and her face turned even redder. However, after some time, she shook her head in her heart.

When he saw Qing Hong’s face blush and reveal a shy appearance, Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched while his heartbeat sped up as well. Qing Hong could be said to be the most beautiful woman he’s laid eyes upon until now. Her beautiful face, slender figure, and especially that ample chest that fully filled the beast skin she wore and seemed as if it was about to burst out from beneath the beast skin.

Yang Ye’s gaze moved down and descended onto Qing Hong’s exposed waist. Perhaps it was because she hunted Darkbeasts all year round, her skin wasn’t snow white like an ordinary woman, and it was a healthy cream color. Of course, her skin wasn’t the main point, the main point was the charm of Qing Hong’s waist. Her waist didn’t have a trace of excess flesh. It was flat and smooth, and one didn’t have to touch it to sense how soft it was.

A gorgeous and charming appearance, an ample chest, a slender and fine curvaceous body, and coupled with that set of beast skin top and skirt, Qing Hong’s entire body revealed a heroic and mature charm.

Earlier, he didn’t have any other thoughts about this beautiful woman, Qing Hong, nor had he observed her in detail. However, her kind actions from before had truly caused him to have a very good impression of her, and in his heart, Qing Hong was a person that could be his friend.

Yet now, after he observed Qing Hong from nearby, he noticed that this person who could be his friend was truly extremely beautiful and tempting.

When she noticed Yang Ye staring at her, Qing Hong’s expression instantly became slightly unnatural. She seemed to have thought of something, causing her eyeballs to spin while she revealed a charming smile and said, “Is Big Sister Qing Hong beautiful?”

When he heard this, Yang Ye who was admiring Qing Hong’s graceful figure had nodded instinctively. He’d just nodded when his heart jerked, and then he looked at Qing Hong and noticed she was looking at him with a spurious smile.

Yang Ye’s face turned red, and he rubbed his nose in embarrassment. He was just about to say something when Man’zi and Xiao Hei arrived before Yang Ye, and Man’zi withdrew a white pinky sized pearl and passed it to Yang Ye before he said, “Brother Yang, this is that Twin Wing Python’s Inner Core.”

After he received the white pearl, Yang Ye observed it carefully. The Inner Core was extremely small and completely pure white. Moreover, it emanated a strand of light energy fluctuations.

“What’re the uses of this Inner Core?” Yang Ye asked while gazing at the Inner Core in his hand.

Man’zi smiled and said, “Inner Cores have quite a bit of uses. They can be utilized to craft medicinal pills, and they can be fed to Darkbeasts. Of course, their greatest use is to be embedded in treasures. Of course, this required a Talisman Master to inscribe a formation on the treasure.”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched when he heard this. He’d never expected that the Inner Core could be used for that, and he placed it behind the clothes at his chest before he asked. “Right, all of you frequently hunt Darkbeasts in the Grand Myriad Mountains, so you ought to be comparatively familiar with the area in this Grand Myriad Mountains, right?”

Man’zi nodded and said, “We’re comparatively familiar with this area of 500km, but we don’t know anything about the area that exceeds this scope. Even some formidable mercenary groups don’t dare to go there because the Darkbeasts there are mostly already Beast Kings or even stronger.”

Beast Kings!

Yang Ye’s expression became slightly solemn when he heard this. A Beast King was comparable to a First Heaven Realm expert amongst humans, but its combat strength absolutely surpassed a human expert at the First Heaven Realm.

After staying silent for a while, Yang Ye asked. “How long more before we’ll leave Snake Forest?”

Yang Ye had already decided to look for some formidable Darkbeasts to fight because only battles with such Darkbeasts would allow his strength to improve, and he urgently required strength now.

Man’zi raised his head to determine the time, and then he said, “We’ll only be able to leave Snake Forest tomorrow, and we have to rest a night in Snake Forest today.”

“Rest in Snake Forest?” Yang Ye was stunned, and he said, “There are so many snakes in Snake Forest. Is it safe to rest here?”

“Stupid!” Qing Hong rolled her eyes at Yang Ye and said, “The leaves and branches of the trees in Snake Forest are tightly packed together, and even the moonlight wouldn’t be able to permeate through at night. It would be even more dangerous to travel blindly in the darkness.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Yang Ye rubbed his nose in embarrassment when he heard this. It was the first time that he’d come out to temper himself, and he wasn’t as familiar with all of this as they were. However, he was still slightly embarrassed from being called stupid.

When she saw Yang Ye’s embarrassed appearance, Qing Hong started laughing without restraint. At this moment, she’d perceived that even though Yang Ye’s strength was formidable, it was absolutely the first time he’d come to temper himself. So, if strength was disregarded, then Yang Ye was still extremely inexperienced in numerous aspects!
