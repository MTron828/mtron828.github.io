Chapter 2707 – Search for Yang Busi!

The End World.

Yang Ye walked forward slowly. Meanwhile, many had appeared around him. All of them were Destiny Realm experts.

However, there wasn’t a single one at the peak of the Destiny Realm!

Because all of them had gone after him at the Destiny Dimension!

Suddenly, a middle aged man appeared. The Divine Abode’s master.

He had an extremely unsightly expression on his face because all the peak Destiny Realm experts of the End World had left, and he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually leave the Destiny Dimension and come here!

He was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot.

The Divine Abode’s master’s expression changed drastically, “Attack together and keep him busy!”

A sharp pike appeared in his grasp as he spoke.

The pike shot forward.

Yang Ye’s sword arrived!

Crack!

The sound of something breaking resounded, and then Yang Ye appeared behind the Divine Abode’s master.

The Divine Abode’s master’s figure stiffened, and he looked forward with a slightly blank gaze in his eyes, “Impossible…”

A strand of blood sprayed from his throat.

Yang Ye spoke indifferently behind him, “I’ve wanted to kill you for a very long time, you old bastard!”

Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that shot off into the distance.

At the same time, a few rays of light suddenly shot out from the sword chest on his back and slashed down in various different directions.

The entire End World was in chaos!

A ray of light descended to the ground, and a bloody head rolled to the ground behind it.

In an instant, Yang Ye vanished on the spot again, and a ray of light shot into the air. A strand of blood suddenly rained down from the sky, and there was a bloody head falling with it!

A slaughter!

Ordinary Destiny Realm experts were nothing before Yang Ye!

Only peak Destiny Realm experts could fight Yang Ye, but Heng Wangu had practically taken all of them with him!

In other words, Yang Ye was a wolf who’d entered a flock of sheep!

So long as a ray of light flashed, there would be a bloody head rolling to the ground.

Just like that, Yang Ye charged and killed all along the way. He just killed anyone he saw. After all, there were only enemies here. Yang Ye killed all the way into the depths of the End World.

Suddenly, around seven Destiny Realm experts obstructed Yang Ye’s path!

Yang Ye didn’t say a word and just charged at them!

One against seven!

What he lacked the most right now was time. Because he couldn’t stay here for too long. If he did, Heng Wangu and the others would return, and then they would trap him here!

The seven of them didn’t retreat and charged at Yang Ye together.

A moment later, Yang Ye drew his sword and swung it!

At the same instant, five swords suddenly shot out from the sword chest on his back.

Meanwhile, another sword appeared in Yang Ye’s left grasp!

Past Life and Great Unknown!

Yang Ye charged at the Destiny Realm expert at the front of the group.

He swung both swords!

Deciding life and death with one attack!

In an instant, Yang Ye was already behind that Destiny Realm expert, and that expert’s body was sliced into four pieces!

Yang Ye flashed to the right and stabbed. The spear of the Destiny Realm expert in front of him was shooting straight for his throat!

The spear was longer than the sword!

However, the sword was faster than the spear!

Yang Ye’s sword moved up sideways as it traveled, slicing through the spear before Yang Ye pressed forward and slashed down again.

Hiss!

Yang Ye’s sword slashed down from the expert’s neck and blood sprayed all over Yang Ye!

Yang Ye twisted his wrist, and his sword shot out of that expert’s body. After that, he took a quick stride forward and slashed down.

Hiss!

…

Around 20 breaths of time later, there were a bunch of mutilated corpses behind Yang Ye.

Yang Ye sheathed his sword. While there were many Destiny Realm experts in the distance, he couldn’t continue anymore.

Because time didn’t allow it!

Yang Ye gazed at Snowy, and then he passed the sword chest to her, “You do it!”

Snowy blinked, and then she jumped off into the distance with the sword chest. A moment later, countless strands of spirit energy surged into it, and then sword howls gradually started to resound from the sword chest.

Meanwhile, Snowy patted the sword chest lightly.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Bang!

Five swords shot up into the air and the energy of the five elements appeared.

In an instant, the entire End World warped.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The entire End World started to shatter1

Yang Ye put the sword chest and the sword away, and then he withdrew Great Unknown and spoke softly, “I hope nothing bad happens!”

He took Snowy in his arms and vanished on the spot. At the moment he vanished, he looked into the distance, and he sensed like something was watching him!

Meanwhile, the End World collapsed once Yang Ye left!

The entire End World was gone!

A few breaths of time later, Heng Wangu and the others returned, and they had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces as they gazed at the pitch black expanse of space before them.

Even Heng Wangu who was usually calm and composed had an extremely gloomy expression on his face!

They’d been tricked!

He hadn’t expected Yang Ye to attack the End World. As far as he was concerned, Yang Ye should be fleeing! But Yang Ye hadn’t fled this time, Yang Ye had attacked the End World instead!

But how could the End World stop Yang Ye when they had all left?

It was a slaughter!

In that 15 minutes of time, Yang Ye had carried out a slaughter throughout the End World. Almost 20 Destiny Realm experts had lost their lives, and practically all of them had been killed in an instant!

Such strength and courage!

Heng Wangu closed his eyes slowly. He knew that he’d terribly underestimated Yang Ye’s courage and ruthlessness.

The surroundings fell silent.

First God gazed at the scene before him and no one knew what he was thinking.

Mo Yu’s face only had indifference on it.

Zuo Mu remained silent as always.

A long time later, Heng Wangu opened his eyes, “He taught us a lesson.”

He entered the pitch black expanse of space while he spoke, and it didn’t take long for him to arrive before a blood red rock.

The entire End World had been destroyed, but the rock still remained.

Heng Wangu suddenly asked, “Why didn’t you do anything?”

The voice spoke very calmly, “Are you questioning me?”

Heng Wangu shook his head, “The moment he came here was the best opportunity to act.”

The voice said, “I can’t do anything right now. The slightest mistake may end up spoiling everything! Only you can know about my existence!”

Heng Wangu spoke solemnly, “He’s difficult to deal with.”

The voice was quite cold, “So many of you can’t even deal with a kid?”

Heng Wangu shook his head, “He has the Great Unknown and refuses to go head-on against us.”

The voice fell silent for a long time. In the end, a pitch black flag floated out of the blood red rock.

Heng Wangu asked, “What is that?”

The voice replied, “A Boundary Flag. It can counter that sword.”

Heng Wangu glanced at it and said, “That’s the Great Unknown!”

The voice replied, “Unless all four swords merge into one, this flag can counter it!”

Heng Wangu nodded, “I understand!”

He turned around and left.

Heng Wangu went over to Mr. Jing. The latter hadn’t done anything when Yang Ye attacked because he knew it was pointless.

Even peak Destiny Realm experts had no chance of winning against Yang Ye if they didn’t gang up on him!

Especially when Yang Ye had two swords that surpassed Super Divine Treasures!

Yang Ye’s weapons had practically instantly obliterated the weapons of those Destiny Realm experts!

Heng Wangu said, “I’m counting on you again!”

Mr. Jing nodded, “I need some time. Two hours!”

Heng Wangu nodded, “Of course.”

He turned around and gazed at Zuo Mu, “Tell Li Taixu we agree to his conditions!”

Zuo Mu nodded slightly and left.

Heng Wangu gazed at Mo Yu and First God, “If you have any trump cards, please do not hold back anymore!”

Mo Yu and First God remained silent.

Heng Wangu gazed in the direction Yang Ye had fled toward, and there was a trace of worry in his eyes, “If we fail to kill him, we’re raising a monster instead.”

A monster!

He was very well aware that the relationship between prey and predator was likely to be switched at any time.

While they were hunting Yang Ye, it was equivalent to providing Yang Ye with tempering, and the pressure they exerted on him would help him grow madly… So, once they failed to kill him, their troubles were endless!

Meanwhile, Mo Yu suddenly said, “I know someone from the era of Destiny. She was imprisoned at the border of the Four Dimensional Universe after the strongest form of Destiny defeated her.”

Heng Wangu asked, “Destiny didn’t kill her?”

Mo Yu shook his head, “She couldn’t be killed!”

Heng Wangu was quite puzzled, “Huh?”

Mo Yu spoke solemnly, “Because she couldn’t be killed. She was a figure during the Yang Clan’s prime, Yang Busi!”

Yang Busi!

Heng Wangu frowned slightly, “Her surname is Yang? Is she related to Yang Ye?”

Mo Yu spoke indifferently, “Which era is she from? Which era is Yang Ye from? How could they possibly be connected?”

Heng Wangu fell silent for a short while and said, “We must be certain. We’ll be bringing disaster upon ourselves if she is related to Yang Ye.”

Mo Yu hesitated for a moment and said, “Too many have the same surname. There’s definitely no link between them. After all, the gap in time is too huge.”

Heng Wangu thought for a moment and said, “Go rescue her.”

Mo Yu shook his head, “The border of the Four Dimensional Universe is too dangerous.”

Heng Wangu fell silent for a short while, and then he left. A short while later, he returned with a blood red rune.

Heng Wangu said, “Lead the way!”

Mo Yu and the others glanced at Heng Wangu in silence.

A moment later, they vanished on the spot.
