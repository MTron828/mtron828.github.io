Chapter 2603

Backing?

It didn’t exist!

He was merely using the deterring effect Qi Bitian had! If the Destiny Realm expert of the Lu Clan did come for him, then it was obvious that he would run!

However, he was betting that expert would not dare to show themself!

Because he was very well aware that these powers were bound to be aware of Qi Bitian’s deeds at the Origin of Eternal Kingdom!

An existence who could kill Destiny Realm experts in an instant!

Regardless of whether it was the desolate race or Eternal Kingdom, they definitely didn’t dare to act carelessly in the slightest!

After all, just what if Qi Bitian took action again?

One always had to plan for every possibility!

Once she interfered, who could stop her?

It was why the Soul Master hadn’t come to the Soul Sect’s aid when Yang Ye almost killed the Soul Exalt.

After all, that mysterious power in the Origin had been annihilated because they’d sent a Destiny Realm expert to fight him.

But when that power hadn’t sent a Destiny Realm expert to battle, the young girl had never shown herself, even when Yang Ye was about to die!

Just that was enough to explain many things!

Lu Yanming and the others’ expressions were extremely unsightly because Yang Ye clearly wanted to bully them with the backing he possessed.

They’d done the same countless times in the past, yet now, someone was doing it to them.

Only they could truly experience what it felt like!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly smiled, “Looks like you don’t plan to give me justice! If that’s the case…”

The swords by Yang Ye’s side suddenly shook violently.

Lu Yanming and the others became visibly vigilant.

Justice?

The justice Yang Ye sought would absolutely bring humiliation to the Lu Clan. So, how could they possibly give it to him?

Fight!

Something unexpected occurred.

The space here suddenly warped, and then the scene before Yang Ye changed.

It turned pitch black!

At this moment, Yang Ye felt like he’d entered a dark expanse of space that was filled with only boundless darkness.

Obviously, it was a formation of the Lu Clan!

The Lu Clan had prepared a formation here just for him!

A sword shot forward from Yang Ye’s waist.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy slashed through the area before him!

However, there was only the sound of something being sliced apart and nothing else!

Yang Ye frowned slightly. A short while later, he closed his eyes slowly. After that, countless rays of sword energy and sword intent appeared around him.

The Sword Domain Sphere!

Along with its appearance, the space here was sliced apart. Even dark space could be instantly sliced into bits by his current strength!

However, the surroundings still remained pitch black!

Moreover, he heard some strange sounds too!

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted when he heard them!

He knew that this was no formation, this was the actual Darkspace!

The place Qi Bitian had accidentally brought him to that day! That terrifying world!

Yang Ye was shocked. He hadn’t expected the Lu Clan to have actually teleported him here!

Darkspawn!

Yang Ye stopped thinking about the Lu Clan. At this moment, he had to remain fully vigilant to face the Darkspawn in this space!

He’d almost been killed in an instant when he’d arrived here the last time!

Even though his strength had improved tremendously since then, he still wasn’t confident in being able to survive this place!

Suddenly, Yang Ye turned around. At the same time, he swung his sword with both hands.

Hiss!

It seemed like something was sliced apart!

But just a moment later, Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically. Because he sensed something pierce his chest. After that, his figure was blasted away!

Meanwhile, a strand of blood sprayed from his chest. However, it vanished without a trace as soon as it left his body!

But that wasn’t the end of it. Yang Ye felt himself become weightless, and he had nowhere to land. He was just floating, and he didn’t even have a spot to push himself against!

Yang Ye hurriedly calmed himself, and then two flying swords appeared behind him. After that, they pushed him to a stop!

Suddenly, he sensed an aura, and it was approaching him!

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to swing his sword!

This time, he used Executor. A shrill cry resounded once it descended, but Yang Ye didn’t even have the time to feel happy about his success because a powerful aura had suddenly slammed against his back.

Boom!

It was like a sledgehammer had struck him, and his figure was blasted away. During this period, the sound of air being torn apart resounded repeatedly, and these sounds were approaching rapidly. In the end, he felt like his body was being torn apart!

Yang Ye was shocked and hurriedly unleashed the Sword Domain Sphere!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Rays of dazzling sword energy erupted in this dark world, but it didn’t take long for them to be devoured by the darkness again!

Yang Ye stood on his sword while he had an extremely vigilant expression on his face. Even though he couldn’t see himself now, he knew that his body was covered in injuries!

There were many hidden and cold auras around him!

Yang Ye knew that the owners of these auras were staring at him right now!

They were staring coldly at him!

But he couldn’t see them, and even hear them!

He was utterly deaf and blind here!

He didn’t think about how to leave this place right now, all he thought about was how to survive!

Fortunately, the Primordial Pagoda hadn’t been taken from him. Otherwise, he would die here even if he had 10 lives!

Yang Ye remained vigilant at all times and didn’t dare act carelessly in the slightest!

Meanwhile in the East Region of Eternal Kingdom.

Once Yang Ye vanished, the experts of the Lu Clan heaved sighs of relief!

The pressure Yang Ye gave them was truly too overwhelming!

It wasn’t just because of Yang Ye’s formidable strength. There was one other reason, and it was his character! He was someone who was capable of almost anything!

Now, the Lu Clan clearly didn’t want to offend him, especially when a terrifying expert was supporting Yang Ye!

Sending him away was the best way to get rid of him!

An old man from the Lu Clan spoke from behind Lu Yanming, “Patriarch, we paid such a huge price to send him into Darkspace. What if he doesn’t die? We…”

Lu Yanming shook his head, “It’s impossible for him to survive that place. Even if he does, how will he return without a formation? Kill his way back? Haha! He is strong, but he isn’t that strong. Not to mention him, even a Destiny Realm expert wouldn’t dare to guarantee their ability to kill their way back from there!”

He glanced at the surroundings and said, “Let’s go! Death is guaranteed for him this time!”

They vanished on the spot.

Once they vanished, the formation which had sent Yang Ye away instantly closed. So, it was absolutely impossible for Yang Ye to use it and teleport back here!

…

Darkspace.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Horrifying sounds resounded incessantly through the pitch black world.

At this moment, Yang Ye was in a very terrible state!

An absolutely terrible state!

In this world, he felt like he had endless enemies, and he couldn’t even kill them!

Earlier, a Darkspawn had gotten close to him, and so he’d immediately unleashed the Sword Domain Sphere. However, he’d merely managed to heavily injure his enemy while he’d suffered a heavy blow instead. Even his body had almost been destroyed!

In the darkness.

The Darkspawn didn’t attack because while Yang Ye’s counterattacks had failed to kill them, his powerful sword energy and sword intent couldn’t be underestimated!

Exhaust him!

They planned to exhaust Yang Ye!

Yang Ye stood there in the distance while sword intent and sword energy covered him!

They were like a shield that was very useful to him. Because he could rely on his sword intent and sword energy to immediately sense any approaching Darkspawn!

Besides that, he was holding a sword in each hand, and Executor was above him.

Executor was defending the most important part of his body. It was because the Darkspawn were fond of launching surprise attacks at his head. But his head was unlike any other part of his body, and allowing them to succeed at attacking his head would be absolutely lethal!

The Darkspawn were very much afraid of Executor, and so they didn’t dare to rashly attack anymore!

Yang Ye tried his best to stay calm!

He was very well aware of the situation that he was in. Presently, he was in a place that even he didn’t know, and there was no one to help him here. Only he could help himself.

He had to survive!

Forget about leaving, the most important thing right now was to survive!

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and grinned ferociously. At this moment, his ferocity had been fully aroused!

He had never been a kind person.

If someone was evil to him, he would do worse!

Yang Ye stomped his right foot down, and then a ray of sword energy shot forward! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Three swords followed close behind it!

He took the initiative to attack!

Yang Ye was very well aware that he couldn’t enter into a battle of attrition with them. He had to attack and seize the initiative. These Darkspawn were extremely vicious, and he had to be even more vicious and crueler than them!

Otherwise, he would have no chance to survive!

The Darkspawn had clearly not expected Yang Ye to attack. However, they didn’t shrink back and grew even more ferocious.

A moment later, strange cries resounded incessantly, and then Yang Ye’s sword energy started to be obliterated, one after the other…

Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye was blasted away with a ray of sword energy. However, at the exact same instant, Yang Ye grabbed a broken horn with his left hand. It was a pitch black horn that had stabbed into his stomach.

Blood sprayed out like a fountain!

Yang Ye’s mind went blank for a moment, but it didn’t take him long to bite his tongue and clear his mind.

Meanwhile, more and more Darkspawn were charging at him from all directions!

Two swords flashed incessantly on both sides of him as they stopped the approach of the Darkspawn!

Yang Ye held an intent sword with both hands and defended himself.

Clang!

Suddenly, a clear and loud sound of something breaking resounded!

Yang Ye’s figure stiffened.

Not too far away from him, a sword had snapped…
