Chapter 506 – Putting On A Show Of Arrogance!

“Even though Yang Ye’s strength is formidable, he would absolutely not dare to show himself without a disguise at Martial World City. So, we just have to find him in the city, and the only way to do that is by elimination. In other words, we have to specially look for those profounders who conceal their appearances. In that way, it would naturally shrink down the scope of our search!”

Yang Ye’s group had just walked into the Pavilion of Indulgence when words that caused Yang Ye’s eyelids to twitch resounded through the hall here. Yang Ye looked over towards the source of the voice, and he noticed that it was a young man who spoke those words. The young man wore a brown colored robe, had a sword hanging on his waist, and there was a tiny ‘Ascension’ embroidered on his left shoulder!

Obviously, that young man was a disciple of the Ascension Sect because Yang Ye had killed a few people from that sect, and all of their clothes had the same word embroidered on it!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and noticed that there were actually over 1,000 profounders here. Moreover, practically 90% of them were at the Spirit Realm! It was even to the extent that he noticed some obscure auras. Obviously, they belonged to Exalt Realm experts! The corners of Yang Ye mouth couldn’t help but twitch when he thought of how they’d come to kill him. Money really does make the mare go!

“Profounders who conceal their appearances? Oh, isn’t there one here right now?” Seated opposite the young man from the Ascension Sect was a man whose clothes were embroidered with a sword, and he glanced at Yang Ye who’d just walked into the hall and spoke sarcastically.

Many people looked over towards Yang Ye when they heard this!

Meanwhile, Lu He hurriedly took a step forward and cupped his fists to them. “Everyone, I’m Lu He from the Clear River Sect, and this is a friend of mine. He’s a talisman master, and the reason he has concealed his appearance is merely for the sake of avoiding potential problems. You should be aware that talisman masters have slightly strange dispositions!”

The expressions of many changed a little when they heard that Lu He was from the Clear River Sect. After all, it was a Ninth Rank Sect. So, not just anyone could offend him. Coupled with the fact that Lu He said Yang Ye was a talisman master, the gazes of many merely stopped on Yang Ye for a moment before they moved away. They didn’t feel that a disciple of the Clear River Sect would collude with Yang Ye!

The young man with the sword embroidered on his clothes continued. “I think that it doesn’t matter who the person is. We should treat all profounders within the city equally in order to accurately locate Yang Ye and prevent him from taking advantage of the situation in the city. After all, it’s better to be safe than sorry, right?”

“I agree!” That disciple from the Ascension Sect glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Lu He, even though my Ascension Sect and your Clear River Sect aren’t really friendly with each other, I’m not targeting you on purpose this time. After all, if Yang Ye were to sneak his way into our group and succeeds in deceiving us, then it would be an extraordinary humiliation to all of us, right?”

“Brother Ye Cheng is right, it’s best for all of us to be cautious at a time like this. We can’t allow Yang Ye to sneak into our group!” Someone else chimed in.

“Indeed. If we were to start a grand search for Yang Ye yet he was right by our side, then wouldn’t we bring shame to our sects and all the profounders of the central territory?”

“Why be such hypocrites? Wouldn’t it be easier to just remove his cloak and let everyone see his appearance?”

“Remove it, remove it....”

Obviously, that disciple from the Ascension Sect called Ye Chen had a very good reputation, and his worlds caused the gazes of many to descend onto Yang Ye. Moreover, all of these gazes carried hostility!

Lu He’s expression was slightly unsightly. He was just about to speak when Yang Ye walked over to the center of the hall, and then he glanced at the crowd which was making noise about removing his cloak. He said, “You want to remove my cloak? Come do it if you have the ability!” As he spoke, Yang Ye gazed at the young man who had a sword embroidered on the chest area of his clothes!

It wasn’t just Lu He’s expression that changed upon hearing this, the others in the surroundings were the same.

Lu He wanted to say something, but he hesitated for a moment and didn’t say anything in the end. He just moved aside because even he wanted to witness this fellow, Ye Yang’s, true strength.

Ye Cheng’s eyes narrowed as his left hand descended onto the hilt of his sword. He hesitated for a moment yet didn’t choose to attack in the end. He glanced at the young man with the sword embroidered on his chest and said, “Yu Cangming, he’s provoking your Divine Sword Sect. Of course, I can help you fight him if you have any worries, but you’ll have to owe me a favor!”

Yu Cangming grunted coldly, and then he gazed at Yang Ye and said, “I presume you have something to rely on since you dared to speak so arrogantly. However, it doesn’t matter because I don’t care at all. Speak of your sect and background. Let me see if I should spare your lowly life. After all, I don’t want to make the matter irreconcilable between people like us who possess status!”

“Cut the crap and just come remove my cloak!” Yang Ye acted very arrogantly and gestured at Yu Cangming to come at him. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“You’re courting death!” Yu Cangming was furious, and a sword appeared in his grasp. He was just about to attack when Yang Ye suddenly said, “Wait!”

“Tch!” The others in the surroundings thought that Yang Ye was going to go back on his word, and they instantly started laughing with ridicule and disdain.

“What, are you afraid?” Dense disdain appeared on the corners of Yu Cangming’s mouth.

“I have to make preparations!” Yang Ye flipped his right hand as he spoke, and then a stack of talismans appeared there. Based on the thickness of it, there were probably over 20 there. After that, Yang Ye picked them up one by one and slapped them on his body while the others watched with astonishment. Moreover, he even spoke as he slapped them on himself. “This is a top-grade strength talisman, this is a top-grade strider talisman, this is a top-grade defensive talisman, this is a top-grade healing talisman, this is a top-grade transmission talisman. Oh, I took the wrong talisman. This isn’t how transmission talismans are used....”

The corners of everyone’s mouths twitched while their hearts felt like it was being torn apart. Top-grade talismans, those are top-grade talisman. This fellow actually possesses so many top-grade talismans, and they are being wasted just like that! What a waste! The eyes of many had turned red as they gazed at Yang Ye, and they wished for nothing more than to charge over and bash Yang Ye up!

Ye Cheng and Yu Cangming’s expressions had become unsightly. They’d doubted this cloaked fellow’s identity just now. However, at this moment, they had no choice but to admit that he was definitely a talisman master. Because only talisman masters were able to waste talismans in such a lavish manner. In any case, even they who were core disciples of their sects weren’t able to use talismans in such a lavish manner. Moreover, all of those talismans were at the top-grade!

It’s absolutely impossible for an ordinary person to use so many top-grade talismans at one time, even the princes of the Exalted Han Empire can’t! In other words, this cloaked fellow’s identity is absolutely not ordinary!

Ye Cheng couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief when he thought up to this point, and he felt fortunate that he hadn’t been the first to step forward! On the other hand, Yu Cangming’s expression was unsightly because he knew that he was the first to step forward, and he would have the bear the brunt of it!

“I think that there’s no need to prove your identity anymore. It was I who was rash!” Yu Cangming cupped his hands towards Yang Ye, and it could be considered as a form of compromise.

“Rash? Forget it, let me give you a good beating first!” As soon as he spoke, Yang Ye stomped the ground with his right foot and didn’t utilize any movement techniques. He merely used the propulsion from exerting his physical strength onto the ground to shoot forward like a cannonball, and he instantly arrived in front of Yu Cangming. The latter was astounded and was just about to draw his sword when Yang Ye’s fist had smashed onto his chest.

Pu!

A mouthful of blood sprayed from Yu Cangming’s mouth while his figure curved as it flew backward!

Bang!

Yu Cangming flew for over 100m before his figure smashed against the wall. The iron wall behind him instantly trembled while another mouthful of blood sprayed from Yu Cangming’s mouth as his figure fell to the ground. After that, his head tilted to the side as he fell unconscious!

Everyone in the surroundings was shocked!

Ye Cheng’s expression changed. He looked at Yang Ye with a solemn gaze while dense fear could be seen in the depths of his eyes.

Lu He and the others in his group were delighted because Ye Yang’s strength had far exceeded their expectations. In their opinion, the stronger Ye Yang was, the more beneficial it would be to them!

Yang Ye glanced at Yu Cangming who laid unconscious there, and then he shook his head and said, “I never expected you would be so weak. If you were so weak, then couldn’t you have kept a lower profile?” As soon as he finished speaking, he glanced at everyone in the surroundings and said, “Does anyone else want to remove my cloak? If there is, then don’t waste my time and just step forward!”

All of them remained silent, including Ye Cheng!

Yang Ye relaxed his clenched fists and said, “Since there’s no one else, then just do what you were doing!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye returned to Lu He and the others.

The strong were respected on Profounder Continent. So, one had to possess formidable strength in order to obtain the fear and respect of others. The reason Yang Ye had acted against Yu Cangming like that was merely just to make an example of him. Because the gazes of everyone had descended onto him, so they would feel even more suspicious of him unless he removed his cloak. Of course, there was another method to deal with the situation, and it was to deter them with strength!

Obviously, that method was really good because only a few people here dared to look at him!

Ye Cheng glanced at Yang Ye before he moved his gaze away, and then he looked at everyone else and said, “Everyone, I know that all of you want to kill Yang Ye and even want to claim the Exalted Han Empire’s reward on your own. However, I have to advise all of you that while Yang Ye is only a Spirit Realm profounder, it isn’t difficult at all for him to kill ordinary Exalt Realm experts. So, if all of you don’t want to die, then immediately notify everyone else once you’ve found Yang Ye. Don’t do anything stupid. You can only claim the Exalted Han Empire’s reward when you’re alive, otherwise, you’ll just be giving your life away for nothing!”

“Finding Yang Ye in the boundless ocean of people here isn’t easy at all!” said one of them.

“It isn’t very difficult!” Ye Cheng said, “Because everyone in Martial World City is looking for him. Not to mention Yang Ye, even anyone suspicious would be in trouble! Our job is to find such suspicious people. Moreover, Yang Ye would definitely be trying to leave the city during this period of time because once he leaves the city, then he wouldn’t have to fear us at all no matter how many members we possess in our group! So, we can send people to wait for him to show himself at the four city gates while the others search within the city!”

“That works. Come, we’ll go to the northern city gate!”

“Then we’ll take the southern city gate!”

“We’ll take the eastern....”

“We have no choice but to take the western....”

“Yang Ye is here!” Right at this moment, a sharp cry suddenly sounded out from outside the hall, and it instantly caused everyone here to be stirred!
