Chapter 1220 – You Reap What You Sow!

The old man hadn’t noticed the grin which curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth once his soul entered the center of Yang Ye’s forehead.

As soon as the old man’s soul entered through the center of Yang Ye’s forehead, he started to seize control over Yang Ye’s body. The first thing he did was attempt to devour Yang Ye’s soul.

However, the tiny vortex within Yang Ye suddenly started to spin madly.

It didn’t take long for the old man’s astonished voice to resound within Yang Ye’s mind, “What’s that? What is that? What the heck is that? AH!!! What the hell is that!? Make it stop! Quickly make it stop!”

The old man’s incessant begging resounded in Yang Ye’s mind.

Was Yang Ye a fool? He was naturally not a fool! So, the tiny vortex spun even faster than before.

“AH!!! AH!!! Quickly! Quickly make it stop!!” The old man’s voice sounded like a shrill cry this time.

The old man’s voice weakened slowly. Around 15 minutes later, the old man’s voice couldn’t be heard at all. Meanwhile, Yang Ye opened his eyes slowly, and a wisp of ridicule arose on the corners of his mouth as he gazed at the old man’s corpse, “You reap what you sow!”

Was the old man very strong? Yes, extremely strong!

It could be said that unless he executed the true form of Heavenrend and the Qiong Qi woke up, otherwise he wouldn’t be a match for the old man at all. However, he hadn’t expected that the old man actually wanted to seize his body! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

That was absolutely good news to Yang Ye! Why? Because the old man was courting death.

If it was a battle in the outside world, then it would probably be impossible for him to resist the old man even if he utilized the tiny vortex. Because its strength and injuries hadn’t been restored completely. After all, it had to rely on Lady’s help to suppress and seal Qiong Qi that day. But the old man was definitely stronger than Qiong Qi was in his injured state that day!

However, Yang Ye had never expected the old man would actually make his soul leave his own body and try to seize Yang Ye’s body!

Once the soul left the body, while it still possessed a certain amount of strength, that strength was at least 70 or 80% weaker than what it was. Because without the body to act as a medium, unless it was an expert who specialized in the cultivation of the soul, it would be impossible for the soul of that expert to execute any techniques. On the other hand, Yang Ye’s body was the tiny vortex’s territory. So, wasn’t the old man courting death?

Of course, if he didn’t have the tiny vortex, then the old man would have a huge chance at success. Because Yang Ye’s soul couldn’t resist the old man’s soul at all. But the problem was he possessed the tiny vortex!

Erased from existence!

That was the fate that the old man suffered.

Such a method of death might not have ever occurred throughout the history of Dark Hell Continent!

Yang Ye sized up the old man’s corpse, shook his head, and said to himself, What a pity!

Because the old man’s corpse couldn’t be refined into a Sword Servant. He needed the soul to be intact in order to refine the corpse into a Sword Servant. He needed a soul that didn’t possess a consciousness of its own. But the corpse before him had no soul, so it was impossible to refine it into a Sword Servant.

A Sword Servant at the Voider Realm was gone just like that!

Yang Ye didn’t just feel that it was a pity, his heart hurt!

After feeling regretful for some time, Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto the spatial ring on the old man’s finger. He waved his hand, and it flew into his grasp. Yang Ye gazed at it and spoke softly, “I hope there are some nice treasures in there!”

As he spoke, his divine sense swept through it, and then Yang Ye was stunned. Because his divine sense was actually unable to see through it!

Yang Ye looked at it carefully. He noticed that the spatial ring had a spirit barrier within it. Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment before he flicked over a strand of sword intent that enveloped the spatial ring. Around 10 minutes passed before a slight crack arose from it. A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth when he heard that sound, and his divine sense entered the spatial ring.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye’s smile to widen.

Because the spatial ring actually had 30,000 violet crystals within it! Besides that, there was a golden spear and a golden axe. Both of them were Quasi Emperor Rank weapons!

Even though the rest of the treasures within the spatial ring weren’t bad, they were beneath his notice.

“Such treasures!” Yang Ye put the spatial ring away and glanced at the surroundings, and then his figure flashed down to the ground. He hadn’t chosen to leave because he felt that he was about to advance!

It wasn’t because he wanted to; it was merely because his accumulations had arrived at a certain level....

What was the fastest way to improve one’s strength? It isn’t meditating and cultivating, of course! It was battle! Battle was the fastest way to improve one’s strength. Which extraordinary genius hadn’t experienced hundreds of battle? Yang Ye was the same. Not to mention the battles of the past, even if just the present was considered, he’d practically never stopped fighting since he arrived at this world!

Actually, such frequent battles were extremely beneficial to him. Because it didn’t just improve his combat experience, it was even able to constantly stimulate the potential within him.

Yang Ye didn’t charge into the Quasi Emperor Realm, and he suppressed himself instead!

Even though advancing into a mid-rank Saint would improve his strength tremendously, if he were to look at it in terms of his long-term interests, then the disadvantages would actually outweigh the benefits. He naturally believed what Lady told him. The important matter at hand for him wasn’t to charge into the Quasi Emperor or Emperor Realm, and it was to consolidate his foundation. Once his foundation was consolidated, advancing his realm of cultivation wouldn’t be difficult at all.

After all, there was no Eye of the Heaven Dao to obstruct him here!

Yang Ye’s aura was growing incessantly, but it didn’t take long for his aura to be suppressed. However, just a while passed before his aura grew once more.... Just like that, Yang Ye’s aura entered into an incessant cycle of growing and being suppressed.

Actually, his foundation was extremely solid when compared to many. However, it was much inferior when compared to those top-rate geniuses like Lady.

For the sake of preventing any potential troubles from arising in the future, he had to suppress himself for now!

Countless people in this world wished for nothing more than to see their strength improve quickly, and it was even to the extent that they stopped at nothing in order to improve their cultivation. While one couldn’t say that none acted like Yang Ye and intentionally suppressed themselves from advancing, it was absolutely rare.

Just like that, time trickled by....
