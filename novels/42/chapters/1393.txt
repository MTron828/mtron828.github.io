Chapter 1394 – Misfortune!

Who was she?

Yang Ye had met her before, of course. Moreover, it wasn’t even very long ago. Because she was actually that face which Nether Maiden and the others had been suppressing!

A ghastly pale countenance, blood red eyes, hair that emanated faint violet colored baleful energy. Just a little while ago, she was emanating extremely terrifying resentment, and even his sword intent was barely able to defend him against it.

Slaughter intent, resentment, and baleful energy!

She seemed like the entire world owed her billions!

After a moment of shock, it didn’t take long for ferocity to cover Yang Ye’s face. Nether Maiden and the others had been suppressing her, yet now, she’d taken human form. In other words, something happened to Nether Maiden and the others?

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “Where are they?” At the same time, the Sword God’s Seal lit up on his forehead.

She glanced at his forehead, pondered deeply for an instant, and then suddenly stretched out her hand and tapped her finger against his forehead. In an instant, the Sword God’s Seal fell silent.

Yang Ye was shocked. Meanwhile, Nether Maiden appeared by his side, and then the pig-riding young woman, Boundary Maiden, Ice Maiden, Light Maiden, and Oblivion Maiden appeared in front of him.

Yang Ye’s eyes were filled with bewilderment, “What...?”

Meanwhile, Nether Maiden spoke, “Remember what I told you about a hall master of my Nether Pavilion suffering a blood sentence?”

Yang Ye nodded as he naturally remembered.

Nether Maiden walked over to the woman who was full of resentment, “She’s that hall master who suffered a blood sentence, and she’s our 4th sister, Resentment Maiden.”

Yang Ye’s mind was filled with questions, “Isn’t she dead?”

Nether Maiden shook her head, “She didn’t die. We used a special method to protect her.”

Yang Ye said, “I’m still quite confused. Based on the strength all of you possessed, the Alliance of Guardians wouldn’t have been able to harm you at all. But you were forced into such a situation all those years ago....”

Nether Maiden replied, “We did it on purpose!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Nether Maiden glanced at Resentment Maiden, and the latter nodded slightly before Nether Maiden continued, “Fourth Sister possesses the Heaven’s Envy Physique, so she lived a life of being punished by the heavens. There’s something absolutely terrifying about this physique, and it’s that even if she dies, it’ll follow her to her next life. So, she’s bound by misfortune for lifetimes and targeted by the Heaven Dao for lifetimes. However, once 10 lifetimes pass, her physique will undergo a transformation.”

Yang Ye frowned, “A transformation?”

Nether Maiden nodded, “Once 10 lifetimes are over, the Heaven Dao won’t just cease to target her, she’ll even gain control over the energy of misfortune.”

Nether Maiden paused for a moment at this point and continued, “The energy of misfortune.... Let me explain it like this. If Fourth Sister were to use it against you, then you’ll suffer absolute misfortune from now on. Moreover, regardless of where you go, the Eye of the Heaven Dao will immediately descend upon you if your aura is exposed in the slightest, and it’ll stop at nothing to kill you!”

Yang Ye was visibly moved. The energy of misfortune.... Absolute misfortune and even being pursued to death by the Eye of the Heaven Dao. Just thinking about it was quite terrifying! Even though the Eye of the Heaven Dao targeted him as well, it was under the circumstances that he killed others. But once he was affected by the energy of misfortune, then he didn’t even have to kill because just exposing his aura would make the Eye of the Heaven Dao come looking for him!

In other words, Resentment Maiden could use the Eye of the Heaven Dao and make it her ally.

Meanwhile, Nether Maiden added, “Understand? After the 10th lifetime passes, Fourth Sister is able to forcefully extract the energy of misfortune within her and control it. Of course, experiencing 10 lifetimes isn’t the only requirement to control the energy of misfortune. For the sake of taking control of the energy of misfortune, Fourth Sister didn’t hesitate to enter the cycle of reincarnation for 10 lifetimes, and she suffered the most painful torture in the world throughout every lifetime of hers.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Nether Maiden fell silent when she spoke up to this point.

The pig-riding young woman lowered her head slightly and remained silent.

Meanwhile, Resentment Maiden shook her head slightly, “There’s no need to be sad about that. If I had resolved to enter the cycle of reincarnation earlier, that wouldn’t have happened to Eldest Sister and Second Sister.”

Yang Ye asked, “Then why was she like that just now?” Resentment Maiden was in the form of a face earlier, and she seemed to not recognize Nether Maiden and the others.

Resentment Maiden suddenly said, “Tell the little fellow everything!”

Little fellow.... Yang Ye’s face was quite dark.

Nether Maiden nodded, “Fourth Sister’s consciousness was in battle with the energy of misfortune, so she wasn’t conscious at all. She was being controlled by her negative emotions just now. We didn’t dare to let her leave because we were afraid that she would go to a medium world. After all, once she entered a medium world, the Eye of the Heaven Dao would appear. Once the Eye of the Heaven Dao of a medium world appears, then the suffering she endured for the last 10 lifetimes of hers would be wasted.”

So that’s why! Yang Ye finally came to an understanding when he heard her. Simply speaking, Resentment Maiden’s death had been done on purpose, and the reason they’d gathered in the Radiant Dimension was to wait for Resentment Maiden to come back to life.

Yang Ye asked, “Then what about those fellows from the large world?”

Their expressions instantly turned cold when they heard Yang Ye.

Nether Maiden spoke in a low voice, “They naturally don’t want Fourth Sister to take control of the energy of misfortune. So, they started to act against us a while back. However, because of the restrictions of the Supreme Heaven Dao, they weren’t able to send true experts down here, nor did they dare to do so. After all, they wouldn’t dare to face Third Sister once they descend here and suffer a huge decline in their cultivations.” The pig-riding young woman said, “Our current strength really is insufficient to fight them in the large world, but if they come down here and have their cultivations restrained, then they might perish. They dare not take such a gamble. So, they had no choice but to play such tricks.”

“Actually, it was all thanks to you!” Meanwhile, Nether Maiden said, “We misjudged our strength a little. We thought just Boundary Maiden and Ice Maiden would be able to suppress Fourth Sister, but we far underestimated her ability. So, she was almost able to escape. Once that happened, the consequences would be unimaginable. The consequences would have been unimaginable if you weren’t able to stop all those fellows.

All of them gazed at Yang Ye. While they didn’t speak, there was a trace of acknowledgement in their eyes.

Actually, they’d helped Yang Ye previously because of Nether Maiden. Because he was friends with her, they gave her face and helped him while he was in the Radiant Dimension. Yet now, they truly acknowledged him and treated him as one of their own.

Because if it wasn’t for Yang Ye, they would have been in huge trouble. Of course, the main reason was they felt that Yang Ye was a really good friend. After all, he hadn’t chosen to leave under such circumstances, and it proved that Nether Maiden hadn’t misjudged him. Actually, they didn’t have a good impression of Yang Ye because they were afraid that Nether Maiden was a bad judge of character. But now it would seem like Yang Ye was quite a good guy.

Yang Ye smiled, “We’re all friends, so there’s no need for that!” He wasn’t being polite because Nether Maiden was a friend that he’d gone through life and death with. Moreover, the Nether Pavilion had helped him in the past. It wasn’t just on Radiant Dimension; he’d even received help on Dark Hell Continent. So, if the Nether Pavilion was in trouble, he would absolutely not stand by idly.

Nether Maiden glanced at him and remained silent.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something and said, “Er, the Nether Pavilion has 10 halls, and that Shadow Maiden....” He still remembered how he’d killed a Shadow Maiden in the Radiant Dimension.

All of them gazed at Yang Ye when they heard this.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched, “Er, I....”

Meanwhile, Nether Maiden said, “She wasn’t the real Shadow Maiden!”

Yang Ye was astounded, “She wasn’t?”

Nether Maiden nodded, “If it was the true Shadow Maiden, you wouldn’t have been able to kill her. We’d thought she was the real Shadow Maiden, so we’d sent our forces to look for her in Pine Prefecture. But later on, we realized that she was just someone who’d comprehended the Laws of Darkness like Shadow Maiden.” She glanced at Yang Ye and continued, “If she was the real Shadow Maiden, you wouldn’t have just been unable to kill her, you might have been in danger instead.”

“Really?” Yang Ye continued, “The Laws of Darkness aren’t that strong!” He wasn’t lying because his Laws of Darkness were quite useless right now. Especially when he was up against Voiders.

Nether Maiden shook her head and said, “Shadow Maiden doesn’t just possess the Laws of Darkness. In short, if you have the chance to meet her, you’ll understand.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he glanced at them and said, “Blind Maiden, Resentment Maiden, Boundary Maiden, Shadow Maiden, Oblivion Maiden, Nether Maiden, Ice Maiden, Light Maiden, and that fellow who rides a pig. If your eldest sister and second sister are included, then... if I didn’t make a mistake in my calculation, aren’t there more than 10 of you?”

He’d heard from Nether Maiden that the Nether Pavilion only had 10 halls and 10 hall masters. Yet now, there was an extra one.

Nether Maiden and the others gazed at the pig-riding young woman, and then the latter spoke indifferently, “I’m not from the Nether Pavilion.”

Nether Maiden said, “She’s Second Sister’s younger sister. She survived all those years ago, so she has been following us ever since.”

“So that’s why!” Yang Ye nodded, “I understand everything now. I have no further questions.”

“All of you are from the large world!” Meanwhile, the old man in linen robes spoke abruptly. If he could, he naturally wanted to leave. But not to mention leaving, he couldn’t even move right now.

Resentment Maiden shot a glance at him. She didn’t say a word and just waved her hand lightly, and then a ray of red light swept out and obliterated the old man.

Yang Ye was visibly moved. She’s really strong and absolutely not inferior to Jian Xu. Perhaps she’s only slightly inferior to Blind Maiden!Meanwhile, Nether Maiden said, “We’re leaving!”

Yang Ye immediately asked, “Where to?”

“To look for our eldest sister and second sister.” Nether Maiden continued, “Boundary Maiden has found Shadow Maiden, so only our second sister and eldest sister are left. We can return to the large world once we find them.”

They are going to return to the large world! Yang Ye was shocked. He naturally didn’t think that they were heading back there to enjoy the scenery. He didn’t know what exactly had occurred in the past, but he knew that a storm of blood would definitely sweep through the large world once they returned.

Suddenly, a powerful aura appeared in the sky above the Radiant Dimension. Of course, it was very weak in Resentment Maiden’s eyes.

It didn’t take long for a man to appear before them. The man glanced through the surroundings, and his gaze locked onto Yang Ye in the end, “You’re that fellow, Yang Ye, right? Lian Suyao wasn’t lying, you really are heavily injured. Hmm? These women by your side are probably those women from the Nether Pavilion, right? Nice, I can get all of you in one fell swoop. A few dozen permits! Hahaha! I....”

He seemed to have noticed something at this point, and his voice stopped abruptly.
