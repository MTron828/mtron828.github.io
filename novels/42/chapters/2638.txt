Chapter 2639 – Unexpected Turn!

Yang Ye stood up slowly on the mountain peak.

A wave of powerful aura swept out from him like the tide, and it instantly caused the space in a huge area around him to ripple violently.

Yang Ye raised his right hand lightly, and then the space around him returned to normal.

Yang Ye looked up at the sky and grinned.

The Destiny Realm!

This time, he’d advanced from the Lord Realm to the Destiny Realm!

After speaking to the woman in white, he’d gained some comprehension, and once he returned to the Ancient Sword Sect, he started to use the book and his own dual Domains to sense the world and everything in it. In the beginning, he was relying on his Domains a little, but in the end, he gave up on using his Domains. Unexpectedly, he could transcend Three Dimensional Space without his Domains, and if he used the Domains, he could even come into contact with many types of space.

These different types of space were between Three Dimensional Space and Four Dimensional Space. Or perhaps it should be said that they were a platform for one to enter Four Dimensional Space.

However, he didn’t dare to explore further.

Because they felt extremely dangerous to him, and the slightest mistake may lead to his death!

The Destiny Realm!

Some said that the Destiny Realm allowed one to sense Destiny!

However, it actually meant that attaining the Destiny Realm allowed one to sense a little of Four Dimensional Space.

Yang Ye looked up at the sky. The woman in white and her other forms refused to allow anyone to enter Four Dimensional Space.

He was quite puzzled by this because even someone as powerful as the Desolate Emperor had perished from entering Four Dimensional Space.

A long time later, Yang Ye shook his head. He didn’t really want to care about all of that. He just wanted everyone around him to be fine. As for the Four Dimensional Space, he didn’t care about it at all.

Yang Ye left the Ancient Sword Sect, and he went to the Ye Clan to send Ye Zhibei home.

The Ye Clan grew quite anxious when Yang Ye arrived. After all, his current status was quite special.

It was the Ye Clan’s ancestor, Ye Zhitian, who came to greet Yang Ye.

He had a rather complicated expression on his face when he saw Yang Ye.

Yang Ye cupped his fist and said, “Zhibei won’t be in any trouble if she returns, right?”

Ye Zhitian shook his head, “Thank you for lending a hand. Don’t worry, she won’t be in any trouble here.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly and gazed at Ye Zhibei, “Visit the Ancient Sword Sect when you’re free.”

She nodded slightly. She wanted to say something, but she didn’t say anything in the end.

Yang Ye smiled and was about to leave, but Ye Zhitian suddenly spoke, “Be careful of the people from that place. According to my knowledge, that place is about to collapse. I’m sure you’re aware that some of the people there are at the peak of the Destiny Realm, and some may have even surpassed the Destiny Realm in strength alone. Without that place to suppress their cultivation, they won’t be able to hide themselves, and that represents that Destiny may notice their presence! However, the Sprite Progenitor with you can help them. So, they will definitely target the Sprite Progenitor!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Thank you for the warning. Farewell!”

Yang Ye leaped up on his sword and vanished into the sky.

Ye Zhitian sighed softly on the spot, “He has it hard too…”

…

Once he left the Ye Clan, Yang Ye immediately headed for the Xing Clan.

At the entrance to the Xing Clan, Yang Ye was greeted by the current patriarch of the Xing Clan, Xing Ren. However, he wasn’t very friendly!

Yang Ye gazed at Xing Biqing, and she remained silent.

Yang Ye gazed at Xing Ren and said, “She’ll be fine and well in the Xing Clan, right?”

Xing Ren replied indifferently, “That’s none of your business.”

As soon as he said that, half of Yang Ye’s hair turned blood red, and a wave of monstrous slaughter intent instantly enveloped the Xing Clan!

At this moment, everyone in the Xing Clan was shocked!

Xing Ren’s expression changed as well, “Yang Ye, what the heck are you doing?”

“What am I doing?” Yang Ye’s face was rather ferocious, “I’ll ask you one last time. Will she be fine and well in the Xing Clan?”

Xing Ren’s face was extremely unsightly.

Meanwhile, many in the Xing Clan had been corrupted by Yang Ye’s slaughter intent, and the entire Xing Clan was in chaos.

Even though they knew Yang Ye was the culprit, no one dared to attack him!

They didn’t dare!

Presently, no power in Eternal Kingdom dared to act against Yang Ye on its own.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly chuckled, “It’s fine, I can wait.”

Once he finished speaking, his slaughter intent grew thicker. Now, even Xing Ren found it quite difficult to resist.

Xing Ren was astounded, and he hurriedly suppressed the slaughter intent while shouting furiously, “Yang Ye, don’t go too far!”

Yang Ye ignored Xing Ren and continued releasing his slaughter intent. Meanwhile, many members of the Xing Clan started to kill each other!

Suddenly, Xing Bitian tugged Yang Ye’s hand and shook her head slightly while speaking softly, “Forget it.”

Yang Ye shook his head and walked slowly toward the Xing Clan, and he spoke ferociously, “Do you know why the Xing Clan is still whole? Because you have Xing Biqing! If it wasn’t for her, then based on what you did to me, the Xing Clan would have vanished from this world a long time ago. Of course, it isn’t too late now.”

As soon as he finished speaking, a blood red ray of light surged up into the sky.

Executor!

Xing Ren was finally quite afraid when he witnessed this.

He knew the madman before him was serious!

At this moment, he couldn’t be bothered to consider his dignity or anything else. His own life and the lives of the Xing Clan’s disciples were most important.

Right when Yang Ye was about to start a slaughter, Xing Ren hurriedly said, “Yang Ye, my Xing Clan won’t harm her. So, you can rest at ease, alright?”

However, Yang Ye still launched the attack!

Hiss!

Xing Ren watched with astonishment as the estate behind him was cut into two!

Dust and dirt surged up into the air!

“You…” Xing Ren was so livid he couldn’t even speak properly.

Yang Ye just ignored him and glanced at the surroundings, “If Xing Biqing is fine and well in your clan, everything will be fine; but if I find out you treat her unfairly, then let me tell you this, I’ll definitely return and kill all of you. To be honest, I really, really want to slaughter your entire clan.”

Yang Ye gazed at Xing Biqing and continued, “If you can’t stay here, come to the Ancient Sword Sect, and come to me if you have any difficulties!”

Xing Biqing smiled bitterly, “You…”

Yang Ye gazed at Xing Ren and said, “Remember what I said. If she’s fine and well, the Xing Clan will be safe; if she’s gone, I’ll immediately make the Xing Clan pay for what it did.”

Yang Ye vanished into the sky once he finished speaking.

Xing Ren’s face was extremely unsightly.

A humiliation!

When had the Xing Clan ever been treated like that? It was an absolute humiliation to the Xing Clan!

But what could he do about it?

Fight Yang Ye?

The Xing Clan had suffered terrible losses in the battle against the desolate race, and even that existence from the Xing Clan had been severely injured. Presently, the Xing Clan couldn’t afford to enter into a battle!

Of course, even if they could, he wasn’t really willing to.

The desolate race was a threat no more, so there was another problem now.

Could the powers of Eternal Kingdom still stay united as they had been?

All the other powers had started to think about their own selfish desires!

Yang Ye didn’t return to the Ancient Sword Sect and just entered the War Dimension instead.

As soon as he arrived, Liu Yuan appeared before him.

Yang Ye said, “I’m not here to cause trouble!”

She gazed at him for a long time and left.

Actually, if Yang Ye insisted on causing trouble here, she couldn’t stop him at all. While Yang Ye was at the Lord Realm, his intents were at the Destiny Realm!

And he had two of them too!

Something worth mentioning was that Yang Ye had concealed his cultivation!

Presently, no one knew that he was in the Destiny Realm. With the help of his dual Domains, only someone at the level of Qi Bitian or the woman in white would be able to see through his true cultivation!

There was an abyss at the extreme north of the War Dimension. It was where Qi Bitian had been.

Yang Ye arrived at the abyss again, and he met Cang Mu and Sha Ji there at the bottom of it.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Seniors, do you know where she is?”

He was naturally most concerned about Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu. They were the people he was most worried about right now.

Cang Mu glanced at Yang Ye and said, “We can’t contact her either.”

Yang Ye asked, “How high are their chances?”

Cang Mu replied solemnly, “Master hasn’t fully unsealed her strength. Under such circumstances, they don’t have a huge chance. Even if that existence is injured.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Cang Mu sighed softly, “Because she’s very difficult to kill. Perhaps you’re unaware but her four forms possess four different types of profound energy, and every one of them possesses a heaven defying effect. It’s the ability to heal. Her healing is countless times better than your Primordial Violet Energy. Unless they are killed with a single attack, it’s very difficult to kill them. But if Master unseals herself, it will definitely draw the attention of one of her stronger forms… In short, they aren’t in a very good situation.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time and said, “I don’t know how to locate them!”

Cang Mu shook his head, “That isn’t necessary. Just do what you should be doing. You can’t interfere in their business yet.”

He glanced at the surroundings and sighed softly, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye gazed at Cang Mu with bewilderment, “Huh?”

Cang Mu glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Master said that if a day comes when she leaves, we should go with you. According to my knowledge, you’re in a much more dangerous situation than she is. So, what do you plan to do?”

What do I plan to do?

Yang Ye was stunned for a moment. In the end, he shook his head and smiled, “What else can I do? I’ll kill my way through it until blood forms rivers!”

They gazed at Yang Ye in silence.

…

The Ancient Sword Sect.

The disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect were cultivating as always!

Suddenly, a middle aged man in a dark violet robe appeared in the air above the sect. At practically the exact same moment, Elder Xue and the others appeared before him.

Elder Xue frowned slightly, “May I know who you are?”

The middle aged man grinned, “They call me Mr. Jing. I’d like to ask all of you to come with me!”

Elder Xue shook her head, “I’m afraid we can’t!”

Mr. Jing chuckled, and then he raised his right hand and pressed it down.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The sect below started to explode apart inch by inch. At the same time, everyone in the sect was pressed flat on the ground.

Suddenly, a few figures shot up into the air!

It was Blood Maiden, Nether Maiden, and the others!

However, two more figures appeared by Mr. Jing’s side, Shui Wubian and another one of the old men who’d been at the Origin World that day.

Three peak Destiny Realm experts!

Mr. Jing sized up Blood Maiden’s group and grinned, “You’re exactly who I’m looking for. He’ll definitely come with all of you in our possession. It’s best if you don’t resist. Otherwise, I wouldn’t mind killing a few of you to make him act less crazily and arrogantly.”

The two figures behind Mr. Jing charged forward once he finished speaking.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
