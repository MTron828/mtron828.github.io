Chapter 1903 – Obstructed!

I’m in a very bad mood!

Yang Ye wasn’t joking, he really wasn’t in a good mood. Because nothing had gone smoothly all along the way, but he’d been constantly encountering trouble.

Troubles!

He wasn’t afraid of it, but he didn’t want it either. However, trouble kept coming for him!

The old man who led the group revealed a ridiculing smile, “You’re in a bad mood? Don’t worry, you won’t be in any mood soon!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a strand of aura swept out from him.

Suddenly, a voice resounded from within the estate, “Scram!”

It was like a deafening thunderclap.

The expression of the old man in the lead changed slightly, and he turned to look in the direction of the estate while a trace of fear could be seen in his eyes.

Suddenly, Nansi Yin walked out from the estate. She was slightly stunned when she saw the old men, and then her face fell, “Gong Jin sent you?”

The old man who led the group bowed to her, “Young Miss Yin, our young master was merely worried about your safety and sent us to protect you.”

Nansi Yin spoke indifferently, “I told him not to tell my clan. He didn’t notify them, right?”

The old man shook his head, “He didn’t!”

Nansi Yin nodded slightly and said, “You can return. I’m not in danger!”

The old man was hesitant.

Nansi Yin frowned slightly, “What?”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Young Miss Siyin, he’s absolutely not a good person. It’s very dangerous to stay with him. Forgive me for overstepping, but please come home with us.”

She walked over to the old man and said, “I appreciate your intentions, but let me repeat myself. Leave. Understand?”

The old man hesitated for a moment, and then he sighed softly and nodded, “Take care!”

He gazed at Yang Ye once he finished speaking, “You’ll die if she’s injured in the slightest!”

He vanished on the spot with the other two old men.

Die!

Yang Ye ignored the three old men and gazed at Nansi Yin. The latter said, “They’re not from my clan, they are from the Gong Clan. I…”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m not interested in that.”

She puckered her lips and said, “I didn’t get the command token.”

Yang Ye frowned when he heard this. Meanwhile, she added, “The Northern Sky King isn’t in the city, and the command token to head to Broken Cliff Mountain can only be obtained with his daughter, Bei Cangyue’s, permission. So, we have to go see her!”

Bei Cangyue!

Yang Ye asked, “Where is she?”

Nansi Yin replied, “Come with me!”

She walked off towards the distance.

Yang Ye immediately followed her.

“Kid, you have to be careful in this city!” Meanwhile, Hou Qing’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s head, “There are a huge number of experts in this city, and the Northern Sky King’s strength is clearly not someone you can fight right now. Even if I were at my prime, I would be no match for him.”

“The Northern Sky King?” Yang Ye asked, “Who is he?”

Hou Qing replied, “He’s an influential figure in the human race. He has a cavalry under his control, and it’s renowned throughout the Human Dimension — the Sky Dragon Cavalry. It’s no ordinary cavalry. In any case, if you have the chance, you can have a look for yourself in the future!”

Yang Ye asked, “Is he on the Sovereign of Man’s side?”Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Hou Qing answered, “Of course. However, according to the information my shaman race possesses, the Sovereign of Man seems to fear that fellow. Actually, it does make sense. The Northern Sky King’s strength is beyond doubt, and the army under his command battles my shaman race all year round. So, he's the strongest amongst the four kings. If you’re the Emperor, and you had someone like him under your command, wouldn’t you fear him too?”

Yang Ye replied, “Senior, you’re from the shaman race, but when it comes to this Northern Sky King, you seem to…”

Hou Qing finished Yang Ye’s sentence, “I seem to not hold that much hate towards him, right?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Hou Qing explained, “Even though the human race and shaman race are at war, and the Northern Sky King has killed countless experts from my shaman race, my shaman race has similarly killed countless experts of the human race. As far as we’re concerned, strong enemies deserve our respect. Of course, while we respect them, we still kill those we have to kill!”

Yang Ye smiled. He was about to speak when Nansi Yin’s voice entered his ears, “We’re here!”

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and looked up. There was a pavilion before them. It was smaller than the Northern Sky King’s estate, and it wasn’t as luxurious either. However, it was very exquisite. There were two bronze beast statues at the entrance.

Nansi Yin suddenly asked, “Do you know what demon beasts they are?”

Yang Ye shook his head, and Nansi Yin smiled, “They’re Spirit Hawks. Their speed is… Yes, much faster than you.”

Yang Ye said, “Stop wasting time!”

“Boring!” She rolled her eyes at him and said, “Right, don’t act rashly in front of Bei Cangyue. She’s the number two figure in Northern Sky City, and her prestige is only inferior to her father, the Northern Sky King.”

Yang Ye said, “Don’t worry, I won’t act rashly!”

Nansi Yin nodded, “Let’s go!”

As she spoke, she walked over to the pavilion. Meanwhile, a middle aged man appeared before her.

Nansi Yin withdrew a jade slip and said, “Please notify Young Miss Cangyue that someone from the Nansi Clan wishes to see her!”

She wasn’t seeking an audience!

She wished to see Bei Cangyue!

The middle aged man frowned when he heard her, and he was visibly displeased. However, surprise flashed through his eyes when he saw the jade slip in her grasp.

A short while later, he spoke softly, “Young Miss, please wait a moment!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he entered the pavilion, and it only took three breaths of time for him to appear on the spot again. He said, “Young Miss, please come in!”

Nansi Yin turned around and gazed at Yang Ye, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye nodded, and they followed the middle aged man into the pavilion. As soon as they entered, a woman walked over to them.

She looked around the age of 20, and she was very beautiful. She had exquisite features that were completely flawless, and it was especially so for her figure. She wasn’t just tall; she was extremely slender too. Coupled with the tight white dress she wore, it made her seem even more attractive.

She was the Northern Sky King’s daughter, Bei Cangyue.

Bei Cangyue gazed at Nansi Yin and smiled, “So it’s Sister Nansi Yin. Why are you in my Northern Sky City instead of completing the trials of the ten paradises? Right, I don’t think there are any trials in my city for you to challenge!”

Nansi Yin was clearly able to adapt to something like this, and she took Bei Cangyue’s hand and smiled, “I heard Big Sister Cangyue is an extraordinary expert amongst us women. Now that I’ve met you, you really live up to your reputation…”

Just like that, they kept praising each other and talking like they were old friends.

However, Yang Ye was very well aware that they didn’t know each other before today.

It was just nonsense!

Yang Ye closed his eyes. They’re really good at talking nonsense.

Some time passed before Bei Cangyue’s eyes suddenly descended upon Yang Ye, “He is?”

“He’s a friend of mine!” Nansi Yin smiled, “To be honest, we’re here because we need your help.”

“Oh?” Bei Cangyue glanced at them and smiled, “What is it?”

Nansi Yin replied, “We want to go to Broken Cliff Mountain!”

Broken Cliff Mountain!

Bei Cangyue asked, “You want to go to the Shaman Dimension?”

Nansi Yin replied seriously, “Exactly!” She knew that it was impossible to conceal. So, she just admitted it.

Bei Cangyue’s smile gradually vanished. A short while passed before she replied, “I’m sure you’re aware that Broken Cliff Mountain isn’t a place that just anyone can go to. Especially someone of high standing like you. Of course, I’m not trying to say anything about you. But you should be aware that Northern Sky City protects the safety of the human race, so not even a single mistake can be allowed!”

Nansi Yin said, “Are you afraid we’ll betray the human race or collude with the shaman race?”

Bei Cangyue grinned, “You must be joking.”

Nansi Yin asked, “Can you make an exception?”

Bei Cangyue shook her head slightly, “Anything else can be discussed, but this…”

Nansi Yin still wanted to say something, but Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Is there any other way through Broken Cliff Mountain?”

Nansi Yin gazed at Yang Ye, “There is, but we’ll have to go an extremely far way around. We’ll have to go all the way around Northern Sky Prefecture. In short, it’ll take at least two months with your speed.”

Yang Ye couldn’t help but frown.

Meanwhile, Bei Cangyue suddenly asked, “Why are you going to the Shaman Dimension?”

Nansi Yin gazed at Yang Ye. It was a question she wanted to know the answer to as well.

Bei Cangyue immediately gazed at Yang Ye when she saw this. For the first time, there was a slightly scrutinizing gaze in her eyes.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “It’s nothing much. I just heard it’s fun, so I want to experience it for myself!”

Nansi Yin’s face instantly darkened. I’ve never heard a worse excuse!

Bei Cangyue spoke indifferently, “It’s dangerous. You should go somewhere else to enjoy yourself!”

Yang Ye asked, “Is there no room for discussion?”

Bei Cangyue shook her head.

Yang Ye’s face fell, and his sword suddenly started to tremble.
