Chapter 1412 – Celestial Demon Hegemon Body!

“Do you think I’m a horse?” Qiong Qi was quite displeased.

As a ferocious beast and even one from the ancient times, how could he possibly be willing to let others ride him? As far as he was concerned, it was a humiliation. However, he didn’t make Yang Ye get off him. After all, Yang Ye had rode him once, so it didn’t make a difference if Yang Ye did it again. Moreover, Yang Ye had no intention to humiliate him.

Even then, Qiong Qi was still displeased when he saw how Yang Ye acted.

Yang Ye shook Qiong Qi’s horn and said, “Don’t be so intolerant, and I’m riding you for a while. Alright, let’s cut the crap and deal with them first!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his profound energy circulated madly. At the same time, the Sword Precursor was exchanged for Heaven’s Gravestone.

Now that he had Qiong Qi’s help, even the might of an ordinary Heavenrend was comparable to the true form of Heavenrend. So, Yang Ye didn’t have to use the true form of Heavenrend. After all, that would be overkill.

Yang Ye didn’t attack the Celestial Demon Lord. He just gazed at the violet robed old man’s group instead.

One naturally had to target the weakest link first!

He didn’t waste his breath at all and tapped Qiong Qi lightly with his foot. Qiong Qi understood what he meant and immediately flapped his wings, and then he vanished on the spot with Yang Ye on his back!

“Watch out!” The Demon Lord was shocked and hurriedly warned the others. He wanted to lend a hand, but Qiong Qi was truly too quick. Moreover, Zhuang Weiran had appeared in front of him.

She would immediately attack if he did!

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi instantly brought Yang Ye to a Deity, and then Yang Ye immediately drew his sword and swung it.

That Deity hadn’t even been able to react before his body was sliced into two.

Once he killed that Deity with a single blow, Yang Ye pressed Heaven’s Gravestone against his forehead, and then both he and Qiong Qi transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

“AH!!” A shrill cry suddenly resounded at the instant they vanished. Everyone looked towards the source of the cry, and they saw an old man start to become ethereal, and it only took an instant for the old man to vanish on the spot.

Two Deities had been killed in an instant!

Everyone was shocked by the scene before them!

However, Qiong Qi and Yang Ye didn’t stop. Once they killed the second Deity, they’d vanished on the spot again. However, all the Deities had recovered from their shock now. So, at the moment they vanished, the violet robed old man and the others had moved backwards and simultaneously slapped their palms in Yang Ye and Qiong Qi’s direction.

It took time to execute techniques, but they didn’t have such time right now. So, they could only execute ordinary attacks.

Five energy palms slammed against the ray of light that Yang Ye and Qiong Qi formed. However, it was instantly obliterated upon coming into contact with them, and then a ray of light flashed through the center of an old man’s forehead. A moment of silence ensued before that old man’s figure turned ethereal and vanished!

Another Deity was dead!

At this moment, horror appeared in the violet robed old man’s eyes. They were Deities! Deities! However, they were killed with such ease!

In less than 10 minutes, the violet robed old man’s side had lost almost half of its forces. Regardless of whether it was the violet robed old man or the others by his side, all of them didn’t have the intent to fight anymore, nor did they dare to fight. Presently, they had no advantage against Yang Ye and Qiong Qi!

“My Nether Blue Stellar Region will withdraw!” One of the old men disregarded the Demon Lord and violet robed old man, and he immediately vanished once he finished speaking.

“My Darklight Stellar Region is withdrawing as well.”

“My Skywave Stellar Region is withdrawing.”

It didn’t take long for two more old men to turn around and leave. So, only the violet robed old man, the Demon Lord, and the experts of Celestial Demon Stellar Region remained.

Yang Ye’s face was quite gloomy when he saw them leave. If it was possible, he naturally wanted to kill all of them. However, those old fellows had split up, and they fled extremely swiftly by traveling directly through space. If he were to pursue them, he would definitely succeed, but it would make him leave the battlefield. It would be extremely disadvantageous to Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region if he left!

But it didn’t matter because he could get even with them after this battle!

“Fools!” The Demon Lord couldn’t help but curse when he saw them flee. At this moment, all of them were a single group. If Celestial Demon Stellar Region was crushed, then all the stellar regions that participated in this battle would definitely suffer Clouds of Heavens Stellar Region’s revenge. So, the best choice was to work together and crush Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region! Not run!

The violet robed old man’s face was quite unsightly as well. He hadn’t expected the remaining experts would actually flee. Enmity had already been formed, so fleeing now was absolutely foolish.

Even though they’d lost 3 Deities, they still had an advantage. Because the Deities on the Demon Lord’s side were still alive. Moreover, they just had to notify the powers standing behind them to send more reinforcements, then it wouldn’t be a problem for them to crush Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region. Yet now....

“Kill! Kill!” Suddenly, the Demon Lord’s voice resounded. He was very well aware that it was impossible for this battle to end peacefully. It would only end with one of their deaths. So, he’d decisively given the order because the longer it dragged on, the more disadvantageous it would be for them!

Once they heard the Demon Lord give the order, all the experts from Celestial Demon Stellar Region didn’t hesitate to charge at the forces from Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region.

Meanwhile, the Demon Lord stretched both his hands forward, and then a vortex of black energy appeared above his palms. Threads of violet were frequently flickering through the vortex.

Zhuang Weiran’s eyes narrowed slightly at the sight of this, and there was solemnness in her eyes. Because they were cosmic rays. She’d accidentally allowed them to come into contact with her, and it made her cultivation drop. If it wasn’t for Yang Ye, she would have never been able to recover.

Yang Ye had noticed this from afar, so he rode Qiong Qi over to Zhuang Weiran and said, “You deal with that violet robed geezer.”

She glanced at him and said, “Be careful!” As soon as she finished speaking, her figure shot towards the old man.

A wisp of viciousness flashed through the old man’s eyes when he saw her charge at him, and he didn’t waste his breath and immediately charged at her as well.

Meanwhile, once the black vortexes of energy appeared on the palms of the Demon Lord, a black vortex of energy actually emerged from his body as well. It was like a black hole that ceaselessly flickered with dark light. Besides that, violet threads were ceaselessly flashing around his body.

Cosmic rays!

They weren’t something new to Yang Ye because he had three within his body. However, once the Primordial Pagoda recovered, those cosmic rays had vanished. He hadn’t noticed how they vanished, but it was definitely the Primordial Pagoda’s doing because only it had the ability to make such terrifying things vanish.

Qiong Qi suddenly said, “Be careful!”

Yang Ye nodded. He’d experienced how terrifying they were, so he naturally didn’t dare to act carelessly. He shook his wrist slightly and the sword within the ancient sheath was changed to the Sword Precursor. After that, Qiong Qi stomped down and transformed into a ray of light that shot at the Demon Lord. Qiong Qi had clearly not held back, so his speed had risen to an indescribable level.

It could be said that only the Demon Lord was probably the only one here capable of seeing Yang Ye and Qiong Qi.

The Demon Lord slowly closed his eyes. .When Yang Ye and Qiong Qi arrived around 3m away from him, he suddenly opened his eyes again. At this moment, his eyes had become two black vortexes, and a wave of terrifying black energy suddenly surged out from him when his eyes were opened. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had drawn his sword and swung it!

Bang!

An explosion resounded as the space throughout the sky collapsed. But it only took an instant for the space there to be restored. At this moment, Yang Ye and Qiong Qi were around 10km away while the Demon Lord hadn’t moved an inch from where he stood. There were strands of black energy flowing around him while threads of violet flashed through them.

Regardless of whether it was Yang Ye or Qiong Qi, both of them had extremely solemn expressions on their faces.

It was the 1st time!

It was the 1st time Yang Ye’s Heavenrend had been forcefully stopped by the Demon Lord!

“Be careful! That’s the Celestial Demon Hegemon Body. It’s a technique that an ancient Celestial Demon was renowned for. Once cultivated to an advanced stage, one’s body is protected by lightning and immune to all techniques!” Meanwhile, Zhuang Weiran’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “He’s invincible in this state. You have to delay until that state wears off. He can only execute it once in 10 years. Because he has to absorb demonic lightning after every single time he executes it, and it can only be executed once he has demonic lightning within him. Besides that, watch out for his cosmic rays. That’s the truly lethal attack!”

The Celestial Demon Hegemon Body! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. His gaze descended onto the energy flowing around the Demon Lord. Sure enough, if he looked carefully, he noticed that it was actually divine lightning!

He’s immune to all techniques! Yang Ye slowly clenched his fists while his profound energy surged madly.

The Demon Lord took a deep breath and said, “Yang Ye, only two people have forced me to use this in the last 10,000 years. The laughable thing is that both of them were of the younger generation. Needless to say, both of you are very formidable and extraordinary geniuses. Unfortunately, it’s over now.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the Demon Lord waved his hands. In an instant, lightning flashed and rumbled through the sky. Countless bolts of black lightning had appeared out of thin air, and they flickered through the sky.

Meanwhile, the Demon Lord unfurled his fist and made a chopping motion in Yang Ye’s direction.

Bang!

A pillar of lightning tore through the space in the sky and shot down towards Yang Ye. It was so swift that it instantly arrived above Yang Ye.

A wisp of ferocity flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes as he gazed at the pillar of lightning, “The Celestial Demon Hegemon Body? I have one too!”

Bang!

As soon as he finished speaking, a pillar of crystal blue light suddenly descended from the starry sky. It instantly pierced through space and arrived above Yang Ye before surging into him.

Bang!

A wave of terrifying stellar energy surged out from within Yang Ye, and then his entire body crystallized.
