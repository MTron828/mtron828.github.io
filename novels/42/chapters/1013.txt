Chapter 1014 – A Pair Of Eyes!

Bang!

A powerful aura suddenly surged out from within Yang Ye, and it swept towards the surroundings and caused powerful waves to surge around him. These waves overlapped as they swept out, and they instantly blasted apart the vines which were coiled around his feet. As for the mermen around him, all of them were blasted apart from the impact!

Torrents of blood rippled along with the waves.

The beautiful woman, Xiao Lan, and the old man were stunned by the scene before them!

After all, the weakest amongst the mermen in the surroundings were at the Monarch Realm, and there even were 2 Half-Saints amongst them!

However, they’d been obliterated just like that!

Yang Ye started walking towards the three of them, and he gazed at Xiao Lan as he said, “You could have been frank if you didn’t want to take me to Immortal Island. I wouldn’t have forced you. Why did you have to trick me and make me come here? I don’t know if you did it for wealth or something else, all I do know is that it has wasted a huge amount of my time, and I really lack time right now!”

Meanwhile, the old man stood in front of Xiao Lan and said, “It was my idea. You can do anything you want to me, but Xiao Lan has nothing to do with all of this. So, please spare her!”

Yang Ye suddenly stretched out his hand and made a grabbing motion. A strand of suction force surged out from his palm, and then the old man instantly appeared before him while his hand was clamped around the old man’s throat. Yang Ye grinned as he gazed at the old man, “Did you think that would move me and make me let both of you go? If that was your plan, then all I can say is that you were dreaming!”

Yang Ye pressed down slightly as he spoke!

Crack!

The sound of bones breaking resounded, and then the old man’s head slanted to the side as the life within him drained out!

The beautiful woman’s pupils constricted while shock filled her eyes, and Xiao Lan had slumped down to the ground instead.

At this moment, she knew that she was utterly mistaken, and that she’d severely underestimated Yang Ye’s strength. Even though Yang Ye had killed those Sharkmen in an instant, it didn’t mean anything because those Sharkmen were just weaklings!

So, while she knew Yang Ye was very strong, she felt that he was just stronger than ordinary demon beasts at the very most. Yet now, she knew that she was wrong. This man who stood before her wasn’t just slightly stronger than ordinary demon beasts, he was extremely strong!

“This is just a misunderstanding!” Meanwhile, the beautiful woman spoke abruptly, “My Mermaid Clan has no ill intent towards you. We really have no ill intent towards you. Right, didn’t you like Xiao Lan? That’s not a problem at all. She’s yours from now onwards. You can do anything you want to her.”

Yang Ye gazed at the beautiful woman and asked, “You’re the patriarch of the Mermaid Clan?”

She hurriedly nodded, “I am. What happened just now was just a misunderstanding. I....”

Suddenly, her voice stopped abruptly because Yang Ye had suddenly appeared in front of her and had grabbed her by the throat. The beautiful woman was horrified. After all, she was a Half-Saint, yet she didn’t have the slightest room to resist the man who stood before her. Is he a Saint?

“Needless to say, you’re a failure!” Yang Ye shook his head and suddenly pressed down. The beautiful woman’s neck was instantly broken, and she died on the spot with her eyes opened wide. Obviously, she’d died with everlasting regret!

Yang Ye tossed her corpse on the ground, and then he gazed at Xiao Lan, “I have to say that you’re really too good at acting. You even fooled me. But I can’t figure out why you did that. Was it for my wealth?”

Xiao Lan raised her head to look at him, and there was a strong desire to live in her eyes, “Would you let me go if I tell you?”

“I’ve suddenly lost the interest to know. Because it’s pointless.” Yang Ye turned around and shot up towards the surface once he finished speaking.

Xiao Lan heaved a sigh of relief when she witnessed this scene. However, a pearl of water suddenly shot over from afar, and it instantly entered the center of her forehead.

Xiao Lan’s figure stiffened and fell to the ground.

Yang Ye casually grabbed one of the mermaids in the surroundings, asked for directions to Immortal Island, and then shot out from beneath the ocean and flashed towards Immortal Island.

The incident at the Mermaid Clan was just a trivial incident to him. Actually, he’d roughly guessed why Xiao Lan had done that. It was none other than because he’d been too generous, and she’d become greedy at the sight of his wealth. This wasn’t something that only humans did, it was even extremely common amongst demon beasts.

...

One day later, an island appeared within Yang Ye’s vision.

The island was boundless. Even Yang Ye couldn’t see the ends of it with his current vision. There were numerous towering mountains on the island, and they continued on endlessly like an enormous dragon was coiled up there. Besides that, huge white cranes soared frequently through the air around the peaks of those mountains, and the island was covered in white mist. It seemed like a paradise of immortals.

Yang Ye pondered deeply for an instant, and then he vanished on the spot.

After he entered Immortal Island, Yang Ye had an extremely solemn expression on his face. Because as soon as he entered the island, he noticed over a dozen strands of divine sense sweeping through where he stood. Fortunately, he had the Sword Domain to conceal himself, so they weren’t able to discover his presence. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Even though the Sword Domain could conceal his aura to the point that even Saints couldn’t sense him, Yang Ye was very well aware that it didn’t mean he had nothing to worry about. After all, Saints transcended the world. Especially some Saints who possessed unbelievable abilities. So, the slightest bit of carelessness might cause him to fail miserably at a task he could have succeeded at!

Moreover, if he were to be discovered here, then with the Asura Queen’s strength and the numerous Saints on the island, he would definitely be finished!

Yang Ye didn’t move, and he just stood on the spot and held his breath. He made himself seem stiff like a rock. Because the divine senses of Saints were still sweeping incessantly through the area. In the beginning, he’d thought that they’d detected his presence, but it didn’t take long for him to realize that they hadn’t noticed his presence. They were just sweeping the area in intervals, and it was like a constant inspection of the island!

Isn’t the security here a little too tight? Yang Ye’s brows were knit tightly together. There were at least 10 Saints on this island who were ceaselessly scanning the entire island with their divine sense. Under such circumstances, finding the Tree of Creation and Fruit of Creation was clearly extremely difficult.

Suddenly, the violet mink appeared in front of Yang Ye, and she pointed towards the distance while a trace of excitement could be seen in her eyes.

Yang Ye was overjoyed when he saw this. Because the violet mink only acted in this way when she sensed extraordinarily precious treasures. Moreover, he’d almost forgotten that the violet mink seemed to have the ability to detect treasures. However, she paid no attention to ordinary treasures, and that was naturally because of the Primordial Violet Energy she’d absorbed. After all, she’d been living with Primordial Violet Energy for years, so she’d become extremely picky!

Yang Ye traveled forward carefully according to the violet mink’s guidance. For safety’s sake, he even activated the Laws of Darkness and only traveled in the shadows.

The Fruit of Creation was related to Lu Wan’er’s future, so he had to be careful!

Yang Ye naturally felt guilty for what happened to Lu Wan’er. After all, she’d become crippled because of him. So, he intended to restore her Dantian no matter what. It wasn’t just because of his guilt; it was because of his love for her as well. Yang Ye knew that she would live the remainder of her life in pain and sorrow if she couldn’t become a cultivator and cultivate anymore. Moreover, if she couldn’t cultivate, it represented that she would be able to live for a few dozen years at most before she aged and died!

That was something he absolutely refused to allow!

After around 2 hours passed, a city appeared within Yang Ye’s vision. Yang Ye was surprised to notice that there were no living beings within the entire city. Of course, the dozen or so Saints who were hiding somewhere weren’t included. Because their divine sense had never vanished.

This island is quite strange! Yang Ye pondered deeply for a long time as he gazed at the city. A long time passed before Yang Ye transformed into a shadow that vanished on the spot. He was in a dark corner of the city when his figure appeared once more.

Yang Ye continued forward according to the violet mink’s guidance, and it didn’t take long for him to arrive before a palace. Yang Ye’s pupils constricted slightly when he saw the palace because there were 3 words on it — Asura Queen Palace!

This is where Asura Queen lives? Yang Ye frowned again. There was a problem standing before him right now. To enter or not to enter! Because the violet mink was pointing in the direction of the palace. In other words, it was very likely that the Fruit of Creation was within the palace. However, it was very likely for the Asura Queen to be there as well!

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate for long before he transformed into a shadow that drifted into the palace.

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted upon entering the palace. Because he noticed that his divine sense seemed to have become useless upon entering the hall. There was an invisible force there that immediately obstructed his divine sense when he tried to send out, so it couldn’t leave him at all. It wasn’t just his divine sense, even the divine sense of those Saints couldn’t enter the palace as he’d stopped sensing them upon entering the palace!

Yang Ye remained silent on the spot for a long time, and then he glanced at the hall. He noticed that it was completely empty, and there was only a single passageway which he couldn’t see the end of.

There was a solemn expression in Yang Ye’s eyes as he gazed at the passageway. His intuition told him that there was danger in the depths of it, and it was best to not head over there. However, he was here, so how could he just give up now?

How could he be willing to go back just like that?

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he transformed into a shadow that moved against the wall and drifted forward.

Yang Ye finally stopped after moving forward for 4 hours. Because there was a black door in front of him.

This time, Yang Ye didn’t hesitate and walked over to the door. He placed his right hand on the door, and then the Laws of Decay slowly seeped out of his palm.

A breath of time later, the door vanished, and then Yang Ye’s pupils constricted. Because he saw a pair of eyes, and they were looking at him!
