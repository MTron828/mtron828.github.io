Chapter 1491 - Are You Or The Unfettered One Stronger?

Translator: InVader

Blood Maiden!

The first thing that came to mind was the Nether Pavilion!

Yang Ye felt like the blood throughout his body was on the verge of exploding apart, and he hurriedly shouted, “Nether Pavilion! Er, Second Sister, I’m a friend!”

Second sister? Lian Banzhuang shot a bewildered gaze at Yang Ye. He knows her?

As soon as Yang Ye spoke, a moment of silence ensued, and then the blood within Yang Ye and Lian Banzhuang suddenly calmed down. Yang Ye immediately heaved a sigh of relief when he noticed this. Earlier, he’d merely thought that she may be the Nether Pavilion’s second ranked hall master. But he wasn’t sure.

However, he was sure now.

“Come here!” Meanwhile, a ghastly voice came from afar.

How cold!

It was extremely cold. It seemed like ice which was hidden for 10,000 years had suddenly emerged, and it caused one’s entire body to feel cold.

She’s definitely not someone who’s easy to deal with! Yang Ye muttered to himself. Just her voice was quite terrifying. However, the members of the Nether Pavilion weren’t easy to deal with at all. Blind Maiden was comparatively better because she was quite amiable.

Meanwhile, Lian Banzhuang asked, “Are we going over?”

“Can we flee?” Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Come on.” He started walking off into the distance.

Lian Banzhuang immediately followed him. Just as Yang Ye had said, they couldn’t flee at all. Even though she was at the Dualism Realm, there was a gap between Dualism Realm experts as well. Moreover, some couldn’t be judged based on their realms of cultivation. For example, the Unfettered One had only been a Deity when he arrived here, but he could even kill Dualism Realm experts!

Lian Banzhuang asked, “You know her?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t. I just know her sisters, so we can be considered to be related.”

“No wonder!” Lian Banzhuang nodded slightly, “Fortunately, you know her. Otherwise, we would be finished.”

Yang Ye asked, “Is she very fierce?”

“She isn’t just fierce!” Lian Banzhuang shook her head, “She’s extremely fierce and overbearing. As soon as she arrived here all those years ago, she looked for the strongest existence here. Do you know what she told that fellow? She told that fellow to fuck off.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

“That fellow would naturally not do as she said!” Lian Banzhuang continued, “After that, she absorbed all of that fellow’s blood. That was fellow had quite bad luck. He’d been beaten up by the Unfettered One, but the Unfettered One didn’t kill him. However, he still hadn’t been able to avoid calamity.”

Yang Ye shook his head. He just had to offend someone from the Nether Pavilion. He didn’t know how strong the Yang Clan was, but he knew the Nether Pavilion wasn’t ordinary at all.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye and Lian Banzhuang to stop.

A woman was seated cross-legged not too far away from them. Her hair was red. No, it shouldn’t be called hair. When Yang Ye looked carefully, he noticed that it wasn’t hair at all. It was blood that had been shaped into hair! Besides that, she wore a blood red dress. Similarly, the blood red dress was condensed into form with blood!

She was very beautiful and not inferior to anyone he’d seen over the years. However, there was a faint cold expression on her face, and she seemed unapproachable.

Lian Banzhuang had an extremely solemn expression on her face as she gazed at the woman.

Blood Maiden!

She was a taboo here. No one dared to step foot into her territory, and those who had were dead.

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden suddenly opened her eyes and gazed at Yang Ye. Yang Ye’s expression changed when he saw her eyes. Because her eyeballs were actually pearls of blood. They were pearls of blood that were formed from blood itself. It was unlike how he turned blood red when he utilized slaughter intent.

Blood Maiden gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Give me an explanation!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment, and then he flipped his palm. In an instant, his chest started rising and falling rapidly, and it didn’t take long for a stone to emerge from his palm.

It was the Worldmend Stone, of course!

Blood Maiden didn’t seem to have done anything, but the Worldmend Stone instantly flew over into her grasp. She gazed at it for a long time, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “Fourth Sister’s treasure. Since she actually gave it to you, she has succeeded, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “She has gained full control over her physique. When I parted with them, they said they were going to look for you.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“She succeeded!” Blood Maiden’s face became slightly gentle when she heard him, and then she glanced at him, “The Worldmend Stone that belongs to my fourth sister. If she wasn’t very close to you or owed you a huge favor, she wouldn’t have given it to you. I’m really curious. Tell me about them.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he slowly described everything that had happened.

As Yang Ye described everything, Blood Maiden’s expression grew gentler and gentler. However, when he spoke about the large world, her face became icy cold once more.

A short while passed before ghastly killing intent flashed through her eyes, “The larger world. Once I go up there, I’ll definitely slaughter all those who acted against us sisters! I annihilate all of them, and I’ll sever their path of reincarnation as well!”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. She has a hot temper!

Blood Maiden waved her hand, and the Worldmend Stone entered Yang Ye’s body, “You’re too weak. Don’t go anywhere from now on. Just stay here and no one will dare to look for trouble with you!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “I want to leave!”

“Not now!” She shook her head slightly, “If you came here a year ago, I could have sent you out. But not now.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She replied, “Because someone is coming to kill me. So I have to save my strength!”

Yang Ye and Lian Banzhuang’s expressions changed when they heard Blood Maiden, and shock filled their eyes.

Someone wants to kill her?

Who dares to kill her here?

Yang Ye asked, “Who?”

Blood Maiden spoke indifferently, “Who else!”

Yang Ye asked, “The large world?”

She nodded in response.

“They dare to come down here?” Yang Ye continued, “Wouldn’t the Heaven Dao suppress them?”

“Rebirth Realm experts will be coming!” Blood Maiden spoke indifferently, “So, they’ll still be Dualism Realm experts. Moreover, they won’t be ordinary Dualism Realm experts!”

Rebirth Realm experts! Yang Ye and Lian Banzhuang’s expressions became solemn. They hadn’t expected it to actually be Rebirth Realm experts!

Yang Ye remained silent for a short while before he spoke in a low voice, “Why didn’t they just come down here, and kill Third Sister and the others? If they did, Third Sister and the others would have definitely been unable to stop them.”

“They don’t dare!” Blood Maiden continued, “They fear me and Eldest Sister. If Rebirth Realm experts are suppressed to the Dualism Realm upon descending here, they will die.”

Yang Ye asked, “Then why do they dare to descend here now?”

Lian Banzhuang was quite horrified by the sight of Yang Ye constantly asking Blood Maiden questions. Because Yang Ye didn’t know how terrifying Blood Maiden was. Blood Maiden was known for having a terrible temper. But she answered every single question Yang Ye asked! That really made Lian Banzhuang quite curious.

Actually, it was very normal. It was just that her feelings for her sisters had been extended to Yang Ye. She could be considered to have acknowledged Yang Ye, and that was why she treated him like this.

A moment of silence ensued, and then Blood Maiden said, “Because I’m about to ascend into the Rebirth Realm. It’s a critical moment, and it’s the best time to kill me. They won’t give up such an opportunity. So, I can’t break open the space here and send you out right now. The space here is easy to break, but that eye will come. I naturally didn’t fear it in the past, yet now, it would be very disadvantageous to me if it attacks me!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand!”

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden stood up slowly, “It won’t take long. Just 10 days. 10 days later, you can leave this place. Of course, you may die as well.”

Yang Ye asked, “You’re going to charge into the Rebirth Realm in 10 days from now?”

She nodded slightly, “The reason I came here was to open the Blood Demon Fruit that grows here. It can heal my injuries and improve my strength. Presently, my strength and injuries have recovered by around 70%, and it’s time to leave.”

Lian Banzhuang was stunned when she heard this. Blood Maiden is actually injured. In other words, she was heavily injured when she arrived here all those years ago. However, she still killed that demon beast who was the strongest here. That demon beast was at the peak of the Dualism Realm!If she wasn’t injured and was at her peak, then how terrifying would she be?

Actually, Lian Banzhuang wasn’t the only one, Yang Ye had been shocked as well. He’d naturally not expected Blood Maiden to be injured.

Yang Ye’s eyes lit up when he thought up to this point. Are there any injuries I can’t heal?

So, Yang Ye immediately said, “I can heal you. I can heal any injuries!”

Blood Maiden shook her head slightly, “It’s no ordinary injury. External forces can’t heal it at all.”

Yang Ye spoke seriously, “I really might be able to do it!” In any case, besides lifespan, there hadn’t been anything that the Primordial Violet Energy couldn’t heal.

Blood Maiden shook her head, “It was caused by Rebirth Energy and leaves no trace behind. Simply speaking…”

“I still want to try!” Yang Ye spoke in a very serious manner, “Let me try, alright?”

She gazed at him for a few moments and said, “Then try!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Excuse me!” As he spoke, he grabbed her arm, and then his Primordial Violet Energy flowed slowly into her arm.

Blood Maiden’s expression changed when she sensed the Primordial Violet Energy that flowed into her, and then she grabbed Yang Ye’s arm and asked, “What profound energy is this?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Unique profound energy!”

She glanced at him and didn’t inquire further. She just nodded slightly, “I need a large amount of this profound energy, a very large amount.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “You can temporarily delay your advancement, and do it after you’ve recovered completely. In that way, it’ll be much safer, right?”

“I can’t!” She shook her head, “I’ve suppressed my advancement for too long just to recover from my injuries. Now, I’ll collapse if I continue suppressing it. However, with this profound energy of yours, at least 90% of my injuries can be healed in the next 10 days!”

“That’s good!” Yang Ye nodded, “Then I’ll concentrate on healing you for the next 10 days!”

She glanced at him and nodded.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something. He gazed at Blood Maiden and asked, “Er… Are you or the Unfettered One stronger?”

Blood Maiden fell silent.
