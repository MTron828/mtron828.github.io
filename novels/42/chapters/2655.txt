Chapter 2656 – Snowy’s Strength!

Yang Ye gazed at Snowy as he wanted an explanation.

Snowy gazed at the woman instead, and then she waved her paw lightly. She was saying—Isn’t this sword mine?

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

The woman in black gazed at Snowy for a long time, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “It’s your fault that she has such shameless thoughts, right?”

Yang Ye replied seriously, “I didn’t teach her that…”

Boom!

He hadn’t even finished speaking when he’d been blasted out of the Primordial Pagoda.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Snowy blinked, and then she brought the sword over to the woman before placing it before her.

After that, she moved aside to start cultivating without even being told to do so.

The woman glanced at Snowy, and then she closed her eyes again.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye felt absolutely aggrieved. After all, he’d been blamed for Snowy’s mistakes… But it wasn’t really wrong. After all, if he didn’t take responsibility for Snowy, who would?

Looks like I should talk to Snowy about it. She can’t just take someone else’s things…

A short while later, Yang Ye unleashed the Sword Domain.

He planned to break open the space here!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he stabbed Heaven Executor forward.

Hiss!

A hole was stabbed open in space, but it didn’t take long for the hole to heal.

Yang Ye frowned from the sight of this.

He fell silent for a moment, and then he stabbed his sword forward again, but with two hands instead.

The Domain Sword!

This time, his sword carried two types of Domains, and so it could be considered to be unprecedentedly strong.

After all, his sword was completely different to what it used to be!

Hiss!

As his sword stabbed forward, a huge hole was instantly stabbed open in space.

Yang Ye was delighted by this. He was about to go inside when his expression changed drastically, and then the space before him was restored once more. At the same time, the space around him started to shrink. Powerful spatial energy was condensing toward him, causing his entire body to feel like it was about to explode!

Yang Ye was shocked and hurriedly swung his sword repeatedly.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Holes were cut open in space, but the space around him had started to change.

Boundless space was pressing down upon him!

Yang Ye’s face turned utterly gloomy from the sight of this. He didn’t give it much thought, nor did he have the time for that. He unleashed the Sword Domain, and as soon as he did that, he felt a strand of heavy pressure!

However, he didn’t deactivate the Sword Domain and just stabbed his sword forward instead.

Crack!

Heaven Executor combined with the Sword Domain. Yang Ye had used his full strength in this attack.

The space in a huge area instantly cracked open!

At this moment, everything in the surroundings seemed as if it had frozen.

But it didn’t take long for the space here to actually start healing, and it was even healing rapidly!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. What the heck is this?

In the Primordial Pagoda, the woman in black shot a glance up into the sky. A short while later, she gazed at Snowy, “Go help him!”

Snowy glanced at her. She was about to say something, but Snowy had vanished.

The woman in black was stunned speechless.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye frowned when he saw Snowy, “Go back inside now!”

Snowy cracked a smile and pointed at his chest. She was saying that the woman in black told her to come outside.

Yang Ye was quite doubtful, “She asked you to come outside?”

Snowy hurriedly nodded.

Yang Ye asked, “What did she ask you to do out here?”

Snowy gestured to say that the woman wanted her to help him!

Yang Ye asked, “How?”

How?

Snowy blinked. How to help him? She didn’t know!

Yang Ye’s face darkened. Meanwhile, Snowy returned to the Primordial Pagoda.

She went over to the bamboo house, and then Snowy cracked a smile at the woman in black…

She glanced at Snowy and said, “Spirit energy. Absorb the spirit energy here and use it to form a spatial wall. Moreover, don’t let the other party use any spirit energy. Make it so that only you are allowed to use the spirit energy here, understand?”

Snowy blinked and shook her head.

The corners of the woman’s eyes twitched, “You’re telling me that you still don’t understand?”

Snowy waved her paws rapidly. Meanwhile, the woman said, “I don’t know what you’re saying!”

In the end, Snowy gazed at her sword. She pointed at herself, and then pointed at the sword. She was saying that she was afraid and wanted that sword to keep her safe.

Once she understood what Snowy meant, the woman was furious, “What are you afraid of?! Weren’t you very amazing? Didn’t you stop me from using profound energy? Didn’t you…”

Snowy glanced at the woman and lowered her head in a slightly aggrieved manner.

The woman in black gazed at Snowy, and her expression changed repeatedly. A while later, she tossed the black sword over to Snowy, “Remember that it should fear you, not you fear it. Understand?”

Snowy cracked a smile. She hurriedly took the sword in her arms and left.

Meanwhile, the woman added, “Don’t forget that I’m just borrowing it to you, I’m not giving it to you! Understand?”

Snowy blinked and nodded. It was fine to her because she felt that she could choose not to give it back!

After all, Erya never returned the money she took either!

Snowy left the Primordial Pagoda with the sword.

In the wooden house, the woman in black had indifference all over her face. Would that little fellow have any ambition? Would she think about going to the Four Dimensional Universe? Would she destroy the world?

It doesn’t really seem like she will…

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye was still resisting the space around him. He destroyed the space here over and over again, but it reappeared over and over again.

It was endless!

Meanwhile, Snowy appeared once more.

Yang Ye was about to speak when Snowy waved her paw, and the black sword in her grasp immediately emanated rays of black sword energy.

Snowy gazed at Yang Ye complacently. See? I have a sword too! A very powerful sword!

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, the space around him was restored once more, and then it pressed down upon them again.

Yang Ye was about to attack when Snowy suddenly put the sword behind her, and then she closed her eyes.

Right when Yang Ye felt puzzled by her actions, the surroundings suddenly underwent some sort of change.

Some spirit energy suddenly appeared in the surroundings. No, it wasn’t some but a lot! As the spirit energy appeared, the space here started to gradually return to normal.

Yang Ye gazed at Snowy and was quite shocked. When did Snowy grow so powerful?

Suddenly, the space in the surroundings warped strangely!

It was warping!

It was being twisted!

Meanwhile, Snowy’s spirit energy actually started to be twisted into bits as well!

The mysterious energy was planning on turning this expanse of space into a vacuum!

Snowy glanced at the surroundings, and then she raised her paw lightly and pressed it down.

Boom!

The space in the surroundings rippled before it could even obliterate the spirit energy here. Moreover, Snowy suddenly flew up into the air and pressed her paw down.

In an instant, endless spirit energy surged toward Snowy from all directions.

Spirit energy was the quintessence of this world, just like air. Ordinary people needed air to survive, and cultivators needed spirit energy. Now, Snowy was taking control of the spirit energy here!

She was controlling the spirit energy of this world!

Moreover, she was using the spirit energy here to resist the space here. It was like someone in the ordinary world was able to take control of air. It was undoubtedly extremely terrifying to ordinary people because it was like taking control of their fate.

Now, Snowy was controlling spirit energy, and it was like controlling the lives of many existences!

Suddenly, the space before Yang Ye and Snowy cracked open, and then a translucent spear flashed out of there.

It was shooting straight for Snowy!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye charged forward and swung his sword. The translucent spear was instantly sliced into bits.

But it didn’t take long for countless spears to appear in the surroundings! All of them were formed from space!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He was about to stop them when Snowy raised her paw. She was telling him to let her deal with them.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Snowy started to wave her paws rapidly. The spears formed from spirit energy gradually started to stop while Yang Ye watched with astonishment, and then they vanished one by one!

A short while later, the surrounding space had returned to normal.

Yang Ye gulped and gazed at Snowy, “What was that?”

Snowy patted her paws together and inhaled. The spirit energy in the surroundings surged toward her.

Suddenly, the space before them cracked open.

Yang Ye stopped Snowy. The latter blinked to display that she still wanted to absorb more spirit energy.

Yang Ye felt quite helpless, “They’d surrendered, so you can’t continue taking the spirit energy here.”

The mysterious existence here clearly intended to let them leave. So, if he allowed Snowy to continue absorbing the spirit energy here, that existence would definitely fight them to the death.

Yang Ye didn’t know how strong the mysterious existence was, but since that existence had surrendered, there was no need to continue causing trouble. After all, this wasn’t the End World, so he didn’t have any enmity with the place.

Snowy was slightly unsatisfied, but she still obeyed Yang Ye.

Yang Ye sent Snowy back into the Primordial Pagoda while he flashed into the spatial crack.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Snowy didn’t return to the wooden house. How could she possibly go back there on her own accord?

Snowy sat on the black sword high up in the clouds. She was flying happily on it.

Suddenly, the black sword stopped.

Snowy blinked and patted it lightly. She was telling it to hurry up and fly!

The black sword didn’t offer any response.

Snowy looked up, and there was a woman in black standing nearby.

Snowy blinked, and then she immediately got off the sword…𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com
