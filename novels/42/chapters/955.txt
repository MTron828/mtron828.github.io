Chapter 956 – The Young Demon King!

The Young Demon King!

Yu Wushuang and Shang Qingying’s expressions changed.

In the Pine Prefecture, the human race had 5 top geniuses, and the demon race had geniuses as well. They were the 5 Young Demon Kings!

No one knew how strong these 5 Young Demon Kings were. Because they very rarely showed themselves in the human world. That was naturally because the Demon Kings of their respective clans had stopped them from doing so.

The humans protected the geniuses of their race, and the demon race did the same!

Yet now, the dean and the others had never imagined that one of the Young Demon Kings, Seng Yuan would show himself here.

The dean and the others had quite gloomy expressions on their faces.

...

A man in beast skin was standing outside Ocean of Clouds City. It didn’t seem very crude, and it had excellent workmanship instead. It was even more well-made than human clothes. However, its appearance was much inferior. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The man’s long hair hung loosely down to his shoulder, and his figure wasn’t robust. It was quite slender instead, and it made him seem extremely weak and feeble. He didn’t seem like a Young Demon King that people spoke so much about.

There were a million Steel Apes standing behind the man. All of them were pitch black and huge. Just a single finger of theirs was much larger than a human adult. They stood in rows that stretched towards the distance. While they were standing still, they created an extremely huge amount of pressure for the humans on the city walls!

At this moment, all those Steel Apes were looking at the man with gazes of fervor and respect!

Meanwhile, a man leaped off the city wall and walked towards the man, “You think you can challenge Senior Yun Hai? Why don’t you take a look in the mirror? What a joke!”

“Isn’t that Senior Zhang Qing who just ascended to the mid rank of the Half-Saint Realm? Hehe! Looks like he’s impatient to test his strength after attaining a breakthrough. That’s good. It’ll allow us to see exactly what ability that barbarian has to actually speak about challenging Senior Shangguan!”

“Haha! Demon beasts are vile beasts. They don’t realize that there’s always someone stronger in this world, and they think they are unmatched throughout the world just because they possess some strength. Based on his aura, he’s a Half-Saint at most. A mere Half-Saint actually dares to speak about challenging Senior Shangguan? How ignorant of him!”

The man in beast skin glanced at Zhang Qing, and then he shook his head, “Too weak. But since you’ve come here, then leave your life behind!”

“You think you can?” A terrifying aura suddenly erupted from within Zhang Qing. After that, he waved his hands about before a huge palm suddenly flashed into the sky. As soon as it appeared in the air, the space around the man in beast skin instantly started trembling violently, and then Zhang Qing howled furiously. The huge palm carried a terrifying force as it slapped down towards the man.

The ground quaked and space shattered before it!

It was a low-grade Saint Rank technique!

The cultivators on the city walls were excited, and they gazed at the man in beast skin as they wanted to see how he would resist such an attack.

However, the man didn’t move at all. In the end, the huge palm slapped directly against his head.

Bang!

A huge explosion resounded, and then the huge palm shattered apart. However, the man wasn’t slapped into mush. He was still standing there as if he wasn’t the one who suffered that attack!

All the spectators in the surroundings were dumbstruck!

He resisted a Saint Rank technique by force?

Zhang Qing gazed at the man in beast skin with astonishment, and his eyes were filled with disbelief.

The man shook his head, “Perhaps a Divine Rank technique would be challenging. But a Saint Rank technique? That’s too weak!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure instantly flashed over to Zhang Qing. Zhang Qing was horrified and was about to flee. However, the man’s mouth suddenly opened wide and bit Zhang Qing’s head.

After that, the spectators watched as the man actually started to eat Zhang Qing.

It didn’t take long for Zhang Qing to be eaten alive!

All the spectators on the city walls felt a chill run down their spines, and they couldn’t help but take a few steps back as they gazed at the man with horror.

The man licked his lips and swept the bits of meat on his lips into his mouth, and then he greedily sucked in a large and deep breath before he said, “The taste of humans is still so good!” As he spoke, he shot his gaze towards the city and said, “Shangguan Yunhai, you’re said to be one of the 5 top geniuses of the human world. What? You don’t even dare to step out of the city and fight me?”

“Since you’re in such a rush to die, then I’ll fulfil your wish!” Suddenly, a voice resounded from within the city, and then a ray of light suddenly shot into the sky. It tore through the sky and descended before the entrance of the city.

The ray of light dispersed to reveal a white robed young man.

The young man’s pure white robe was completely spotless, and his ink black hair fluttered with the wind. He had sharp features, a high nose, an icy cold expression, and carried a wild smile on the corners of his mouth.

“Shangguan Yunhai!” Countless people on the city walls cheered and seethed with excitement!

The reputations of the 5 top geniuses was deeply embedded in their hearts. It could be said that the 5 top geniuses were the idols of all the youths throughout Pine Prefecture!

At this moment, countless people seethed with excitement when they saw Shangguan Yunhai show himself. It was especially so for the students of Ocean of Clouds Academy. At this moment, their blood was boiling while they roared madly!

Even the members of the outer court like Feng Wuchao and the others couldn’t help but feel excited because Shangguan Yunhai was someone they admired!

Shangguan Yunhai had one of his hands behind his back as he gazed at the man in beast skin, “After all the fighting, does the demon race finally intend to go all out? That’s fine. I can concentrate on my cultivation once I deal with all of you, and then fight Lou Qianxiao a few months from now!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Shangguan Yunhai suddenly raised his right hand. In an instant, an enormous palm that could lift up the sky appeared in the air, and then it formed a fist that descended towards the man in beast skin.

It carried the might of the heavens and the earth!

Just a single punch of his possessed such might!

Countless people throughout the city were shocked and seethed with excitement!

The man in beast skin chuckled, yet he still didn’t dodge and allowed it to strike him.

Bang!

A huge explosion resounded, but the man was completely unharmed. However, Shangguan Yunhai’s attack exploded into pieces and transformed into nothingness!

All the spectators were stunned!

Shangguan Yunhai’s eyes narrowed slightly while a slightly solemn expression appeared within them.

The man patted off the specks of energy on his beast skin clothes, and then he said, “You aren’t just a little bit inferior when compared to Brother Qianxiao. No, I should say that you aren’t qualified to be equally famous as him!”

Shangguan Yunhai asked solemnly, “You’ve fought Lou Qianxiao?”

The man replied, “You know.... A few years ago, Brother Qianxiao, I, and a few others headed to the Central Divine Prefecture to temper ourselves. Only after you experience the world would you realize how laughable the titles of 5 top geniuses and 5 Young Demon Kings that were created in our prefecture are. From the moment we stepped foot into the Central Divine Prefecture, we stopped regarding ourselves as geniuses, and it’s the same even after these years. Yet all of you are still pleased with your reputation of being one of the 5 top geniuses in Pine Prefecture! It’s laughable and sad!”

Shangguan Yunhai’s face sank slightly, “No wonder I never heard anything about him in the prefecture for the last few years. So all of you went to the Central Divine Prefecture. No wonder he dared to speak arrogantly about challenging all the geniuses of our prefecture!”

“That wasn’t arrogance!” The man in beast skin said, “There really isn’t anyone beneath the Saint Realm throughout Pine Prefecture that’s a match for him. Lu Wan’er isn’t strong enough, Qing Daofu isn’t, the Void Lord isn’t, and you aren’t a match for him as well.”

“Come! Let me see exactly how strong you are after heading to the Central Divine Prefecture that it allows you to be so confident!” As soon as he finished speaking, Shangguan Yunhai’s figure transformed into a ray of light that shot forward.

At the same time, the man in beast skin transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

A ray of light and a flaming beam of light collided with each other in the sky, and then countless waves of rumbling resounded incessantly in the sky.

The world dimmed down before their battle!

The energy that erupted from their collision simply blotted out the radiance of the sun, and it caused the sky to dim down.

Countless human cultivators were still cheering incessantly from below, and they were shouting Shangguan Yunhai’s name without end.

The dean, Yu Wushuang, and the others were standing on the city wall as well. But no one noticed that the dean and the others had solemn expressions on their faces.

“What a powerful physical body. Even high-grade Saint Rank techniques can’t harm him!” Instructor Zhuo suddenly muttered softly.

The black robed old man by Instructor Zhuo’s side spoke solemnly, “His body is just a step away from attaining the Saint Realm!”

Another one of the old men at the Saint Realm suddenly said, “Yunhai is in danger!”

The dean was looking up into the sky while his brows were knit tightly together. He said, “Sky Divine Hall and the Ape Demon King were truly quite bold. They actually didn’t hesitate to send their children to the Central Divine Prefecture so that their children could grow stronger. They really were daring indeed!”

The black robed old man sighed softly, “The Central Divine Prefecture is filled with experts, and it’s a place where the strong survive and the weak perish. Lou Qianxiao and Seng Yuan’s natural talents were already very good, and they were respectively fostered by the full force of Sky Divine Hall and the Ape Clan, so their strengths were already extremely formidable. Now, they’ve even returned from tempering themselves in the Central Divine Prefecture. Regardless of whether it’s their mental state or experiences, both are much different than what they were. Once their mental state and experience has grown, their strengths would naturally grow stronger along with the hard work they put into it. As for Yunhai and the others....” He didn’t speak further once he spoke up to this point.

“We were too softhearted in the end.” The dean shook his head, “For the sake of protecting Yunhai and the others, we practically sent Saints along to protect them whenever they left the academy. But we never realized that would actually be harmful to them! How could a tiger that grew up in captivity compare to a king of the jungle? From the moment Lou Qianxiao and the others entered the Central Divine Prefecture, Yunhai and the others had actually lost! And we have lost the battle as well!”

One of the Saints spoke abruptly, “Yunhai has lost!”

Bang!

As soon as he finished speaking, an explosion resounded in the sky, and then a black hole that blotted out the sky appeared high above. However, it didn’t take long for the Laws of the Heaven Dao to repair the black hole, and then a figure crashed down from the sky and smashed against the ground.

It was Shangguan Yunhai!!

The voices on the city walls that were shouting Shangguan Yunhai’s name had stopped abruptly. All of them were flabbergasted and had stiffened on the spot.

Meanwhile, a soft voice could be heard, “From this day onward, the human race of Pine Prefecture will only have 4 top geniuses left!”
