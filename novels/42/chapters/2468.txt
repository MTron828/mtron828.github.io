Chapter 2469 – Just Don’t Kill Them!

Bloodline!

The blood within Yang Ye surged like lava, and strands of blood surged throughout Yang Ye’s body! Moreover, the swords in Yang Ye’s grasp had been covered by a thin layer of blood red light.

“AARGH!” A hysterical roar resounded within the barrier, and then Yang Ye slashed both his swords forward.

Hiss!

The barrier around Yang Ye instantly exploded apart.

The barrier was gone!

As for the energy unleashed by the middle aged man, it was sliced open by Yang Ye’s attack, and then Yang Ye’s figure shot through along with his swords!

A ray of sword energy shot through the middle aged man’s chest, and his figure stiffened.

Yang Ye was behind the middle aged man, but it only took a moment for his figure to crash down as well.

He was exhausted!

At this point in the battle, he’d truly reached his limits. Both his soul and body were at their limit. At this moment, he couldn’t even move a muscle! He’d been relying on that last bit of determination to fight until the end, and now, even that was gone!

Suddenly, a few dozen people charged over from the surroundings!

It was Zhao Wuji’s group!

Yang Ye’s eyes were closed. He sensed their arrival, but he didn’t have the strength to do anything about it.

Yang Ye was absolutely satisfied by the battle he just had! He’d been able to fight without holding back at all!

It was a truly enjoyable battle!

Zhao Wuji and the others stared at Yang Ye’s figure on the ground, and excitement and ferocity filled their eyes. Yang Ye was right before them, and they would have nothing to worry about once they killed him! Moreover, as far as they were concerned, Yang Ye was at his weakest right now.

Not only would they have no worries once Yang Ye was dead, they would obtain the Sprite Progenitor and all the treasures in Yang Ye’s possession!

The more they thought about it, the more excited they became!

It didn’t take long for them to arrive before Yang Ye. Suddenly, a woman appeared by Yang Ye’s side.

It was An Nanjing!

An Nanjing glanced at them and said, “I’ll leave them to all of you!”

On the Ascension Platform in the Primordial Pagoda, Erya cracked a smile, “Dragon, all of you’ve been leeching off of Big Brother Yang for so long, so it’s time to do something! I’m not interested in these weaklings, so I’ll leave them to all of you!”

All of the demons immediately left the pagoda once they received her orders!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda, Zhao Wuji’s group was stunned when they saw so many Primal Demons before them! Especially when there was an actual Primal True Dragon before them!

When Snowy saw the state Yang Ye was in, Snowy immediately started crying on An Nanjing’s shoulder. After that, she gazed at Zhao Wuji’s group, and her eyes were filled with anger. She pointed at them, and then made a beheading gesture.

Oxxy was the first to charge over!

He was always Snowy’s most loyal follower!

The dragon and the others weren’t much slower. All of them charged at Zhao Wuji’s group.

Zhao Wuji and the others turned absolutely pale! However, they had no way out now and could only face the battle before them!

An Nanjing, Snowy, and Erya ignored Zhao Wuji’s group, and they gazed at Yang Ye instead. At this moment, Yang Ye was in an extremely horrifying state, and his body was on the verge of shattering.

If it wasn’t for the Primordial Violet Energy, Yang Ye would be dead by now!

Erya placed a finger before Yang Ye’s nose, and a short while passed before she cracked a smile at Snowy and An Nanjing, “He’s still breathing!”

Snowy glared at Erya, and An Nanjing glanced at her too, causing the latter to hurriedly admit her mistakes, “I-I won’t make jokes like that again!” She hurriedly stood obediently behind An Nanjing once she finished speaking.

An Nanjing naturally wouldn’t make a fuss about it. Erya was just a child, and she was like that with everyone.

An Nanjing glanced at Yang Ye, and her face eased up slightly. It didn’t take long for her to look toward the side. The middle aged man’s body hadn’t fully vanished.

The middle aged man was about to speak when a spear suddenly stabbed into his head!

Erya was horrified by this, and even Snowy was quite afraid.

It could be said that Yang Ye wasn’t the most terrifying in the Primordial Pagoda, nor was it Erya or Snowy, it was An Nanjing!

An Nanjing squatted down and was about to transport Yang Ye into the Primordial Pagoda, but as soon as she touched him, a wave of powerful blood red light rippled out from him. The blood red light pushed An Nanjing back quite a distance!

An Nanjing glanced at her hand, and her skin had actually been blasted off!

An Nanjing gazed at Yang Ye, “His bloodline?”

“Indeed!” Suddenly, Sword Scroll appeared beside An Nanjing.

An Nanjing gazed at Sword Scroll, and the latter spoke softly, “His bloodline has been activated, or I should say that it has been fully activated. Now, it has been transformed into the purest version of the Yang Clan’s Mad Demon Bloodline! His bloodline is modifying his body, and it’s instinctively protecting its owner right now. He will know exactly how he has changed, so let’s just wait and see!”

An Nanjing nodded and looked to the right. The demons were in battle with Zhao Wuji’s group.

Suppression!

Those demons were simply crushing Zhao Wuji’s group! Most of the human experts had already been killed. No, they had been devoured alive!

An Nanjing moved her gaze away and looked toward the side. At the end of the bridge was a strange wall, the Universe Wall!

Sword Scroll spoke softly, “Break through that wall and you’ll get to Eternal Kingdom!”

An Nanjing replied indifferently, “Will that be the beginning or the end?”

Obviously, she was speaking about Yang Ye’s problems.

Sword Scroll spoke solemnly, “The beginning! Based on what that Five World Realm expert told Yang Ye, Eternal Kingdom needs Snowy. They want to use Snowy to produce an endless supply of spirit energy for Eternal Kingdom. It’s linked to the eternal preservation and survival of Eternal Kingdom, so they won’t give up. However, now that Yang Ye has killed a Five World Realm expert, they won’t rashly send another. Even if they do, they will send someone stronger.”

An Nanjing glanced at Snowy who was lying by Yang Ye’s side, and her gaze became gentle, “So, how much do you think she’s worth if we sold her?”

Sword Scroll was stunned speechless.

Sell the Sprite Progenitor?

She was a priceless treasure!

It didn’t take long for Sword Scroll to start smiling instead. She realized that An Nanjing had started being mischievous too!

“Ah!” Suddenly, a hysterical cry resounded from afar.

An Nanjing and Sword Scroll looked over, and they saw Zhao Wuji being torn apart by the Primal True Dragon before being swallowed.

The battle was over!

Zhao Wuji and the others were all dead!

An Nanjing glanced at the dragon and the other demon beasts, “They need to fight!”

Sword Scroll nodded. If they didn’t fight frequently, it wouldn’t be long before they became weaklings who were raised on a farm.

An Nanjing gazed at Erya, “From now on, they’ll be under you. You will teach them. Right, it’s basically beating them up, just don’t kill them.”

Erya felt speechless.

Battle!

All the demon beasts had to fight incessantly because only incessant battle could help them maintain their combat strength. Otherwise, if they continued without fighting for a long time, they would probably even forget how to fight!

Just like that, their days of misery began.

It was especially so for the Primal Royal Crocodile because Erya couldn’t stand the sight of it! Now, she finally had an excuse to beat it up!

As soon as she thought of that, Erya was exceptionally happy, and then she immediately summoned all the demon beasts into the pagoda.

On the Ascension Platform, Erya placed her hands behind her back, and then she walked by all the demon beasts, “I presume all of you have heard. Yes, Big Sister An gave me a mission, and it’s to beat all of you up. Oh, no, I meant to train all of you. Do you know what training is? It doesn’t matter if you don’t. In any case, you just have to understand that all of you will have to receive training from now on, just like I do. Big Sister An will train me, and I will train all of you! You don’t have any objections to that, right? If you do, go ahead and tell me. I guarantee that I won’t kill you. Oh, I mean, I’ll reason with you. I, Erya, am a reasonable person!”

All the demons on the Ascension Platform exchanged glances. Meanwhile, the Primal Royal Crocodile suddenly said, “I don’t need training!”

Swoosh!

All the others gazed at the crocodile!

The crocodile felt a chill run down its spine, and it wondered if it had said something wrong!

Oxxy shook his head. What a stupid crocodile.

Even Oxxy had realized that Erya was looking for someone to make an example of! She was looking for someone and that fool just had to offer up itself!

Suddenly, Erya walked over to the crocodile, “Why don’t you need training?”

The crocodile was clearly quite afraid of her. It hesitated for a moment and said, “I don’t need it. I-I…”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Suddenly, Erya slammed a punch at its head.

Bang!

The crocodile was blasted away, and it glared at Erya once it crawled up from the ground, “You…”

Suddenly, Erya shot over and kicked its head, causing it to be kicked away again.

All the others here were speechless.

The crocodile crawled up again, and there was a vicious glow in its eyes. It charged at Erya!

The others shook their heads and couldn’t bear to watch when they saw this!

It only took a moment for the crocodile to arrive in front of Erya, and then it bit at her!

Obviously, its instinct as a demon had been fully aroused by her!

Erya remained indifferent as she shot up into the air and slammed her fist against its mouth. The powerful force of the collision blasted the crocodile away. Moreover, countless teeth accompanied by blood flew out of its mouth!

Erya didn’t stop after she punched it away, and she charged over and kicked it again.

Bang!

The crocodile growled with pain as it flew once more!

The crocodile was about to climb back up when Erya’s foot stomped down on its head. A vicious and ferocious glow still remained in the crocodile’s eyes, and as soon as she noticed that, Erya immediately slapped it on its head.

Bang!

Even its scales were slapped apart!

Erya kicked its stomach, and the latter was kicked over 300m away.

Erya walked over to it and stomped her foot down on its head, “You don’t need training? Tell me, why don’t you need training? I’m so strong, yet I still have to be beaten up by Big Sister An. No, I mean I still have to be trained by Big Sister An. You’re so weak yet you don’t want to be trained? Are you trying to live here for free? Now, I’ll give you a chance to reconsider. Answer me! Do you want to accept your training?”
