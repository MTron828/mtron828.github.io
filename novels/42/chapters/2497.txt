Chapter 2498 – I’ve Changed My Mind!

As soon as the sword entered his grasp, Yang Ye’s aura instantly underwent a tremendous change!

This was a peerless sword cultivator!

At this moment, such an absurd thought had appeared in their minds.

But Ye Xuan had a solemn expression on her face.

At her level of cultivation, she was able to sense if someone was strong.

Suddenly, Yang Ye tapped his foot against the ground, and his finger swished as it transformed into a ray of light that flashed through the air.

Fast!

Ye Xuan’s pupils constricted at the sight of this attack. It felt very dangerous to her!

Ye Xuan didn’t dare to act carefully in the slightest and waved her hand lightly. In an instant, a huge mirror appeared before her, and then a wave of powerful energy rippled out from the mirror.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword arrived.

Hiss!

A ray of light flashed!Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Bang!

The mirror shook violently, and then cracks appeared all over it.

Ye Xuan was shocked, and she hurriedly put the mirror away. It was a Divine Treasure, and she didn’t want to get it destroyed here. After that, she made a clawing motion, and a white whip appeared in her grasp.

She raised her hand, and then the whip descended!

Crack!

As soon as it descended, a long mark appeared in space.

However, Yang Ye’s sword energy was faster!

Bang!

Ye Xuan was blasted away, and then a sword pierced her body.

The scene froze!

Everyone was stunned!

Yang Ye gazed at Ye Xuan’s pale face, and then he waved his right hand. The sword in her chest suddenly flew out of her and returned to his grasp. Meanwhile, blood sprayed from her chest!

It was extremely shocking!

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Do you know now?”

Once he finished speaking, he flicked the sword back into the sheath on Xue Yiren’s waist.

Yang Ye gazed at Mo Ya and the others, “Let’s go!”

They nodded and were about to leave when Lu Yunxian suddenly gazed at Ye Xuan, “Are you Ye Xuan from the Ye Clan?”

The others gazed at him.

Meanwhile, the hold in Ye Xuan’s chest actually started to gradually heal. Moreover, a ball of green light appeared there.

It was healing!

She glanced at Yang Ye, and then she gazed at Lu Yunxian, “Who are you?”

Lu Yunxian pondered deeply for a moment and said, “The Lu Clan!”

The Lu Clan!

Ye Xuan sized up Lu Yunxian and said, “Their successor?”

Lu Yunxian shook his head, “No!”

“Oh.” Ye Xuan moved her gaze away. The Lu Clan was a clan in the South Region, and it could be considered as a subordinate clan of the Ye Clan. It was one of the clans that ate at the Ye Clan’s table.

Meanwhile, Lu Yunxian hesitated for a moment and said, “Actually, this may be a misunderstanding because Brother Ye is from the Ye Clan too!”

Ye Xuan frowned slightly and gazed at Yang Ye, “Him?”

Lu Yunxian nodded.

Ye Xuan’s frown deepened, “Impossible!”

Lu Yunxian said, “Brother Ye is just part of a branch family, not a main family member!”

“Impossible!” Ye Xuan spoke solemnly, “If he were part of a branch family, that branch family would have reported the existence of someone with such strength, and he would be allowed into the central part of the Ye Clan.”

Lu Yunxuan said, “Brother Ye’s identity is a little unique. H-He’s an illegitimate child.”

An illegitimate child!

Ye Xuan’s frown deepened again!

The Ye Clan had countless branches. As far as she knew, there were over 100 of them. They did still belong to the Ye Clan, but they were pushed out of the central part of the Ye Clan.

As for an illegitimate child, not to mention in the branch families, such a person had quite an awkward position even in the main family. Because such people were looked down upon and pushed aside! So, geniuses who grew up in such environments definitely held resentment toward the clan.

Ye Xuan pondered deeply for a long time before she gazed at Yang Ye, “Which branch are you from?”

Which branch?

Yang Ye was quite speechless. He too would like to know which branch he was from. Yang Ye shook his head. He didn’t choose to answer her question and just walked away.

Ye Xuan frowned at the sight of this. After all, people from the branch family would be extremely humble before people from the main family!

However, when she thought of Yang Ye’s terrifying strength, she could understand why he acted in that way. He had the right to be proud.

The black robed man by her side said, “Ye Xuan, he… he’s just an illegitimate child from a branch family. We…”

Ye Xuan glanced coldly at him, “With his strength and talent, do you think the clan would let him stay in the branch families?”

The black robed man didn’t dare to say another word.

Ye Xuan spoke solemnly, “Our clan has many branches, and he clearly has no sense of belonging to the clan. Not only does he have no sense of belonging to our clan, he has no sense of belonging to his branch family either. After all, someone like him would have definitely grown up being cast aside. His viciousness and desire to kill is too strong.”

She fell silent at this point.

The others behind her didn’t dare to say a word either.

A long time passed before she said, “Send a message back to the clan. Ask them to find out if there’s anyone named Ye Yang in our branch families. He’s very strong and possesses excellent talent. His departure from the clan would be a loss for our clan!”

The black robed man hesitated for a moment and nodded.

Meanwhile, Lu Yunxian walked over to Yang Ye, “Sorry, I exposed your identity without asking for your approval!”

Yang Ye replied, “You did it for a reason, right?”

Based on his impression of Lu Yunxian, the latter wasn’t a rash person, or a busybody.

Lu Yunxian spoke solemnly, “That person you almost killed was Ye Xuan, she’s one of the Ye Clan’s Patriarch’s daughters. She’s ranked the second in the Ye Clan’s younger generation, and those guys by her side were all from the main family. They are quite vengeful. So, if we just left like that, they would definitely use how you injured Ye Xuan to take revenge on you. While they are no match for you, the Ye Clan has a genius. Ye Xuan’s elder sister, Ye Zhibei. She’s considered an extraordinary genius in Eternal Kingdom, and she was recruited by the War Dimension many years ago!”

Recruited!

Yang Ye had heard that the War Dimension would recruit some extraordinary geniuses. Those geniuses were unlike them because they had been recruited and didn’t have to pass any tests, but they had a test to pass!

Yang Ye asked, “You’re worried that Ye Zhibei would come for me?”

Lu Yunxian nodded, “Every clan is very united. Of course, they may not come seeking revenge from you. However, to avoid unnecessary trouble, revealing your identity is beneficial. Moreover, it may be of use to you once you’re in War City. Because Ye Zhibei is really very strong. She attained the Five World Realm five years ago.”

“I’ve heard of her too!” Meanwhile, Mo Ya spoke abruptly, “When Ye Zhibei attained the Five World Realm, the Ye Clan even sent out invitations to all the clans and powers throughout the South Region. Besides that, the War Dimension stretched out an olive branch to her.”

Yang Ye smiled, “They show off that much?”

Lu Yunxian explained, “They do that for a reason. Besides Ye Zhibei, the Ye Clan hasn’t had an extraordinary genius in many years. A large clan, and especially one like theirs will easily draw covetous gazes without someone capable in its younger generation. Just like the Di Clan from many, many years ago. They were driven out because their younger generation weren’t capable enough. The competition between clans is brutal!”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Brother Ye, clans take geniuses very seriously. Based on your talent and strength, the Ye Clan will definitely do everything it can to foster you!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t want to go to them!”

Mo Ya said, “Brother Ye, do you know why those fellows by Ye Xuan’s side were able to attain the Two World Realm? Not just them, we are the same too. Besides our own talent, the real reason all of us were able to attain the Limitbreaker Realm at our age is actually the resources given to us by our clans. Without those resources, your attainments may be inferior even if your natural talent is superb. It can be said that we members of these clans have our cultivations pushed up with money!”

Xue Yiren nodded slightly and chimed in, “They are right. Brother Ye, a single person’s ability is limited. Based on your strength and talent, you’ll definitely achieve great things with the Ye Clan’s help.”

Yang Ye was quite speechless. He was just a fake member of the Ye Clan!

At this moment, Yang Ye really regretted giving such a random excuse to the Ancient Sword Sect’s elder. Now, he had to use countless other lies to deal with that one lie. It was such a pain!

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and smiled, “I know you have good intentions, but it’s a little more complicated than that. We’ll see what happens.”

They nodded and didn’t say anything else. It all depended on Yang Ye’s own decision.

They sped up, and an ancient city finally appeared within their fields of vision a day later.

The ancient city was huge and had its back to a mountain range. A boundless plain stood on both sides of the city.

War City!

Mo Ya and the others were visibly relieved when they saw the city. They shot forward at full speed and finally arrived before the city.

Enter the city!

So long as they entered the city, they would have truly joined the War Dimension!

They exchanged glances and strode swiftly toward the city.

It didn’t take long for them to arrive before its gates. But right when they were about to walk through it, a bald man and a man with a huge saber resting against his shoulder appeared before them.

The bald man sized up Yang Ye’s group. In the end, his gaze descended upon Mo Ya, and there was an evil smile on the corner of his mouth, “You want to enter the city?”

Xue Yiren nodded, “We’re from the Ancient Sword Sect, and…”

The bald man waved his hand, “Don’t tell me all of that. I don’t care. You can enter the city if you want, but a World Crystal each is the price. Or 150 Divine Crystals works too!”

Xue Yiren frowned when he heard this. Meanwhile, Yang Ye flicked four World Crystals over to the bald man.

The others were stunned by this, and even the bald man and the man with the saber were stunned too.

Yang Ye gazed at Mo Ya and the others, “Let’s not waste time and get inside!”

He didn’t want any trouble, so he was buying his way in!

Mo Ya and the others nodded, and they were about to enter the city with Yang Ye when the bald man suddenly said, “I’ve changed my mind! One isn’t enough! I want at least five each!”

As he spoke, he gazed at Yang Ye and grinned while stretching out his hand.
