Chapter 1596 - Self Detonation!

Translator: InVader

Yang Ye was delighted when he heard her, “You’ve recovered your memories?”

Little Sky shook her head, “I meant allow me to get help!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she waved her hand. In an instant, a small ball of flames appeared in front of her. A moment later, a wave of terrifying flames erupted from it. The wave of flames was extremely swift, and it instantly enveloped the spear-wielding man.

The Heavenblaze Emperor Flame!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He knew that it was the Heavenblaze Emperor Flame that Little Sky had spoken of in the past! Even though it was inferior to the Divine Yin Flame, just a single glance told him that it was absolutely not something he could resist right now.

In the wave of flames, numerous rays of light were shooting out incessantly. These rays of light divided the wave of flames into segments. However, it only took an instant for the flames to close the gap and continue enveloping the spear-wielding man.

“Souldream Strike!” Suddenly, the middle aged man’s furious howl resounded from within the wave of flames. After that, a ray of light shot upwards. Once it shot up around 300m, it suddenly slashed downwards!

bang!

An explosion resounded. The flames rose up like a tsunami, and they instantly transformed the surroundings into an ocean of flames. However, it didn’t take long for the flames to vanish without a trace. At the same time, a small ball of flames appeared in front of Little Sky.

The middle aged man who stood in the distance seemed to be in an extremely miserable state. The tip of his spear was broken, and his chest was jet black. Moreover, half his face was mangled, causing him to appear extremely terrifying!

Amazing! Yang Ye glanced at the small ball of flames again. It was much stronger than he’d imagined! He’d personally experienced the middle aged man’s strength, but the Heavenblaze Emperor Flame had actually reduced him to such a state!

It was extraordinarily strong!

The middle aged man had an extremely solemn expression in his eyes. Obviously, he hadn’t expected such a ball of flames to appear abruptly, and it was actually so strong!

Suddenly, Little Sky said, “Little Flame, burn him to death!”

The small ball of flames trembled slightly, and then it transformed into a pillar of flames that shot towards the middle aged man. It was so swift that Yang Ye wasn’t even able to see it clearly. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then the middle aged man was blasted 3km away.

As soon as he stopped himself, the small ball of flames appeared in front of him again, and then it exploded apart. It transformed into a fire phoenix that enveloped the middle aged man.

The middle aged man would naturally not stand there idly and wait for death to arrive. He immediately swung his spear swiftly. At this moment, he wasn’t holding back at all.

Numerous rays of light surged out incessantly from the center of the fire phoenix. In the beginning, the fire phoenix was sliced into over a dozen segments, but every single time it was cut apart, it would recover swiftly. So, the middle aged man was constantly enveloped by it.

Just like that, around 15 minutes passed, and the surroundings gradually returned to calm.

The flame dispersed, and the small ball of flames returned to Little Sky while the middle aged man stood not too far ahead of them.

The middle aged man gazed at the ball of flames for quite some time, and then he said, “How strong…”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure gradually turned ethereal and vanished on the spot.

He was dead!

Yang Ye slowly clenched his fists tightly while his gaze descended onto the ball of flames again. Besides the Divine Yin Flame, it was the strongest flame he’d laid eyes on until now!

Little Sky’s face remained indifferent. She looked up at the black robed experts who were still in battle with the Eyes of the Heaven Dao. At this moment, less than 50 of the black robed men remained, and over a dozen Eyes of the Heaven Dao had vanished as well.

Little Sky gazed at them for a long time, and then she spoke coldly, “Kill them all!”

The small ball of flames trembled slightly, and then countless pillars of flames shot up into the sky.

The black robed men who were fighting against the Eyes of the Heaven Dao noticed this, and their expressions changed drastically. Just the Eyes of the Heaven Dao were extremely strenuous to deal with. Now that these mysterious and powerful pillars of flames were shooting at them, how would they resist them?

However, they had no choice but to resist them. Because the Eyes of the Heaven Dao in the sky had locked onto them. If they wanted to flee, the only way was to flee towards Sky Sky Continent. As for escaping Merak System, they would have to destroy the Eyes of the Heaven Dao to accomplish that!

They were facing enemies from both sides!

“Ah!” Shrill cries resounded incessantly in the sky. In just a few breaths of time, six black robed experts perished, and the speed they were perishing at was rising incessantly.

Yang Ye glanced at Little Sky. At this moment, she had an indifferent expression on her face. She was really angry. Actually, it made sense. Little Sky really cared a great deal about this world, but the Nether Pavilion wanted to plunder this world. So, it was absolutely intolerable to Little Sky.

More and more black robed experts were dying. At this moment, only around 30 of them remained.

Bang!

Suddenly, a loud explosion resounded from far away, and then the entire area shook violently. After that, the Nether Judge and the young boy appeared.

The expressions of those black robed experts had instantly changed when they saw the Nether Judge. Because the Nether Judge’s right arm was gone! Moreover, there was a jade flute stuck in his chest.

The Nether Judge had lost!

At this moment, all the black robed experts felt slight despair.

The Nether Judge gazed at the boy for a long time and said, “You’re really strong!”

The boy glanced at the Nether Judge, “You’re not bad yourself. Besides the Unfettered One and her, you’re the strongest expert I’ve met!”

“He?” The Nether Judge’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he gazed at Little Sky, “Her?”

The boy looked up at the Eyes of the Heaven Dao in the sky, and then he said, “I don’t know the Nether Pavilion, but I can imagine that it’s definitely extremely strong. However, even if you are able to successfully conquer this universe in the end, you’ll pay a price that you can’t endure!”

The Nether Judge asked in a low voice, “Why?”

The boy gazed at the Nether Judge, “Because she was chosen by all the living beings of this universe. She is loved and protected by them. Even the Unfettered One respected her and didn’t challenge her.”

The Nether Judge glanced at Little Sky and fell silent.

Meanwhile, the space in the surroundings shook once more, and then Qin and Fan Yinyu appeared here.

The black robed experts in the surroundings grew even more despaired when they saw Fan Yinyu. At this moment, Fan Yinyu’s hair was completely white. Moreover, her face was covered in wrinkles. She was like an old woman who was on the verge of death!

As for Qin, based on her outward appearance, she seemed quite fine. However, the Paramita Flower in her grasp had withered.

The Nether Judge glanced at Fan Yinyu, and his expression grew even more solemn. He knew her strength very well, and he hadn’t expected that the one-legged young girl would actually be able to reduce her to such a state!

At this moment, he knew that the Nether Pavilion had underestimated its enemy. It had truly underestimated its enemy!

Qin walked over to Little Sky’s side, and then she spoke softly, “Little Sky, I can’t kill her. Sorry!”

Little Sky took Qin’s hand and said, “It’s fine. It’s very difficult to kill experts in her realm of cultivation. Being able to exhaust her lifespan and make her lose her ability to fight is good enough.”

Qin nodded, and then she gazed at the Paramita Flower in her grasp while a wisp of sadness flashed through her eyes, “It really is a pity. But it’s fine. I can grow another in the future. In any case, I have a huge amount of time!”

Little Sky hugged Qin, and then she turned to look at Yang Ye, “Can you help me do something?”

Yang Ye nodded, “What is it?”

She glanced at Qin’s sole leg and said, “Help her grow back her other leg, alright?”

Yang Ye glanced at Qin and said, “It’s not a problem, of course. However, at her realm of cultivation, can’t she do it herself?”

Little Sky shook her head, “She’s a little special. I’ll tell you in detail later. It’s fine so long as you agree to help.”

As she spoke, she turned to look at the Nether Judge’s group, “I gave all of you a chance, but you didn’t cherish it. So, die!”

She waved her hand.

Qin, the young boy, and the ball of flames instantly charged at the Nether Judge’s group.

“Retreat! Try to save as many as you can!” The Nether Judge immediately decided to retreat. He turned around and went up into space, and then he waved his brush upwards.

Bang!

A huge rift was instantly sliced open in the space above him, and then he turned around and charged at the boy and the others.

The black robed experts exchanged glances. Meanwhile, the Nether Judge’s voice resounded once more, “Envoy Fan, take them and leave. Don’t let my death be in vain. Tell the Pavilion Master to think twice before taking action!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the Nether Judge was already in front of the young boy and the others. After that, he stretched out a finger and pressed it down hard against the center of his forehead. In an instant, an extremely terrifying aura surged out from within him, and the aura instantly blasted the young boy and the others around 3km back.

However, that wasn’t the end of it. The Nether Judge’s stomach started to expand swiftly, and his aura became extremely violent!

Self-detonation!

The expressions of everyone here changed when they witnessed this scene.
