Chapter 2165 – Our Emperor is Invincible!

The cracks on the statue were spreading faster and faster, and it didn’t take long for the statue to transform into dirt.

However, the Netherworld Destiny in the statue’s grasp had fallen before Tian Xiu, but it was a stone sculpture.

Snowy blinked, touched it lightly with her claw, and then gazed at Tian Xiu.

Tian Xiu gazed at Snowy too. The two little fellows gazed at each other, and then Snowy grabbed Netherworld Destiny and passed it to Tian Xiu. Tian Xiu hesitated for a moment, and then she took it in her grasp. In an instant, a ray of black light flashed out of it, but both of them didn’t notice the black light.

Tian Xiu glanced at it and spoke softly, “This is a rock!”

Snowy shook her head, and she started waving her claws to convey that it was a treasure.

“It’s a treasure?” Tian Xiu blinked, and then she passed it to Snowy, “Help me take a look at it!”

Snowy blinked. She didn’t refuse and took it. She studied it for quite some time before opening her mouth slightly and ceaselessly spitting spirit energy on it. However, it didn’t react at all.

There was bewilderment on her face. She thought for a moment, and then she struck it with her claw, but it still didn’t react.

In the end, she gazed at Tian Xiu.

Tian Xiu took it, hesitated for a moment, and then knocked it against the ground.

Crack!

A clear and loud crack resounded, and then both the little fellows watched with astonishment as the ground cracked open. Moreover, it didn’t just stop here. At this moment, the ground of the entire planet had cracked open.

If one looked down at this planet from high above in space, one would notice that it seemed like an egg that had been struck against something hard.

Tian Xiu and Snowy exchanged glances, and there a trace of fear appeared in their eyes.

They’d caused trouble!

That was what they thought.

Meanwhile, Snowy snuck a glance at Yang Ye and An Nanjing, and then she raised her paw and placed it in front of her mouth, telling Tian Xiu to keep quiet.

Tian Xiu hurriedly nodded.

A short while later, the two little fellows had carefully snuck away.

Once they left, the middle aged man appeared abruptly where they had been.

He glanced at the surroundings and fell silent for a long time. After that, he shook his head and vanished on the spot.

…

Tian Xiu and Snowy didn’t return there, and they just started prancing around the ruins. There were graves all over the ruins. Those graves were huge and over 30m wide, each. As for the amount of them, there were hundreds.

Snowy glanced at the surroundings. This place was slightly gloomy and cold, so she didn’t really like it. Suddenly, Tian Xiu grabbed her little paw, and said, “L-Let’s leave a little later, alright?”

Snowy hesitated for a moment and waved her claws, she was saying that there were no treasures here.

Tian Xiu spoke softly, “L-Let’s just stay for a while! Alright?”

Snowy nodded lightly, and then she glanced at the surroundings. In the end, she leaped up onto Tian Xiu’s shoulder because it made her feel safer.

Tian Xiu glanced at the graves. She just looked and looked at them, and then two streams of tears flowed down her eyes.

Snowy was at a loss for words.

Suddenly, Tian Xiu knelt down slowly, “I swear on destiny that I’m willing to fall into eternal damnation if I can’t annihilate our enemies!”

Meanwhile, Snowy gently rubbed Tian Xiu’s head.

Tian Xiu stood up slowly while a trace of bewilderment could be seen in her eyes, but it didn’t take long for her eyes to clear up. She walked slowly towards the depths of the graveyard, and it didn’t take long for her to arrive before a river. The river was very clear, and its bottom was clearly visible.

Snowy gazed at Tian Xiu while bewilderment filled her eyes.

Tian Xiu spoke softly, “Snowy, so many people died here in the past.”

Snowy was at a loss for words.

Snowy’s thoughts were actually very simple. Stay with Yang Ye, find treasures, and have fun. She really wasn’t very interested in complicated things.

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu suddenly looked up at the sky. There were ripples in her eyes, and a scene appeared in her mind:

A gray sky. Rain.

A woman in a violet robe stood in the sky. She stood there with her right hand behind her back, and a strange weapon was in her left grasp.

It was Netherworld Destiny!

There were around 30 people on the ground below her. All of them were slightly bigger in size than humans, and their appearance differed slightly from humans too. All of them wore blue robes.

There were a few hundred robust demon beasts behind them. These demon beasts looked rather ferocious. They had long fangs and emanated a vicious aura.

Far away behind these demon beasts was countless cities.

The world was silent, and only the sound of breathing could be heard.

Some time passed before the woman in the air suddenly opened her eyes. She looked up into the depths of space, “If we win, our race survives; lose, and we die!”

“Win!” Countless voices shouted in unison from the cities in the distance, “Our Emperor is invincible!”

Our Emperor is invincible!

The entire world was filled with clamorous noise.

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu suddenly withdrew her gaze, and the scene stopped.

A long time passed before she gazed at the river, “I’ll come back another day. Let’s go!”

She took Snowy with her and left.

…

Meanwhile, Yang Ye and An Nanjing were still cultivating in the hall with the energy of the universe. As far as Yang Ye was concerned, it was painful yet happy. The gravity in the hall was much more terrifying than he’d imagined, and it was extremely difficult to cultivate here. In the past, he’d been able to swing his sword countless times in a single breath of time, yet now, he could only swing it once. That was his limit!

Even breathing was quite difficult beneath this gravity.

However, he knew that cultivating beneath it was absolutely beneficial to him. So long as he could get used to it, then his strength would definitely become extremely terrifying when he returned to a normal environment.

Of course, it was torture now. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The middle aged man wasn’t too far away, and there was a full roasted goat in front of the middle aged man. The middle aged man had completely ignored them and was just eating.

Suddenly, Tian Xiu and Snowy pranced over.

He glanced at them and continued eating.

Meanwhile, Snowy suddenly went over to the middle aged man. She gazed at the roasted goat, hesitated for a moment, and then pointed at it.

The middle aged man asked, “You want to eat?”

Snowy nodded, and then she opened her paw and an immortal crystal fell before the middle aged man.

Buy!

Snowy’s intentions were obvious. After she gave it to him, she tore off a piece of meat and put it in her mouth. It only took a moment for her eyes to open wide, and she blinked rapidly!

It was tasty!

After that, Snowy tore off another piece…

The middle aged man felt speechless.

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu walked over and spoke softly, “Is it very tasty?”

Snowy nodded, passed an immortal crystal to the middle aged man, and then tore off another piece and passed it to Tian Xiu. The latter hesitated for a moment and ate it.

A moment later, Tian Xiu’s eyes lit up, “It’s really tasty!”

Snowy cracked a smile.

Suddenly, the middle aged man gazed at Tian Xiu, “Where are you from?”

She gazed at the middle aged man, hesitated for a moment, and said, “I don’t know!”

“You don’t know?” The middle aged man was slightly stunned, and then he spoke softly, “Then where do you plan to go?”

Tian Xiu thought for a moment, and then she said, “Stay with Big Brother and Snowy!”

Big Brother!

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye. At this moment, Yang Ye was still training with his sword techniques.

The middle aged man restrained his gaze and looked at Tian Xiu again, “Why?”

She gazed at him, “Why not?”

The middle aged man shook his head and smiled, “Of course you can. But he’s in a lot of danger right now. Aren’t you afraid?”

Tian Xiu shook her head, “Big Brother will protect me!”

Snowy quickly nodded to display her agreement!

The middle aged man smiled, and he didn’t say another word before continuing eating.

Just like that, An Nanjing and Yang Ye cultivated madly all day while Snowy and Tian Xiu would come and take a look from time to time. But they spent most of their time running around and exploring.

Tian Xiu seemed to know this place a little, so she frequently led Snowy to strange places.

Since the middle aged man was here, Yang Ye didn’t stop the little fellows and let them explore as they pleased.

In the hall.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground, and Judgment was in front of him.

During this time, he’d been training in the basics every day. For example, stabbing, chopping, flicking, slashing, and so on. The middle aged man had asked him to train in these moves. According to the middle aged man, these basics were the most important at many times.

After months of bitter training, the middle aged man barely felt that he’d passed.

Now, he had to train with sword techniques!

He had to train with Burial and Backstab while the gravity here pressed down upon him!

Suddenly, Yang Ye grabbed Judgment and vanished on the spot. However, he didn’t appear where he wanted to appear because the gravity here had made him many times slower. Now, even an ordinary cultivator could dodge his Backstab.

It was truly too slow!

Yang Ye was extremely dissatisfied with it!

Train! Train like a madman!

His current task was to train with Backstab until it was as fast as when he previously used it in the outside world!
