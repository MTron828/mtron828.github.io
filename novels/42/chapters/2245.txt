Chapter 2246 – The Sword Domain!

It was a blow to his confidence!

As far as Yang Ye was concerned, it was the biggest blow to his confidence in his entire lifetime.

The Sword Domain!

Once his strongest trump card, yet it was so weak before her!

Even An Nanjing clenched her fists slowly.

She’d suffer a blow to her confidence too!

Both Yang Ye and her felt that if they joined forces, then they could fight anyone in this world.

Yet now, the cruel truth before them was telling them that they were too weak!

Regardless of whether it was Yang Ye or An Nanjing, it was the first time they felt that they were so weak!

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Is this your Sword Domain?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She asked, “Do you know what the Sword Domain is?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t!”

She gazed at him for a long time and sighed softly, “Both of you can’t be blamed for this. While I possessed extraordinary natural talent once, I had the guidance of the experts in my race. I was able to avoid many wrong paths, but both of you have taken many of them.”

Even Yang Ye felt quite aggrieved when he heard this.

Who had ever taught him all along the way? Even if some had, they weren’t true experts. Yet when he finally met his father who was a supreme expert, his father just allowed him to grow on his own!

Truly on his own!

Besides helping him deal with those experts he couldn’t deal with at all, his father made him deal with everything else!

That was his father’s attitude toward him!

Actually, there were advantages and disadvantages for that. The advantage was Yang Ye’s mentality and character would be extraordinary, and no difficulty could take him down. Because he’d experienced too many situations like that. But the disadvantage was that he’d taken many wrong paths, and everything, including his Sword Dao, were things he had to explore and discover himself.

However, in overall, the benefits outweighed the disadvantages!

How could a raised tiger be compared to one that grew up in the wild?

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu said, “The Domain is actually like transforming an area into a cage.”

Yang Ye listened quietly. He knew that this may be a chance for him to change the sad fate he had in the past.

An Nanjing listened carefully too.

Tian Xiu raised her hands, “This world is a universe. Let me give you an example, the Universe was created by “Destiny”. Since it could create the universe, why can’t we? So, many people started to try and study that. In the end, the Domain was formed. However, many Domains only looked like it yet weren’t very useful.”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Like my Sword Domain?”

Tian Xiu nodded, “Your Sword Domain is really useless. A true Domain is a small universe, and its creator of the Domain stands above that universe. As for why your Domain is so useless, the real reason is that your Domain isn’t independent of our universe. It’s still within our universe. So, it’s a fake Domain. When someone’s strength is sufficient to shake this universe, your Domain would be of no threat to them. They can even shake the real universe, let alone your fake Domain, right?”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Then what should I do?”

Tian Xiu fell silent for a long time and said, “A true Domain is something I’ve never seen either. As for myself, I’ve never researched it. As far as I’m concerned, I can destroy quite a bit of this real universe. Of course, it doesn’t represent that Domains are weak. A true Domain is a universe of its own, and it possesses absolute strength. It’s like if the “Destiny” in our example really exists, do you think that you have a chance when fighting it in the universe it created?”

Yang Ye spoke bitterly, “So, my Sword Domain is absolutely useless?”

“Not at all!” She replied softly, “Actually, it’s the way you used it that’s the problem. Since that’s the case, you can use a different method.”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “How?”

She replied, “Release it again!”

Yang Ye nodded and released the Sword Domain. In an instant, a wave of invisible energy appeared here.

Everything in a huge area was within it.

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu said, “Shrink it!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Huh?”

She said, “Shrink its radius.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and started. It didn’t take long for it to only cover an area of around 30km.

Tian Xiu spoke emotionlessly, “Continue!”

Yang Ye had no choice but to continue.

In the beginning, it went very smoothly, but as it grew smaller, Yang Ye noticed that it started to become strenuous. This strain wasn’t limited to his body, and it included his spirit and soul.

Tian Xiu spoke once more, “Continue!”

Yang Ye nodded and continued.

Just like that, around ten more minutes passed, and Yang Ye’s Sword Domain had grown even smaller. However, huge beads of sweat had started to appear on his forehead.

It had been slightly strenuous earlier, but now it was very strenuous.

Tian Xiu said, “Continue!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he continued. Just like that, another 15 minutes passed. Now, it only covered an area of 3km, and Yang Ye’s countenance had turned extremely pale.

Tian Xiu’s voice became slightly louder, “It’s not enough! Continue!”

Huff!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and continued. His face gradually turned from white to red. At the same time, his body started to tighten as if it was being pulled apart by something.

His Sword Domain only covered an area of 300m now.

Yang Ye gazed at Tian Xiu, “Is it enough now?”

“Continue!” She glanced coldly at him, “Don’t stop until I tell you!”

Yang Ye said bitterly, “I feel like I’m at my limit.”

She replied indifferently, “Don’t worry. Even if your body collapses and your soul disperses. I can use the Primordial Pagoda to save you!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

In the end, he continued under her cold gaze.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to shrink it down to just around 30m.

A Sword Domain that only covered 30m!

At this moment, An Nanjing frowned. Because she noticed that the space around her was slightly different now. She couldn’t put a finger on the exact difference, and it was just a very strange feeling!

Tian Xiu looked Yang Ye in the eyes and spoke in an icy cold voice, “Continue!”

Yang Ye said bitterly, “Tian Xiu, I-I’m at my limit.” At this moment, he’d even bit open his lips, and his mind was completely dizzy. He was at the limits of his mind’s endurance.

Tian Xiu turned around, “If that’s the case, then get someone else to teach you how to develop your Sword Domain!”

Tian Xiu started to walk away once she finished speaking.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Fine, I’ll continue!”

He howled with fury and continued. At this moment, Yang Ye’s entire face was warped.

Pain!

Yang Ye had never imagined that shrinking the Sword Domain would be so painful. It was pain that made him recall the first time Elder Mo used fire to temper him. At that time, he’d experienced such unbearable pain as well!

It was pain that made him feel like dying!

Tian Xiu gazed indifferently at him.

Just like that, Yang Ye’s Sword Domain continued to shrink. Now, it covered an area of around 3m!

Just around 3m!

An Nanjing was outside the Sword Domain now, and her brows were pressed tightly together. She sensed that there was a clear difference between the space they were in, and it felt like they were in two different worlds!

“Continue!” Tian Xiu gazed at Yang Ye without any emotion in her eyes.

Yang Ye gritted his teeth and continued.

At this moment, his body started to crack open, and blood was surging out incessantly from him.

Suddenly, Snowy appeared in front of Yang Ye, and then she immediately started crying when she saw him. She gazed at Tian Xiu, and the icy coldness in Tian Xiu’s eyes instantly vanished. She took Snowy in her arms and spoke softly, “Which expert in this world hasn’t suffered to get to the peak? If he can’t even endure this suffering, then he will have no future.”

Snowy didn’t understand all of that, of course! All she knew was that Yang Ye was in great pain. She wanted to fly over to Yang Ye, but Tian Xiu stopped her. Tian Xiu wiped off Snowy’s tears, “Don’t worry little fellow. I won’t harm him!”

She looked up at Yang Ye while she spoke.

At this moment, Yang Ye’s Sword Domain had been shrunk to the limit. It was merely below his feet now. Or to be more precise, it only covered the space around Yang Ye. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu walked over to Yang Ye and tapped his chest.

Bang!

A strand of energy rippled out from Yang Ye’s chest. In an instant, Tian Xiu and Snowy were pushed backward repeatedly. After being pushed around 30m back, Tian Xiu tapped her right foot against the ground and waved her right hand. The energy before her instantly vanished.

An Nanjing was stunned.

Tian Xiu gazed at Yang Ye and spoke softly, “This should be it.”

An Nanjing walked over to Tian Xiu and asked, “What do you mean?”

She gazed at Yang Ye. At this moment, Yang Ye’s eyes were closed tight, and his fists were clenched tight too. His body had cracked open, and blood was flowing incessantly from him.

Tian Xiu gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and there was interest in her eyes, “Perhaps this isn’t a true Domain, but this path is the right one. If he continues on this path, he’ll definitely be able to create his own Domain.”

An Nanjing was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes.

Bang!

In an instant, the endless underground martial grounds were instantly obliterated.

It had turned pitch black!

However, the space around Yang Ye still existed, and it was the only area where space was still intact.
