Chapter 1364 – Freedom Or Your Life?

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot. The green robed man’s expression changed drastically and was about to react. However, a sword pressed against his forehead, causing him to feel horrified. A moment later, the scene before his eyes flashed as he vanished on the spot.

After Yang Ye and the green robed man vanished, 3 old men appeared where they’d been standing.

An old man in luxurious robes glanced at the surroundings. It didn’t take long for his face to turn gloomy, “His aura is gone!”

A black robed old man by his side spoke fiercely, “Than damnable fellow, Yan San. He actually dared to steal from us!”

The old man in a luxurious robe glanced at the surroundings and said, “Go back to Azure Cloud Merchant Group and get their help!”

The black robed old man spoke hesitantly, “But the price to make them help is....”

The old man in luxurious robes glanced at him and said, “We have to, no matter how great the price is!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man in luxurious robes vanished on the spot.

The other 2 old men hurriedly followed after him.

A short while later, Yang Ye and the green robed man appeared on the spot.

The green robed man stared fixedly at Yang Ye and said, “The Laws of Space!”

Yang Ye stretched out his hand, “Will you hand your spatial ring over, or should I get it myself?”

The green robed man’s eyelids twitched. He pondered deeply for a short while, and then he flicked his spatial ring over to Yang Ye. He had a very unsightly expression on his face as he gazed at the spatial ring before Yang Ye. He’d just intended to use Yang Ye to stop those fellows who were pursuing him, but he hadn’t imagined that this Emperor who stood before him would be even more terrifying!

What was it like to court death?

This was it!

Yang Ye glanced at its contents. There were around 1,000 divine crystals and a pile of other miscellaneous items within it. However, they weren’t valuable.

Yang Ye looked up at the green robed man and said, “I’ll give you one last chance.” One of the 3 old men who were pursuing the green robed man had been a true Voider, and the other 2 were Voiders as well. 3 experts had been pursuing the green robed man, so he’d definitely stolen something valuable. But the spatial ring only had trash in it!

The man’s expression remained unchanged when he heard Yang Ye, “What do you mean?”

Hiss!

A ray of light flashed past his shoulder, and then his entire arm flew into the air.

The man almost let out a shrill cry, but he forcefully restrained himself. The man felt horrified as he gazed at Yang Ye, and there was a trace of fear in his eyes.

Yang Ye gazed at the man and said, “I was just joking with you earlier. Now, I’ll give you one final chance. This time, it isn’t a joke.”

Yang Ye would naturally not hold back against the man. After all, the man had intended to get him killed. Just think about it, what would have happened to him if he wasn’t strong?

There was slight hesitation in the man’s eyes. Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and a wisp of killing intent flashed through his eyes.

The man noticed this and felt horrified, “I... I’ll give it to you!”

As he spoke, a ray of light surged out from his chest, and then an object appeared before Yang Ye.

It was a small box. Yang Ye opened it, and there were 4 multicolored flags within it. Yang Ye frowned and looked at the man, “What are these?”

The man spoke solemnly, “Dimensional Teleportation Flags!”

Yang Ye said, “Tell me about them in detail!”

The man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “It’s a simplified teleportation formation. See those flags. So long as you place one of them at a certain point, you can use another flag to teleport to the position of the 1st flag. However, the flags will vanish once used. So, only 2 teleportations can be completed with these 4 flags.”

Yang Ye asked, “How far can they teleport?”

The man replied, “Very far!”

Yang Ye frowned and asked, “How far is very far?”

The man answered, “There are a few thousand worlds in this universe of ours. Besides the large world, these flags can teleport you to any other world. Of course, the precondition is that you’ve placed a flag on the world you intend to teleport to.”

Yang Ye was visibly moved. He gazed at the flags in his hand. These things are really quite amazing!

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something at this moment, and he asked, “How many can it teleport at a time?”

The man replied, “10,000!”

10,000! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. These are for war!

Yang Ye asked, “How did you get them?”

The man hesitated for a moment before he answered, “I stole them.”

“You stole them?” Yang Ye was stunned. He sized up the man. The man was at the peak of the Emperor Realm and not a Voider yet, but he’d dared to steal from a true Voider and had even succeeded!

Yang Ye said, “Your speed isn’t bad, but your strength....”

Yang Ye’s expression suddenly changed when he spoke up to this point. Because the man’s remaining hand was in front of him, and there was a spatial ring on it. That spatial ring was the exact same one that the man had just given to him!

The green robed man had actually stolen the spatial ring from him without him noticing anything!

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “How did you do that?”

The man glanced at the spatial ring and replied, “I’m a smith and formation master. I forged this spatial ring. There’s a mini formation hidden within it. I just have to give a command while I’m within 5,000km of it, and it’ll immediately come to me.”

Yang Ye asked, “Does such a formation exist in other spatial rings as well?”

The man shook his head, “Of course not. The reason I was able to steal those flags was because the spatial ring used to hold them had been forged by me.”

Yang Ye asked, “How did you accomplish that?”

The man remained silent.

Yang Ye said, “My patience is growing thin.”

The man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “It was the auction house that arranged it.”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed, “They worked together with you?”

The man shook his head, “No, they wanted to do it themselves. So, they got a spatial ring from me.”

Yang Ye asked, “But you reaped the rewards in the end, right?”

The green robed man nodded.

Yang Ye said, “Why are you being so honest with me?” The man wasn’t just being completely honest, he even took the initiative to tell Yang Ye things. So, it puzzled Yang Ye a little.

The man gazed at Yang Ye and said, “You wanted to kill me just now, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “But I’ve changed my mind now.”

The man said, “You wouldn’t have changed your mind if I didn’t do that, right?”

Yang Ye replied, “That’s true!”

The man said, “I merely stole those Dimensional Teleportation Flags because I wanted to figure out their structure and study how they are made....”

Yang Ye interrupted the man and said, “You almost got me killed just now!”

The green robed man fell silent for a short while, and then he asked, “What do you want?”

A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “It’s very simple. The power I lead lacks a formation master and smith. I think you’re very suitable.”

The man spoke in a low voice, “I don’t want to be bound!”

Yang Ye replied, “Freedom or your life. Choose!”

The man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he replied, “My life!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I don’t need your services forever. Just work for me for 5 years. You can leave at any time once those 5 years are up.”

The man asked, “Really?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Of course!” he was very well aware that if he forced the green robed man to serve him forever, then it would definitely cause the green robed man to feel resentful. But if he only asked for 5 years, it would be much easier for the man to accept. After all, 5 years weren’t long for cultivators.

The man replied, “Alright, I’ll serve you for 5 years.”

Yang Ye smiled and flicked the box back to the green robed man, “Take it and study it. It’s best if you can make some. I need them!”

The man gazed at Yang Ye and asked, “Do you know how expensive they are?”

Yang Ye asked, “How expensive are they?”

The man replied, “10,000 divine crystals!

10,000 divine crystals! Yang Ye’s lips twitched. After all, 10,000 divine crystals were equivalent to a million violet crystals!

Suddenly, the green robed man said, “10,000 divine crystals per flag, and they are practically impossible to find on the market!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

The man continued, “They are not expensive. After all, they can be used for large scale teleportation, and they can be used to escape at a critical moment. Moreover, if there’s a war between stellar regions, then it would be even more effective. Just think about it. An army suddenly appears within your home....”

When he heard this, Yang Ye realized that these flags were extraordinary indeed. So, he gazed at the man and asked, “Are you confident in your ability to forge them?”

The Sword Alliance had to expand. If it had these flags, then it would definitely be much more convenient in many aspects. Moreover, he could return to Dark Hell Continent at any time and wouldn’t have to teleport via Stellar City!

However, it was truly too expensive. It cost 2 million violet crystals just to be used once!

The man shook his head and replied, “Even though I haven’t studied them, I’m sure that it’s impossible for me to forge on my own. It’s extremely complicated, and there are definitely no less than 10,000 steps to forge it. However, while I’m not confident in my ability to forge them on my own, I can give it a try if I do it with a few friends!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Tell me if you need anything! Now, let’s head back!”

The green robed man hesitated for a moment, and then he closed his eyes. It didn’t take long for 2 strands of his soul to float over to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at the man for a long time, and then he flicked the strands of soul back to the green robed man.

The man was puzzled, “Why?”

Yang Ye explained, “I would have definitely killed you on the spot if you weren’t sensible enough to hand them over on your own. Because it would make me feel like you aren’t sincere. But you were very sensible. You’re a smart person, so I think it isn’t necessary.”

The man replied, “Thank you!”

“Let’s go!” Yang Ye’s figure vanished on the spot. He glanced at Yang Ye’s figure in the distance and followed Yang Ye. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Yang Ye brought the green robed man to Divine Sky Pavilion, and then he started cultivating after he returned to his room.

Around 15 minutes later, Ye Liuyun suddenly entered his room and said, “That Miss Tingyu from Azure Cloud Merchant Group is here to see you. She’s outside. Something is off, so be careful.”

Azure Cloud Merchant Group? Yang Ye frowned, and then he left the room with Ye Liuyun and arrived outside the pavilion. Tingyu wasn’t too far away, and there were 3 old men by her side.

A smile appeared on Tingyu’s face when she saw him, “Young Master Yang, I hope you’re doing well!”

Yang Ye said, “Miss Tingyu, do you need something?”

Tingyu smiled and said, “Young Master Yang, these 3 friends of mine from Skyriver Stellar Region lost something. According to our investigation, it should be in your possession. I....”

“Skyriver Stellar Region!” Yang Ye suddenly interrupted her, and then he gazed at the old man, “You’re from the Alliance of Guardians?”

The old man in luxurious robes frowned, and he said, “How did you know that?!”
