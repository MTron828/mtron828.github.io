Chapter 2020 – From the Dead Dimension!

Sword energy!

Yang Ye sensed sword energy. It was a strand of sword energy. He hadn’t sensed it earlier because it was too far, yet now, he could clearly sense its aura.

Whose sword energy is it?

Yang Ye didn’t have the time to think because the white light had arrived above them.

At this moment, Yang Ye believed Mo Xiao. It really could kill Zen Realm experts!

Danger!

It was extremely dangerous!

“Fight it together!” Suddenly, Mo Xiao’s voice resounded, and he shot up into the sky and slammed his fist forward. A huge fist that was over 100m wide rose up and slammed against the white light.

However, it was instantly obliterated upon coming into contact with the white light. Meanwhile, the others attack as well. But the white light instantly descended, and Mo Xiao, who led the charge, was instantly obliterated before he could even react!

He was dead!

He'd been killed in an instant!

Liao Fan and the others’ expressions changed drastically, and one of them hurriedly said, “We can’t fight it! Let’s go!”

He immediately shot off into the distance.

The others fled as well.

Yang Ye was naturally not an exception. He didn’t want to fight it on his own because it was no ordinary sword energy. Even he wasn’t completely confident in his ability to deal with it, so he started to flee when the others fled.

However, the sword energy insisted on chasing after him!

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched at the sight of this, and he couldn’t help but curse, “What the hell! Did I wrong you?”

He sped up, but it was even faster.

Liao Fan and the others naturally noticed this, and Su Xiu asked, “Should we help?”

Liao Fan shook his head slightly, “This is an opportunity for us. Let’s head up there!”

He immediately shot up the mountain.

A'Xiu and Su Xiu exchanged glances, and then A’Xiu said, “I’m going to help him!”

Su Xiu gazed at her with astonishment.

A’Xiu said, “We agreed to become temporary allies, so we naturally should face everything together. If I leave now, I’ll be breaking my promise, and that doesn’t sit well with me!”

A ray of light flashed, and she vanished on the spot.

Su Xiu shook his head, “How pedantic!”

He shot up the mountain once he finished speaking.

…

On the other side, Yang Ye was growing faster and faster, but that ray of sword energy refused to stop pursuing him. In the end, Yang Ye stopped, and the sword energy suddenly stopped in front of him.

Yang Ye glanced at the sword energy, “What do you want?”

The reason he’d stopped was that he hadn’t sensed any intent to kill. It seemed to hold no ill intent towards him!

The white light trembled slightly, and then it floated over to Yang Ye and started trembling again. It seemed to be telling him something.

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he placed his hand on it. It dispersed to reveal a finger-long strand of sword energy.

The sword energy was white like a strand of white flame.

Yang Ye sized it up and said, “You want to go with me?”

It shook slightly.

Yang Ye finally came to an understanding at this point.

Sword energy!

No matter how powerful a person’s sword energy was, so long as it left the person’s body, it would be without an owner and without a source of energy. Once it encountered external forces, it was very likely for it to vanish forever from the world. So, this strand of sword energy clearly wanted to go with him and gain a place to stay.

As for why it came to him, it was very simple. It was because he was a sword cultivator.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and then he grabbed it. As soon as he did that, it entered his body.

Yang Ye immersed his mind into the Primordial Pagoda. Once the sword energy entered the pagoda, it immediately shot into the Unfettered One’s sword while Yang Ye watched with astonishment.

The sword shook violently, and then a deafening sword howl resounded!

Yang Ye waved his hand, and the sword appeared in his grasp. Yang Ye fell silent as he gazed at it.

A long time passed before he left the Primordial Pagoda.

After that, he glanced at the surroundings and planned to leave. But he suddenly looked towards the side, “Show yourself!”

The space there shook slightly, and a woman walked out from it.

It was A’Xiu!

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “It’s you?” Obviously, he hadn’t expected her to come.

She glanced at him, “I saw everything!”

Yang Ye asked, “And?”

She replied, “Who are you?”

Yang Ye smiled, “We merely met by chance. There’s no need to get an answer to that question, right?”

She nodded slightly, “True.” She looked up at the mountain, “They’ve headed up there.”

Yang Ye glanced at the top and said, “Then let’s go too!”

A’Xiu glanced at Yang Ye. While she had questions in her heart, she didn’t ask them in the end. Just as Yang Ye had said, they’d merely met by chance, and it was insensible to pursue an answer.

Right when they were about to arrive at the top of the mountain, the sound of air being torn apart resounded by the ears. An instant later, a few rays of cold light arrived before them. They were blades that were thin as the wings of a cicada.

They were shooting straight for Yang Ye and A’Xiu’s vital points!

Even though they were extremely quick, such speed was quite slow to Yang Ye. He didn’t dodge them and just swung a punch, and those blades were instantly blasted into bits.

Yang Ye turned to look at A’Xiu, and he noticed that the blades around her had vanished too. There was a sword in her grasp, and it was flickering with sword energy.

Their eyes met, and then they looked towards the distance. A few figures were shooting away there.

Obviously, after they’d witnessed Yang Ye and A’Xiu’s strength, they’d decisively given up on killing and robbing Yang Ye and A’Xiu.

A’Xiu asked, “Shall we go after them?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Let’s not waste time.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he looked at the top of the mountain which was just a short distance away and flashed over. A’Xiu followed closely behind him.

Once they arrived at the top, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he looked ahead. He couldn’t see the end of the mountain.

Meanwhile, A’Xiu pointed ahead, “The Oceanic Dimension is over there, and the Sage Ruins is at the border of the Oceanic Dimension and Devil Dimension.”

“Let’s go!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye tapped his right foot down and appeared over 10 km away.

A’Xiu’s eyelids twitched at the sight of this, “Such physical strength!” She immediately followed after him.

Two hours later, they stopped.

There was a small hill not too far away from them, and around 30 people were gathered at the foot of it!

Su Xiu and Liao Fan were among them.

Liao Fan and Su Xiu were slightly stunned when they saw Yang Ye and A’Xiu, but it didn’t take long for Liao Fan to walk over and smile, “Brother Ye, A’Xiu, it’s good to know that you’re fine.”

Yang Ye smiled and glanced at the crowd, “Brother Liao Fan, what’s going on over there?”

Yang Ye’s attitude was very nice, and there was nothing off about it.

Liao Fan glanced at Yang Ye and smiled, “Brother Ye, you won’t blame me and Brother Su Xiu for leaving, right?”

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “Why would I?” He added, “Brother Liao Fan, has someone obtained the Sage’s inheritance?”

“No!” Liao Fan shook his head and pointed at the small hill, “The Sage Ruins is over there, but we can’t get in. We aren’t the only ones, everyone else has stopped here. No one is able to go up there!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Liao Fan replied, “It’s being protected!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He looked up and glanced at the hill, but he saw nothing.

Liao Fan smiled, “You’ll see it later.” After that, his expression became solemn, “It’s more terrifying than the white light from before!”

“Liao Fan!” Meanwhile, a voice came from afar. Liao Fan looked over, and he saw a young man in a violet robe walking slowly in his direction.

“Brother Lin Tian!” Liao Fan went over and smiled, “May I know what you need?”

Lin Tian glanced at Yang Ye and A’Xiu, “Who are they?”

Liao Fan smiled, “They are friends I met on the way, Ye Yang and A’Xiu.” He gazed at Yang Ye and A’Xiu, and he introduced Lin Tian, “This is Brother Lin Tian, he’s one of the two Emperors of our human race.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

One of the two Emperors!

Yang Ye couldn’t help but take another glance at Lin Tian. He’s equally famous to that fellow, Qin Chuan?

Lin Tian nodded to Yang Ye and A’Xiu, and then he said, “We’ve decided to join forces against that fellow.”

Suddenly, Liao Fan asked, “What about after that?”

“After that?” Lin Tian chuckled, “Brother Liao Fan, that question is quite na?ve. Once it’s dealt with, we’ll naturally fight for the inheritance. The strong get the inheritance. In any case, we’ll rely on our own ability to get it.”

Liao Fan nodded and didn’t say another word.

Lin Tian smiled, “Come, let me introduce you to two extraordinary geniuses from the devil race.”

Lin Tian led Yang Ye and the others to the foot of the hill, and then he pointed at a man who was seated cross-legged there. The man had his back to them.

Lin Tian smiled, “Guess who he is! Let me give you a hint. He came from the Dead Dimension!”

The Dead Dimension? Yang Ye looked ahead along the direction Lin Tian was waiting…
