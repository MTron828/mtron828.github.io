Chapter 1350 – I’ll Repay You Today!

The Yang Clan?

Yang Ye felt nothing towards that name. As for acknowledging his ancestry, he’d never thought of that. He was living fine and well now, so why return to the Yang Clan? For others to look down on him? He wasn’t an idiot. As for the power and authority he would gain, it had nothing to do with him as well. Because no matter how great it was, it was something the Yang Clan gave, and if the Yang Clan didn’t like him one day, then they could take back all of it at will.

Only his own strength was the most reliable and the best choice!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and sped up towards Sword God Island.

As he grew closer to it, the pressure grew stronger. In the end, Yang Ye had no choice but to utilize Rebirth Rank sword intent to resist it, and it made his expression grow even more serious.

A long time passed before Yang Ye arrived at Sword God Ocean, and he immediately headed for Blind Maiden’s wooden house. At this moment, it had been transformed into bits of wood.

Yang Ye’s face fell at the sight of this, and then he glanced at the surroundings. Yang Ye remained silent for a short while before he looked up at the sky. He didn’t hesitate to shoot up into the sky.

As he went higher, the pressure he experienced grew heavier, and it even came to the point that his Rebirth Rank sword intent could only barely resist it!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive high above in the sky, and he saw Blind Maiden. Besides her, he saw... a dragon!

A black dragon!

A huge black dragon was above her. Only its head could be seen, and its body was hidden within the black layer of clouds in the sky. Even then, just the head it revealed shocked Yang Ye. How huge was it? It was indescribable. Or to put it in simpler terms, just a single whisker on its head was larger than him!

Blind Maiden was tiny like an ant before the black dragon. Needless to say, it was quite an amusing scene.

Blind Maiden looked up at the black dragon and said, “You’re finally willing to show yourself after hiding for so long?”

“Woman!” The black dragon glared angrily at Blind Maiden, “You trapped me for thousands of years, and I’ll repay you a hundredfold for that humiliation!”

As soon as it finished speaking, the black dragon’s head dived down in Blind Maiden’s direction.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly while a trace of worry appeared in them. Even though Blind Maiden was extremely strong, the strength that the black dragon revealed was extremely terrifying as well. So, could she resist it? Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Blind Maiden’s expression remained unchanged as she slowly stretched her right hand forward, and then pushed it lightly in the black dragon’s direction. An invisible wave of force surged out from her palm. In an instant, the space before her rippled like a pool that had been struck by water, and the ripples overlapped with each other as they surged towards the black dragon. It didn’t take long for the ripples to collide with the black dragon.

Bang!

The entire expanse of space there shook violently while a rumbling explosion that sounded like a thunderclap resounded in Yang Ye’s ears, causing sharp pain to come from his eardrums. Yang Ye was shocked, and he hurriedly utilized his sword intent to protect himself.

Roar!

Suddenly, the black dragon’s furious roar resounded. Yang Ye looked up and saw that the black dragon had returned to where it was just a moment ago, and the scales on its head had even cracked open.

Blind Maiden clenched her fist slowly. A terrifying aura swept out from her, and even space trembled violently before it.

Yang Ye was shocked and hurriedly moved far away. He had an extremely solemn expression on his face as he gazed at the black dragon and blind maiden. Their strength had absolutely surpassed the Semi-Deity Realm, and it could be said that Nie Wuming who’d attained the Semi-Deity Realm wasn’t on the same level as them at all!

The black dragon stared fixedly at Blind Maiden. Besides viciousness, there was seriousness in its eyes as well. It remained silent for an instant before its figure suddenly shook, and a dragon claw emerged from the black clouds in the sky. The claw was huge like a mountain, and it slammed down towards Blind Maiden.

Blind Maiden seemed extremely tiny before the huge dragon claw. If one didn’t look carefully, it would be utterly impossible to notice her. Because the black dragon’s claw was truly too huge.

However, she had an extremely calm expression on her face when facing that enormous black dragon.

When it arrived around 300m away from the top of her head, Blind Maiden stretched out her hand again, and her palm was facing upwards. In an instant, the space before her palm started to warp strangely, and then a translucent white hand made out of energy flashed out from there.

The hand shot straight up into the air and slammed against the huge dragon claw.

Yang Ye frowned because the energy hand was quite strange. Space seemed to undergo a change wherever it passed, and it was slightly similar to Nie Wuming’s attack from before, but it was slightly different at the same time. But he couldn’t put a finger on exactly what the difference was.

Meanwhile, the white energy hand slammed against the huge dragon claw.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the sky shook violently as if it would collapse at any moment. As for the huge dragon claw, it had shrunk back into the black clouds. But the energy hand hadn’t vanished, and it shot up into the clouds without slowing down at all.

Bang!

Another loud explosion resounded in the clouds, and then the black dragon’s figure trembled violently. Yang Ye noticed that there was a trace of pain in the black dragon’s enormous eyes. However, it only took an instant for that pain to be transformed into ferocity. After that, a huge dragon tail emerged from the clouds.

Yang Ye’s expression changed when he saw the dragon tail. It was covered in ink black scales, and even space warped before it. At the same time, a wave of terrifying pressure and aura assaulted his face, causing him to feel suffocated. He hurriedly moved around 3km back while Rebirth Rank sword intent surged out madly!

Meanwhile, Blind Maiden frowned slightly when the dragon tail appeared. At the same time, the black dragon suddenly roared with fury, and the tail swept down towards Blind Maiden.

Bang!

Everywhere it passed, space collapsed inch by inch, and a huge black hole appeared in the sky.

Blind Maiden frowned slightly at the sight of this. She twisted her right hand slightly and tapped her finger towards the tip of the tail. A beam of energy surged out from her finger, and it instantly collided against the black dragon’s tail.

Bang!

The beam of energy shattered while the dragon’s tail trembled intensely, and even the scales on it had cracked apart, causing blood to seep out from between the cracks and rain down to the ground. However, the tail didn’t stop and swept towards Blind Maiden without even slowing down.

Meanwhile, a ray of light suddenly surged out from Blind Maiden’s body. After that, she transformed into a ray of light that shot up towards the black dragon.

Bang!

Roar!

An explosion and a howl of pain resounded high above in the sky. Yang Ye watched as the black dragon’s tail seemed as if it had been electrocuted and instantly shrunk back into the black clouds. As for Blind Maiden, she was falling towards the ground.

Yang Ye’s expression changed at the sight of this, and he was about to lend her a hand. However, the ray of falling light suddenly stopped, and it didn’t take long for it to disperse and reveal Nether Maiden’s figure.

At this moment, besides a slightly pale countenance, there was nothing wrong with her at all!

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief in his heart, and he got ready to lend her a hand. He hadn’t done anything just now because he didn’t know the black dragon’s strength. So, attacking rashly may not even help Blind Maiden, and it would cause trouble for her instead. Now that he’d gained a certain level of understanding towards the black dragon’s strength, he knew that while the black dragon was formidable, he could still fight it with the assistance of the Sword Spirit.

Right when Yang Ye was about to attack, Blind Maiden’s voice suddenly arose in his mind, “This is my own business. I’ll deal with it myself.”

As soon as she finished speaking, her figure suddenly shot up into the air. After that, countless rays of light appeared here. These rays of light transformed into pillars of light that shot towards the black dragon in the sky.

Roar!

The black dragon’s furious howls resounded from within the clouds, and then the clouds started to tremble. It didn’t take long for the clouds to be obliterated, and then the black dragon dived down towards Blind Maiden.

Yang Ye couldn’t help but break out in cold sweat for Blind Maiden when he saw the black dragon’s entire body. It was too huge! He knew no words that could describe how enormous it was!

How old is that fellow?

Meanwhile, explosions resounded incessantly in the distance. Countless beams of light were being shattered, and even space was being shattered into pieces. Blind Maiden and the black dragon were fighting within a black hole. Ordinary cultivators would be utterly incapable of remaining in a black hole for too long because it possessed a devouring force that ordinary experts found difficult to resist. But Blind Maiden and the black dragon were no ordinary experts!

Because their battle was too intense, Yang Ye couldn’t help but retreat over and over again. At this moment, he’d moved around 30km back!

Yang Ye stared fixedly into the distance. The ancient sheath was in his left grasp, and the Sword Precursor was sheathed within it. At the same time, his profound energy was circulating madly. He was accumulating strength and waiting to attack!

So long as Blind Maiden was in danger, he would act immediately!

Even though that would offend the black dragon, he would still do it even if there were 10 black dragons there. Blind Maiden wasn’t just Nether Maiden’s third sister, he owed her as well. It could be said that if she hadn’t helped him during those 2 prior incidents, he would probably be dead right now. So, how could he stand by idly if she was in danger?

Yang Ye stared fixedly at the distant battle while the ancient sheath trembled violently in his grasp.

Suddenly, something unexpected occurred. A huge finger suddenly emerged from below, and it was extremely swift to the point that Yang Ye hadn’t even been able to react before it slammed against the flowing ray of light that Blind Maiden had transformed into.

Bang!

The ray of light was instantly obliterated, and then Blind Maiden was blasted far away. It didn’t take long for her to stop herself, and a wisp of scarlet red could be seen on the corner of her mouth.

Suddenly, a voice slowly resounded here, “It has been thousands of years. Blind Maiden, I destroyed the Sword God’s Palace all those years ago, yet you took advantage of the situation and took the Stellar Sword Diagram in the end. Now, it’s time to hand it over.”
