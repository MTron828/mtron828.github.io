Chapter 2277 – Live Well!

As soon as he finished speaking, the world fell silent.

No negotiation and no threats!

Yang Ye did care about Elder Yuan and the others, but if he chose to negotiate, all of them may die instead.

Because if the Martial Sect wanted him to surrender, then should he surrender or not?

If he surrendered, they would die. These large powers would never keep potential troubles alive, nor would they show any mercy.

If he chose not to surrender, the Martial Sect would use the lives of Elder Yuan’s group to threaten him. At that time, he would be in an absolutely passive position!

He may even be forced to remain under their control!

So, he had to turn the situation around!

If they were going to die, then everyone could die together!

That was the attitude he revealed to the Martial Sect!

Suddenly, a middle aged man appeared before Yang Ye. The man floated in midair with his hands behind his back, and his aura was restrained within him, causing it to be impossible to discern his strength.

The middle aged man sized up Yang Ye and asked, “You’re from the same universe as the Shiyuan Clan?”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “Yes!”

The middle aged man walked over to Yang Ye, “If I’m not wrong, those three treasures should be in your possession, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Yes! Why? Do you want them?”

The middle aged man shook his head, “No!”

“Huh?” Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he felt puzzled.

Meanwhile, the man waved his right hand, and a group of figures appeared before Yang Ye. It was Elder Yuan’s group. At this moment, they were restrained and couldn’t move at all!

But, luckily, they were alright!

Yang Ye glanced at Elder Yuan’s group, and then he gazed at the middle aged man, “What’s the meaning of this?”

The middle aged man replied, “You can leave!”

Yang Ye’s frown deepened. He was about to speak when the middle aged man vanished.

Yang Ye was puzzled by this. Suddenly, Elder Yuan walked over to him, “He plans to use others to kill us!”

Yang Ye gazed at Elder Yuan, and the latter spoke softly, “Let’s leave first!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then they vanished on the spot.

Once they left, the middle aged man appeared here again, and he had indifference on his face as he looked into the direction Yang Ye’s group had left toward.

Meanwhile, an old man appeared before him and bowed, “Sect Master, why?”

The middle aged man spoke softly, “Who doesn’t want those three treasures? But because too many desire them, we can’t take them. They will only bring calamity. However, while we can’t take them, we can reveal his whereabouts to the Divine Martial Sect and Sky Martial Sect. I think they’ll be interested!”

The old man bowed slightly, “How wise of you, Sect Master. But the Vice Sect Master…”

“He deserves death!” The Sect Master of the Martial Sect spoke indifferently, “He didn’t make Yang Ye come to the Martial Sect, and he made Yang Ye come here instead. Obviously, he wanted to kill Yang Ye and take those treasures for himself. Unfortunately, he underestimated Yang Ye’s strength and fearlessness.”

He spoke slightly solemnly at this point, “I underestimated him too!”

The old man asked, “How is he when compared to our Martial Sect’s genius, Wu Xuanming?”

The Sect Master shook his head slightly, “Xuanming is inferior. His mastery of his Domain is something that even True Dao Realm experts can’t compare to, and his slaughter intent is unprecedentedly strong too.”

A smile with deep meaning appeared on his face at this point, “The Divine Martial Sect and Sky Martial Sect will be pleasantly surprised.”

…

Yang Ye took Elder Yuan and the others away from the Martial Sect’s territory, and he stopped on a plains. He turned around and gazed at them, “Are all of you alright?”

Elder Yuan laughed bitterly, “We’re fine. It’s just… we caused trouble for you again!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “There’s no need to say that.”

He gazed at Sky Maiden and the others, “Eldest Sister, what do you plan to do now?”

Sky Maiden fell silent for a while and replied, “We plan to go around this world.”

“Me too!” Meanwhile, Situ Tingyun stepped forward. She had her sword on her back, and she looked very heroic.

Yang Ye gazed at her and said, “You’re not staying with me?”

She shook her head, “I want to seek out my own Sword Dao. If I stay with you, my strength may grow rapidly, but I don’t want to take your path. I want to take my own path.”

Yang Ye revealed a smile of praise, “Very good.”

As he spoke, he flicked a ray of white light into her forehead.

Situ Tingyun gazed at him with bewilderment, and he said, “It’s my understanding of the Sword Domain. I hope it’ll be of use to you in the future.”

Situ Tingyun walked over to Yang Ye, gazed at him for a long time, and then she cracked a smile, “Big Brother… Actually, you’re a good person. I’ll come looking for you once I’ve become accomplished in my Sword Dao! Wait for me!”

She transformed into a ray of light that shot up into the air and vanished from their fields of vision.

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled as he watched her vanish, “This little girl…”

Meanwhile, Sky Maiden and the others walked over to him, “We’re leaving too!”

Yang Ye gazed at them, hesitated for a moment, and spoke softly, “Take care!”

Blood Maiden walked over to Yang Ye, rubbed his head, and spoke softly, “Take care!”

She turned around and left with the others.

Yang Ye was quite dazed as he watched them leave, and no one knew what he was thinking. Quite some time passed before Yang Ye shook his head, restrained his thoughts, and gazed at Yang Lianshuang, “Lianshuang, what about you?”

She hesitated for a moment and said, “I want to return to my hometown!”

“Your hometown?” Yang Ye was slightly stunned and asked, “Is it far away?”

She replied, “Very.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Put it aside for now. If we have the time, I’ll send you there myself. Alright?”

She hesitated for a moment, but Yang Ye suddenly added, “There are many more things that I need you and Elder Yuan to help me with!”

Yang Lianshuang thought for a moment and nodded, “Alright, I’m in no rush anyway.”

Yang Ye nodded and gazed at the group that was standing nearby. They were the families of Qin Chuan and the others, and they were considered as Yang Ye’s family too.

“I’ll take them and go into hiding!” Elder Yuan spoke softly, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye replied, “That’s what I was planning.”

He had thought about putting them in the Primordial Pagoda, but he decided against that in the end. It was more dangerous to stay with him! Because countless powers and experts were targeting him, so they would be dragging down with him if they stayed with him!

That was why he’d allowed Sky Maiden and the others to leave!

As for why they had wanted to leave, there was actually another reason. They didn’t want to be a burden to Yang Ye. They weren’t weak, but Yang Ye was most terrifying when he was all alone!

If he was alone, he had nothing to worry about, so he would definitely be an existence that gave a headache to all the powers in Eternal Border!

Meanwhile, a middle aged man walked over to Yang Ye. It was Qin Chuan’s father.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Uncle!”

Qin Chuan’s father patted Yang Ye on the shoulder, “Don’t feel too bad. You’ve done enough. I’m proud, very proud that Qin Chuan had a brother like you. He was always playing around and had a bunch of useless friends, but he didn’t make a mistake with you, not at all!”

He was crying as he finished speaking.

Yang Ye glanced at the others, and amongst them was Qin Chuan’s father, Yu Jing’s father, and Ling’s father. All of them had tears on their faces right now!

Qin Chuan and the others had been extraordinary geniuses of their respective clans, and it could be said that they were their clans’ hope. However, they had chosen to give their lives away from Yang Ye.

They had really given their lives away!

Because it was a battle where Yang Ye’s side had no chance to win!

However, they still went there!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly bowed to all of them, “You’re all the loved ones of my brothers, so you are my loved ones. So long as I’m alive, I won’t let anything happen to all of you.”

He gazed at Elder Yuan and Yang Lianshuang, “I’ll leave them to you!”

Elder Yuan nodded slightly, “It’s not a problem for us. We are worthless to the powers of Eternal Border, but you… You must be careful!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course!”

Elder Yuan hesitated for a moment and said, “Did something happen to Miss An?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Elder Yuan sighed softly, “Then… Take care!”

He led the others away.

It didn’t take long for only Yang Ye and A’Man to remain here. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Yang Ye asked, “Do you need something?”

She swung a punch at his chest, “Live well!”

She turned around and vanished into the sky.

“Live well!” Yang Ye laughed with self-ridicule, “It isn’t that easy!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a ray of light arose beneath his feet, and then he vanished into the sky.

Around an hour later, Yang Ye suddenly stopped amidst the clouds. Because a middle aged man in luxurious robes had appeared before him. The middle aged man had a sword in his grasp. The sword was upright against the back of his arm, and a cold glow coiled around its tip.

A sword cultivator!

Moreover, it was a sword cultivator at the Progenitor Realm!

The middle aged man sized up Yang Ye and said, “I’m the Southern Guardian of the Divine Martial Sect, Jian Kan. I’m here on the Sect Master’s orders to ask for those three treasures from you.”

The Divine Martial Sect!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “They belong to me.”

“That’s not true!” Jian Kan shook his head slightly, “Treasures have always belonged to the strong. They may be in your possession now, but it doesn’t represent that they belong to you. If you’re willing to hand them over, I will leave and not make things difficult for you.”

Yang Ye replied, “What if I refuse?”

Jian Kan fell silent for an instant and replied, “Then I’ll send you into eternal slumber!”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and Jian Kan’s expression changed drastically. A solemn expression instantly filled his eyes, and his sword vanished abruptly.

Two sharp sword howls resounded, and then the world fell silent.

Yang Ye stood behind Jian Kan and wiped off the blood on his sword, “I’d planned to exchange a few blows with you. Unfortunately, my wife is waiting for me to rescue her. So, I have no choice but to make you die a little sooner.”

Hiss!

As soon as he finished speaking, Jian Kan’s figure split open at the center, and then blood and internal organs sprayed all over.
