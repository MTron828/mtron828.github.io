Chapter 876 – Where’s The Dao Order Going To Put Its Face?

“Be the next sect master of the Dao Order?” Yang Ye was stunned, “I didn’t hear you wrongly, right?”

The old man nodded.

“Are you sure you’re not joking?”

“Do I look like I’m joking?”

“Why?”

“You should understand the reason!”

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time before he said, “Firstly, the entire Dao Order wishes for nothing more than to kill me, so do you think they would let me be their next sect master?”

“It’s naturally impossible if I’m dead!” The old man continued, “However, I’m not dead. While I’m not in this dimension, no one in the Dao Order dares to go against my commands. Do you know why? It isn’t merely because I created the Dao Order, it’s also because the Dao Order would be instantly annihilated if it isn’t for my presence. Understand?”

Yang Ye asked in a low voice, “The other Platinum Rank sects have seniors standing behind them as well, right?”

The old man nodded, “But all of us aren’t in this dimension, and we’re unable to easily interfere with the matters of this dimension! In short, if you agree, then the enmity between you and my Dao Order will be resolved. Moreover, you can use all the resources of the Dao Order.”

Yang Ye said, “I refuse!”

“Why?” The old man’s face turned slightly gloomy, and he said, “Do you know that while you’re a disciple of the Ancient Sword School, it won’t let you be its next Sword Master?”

Yang Ye gazed at the old man and said, “I once said that I wouldn’t betray the sword school if it doesn’t betray me. The sword school hasn’t betrayed me, so how can I betray them?”

Yang Ye said, “You’ll lose a great deal if you make such a choice!”

Yang Ye replied, “So what?”

The old man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he said, “You know, I’ve wanted to kill you for 3 times since you arrived here.”

Yang Ye’s heart shook as he hadn’t expected the old man to really intend to kill him.

The old man continued, “The 1st time was when I first laid eyes on you. Your natural talent and potential could really be described with the word terrifying. But you’re an enemy of my Dao Order. So, I was prepared to eliminate you for the Dao Order and prevent it from being destroyed by you. The reason I didn’t kill you then was because I wanted to see where your limits were.

“The 2nd time was when I asked you what the Dao was. Your words shocked me a little, and it made me feel slightly fearful. Because I could foresee the price that my Dao Order should have to pay if you were allowed to grow.

“The 3rd and last time was when I asked you if you were willing to join my Dao Order. You know... I really hoped that you would agree. Because so long as you agreed, then that mad old woman from the Ancient Sword School would kill you even if I don’t. Unfortunately, you didn’t agree. While I felt it was a pity, it allowed me to rest at ease as well. Because while you go to extremes, you have your own limits and principles which you live by, and that’s something I really admire! So....”

When he spoke up to this point, the old man heaved a light sigh and said, “You don’t have to die, and the Ancient Sword School and Dao Order don’t have to fight to the death.”

Yang Ye said, “But the Dao Order clearly refuses to let me go!”

“Let’s talk about that later!” The old man suddenly stretched out his right hand with his palm facing up. A moment of silence ensued before he slowly clenched his fist. His thumb was pressed against his index finger as he said, “My other inheritance is a technique I created all those years ago. It’s called the Divine Fist of Destruction. It’s a peak Saint Rank technique. With the foundation that your physical body possesses, and if you’re able to cultivate it to its peak, then its strength would definitely surpass Saint Rank techniques and attain the low-grade of the Divine Rank! I’ll execute it once now. Watch it well!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man suddenly smashed his fist towards the sky.

Bang!

Besides where Yang Ye and the old man stood, the space in an area of over 10km was instantly blasted into pieces. Moreover, Yang Ye even sensed that everything in the surroundings including the spirit energy there was being destroyed at an alarming rate!

Space had shattered, the world had split apart, and spirit energy was drying up!

“How strong!” Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and there was a solemn expression in them. Besides the true Heavenrend, all his other sword techniques couldn’t compare to this fist technique. Even the Mortal Sword or 20 overlapped Heavenrends couldn’t compare to it.

The old man withdrew his fist and said, “You must remember a single thing while executing that technique, you have to possess a domineering aura of supremacy. The stronger the aura is, the stronger the might of the punch would be. Perhaps such an aura would be a huge problem for anyone else, but it shouldn’t be a problem for you. Because your aura is domineering enough!”

At this moment, Yang Ye finally understood why the old man said that the technique suited him. Besides the pretty good foundation his physical body had, it was also because he possessed an aura of supremacy!

The old man said, “Where there are people, there is battle. The nobodies fight each other in small conflicts, the great figures fight huge wars, and we cultivators fight battles of life and death. The conflict between you and my Dao Order will end here. The Dao Order hasn’t suffered a loss for many years, so it’s quite arrogant and uses Hell’s Coffin for every small thing. If this continues, then it’ll suffer greatly when it tries to march on the Central Divine Prefecture in the future. They can just take it as a lesson this time!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

When he spoke up to this point, the old man flicked his finger, and a strand of white light shot into the center of Yang Ye’s forehead. It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to sense countless pieces of information surge into his mind.

It was the Nine Rebirth Technique and the Divine Fist of Destruction Technique!

Meanwhile, the old man flicked once more, and a spatial ring appeared before Yang Ye. He said, “This spatial ring is a symbol of status. No matter how bold they are, they won’t dare to act against you while you have this ring in your possession. Alright, my mission is complete, and I should vanish now.” When he spoke up to this point, the old man’s figure gradually faded until he vanished completely.

However, the scene around Yang Ye didn’t vanish once the old man vanished. A figure suddenly appeared not too far away from him, but that figure was completely covered in a layer of white light. So, he wasn’t able to discern the figure’s appearance, and he could merely discern from the figure’s build that it belonged to a woman.

Yang Ye’s heart shook because this illusion had been created by the old man, yet the woman before him had actually been able to enter this world created by the old man. In other words, she was at the same level as the old man.

The mysterious woman spoke abruptly, “Do you know the true reason why he didn’t kill you?”

Yang Ye spoke with embarrassment, “He admires me!”

“What nonsense!” She spoke angrily, “He changed his treatment of you because I fucking arrived here. Otherwise, you would have died a long time ago. Don’t think he looked so kind and amiable, he’s a ruthless and horrifying old geezer!”

Yang Ye asked, “You’re a senior from the Ancient Sword School?”

“You aren’t that stupid!” She grunted coldly, “That old kid, Jian Wuchen, didn’t hesitate to sacrifice his own lifespan to contact me, and he said that I had to send a strand of my spirit down to this world to save you. I didn’t intend to come. After all, I’ve lived for so many years, so what sort of genius have I not seen? However, that fellow, Jian Wuchen, actually dared to threaten me with leading the Ancient Sword School to fight the Dao Order to the death! That made me quite curious about exactly who was able to make such a steady and composed fellow like Jian Wuchen stop at nothing to protect?”

Yang Ye’s heart felt slightly warm when he heard this. Because the Ancient Sword School had never given up on him, and it was even going to fight the Dao Order to the death for him!

“Now you’ve met me.” Yang Ye continued, “So do you feel that you’re lucky to have come or the Ancient Sword School would lose an extraordinary genius?”

“You’re really quite thick-skinned!” The woman continued, “No matter what, you’re not bad, and I didn’t come here for nothing. However, your character is definitely one that will cause a huge amount of trouble. Remember this! You can cause trouble, but choose your opponents well, and don’t offend those fellows who can instantly kill you. Like that old bastard from before. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to save you in time. In short, don’t cause too much trouble!”

Yang Ye asked, “What if someone offends me?”

She replied, “Then fight him! What’re you keeping your sword for?”

Yang Ye asked again, “What if it’s one of those living fossils?”

“Run!”

“What if I can’t escape?”

“Are you looking for a beating?”

Yang Ye was speechless.

The woman stayed silent for a moment before she said, “Actually, I didn’t want you to join my Ancient Sword School when I heard your conversation with that old bastard. Because once you do, you might bring great luck to my Ancient Sword School and even lead it to become a Diamond Rank sect. However, you might bring calamity upon my Ancient Sword School as well. Moreover, it might not just be the sword school, even I might be dragged down by you! So, you can be considered as a double edged blade!”

Yang Ye fell silent because she was absolutely right. Not to mention anything else, he would definitely fight Sky Divine Hall. At that time, it was very likely for it to make the Ancient Sword School become enemies with Sky Divine Hall.

Yang Ye took a deep breath and said, “I can withdraw if you don’t want me to join the sword school. I won’t blame anyone for that!”

“What nonsense!” She suddenly shouted angrily, “Do I look like I’m fucking terrified of trouble?”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. She really has quite an explosive temper.

The woman continued, “It was those words you spoke in the end which changed my mind. You said that you wouldn’t betray the sword school if it doesn’t betray you. Very good! At least you act like a man. I’ll say something to you as well, my sword school won’t betray you if you don’t betray it!”

As soon as she finished speaking, her figure shook slightly, and then she vanished from Yang Ye’s field of vision. At the same time, the surroundings started transforming and returning to normal.

“Yang Ye... passed the 5th test... where is the Dao Order going to put its face now!?” Someone suddenly exclaimed from amidst the spectators.
