Chapter 1133 – A Bloody Battle!

Because it was a surprise attack, Yang Ye’s group entered Thousand Crane Dimension without a hitch, and they passed through the city to arrive at the Thousand Crane Sect.

However, a huge barrier of light enveloped the Thousand Crane Sect when they were about to charge into it.

At the same time, countless experts of the Thousand Crane Sect shot over from all directions, and it didn’t take long for a few tens of thousands to be gathered within the Thousand Crane Sect.

“It’s Yang Ye!” Countless disciples cried out involuntarily when they saw the blood red figure outside the barrier of light.

Yang Ye was naturally not an unfamiliar face to them. After all, Yang Ye had killed their vice sect master and carried out a slaughter in their sect!

The blood scene from that day was absolutely unforgettable to many disciples!

As soon as they saw Yang Ye, their countenances had immediately turned pale. Especially when they saw a huge group standing behind Yang Ye. Moreover, there were over 50 high-rank Saints in that group! However, they were part of a Diamond Rank power at any rate, so it wasn’t to the extent of instilling terror within them.

“Get into formation! Activate all the formations! Notify the Sect Master!” A furious howl resounded through the Thousand Crane Sect, and then its disciples instantly recovered their calm and composure before acting in an orderly manner.

A beautiful middle aged woman flashed into the sky, and she gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Yang Ye, what are you doing here?” At this moment, she naturally had to buy time until Feng Qingyu got back!

“Move aside!” Yang Ye’s voice resounded while the disciples of the Thousand Crane Sect were getting into formation.

Yang Ye paid no attention to the middle aged woman. He just took Heaven’s Gravestone in both hands, stomped his right foot against the space beneath him, and then transformed into a ray of blood red light that collided with the barrier of light.

Bang!

The entire barrier of light shook violently, and rumbling resounded through the sky while countless arm thick cracks appeared on it.

The expressions of the middle aged woman and all the other disciples of the Thousand Crane Sect changed drastically at the sight of this scene.

“Attack!” The middle aged woman hurriedly shouted with fury.

“Attack!” Countless disciples howled furiously from below. In an instant, countless beams of blue light shot up into the air. The beams of blue light instantly formed a huge pillar of blue light in midair, and then it slammed towards Yang Ye who still remained outside the barrier of light.

“Attack!” Qiu Yuan’s voice resounded from outside the barrier of light.

As soon as Qiu Yuan gave the order, the all the students of White Deer Academy attacked in unison. Countless beams of light covered the heavens and the earth as they shot towards the blue pillar of light.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

A string of deafening explosions resounded through the sky.

Qiu Yuan and the others were naturally no match for the joint forces of tens of thousands from the Thousand Crane Sect. So, their attacks merely obstructed the pillar of blue light for a moment. But it was enough for Yang Ye.

“Break!” Yang Ye’s roar of fury resounded through the sky.\

Yang Ye held Heaven’s Gravestone with both hands as he pressed it against the barrier of light and twisted it. The Laws of Decay sprayed out from his sword and coupled with the effects of his full strength, a huge hole was instantly blasted open in the barrier of light. Even though it wasn’t really huge, it was sufficient for Yang Ye’s group!

“Kill!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of blood red light that charged into the Thousand Crane Sect.

The middle aged woman’s pupils constricted. But she reacted quickly and immediately roared with fury, “Get into formation and attack! Activate all the offensive formations and kill them! I....”

Hiss!

A ray of blood red light flashed through the middle aged woman’s throat, and then her head flew up into the air.

“Kill!”

Qiu Yuan and the others followed closely behind Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, countless beams of blue light suddenly surged out from all over the Thousand Crane Sect, and they covered the sky as they shot towards Yang Ye’s group.

“Qiu Yuan, act according to the plan!” As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, he swung Heaven’s Gravestone swiftly, and then countless rays of blood red sword energy shot towards the surroundings. Every single ray of sword energy collided with a beam of blue light, so those beams of blue light weren’t able to cause any harm to Yang Ye and the others.

Meanwhile, Qiu Yuan suddenly gazed at one of the students and said, “Yuan Ming, make it quick!”

“Come with me!” Yuan Ming shot into the Thousand Crane Sect. Over a thousand students followed behind him, and there were Sword Servants around them as well. Any obstruction they encountered would be mercilessly eliminated by those Sword Servants. So, Yuan Ming’s group advanced smoothly, and it didn’t take long for them to vanish into the distance.

At this moment, an intense battle was going on here.

The students of White Deer Academy were outnumbered, and their overall strength was weaker than the forces of the Thousand Crane Sect. However, they had Yang Ye. So, it was the Thousand Crane Sect which was at a disadvantage. Because just Yang Ye alone was capable of resisting all the formations of the Thousand Crane Sect, and he was even ceaselessly slaughtering the high-rank Saints of the Thousand Crane Sect. Under such circumstances, it was practically a slaughter!

The shrill cries of countless disciples from the Thousand Crane Sect were resounding incessantly!

However, none of them fled! More and more disciples were rushing over from all directions, and even many experts within Thousand Crane City had rushed over.

As more and more disciples rushed over, the forces from White Deer Academy gradually lost the advantage they had and were disadvantaged instead.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He pondered deeply for a moment, and then he issued a command in his heart. One of his Sword Servants vanished on the spot, and it didn’t take long for a huge explosion to resound from the back of the Thousand Crane Sect. After that, countless sounds of loud laughter resounded from there.

“Thousand Darkness Prison!” The expressions of some elders from the Thousand Crane Sect had changed drastically. Because they realized that Yang Ye had destroyed the Thousand Darkness Prison. Many enemies of the Thousand Crane Sect were imprisoned there, but most of the prisoners there were actually members of the Thousand Crane Sect itself. They definitely held immense resentment towards the Thousand Crane Sect because it was practically impossible to escape once one was imprisoned there!

Sure enough, it didn’t take long for chaos to arise at the rear of the Thousand Crane Sect.

However, the high-rank Saints of the Thousand Crane Sect paid no attention to those prisoners. Because Yang Ye was much more terrifying than them! After all, even if they started a slaughter, how many could they kill? But if no one kept Yang Ye busy, then Yang Ye could annihilate all the disciples of the Thousand Crane Sect!

At this moment, the Thousand Crane Sect was ready to stop at nothing in order to deal with Yang Ye and the students of White Deer Academy. They were ceaselessly activating all sorts of offensive formations. Every single activation of these formations consumed a huge number of violet crystals. However, they had no choice but to do so right now. Because if they couldn’t keep Yang Ye busy, then the ordinary disciples of the Thousand Crane Sect would be utterly incapable of even resisting a single swing of Yang Ye’s sword.

But even then, it was quite difficult to keep Yang Ye busy.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s voice resounded, “Everyone come close to me!”

The students of White Deer Academy didn’t hesitate to do as they were told. Even though some had tried to stop them, those experts were eliminated by Yang Ye. There was practically no one here who could resist a single swing of Yang Ye’s sword. So, it didn’t take long for the students of White Deer Academy to arrive around Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, they were surrounded by disciples of the Thousand Crane Sect. At this moment, the minds of those disciples were filled with the desire to kill, and they were utterly fearless.

They were part of a Diamond Rank power in the end, so they couldn’t be compared to the members of ordinary powers.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. At this moment, they were practically surrounded, and the disciples and guards of the Thousand Crane Sect were still rushing over incessantly from the city!

We can’t stay any longer!

Yang Ye gazed at Qiu Yuan and said, “Order everyone to get back here! We’re going back to the cloud shuttle!”

Qiu Yuan didn’t dare hesitate and immediately sent a voice transmission to those students who were tasked with plundering the Thousand Crane Sect. In next to no time, those students rushed back here while escorted by Yang Ye’s Sword Servants.

“Don’t let them escape! Stop them! The Sect Master will be here in a few dozen breaths of time, at most!” One of the elders immediately roared upon noticing Yang Ye’s intent to flee.

If they couldn’t kill Yang Ye, then the Thousand Crane Sect would definitely become the laughingstock of the entire Central Divine Prefecture! At that time, every single member of the Thousand Crane Sect wouldn’t be able to hold their heads up high before the members of other Diamond Rank powers!

The disciples of the Thousand Crane Sect immediately pounced at Yang Ye’s group like madmen. The students of White Deer Academy immediately revealed extremely solemn expressions on their faces before the Thousand Crane Sect’s fearless attempt to stop them from escaping.

Suddenly, Yang Ye waved his right hand, and then another 50 Sword Servants at the high-rank of the Saint Realm appeared here.

The faces of the experts from the Thousand Crane Sect changed drastically at the sight of those Sword Servants. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

However, Yang Ye paid no attention to the experts of the Thousand Crane Sect, and he just waved his right hand and commanded, “Stay close and kill our way out with me!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye drew his sword and swung it. A ray of blood red sword energy shot forward, and over 100 disciples of the Thousand Crane Sect who were in his path were instantly slashed into 2!

“Kill!” Yang Ye’s figure shot towards the distance, and the students behind him immediately followed him.

After 50 more high-rank Saints appeared here, the students of the Thousand Crane Sect were powerless to stop Yang Ye’s group, and they could only watch helplessly as Yang Ye’s group vanished into the horizon.

Not even 5 breaths of time had passed after Yang Ye’s group left when Feng Qingyu and Mo Tian appeared in the Thousand Crane Sect.

Feng Qingyu’s face was instantly covered in gloominess when she saw the corpses that covered the Thousand Crane Sect.

“Yang Ye!” Feng Qingyu’s voice was like the roar of a wild beast as it resounded throughout Thousand Crane Dimension.
