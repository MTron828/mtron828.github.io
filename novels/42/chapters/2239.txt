Chapter 2240 – Leave!

The Samadhi Flame!

When facing this expert of the undying race, Master Yuan, Yang Ye knew that the gap in their strength wasn’t just small. So, he’d decisively utilized the Samadhi Flame.

Once he had its assistance, the strength of his attacks rose explosively!

He didn’t use it completely because his current strength couldn’t endure the full strength of the Samadhi Flame. So, he only relied on a small portion of its energy, and just that small portion had taken Master Yuan’s arm with ease.

Master Yuan glanced at the flames around Yang Ye’s sword, “That’s a really powerful flame!”

He took a step forward and was about to attack, but Yang Ye suddenly transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

Master Yuan was slightly stunned and said, “Fleeing?”

He stretched out his right hand and clawed at Yang Ye.

Bang!

A towering palm descended from above Yang Ye.

Yang Ye didn’t even look up and just swung his sword at it.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy shot up, and space was incinerated into nothingness in its wake!

Bang!

The huge palm was instantly obliterated upon coming into contact with the sword energy.

At the same time, space turned quite ethereal there.

Master Yuan frowned slightly. Meanwhile, Dugu Juetian was about to attack, but Master Yuan shook his head, “You can’t stop him.”

He took a step forward and vanished on the spot.

A distant point in space suddenly shook, and then a middle aged man walked out from there. It was Master Yuan. As soon as he arrived there, a ray of fiery red sword energy descended. It was extremely swift and instantly arrived above Master Yuan.

Master Yuan tapped his right foot down lightly.

Hiss!

The area cracked open, and then Master Yuan was over 3km away while Yang Ye’s attack hit nothing but air.

Master Yuan looked up, and a man was standing in the sky. He had a sword in his grasp, and there were faint flames on that sword.

It was Yang Ye.

Master Yuan chuckled, “Yang Ye, you have quite a bit of treasures, huh? First, that sword, then that armor, now this flame. Not a single one is ordinary. Amazing!”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “The undying race has three wise men, where are the other two?”

Master Yuan stated indifferently, “Do we even need three to deal with you?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Looks like you’re very confident.”

Yang Ye swung his sword down.

Hiss!

Sword energy descended like a shooting star, and it tore space open as it shot toward Master Yuan!

Master Yuan’s eyes narrowed slightly as he flipped his palm, and then the space before him suddenly turned pitch black. A moment later, a black pillar of energy surged up and slammed against Yang Ye’s sword energy.

Bang!

As soon as they came into contact, they immediately exploded apart. Meanwhile, Yang Ye arrived above Master Yuan with the Sword Supreme in his grasp, and he slashed down at Master Yuan.

Flames blazed on his sword!

Master Yuan frowned slightly, twisted his right foot slightly against the ground, and vanished on the spot. He was far away when he appeared again.

Hiss!

Yang Ye’s attack missed, and the space before him turned ethereal before being instantly obliterated.

Yang Ye gazed at Master Yuan, fell silent for a moment, and then a ray of light flashed.

Master Yuan’s eyes narrowed slightly. He didn’t go head on against Yang Ye’s attack. Because Yang Ye’s attacks weren’t easy to resist at all now that they were enhanced by that mysterious flame. He’d already paid a terrible price for his initial carelessness. At this moment, his left shoulder was scorched black, and even death energy couldn’t restore his arm.

So, he chose to avoid directly colliding with Yang Ye’s attacks.

He was just about to move away when a mysterious wave of energy appeared here.

The Sword Domain!

Yang Ye’s speed wasn’t as fast as Master Yuan. So if Master Yuan just kept dodging, Yang Ye could do nothing about it. However, he had the Sword Domain, and with the Sword Domain, he could bring Master Yuan’s speed down to his level!

As soon as the Sword Domain appeared, Master Yuan’s figure slowed down, and his expression changed.

He didn’t choose to dodge again, and he took half a step back before slapping his palm forward.

Bang!

A strand of terrifying black light erupted from his palm, and the Sword Domain was instantly filled with pitch black darkness.

A moment of silence ensued, and then a speck of fiery light flashed through the pitch black Sword Domain.

Bang! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

An explosion resounded in the Sword Domain, and then a figure was pushed over 10km away!

It was Master Yuan!

“Die!” Yang Ye’s voice suddenly resounded from the pitch black expanse of space, and then a ray of sword energy shot out like a bolt of lightning. It flashed and instantly arrived before Master Yuan.

Master Yuan frowned to the point a ‘川’ character would be seen on his forehead.

At this moment, he had quite the headache. He couldn’t go head-on against Yang Ye’s sword, so he was locked in a passive position.

He fell silent for a moment, and then he shook his right hand. In an instant, a pitch black spear appeared in his grasp, and then he stabbed it forward. It stabbed straight against the tip of Yang Ye’s sword.

Clang!

A sharp clang resounded. As soon as the tip of his spear struck the tip of Yang Ye’s sword, it instantly melted, and the sight of this made Master Yuan’s expression change.

He was about to pull his spear back when Yang Ye shot forward with his sword and stabbed his sword at Master Yuan’s face. Meanwhile, Master Yuan’s spear had been obliterated, or to be more precise, it had been melted into nothingness!

There were things in this world which could resist the Samadhi Flame, but there were very few. Obviously, Master Yuan’s spear wasn’t one of them!

Bang!

Suddenly, a terrifying aura surged out from within Master Yuan, and Yang Ye was instantly blasted far away!

Once he stopped himself, Yang Ye looked up at Master Yuan. At this moment, a huge amount of black energy had appeared around Master Yuan, and they coiled around him like venomous snakes.

At this moment, Yang Ye noticed that Master Yuan’s aura had grown tremendously!

Master Yuan walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, “Yang Ye, I didn’t expect you to force me to such a state.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Master Yuan took a step forward. In an instant, the space around Yang Ye started to crack open, and then a mysterious wave of energy appeared in the surroundings and enveloped Yang Ye in an instant.

Yang Ye frowned slightly. He glanced at the surroundings and swung his sword!

Hiss!

The space was obliterated around him!

Bang!

Their strength was at the limits of endurance for the space here, so it exploded apart and turned into a black hole.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye swung his sword with both hands.

Swish!

A ray of sword energy flashed through the black hole toward Master Yuan.

Master Yuan clenched his right fist, and countless strands of black energy converged upon it before he slammed it forward.

Bang!

A wave of powerful energy rippled forth and slammed against Yang Ye’s sword energy. This time, Yang Ye’s sword energy wasn’t able to slice through Master Yuan’s attack like it had done so previously, but the energy Master Yuan released wasn’t able to gain the upper hand either.

They exploded apart on contact. Master Yuan was about to attack again when he suddenly frowned because Yang Ye had vanished into the distance.

Master Yuan stopped his attack and was about to give chase, but a voice suddenly resounded, “There’s no need to chase after him.”

Master Yuan’s figure paused for a moment, and then he bowed slightly, “Lord Xiao Lou!”

A voice drifted slowly from the city, “He can’t kill you, but you can’t kill him either. Chasing him is just a waste of time.”

Master Yuan spoke solemnly, “Lord Xiao Lou, his talent is truly rare. Why don’t you kill him and eliminate a future threat for our undying race?”

The voice replied, “Our patriarch is at the critical moment in his cultivation, so I must maintain the Undead Tower’s formation and death energy. While I can still kill him while doing that, there are some unknown experts in the large universe. So, I have to be careful, and so do all of you. As for Yang Ye, I’ll deal with him in the future.”

Master Yuan bowed slightly, “I understand.”

The voice continued, “Go to the large universe and personally oversee the collection of death energy. As for Yang Ye, put it aside for now and prioritize the death energy.”

“Understood!” Master Yuan bowed again and vanished into the sky.

“Little girl!” Meanwhile, a strand of divine sense locked onto Dugu Juetian.

She looked up at the Undead Tower, and the voice came from within, “Once you return to the large universe, be careful. Don’t offend Yang Ye while the patriarch and I haven’t arrived. He possesses precious treasures, so he’s far beyond your ability to deal with. Understand?”

Dugu Juetian bowed respectfully, “I understand!”

The voice said, “You can go!”

She bowed again and left.

Once Dugu Juetian left, the voice resounded once more, “Interesting…”

As soon as the voice finished resounding, a ray of dark energy descended slowly and vanished into nothingness.

At the door of light in the endless black holes.

A young girl had her hands behind her back as she gazed coldly at the door of light. Her face was indifferent, and her eyes were like eternal ice that carried no emotion!
