Chapter 2099 – The Person Pulling the Strings!

This battle allowed Yang Ye to realize that there were geniuses in the large universe, and he just hadn’t encountered them.

At the same time, it revealed how terrifying the resources and reserves of the four paths were.

He’d stayed in the Weapon Path for some time, but he hadn’t met the strongest genius in its younger generation. Now it would seem like it wasn’t that the Weapon Path didn’t possess such an expert, that person had merely not shown themselves.

A short while later, Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Recuperate!

While Yang Ye was recuperating, Li You stopped over 100km away, and there was an old man in front of him.

The old man smiled, “What do you think?”

Li You spoke softly, “He’s very strong, but I don’t think he used his full strength. Otherwise, the strength he displayed earlier isn’t sufficient to fight a Sage.”

The old man nodded, “Both of you should be equally matched, but he has a 70% or 80% chance to win if you fight to the death!”

“Why?” asked Li You. He sounded like he couldn’t accept it, especially when it was his master who said it.

“It’s very simple!” The old man explained, “He can be said to have experienced countless battles throughout his lifetime, and it can be said that his strength was gained with his sword in hand. People like him possess the best mentality and senses in combat. While you’ve experienced countless battles as well, we’re always there standing behind you, so it still affects you to a certain extent. Because when you encounter a powerful opponent, you are very confident, but even if 10% of the confidence comes from us, your confidence and metal state are not perfect.”

Li You fell silent.

Meanwhile, the old man continued, “But Yang Ye is different. His Sword Dao is different from many people. He only believes in himself. 100% of his confidence comes from himself. Moreover, I’m sure you’ve noticed that there’s ferocity and ruthlessness in him that many don’t possess. When combined with his Sword Dao, it gives him the edge.”

Li You gazed at the old man, “Master, you’ve investigated him?”

The old man smiled, “Which organization in the large universe hasn’t? There are both good and bad views about him. But regardless of what it is, as far as I’m concerned, he’ll definitely be extraordinary if he can survive.”

Li You asked, “Why?”

“Ambition!” The old man continued, “He has no ambition. The ambition I’m speaking of is the ambition to possess power or eternal life. While ambition can motivate someone at most times, it also enslaves a person. Lack of desire brings out greatness. Anyway, there are many other things that you can learn from him.”

Li You nodded slightly and asked, “Master, that Bodhi Tree…”

The old man suddenly said, “It isn’t the Bodhi Tree!”

Li You asked, “How do you know?”

The old man replied softly, “An ancestor has stepped forward!”

An ancestor!

Li You was shocked.

Since an ancestor had stepped forward, it represented that this incident wasn’t ordinary. Because progenitors rarely showed themselves, or it should be said that very few things could arouse their attention.

At the same time, Yang Ye had received this information from Yang Lianshuang.

A progenitor had stepped forward.

Yang Ye immediately left Hidden Dragon City and went to the seaside. As soon as he arrived there, he could still see the small island, or it should be said that he could still see the tree. Sure enough, very few Sages were left before it. There were only two.

At this moment, both of them seemed extremely old.

Suddenly, a middle aged man appeared beside Yang Ye.

The middle aged man just appeared there out of thin air, and Yang Ye hadn’t even been able to notice how.

Yang Ye was shocked and glanced over. The middle aged man was wearing a white robe and had his hands behind his back. Besides seeming quite refined, the man was quite ordinary. There was no fluctuation of profound energy from him.

The middle aged man nodded slightly to Yang Ye, and then he looked up at the two Sages, “One must undergo countless hardships to get to the Sage Realm, and it was not easy for them to attain their current realms of cultivation.”

Yang Ye replied, “Unfortunately, they’re going to die.”

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye and smiled, “What do you think about that tree?”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Something’s wrong!”

The middle aged man grinned, “Not bad. Actually, these Sages know it too. However, many are still going there. Do you know why?”

“It’s an opportunity!” Yang Ye replied, “It’s an opportunity for them to attain the Progenitor Realm, so they don’t want to miss it!”

The middle aged man nodded, “That’s one of them. Actually, there’s another reason, and it’s confidence!”

Yang Ye gazed at the middle aged man, “Confidence?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The middle aged man gazed at the tree, “The strength of experts at the Sage Realm is naturally beyond doubt. Besides experts at the Progenitor Realm, who else in this world can pose a threat to them? As far as they are concerned, no one can.”

Yang Ye replied with a question, “Are there other existences?”

“Of course!” The middle aged man said, “Not just that, there are many. The humans and the other races aren’t the only beings to have been born in this universe, there are many other beings, just like the little fellow within you!”

Snowy!

Yang Ye’s expression changed. He knows about Snowy?

The middle aged man smiled, “Don’t worry, I don’t have any ill intent towards you, and I won’t covet your treasures.”

Yang Ye asked solemnly, “Who are you?”

The middle aged man replied, “That isn’t important. Let’s get back to the topic. There are countless beings in this world that many people have never seen, and there are many types of sprites and spirits too. For example, the Sword Supreme. If its Sword Spirit recovers, just that sword can kill a Sage. Besides that, there are many mysterious beings.”

Yang Ye gazed at the tree, “This tree is one too, right?”

The middle aged man smiled, “Actually, I know what it is. While it isn’t the Bodhi Tree, it’s one of the five extraordinary treasures of this world!”

Yang Ye gazed at the middle aged man, “One of the five extraordinary treasures?”

“That pagoda within you and the sword in your hand are ranked among them.” The middle aged man continued, “They are all divine treasures, true divine treasures. However, they are ranked higher than this tree!”

Yang Ye asked, “Are they ranked at the top?”

The middle aged man smiled, “The pagoda is second, and the sword is fourth!”

Yang Ye asked, “What’s the first?”

The middle aged man smiled, “A divine treasure capable of killing progenitors. You may get to see it in the future.”

A divine treasure capable of killing progenitors!

Yang Ye was shocked. What kind of treasure is actually able to kill progenitors too?!

Meanwhile, the middle aged man looked up at the tree, “Do you know what that tree is called?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

“The Divine Void Tree!” The middle aged man spoke softly, “It’s the Divine Void Tree that can make Sages lose their senses with ease. Only a Sage who’s a sword cultivator like you and has comprehended both the Sword Domain and the Enlightened Sword Heart can be able to stay true to their heart. Of course, if you enter it with your current strength, you’ll vanish in an instant!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why is it killing these Sages?”

The middle aged man replied softly, “For revenge!”

“Revenge?” Yang Ye frowned and felt puzzled.

The middle aged man smiled and vanished on the spot. He was in front of the tree when he appeared again. The tree shook violently and seemed to have sensed danger in response.

The middle aged man suddenly tapped a finger forward, “Seal!”

The tree instantly calmed down.

The middle aged man gazed at the Sages before him and waved his right hand lightly. In an instant, they opened their eyes slowly and glanced at the surroundings. A moment later, their gazes descended upon the middle aged man.

A moment later, they stood up and bowed respectfully to the middle aged man, “Thank you for saving our lives!”

The middle aged man nodded slightly, “Go on. Attaining the Progenitor Realm relies more on yourself and not external sources of strength. It’s unwise to entrust your hopes to an external force.”

“Thank you for the guidance!” They bowed to the middle aged man again and vanished into the sky.

Yang Ye gazed at the middle aged man as he watched this scene.

Who is that?

Actually, he had an idea, but he wasn’t sure.

Once they left, the middle aged man gazed at the tree, “Can you really not let the past stay in the past?”

A long time passed before a middle aged man’s voice resounded, “Do you think it can be left in the past?”

The middle aged man shook his head slightly, “It has been a very long time. If you don’t give up on revenge, you may suffer the same fate again.”

“Is that so?” The voice suddenly chuckled, “The large universe isn’t the same anymore, and all the races aren’t the same either. Even the four paths aren’t the same. Besides that, the spirits of the universe aren’t the same as well. Even though the god race isn’t the same god race too, but we’re all the same, aren’t we?”

As soon as the voice finished resounding, a woman in a white dress appeared not too far away from the middle aged man.

Yang Ye’s face fell at the sight of her.

Even though he couldn’t see her appearance, he’d seen her figure quite a few times now.

The god race.

Everything was clear now.

The god race had been behind all of it!

The god race!
