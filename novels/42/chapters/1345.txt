Chapter 1346 – What A Long Nap!

A woman was standing before Yang Ye. She wore a white dress, and she had a cold and aloof expression. She was like a piece of 10,000 year old ice and emanated ghastly coldness. Her figure was ethereal and indistinct like smoke, and it was like she would be blown away with the wind at any moment.

After she appeared here, the sword intent in the surroundings surged towards her and were completely absorbed by her.

The sword spirit!

She was the sword spirit who had been in deep sleep for so long!

Yang Ye visibly relaxed when he saw her, and then he smiled, “You really took a long nap.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The Sword Spirit replied, “Isn’t it all your fault?”

Yang Ye chuckled while a trace of guilt could be seen in his eyes, “Don’t worry, I’m an Emperor now, my body is at the Epoch Realm, and my sword intent is at the Rebirth Rank. I think I can control your strength now. From now on, you won’t fall into a deep sleep because of me.”

She glanced at him and nodded slightly, “I never expected you to have grown to such a level.”

Suddenly, a voice resounded in the sky, “A sword that transcends the ranking system!”

Yang Ye and the Sword Spirit looked up. At this moment, Nie Wuming’s gaze was on the Sword Spirit, and there was a trace of surprise and shock in his eyes. Nie Wuming wasn’t the only one, even Mo Xiaoleng had surprise and shock in her eyes.

Nie Wuming stared fixedly at Yang Ye as if he wanted to see through Yang Ye. How precious was a treasure that transcended the ordinary ranks of treasures? After all, Dark Hell Continent only had a single treasure like that throughout its history, and it was the Stellar Sword Diagram. Even the heaven defying Sword God’s Seal on Yang Ye’s forehead had a rank. Yet now, Yang Ye actually possessed a sword that transcended such ranks!

A moment of silence ensued before Nie Wuming suddenly chuckled, “I just stepped into the Semi-Deity Realm and lack a suitable treasure. I never expected it to immediately show itself. Yang Ye, I really have to thank you!”

“Fool!” Mo Xiaoleng glanced at Nie Wuming while ridicule was clearly visible in her gaze. Nie Wuming was an utter bumpkin and didn’t know how terrifying such a treasure was, but as someone from the large world of this universe, she naturally knew how terrifying such a treasure was. After all, she’d witnessed it with her own eyes.

What did it mean to transcend the ranking system?

It represented that no ranking could describe a treasure’s potential and might!

If it was any other type of treasure, then it might be quite difficult for Yang Ye to defeat Nie Wuming. After all, Nie Wuming was a Semi-Deity and was 2 realms of cultivation above Yang Ye. However, it was a sword that stood before Yang Ye, a sword! Its might would be absolutely terrifying when Yang Ye merged into one with that sword.

So, Mo Xiaoleng couldn’t help but ridicule him when she saw him look down upon his enemy.

The Sword Spirit and Yang Ye exchanged glances. They didn’t waste a single breath, and the Sword Spirit just shook and transformed into a sword that floated before Yang Ye.

He took a deep breath as he gazed at the sword before him, and then he stretched out his hand and held it. As soon as he held onto it, it instantly trembled, and then Yang Ye felt like he’d merged with the sword. No, it wasn’t just a feeling, he was the sword, and the sword was him!

The Sword Spirit had acknowledged him as her master from a very long time ago. So, their hearts and minds had long since become joint as one. Thus, the moment he held onto the sword was the moment he merged into one with it.

Yang Ye sheathed it!

Om!

A sword howl suddenly shot up into the sky, and then the space around Yang Ye started to ripple violently and crack apart. It seemed to be unable to endure Yang Ye’s strength, and it was extremely shocking.

Mo Xiaoleng stared fixedly and soundlessly at Yang Ye with her hands clenched tight.

Nie Wuming’s eyes narrowed slightly when he saw Yang Ye grab the sword, and there was a solemn expression in his eyes. Because he’d sensed danger. He didn’t dare act carelessly. He waved his hands and the spirit energy in the surroundings instantly surged into him. After that, he clenched his fists. As soon as his fists were fully clenched, the space around him cracked apart!

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Ye suddenly looked up at Nie Wuming. There was a wisp of ferocity on the corners of his mouth. A moment later, Yang Ye stomped his right foot against the ground. The ground collapsed while Yang Ye’s figure relied on the counterforce to instantly shoot up towards Nie Wuming while assisted by the wings on his back, Blink!

Nie Wuming’s eyes narrowed even further, and there was ferocity in his eyes as well. He didn’t hesitate to pull his arms back when Yang Ye’s figure charged up into the sky, and then he swiftly slammed his fists forward.

Bang!

2 energy fists flashed forward, and then shot at Yang Ye in succession.

When Yang Ye was around 1m away from them, he swiftly drew his sword.

Om!

A sword howl resounded through the sky. At this moment, space in an area of tens of thousands of kilometers cracked apart in an instant, and the energy fist was instantly obliterated at the moment Yang Ye drew his sword!

Nie Wuming’s pupils constricted at the sight of this, and he was astounded. He hadn’t expected Yang Ye’s attack to actually be so terrifying, and then a terrifying aura surged out from within him. At the same time, he swiftly twisted his right hand and slapped his palm forward.

It seemed like just a single attack, but he’d actually overlapped over 1,000 attacks!

A huge palm that was around 30m thick flashed forward, and it slammed down at Yang Ye who was less than 30m away from him.

Yang Ye’s sword struck the huge palm, and then it shook violently.

Hiss!

A moment of silence ensued before Yang Ye and his sword pierced through the center of the palm. The palm shattered in an instant, and it transformed into fragments of energy that enveloped both Yang Ye and Nie Wuming.

Everyone in the surroundings stared fixedly at the sky. Especially Zi’er and Snowy. Zi’er’s hands were clenched tightly and were trembling. As for Snowy, she kept alternating between covering her eyes and peeking at the sky. Her eyes were filled with anxiousness.

At this moment, Mo Xiaoleng was staring fixedly at the sky as well, but there was no anxiety in her eyes. There was only coldness and indifference there.

Around 10 breaths of time later, the fragments of energy in the sky vanished. Yang Ye and Nie Wuming appeared within everyone’s vision. At this moment, Yang Ye was 300m behind Nie Wuming.

Who won?

A few moments of silence ensued before Nie Wuming suddenly said, “That attack.... What’s its name?”

Yang Ye replied, “Heavenrend!”

Nie Wuming was stunned, and then he muttered softly, “Heavenrend.... Amazing....”

As soon as he finished speaking, his body started to become ethereal. A few moments later, his entire body was translucent before vanishing completely.

The experts throughout Doomsday City started to cheer and seethe with excitement when they witnessed this scene. Numerous cheers resounded throughout the city, and even Ye Liuyun, Dugu Jian, and the others couldn’t help but smile.

At the moment Nie Wuming vanished on the spot, Zi’er’s tightly clenched fists had instantly relaxed, and a smile appeared on her face. Snowy’s face was covered in excitement and happiness. She ceaselessly rubbed her head against Zi’er’s cheek and seemed extremely happy.

Meanwhile, Mo Xiaoleng lowered her head slightly and spoke softly, “Aunt Xiao, you’ve been avenged.”

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief as well. Actually, he hadn’t been confident in his ability to kill Nie Wuming. After all, Nie Wuming was a Semi-Deity that was 2 realms higher than him in cultivation. Fortunately, his current strength was far greater than before. Not only had his cultivation improved, his physical strength had improved tremendously as well. Moreover, even his sword intent had arrived at the Rebirth Rank.

The Heavenrend he executed with his current strength was countless times stronger than before. However, it still wasn’t easy for him. Even though its might had risen tremendously, the consumption it required was extremely terrifying as well. Just that attack had instantly consumed half of his profound energy!

Moreover, his entire body felt sore right now, and it felt like he’d overused his strength. Fortunately, it was much better than how it had been before this. In the past, he would be practically reduced into a heavily injured and unconscious state upon executing the true form of Heavenrend, and he was sometimes even reduced to a crippled state and put on the verge of death.... So, the current consequences were very good.

However, there was one unfortunate aspect, and it was that it truly exhausted too much profound energy. Based on his current strength, he could execute it around twice when he was at a peak state. Twice was the limits of his body and profound energy. After that, it wouldn’t just be his profound energy that was exhausted completely, even his body would be in a similar state.

Yang Ye took a deep breath while a slight smile appeared on his face. The demon race had retreated while Nie Wuming was gone. Now, he could finally rest. But it didn’t take long for him to laugh bitterly and shake his head. Rest? He didn’t have the time to rest. The time limit of 3 years was almost up.

He didn’t just have to go look for Lady, he had to return to the Radiant Dimension!

A life of constant work!

Yang Ye shook his head. Suddenly he frowned and gazed at Mo Xiaoleng because he felt like there was something off about her.

Mo Xiaoleng glanced at Yang Ye, and then she looked up at the sky and spoke softly, “It should be here....”

Bang!

As soon as she finished speaking, a loud explosion resounded in the sky, and then the sky was transformed into an ocean of fire.

Everyone including Yang Ye was stunned by this scene.

Meanwhile, a smile had curled up on the corners of Mo Xiaoleng’s mouth.

A few moments later, a huge fiery claw emerged from above the sky, and then Mo Xiaoleng suddenly said, “Yang Ye, you’re not worthy of having them by your side.”

As soon as she finished speaking, a strand of terrifying flames suddenly erupted from within her. After that, Mo Xiaoleng transformed into a fiery phoenix. At the same time, that huge claw suddenly entered the expanse of space in front of it. A moment later, the huge claw appeared above Zi’er and Snowy, and then it enveloped them before they could even react. In an instant, the huge claw vanished once more.

Meanwhile, Mo Xiaoleng who’d transformed into a phoenix had appeared high above in the sky.

“Mo Xiaoleng! I’ll kill you!” Yang Ye’s eyes had instantly turned completely blood red when he saw Zi’er and Snowy being captured by the huge fiery claw, and then he stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that shot up towards the ocean of fire in the sky.
