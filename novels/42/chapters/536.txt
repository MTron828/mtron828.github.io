Chapter 537 – An Nanjing’s True Strength!

Yang Ye really wasn’t trying to take advantage of her, nor did he have any thoughts of doing so. The reason he’d grabbed her hand was because their wills had to merge together through their bodies, otherwise, their bodies would definitely reject the will of the other.

An Nanjing’s figure stiffened slightly when Yang Ye grabbed her hand, and then she turned her head to glance at him yet didn’t say anything.

“Let’s go!” Yang Ye shouted as he pulled An Nanjing’s hand and flashed swiftly up the stone steps. Even though the two of them weren’t flying, moving at their full strength made them no slower than flying. Less than 2 breaths of time had passed before they passed a few hundred steps.

“Hmm?” A wisp of surprise flashed through the old man’s eyes when he saw An Nanjing and Yang Ye ascend swiftly. Because the stone steps were covered with 40 times the normal strength of gravity, and it shocked him that they actually seemed to not be affected at all!

“Interesting!” A wisp of a smile arose on the corners of the old man’s mouth, and then he pressed his palm downward.

80 times the normal strength of gravity!

This time, the old man didn’t increase the gravity for everyone, and he only did it especially for An Nanjing and Yang Ye. Because he was very clearly aware that their lives wouldn’t be in danger even if they endured 80 times the normal strength of gravity. If the others were to suddenly suffer 80 times the force of gravity pressing down upon them, then they would definitely be crushed to death on the spot.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing suddenly stopped moving when the gravity they experienced had risen to 80 times the norm.

But in the next moment, the energy of two terrifying intents surged out explosively from within their bodies, and then they flashed swiftly up the stone steps again. This time, they were even faster than before!

The old man’s expression changed slightly when he witnessed this scene. He instinctively raised his hand and pressed down, and then he immediately regretted his decision! Because it was now 160 times the normal force of gravity!

When 160 times the normal force of gravity pressed down upon them, the energy of Intent which surged around them had been instantly blasted apart, and it caused their bodies to stoop. If their wills weren’t firm and tenacious to the extreme, then they would have probably slumped to the ground.

“Motherfucker! Is that geezer trying to kill us!?” Yang Ye felt like the bones throughout his body were cracking when this ‘mountain’ of gravity smashed down upon him. An Nanjing frowned as well, and besides bewilderment, there was also a trace of anger in her eyes.

The two of them relied on their strong wills to stand up slowly. The old man who was about to withdraw the gravity exclaimed with surprise upon witnessing this scene, and he gazed at An Nanjing and Yang Ye with astonishment. Because that was 160 times the normal strength of gravity. They are even able to endure that? The surprise in the old man’s eyes gradually transformed into pleasant surprise.

“Why have An Nanjing and Yang Ye stopped moving?” Elder Yun spoke abruptly.

Luo Jun and the others raised their heads to look over upon hearing this. Sure enough, An Nanjing and Yang Ye were standing on the spot without moving. However, their expressions immediately changed drastically when they saw Yang Ye and An Nanjing holding hands. Especially Luo Jun, his expression had instantly turned gloomy. Because the thing he didn’t want to see the most was Yang Ye and An Nanjing joining forces, but the current scene told him that there was definitely something between the two of them!

“They might have offended that old man!” Elder Yun said, “The reason they aren’t moving might be because the old man is targeting them. Haha! Those who flaunt their strength are always prone to dying earlier. They disregarded the force of gravity from before, so isn’t that like a slap to the old man’s face? Now, he has even started targeting them!”

“This is the best opportunity to kill them!” The black clothed figure by Luo Jun’s side spoke abruptly.

Elder Yun’s eyes lit up when he heard this, and he said, “Shadow is right. Mortal Emperor, the two of them aren’t moving at all right now, so the old man has definitely done something to them. It’s precisely the best moment to act against them.”

Luo Jun was slightly tempted by this, but he seemed to have some worries as well.

“Mortal Emperor, we won’t have another opportunity like this, so we can’t let it slip by. We must attack right away!” Elder Yun spoke in a slightly anxious voice.

Luo Jun fell silent for a while before a fierce expression flashed through his eyes. He said, “Elder Yun, Shadow. Both of you attack together!” An Nanjing and Yang Ye have to be eliminated, otherwise, we can forget about the future. I wouldn’t even be able to obtain the World Portrait if they were to continue joining forces in Saint Liu Yun’s ruins. So, they must die!

Elder Yun and Shadow nodded, and then they sped up.

“The gravity is too strong. Do you have any way to deal with it?” Yang Ye spoke in a low voice. He could overcome the gravity and blast it apart if he utilized his Sword Domain, but he didn’t want to expose how terrifying it was unless he had no other choice. Moreover, who knew what the old man at the top of the steps would do even if he did utilize his Sword Domain?

“He’s targeting us!” said An Nanjing.

“Could it be because we’re too extraordinary?” said Yang Ye.

An Nanjing’s eyelids twitched, and then she glanced at Yang Ye and said, “The stone steps are used to eliminate and test us. Our display was too extraordinary, and it can be said to be like a slap to the geezer’s face. That’s why he’s increasing the gravity we experience. Of course, this is a good thing because it represents that he thinks highly of us. If you’re able to ascend to the end of the stone steps while suffering from 160 times the normal force of gravity, then perhaps he will give Saint Liu Yun’s inheritance to you!”

“Are you not interested in Saint Liu Yun’s inheritance at all?” Yang Ye said, “That’s the inheritance of a Saint Realm expert!”

An Nanjing shook her head and said, “I have my own path of the Martial Dao!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Yang Ye was about to speak when the gravity which pressed down upon him increased again.

200 times!

Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s expressions changed slightly. Yang Ye raised his head to look over and saw a wide smile on the old man’s face. It was like the old man was saying. “Go on! Talk more! Talk!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He was just about to activate his Sword Domain when his pupils suddenly constricted. Because a black clothed figure had suddenly appeared behind him. At the same time, a dagger stabbed against the back of his neck. Yang Ye paid no attention to the black clothed man and that dagger, and he swiftly turned around to look at An Nanjing. He saw an enormous palm slap down towards her head.

Killing intent surged explosively within Yang Ye’s eyes when he witnessed this scene, and then his 9th level Sword Intent swept out from within him. The dagger against his neck was instantly blasted away, and the black clothed figure was forced to take a few steps back as well.

9th level Sword Intent? Astonishment filled the eyes of the old man at the top of the stone steps who was just about to act. That kid really concealed his strength well. He was actually able to deceive me? Wait! An expert has helped that kid conceal his aura.

“How interesting!” The old man didn’t lend a hand, and a smile covered his face.

After he activated his 9th level Sword Intent, the force of gravity he experienced was instantly reduced by a huge amount, and then Yang Ye pulled An Nanjing behind him and smashed his fist forward against that enormous hand.

Bang!

Yang Ye was restrained by 200 times the normal force of gravity, so how could he possibly resist the full forced attack of a ninth rank Exalt Realm expert? His fist had just come into contact with that hand when a mouthful of blood sprayed from Yang Ye’s mouth, and then his legs bent a little. He’d almost fallen to his knees!

“You’re courting death!” Elder Run roared furiously while he clenched his palm into a fist, and then he smashed a punch towards Yang Ye’s head. Elder Yun’s fist grew larger and larger, and it was the size of a cauldron when it arrived before Yang Ye. The gale created from the force of the punch caused Yang Ye’s hair to flutter.

At the same time, a few dozed cold rays of light flashed and appeared before Yang Ye, and then a few dozen blades of light slashed down towards all the weak points on his body.

A wisp of a ferocious expression appeared on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth. He was just about to activate his Sword Domain when an explosion resounded, and it caused the expressions of everyone in the surroundings to change drastically.

The gazes of everyone had converged onto An Nanjing.

Strands of terrifying Intent were surging out explosively from within her.

9th level Fist Intent!

9th level Battle Intent!

9th level Spear Intent!

9th level Speed Intent!

9th level Strength Intent!

At this moment, everyone in the surroundings was completely dumbstruck, and it included the old man in Daoist robes at the top of the stone steps.

For the very first time, fear had appeared in Luo Jun’s eyes.

Bang!

However, this wasn’t the end of it because another Intent surged out from within her.

9th level Slaughter Intent!

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched at this moment.

An Nanjing looked Yang Ye in the eye and said, “Haven’t you always been curious about exactly how strong I am? I’ll let you see for yourself today!” As soon as she finished speaking, An Nanjing stretched out her hand and clenched it. “Fuse!”

Yang Ye was able to sense that the 6 types of 9th level Intent in the surroundings had instantly fused into a single Intent when An Nanjing spoke that word. When this completely new Intent formed from 6 Intents appeared here, Yang Ye felt a slight chill run down his spin. An Nanjing is truly heaven defying! Because he’d sensed a strong feeling of danger from her.

“Fuck off!” An Nanjing shouted at Elder Yun whose eyes were filled with terror. The completely new Intent instantly blasted onto Elder Yun’s body, and then everyone watched with astonishment as Elder Yun’s figure was blasted flying. Moreover, he started rolling down the stone steps after he crashed to the ground.

The eyes of everyone opened wide as they gazed at An Nanjing with disbelief.

This is the Martial God? The invincible Martial God?I probably wouldn’t be a match for her if I hadn’t comprehended the Sword Domain, right? The strength An Nanjing revealed shocked Yang Ye. An Nanjing was a true monstrous genius, and he was very clearly aware that he, the Sword Emperor of this era, would definitely be suppressed by An Nanjing if it wasn’t for the Sword Domain that he’d comprehended.

Shadow’s figure flashed and transformed into over a thousand afterimages as he retreated. A wisp of disdain arose on the corners of An Nanjing’s mouth as her figure flashed as well, and then a few thousand afterimages appeared in the surroundings. After that, a bang resounded as a figure fell before the Mortal Emperor, Luo Jun.

“I warned you not to offend me, but you refused to listen!” An Nanjing walked slowly towards Luo Jun and said, “Since you’ve made such a choice, then I’ll kill you!”

Luo Jun’s expression was unsightly to the extreme because he suddenly noticed that he didn’t have any confidence in being able to best this Martial God, An Nanjing, in battle!

Right when An Nanjing was about to attack, an old man in a linen robe appeared before her, and the old man smiled bitterly as he shook his head. “Little Girl, leave it at that. Otherwise, your Ancestor, I, would have no choice but to take you with me and flee for our lives.”

A Monarch Realm expert!

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted. He was actually able to enter the Saint Ruins? Yang Ye turned around to look at the old man in Daoist robes and saw that the old man had an indifferent expression as if he hadn’t noticed the old man in a linen robe.

An Nanjing stared the old man in the eye and said, “He attacked me first!”

“I know!” The old man said, “But it can’t be helped. He has the support of too many people while you only have me.”

An Nanjing fell silent.

The old man sighed and said, “I know it’s unfair, and I’m aggrieved as well. But these are the facts of the situation. They are stronger than us, so we can only endure it even if we feel aggrieved.”

“I won’t make things difficult for you, Ancestor!” An Nanjing turned around and walked towards the stone steps.

The old man shook his head, and then he glanced at Luo Jun and said, “If it wasn’t out of consideration for your ancestor, I would really like to smack you to death right now. Even your ancestor doesn’t dare act against her, yet you actually dared to arouse killing intent towards her. Do you think that you’re the rules of the continent now?”

Luo Jun’s face turned gloomy.

The old man paid no further attention to Luo Jun, and he looked at Yang Ye instead and said, “As for you, stop seeking out that little girl from my clan, otherwise, I’ll kill you even if the Demon Emperor is protecting you.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man in a linen robe waved his right hand, and then both Elder Yun and Shadow who were heavily injured and lying on the ground had instantly exploded into pieces. After that, the old man didn’t even spare another glance at Luo Jun before he vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye’s eyes lit up when he saw both Elder Yun and Shadow being killed. Isn’t this the best opportunity to kill Luo Jun?
