Chapter 2472 – Let’s Do It!

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “Most importantly what?”

The old man grinned, “This seal possesses the strength of ten worlds. When I say ten worlds, I mean the strength of 10 real mid-level worlds. If you release it, even a Five World Realm expert may be smashed to death in an instant!”

The strength of 10 worlds!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and asked, “Senior, what’s above the Five World Realm? The Six World Realm?”

The old man shook his head, “No!”

Yang Ye asked, “Then what is it?”

The old man thought for a moment and said, “The Limitbreaker Realm is divided into five realms. At the fifth realm, an expert can destroy five worlds with a single attack, and that expert’s strength will come to a transformation point, a qualitative transformation. After that, it will enter a new realm, and this realm is known as “Lord”.

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Lord?”

The old man nodded, “Above the True World Realm is the World Lord Realm. I’m sure you’re aware of that, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I am!”

The old man explained, “The World Lord Realm is a realm where a person grasps the energy of a world and forms a small world within themselves. However, once a person transcends the Five World Realm, their energy will undergo a transformation, and this transformation may not result in just one world. There may be countless worlds. So, the world is removed from the name, and it’s called the Lord Realm! Here, allow me to display the difference between these realms!”

The old man stretched out his hand and grasped. The world throughout the Primordial Pagoda suddenly trembled.

The old man gazed at Yang Ye, “The World Lord Realm allows me to truly grasp the energy of a world. Of course, it’s only a low-level world.”

He unfurled his fist and pressed his palm down instead.

The world throughout the Primordial Pagoda turned ethereal!

The old man stopped and said, “That’s the Limitbreaker Realm’s ability to destroy the world.”

After that, he pushed his hands forward gently.

It seemed like the entire world was being pushed down!

That was what Yang Ye and the others felt! Moreover, they were certain that if the old man wanted to, he could push down this world!

The old man stopped, and the world returned to normal!

The old man explained, “You can think of the Lord Realm like this. People in that realm don’t just possess brute strength. They’ve comprehended higher laws of the universe, and they know how to use some of those laws. They’ve truly transcended above the scope of strength and speed, unless you possess absolute strength or speed! But people who possess that have usually arrived above the Lord Realm.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t really get it!”

The old man smiled, “Right, I did make it a little complicated. Simply speaking, the Lord Realm represents being the lord over energy. You are the lord of the world. Take yourself and Eternal Border for example, you’re actually still within its boundaries. While you can destroy the world with your attacks, you’re still within its boundaries. But the Lord Realm has transcended out of that scope, and they can even make their own boundaries. Of course, there are few people like that. To put it is simpler terms, it’s a difference between being inside and outside the boundary!”

Inside and outside!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Can someone inside the boundary kill someone outside of it?”

The old man smiled, “Of course it’s possible. People outside the boundary are merely a little ahead of the people within it. But it doesn’t represent that they are definitely stronger. Besides that, I noticed that you have a vague concept of these realms of cultivation. What I’m talking about is you’ve misunderstood or have a mistaken idea of the true meaning of these realms!”UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Yang Ye bowed respectfully, “Senior, please provide me with your guidance!”

The old man said, “For example, the Limitbreaker Realm. A small world or a mid-level world, it’s still destroying a world, and it’s the same even if it’s used against a high-level world. A person only capable of destroying a small world can never kill someone outside the boundary, but someone who can destroy a high-level world in the Limitbreaker Realm is entirely capable of killing someone outside the boundary. A single realm of cultivation actually has a good and bad version of it. Just like in the academies of the mortal world. They study the same books and have the same teachers, yet the results of each student in a class varies!”

He gazed at Yang Ye when he spoke up to this point, “Some people suppress their cultivation, and the true reason for that is so that they can improve themselves to their limits. For example, a Limitbreaker Realm suppresses themselves to be capable of destroying a high-level world, and then continues further, instead of just advancing for the sake of advancing. Or just like the students in the mortal world. Some people just memorize everything when they go through a class, and they just learn to get good results. But some truly understand and grasp what they learn. There’s a fundamental difference between them!”

Tian Xiu!

At this moment, Yang Ye thought of Tian Xiu. Obviously, she was the latter, and the Unfettered One was probably the same!

The old man suddenly gazed at An Nanjing and smiled, “Actually, you’re the latter too. Every step you take is very steady, and it will allow you to go further.”

“What about me?” Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “Can you tell me about my flaws?”

The old man shook his head.

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

The old man felt quite helpless, “Because you have too many, and it’ll take too long!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, Snowy pointed at herself to ask about her.

The old man glanced at Snowy, “Your flaw is being too shameless. You think everything is yours. How can you have such shameless thoughts?”

Snowy was stunned.

“Hey!” Suddenly, Erya walked over to the old man. She glanced at him and said, “Old man, you gave all of them something, so give me one too!”

The old man gazed at her, and his eyes narrowed slightly.

Erya was quite displeased, “Why are you looking at me like that?!”

A short while passed before the old man sighed softly, “You’re currently pure and kind. I… Sigh, I hope you’ll stay like this forever.”

He hesitated for a moment and flicked a thumb-sized pearl of blood into her forehead. In an instant, a powerful aura swept out from within her, and then pitch black scales appeared all over her body. Besides that, the horns on her head grew slightly longer like antlers. They were sharp and seemed quite cute.

A long tail grew out behind her too. The tail was pitch black, and there were fine scales on it too. Besides that, the end of the tail was sharp, very sharp!

The most dazzling part of her changes was her claws!

At this moment, they were like dragon claws. Every one of them was extremely sharp, and their edges were thin like the wings of a cicada. They made people shudder from the sight of them!

Erya blinked and said, “Old man, what’s all of this?”

The old man explained, “That was a huge drop of blood, and it can help you awaken some of your abilities in advance. Listen well to what I’m about to say. If it was before this, then even if I spared your life, I would never help you. But the facts of each situation must be considered. There’s no viciousness coming from you, nor do you have any arrogant thoughts. Moreover, you have your own friends here. So, I’m willing to help you and see what kind of path you will take. Of course, I hope you continue on this path.”

Erya blinked, “Old man, I don’t really understand what you’re trying to say. But can you give me a few hundred drops of that blood?”

She licked her lips as she spoke. That drop of blood had been absolutely delicious, and it was comparable to a few dozen Primal True Dragons!

“A few hundred drops!” Even the old man’s beard shook with rage, “Do you think that was water? That was an ancient…” He shook his head and continued, “I won’t go on about that. Anyway, I don’t have more. Just remember that while you’ve gained some new abilities in advance, you should learn the combat techniques of humans. It’s very beneficial to you. Don’t just rely solely on brute strength.”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Senior, what is Erya?”

The old man glanced at her and replied indifferently, “Her origins is extraordinary. It’ll definitely give you a huge “pleasant surprise” in the future.”

“Is it very huge?” Erya’s eyes lit up, “Why don’t I know about it?”

The old man replied indifferently, “You know nothing. If you knew, this kid would have been killed by you a long time ago!”

Erya was quite displeased, “Old man, how can you say that? Big Brother Yang has gone through left and death with me. How could I possibly kill him? I’m telling you right now, don’t try to sow discord between us, or I’ll hit you!”

As far as she was concerned, Yang Ye couldn’t be offended. After all, she was relying on him to fill her stomach! He was her rice bowl!

The old man’s face twitched, “I don’t want to talk to you anymore.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “The Universe Seal can only be considered a partial Super Divine Treasure. However, it’s merely inferior to that sword and Demon Wings of Death that you possess. It holds extremely powerful energy, so be careful when you use it. Anyway, I’m going to Eternal Kingdom. Spirit energy has been fluctuating violently over there lately. I’m certain they’re up to something, so I have to take a look. As for us, hmm… I hope we never meet again. You’re absolutely shameless, and you’ve taught both these little fellows to be as shameless as you. You should think about what you’ve done!”

The old man left the Primordial Pagoda.

Outside the pagoda.

Yang Ye was just about to say something when the old man vanished into the distance.

Snowy stood on Yang Ye’s shoulders and just stared pitiably at the old man’s bamboo chest. As she watched it vanish, Snowy suddenly looked at Yang Ye and clenched her paws while determination covered her face.

She was saying—“Let’s take it from him! Let’s do it!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
