Chapter 2057 – Prehistoric Civilization!

Originite!

Yang Ye stopped and gazed at her.

His ultimate goal here was Originite. Originite contained the techniques of the Prehistoric Civilization. While he had his own Sword Dao, and he refused to take the path of another, learning from others was important.

Perhaps there were geniuses in the world who made themselves, but Yang Ye wasn’t one of them.

He had to ceaselessly learn from the strong points of others to perfect himself.

Li Shui’shui’s lips curled into a smile when she saw Yang Ye stop, and she smiled like a sly little fox. She walked quickly over to Yang Ye and said, “I knew you wouldn’t be willing to stay as a librarian.”

Yang Ye said, “Go on, tell me about it.”

Li Shui’shui naturally knew what Yang Ye meant, and she immediately smiled, “There are two ways to get Originite. The first is to obtain it through the academy. There are some in the academy, but they require student points, and the amount required is simply capable of arousing despair in us. Because it costs 100,000 student points each. Based on my initial estimations, all the students in the entire academy may not have 100,000 points in total.”

Yang Ye gazed at her and waited for her to continue.

She continued, “The other way is to find Originite ourselves.”

Yang Ye asked, “Where?”

She smiled, “Prehistoric Ruins. It’s where the prehistoric civilization once resided, and it’s most likely to contain Originite. However, it’s very dangerous, extremely dangerous. It isn’t even rare for a Sage to fall there!”

Yang Ye fell silent. He was thinking.

Meanwhile, Li Shui’shui added, “So? Wanna try?”

Yang Ye replied, “What would I do about the library?”

She smiled, “That’s easy. I’ll help you find someone to take care of it.”

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to nod, “Alright, shall we go now?”

Li Shui’shui shook her head slightly, “Big Sis Wo You and I have to get prepared. Oh, right. Let me introduce both of you. This beauty by my side is Wo You. She’ll be going with us.”

Yang Ye gazed at her and nodded slightly.

She glanced at Yang Ye and nodded slightly too.

Li Shui’shui smiled, “We’ll meet again at this time tomorrow.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished into the distance with Wo You.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and vanished on the spot.

“So soon…” A voice muttered softly.

…

Yang Ye returned to the library, and he saw Tian Xiu outside it. A sword was floating by her side.

Tian Xiu immediately ran over to Yang Ye when she saw him, and then she looked up at him and asked, “Are you leaving?”

Yang Ye was quite surprised, “How did you know?”

Tian Xiu didn’t speak and just gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye rubbed her little head, “For a while.”

“What about me?” Tian Xiu stared at him without blinking, and she quietly clenched her fists. Obviously, she was quite nervous.

Yang Ye smiled, “I’ll be taking you along, of course!”

He walked over to the stone table and sat down once he finished speaking.

Tian Xiu’s fists relaxed, and a trace of an imperceptible smile appeared on her face.

Yang Ye withdrew the spatial ring he’d gotten from Gao You and glanced through it. There were all sorts of things in it, but besides student points, there was nothing else that could catch his attention.

Gao You had a total of 230 points.

Yang Ye was quite disappointed because it was really quite little. However, it was better with nothing. Combined with the points he’d gained from Li Shui’shui, he had over 300 now. But an Originite was 100,000 points!

Yang Ye shook his head. Obviously, the academy wouldn’t allow someone to get an Originite that easily.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at Tian Xiu who was looking at him while lying on his table. He smiled, “What is it?”

Tian Xiu thought for a moment and replied, “Why aren’t you afraid of me?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Why should I be afraid of you?”

Tian Xiu wanted to say something, but Yang Ye rubbed her head, “Tian Xiu, I know you’re not ordinary, but remember that we don’t have to care about what others think in this world. So long as you have a clear conscience, then even if the world hates us, so what? In any case, we aren’t relying on them to live.”

Tian Xiu seemed to be thinking about Yang Ye’s words as she laid there.

Yang Ye didn’t say anything else and just immersed his mind into the Primordial Pagoda.

Time passed very quickly.

The next day, Yang Ye left the library.

In the starry sky, Yang Ye met Li Shui’shui and Wo You.

Wo You smiled, “How punctual!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Let’s go!”

They vanished into the distance.

Li Shui’shui spoke as they traveled, “There are seven known Prehistoric Ruins, and we can’t go to six of them.”

Yang Ye was quite puzzled, “Why?”

Li Shui’shui smiled, “Because they are under the control of the four paths and some other mysterious forces. Of course, our academy is among them. However, we can’t enter the ruins that belong to the academy. It can only be accessed at certain special times and with sufficient student points.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why hasn’t anyone taken the final ruins?”

Li Shui’shui smiled, “If they take everything and refuse to give others even a bit, hehe… They don’t want to go too far, so they decided to keep the last one open to everyone. However, they emptied out the ruins before they did that.”

Yang Ye frowned, “Then why are we even going?”

“To try our luck!” Li Shui’shui smiled, “To see if they missed anything. After all, some people did find Originite there in the past.”

Yang Ye looked up into the depths of space, “All resources are always in their hands.”

Fairness?

It wasn’t that this world was devoid of fairness, but the fairness was only limited to certain scopes.

Suddenly, Li Shui’shui said, “We’ve arrived!”

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and looked over. There was a huge white planet there, and when looked at from this angle, it was covered in cracks and seemed like it was on the verge of shattering.

Besides that, space was trembling incessantly around it, and it seemed very unstable. Besides that, Yang Ye saw some remains, the remains of planets. They didn’t float off into space and were just floating silently around the white planet.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “The Prehistoric Civilization really existed.”

“Of course!” Li Shui’shui spoke with certainty, “The universe is boundless, so how could we possibly be the only civilization? Moreover, I think that there were definitely more civilizations before the Prehistoric Civilization. However, no civilization is eternal.”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Why?”

“Because of greed!” It wasn’t Li Shui’shui who gave him this answer, it was Tian Xiu who was within the pagoda, “Mother said that every civilization is taking from the universe without holding back, and taking too much equals to destruction. Only destruction can lead to new life!”

Yang Ye was shocked, and he asked, “Tian Xiu, are these your own thoughts? Or?”

Tian Xiu replied softly, “Mother told me!”

Tian Xiu’s mother!

“Hey! Are you listening to me?!” Meanwhile, Li Shui’shui’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s ears.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at her, “Let’s go!”

Li Shui’shui gnashed her teeth in anger when she heard him.

They sped up, and it didn’t take long for them to enter the white planer.

Desolate.

As soon as they descended to the ground, Yang Ye’s first impression of it was that it was a desolate place. A gray sky that seemed like a storm was coming, just a few mountains within the scope of his vision, and extremely tall weeds all over the ground.

Yang Ye gazed at Li Shui’shui, and the latter gazed at Wo You. Wo You glanced at the surroundings and withdrew a disk.

“A treasure seeking disk!” Li Shui’shui smiled and explained, “It can locate treasures. Senior Sister Wo You used almost 1,000 student points to get it.”

“A few of us combined our points together to get it.” Meanwhile, Wo You finally spoke, “Everyone can only use it for a day in a month. Today just happens to be my turn.”

As she spoke, she tapped the disk, and it didn’t take long for it to spin and point its black needle at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was speechless.

Both Li Shui’shui and Wo You gazed at him.

“Tsk, tsk…” Li Shui’shui sized up Yang Ye, “You definitely have a lot of treasures, huh? So, you should be careful. Everyone here has something similar to see out treasures, so some may come looking for you.”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Wo You’s expression suddenly changed slightly, “Someone’s coming!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly. He glanced at the surroundings but didn’t notice anyone. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Let’s go!” Wo You took Li Shui’shui’s hand and started fleeing.

However, a green barrier of light suddenly rose up into the air around 30m away from them, and it completely blocked off their way. After that, a woman in a green dress appeared before them.

At the same time, a black robed man suddenly appeared behind them.

The black robed man walked slowly in their direction, “Students of Martial Emperor Academy. Tsk, tsk… Such an unexpected gift.”
