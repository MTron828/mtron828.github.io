Chapter 1706 - Benevolence!

Yang Ye wasn’t the only one who was curious about that, Qin Jian and Qin Youshui were the same.

It was clearly Yang Ye’s first visit here. Since it was his first time here, this situation didn’t really make sense.

What exactly is at the top of the mountain? Why does it refuse to let me ascend the mountain?

Yang Ye was about to continue up again. But Snowy suddenly appeared before him while holding the wooden sword.

Yang Ye gazed at Snowy. She flew over to his shoulder and pointed at the mountain top while excitement filled her eyes.

A treasure!

There’s a treasure on the top of the mountain!

Yang Ye had instantly understood Snowy. Because Snowy always revealed such an expression when they encountered treasures.

Meanwhile, Snowy suddenly flickered onto the wooden sword and pointed at the top of the mountain.

The wooden sword shook violently and was about to fly up. However, Yang Ye suddenly grabbed Snowy and held her in his arms. Snowy turned around to look at Yang Ye with a puzzled expression on her face. Yang Ye was about to speak when Snowy suddenly pointed at the mountain peak, and then she grabbed his hand with her other claw and pulled him towards the mountain peak.

Yang Ye pulled Snowy over to himself and said, “Why did I never notice that you’re so greedy for treasures?”

Snowy blinked, and then she rubbed her head against Yang Ye’s cheek. After that, she pointed at herself and pointed at Yang Ye. It was like she was saying that she was doing it for him.

Yang Ye admitted that he was quite moved by this.

However, he was slightly doubtful. He doubted what Snowy had said. Because since she started staying by his side, he noticed that she’d become quite mischievous.

Suddenly, Qin Youshui asked, “Is that your pet?” Her gaze was on Snowy, and there was undisguised fondness in her eyes.

Yang Ye shook his head as he’d never thought of Snowy as a pet.

Qin Youshui suddenly said, “Then how about giving her to me?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye hadn’t even said anything when Snowy hurriedly shook her head.

Qin Youshui was even more fond of Snowy when she saw that Snowy was so intelligent. She wanted to say something, but Qin Jian shook his head.

Qin Youshui glanced at Snowy and Yang Ye, and she didn’t say another word. How could she be unable to discern that Yang Ye and Snowy were very close? So, Yang Ye would definitely not give Snowy to her. However, she wasn’t willing to give up and wanted to try again.

Meanwhile, Snowy pointed at the mountain top and shot an eager gaze at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye rubbed her head and said, “Come! We’ll go up together!”

Snowy hurriedly nodded and was about to ride the wooden sword up there.

Yang Ye grabbed her and said, “Follow me, alright?”

Snowy blinked, and then she nodded. She flew over to Yang Ye’s shoulder, and the wooden sword floated not too far away from Yang Ye.

Yang Ye looked up at the mountain peak and fell silent for a few moments. After that, he started walking up the mountain again. He’d just taken a few steps when a sword howl suddenly resounded once more, and then a ray of sword energy shot down.

Yang Ye’s face turned gloomy at the sight of this. He was about to attack when Snowy suddenly waved her claw, and then the wooden sword transformed into a ray of light that shot up towards the mountain peak.

Boom!

The wooden sword instantly pierced through the sword energy, and the sword energy exploded into nothingness.

Meanwhile, ten rays of sword energy shot down from the mountain top. In an instant, they started descending towards Yang Ye like shooting stars.

Snowy blinked and was about to wave her claw. However, the wooden sword suddenly transformed into a ray of light that shot up into the air.

Snowy was stunned and gazed at Yang Ye. Her eyes were filled with bewilderment because she hadn’t waved her claw.

There was a trace of bewilderment in Yang Ye’s eyes. Why is it suddenly attacking on its own?

The wooden sword crisscrossed through the air, and it only took a moment for sword energy to fill the sky.

Qin Jian and Qin Youshui’s faces were instantly covered in a solemn expression. Because the wooden sword’s strength had completely exceeded their imagination.

Suddenly, the sword energy in the sky vanished, and then the wooden sword flew up to the top of the mountain.

Yang Ye gazed at Snowy. The latter blinked while bewilderment covered her face.

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment and said, “Let’s go!”

Once he finished speaking, he shot up the mountain while holding Snowy in his arms. This time, there was no sword energy, and even the sword intent didn’t appear to obstruct him.

Xiao Jian and his sister exchanged glances, and then they hurried after Yang Ye.

After Yang Ye’s group vanished, a man suddenly appeared where Yang Ye had been standing, and there was a sword and two short sabers hanging on his waist.

The man gazed at the direction Yang Ye had vanished towards, and he just gazed there for a long time before he said, “That head isn’t easy to take… However, it would be meaningless if it was easy.”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

…

On the mountain peak.

Yang Ye’s group arrived there with absolute ease. There was only a single palace here, and it was a luxurious palace.

They exchanged glances, and then Snowy took Yang Ye’s hand and pulled him forward. Qin Jian and his sister immediately followed Yang Ye.

Yang Ye and the others were stunned once they entered the palace.

The palace was actually filled with statues of a single woman. They were simply lifelike statues of her.

She looked to be less than 20 years of age. She had perfect features and silver hair.

Her figure was extremely slender. Especially her legs. Her legs weren’t covered by any clothes, so her slender and long legs were fully exposed.

Who is that? A wisp of bewilderment flashed through their eyes.

Suddenly, Snowy pointed towards the distance. Yang Ye turned to look, and he saw the wooden sword there. There was another sword not too far away from the wooden sword. The sword was snow white as if it was made of snow, but its hilt was green.

If one looked carefully, one would notice a few snow lotuses on it.

“The Green Lotus Sword!” Suddenly, Qin Youshui spoke, and her eyes carried a wisp of burning desire.

Yang Ye gazed at her, “The Green Lotus Sword?”

Qin Youshui glanced at Yang Ye and said, “The Sword Immortal’s sword. According to legend, it contains the Sword Immortal’s inheritance. Besides that, it’s a sword that surpasses the True Rank.”

It’s above the True Rank! Yang Ye gazed at it and sized up the sword. After that, he gazed at the wooden sword, “Which one of you two is stronger?”

The wooden sword shook violently, and then it floated towards the Green Lotus Sword.

The Green Lotus Sword actually started to move back in response!

It was afraid!

No, to be more precise, it was slightly terrified!

At this moment, Qin Jian and Qin Youshui’s expressions became solemn. They exchanged glances, and they saw shock in each other’s eyes.

What is that wooden sword? Even the Green Lotus Sword fears it!Yang Ye’s face remained calm. He wasn’t surprised at all. The wooden sword was something that could even harm the core of the Divine Yin Flame. But no matter how strong the Green Lotus Sword was, it could never compete with the Divine Yin Flame! Unfortunately, the wooden sword was too kindhearted and didn’t like him!

But it didn’t matter because he would corrupt it, sooner or later. At that time, it would become a sword of slaughter!

A sword of slaughter wasn’t terrifying, but it was terrifying when a good sword was transformed into one!

Suddenly, the Green Lotus Sword trembled slightly, and then a ray of light flashed. A man in a white robe appeared before them. The man had silver hair as well. He was handsome, and a wine gourd was hanging on his waist.

Li Taibai!

Obviously, he was the Sword Immortal, Li Taibai!

Qin Jian and Qin Youshui revealed profound respect on their faces!

Li Taibai glanced at Yang Ye’s group. In the end, his gaze descended onto Yang Ye. He frowned when he saw Yang Ye, “It’s you…”

Yang Ye frowned, “You recognize me?”

Li Taibai took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, “I see…”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was about to speak, but Li Taibai suddenly waved his right hand. Three scrolls descended respectively to Yang Ye, Qin Jian, and Qin Youshui. He said, “I know why all of you are here. That’s all the knowledge I’ve accumulated over the years. Take it!”

Yang Ye glanced at the scroll and asked, “You’re giving it to us just like that?”

Li Taibai replied with a question, “Then what do you expect?”

Yang Ye replied, “It’s a little too easy.”

Li Taibai gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and replied, “You’re vigilant towards everything. Your life is too tiring!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “A tiring life is better than having no life!”

Li Taibai grinned, “True. Allow me to explain. No matter who it is, the first to arrive here will obtain my inheritance. Your group was first, so all of you got it.”

Yang Ye said, “According to my knowledge, there was someone who arrived earlier than us, right?” He was speaking about the Unfettered One.

Li Taibai nodded slightly, “There was. But… You’ll understand in a moment.”

As he spoke, he gazed at the wooden sword by Snowy’s side. He immediately frowned when he saw it.

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “Senior, you recognize that sword?”

Li Taibai gazed at the wooden sword for a long time, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “What’s it doing with you?”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

Li Taibai replied, “You have such a strong desire to kill, and there’s viciousness on your face. That sword is a benevolent and kind sword, so it shouldn’t have chosen to follow you.”

Yang Ye’s face was completely dark. He’s trying to say I’m a bad person!

Meanwhile, Li Taibai added, “Forget it. It has nothing to do with me.”

He gazed at the Green Lotus Sword and continued, “It has a consciousness of its own, so it’ll choose its own master. Don’t force it if it doesn’t want to go with any one of you.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and walked a short distance. There was a crystal coffin there, and a woman was lying in it. It was the body of the woman in the statues here.

Li Taibai gazed at her for a long time, and then his gaze gradually became blank. At the same time, his figure gradually became ethereal. It didn’t take long for him to vanish completely.

The crystal coffin vanished with him.

Suddenly, the Green Lotus Sword trembled slightly, and then a green screen of light appeared not too far above them.

The scene within the screen was the foot of Phoenix Cry Mountain, the place Yang Ye and the others had been just a little while ago.

Yang Ye and the others were puzzled by this.

Suddenly, a man in a cloud white robe, who was holding a sword in his grasp, appeared within the screen.

There was a tiny ‘剑’ character which represented ‘sword’ embroidered on his left chest.

The Unfettered One!
