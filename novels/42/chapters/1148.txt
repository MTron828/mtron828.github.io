Chapter 1149 – Actually, I Don’t Want To Do This Too!

A trap!

All sorts of curses were flying through Ye Langxie’s mind. Yang Ye had only fought a Quasi Emperor to save his younger sister, but Yang Ye actually wanted him to kill an Emperor! Moreover, it was a guardian!

It wouldn’t be a problem if it was an ordinary Emperor. But that was a member of the guardians!

He naturally knew what that represented!

Even the Nether Pavilion didn’t dare to kill them!

Yang Ye said, “You can refuse if you think it’s difficult.”

Ye Langxie clenched his right fist slowly, but it didn’t take long for him to relax it. However, just a moment passed before he clenched it slowly again. A short while passed before he looked up at Yang Ye, “My Ye Clan owes you a life, so I’ll kill an Emperor for you today!”

“Kill an Emperor?” Meanwhile, the gold armored middle aged man on the left suddenly gazed at Ye Langxie, “You’re an extraordinary genius with a limitless future. So why court death? You’re a genius of my Radiant Dimension, and I cherish geniuses. I’ll allow you to live if you leave right now. If you insist on being stubborn, then you’ll die in a while!”

Suddenly, Yang Ye looked up at the middle aged man and said, “I’m a genius of the Radiant Dimension as well. Can you let me go as well?”

“You?” The middle aged man’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye, and he said, “I don’t know what you’ve done in the past, but you forced the Eye of the Heaven Dao to sacrifice itself in order to brand you with a blood sentence. I presume you’ve definitely done something that incurs the indignation of all. Not only do you have to die today, everyone related to you has to die as well!”

Xiao Bieli and the others’ faces fell when they heard the man. Because they realized that they intended to kill everyone related to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s face had turned gloomy as well, and he slowly grabbed Sword Precursor’s hilt with his right hand while the profound energy and stellar energy within him started circulating.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man gazed at the pig-riding young woman and the others, “The Nether Pavilion?”

She glanced at the middle aged man, ignored him, and then gazed at Nether Maiden, “Let’s go. Our Nether Pavilion can’t interfere in this matter.”

The middle aged man’s face fell from being ignored, and he said, “I presume your Nether Pavilion wouldn’t dare to interfere. After all, that Resentment Maiden....”

The pig-riding young woman’s face instantly became gloomy when she heard him, and she looked up at him and spoke fiercely, “Mention her again and I’ll kill you right now!”

Nether Maiden and Oblivion Maiden’s faces were gloomy as well.

The middle aged man’s eyes narrowed. He was about to speak when the middle aged man by his side who had a crescent shaped scar on his face suddenly stopped him. The middle aged man with the crescent scar gazed at the pig-riding young woman and said, “That incident has passed. It’s pointless to discuss it further. We aren’t here for the Nether Pavilion, and we’re just here for the one branded with the blood sentence. So, all of you can leave!”

The pig-riding young woman glanced coldly at the other middle aged man and said, “You should realize that we didn’t make a compromise all those years ago because we were afraid of you. Besides that, remember that enmity of the past. One day, we’ll make you pay with your blood!”

“How laughable!” The middle aged man laughed coldly, “Your Nether Pavilion?”

Suddenly, the pig-riding young woman shot up into the sky and arrived not too far away from the middle aged man in golden armor, “Cut the crap. You can choose any one of us to fight you in single combat. All 4 of us will take our own lives if you aren’t dead within 100 moves. Conversely, you can take your own life if your opponent is still alive after 100 moves are over. Do you dare?”

The middle aged man’s eyes narrowed slightly. He was about to say something when he was stopped again by the crescent scarred middle aged man, “Every single hall master of the Nether Pavilion possesses extraordinary ability, and we guardians have no intention to look down upon your pavilion. Allow me to repeat myself again. We aren’t here for the Nether Pavilion; we’re here for the one branded with the blood sentence. I presume that you don’t want to give rise to unnecessary problems for your Nether Pavilion, right?”

The pig-riding young woman glanced coldly at the middle aged man and said, “You’re just a piece of trash that’s running the errands. I really don’t know where you’re getting that sense of superiority from!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and left. Meanwhile, the middle aged man suddenly spoke fiercely, “Bitch! What did you say!?”

He really was an errand boy amongst the guardians, and that was exactly why he wasn’t able to endure what she’d said!

As soon as he spoke, the pig-riding young woman suddenly slammed her spiked club down, and a terrifying aura enveloped the middle aged man.

The middle aged man’s expression changed, and he immediately stabbed his spear forward.

Bang!

The middle aged man was blasted around 3km away!

The scarred middle aged man’s expression changed. He was about to attack when Oblivion Maiden suddenly appeared in front of him. He was slightly stunned and was about to attack, but Oblivion Maiden suddenly shouted, “Return to Zero!”

As soon as she spoke, Oblivion Maiden looked straight at the scarred man. The space around the scarred man actually started to decompose, and it wasn’t just the space there, even the scarred man’s armor had started to tremble and decompose.

The scarred man’s expression changed drastically, and he tossed his spear forward. The spear tore through space and emanated a golden glow as it instantly appeared before Oblivion Maiden.

Meanwhile, Oblivion Maiden tapped her finger on the spar. The golden glow around the spear instantly melted like snow in hot oil. It only took an instant for the golden glow to dispersed before the spear started to decompose under the astounded gaze of the scarred middle aged man!

He was shocked!

He didn’t dare act carelessly in the slightest, and a terrifying aura surged out from within him. Countless rays of golden light enveloped him in layers that obstructed Oblivion Maiden’s mysterious ability to decompose matter!

Meanwhile, the other middle aged man was being pushed back repeatedly under the frenzied attacks of the pig-riding young woman. He was completely suppressed and hadn’t possessed the slightest ability to fight back throughout the battle!

Yang Ye had intended to join the battle when he saw them attack. After all, he wasn’t someone who would miss such an opportunity. However, Nether Maiden obstructed his path, “Flee!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Yang Ye replied, “We can kill them!”

Even though they were Emperors, it would be absolutely easy to kill them if he joined forces with the 3 of them.

Nether Maiden said, “They won’t kill those fellows!”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he came to an understanding. They were buying time for him.

Could he flee? He naturally could. Even Emperors couldn’t find him if he concealed himself.

However, what about White Deer Academy?

If he fled, the guardians would definitely vent on White Deer Academy. How could the academy endure their rage?

Yang Ye took a deep breath and shook his head.

Nether Maiden glanced at him with a complicated expression on her face and remained silent. Meanwhile, Oblivion Maiden and the pig-riding young woman stopped attacking and moved aside.

The middle aged men immediately heaved sighs of relief, and they felt beyond astounded in their hearts. The 1st middle aged man’s spear had already been warped into a piece of scrap while more than half the armor on the scarred middle aged man had vanished.

The pig-riding young woman paid no attention to the middle aged men, and she gazed at Yang Ye instead, “You act like a man!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she gazed at Nether Maiden, “Let’s go. Don’t drag down our other sisters by staying here. If it was your own business, we would help you even if we have to face 100 of them. But this isn’t your own business!”

Nether Maiden fell silent.

Yang Ye gazed at Nether Maiden, “I’ll deal with my own business. If it’s possible, I mean if I die, then help me take care of the others in White Deer Academy and Pine Prefecture.”

“I’ll agree to that!” Meanwhile, the pig-riding young woman spoke abruptly, and then she looked up at the 2 middle aged Emperors in the sky, “Yang Ye has been branded by a blood sentence, but the members of White Deer Academy aren’t. Moreover, they weren’t aware of it. So, it isn’t related to them. Don’t you think so too?”

Their expressions turned quite unsightly because she was clearly threatening them!

A short while passed before the scarred man said, “Of course!”

The pig-riding young woman withdrew her gaze and gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Thank you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he gazed at Ye Langxie and said, “I’ve changed my mind. I’ll deal with them. However, I hope that you can help White Deer Academy if it faces any trouble in the future!”

Ye Langxie spoke seriously, “I can help you kill one of them!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’ll do it myself!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s figure vanished on the spot. After all, White Deer Dimension would definitely be destroyed if he fought them here.

The Emperors in the sky instantly vanished as well.

Ye Langxie hesitated for a moment before following them. Nether Maiden followed them as well, but she was stopped by Oblivion Maiden and the pig-riding young woman.

Nether Maiden explained, “I won’t help him. I’m just going to watch. Don’t both of you want to witness his true strength?”

The pig-riding young woman gazed at her for a short while before speaking, “Let’s go watch then!”

The 3 of them immediately vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

...

On a wasteland that was uninhabited for hundreds of thousands of kilometers in all directions.

Yang Ye stood on the ground while the 2 Emperors were not too far away in the sky above.

Yang Ye gazed at them and said, “It’s impossible for any reconciliation to occur, right?”

The middle aged man spoke coldly, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye nodded slightly and said, “Actually, I’m saying that out of consideration for both of you.”

“Is that so?” There was ridicule on the corners of the middle aged man’s mouth, “Bring it! There’s no need to think about us. Feel free to show us your true strength.”

Bang!

A ray of stellar energy descended from the sky and instantly entered Yang Ye’s body, causing his figure to immediately turn crystal blue.

At the same time, Void Rank slaughter intent and sword intent surged out from within him.

A moment later, Yang Ye took Sword Precursor’s hilt in his grasp as he looked up at them, “Actually, I don’t want to do this too!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye drew his sword.

Om!

A sword howl shot up into the sky, and then the space in an area of a few hundred thousand kilometers collapsed in an instant.

A beam of violet sword energy shot into the sky.

It tore the heavens and the earth apart!
