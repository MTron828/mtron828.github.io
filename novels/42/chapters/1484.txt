Chapter 1485 - You’re Worse Than A Dog!

Translator: InVader

Yang Ye was truly furious this time.

He’d fought with his life on the line with the hopes that she could recover sooner. So long as she recovered, she could help him. In that way, the danger they faced would naturally be resolved. However, he hadn’t expected her to have recovered yet sat there and watched him being bashed up!

After all, he’d almost died just now!

In his rage, Yang Ye completely disregarded the fact that she was a Dualism Realm expert, and he just slammed the casket lid at her.

At this moment, it was naturally impossible for him to be a match for her.

Bang!

A muffled explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was blasted flying. He flew over 1km away before his figure finally smashed against the ground, causing it to shake violently.

Yang Ye had just gotten up from the ground when Lian Banzhuang appeared in front of him, and then she looked him in the eyes and asked, “Do you want to die?”

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and then he gazed at her and laughed with ridicule, “I, Yang Ye, am a selfish person, but I have limits. If I join forces with someone, then so long as that person doesn’t turn on me, I will absolutely not stab that person in the back.”

His expression became quite fierce at this point, “The thing I fucking regret the most after arriving here is saving you just now. Saving a dog is better than saving you. At least a dog would wag its tail at me with gratitude, but what about you? You’re worse than a dog!”

Bang!

As soon as he finished speaking, a mouthful of blood sprayed out from him, and his figure flew backwards.

It was naturally Lian Banzhuang who’d attacked him.

“Do you think I wouldn’t kill you?” Lian Banzhuang gazed at Yang Ye while an icy cold expression covered her face.

Yang Ye crawled up from the ground. At this moment, he looked quite terrible indeed. His body and internal organs had cracked apart in the battle with Demon Wu, and it was especially so for his hands. Even the bones in his hands could be seen clearly. Now that he suffered two attacks from Lian Banzhuang, it caused his injuries to grow even more severe.

If he was an ordinary person, such heavy injuries would have definitely resulted in his death by now. Only he who possessed Primordial Violet Energy and an extremely strong physical body was capable of holding on until now!

Once he stood up, a sword appeared in Yang Ye’s grasp. It was the Sword Precursor, of course.

He held the Sword Precursor as he looked at Lian Banzhuang, “Woman! I was blind to have saved you. I don’t blame anyone or you. I only blame myself for being blind. I don’t want to do anything now, nor do I have the ability to. From this moment onward, you go your way, and I’ll go mine. If you insist on killing me… Remember that attack from before? Even if I can’t kill you, I can still cripple you.”

“Are you threatening me?” Lian Banzhuang’s eyes narrowed slightly, and her eyes were icy cold and filled with killing intent.

“I’m fucking threatening you!” Yang Ye pointed his sword at her, “If you don’t like it, then come at me. We’ll fight until both of us are cripples. Why don’t you fucking try me and see if I’m afraid of you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the remaining profound energy in him started to circulate madly. At the same time, his sword intent and slaughter intent surged out from within him. After that, they entered the Sword Precursor. Besides that, the Sword God’s Seal on his forehead had lit up, and it made his sword intent even stronger and sharper.

Lian Banzhuang clenched her fists and stared fixedly at Yang Ye. She didn’t speak, nor did she attack!

A wisp of ferocity curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “As I said before, I was blind to have saved you. I don’t blame anyone for that. Now, you go on your way, and I’ll go on mine. We’ll stay out of each other’s business.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye started walking towards the distance.

Meanwhile, Lian Banzhuang’s voice came from behind him, “You won’t live long here!”

Yang Ye stopped and ridiculed, “I’m afraid I’d die even quicker if I stay with you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished into the distance.

Lian Banzhuang watched him vanish, and she remained silent. No one knew what she was thinking.

…

After he left her, Yang Ye casually found a place to hide himself. After that, he withdrew divine crystals and started absorbing the energy within them. His injuries were absolutely severe, and they had to be repaired. Otherwise, it would be just as Lian Banzhuang had said, he wouldn’t be able to survive here at all. Of course, even if his injuries were healed, it would still be difficult for him to survive here. But at the very least, it wouldn’t be to the extent that he couldn’t survive at all.

With the casket lid in his possession, even if he encountered a Dualism Realm expert, it wouldn’t be too difficult for him to retreat safely if that Dualism Realm expert wasn’t determined to fight him to the death.

Splitting up with Lian Banzhuang could be considered to be rash, but he didn’t regret it at all. Actually, even if she didn’t choose to marry him, he felt that she would feel grateful after he saved her! However, the facts proved that he was wrong!

Actually, it was very normal. Not everyone in the world could be called a person. Some people would treat everything you do for them as something you should do, and they would never feel any gratitude. Moreover, some strange fellows would even ask you to do more.

Yang Ye treated this incident as a life lesson!

As spirit energy entered his body, it started to become more active, and countless strands of Primordial Violet Energy seeped out incessantly from within the tiny vortex. In the end, all of it entered his entire body and repaired his body that was on the verge of being destroyed.

At this moment, his body really was on the verge of destruction. Fortunately, he had Primordial Violet Energy. So long as he wasn’t killed in an instant, Primordial Violet Energy could heal him.

His injuries were very severe this time. Yang Ye spent almost six hours healing before his body was fully healed.

Once his body was healed, Yang Ye didn’t leave right away. He sat down cross-legged, and then he recalled the battle between him and Demon Wu. Every single battle could help him improve and understand many things. Especially a battle with a Dualism Realm expert. He intended to analyze the previous battle, and then analyze his own strengths and weaknesses.

The energy of Yin and Yang!

Demon Wu had utilized the energy of Yin and Yang in the battle with him. He didn’t know anything about the energy of Yin and Yang, but he knew that it was very strong. If he didn’t possess the casket lid, he wouldn’t have been a match for Demon Wu at all. Even if he had the casket lid, he was completely suppressed once Demon Wu fought him seriously!

His body’s realm of cultivation had improved, and he’s learned the Rebirth Sword. However, the gap between him and a Dualism Realm expert was still extremely huge.

However, there wasn’t much of a gap between him and a Deity. Or it should be said that Deities were no threat to him at all.

Two hours later, Yang Ye opened his eyes and stood up.

He’d fully absorbed the experience he gained during the battle with Demon Wu. If he were to fight Demon Wu again, he wouldn’t fall into such an embarrassing situation again. If it was possible, he really wanted to find Demon Wu and have another battle. However, he wouldn’t court death. Demon Wu definitely hated him to the bone, so Demon Wu would definitely fight him to the death if he went looking for Demon Wu!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and there was a lost expression in his eyes. Where should I go now?

Little Sky! Suddenly, Yang Ye thought of Little Sky. Because she’d said that she seemed to have been here before!

Yang Ye immersed his mind into his body, and then his clone found Little Sky who was traveling the world within the Primordial Pagoda. It didn’t take long for her to accept his request to come out from the Primordial Pagoda. The reason it was called a request was that she really didn’t like to leave the Primordial Pagoda. She seemed to really hate the outside world. So, she was really unwilling to leave.

However, she still did after Yang Ye implored her to.

Once she left the Primordial Pagoda, she glanced at the surroundings and spoke softly, “It really is so familiar. This aura and everything here…”

Yang Ye was delighted when he heard this. Obviously, Little Sky had definitely been here in the past. But it made him wonder how she’d left after coming to this place!

Yang Ye said, “You’ve definitely been here in the past!”

Little Sky nodded, “It seems so!”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “Then how did you leave this place?”

“Leave?” She frowned, thought for a moment, and then shook her head, “I don’t know!”

Yang Ye walked over to her and spoke very seriously, “Little Sky, you must remember. Otherwise, I’ll die.”

Little Sky was puzzled, “Why would you die if I can’t remember?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “See? I only have around two months to live. If I can’t leave this place and find the Spring of Life, I will die. Understand?”

She sized up Yang Ye and said, “Everyone dies. Isn’t that very normal?”

Yang Ye’s face darkened, “You want me to die that badly?”

She chuckled, “Not at all. Life, death, sickness, and age are very normal things.”

Yang Ye stated, “If I die, then you can’t stay in that world anymore!”

Little Sky blinked when she heard this, and then she said, “I remember how to leave!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

“There’s a door!” She continued, “I remember a door. I seem to have left through that door.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“A door?” Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “Where is it?”

Little Sky patted her forehead, “Let me think for a moment.”

A short while passed before her eyes suddenly lit up. Yang Ye was delighted by the sight of this, and he hurriedly asked, “You remember now?”

She blinked, “Nope!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Little Sky added, “Actually, you can leave this place on your own!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

“Shatter the space here!” She continued, “You can break open the space here by force, and then leave this place.”

Yang Ye smiled bitterly, “I can’t!”

The space here was horrifyingly strong. Even the battle between two Dualism Realm experts hadn’t been able to damage the space here, so how could he possibly break it open?

Perhaps he could give it a try if he raised his sword intent to the Returnal Rank and activated the Stellar Sword Diagram. But could he use the Stellar Sword Diagram?

He couldn’t, of course!

If he used it again, it would be equivalent to killing himself!

Little Sky sized up Yang Ye and said, “Right, that’s true. Let me think a little longer!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

A long time passed before Little Sky suddenly turned to look towards the distance, “It seems to be in that way.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Let’s go!”

Meanwhile, Little Sky suddenly took his hand and gazed at him, “You’ll die if you go there! You’ll really die!”

Yang Ye didn’t know what to say.
