Chapter 2714 – The Battle Begins!

Yang Ye casually tossed the head to the ground and looked up. At this moment, strands of stellar energy were converging incessantly above him. It wasn’t just up there, countless formations had been activated below him!

Formations!

The End World clearly planned to kill him with Formations. Even if they couldn’t kill him, they wanted to trap him with them!

Yang Ye naturally understood that!

He gazed at Snowy, and she nodded slightly. She looked up while the Sprite Staff appeared in her grasp!

She raised it and waved it gently.

Just like that, the sky shook violently, and then countless experts watched with shock as the formations started to collapse!

It wasn’t just up there, the formations down below started to collapse as well!

The experts throughout the End World were stunned!

What the heck?

Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “Snowy, can you make the formations attack them instead?”

Snowy blinked, and then she looked up at the sky. A moment later, she waved her paws swiftly.

The formations started to circulate under Snowy’s control, but they weren’t circulating normally. They were in chaos!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. His intuition told him that something was off!

However, Snowy grew increasingly excited as she played with the formations!

A short while later, the formations grew increasingly chaotic, or it should be said that the spirit energy within them was chaotic.

No matter what formation it was, they required spirit energy to be sustained. But what was Snowy good at? Managing spirit energy! Since she controlled spirit energy, to a certain extent, she controlled the formations too!

But did Snowy know how to use formations?

No, she didn’t!

She didn’t understand them at all, and she was just controlling them randomly! Of course, others thought that she was serious!

Even Yang Ye felt that Snowy was really controlling them in the beginning!

But it didn’t take long for him to realize that Snowy was just controlling them randomly!

Yang Ye was about to ask Snowy about it when she suddenly lowered the Sprite Staff!

Boom!

In an instant, the formations in the sky exploded apart, and even the formations below them exploded!

The powerful impact from the explosion instantly swept out to the surroundings!

Yang Ye’s face changed drastically while Snowy was quite stunned as well. She gazed at Yang Ye, and Yang Ye immediately grabbed her and fled.

Yang Ye wasn’t the only one, the others throughout the End World started fleeing madly!

The huge explosion Snowy created wasn’t just a detonation of the formations, there were countless strands of spirit energy there to support the explosions. Otherwise, if it had been just the formations alone, they would have been able to resist the explosions and even suppress it!

However, if the explosions were supported by spirit energy, then the force of the explosions was too terrifying!

Everyone fled, including Yang Ye.

It didn’t take long for the End World to start being obliterated inch by inch. This time, it wasn’t just the End World that was being destroyed, even the End Dimension was affected!

Yang Ye held Snowy far away in outer space and gazed at the End World that was a pitch black hole now! He felt a sense of lingering fear!

If he hadn’t fled in time and allowed himself to be struck by the force of the explosion, then even if he survived, he would have suffered severe injuries!

Snowy had an innocent expression on her face as she sat there in Yang Ye’s arms and looked off into the distance.

Yang Ye glanced at Snowy and shook his head. The little fellow didn’t seem to have any idea what danger was!Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

What was danger?

What was it?

Snowy was just too oblivious!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, rubbed Snowy’s head gently, and looked into the distance. A moment later, he grinned.

A sword howl resounded!

Kill!

He was naturally not here to have fun, he was here to kill.

He knew that it was very risky and impulsive, but being hunted for so long was too aggrieving!

A ray of sword energy surged through space while frequently leaving shrill cries in its wake!

Yang Ye was hunting them down!

A ray of sword energy flashed.

The body of a Destiny Realm expert exploded apart behind it!

The sword energy dispersed to reveal Yang Ye’s figure. Yang Ye stopped attacking. He just looked to the side, and a group appeared there.

It was Heng Wangu’s group!

Heng Wangu was in the lead.

Yang Ye saw more than Heng Wangu, he saw Mo Yu, Zuo Mu, First God, and the middle aged man who’d pursued him into the spatial passageway.

The middle aged man was Emperor Li!

Heng Wangu glanced at the End World and spoke softly, “I didn’t expect you to come as soon as we rebuilt it. Haha… We’re really such failures!”

He gazed at Yang Ye’s stomach, “Moreover, we’re absolute fools. We know you have the Good Sprite, yet we actually tried to use formations against you! How foolish of us!”

Snowy!

The entire End World had overlooked the little fellow because they felt that she was just a cute little fellow who was completely harmless!

That was why the End World had overlooked her!

However, at this moment, they realized that the little fellow may be more terrifying than Yang Ye!

Heng Wangu restrained his thoughts and gazed at Yang Ye, “Since you dared to come here, you should have other trump cards besides that woman, right?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Go figure?”

Heng Wangu shook his head and smiled, “Why should I? However, no matter what you have up your sleeves, you’re not leaving here today.”

He glanced at the others by his side, “Attack together.”

Attack together!

He was very well aware that no one could easily defeat Yang Ye on their own. Especially when that woman was by his side. Their joint forces were even able to defeat Emperor Li!

Mo Yu and the others didn’t refuse. They were about to attack when a ray of sword energy shot over.

Heng Wangu’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he looked over. An old man was flying over on his sword, and there was a beautiful woman in a plain robe behind him.

Jian Wudi!

Heng Wangu’s face instantly turned gloomy at the sight of Jian Wudi.

Jian Wudi descended by Yang Ye’s side, and the woman by his side was curiously sizing up Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at Jian Wudi, “Martial Ancestor.”

Yang Ye had naturally notified Jian Wudi to come here. Since they were going to fight a group battle, he naturally had to summon everyone!

Jian Wudi glanced at Yang Ye and nodded slightly, “You’re much stronger than before! Looks like you had a fortuitous encounter again!”

Yang Ye smiled, and then he gazed at the woman by Jian Wudi’s side, “And this senior is?”

She grinned, “I’m a good friend of your Martial Ancestor’s, you can call me Qing Xuan.”

Yang Ye hurriedly bowed, “Senior Qing Xuan!”

She glanced at Jian Wudi and smiled, “He’s much more sly than that disciple of yours!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Jian Wudi glared at Yang Ye and said, “Are you confident?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m just giving it my all!”

Jian Wudi nodded slightly and gazed at Heng Wangu’s group. The latter smiled, “Looks like there’s no need for me to say anything.”

He gazed at Emperor Li, “Brother Li, I’ll leave him to you, alright?”

Emperor Li glanced at Jian Wudi and replied indifferently, “Alright!”

He shot up into the air.

Heng Wangu gazed at Jian Wudi with a grin on his face, “Please go on ahead!”

Jian Wudi didn’t say anything and just shot off after Emperor Li.

Heng Wangu gazed at Qing Xuan, “And you are?”

Qing Xuan smiled, “Just send any one of them to fight me.”

Heng Wangu gazed at First God, and the latter spoke indifferently, “Leave her to me.”

He vanished on the spot with Qing Xuan.

Mo Yu, Zuo Mu, Sky Saber, two other middle aged men, a woman in palace clothes, and an old man were still by Heng Wangu’s side.

All of them were peak Destiny Realm experts!

Besides that, there were almost 20 Destiny Realm experts in the surroundings!

At least 80% of all the Destiny Realm experts in the universe were here.

Practically all the elites of the End World were here.

Heng Wangu gazed at Yang Ye and smiled, “Shall we?”

Yang Ye cracked a smile and nodded, and then he said, “I’m counting on all of you.”

Heng Wangu’s eyes narrowed slightly.

A short while later, numerous auras surged down from the sky, and then experts appeared in succession behind Yang Ye!

They were led by the Past Life Clan and Martial Sky Clan’s patriarch, and the Yang Clan’s Grand Elder. Each of them had brought two other Destiny Realm experts with them. So there were 9 Destiny Realm experts from the three clans, and five of them were peak Destiny Realm experts!

Besides that, Cang Mu and Sha Ji were here.

Heng Wangu’s side clearly had an advantage in both numbers and quality, but the gap wasn’t very huge. They had the strength to fight, at least.

Heng Wangu glanced at the experts behind Yang Ye and smiled, “No wonder, no wonder!”

Yang Ye glanced at Heng Wangu, “Kill them! It’s best if you can kill them all!”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Zuo Mu suddenly stepped forward. However, a figure flashed out of Yang Ye! It was An Nanjing!

An Nanjing locked onto Zuo Mu, and her spear shot straight for him!

Zuo Mu frowned slightly and swung his saber!

Bang!

An Nanjing and Zuo Mu instantly split apart, and they were pushed around 1km back each!

A moment later, An Nanjing charged forward again.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had appeared before Heng Wangu. The latter gazed indifferently at Yang Ye, and he tapped his right index and middle fingers forward when Yang Ye’s sword descended at him!

It tapped right against the top of Yang Ye’s sword.

Yang Ye’s sword shook violently, and Yang Ye was blasted 300m back!

Meanwhile, Heng Wangu remained on the spot.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He felt that he’d underestimated Heng Wangu a little.

Heng Wangu placed his left hand behind his back and walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, “Your sword is very strong, and so are you! Come, let us continue!”
