Chapter 1472 – Ruthlessness Is The Way!

The giant moved farther and farther back, and it was moving quicker and quicker. It didn’t take long for the giant to have moved around 3km back, and it was far away from the river.

It gazed at the river for a long time, and then it turned around and left.

What about Yang Ye?

Yang Ye was still speeding up.

Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye had stopped. At this moment, he noticed that the giant hadn’t followed him here.

Yang Ye frowned on the spot. Has it really fallen into the river?

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a while, and then he shook his head and decided to pay no further attention to the giant. He would naturally not turn back and have a look. After all, he would be courting death if he turned around and encountered the giant.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. At this moment, he couldn’t differentiate between north, south, east, or west.

Because he’d been leading the giant all over the place, and as he ran and ran, he’d lost his sense of direction.

However, as far as he was concerned, this place didn’t seem to be dangerous!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he continued forward.

The miasma wasn’t very dense here. It was thin and scarce like smoke, and it didn’t really affect his vision. He could see everything within an area of 3km around him, but his vision farther than that was quite blurry.

Fortunately, it was much better than the parts of the Ominous Territory that he’d previously passed through!

All along the way, Yang Ye sized up the surroundings incessantly. Presently, he intended to figure out where he was. He wasn’t here to just go around randomly; his objective was the Forest of Darkness.

As he walked and walked, Yang Ye felt like something was off.

It was quiet!

It was extremely quiet all along the way, and there was no vitality in it. It was different from the quiet atmosphere in the forest from before. That forest was quiet, but it had vitality. However, this place felt like it was frozen. It wasn’t just quiet; it didn’t have a shred of vitality. Many people may not understand such a vague concept like vitality, but if someone went to a cemetery late at night, then it would be easy to understand.

Something is off! Yang Ye frowned while a bad feeling arose in his heart. Moreover, it was growing stronger as he went deeper into this area.

Experts at his level of cultivation possessed a certain level of ability to sense danger.

Once the feeling of danger grew stronger and stronger, Yang Ye couldn’t help but stop. Because he hadn’t had such a feeling even when he encountered the towering giant!

So, an extremely dangerous existence was definitely up ahead!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and was about to retreat. Because he felt that he couldn’t continue forward in this direction. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Suddenly, a middle aged man in a luxurious robe suddenly appeared around 3m away from Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was stunned because the middle aged man’s arrival was too abrupt. There had been no signs of his arrival, and he’d just appeared out of thin air in front of Yang Ye!

In an instant, the profound energy within Yang Ye started to surge. At the same time that he became vigilant, he was sizing up the middle aged man. The middle aged man seemed to be around the age of 30 or 40. Of course, Yang Ye definitely didn’t think that it was the middle aged man’s true age. Once strength arrived at a certain level, one could maintain one’s appearance at any point in a person’s life.

The middle aged man wore a luxurious robe, wore a cloth around his forehead, and held a scripture in his grasp. Based on his outward appearance, he looked like a scholar. He seemed refined, pleasant, and harmless.

However, Yang Ye would absolutely not think that way. Someone in such a place would definitely not be a kind person!

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye for quite some time, and then he said, “It has been so many years since someone came here. I never expected someone to come here today, and it’s even a Voider. It’s quite interesting indeed.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand, and a Go board appeared before him. At the same time, two stone benches appeared.

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What’s all of this?”

The middle aged man gestured at the Go board, “Come, let’s play.” He sat down once he finished speaking.

“Play Go?” Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t really know how.”

He knew a little about it, and it was something his mother had taught him when he was young. At that time, he would play with Little Yao when they were bored. However, he hadn’t even learned the basics of it.

“It’s fine!” The middle aged man smiled, “Everyone starts a beginner, and so did I. Your desire to kill is too strong, and the viciousness within you is too powerful. You need to calm your heart.”

Yang Ye sized up the man, and then he sat down. The middle aged man grinned when he saw Yang Ye sit down, and he said, “The guest always goes first!”

Yang Ye didn’t refuse. He picked up a black piece and placed it at the center of the board.

A wisp of surprise flashed through the middle aged man’s eyes when he saw Yang Ye’s move. He looked up and shot a glance at Yang Ye, “Starting at the center without any intent to strategize. You want to fight right away.... It’s understandable for the young to be so aggressive.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he raised a white piece and placed it on the board.

Yang Ye played just like how he did things. He didn’t beat around the bust, and he immediately attacked from the beginning.

He intended to take the middle aged man down with him!

Of course, Yang Ye was at a complete disadvantage. But he didn’t care.

Yang Ye picked up a piece and placed it on the board before he asked, “Senior, can I ask you something?”

The middle aged man replied, “Go on!”

Yang Ye glanced at the middle aged man. Needless to say, it was very easy to speak with the middle aged man. He thought for a moment and said, “My objective is the Forest of Darkness. But I encountered a huge fellow, and I accidentally got lost while being chased by him. So, I’d like to ask how I can get to the Forest of Darkness!”

“You’re lost?” The middle aged man who was about to place a piece of the board had stopped immediately. He gazed at Yang Ye and said, “You came here because you got lost?”

Yang Ye nodded.

“No wonder!” The middle aged man nodded slightly, and then he sized up Yang Ye, “Insufficient lifespan.... You’re heading there for the Spring of Life?”

Yang Ye didn’t conceal his objective, “Yes!”

The middle aged man placed the piece on the board and said, “That thing can keep you alive. Based on your natural talent and strength, your lifespan won’t be a problem once you get it to increase your lifespan. But why did you get lost?”

Yang Ye asked, “What do you mean?”

The middle aged man shook his head slightly, “It’s nothing. Come, let’s continue. If you still want to know the answer once we’re done, then I’ll tell you how to get to the Forest of Darkness.”

Yang Ye asked, “Really?”

The middle aged man smiled, “I promise!”

“Alright, let’s continue!” Yang Ye nodded, and then he picked up a piece and placed it on the board. The middle aged man instantly lost five pieces because of this move.

However, the middle aged man shook his head, and then he picked up a piece and placed it on the board. As soon as he did that, Yang Ye’s expression became quite unsightly because he’d instantly lost 15 pieces!

Meanwhile, the middle aged man said, “Based on how you play, you’re definitely someone who disregards the consequences of your actions. Even though it allows you to vent your anger, you’re unable to endure the consequences that follow. It’s not wrong to be young and arrogant, but you must know your limits, and you must know when to exercise forbearance or accept defeat. The way of neutrality is to be able to advance, retreat, and exercise forbearance.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Senior, we’re like two armies at war. If I take a step back and exercise forbearance, what would I get in return? Would you show mercy? No, you wouldn’t. You would seize the opportunity to destroy me. You don’t deny that, right?”

The middle aged man remained silent.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “There are many situations where taking a step back or exercising forbearance will only make your enemy take advantage of the situation. Since the moment we started this game, I knew that you wouldn’t hold back against me, and I knew very well that my ability was definitely insufficient to be a match for you. So, what do you think I should do in a situation like that?”

Yang Ye chuckled and continued, “I chose to try and take you down with me. If you want to kill me, then even if I can’t defeat you, I’ll still make you suffer.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye picked up another piece and placed it on the board, and then the middle aged man lost three more pieces.

The middle aged man glanced at Yang Ye. He didn’t speak a word, and he just raised a piece and placed it on the board. Yang Ye immediately lost over a dozen pieces.

However, Yang Ye didn’t care and just continued.

He played like how he lived his life, he never regretted his decisions. Yang Ye knew his character well, and he knew it was very easy for him to get into trouble. Moreover, it was very easy for him to bring calamity down upon himself. However, he was very well aware that ruthlessness was the only way to gain a foothold in this world!

Many had a bad habit, and it was their fondness of bullying the weak and fearing the strong. So, never be the weak, and never exercise forbearance. Because that would only give you a life of aggrievance.

If you’re dissatisfied, then fight; if you fight, then fight until the end!

That was Yang Ye’s attitude towards life!

Both of them ceaselessly picked up pieces and placed them down. Yang Ye’s pieces were gradually reducing in number. Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye had no place to put down the piece he’d raised.

Because the entire board was covered in black pieces.

At this moment, the middle aged man said, “You’ve lost.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I have lost this game.”

The middle aged man suddenly looked Yang Ye in the eyes and said, “This isn’t a Go board but your life. You’ve lost your life.”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he looked up at the middle aged man, “My life?”

The middle aged man nodded, “Your life.”

Suddenly, Yang Ye drew his sword and swung it.

Bang!

The board before him shattered in an instant.

Yang Ye sheathed his sword again, and then he looked the middle aged man in the eyes, “What about now?”
