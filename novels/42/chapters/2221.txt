Chapter 2222 – I’ll Kill Them All!

Yang Ye followed the Universe Sprite into the starry sky. All along the way, she remained silent and just continued forward.

Yang Ye had asked her many questions, but she refused to answer!

Finally, she stopped.

Yang Ye walked over to her side and glanced at the surroundings, but only an endless starry sky was within his view. Besides that, there was nothing out of the ordinary here!

Yang Ye gazed at the Universe Sprite and was about to speak when she suddenly waved her hands. In an instant, a strand of mysterious energy appeared in the surroundings, and then the area before him suddenly started to transform.

A short while later, the surroundings suddenly changed.

It was a vast continent that simply stretched far beyond his vision.

There was an extremely striking tree around 10km before Yang Ye. It was extremely tall, and occupied a huge area.

It simply blotted out the sky!

Even the sky had been covered by it!

A scene of desolation laid around it.

The Universe Sprite asked softly, “Do you know what this is?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

The Universe Sprite explained, “It’s the Bodhi Tree, and it’s ranked the third amongst all the natural divine treasures of this large universe.”

The Bodhi Tree!

Yang Ye was shocked. He naturally knew about the Bodhi Tree. According to legend, it could allow one to attain the Progenitor Realm. Some time ago, the god race had revealed a fake Bodhi Tree so that the other races would lose many Sages!

After that, he hadn’t heard any other news about the Bodhi Tree’s location.

Yet now, he’d seen it before him!

Yang Ye said, “You want me to use it to attain the Progenitor Realm?”

She shook her head slightly, “No, while you’re at the Sage Realm right now, it isn’t really realistic for you to attain the Progenitor Realm right now. It isn’t a realm that’s so easily attained.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Then why?”

She explained, “It’s very difficult to attain the Progenitor Realm, but it’s possible for you to advance a step further. If you advance a step further at your current level of strength, your strength will definitely multiply, right?”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “But it’s obviously impossible for me to stop the undying race with just that!”

The Universe Sprite gazed at him, “This large universe created me, and it created Snowy. While both of us can leave and allow the universe to live or die as fate decides, just like you people cannot forget where you came from, we sprites can’t do it either! If we just leave like that, we’ll be ungrateful. So, I intend to do my best to protect this world. It’s my responsibility!”

Yang Ye asked, “Do you think that you can stop the undying race?”

The Universe Sprite walked over to Yang Ye, “There’s something I really admire about you. No matter what kind of enemy you face, you dare to fight and kill them. Our large universe’s strength is inferior to the undying race, but so what? They want our home and spirit energy, so should we just give it to them? It’s like if someone wants your wife, and that person is stronger than you, would you just give your wife to him? Of course, many would definitely be capable of that!”

She looked up at the sky, “Dignity. Regardless of whether it’s a person or sprite, everyone should live with dignity.”

Yang Ye shook his head and didn’t say anything.

He did feel some admiration toward the Universe Sprite. She was like Little Sky. While they were sprites, they had their own responsibilities, and they were willing to sacrifice themselves for it!

Those who dared to shoulder responsibility were people worth respecting!

Meanwhile, the Universe Sprite said, “Come with me!”

She walked off toward the Bodhi Tree once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye followed her.

It didn’t take long for them to arrive before it, and she spoke softly, “Actually, it’s at its end as well!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

She replied, “Its spirit was heavily injured and fell into deep sleep. Coupled with the current state of the large universe, it will wither and perish if its spirit cannot awaken.”

“It was heavily injured?!” Yang Ye asked, “Who did it?”

The Universe Sprite shook her head, “Let’s not talk about that. I want it to go inside that pagoda of yours. The Primordial Violet Energy in there can help it recover, and in return, you can do some comprehension below it when you’re free. Of course, it has many other benefits and effects, and you can find out slowly!”

She paused for a moment at this point and continued, “It existed before the Initial Civilization. Every single one of its leaves holds a story; every one of its branches holds a universe. It’s a history book with records of the rise and fall of the large universe, and it holds the records on life too. If you comprehend the Dao below it, your cultivation, Sword Dao, and Slaughter Dao will benefit tremendously.”

Yang Ye nodded, gazed at the Bodhi Tree, and then waved his right hand. A ray of golden light enveloped the Bodhi Tree, but it dispersed before it could even get close to the Bodhi Tree.

Yang Ye frowned slightly. Meanwhile, the Universe Sprite explained, “It’s an instinctive reaction. Your slaughter intent is too strong, so it’s rejecting you.”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Meanwhile, the Universe Sprite waved her hand, and Snowy appeared here. She spoke softly, “Make it go inside!”

Snowy blinked and gazed at the Bodhi Tree. She thought for a moment, and then she flew over to it, grabbed one of its branches, and started pulling in Yang Ye’s direction…

The Universe Sprite was utterly speechless.

While the Bodhi Tree didn’t resist Snowy, it didn’t follow her either.

Of course, whether the Bodhi Tree understood Snowy’s intentions was an entirely different story.

The Universe Sprite walked over to Snowy, rubbed her head, and said, “Talk to it!”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Can’t you talk to it?”

The Universe Sprite shook her head slightly, “It’s vigilant against me!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The Universe Sprite gazed at Yang Ye, “What’s the point in asking that?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

It didn’t take long for Snowy to start talking to the Bodhi Tree.

While its spirit had fallen into deep sleep, it still had its instinctive consciousness. A short while later, it shook, and then it transformed into a ray of light that entered Yang Ye with Snowy.

It had gone into the Primordial Pagoda!

After it entered the Primordial Pagoda, it immediately looked for a mountain range and entered it. Meanwhile, Snowy was atop the Bodhi Tree, and so was Scarlet. Scarlet was Snowy’s lackey now. It couldn’t be helped, she had to while she was in the Primordial Pagoda. She was no match for Snowy, and Snowy had so many friends too.

Regardless of whether it was the Sword Supreme, the Sword Precursor, or the Primordial Pagoda, all of them were very close to Snowy!

So, Scarlet had realized the situation she was in, and so she followed Snowy.

Suddenly, two swords flashed and descended before the Bodhi Tree.

The Sword Supreme and Sword Precursor!

The Sword Supreme returned to human form and walked slowly to the Bodhi Tree. She gazed at it for a long time before she spoke softly, “What is justice, what is righteousness?”

The Bodhi Tree trembled slightly, and then scenes appeared within the Sword Supreme’s mind…

Righteousness?

A long time passed before she gradually opened her eyes, “There is no absolute righteousness, no absolute righteousness… Is that your answer?”

“Righteousness?” Meanwhile, Yang Ye walked over to her, “Sword Supreme, as far as I’m concerned, there is great and minor righteousness and justice. Of course, the meaning of these words depend entirely on yourself. If you think it’s correct, then do it. So, there’s no need to make it so complicated!”

The Sword Supreme shook her head slightly, “This world is in chaos!”

Yang Ye replied, “I know, but have you considered that while the undying race has invaded the large universe, plundered so much spirit energy from here, and caused countless to die here; all of this has allowed them to breathe new life into their race and allowed their people to grow even stronger. So, tell me, are their actions righteous or cruel?”

The Sword Supreme fell silent for a long time and said, “It’s cruel to us, but it’s righteous to them!”

Yang Ye nodded, “So, there is no absolute righteousness!”

She glanced at him, “I understand!”

She transformed into a ray of light and vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye gazed at the Bodhi Tree. Meanwhile, Snowy brought Scarlet over to him. She cracked a smile, and then she pointed at the Bodhi Tree.

Yang Ye grinned, gazed at the Bodhi Tree, walked over to it, and sat down.

Calm!

As he sat before it, Yang Ye’s heart felt unprecedentedly calm.

Extraordinary!

At this moment, Yang Ye really felt that it was truly extraordinary. But that was a normal reaction because the Bodhi Tree was on par with the Primordial Pagoda.

When she saw Yang Ye sit down, Snowy imitated him and sat on his shoulder. However, her gaze was moving about and wasn’t calm at all.

A long time passed before Yang Ye asked softly, “What is the Sword Dao?”

The Bodhi Tree fell silent for an instant, and then a ray of white light entered his forehead.

It didn’t take long for scenes to appear in Yang Ye’s mind.

Sword cultivators!

Countless sword cultivators had appeared in Yang Ye’s mind. Yang Ye didn’t recognize them. There were sword cultivators from the time of the Initial Civilization, the void spirit race, and even the present times.

The meaning of the Sword Dao!

In his mind, all of these sword cultivators were describing the meaning of the Sword Dao.

What was the sword? What was the Sword Dao?

A long time passed before Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes, and then he stood up slowly, “A million people, a million explanations. My Sword Dao is very simple, it’s killing. Killing is my Sword Dao! Those who hurt me or stand in my path, I’ll kill them all!”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away.
