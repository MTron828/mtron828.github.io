Chapter 1063 – Cut It Off!

Yang Ye gazed at her, “They brought it forward?”

She nodded lightly, “It probably has been!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Looks like they can’t wait any longer! Fine, I should be heading to the Central Divine Prefecture anyway. Come. Summon Instructor Zhuo and the others, and I have an announcement to make.”

Yu Wushuang nodded and left the room.

The City Governor’s Estate had been destroyed, so the meeting was held in the grand hall of Cloud Ocean Pavilion.

Only Instructor Zhuo, Yu Wushuang, and Shang Qingying were here. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto Instructor Zhuo and the other 3 Saints, “Instructor Zhuo, I’ll disregard the past and only consider the future. I summoned all of you here because I have an announcement to make. Firstly, Ocean of Clouds Academy and City will be fully under Yu Wushuang’s control after I leave. All 4 of you are to support her. Of course, your past status in the academy remains the same as before.”

Instructor Zhuo nodded, “After what we’ve experienced, we’ve let go of a lot of things, and we have no desire for power. We wouldn’t manage the academy and city even if you asked us to do it. Don’t worry. We won’t interfere in the matters of the academy. After all, we can rest at ease while she’s managing everything.”

Yang Ye nodded, “To be honest, I don’t have any desire to manage the academy, and I won’t stay here forever. I like my freedom, and I understand that my character isn’t suitable to be the dean. So, I’ll return the academy to Miss Shang once the danger that the academy faces is resolved!”

Shang Qingying was slightly stunned, and she gazed at him with surprise.

Yang Ye shot his gaze towards her as well, “Miss Shang, the academy was built by your grandfather, and I refuse to take the results of his efforts. I, Yang Ye, keep my promises. The academy will be returned to you once it’s done.”

Shang Qingying spoke softly, “My grandfather chose you!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Your grandfather knew that your strength wasn’t sufficient to take control of the entire academy. Especially when the academy was facing enemies from all sides. He didn’t let you be the dean because he was protecting you and the academy. I presume you should have realized that by now!”

Shang Qingying shook her head after quite some time passed, “You’re more suitable to be the dean than I am!”

Yang Ye waved his hand and said, “Let’s put that aside for now. If I don’t come back from my trip to White Deer Academy, then everything I said would be meaningless. The 2nd thing is that the academy has to train even more diligently once I’m gone. The world is very chaotic, and only strength will allow us to avoid being bullied, insulted, and destroyed.”

Yang Ye gazed at Yu Wushuang at this point, “Wushuang, I hope I’ll be able to see a completely new academy when I return.”

Yu Wushuang asked, “Are we not joining White Deer Academy?”

Yang Ye grinned, “So long as we are worth something, then why should we beg them to let us join them? Besides that, why should we join them? Can we not advance to the ranks of Diamond Rank powers on our own? Is it very difficult? As far as I’m concerned, it isn’t difficult at all. We just have to work hard enough!”

Instructor Zhuo and the others felt their blood boil when they heard Yang Ye!

Yu Wushuang and Shang Qingying’s eyes glowed with unprecedented brightness!

Why can’t we advance into the ranks of Diamond Rank powers on our own?

They’d never thought about this in the past, and that even included Shang Yunxi. But now that Yang Ye had brought it up, they felt slightly enlightened. Right, why don’t we work hard and advance into the ranks of Diamond Rank powers on our own?

Was it possible? It naturally was!

Because they had Yang Ye! Especially at this point in time when Yang Ye had practically become the idol of the entire younger generation in the prefecture. In just a short period of 3 days, there had been countless cultivators that had rushed over and joined the academy. It could be said that while Ocean of Clouds Academy wasn’t the stronger power in the prefecture, it was definitely the most superior when it came to drawing others over to it!

Because Yang Ye was at Ocean of Clouds Academy!

Yu Wushuang gazed at Yang Ye and spoke firmly, “You’ll definitely see a completely new prefecture and academy when you return!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he waved his right hand. 10 Saint Realm puppets appeared here. They were those corpses that the red haired old man had given him that day, and he’d refined them into Sword Servants.

Yang Ye said, “They are just ordinary Saints, so it’s pointless for me to take them with me. They’ll be very useful to you instead. Wushuang, you decide how to use them. I’ve given them the order to obey your every command!”

Yu Wushuang nodded, and then she gazed at him, “When will you be leaving?”

“As soon as possible!” Yang Ye took a deep breath. He wasn’t just going to participate in the competition, locating Xiao Yuxi and Ding Shaoyao were his main objectives as well.

After what happened to An Nanjing, he really didn’t want to waste anymore time here. Because the longer they stayed outside, the higher the possibility that they encountered danger!

Yu Wushuang spoke in a low voice as she gazed at him, “I’ll be waiting for you to come back!”

Yang Ye said, “I definitely will!”

Meanwhile, Lu Wan’er walked into the hall.

Yang Ye nodded, “Let’s go!”

...

The Ancient Sword School.

Now that he was done with the academy, he’d traveled to the sword school with Lu Wan’er.

Hall of Heroes.

It was where the departed seniors of the Ancient Sword School were honored. At this moment, the disciples of the sword school filled both sides of the hall, and there were countless memorial tablets at the end of the hall. The tablets at the frontmost were Jian Wuchen and Daoist Gu’s.

Yang Ye and Lu Wan’er had just stepped foot into the hall when the gazes of everyone here descended onto Yang Ye and her. Yang Ye walked towards Daoist Gu and Jian Wuchen’s memorial tablets while everyone watched him, and he knelt there.

“I, Yang Ye, swear that I will never betray the Ancient Sword School in this lifetime!” Yang Ye’s resounded. He clenched his fists as he gazed at the 2 memorial tablets before him. After all, they didn’t owe him anything, yet they’d died for his sake. He felt that he didn’t deserve it at all!

Everyone here gazed at Yang Ye when they heard him, and their gazes grew much gentler. Meanwhile, an old man helped Yang Ye up and said, “You’re a disciple of my Ancient Sword School. As your master and the Sword Master of our sword school, how could they have possibly left you there? No matter what, Lou Qianyun is dead and Sky Divine Hall has been destroyed, so they can be considered to have been avenged. You don’t have to blame yourself for it!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and stood up slowly. He glanced at the surroundings before his gaze fell on Elder Li in the end, “If the Ancient Sword School needs me for anything, then I, Yang Ye, will be there!”

Elder Li pondered deeply for a moment before he said, “We want to make you the Sword Master!”

“Why?” Yang Ye was quite puzzled. Even though his seniority in the sect wasn’t low, it wasn’t high either. Logically speaking, the position of Sword Master wasn’t his at all.

Elder Li spoke solemnly, “Because you’re the strongest, and it’s because we believe that you’ll be able to lead our sword school to a prosperous future!”

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then he said, “Elders, I understand what you mean. However, do you really think I can assume the position of patriarch? In any case, I don’t think that I’m a qualified leader. Moreover, I’m heading to the Central Divine Prefecture, so I won’t have time to manage a sect at all. How about you do this? Choose someone else to be the Sword Master, and you can give me a nominal position!”

Elder Li and the others exchanged glances, and then a short while passed before he spoke in a low voice, “How about we do this? Let Wan’er be the Sword Master, and you can be our Supreme Elder. Your status will stand above all, and you won’t be restrained by the sword sect. Alright?”

Lu Wan’er was stunned.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye glanced at her and nodded, “Alright!”

All of them immediately nodded when they heard Yang Ye’s agreement.

Outside the Ancient Sword School, Yang Ye and Lu Wan’er walked side by side on a mountain.

Lu Wan’er spoke softly, “I can’t head to the Central Divine Prefecture with you anymore!”

Yang Ye stopped, took her hand, and spoke softly, “Then wait for me to return!”

Lu Wan’er asked, “You wouldn’t get someone new and forget about your old flame once you get there, right?”

Yang Ye was speechless.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye felt a wave of sweet fragrance assault his nose, and then a delicate figure was lying against him. Lu Wan’er spoke softly, “You can’t expand your harem anymore. Otherwise... otherwise....”

Yang Ye suddenly felt a certain part of his body being squeezed when she spoke up to this point, and his figure stiffened. At the same time, she continued, “Or I’ll cut it off!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

After accompanying Lu Wan’er for some time, she watched with reluctance as he left the Ancient Sword School.

Once he left the Ancient Sword School, the sword wings on his back suddenly spread out, and they transformed into huge wings which blotted out the sky. After that, he raised his speed to its limits and shot off in a certain direction.

...

The Zither of Love. Immortal Island.

Yang Ye had only just descended on Immortal Island when over a dozen old man appeared around him, and even Asura Queen was there.

Asura Queen asked in a gloomy voice, “What are you doing here?”

Yang Ye replied, “I’m here to see her!”

“Who do you think you are?” Asura Queen spoke fiercely, “Fuck off right now! Otherwise....”

“Let him come in!” Meanwhile, Lady’s voice resounded abruptly.

Asura Queen’s expression changed. In the end, she glanced coldly at Yang Ye before turning around and leaving.

Yang Ye glanced at Asura Queen and said, “If you really can’t stand the sight of me, then we can fight in single combat once I’ve attained the Saint Realm. In any case, I can’t stand the sight of you.”

Asura Queen stopped and turned around to look at him, “I’ll remember that!”

Yang Ye shrugged and vanished on the spot.

Asura Hall.

Only Lady and Yang Ye were here, and she just gazed silently at him.

Yang Ye was used to this, and he immediately said, “I want to ask you about Domains!”

He couldn’t allow the Sword Domain to continue being so useless. Otherwise, he might really die on his trip to the Central Divine Prefecture!
