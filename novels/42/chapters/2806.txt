Chapter 2807 – Order of All!

The woman’s Dao was the Fate Dao, and it contained too, too much. But Yang Ye only possessed the Fate Sword Dao, and it was just the intent to decide fate.

The difference between deciding and determining was a huge difference in their essence!

When deciding fate, everything was unknown; while determining face, the outcome was determined!

In the sky, Yang Ye moved his gaze away and closed his eyes slowly.

Monarch Yan had used his death to tell Yang Ye what level the woman was at. While her strength was still a mystery, Yang Ye had learned a lot. Because he’d noticed his flaws when watching her attack.

The Fate Sword Dao!

He had the will to decide life and death, but he didn’t have the will and courage to determine fate like she did.

Her sword wasn’t swung to decide life and death, it was to determine a person’s fate.

It was a different mental state!

His mental state was lower than Destiny’s, and if he used his Fate Sword Dao against her, he would definitely lose!

However, since she could accomplish that, why couldn’t he?

Yang Ye looked up at the sky.

The Fate Dao?

In the end, he shook his head. Life and death wasn’t something so easily comprehended, and Destiny had definitely experienced years of comprehensions in order to attain her current strength!

It was already quite shocking that he could even attain the Fate Sword Dao.

Perhaps there were extraordinary geniuses in this world who could attain her level just by witnessing her Dao, but Yang Ye wasn’t capable of that!

He was no match for her!

Yang Ye was no match for Destiny right now, and that was a fact, a fact he wasn’t trying to avoid.

High above the clouds, the woman looked down at Yang Ye and smiled, “Your mental state isn’t bad. You don’t reach too far beyond you or underestimate yourself.”

She flicked her finger, and then Justice suddenly passed through space and arrived above Yang Ye.

She grinned, “Don’t you call it the Fate Sword Dao? Try stopping an attack of mine!”

Justice!

Justice descended straight down at Yang Ye!

It caused Yang Ye to instantly enter the state of the Fate Sword Dao!

Because it was an attack that determined fate!

He would die if he couldn’t stop it!

But that wasn’t even the most terrifying part!

Yang Ye stared at Justice as it descended. It was because he sensed more than one Sword Dao within this attack, it contained too, too much!

He only had four Sword Dao, the Fate Sword Dao, the Demonic Sword Dao, the Sword Dao of Order, and the Sword Dao of Emotion. However, her attack contained too, too many Sword Daos. There were some that he’d witnessed before like the Slaughter Sword Dao, and there were some he’d never seen before!

Most importantly, she was actually able to merge so many into a single attack!

The sword grew closer and closer to Yang Ye. At this moment, the sword intent and slaughter intent he emanated was at an extremely terrifying level.

The more danger he faced, the stronger he became!

At this moment, he was in grave danger, extremely grave danger!

His will to decide life and death was at its peak!

So, Yang Ye drew his sword.

A sword howl resounded, and then Yang Ye’s sword shot out from its sheath and slashed at Justice!

The swords collided in midair.

There was no explosion or rumbling through the world. Because as soon as they came into contact, the Sword Precursor shattered, and Justice shot straight down at Yang Ye!

Yang Ye remained visibly indifferent as he watched the sword descend, and it rapidly closed the distance between them. However, when Justice arrived just around 1m away from him, it suddenly stopped.

At this moment, it was like the world had frozen abruptly!

The woman looked down at Yang Ye from above the clouds, and there was a trace of surprise in her eyes, “Tsk, tsk, what a pleasant surprise! The Sword Domain… The Sword Domain of Fate…”

The sword above him just remained motionless there, and it had stopped because of his Sword Domain!

At the critical moment, Yang Ye had unleashed his Sword Domain, but it was no ordinary Sword Domain, it was the Sword Domain of Fate!

Yang Ye couldn’t determine fate with a single attack like she did, but he could create a Sword Domain to decide on life and death in!

The Sword Domain of Fate could be explained as an enhanced version of the Fate Sword Dao, and it was a place to decide on life and death! Now that he was being supported by this Sword Domain, the strength of his attack would increase by at around 50% at least!

Yang Ye swung his sword again!

It was still the Sword Precursor!

The Sword Precursor shot up into the air and slashed at Justice.

Bang!

Justice shook violently, but it wasn’t pushed back at all! Moreover, it was still descending, but it was much slower than before. Moreover, this time, the Sword Precursor was able to resist Justice’s strength and avoided shattering again!

Yang Ye gazed at Justice, and then closed his eyes slowly. At this instant, a wave of monstrous slaughter intent suddenly swept out from him.

Yang Ye stomped his right foot down, “Break!”

As soon as he said that, a wave of mysterious energy suddenly surged into the Sword Precursor from within the Sword Domain. The Sword Precursor shook violently while countless rays of sword energy, sword intent, and slaughter intent erupted from it. All of them instantly enveloped Justice.

However, Justice still wasn’t pushed back at all!

Suddenly, the woman above the clouds chuckled. She raised her hand and was about to press it down when a sword suddenly appeared above Yang Ye, and then it stabbed at Justice!

The woman above the clouds twisted her hand gently, and then Justice abandoned the Sword Precursor and slashed to the side!

Bang!

The world quaked and cracked open!

It was the entire world that had been affected, and the crack stretched beyond the limits of Yang Ye’s vision. It was like the world had become a huge spider web!

At this moment, all the experts from the Four Dimensional Universe were absolutely shocked!

Some of the relatively weaker experts were even injured by the aftershock, and some were even on the verge of losing their lives!

But if they were able to be here, how weak could they be?

Countless looked up at the sky. The swords there had split from each other. One of them was Justice, and the other one was unknown to the experts from the Four Dimensional Universe. But Yang Ye recognized it!

It was the Unfettered One’s sword!

The Unfettered One!

Yang Ye looked up at the sky, but he didn’t see the Unfettered One. Obviously, he wasn’t here.

The woman glanced down in a certain direction and grinned, “Fine, I’ll let it be for now. You better hurry up, I’m afraid that I’ll get impatient.”

She waved her hand gently, and then Justice shot through space and vanished.

Meanwhile, the Unfettered One’s sword vanished as well.

Somewhere in the starry sky, a sword descended firmly before a sword cultivator in cloud white robes.

The sword cultivator nodded slightly, and it returned to his sword sheath before he continued forward.

But this time, he was much faster than before, and his speed was increasing!

Eternal Kingdom.

Yang Ye looked up at that point in space. He had the Unfettered One’s help this time, but would he have it next time?

The woman had a slight desire to kill him this time, and if she killed him, then the Three Dimensional Universe’s fate would be sealed as well.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time. In the end, he looked down at the experts from the Four Dimensional Universe. At this moment, they were looking at him too.

Now that they’d lost Monarch Yan, and coupled with the fact that Yang Ye had the ring which controlled that formation, it could be said that it would be absolutely easy for Yang Ye to annihilate them now!

Yang Ye remained silent for a short while, and then he suddenly said, “Who’s your leader now?”

An old man appeared before Yang Ye. He wasn’t entirely the same as a human, but the difference wasn’t that huge either. He was just much larger and had features that were around 60% similar to humans.

Yang Ye gazed at the old man, and the latter spoke solemnly, “I’m Yan Ku, the current Grand Elder of the Yanmo Clan.”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment and said, “If I’m being honest, I don’t want to let you stay here.”

Yan Ku’s expression changed when he heard this. Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “Because if anything were to happen to me, all of you will definitely do as you wish.”

“You’re mistaken!” Yan Ku spoke abruptly, “The Three Dimensional Universe wants peace, and our desire for that is even stronger!”

Yang Ye gazed at Yan Ku, and the latter laughed bitterly, “There aren’t many of us left. If we continue fighting, even if we win in the end, all of us seniors would probably perish during the battle, and it would be worse for the weaker experts of our clan. I can only imagine how many will die. We want peace too, and we want to rest and recuperate too. As for the future, no one can predict what will happen, right?”

Yang Ye looked down below, and countless experts from the Four Dimensional Universe were looking at him.

Even Yan Ku who stood before Yang Ye felt the same way. It would be a lie to say that he wasn’t worried. Because the Four Dimensional Universe was really incapable of stopping Yang Ye right now. If Yang Ye’s sword was unsheathed, it would be a slaughter!

The Four Dimensional Universe’s forces would be slaughtered by him!

Their fate would be decided by a single decision of his!

As he gazed at the group down below, Yang Ye suddenly felt quite lost.

Because if it was based on his past character, he would definitely slaughter them all. After all, they had been his enemies earlier!

He’d never shown mercy to his enemies.

At this moment, so long as he willed it, he would be entirely capable of slaughtering all the experts from the Four Dimensional Universe!

The entire world fell silent along with Yang Ye’s silence, and it was simply so perfectly silent that a falling needle could be heard!

Cold sweat had emerged on Yan Ku’s forehead.

Just like that, around 10 minutes passed before Yang Ye suddenly shook his head and smiled, “Order… My order is not one of slaughter…”

As he spoke, he looked down at the experts from the Four Dimensional Universe, “If you stay in the Three Dimensional Universe, are you willing to abide by the Order I’ve created?”

Practically all of them fell to their knees in an instant, “We are.”

Yan Ku bowed deeply to Yang Ye, “We are willing to protect the Three Dimensional Universe with you and face the strongest form of Destiny!”

The Sword Precursor trembled by Yang Ye’s waist, and it seemed to be undergoing some sort of change.

Yang Ye was actually unaware that Order wasn’t created in a day, and his Sword Dao of Order was being perfected, bit by bit…

Establishing Order on one’s own wasn’t anything special, and true Order was one where everyone willingly abided by it!

It was called the Order of All!
