Chapter 2545

The Soul Sect’s Soul Exalt was very confident, extremely even.

Because the number of people in this world who were capable of instilling fear in him could be counted with just his hands.

Once someone was strong to a certain extent, and especially when such an expert possessed a high status, life would be nothing to them. They would kill for the slightest ounce of displeasure!

Just like how some emperors of the mortal world would kill without any reason.

If they didn’t like someone, they killed the person!

The strong did as they pleased!

It was the same for the Soul Exalt!

Of course, there was a reason why he was trying to kill right now. It was because the middle aged sword cultivator’s gaze was too hurtful, it was complete and utter disregard!

He'd been disregarded!

The Soul Exalt didn’t like such a gaze!

So, he’d attacked!

The middle aged sword cultivator suddenly flicked his left thumb slightly.

His sword left its sheath!

“AH!” A shrill cry resounded, and then the Soul Exalt’s arm was sliced into two!

The Soul Exalt gazed at the sword cultivator with astonishment, “W-Who are you?!”

The sword cultivator glanced at him and then entered the abyss.

Disregard!

He’d been disregarded again!

But this time, the Soul Exalt didn’t feel any anger, and all he felt was extreme fear!

That attack could have taken his life!

There was a sword cultivator in this world who could take his life with just a single attack, yet he’d never heard of this person!

Where did this sword cultivator come from?

The Soul Exalt had many questions!

He didn’t dare to stay and quickly left the area.

…

The sword cultivator went all the way down, and it didn’t take long for him to arrive at the bottom.

He wasn’t obstructed by anyone all along the way!

At the bottom of the abyss, he saw a young girl kicking a ball. There were two hunched black robed old men on either side of her. If one looked carefully, one would notice that they weren’t hunched, they were bowing. They were bowing to the young girl!

The young girl was kicking a bloody head as a ball, and there was a mural of a demon beast on the wall behind her.

The sword cultivator glanced at the mural, and it felt slightly familiar to him. It didn’t take long for him to recall a certain young girl, and then he understood!

The young girl suddenly asked, “What’s your name?”

The sword cultivator moved his gaze to the young girl, “Names are meaningless to me!.”

She continued kicking the head as she spoke casually, “You make me sense danger!”

The sword cultivator glanced at the surroundings and said, “This place feels extraordinary to me.”

The young girl cracked a smile, “This is a special world!”

The sword cultivator nodded slightly, “An unusual space! You’re using the space here to suppress your cultivation!”

He gazed at her and continued, “Indeed, the world outside cannot accommodate you.”

She gave him a thumbs up and said, “You know your stuff. I really hate it when people come here and disturb me. Only two have ever come here in all these years, and you are the second person!”

The sword cultivator gazed at her, “Shall we spar?”

She nodded, “Alright!”

She suddenly attacked…

…

The Ancient Sword Sect.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye was lying on the Ascension Platform. His entire body was scorched black by the lightning.

With the help of Primordial Violet Energy, it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to recover. Unfortunately, he was still just at the Three World Realm and hadn’t advanced!

However, he had gained something. His body was slightly stronger than before, and he was getting closer to the Four World Realm.

Yang Ye stopped cultivating and left the Primordial Pagoda. In the Ancient Sword Sect’s grand hall, Yang Ye met the pig-riding young woman.

She gazed at Yang Ye, sized him up, and then swung her saber at him.

It was a very fast swing!

Yang Ye hurriedly moved aside and smiled, “I admit defeat, I admit defeat, alright?”

She was quite displeased, “What? You think I have no right to fight you?”

Yang Ye hurriedly shook his head, “Of course not, it’s mainly because you’re so strong, and I’m afraid you’ll destroy my sect if you fight me here!”

She glanced at him and didn’t attack again. She just sized up the surroundings and said, “You’re doing pretty good, huh? You’re actually a sect master, and this sect doesn’t seem ordinary either!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “It’s a long story!”

She gazed at him, “When is the Soul Sect attacking?”

Yang Ye replied, “It should be soon.”

She nodded, “Do you know where Eldest Sister and the others are?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Not yet. But I’ve asked people to search for them. They will come to me if they are found.”

She spoke softly, “I wonder how they are doing!”

Yang Ye smiled, caught up with her a little, and then left the hall to deal with other affairs.

While he had Sword Scroll, Elder Gu Nan, and the others to manage the sect, he wasn’t completely without any work to do.

The Ancient Sword Sect distributed all the Divine Treasures and other treasures it had, and it undoubtedly caused quite a stir in the sect.

Especially for those elite disciples and other disciples with extraordinary strength. Possessing a divine treasure was something they dreamed of!

All of the disciples were extremely grateful for what Yang Ye did. While the sect was in a bad situation, their morale and desire to fight was surging!

There were around 3,000 sword cultivators throughout the Ancient Sword Sect, and they could be said to be 90% of all sword cultivators in Eternal Kingdom.

After all, the condition to become a sword cultivator was quite harsh. Because it required the comprehension of sword intent, and sword intent was an ethereal existence that couldn’t be comprehended with ease. Thus, it kept many away from taking the path of a sword cultivator! As for those who succeeded, especially those who joined a powerful sect like the Ancient Sword Sect, their strength and talent were usually not bad!

It could be said that the strength of these 3,000 sword cultivators was extremely impressive!

After all, the Ancient Sword Sect had stopped the desolate race’s Deathguard with just a few hundred sword cultivators all those years ago!

On this day, a black robed man appeared in the sky outside the sect.

After that, a voice resounded from the sky, “Anyone from the Ancient Sword Sect who surrenders will be spared!”

As soon as those words were spoken, over 100 black clothed figures appeared outside the Ancient Sword Sect.

Numerous powerful auras and divine senses extended toward the sect!

In the hall within the sect, Yang Ye looked outside and said, “So they’re here?”

Sword howls resounded throughout the mountains of the Ancient Sword Sect, and then rays of light shot into the air and arrived at the main peak.

All the disciples had converged!

Yang Ye walked out of the hall, and Sword Scroll, Gu Nan, and two other elders were behind him.

On the training ground below the stairs before them were a few thousand disciples. All of them had swords on their backs and they emanated sharp sword intent and battle intent!

Obviously, they were without any fear toward facing the Soul Sect!

As he gazed at them, Yang Ye grinned and sighed with emotion!

They are sword cultivators!

This is what sword cultivators should be like!

Yang Ye walked toward them and looked up at the black robed men in the sky. He chuckled and said, “Who has our Ancient Sword Sect ever feared?” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of light that shot up into the air and arrived before the black robed figures.

The black robed figure who led the group was a Lord Realm expert, a Guardian of the Soul Sect, and his status was merely inferior to the Soul Exalt and Sect Master of the Soul Sect!

Behind the Guardian was the woman in a black dress. At this moment, she was staring at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye sized up the black robed figures before him, “Looks like you plan to decide the victor in one go!”

The Guardian shook his head, “You’re wrong. Allow me to be frank, the Ancient Sword Sect is nothing to us. It doesn’t have the right to fight us to decide the victor!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Why don’t you try and find out if that’s true?”

The Guardian waved his right hand lightly. In an instant, a huge black hole appeared behind him, and it grew rapidly. In the end, it covered half the sky.

A formation!

Yang Ye was about to use the Universe Seal when the Guardian’s aura locked onto him, “King against King. I’m your opponent!”

He waved his right hand once he finished speaking.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The space around Yang Ye suddenly transformed, and then he appeared in a void. Only the Guardian was standing before him!

Yang Ye glanced at the Guardian and asked, “Are you planning to fight me in single combat?”

The Guardian withdrew a sword and asked, “What do you think?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he flicked the sword lightly. In an instant, countless rays of black sword energy rippled out in Yang Ye’s direction.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then two flying swords shot out from the Sword Gourd…

Meanwhile, in the sky above the Ancient Sword Sect.

The huge black hole suddenly emanated beams of light that rained down upon the Ancient Sword Sect!

Sword Scroll glanced at the beams of light and ordered, “Activate the formations!

As soon as the order was given, the sect shook, and then countless rays of sword energy surged up into the air!

Explosions resounded incessantly in the sky.

The woman in a black dress shot an icy cold glance at the sect below her, and then she suddenly vanished on the spot. She was before the sect when she appeared again, and the black robed figures charged down behind her!

A few hundred against a few thousand!

The reason the Soul Sect dared to do this was because there were no less than 10 Lord Realm experts in the force they’d sent, and there were even around 20 Five World Realm experts among them.

Quality made up for quantity!

As for the Ancient Sword Sect, the Grand Elder and the others had left, so they had very few Lord Realm experts!

The woman in a black dress led the charge and was the first to arrive before the Ancient Sword Sect. However, it only took a moment for a woman to obstruct her path.

A linen dress and bare feet!

Nether Maiden!

Nether Maiden gazed indifferently at the woman in a black dress.

Their gazes met!
