Chapter 2256 – I’m Afraid I Can’t!

The entire city gradually darkened.

At this moment, everyone looked up, and the sky above was covered by a dark expanse of something. If one looked carefully, one would notice that they were undying cavalry.

Around 600 undying cavalry!

They had spears on their backs and Nefarious below them!

Besides that, there were 30 mysterious experts with spears on their backs standing in front of the undying cavalry.

They were all led by Lord Xiao Lou, while on both sides of Xiao Lou were two of the three wise men.

Practically all the forces of the undying race were here!

Xiao Lou looked at the continent below and spoke softly, “Void Spirit Continent again. The same thing won’t happen twice.”

Master Yuan asked, “Shall we attack?”

Xiao Lou grinned, “Not yet.”

Master Yuan nodded and moved aside.

…

Yang Ye floated up into the air above the city, and everyone was looking at him.

An Nanjing was by his side.

Yang Ye glanced at the crowd below him, and a long time passed before he raised his hands. In an instant, the crowd fell silent.

Yang Ye said, “I presume all of you know about the teleportation formation now. Flee! Your own fortune will decide if you live or die.”

Countless people knelt down in unison.

If Yang Ye hadn’t been willing to take them in, they would already be dead by now. So, it was all thanks to Yang Ye that they’d survived for so long.

After kowtowing to him once, they shot out of the city and fled madly into the distance.

Yang Ye shook his head slightly as he watched them flee, and sadness arose within him.

It wasn’t pity!

It was sorrow!

How many experts were there in the world? How many weaklings? The strong possess strength and can do as they please, they can rule over the lives of others. But what about the weak? The weak can only suffer slaughter and be ruled over?

For the first time, Yang Ye felt that these social laws were too cruel.

An Nanjing asked softly, “What is it?”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “How many do you think will be able to survive?”

She pondered deeply for a moment and replied, “Very few!”

“Yeah!” Yang Ye spoke softly, “It isn’t just them, even we may not survive!”

He shook his head and continued, “Are Elder Yuan and the others at the endless black holes?”

An Nanjing nodded, “They’ve arrived there and hidden themselves. So long as the undying race activates the formation, they will take action.”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “I’m afraid their strength won’t be enough, you…”

Suddenly, An Nanjing stood before Yang Ye and looked him in the eye, “What does their fate have to do with me?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Fine, you stay with me.”

She withdrew her gaze and stood by his side, “No matter in life or death, we’ll stay together this time, alright?”

Yang Ye glanced at her, and then he suddenly started roaring with laughter that shot through the surroundings.

In Void Spirit City.

At this moment, it was already an empty city in this short amount of time.

They’d fled!

Everyone in the city had fled.

Not even one of them stayed behind.

In the sky above the continent, Xiao Lou and the undying race’s experts watched coldly as all of this happened. They ignored those cultivators who had fled the city. Their target was the void spirit race and Yang Ye!

Once they deal with these two enemies, the undying race could annihilate the rest in an instant.

Meanwhile, Master Yuan suddenly said, “They seem to be going toward the endless black holes!”

Xiao Lou shot a glance down at the city and spoke indifferently, “It’s fine. Master Tian and the Undead Warriors are there.”

Master Yuan nodded.

Xiao Lou asked, “What about the god race?”

Master Yuan spoke solemnly, “They are playing some tricks too!”

Xiao Lou grinned, “It’s fine. We’ll deal with all of them at once.”

Meanwhile, Dugu Juetian suddenly asked, “Lord Xiao Lou, shall we attack?”

Xiao Lou glanced at her and said, “Wait a while longer. Our patriarch needs a little more time.”

Meanwhile, down below in Void Spirit City.

Tian Xiu stood in the cemetery while the countless spirits were before her. They were the renowned peerless experts of the void spirit race, and they were the extraordinary army that had fought off the undying race all those years ago!

Of course, they’d paid a terrible price for that!

Now, they were facing the undying race again, and there was only hatred and flames of revenge in their eyes!

Yang Ye and An Nanjing were by Tian Xiu’s side.

Tian Xiu suddenly asked, “Do you know why my void spirit race lost all those years ago?”

Yang Ye and An Nanjing gazed at her while curiosity filled their eyes.

Void Spirit Maiden!

An unmatched expert of the past and the void spirit race which once ruled over the large universe. Why had they lost to the undying race all those years ago? A gap in strength? Or something else?

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu looked up at the sky, “In terms of strength, my void spirit race was slightly inferior to them, but that wasn’t sufficient to make my entire race suffer a horrible defeat. The true reason for our loss was the undying race’s determination to fight until the end! Their determination and cohesion they possess as a race is the strongest I’ve ever seen.”

Determination!

Yang Ye fell silent. Actually, as far as he was concerned, this determination to fight until the end was more important than strength. If a person lacked that, what kind of person would that person be? Conversely, if an entire race lacked that, what kind of race would it be?

And there was cohesion too!

If a race had no cohesion, they would be incapable of creating a united force! Conversely, a race with high cohesion would be absolutely not weak! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu continued, “You know… besides its patriarch, the undying race had its Twin Elders. Their strengths were on par with Xiao Lou. Besides them, they had two others, the guardians of the undying race. They were merely inferior to the patriarch of the undying race. Yet now, the undying race only has its patriarch and Xiao Lou left. Do you know why?”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “You killed them!”

Tian Xiu closed her eyes slowly, “All those years ago, so long as I remained standing, my void spirit race would never fall. However, the Twin Elders, their two guardians, and their patriarch did everything they could to keep me locked in battle. Moreover, besides their patriarch, the rest of them didn’t hesitate to sacrifice millennia of cultivation and chose to detonate themselves!”

Self-detonation!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly while he felt extremely shocked. Self-detonation? How terrifying was that? He’d experienced it for himself. The Weapon Progenitor’s self-detonation had almost killed him. If he didn’t possess numerous precious treasures, he would have died instead of just escaping with severe injuries. As for the people Tian Xiu mentioned, they were clearly existences whom the Weapon Progenitor couldn’t compare to. Yet they’d detonated themselves together, and the undying race’s patriarch was there too. So, it was extremely terrifying that Tian Xiu had been able to survive in the end!

Actually, when he heard up to this point, Yang Ye had a rough understanding of the void spirit race’s strength.

The void spirit race’s strength was absolutely inferior to the undying race, but because of Tian Xiu, they’d forcefully dragged down the entire undying race to their level. The undying race had clearly realized that, so they had sent out all their forces with the goal of killing Tian Xiu!

Once Tian Xiu lost, the void spirit race would be finished!

However, Tian Xiu had still severely injured the entire undying race in that battle and forced them to return to their own territory. Such strength… If it was just in terms of single combat, then perhaps only the Unfettered One could defeat her.

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu spoke softly, “Do you know why that sword cultivator didn’t fight me or the undying race’s patriarch?”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “He said the outcome would be the same!”

Tian Xiu chuckled, “Actually, he’s not wrong. Because both the undying race’s patriarch and I aren’t at our peak anymore. But he is at his peak. He wanted to wait until both of us recovered to our respective peak strength. Unfortunately, both the undying race and I don’t have that much time to wait until then. So, he left. He doesn’t want to fight us while we’re not at our peak.”

The Unfettered One!

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. He hadn’t forgotten that he would be having a battle with that fellow!

“Actually…” Meanwhile, Tian Xiu suddenly said, “I too would like to fight him. All those years ago, I searched the universe just to find experts to fight and break through beyond my limits. Unfortunately…”

The weak feared the strong, but the strong hoped to face the strong.

Because only by encountering someone stronger could one grow stronger!

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu suddenly asked, “Those friends of yours have gone to the endless black holes?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Yes. They will seize the opportunity when the undying race activates the formation.”

“That won’t work!” Tian Xiu shook her head, “They will die. Even all those who fled earlier will die!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Tian Xiu looked up into the sky and explained, “Those ten fellows from the undying race are still alive, so they’re definitely guarding the endless black holes. All of them will die while those 10 fellows are there!”

Yang Ye said, “I asked the Demonspawn to go with them. If Elder Yuan and the others are included, then with their strength and if we keep the top experts of the undying race busy here, then they should…”

“You’re wrong!” Tian Xiu suddenly interrupted him, “Those 10 fellows are the Undead Warriors of the undying race. Not to mention them, those 10 Undead Warriors can even kill you and An Nanjing.”

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly, “They are that strong?”

Tian Xiu spoke softly, “Many experts of my void spirit race died at their hands all those years ago. At that time, there were 20 of them, and I killed 10 of them myself. Go to them. Return if you can deal with those Undead Warriors; if you can’t, then find a way to escape!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he suddenly walked over to Tian Xiu. He gazed at the young girl who had a completely different disposition now, and he suddenly stretched out his hand and rubbed her little head, “A’Xiu, wait for me! Wait for me!”

Yang Ye turned around and vanished into the distance with An Nanjing.

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu stared blankly at the direction Yang Ye had left toward, and then she shook her head slightly, “I’m afraid I can’t.”
