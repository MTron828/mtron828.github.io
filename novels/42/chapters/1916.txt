Chapter 1917 – Just Come at Me! All of You!

Yang Ye and Nansi Yin watched as the hand rose from the ground, and then a head followed it.

Suddenly, Yang Ye swung his sword.

A sword howl resounded, and a ray of sword energy shot towards the head.

The head suddenly opened its eyes, and then a black palm grabbed Yang Ye’s sword energy!

Yang Ye’s sword energy was grabbed!

Grabbed by a bare hand!

The head cracked a smile in Yang Ye’s direction and squeezed.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s sword energy was obliterated.

A short while later, a man had crawled out from the ground. Needless to say, he was extremely ugly. His head was strangely shaped, his features didn’t seem human at all, and his limbs were like those of a dried corpse.

Yang Ye gazed at Nansi Yin, “Do you recognize him?”

She shook her head.

“You will soon!” Meanwhile, the man gazed at Nansi Yin and sized her up incessantly, “Tsk, tsk. How beautiful. It’ll definitely be awesome when I have my way with you later. Haha…”

Nansi Yin couldn’t help but frown when she heard what he said, and there was undisguised ghastly killing intent flickering within her eyes.

Meanwhile, the man chuckled, “I like doing women who think they’re high and mighty. Watching all of you like that below me…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “Who the hell didn’t keep his pants on and released such an embarrassment into the world?”

Pfft!

Nansi Yi chuckled when she heard him.

As for the man, a ferocious expression instantly appeared on his face. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly started walking towards the man, “To be honest, being ugly isn’t your fault, but showing yourself and disgusting others is your fault.”

“I’ll kill you!” He roared with rage, and then he appeared in front of Yang Ye before slamming his palm at Yang Ye’s chest.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted 300m away! Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Nansi Yin frowned at the sight of this. She hadn’t expected that man’s speed to be so fast that Yang Ye couldn’t even react to it.

Ridicule curled up on the corners of the man’s mouth, “Trash! You’re…”

His voice stopped abruptly because Yang Ye was completely fine.

Yang Ye patted his chest lightly and looked up at the man. Needless to say, the man’s speed was extremely good; unfortunately, his strength was too weak. He was much weaker than the black robed man from before, but his speed far surpassed the black robed man!

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath with the man. He just stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that shot forward.

The man vanished on the spot at the same time.

A moment later, the surroundings fell silent.

At this moment, Yang Ye was standing where the man had been a moment ago, and the man was standing where Yang Ye had been a moment ago.

They’d exchanged locations!

The man laughed with ridicule, “Competing with me in speed? Go drink a few more years of…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot again, and the man vanished as well. However, Yang Ye suddenly stopped while he moved swiftly, and it made the man’s expression changed drastically!

Because he noticed that a mysterious wave of energy had enveloped him. It made him slow down, and the rate he slowed down was increasing.

He was being suppressed!

The man was shocked. He hadn’t expected his speed to be suppressed! Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared in front of him, cracked a smile, and swung his sword at him.

“Brother Wan! Save me!” The man cried for help. Suddenly, a ray of black light shot out from afar. It was extremely swift, and its target was Yang Ye’s back.

However, Yang Ye ignored it and let it strike his back.

Bang!

Hiss!

At the same time that the black light struck Yang Ye’s back, the man in front of Yang Ye was sliced into two. However, Yang Ye was blasted away by the black light.

Yang Ye stopped around 300m away.

There was a pitch black palm print on his back.

Yang Ye turned around, and he saw a man not too far away from him. The man wore a gold and black robe, and he seemed to be around the age of 25. Something worth mentioning was that his eyes were dark violet.

Nansi Yin suddenly said, “He’s from the devil race!”

The devil race? Yang Ye sized up the man. It was the first time he’d met someone from the devil race in the large universe.

The man sized up Yang Ye and smiled, “Looks like you’re much stronger than I expected. According to my knowledge, you aren’t amongst the geniuses of the human race.”

Yang Ye replied, “I will be!”

The man chuckled, “True!” He gazed at Nansi Yin and continued, “I didn’t expect the Sage’s inheritance to fall into Miss Nansi’s hands. Unfortunately, the Nansi Clan is bound to be unable to keep it!”

Nansi Yin said, “You should be Wankong Yan, right?”

The man nodded, “Yes! Right, if you intend to threaten me with the Nansi Clan, then allow me to be honest. While it’s a large clan in the human race, in my devil race, or at least to my Wankong Clan, it isn’t a threat at all!”

Wan Kongyan smiled and continued, “Of course, my Wankong doesn’t want to make another enemy for no reason. So, why don’t you leave the inheritance behind and leave safely. It’s a win-win for all of us. Alright?”

Nansi Yin was about to speak when Wankong Yan gazed at Yang Ye, “I almost forgot about you. I presume you won’t listen to just a few words. So, I’ll repeat myself after I deal with him!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he started walking slowly in Yang Ye’s direction.

“Deal with me?” Yang Ye suddenly chuckled.

Wankong Yan asked, “What?”

Yang Ye smiled, “To be honest, even fighting 10 pieces of trash like you isn’t a problem for me!”

“10?” Wankong Yan suddenly roared with laughter. He laughed for a while before he gazed at Yang Ye, “That’s the biggest joke I’ve ever heard. Tell me, what exactly gave you such confidence?”

Yang Ye gazed at Nansi Yin, “Didn’t you want to know how strong I really am?”

She nodded in response.

Yang Ye smiled, “Unfortunately, you still won’t be able to!”

Nansi Yin asked, “Why?”

Yang Ye replied, “Just 30% of my strength is enough to deal with someone like him!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Wankong Yan when he appeared again. After that, he slammed his sword down.

The corners of Wankong Yan’s mouth curled up slightly. He was about to attack when a ball of flames swept out from Yang Ye. The flames flowed along Yang Ye and attached itself to Yang Ye’s sword.

A flaming sword!

The Divine Yin Flame!

Yang Ye hadn’t used the Divine Yin Flame for a long time. It was mainly because as his strength grew, he didn’t need to use external sources of strength to kill his enemies.

He didn’t want to constantly rely on external sources of strength, but it didn’t represent that he wouldn’t use them!

As soon as the Divine Yin Flame appeared, Wankong Yan’s expression changed drastically, and then a spear appeared in his grasp. A moment later, it emanated black light as it shot up into the air and stabbed at Yang Ye’s sword!

However, the black light was obliterated as soon as it touched the Divine Yin Flame.

The flaming sword descended.

Bang!

The space in the surroundings shook violently while a terrifying wave of energy surged out madly from the point of collision.

Bang!

A muffled explosion resounded from the wave of energy, and then a figure was blasted away.

It wasn’t Yang Ye but Wankong Yan!

Yang Ye didn’t give Wankong Yan a chance to catch his breath. As soon as Wankong Yan’s figure was blasted away, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

“Slash!” Yang Ye’s voice resounded.

As soon as he gave the command, a flaming ray of sword energy shot down from the sky. It seemed like a meteor falling from the starry sky, and it carried might capable of splitting the sky and cracking the earth!

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and then Wankong Yan was slammed far away.

At this moment, Wankong Yan’s entire body had cracked apart. Even his head had cracked open, and it seemed like a porcelain vase that had been struck by something. It was extremely horrifying.

Blood instantly covered Wankong Yan!

However, Yang Ye didn’t stop. He was in the air above Wankong Yan. He looked down at Wankong Yan and smiled fiercely, “A genius from the devil race? As far as I’m fucking concerned, geniuses are there to be trampled on!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye stabbed his flaming sword downwards at Wankong Yan!

Wankong Yan’s pupils constricted. He naturally wouldn’t just wait for death to arrive. So, a terrifying wave of black energy shot up into the air. However, the black energy was instantly obliterated upon coming into contact with the Divine Yin Flame.

Hiss!

A moment later, a sword stabbed into the top of Wankong Yan’s head.

Blood sprayed in all directions and Wankong Yan’s figure stiffened on the spot.

Yang Ye descended behind Wankong Yan, and then he waved his right hand. His sword caused blood to spray as it floated out of Wankong Yan and arrived on his right.

Yang Ye looked up at the sky, “This isn’t targeted at anyone, but if I’m to be honest, all of you are trash! Stop wasting time! Just come at me! All of you!”

Nansi Yin was stunned speechless.
