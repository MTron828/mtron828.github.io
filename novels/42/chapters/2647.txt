Chapter 2648 – Door!

A short while later, she withdrew her gaze and looked toward the distant river.

Yang Ye glanced at her and asked, “Can’t I?”

She said, “You want to use us to help you eliminate them, right?”

Yang Ye didn’t conceal his intentions and nodded, “Indeed.”

She gazed at him, “Do you know that if they see you, you may be the first to die!”

Yang Ye replied, “I know.”

She was quite puzzled, “Then why?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “I don’t have another choice! Don’t you know? They want to take Snowy, they want to kill me, and they want to kill my friends. But I’m sure you know how they have the numbers, and they are old geezers from Little Qi’s era. Tell me, how am I supposed to face them? Even begging for mercy won’t work!”

He glanced at her at this point, “I don’t have a better choice. So, I can only choose to take them down with me.”

She fell silent.

Yang Ye walked over to her, “If it wasn’t for being forced into a corner, would anyone be willing to take their enemies down with them?”

She spoke softly, “Have you thought about why you’re in such a situation?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I know. But did I do anything wrong?”

She gazed at him, and he said, “I presume slaughtering the Heaven Dao all those years ago wasn’t an easy task, right?”

She remained silent.

Yang Ye continued, “The Heaven Dao oppressed all of you, and why did you rise up in rebellion? If you hadn’t been driven into a corner, I presume all of you wouldn’t have risked your lives like that, right?”

She walked to the side and sat on a huge rock there, and then she withdrew a comb and started combing her hair, “Once you kill them, there may be even more people like them who start popping out. Moreover, allow me to be honest, it’s very difficult to say who’s right and wrong in this case. You possess the Sprite Progenitor while they possess strength. In this world where the strong reign supreme, it’s normal for them to desire to take your Sprite Progenitor, and your resistance is normal as well.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly because he felt like what she said didn’t make a difference.

She continued, “I understand the situation you’re in and how you feel. The stronger party is rarely able to reason with the weaker party.”

Yang Ye walked over to her, “I’ll be direct. I sought you out because I hope that you will give me guidance on what to do next.”

She grinned.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Yang Ye was dazed by this grin of hers.

The woman was breathtakingly gorgeous. If he were being honest, before he met her, he’d never imagined that such beauty existed in the world.

If she wasn’t absolutely strong, her presence in the world would probably cause quite a huge amount of trouble.

She was too strong, so anyone who targeted her would be courting death!

Yang Ye only took a moment to return to his senses, and then he moved his gaze away. The woman had a strange type of charm that seemed capable of drawing people to her. So, it was best to avoid looking at her for too long. Because he noticed that his Sword Heart wasn’t really useful before her.

Actually, Yang Ye didn’t have to do that. Because it was human nature to be fond of beauty. Everyone liked beautiful things. Of course, it was fine so long as no negative thoughts were aroused.

She said, “You want guidance?”

Yang Ye nodded, “If you’re willing!”

She grinned, and a sword appeared in her grasp. A moment later, she waved it lightly, and a door appeared near Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s expression became unprecedentedly solemn when he saw it.

The Desolate Emperor had died after entering this door that day!

Yang Ye glanced at her.

Does she want me to go inside?

She asked, “You don’t dare to go inside?”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Why?”

She shook her head, “I can’t tell you. Go inside, and if you can return alive, then I’ll give you the guidance you seek.”

Yang Ye asked, “What if I fail?”

She smiled, “It’s obvious. So why ask?”

He would die!

Yang Ye gazed at the door and fell silent.

She said, “There is nothing in this world that comes free. You must pay for everything you wish to obtain. If you do not wish to pay for it yet want it, then it’s greed. It usually doesn’t end well for people like that.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Can I make a small request?”

She smiled, “Let me hear it first!”

Yang Ye pointed at his chest, “There’s a pagoda in me. I hope that no matter what happens to me in there, you will keep everything within it safe. Alright?”

She remained silent.

Yang Ye smiled, “They should not bear responsibility for my actions, right?”

She shook her head, “No, they should.”

Yang Ye frowned, “Why?”

She said, “All your actions will bring all kinds of karma to those by your side. Allow me to be honest, if you fall into the hands of those people right now, do you think they will be kind to the people within that pagoda of yours?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

At this moment, he felt like his sword weighed a ton.

Moreover, both his shoulders felt really heavy.

Absolutely heavy!

She seemed capable of seeing through the heart as she said, “You chose to bear these responsibilities. It’s normal for them to feel quite heavy now. Do you know why that other sword cultivator is so strong? If you’re willing to give up everything, then once your sword isn’t bound by anything anymore, you can be as strong as him. When you lose, you gain. That sword cultivator gave up everything, and so his sword is unprecedentedly strong. If you choose to give up everything now and sever all ties, your sword won’t be inferior to him!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time and smiled, “Then would I still be me?”

He turned around and walked toward the door.

She watched him in silence.

Just like that, Yang Ye walked over to the door. He was about to go in when he suddenly stopped, and he gazed at her, “You’re not trying to kill me on purpose, right?”

It would be a lie if he said that he was confident.

The Desolate Emperor was that strong, yet he’d been obliterated after he went inside.

She grinned, “You can choose not to go inside.”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and went in.

Pitch black darkness greeted Yang Ye behind the door.

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly and walked forward. Some time later, he suddenly felt like there was something dazzling before him, so he slowly opened his eyes. There was a stone house before him.

There was a woman and young girl within the house.

Yang Ye’s eyes instantly became moist when he saw them.

They were his mother and sister.

The young girl was writing with an old and tattered set of brush and ink on the wooden table. As she wrote and wrote, she suddenly looked up at the woman who was patching up some clothes, “Mother, is Big Brother really an outer court disciple of the Sword Sect?”

The woman grinned, “He should be. Why? Do you want to go there too?”

The young girl hurriedly nodded, “I want to be with Big Brother!”

The woman smiled, “You can go once you grow up a little more.”

She puckered her lips and continued writing.

Around an hour later, the young girl had fallen asleep.

The woman sat by her bed and rubbed the young girl’s head, and then she spoke softly, “My husband, you said you’re going to deal with something linked to Ye’er’s life… But it has been over a dozen years. Why haven’t I heard from you?”

Meanwhile, the young girl kicked down her blanket.

The woman tucked her daughter in and said, “Ye’er is all grown up now, and he’s very sensible and responsible. However, he’s very stubborn like an ox, and I’m very worried about him. I’m afraid he’ll get worse once I’m gone.”

She paused for a moment at this point and continued, “I’m even more afraid that when the two of you finally meet, Ye’er will be very displeased with you. Based on his character…”

A short while later, she stood up and walked over to the door. She gazed in the direction of the Sword Sect, “Ye’er…”

In the darkness, Yang Ye just watched her while tears kept flowing down his face.

The scene before him gradually vanished, and it didn’t take long for another scene to appear before him.

It was a bamboo house.

The house was empty, and the portrait of a woman was on its wall.

A middle aged man was standing before the portrait.

The middle aged man wore an elegant robe, his hair hung loosely to his shoulders, and his hands were behind his back. He stood facing the portrait while boundless affection and longing filled his eyes.

A long time passed before a voice came from outside the door, “Dean…”

The middle aged man said, “Speak!”

The voice said, “I’m sorry, I was too late. Your wife…”

The middle aged man’s hands were instantly clenched tight, “Speak!”

The voice paused for a moment and said, “She’s gone.”

The middle aged man’s figure stiffened, and then two streams of clear tears gradually seeped out from the corners of his eyes.

A short while later, the voice said, “Should I bring the young master and young miss back?”

The middle aged man shook his head, “That isn’t necessary.”

The voice said, “I don’t understand!”

The middle aged man said, “If I be cruel to him now, he’ll have a greater chance of surviving in the future.”

The voice fell silent for a moment and said, “Should I annihilate the Flower Palace?”

The middle aged man shook his head, “A mother’s revenge should naturally be done by the son!”

The middle aged man walked over to the portrait and caressed it gently, “Yu’er, I won’t make you wait for too long. I’ll come keep you company once Ye’er is all grown up!”

The middle aged man turned around and walked out of the bamboo house.

A moment later, a ray of light surged up into outer space. At the same time, a voice resounded through the boundless reaches of space, “The Unfettered One, come here and fight me!”
