Chapter 1690 - Great Karma And Great Karmic Luck!

Bang!

A vicious aura swept out from Yang Ye, and then a demon beast appeared before him.

Qiong Qi!

He had no choice but to summon Qiong Qi right now. Because his own strength was utterly insufficient to deal with so many experts.

Once Qiong Qi appeared, he glanced at the surroundings, and then his expression changed, “Kid, I knew it wouldn’t be anything good!”

Yang Ye shrugged, “What else can I do? I have no other choice!”

“No choice my ass!” Qiong Qi shouted angrily, and then his body suddenly started trembling. After that, his body grew larger and larger while the aura he emanated grew stronger and stronger. In the blink of an eye, he was five times larger than he had been!

Once he grew larger, Qiong Qi roared at the experts around them.

Bang!

A powerful and vicious aura swept out, and the Zenith Realm experts in the surroundings were blasted extremely far away. As for the True Realm experts, they were pushed around 300m back as well.

The expressions of everyone here changed.

Yang Shen stared fixedly at Qiong Qi, “A ferocious beast!” He hadn’t expected that Yang Ye would actually still have a trump card, and it was a powerful ferocious beast.

He wasn’t the only one! The entire Yang Clan hadn’t expected this!

Yang Ye’s figure shook slightly, and the arrows in him were pushed out of him, causing over a dozen little fountains of blood to spray from him. Yang Ye paid no attention to the injuries. After all, he had Primordial Violet Energy to slowly heal them.

He glanced at the surroundings, and then he flashed onto Qiong Qi’s back, “Don’t get entangled in combat! Let’s kill our way out!”

It made no difference no matter how many people he killed today. Because it was impossible for him to annihilate the entire Yang Clan.

Flee!

His goal was to flee from Heaven Void Continent and flee from the scope of the Yang Clan’s forces. Only then would he be able to survive.

“You think I don’t know?!” Qiong Qi spoke angrily. He was extremely unhappy because every single time Yang Ye summoned him, it was never for anything good. Moreover, every single time was more dangerous than the last.

Just like this very moment. Even though he was a ferocious beast from the large universe of Milky Way System, it didn’t represent that he could crush the experts of this universe. After all, the people before him were part of the strongest group of people in this universe. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Flee?” Meanwhile, a wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of Yang Shen’s mouth, “You think you can flee when you’re in my Yang Clan’s territory?”

He gazed at Qiong Qi and continued, “If you intend to rely on it, then all I can say is that you’re dreaming. Not to mention one ferocious beast, even if you had five, my Yang Clan would still be able to kill them all!”

“The Yang Clan?” Qiong Qi’s voice carried a trace of ridicule, “Is your Yang Clan full of idiots? This kid possesses great karmic luck, and your clan’s future would be limitless. You’ll even have a chance to be ranked amongst the immortals and gods of the large universe. But all of you insist on killing him. All of you are truly idiots!”

“Immortals or gods?” A cold smile curled up on the corners of Yang Shen’s mouth, “What the heck is that? How laughable! Does my Yang Clan even need to rely on him? How truly laughable!”

“You’re the laughable one! Idiot!” Qiong Qi cursed, “You idiots! This kid doesn’t just possess great karmic luck, there’s great karma with him. If your Yang Clan kills him, your clan is going to suffer horribly. No, if he dies, your Yang Clan is finished.”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye couldn’t help but pat Qiong Qi’s back and asked, “Brother Qiong Qi, will someone really avenge me if I die?”

“What do you think?!” Qiong Qi spoke angrily, “You’re not like your father. That thing didn’t acknowledge your father, but it acknowledged you. Moreover, that existence didn’t refuse you and even asked you to take that little girl home. That proves that he acknowledged you. Do you know what that represents? It represents that you possess a huge group of fucking powerful backing!”

“A huge group?” Yang Ye was stunned, “A huge group my ass! I’m on the verge of death, so why aren’t they here? Just one would be enough!”

Qiong Qi suddenly fell silent.

Two breaths of time passed before he spoke again, “Based on that existence’s strength, he should be aware that you’ve arrived at Milky Way System. Since he hasn’t shown himself, he’s either in closed door cultivation or has been delayed by something. In any case, there’s nothing to fear. If you die, someone will avenge you. But if I die, who will avenge me?! In these years that I’ve known you, it has been the worst years of my life and the unluckiest years.”

Yang Ye smiled with embarrassment. He was quite embarrassed indeed. Since Qiong Qi had been by his side, Qiong Qi had almost died on many occasions. However, he couldn’t do anything about it!

“Cut the crap!” Meanwhile, Yang Shen spoke furiously, “None of you can escape today.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he was about to attack. But Yang Ye suddenly patted Qiong Qi on the back, “Let’s not fight and just retreat first.”

Qiong Qi nodded slightly, and then he leaped up and shot towards the sky while carrying Yang Ye on his back.

He was swift!

Qiong Qi was absolutely swift!

Because Yang Ye felt like his body was on the verge of being torn apart, and it was the consequence of moving too fast.

A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of Yang Shen’s mouth when he saw Yang Ye and Qiong Qi fleeing. Both he and the others around him didn’t do anything.

Right when Qiong Qi and Yang Ye were about to charge out of Heaven Void Continent, a voice suddenly came from far away in the starry sky, “Go back there!”

As soon as the voice finished resounding, an ethereal towering mountain suddenly appeared above Yang Ye and Qiong Qi. The powerful pressure it emanated caused Yang Ye and Qiong Qi to stop on the spot.

The mountain stopped on the spot for a moment, and then it suddenly descended again.

Yang Ye’s expression changed. Meanwhile, Qiong Qi leaped up and slammed himself against the huge mountain.

Bang!

The huge mountain exploded into pieces, but Yang Ye and Qiong Qi were blasted to the ground. It didn’t take long for them to crash into Phecda City.

Bang!

The entire city shook violently like there was an earthquake!

Yang Shen laughed coldly, “Flee? Where will you flee?”

Qiong Qi said, “Kid, we can’t escape. What should we do now?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he looked up at Yang Shen, “Let’s kill him first.”

“Not a problem!” As soon as he finished speaking, Qiong Qi pounced at Yang Shen.

Yang Shen’s face changed when he saw Yang Ye and Qiong Qi attack. He flipped his left palm and a saber appeared in his grasp. After that, he swung it swiftly. A brilliant ray of saber energy carried a powerful aura as it flashed out from the tip of his saber.

Qiong Qi naturally didn’t try to dodge it. He just raised his claw and slapped the saber energy.

Bang!

As soon as they came into contact, Yang Shen’s saber energy was instantly torn apart. At the same time, Qiong Qi instantly arrived before Yang Shen.

Yang Shen’s expression changed drastically, and he immediately swung his saber again.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded. The saber in Yang Shen’s grasp was slapped into pieces, and the powerful force within Qiong Qi’s claw caused a mouthful of blood to spray from Yang Shen’s mouth while his figure was blasted over 10km away.

Right when Yang Ye and Qiong Qi were about to attack again, a spear suddenly arrived before Qiong Qi’s back. Yang Ye raised his sword and swung it.

Bang!

The spear exploded apart, and then around 30 arrows suddenly descended from the sky. At the same time, the Zenith Realm experts around them pressed forward and surrounded them again.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. In the end, he gazed at the archers in the sky, “Kill them!”

The archers were the most troublesome. Because they were very good at finding opportune moments to shoot an arrow at him. That wasn’t even the most troublesome part, the most troublesome part was that they could pierce through his physical defenses.

Qiong Qi slammed his claws against the ground upon hearing Yang Ye.

Bang!

He relied on the counterforce to transform into a black ray of light that shot towards the Green Armor Unit. They ignored all the other cultivators around them as they charged at the Green Armor Unit, and Yang Ye slashed anyone that stood in their way. No one could resist a swing of Yang Ye’s sword!

Yang Shen hurriedly said, “Stop them!”

As soon as he gave the order, both he and the other old man at the True Realm instantly charged after Yang Ye and Qiong Qi.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Keep them busy!”

As he spoke, he tapped his right foot against Qiong Qi’s back, and then he transformed into a black shadow that vanished on the spot. He was amongst the archers when he appeared once more, and then countless rays of flaming sword energy swept out towards the surroundings.

It was a slaughter!

Yang Ye had immediately started to slaughter them upon charging into the group.

Those archers were extremely strong when executing ranged attacks, but their melee combat ability was quite weak. So, they couldn’t stop Yang Ye at all. However, the members of the Mounted Unit and Golden Spear Unit had immediately rushed over and surrounded Yang Ye. As for the surviving archers, they created distance between themselves and Yang Ye again.

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi was keeping the True Realm experts busy. Qiong Qi had extraordinary physical defenses and extreme speed, so he’d forcefully kept both of them locked in combat with him.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye swung his sword over and over again. Every single attack would either injure or kill one of his opponents. In just a short while, less than 30 of the 72 warriors remained. However, Yang Ye was injured again. His chest, knee, and shoulders had many golden arrows stuck in them.

However, it didn’t bother him at all, and he was still killing like a madman!

Suddenly, Yang Shen looked up and said, “Are you still not going to help? Do you insist on watching us die?”

A moment of silence ensued, and then a voice came from above, “We just didn’t expect that two True Realm experts and the 72 warriors wouldn’t be able to kill a single Rebirth Realm cultivator.

Bang!
