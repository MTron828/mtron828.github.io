Chapter 1341 – The Only Way To Survive!

As soon as she fought Yang Ye, the Demon Empress understood that her current strength wasn’t capable of doing anything to Yang Ye. There was only one way to restrain Yang Ye, and it was to capture Zi’er and Snowy. She’d investigated him, and she knew that Yang Ye really cared for Zi’er and Snowy. So long as she captured them, she would definitely be able to restrain Yang Ye!

When she saw the Demon Empress attack, Zi’er was prepared to take Snowy with her and flee. However, she couldn’t move. She knew that it was the Laws of Time.

The Laws of Time were something that she couldn’t resist at all. She could only watch helplessly as the Demon Empress’ whip descended towards her and Snowy.

Snowy’s eyes had instantly opened wide when she saw the whip descend, and then she transformed into a ray of white light that went into the folds of Zi’er’s clothes, before her chest. But it didn’t take long for Snowy’s head to emerge again, and then she scratched Zi’er’s face as if she was telling Zi’er to run. However, Zi’er didn’t react at all.

At this moment, Snowy became anxious. Because the whip was less than 30m away from her and Zi’er.

Snowy’s delicate figure trembled violently without end while her head shivered slightly. Obviously, she was extremely afraid. She wanted to hide, but she didn’t want to leave Zi’er behind.

So afraid, so conflicted, so hesitant... and so angry!

It didn’t take long for the whip to arrive just around 10m away from Zi’er’s head. The powerful force it carried caused the walls of Doomsday City to start cracking apart. As for the target of the whip, Zi’er’s face had turned ghastly pale.

Suddenly, Snowy raised her head and looked at the Demon Empress. At this moment, her hairs were standing on end. It was partially from her fear, but also because of her rage.

Snowy gnashed her teeth and glared angrily at the Demon Empress. When the whip was less than 3m away from them, Snowy suddenly placed her claws on her stomach and took a deep breath. A moment later, her figure shuddered before she opened her mouth and spat.

Bang!

A pure white pillar of spirit energy shot out from her mouth. It wasn’t very large and just around 3m thick. However, it was extremely pure. The spirit energy within it was completely solid, and it wasn’t exaggerated to call it a crystal pillar. The pillar of spirit energy shot up into the air and slammed against the Demon Empress’ whip.

The Demon Empress hadn’t expected Snowy to do that, so she was caught off guard and struck by the pillar of spirit energy.

Bang!

An explosion resounded while the Demon Empress was pushed around 300m back!

Snowy blinked when she saw that she’d pushed the Demon Empress back, and then she shook her head. After that, she pressed her claws against her stomach again, and it didn’t take long for her mouth to swell up again.

The Demon Empress glanced at her whip, and then glanced at Snowy. Disbelief filled her eyes as she said, “How could this be possible? You actually disregarded the Laws of Time.”

Bang!

Meanwhile, Snowy spat out another pillar of spirit energy. But this time, it had only just been spat out when the Demon Empress’ whip shattered it. After that, the whip didn’t slow down at all as it descended towards Zi’er and Snowy.

Snowy blinked, and then she covered her eyes.

Right when the whip was about to strike them, a ray of blood red light tore through the air and instantly slammed against the whip.

Bang!

The fine Void Rank whip was instantly blasted into pieces, and the powerful force of the collision pushed the Demon Empress back repeatedly. She was pushed around 300m back!

The Demon Empress’ face fell when she saw Yang Ye arrive.

Yang Ye gazed at Snowy who had closed her eyes while trembling incessantly, and his heart hurt. He rubbed her head gently and spoke in a gentle tone, “It’s fine. It’s fine now. Don’t be afraid. It’s fine now.”

Snowy moved her claws away when she heard Yang Ye, and then she looked up at him. As soon as she saw Yang Ye, she immediately pounced into his arms and her tears surged out incessantly like torrents. In less than a breath of time, Yang Ye’s entire body was covered in a layer of white mist. It was Snowy’s tears, of course!

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head, and then he gazed at Zi’er and the others. At this moment, the Laws of Time had been suppressed by his Sword Domain and had vanished. So, everyone in the surroundings had returned to normal.

Zi’er spoke softly, “Be careful!”

Yang Ye nodded. He was about to pass Snowy to Zi’er, but Snowy was holding tightly onto him and refused to let go.

Yang Ye smiled and said, “Snowy, let go now. I’ll go avenge you, alright?”

Snowy looked up at Yang Ye, and then her eyes that were filled with tears of spirit energy blinked and blinked. A short while passed before she nodded, and then she let go of Yang Ye.

After he passed Snowy back to Zi’er, Yang Ye turned around and looked towards the distance. The Demon Empress had returned to the army of demon beasts. Yang Ye’s eyes instantly turned icy cold when he gazed at her. If Snowy hadn’t attacked at the critical moment, Snowy and Zi’er would probably be gone!

As soon as he thought about that, Yang Ye’s face gradually became ferocious. Zi’er and Snowy were his ‘reverse scale’, and anyone who touched them had to die!

This time, he didn’t waste his breath at all. He stomped his foot against the ground, and his figure transformed into a ray of light shot off from the walls of Doomsday City.

The ray of light shot through the sky and went straight for the Demon Empress!

The Demon Empress’ eyes narrowed slightly on the Cloud Eagle’s back, and she had an extremely solemn expression on her face. Yang Ye’s strength at the Emperor Realm had completely surpassed her imagination. Especially when he possessed the Sword Domain. Her Laws of Time were utterly useless before him. So, she didn’t dare act carelessly. Of course, it was impossible for her to flee, and she had no choice but to fight!

Because if she fled or avoided fighting Yang Ye, then the demon race’s morale would plummet.

Bang!

A terrifying aura suddenly surged out from within her. At the same time, she tapped her right foot down slightly, and then her figure transformed into a ray of light that shot up into the air and collided with Yang Ye.

Bang!

As soon as they collided, the sky shook violently, and then a wave of deafening rumbling resounded through the sky. Countless waves of energy and sword energy shot out incessantly in all directions. Wave after wave swept out in all directions and covered the entire sky.

However, the battle didn’t just stop there. Loud explosions were resounding incessantly from amidst the waves of energy in the sky.

While Yang Ye and the Demon Empress fought, the army of humans and demon beasts didn’t stand by idly. Countless demon beasts covered the sky and the ground as they surged towards Doomsday City. As for the army of humans, they were naturally fighting with all their might.

At this moment, it was the final battle between the human race and demon race. It was especially so for the human race. They could only win this battle. Because if they lost, they wouldn’t even have a chance to change their fate.

Survival!

The only way to survive was to win!

As for the demon race, they just had to win this battle, and then only the demon race would be left on Dark Hell Continent. The demon race would become the sole owner of Dark Hell Continent!

Regardless of whether it was the human race or demon race, this battle was of the utmost importance to them!

On the city walls of Doomsday City, Zi’er who stood by Ye Liuyun’s side spoke in a low voice, “Should we activate the sword formation?”

Ye Liu Yun shook her head and said, “It isn’t time yet.” As she spoke, she pointed at one of the groups of demon beasts, “See those demon beasts?”

Zi’er looked down towards the group Ye Liuyun was pointing at. It was a group of pythons that were huge like mountains. There were around 200 of them, and all of them were at the Emperor Realm.

After that, Ye Liuyun pointed at the sky on both sides of Doomsday City, “See that? Those flying troops haven’t even attacked yet. They are waiting for an opportunity. Once the opportune moment arrives, they’ll strike a lethal blow to us. Our sword formation has to be used at that moment. Otherwise, we’ll definitely suffer a blow that we can’t endure!”

Zi’er nodded. Meanwhile, Ye Liuyun suddenly looked up at the sky and said, “If the outcome of their battle is decided in advance, then the outcome of the battle between the human race and demon race will be decided as well.”

Zi’er looked up at the sky. Yang Ye was at the Emperor Realm, so she wasn’t afraid of his safety, and she was worried about Doomsday City instead. If the demon race’s army destroyed the city before Yang Ye could defeat the Demon Empress, then the human race would be truly finished. No matter how strong Yang Ye was, it was impossible for him to stop the entire army of demon beasts.

After all, even the army of millions of demon beasts just stood there for Yang Ye to kill them, he would probably take a few years to annihilate them!

The human race’s desperate resistance allowed their army to stop the attack of the demon race’s army over and over again. However, the human race suffered heavy losses as well. Corpses were piling up outside the city walls and on the city walls as well. Similarly, the demon race had lost many demon beasts, but they were quite few when compared to the human race’s losses.

Bang!

Suddenly, rumbling resounded in the sky. Everywhere watched as the space in the sky cracked apart, and then 2 figures appeared before them. It was Yang Ye and the Demon Empress.

The Demon Empress looked at Yang Ye with a cold and indifferent gaze. She seemed to be completely fine on the surface, but she’d lost half of her palms that were concealed within her sleeves.

Yang Ye was holding Heaven’s Gravestone. There were no injuries on him as well, and there was just a trace of scarlet red on the corner of his mouth. He glanced at the battle below, and then his heart sank. At this moment, the human race was in quite a worrying situation.

He wanted to deal with the Demon Empress as soon as possible. Because so long as he killed her, the army of demon beasts would naturally retreat in defeat. However, the Demon Empress refused to risk her life against him, and she was just keeping him busy and avoiding direct collisions.

The Demon Empress was buying time!

Meanwhile, the Demon Empress suddenly spoke in a low voice, “I should have done whatever it took to kill you that day!” That day, she’d let Yang Ye leave because she wanted to use him against the Nie Clan, and she’d gotten her wish. Yang Ye had crippled the entire Nie Clan. Yet now, Yang Ye had advanced to the Emperor Realm, and she was facing an even stronger Yang Ye.

At this moment, Yang Ye’s strength wasn’t inferior to her at all, and it might have even surpassed her.

Yang Ye didn’t speak, and the profound energy within him surged. It was meaningless no matter what they said right now. Now, only fighting could resolve things!

Meanwhile, the Demon Empress suddenly said, “Fortunately, I kept a trump card!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she waved her right hand.
