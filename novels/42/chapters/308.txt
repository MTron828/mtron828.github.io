Chapter 309 – Madman Huang!

It wasn’t just Ying Long, even the expressions of Mo Ke and Hun You had become extremely solemn!

After a short while, Mo Ke exclaimed abruptly. “A Spatial Mink!”

“Indeed!” said Hun You.

The two of them exchanged glances, and then they gazed at Ying Long. They hoped to obtain an even more accurate answer from him!

Ying Long took a deep breath, and then he turned around and said to a young man from the Azure Dragon Clan. “Quickly return to the demon territory, and then head to the Unreal Dimension. Tell them their Young Princess has appeared!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and gazed at Hun You and Mo Ke before he said, “Allow me to give you a word of advice. Both of you better not touch a single hair on that violet mink! Otherwise, both of you’re dead even if your Devil Exalt and Nether God are alive!”

Mo Ke and Hun You didn’t retort or get angry when they heard this, and they nodded with solemn expressions instead!

It could be said that not a single force on Profounder Continent dared to offend that clan on their own!

After a short while, Mo Ke and the others withdrew their gazes, fell silent for a moment, and then walked into Ancient Domain City.

.......

The Demon Territory.

There was a mysterious barrier in the space above the extreme north of the demon territory. The space around the barrier was layered and warped, so nothing could come close to the surroundings of the barrier. Moreover, merely approaching it would cause one to be minced into pieces and transform into nothingness! This barrier led to a single place, and it was the Unreal Dimension!

The Unreal Dimension was an existence that stood aloof in the demon territory because the Spatial Mink Clan resided here! The Spatial Mink Clan didn’t participate in the affairs of the world and was merely fond of exploring the secrets of space. They were capable of all sorts of spatial techniques, and these techniques were mysterious and formidable! It could be said that any clan including the ancient divine beasts like the Divine Gold Dragon Clan, the Skyhowl Qilin Clan, the Heavenly Phoenix Clan, and even various overlord level clans of the demon territory were unwilling to offend the Spatial Mink Clan!

Why? Because if one were to offend this clan, then they could only receive beatings passively forever! After all, the Spatial Mink Clan could travel through space at will! Moreover, their spatial techniques were extremely terrifying as well.

In short, in the demon territory... No, it should be said that there wasn’t a single power throughout Profounder Continent that dared to rashly offend them! Or perhaps it could be said that the others would thank the gods and would be extremely grateful so long as the Spatial Mink Clan didn’t offend them!

At this moment, in an extremely luxurious hall within the Unreal Dimension. A middle aged man and a beautiful middle aged woman were sitting face to face. The woman was extremely beautiful, but there was faint worry on her face, and it caused her peerless beauty to diminish slightly.

The middle aged man sighed lightly and said, “Qingrou, don’t worry. I’ve already asked Xiao Tianji to make a prediction. Not only will Zi’er be fine, she’ll even obtain extraordinary fortune! You should be clearly aware of Xiao Tianji’s ability. Since he said that, then Zi’er will definitely be fine!”

The beautiful woman shook her head lightly and said, “Even though it’s like that, I’m still worried. You know Zi’er’s character well. She’s playful and willful. It’s fine in the demon territory because those fellows would more or less give us some face! But if she has gone to the human world, then with the greed of the humans.... I... truly don’t dare to continue on this train of thought!”

“Hmph!” The middle aged man grunted coldly, and then he said with a fierce tone, “If the humans dare to harm even a hair on my Zi’er, then I’ll slaughter the entire human race even if I have to suffer the wrath of the heavens!”

Right at this moment, a wave of spatial fluctuation arose in the hall, and then a young man appeared here. The young man bowed to the middle aged man before he said excitedly, “Mink Emperor, the Princess has shown herself!”

“What!?” The middle aged man and beautiful woman instantly stood up when they heard this....

......

On the back of the Lightning Eagle, Ji Yanshi squatted down to touch the Lightning Eagle’s feathers, and then he exclaimed with admiration. “A flying Darkbeast at the peak of the King Rank. Tsk, tsk. I never imagined that I, Ji Yanshi, would actually be able to ride on the back of a peak King Rank Darkbeast one day. Haha!”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “Thank you for before!”

Yang Ye was sincerely grateful to this young man. Even though he would have still been fine if the young man hadn’t lent him a hand, he really appreciated it!

Ji Yanshi waved his hand and said, “You don’t have to thank me. I didn’t act because I wanted to help you, I merely couldn’t bear the sight of Mo Ke and those other fellows acting arrogantly!”

When he spoke up to here, Ji Yanshi sized Yang Ye up from top to bottom, and then he said, “According to rumor, you’ve attained the Enlightened Sword Heart. Is it true?”

Yang Ye smiled, and then he nodded!

Ji Yanshi’s eyes narrowed slightly before he suddenly slashed at Yang Ye with his sword. A strand of sword qi shot violently towards Yang Ye!

Yang Ye wasn’t surprised by this, and he only drew his sword and stabbed lightly at a certain point on that strand of sword qi after it had arrived in front of him! In an instant, the strand of sword qi was like a balloon that had been stabbed by a pin, and it exploded with a loud bang!

“You believe me now?” said Yang Ye as he sheathed his sword.

Ji Yanshi’s expression turned solemn, and then he took a deep glance at Yang Ye before he said, “You’ve actually really attained the Enlightened Sword Heart. The Enlightened Sword Heart.... Moreover, you even possess 5th level Sword Intent. How could a monstrous genius like you appear in the southern territory? This is unusual!”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Just that is already unusual? Didn’t the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor come from the southern territory all those years ago? Moreover, don’t look down on the southern territory. There are all sorts of experts hidden there!”

“Don’t tell me that you’re a disciple of the Sword Sect!” Ji Yanshi said, “If it’s true, then isn’t the Sword Sect a little too lucky!?”

Yang Ye shrugged and stated. “I’m just an independent cultivator!”

Ji Yanshi instantly opened his eyes wide with disbelief, and he said, “You said you’re an independent cultivator?”

Yang Ye nodded.

“You’re really an independent cultivator?”

Yang Ye nodded once more!

“You’re sure that you’re an independent cultivator? And you don’t belong to any sect?”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched, and he felt the impulse to draw his sword and cut Ji Yanshi!

Meanwhile, Ji Yanshi suddenly shouted. “Put me down!”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he said, “Why?”

“Cut the crap! Hurry up!” Ji Yanshi had become slightly agitated.

Yang Ye nodded when he noticed that Ji Yanshi seemed to have something urgent to attend to. After that, he commanded the Lightning Eagle to descend to the ground. After they descended to the ground, Ji Yanshi flipped his wrist, and then a talisman appeared in his hand. He didn’t hesitate to toss it into the sky.

The talisman expanded in the air, and then a wave of violent spatial fluctuations arose around the Talisman. After that, traces of pitch black rifts had gradually stretched out from the talisman....

As he watched this scene, Yang Ye asked with an astounded expression. “What’re you doing?” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Ji Yanshi grinned. Right when he was about to say something, a furious shout suddenly resounded from within the pitch black rift. “Stinking Kid! Have you caused some sort of trouble that you’re unable to deal with again? You actually utilized a Teleportation Talisman! Don’t you know that they’re very expensive?”

As soon as these words finished resounding, an old man who carried a silver sword chest on his back flashed out from within the pitch black rift.

When he saw the old man, Ji Yanshi seemed as if he hadn’t noticed the furious expression on the old man’s face. He walked over to the old man, and then he pointed at Yang Ye and said excitedly, “Madman Huang! Quickly take a look at him!”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye before he withdrew his gaze, and then he suddenly slapped Ji Yanshi on the head and said angrily, “You’re actually unable to deal with a fellow at the fifth rank of the King Realm? Moreover, you were even forced to utilize a Transportation Formation? How... how could you be so useless? Don’t tell anyone you’re a disciple of the Divine Sword Sect from now on!”

Ji Yanshi rolled his eyes and said, “Madman Huang, look again! Carefully!”

“Look my ass! Isn’t he just a profounder at the fifth rank of the King Realm?” The old man slapped Ji Yanshi on the head once more. However, he’d still shot his gaze towards Yang Ye. This time, the old man’s gaze was frozen!

The old man’s eyes narrowed as he spoke in a low voice. “A deep aura, the glow of the sword hidden in the depths of the gaze, a sword that held at a low angle. Kid, you’ve actually attained the advanced-stage of Sword Intent!”

Yang Ye’s heart shook. This old man’s strength is really terrifying. He was actually able to discern that I’ve comprehended 6th level Sword Intent with a single glance! Such strength....

“The advanced-stage of Sword Intent?” Ji Yanshi was stunned, and then he said, “Madman Huang, are you mistaken? He’s clearly at the 5th level of Sword Intent! Why is it suddenly the 6th level now?”

“Are you an idiot!?” Madman Huang glared at Ji Yanshi, and then he gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Kid, you’ve attained the 6th level of the Sword Intent at such a young age. You really aren’t simple! Come, tell me which sect you’re from, and allow me to see exactly which sect was actually capable of fostering such a genius in the Sword Dao that even this idiot from my Divine Sword Sect can’t compare to you!”

Ji Yanshi’s face darkened, and he said, “He doesn’t belong to a sect. He’s an independent cultivator. I brought you over here so that you can recruit this monstrous genius before the other sects seize him!”

“What?” Madman Huang was stunned, and then he said with an excited tone, “He doesn’t belong to a sect? An independent cultivator? Kid, is what this idiot said the truth?”

Yang Ye was speechless.

“Kid, do you really not belong to any sect?” asked Madman Huang once more.

Yang Ye had no choice but to nod.

When he saw Yang Ye nod, Madman Huang’s figure instantly vanished on the spot and appeared in front of Yang Ye. After that, he grabbed both of Yang Ye’s shoulder and said in an excited tone, “Kid, join my Divine Sword Sect! My Divine Sword Sect is an Eighth Rank Sect. So long as you join it, then cultivation techniques, combat techniques, Dark Treasures, women.... I’ll give you anything you want. Alright?”

Yang Ye was speechless again.

Meanwhile, Ji Yanshi reminded. “Madman Huang, you’ll scare him if you act like that!”

Madman Huang seemed to realize that he was too excited when he heard Ji Yanshi. He immediately smiled with an embarrassed expression, and then he let go of Yang Ye’s shoulders and coughed lightly two times. “Err... Kid, Heaven Rank cultivation techniques, Heaven Rank treasures, and peerless beauties. You can choose as you please. What do you think? Come, join my Divine Sword Sect and all of them will be yours!”

“Madman Huang, he seems to have got himself in some trouble....” Meanwhile, Ji Yanshi warned. “He seemed to be....”

Ji Yanshi hadn’t finished speaking when Madman Huang waved his hand and interrupted Ji Yanshi. He said with heroic spirit, “Trouble? When have I, Madman Huang, been afraid of trouble? Kid, so long as you’re willing to join my Divine Sword Sect, then I’ll protect you even if you abduct the daughters of the Sect Masters of those three Ninth Rank Sects!”
