Chapter 1064 – You’ll Die If You Be Friends With Me!

Lady’s beautiful brows were pressed together slightly when she heard Yang Ye, and she just gazed at him in silence.

Yang Ye said, “Can’t I?”

She walked over to him and said, “I knew you possessed the Sword Domain since the beginning, and I know that you haven’t mastered it. However, I never spoke about it. Do you know why?”

He shook his head in response.

Lady stretched out her hand and tapped Yang Ye’s chest, “You’re like a 3 year old child right now, yet you possess strength that surpasses the endurance of your body. So, every single time you utilize the Sword Domain, I presume that you probably pay an extremely heavy price. Right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “My lifespan is practically exhausted every time I utilize it!”

Lady withdrew her hand, “Your luck is very good!”

Yang Ye was puzzled.

Meanwhile, she continued, “Your luck is naturally extremely good because you are still alive after utilizing a Domain like you have!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

She said, “Domains surpass intents, and they surpass the Laws as well. But at the same time, they are the most difficult to master. Even I have only gained superficial mastery over my Domain.”

Yang Ye was shocked, “You... you haven’t truly mastered your Domain?”

“Domains encompass time, space, rebirth, karma, the universe, the essence of all things, the essence of life, the essence of the universe, and various other mysterious existences that we aren’t aware of. So, a person would probably be unable to truly master a Domain in an entire lifetime.” She gazed at Yang Ye when she spoke up to this point, “To put it in simpler terms, a Domain is comprehension. It’s comprehension of the Dao. Every single Domain is different. Your Domain is a Domain you comprehended from the sword, so if you want to master the Sword Domain, then you have to improve your attainments in the Sword Dao!”

Yang Ye spoke with slight embarrassment, “My... my accomplishments in the Sword Dao should be not bad!”

The corners of her mouth twitched slightly, but it was hidden very well, and she returned to normal in just a moment. She gazed at Yang Ye for a while before she shook her head slightly, “Your Sword Dao is merely child’s play!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

Lady said, “In a world you don’t know, an expert once killed his enemy with a single swing of his sword from a few dozen worlds away. His attack disregarded the obstruction of space and those worlds, and it even severed the restrictions of time. Yet you haven’t even fully comprehended space, let alone an ethereal existence like time!”

That expert killed his enemy from a few dozen worlds away! Yang Ye slowly clenched his fists, “Is there really such a powerful sword cultivator in this world?”

She looked him in the eyes and said, “There are even stronger existences!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and laughed bitterly, “I was looking at the world from the bottom of a well.”

“Your Domain was comprehended from the sword, and its essence is different from mine. Moreover, my own comprehensions aren’t suitable for you. Everyone has their own path, and my path doesn’t suit you. So, if you want to master your Sword Domain, then the only way is to improve your attainments in the Sword Dao. Improving your attainments in the Sword Dao isn’t related to the cultivation of those so-called sword techniques, it’s related to comprehension. Comprehension of the world, all things within it, and the universe.”

Lady slowly closed her eyes when she spoke up to this point, and a short while passed before she opened her eyes to gaze at Yang Ye, “The world is huge, and we are tiny. You must remember these words of mine.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I won’t become complacent from my trivial accomplishments!” As soon as he finished speaking, he gazed at her and continued, “Actually, we’ve known each other for quite some time, but I still don’t know your name.”

Lady didn’t answer him.

Yang Ye asked, “Can’t you tell me?”

A long time passed before she spoke, “I have no intention to look down on you, but the facts are that we’re not from the same world. There’s karma between us, but I’ve resolved it. We probably won’t meet again once you leave this place today.”

Yang Ye fell silent. To be honest, her words hurt a little, but he wasn’t able to refute them. A short while passed before he suddenly chuckled, “I think you’re being a little too obstinate. In any case, I do what I like, and I don’t do what I don’t like. As for everything else, I don’t care about it at all. Of course, I have to admit that your words do hurt a little. But I believe that we’ll be people of the same world one day.”

Yang Ye didn’t stay a moment longer after he finished speaking, and he just turned around and left.

Lady gazed at the door which Yang Ye vanished through, and a long time passed before she lowered her head slightly, “You’ll die if you be friends with me....”

...

Once he left Immortal Island, Yang Ye hadn’t even flown for long when a woman obstructed his path. It was none other than Asura Queen.

Asura Queen stared fixedly at him, “Don’t step foot in the Zither of Love again. Otherwise, I’ll kill you!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’ve heard a little about what happened to you, but you can’t hate everyone because of a single incident. You demon beasts have tried to kill me on many occasions, but I’m not hostile to the entire demon race. So, I think that you should change the way you think. Otherwise, someone might beat you up one day!”

Asura Queen ridiculed, “Don’t tell me that person is you!”

“I’m not going to waste my breath on you out of consideration for her.” Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Asura Queen’s eyes narrowed and was about to attack. However, she seemed to have thought of something and relaxed her grip in the end.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had increased his speed to its limits. With the strength he possessed right now, he didn’t have to fear Asura Queen at all. However, he was very clearly aware that Lady was there, so it was impossible for them to fight. So, he decisively chose to leave and not waste his time and breath on her.

...

At the border of the Zither of Love.

Yang Ye had just descended to the ground when An Nanjing and Xuwu Shen appeared in front of him.

An Nanjing asked, “Is it done?”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he gazed at Xuwu Shen, “Our trip to the Central Divine Prefecture won’t be like your trip there with Lou Qianxiao. To be honest, even though I haven’t been there, I have quite a few enemies there. So, you might never come back if you go there with me!”

“That’s exactly why that old man of mine wanted me to go with you!” Xuwu Shen said, “He said my life in Pine Prefecture is too calm, and I should head out and get tortured.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Don’t worry. I’ll definitely bury you if you die!”

Xuwu Shen’s face darkened, “Can’t you say something a little better?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Alright, let’s go fight those so-called geniuses of the Central Divine Prefecture. Let’s see if they really are as formidable as the rumors say!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s figure vanished into the sky, and An Nanjing immediately followed behind him. As for Xuwu Shen, he took a deep breath and said, “Old man, you’re not afraid of making me go with that madman, but I’m quite afraid....”

Xuwu Shen immediately transformed into a ray of light and shot off in Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s direction.
