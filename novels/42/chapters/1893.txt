Chapter 1894 – Who Have I Ever Feared?

At this moment, there was a mark on each of her cheeks.

She stared at him, “Yang Ye, you can kill me, but don’t…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye grabbed her by the throat, and then they appeared on the ground below. A moment later, Yang Ye slammed her against the ground.

Bang!

The ground cracked open.

However, she was completely fine. She was a powerful expert, so the ground was naturally not as hard as her head.

But Yang Ye’s actions were a huge humiliation for her.

Her face warped as she stared at Yang Ye, and she was about to speak when Yang Ye stomped his foot on her face. After that, he slowly pressed down as he said, “Act as you please? Didn’t you say that you act as you please? Do you know what it’s like now?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye kicked her on the face.

Bang!

She was kicked around 3km away. Her figure hadn’t even fallen to the ground when he appeared in front of her again, and then he stomped his foot down on her head.

Yang Ye pressed lightly with his left foot and said, “I planned to kill you in an instant, but doing that would be letting you off too easily.”

Yang Ye pointed his finger downwards, and a ray of sword energy entered her stomach. In an instant, her eyes opened wide.

Her Dantian had been shattered!

Even though it wasn’t difficult for her to form another Dantian with the strength she possessed right now, it depended on whether Yang Ye was willing to let her go.

Obviously, it was impossible!

After he shattered her Dantian, Yang Ye tapped a few times in succession, and four swords nailed her to the ground while he entered the Primordial Pagoda instead.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye went to Zhi’er. At this moment, her condition was much better. Moreover, she was conscious. Besides Snowy, Xue’er, Bao’er, and Lei Lin were there too.

All of them gazed at Yang Ye when they saw him.

Snowy flew over to Yang Ye’s shoulder, and then she pointed at Zhi’er’s shoulders. Her shoulders were empty.

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head, and then he walked over to Zhi’er. She glanced at Yang Ye and spoke timidly, “Big… Big Brother… How’s Grandpa?”

Yang Ye rubbed her head, “He’s fine.”

Zhi’er visibly relaxed when she heard Yang Ye. She hesitated for a moment and spoke softly, “Big Brother, they… they said you can help me regrow my arms. Is that true?” As she spoke, she gazed at Yang Ye with eyes filled with anticipation.

Yang Ye smiled and placed his hands on her shoulders, “Of course!”

As he spoke, he circulated countless strands of Primordial Violet Energy into her, and it only took a short while for her arms to grow once more.

Zhi’er instantly cried tears of joy when she saw her new arms.

Meanwhile, Snowy flew over to her, pointed at Yang Ye, and then started waving her claws.

Snowy was saying ‘I didn’t lie to you, huh?’

Zhi’er cracked a smile as she gazed at Snowy, “Thank… thank you…” As soon as she finished speaking, she turned to look at Hou Qing. She was clearly quite afraid because Hou Qing only had a head.

She walked over to Hou Qing, knelt down, and said, “Grandpa, thank… thank you for saving me.” As soon as she finished speaking, she turned to face Yang Ye and continued, “Big Brother, you too.”

Yang Ye pulled her up and said, “Don’t kneel so easily!”

She grinned and didn’t say anything.

“Come, let’s go see someone!” As soon as he finished speaking, he took her out of the Primordial Pagoda and brought her before the woman. Zhi’er seemed very afraid when she saw the woman, and she immediately hid behind Yang Ye.

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s fine.” He flipped his palm and raised a sword in front of Zhi’er, “Kill her!”

Kill her!

Zhi’er was stunned.

Yang Ye asked, “Don’t you want revenge?”

Zhi’er glanced at her, and then she gazed at the sword in Yang Ye’s grasp. A short while passed before she shook her head.

Yang Ye asked, “What?”

Zhi’er spoke softly, “Killing her is meaningless. Because I’m still weak, and others will still be able to bully me as they please in the future.”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a short while and said, “Smart girl.”

He naturally understood what she meant.

Meanwhile, Zhi’er suddenly knelt down and said, “Please forgive me.”

She clearly had other intentions when she said that. Simply speaking, she’d played a little trick.

Yang Ye shook his head and asked, “You want to cultivate?”

Zhi’er hesitated for a moment and nodded.

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She replied softly, “If I’m as strong as you, I can go look for my parents.”

Yang Ye’s slight frown immediately eased up when he heard this. He didn’t like people who played tricks, but now that he heard her, he realized that she was still a child. She wanted to become stronger so that she could find her loved ones.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing suddenly said, “Nothing can be said about that reason. She has a kind heart. But she knows that the person she has encountered is able to change her fate, so she played a little trick. It’s very normal.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Senior, you have quite a good impression of her, huh?”

Hou Qing said, “Her character is unlike yours. Haven’t you noticed? There was no hatred in her eyes when she gazed at that woman. There are two types of people in this world who are quite terrifying. The first are people like you. People who are absolutely vengeful and go to extremes!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened. What the hell?

Meanwhile, Hou Qing continued, “The other type is people like this little girl. The kind.”

Yang Ye asked, “They’re terrifying too?”

“Of course!” Hou Qing explained, “Kid, those who are truly kind will definitely be repaid with kindness and good luck. She’s kind and without ill intent, and that’s why your little lord became close with her and played with her. It’s also why she encountered you even when in danger, was transformed by the Primordial Violet Energy you possess, and we’ve even taken a liking to her. It’s her karmic luck!”

Yang Ye had quite a strange expression on his face. If he was being honest, he really didn’t think so much about it all.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing added, “Kid, let me ask you something. What would you have done if she took your sword and killed that woman?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “I’d find a place for her to live in and give her a life of wealth, and then I’d leave.”

Hou Qing asked, “What about now?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Hou Qing said, “Fate and karmic luck can’t be seen or touched, but they exist. It was fate that brought you together, so help her.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I can’t bring her around with me.”

Hou Qing replied, “It’s fine so long as you have the intent to help her!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Yang Ye nodded, and then he gazed at Zhi’er. He hesitated for a moment and asked, “What should we do to that woman?”

He wanted to test her character!

Zhi’er glanced at the woman, hesitated for a moment, and said, “Ask… ask her to apologize, and we’ll let her go. Alright?”

“Apologize?” Yang Ye chuckled, and then he rubbed her head, “No wonder Snowy was willing to play with you. However, we can’t let her go. Otherwise, she’ll go kill other people!”

Zhi’er spoke softly, “Big Brother, you decide!”

Yang Ye walked over to the woman and said, “Apologize and I’ll let you die a quicker death!”

She stared at Yang Ye and remained silent!

Yang Ye gave her a thumbs up, “I love unyielding people.” He sized her up, “There was once a person whom I sliced into over 10,000 pieces. Just his head was sliced into over a thousand slices! Even though I haven’t done it for a long time, you don’t have to worry. I won’t make yours any lesser.”

As soon as he finished speaking, a sword appeared in his grasp.

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something at this point, and he sent Zhi’er into the Primordial Pagoda.

Meanwhile in the world outside, Yang Ye waved his hand incessantly while piece after piece of flesh flew into the air. All of the flesh naturally belonged to that woman.

However, she seemed to be very unyielding and didn’t make a sound.

It didn’t take long for her to become completely unrecognizable. Only her soul was left, but even her soul wasn’t able to escape.

Her soul gazed at her and said, “What else can you do? Feel free to try!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t worry. It’s only the beginning!”

He snapped his finger and a flame appeared on his thumb.

The Divine Yin Flame!

As soon as it appeared, the temperature here became blazing hot.

She immediately revealed fear in her eyes when she saw the Divine Yin Flame, “What are you planning?!”

Yang Ye grinned, “Nothing much.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he flicked the flame forward, and it enveloped the woman.

“AH!” A shrill and miserable cry resounded.

It was clearly painful to be burned by the Divine Yin Flame. It only took a while for a weak voice to resound, “I… I’ll apologize!”

She wanted to apologize!

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “No, let’s speak about that a little later.”

“Yang Ye!” She howled.

Yang Ye closed his eyes. At this moment, he’d realized something. He finally knew why the Sovereign of Man and the others wanted to kill him.

The strong!

As far as the Sovereign of Man and the others were concerned, they were strong, and he was just from the lower universe. He was a weakling, an ant.

At most times, the strong didn’t need a reason to illtreat the weak. If one insisted on a reason, it may be because it made them happy, or they couldn’t stand the sight of the person…

Since the ancient times, the strong did as they pleased, and the weak were resigned to their fate!

It was an eternal truth!

Quite some time passed before Yang Ye opened his eyes. He looked up at the sky and said, “The winds of spring blow, the drums of war rumble, but when have I, Yang Ye, ever feared anymore?”
