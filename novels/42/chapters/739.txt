Chapter 740 – Just Shut Up And Fight!

The door cracked open, and then Man Xi and 4 old men walked out slowly from within.

“So there really are those in this world who don’t fear death! But don’t worry, I won’t let you die that quickly. Because there are many things more terrifying than death in this world, and I’ll allow you to experience them one by one.” Man Xi was still smiling, but that smile carried slight insanity and ferocity.

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and a piece of paper floated slowly towards Man Xi. He said, “It’s an agreement for a life and death battle. You’re a body refiner, and so am I. Moreover, my cultivation is lower than yours, so you wouldn’t be afraid to sign it, right? Of course, if you ask those 4 geezers behind you to attack, then please fuck off. Because I don’t really like talking with cowards!”

“I know you’re trying to egg me on, but it’s fine. Because I want to deal with you myself as well!” Man Xi flicked with his finger, and a drop of blood flew onto the agreement. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The contract was signed, so death had to be decided!

Suddenly, the expressions of the old man behind Man Xi changed, and they looked up into the sky in unison. Over 100 rays of light were flying swiftly through the sky, and it wasn’t long before Mu Qingfeng and the others appeared by Yang Ye’s side.

Over 100 Monarch Realm experts!

Man Yuan frowned, and it was the same for the old man by his side.

“What’re all of you doing here?” Yang Ye was rather surprised when he saw them.

“This isn’t just related to you; it’s related to our Lunar Rite Hall as well!” Mu Qingfeng glanced at Man Xi and said, “The Man Clan openly captured a member of Lunar Rite Hall. If my Lunar Rite Hall doesn’t do anything about it, then how would it maintain its foothold in the city? So, we’ve come to seek justice today!”

“Mu Qingfeng, with just these forces?” Man Xi revealed a savage smile as he sized her up, and there was a wisp of lust in his eyes as he said, “I heard that no one has ever laid eyes on your appearance. I wonder how you look. But it’s fine because not only will I lay eyes on your face today, I’ll even see you completely naked. Haha....”

Killing intent surged in Mu Qingfeng’s eyes when she heard this, and all the other members of Lunar Rite Hall were exasperated.

“Doggy Man, fuck your ancestors! If you didn’t have the support of the Man Clan, then I could fucking kill trash like you 10 times in a day!”

“Enough. Boss, give the order and we’ll kill that bastard!”

“Boss! Give the order! We’ll destroy the Man Clan today!”

Most of the members of Lunar Rite Hall were youths, and the young were filled with spirit and vigor. It wasn’t that they hadn’t noticed the 4 Half-Saints behind Man Xi, they just didn’t fear them. Why? Because they had the numbers, and they were united.

“I’ll give all of you 3 breaths of time to fuck off right now! Otherwise, all of you can leave your lives behind!” Man Yuan glanced coldly at Mu Qingfeng and the others.

“Man Yuan, how arrogant of you!” Suddenly, a voice resounded out of thin air, and then an old man who held a walking stick in his hand and an old woman appeared by Mu Qingfeng’s side. The old man glanced coldly at Man Yuan and said, “Let me see how you make them leave their lives behind!”

“The Man Clan has really grown too arrogant lately!” Meanwhile, Elder Li and another old man arrived here.

4 Half-Saints! This time, the faces of Man Yuan and the others fell. Man Yuan glanced at the white haired old man and said, “Mu He, you intend to go against my Man Clan for this body refiner?”

“I don’t know him!” Mu He replied, “I’m not here for him. I’m here for my granddaughter, the Hall Master of Lunar Rite Hall. Actually, the conflict between the young isn’t related to old fellows like us. However, you, Man Yuan, intend to rely on your strength at the Half-Saint Realm to insult and humiliate my precious granddaughter. So, the 2 of us had no choice but to come and play with you!”

“What about the 2 of you, Elder Li?” Man Yuan gazed at Elder Li, “Or is this the Hallowed Halls’ intention?”

“We aren’t here on behalf of the Hallowed Halls today. We’re here on our own accord!” Elder Li said, “We were from Lunar Rite Hall, and we couldn’t bear to watch it being insulted. Are you satisfied with such an explanation?”

Man Yuan’s face grew even more gloomy while he gazed at Yang Ye. He hadn’t expected that Yang Ye would first receive Nether Maiden’s help, and now had the help of so many others. It was something he’d never expected. Because the information he’d fathered earlier said that this body refiner called Yang Man had no background. If there was anything at all, then it would be a slight link to the Fire Spirit Race!

But the Man Clan naturally had no need to fear the Fire Spirit Race now, and that was why they’d captured Fu Jinxian earlier. Because they wanted to know what other cultivation techniques apart from the Man Clan’s cultivation technique could allow Yang Man to possess a physical body which was comparable to a Half-Saint.

But he hadn’t imagined that it would cause such a string of problems.

“I’ve signed an agreement of life and death with my grandson, so allow us to finish our business before talking about other things, alright?” Meanwhile, Yang Ye spoke abruptly.

“Are you that eager to die?” Man Xi stared fixedly at Yang Ye. This time, there was no smile on his face, and there was only killing intent.

Yang Ye smiled and said, “Did you say that you’ll be my grandson if I return. What? You dare to talk but not admit it?”

“You’re really good at talking, huh?” Man Xi’s figure flashed over to arrive in front of Yang Ye, and he said, “I’ll smash off your teeth, one by one, and then I’ll cut off your tongue. Let me see if you’ll still be able to speak like this after that happens.”

“Come on!” Yang Ye gestured provocatively with a finger while a cold smile suffused the corners of his mouth.

“Wait!” Man Xi was just about to attack when Man Yuan spoke abruptly, “This is a battle of life and death, and they’ve even signed an agreement. So, all of you won’t interfere, right?”

Mu He and the others frowned, and then they gazed at Mu Qingfeng. Mu Qingfeng gazed at Yang Ye instead. Yang Ye smiled and said, “This is between me and him, so don’t interfere if I’m no match for him. Of course, please help me stop others from interfering if he’s no match for me!”

“Kid, don’t worry. No one will interfere in the battle between both of you!” Mu He gazed at Yang Ye and said, “However, let me tell you in advance that we won’t interfere if you’re no match for him!”

Yang Ye smiled and nodded, “Of course!”

Meanwhile, Mu Qingfeng walked over to Yang Ye and said, “Don’t underestimate him. Even though he rarely fights, he’s definitely not weak. Moreover, the Man Clan is a clan that has existed for tens of thousands of years. Its resources and reserves are extraordinary. Regardless of whether its techniques or treasures, they’ll definitely be remarkable. So, don’t underestimate your opponent, alright?”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Thank you for the reminder!”

Mu Qingfeng nodded, and then she moved aside.

Man Xi was just about to attack when Man Yuan stopped him and said, “Don’t underestimate your opponent. That kid isn’t weak, so don’t lose because of carelessness. Besides that, don’t kill him. Keep him alive so that we can determine what secrets he possesses.”

Man Xi nodded while a savage smile arose on the corners of his mouth. He said, “Don’t worry, I won’t kill him. I’ll even slowly ‘play with him’ until he dies once we’ve obtained the secrets he hides!”

The others moved aside and left a spacious area for Yang Ye and Man Xi to fight on.

Meanwhile, more and more people were arriving from all directions. Moreover, there were even more rushing over from afar.

“That’s Yang Man, I know him. He killed Yu Wushuang and the white robed Vice Master of Snow’s Lament that day. What the fuck!? He’s actually fighting the Man Clan now? He really is a maleficent existence. I definitely should stay away from him!”

“Who do all of you think is stronger? Yang Man or Man Xi?”

“I don’t know. Yang Man’s strength isn’t bad at all, but Man Xi is definitely not weak as well. At any rate, he’s a member of an ancient clan. Even if his strength is slightly weaker, his equipment won’t be, right? So, it’s hard to decide!”

“Cut the crap and just watch. They’re about to begin!”

Man Xi gazed at Yang Ye as he slowly clenched his fists, and then he said, “Even though that woman of mine was just like a piece of my clothing or a container or mine, she was still a woman of mine in the end. Yet you killed her before my eyes and even insulted me. Do you know that I really, really want to kill you!?”

Yang Ye flipped his palm, and a pair of dark golden gloves appeared on his hands. Besides that, dragon scales started to appear beneath the gloves. He refused to underestimate anyone in the Hallowed Grounds. Especially when he couldn’t reveal his true strength.

“Do you know? I....”

Man Xi was about to say something when Yang Ye suddenly stomped his right foot on the ground and shot explosively towards Man Xi. He said, “Know my ass! If we’re fighting, then fight! What’s with all the crap?”

Accompanying Yang Ye’s voice was a fist that glowed brilliantly as it shot towards Man Xi’s head.

Man Xi’s face turned utterly gloomy, and his gaze surged with ghastly killing intent. He didn’t continue wasting his breath anymore. He clenched his right fist tightly, and then a red glow erupted from it as it smashed directly at Yang Ye’s fist!

It was a head-on collision!

Battles between body refiners were head-on battles, and the outcome was decided by their respective strength and defense!

Bang!

Thunderous rumbling resounded as soon as their fists collided, and then a few dozen fine pitch black cracks appeared throughout the space at the point of collision. As for the ground beneath their feet, it had been shattered into powder before their fists had even collided!

A moment of silence ensued.

Bang!

Both of them were blasted flying, and every single step they took caused a deep footprint to be embedded into the ground!

A wisp of seriousness appeared in Yang Ye’s eyes because he noticed that Man Xi’s body was very formidable. If it was based merely on the body, then Man Xi was the strongest he’d seen amongst the profounders at the Monarch Realm and below.

“Is that all you’ve got?” Man Xi shook his head and said, “To be honest, I’m very disappointed, truly disappointed. Because you’re too weak. You’ve attacked earlier, so it’s my turn now!” His figure flashed forward as he spoke, and he instantly arrived in front of Yang Ye before smashing his fist forward.

Yang Ye frowned and punched forward as well. Yang Ye’s expression suddenly changed drastically when his fist was about to collide with Man Xi’s fist. It was because the space around Man Xi’s fist had actually collapsed!

It was too late to withdraw his fist now....

Bang!

The spectators watched with astonishment as Yang Ye’s figure transformed into a black ray of light that flew off backwards.

“Too weak....” Man Xi’s voice resounded.
