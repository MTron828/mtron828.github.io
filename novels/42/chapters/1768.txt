Chapter 1769 – To Be Ordinary, You Must First Be Extraordinary!

Needless to say, Yang Lianshuang’s speech was very passionate. At the very least, it made the others’ blood boil when they heard her.

Yang Ye glanced at Yang Lianshuang, and there was a trace of surprise in his eyes.

Because he thought that Yang Lianshuang’s objective was to make the Yang Clan the number one clan in the medium universe. But now it seemed like her ambition stretched further than that.

However, it was clearly extremely difficult to accomplish it!

Yang Lianshuang suddenly asked, “Has there been any movement in the Ying Clan and the other clans?”

Yang Xuan stepped forward and shook her head, “No.”

They showed no signs of movement!

The hearts of everyone here fell. The Ying Clan and those other clans would definitely not give up on crushing them. So, the reason behind them not making any moves was certainly not because they wanted to stop.

It was the calm before the storm!

If they attacked again, they would definitely give the Yang Clan no chance to survive. Yet now, numerous experts of the Yang Clan had left, so it was like adding fuel to the flame for the Yang Clan!

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang waved her hand and said, “All of you can leave. Just do what you’re supposed to do.”

They glanced at her and left.

Only Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang remained in the hall.

Yang Lianshuang said, “I’ve talked to Qingshi. She said your wish is to have an ordinary life, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Indeed.”

She gazed at him, “Many think that an ordinary life is a happy one. Actually, is it really like that? No, that’s just an excuse they gave themselves. It’s an excuse for them to slack off. In my old home, there are many people who live day to day. They never seek to improve, but they create excuses for themselves. They say ordinary lives are happy lives!”

She shook her head and chuckled, “But they don’t realize that simple and ordinary lives are never lived by choice. Because you dare not eat food that’s too good, wear things that are too good, or play with things that are too good. Most importantly, when you encounter something unfair, you can only choose to suffer such an injustice. Because others have more authority, power, and money than you!”

Yang Ye asked, “What are you trying to say?”

Yang Lianshuang looked him in the eyes and said, “An ordinary life. What’s an ordinary life? Only someone who has experienced the peak of life has the right to live an ordinary life. As for ordinary people, do they have another choice? It isn’t that they want an ordinary life, it’s that they’re forced to live an ordinary life!”

She looked up at the sky and continued, “A person should have a goal and aspirations. Even if you’re unable to accomplish that goal or aspiration, you wouldn’t have lived your life in vain! Especially men. If they don’t fight for something, then they may not even be able to get someone to marry them!”

Yang Ye was stunned. Get someone to marry them?

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang said, “It wasn’t easy to get a wife where I used to live.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She turned to look at him and said, “Because they can’t afford one!”

She turned around and vanished from the hall.

Only Yang Ye was left here.

The hall was extremely quiet, and no one disturbed Yang Ye. Yang Ye naturally understood what she said. She was telling him that he didn’t have the ability to live an ordinary life. Even if the Ying Clan and those other clans don’t look for trouble with him, there would be others who looked for trouble with him in life.

Even if nobody caused trouble for him, what if the sky collapsed?

He hadn’t forgotten what had happened on Profounder Continent.

At that time, everyone who wasn’t strong had died!

If he wanted to live an ordinary life, he had to be extraordinary first!

Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye left the hall.

Ye Estate.

Cultivation!

Yang Ye allocated time to cultivating every single day. Even though he was at the True Realm, his strength was far from sufficient for this world. There were too many experts in this world.

He didn’t train in Split Second or try to improve his cultivation, and he trained with the Obliteration Sword Formation instead!

It could be considered as a trump card of his, and it could even kill 4th stage True Realm experts in an instant! Of course, that was based on his current strength, and his past strength wasn’t capable of accomplishing that at all.

Even though it could instantly kill 4th stage True Realm experts, it wasn’t a huge threat to 5th and 6th stage True Realm experts!

The Obliteration Sword Formation still had room for improvement, so he intended to raise its strength to its absolute limit!

However, the Ying Clan and the other clans refused to give him the opportunity to accomplish that.

Yang Ye hadn’t even been cultivating for a day when the Ying Clan and the other clans had taken action, and the action they took caught the entire Yang Clan by surprise.

Because the starry sky around Heaven Void Continent was surrounded by around 50 True Realm experts. That wasn’t even the main point. The main point was that the Yang Clan didn’t even know when they appeared there!

However, the Ying Clan and those other clans didn’t attack. They just surrounded Heaven Void Continent.

Phecda Hall.

All the core figures of the Yang Clan were here.

An old man asked, “Why aren’t they attacking?”

Yang Xuan shook her head slightly, “They may be waiting for us to attack.”

The old man was puzzled, “They’re waiting for us to attack?”

Yang Xuan nodded, “They’ve surrounded the continent but refrained from attacking. It’s because there’s a formation around Heaven Void Continent. Even though their strength is enough to break through it, if we decide to fight them to death, then if Yang Ye and our patriarch are included, we’ll be able to kill at least 80% of their forces! They can’t afford to suffer such losses!”

“Cowards!” Yang Lianshuang suddenly said, “They want to annihilate our clan, take all the worlds which belonged to us, and put an end to all future troubles. However, they’re worried about this and that. Haha!”

Her laughter was filled with ridicule.

Yang Ye nodded in response. If the Ying Clan and those other clans disregarded everything, then it would be absolutely impossible to defend the Yang Clan. Unfortunately, they were worried about too many things, and they didn’t trust each other either. Otherwise, the Yang Clan may have been annihilated by now.

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang said, “They’ve surrounded us but refuse to attack. They clearly want to trap us here until we die.” She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Do you have any extreme ideas?”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

She continued, “Don’t look at me like that. We need extreme methods to deal with them.”

Everyone else gazed at Yang Ye as well.

Yang Ye’s last idea was really extreme and risky, but it was extremely effective as well. It succeeded at resolving the danger that the Yang Clan faced. So, they felt quite a bit of anticipation towards Yang Ye.

Yang Ye remained silent for an instant, and then he said, “I do have a plan, but it actually can’t really be considered one. Since they refuse to attack, then we won’t attack as well. We’ll just do what we should and see who’s more patient!”

All of them felt speechless.

Suddenly, Yang Lianshuang said, “He’s right. If they don’t attack, then we won’t attack as well.” She gazed at Yang Lin and continued, “Tell the others in the city to be ready to activate the formation at any moment and ignore everything else!”

Yang Lin nodded, and then he left.

Yang Lianshuang gazed at the others, “All of you can leave too!”

They nodded and left the hall.

Once they left, Yang Lianshuang gazed at Yang Ye, “What do you plan to do?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short moment before he replied, “My strength has improved quite a bit lately. I want to find someone to fight.”

She gazed at him for a long time before she said, “Be careful.”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Don’t worry. I’ll run if I get into a losing battle.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished from the hall.

Om!

A moment later, an ear piercing sword howl shot up into the sky above Heaven Void Continent. At this moment, everyone in Phecda City saw a ray of light shoot up into space.

Yang Ye was attacking!

Needless to say, Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang were the pillars of support for the Yang Clan. Especially Yang Ye. When Yang Ye had been the Yang Clan’s enemy, he was a nightmare for them. Because he was truly too ruthless and insane!

But now, they suddenly realized that it was really nice to have someone in the clan who dared to fight and could fight.

Because no one would ever call the Yang Clan cowardly when they had someone like that!

Even if they were weaker than their enemy, they dared to fight back! As for the outcome of the battle, that wasn’t important. The important part was that they dared to fight!

Even if one lost the battle, one was still a man if one didn’t shrink back from battle!

In the starry sky.

As soon as Yang Ye appeared there, a few dozen True Realm experts surrounded him. They didn’t dare to let Yang Ye leave Heaven Void Continent. Because if he left, then their own homes may be in danger!

They stared at Yang Ye while undisguised killing intent could be seen in their eyes!

Yang Ye glanced at Ying Qing and the others, and then he grinned, “What? You want to kill me that badly?”

Ying Qing spoke indifferently, “Would you believe me if I said we didn’t?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “If you want to kill me, you can. I’ll give you a chance right now.”

He pointed his sword at Ying Qing and continued, “Patriarch of the Ying Clan, I heard you’re very strong. I, Yang Ye, am no expert, so I’d like to seek guidance from you!”

He was challenging the Ying Clan’s patriarch!

Everyone here was stunned. Obviously, they hadn’t expected that Yang Ye would have actually come here to challenge Ying Qing!

Even Ying Qing hadn’t expected it!

All of them exchanged glances. Will Ying Qing accept the challenge?

Since Yang Ye dared to challenge Ying Qing, he was definitely confident in his ability. In other words, the slightest mistake may cause the Ying Clan’s patriarch to die here.

But if he refused and word of it spread, then Ying Qing wouldn’t be able to hold his head up high in public anymore!

After all, the dignified patriarch of the Ying Clan actually didn’t dare to accept a challenge from a Zenith Realm cultivator!

Of course, they didn’t know that Yang Ye was already at the True Realm!

A long moment of silence ensued, and then Ying Qing suddenly gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Attack together and end him!”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

The others were stunned for a moment, and then they immediately attacked.

Yang Ye was stunned as well, “This isn’t how I imagined it would go….”
