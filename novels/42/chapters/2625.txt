Chapter 2626

After she received Yang Ye’s command, Snowy naturally didn’t hesitate at all!

She opened her mouth, and the spirit energy throughout the Origin World surged madly toward her.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing remained completely vigilant by her side.

Because Snowy was in absolute danger at a time like this.

The Origin World still had some mysterious experts that would definitely not let them destroy this place that easily.

But it didn’t matter to them. Yang Ye was prepared for the worst.

As for the old man’s request for them to end it now, he’d never given it any consideration. Moreover, he firmly believed that it would never just end here. Even if he wanted to, the Eternal Kingdom and Origin World wouldn’t.

It would only end in death!

Even now, this battle would only end with the death of one side!

The spirit energy throughout the Origin World was growing increasingly scarcer.

It would take an hour at most for Snowy to fully absorb all the spirit energy here.

At that time, the Origin World would collapse into nothing but ruins and death!

Of course, it would naturally not go smoothly!

Suddenly, a man appeared not too far away from Yang Ye and An Nanjing!

A middle aged man with a spear on his back!

The middle aged man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “You’re Chen Xuanan’s disciple?”

Yang Ye glanced at the man and remained silent.

The middle aged man walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, “I’m Cang Hua, and I know your master, Chen Xuanan.”

Yang Ye nodded, “And?”

Cang Hua gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he said, “Out of consideration for him, I don’t want to act against you. Stop now and you can leave. If this continues, the best outcome is where both sides suffer tremendous losses!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “When they took Snowy and harmed her, their fate was sealed. It’s either they or I die!”

Cang Hua frowned slightly, “Why be so overbearing? The Origin World didn’t kill her and merely harmed her. Now, you’ve killed countless in the Origin World, so…”

“It isn’t enough!” Yang Ye suddenly interrupted him, and he stared at Cang Hua as he said, “It’s far from enough.”

Cang Hua gazed at Yang Ye for a long time. In the end, he nodded, “Then there’s nothing left to talk about.”

He drew the spear on his back.

An Nanjing was about to attack, but Yang Ye stopped her. He gazed at her and said, “Let me do it!”

An Nanjing hesitated for a moment and nodded.

Yang Ye looked up. Tian Xiu and Qi Bitian were being kept busy. No, it should be said that they were keeping those experts busy.

Yang Ye’s gaze focused on Tian Xiu!

Tian Xiu!

This time, he’d seen her.

Tian Xiu suddenly stopped in midair. There was a strand of powerful dark light rippling out of her, and the light instantly blasted Xuan Lin and the others away.

Tian Xiu glanced at Yang Ye, and the latter cracked a smile, “A’Xiu!”

Tian Xiu didn’t offer any response. She moved her gaze away, and then she transformed into a ray of dark light that charged at Xuan Lin’s group.

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and waved his right hand. He summoned the pool of lightning in the air above the Origin World back into the Primordial Pagoda!

Now, he didn’t need it to help destroy this world.

Once the spirit energy here vanished completely, it would be the moment of this world’s destruction!

Yang Ye glanced at Erya. At this moment, she seemed to be undergoing some sort of transformation.

Yang Ye didn’t disturb her. He just withdrew his divine sense and walked in Cang Hua’s direction.

Cang Hua attacked.

It was an attack that appeared out of nowhere, and it was so fast that Yang Ye’s divine sense couldn’t catch its movements!

Yang Ye relied on his own formidable combat instincts to forcefully stop it with Executor!

However, his arms instantly cracked open, and he was blasted over 3km away!

He was at the Lord Realm now, so ordinary Destiny Realm experts were no match for him!

However, he was facing this Destiny Realm expert who didn’t even belong to this era, and he wasn’t an ordinary Destiny Realm expert either!

Cang Hua glanced coldly at Yang Ye and stretched out his right hand. In an instant, countless ethereal spears appeared around Yang Ye!

Suddenly, Snowy waved her little paw, and then strands of spirit energy rippled out at the ethereal spears!

Snowy’s strength wasn’t her own strength, and it came from the countless sprites behind her. She could use their strength in battle!

It was extremely terrifying!

Bang! Bang!

Along with a few explosions, the ethereal spears started to explode apart, inch by inch.

Meanwhile, Snowy gazed at Cang Hua, and then she clenched her paw and slammed it at him!

Boom!

A strand of powerful energy swept toward him like a tornado.

The spirit energy of the world!

Presently, Snowy didn’t just possess the energy of all sprites, she possessed the energy of the world too. It could be said that Destiny Realm experts weren’t even as strong as her, or it should be said that even Yang Ye may not be able to defeat her!

She wasn’t just a cute little glutton anymore, she was really amazing now!

Cang Hua remained indifferent, and then he vanished on the spot.

Hiss!

An instant later, something was torn open!

It was the powerful World Energy that Snowy had unleashed. Snowy had just advanced, so her strength was far from sufficient to deal with an expert like Cang Hua.

Cang Hua shot forward unobstructed. His target wasn’t Yang Ye, it was Snowy!

Because the only way to resolve the Origin World’s issues was by dealing with Snowy.

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared before Snowy again.

Bang!

A wave of powerful slaughter intent swept out of Yang Ye, and then mysterious energy enveloped Cang Hua!

The Slaughter Domain!

Cang Hua frowned when the Slaughter Domain enveloped him, and he stopped moving. Meanwhile, a blood red sword appeared before him!

Cang Hua’s spear was even faster!

As soon as Yang Ye’s sword arrived, a spear stabbed against the tip of his sword.

Clang!

The sword shook violently and was blasted away with Yang Ye!

Meanwhile, Cang Hua glanced at the surroundings and waved his spear horizontally.

Hiss!

The slaughter intent around him was instantly swept away. At the same time, Yang Ye’s Slaughter Domain shattered!

Yang Ye’s cultivation was too low, so using just a Domain to deal with an expert like Cang Hua was very, very difficult. Unless he could use both the Sword Domain and Slaughter Domain at the same time!

If he could simultaneously activate them both, then perhaps he could suppress Cang Hua at his current realm of cultivation.

Unfortunately, his Slaughter Domain was stronger than his Sword Domain, so it would suppress the Sword Domain!

Thus, he couldn’t use two Domains at the same time for now! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Cang Hua didn’t attack again. He gazed at the Yin Lord to the right, “Why aren’t you joining the battle so that we can deal with them, once and for all?”

The Yin Lord glanced at the surroundings. Obviously, he was afraid of the old man with the bamboo chest.

Meanwhile, Cang Hua said, “Don’t worry, he won’t interfere.”

The Yin Lord stopped worrying, and a wave of powerful cold winds appeared around him. A moment later, the winds grew stronger and stronger to the point they shook the Boundless Water below, causing countless strands of water to converge into the wind!

Meanwhile, Cang Hua’s aura rose madly as well!

One of them was the lord of a world while the other was an extraordinary expert from Qi Bitian’s time. Their joint forces were absolutely not something Snowy, An Nanjing, and Yang Ye could resist!

Boom! Boom!

Two powerful waves of energy enveloped the three of them!

Yang Ye held Executor tight while his blood surged madly, and strands of Bloodline Energy swept out of his body.

He was pushing his limits at every moment!

Suddenly, two strands of energy suddenly stopped around 30m away from him.

An ethereal paw had forcefully stopped them!

A moment later, the paw was clenched.

Bang!

The Yin Lord and Cang Hua’s energy were instantly obliterated!

They looked up and saw that Qi Bitian had interfered!

Boom!

Along with a resounding explosion, space shook before countless figures were blasted away!

A moment later, Qi Bitian appeared near Yang Ye.

She walked over to him and waved her right hand. Yang Ye’s slaughter intent was instantly suppressed, and he regained clarity of the mind.

Qi Bitian gazed at Yang Ye and grinned, “I didn’t expect this to still happen. I’m afraid you’ll have to deal with what comes next.”

She gazed at Yang Ye’s stomach, or to be more precise, she was looking at Erya, “Unfortunately, you haven’t fully awakened, I hope…”

Suddenly, something unexpected happened. A wave of invisible pressure appeared here.

The pressure had just appeared out of thin air, and no one knew where it had come from!

Everyone here was stunned.

A short moment later, their expressions changed!

It was because the pressure was beyond powerful!

Many people were gradually pressured to the point their bodies couldn’t stand straight. Even the Desolate Emperor’s expression had instantly turned unsightly. It should be said that he’d turned pale, ghastly pale!

Thud!

Meanwhile, countless fell to their knees around the Origin World, and this even included many Destiny Realm experts!

Even the Yin Lord and Cang Hua couldn’t stand straight, and their knees were almost against the ground!

However, the pressure was still growing stronger!

At this moment, even the Desolate Emperor couldn’t stand completely straight. But it didn’t take long for him to straighten his body, but it bent down immediately… This kept going on in an endless cycle!

Cang Hua’s face was pale while terror covered his face, “She’s coming… She’s here…”

Meanwhile, a sword cultivator in a cloud white robe was walking through space when he suddenly turned around and looked in a certain direction. There was unprecedented excitement in his eyes, “How strong…”

A sword howl resounded, and then his figure vanished!
