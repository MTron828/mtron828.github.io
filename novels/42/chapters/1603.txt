Chapter 1604 - Who Do You Think You Are!

Translator: InVader

The white haired old man and the others had gloomy expressions on their faces when they heard Yang Ye.

The old man stared at Yang Ye, “Do you realize what you’re saying?”

Yang Ye looked the old man in the eyes, “Do you need me to repeat myself?”

Snowy was his reverse scale. Since the old man wanted Snowy’s soul to be made into an equipment spirit, he would naturally not be nice to the old man.

The white haired old man didn’t spear further. He raised his right hand and stretched it forward before making a clawing motion at Yang Ye. In an instant, a huge hand that could hold up the sky emerged from the space above Yang Ye, and then it clawed down at him.

A vicious glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes. He didn’t waste his breath at all and just drew his sword.

Om!

A sword howl resounded as a ray of sword energy shot up into the sky. It was extremely swift and instantly slammed against the hand.

Boom!

As soon as they collided, an explosion erupted, and the aftershock caused ripples to surge through space.

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “You have some skill. No wonder you were so arrogant. But you’re still an ant!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took a step forward, clenched his right fist, and then slammed it at Yang Ye from afar.

A huge energy fist covered in lightning emerged from the space above Yang Ye. It was over 1km wide, and when it appeared there, the space around Yang Ye started to warp from the pressure it emanated.

Yang Ye was about to attack when Snowy suddenly waved her claw at the Sprite Kings in the distance. After that, she opened her mouth, and a while beam of light instantly shot out from her mouth. Its target was the white haired old man.

At the same time, the other Sprite Kings attacked in unison. Countless beams of various different colors shot up from below, and they converged into a huge multicolored pillar of light. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The white haired old man’s expression changed at the sight of the multicolored pillar of light.

He didn’t dare act carelessly or underestimate the attack. He immediately signaled the other white robed old men to attack with him. The multicolored pillar of light created by Snowy and the Sprite Kings were instantly obliterated by their joint forces, and the white haired old man’s group was pushed over 3km back!

Snowy and the other Sprite Kings were about to attack again, but the experts from the Nether Pavilion suddenly charged towards the Sprite Kings.

Snowy blinked, and then she gazed at Yang Ye. Yang Ye patted her head lightly, “Go on! Be careful!”

Snowy nodded, and then she flashed over to the center of the Sprite Kings. After that, countless strands of spirit energy surged out from within her, and the Sprite Kings immediately started absorbing it.

Even though Snowy and the Sprite Kings were extremely strong, the experts of the Nether Pavilion weren’t weak either. Fortunately, those Rebirth Realm experts weren’t able to harm Snowy’s group. However, it was difficult for Snowy’s group to annihilate them as well. After all, it was quite a huge group of Rebirth Realm experts.

The Nether Pavilion’s Master gazed at the white haired old man, “These are all your forces?”

The old man glanced at the Pavilion Master and spoke in a low voice, “The experts of my Ringworld System will take 15 minutes at most to get here.”

The Pavilion Master nodded slightly, and then she gazed at Little Sky, “Can you kill me in 15 minutes?”

Little Sky spoke coldly, “Let’s try!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished on the spot.

At this moment, the forces of Merak System and the Nether Pavilion were in a slight stalemate.

Even though Little Sky was invincible right now, the Pavilion Master wasn’t weak as well. It was impossible for Little Sky to kill her in a short while. Unless one’s cultivation far surpassed an expert at her level of cultivation, it was extremely difficult to kill such experts. Moreover, the Pavilion Master wasn’t clashing directly with Little Sky!

She was buying time!

Once the experts of Ringworld System arrived, the situation would be turned around in an instant. Because at that time, the experts of Ringworld System just had to join forces with the Nether Pavilion, and they would definitely be able to swiftly annihilate the Sprite Kings and the Eyes of the Heaven Dao.

At that time, even if Little Sky remained invincible, she would be helpless to turn the situation around. After all, she couldn’t challenge the entire Nether Pavilion and Ringworld System on her own.

Yang Ye was naturally standing on Little Sky’s side. What a joke, Snowy’s identity was exposed. So, not to mention Ringworld System, even the Nether Pavilion wouldn’t spare her. She was a Sprite Lord, so she was absolutely useful to them.

Once Little Sky lost, Snowy, Little Sky Flame, and all the other Sprite Kings would definitely suffer!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and it didn’t take long for his face to turn gloomy. Because Sky Maiden had devoured another five or so Eyes of the Heaven Dao!

Yang Ye noticed that Sky Maiden was the bane of Eyes of the Heaven Dao. Moreover, every single time she devoured one, her own aura would grow slightly stronger. So, Sky Maiden was growing stronger and stronger as she fought the Eyes of the Heaven Dao!

She can’t be allowed to continue! Yang Ye remained silent for a while before he flashed over to her.

Sky Maiden frowned when she saw Yang Ye appear in front of her, “Move aside!”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “Can you spare them?”

He was very well aware that Little Sky couldn’t pay any attention to the battle here, but if this continued, the Eyes of the Heaven Dao would definitely be completely devoured.

They were the managers of order in Merak System. Once Sky Maiden devoured all of them, it would definitely be a huge loss to Merak System.

Sky Maiden gazed coldly at him, “I’ll say it one last time! Move aside!”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Sky Maiden didn’t say a word. She just flashed over to Yang Ye before slapping her palm at his head.

Yang Ye just gazed at her without dodging or trying to defend himself.

Right when her palm arrived just half an inch away from his forehead, her hand suddenly stopped.

Yang Ye gazed at her while she gazed at him.

A moment of silence ensued, and then Sky Maiden withdrew her hand, “Are you that desperate to die?”

Yang Ye took a step forward and said, “You’re Yin’yin, right?”

Sky Maiden remained silent.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “The you I met all those years ago was the you before you awakened your past memories, right?”

Sky gazed at him and remained silent.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “Yin’yin, can you spare these Eyes of the Heaven Dao?”

She looked up towards the distance and said, “See that? Merak System can’t be saved. Regardless of whether it’s Little Sky or that Sprite Lord, they’re a form of temptation that are impossible to resist for some powers. It isn’t too late for you to leave.”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Abandon Snowy, Little Sky, and all my loved ones in Merak System?”

Sky Maiden combed her hair behind her ear and spoke indifferently, “You won’t be able to make a difference by staying. This is a war between King Rank powers. Your strength isn’t able to change anything.”

Yang Ye fell silent. She was absolutely correct. He was an utter spectator this time. The battle between Little Sky and the Nether Pavilion was something he was powerless to change. Because his strength was just too weak before them.

Meanwhile, Sky Maiden suddenly gazed at Snowy, “Give up on her.”

Yang Ye frowned, “What are you trying to say?”

Sky Maiden replied, “You don’t understand how tense the spirit energy situation is in the various universes. The reason the Nether Pavilion is trying to expand is because the spirit energy in our world is gradually drying up. We have no choice but to look for another way out. Merak System is our way out. However, we won’t give up on obtaining that Sprite Lord as well.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She replied, “Because she can save an entire universe. Actually, to put it simply, she’s like a spirit vein, an extraordinary spirit vein. A spirit vein that can breathe life into a universe for tens of thousands of years at the very least! Moreover, if she’d refined into an equipment spirit, that treasure that has her would be like a super moving Dantian. In short, she’s too useful, so no power can refuse the temptation she represents.”

She gazed at Yang Ye at this point and continued, “But your strength isn’t sufficient to protect her. If she stays with you, she’ll be a calamity for you.”

Yang Ye was about to speak when the space far away in outer space suddenly started trembling, and then a huge golden carriage appeared there.

The golden carriage was extremely long, and it was actually being pulled by three dragons!

A young man in an embroidered robe was seated on it, and he was holding a beautiful woman in his arms.

At the side of the carriage was a group of guards in golden armor and spears in their grasps. There were a hundred of them, and all of them were at the Rebirth Realm!

Everyone stopped fighting when they witnessed this scene.

The white haired old man from Ringworld System flashed over to the carriage, and then he bowed respectfully, “Young Master Lin Qi.”

The man called Lin Qi stood up slowly, and then he glanced down at the world below him, “This is Merak System?”

The old man nodded respectfully, “It is.”

Lin Qi was about to say something when the beautiful woman in his arms gazed at Snowy, “That’s the Sprite Lord?”

The white haired old man nodded, “Young Miss, it is. It’s still an infant, so it’s suitable to be an equipment spirit.”

The woman smiled sweetly, and then she wrapped her arms around Lin Qi’s waist, “Lin Qi, you said you’d get me a Sprite Lord to be the equipment spirit of my Heart Enlightenment Mirror.”

Lin Qi pinched her cheek and smiled, “When have I ever gone back on my word?”

As he spoke, he gazed at Little Sky, “If you give that Sprite Lord to me, I’ll immediately lead my forces away. Alright?”

“What if I refuse?” It wasn’t Little Sky but Yang Ye who spoke. At this moment, Yang Ye was holding Snowy in his arms.

Lin Qi immediately gazed at Yang Ye when he heard this, “Who do you think you are?”

“Who do I think I am?” Yang Ye chuckled, “Who do you think you are?”

“Me?” Lin Qi smiled and said, “Ringworld System has 400 medium worlds and 3 large worlds. All of them belong to my Lin Clan, and I’m the young master of the Lin Clan and future master of Ringworld System. So, who do you think I am?”
