Chapter 1395 – Fulfilling A Promise!

The man’s gaze had descended onto Resentment Maiden, and it didn’t take long for him to turn ghastly pale. He was just about to speak when she suddenly waved her hand, and then a wave of dark red light swept forward before the man was obliterated.

Yang Ye shook his head. If the man had arrived a little earlier, he might have had the chance to take Yang Ye’s head. Yet now, wasn’t he just giving his life away?

After she obliterated the man, Resentment Maiden gazed at Yang Ye and flicked a shiny stone to Yang Ye.

A little surprise flashed through the others’ eyes when they saw the stone, and there was a trace of envy in their eyes as well. It was especially so for the pig-riding young woman. Her eyes were glowing, and it seemed like she wanted to take it from Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What’s this?”

“The Worldmend Stone!” Resentment Maiden continued, “I’ll spare you the details about its origins. You just have to know that once you refine and absorb it, it’s equivalent to possessing a second Dantian. Because it has a pocket of space within it, and it can store profound energy. If you keep it filled, then it can be your second Dantian to provide you profound energy when you really need it.”

Yang Ye was visibly moved when he heard this. He immediately took the stone in both hands and seemed as if he was afraid someone would take it from him!

It was a treasure!

A huge treasure!

It was even more precious than an Origin Rank treasure! The volume of profound energy he could store was already much greater than others in the same realm of cultivation. But he was still only able to execute the true form of Heavenrend twice. Because it really consumed too much profound energy. Yet now, he could execute the true form of Heavenrend 2 more times with the Worldmend Stone!

4 Heavenrends!

Coupled with the stellar energy he could absorb via the Stellar Ward technique, he could execute around 7 Heavenrends in the future! Moreover, it would definitely be able to save his life at a critical moment. Because his profound energy had dried up in many of his battles. So, he couldn’t repair his body swiftly. Just like this very moment, he was relying on the Stellar Ward technique to keep himself standing.

If he had the Worldmend Stone, he wouldn’t have to do that at all! Because he would have extra profound energy, so he could use it to repair his body while he fought. So, the Worldmend Stone was absolutely useful to Yang Ye!

Meanwhile, Nether Maiden suddenly spoke, “That’s Fourth Sister’s treasure!”

Yang Ye put the Worldmend Stone away before he gazed at Resentment Maiden, and he said, “Thank you, Fourth Sister!”

Resentment Maiden was slightly stunned. She hadn’t expected Yang Ye to address her as fourth sister, just as Nether Maiden and the others did. She was slightly unaccustomed to it, but it didn’t take long for her to return to normal. She nodded and said, “You helped us today, so the experts of the large world probably hold a grudge against you. Be careful when you head there in the future.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I will.” He would naturally not dare to underestimate the experts of the large world. However, he didn’t really fear them either. In any case, they didn’t dare to come down here. But if he went to the large world in the future, then he really had to be a little careful.

Resentment Maiden nodded slightly, and then she gazed at Nether Maiden and the others, “Let’s go.”

As soon as she finished speaking, her figure flashed and vanished into the sky.

It didn’t take long for Light Maiden, Oblivion Maiden, and the others to follow her. Only Nether Maiden and the pig-riding young woman remained here.

The pig-riding young woman walked over to Yang Ye’s side and patted him on the shoulder, “Thank you for just now.” As soon as she finished speaking, her figure shot up and vanished in the sky.

Meanwhile, Nether Maiden suddenly said, “They wanted to kill you in the past!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Nether Maiden smiled, “They were afraid that you would take advantage of me.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Nether Maiden restrained her smile and said, “We’re leaving. I wonder if we’ll have another chance to meet.”

Yang Ye asked, “You’ll be heading to the large world, right?”

Nether Maiden nodded, “Definitely.”

Yang Ye nodded and smiled, “I’ll definitely be heading there too. So, we’ll meet again, right?”

She gazed at him for a long time before she said, “See you there!” Her figure vanished into the sky once she finished speaking.

“See you there!” Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he turned around and vanished on the spot.

...

White Deer Academy.

Once he returned to his room in the academy, Yang Ye immediately went to the cultivation room on the 3rd level. As soon as he entered it, his figure collapsed to the ground. After that, the scales on his body vanished rapidly. Once the scales vanished, threads of blood instantly started seeping out of him because his body was all cracked open.

Xiao Yuxi was shocked by this scene, and she hurriedly grabbed Yang Ye’s hand and spoke in a trembling voice, “Are... are you alright?”

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “I’m fine. Don’t worry.” He really was fine. Even though his body had cracked apart, they were just external injuries. His internal organs hadn’t suffered any injuries under the protection of the Stellar Ward Technique. However, his physical strength was severely over exhausted.

Exhaustion!

That was the state he was currently in.

Yang Ye withdrew some divine crystals and started swallowing them like a madman. Spirit energy surged into him before being completely absorbed by the Primordial Pagoda, and then threads of violet energy flowed out from within it. As soon as the violet energy appeared within him, they were fully absorbed by his body, and his body gradually recovered under the effects of the Primordial Violet Energy.

Xiao Yuxi gradually relaxed when she saw his injuries recovering, and a wisp of pain flashed through her eyes as she gazed at him.

Yang Ye’s life was too exhausting.

Since she’d known him, he’d been fighting and charging forward throughout his life. His footsteps were very swift and practically never stopped. She understood that it wasn’t wrong as he was a man. If a man didn’t fight and charge forward, how would he protect his family?

But Yang Ye’s life was too exhausting.

He carried too much on his shoulders!

Time trickled by. Yang Ye’s body recovered rapidly under the effects of the Primordial Violet Energy, and it took less than a day for him to recover completely.

Once his body recovered, Yang Ye started refining the Worldmend Stone.

He didn’t encounter any problems during the process, and it didn’t take long for it to be completely refined and absorbed. A link was formed between it and his mind, and it resided by the Primordial Pagoda’s side once it was fully refined and absorbed.

A second Dantian!

Now that he had the Worldmend Stone, he didn’t have to worry so much about his profound energy.

He left the Primordial Pagoda with Xiao Yuxi once everything was done.

...

In the sky above White Deer Dimension.

At this moment, White Deer Academy seemed exceptionally quiet because Xiao Bieli and the others had left.

Xiao Yuxi’s gaze descended onto White Deer City which was filled with ordinary cultivators, “What about the ordinary people here?”

Yang Ye replied, “The Alliance of Guardians won’t act against them. Conversely, if we stay here, then they would truly be in danger. Actually, it can also be considered as an opportunity for them.”

Xiao Yuxi was puzzled, “An opportunity?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Most of the powers in the Radiant Dimension have been destroyed by me. Presently, the Radiant Dimension is just waiting to be rebuilt. If it wasn’t for the Alliance of Guardians, I would have been willing to develop my Sword Alliance here. However, this is part of the Alliance of Guardians’ territory, so staying here will only bring harm to them. Moreover, I have an even more important matter to attend to, so I can’t pay any attention to the Radiant Dimension.”

Xiao Yuxi nodded lightly, “Where are we going now?”

“To see someone before we leave the Radiant Dimension.” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye took Xiao Yuxi’s hand and vanished on the spot.

...

Ocean of Clouds Merchant Group.

Yang Ye brought Xiao Yuxi to the Ocean of Clouds Merchant Group. He was here to see Bai Xiangyao, of course. She’d taken a huge risk to lend him the Imperial Cloud Shuttle all those years ago, so he naturally couldn’t forget that debt he owed her. Moreover, she’d even helped him on many occasions. So, he was here to repay the favor.

In the hall. Bai Xiangyao’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye, and there was a trace of complicated emotions in her eyes as she gazed at him. Yang Ye had grown too quickly. Just a few years ago, he’d been pursued all over the Radiant Dimension. Yet now, as soon as he returned, he’d swept through all the powers of the Radiant Dimension with matchless strength.

He grew too quickly!

Yang Ye smiled, “Miss Bai, long time no see!” He was quite grateful to her. He was grateful for all the help she’d given him, and he would never forget it.

Bai Xiangyao’s gaze paused on Xiao Yuxi for a moment, and then she smiled, “It has only been a few years since we last saw each other, yet you’ve already grown to such an extent. It’s really quite a blow to my confidence.”

Yang Ye smiled, waved his right hand, and then a spatial ring appeared before Bai Xiangyao.

Bai Xiangyao glanced at Yang Ye, took the spatial ring, and then gave its contents a glance. After that, she looked up at Yang Ye and spoke with surprise, “Imperial Cloud Shuttles?”

Yang Ye nodded. Within the spatial ring were the 2 Imperial Cloud Shuttles he’d obtained within the ruins on Dark Hell Continent. He had the Void Cloud Shuttle now, so he naturally had no use for the Imperial Cloud Shuttles.

Bai Xiangyao said, “These aren’t ordinary Imperial Cloud Shuttles. They are much better than the one I lent you all those years ago!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I borrowed one from you, but because of certain reasons, I hadn’t been able to return it to you in a timely manner. I’m truly sorry about that, so treat those 2 Imperial Cloud Shuttles as my apology.”

Bai Xiangyao pondered deeply for a few breaths of time, and then she nodded and took the spatial ring. She was very well aware that based on Yang Ye’s current strength, the Imperial Cloud Shuttles were of no use to him.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “Miss Bai, I own a medium world in Dark Hell Stellar Region. The restrictions there have just been removed, so it has just started to recover. Are you interested in opening up a branch there?”

It was impossible to bring prosperity to Dark Hell Continent if he relied solely on the Sword Alliance’s development. He had to draw over even more people to Dark Hell Continent. It was best if he could transform it into a place like Stellar City. After all, it was obvious how terrifying the yearly income of Stellar City was!

“A medium world?” Bai Xiangyao was surprised, “You have a medium world?”

Yang Ye replied, “I can’t really be considered one right now. It can only be considered a small world for now, but it’ll recover slowly.”

Bai Xiangyao took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, and then she said, “I’m naturally willing to open a branch there.” After all, it was an absolutely good thing for her, so she would naturally not refuse. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye nodded, “But I have a condition. You have to represent your merchant group. If it’s anyone else.... Tell them that if it isn’t you, then there’s no need to go there.”

Bai Xiangyao said, “Thank you!” After all, now that Yang Ye had said that, she was the only one in the merchant group who could expand their business there, so her status would naturally rise tremendously.

“Don’t mention it!” Yang Ye smiled, “Once you arrive at Dark Hell Continent, you can look for the Sword Alliance’s Yun Banqing if you need anything or need some help. Right, even if you have some private matters to resolve, you can come seek my help. I will definitely not refuse if it’s within my ability.”

Bai Xiangyao smiled, “Then you’ll be my backing from now on!”

Yang Ye smiled and said, “Miss Bai, see you on Dark Hell Continent. Farewell.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye didn’t stay a moment longer. He immediately took Xiao Yuxi’s hand and vanished from the hall.

Meanwhile, Bai Xiangyao silently looked up at the sky outside the hall.

...

In the sky, Xiao Yuxi asked, “Where are we going now?”

“To fulfil a promise!”
