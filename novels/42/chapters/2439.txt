Chapter 2440 – The Desolate Deathguard!

It didn’t take them long to continue forward after Huang Ying’s proposal.

The Life and Death Border!

All along the way, Huang Ying was explaining everything about the area to them.

They didn’t just have to stay on guard against humans here, they had to be vigilant against the beasts and mysterious beings that lived here.

“The desolate race is united, but it’s under the circumstances that a Crown Prince has been selected!” Huang Ying spoke softly as they traveled, “So long as there’s a Crown Prince, no one in the desolate race is allowed to have their own agenda. It can be said that if those elder brothers of mine become the Crown Prince, then even if I’m unwilling to accept it, I have to submit. Otherwise, my entire race will turn against me. But now, there is no Crown Prince, and the eldest, exalts, and guardians wanted their own to be the next Crown Prince. The authority possessed by my elder brothers may not be very great, but some of those who stand behind them possess extremely huge authority.”

As he spoke, he looked up at the boundless mountain range ahead, “An elder who supports my eldest brother is in command of countless Desolate Beasts throughout here. That elder is my eldest brother’s greatest supporter. He won’t stand by idly this time.”

“What about your supporters?” Yang Ye asked abruptly. Since Huang Ying had been able to gain a foothold for himself in a place like the desolate race, and even compete for the position of Crown Prince with Huang Tianxing and Huang Ye, how could he not have anyone’s support?

Huang Ying smiled, “Let me keep it a secret for now. You’ll naturally find out when the time comes.”

Yang Ye nodded and didn’t pursue an answer.

Suddenly, they stopped.

An ethereal old man had appeared before them.

Huang Ying’s smile vanished when he saw the old man, and he bowed slightly, “Mortal Exalt.”

The old man nodded slightly, but it didn’t take long for him to move his gaze to Yang Ye, and Yang Ye met his gaze without displaying the slightest fear.

A short while passed before the old man nodded, “While you may not be from my race, you’re an outstanding genius.”

He gazed at Huang Ying, “Return alive.”

Once he finished speaking, his figure turned increasingly ethereal until he vanished.

Huang Ying spoke softly, “Miss A’Leng, Brother Yang, let’s go.”

They continued forward. It didn’t take long for them to enter a mountain range, and as soon as they did, the entire ground started trembling. An instant later, a pitch black shadow appeared within their fields of vision.

It was a demon beast. No, to be more precise, it was a desolate beast. It was shaped like a wolf, completely pitch black, and with four thick and strong limbs. Besides that, it emanated an extremely vicious aura. There was a young man seated on its back.

The desolate beast had no intention to stop, and its powerful aura surged at them.

A Four World Realm beast!

As for the young man on its back, they couldn’t discern his strength at all.

Huang Ying lowered his head slightly when he saw the man, “Brother Yang, Miss A’Leng, be careful. They are the Deathguard that my desolate race trained in secret. They may seem young, but practically all of them have lived for countless years, so don’t be careless.”

His figure transformed into a ray of black light that shot at the man and the desolate beast.

A'Leng and Yang Ye exchanged glances, and then A’Leng suddenly slammed a punch to her left.

Bang!

A’Leng was blasted over 300m away!

Meanwhile, a man wearing a pair of blood red gloves was standing where she’d been. He had an indifferent expression on his face as he gazed at her, and his gloves were striking red.

Right at the instant A’Leng was blasted away, Yang Ye suddenly drew his sword and swung it behind him.

Hiss!

Yang Ye’s right hand shook violently, and he was slammed backward. He was pushed around 30 steps back before he stopped himself.

A man with a saber stood before him. The man’s saber was much longer than a traditional saber, but that wasn’t the main point, the main point was that Yang Ye’s attack hadn’t destroyed his saber. After all, Yang Ye’s sword was a Super Divine Treasure. While 80% of its strength was sealed, it was still a Super Divine Treasure! However, the man’s saber was completely unharmed!

But it wasn’t even a Divine Treasure!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to look at the man. It wasn’t the saber but the man himself!

The man held his saber with one hand and gazed indifferently at Yang Ye.

“Haha!” Suddenly, Huang Ying roared with laughter, “Even the Desolate Deathguard were sent at us. It seems the people supporting my brothers really paid a huge price for this!”

Bang!

As soon as he finished speaking, he was pushed back repeatedly while a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth.

Huang Ying wiped off the blood and stood by Yang Ye and A’Leng’s side.

Three against Three!

No, it was three against four! One of them had a desolate beast.

Huang Ying wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and smiled, “As expected of the Deathguards my ancestor personally ordered to be trained. You really are strong!”

Very strong1

Both Yang Ye and A’Leng agreed to that statement. Their strength was obvious once they clashed with them. While the experts before them were only at the Four World Realm, they were absolutely not existences ordinary Four World Realm experts could compare to.

Surmounting their realms of cultivation to challenge these experts was difficult!

Yang Ye fell silent as he stood by Huang Ying’s side.

At this moment, he thought of the Yang Clan. The Yang Clan had been this cruel too when it came to training their juniors. Now, the desolate race was the same. But he was very well aware that the successor who survives all of this would be of very high quality.

Cruelty was so that they would be able to survive better! After all, how could a weakling be the leader of a clan?

Cruelty was the way these large clans and races survived!

Huang Ying suddenly smiled, “Brother Yang, Miss A’Leng, you’re guests, so you choose your opponents first.”

A'Leng gazed at the man who’d blasted her flying earlier, and then she transformed into a ray of light that shot at him.

Bang!

The man with the blood red gloves was instantly blasted over 300m away!

A’Leng stomped her right foot down and shot forward once more.

A powerful aura rippled through the world!

Her true strength!

Obviously, she had stopped hiding her strength.

Yang Ye and Huang Ying withdrew their gazes, and the latter gazed at Yang Ye. Yang Ye grinned, and then he started walking toward the man with the saber.

Huang Ying shook his head and laughed bitterly, “They’re all a bunch of smart people!”

It was because the one he had to face had a Four World Realm desolate beast too!

He didn’t let his thoughts run wild and just charged at the man on the desolate beast.

The battle erupted!

Yang Ye walked over to the man with the saber, and the man gazed indifferently at him with eyes that were calm as dead water.

When Yang Ye was just around 3m away from him, the man suddenly moved.

Yang Ye hadn’t been able to see how the man had moved. All he knew was that a saber had appeared above his head.

It was absolutely swift!

Yang Ye’s sword left its sheath.

The sword didn’t move to stop the saber, and it stabbed at the man’s chest instead.

A life for a life!

However, the man didn’t pull his saber back and did the same!

A Deathguard!

What was a Dethguard? Would someone afraid of death be given that name?

Hiss! Hiss!

Two strands of blood sprayed, and then they were 300m away.

There was a deep bloody injury on Yang Ye’s forehead, and blood was ceaselessly seeping out of it. As for the man with the saber, there was a hole in his chest.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

At the critical moment, they’d moved away upon colliding with each other.

They weren’t afraid of death, but it didn’t represent that they would allow themselves to just die together with their enemy!

Yang Ye had really encountered a true opponent this time. This expert before him was really unafraid of death.

Suddenly, the man took a large stride forward and instantly appeared before Yang Ye. After that, he swung his saber down at Yang Ye with both hands.

Overbearing!

This swing of the saber felt overbearing. It had an overbearing air like it could chop anything apart!

Yang Ye had trained in the saber before, but he had to admit that he was inferior when compared to this man. However, he focused on the sword! The saber was just supplementary!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly. When the saber was just a few inches away from his forehead, his sword suddenly left its sheath!

The Sword Domain!

Five swings!

As soon as the fifth swing descended, the man was instantly blasted away. However, Yang Ye was slammed backward by the force of the collision too. He was pushed around 300m back!

The man’s saber shattered, but Yang Ye’s right hand had cracked open too, and it was trembling violently!

Their strength had been too strong, so their head-on collision had resulted in both of them being injured!

With the help of the Primordial Violet Energy, the injuries on Yang Ye’s head and hand were healing rapidly.

Yang Ye’s opponent had clearly noticed this, so he immediately stretched out his right hand, and an ethereal saber appeared in his grasp.

A strand of the desire to kill appeared in his eyes.

“Slash!” He suddenly shouted with fury, and then he swung the saber at Yang Ye with both hands. The saber vanished from his grasp and instantly appeared in front of Yang Ye.

It was impossible to dodge!

It was an attack that shot through space!

It was beyond fast!

Yang Ye took a small step back, and then he grabbed Executor with both hands and swung it.

Hiss!

As soon as the sword descended, the space before it was sliced open, and the ethereal saber was forced to a stop. However, the man suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye, and then an expanse of saber energy rained down upon Yang Ye like a storm.

In just an instant, Yang Ye was drowned beneath a storm of saber energy.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was blasted away once more. As soon as his feet hit the ground, A’Leng and Huang Ying appeared by his side.

Both of them had pale countenances and blood on the corner of their mouths.

Huang Ying wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and said, “They’re much stronger than I expected. As expected of the guards who once fought their way into Eternal Kingdom with my ancestor!”
