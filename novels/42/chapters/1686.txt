Chapter 1687 - Sword Howls Resounding Through The Sky!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to shake his head.

It was never a fair battle!

It proved that amongst the higher-ups of the Yang Clan, the people who wanted to kill him outnumbered those who wanted to keep him alive. Or perhaps, it should be said that they were stronger.

So, he couldn’t place his hopes on those people who were trying to help him from the shadows.

If he wanted to live, he had to rely on himself.

Phecda City trembled more and more quickly. It didn’t take long for a white barrier of light to cover the city from above. It enveloped the entire city, and there were numerous mysterious golden markings all over it.

Once the barrier of light appeared, countless strands of spirit energy surged down incessantly from above. In the end, they surged down like torrents and entered Yang Tian.

As the golden spirit energy surged incessantly into him, Yang Tian’s aura grew stronger and stronger. In the end, the aura he emanated caused the space around him to tremble violently and seem like it was about to shatter.

“The Divine Convergence Formation!” Suddenly, Yang Tian spoke, “Even a True Realm expert can’t kill me while I’m within this formation. No, even the joint forces of two True Realm experts can’t kill me, and I’m invincible before cultivators below the True Realm.”

Meanwhile, Lu Lige walked over to Yang Ye’s side and asked, “Shall we retreat?”

“Retreat?” Yang Ye shook his head. He couldn’t retreat. He was certain that if he did that, the higher-ups of the Yang Clan would have an excuse to kill him. Just like how Yang Xian had been killed just now.

The Yang Clan was determined to kill him!

“Come give it a try!” Suddenly, Yang Tian chuckled, “Come try our Yang Clan’s Divine Convergence Formation!”

Yang Ye looked up at Yang Tian, remained silent for a moment, and then drew his sword.

Om!

A sword howl resounded, and then a beam of flaming sword energy flashed forward. It tore through the air like a shooting star, and the space in its path was sliced open.

Yang Tian’s expression remained calm. He took a step forward and tapped his finger in the direction of Yang Ye’s sword energy.

A strand of terrifying golden light appeared on the tip of his finger. At the same time, Yang Ye’s flaming sword energy arrived before him.

Just like that, the flaming sword energy stabbed the tip of Yang Tian’s finger. However, nothing happened. It was like the surroundings had frozen.

A moment of silence ensued, and then the sword energy shattered and was obliterated. As for the flames, they returned to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s face instantly turned gloomy at the sight of this.

A wisp of surprise flashed through Yang Tian’s eyes, “What flames are those? They’re actually so powerful!” A smile curled up on the corners of his mouth, “I’ve taken a liking to it.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he tapped his right foot down. In an instant, the entire city seemed to tremble, and his figure transformed into a ray of golden light that vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye’s expression had changed when Yang Tian’s figure vanished. Because he felt like dozens of towering mountains were descending upon him, and the powerful aura from it made even breathing feel difficult!

Such power!

Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly. His Unyielding Sword Intent and Unyielding Slaughter Intent surged out madly, and then he tightened his grip on the Sword Precursor in his right hand and swung it.

Om!

A sword howl resounded throughout Phecda City.

Bang!

An instant later, a rumbling explosion erupted before Yang Ye, and then space instantly collapsed. But it only took a moment for numerous strands of mysterious energy to repair the space there. At the same time, Yang Ye was blasted over 10km away.

Blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth.

Yang Tian glanced at his hand. It had been charred black by the Divine Yin Flame.

He fell silent for an instant and looked up at Yang Ye, “Needless to say, those flames of yours are really powerful. It’s the strongest flame I’ve ever seen. Unfortunately, not to mention you, even two True Realm experts wouldn’t be able to do anything to me right now. The city’s formation makes me invincible right now!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took another step forward, and he instantly appeared before Yang Ye while the powerful aura he carried cracked open the space around Yang Ye!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the space in an area of over 3km around them collapsed. However, right when Yang Ye was about to utilize the Laws of Darkness, the collapsed space was repaired in an instant. After that, the powerful force from Yang Tian blasted him 3km away. As soon as he stopped himself, a trace of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth.

“Do you have other trump cards?” Yang Tian chuckled and started walking slowly in Yang Ye’s direction. At the same time, countless strands of golden energy surged down incessantly from the sky and entered his body, causing his aura to gradually grow stronger.

Yang Ye looked up at the sky, and then he vanished on the spot and appeared behind Yang Tian. However, a powerful strand of aura instantly blasted him away!

“The Laws of Darkness at the Zenith Rank?” Yang Tian turned to gaze at Yang Ye, “Needless to say, it was very shocking when you utilized it that day. Unfortunately, it’s useless against me right now.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he raised his hand and slapped it down in Yang Ye’s direction.

Bang!

A wave of powerful energy flashed out from the space in front of Yang Ye and blasted Yang Ye away.

Suppression!

At this moment, Yang Ye was being completely suppressed by Yang Tian!

Just as Yang Tian had said, he was being supported by the formation around Phecda City. So, to a certain extent, he really was invincible.

If he could collapse the space around him, then perhaps Yang Ye could fight Yang Tian. Because the Laws of Darkness could only reveal its true strength within an expanse of collapsed space. But the problem was that the Yang Clan’s higher-ups refused to let space collapse.

Yang Tian started walking slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, “Actually, your strength is really not bad. If you weren’t your father’s son, then with your strength and natural talent, you may really be able to become the next successor. Unfortunately, your identity makes you bound to be unable to become my Yang Clan’s successor.”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure vanished on the spot and appeared in front of Yang Ye. After that, a wave of powerful energy swept towards Yang Ye like a tsunami. The powerful energy caused the space in a huge area around Yang Ye to warp before it.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He raised his sword and pressed it against his forehead, and then both his Zenith Rank intents swept out from within him before he transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

Everywhere he passed, space was sliced open. In the blink of an eye, Yang Ye had arrived in front of Yang Tian, and Yang Tian had slammed his fist forward.

Bang!

A powerful wave of energy blasted Yang Ye’s sword energy apart. At the same time, Yang Ye was pushed backwards repeatedly.

Suddenly, Yang Tian pressed forward and swung another punch at Yang Ye!

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted 3km away, and a wisp of blood immediately seeped out of the corner of his mouth once he stopped himself.

Meanwhile, Yang Tian suddenly grinned, “Don’t you have another companion? Call for her! I really want to see how strong six types of intents are!”

“Can you stop trying to show off?” Suddenly, Lu Lige said, “Seriously, I really can’t take this anymore. It’s fine if you were relying on your own strength. But you’re relying on the Yang Clan’s City Protection Formation. Come! Deactivate the formation, and then tell those people who’re helping you in secret to stop helping as well. Dare to fight him one on one under such conditions?”

Yang Tian gazed at Lu Lige, and then he slammed his fist forward.

Lu Lige’s eyelids twitched, “The truth hurts, huh?!”

As he spoke, he grabbed his saber with both hands and swung it forward.

Bang!

An explosion resounded as Lu Lige was blasted over 10km away. As soon as he stopped himself, his saber instantly cracked apart while a wisp of blood seeped out slowly from the corner of his mouth.

Yang Tian glanced coldly at Lu Lige, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “This is the help you found? He’s too inferior when compared to that woman, An Nanjing. I don’t want to waste more time. Come! Call her, and let’s put an end to it all!”

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth. He was about to speak when a ray of white light flashed, and then Snowy appeared before him. The wooden sword was in Snowy’s grasp.

Snowy blinked at Yang Ye, cracked a smile, and passed the sword to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at her, “It agrees?”

Snowy blinked and started waving her claws.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to figure out what she meant.

Snowy had somehow made the wooden sword willing to let him use it twice a month! Only twice!

Twice!

Yang Ye gazed at Snowy. Obviously, it was definitely because of Snowy.

Yang Ye rubbed her head and said, “Go inside first!”

She nodded and vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye took the wooden sword in his grasp, and it immediately started to tremble in his grasp. After that, a ray of light enveloped him, and the Zenith Rank slaughter intent around him was instantly obliterated by the wooden sword!

It rejected slaughter intent!

Yang Tian suddenly chuckled, “How laughable! You think that lousy wooden sword will make you capable of fighting me? How truly laughable!”

Suddenly, the wooden sword in Yang Ye’s grasp started to tremble.

Anger!

Yang Ye was actually able to clearly sense its rage!

Meanwhile, the wooden sword started to absorb his Zenith Rank sword intent.

Once it finished absorbing his sword intent, it transformed into a ray of light that shot up into the sky. After that, light crisscrossed through the sky, and it instantly tore open the formation around the city.

At the same time, sword howls resounded incessantly from it, and the powerful sword howls cracked open space in a huge area around it!

Sword howls were resounding through the sky!
