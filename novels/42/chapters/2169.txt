Chapter 2170 – Familiar Sword!

In front of me? Yang Ye looked in front of himself, but it was completely empty.

He activated the Sword Domain, yet there was still nothing there!

However, he was very well aware that Tian Xiu would never lie to him. In other words, there was something in front of him, but he couldn’t see it!

Suddenly, Snowy hid her head into his clothes, and only a single fluffy ear remained outside.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Tian Xiu suddenly took Yang Ye’s hand and started walking backward.

She just stared forward without blinking while tightly clenching her other hand.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “What’s in front of me?”

Tian Xiu looked down slightly, “A very formidable thing. It wants to kill you, Big Brother.”

It wants to kill me! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he raised his hand and swung his sword.

A sword howl resounded and sword energy shot forward. However, it just suddenly stopped in midair like it had been grabbed by something!

At this moment, Yang Ye was certain that there was something in front of him.

Yang Ye wanted to attack again, but Tian Xiu pulled him backward.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and then he didn’t attack and just allowed her to pull him back. Just like that, they moved around 300m back before Tian Xiu suddenly stopped.

Yang Ye asked, “Is it gone?”

She shook her head and gazed at Yang Ye, “Big Brother, leave first, alright?”

“No!” Yang Ye immediately refused and took her hand, “We’ll leave together!”

Tian Xiu looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Big Brother, leave first, alright? I’ll be fine. But if you don’t leave, you won’t be fine. Big Brother, just listen to me this one time, alright?”

Yang Ye rubbed her head and said, “I know that you’re not ordinary, but I can’t just leave you here. Moreover, you must believe in me too. While that thing before me is very mysterious, and I’m strong too, right?”

A smile appeared on Tian Xiu’s face, “Big Brother is very strong!”

Yang Ye replied, “Then we’ll leave together!”

Tian Xiu thought for a moment and nodded. She looked up in front of Yang Ye, and then she walked forward slowly. When she was around 3m away from Yang Ye, she stopped and stared ahead while something soundlessly appeared on her forehead.

Netherworld Destiny!

She suddenly placed her right hand against her forehead, and Netherworld Destiny seemed to be on the verge of being pulled out. But right when she was about to really pull it out, the distant platform shook violently, and then something seemed to retreat back into it.

A moment later, the platform had returned to calm once more.

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu stopped and gazed at Yang Ye, “Big Brother, let’s go!”

Yang Ye glanced at the sacrificial altar, and then he took her hand and left.

A short while later, they vanished from Initial Spirit Star.

Not long after they left, a ray of blue light appeared on the platform, and then an ethereal figure soundlessly appeared.

“You spoiled it for me!” A furious howl resounded.

It was like muffled thunder, and it resounded through every corner of the planet!

…

After he left Initial Spirit Star with Tian Xiu, Yang Ye went to the endless black holes. He could only be considered to have left the large universe when he was before the endless black holes. He had to leave the territory of the large universe to see it in its entirety.

The large universe was huge. It included the small universe and medium universe. Both of them were located within the scope of the large universe. How huge was the entire large universe? Even a progenitor may not be able to figure out the answer to that question. However, the Initial Civilization had been able to use the large universe as the formation’s core to create a teleportation formation. Such ability was truly terrifying!

As he sensed the large universe, Yang Ye’s face gradually turned gloomy. Because he sensed that it was probably unrealistic to think about activating the formation with just the human race’s resources. Moreover, while he knew the large universe was the formation’s core, he didn’t know the exact way to activate it. So, using it to teleport the human race away like the Initial Civilization had teleported themselves away was difficult, extremely difficult!

So, Yang Ye felt quite lost.

He hadn’t experienced the End Times, but he was sure that it was absolutely not something nice, or it should be described as being very brutal. Without spirit energy, all the cultivators in the world would become like fish out of water. Moreover, natural disasters would occur incessantly. Simply speaking, the End Times was an apocalypse.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at the endless black holes. It was an expanse of pitch black, and even starlight couldn’t enter the area.

Yang Ye stood there silently for a short while, and then he entered them.

Endless black holes and endless darkness.

Yang Ye summoned Snowy. He gazed at her and said, “Snowy, can you sense any special places here?”

In the end, he’d decided to look for another way out.

The formation around the large universe seemed impossible no matter how he looked at it. Unless he could gain the support of all the races and the three paths to study the formation. However, he didn’t plan to do that. Because they wouldn’t believe him. Perhaps they would only believe him when they had no other choice.

Snowy glanced at the surroundings. It was pitch black, and she didn’t really like that.

A short while passed before Snowy gazed at him and shook her head.

She hadn’t sensed anything special!

Yang Ye nodded, “Then let’s go further in!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took Snowy in his arms and vanished into the distance.

A day later, Yang Ye had passed through numerous black holes, but Snowy still didn’t notice anything. However, he still didn’t choose to give up and continued forward. Just like that, three more days passed. At this moment, even Yang Ye didn’t know which direction he was traveling toward, and he would never be able to get back if he didn’t have the Black Hole Spirit.

Finally, on the fourth day, and right before Yang Ye was about to give up, Snowy found something! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Snowy pointed ahead, and there was a speck of light far away in the distance!

Light!

Yang Ye was shocked. After all, he was in the depths of darkness, yet there was light here?

Yang Ye gazed at Snowy, “Is it dangerous?”

Snowy blinked and shrugged to display that she didn’t know.

Yang Ye felt speechless.

After giving it some consideration, Yang Ye chose to head over there. He’d been searching for days and had finally found something, so he would naturally not give up. Yang Ye took Snowy in his arms and flew toward the speck of light. However, he noticed that it was boundlessly far from him!

How fast was he right now? However, after flying for almost two hours on his sword, it had merely grown a little brighter before him!

He still had a very long way to go!

Yang Ye continued forward. As he traveled forward, the speck of light grew in size. Now, it was over 10m wide.

“Big Brother!” Suddenly, Tian Xiu emerged from the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she glanced at the surroundings, “Big brother, are you going there?” She pointed at the speck of light.

Yang Ye nodded, “Why? Is it dangerous?”

She spoke softly, “I don’t know. I just feel that it’s very strange!”

Very strange!

Yang Ye rubbed her head, “I know. We’ll just go have a look, and we’ll run if it’s dangerous. Alright?”

Snowy hurriedly nodded on Yang Ye’s shoulder to display her agreement!

Tian Xiu hesitated for a moment and nodded, “Then be careful!”

Yang Ye smiled. He was about to speak when she suddenly took his hand ,”I-I don’t want you or Snowy to be in danger. I-I don’t want to lose my loved ones. I…”

Yang Ye squatted down and gazed at her, “Have you recalled something? You feel a little different now.”

She lowered her head and didn’t say anything.

Yang Ye smiled and said, “Since you don’t want to tell me, then don’t. Tell me when you want to, alright?”

She nodded.

Yang Ye smiled and said, “Both of you get inside the pagoda. Don’t refuse. Go in now!”

They didn’t refuse and obediently entered the Primordial Pagoda.

After they entered the pagoda, Yang Ye turned around and gazed at the speck of light. After that, he transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the distance.

This time, Yang Ye raised his speed to its limits. He was so fast that space was torn open before him, and it only took two hours for him to stop. A huge white door of light was in front of him.

It was almost 300m long and over 100m wide.

It emanated dazzling white light, and nothing could be seen clearly behind it. Even the black holes in the surroundings couldn’t devour the white light it emanated.

Yang Ye frowned, “What is this door?”

He sized up the surroundings but noticed nothing.

Only this door was here!

To enter or not to enter?

Yang Ye faced quite a dilemma. The door wasn’t normal, so only the unknown awaited behind it. But if he didn’t enter it, was he supposed to just return like this? If he did that, he would feel quite reluctant!

Yang Ye pondered for a long time. In the end, he chose to go in and have a look.

Yang Ye raised his right hand and Judgment appeared in his grasp. Right when he was about to enter the door of light, a voice resounded in his ears, “If you go inside, no one will be able to save you!”

Yang Ye stopped and looked behind. A figure was rapidly approaching him.

It didn’t take long for the figure to arrive before him, and that person pointed at the door of light, “Look carefully!”

Yang Ye turned around, and it didn’t take long for his pupils to constrict.

There was a mark from a sword on that door!

That mark was too familiar to him.

It was made by the Unfettered One!
