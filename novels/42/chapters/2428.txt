Chapter 2429 – Big Brother Yang, I’m Really Hungry!

As soon as he finished speaking, he swung his sword.

Bang!

A ray of light rippled out, and the figure before Yang Ye was blasted over 10km away. However, the ray of cold light left a blood red mark on his throat. It wasn’t deep and had barely cut through his skin!

Yang Ye recognized the person before him, it was someone he’d met in Divine Martial World. It was Senior Heaven who’d been a subordinate of the woman, A’Leng!

The old man had even fought An Nanjing that day!

Yang Ye glanced coldly at the old man. Obviously, the power which stood behind that mysterious woman wanted Snowy too.

The desire to kill surged in his eyes when he thought up to this point.

Yang Ye stomped his right foot down, and the space in a huge area seemed like it had been struck by a sledgehammer and shook violently. As for Yang Ye himself, he’d vanished on the spot, and then a brilliant ray of sword energy shot forward like a bolt of lightning!

Everywhere it passed, space was obliterated!

Senior Heaven’s expression changed drastically, and he pressed both his palms forward. A wave of powerful black light swept out like a wave and rippled forward incessantly, causing the space in the entire air to ripple as if it was boiling.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword arrived!

Hiss!

It sliced through the black light as if it was slicing through tofu.

An instant later, it slashed through the old man’s body.

The surroundings fell silent.

Yang Ye sheathed his sword behind the old man, and the instant it entered the sheath, the old man’s body was split open from the center and internal organs sprayed to the ground.

Meanwhile, the other four mysterious figures who’d attacked him earlier had retreated a long time ago after Huang Ying’s group had helped him keep them away.

Yang Ye gazed at Huang Ying, and the latter spoke softly, “The Di Clan!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “The Di Clan?”

Huang Ying nodded, “It was the Di Clan who just attacked you. You may not be aware of them, but they were one of the three top clans in Eternal Kingdom. However, along with the war between my desolate race and Eternal Kingdom, the latter fell into chaos, and the other two clans joined forces to drive the Di Clan out at the critical moment of the battle against my desolate race.”

He grinned, “It’s understandable that they want the Sprite Progenitor, and their attack was within my expectations.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Has the Di Clan and desolate race joined forces?”

Huang Ying smiled, “Not really. We’re just temporarily working together. The Di Clan has always desired to avenge themselves for what happened. As for the Sprite Progenitor, they naturally want it in their possession. After all, if they possess the Sprite Progenitor, they would have a greater advantage over us when we work together. It’s not just us, even Eternal Kingdom wasn’t it because countless powers throughout Eternal Kingdom would only take their side once they have the Sprite Progenitor!”

The Sprite Progenitor!

Yang Ye shook his head. Snowy! Oh! Snowy! You’re like a delicious dish that everyone wants!

As if she’d sensed Yang Ye’s thoughts, Snowy suddenly appeared on Yang Ye’s shoulder, and as soon as she appeared, countless divine senses in the surroundings surged over to her like a storm.

They did it openly and without fear!

Even if Yang Ye and Huang Ying were very strong, they ignored both of them when Snowy showed herself.

Huang Ying shook his head and chuckled, “Brother Yang, it’s best to make her stay inside. Once she shows herself, it’s like a stimulant to everyone in the surroundings, and that isn’t a good thing!”

Yang Ye gazed at Snowy, and he rubbed her head and smiled, “Go play inside!”

Snowy blinked and waved her paws swiftly.

A short while later, joy appeared on Yang Ye’s face, “Really?”

Snowy nodded repeatedly.

Yang Ye smiled, “Very good! You did well!”

Snowy cracked a smile, hugged Yang Ye and rubbed her head against him, and then she entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye grinned on the spot, “My awesome Snowy!”

Huang Ying walked over to Yang Ye’s side and smiled, “Brother Yang, let’s go!”

Yang Ye glanced at him, “How confident in you at being able to get back?”

Huang Ying smiled, “To be honest, I’m not confident at all. However, it’s our own effort that makes things happen, right? I want to try. If I succeed, I’ll get everything; if I fail, I’ll just die. What do you think, Brother Yang?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Good luck!”

Huang Ying grinned, and they continued forward. However, they hadn’t gone far before an old man in a black robe appeared before them.

Huang Ying chuckled, “Just a short distance is so difficult to traverse!”

The old man cupped his fist at Huang Ying, “Ninth Prince, I have something to say. I wonder if you’re willing to hear it.”

Huang Ying replied, “Go on.”

The old man said, “Everyone knows what you seek, but allow me to be honest, you’re bringing death upon yourself by joining forces with Yang Ye. He has the Sprite Progenitor, and it's extremely close to him. So, any power that gets the Sprite Progenitor will kill him. It can be said that his fate is sealed!”

Yang Ye glanced at the old man and remained silent. Obviously, these powers wanted to kill him and take Snowy, but they were afraid of Huang Ying. After all, Huang Ying had a colossus like the desolate race standing behind him.

Huang Ying smiled, “Go on.”

The old man spoke solemnly, “Ninth Prince, Yang Ye is a bloodthirsty and ruthless person. So, working with him is no different than creating a conflict of interest for yourself. Ninth Prince, there are countless powers targeting him now, and it can be said that danger is all around you. The slightest mistake may result in eternal damnation.”

Huang Ying smiled, “There’s a large power in Hell World, the Hell Sect. You’re probably from there, right? However, you’re only at the Four World Realm, and you aren’t even at the peak of it. So, you’re probably just an elder or vice master, right?”

The old man glanced at him and remained silent.

Huang Ying added, “After listening to you for so long, allow me to say a few words. The Hell Sect isn’t qualified to interfere in my business!”

The old man gazed at Huang Ying for a long time and said, “Then good luck.”

The old man turned around and left.

Once the old man left, specks of starlight suddenly appeared throughout the sky above the mountain range. It was like a huge net had covered the mountain range, and the ground was trembling. After that, countless threads of golden light appeared on the ground.

Besides that, golden circles of light suddenly appeared in the mountains throughout the surroundings. The circles of light were around 300m wide, and every one of them was linked by a beam of light.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

A formation!

A huge formation!

The formation covered the space throughout the area!

Huang Ying gazed at Yang Ye and smiled, “Brother Yang, looks like we won’t be able to leave safely.”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Then let’s kill.”

Yang Ye understood the situation well. He was in a terrible one. Every power would never let him live, so there was only a single solution for him—kill!

If he had many enemies, he just had to kill until there were none left!

That was how Yang Ye thought!

Huang Ying shot a glance at the sky and said, “Then let’s rest for a while!”

Yang Ye gazed at him, “Rest?”

Huang Ying smiled, “This formation is here to trap us. If I’m not wrong, they’ve probably come to some sort of agreement, and they are gathering experts. Besides that, my brothers are probably gathering their forces too.”

Yang Ye glanced at Huang Ying, “Then why are you still thinking about resting?”

Huang Ying said, “If we break out of the formation now, it’ll be exactly what they want. This formation has no problem trapped around 10 Four World Realm experts. Even if we’re able to break through it, it’ll exhaust a huge amount of our strength. So, isn’t it better to rest and wait for them to do the work for us when they attack?”

Yang Ye shrugged, “Do as you want!”

Yang Ye sat cross-legged and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

In the Primordial Pagoda, powerful auras were rippling incessantly in the rear mountains of the Sword Sect, and it caused the entire Sword Sect to tremble.

Yang Ye hurried over there to Oxxy’s territory, and Snowy appeared before him. She pointed to the right where Oxxy was.

Yang Ye looked along that direction, and he saw Oxxy seated there while waves of powerful aura and pressure ceaselessly rippled out of Oxxy.

Oxxy was advancing!

Snowy waved her paws swiftly while excitement covered her face.

It wasn’t just Oxxy, the others were advancing too!

Obviously, it was the Chaotic Fruit’s work!

A short while later, Oxxy suddenly opened his eyes.

Bang!

A powerful aura surged up from him!

The Three World Realm!

At this moment, Oxxy had attained the Three World Realm!

Moreover, he was at the peak of it!

It could be said that Oxxy could even fight a Four World Realm expert while he held the Primordial Axe of Creation.

Oxxy wasn’t the only one, the Primal Vicious Tiger, Primal True Dragon, and Martial Qilin were at the peak of the Three World Realm too!

All of them had gained a huge improvement in their cultivation!

This gave Yang Ye a new understanding of the Chaotic Fruits which Snowy had been growing!

Heaven defying!

They were truly heaven defying! They were absolute divine treasures!

Suddenly, Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something and vanished on the spot with Snowy. It didn’t take long for them to arrive in Erya’s hall. They were just about to head inside when a powerful wave of pressure rippled out from within.

Bang!

Both of them were blasted over 300m away!

Yang Ye was shocked, and he wondered what the heck she was doing!

Snowy blinked while bewilderment filled her eyes.

Just like that, a long time passed before the hall exploded apart, and it vanished without a trace.

Meanwhile, a voice came from afar, “Big Brother Yang, I’m really hungry!”

Once she finished speaking, she appeared in front of Yang Ye with crimson red eyes!

Suddenly, she grabbed Yang Ye’s thigh and bit it!

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
