Chapter 1651 - Snowy! Lend Me Your Sword!

Translator: InVader

Reason with them? Yang Xuan was slightly stunned, and then her figure vanished on the spot.

Outside the Immortal Phoenix Pavilion, Yang Xuan obstructed Yang Ye’s path again.

She looked him in the eyes, “I know you’re very strong, and you have that woman by your side. However, the Ku Clan is powerful. Understand?”

Yang Ye nodded, “All the large clans are powerful. I understand.”

Yang Xuan asked, “You understand yet still intend to go?”

Yang Ye glanced at Yang Xuan and said, “I’m not going to take it from them, I’m merely going to borrow some from them.”

Yang Xuan asked, “What if they refuse?”

Yang Ye replied, “Then I’ll steal!”

Yang Xuan asked, “What if you fail?”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “Then I’ll take it by force!”

The corners of Yang Xuan’s eyes twitched slightly. She gazed at him for a long time before she said, “The Ku Clan only has a single main line, so it has very few members. However…”

She paused for a moment and continued, “The Ying Clan is the strongest amongst the eight clans, and then it’s our Yang Clan and the Wu Clan. However, do you know that even the Ying Clan wouldn’t rashly offend the Ku Clan! It isn’t just the Ying Clan, even the disciples of our Yang Clan wouldn’t rashly offend the Ku Clan.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Yang Xuan shook her head, “I don’t know the true reason. However, their disciples are very strong.”

Yang Ye nodded. He didn’t say another word and just left. Regardless of how mysterious it was or how strong it was, he still intended to try.

Yang Xuan was about to obstruct Yang Ye again, but An Nanjing suddenly appeared in front of her. An Nanjing glanced coldly at her before turning around and leaving.

Yang Xuan felt speechless.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye, An Nanjing, and Lu Lige to leave Phecda City. Yang Ye gazed at Lu Lige and said, “Brother Lu, I won’t try to thank you. If you need something, just tell me, and I’ll definitely rush over regardless of how far or how severe it is.”

He owed Lu Lige too much for coming to help him. After all, it was the Yang Clan, and the slightest mistake would result in Lu Lige’s death. However, Lu Lige had still come. Moreover, it was all thanks to Lu Lige’s arrival at the critical moment or Little Sky would be dead.

Lu Lige chuckled, “I’m all alone, so what could possibly happen. But you, on the other hand, have to be careful because the Yang Clan’s fight for succession is no ordinary competition.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Brother Lu, it’s best if you don’t come with us to the Ku Clan. Let us go ourselves.”

Lu Lige replied, “I wouldn’t be able to go even if you asked. Because I have to go home. I’m at the Rebirth Realm now, so I can head back home and do some things I couldn’t do in the past.”

Yang Ye asked, “Do you need help?”

Lu Lige shook his head, “I want to do it myself. Take care of yourself!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye nodded, “You too. Farewell”

Lu Lige cupped his fist, “Farewell!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

Once Lu Lige left, Yang Ye turned to look at An Nanjing, “Let’s go as well!”

Their figures vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye suddenly asked as they traveled, “All six of your intents are at the Zenith Rank?”

An Nanjing shook her head slightly, “No!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Then how?”

She replied, “A secret technique. It raises my merged intents into the Zenith Rank for a short while.”

So that’s why! Yang Ye nodded. If An Nanjing had attained the Zenith Rank with all six intents, then it would truly be too terrifying. After all, she was only at the Rebirth Realm. Moreover, her intents had just risen to the Returnal Rank not too long ago. If she’d improved them to the Zenith Rank already, then others could just give up on cultivating.

Even though she hadn’t truly attained the Zenith Rank with her intents, it was still extremely terrifying. It could be said that if True Realm experts don’t show themselves, practically no one can harm her. Of course, there were countless geniuses and experts in this world, so no one dared to say they were really invincible in the same realm of cultivation.

An Nanjing didn’t dare, and Yang Ye didn’t dare either!

It didn’t take long for them to leave Heaven Void Continent and arrive in the boundless starry sky.

The Ku Clan!

Their destination was the mysterious Ku Clan. However, not long after they left the Yang Clan’s territory, they suddenly stopped, exchanged glances, and a wisp of solemness flashed through their eyes.

“I’ve been detected?” Suddenly, a voice resounded, and then a black robed figure suddenly walked out from an expanse of space not too far away from them.

A True Realm expert!

Yang Ye flipped his palm and a sword appeared in his grasp. At the same time, his profound energy started to circulate.

The black robed figure started walking slowly in Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s direction, “I thought about it for a while, and I decided I can’t let both of you live. Otherwise, once you attain the Zenith Realm, even I would probably be no match for you.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stretched his right hand forward and grasped.

Bang!

In an instant, the space around Yang Ye and An Nanjing warped while a mysterious wave of energy slammed down with the intention to obliterate them completely.

Suddenly, a ray of sword energy flashed, and then a ray of golden light flashed off right behind it.

Bang!

In an instant, the space around them collapsed and shattered. Meanwhile, a black shadow appeared behind the black robed man, and then a sword stabbed towards the black robed man’s nape.

At the exact same moment, the black robed man twisted his right palm slightly.

Bang!

A wave of energy suddenly rippled out from his back, and it blasted Yang Ye almost 10km away.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing had appeared in front of the black robed man, and her spear stabbed forward swiftly.

At the instant An Nanjing attacked, the black robed man suddenly stretched out his right hand and tapped the tip of An Nanjing’s spear.

Clang!

Skysplit shook violently, and then the powerful force acting upon it blasted An Nanjing backwards.

However, a ray of sword energy suddenly appeared behind the black robed man at the same time, and the black robed man swiftly turned around and slammed his fist forward.

Bang!

The sword energy was obliterated while Yang Ye was blasted almost 10km away again.

After blasting Yang Ye away, the black robed man took a step forward. Just that step allowed him to instantly appear before Yang Ye, and then he slammed his fist forward again. His punch was extremely ordinary and didn’t even carry any signs of profound energy. As for the space around it, the space here was completely calm and didn’t ripple at all.

However, it was exactly such an attack which made Yang Ye’s expression change drastically. This time, he didn’t dare act carelessly at all. His slaughter intent surged madly out of him and flowed into his sword, and then he raised the sword with both hands before swinging it down.

Bang!

The sword energy dispersed while Yang Ye was blasted flying.

The black robed man was about to follow up with another attack, but An Nanjing suddenly appeared behind him and swung her spear horizontally at his back.

Bang!

The space around the black robed man was instantly blasted into pieces, and the space further away from him had cracked apart. Meanwhile, a ray of sword energy shot over from afar like a bolt of lightning, and the space here couldn’t endure the force of these attacks anymore, causing it to collapse completely.

In an instant, an area of around 10km from where the black robed man was standing had been transformed into a black hole.

Suddenly, the black hole shrunk, and then explosions resounded incessantly.

The explosions within the black hole caused the space around it to tremble violently.

Boom!

Over a dozen breaths of time later, the black hole suddenly exploded apart, and then two figures were blasted out of it.

It was An Nanjing and Yang Ye.

They flew for almost 10km before they finally stopped themselves, and a wisp of scarlet red seeped out from the corner of their mouths once they stopped moving.

Meanwhile, the space there had started to be repaired, and it didn’t take long for a wave of mysterious energy to repair it completely. At the same time, the black robed old man appeared within their fields of vision again.

Yang Ye’s face fell when he witnessed this scene. He knew that he’d underestimated a True Realm expert’s strength.

“Not bad! Not bad!” Meanwhile, the black robed old man spoke abruptly, “Not bad indeed. It’s the first time I’ve seen such a powerful version of the Laws of Darkness. I presume your Laws of Darkness have arrived at the Zenith Rank. Unfortunately, it’s far from enough to kill me.”

Yang Ye suddenly said, “You’re Yang Shen!”

The black robed old man shook his head slightly, “Who I am isn’t important. Don’t you think so too?”

As he spoke, he took a step forward and raised his palm. A moment later, he slowly pressed it downwards.

At the moment his palm started to descend, the space above Yang Ye and An Nanjing suddenly started to overlap and press down towards them. The powerful force within it even caused their figures to ceaselessly descend at a gradual pace.

An Nanjing and Yang Ye exchanged glances, and then they simultaneously stomped their right feet down. After that, Yang Ye and An Nanjing transformed into rays of light that shot up into the sky.

Bang! Bang!

Their joint forces tore apart the space above them, but it didn’t take long for them to stop. At this moment, their faces were quite pale, and more blood was seeping out of the corner of their mouths.

“Needless to say, both of you are truly formidable!” Suddenly, the black robed old man spoke again, “Your natural talent and strength are so formidable that even I feel embarrassed of my own ability. I was far inferior to you at your age! Unfortunately, you’re too young.”

As he spoke, he was about to continue. However, Yang Ye suddenly took a step forward and stretched out his right hand, “Snowy! Lend me your sword!”

Three breaths of time later, he received no reply!

Yang Ye blinked and spoke again, “Snowy! Lend me your sword!”

Another three breaths of time passed but he still received no reply.

Yang Ye’s face became quite unsightly. He hurriedly immersed his consciousness into his body, and his expression became even more unsightly when he saw her.

At this moment, Snowy was snoring on the ground beside Little Sky, and the wooden sword was right under her butt.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
