Chapter 1028 – Warning! Warning!

The black robed woman who was about to jump down as well had instantly stopped on the spot when she heard that roar.

She gazed at it for a long time before she turned around and left.

Shuai Wenyang instantly heaved a sigh of relief when he witnessed this scene. Actually, he was prepared to jump down because the woman’s strength was too terrifying. If she were to attack him, then it would be absolutely impossible for him to survive. But while it was terrifying down there, he wouldn’t die immediately at the very least!

Fortunately, she hadn’t acted against him.

Shuai Wenyang turned around to glance at the abyss, and then he sighed softly, “I’d thought that I gained a companion, but I never expected him to be gone in the blink of an eye. Brother, farewell and good luck!”

...

Yang Ye held the woman in his arms as his figure descended all the way down.

Yang Ye asked, “Do you hear anything?”

Yang Ye continued, “I feel like there are numerous large and horrifying mouths down there waiting for us to fall into them. What do you think?”

She still didn’t speak a word.

Yang Ye spoke again, “I think that we might really be finished this time!” He wasn’t being pessimistic. It was mainly because that thing down there was truly too terrifying. Perhaps he could escape if he was at his peak! Right, he would be able to escape and not defeat it. His intuition told him that the thing down there wasn’t something he could escape in his current state.

The woman suddenly said, “You should never abandon your intent to live no matter what!”

It did make a lot of sense, but it did sound quite like nonsense!

Yang Ye laughed bitterly and said, “I don’t understand. Why did you ask me to jump down earlier? I think that while she’s strong, I might have a chance if I went all out against her!”

The woman replied, “Even 10 of you would be no match for her!”

Yang Ye fell silent for an instant before he said, “Why?” He didn’t think that she’d said that on purpose to make him suffer a blow to his confidence. She wasn’t that kind of person.

The woman explained, “Firstly, she’s a Saint and a genius of the Nether Pavilion. You want to surmount your realm of cultivation and fight her? I think you’re dreaming. Perhaps there are people in the Radiant Dimension who can surmount their realm of cultivation to fight geniuses of the Nether Pavilion, but that absolutely doesn’t include you right now. Secondly, there’s light up there. Even 10 Saints are no match for her while there is light!”

Yang Ye was astounded, “She’s that strong?” Even though he knew that woman, Light Maiden, was very strong, he hadn’t expected her to be so terrifying.

The woman replied, “There are no weaklings in the Nether Pavilion!”

Yang Ye asked solemnly, “What kind of power is it?” He was really curious about the Nether Pavilion.

The woman suddenly asked instead, “You’ve offended the Nether Pavilion?”

Yang Ye nodded and told the truth, “I killed some of its members.”

She raised her head to look at him, and quite some time passed before she spoke, “You’re weak, but you’re absolutely beyond bold.”

Yang Ye was speechless.

She continued, “The Nether Pavilion is very mysterious. Even though it can’t be considered as the strongest power in the Central Divine Prefecture, it can be considered as one of the most mysterious. In short, you’re still very weak and unable to come into contact with that level. You just have to remember that you shouldn’t offend that power if you don’t want to die.”

Yang Ye said, “I seem to have already offended it!”

She replied, “Then good luck to you!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Bang!

Suddenly, both of them smashed against the ground, and the entire ground shook violently.

Hiss!

Yang Ye gasped. Even though his body was very strong, it was impossible to avoid injuries when he fell down from that high. Fortunately, he’d only suffered some minor injuries.

As for the woman, she was on his back, so he’d endured most of the force. Even though she’d been affected by it slightly, it could be completely overlooked.

Yang Ye didn’t dare to lie on the ground and rest. He quickly grabbed the women in his arms and became utterly vigilant. He gazed incessantly at the surroundings. Mountain walls were situated on his right, left, and behind him. When he recalled how he’d been falling for almost an hour just now, Yang Ye gave up on trying to climb up the mountain walls!

Since he couldn’t head back the way he came, he had no choice but to go straight ahead!

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment before he continued forward with the woman in his arms. Besides his footsteps, there was no other sound all along the way. It was extremely quiet!

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “I feel like something is staring at us!”

The woman’s voice carried a trace of seriousness, “Be careful!”

Yang Ye nodded and continued forward. However, he’d slowed down slightly. Yang Ye gradually felt an invisible pressure press down upon him, and it grew stronger the further forward he walked. This caused him to walk even slower than before!

Yang Ye said, “I feel like we’re going ahead to give our lives away. What do you think?”

“After being sealed for countless years, no matter how strong it once was, that beast should have weakened by now.” She spoke calmly, “This world doesn’t tolerate the existence of experts above the Saint Realm. Since it’s here, that proves that it’s not stronger than the Saint Realm. If there’s something different about it when compared to other Saints, it’s that the ferocious beast’s strength far surpasses ordinary Saints.”

Yang Ye lowered his head to look at her, “I’m really curious about why you’re always able to stay calm no matter what you face? Even when I did that to you....”

Yang Ye suddenly shut his mouth because she’d raised her head to look at him. While her gaze was still calm, Yang Ye was able to sense hostility.

A long time passed before she withdrew her gaze and said, “If the heart is calm, then it remains so even if the sky collapses.”

Yang Ye shrugged, “Alright, my mental state is inferior to yours!”

Meanwhile, the woman suddenly said, “Stop!”

Yang Ye immediately stopped when he heard her, “What is it?”

She replied, “Look up!”

Yang Ye raised his head and was shocked. There was a black barrier of light around 3km above him, and it covered the entire area above him. There was strange black energy flowing through it.

Actually, it wasn’t just the area above him. Yang Ye was astounded to notice that the walls around him and the ground beneath him had the same strange black barrier of light covering it!

Yang Ye asked in a low voice, “What is that?”

She glanced at the surroundings, pondered deeply for a moment, and then spoke in a low voice, “It should be a formation that’s specially used to seal powerful and evil beings. Now, the seal has been activated. This isn’t good! That ferocious beast intends to break through the seal!”

Roar!

She’d only just finished speaking when a furious roar resounded from afar!

Rumble! Rumble!

In an instant, the walls around them started to shake violently as if they were on the verge of exploding apart. Meanwhile, Yang Ye’d head was struck by a wave of dizziness. Just like before, he bled from all 7 apertures again. But unlike before, he hadn’t been able to recover quickly. The dizziness he felt this time didn’t lessen but grew stronger and stronger instead!

The woman’s beautiful brows were pressed together when she witnessed this scene, and then she hesitated for an instant before she suddenly opened her mouth and bit Yang Ye’s chest.

The sharp pain caused Yang Ye’s mind to instantly clear up quite a bit, and the dizziness he felt was alleviated greatly. He lowered his head and saw that the woman had released her bite, and she was looking at him instead. Moreover, his blood was still flowing down her lips.

Yang Ye was about to say something when she suddenly stretched out her tongue and licked the blood on her lips, and then she revealed a slightly strange expression.

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. Because she seemed to really like drinking his blood.

Rumble!

Meanwhile, the walls around them started shaking even more violently, and it seemed like they would collapse in a moment!

The woman suddenly said, “It’s trying to break through the seal!”

Yang Ye asked, “What should we do?”

She pondered deeply for an instant and said, “We have 2 choices. The 1st is to leave this world before it breaks through the seal. The 2nd is to stop it from escaping!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why don’t we let it escape and break open this world so that we can leave with it?”

“Are you stupid?” She continued, “Do you know what a ferocious beast is? I don’t have the time to explain it to you. You just have to know that if it does escape, then the first thing it does is definitely to kill everything it sees. Even if it shows benevolence and doesn’t kill us, we’ll definitely die when it destroys this world by force. Escaping this world and destroying this world are 2 completely different things. Understand?”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Based on what you’ve just said, we have no choice but to stop it!”

She said, “There should be a teleportation down here. We just have to find it and teleport out of here before it breaks through the seal. At that time, we won’t be affected regardless of whether it escapes or not!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright. We’ll look for the teleportation formation!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye didn’t speak another word and shot forward.

The further ahead he went, the more terrifying the pressure he suffered became. In the end, Yang Ye felt like a few mountains were pressing down on him, and it was extremely heavy.

This caused both his and the woman’s faces to grow even more solemn!

Yang Ye was growing faster and faster. He knew that he had to find the teleportation formation and leave this place as soon as possible. Otherwise, he might never be able to leave. Because he felt that the ferocious beast was about to escape soon!

A serious expression gradually crept onto the face of the woman in Yang Ye’s arms.

A while later, faint blue light appeared in the distance.

Yang Ye was overjoyed when he noticed the blue light. Because the faint blue light was just like the barrier of light which had sucked them into this world that day!

Yang Ye increased his speed to his limits!

We’ll be there soon! We’re growing closer!

Suddenly, the woman’s anxious voice resounded by his ears, “Stop right now!”

Yang Ye was stunned, but he didn’t hesitate to stop right away.

Thump! Thump! Thump!

The sound of footsteps suddenly resounded.

Every single footstep caused the ground to tremble violently!

Meanwhile, the tiny vortex within Yang Ye suddenly started to revolve. This time, it didn’t just make a single revolution as it had done in the past. It was constantly spinning this time!

It was a warning!

It was a warning from the tiny vortex!
