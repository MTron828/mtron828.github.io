Chapter 2599

At most times, it wasn’t just the sword cultivator that chose a sword, the sword chose its owner too.

In the past, Executor had stayed with Yang Ye mostly because of Chen Xuanan. It could be said that Executor was being used by Yang Ye but not owned by him.

It hadn’t truly submitted to Yang Ye!

The difference between these two was huge!

Willingly being used and just passively allowing itself to be used was quite different.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye fell to the ground once the sword stabbed his heart. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Death!

He sensed the aura of death again.

The pain of being stabbed in the heart!

It was pain unlike that of pain which came from the soul or body. He’d suffered something similar in the past, but this was even more direct because the sword was stabbed into his heart!

However, it didn’t destroy his heart and just entered bit by bit.

It seemed like it was torturing him to death!

Every single bit it entered caused the pain Yang Ye experienced to multiply!

Yang Ye clenched his fists and spoke in pain, “W-What are you trying to do?!”

The sword seemed like it wanted to kill him!

The sword offered no reply and just continued entering him bit by bit.

It didn’t take long for blood to seep out from his heart and surge into Executor.

However, as if it felt that wasn’t enough, the sword went another inch deeper!

Hiss!

A strand of blood sprayed from his heart and flowed into the sword.

Hiss!

In an instant, a sword gradually emerged from Yang Ye’s forehead.

It was completely blood red!

Executor floated quietly in the air, and it didn’t take long for the blood on it to vanish, causing it to return to its original appearance!

Yang Ye was still on the ground. Some time passed before his pale countenance gradually recovered.

Yang Ye stood up, and Executor immediately appeared before him. He stretched out his hand and grabbed it!

Yang Ye was stunned.

Because when he held it right now, it was like he was holding his hand. It was just that natural! Besides that, he sensed that his mind and heart were actually linked to Executor!

It felt like Executor was his own hand, and he just had to will it and Executor would immediately do it!

A part of himself!

It had acknowledged him as its master!

At this moment, Yang Ye knew that this Super Divine Treasure had truly acknowledged him as its master!

It was willingly staying with him, and so using it would be truly fluid, and its might was absolutely not something that it could compete with in the past. Especially now that his strength was far greater than before!

Yang Ye grinned as he gazed at Executor. A moment later, it transformed into a ray of light that vanished in his chest!

It had gone deep within his heart!

It had merged into one with his heart!

Now, his sword would truly move as his heart willed it!

Yang Ye gazed at the remaining swords, the Sword Precursor and Sword Supreme.

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and they returned to human form.

The Sword Precursor and Sword Supreme!

They gazed at him in silence.

Yang Ye smiled, “As far as I’m concerned, both of you aren’t just swords, you are my precious loved ones.”

He stretched out both his hands.

They exchanged glances, and then two swords appeared in Yang Ye’s grasp!

Yang Ye grinned as he gazed at them, “It’s great to have you by my side.”

After experiencing some things, Yang Ye realized the beauty of many things. Now that he was still alive, he planned to cherish everything he had!

Regardless of whether it was the Sword Precursor or Sword Supreme, he didn’t want to lose either of them!

As for their level, he actually didn’t really care about that now.

Super Divine Treasures?

As far as he was concerned, if he wasn’t strong enough, then even the number one treasure in the universe would be useless; but if he was strong enough, then he would still be unmatched even with a stick! He’d understood this principle in the past, but it hadn’t been this deep!

It was naturally all thanks to Qi Bitian!

Yang Ye didn’t leave the Primordial Pagoda. He went to Qi Bitian’s bamboo house. It was empty, and there were two boxes on the table at its center.

They were things Qi Bitian had left him!

One of them contained the inner core fragment she’d obtained from the Divine Abode. According to Yang Ye’s inference, it should belong to Erya.

That box was for Erya!

But the other box was for him!

Qi Bitian had retrieved that box from the Boundless Water.

Yang Ye walked over to it, and Lei Lin suddenly came inside. She knocked the box and gazed at Yang Ye, “Egg!”

She’d wanted to open it a long time ago. Unfortunately, Qi Bitian refused to let her!

Yang Ye rubbed Lei Lin’s head and smiled, and then he gazed at the box. Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to open it.

Yang Ye was stunned when he saw its contents.

It really was an egg!

But it was a broken egg!

The egg was golden, fist-sized, but covered in cracks. It was even missing a piece on the top.

What was inside the egg?

Yang Ye glanced at it curiously, but he was disappointed because there was nothing within it!

It was empty!

“What the heck!” Yang Ye cursed.

Suddenly, the golden egg cracked open before Yang Ye, and it split into around seven pieces!

Yang Ye picked up one of the pieces, scanned it carefully, but wasn’t able to notice anything special about it.

Yang Ye frowned slightly because that was quite unusual. After all, if it really was ordinary, Qi Bitian would have definitely not brought it back with her. She would have never taken a liking to something ordinary.

Since she’d brought it in here and placed it on this table, it was enough to prove that it was not ordinary at all!

However, what was extraordinary about it?

Yang Ye shook his head, placed the shell back into the box, and then wondered, “Whose egg is this?”

In the end, Yang Ye left the bamboo house with Lei Lin. As for the boxes, he left them both in there.

Qi Bitian had definitely left the egg shell behind for a reason.,

Once Yang Ye and Lei Lin left, the cracked apart shell in the box suddenly recovered its original form.

A whole egg!

Moreover, the egg was ceaselessly shaking and jumping about in the box.

Unfortunately, both Yang Ye and Lei Lin had missed this scene.

Yang Ye led Lei Lin to the Ascension Platform. At this moment, all the demons were here, and the Primal True Dragon was at the Lord Realm.

Yang Ye gazed at Oxxy. The latter raised his axe in a very imposing manner.

Oxxy gazed at Yang Ye, “S-Snowy…”

Snowy!

All of the others gazed at Yang Ye. Obviously, they were waiting for an answer from him.

Yang Ye grinned, “She’ll be back very soon! Right, Erya will be back too!”

Erya!

All of them couldn’t help but shudder upon hearing that name!

An hour later, Yang Ye left the pagoda.

At this moment, he wasn’t at Eternal Kingdom, and he was in a spatial passageway.

Yang Ye was quite anxious.

Because Qi Bitian wasn’t really reliable. If she made a mistake and sent him somewhere else like the dark world from before, he would really be finished.

Fortunately, she was quite reliable this time.

Two hours later, Yang Ye left the passageway.

Eternal Kingdom!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and vanished on the spot.

A short while later, Yang Ye arrived at the Ancient Sword Sect. However, it had been transformed into ruins!

Am I too late?

Yang Ye’s face instantly fell. He descended to the ground and scanned the surroundings with his divine sense. However, there were no signs of life in the ruins!

I’m too late!

Yang Ye clenched his fists. However, a woman in a red dress suddenly appeared on Yang Ye’s right!

Yang Ye was astounded, “Second Sister…”

It was Blood Maiden!

She glanced at him, “Come with me!”

Yang Ye nodded and followed her.

Blood Maiden led Yang Ye deep into a boundless mountain range.

Once they descended to the ground, she brought Yang Ye to a mountain wall and tapped it, and then a ray of red light flashed. A short moment later, it cracked open to reveal a passageway.

They went through the passageway and arrived at an underground world.

Yang Ye saw many familiar faces here!

Nether Maiden, Elder Xue…

Most of the sect’s disciples and the others were all here!

Yang Ye finally heaved a sigh of relief!

Yang Ye gazed at Blood Maiden, and the latter spoke indifferently, “Not long after you left, I had a discussion with the Ancient Sword Sect’s elders, and I suggested that they leave the sect and give up the place. Their current strength was utterly insufficient to protect that place, and forcefully trying to keep it will only lead to unnecessary sacrifices. Especially when you aren’t here. So, I made them leave.”

Elder Xue walked over, “Luckily, we left in advance. Not long after we left, the Eternal Kingdom’s forces and the Soul Sect attacked. This time, they brought six peak Lord Realm experts. Obviously, they were serious. Fortunately, we’d left, or we may not have survived that attack!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly and glanced at the surroundings, “Is this place safe?”

Blood Maiden was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly looked to the side. Blood Maiden spoke indifferently, “I’m afraid it isn’t!”

A few powerful auras were approaching from the outside.

Obviously, this place had been discovered!

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “I’ll be back in a moment!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished into the distance…
