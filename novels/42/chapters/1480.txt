Chapter 1481 – Tired Of Living!

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched when he saw that wave of pressure slam down in his direction. Why am I that unfortunate?

Just training with a sword technique made me offend a Dualism Realm expert?

This time, he really hadn’t caused trouble on purpose!

He’d actually executed the Rebirth Sword instinctively just now. The reason he’d done that was that he’d realized something and felt enlightened, so he instinctively executed it.

However, he hadn’t expected that there was another Dualism Realm expert on that mountain!

What should I do? Yang Ye’s mind was spinning quickly.

Meanwhile, Lian Banzhuang appeared in front of Yang Ye. She stared fixedly at him with a murderous gaze. At this moment, she seemed to be in quite an embarrassing state. There were cuts all over her robe. Even though it wasn’t that severe to the extent of exposing her figure, it did look quite embarrassing. Especially at the side of her ear, there was a very fine and almost unnoticeable injury there.

Yang Ye’s attack had been too abrupt and too strong. Coupled with the fact that she’d been caught off guard, it had caused her to fall into such a state.

Yang Ye smiled with embarrassment when he saw her murderous gaze, “I... I didn’t do that on purpose. I really didn’t.”

Her eyes narrowed slightly while ghastly killing intent filled them. Meanwhile, the pressure from before had arrived above them.

A cold glow flashed through her eyes, and then she turned around and slapped her palm forward.

Bang!

The pressure vanished.

Meanwhile, a black robed old man appeared not too far away from them. At this moment, the old man was in a worse state than the woman. His black robe had been transformed into rags. Especially the lower part of his robe, it seemed like a dress. Besides that, there was a bleeding cut on his face.

At this moment, the black robed old man’s face was very unsightly, or it should be said to be ferocious!

I’m in trouble now! Yang Ye had an even more bitter expression on his face when he saw the old man’s face.

The black robed old man paid no attention to Yang Ye, and his gaze descended onto Lian Banzhuang instead, “Lian Banzhuang, we’ve coexisted in harmony until now, so why launch a surprise attack on me while I was in deep sleep?”

Lian Banzhuang was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly stepped forward, and he said, “Senior, er.... It wasn’t Miss Lian, it... it was me.”

Lian Banzhuang gazed at Yang Ye when she heard this, and a trace of surprise flashed through her eyes. Obviously, she hadn’t expected him to take the initiative to bear responsibility.

The old man’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye when he heard this. He sized up Yang Ye, and then he frowned, “A Voider? How could a Voider have possibly got here?”

Yang Ye smiled with embarrassment, “That’s a long story.”

The old man asked, “You said that you destroyed the mountain?”

Yang Ye nodded and spoke seriously, “Indeed. It has nothing to do with Miss Lian. Moreover, I have no intention to offend you, Senior. It was just....”

“What nonsense!” The old man suddenly roared with fury, “Do you think I’m an idiot? A Voider like you could destroy the defensive restrictions on my mountain?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, the old man suddenly gazed at Lian Banzhuang, “What? Lian Banzhuang, you dare not admit what you’ve done? That doesn’t seem like your style!”

There was nothing wrong with the old man, and it was just because he didn’t believe Yang Ye had the ability to execute such a formidable attack. What a joke! How could a Voider possibly possess such terrifying strength? So, he’d subconsciously felt that it was Lian Banzhuang because she possessed such strength.

At this moment, Lian Banzhuang had quite an unsightly expression on her face. However, she didn’t explain because she knew that any explanation was useless. Not to mention the old man, even Lian Banzhuang didn’t really believe that Yang Ye had executed that attack. After all, Yang Ye was just a Voider! But that attack had even come close to injuring her!

Even though she was very angry, there was even more shock in her heart.

Meanwhile, the old man spoke in a low voice, “Lian Banzhuang, this isn’t over until you give me an explanation!”

“An explanation?” Lian Banzhuang spoke coldly, “What sort of explanation do you want?”

The old man was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly spoke, “Senior, it really has nothing to do with Miss Lian. A man always takes responsibility for his actions. It really was me.”

Shirk away from taking responsibility?

In the beginning, he’d thought of that. But if he dared to do that, then based on her character, she would definitely attack and kill him right away. Even if one intended to play tricks, it depended heavily on the target. She didn’t like him at all, so if he were to play such tricks on her, then it would definitely lead to terrible consequences.

Lian Banzhuang glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent.

The old man’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye. He gazed at Yang Ye, and then he gazed at Lian Banzhuang before a wisp of ridicule arose on the corners of his mouth, “Lian Banzhuang, you’re a Dualism Realm expert at any rate, yet you can’t even compare to a Voider. Since you refuse to give me an explanation, then I’ll get it myself!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man shot towards Lian Banzhuang.

Lian Banzhuang’s face instantly became icy cold when she saw the old man attack, “You old dog! I don’t mind sending you on your way if you’re tired of living!”

As soon as she finished speaking, her figure vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye was stunned when he saw them engage each other in battle. Why doesn’t anyone believe me when I tell the truth?

Yang Ye moved around 30km away. A battle between two Dualism Realm experts wasn’t something he could interfere in. Especially at a time like this. He’d just executed the Rebirth Sword. Even though he hadn’t suffered from any backlash, it had exhausted too much profound energy. Just a single attack had completely exhausted all the profound energy within him and the Worldmend Stone!

However, it was within his expectations. The person who created the technique had been at the Dualism Realm at least, but he was just a Voider. Based on the volume of profound energy that a Voider possessed, it was definitely insufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Rebirth Sword. So, it was normal for him to have insufficient profound energy. Fortunately, he had the Worldmend Stone, so he could execute it!

He didn’t know if it could kill a Dualism Realm expert, but he had no doubt that it could pose a threat to Dualism Realm experts. As for Deities.... If he were to encounter that rock titan again or even if he went up against the Ancient Emperor Python again, the Rebirth Sword would be sufficient to kill them in an instant!

The only sad part was that it used too much profound energy, and just utilizing it once exhausted all his profound energy. Fortunately, his body had advanced to the Undying Realm, so even if he didn’t have profound energy, ordinary Deities couldn’t harm him at all.

He’d intended to cultivate Elemental Breaker and the Undying Elemental Body as well, but now it would seem like he didn’t have the time. He’d almost wasted half a month now, and both those techniques would take another half a month at least. At that time, his strength would grow tremendously, but he wouldn’t have much time.

After all, if he couldn’t obtain the Spring of Life, then it would be pointless even if he could cultivate the Sword of Rebirth successfully. As for the Spring of Life.... Even if he could leave this place, was he guaranteed to obtain the Spring of Life? What if he couldn’t obtain it? Or perhaps he couldn’t leave this place?

The important matter at hand was to deal with his lifespan!

Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground. He paid no attention to Lian Banzhuang or the old man, and he just withdrew divine crystals and started absorbing the energy within them. Their battle wasn’t something he could interfere in, nor was it something he could dissuade. Because both of their tempers had flared, so if he tried to persuade them to stop, then not only would he fail, he might suffer instead!

Around an hour later, Yang Ye’s profound energy had been fully replenished. However, the old man and Lian Banzhuang were still fighting high above in the sky.

Flee?

Such a thought had appeared in Yang Ye’s mind. After all, it was the best opportunity to flee. Because regardless of whether it was the old man or Lian Banzhuang, both of them definitely didn’t have the time to pay any attention to him.

Bang!

Suddenly, a loud explosion resounded in the sky, and then the entire sky shook violently. It seemed like the sky was about to collapse!

This is the strength of Dualism Realm experts?

How strong!

Yang Ye had an extremely solemn expression on his face as he looked up into the sky. Dualism Realm experts seemed to have grasped an energy that was stronger than the energy of time or the five elements, the energy of Yin and Yang. He’d experienced the strength of the energy of Yin and Yang. It wasn’t something Deities could resist at all. Many people had never returned after passing through to the other side of Yellow Springs River. Besides the fact that they couldn’t find their way back, there was one other reason, and it was the people and demon beasts here. They weren’t existences that the cultivators from the outside world could resist.

Rumble!

Suddenly, numerous explosions resounded in the sky. But it only took a moment for the sky to fall silent once more. After that, a ray of light flashed through the sky, and then Lian Banzhuang appeared in front of Yang Ye.

At this moment, Lian Banzhuang’s face was quite pale while a trace of blood could be seen on the corner of her mouth. Besides that, she had quite a ferocious expression on her face.

Yang Ye asked softly, “Are... are you alright?” At the same time, he became vigilant in his heart. She wasn’t a nice person, so she might launch a lethal strike against him at any moment.

The reason he hadn’t fled was mainly because other places here might be more dangerous than Lian Banzhuang’s territory.

At the very least, she wouldn’t kill him for now.

That was what he thought earlier, yet he didn’t think the same now. The way she looked at him right now seemed like she really wanted to kill him. It made sense because she’d been blamed for his actions, so she would definitely be extremely unhappy.

She said, “You didn’t flee?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and spoke seriously, “As a man, I should bear responsibility for what I’ve done. So, how can I possibly run?”

“Bear responsibility?” She nodded and said, “Very good. Now, he’s injured, so go kill him.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of her mouth, “What? You don’t dare to?”

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment, and then he said, “I’m at fault for making you suffer the blame for my actions. So, just be frank about what you want. There’s no need to be so sarcastic. In any case, let me warn you in advance that I won’t take my own life. If you want to kill me and force me to go berserk, then let me tell you that even I’m afraid of myself when I do that!”

Her gaze became icy cold. She was about to speak when a huge pitch black palm suddenly appeared out of thin air above them.

Boom!

The place they were standing at had been instantly transformed into a huge abyss!
