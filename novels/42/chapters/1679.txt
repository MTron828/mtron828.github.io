Chapter 1680 - He Didn’t Have One!

The Stellar Sword Diagram!

Even though it was just a treasure that used to be considered as surpassing the known ranks of quality and could be considered to be a treasure a rank beneath the Zenith Rank, its might mainly depended on the user’s strength and sword intent!

Especially sword intent!

No matter what type of sword energy it was, all of them depended on sword intent. Of course, some rare sword cultivators were an exception to this.

At the moment the surroundings transformed into a starry sky, Yang Ye tossed the Sword Precursor up into the air, and then countless rays of stellar sword energy descended from the sky. At this moment, the entire city seemed like it was being illuminated by the Sun.

However, it didn’t take long for the stellar sword energy to converge towards the center. In the end, they overlapped incessantly and formed just a hundred beams of sword energy. After that, those hundred beams of sword energy descended like thunderbolts towards Yang Ru’s group. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ru and the others’ expressions changed when they saw the sword energy descend.

Because after the sword energy overlapped, the energy contained within those 100 beams of sword energy had become even more terrifying. Most importantly, the sword energy was enhanced by two types of intents!

Zenith Rank slaughter intent!

Zenith Rank sword intent!

Yang Ye possessed Zenith Rank sword intent now. The method he’d come up with in the Primordial Pagoda had worked. His sword intent had finally arrived at his limits while being tempered by the Divine Yin Flame, it had finally attained the zenith!

With Zenith Rank slaughter intent and sword intent to enhance them, the energy contained within the stellar sword energy was simply terrifying to the extreme!

Even though enhancing sword energy with slaughter intent would greatly improve its strength, the effects were far inferior to sword intent!

Especially when both his slaughter intent and sword intent contained Unyielding Will, it made the strength of those 100 beams of stellar sword energy to arrive at their limits.

Coupled with the fact that Yang Ye was at the Rebirth Realm now, he was able to control the Stellar Sword Diagram even better than before. So, the stellar sword energy was more terrifying than his Sword of Rebirth!

Yang Ye controlled the stellar sword energy to descend upon Yang Ru’s group.

Stellar sword energy crisscrossed through the area!

AH! AH! AH! AH!

Numerous shrill cries resounded incessantly.

It was a slaughter!

A true slaughter!

The Zenith Realm experts were practically unable to fight back when facing the stellar sword energy. In just a short three breaths of time, a few had already been killed.

“Destroy the starry sky around us!” Suddenly, Yang Ru’s voice resounded, and then a beam of white light shot up into the sky and exploded.

Boom!

The starry sky shook violently, and then the space in the surroundings seemed to be ethereal.

Yang Ru and the others were delighted by this, and they intended to attack again. However, Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot, and he was within their group when he appeared again. After that, countless rays of sword energy erupted from amidst them.

Hiss! Hiss!

Two Zenith Realm experts were caught off guard and had their heads chopped off. At the same time, powerful slaughter intent and sword intent pushed all of them around 1km away.

Yang Ye’s assault instantly threw Yang Ru’s group into chaos, and the stellar sword energy instantly killed a few more Zenith Realm experts.

“Yang Ye!” Suddenly, Yang Ru roared with fury, and then he transformed into a ray of white light that shot towards Yang Ye who was slaughtering his forces.

However, Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot, and he was behind another Zenith Realm expert.

Hiss!

A head flew up into the air while accompanied by a torrent of blood.

At the moment that head flew up into the air, Yang Ye had vanished again, and he appeared behind another Zenith Realm expert.

Hiss!

The head of another Zenith Realm expert flew up into the air.

At this moment, the remaining Zenith Realm experts, Lu Yuanzhan, and the linen robed old man were slightly anxious.

At this moment, they noticed that they’d far underestimated Yang Ye’s strength.

Yang Ye’s current strength had completely surpassed the Yang Ye they’d met that day. Yang Ye’s overall strength had undergone a qualitative leap. Coupled with the stellar sword energy, which was keeping them busy, they weren’t a threat to Yang Ye at all.

As for Yang Ye’s Laws of Darkness, it had become a nightmare to them!

A ray of light flashed, and a head would drop!

“Ignore him and destroy this space!” Suddenly, Yang Ru’s voice resounded again, and then countless beams of white light swept out from him. At the same time, the linen robed old man and Lu Yuanzhan hurriedly attacked as well.

Their joint forces caused the starry sky around them to grow even more ethereal. Ten breaths of time later, an explosion finally resounded as it shattered.

The stellar sword energy vanished, and the surroundings returned to normal.

However, there were 17 corpses lying on the ground, and most of them were headless.

Even though Yang Ru, Lu Yuanzhan, and the linen robed old man were still alive, their bodies were covered in no less than a dozen cuts. Especially Lu Yuanzhan, one of his ears was missing.

At this moment, all three of them had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces. Especially Yang Ru. Those Zenith Realm experts were mostly experts that he’d fostered over numerous years, and some were external support he’d drawn over to his side. Yet now, all of them were gone!

All of them were gone!

Yang Ru’s face grew even more unsightly!

Yang Ye angled his sword towards the ground, and then he gazed at Yang Ru’s group, “Was that fun?”

Actually, he wanted to kill Yang Ru, the old man, and Lu Yuanzhan, but he wasn’t confident in his ability to kill them with one strike. Once he failed to do that, he would have wasted time. Moreover, it may allow the enemy to converge together. If they were able to group together, then it would be very difficult for him to kill them one by one!

So, he’d targeted those who were easy to kill!

Yang Ru’s face was instantly covered in a ferocious expression when he heard Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, you…”

“Shut up! If you want to fight, then fight, stop talking nonsense!” As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

The Sword of Rebirth!

After it was enhanced by Zenith Rank slaughter intent and sword intent, the Sword of Rebirth’s might had risen to a new high. Especially when his intents carried his Unyielding Will.

Everywhere it passed, space instantly cracked open!

Lu Yuanzhan’s expression changed when he witnessed this scene. Because once the fight for succession began, the space in Phecda City had been fortified by the experts of the Yang Clan. It could be said that even True Realm experts would find it difficult to break open the space here. Yet now, Yang Ye had actually cracked open space!

He could imagine how terrifying Yang Ye’s attack was!

Yang Ru’s expression had changed as well. He waved his hands and countless beams of white light instantly surged out from him. They converged together to form a huge ball of light that protected him behind it.

The ray of light arrived before him.

Bang!

In an instant, the space in a huge area shook violently, and then the ball of light rumbled and exploded into bits. Countless waves of terrifying energy swept out from the point of collision while Yang Ru’s figure was blasted over 3km away.

Meanwhile, a ray of light tore through the waves of energy, and it instantly arrived before Yang Ru.

Suddenly, an energy palm appeared on Yang Ye’s left, causing Yang Ye’s eyes to narrow slightly. He changed his attack’s trajectory and directed it towards the left.

Bang!

The energy palm was obliterated. Meanwhile, Yang Ru had converged with Lu Yuanzhan and the linen robed old man.

At this moment, all of them had extremely vigilant expressions on their faces.

Yang Ye’s strength had completely exceeded their expectations!

Yang Ru stared at Yang Ye, “How could you have become so strong? You…”

“Shut the hell up!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was behind Yang Ru when he appeared again.

Yang Ru’s expression changed drastically when he noticed this. He was about to defend himself when Yang Ye suddenly vanished again.

As soon as Yang Ye’s figure vanished once more, the linen robed old man’s expression had changed drastically because Yang Ye had appeared behind him.

A diversion!

The old man was horrified. A terrifying aura surged out from him. However, it was instantly sliced open by Yang Ye’s sword that carried his Unyielding Slaughter Intent and Unyielding Sword Intent!

Hiss!

After that, the old man’s head flew up into the air while accompanied by a torrent of blood!

Once he killed the old man, Yang Ye vanished on the spot again.

“Watch out!” Yang Ru’s shocked voice suddenly resounded.

Lu Yuanzhan’s expression had instantly changed when Yang Ye’s figure vanished. He was about to flee when two terrifying waves of intent pressed down upon him, causing his body to stiffen for a moment.

Hiss!

At that exact moment, Lu Yuanzhan’s head flew up into the air.

Instant annihilation!

After he comprehended the Unyielding Will and improved his sword intent, Yang Ye’s strength had arrived at a new height. Especially the Unyielding Will, it hadn’t just improved his physical strength, it had improved his sword intent and slaughter intent.

It could be said that he wasn’t just able to kill Half-Step True Realm experts, he could even fight True Realm experts. Of course, a gap still existed between them, but he wouldn’t be completely suppressed like he had been in the past.

While Yang Ye killed Lu Yuanzhan, Yang Ru had fled towards the distance. At the same time, numerous rays of white light surged out from him and overlapped behind him.

At this moment, he was truly afraid.

Yang Ye gazed at Yang Ru, “Now, we can fight one on one.”

Yang Ru stared at Yang Ye for a long time before he smiled, “Yang Ye, I can’t kill you, but someone will. I’ll be watching!”

As he spoke, he flipped his right palm, and a talisman shot up into the air. In an instant, a beam of light enveloped him, and then he vanished on the spot.

He’d given up on the competition!

Yang Ru had withdrawn!

He’d withdrawn so that he could stay alive!

Yang Ye fell silent. He’d heard about it from Yang Xuan. Once the fight for succession began, if a young master felt that he wasn’t able to continue, then he could choose to give up. That talisman was the talisman that would keep them safe. It could be used to escape and stay alive. Every participating young master had one.

However… Yang Ye didn’t have one!
