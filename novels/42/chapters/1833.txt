Chapter 1834 – Footsteps!

The Enlightened Realm? Yang Ye was stunned. The Enlightened Realm was above the True Realm.

But wasn’t there supposed to be no Enlightened Realm experts in this world?

What the heck is going on?

Suddenly, the treant took a step forward, and then a root shot out from it.

Bang!

A muffled explosion resounded, and then Nether Dream was blasted 3km away!

The treant was about to attack again, but a ray of blood red light tore through space and appeared before it. But it merely took an instant for a wave of powerful aura to sweep out from within it, and then the blood red light vanished without a trace! It was like it was never there!

Blood Maiden’s face fell at the sight of this. The treant’s strength had far surpassed her imagination!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye appeared by her side, “Second Sister, be careful. That fellow is at the Enlightened Realm.”

“The Enlightened Realm?” Blood Maiden frowned. She was about to speak when the treant suddenly vanished on the spot.

At this moment, Yang Ye and the others’ expressions changed drastically.

An instant later, they felt a wave of extremely terrifying pressure, and it almost suffocated them.

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to twist his wrist, and the wooden sword emanated rays of light. The pressure around him was instantly alleviated, but a pitch black root had arrived before him.

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted slightly. He raised his sword and swung it.

Hiss!

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted over 3km away. However, there was a piece of wood where he was standing just a moment ago.

Rumble!

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden and the others had attacked. Their joint forces crushed the pressure, and the surroundings returned to normal.

They gazed at Yang Ye. Or to be more precise, they gazed at the wooden sword in Yang Ye’s grasp.

Meanwhile, Nether Dream said, “That treant’s defenses are stronger than yours. You can fight it by yourself and see who’s superior!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Blood Maiden suddenly said, “Your wooden sword can pierce through its defenses!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. He knew that it could, but he was no match for the treant!

Suddenly, the treant gazed at him.

Yang Ye’s expression changed at the sight of this. An instant later, a pitch black root suddenly emerged out of space. Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to swing his sword at it. This time, he was holding his sword in his right hand. At the same time, the image of a beast had appeared on his right arm.

The Ancient Spirit Python!

He didn’t dare to hold back against the treant. So, he’d used the Wargod’s arm and the Ancient Spirit Python!

At this moment, his strength was at his limits!

Hiss!

The root shattered into pieces that rained down towards the surroundings. Meanwhile, Yang Ye was blasted flying. However, he merely flew for less than 300m before he stopped himself.

But it only took a moment for a root that was many times larger to suddenly appear before Yang Ye.

It was absolutely swift to the point that he couldn’t even react in time!

Bang!

Yang Ye was caught off guard and blasted away. He flew for almost 6km. Once he managed to reach the ground, his feet scraped against the ground as his figure moved another 1km back before he could finally stop himself.

There was a huge trench before him. It had been created by his feet.

The treant was about to attack again. But Yang Ye suddenly raised his hands, “Brother, I surrender!”

Blood Maiden and the others were stunned speechless.

The Treant stopped for a moment. Obviously, it hadn’t expected that Yang Ye would do that.

Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “Brother, we didn’t come here with ill intent. We’re just here to look for someone.”

Even though he said that, Yang Ye had still become vigilant and was ready to attack at any moment.

Blood Maiden and the others were the same.

The surroundings suddenly fell silent.

A short while passed before the treant spoke abruptly, “There are no humans here!”

It can speak! Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief because the situation would be even more difficult to deal with if the treant couldn’t speak.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “The person we’re looking for came here many years ago. Right, it’s a woman. Do you know her?”

The treant fell silent for a moment, and then it suddenly started trembling violently.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. What the heck is that fellow doing?

“Damnable woman!” Suddenly, the treant roared with fury, and then it swept its arms at Yang Ye and the others.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

In an instant, countless roots rained down like a storm towards Yang Ye and the others.

What the heck? Yang Ye was quite stunned. He really couldn’t figure out why it suddenly attacked!

Blind Maiden and Blood Maiden were about to attack when Nether Dream suddenly appeared before them. After that, Nether Dream stretched her hands forward and waved them lightly. A black ball of energy suddenly appeared in front of her.

A moment later, it exploded apart.

Rumble!

In an instant, countless black blades of light flashed out from the ball. They shot towards the roots in succession. Even though they weren’t able to sever the roots, they obstructed all of them.

Nether Dream gazed at Blood Maiden and Blind Maiden, “I can’t kill that tree. Shall we leave or stay?”

Blood Maiden fell silent for a long time, and then she gazed at the tree, “It definitely knows something about the pavilion master. Otherwise, it wouldn’t react like that.” She gazed at Nether Dream and continued, “Instructor, don’t you want to know where the pavilion master is?”

Nether Dream fell silent.

She naturally wanted to know what happened to Shao Siyou. Because Shao Siyou had never emerged after entering this place. As for her, she’d been guarding the area outside for countless years. She’d thought that Shao Siyou would be in here, but now it seemed like Shao Siyou wasn’t here.

Since she wasn’t here, where was she?

Meanwhile, Nether Dream gazed at Blood Maiden, “Attack together.” She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Chop it with your sword!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished on the spot. In an instant, numerous mysterious black footprints appeared in the sky.

The Nether Ghoststeps!

Blood Maiden didn’t hesitate to transform into a ray of blood red light that shot towards the treant. Blind Maiden similarly charged forward while emanating a terrifying aura.

Only Yang Ye remained here.

Yang Ye stayed silent for a few moments, and then he tapped his right foot down. His figure transformed into a ray of light that shot towards the treant.

Right when he was around 15m away from the treant, the treant suddenly gazed at him. A moment later, a root emerged from the ground in front of Yang Ye. Yang Ye was shocked by this and quickly swung his sword!

Hiss!

The root was instantly sliced into two. However, Yang Ye was blasted away as well. At the instant his figure was blasted away, another root suddenly appeared in front of him.

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted slightly. This time, he didn’t hold his sword with just a single hand, and he grabbed it with both hands before swinging it down.

Boom!

The root before him shattered into bits. But Yang Ye’s figure was pushed over 1km back by the aftershock.

Once he stopped himself, Yang Ye glanced at Blood Maiden and the others. His heart fell when he saw the situation they were in.

They were barely able to resist the treant’s roots, and they were utterly unable to cause any material harm to it.

They were in a defensive position. All three of them could only defend themselves. Nether Dream could counterattack from time to time, but the treant’s defenses were too shocking. So, her counterattacks didn’t do much!

I can’t let this go on! Yang Ye looked up at the treant, and then he vanished on the spot.

The Grand Teleportation Technique combined with Split Second!

In just an instant, Yang Ye appeared before the treant, and then the wooden sword stabbed into the treant’s forehead.

The surroundings fell silent.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief as he gazed at the treant. It’s finally over.

However, Hou Qing’s voice suddenly resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Kid! Watch out!”

As soon as Hou Qing finished speaking, the treant suddenly moved. Its right fist slammed against Yang Ye’s stomach.

Boom!

Yang Ye’s figure curled inwards and was blasted over 6km away!

Once he stopped himself, Yang Ye looked up at the treant while a puzzled expression filled his eyes. That attack has pierced through the treant’s head, but it was actually still able to fight!

Suddenly, Nether Dream said, “That wasn’t a lethal point for it!”

Yang Ye glanced at the treant’s forehead. Sure enough, there was nothing there.

Yang Ye’s face instantly became unsightly because he knew that attack had been wasted.

Meanwhile, the treant suddenly gazed at him, and then a powerful aura locked onto him.

Yang Ye’s face twitched when he witnessed this. He knew that the treant planned to target him!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and started walking towards the treant.

Aura!

He was accumulating aura!

The treant, which was about to attack, had suddenly frozen on the spot, and then it started to move backwards.

Yang Ye was stunned by this scene, and then he felt delighted. It’s afraid of me?

Yang Ye didn’t think further about it. He just continued forward, and he even released his sword intent and slaughter intent. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The treant’s retreat gradually quickened, and it even revealed undisguised fear.

At this moment, Yang Ye’s backbone grew even straighter, and he started walking faster.

Yang Ye gazed at Blood Maiden and Blind Maiden while complacency filled his eyes. However, he noticed that they weren’t looking at him; they were looking behind him. Moreover, there was deep fear within Nether Dream’s eyes.

Yang Ye stopped moving. He suddenly realized that something seemed off.

Tap! Tap!

Meanwhile, the sound of footsteps resounded from behind him.

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
