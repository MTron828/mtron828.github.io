Chapter 1229 – How Bloody! How Brutal! How Brave!

When Yang Ye’s figure appeared once more, he was in front of Yun Tianming, and he slammed his fist against Yun Tianming’s stomach.

Pu!

Yun Tianming was caught off guard, and he hadn’t even been able to recover from his shock before sharp pain came from his stomach. After that, he spat out a few mouthfuls of blood before his figure was blasted away.

However, his figure had just started flying backward when Yang Ye’s hand clamped down on his throat, and then he was slammed repeatedly against the ground. In just a few breaths of time, he’d been slammed against the ground for more than 100 times.

At this moment, even the entire Imperial Oceanic Shuttle was trembling.

“How dare you!” Meanwhile, the black robed old man and the others had recovered from their shock, and he roared furiously as he stretched his hand out and claws at Yang Ye. However, it didn’t take long for him to pull his hand back.

Because Yang Ye was holding Yun Tianming’s barely breathing figure in front of him!

Everyone on the shuttle was looking at Yang Ye. They hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually dare to attack. After all, it was Oceanview City’s territory!

However, they were quite shocked as well. They were shocked by Yang Ye’s strength. After all, Yun Tianming was a Quasi Emperor, yet he didn’t even have the strength to fight back against Yang Ye!

The black robed old man gazed at Yang Ye and spoke fiercely, “Do you want to die?”

Yang Ye paid no attention to the old man. He just tossed Yun Tianming to the ground and stomped his foot down on Yun Tianming’s stomach. He looked down at Yun Tianming and said, “Now, let me ask you something. Do you know what sort of trash you are? If you don’t, then let me tell you. You’re a piece of useless trash.”

Yang Ye chuckled at this point and said, “You spoke such words to me earlier, and I’m giving it back to you now. However, there’s a difference. What’s the difference? The difference is that you used words while I’m using facts to speak those words to you.”

Yun Tianming was looking at Yang Ye. His face was completely swollen so while his eyes were opened, it was no different to when they were closed. Even then, everyone could still discern the killing intent and resentment in his eyes.

The black robed old man’s group of 3 were looking at Yang Ye as well. However, they didn’t dare act because Yun Tianming was in Yang Ye’s hands.

“You really concealed your strength well!” Suddenly, Qin Sanguan walked over and said, “But I’ve said it before. No one is allowed to fight on the shuttle. Are you looking down on me by attacking someone right now?”

“Actually, I’m someone who likes to abide by the rules!” Yang Ye gazed at Qin Sanguan and said, “But I don’t like it when I abide by the rules, but others don’t, yet someone wants to use those same rules to restrain me. Manager Qin, that black robed old man used the aura of an Emperor to bully Miss Yun just now. Don’t tell me that you didn’t notice.”

Qin Sanguan gazed at Yang Ye for a short while and said, “I really didn’t!”

Yang Ye smiled, “But you saw me, right?”

Qin Sanguan nodded slightly, “Indeed!”

“You clearly intend to bully me!” Yang Ye smiled, “Since it’s like that, we have nothing to talk about.”

“I never intended to discuss anything with you!” Qin Sanguan started walking towards Yang Ye. However, a shrill cry suddenly resounded from Yun Tianming. Everyone looked over and saw him spitting out blood repeatedly while his face had warped.

“How dare you!” The black robed old man was furious. He clenched his fists yet didn’t dare attack.

Qin Sanguan didn’t stop and was still walking in Yang Ye’s direction. Even though he hadn’t released his aura as an Emperor, an invisible force was pressing down upon Yang Ye.

It was a psychological attack!

Perhaps it would work on others, but if it was Yang Ye....

Crack!

Yang Ye suddenly grabbed Yun Tianming’s right arm, and then it was forcefully torn off.

AH!!!

A miserable and shrill cry resounded throughout the shuttle.

The pupils of all the spectators constricted. How bloody! How brutal! How brave!

Qin Sanguan stopped. While his face was calm as he looked at Yang Ye, his body was emanating a dangerous aura that caused the hearts of others to palpitate.

As for the black robe man’s group, their faces had turned pale. They hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually dare to do that while standing before 4 Emperors. Now, they stopped doubting that Yang Ye would dare to kill Yun Tianming.

Yun Banqing glanced at Yang Ye. She didn’t say anything and just moved closer to him.

Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto Qin Sanguan, “Looks like you really care about his fate. I’m really curious about his connection to you.”

“The Yun Clan and Qin Clan have had a friendly relationship for years.” Yun Banqing explained.

“So that’s why!” Yang Ye nodded, “Manager Qin, I don’t have any other request. Just send me to Sword God Island, alright?” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Are you threatening me?” Manager Qin’s eyes narrowed slightly. This time, the killing intent in his eyes seemed material.

Yang Ye shrugged, “I can’t do anything if you want to think of it like that!”

Qin Sanguan clenched his fists. Meanwhile, the black robed old man hurriedly walked over to Qin Sanguan, “Brother Qin, my young master’s safety is the most important thing!”

Qin Sanguan glanced at the old man and replied, “Then deal with it yourself!” As soon as he finished speaking, he shot a glance at Yang Ye before turning around and leaving.

“This is my Yun Clan’s business, and it isn’t related to you at all. So why interfere!?” The black robed old man spoke in a low voice. This time, he didn’t act overbearingly because he noticed that this fellow before him didn’t submit to that at all.

Yun Banqing gazed at Yang Ye as well when she heard the old man. Even she was really curious about why Yang Ye was helping her.

“Actually, I didn’t want to do this!” Yang Ye shrugged. He really didn’t. Even though he didn’t know Yun Banqing for long, he’d gotten to know her, so he wasn’t really able to stand by idly as the old man bullied her. But he hadn’t expected that the matter would become so complicated.

Actually, he merely wanted to help Yun Banqing in the beginning, and he had no intention to hit Yun Tianming. But in the end, once he found out about Yun Tianming’s intentions, he didn’t just want to hit Yun Tianming, he wanted to kill Yun Tianming. He had a younger sister as well, and his younger sister held an exalted position in his heart. But Yun Tianming actually wanted his own sister....

Yang Ye was truly disgusted to the extreme!

So, such a string of events had occurred.

“You possess extraordinary strength, so I presume your background isn’t ordinary!” The old man spoke in a low voice, “I wonder if you’ve heard of the Veiled Region’s Yun Clan?”

“The Yun Clan?” Yang Ye shook his head, “I haven’t.”

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he didn’t speak further.

Yang Ye turned to look at Yun Banqing and spoke via voice transmission. “What are the Yun Clan and that Qin Clan? Diamond Rank powers?”

Yun Banqing remained silent.

Yang Ye asked, “You can’t tell me?”

She shook her head and spoke via voice transmission, “The Veiled Region is a world that many Voiders from all those years ago joined forces to create. Many clans and sects are living in seclusion there, and the Yun Clan is one of them!”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “The World Devastator Cult is there as well?”

She nodded, “It is. However, they are finished.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Yun Banqing replied, “They sent out around 70% of their Emperors to destroy the Sword Alliance, but they were annihilated instead. Moreover, their Voider seems to have vanished as well. Without Emperors and a Voider to protect it, the fate that awaits them is either being kicked out of the Veiled Region or being swallowed by other powers!”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Do you know about the Sword Alliance?”

She nodded, “I’ve investigated it. It rose to prominence extremely quickly, and it has drawn the attention of the clans and sects in the Veiled Region.”

Yang Ye asked, “How does the Sword Alliance compare to those powers in the Veiled Region?”

Yun Banqing fell silent for a short while and said, “If they have a Voider, then besides the Yuan Clan, no other power in the Veiled Region can resist them. But if they don’t have a Voider, then they would only be ordinary in the Veiled Region. Because practically every single power in the Veiled Region has a living fossil at the Voider Realm!”

The Voider Realm? Yang Ye fell silent. Indeed, the Sword Alliance’s strength wasn’t really sufficient to face such an expert now. However, he wasn’t afraid. If he was really fighting desperately with his life on the line, then he would bring his Rebirth Rank sword intent to the brink. He intended to see if a Voider could resist Rebirth Ranks word intent at the brink!

Meanwhile, Yun Banqing suddenly said, “Actually, the Sword Alliance’s actions were very unwise!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “What do you mean?”

Yun Banqing said, “According to the information sent back by the forces I sent, I noticed....”

“Wait!” Yang Ye suddenly interrupted her, “You have people in the Sword Alliance?”

She replied, “Of course. It’s not just the Yun Clan, all the other powers in the Veiled Region should have people in the Sword Alliance.”

Yang Ye frowned, “Why?”

She replied, “It’s a threat. The Sword Alliance is a threat to the Veiled Region. That’s why I said its actions were very unwise. Because they think that they are the number one power on the continent, but that’s actually not the case. They haven’t really seen the truly powerful sects and clans of the continent, but those powers know everything about the Sword Alliance.”

Yang Ye fell silent. He hadn’t expected the Veiled Region to exist on Dark Hell Continent, and those powers in the Veiled Region had already started acting against the Sword Alliance.

Yang Ye remained silent for some time before he asked, “Miss Yun, what did you use to do in the Yun Clan?”

She glanced at him and said, “Internal affair and managing its businesses....”

Yang Ye’s eyes lit up. Even though Ye Liuyun was very capable, it was really quite tiring for her to manage the entire city and Sword Alliance on her own. But if she had someone to help her.... Yes, Yun Banqing was an extremely suitable candidate! Of course, she was only suitable, and he would naturally not make her join right now. Moreover, she might not even agree!

He couldn’t act impatiently and had to observe her first!

Meanwhile, Yun Banqing suddenly walked over to Yun Tianming, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “May I?”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he understood what she meant. She intended to teach Yun Tianming a lesson. So, he immediately nodded, “Just don’t kill him!”

“Thank you!” As soon as she finished speaking, a dagger appeared in her grasp before she swiftly stabbed it between Yun Tianming’s legs while everyone else on the shuttle watched with astonishment.

AHH!!!!

A miserable and shrill cry that sounded like a pig being slaughtered resounded throughout the shuttle.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
