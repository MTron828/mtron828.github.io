Chapter 743 – Herculean Armor vs Divine Yin Flame!

“You can leave!” Right at this moment, Man Yuan suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye, and he stared fixedly at Yang Ye while both his hands were clenched tightly.

Yang Ye said to himself, What a pity!

Because he was very clearly aware that once Man Yuan had spoken these words, then Mu He and the others would definitely not follow him into war with the Man Clan. After all, they’d merely come here to undo the humiliation they’d suffered, and now that they had, they would naturally join him and fight with their lives on the line.

Sure enough, Mu He and the others stopped the members of Lunar Rite Hall once Man Yuan spoke these words.

Mu He glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye shrugged, and then he turned around and left. Right at this moment, Man Yuan suddenly said, “I’ll definitely make you pay tenfold for this humiliation!”

Yang Ye paid no attention to Man Yuan and quickly vanished from everyone’s fields of vision.

...

It didn’t take long for the news of Man Xi’s death at Yang Ye’s hands to spread through the city, and it shocked countless others. After all, the Man Clan was an ancient clan, and it wasn’t an organization created by the younger generation like Snow’s Lament was. But even then, it had still been attacked!

Now, countless were even more curious about Yang Ye’s identity.

On the other hand, many clans and powers which weren’t especially strong had hurriedly spread the order that their members were not to offend Yang Man!

Moreover, many could be said to have come to an understanding. They’d realized that the body refiner called Yang Man was a complete and utter madman, and misfortune would befall anyone who offended him!

...

Mu He took Mu Qingfeng somewhere that they could talk in private.

“Yang Man can’t be allowed to stay in your Lunar Rite Hall!” The first words Mu He spoke caused Mu Qingfeng to be stunned on the spot.

A short while passed before she asked in a low voice, “Why?”

Mu He replied, “He’s too unyielding and impulsive. Most importantly, he’s truly too murderous. He’ll definitely bring great disaster to Lunar Rite Hall if he’s allowed to stay. Just like what happened today. If he spared Man Xi after he defeated Man Xi today, then it wouldn’t have almost gone out of control. But he didn’t. Moreover, he even intended to slaughter the Man Clan....”

When he spoke up to this point, Mu He’s eyes narrowed slightly as he said, “I’ve figured him out. He’s an absolutely vengeful fellow. But a person who doesn’t know when to stop will definitely be unable to live for long in the Hallowed Grounds. So, little girl, make him leave Lunar Rite Hall. It’s for Lunar Rite Hall’s sake, and it’s for your sake as well!”

Mu Qingfeng fell silent because she wasn’t able to refute it at all. This incident had allowed her to truly sense how dangerous that fellow called Yang Man was.

Would he have really slaughtered the Man Clan if Man Yuan didn’t concede?He definitely would!

“What a headache!” Mu Qingfeng shook her head. Suddenly, she seemed to have thought of something and said, “Right, grandpa. Didn’t you say that even Half-Saints wouldn’t be able to break through the Herculean Armor? Why was he able to succeed just now? According to my observation, he doesn’t seem to be skilled in the sword.”

Mu He frowned for a short while before he spoke, “To be honest, I wasn’t able to figure it out as well. Because the moment he really did it was when all of us felt that he wouldn’t be able to succeed, so we didn’t observe carefully.... Haha! Now it would seem like he was feigning weakness in the beginning, and he was intentionally making everyone let down our guard. That fellow, Man Xi, was truly a fool!”

“He really was!” Mu Qingfeng nodded with strong agreement. If Man Xi hadn’t been so conceited and hadn’t underestimated his enemy, then it would have been impossible to kill him while he wore the Herculean Armor. Unfortunately, Man Xi was filled with conceit. It could be said that Man Xi had died to his own conceit.

“You decide what to do with Yang Man!” Mu He’s figure vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Should I let him stay? Or make him leave? Mu Qingfeng couldn’t avoid having a headache.

...

In a room within Lunar Rite Hall.

Yang Ye walked over to the bed. Fu Jinxian was seated on the bed. She’d changed into a set of clean clothes, and her injuries were in a much better state, but the scar on her face was still there. This made her exquisite and gorgeous appearance to become terrifying.

“Thank you for the 1,000 year old Firecrystal. But isn’t it a waste to be giving it to me!?” Fu Jinxian gazed at him as she spoke softly.

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “It was merely a possession. Right, that firecrystal should have been sufficient to heal the scar on your face, right? Why...?”

“Is it very unsightly?” A smile arose on the corners of Fu Jinxian’s mouth as she said, “I think that no man would be interested in me with my current appearance, right?”

Yang Ye glanced at her, and then he sighed, “Why go to such lengths!?”

She answered, “Do you know? Man Xi was one of the people who killed my husband and child. I’d thought the heavens had given me a chance to take revenge when I encountered him today, but I never expected that I would actually be that weak. I was weak to the point that I couldn’t kill my sworn enemy even when he stood there and let me attack. Moreover, I even dragged you into all of this. I... I really hate... I really hate my powerlessness! I hate myself! Cough....”

As she finished speaking, her agitated emotions caused strands of blood to flow out of the corner of her mouth.

Yang Ye withdrew a piece of cloth and passed it to her, “Man Xi is dead. I killed him myself.”

Fu Jinxian grew even more agitated. A long time passed before she finally calmed down. She took the cloth from Yang Ye, wiped off the blood on the corner of her mouth, and then gazed at him, “You know.... Everyone says that you’re a madman, a maniac, and an utter murderer. However, you’re actually a very nice person!”

“I’m a nice person?” Yang Ye shook his head as he chuckled, “Perhaps only you would say that I’m a nice person. Don’t forget that I annihilated your Fire Spirit Race.”

Fu Jinxian replied, “You’re very cruel and insane when you deal with your enemies, and you’ll reveal your darkest side when you face your enemies. Moreover, you’ll even endlessly magnify the darkness within you when you face your enemies. That’s why they call you a maniac and murderer. However, you’re very good to the people on your side. There’s no killing intent or viciousness coming from you when you face them, and you’re very amiable instead. Moreover....”

Fu Jinxian paused for a moment when she spoke up to this point and said, “I noticed that you’ve never offended anyone since you arrived at the Ancient City of Hallows, and you’ve even exercised forbearance on many occasions when others offended you. But once you stop exercising forbearance, then you’ll annihilate every single enemy of yours and leave no room for reconciliation. The world calls you a maniac, a madman, and a murderer. However, no one has ever wondered why you became like that!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Yang Ye glanced at her and didn’t want to continue on this topic, so he said, “What did the Patriarch of the Fire Spirit Race say when you went to see him?”

Fu Jinxian knew how to read the situation, and she didn’t continue on the precious topic. She said, “What else? He asked me not to cause trouble in the city because the Fire Spirit Race can’t even protect itself now, and it has no choice but to live in the city. So, he doesn’t want me to cause trouble for them. Haha! They actually intended to lock me up because of that!”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Don’t go back and just stay here at Lunar Rite Hall.”

When he spoke up to this point, Yang Ye hesitated for a moment before he withdrew another 1,000 year old Firecrystal and placed it by her bed. He said, “I might have been unable to escape the Fire Spirit Race’s territory that day if you hadn’t sent me a voice transmission. I won’t dissuade you from relying on strength to take revenge, but this is all I can help you with.”

“You’re still not ruthless enough!” Fu Jinxian gazed at him and said, “I would kill me if I were you. Because only my death would guarantee your absolute safety in the city. Conversely, you’ll definitely die if I’m allowed to live and expose your true identity!”

Yang Ye chuckled and said, “As I said before, I don’t offend those who don’t offend me. I have my own limits, and I absolutely won’t go over those limits. I have no reason to kill you, and my conscience wouldn’t allow me to do so for those reasons you just spoke of. Moreover, it doesn’t conform to my Sword Dao. Besides that, I might not die even if you expose me!” Yang Ye turned around and left once he finished speaking.

Fu Jinxian held the firecrystal in her grasp, and she gazed at the direction Yang Ye left towards for a long time before she finally withdrew her gaze.

At the instant she withdrew her gaze, the emotions in her eyes had instantly changed, and it became filled with ferocious, murderous, and vicious!

“I’ll get stronger no matter the cost!” A soft voice resounded through the room.

...

Yang Ye returned to his room after he left Fu Jinxian’s room, and the first thing he did was take Man Xi’s body out of the Primordial Pagoda. He wasn’t interested in corpses, of course. He was interested in the Herculean Armor that Man Xi wore.

He’d personally experienced its strength during the battle, and there were 2 reasons why he’d been able to pierce through Man Xi’s eyes. Firstly, Man Xi had underestimated him and let his guard down. Secondly, he’d instantly utilized his 11th level Sword Intent, the 3rd stage of Critical Strike, and the Mortal Sword!

He could be said to have truly utilized his full strength! But even then, he still felt a trace of obstruction from the armor. In other words, his full strength had still been almost unable to break through the Herculean Armor’s defenses. Actually, if Man Xi was slightly vigilant and had dodged earlier, then it would have been absolutely impossible for him to succeed!

In short, if he were to wear the Herculean Armor, then he would dare to use only his physical strength which was covered in dragon scales to fight Half-Saints in one-on-one battles!

Not to mention that he had the Mageforce Shield and the ice shield!

In short, he would be armed to the teeth from now one!

A smile couldn’t help but arise on the corners of his mouth when he thought about that.

However, he had a slight problem. The Herculean Armor was wrapped tightly around Man Xi, and there were no gaps at all. Most importantly, the hole he’d pierced through it had actually closed up. In other words, he couldn’t remove it at all!

Yang Ye remained silent on the spot for a long time, but it didn’t take long for him to have an idea.

His figure flashed into the Pavilion of Alchemy with Man Xi’s corpse in his hand.

“You’re so strong, so I’ll roast you a little. Let’s see if you or the Divine Yin Flame is stronger!”
