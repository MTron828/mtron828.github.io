Chapter 2685 – The Peak is Meaningless!

Yang Ye walked through the ruins on his own, and his current objective was to leave.

Meanwhile, in the Eternal Universe.

The battle was reaching its climax.

Countless corpses were sinking to the bottom of the Eternal River.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

But this time, both the desolate race and Eternal Kingdom didn’t dare to damage Eternal Border, and they were fighting within a barrier.

No one wanted to bring the woman in white here!

Since she didn’t want anything to happen to Eternal Border, they naturally didn’t dare to destroy it.

Moreover, it was obvious that they planned to fight to the death.

…

The Three Dimensional Universe’s 6th layer of space.

A stranger arrived in this layer of space, a woman with a ponytail.

It was An Nanjing!

During the months Yang Ye had been in the World of Past Life, she’d traveled from the 1st layer of space to the 6th.

She’d fought her way up here!

Now, her target was above the 9th layer of space.

An Nanjing sat cross-legged in space while a spear floated by her side, Dagger-Axe!

A string of blood was ceaselessly seeping out from the corner of her mouth.

A long time passed before a voice resounded from within the spear, “He is chosen. If he works hard, his strength will improve rapidly. So, if you don’t want him to leave you far behind, you must cultivate your Martial God Physique to its limits.’

“Its limits?” An Nanjing opened her eyes.

The voice resounded once more, “The extreme is… abandoning your physique! Rebirth amid destruction. The heavens gave you the best physique, but it may be a burden to you. It was once your greatest support, yet now, it is your bottleneck, it is your burden.”

An Nanjing fell silent.

The voice resounded once more, “Ascend to the 9th layer. If you succeed, I, Wu Mingshi, will teach you everything I know.”

An Nanjing suddenly asked, “Are you strong?”

The voice fell silent for a long time and spoke softly, “What do you think?”

She looked up, “I will head up there.”

The voice asked, “For him?”

She replied, “For him and the Martial Dao!”

The voice asked, “Choose one?”

She replied without the slightest hesitation, “Him!”

The voice was quite puzzled, “Why?”

“The peak is meaningless without him!” She closed her eyes once she finished speaking.

Suddenly, something unexpected happened. The space around her cracked open, and then countless pitch black threads surged at her like arrows.

An Nanjing stood up and waved Dagger-Axe.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

However, countless bloody holes appeared incessantly all over her body.

An Nanjing had fought her way up here, and she’d done so without resting at all.

An Nanjing’s aura grew increasingly weaker…

The Void World.

Sky Maiden was still devouring countless Void Planets without stopping.

One day, she suddenly stopped.

The space before her shook, and then an ethereal figure appeared there.

“How are they?” She asked.

She was naturally speaking about Yang Ye, Blood Maiden, and the others.

The ethereal figure replied indifferently, “They are fine. They have left to go somewhere else. As for him, Destiny has arranged for him to cultivate in the World of Past Life. If he can survive that place, he should become a completely different person.”

Sky Maiden nodded slightly, “Thank you!”

When Yang Ye had lost in battle against Zuo Mu that day, it was this ethereal figure who had made Zuo Mu refrain from pursuing Yang Ye.

Of course, Yang Ye wasn’t aware of it.

Meanwhile, Sky Maiden asked, “Why are you helping me?”

The ethereal figure fell silent for a short while and said, “We are the same type of person. Work hard on devouring this place. Destiny has shown herself, and that existence in the Four Dimensional Universe has shown itself. The future won’t be very peaceful.”

The ethereal figure was about to leave.

Suddenly, Sky Maiden asked, “Who are you?”

The ethereal figure shook its head, “One who lost to the Heaven Dao. Even I don’t remember my own name. So, it’s meaningless!”

The ethereal figure vanished once it finished speaking those words.

The Void World fell silent once more.

…

The 9th layer of space.

Two middle aged men arrived here. They were Zuo Mu and Heng Wangu.

Heng Wangu led Zuo Mu to the cliff, and they looked up at the slovenly man nailed to the cliff wall.

Heng Wangu spoke softly, “Senior First God, long time no see.”

“Heng Wangu!” First God smiled, “What? You finally dare to show yourself again?”

Heng Wangu held a folding fan in his grasp and knocked it lightly against his palm. He grinned and said, “I’m in quite a rush, so I won’t waste time, Senior First God. We can help you leave this place, but you must help us do three things. Alright?”

First God suddenly started roaring with laughter. He laughed for a long time before he shook his head, “Heng Wangu, have you surpassed that existence?”

Heng Wangu shook his head, “Of course not.”

First God instantly revealed a ferocious expression, “Then are you trying to play a joke on me?”

A wave of powerful pressure suddenly slammed down upon them!

At this moment, the entire 9th layer of space was shaking violently.

Heng Wangu’s face was calm. He took a step forward and pressed the folding fan lightly against his palm. In an instant, a wave of invisible energy appeared here.

Boom!

It seemed like something was torn into bits here.

But just a breath of time later, the world returned to calm once more.

First God spoke indifferently, “You’ve grown much stronger!”

Heng Wangu nodded slightly, “It’s insignificant. Let’s get back to business. If you agree, we can help you immediately. As for how, it’s our problem.”

First God gazed at Heng Wangu for a long time and smiled, “Of course. However, I’m very curious about how you’ll save me!”

Heng Wangu nodded and looked to the side, “Please!”

The space there shook slightly, and a man appeared.

Mo Yu!

Mo Yu flashed over to the cliff wall and gazed at the sword energy that had nailed First God to the cliff wall.

They felt familiar!

Mo Yu moved over and placed his hand on the sword energy. The sword energy didn’t reject him, and just a moment later, it shook before gradually dispersing.

At the same time, two strands of sword intent appeared before Mo Yu.

Sword intent!

It wasn’t the sword energy but the sword intent that were keeping First God here, they were Sword Dao True Mantra!

Mo Yu put them away and moved aside before looking at First God with slight vigilance in his eyes.

He’d heard of the man who was before him.

A legendary figure!

Unfortunately, First God had been too arrogant.

First God remained very calm and didn’t display any excitement or happiness from being released. He gazed at Mo Yu, “Why are you able to take them?”

Heng Wangu replied, “He’s a former successor of Destiny, the successor of the form of Destiny that imprisoned you here. So, it holds no hostility toward him.”

First God’s eyes narrowed slightly!

A successor of Destiny!

Mo Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he was ready to fight at any moment.

Suddenly, Heng Wangu said, “Senior, you’ve just regained your freedom and need to recuperate.”

It was a warning.

First God’s current strength was definitely inferior to his prime. After all, he’d been imprisoned for so many years.

First God moved his gaze away and said, “Don’t worry, I know how to differentiate between things. I won’t do something shameless like venting on the young because I’m incapable of fighting the old.”

Heng Wangu grinned, “You are wise, senior.”

First God gazed at Heng Wangu, “Go on! Tell me what I must do!”

Heng Wangu pondered deeply for a moment and said, “Help me kill someone.”

First God replied indifferently, “Alright!”

Heng Wangu chuckled, “Senior, make your way to the End World. There’ll be people there to help you recuperate and swiftly return to your prime!”

First God glanced at Heng Wangu, “Looks like my target isn’t that easy to kill!”

Heng Wangu nodded, “Indeed!”

First God didn’t say anything, he just glanced at the surroundings, and the desire to kill surged within his eyes.

Suddenly, Heng Wangu said, “We cannot destroy this place. If we do, I’m afraid it will draw the attention of some existences!”

First God closed his eyes slowly, “Destiny… I’ll definitely make all of you die graveless deaths!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished from the 9th layer of space.

Heng Wangu gazed at Zuo Mu, “Brother Zuo, let’s go see the next one!”

Mo Yu suddenly asked, “Do you need me?”

Heng Wangu shook his head, “No. You can go, Brother Mo.”

Mo Yu nodded and vanished on the spot.

Once Mo Yu left, Zuo Mu said, “He has a hidden agenda.”

Heng Wangu smiled, “He has great ambition.”

He seemed to have thought of something at this point and asked, “If you compare him and Yang Ye, who do you think is more outstanding?”

Zuo Mu answered without the slightest hesitation, “Yang Ye!”

Heng Wangu smiled, “Why?”

Zuo Mu replied indifferently, “He’s a truly loyal person who differentiates clearly between right and wrong. Men should be like that.”

Heng Wangu chuckled, “Indeed. Unfortunately, he must die, and the Sprite Progenitor must be ours to make into the formation’s core… If we weren’t enemies…”

He shook his head and smiled, “He has no other choice, and we actually have no other choice as well. Alright, let’s stop thinking about these unnecessary things and go see the next person. That person’s temper isn’t very good.”

They left side by side once he finished speaking.

A long time passed before Zuo Mu asked abruptly, “What do you plan to do once we’re done here?”

Heng Wangu grinned, “If I survive, I naturally plan to have a look at the Four Dimensional Universe.”

“I’ll go with you, Brother Wan!”
