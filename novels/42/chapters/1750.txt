Chapter 1751 - The 6th Stage Of The True Realm!

No one had expected Yang Lin and the others to suddenly side with Yang Lianshuang.

Even Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang hadn’t expected it!

Actually, it made sense.

Yang Lin and the others had heard Yang Xiang. Yang Xiang didn’t care about the Yang Clan at all, and he only cared about himself. So, if they still sided with Yang Xiang, it was obvious that the Yang Clan would be finished.

As for Yang Lianshuang, even though she was female, her heart was with the clan, and she had the potential and strength to manage the Yang Clan.

Coupled with the fact that Yang Xiao was dead, they’d decisively chosen to side with her.

Yang Lianshuang glanced at them and said, “Very good.” She gazed at the experts of the Ying Clan and Ku Clan, “This is an internal affair of the Yang Clan, so if you still intend to interfere, then I guarantee that all of you will vanish from the face of this world!”

“Of course we won’t!” A smile curled up on the corners of Ying Wu’s mouth, “Deal with your clan’s affairs on your own.” As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and intended to leave with the others. Suddenly, he seemed to have thought of something, and he gazed at Yang Ye, “My Ying Clan’s members never die for nothing!”

Yang Ye glanced at Ying Wu and said, “If I still see you after three breaths of time pass, then I guarantee that you’ll lose your head!”

Ying Wu’s face became quite unsightly, and he glanced at the Sword Chest in front of Yang Ye. In the end, both he and the other experts of the Ying Clan turned around and vanished into the sky.

Once the experts of the Ying Clan left, the experts of the Ku Clan didn’t stay a moment longer. They turned around and left too.

As far as they were concerned, leaving and watching the Yang Clan fight amongst itself was the best choice!

Meanwhile, Yang Xiang glanced at Yang Lin’s group, and then he shook his head, “Since all of you want to die, then I’ll fulfil your wish!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stretched out his right hand, and the space around Yang Lianshuang and the others shook violently. A moment later, the space around them seemed like it was being compressed, and it was being compressed bit by bit towards them.

Yang Lianshuang’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then she waved her right hand, “Everyone besides Yang Ye move back!”

Yang Lin and the others were useless against an expert like Yang Xiang.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Can’t I move back too?”

She glanced at him, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “I really want to, but I wouldn’t be a good ally if I did that now.”

She asked, “Is the Merak System fine?”

Yang Ye fell silent. When he just arrived at the Milky Way System, he’d sent two Sword Servants back to protect Merak System. Yet now, both of them were still there. That meant that Merak System was fine.

That was the main reason why he wasn’t anxious to return anymore!

Because if someone had attacked Merak System, he would definitely find out immediately. He didn’t know why those experts Yang Xiao sent hadn’t attacked, but he knew that Merak System was safe for now.

As for why he stayed behind to help Yang Lianshuang, besides the agreement they had, he had another reason, and it was that he didn’t want the Yang Clan to fall into an outsider’s hands. Because if Yang Lianshuang wasn’t the one in-charge of the Yang Clan, it was very likely that the Yang Clan would continue looking for trouble with him.

Unless he annihilated the Yang Clan!

He was naturally unable to annihilate the entire Yang Clan on his own. So, the best solution was to let Yang Lianshuang become the Yang Clan’s patriarch. Once she became the patriarch, the Yang Clan wouldn’t be a problem for him anymore.

Moreover, if Yang Lianshuang was the patriarch, it would definitely be beneficial to him. It represented that he would have an ally in the medium universe of the Milky Way System!

A single person’s strength was limited. If he was all alone, then not to mention the Yang Clan, he wouldn’t be afraid even if he had to go against all eight clans. After all, he could flee if he was no match for them. But he had ties in the world and people to protect!

So, he needed allies!

Yang Lianshuang was someone with principle, so she was suitable to be an ally!

Simply speaking, their alliance was a win-win for both of them!

Yang Lianshuang nodded slightly when she heard Yang Ye, “The strength of a 6th stage True Realm expert is unfathomable. What you saw earlier was just the tip of the iceberg. So, don’t be careless.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Of course!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his left wrist moved slightly, and the wooden sword appeared in his grasp. After that, he started walking slowly in Yang Xiang’s direction.

As for Yang Lianshuang, she started walking in Yang Xiang’s direction too. At the same time, the black claw on her neck started wriggling and seemed to be about to emerge from within.

Yang Xiang glanced at Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang, and then he chuckled, “Interesting. Two ants are actually dreaming of shaking a mountain.”

He took a step forward once he finished speaking, and then the space in an area of over 10km started to tremble violently. At the same time, Yang Xiang stretched out his right hand and slowly pressed it downwards in Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang’s direction.

In an instant, the space around them rippled in waves, and numerous waves of powerful aura instantly enveloped them. At this moment, they felt like they were on the verge of suffocating!

Yang Ye revealed a solemn expression on his face. This is the strength of a 6th stage True Realm expert!Just his aura is enough to make me feel slightly suffocated!

Amidst the rippling space, Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang exchanged glances, and then Yang Ye stomped his right foot down and relied on the counterforce to transform into a ray of light which shot at Yang Xiang. Everywhere he passed, the warped expanse of space before him was torn open, and he instantly arrived in front of Yang Xiang.

Split Second!

It was extremely swift, but it wasn’t that swift to Yang Xiang. So, at the instant Yang Ye had vanished, Yang Xiang had stretched out his hand, and then two fingers clamped down on Yang Ye’s wooden sword!

Yang Xiang gazed at Yang Ye and spoke indifferently, “Your speed isn’t bad. Unfortunately, that’s all it is!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he squeezed down with the intention of shattering Yang Ye’s wooden sword, but he was astounded to notice that he was merely able to make it tremble, yet it showed no signs of being damaged!

Suddenly, Yang Ye twisted the sword.

Bang!

A wave of powerful force surged out from the wooden sword, causing Yang Xiang to be blasted backwards. However, he stopped himself after moving less than 30m back.

Suddenly, a pitch black claw appeared before him.

Yang Xiang’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he slammed his fist forward.

Bang!

An explosion resounded once more. The black claw vanished, and Yang Xiang was pushed around 30m back again!

Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang didn’t launch another attack, and their eyes were filled with solemn expressions.

Actually, they hadn’t held back at all just now. However, Yang Xiang had stopped their attacks with such ease.

Yang Xiang’s strength was much stronger than they’d imagined!

Meanwhile, Yang Xiang suddenly said, “I’m truly surprised. Your strengths are actually at such a level. No wonder that piece of trash, Yang Xiao, couldn’t deal with the two of you. Needless to say, you’re both monstrous geniuses. If you grow further, even I…”

Yang Xiang stopped abruptly at this point because Yang Ye had suddenly appeared in front of him, and then a sword arrived before his forehead. However, it only took a moment for two fingers to clamp down on the sword!

They were Yang Xiang’s fingers of course! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Yang Xiang gazed at Yang Ye, “This move is…”

Yang Ye didn’t give him the time to finish. Six swords suddenly flashed out from the Sword Chest behind Yang Ye. In an instant, the swords stabbed at Yang Xiang from six different directions, and they were similarly swift to the absolute limit!

Suddenly, Yang Xiang twisted his left hand.

Bang!

A terrifying aura swept out from him. In an instant, the swords around him were blasted away, and Yang Ye was similarly blasted over 300m away.

As soon as Yang Ye’s figure was pushed back, Yang Xiang intended to attack, but a pillar of black light suddenly appeared before him, and then an ear piercing cry of a phoenix resounded from the black pillar of light.

Yang Xiang frowned when he heard the phoenix cry. Because it made him feel dazed for a moment, and that moment allowed a black claw to strike his chest.

Bang!

Yang Xiang’s figure instantly appeared 300m away. As soon as he stopped there, a sword arrived just half an inch away from his nape. As far as others were concerned, it looked like Yang Xiang had moved backwards and used his nape to hit the sword!

However, right when Yang Ye’s sword was about to pierce his nape, Yang Xiang vanished on the spot. Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly, and he immediately issued a command and made the six swords stab towards the area behind him!

It was because a palm had suddenly slapped down towards his head!

Bang!

The space in the surroundings shook violently amidst an explosion. An instant later, a ray of light flashed and Yang Ye appeared over 1km away!

As soon as he stopped there, a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth.

Suppression of both cultivation and strength!

Yang Xiang’s strength was much stronger than Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang. Because up until this point in the battle, Yang Xiang was still calm and composed, and he hadn’t suffered any injuries.

Suddenly, Yang Xiang said, “Both of you have truly surprised me. One is at the Zenith Realm and the other is at the True Realm, but your strengths are actually at such a level. I was far inferior to you at your age. Yet now, both of you are really weak like ants to me. The 6th stage of the True Realm, World Modification. Both of you don’t understand what those words mean, and you won’t get the opportunity to!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot.

In an instant, numerous Yang Xiang’s filled an area of over 1km around Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang!
