Chapter 1630 - The Fourth Level!

Translator: InVader

Yang Danqing spoke in a low voice, “Wang Yan, what are you trying to say?”

“What am I trying to say?” Wang Yan’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Yang Danqing, that older brother of yours came to my Wang Clan’s territory, stole the Earth Spirit that my Wang Clan was nurturing, and even said that I should come to the Yang Clan to look for him if I can. Now, I’m here. Yet you’re trying to ask me what I’m doing here?”

Yang Danqing spoke in a low voice, “Wang Yan, someone is framing me and my brother. Don’t let yourself be used by them!”

“Used?” Wang Yan laughed coldly, “What? Both of you dare to do it yet dare not admit it? Cut the crap! Tell Yang Yan to get out here! I’ve always wanted to experience the strength of the young masters of your Yang Clan, so allow me to get my wish today. Alright?”

Yang Danqing replied, “Wang Yan, don’t you think there’s something strange about this? If we really wanted to take your Earth Spirit, why would we tell you that we did it? Moreover, the fight for succession is about to begin, so why would my brother go make enemies for no reason?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Only your brother knows the answer to that!” Wang Yan spoke fiercely, “Yang Danqing, your second brother didn’t just steal my Wang Clan’s Earth Spirit, he even killed numerous Zenith Realm experts of ours. Trust me, not to mention a young master of the Yang Clan, even if your second brother was the Yang Clan’s successor, my Wang Clan would still intend to get even with him!”

Yang Danqing was livid, “Wang Yan, we aren’t afraid of you. Someone is really framing my brother and I. Give me some time, and I’ll catch that person myself. I believe that you don’t want to be used as well, right?”

“Alright!” Wang Yan continued, “I’ll give you time. However, allow me to be frank in advance. If you don’t give me an explanation, then… Hmph! I had no intention to interfere in the Yang Clan’s competition for the position of successor. However, don’t blame me for what I do if you don’t give me an explanation.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and vanished into the sky.

Yang Danqing’s face was terrifyingly gloomy. After all, it was the first time in her life that she’d felt so aggrieved!

She remained silent on the spot for a short while, and then she spoke coldly, “Give my order for Yang Shan and Yang Shi to make a trip to the Wu Clan… No, I’ll go with them. Let me see who dares to entrap us like this!”

…

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Time flowed swiftly while cultivating. Over five months had passed since Yang Ye entered the cycle of reincarnation. Of course, merely half a month had passed in the outside world.

During this period, Yang Ye seemed like he'd been transformed into stone. His outer appearance hadn’t changed at all, and his aura had even vanished. He seemed like he didn’t exist here.

Xiao Yuxi, Zi’er, and Snowy were standing not too far away from Yang Ye.

After they found out he was going to charge into the Rebirth Realm, they had started to guard him. It would be a lie to say that they weren’t worried. After all, the slightest mistake might cause Yang Ye to never awaken again.

Snowy pointed at Yang Ye while resting in Zi’er’s arms, and then she looked up at Zi’er while a questioning gaze filled her eyes.

Zi’er rubbed Snowy’s head gently and spoke softly, “Don’t worry, he’ll wake up soon.”

Snowy nodded, and then she started to wave her claws about. It seemed like she was saying something.

Zi’er shook her head slightly, “We can’t disturb him for now. You can make him play with you after he wakes up, alright?”

Snowy blinked. She was about to wave her claws again when she suddenly turned to look at Yang Ye. She wasn’t the only one. At this moment, Zi’er and Xiao Yuxi had turned to look at Yang Ye as well.

Yang Ye’s eyelids trembled slightly under their gazes, and then they gradually opened. There was a trace of age in the calm gaze within Yang Ye’s eyes.

Swish!

Snowy immediately transformed into a ray of white light that shot over to Yang Ye, and then she wrapped her claws tightly around Yang Ye’s neck while ceaselessly rubbing her head against his chin.

Yang Ye looked down at Snowy, and his eyes were extremely calm. However, it didn’t take long for ripples to appear in the calmness of his eyes, and then his gaze gradually became gentle.

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head gently, and then he gazed at Xiao Yuxi and Zi’er and grinned, “It’s good to be back!”

They walked over to Yang Ye. Xiao Yuxi grabbed Yang Ye’s hand and spoke softly, “All that matters is that you’re conscious again!”

Yang Ye hugged both Xiao Yuxi and Zi’er, and then he spoke softly, “It’s very good!”

During this period, he’d experienced too much in the cycle of reincarnation. Even if he had the Enlightened Sword Heart and constantly stayed true to his heart, his mental state had still undergone many changes.

This time, he’d really experienced the passage of time and life!

Xiao Yuxi asked softly, “Are you at the Rebirth Realm?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I am.”

Actually, there wasn’t a huge difference between the Rebirth Realm and Dualism Realm. The only difference was that one’s mental state had undergone a transformation upon attaining the Rebirth Realm. Besides that, one had another new form of energy, Rebirth Energy!

The Dualism Realm had the energy of Yin and Yang, and the Rebirth Realm had Rebirth Energy!

However, Rebirth Energy wasn’t very useful to Yang Ye, just like the energy of Yin and Yang. Because his slaughter intent and sword intent had surpassed Rebirth Energy. That was why he rarely utilized the Energy of Yin and Yang upon attaining the Dualism Realm, and it was also why he could surmount his realm of cultivation to do battle.

Of course, once he attained the Rebirth Realm, his overall strength had improved tremendously. It could be said that even if he didn’t use his sword, he could fight Zenith Realm experts, and once he did use his sword, then he was confident in his ability to kill Zenith Realm experts even without using the Laws of Darkness!

If he launched a surprise attack and took his opponent by surprise, then ordinary Zenith Realm experts would probably be unable to react before their heads were separated from their bodies.

Confidence!

After he attained the Rebirth Realm, Yang Ye was filled with unprecedented confidence. Of course, he wouldn’t allow himself to become conceited. After all, he was in Milky Way System, and it was filled with countless monstrous geniuses. Experts who could surmount their realms of cultivation to do battle could be found throughout Milky Way System, so conceit would be no different than signing his own death wish!

Not to mention anyone else, just the two Blood Puppets in his possession were existences that he wasn’t confident in his ability to defeat, even in a one on one battle. Or it should be said that he only had a 30% chance to win against any one of them!

However, he did have the ability to fight them!

Yang Ye didn’t leave the Primordial Pagoda immediately. He stayed with Xiao Yuxi and the others and spent time with them for two days. Even though cultivating and becoming strong was important, his family was even more important. He didn’t want himself to overlook his family because of other things!

On the third day, Yang Ye went to the 2nd level.

Yang Ye stood silently by Xiao Qi’s bedside.

Xiao Qi might have been able to regain consciousness with Little Sky’s help. Yet now, Little Sky had been captured…

Suddenly, Xiao Qi’s finger trembled slightly.

Yang Ye was stunned by the sight of this, and then he was overjoyed. He quickly grabbed her hand and spoke softly, “Xiao Qi? Xiao Qi?”

However, he received no response.

Yang Ye called out to her a few more times. However, she still didn’t respond, and it made the smile on Yang Ye’s face vanish slowly.

Around an hour later, Xiao Qi still didn’t show any further signs of movement or waking up!

Yang Ye remained silent on the spot for a long time, and then he said, “Xiao Qi, I don’t know if you can hear me. I want to tell you that we’re at Milky Way System. I’ll be waiting for you, waiting for you to wake up!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and walked to the pill furnace.

A flame was still burning within it, and it was the Divine Yin Flame.

Disappointment flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes as he gazed at it because it still hadn’t regained consciousness.

Yang Ye shook his head and turned around.

He was just about to walk out of the room when a voice suddenly resounded, “We’re in Milky Way System?”

Yang Ye immediately stopped when he heard the voice, and then he turned around and gazed at the pill furnace, “You’re awake?”

It was the Divine Yin Flame’s voice!

The Divine Yin Flame replied, “I just woke up a while ago!”

Yang Ye said, “I’m sorry!” He was the reason why it had been in deep sleep, so he’d felt guilty about it.

The Divine Yin Flame said, “There’s no need for that. If it wasn’t for you, I would probably still be in deep sleep. Or to be more precise, I have to thank you.”

Yang Ye asked, “You were in deep sleep?”

“Yes.” The Divine Yin Flame continued, “Actually, I was sealed. Even though I’m still sealed right now, it’s different now. In the past, even my consciousness was sealed. But after you gained access to this level, it indirectly unsealed my consciousness.”

So that’s what it meant! Yang Ye nodded and said, “No matter what, thank you for helping me that day. Right, how do I release you from here?”

The Divine Yin Flame replied, “You still can’t!”

“Why?” Yang Ye was puzzled, “Am I not the master of this pagoda?”

“Not yet!” The Divine Yin Flame continued, “You’re too weak, so you can’t truly take control of it. Once you’ve done that, you’ll be able to release me.”

I’m still too weak… Yang Ye had quite a weird expression on his face.

Meanwhile, the Divine Yin Flame added, “Actually, you’re not very weak. You’re on the verge of coming into contact with the realm of the ‘Dao’.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “The Dao? What do you mean?”

The Divine Yin Flame replied, “You’ll find out soon.”

Yang Ye nodded, and he didn’t pursue an answer. He seemed to have thought about something else instead and asked, “Right, when can I access the next level?”

He’d wanted to access the 4th level for a long time.

However, there had been no sign of it becoming accessible to him, and it made him feel quite depressed. After all, he benefited tremendously from every single level of the pagoda. Moreover, he wanted to know what was in there.

The Divine Yin Flame replied, “The next level?”

Yang Ye answered, “Yes!”

“You can access it right now!” The Divine Yin Flame continued, “Don’t you know that?”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
