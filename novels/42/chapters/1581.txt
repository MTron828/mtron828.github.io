Chapter 1582 - Come!

Translator: InVader

Outer space.

They were outside the atmospheric layer of Sky Sky Continent. However, in order to avoid affecting Sky Sky Continent, Fan Yinyu and the others had created a spatial battleground there.

In the spatial battleground.

Fan Yinyu held the feather fan in her hand, and a huge golden dragon was beneath her feet. Meanwhile, besides the man with a spear on his back, the one-armed man, and the one-armed woman, there were three other black robed figures by her side.

Fan Yinyu’s eyes were closed as she stood on the huge dragon, “After so many years, everything can finally come to an end today.”

Suddenly, she opened her eyes and looked down. A ray of light from a sword and a ray of golden light suddenly arrived here, and then they dispersed to reveal Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s figures.

“What are you doing here?” Blood Maiden frowned slightly. If she were to be honest, Yang Ye wasn’t weak, and he could be of help to them. However, she didn’t want Yang Ye to get mixed up in this. It was a battle of life and death, and Yang Ye was still too young. It was very dangerous for him. Moreover, based on Yang Ye’s natural talent, he only needed some time. He needed ten years at most, and no one here would be a match for him.

Yang Ye shook his head, “I can’t just let Shaoyao’s death go unavenged!”

There was one other reason why he’d come here, and it was Ding Shaoyao. He couldn’t let her die for him without doing anything about it!

Blood Maiden glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Be careful!”

Yang Ye nodded. He naturally had to be careful. It could be said that no one here was weaker than him, or it should be said that An Nanjing and him were the weakest here.

Yang Ye glanced at the people here and said, “Let me start the battle!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the Sword God’s Seal immediately started glowing brightly on his forehead, and then his sword intent instantly rose to the Returnal Rank. After that, Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the Stellar Sword Diagram appeared before him, causing the surroundings to instantly be filled with stars.

What was his strongest trump card?

The Stellar Sword Diagram and Sword of Rebirth. But when both were compared, the Stellar Sword Diagram was superior.

Yang Ye’s objective was very simple, and it was to exhaust their strength. He may not be a match for any one of them in a one on one battle, but he could exhaust their strength.

However, his intentions were great, but reality was cruel.

Right when Yang Ye was about to summon stellar sword energy, Fan Yinyu suddenly waved her fan lightly. Just that caused the scene around them to return to normal.

Yang Ye was stunned because he couldn’t sense the stars in outer space anymore.

Yang Ye gazed at Blood Maiden, and the latter spoke solemnly, “She has sealed off the area.”

She sealed off the area? Yang Ye’s face twitched slightly. You can do that? The stars in outer space can be sealed away?

Meanwhile, Fan Yinyu suddenly gazed at the one-armed woman, “Since you’re both sword cultivators, I’ll leave him to you.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The one-armed woman nodded slightly, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “You can die this time.”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Fan Yinyu suddenly waved her hand again. The scene around him changed. In just a moment, only Yang Ye and the one-armed woman remained here.

Yang Ye was visibly moved because both the one-armed woman and him had been instantly moved to a different spatial battlefield! But he hadn’t even been able to resist. No, he’d been moved before he could even react.

What terrifying strength!Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and looked at the woman who stood not too far ahead of him. She was the woman who’d created the Sword of Rebirth, so he naturally didn’t dare to act carelessly at all.

She started walking slowly towards Yang Ye, “After so many years, it’s finally coming to an end today.”

As soon as she finished speaking, her figure vanished on the spot.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly drew his sword and swung it.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the space here shook violently. After that, a terrifying wave of energy surged madly towards the surroundings. Everywhere it passed, space seemed to shake like an earthquake was surging through it, and it was extremely shocking.

In an instant, countless rays of sword energy suddenly crisscrossed through the spatial battlefield, and then the wave of energy was instantly sliced into bits.

Clang!

An ear piercing sound of collision resounded, and then two rays of light shot backwards.

It didn’t take long for the light to disperse and reveal Yang Ye and the one-armed woman’s figures.

At this moment, Yang Ye was in quite a miserable state. There were over a dozen injuries throughout his body. They were extremely deep, and it was especially so for the injury on his chest. That injury was so deep that it seemed like Yang Ye’s chest had been cut open. If one grabbed it and pulled in opposite directions, one would definitely be able to gain an unobstructed view of Yang Ye’s internal organs!

The one-armed woman was in a much better state. At the very least, that was how it seemed from the outside. There were very few injuries on her, and there were only two on her shoulder.

Besides being inferior to her in every aspect, there was one other reason why he was in a much more terrible state than her, and it was because he’d fought with absolute disregard for his life. Such a method of fighting had a disadvantage, and it was that if his opponent could pierce his defenses, then it would be very easy for him to suffer injuries.

Just like this very moment. While his physical defenses were formidable, she was able to pierce through those defenses.

This period of fighting the woman allowed Yang Ye to realize that her attainments in both speed and the Sword Dao were much superior to his own.

Yang Ye fell silent for an instant, and then he activated the Demon God’s inner core within him. It didn’t take long for the Energy of the Demon God to surge through him, and then a strand of mysterious energy seeped out from him. At the same time, the Primordial Violet Energy within him had almost fully healed his injuries.

The one-armed woman walked in Yang Ye’s direction, “You don’t possess a special physique, but your recovery is even greater than owners of special physiques. Come, let me see if your recovery or my sword is faster!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she suddenly waved her sword at Yang Ye from afar. In an instant, a huge sword lotus appeared out of thin air above Yang Ye. Yang Ye’s expression immediately changed because he’d experienced this move in the past, so he immediately withdrew the casket lid.

Bang!

Meanwhile, the sword lotus exploded above him. Countless rays of sword energy instantly rained down like a storm and enveloped Yang Ye.

Boom!

Suddenly, a strand of sword intent and a blood red ray of light erupted from the center of the storm. The rain of sword energy was instantly blasted towards the surroundings. Meanwhile, the one-armed woman was in front of Yang Ye, and her sword was stabbing towards his throat!

Even though Yang Ye’s body was enhanced by the Demon God’s energy, he didn’t dare to let the woman’s sword strike his throat. He immediately moved slightly to the side with the intention of dodging her attack. However, her sword suddenly changed to a horizontal swipe, and it swept towards his throat once more. Moreover, it was much faster than before!

How fast was it?

It was so fast that Yang Ye was only able to barely sense its trajectory!

Yang Ye’s upper body shot backwards out of reflex, and it seemed like his body had been snapped into two as he bent backwards. Meanwhile, the sword suddenly stopped. A moment later, it shot downwards like an axe that was chopping down on a block of wood.

Yang Ye flipped his palm and raised his sword in front of him.

Clang!

As soon as their swords collided, an ear piercing explosion resounded. A moment later, Yang Ye was blasted downwards to the ground. However, the one-armed woman’s sword was still pressed firmly against Yang Ye’s sword. At this moment, there was no more than around a dozen centimeters between Yang Ye and her!

Suddenly, slaughter intent and sword intent surged out from within Yang Ye, and then they swiftly condensed before exploding apart!

Dual intents brought to the brink!

Boom!

The explosion created from it blasted the woman back. However, she’d swiftly swung her sword at Yang Ye as her body flew back. Because they were too close and coupled with the fact that Yang Ye hadn’t expected her to be able to do that at such a moment, the sword energy was able to strike Yang Ye and blast him over 3km away.

As soon as Yang Ye’s figure stopped after being blasted 3km away, the one-armed woman appeared in front of him once more, and then her sword stabbed down towards his throat.

Every single one of her attacks was lethal!

Her attacks were very cunning and ruthless. Moreover, her sword energy was extremely sharp. Even Yang Ye didn’t dare allow them to strike directly against his body! He didn’t dare to allow it even when his body was enhanced by the Demon God’s energy right now!

Yang Ye didn’t have the time to pay any attention to his injuries, and he just immediately raised his sword and swung it.

Bang!

As soon as he swung his sword, Yang Ye was pushed almost 1km away from the impact. The one-armed woman was pushed back as well, but she’d stopped after being pushed just 300m back. After that, she immediately swung her sword Yang Ye from afar.

A strand of sword energy tore through the air. It was extremely quick and practically instantly arrived before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye flipped his palm, and the casket lid appeared in front of him.

Bang!

Yang Ye and the casket lid were pushed over 300m back.

As soon as Yang Ye stopped himself, he shot a glance at his own body. At this moment, he was covered in injuries. If it wasn’t for the Primordial Violet Energy within him, he would have been dead a long time ago.

Meanwhile, the woman suddenly said, “Don’t you know how to use the Sword of Rebirth?”

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she continued, “Come! Let’s decide life and death with a single attack.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she closed her eyes slowly.

Yang Ye fell silent for an instant, and then he gradually closed his eyes as well.

A moment of silence ensued. Suddenly, two sword howls resounded simultaneously, and then both of them vanished on the spot.

At the same time, the spatial battlefield collapsed.
