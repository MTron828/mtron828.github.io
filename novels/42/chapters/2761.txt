Chapter 2762 – I Look Down at the Clouds!

The two white figures were Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu!

They were people from different eras, but they had become friends now.

They got along very well!

Qi Bitian looked up into the distance when she heard Tian Xiu, and she saw some mysterious speck of light in the distant starry sky.

Qi Bitian spoke abruptly, “I don’t think so!”

Tian Xiu gazed at her, and she explained softly, “The Four Dimensional Universe is much farther than we imagined. See those specks of light? Those specks of light should be their outposts, and the space behind them is the real Four Dimensional Universe.”

Tian Xiu nodded slightly, “That’s fine. We’ll just fight them.”

Qi Bitian smiled, “Yes, we’ll just fight them.”

She seemed to have thought of something at this point and shot a glance behind her, “I wonder how that kid is right now!”

Tian Xiu looked into the distance, and a long time passed before she spoke softly, “He isn’t someone to give up. Trust him. He will catch up, so let’s go!”

Suddenly, a white shadow appeared not too far away.

Qi Bitian’s eyes narrowed slightly while strong hostility could be seen in her eyes.

It was the form of Destiny in a white dress.

The woman in white stopped, glanced at them, and said, “Advance soon. Our strongest form is targeting him, so his life is in danger.”

She vanished into the distance once she finished speaking.

Tian Xiu asked, “Shall we kill her?”

Qi Bitian shook her head, “She isn’t like the other forms of Destiny…”

She looked in the direction of the Three Dimensional Universe and frowned slightly, “What did that kid do now? Even the strongest form of Destiny is targeting him?”

Tian Xiu shook her head, “He has always been very good at causing trouble!”

Qi Bitian asked, “Should we head back?”

Tian Xiu asked, “If we join forces, can we defeat the strongest form of Destiny?”

Qi Bitian thought for a moment and shook her head, “I don’t think so.”

Tian Xiu replied softly, “Then let’s advance first because fighting her to the death!”

Qi Bitian chuckled, “Alright, let’s fight her to the death. I’ve been suppressed by her for thousands of years. This time, either she or I will die! Haha!”

They vanished into the distance once Qi Bitian finished speaking.

Around two hours later, they suddenly stopped because there was a battle ahead.

It was a woman with a saber!

Yang Busi!

As for the one in battle with her, it was a woman with a wine gourd! It was Tu!

“Destiny!” Qi Bitian spoke indifferently, “Another one!”

Tian Xiu clenched her hands slowly. Suddenly, a terrifying aura swept over from afar, and then numerous giants appeared there.

There were over 20 of them, and every one of them wore violet gold armor and held a huge axe.

They were like war gods as they stood there, and their monstrous auras caused the entire starry sky to tremble.

However, they were led by a man!

A human man!

Behind the man was also a huge demon that was shaped like a lion. Its eyes were dark red like lanterns, and its limbs were like towering pillars that could hold up the sky!

The human man wore an ink black robe and a helmet which looked like cow horns. He had a spear in his grasp, and the spear was a little longer than an ordinary spear. The tip of it was broken slightly as if some kind of sharp weapon had cut it off.

Along with their arrival, Tu and Yang Busi stopped fighting, and they gazed indifferently at the man.

The man stopped, glanced at them, and then his gaze fell on Tu. In an instant, his face became icy cold, “Destiny!”

Tu cracked a smile, “I didn’t expect the titans to have a human on their side. Looks like you’ve sided with them!”

The man spoke coldly, “Kill!”

As soon as he gave the order, the demon behind him leaped up and pounced at Destiny.

Destiny laughed coldly, and then she leaped up and kicked at it.

Bam!

An explosion resounded, and the demon was blasted backward repeatedly. Meanwhile, a spear suddenly arrived before Tu. Tu had obviously expected it because she pressed her palms together and clamped down on the spear. After that, she pushed forward and kicked.

At the moment she kicked, the owner of the spear, the man, kicked as well.

Bam!

They immediately split apart and returned to where they’d been a moment ago!𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Tu glanced at the man and laughed coldly, “You have some skill.”

The man glanced at Qi Bitian and the others, “All of you are experts of the Three Dimensional Universe, so why are you with Destiny?”

Yang Busi frowned slightly, “What the fuck is wrong with you? Do I look like I’m with her?”

The man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Do you want to die?”

Yang Busi gestured provocatively at him, “Why don’t you try?”

The man vanished on the spot. Meanwhile, Yang Busi suddenly spun on the spot, and then a powerful aura swept out from her. At the same time, a fist slammed at the man.

Bang!

Space shook violently, and the figure was blasted back to where it came from!

Meanwhile, Yang Busi had similarly been pushed around 300m back!

The man gazed at Yang Busi, and a wisp of solemness appeared in his eyes.

She was very strong!

And it made him wonder who these people were!

The man glanced at them. In the end, he didn’t choose to cause trouble and said, “Let’s go!”

Once he said that, he led the giants and the demon forward with the intention of going around them, but Yang Busi suddenly asked, “Where are you going?”

The man laughed coldly, “What? You want to stop me? You may not be able to!”

Meanwhile, Tu grinned, “She asked you where you’re going!”

Her smile was quite evil.

The man replied indifferently, “The Three Dimensional Universe, of course!”

Yang Busi’s face instantly turned gloomy.

“Oooh!” Meanwhile, Tu glanced at Tian Xiu and Qi Bitian, “You may not be aware that Yang Ye is the founder of the new order in the Three Dimensional Universe. He has gathered all the Destiny Realm experts of the Three Dimensional Universe and is preparing to fight both the End World and the Four Dimensional Universe. However, his strength may be a little weak. If these fellows are allowed to go down there, he may be killed!”

Qi Bitian replied indifferently, “Are you joking?”

Yang Busi suddenly said, “She isn’t joking.”

Qi Bitian gazed at Yang Busi, and the latter said, “He’s part of my Yang Clan, and I just came up from down there…”

She gazed at Tu, “I’ll kill you next time!”

Tu gulped down a mouthful of wine and chuckled, “Anytime!”

Yang Busi ignored her and gazed at the man, “Let’s fight!”

She immediately charged at him once she finished speaking.

The man was about to attack when two auras suddenly enveloped him. His expression changed as he gazed at Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu. He was about to speak when Tian Xiu suddenly said, “Go back to where you came from!”

The man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he flicked a pitch black command token into the air. A moment later, it vanished into the starry sky.

“He has called for backup!” Meanwhile, Tu drank her wine as she spoke, “Out of consideration for my 3rd and 4th form, I’ll give you a friendly reminder. You better hurry up if you want to attack. Otherwise, you may not be a match for their forces soon. You…”

Tu suddenly stopped at this point because Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu had charged forward!

Tu shook her head, smiled, and walked away. But she’d merely taken a few steps when she seemed to have thought of something and said, “Didn’t that fellow attack me too? Wait, I have to get even for that!”

An afterimage flashed!

At a certain point in the clouds, a woman sat before a Go board. She held a white piece in her right hand yet didn’t put it down, and she was just twirling it between her fingers.

She had a faint smile on her lips.

A moment later, she put the piece down, but nothing happened in front of her.

She looked up into the distance, “Play!”

Her voice carried a trace of an indisputable tone.

A short while later, a voice resounded, “You destroyed the Three Dimensional Universe’s barrier on purpose so that we would enter it. However, you definitely did not do that because you’re bored. So, tell me, why did you do that? What have you been plotting for so many years?”

She chuckled, “You’re asking about too much!”

The voice fell silent.

She smiled, “If you don’t send your forces, I will come to you.”

Suddenly, a black piece flew up into the air and shot at her.

She clamped down on it with two fingers, and then she placed it where it had been, “Don’t attack me. I don’t think it would take two swings of my sword to kill you!”

The voice replied, “We won’t let you use us!”

The woman grinned, “Perfect.”

She picked up Justice that was by the board and walked off.

She walked in a very carefree manner.

She smiled, “In two hours from now, nothing will be left alive in the Four Dimensional Universe, including you. Would you like to bet on that?”

She didn’t stop while she spoke.

Right when she was about to walk out of the clouds, a voice resounded, “You’ve won.”

She stopped, walked over to the Go board, placed her sword down, and smiled, “The sensible live longer.”

The voice remained silent.

She walked over to the nearby tree, stood by its side, and looked down at the clouds below. A short while later, she shook her head and smiled, “I look down at the clouds and laugh at all living things struggling like ants…”
