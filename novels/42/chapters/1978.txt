Chapter 1979 – Someone Yang Ye Knows?

As soon as he emerged from the river, the river below him actually started to vanish bit by bit.

In just a short while, the entire river had vanished without a trace, and it was replaced by an expanse of flat ground.

Yang Ye stood there in silence for a long time, and then he left.

The god race!

He had enough problems, so he really didn’t want to get dragged into the enmity between the god race and the other races, and he didn’t have the ability to do so as well!

This time, Yang Ye sped up. He hadn’t forgotten that the middle aged man from the Weapon Path could only last a month. So, he had to get the 12 swords of slaughter as soon as possible and go to A’Man and the others!

The mountain range simply seemed endless. Yang Ye still hadn’t gotten through it after traveling at full speed for an entire day.

In the end, Yang Ye decided to use his sword.

He really didn’t want to waste his time here.

A sword howl resounded in the mountain, and then a ray of light flashed through the sky.

Yang Ye had a vigilant expression on his face all along the way. But he didn’t encounter any danger.

It didn’t take long for him to stop.

Because he saw an ancient city in the distance.

A city? Yang Ye frowned slightly. He fell silent for a moment, and then he shot towards it.

A short while later, Yang Ye stopped. He was outside the city.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and there were mountains all around the city. It was a city surrounded by towering mountains.

It wasn’t large, and it was just around the size of Sky Residence City.

Its gates were closed tight!

Yang Ye stood silently on the spot for a short while, and then he transformed into a shadow that snuck into the city.

Yang Ye frowned once he entered it.

The city was empty!

An empty city? Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. It didn’t take long for him to arrive at the center of the city, and there was a huge stone tombstone.

A nameless one!

Yang Ye gazed at it for a long time, and then he turned around with the intent to leave.

Suddenly, the tombstone trembled slightly.

Yang Ye stopped and turned to look at it.

It didn’t take long for an old man in a linen robe to walk out from it.

A spirit!

The old man gazed at Yang Ye in silence.

Yang Ye glanced at the old man, and then turned around with the intent to leave. Meanwhile, the old man suddenly said, “You’re an outsider?”

An outsider!

Yang Ye stopped and nodded, “I’m only passing by!”

The old man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, “The Sword Domain, the Enlightened Sword Heart… I didn’t expect it to be a sword cultivator!”

Yang Ye glanced at the old man, “I don’t understand what you’re trying to say!”

The old man grinned, “Do you know why this city is empty?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

“Because all of them are dead!” The old man continued, “The entire city’s population perished during that horrifying battle.”

Yang Ye didn’t say anything in response.

Meanwhile, the old man added, “Young Brother, I have a request!”

As expected! Yang Ye’s expression remained calm. He knew this would happen. So, he remained silent for a moment and asked, “May I know what it is?”

A smile appeared on the old man’s face when Yang Ye didn’t just refuse him outright. However, his smile was quite ghastly.

Yang Ye’s gaze instantly turned icy cold from the sight of this.

Meanwhile, the old man smiled, “It’s nothing, I just want to borrow your body. My soul was heavily injured, so I had to use that Soul Tombstone to nurture my soul. Since your body is so strong, it just happens to be enough to house my soul. So, if you don’t mind, let me use your body for some time!”

The old man wanted to take control of Yang Ye’s body!

Yang Ye had quite a strange expression on his face. He hadn’t expected the old man to want that!

The old man suddenly said, “You won’t refuse, right?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Senior, I’m not ordinary. If you take my body, you may be courting death. Why don’t you just let me go and look for someone else?”

Yang Ye felt that he was the kindest person in the world right now!

“Courting death?” The old man chuckled, “Needless to say, your strength isn’t bad. However, you’re no different than an ant to me.”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “Looks like I can’t refuse?”

The old man grinned, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye replied, “Senior, there’s something I don’t understand. You’re so strong, so why do you only have a soul now? Right, I just want to know before I die. I want to know what caused my death!”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and replied, “I lied a little just now. The people of this city didn’t die in a battle, they were killed by me!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

The old man grinned, “To refine a powerful treasure!”

He started walking slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, “The reason I wasted my breath on you is that my soul just awakened, and it hadn’t fully separated itself from the Soul Tombstone. If you fled then, I really might have been unable to do anything to you. Yet now, hehehe…”

Yang Ye didn’t flee. He just closed his eyes as if he’d accepted his fate.

The old man suddenly transformed into a ray of black light that shot towards Yang Ye and instantly entered Yang Ye’s forehead!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye opened his eyes.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

The old man’s soul hadn’t entered Yang Ye’s sea of consciousness, and it had been sucked into the Primordial Pagoda instead.

The old man was stunned when he entered the pagoda.

He glanced at the surroundings and was quite bewildered, “Where am I?”

“Kill him!” Suddenly, Yang Ye’s voice resounded.

A moment later, a terrifying wave of energy slammed down towards the old man.

The old man seemed to have thought of something, and his eyes opened wide as he spoke with astonishment, “This is the precious treasure of the Dao Path…”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand, and a ray of red light flashed out. In an instant, a blood red flag appeared in the sky. The sky instantly turned blood red like it had been dyed red with blood, and it was absolutely horrifying!

Meanwhile, the old man shot up into the air, formed a strange seal with his hands, and then the blood red flag shook violently. At the same time, numerous black shadows flashed out from it!

If one slowed down the scene here, one would notice that all the black shadows were souls!

Souls that were filled with vengeance!

There were hundreds of thousands of them!

So, the entire Primordial Pagoda seemed to be covered in the souls.

The old man spoke ferociously, “So what if you’re a precious treasure of the Dao Path? Destroy this world!”

Boom!

The entire world started to become ethereal from being struck by those souls.

Snowy blinked as she stood by Hou Qing’s side, and she seemed slightly afraid.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye frowned in the world outside. He hadn’t expected the old man to be so formidable! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Will the Primordial Pagoda be able to deal with him?

Suddenly, a tiny ethereal golden pagoda appeared in the sky.

The old man’s eyes were filled with excitement when he saw the tiny golden pagoda. Of course, there was deep fear in them as well!

“Get it!” Meanwhile, the old man howled with fury, and his voice carried a trace of madness.

In an instant, countless rays of black light surged towards the golden pagoda.

The golden pagoda suddenly shook.

Bang!

An instant later, a stream of violet light flashed out from it.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

In an instant, the black shadows in the sky were obliterated.

The old man was stunned by this. Meanwhile, the tiny golden pagoda arrived above the old man’s head, and it horrified him. He hurriedly gazed at Yang Ye, “Young Brother, I admit defeat. I’m willing to…”

Boom!

Meanwhile, a beam of violet energy flashed down.

Boom!

In an instant, the old man was obliterated!

After it obliterated the old man, the tiny golden pagoda went over to Snowy. It rubbed Snowy’s head lightly, and then transformed into a ray of golden light that vanished into the sky.

Yang Ye and Hou Qing exchanged glances.

Hou Qing shook his head, “That fellow was too confident!”

Yang Ye nodded. He gazed at the blood red flag in midair and asked, “What’s that?”

As he spoke, he waved his right hand, and the blood red flag fell into his grasp.

In an instant, a pungent smell of blood and evil assaulted him!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and then he scanned it with his divine sense. Yang Ye was shocked by what he saw. The flag had a pocket of space within it, and there were over a million souls in it!

Over a million!

Moreover, every single soul was strong!

No wonder he dared to fight the Primordial Pagoda!

He would have had to slaughter at least 100 cities to collect this many powerful souls!

Yang Ye looked through it, and he noticed that the minds of those souls weren't normal anymore. Obviously, they’d been refined in a special way.

Just like that, a million lives had been kept out of reincarnation!

Yang Ye fell silent.

While he’d killed countless, it depended on the circumstances. But the old man’s actions were ruthless and cruel.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing suddenly asked, “What do you plan to do?”

Yang Ye grinned, “Keep it, of course.”

He’d witnessed how strong it was. It was something capable of forcing the Primordial Pagoda to show itself! Just that was sufficient to determine how strong it was!

A trump card!

Yang Ye put the flag away. He had one more trump card now, and it may be able to save his life at a critical moment.

Yang Ye didn’t waste any time. He just left the Primordial Pagoda and glanced at the surroundings. He was about to leave when he suddenly looked towards the right, and a faint voice came from there, “I didn’t expect to meet you here!”
