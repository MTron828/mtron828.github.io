Chapter 2530 – Do You Know Who I Am?

The Ancient Sword Sect’s master was dead!

Yang Ye frowned, “What’s going on?”

Sword Scroll fell silent for a short while and replied, “Let’s head back and have a look! It’s quite strange!”

Yang Ye nodded and vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye shot through the clouds on his sword.

Yang Ye had quite a gloomy expression on his face. He didn’t just feel nothing for the Ancient Sword Sect’s master, he even felt dislike toward the sect master because of Sword Scroll. However, the news of his death was still very strange to be coming abruptly at a time like this.

Moreover, once he was dead, wouldn’t Yang Ye have to be promoted from junior sect master to sect master?

The junior sect master was actually a sect master on reserve. Once something happened to the actual sect master, the junior sect master would naturally be promoted into the sect master!

If it was someone else who was the junior sect master, that person may be happy about this turn of events, but Yang Ye wouldn’t!

What a joke! He didn’t want to become the sect master!

Suddenly, a black robed man appeared before Yang Ye.

The black robed man’s body was covered in strings of black energy, and it was quite horrifying.

The black robed man sized up Yang Ye, “You’re the junior sect master of the Ancient Sword Sect, Ye Yang?”

Yang Ye replied, “You’re quite fast. You found out about me so quickly.”

The black robed man replied, “You instantly killed two Five World Realm experts. Wouldn’t we be idiots if we didn’t investigate?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m a little busy, so just hurry up if you have something to say.”

The black robed man said, “Ye Yang, that person in the Ancient Sword Sect is gone, so the Ancient Sword Sect is finished. If I’m not wrong, the other large powers will drive away your Ancient Sword Sect, just like they did to the Di Clan.”

Yang Ye asked, “And?”

The black robed man replied, “Our Soul Master thinks very highly of you, and he asked me to extend an invite to you. So long as you agree to join us, you’ll be the Vice Sect Master who’s only beneath him!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Is that it?”

The black robed man shook his head, “Looks like it’s as the Soul Master said, you will never join us!”

Yang Ye grinned, “Should I send you off myself?”RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

It was just a clone that was standing before him. Otherwise, he would have attacked a long time ago.

“We’ll meet again very soon!” The black robed man’s figure turned ethereal once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and vanished into the clouds.

This time, he used the Sword Domain to conceal himself!

At the same time, he grew even more vigilant of the Soul Sect. They were actually able to locate him, so their forces were clearly extraordinary!

Yang Ye shot through the sky on his sword, and it only took him around 15 minutes to return to the Ancient Sword Sect. The atmosphere in the sect was very normal, no different than any other day. Obviously, the news of the sect master’s death hadn’t spread yet.

As soon as he returned to the sect, the Grand Elder appeared before him, and Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “What the heck is going on?”

The Grand Elder shook his head, “It was too sudden, so sudden that it took us all by surprise. Come with me, he wants to see you!”

The Grand Elder turned around and led Yang Ye away.

The Grand Elder brought Yang Ye to the peak of the Ancient Sword Sect’s rear mountains. There was a bamboo house there, and Yang Ye saw two familiar faces there. It was Elder Xue and Elder Gu nan. Besides them, there were two more old men.

Once he walked in, the old men glanced at him but didn’t say a word.

Yang Ye nodded slightly to them and looked off ahead. A middle aged man was seated cross-legged on a bamboo bed deep within the house. His skin was loose and sweat seeped out of him from time to time. He seemed like an old man on the verge of death.

His lifespan was almost up!

Yang Ye knew that the middle aged man was the sect master, the man Sword Scroll used to follow!

As if he’d sensed Yang Ye, the middle aged man looked up at him. Yang Ye met his gaze, and they just looked at each other. A short while later, the middle aged man waved his hand, and the others left the bamboo house.

While there were no barriers around the house, there were no auras or divine senses within the house.

The middle aged man suddenly said, “Come here!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and walked over. The middle aged man gazed at him for a long time and said, “She’s with you, right?”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Sect Master, who are you talking about?”

The middle aged man replied softly, “Sword Scroll!”

Yang Ye’s face fell because the middle aged man actually knew about her! He felt that it was impossible!

The middle aged man added, “She was with me for so many years, so I can naturally sense her. Moreover, you asked for the fragments of her main body upon coming here, so I knew that she’d come.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

The middle aged man had a rather complicated expression on his face, “Can you ask her to come outside?”

Yang Ye tried asking her, but it didn’t take long for him to shake his head.

She had refused!

The middle aged man nodded slightly, “I understand.”

He sized up Yang Ye and asked, “Are you the one she chose?”

Yang Ye replied, “Sort of!”

The middle aged man nodded slightly and said, “All those years ago when her body had been shattered, I was severely injured, and the Ancient Sword Sect’s status in Eternal Kingdom was in danger. I…”

Yang Ye suddenly shook his head and said, “Excuses!”

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye said, “No matter what the reason was, it was true that you wanted to devour her. Right? As far as I’m concerned, no matter what the reason is, it isn’t enough to change the fact that you’re a terrible person.”

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye in silence.

Yang Ye walked to the side, “She stayed with you, and for your sake and the Ancient Sword Sect’s sake, her body was destroyed while she almost lost her life. Did she even complain about that? Did she? She didn’t, right? Or perhaps as far as you’re concerned, she’s just a Super Divine Treasure? A Super Divine Treasure that you can lose at any moment? If that’s how you think, then allow me to be honest, you’re a terrible person. Sorry, I’m a frank person!”

The middle aged man fell silent for a short while and replied, “I never treated her as just a Super Divine Treasure. She’s part of the Ancient Sword Sect, and my companion in battle.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Then why did you try to devour her?”

The middle aged man closed his eyes slowly.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “I think that we sword cultivators… Actually, it isn’t just sword cultivators. I think all people should keep our conscience clear! Forget it, I don’t want to talk about all of this. It’s between you and her!”

If he were being honest, he did feel quite angry about what she’d experienced. This middle aged man’s actions were no different than betrayal! No one wouldn’t be hurt by such betrayal!

The middle aged man didn’t say anything. He just withdrew a black spatial ring and flicked it over to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched, “What is this?”

The middle aged man grinned, “All those years ago, I gave consideration to myself, the Ancient Sword Sect, and many other people and things, but I never considered her. I’m sorry!”

His aura suddenly vanished once he finished speaking.

He was dead!

This time, he was really dead!

Meanwhile, Elder Xue and the others walked into the bamboo house, and they lowered their heads in silence when they witnessed the scene before them.

Yang Ye glanced at the spatial ring before him. He hesitated for a moment and raised it to Elder Xue. He was just about to say something when she said, “You’re the sect master now!”

Yang Ye almost jumped, “What?!”

The others exchanged glances. In the end, they bowed slightly to Yang Ye and spoke in unison, “Sect Master.”

Yang Ye hurriedly said, “No, no! This spatial ring isn’t for me, it’s for Elder Xue. I’m serious, it really wasn’t for me…”

They still maintained their bowing posture!

Yang Ye felt it was a scheme of theirs!

Yang Ye’s face was quite unsightly, “Are you trying to force me? Moreover, it’s obvious I’m so young, and I’m so weak too. How could I be the sect master?”

Elder Xue said, “The sect master wanted to see you, so we knew that he had something to tell you. Sure enough, he gave the sect master’s ring to you, so you’re the person he has chosen. As for us, we… we don’t have any objections as well. So, you’re the sect master!”

Yang Ye was stunned. What the heck?!

A short while passed before Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “I’d like to speak to Elder Xue, alone!”

The others exchanged glances and left.

Yang Ye sat at the side and said, “Elder Xue, just be frank!”

She spoke softly, “About what?”

Yang Ye replied, “Don’t treat me like a child!”

She fell silent for a long time before she said, “Actually, it was the sect master who appointed you as junior sect master.”

Yang Ye said, “Continue!”

Elder Xue said, “Only a few people in the sect knew that the sect master’s lifespan was almost over. A very long time ago, we started looking for a new sect master. We chose Gu Nie before you arrived. However, our gazes descended upon you once you arrived. In the beginning, we didn’t really dare to give you any authority, but the sect master suddenly said that you could be trusted. So, we let you become the junior sect master. Now, he passed his ring to you. Obviously, he wants you to be the sect master. While we don’t know the true reason for this, we know he won’t bring harm to the sect. He forced himself to stay alive until now, just for the sect, and he has given up so much for the sect.”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “I can’t be the sect master!”

Elder Xue gazed at Yang Ye, “Give me a reason!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and asked, “Do you know who I am?”

Elder Xue suddenly replied, “Aren’t you Yang Ye?”

Yang Ye’s figure stiffened on the spot.
