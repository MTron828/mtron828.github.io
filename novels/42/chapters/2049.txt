Chapter 2050 – The Weapon Progenitor!

Lei Ye was interfering!

He couldn’t restrain himself any longer when he saw Yang Ye madly slaughter the geniuses of the Prediction Line.

Because if Yang Ye was allowed to continue, even if their joint forces were able to kill Yang Ye, the Prediction Line would have suffered terrible losses, and there would be a gap in a generation of experts for them. That was an absolutely lethal blow to the Prediction Line!

So, he had to act!

Even if Young Martial Uncle had threatened him, he still had to. Otherwise, even if Young Martial Uncle spared him, the Prediction Line wouldn’t.

Moreover, as far as he was concerned, Young Martial Uncle wasn’t here, and he had a chance while Young Martial Uncle’s main body wasn’t here!

Yang Ye glanced at his chest, there was a blood red palm print there, and it had injured his internal organs.

Ferocity curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, and then he looked up at Lei Ye and was about to attack. However, Young Martial Uncle suddenly said, “Stand down!”

Yang Ye gazed at him, and he spoke indifferently, “Now, it’s your turn to watch the show.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he clenched his right fist and slammed it down at Lei Ye.

Lei Ye’s expression changed drastically. He overlapped his palms and pressed them down.

Bang!

The space around him warped, and a wave of violent energy sprayed out from the warped expanse of space.

However, everyone watched with shock as the warped space around Lei Ye instantly collapsed into bits. At the same time, Lei Ye’s figure was slammed into Prediction Mountain.

Boom!

The entire mountain shook violently.

However, Young Martial Uncle didn’t stop. He was about to charge into Prediction Mountain, but an old man suddenly appeared not too far away from him.

The old man glanced at him and asked, “Zhong Ye, is this necessary?”

Yang Ye glanced at Young Martial Uncle, So his name is Zhong Ye!

Zhong Ye chuckled and pointed at Yang Ye, “I brought this kid here, but as soon as he arrived here, your Prediction Line kept targeting him. I didn’t mind all of that, because all of them were juniors. If he’s killed by the younger generation of the Prediction Line, then he deserves death. However…”

Zhong Ye’s face turned cold, “Your Prediction Line’s younger generation are no match for him, so the older generation was sent instead. Fuck! Do you think my Slaughter Line is still that easily bullied as it once was?”

The old man was about to speak when Zhong Ye suddenly pointed at him, “Old dog! Don’t say I never gave you a chance. Give me Lei Ye’s head right now, and I’ll let this go. Otherwise, I’ll crush the Prediction Line today!””

The old man’s face was extremely unsightly from being threatened so bluntly.

Meanwhile, Zhong Ye suddenly said, “Three, I’ll count to three. If I don’t see his head, then no one can stop me today!”

He pointed at Yang Ye, “You count!”

Yang Ye was stunned for a moment and quickly said, “Three, two, one!”

Zhong Ye’s eyelids twitched. He glanced at Yang Ye, and he didn’t say a word before immediately closing his eyes. In an instant, the space around him trembled, and around 10 breaths of time passed before a ray of light suddenly shot down from deep in space. A moment later, it entered Zhong Ye’s body.

His main body had arrived!

The old man’s expression became extremely solemn when he witnessed this.

Meanwhile, Zhong Ye opened his eyes. A moment later, he slapped his palm down at the old man. The latter’s expression changed drastically, and he hadn’t even been able to react before his body was slapped into pieces!

He’d been killed in an instant!

Yang Ye was extremely shocked when he witnessed this. Because the old man from before was a Half-Step Sage Realm expert at the very least!

However, he’d been killed just like that!

After he killed the old man in an instant, Zhong Ye’s gaze descended upon Prediction Mountain, and then he leaped up, stretched out his right hand, and flipped it. In an instant, a wave of powerful energy enveloped the mountain.

At this moment, the entire Prediction Mountain trembled. Obviously, Zhong Ye was really planning on crushing Prediction Mountain!

Suddenly, a wave of powerful energy surged up from the mountain, and it slammed against Zhong Ye.

A cold smile curled up on Zhong Ye’s lips, “What? You’re finally making a move?”

He flipped his palm and slapped it down once he finished speaking.

Bang!

The energy was obliterated.

Meanwhile, an ethereal figure appeared at the peak of the mountain. It was covered in a ball of white light, so others couldn’t see its true appearance at all.

Zhong Ye laughed coldly, “Han Xian, use your main body. I’ve been waiting for this battle for almost a thousand years.”

Han Xian!

The Seal Master of the Prediction Line!

Han Xian replied, “Zhong Ye, you seem very confident in yourself!”

“Confident?” Zhong Ye roared with laughter, and he laughed for a while before pointing at Han Xian, “Han Xian, it’s not that I look down upon you, but if our ancestor didn’t stop me all those years ago, I would have annihilated the Prediction Line then. But it’s fine, I can still do it today.”

Zhong Ye waved his hands, and the entire Weapon Dimension started to tremble. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Zhong Ye, don’t be rash!” Suddenly, a voice came from afar, and then an old man arrived here.

Besides him, three other middle aged men arrived.

They were the Seal Masters of the other Lines.

The old man hurriedly said, “Zhong Ye, the strength both of you possess is enough to harm the Weapon Dimension’s core. Please think of the entire Weapon Path!”

Both Zhong Ye and Han Xian’s strengths were at an extremely terrifying level. If they fought, then Prediction Mountain wouldn’t be the only one affected, the entire Weapon Path wouldn’t be able to escape harm!

“The entire Weapon Path?” Zhong Ye was visibly furious, “Why doesn’t the Prediction Line do that? Why didn’t all of you step forward and say that when he sent his forces to annihilate my Slaughter Line?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he raised his right hand slightly, and then a crimson gold spear appeared in his grasp. An instant later, he leaped up and stabbed it at Han Xian.

Hiss!

At this moment, the entire world became ethereal. At the same time, countless spear images appeared in the sky. They were like a dense storm that surged down at Han Xian and Prediction Mountain.

If they were to strike, the entire Prediction Mountain would cease to exist!

Han Xian would naturally not allow Zhong Ye to destroy Prediction Mountain, so a sword suddenly shot up into the air and stabbed at the spear images which filled the sky. At the same time, a huge dome of light covered the entire Prediction Mountain while countless rays of white light shot up into the air.

Ridicule curled up on the corners of Zhong Ye’s mouth, and then he waved his hands and slapped them down!

Bang!

The countless spear images in the air instantly sped up and shot down.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

In an instant, explosions resounded throughout the surroundings, and the space in a huge area shook. Besides that, the smaller mountains around Prediction Mountain even started to collapse.

It was like the end of the world had arrived!

The Seal Masters of the other Lines had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces, but they didn’t dare to do anything. Because they were very well aware that Zhong Ye was only acting against the Prediction Line right now, but once they attacked him, it would be equivalent to going against Zhong Ye. Zhong Ye was all alone right now, so if he were to go berserk, none of the five Lines could endure the consequences!

The others immediately joined forces to stabilize the space here.

Meanwhile, the battle was still going on. The formation around Prediction Mountain had vanished. Obviously, it had been destroyed.

At the peak of Prediction Mountain. Zhong Ye’s face was growing even fiercer, “Han Xian, let’s get even for what happened all those years ago. Your Prediction Line annihilated my Slaughter Line. Now, I’m going to annihilate your Prediction Line and make it vanish from this world!”

Zhong Ye took a step forward, and he hurled his spear forward.

At this moment, the entire world had turned ethereal!

It was too strong to the point that this world couldn’t endure it!

One of the old men at the side shook his head. Because while the attack was aimed at Han Xian, even if he could resist this attack, at least half of Prediction Mountain would be destroyed by the aftershock. In a battle between two extraordinary experts, the aftershock of their battle wasn’t something anyone ordinary could endure!

Countless members of the Prediction Line looked up at the sky in terror. If the spear descended, it was obvious that they would die!

At this moment, they finally realized how terrifying the Young Martial Uncle of the Slaughter Line was!

However, right when the spear was about to descend, the surroundings fell silent.

Yang Ye frowned and looked up at the sky. Everything had stopped moving there, even Zhong Ye and his spear.

A moment of silence ensued before all the energy here vanished.

Someone was stopping the battle!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. If he wasn’t wrong, it was probably the Weapon Progenitor.

Suddenly, a golden seal floated down from the sky and arrived before Yang Ye, “From today onward, Yang Ye is officially my Weapon Path’s Seal Master. What happened here today will end now.”

Suddenly, Yang Ye pushed away the seal and said, “I’m sorry, I refuse to become the Slaughter Line’s Seal Master!”

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye when they heard this.
