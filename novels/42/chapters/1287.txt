Chapter 1288 – It’s Time!

A wisp of shock flashed through Qian Lankong’s eyes. Obviously, she hadn’t expected Shui Linlang to actually be a Voider!

Yang Ye was quite surprised as well. But he remained very calm on the outside and immediately nodded, “That’s rare. You’ve actually attained the Voider Realm. But do you think that you can fight me upon attaining the Voider Realm?”

She laughed coldly and said, “How laughable! Do you know that I attained the Voider Realm a long time ago, and it was even under the Pavilion Master’s help! Yet now, you’re very surprised that I’m a Voider. But you say that you’re not an impostor?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I didn’t help you attain the Voider Realm.” He naturally couldn’t admit it right now. Otherwise, he would lose any chance to take control of the Slayer Pavilion.

So, he absolutely couldn’t admit it!

“You still refuse to admit it?” She laughed coldly and was about to say something. However, Qian Lankong suddenly said, “Shui Linlang, do you think I’m a fake as well?”

“Protector Qian, you’re definitely not fake!” Shui Linlang continued, “But I really don’t understand why you’ve brought someone here to act as the pavilion master. Could it be that you want to take control over the Slayer Pavilion?”

“You’re courting death!” Qian Lankong was about to attack, but Yang Ye stopped her.

Yang Ye walked slowly towards Shui Linlang. It didn’t take long for him to arrive before her. But she remained completely unafraid and looked him in the eyes, “What? You want to kill me to keep me quiet?”

Yang Ye replied, “You would be dead if I wanted to kill you. You say I’m a fake. Alright, then tell me where the real pavilion master is?”

If he could use his sword, he would definitely join forces with Qian Lankong to kill Shui Linlang. But the problem was that he couldn’t utilize his sword. If he couldn’t, then it would be impossible for their joint forces to kill her in a short period of time. Moreover, even if he utilized his physical strength, it would definitely expose many weaknesses in his disguise. After all, the pavilion master of Slayer Pavilion had never fought with his physical strength in the past.

If he couldn’t annihilate her in an instant, then he would really look like he was trying to kill her to keep her quest. Once the others became suspicious, it would be extremely disadvantageous to his plans to take control of the Slayer pavilion. Even though it wasn’t difficult for him and Qian Lankong to join forces and annihilate everyone here, it wasn’t what he wanted. He wanted a united Slayer Pavilion and not one that had split apart, and absolutely not a Slayer Pavilion that had suffered heavy losses.

The other hall masters immediately gazed at Shui Linlang when they heard Yang Ye.

Shui Linlang’s eyes narrowed slightly, “I too would like to know where the real pavilion master is.”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Kill her!”

Qian Lankong and the other 11 hall masters were about to attack when they heard Yang Ye. However, Shui Linlang suddenly said, “Do you know why I’m aware that you aren’t the pavilion master? Because I’m his! His voice, his aura, and even the way he moves and the fine actions he makes. I know all of it!”

The hall masters immediately stopped and gazed at Yang Ye.

Qian Lankong hesitated for a moment and didn’t act in the end. She similarly knew that dealing with these fellows wouldn’t be a problem if she joined forces with Yang Ye. But if she did that, then the Slayer Pavilion would suffer heavy losses. After all, the hall masters were in charge of everything throughout the pavilion. Moreover, they were extremely strong and had many loyal subordinates. If they were killed, the Slayer Pavilion would fall into chaos for some time.

It wouldn’t be a problem at any other ordinary time, but the Slayer Pavilion was plagued with troubles now. If internal strife arose within the Slayer Pavilion, then it wouldn’t have the strength to resist the Yuan Clan and the other powers.

Yang Ye said, “You say that you’re mine?”

Shui Linlang spoke coldly, “Let me correct that, I’m not yours. I belong to the pavilion master!”

Yang Ye turned to look at the other hall masters, “Do all of you believe her?”

Hall Master Zhao hesitated for a moment before he said, “I don’t. Because no one in this world would dare to pretend to be the pavilion master. Moreover, there’s no reason for Protector Qian to betray the pavilion. However, since Hall Master Shui doesn’t believe you, Pavilion Master, why don’t you prove your identity and convince her?”

A cold smile arose on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth. Even though Hall Master Zhao said that he believed Yang Ye, he wanted Yang Ye to prove his identity. So, he clearly didn’t believe Yang Ye.

Shui Linlang laughed coldly, “Do you dare to prove it?”

“Tell me how I should prove it!” As he spoke, Yang Ye clenched his right fist slowly because he didn’t mind using force if he really couldn’t convince them.

Hall Master Zhao said, “Everyone knows that the pavilion master possesses the Laws of Space and can fuse into one with space. So, Pavilion Master, please utilize it for us. Alright?”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then his right fist relaxed. But he didn’t say anything and just remained silent.

A cold smile immediately curled onto the corners of Shui Linlang’s mouth, “What? You don’t possess it? Right, how many in the world are capable of comprehending the Laws of Space.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot. At the same time, the space in the surroundings started to ripple swiftly!

The Laws of Space!

Shui Linlang was stunned by the sight of this.

Meanwhile, Hall Master Zhao and the others gazed at her with displeasure.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to appear once more in front of them. He paid no attention to Shui Linlang, and he just gazed at Hall Master Zhao and the others, “Leave and complete what I ordered earlier.”

“Yes!” They bowed respectfully and hurriedly left.

Only Yang Ye, Qian Lankong, and Shui Linlang remained in the hall.

Shui Linlang stared at Yang Ye and said, “You... you’re not the pavilion master!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I really am not him.”

Qian Lankong’s eyes opened wide. Obviously, she hadn’t expected him to suddenly say that. Even Shui Linlang was stunned.

Yang Ye took off his mask and said, “I’m the Sword Alliance’s master, Yang Ye.”

Qian Lankong was completely stunned.

“Yang Ye!” Shui Linlang’s eyes opened wide. She naturally knew Yang Ye. Because after the Slayer Pavilion accepted the commission to kill Yang Ye, it had immediately started to investigate Yang Ye. Yang Ye, the master of the Sword Alliance, the number one sword cultivator on the continent, the number one genius on the continent.... She hadn’t expected Yang Ye to have actually come to Slayer Pavilion and even pretend to be its pavilion master.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “Actually, I’m his disciple.”

Qian Lankong and Shui Linlang were both rendered speechless.

They were clearly stunned by what Yang Ye had just said.

Yang Ye continued, “Miss Shui, you should have investigated me, right? But did you find out anything about my origins?”

She gazed at Yang Ye for a short while before shaking her head.

Yang Ye nodded, “You aren’t the only one, no one is able to discover my background. Because I was fostered in secret by the pavilion master. Besides the pavilion master, no one else knows my true identity. Besides that, do you know why the Sword Alliance was able to rise so quickly? Do you know why the Sword Alliance could crush the World Devastator Cult? Do you know why even the 7 Voiders sent by the Yuan Clan and those other powers weren’t able to kill me? Do you know why the pavilion master went to Dark Hell Continent?”

Shui Linlang remained silent for a long time before she said, “Because the pavilion master is supporting you, and he was helping you from the shadows. That was why you were able to rise to prominence in such a short period, and that was why you were able to survive the joint attack of the forces from the Yuan Clan and those other powers.”

Qian Lankong was at a loss for words.

“Smart!” Yang Ye continued, “Everyone knows that I have the backing of someone, but they don’t know who. Actually, it’s the pavilion master, and the entire Slayer Pavilion.”

Shui Linlang asked, “It was the pavilion master who asked you to pretend to be him?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Shui Linlang asked, “Why?”

Yang Ye answered, “Because the pavilion master can hide in the shadows and do many things. Understand?”

Shui Linlang asked in a low voice, “What does he actually hope to accomplish?” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Yang Ye shook his head, “That isn’t something you should ask.”

Shui Linlang’s expression changed slightly. Meanwhile, Yang Ye continued, “Miss Shui, you’re a smart person, so you should know how to differentiate between what you need to know and what you don’t need to know. Once you know things that you shouldn’t know, it wouldn’t bring any benefits to you. Besides that, even I don’t know many things. Now, you just have to cooperate with me.”

Shui Linlang asked, “Can I see him?”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly while a trace of killing intent appeared in its depths, “You don’t believe me?”

Shui Linlang shook her head, “You possess the Laws of Space. That proves that you definitely learned it from him. Moreover, unless the pavilion master gave the order, Protector Qian would definitely not assist you. I just want to see him. Even though he holds no feelings towards me and has never really treated me as his woman, I would still like to see him.”

Yang Ye remained silent for a short while, and then he shook his head, “I can’t contact him. He contacts me when he needs something. However, I’ll tell him what you said if he contacts me again.

Shui Linlang’s gaze dimmed down, and then she nodded, “I understand. Since you’re his disciple, I’ll fully cooperate with you.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and left the hall.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief when he saw her leave. He had 2 choices just now. Either kill her or trick her. He’d chosen the latter. Because if he chose to kill her, it would definitely cause a great deal of trouble for him. Moreover, he didn’t want to lose an assassin at the Voider Realm. After all, he needed experts the most, right now!

Fortunately, he’d succeeded.

Meanwhile, Qian Lankong spoke abruptly, “Are you feeling very self-satisfied from tricking a woman?”

Yang Ye turned around and glanced at her, “You wanted me to kill her?”

Qian Lankong spoke indifferently, “You’re such a shameless fellow who only knows how to trick women!”

Yang Ye wore his mask and just ignored her as he walked towards the exit. He’d realized that it was impossible to reason with her because she would absolutely not try to reason with him.

Meanwhile, Qian Lankong suddenly asked, “Where are you going?!”

Yang Ye didn’t even look back as he answered, “I’ve been pursued for so long, so it’s time for me to kill them instead.”
