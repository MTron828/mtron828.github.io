Chapter 2094 – Something’s Off!

Suddenly, the tiny vortex within Yang Ye started spinning.

It was dangerous!

Yang Ye’s mind instantly cleared up.

Since it was warning him of danger, there was definitely a huge problem with all of this.

Yang Ye started moving backwards, and he intended to leave the island. Suddenly, he seemed to have thought of something, and he stopped once more. He looked to the left, and it was where A’Man and the old man were. At this moment, the old man had sat down, and A’Man was slightly hesitant.

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to go over to her.

A’Man was shocked to see him, “You…”

As soon as she said that, Yang Ye grabbed her arm and took her over 1km away.

A’Man asked, “Is something wrong?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “There’s something wrong here! Come with me!”

A’Man was puzzled, “There’s something wrong?”

Yang Ye nodded, “You don’t trust me?”

She gazed at him for a short while and said, “Of course I do. However, I want to warn…”

“No!” Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Firstly, he won’t believe you. Even if he knows there’s something wrong, he won’t rashly give up this opportunity. Besides that, he has sat down, so it’s probably too late to warn him now.”

A'Man shot a glance over, and she saw that over 20 Sages had sat down.

Yang Ye didn’t want to waste more time. He grabbed her arm and vanished into the sky. It didn’t take long for them to arrive far away, and they can vaguely see the island from this point in the sky.

A’Man suddenly asked, “That isn’t the Bodhi Tree?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m not sure. I’m only sure that there’s something wrong. I’m sure you sensed it too, right?”

She nodded slightly, “I sensed something was off, but I can’t put a finger on it!”

Yang Ye said, “We can sense that because we’re not Sages, so we don’t have that desperate desire to advance further.”

He turned and gazed at the island, “Anyway, we’ll know soon enough if there is something wrong!”

A'Man nodded, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “You grow so quickly. Even Sages can’t kill you with ease now, right?”

Yang Ye said, “So what? I’m facing more than one Sage. Right, what do you know about the Sage Alliance?”

“The Sage Alliance?” She frowned. A short while passed before she spoke solemnly, “The Sage Alliance is actually an alliance made jointly by all the races, and its Sages come from all the races. They established the alliance as a precaution against the four paths. Otherwise, if any one of the paths became unhappy, wouldn’t the other races be reduced to slaves? So, they established the alliance, and if the four paths try to enslave them, they will choose to join forces against the four paths. For example, when dealing with the four paths, and you…”

All the races!

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Can they fight the four paths?”

A’Man laughed bitterly, “It’s difficult. After all, the four paths have progenitors. However, it isn’t to the point that they can’t resist at all. Moreover, it’s impossible for all four paths to join forces. They still have a chance if they’re facing just a single path. As for if the four paths join forces, then if all the races are willing to stop at nothing, then they can cause mutual destruction for themselves and the four paths.”

Yang Ye asked, “Where’s the headquarters of the Sage Alliance?”

A'Man gazed at him, “What are you planning?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “I’m just asking. You don’t think that I want to go to their headquarters, right? I’m not that strong!”

A’Man thought for a while and felt that what Yang Ye said was true. While he was a monstrous genius, it was absolutely impossible for him to fight the entire Sage Alliance on his own. Even if Yang Ye attained the Sage Realm, he was absolutely incapable of fighting the entire Sage Alliance.

Suddenly, A’Man said, “Look!”

Yang Ye looked over, and he noticed that many white dots had appeared around the tree!

Yang Ye frowned, “What’s going on?”

She spoke in a low voice, “Something has definitely happened. Let’s get a little closer and have a look?”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and nodded, “Alright!”

They stopped when they were around 30 km away from the island. At this moment, they could see the Sages on the island, and they could see it all very clearly. Those Sages were still seated cross-legged on the wooden benches, and all of them seemed like they were in a deep meditative state and weren’t moving at all.

Suddenly, A’Man pointed at one of the Sages, “Look over there!”

Yang Ye’s gaze followed along her finger, and his face fell when he saw the Sage she was pointing at. That old man’s hair had been black, but it was actually turning white at a visible rate. Moreover, wrinkles were gradually appearing on his face. In the end, the Sage’s face was covered in wrinkles, and his hair had even turned snow white. He seemed absolutely old!

However, this wasn’t the end of it.

Yang Ye and A’Man watched with shock as the Sage’s hair actually started falling off in clumps. Besides that, his skin was drying up like a drying tangerine.

Yang Ye frowned, “What’s going on?”

A’Man had a gloomy expression on her face, but she didn’t say anything. At this moment, they couldn’t figure out what was going on. However, the same thing started happening to another Sage near that Sage.

Around 15 minutes later, they watched as those Sages started to undergo changes. Just like the first Sage, their hair turned snow white, more and more wrinkles appeared, and then their hair started to fall off…

A’Man spoke in a low voice, “What is happening to them?”

Yang Ye shook his head. He couldn’t figure it out either. They were definitely experiencing something, but he didn’t know if it was a good thing or bad thing!

Time trickled by.

Two hours later, one of them suddenly opened his eyes. At this moment, his eyes were extremely muddy as if he was losing his sight, and it was even slightly blurry. As he gazed at the tree in front of him, he had a slightly blank look as he spoke, “I… I see… that’s it…”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye and A’Man watched as his body actually transformed into sand that scattered on the ground.

He was gone.

A Sage was gone just like that!

Yang Ye and A’Man exchanged glances, and there was astonishment in their eyes. Because they were very sure that Sage hadn’t vanished, that Sage had died.

What had he experienced? What happened that made a Sage die just like that?

However, that was just the beginning. After that, Sage after Sage started to vanish on the wooden bench just like the first Sage.

Around 15 minutes later, only three Sages remained on the wooden benches!

As for the rest, they had vanished without making a sound!

Yang Ye gazed at the tree. The tree was very calm, and there was nothing strange about it.

Is that really the Bodhi Tree? Such a thought had appeared in Yang Ye’s mind.

Meanwhile, A’Man suddenly said, “Look over there!”

Yang Ye looked over, and he saw another Sage perish.

That Sage had vanished too!

He’d vanished from the wooden bench just like that.

“Something’s strange!” Meanwhile, A’Man spoke solemnly, “These Sage’s are definitely extremely mentally strong, and it’s impossible for anything normal to make them vanish without making a sound.”

Yang Ye nodded. Those capable of attaining the Sage Realm had definitely experienced countless setbacks. So, even if they had inner demons, they would have conquered them. Since that was the case, what was making them gradually perish?

Perhaps he could find out the answer if he sat on the wooden bench, but Yang Ye wasn’t an idiot, so he would never do that.

Only two Sages remained there!

Time trickled by. Finally, two hours later, one of them opened their eyes. At this moment, he’d aged to an indescribable state. He just gazed at the tree, and then slowly stretched out his hand. However, he noticed to his astonishment that he actually didn’t even have the strength to raise his hand.

He didn’t have any strength left in him!

At this moment, he understood the state he was in. A long time later, he gazed at the tree and laughed bitterly, and then he turned around to look at Yang Ye and A’Man. His lips moved, and he seemed like he wanted to say something.

However, he didn’t even have the strength to speak. But he didn’t give up and tried hard to say something.

Suddenly, his eyes opened wide, and then his body suddenly vanished.

He’d perished!

A’Man asked in a low voice, “What was he trying to say?”

Yang Ye shook his head and closed his eyes slowly, “He wanted to say something, but something seemed to not want to let him do that. What did he want to say?”

At this moment, both their hearts felt extremely heavy.

Short while passed before they looked at the final Sage. Suddenly, that Sage opened his eyes. As soon as he did that, Yang Ye and A’Man noticed that the Sage had suddenly grown younger as if time had been reversed on him. His snowy white hair had turned pitch black, and the wrinkles on his face has vanished.

“Haha!” Roaring laughter resounded, and then the final Sage shot up into the sky. At the same time, a powerful aura swept out and caused the entire world to tremble before it!

“I see!” The Sage suddenly glanced at Yang Ye after speaking those words, and there was a trace of a mysterious glow in his eyes. In the end, he vanished into the sky. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Yang Ye frowned.

Something’s off!
