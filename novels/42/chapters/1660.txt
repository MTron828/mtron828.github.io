Translator: InVader

Yang Ye stopped because the Soul Nurturing Tree had appeared in front of him again.

Obviously, it had grown fond of his Primordial Violet Energy. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Yang Ye was in quite a difficult position as he gazed at it. He really wanted to take it with him. After all, it would be extremely beneficial to his soul. However, he was very well aware that the Ku Clan would absolutely not allow him to do so.

Suddenly, Snowy appeared before him. She blinked at the Soul Nurturing Tree, and then flew over to it before waving her claws about. After that, she returned to Yang Ye’s shoulder.

Meanwhile, the old man in a luxurious robe, Ku Rong, and Ku Zhuyi had appeared not too far away from Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at them and shrugged, “Seniors, what is it trying to say?”

The old man pondered deeply for a few moments and said, “It may have grown fond of your unique profound energy.”

Yang Ye revealed an utterly innocent expression as he said, “What should we do?”

The old man in a luxurious robe and Ku Rong were in quite a difficult position. The Soul Nurturing Tree possessed intelligence of its own, and it was quite special. So, the Ku Clan didn’t want to use force on it. However, the Ku Clan would absolutely not allow it to go with Yang Ye.

Suddenly, the Soul Nurturing Tree vanished on the spot. The old man’s expression changed slightly, and he was about to stop it, but it didn’t take long for him to be stunned. Because it had actually returned to the round platform in the forest.

The old man and Ku Rong exchanged glances, and there was a wisp of bewilderment in their eyes. Obviously, they didn’t understand why it would suddenly change its mind. However, it was a good thing for the Ku Clan!

The old man glanced at Yang Ye, and then he gazed at Ku Zhuyi, “Send Brother Yang off.”

At this moment, all he wanted was for Yang Ye to leave as soon as possible and prevent the Soul Nurturing Tree from changing its decision.

Ku Zhuyi gazed at Yang Ye, “Let’s go.”

Yang Ye didn’t delay. He nodded, and then he transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky while Ku Zhuyi followed closely behind him.

“That kid’s profound energy is quite special!” Ku Rong spoke in a low voice, “I’ve never seen such profound energy!”

The old man in a luxurious robe shook his head slightly, “I’ve never seen it either.”

Ku Rong remained silent for a moment before he said, “Unfortunately, he’s a young master of the Yang Clan. Otherwise, we could have kept him in our clan.”

The old man shook his head, “That kid isn’t someone that’s easy to deal with. His arrival may bring chaos to our Ku Clan.”

Ku Rong shook his head and chuckled when he recalled Yang Ye’s temper.

It didn’t take long for them to vanish on the spot.

On the round platform on the ground below, the Soul Nurturing Tree suddenly shook slightly, but it didn’t take long for it to return to normal.

…

Outside Kuyan System.

Ku Zhuyi stopped upon sending him here, and she gazed at Yang Ye, “Let’s part ways here.”

Yang Ye turned around to gaze at her, and he smiled, “Sister Zhuyi, I’ll come see you again.”

She spoke indifferently, “It’s best if you don’t.”

Yang Ye chuckled and turned around with the intent to leave. However, he seemed to have thought of something and added, “Right, how do I get on the Milky Way Rankings?”

She asked, “You want to get on the rankings?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Not really. I’m just asking. Of course, I would like to have a look if it’s possible.”

Ku Zhuyi fell silent for an instant, and then she explained, “The Milky Way Rankings is set by the Qin Clan. If they think you can be ranked on it, then you will. Of course, you can head to the Qin Clan’s Spatial Arena to challenge the geniuses on the Milky Way Rankings. You’ll replace the rankings of your opponent if you win. Of course, you can’t immediately challenge others who’re too high up the rankings. You’re only able to challenge those who are two rankings higher than you.”

Yang Ye nodded, “What’s that Spatial Arena you spoke about?”

Ku Zhuyi said, “A special arena. You can head to the Qin Clan to get a spatial teleportation talisman. In that way, you can teleport to the arena at a moment’s notice.” She paused for a moment and continued, “Most of the geniuses in our medium universe have gotten that teleportation talisman. Because you’ll be able to encounter all sorts of formidable opponents there, and it’s a very good way to temper yourself.”

“I see!” Yang Ye nodded. Geniuses like them would definitely refuse to stay at home and just cultivate every single day. The geniuses who only cultivated bitterly had no combat experience, so no matter how great their cultivations were, it would be easy for them to be killed. That was why many people were killed by cultivators below their realms of cultivation, and it was also why many could surmount their realms of cultivation to fight opponents of a higher cultivation realm.

Battle was the best method to improve a person’s strength!

Meanwhile, Ku Zhuyi said, “Your Yang Clan’s fight for succession is about to begin. Are you going to compete too?”

Yang Ye shrugged, “What else?” He sized up Ku Zhuyi at this point and added, “Why don’t you come help me? I need the help.”

She glanced indifferently at him, “You’re dreaming. I wanted to warn you that besides those young masters of your Yang Clan, you have to be even more careful about the help they’re getting. Because I heard the members of the Ying Clan are participating too.”

“The Ying Clan?” Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “The Yang Clan will allow that?”

Ku Zhuyi replied, “As far as those old fellows of your clan are concerned, so long as you have the ability, you can even drag the disciples of all the other clans to your side. Because it’s impossible for them to pose a threat to the Yang Clan. Moreover, only a single person will be able to survive by the end of the fight for succession, and that person will have to go through many tests. So, they aren’t worried that other powers will take control of the Yang Clan’s future successor and patriarch.”

Yang Ye nodded and asked, “Is the Ying Clan very strong?”

Ku Zhuyi nodded, “Very. The second on the Milky Way Rankings is from the Ying Clan. Moreover, it has another disciple in the top ten!”

Yang Ye was curious, “Who’s the first? Which clan is that person from?”

Ku Zhuyi shook her head in response, “I don’t know. Only those two fellows ranked at the first and second would. Because only they have the right to meet that fellow who’s ranked first.” She paused for a moment and continued, “I heard the first may be at the True Realm!”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. The True Realm!The True Realm at below the age of 40!

If the first on the rankings really was at the True Realm, that person would be absolutely terrifying! That person was simply not human!

“Alright!” Meanwhile, Ku Zhuyi said, “I’m heading back.” As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and vanished into the distance.

Yang Ye gazed in the direction she’d vanished towards, and he just stared for a short while before he transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the distance. However, he hadn’t gone far when an energy palm flashed out from the space in front of him and slapped down towards him!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He didn’t stop and just drew his sword.

Bang!

The energy palm was instantly shattered by his sword. Meanwhile, a black robed old man appeared before him!

It was Mo Lin!

Yang Ye had a calm expression on his face, and he didn’t seem surprised.

Meanwhile, Mo Lin laughed coldly, “Little Bastard, weren’t you acting really arrogant in the Ku Clan? Weren’t you? Come! Why don’t you do that again right now?”

Yang Ye shook his head. He didn’t waste his breath. He just stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that shot forward.

“Ant!” Mo Lin’s voice carried a trace of ridicule, and he immediately transformed into a ray of black light that vanished on the spot.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded, and Yang Ye and Mo Lin were pushed back at the same time. However, Mo Lin stopped after being pushed 300m back while Yang Ye had been pushed almost 1km back.

“Little Bastard, you have some skill!” Mo Lin started walking slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, “However, as far as I’m concerned, you’re still an ant!” As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a beam of black light that surged towards Yang Ye.

Sword intent surged madly out of Yang Ye, and then he tapped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

Bang!

They collided in midair, causing the space here to tremble violently. After that, both of them were pushed backwards repeatedly by the force of the collision. After being pushed over 300m back, Yang Ye suddenly stopped, and then his soul flashed out of his body.

At the same time, a wave of terrifying intent suddenly surged out from within him and instantly turned the starry sky around him blood red!

Zenith Rank slaughter intent!

“Old Dog! I’ll kill you with one strike!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s soul transformed into a ray of blood red light that vanished on the spot.

The soul version of the Sword of Rebirth!

This was the swiftest attack he’d ever executed since he learned the Sword of Rebirth. Because he’d even activated his Flash Boots, his speed had instantly risen explosively by countless times. His current speed was swift to the limit!

At the moment Yang Ye’s figure vanished, Mo Lin’s expression had changed drastically. A moment later, his aura as a Half-Step True Realm expert surged out madly from within him. However, a speck of blood red light had arrived at the exact same instant that his aura had surged out. The aura was like a balloon that had been pricked by a needle, and it instantly exploded apart.

After that, another terrifying wave of pressure slammed down upon Mo Lin!

Sword intent!

Sword intent and slaughter intent at once!

Hiss!

A ray of blood red light shot out of the back of Mo Lin’s head, and then Mo Lin’s body stiffened on the spot.

Yang Ye sheathed his sword!

He turned around to gaze at Mo Lin, and the latter was staring blankly at him, “How… swift…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “I’m not in the mood to listen to your nonsense!”

He immediately waved his sword, and a ray of blood red light pierced through the center of Mo Lin’s forehead and put an end to his life.

Yang Ye sized up Mo Lin’s corpse and shook his head, “What a pity!”

Those killed by the Sword of Rebirth couldn’t be refined into Sword Servants. Otherwise, he would have obtained a puppet at the Half-Step True Realm!

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he turned around with the intent to leave. Suddenly, the space in front of him trembled, causing Yang Ye’s eyes to narrow slightly while he tightened his grip on his sword.

Suddenly, the space there cracked open, and then a black shadow flashed out from within the rift.

Yang Ye’s eyes immediately opened wide at the sight of it, “What the…”
