Chapter 2161 – No One Can Stop Me!

In the starry sky, the Dao Progenitor gazed at the armless man for a long time, and then he shook his head and fell silent.

The armless man glanced at Yang Ye, and then he vanished into the endless reaches of space.

The area returned to calm.

Meanwhile, down below.

Yang Ye had fallen unconscious. After killing numerous Sages from the Buddhist Path, he’d reached his own limits. Besides that, he was covered in injuries from the battle with them.

On the verge of collapse!

At this moment, his body was truly on the verge of collapse!

Yang Ye was in An Nanjing’s arms, and Ding Shaoyao was by her side. The Sovereign of Sky’s group was nearby, but there were only around five Sages left around him. Most of them had been killed by An Nanjing, and some had been killed by the experts of the god race.

The Buddhist Path had retreated while the god race had joined the battle, so the Alliance of All could be said to have suffered a terrible loss.

They’d lost completely!

Ding Shaoyao walked over to An Nanjing’s side and asked, “Is he alright?”

An Nanjing glanced at Ding Shaoyao and shook her head, “The violet energy is repairing his body. His life isn’t at risk.”

Ding Shaoyao nodded slightly, and then she gazed at the Sovereign of Sky, “Do you want the Sprite Lord that badly?”

A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of the Sovereign of Sky’s mouth, “Don’t tell me your god race doesn’t want it!”

Ding Shaoyao nodded, “That’s true, we do want it. However, we won’t try to take it at a time like this. Do you know why the Buddhist Path retreated?”

The Sovereign of Sky’s eyes narrowed slightly. It was something he was wondering about too.

Ding Shaoyao walked over to the Sovereign of Sky and said, “The join forces of all the races? To be honest, when you don’t have a Progenitor Realm expert, you’re just a bunch of clowns to some organizations. Annihilating all of you would only take an instant for them. If I were you, I would do everything I can to help the Sky Emperor. If he comes back to life, then maybe your sky race will have a place for itself into the world that’s to come. Otherwise, it will become history!”

The Sky Emperor!

The Sovereign of Sky’s face fell. He remained silent for a long time before taking a glance at Yang Ye and An Nanjing, and then leaving.

Suddenly, An Nanjing stood up. The Sovereign of Sky’s eyelids twitched from the sight of this. Does she want to fight again?

Suddenly, Ding Shaoyao walked over to An Nanjing, and then she shook her head slightly.

An Nanjing looked Ding Shaoyao in the eyes, “Why?”

Ding Shaoyao gazed at Yang Ye, “Take good care of him first. The Alliance of all isn’t the only force that wishes to kill him, so don’t give others a chance.”

An Nanjing glanced at Yang Ye, fell silent for a moment, and then gazed at the Sovereign of Sky, “Just you wait!”

She bent down and took Yang Ye in her arms, and then vanished on the spot.

Once Yang Ye vanished with An Nanjing, the bloody aura here reduced drastically.

The Sovereign of Sky heaved a sigh of relief from the sight of this. If An Nanjing refused to stop, then while he didn’t fear her, there were other experts of the god race here. The joint forces of An Nanjing’s group and the god race was very likely to be able to kill him.

But why didn’t Ding Shaoyao attack?

The Sovereign of Sky was quite puzzled, but he didn’t give it further thought and left with the others.

Once the Sovereign of Sky left, Ding Shaoyao spoke indifferently, “Show yourself!”

It only took a moment for a woman in a dark violet dress to appear not too far away from Ding Shaoyao.

Ding Shaoyao glanced at the woman, and the latter grinned, “The show today was truly exciting!”

Ding Shaoyao said, “The Nether Pavilion!”

The woman nodded, “Yes!”

Ding Shaoyao stated, “You want the Sprite Lord too!”

The woman replied with a question, “Who doesn’t?”

Ding Shaoyao asked, “Are you confident in being able to deal with the armless man?”

The woman smiled, “Not completely, but if worse comes to worse, we have to fight him even if we aren’t confident. Isn’t it the same for your god race? However, I’m really curious. You seem to be quite close to Yang Ye. How will you face him when the time comes?”

Ding Shaoyao fell silent.

The woman continued, “This question is a dilemma for the great strategist, huh? Haha…”

Ding Shaoyao glanced at her, “Those ten women of your Nether Pavilion have gone through life and death with him. Aren’t you afraid they’ll turn their backs on you if you target him?”

“That’s why it’s a headache!” The woman walked over to Ding Shaoyao, “Needless to say, Yang Ye’s luck with women is really good. I know those girls from my Nether Pavilion really well, and he’s really extraordinary to be able to gain their acknowledgement.”

Ding Shaoyao didn’t want to linger on this topic, “What do you think about my god race and your Nether Pavilion?”

“We can remain at peace for now!” The woman smiled, “What do you think?”

Ding Shaoyao nodded, “Alright!”

As soon as she finished speaking, he led the Sages of the god race away.

“Can you tell me about something?” Suddenly, the woman asked, “Has your god race’s Patriarch Shi Tian woken up yet?”

Ding Shaoyao’s figure trembled slightly, “Go figure!”

.

A smile curled up on the corners of the woman’s mouth, and she didn’t say anything.

Ding Shaoyao didn’t say anything either. She was about to leave with the other Sages when a middle aged man suddenly appeared not too far away from them. It was where Yang Ye had been. The middle aged man wore a cloud white robe, his figure was ramrod straight, and he had an indescribable bearing. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The woman frowned slightly when she saw him while Ding Shaoyao’s gaze descended upon him. There was a trace of solemnness in Ding Shaoyao’s eyes.

The middle aged man ignored them. He just glanced at the surroundings and nodded slightly, “Not bad indeed.”

Meanwhile, the woman from the Nether Pavilion asked, “Who are you?”

The middle aged man gazed at her, “You want the Sprite Lord?”

The woman replied, “Yes!”

The middle aged man shook his head, “Weak. If you’re strong, you would have no need for anything else even if this world collapses.”

The woman’s eyes narrowed slightly, and a ray of cold light flashed within them.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man turned around to leave.

Suddenly, the woman stretched out her right hand and twisted it slightly. In an instant, a black palm that emanated dense black energy emerged from behind the middle aged man, and then it clawed down with the intent to crush the man’s head. However, the black palm had vanished soundlessly before it could even approach him.

The woman’s pupils constricted from the sight of this, and she took two steps back, “Impossible!”

Ding Shaoyao’s face was covered in shock as well!

Who was that woman?

Others may not know her identity, but Ding Shaoyao had a guess.

It could be said that she was one of the supreme experts in this world. Even the progenitors wouldn’t dare to say that they could defeat her! But the middle aged man before them…

Meanwhile, the middle aged man glanced at the woman, “You’re so weak that I don’t even feel like attacking you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot.

The woman had a blank expression on her face.

Ding Shaoyao was astounded as well, and her feelings right now were indescribable with words.

When the middle aged man took that step, he’d appeared in the prehistoric ruins.

Just one step!

The middle aged man appeared out of thin air in the hall that Yang Ye had once been in, and the casket was still there.

Meanwhile, a voice came from within the casket, “Who are you?”

The middle aged man walked over to the casket and said, “Interesting.”

Suddenly, a phantom floated out from the casket, and it looked down at the middle aged man. Suddenly, the middle aged man slowly clenched his right hand. In an instant, the entire hall suddenly turned ethereal.

An exclaim of shock resounded in the hall, “You…”

Some time passed before the middle aged man left the hall. There was a huge beast in front of him. The middle aged man glanced at the beast, and the latter moved backward.

A moment later, he vanished.

The casket in the hall had cracked into pieces.

The phantom stared in the direction that the middle aged man had left toward, “That’s impossible…”

…

Yang Ye and An Nanjing were famous after the battle outside the endless black holes. At this moment, the people of the large universe knew another name, and it was An Nanjing! Their deeds before the endless black holes could be said to have shocked the entire large universe.

They’d jointly killed over a dozen Sages!

And a few had been killed in an instant!

Such strength and natural talent was horrifying!

This time, the Alliance of All could be said to have suffered a severe blow to its strength. After all, it had lost so many Sages, and some of them were even the patriarchs of the various races. While it wasn’t to the extent of causing serious harm to the Alliance of All’s overall strength, it was still an extremely painful loss. Besides that, the Buddhist Path’s losses could be said to be extremely huge too. It had lost numerous Sages in a short while, and all of them were the extraordinary experts of the Buddhist Path.

In short, the human race had achieved a great victory, and the Alliance of Hall had called back all their forces. Presently, the Human Dimension was free again.

Something worth mentioning was that the traitor of the human race, Yang Ye, had become a hero of the human race now. Because the Alliance of All had called back their forces because of Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s strength. Moreover, there was no need to say how much pride and glory they brought the human race from that slaughter outside the endless black holes.

Who in the large universe dared to bully the human race now?

Nature Sacred Ground.

Yang Ye was lying on his bed, and An Nanjing was by his side.

His eyes were closed, and the Primordial Violet Energy within him was madly repairing his body.

An Nanjing just gazed silently at him.

A long time passed before a middle aged man in a cloud white robe appeared in the room.

An Nanjing turned around, and the middle aged man glanced at her. She was about to attack when a speck of cold light pressed against her forehead.

An Nanjing was shocked. However, she didn’t just give up. A wave of terrifying aura swept out from within her. However, it vanished without a trace as soon as it left her body!

An Nanjing was about to try something else when the middle aged man suddenly said, “Calm down, I have no ill intent. If I did have ill intent, no one can stop me!”

“Is that so?” Suddenly, a clear and melodious voice resounded.
