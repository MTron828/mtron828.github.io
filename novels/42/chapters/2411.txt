Chapter 2412 – No One is Allowed to Touch Her!

Snowy gazed at An Nanjing and blinked to display that she was very good.

An Nanjing grinned, and then she looked up at the sky. She tightened her grip on the spear and was about to attack when Sword Scroll spoke abruptly, “Let me do it!”

An Nanjing gazed at Sword Scroll, and the latter waved her right hand. In an instant, the Primordial Pagoda suddenly left Yang Ye and shot up from deep underground and descended into Sword Scroll’s grasp.

As she gazed at it, she closed her eyes slowly, fell silent for a moment, and then a ray of powerful sword energy swept out from within the pagoda.

In an instant, an ear-piercing sword howl resounded through the sky.

Along with it, a sword shot up into the air and appeared in the clouds.

In the Primordial Pagoda, the Sky Sword Platform had started to tremble violently.

Suddenly, Sword Scroll opened her eyes, and then she raised her hands slightly, “Appear!”

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

As soon as she gave the command, the entire sky was instantly covered in rays of sword energy. It was like a net that enveloped the entire sky above the Sword Ruins.

Along with the appearance of the rays of light, countless powerful auras immediately slammed against the sword energy like sledgehammers.

The Sky Sword Platform!

Sword Scroll gazed indifferently at the sky.

Obstruction!

She was very well aware that the sword formation couldn’t annihilate them, and she was just obstructing them and buying Yang Ye time.

Yang Ye needed time right now.

Around 10 minutes later, a wave of powerful pressure suddenly appeared in the sky, and then a huge fist suddenly shot up from below and slammed against the rays of sword energy.

Boom!

The entire sky shook violently, and then countless rays of sword energy exploded apart!Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

A long-haired man in gray robes was walking through the sky from afar. His gaze was focused on Snowy, and there was a playful smile on his face.

Sword Scroll’s eyes narrowed slightly. She was about to speak when An Nanjing suddenly said, “Let me do it!”

Sword Scroll glanced at An Nanjing, nodded, and moved aside.

Snowy appeared on Sword Scroll’s shoulder, glanced at the mirror in her grasp, and felt quite helpless.

She was really amazing too!

Sword Scroll glanced at Snowy, shook her head and smiled.

What a mischievous little fellow!

Meanwhile, the long-haired man had arrived before An Nanjing and the others. He moved his gaze from Snowy and looked at An Nanjing with a smile on his face, “I’m not here for Yang Ye, and my only objective is the Sprite Progenitor. Give it to me, and I’ll leave right now. Alright?”

An Nanjing glanced at the long-haired man, and then her spear suddenly shot forward.

A smile curled up on the corners of his mouth, “Do all the people of Eternal Border overestimate themselves like you?”

He slammed his palm forward once he finished speaking.

Bam!

The spear stabbed against his palm. However, his palm remained completely unharmed. An Nanjing’s spear had been stopped by his palm, just like that.

The man glanced at the spear, and then he frowned slightly. He was about to speak when An Nanjing suddenly appeared in front of him, and then she kicked the spear.

Bang!

The man was instantly blasted 3km away!

An Nanjing stretched out her right hand and grabbed the spear, and then she hurled it.

Hiss!

The spear tore through everything in its path.

The man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he took a step back with his right foot before slamming a punch forward!

Bang!

It blasted An Nanjing’s spear away!

Meanwhile, the man said, “Why do you possess a Spear of Obliteration from my desolate race?!”

An Nanjing’s spear was a type of weapon that belonged to the desolate race. Since the ancient times, even their race hadn’t been able to forge many of these spears. If they didn’t possess a mine with mysterious ore, even they wouldn’t have been able to forge even one of these spears!

An Nanjing didn’t answer him. She just stomped her right foot down and shot forward.

An instant later, a wave of powerful energy tore through everything in front of the man.

A wisp of killing intent flashed through his eyes, and then a pitch black hook appeared in his grasp. A moment after that, he swung it forward.

Hiss!

The space in a huge area instantly cracked open before it.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then both An Nanjing and the man were pushed backward.

An Nanjing was pushed all the way back to the mountaintop, and then she glanced at the long-haired man while she slowly clenched her right fist.

Snowy glanced at An Nanjing, blinked, and then moved closer to Sword Scroll.

She knew that An Nanjing was definitely furious.

At this moment, she absolutely couldn’t offend An Nanjing! Otherwise, An Nanjing would smack her on the butt! Only three people dares to smack her butt. One of them was An Nanjing, the other was Zi’er, and the last was Yang Ye.

An Nanjing suddenly vanished on the spot.

The long-haired man reacted like he was facing a formidable enemy!

He suddenly looked up, and then he swung the hook forward.

Crack!

The space in a huge area around him exploded apart, and a powerful wave of energy surged out like a tornado from within the pitch black expanse of space!

At this moment, the gazes of everyone here converged on the expanse of pitch black space.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Explosions resounded incessantly from there.

On the mountaintop, Sword Scroll stared at that expanse of pitch black space. At this moment, An Nanjing was like an invincible god of war there, a true god of war. Her imposing aura was at a terrifying level!

It was an imposing aura that even some Four World Realm experts couldn’t possess!

The long-haired man was instantly suppressed before her powerful aura. The aura and pressure coming from him weren’t weak, but they were too, too inferior when compared to An Nanjing!

Even Yang Ye couldn’t compete with her when it came to the strength of their auras!

Jian You spoke abruptly, “She’s strong!”

Sword Scroll nodded, “She’s very strong. If she survives, her name will definitely go down in history.”

Jian You spoke softly, “Yang Ye is lucky to have her!”

Sword Scroll nodded and looked up at the expanse of pitch black space.

An Nanjing held her spear with both hands and slammed it at the man.

The imposing aura this attack carried could make the entire world collapse!

Bang!

A rumbling explosion resounded from within the pitch black expanse of space, and then the long-haired man was blasted away.

At the same time, the long-haired man’s arm, which was holding the hook, flew up into the air.

Snowy’s eyes lit up when she saw this, and then she grabbed at it from afar.

Hiss!

The hook trembled, and then it struggled free from the hand and instantly appeared before Snowy. Snowy grabbed it, and placed it behind her while blinking rapidly. She seemed like she was trying to hide the fact that she’d taken it.

Sword Scroll and Jian You exchanged glances, and then they shook their heads and smiled. They felt the little fellow was truly too cute!

After pushing the man back, she was about to follow up with another attack, but a gray robed old man suddenly appeared in front of the long-haired man. An instant later, a wave of powerful energy surged out like a torrent at An Nanjing!

An Nanjing frowned slightly, and then her spear left her grasp.

Bang!

The pitch black expanse of space shook violently, and then the entire surroundings shook while An Nanjing returned to the mountaintop.

There was a wisp of blood on the corner of her mouth.

Sword Scroll asked, “A Four World Realm expert?”

An Nanjing shook her head. The old man wasn’t a Four World Realm expert, and he was just at the peak of the Three World Realm. However, he possessed the strength of a Four World Realm expert because that attack had the strength to destroy four worlds!

The old man glanced at this palm, and there was a bloody hole there. It had been pierced by An Nanjing’s spear just now.

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he was very shocked as he looked up at An Nanjing.

He was halfway into the Four World Realm, or it should be said that he had a 50% chance of winning even against a Four World Realm expert. However, he’d been injured by the woman who was only at the Limitbreaker Realm!

He hadn’t had any advantage in that collision.

He knew her natural talent wasn’t inferior to anyone in his own race!

The old man restrained his thoughts and glanced at the long-haired man behind him, “Third Prince, are you alright?”

The long-haired man shook his head slightly, “It’s nothing serious!”

The old man nodded, and then he gazed at An Nanjing, “You’re an extraordinary genius. If you leave, you’ll have a pretty good future; but if you refuse to act sensibly and stay, then I’m afraid you won’t live to see tomorrow.”

An Nanjing glanced at Snowy, and the latter cracked a smile. After that, she looked back at the old man, “No one is allowed to touch her!”

Snowy was Yang Ye’s reverse scale, so Snowy was her reverse scale too!

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “If that’s the case, then we’ll have to see how strong you are.”

As he spoke, he looked up at the sky, “Everyone hiding in the shadows, the two of us do not know you, but our objectives are the same. If you continue watching, it’s this woman and Yang Ye who will benefit in the end. Now that Yang Ye isn’t able to show himself, we should join forces and kill her. What do you think?”

A moment of silence ensued, and then a voice resounded, “Alright!”

In an instant, almost 20 powerful auras and pressures enveloped the mountaintop and An Nanjing!

Three World Realm experts, all of them were Three World Realm experts!

Some were even on the verge of being comparable to Four World Realm experts!

Meanwhile, An Nanjing closed her eyes slowly, and a moment of silence ensued before she spoke abruptly, “Bring it!”

As soon as she said that…
