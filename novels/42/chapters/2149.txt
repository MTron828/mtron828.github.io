Chapter 2150 – I Think He’s Very Weak!

Dao Qing’s expression was quite solemn as he stood before Yang Ye and An Nanjing, “So, we must act as soon as possible!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I have something to deal with. I’ll head over once I’m done.”

Dao Qing hesitated for a moment and seemed to want to say something, but he didn’t say anything in the end.

The person who stood before him wasn’t someone who would give him face.

Yang Ye didn’t say anything else to Dao Qing, and he just left with An Nanjing.

Void Spirit Continent!

Since he’d benefitted from the middle aged man in the room of the Slaughter Dao and promised to help the man, he naturally had to do it.

Yang Ye shot through the starry sky on his sword. Presently, he was traveling openly. He wasn’t afraid that the Alliance of All would attack him. If they were smart, they wouldn’t send Sages after him. Because Sages couldn’t do anything to him now!

A day later, Yang Ye arrived at Void Spirit Continent.

With Yang Lianshuang’s help, it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to find out Qian Ying’s rough location. He really did admire Yang Lianshuang’s ability when it came to things like this. Her organization had really developed quite nicely.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive at an ancient city called Dark Sky City.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and entered it. Qian Ying was last seen in this city. However, Yang Lianshuang didn’t know her exact location and only knew a rough location.

So, he still had to search for himself!

Once he entered the city, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and went to the most bustling place in the city.

Dragon Tavern!

Actually, it was a place of entertainment. There were quite a few establishments like this throughout the continent. After all, some cultivators were still fond of enjoying life, and not everyone just cultivated all day. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

As soon as he entered the tavern, a pretty girl immediately came to greet Yang Ye.

She smiled, “May I know what you’d like to have?”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “I’m looking for someone!”

“You’re looking for someone?” She glanced at him, “I’m afraid you’ve come to the wrong place. Dragon Tavern…”

Yang Ye suddenly said, “I want to see your boss!”

At this moment, the smile on her face had vanished. Meanwhile, Yang Ye flicked a spatial ring to her. She hesitated for a moment, glanced at it, and then a solemn expression appeared on her face.

300 immortal crystals!

It wasn’t a small amount!

She revealed a slightly respectful smile and said, “Please wait a moment.” She took the ring and left.

A short while later, a beautiful woman arrived before Yang Ye, and the pretty girl was beside her.

The woman sized up Yang Ye and smiled, “I’m Yan Bi, please come with me!”

Yang Ye shrugged. As he’d expected, there were two things in this world that could solve problems. Money and strength!

Yang Ye followed her into a luxurious room, and she said, “Please have a seat!”

Yang Ye sat down, and the pretty girl poured him a cup of tea.

Yang Ye didn’t drink the tea. He just gazed at the woman, “I’ll get straight to the point. I’m here to look for someone. If you can help me find that person, or if you know that person’s whereabouts, then we can discuss a suitable price.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and grinned, “Is that so?”

Yang Ye withdrew a spatial ring and placed it on the table. There were almost 10,000 immortal crystals in it.

Yang Ye said, “I’m very sincere! I don’t have time to waste here, so if you can help me, we can discuss a good price for the information.” Perhaps immortal crystals were very precious to others, but they weren’t that precious to Yang Ye.

He had over a million with him, and all of them had come from the experts he’d plundered!

The beautiful woman glanced at the spatial ring and gazed at Yang Ye, “Who are you looking for?”

“Qian Ying!” Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “I’m looking for her!”

Qian Ying!

The expressions of both the beautiful woman and the pretty girl changed when they heard that name. After that, the beautiful woman pushed away Yang Ye’s spatial ring, “Sorry, I don’t know, and I don’t know that person. Please leave!”

She turned around and intended to walk away once she finished speaking.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Can’t we discuss this?”

The woman stopped, “There’s nothing to discuss!” She started walking away once she finished speaking.

Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “I counted earlier. There are six Major Zen Realm experts around this room. I think it’ll take me less than a breath of time to kill them!”

Yan Bi suddenly turned around and gazed at Yang Ye. Yang Ye just sat there with indifference on his face, and he seemed absolutely carefree.

She gazed at him for a long time before she said, “You may be young, but you talk big.”

As soon as she finished speaking, an old man suddenly appeared in the room. However, as soon as he did, a sword suddenly pressed against his forehead.

The old man was stunned!

He wasn’t the only one. Yan Bi and the pretty girl were stunned too.

Yang Ye didn’t say anything. He just picked up the teacup, took a sip, and gazed at Yan Bi, “Your tea isn’t bad!”

She gazed at him for a long time. In the end, she sat down again and waved her right hand slightly. She was telling the old man to leave. But the old man didn’t dare to move because that sword was still pressed against his forehead!

Just the slightest mistake may cause a bloody hole to be pierced into his head!

Suddenly, the sword transformed into a ray of light that shot over to Yang Ye’s side and just floated there quietly.

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and left.

Yan Bi suddenly said, “You’re very strong!”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “Let’s get back to business. I don’t have time to waste here.”

She fell silent for a moment and said, “I’ve heard of Qian Ying, but I don’t know her. She’s an assassin in our continent, an extremely formidable assassin. Have you heard of the Blood Death Hall?”

“Blood Death Hall?” Yang Ye frowned, “No!”

She glanced at him and asked, “You’re not from this continent?”

Yang Ye nodded.

“No wonder!” She spoke softly, “Blood Death Hall is the most mysterious assassin organization in the continent, and it was formed by Qian Ying. However, we like to call her Ying the Asura. She’s the number one assassin of this continent who instills fear in others from just a mention of her name. While Dragon Tavern does possess some strength, we dare not offend her at all. As for you…” She glanced at him and spoke softly, “Are you here to look for trouble with her?”

Trouble? Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he shook his head, “No, I’m here to send her a message. Do you know how I can find her? I’ve received word that she’s here in Dark Sky City!”

“She’s here?” Yan Bi was surprised, “Are you sure?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Yan Bi’s face became quite solemn.

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

She replied softly, “I’m afraid someone is going to die!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Yan Bi said, “If you’re looking for her, I do have a way for you to find her. You can go to the Dark Hall in the city. It’s a place where Blood Death Hall accepts assignments. You may be able to find her through them.”

“I see!” Yang Ye nodded, stood up, and started walking out.

Meanwhile, Yan Bi said, “Your spatial ring!”

“Keep it as your payment!” Yang Ye didn’t even look back as he continued forward.

Once Yang Ye left, Yan Bi heaved a sigh of relief. Meanwhile, the old man from before appeared here once more. Yan Bi gazed at the old man, and the latter spoke solemnly, “He’s extremely strong. We absolutely can’t afford to offend him!”

Yan Bi nodded, “Blood Death Hall is probably in trouble now!”

“That may not necessarily be the case!” The old man continued, “Qian Ying isn’t easy to deal with at all!”

Qian Ying!

A solemn expression appeared in Yan Bi’s eyes. That name was an extremely powerful name in this continent!

…

After he left the tavern, Yang Ye inquired from some others and located Dark Hall. The so-called Dark Hall was just a pavilion, a pavilion with two levels. There was a reclined chair outside it, and an old man was lying there.

Yang Ye walked over, and the old man opened his eyes and glanced at Yang Ye, “Who do you want to kill?”

Who do I want to kill? Yang Ye glanced at the old man and asked, “Can you kill anyone?”

“It depends!” The old man spoke indifferently, “It depends on whether you can afford the price. If you pay enough, then we can kill anyone in Void Spirit Continent!”

Yang Ye asked, “What about outside the continent?”

The old man replied, “If you want us to kill the ancestors of the three paths, then I’m afraid that’s impossible!”

Yang Ye grinned, “Not them. Have you heard of Yang Ye?”

“Yang Ye?” The old man suddenly stood up, walked over to Yang Ye, and sized him up, “You want to kill Yang Ye?”

Yang Ye replied with a question, “Can’t I?”

The old man frowned and remained silent.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “The price can be discussed. But I wonder if you’ll accept this job?”

The old man hesitated for a moment and was about to refuse.

Yang Ye!

He’d naturally heard of Yang Ye. Presently, everyone in the large universe had heard of Yang Ye. He was someone who’d killed the Sovereign of Man in an instant! Even Sages weren’t enough to face him!

While Blood Death Hall was very strong, it clearly wouldn’t offend Yang Ye!

The old man shook his head, “We won’t accept it!”

“He’s just a Major Zen Realm cultivator, yet you actually refuse to kill him?” Yang Ye was astounded, “Aren’t you very amazing? Didn’t you kill a Sage in the past? Yet you dare not assassinate a Major Zen Realm cultivator? Y-You really disappoint me. You…”

“Are you an idiot?” Meanwhile, the old man suddenly cursed, “Yang Ye is just a Major Zen Realm cultivator? He could even kill the Sovereign of Man in an instant, yet you say he’s only a Major Zen Realm cultivator? He’s a fucking freak! A huge fucking freak! Understand?”

Yang Ye said, “I think he’s really weak!”

“Weak?” The old man laughed with ridicule, “You should take a look at yourself in the mirror. Who are you to say Yang Ye is weak? That’s the funniest joke I’ve ever heard!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
