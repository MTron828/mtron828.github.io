Chapter 2294 – Back to Initial City!

Sword Scroll glanced at her body, and her face instantly turned unsightly.

Just one attack!

Just a single attack from Yang Ye had almost obliterated her!

She was furious and terrified!

Sword Scroll gazed at Yang Ye. Meanwhile, Yang Ye vanished and shot at her.

Her expression changed drastically at the sight of this!

How could she resist another attack from Yang Ye?

Suddenly, Snowy appeared in front of her, and Snowy just stared at Yang Ye. Unexpectedly, there was no fear in her eyes.

Trust!

She always trusted Yang Ye, even if he’d gone mad.

The sword energy stopped just half an inch away from Snowy’s head.

Sword Scroll visibly relaxed at the sight of this.

At this moment, Snowy gazed at Yang Ye, and then her tears started to flow out incessantly.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s face was covered in pain, or it should be said that he was visibly struggling. A short while passed before the sword energy descended a little more, and it was almost touching Snowy’s head.

Snowy still didn’t move away.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly shook his head forcefully, “Snowy… Snowy… No… No… Can’t kill… Not Snowy… No…”

As soon as he finished speaking, he howled with fury and vanished into the sky.

He’d vanished toward the direction of the Shiyuan Clan.

Snowy wanted to pursue him, but Sword Scroll stopped her. Snowy glared angrily at the latter, but Sword Scroll gazed at the Primordial Pagoda. She tapped it with a finger, and it shook before Su Qingshi and the others appeared here.

Snowy immediately shot into Su Qingshi’s arms when she saw her, and then she started crying.

At this moment, Su Qingshi’s face was covered in tears too.

Meanwhile, Sword Scroll spoke solemnly, “I know how you feel, but it’s best if you don’t go to him right now. He really doesn’t recognize anyone now!”

Su Qingshi shook her head, “I want to accompany her!”

Zi’er suddenly said, “Absolutely not!”

Everyone gazed at Zi’er.

She closed her eyes slowly and said, “Sister Qingshi, he’s in a huge amount of pain already. If we go to him, and he kills us… Just think how he would feel once he regains consciousness!”

Su Qingshi fell silent.

Zi’er spoke softly, “I too wish for nothing more than to be by his side, but we can’t do that right now. Our job is to protect ourselves for now, and wait for him to regain consciousness!”

“Will he?” Su Qingshi had quite a lost expression in her eyes. At this moment, she felt like she’d lost her support.

“Yes!” Sword Scroll spoke solemnly, “His slaughter intent and sword intent have been suppressed, so his madness intent has gained the upper hand. If they can turn the situation around, he’ll be able to recover.”

“He’s in a huge amount of danger right now!” Su Qingshi closed her eyes slowly, “Right?”

Sword Scroll glanced at her and said, “He’s not in danger now, others are. Didn’t you see? His intent is in the True Dao Realm! And while he has gone mad, his combat instinct and instinct toward danger are still intact. So, others will be truly in danger upon encountering him.”

Su Qingshi asked, “Is there no way to stop him?”

Sword Scroll thought for a moment and replied, “Yes, suppressing him with absolute strength, then trapping him. However, it requires strength that far surpasses his own, and anyone just slightly stronger than him would probably be killed instead. Only someone who far surpasses him in strength can accomplish it.”

She paused for a moment and said, “Let’s go to the Sword Ruins. Let’s see if she’s willing to help. But the chances are slim. Because she refuses to leave the Sword Ruins!”

Su Qingshi said, “Let’s give it a try!”

Sword Scroll nodded, and then she gazed at the Primordial Pagoda. Meanwhile, Snowy hugged the pagoda, and then she pointed at it and waved her claws.

She was saying that the pagoda belonged to Yang Ye!

Sword Scroll glanced at Snowy, “I won’t take his pagoda. Right, I’ll try my best to help him.”

Snowy glanced at Sword Scroll, and her gaze became gentler.

Sword Scroll heaved a sigh of relief in her heart because she knew the little fellow’s attitude toward her had finally grown a little better.

Snowy glanced at the direction Yang Ye had left toward while worry and reluctance filled her eyes.

While Yang Ye hadn’t attacked her, Yang Ye was truly terrifying just now, and she felt that he was even more terrifying than when he’d comprehended slaughter intent.

Meanwhile, Little Sky walked over to Snowy and took Snowy in her arms. She spoke softly, “Don’t worry, he’ll be fine. Let’s go wait for him at the Sword Ruins!”

Snowy glanced at Little Sky and started crying again.

“We can’t stay here!” Sword Scroll spoke abruptly, “We must get to the Sword Ruins as soon as possible. Otherwise, if those other powers are aware of our presence here, they will definitely act against you to blackmail Yang Ye!”

Su Qingshi took a deep and long glance at the direction Yang Ye had left toward, and she said, “Let’s go!”

They immediately entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Sword Scroll gazed at the Primordial Pagoda, fell silent for a moment, and then she vanished into the sky with the pagoda.

…

Initial Grounds. Initial City.

Along with Yang Ye’s departure, the Shiyuan Clan gradually calmed down once more. Yang Ye was a very unfamiliar face to the people of the Shiyuan Clan, and very few knew who he was.

Suddenly, a young man appeared outside Initial City.

The young man was in rags, and his hair was disheveled. As for his eye sockets, they were empty. The young man kept shaking his head while muttering something. He seemed just like a madman.

The slovenly man walked aimlessly toward the city, and he grew increasingly closer to the city.

Suddenly, a middle aged man appeared before Yang Ye. He sized up Yang Ye and asked, “Who are you?”

The slovenly man suddenly looked up, and then the middle aged man’s expression changed drastically!

Hiss! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The slovenly man had suddenly appeared behind the middle aged man, and then a head shot up into the air while accompanied by blood!

The slovenly man suddenly stretched out his hand and caught the bloody head. A moment later, he slammed it at the city.

Bang!

The head instantly exploded apart on the city walls.

“How dare you!” Suddenly, a furious shout resounded from within the city, and then a ray of silver light shot down from the sky.

It was extremely swift and instantly arrived above the slovenly man.

The slovenly man suddenly looked up, and then a strand of terrifying intent swept out from him.

Madness intent!

It was unprecedentedly powerful and instantly suppressed Yang Ye’s sword intent and slaughter intent. As soon as it appeared, it blasted apart the silver light.

At the same time, a spear had arrived before Yang Ye’s forehead!

However, it stopped just an inch away from him.

Because Yang Ye had grabbed the spear. At the other end of the spear, there was a middle aged man there, and it was Exalt Qin!

Exalt Qin’s expression changed slightly at the sight of the slovenly man, “Yang Ye! It’s you!”

Yang Ye looked up at Exalt Qin with a bewildered expression, and then he suddenly emanated powerful madness intent. An instant later, Yang Ye’s figure shot along the spear, causing Exalt Qin’s expression to change drastically. He tapped his right foot down and floated over 3km back.

However, a ray of sword energy flashed before him, and it was swift like a shooting star!

A moment later, a sword descended from above Exalt Qin.

The Sword Domain!

Yang Ye had utilized the Sword Domain again. While he didn’t have sword intent now, his madness intent was much stronger than his sword intent and slaughter intent.

The unique aspect of madness intent was that the crazier and more devilish a person was, the stronger that person would be!

Exalt Qin’s pupils constricted to the size of needles when he saw Yang Ye’s sword descend.

How powerful!

That was the only thought in his mind!

However, Exalt Qin didn’t just stand by idly. He bent his knees and stabbed his spear at Yang Ye.

A ray of silver light shot up into the air along with Exalt Qin.

However, the silver light instantly melted like snow in hot oil when it touched Yang Ye’s sword. The sword descended and sliced the spear into two.

Meanwhile, Exalt Qin had moved over 1km back. But he hadn’t even descended to the ground when Yang Ye’s sword had arrived above him.

It was still the Sword Domain combined with madness intent!

Exalt Qin’s pupils constricted once again from the sight of this. He didn’t have the time to think, and a strand of powerful aura immediately swept out from him. It formed a thick defensive barrier in front of him. However, how strong were Yang Ye’s attacks right now? The aura hadn’t even been able to stop Yang Ye’s sword, and it only took an instant for it to descend upon Exalt Qin’s head.

At the instant Yang Ye’s sword descended upon his head, Exalt Qin’s soul left his body and flashed off into the distance.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword descended.

Hiss!

Exalt Qin’s body was sliced into two!

Exalt Qin had an extremely unsightly expression as he floated far away. He hadn’t expected Yang Ye to return, and he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to be this strong. Moreover, the intent Yang Ye emanated was still growing stronger and stronger.

It had been growing incessantly since the battle began!

Yang Ye ignored Exalt Qin’s soul and just walked toward the city. Exalt Qin’s expression changed drastically at the sight of this and said, “Stop him!”

It only took a moment for two old men to appear in front of Yang Ye.

They were both True Dao Realm experts!

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was in front of them when he appeared again. An instant later, a ray of sword energy slammed down at them.

The Sword Domain!

The Sword Domain again!

Moreover, it wasn’t just the Sword Domain and madness intent, countless vengeful spirits had surged out of Yang Ye’s palm and converged incessantly on his sword.

The old men didn’t dare to act carelessly. Both of them clenched their fists and slammed them at Yang Ye.

Four fists surged through space!

However, at the instant Yang Ye’s sword descended, the old men were blasted away.

“Hehehe…” Countless vengeful spirits circled around Yang Ye.

If it was before this, Yang Ye’s slaughter intent and sword intent would have suppressed the vengeful spirits. Because they would affect his mind. However, Yang Ye’s mind wasn’t clear now, and it didn’t need them to affect him at all. So, his madness intent didn’t suppress them at all, and it even helped those vengeful spirits. It could be said that the vengeful spirits were fully released at this moment.

After he pushed the old men back, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of black light that entered the city.

Countless ferocious and hideous vengeful spirits followed behind him!

Exalt Qin was horrified by the sight of this and howled with fury, “Stop him! Hurry! Stop him now!”
