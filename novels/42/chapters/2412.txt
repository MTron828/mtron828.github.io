Chapter 2413 – Put Your Back Into It!Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Bang!

A black shadow shot up into the air from below while emanating a terrifying aura.

Roar!

A ferocious roar resounded through the sky!

The Martial Qilin!

It was the Martial Qilin which had shot up into the air. Once it appeared here, An Nanjing tapped her foot down and descended on its back. After that, she waved her right hand, and a spear descended into her grasp.

She looked up at the sky, and then stomped her right foot down.

Roar!

The Martial Qilin roared with fury and shot up into the air.

Suddenly, over 20 powerful auras swept down from above!

There were over 20 Three World Realm experts here now, and many were on the verge of attaining the Four World Realm. So, how terrifying was the aura and pressure they emanated?

Jian You fell silent for an instant. Suddenly, she grabbed her huge sword with both hands and shot up into the sky!

She was very well aware that no matter how monstrous An Nanjing was, it was impossible for An Nanjing to fight off over 20 extraordinary experts!

Only Snowy and Sword Scroll remained on the mountaintop.

Sword Scroll glanced at Snowy, “Are you afraid?”

Snowy blinked and quickly shook her head. Why would she be afraid? She was only a little afraid of An Nanjing and nothing else.

Sword Scroll nodded, and then she shot up into the sky.

She wasn’t worried about Snowy. After all, the little fellow had more trump cards than anyone else! So, instead of being worried about Snowy, it was better to worry about themselves!

Snowy glanced up into the sky, and then she tightened her grip on the mirror.

High above in the clouds.

As soon as Sword Scroll shot up there, around 10,000 swords shot up into the sky, and then they enveloped the entire area.

A sword formation!

A sword formation of 10,000 swords!

Above the clouds, in space, An Nanjing stood on the Martial Qilin’s back with her spear in hand, and a wave of powerful pressure and aura kept sweeping out of her. It was growing stronger and stronger, and it seemed to be endless!

Even then, she was still not strong enough to face over 20 Three World Realm experts.

She was being fully suppressed!

At this moment, An Nanjing, Sword Scroll, and Jian You were being completely suppressed. They were facing over 20 extraordinary experts, so they didn’t even have the strength to fight back and could only defend themselves. If An Nanjing’s imposing aura wasn’t too strong, they would have died by now!

Snowy looked up at the sky from the mountaintop, and there was a wisp of worry in her eyes.

While she was mischievous, she was no fool.

Obviously, An Nanjing and the others were no match for these fellows!

Snowy hesitated for a moment, looked down at the mountain below, and then she waved her paw lightly.

Bang!

A powerful aura suddenly shot up into the air, and then Oxxy appeared before her.

Oxxy wasn’t the only one. A few more powerful auras were behind him.

They were the Primal Vicious Tiger, the Primal True Dragon, and Erya who was still having a tanghulu!

Snowy pointed at the sky, and then gazed at Oxxy. She seemed to be asking if they were confident in their chances!

Oxxy glanced at the sky, and then he shot up into the air with the Primordial Axe of Creation in his grasp.

As soon as Oxxy charged up into the air, the Primal Vicious Tiger and Primal True Dragon refused to display any weakness and did the same.

Besides Oxxy, the Primal True Dragon and Primal Vicious Tiger were peak Two World Realm demons. However, they were true Primal Demons. They could be described as being on par with humans at the Three World Realm!

Ordinary Primal Demons wouldn’t be comparable to human Three World Realm experts, but both of them were no ordinary Primal Demons. Especially the Primal True Dragon. Its body was so strong then even Four World Realm experts wouldn’t find it easy to injure!

Besides Erya and Snowy, the Primal True Dragon had never feared anyone.

On the mountaintop, Snowy gazed at Erya, and the latter licked her tanghulu and said, “Big Brother Yang asked me to protect you because he still needs a little time.”

As she spoke, she passed the tanghulu to Snowy. Snowy licked it and looked up at the sky with a bit of worry in them.

Meanwhile, Erya spoke softly, “Don’t worry, they have great endurance, so they’ll last for a long time!”

Snowy was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, in the sky above.

Oxxy was the first to arrive there. He nodded slightly to An Nanjing, and then he took the axe in both hands and charged at the closed Three World Realm expert.

Everywhere the axe passed as he swung it, space collapsed in an instant!

The Three World Realm expert before Oxxy had an extremely solemn expression on his face, and he didn’t dare act carelessly at all. His figure transformed into a ray of white light that charged at Oxxy.

Meanwhile, the Primal True Dragon had returned to its true form.

It blotted out the sky!

Once it returned to its true form, all the experts here couldn’t help but shoot a glance at it.

A dragon!

A Primal True Dragon from the Primal Era!

Such a demon could be said to be extinct in the current era.

So, they wondered where Yang Ye had found these Primal Demons!

The Primal True Dragon immediately slammed its body at one of the nearby experts upon returning to its true form. It simply seemed like it could obliterate the world.

That expert was horrified when the Primal True Dragon locked onto him, and he didn’t even have room to dodge. He could only use his Pseudo Divine Treasure, a gray armor. It immediately erupted with a ray of dazzling black light upon being activated, and the gray light completely enveloped the expert.

However, along with the impact from the Primal True Dragon’s body, the black light exploded apart, and the Pseudo Divine Treasure itself collapsed in an instant while his body was blasted away.

He was blasted over 10km away.

After it blasted that expert away, the Primal True Dragon didn’t follow up with another attack and swept its body in a different direction.

Hiss!

The entire sky exploded apart before it.

Overbearing!

The Primal True Dragon’s formidable physical strength horrified all the experts here.

Meanwhile, the Primal Vicious Tiger was extremely terrifying as well.

Viciousness!

The Primal Vicious Tiger was enveloped in a vicious aura, and it was fearless in battle.

In the sky, while the situation here hadn’t changed along with the arrival of the three Primal Demons, An Nanjing’s side was in a much better situation. At the very least, they weren’t being suppressed anymore.

On the mountaintop, Erya glanced at the sky and spoke indifferently, “Big Sister An is the most amazing. That stupid dragon is barely alright, and the little tiger and ox are a little weak. Those two fellows need to grow stronger or they’ll be eliminated!”

Snowy licked the tanghulu and nodded in agreement.

Erya suddenly took the tanghulu from Snowy and licked it before continuing, “Snowy, can I eat these fellows?”

Snowy was stunned, and then she looked up at the sky.

People can be eaten? Are they tasty?

Suddenly, a one-armed man and a gray robed old man suddenly appeared near them.

Erya glanced at them and said, “What do you want?”

The one-armed man gazed at Snowy and smiled, “This is the Sprite Progenitor? She’s so cute!”

Snowy blinked and gazed at Erya. The latter grinned, “Don’t be afraid, I’m very strong!”

The one-armed man gazed at her when he heard this and smiled, “Is that so? Little Sister, are you really very strong?”

Erya glanced at the old man behind the one-armed man. She didn’t say anything and just licked the tanghulu.

The one-armed man gazed at Snowy and smiled, “Are you going to come with me, or shall I take you by force?”

Snowy blinked, and then she patted Erya on the shoulder. Erya nodded, and then she appeared in front of the one-armed man before a tombstone slammed down at him.

As soon as that happened, horror filled the man’s heart!

At this moment, his hairs were standing on end. Danger, lethal danger.

At the critical moment, a hand suddenly grabbed him, and then he vanished on the spot to be replaced by the gray robed old man instead. The gray robed old man raised his palm and slammed it at the tombstone.

Boom!

As soon as his palm touched the tombstone, the old man’s expression changed drastically. An instant later, his palm cracked open and blood sprayed!

At the same time, his figure was blasted backward!

As soon as he stopped himself, the old man’s expression changed drastically once more, “Don’t you dare!”

He was about to attack when a shrill cry resounded from afar, and then the old man didn’t dare to make another move.

It was because the one-armed man was on the ground, and a tombstone was above him.

Erya glanced at the man, and then she gazed at Snowy, “Snowy, have you killed?”

Snowy shook her head.

Erya blinked, “Why don’t you try? It’s really fun!”

“Fun?” Snowy blinked, and then she gazed at the one-armed man and hesitated slightly.

Meanwhile, Erya suddenly withdrew a dagger and passed it to Snowy, “Go on, kill him. Just aim at his throat and stab down. He’ll scream, and then his body will twitch. After that, he’ll be dead.”

Snowy was stunned.

Meanwhile, the old man stared at Erya, “Who are you?!”

Erya ignored the old man and pushed the dagger into Snowy’s grasp, “Go on, kill him.”

Snowy glanced at the dagger, glanced at the one-armed man, and then leaped over to the man. After that, she covered her eyes with one paw, and stabbed the dagger at the man’s throat with the other paw.

“Yaaa…” Along with a loud shout, Snowy shuddered and stabbed the dagger down at random.

A short while later, she moved her left paw away from her eyes and glanced at the one-armed man. At this moment, the man was still looking at her, and he wasn’t dead.

Meanwhile, Erya spoke in a displeased tone, “Snowy, can’t you use a little more strength? Put your back into it!”

Snowy blinked, hesitated for a moment, and then she covered the man’s eyes with her paw. After that, she raised the dagger in her right pawn and stabbed it down forcefully…
