Chapter 1566 - Devil Race! I Mourn For You!

Translator: InVader

Actually, it wouldn’t even take five years. Because if they didn’t join forces against him, then they wouldn’t be able to stop Yang Ye at all.

Even though Yang Ye was just a Deity, his strength wasn’t inferior to a Rebirth Realm expert. Coupled with the Stellar Sword Diagram, the dual intents, and the mysterious flames he possessed. Yang Ye could be said to be on the verge of being invincible.

The atmosphere in the hall became quite heavy.

Suddenly, Gu Mo stepped forward, “Everyone, there’s something I don’t understand. The human race says that the power supporting Yang Ye is the Nether Pavilion, but I feel that there’s something strange about it!”

The patriarch of the Heavenly Dragon Clan, Gu Tian, frowned, “What do you mean?”

Gu Mo explained, “Just think about it. Why did those two mysterious experts only kill demon beasts at the Dualism Realm and below upon coming to our Demon Territory? If it was the Nether Pavilion, they would have slaughtered our Rebirth Realm experts. No, that’s not right either. If it was the Nether Pavilion, based on their style and strength, they would have gone to the Divine Phoenix Clan. Based on the strength they’ve revealed, they are entirely capable of saving Yang Ye. However, they didn’t do that, and they slaughtered others instead!”

Gu Tian remained silent for a long time before he said, “You’re trying to say that someone is framing Yang Ye and the Nether Pavilion?”

Gu Mo spoke solemnly, “All those years ago, the Nether Pavilion was forced down to the lower dimensions, and that was internal strife within the human race. Now, it has returned. Based on the way they do things, they will definitely kill their way up here. If I’m not wrong, the human race wants to drag us into their battle with the Nether Pavilion.”

The others frowned when they heard Gu Mo.

The joint forces of the entire demon race didn’t fear the Nether Pavilion, but it wasn’t willing to fight the Nether Pavilion to the death. Even if the joint forces of those ten women couldn’t destroy the demon race, it was absolutely capable of crippling the demon race.

Meanwhile, Gu Tian suddenly said, “Brother Gu Mo, I think that makes sense. Once those mysterious experts killed in our territory, the Human Alliance suddenly announced that it had nothing to do with them, and they even immediately sent experts to help us. Now that I think carefully about it, it seems very strange.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Gu Mo nodded, “Based on my investigation, Yang Ye’s relationship with the Nether Pavilion is very good indeed. It’s very likely that the human race wants to use Yang Ye to draw the Nether Pavilion out, and then use us to fight them. That’s like killing two birds with one stone!”

When he spoke up to this point, Gu Mo glanced at everyone here and continued, “We absolutely can’t get involved in the war with the Nether Pavilion. I’m sure all of you know about the Nether Pavilion. They definitely intend to take revenge. If we go against them, they’ll definitely attack us madly. At that time, our demon race won’t be able to stop them unless the Demon God helps us!”

Gu Tian nodded, “We can’t allow ourselves to be used by the human race!”

Meanwhile, someone suddenly asked, “Then what should we do about Yang Ye?”

Yang Ye!

Silence filled the area once more.

Suddenly, Mo Jiang said, “My Divine Phoenix Clan won’t stop until one of us is dead!”

Meanwhile, Gu Mo said, “All of you may not be aware of it but the Demon God has given his inner core to Yang Ye.”

The expressions of everyone here changed when they heard Gu Mo. It was especially so for Mo Jiang. He stared at Gu Mo and asked, “Why? Why did the Demon God do that?!”

Gu Mo replied, “The Demon God thinks highly of his potential, but I never expected… Alas!”

The others exchanged glances. They hadn’t expected that Yang Ye would have obtained the Demon God’s inner core.

Meanwhile, Gu Mo added, “Yang Ye can be considered to be half a member of our demon race.”

Mo Jiang gazed at Gu Mo, “What are you trying to say?!”

Gu Mo glanced at Mo Jiang and said, “Mo Jiang, your clan has less than 3,000 members left, but Yang Ye is still alive. Let me ask you something, do you really intend to lead your clan to extinction?”

Mo Jiang spoke ferociously, “Are you telling me that my Divine Phoenix Clan shouldn’t take revenge?”

“Take revenge?” Gu Mo continued, “Let me ask you something. How will you do that? Can you Divine Phoenix Clan afford to fight him to the death? He has no ties in the large world. If he can’t win a battle, he can just run, and then come back to fight another day. Your clan will be exhausted to death!”

“He has no ties here, but what about lower dimensions?” Mo Jiang spoke fiercely, “My clan can head to the lower dimensions. We…”

“Do you want to die?” Gu Mo spoke angrily, “The lower dimensions? The Nether Pavilion is there. What can you do there? You can’t do anything! All you can do is give your life away!”

Meanwhile, Gu Tian spoke abruptly, “Brother Mo Jiang, allow me to say a few words. Your Divine Phoenix Clan really can’t afford to suffer further losses. If this continues, your clan will be annihilated. Presently, you still have a chance because most of your Rebirth Realm experts are still alive, so your clan still has hope. But if this continues…”

Mo Jian clenched his fists slowly. He wasn’t willing to accept it, he really wasn’t! He truly wasn’t willing to give up on taking revenge! However, reason told him that the Divine Phoenix Clan really couldn’t afford to continue fighting Yang Ye to the death!

“AH!!” Suddenly, a shrill cry resounded on Demon God Mountain.

The expressions of everyone within the hall changed, and then they vanished on the spot.

There was a corpse on the mountainside, and it was the corpse of a phoenix.

A savage expression instantly covered Mo Jiang’s face. Obviously, it was Yang Ye’s doing.

Yang Ye was back!

All of them revealed quite solemn expressions on their faces. They were extremely fearful of him. None of their clans could endure the might of Yang Ye’s Stellar Sword Diagram and that mysterious flame!

Meanwhile, Gu Mo suddenly turned to look at Mo Jiang who had a gloomy expression on his face. Gu Mo said, “Mo Jiang, I’ll only ask you once. Do you want to fight Yang Ye to the death, or do you want your Divine Phoenix Clan to survive?”

Mo Jiang fell silent for a long time, and then he said, “Even if my Divine Phoenix Clan is willing to stop, will Yang Ye be willing to do so as well?”

Gu Mo asked, “His friend’s consciousness is in Mo Xiaoleng’s possession?”

Mo Jiang nodded.

Gu Mo asked, “Where’s she right now?”

Mo Jiang spoke in a low voice, “The Devil Territory.”

“Tell her to bring it back right now!” Gu Mo spoke solemnly, “Immediately!”

Mo Jiang fell silent. If he made Mo Xiaoleng bring the consciousness back, it would represent that the Divine Phoenix Clan was submitting.

Meanwhile, Gu Tian spoke abruptly, “Mo Jiang, if you still refuse to submit at a time like this, then it’ll be the end of your Divine Phoenix Clan.”

Mo Jiang glanced at the others. At this moment, how could he not understand that Gu Mo and the others weren’t willing to fight Yang Ye to the death for his Divine Phoenix Clan.

They had no need to fear Yang Ye with the joint forces they possessed, but they couldn’t afford to fight him to the death! For example, if Yang Ye utilized the Stellar Sword Diagram and that mysterious flame at Demon God Mountain, then the mountain would definitely vanish from the face of the continent.

Yang Ye dared to fight them to the death, but they didn’t dare to fight Yang Ye to the death. Or it should be said that it wasn’t worth it to do so. At the very least, it wasn’t worth it to do so for the Divine Phoenix Clan’s sake.

Actually, after they found out that Yang Ye had obtained the Demon God’s inner core, their attitude towards the situation had changed slightly. Of course, the main reason was still Yang Ye’s strength.

A long time passed before Mo Jiang gazed at an elder of the Divine Phoenix Clan and said, “Tell Xiaoleng to come back immediately, and remind her to bring that fellow, Snowy’s, consciousness with her!”

The old man nodded and left.

Gu Mo glanced at Mo Jiang, and then he glanced at the surroundings, “Yang Ye, show yourself. The Divine Phoenix Clan is willing to return your friend’s consciousness to you!”

He received no reply.

Gu Mo fell silent for a moment, and then he said, “I guarantee that we won’t attack you. We might have been used. So, we won’t act against you again.”

The space in front of them suddenly rippled, and then Yang Ye appeared within their fields of vision.

Yang Ye!

Everyone from the Divine Phoenix Clan gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at Mo Jiang and said, “Snowy’s consciousness isn’t gone?”

Mo Jiang spoke in a low voice, “Yes!”

Yang Ye slowly closed his eyes. Quite some time passed before he opened them and gazed at Mo Jiang, “What about Zi’er?”

Mo Jiang spoke solemnly, “She… she isn’t in my Divine Phoenix Clan’s possession!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “What do you mean?”

As soon as he finished speaking, a strand of slaughter intent appeared here.

The expressions of all the others changed slightly, and they became vigilant.

Mo Jiang glanced at Yang Ye and said, “She was in my Divine Phoenix Clan’s possession, but she suddenly vanished some time back. She just disappeared into thin air. If I’m not wrong, someone might have taken her.”

Someone took her! Yang Ye clenched his fists slowly, “Someone can enter your Divine Phoenix Clan without alerting anyone?”

Mo Jiang spoke in a low voice, “Yang Ye, at this point, I have no reason to deceive you. She was taken by someone, and I can swear on that with my soul!”

Meanwhile, Gu Mo suddenly said, “Yang Ye, the Divine Phoenix Clan has always been proud, and they disdain to lie.”

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then he said, “Quickly let me see Snowy’s consciousness!”

Gu Mo heaved a sigh of relief in his heart, and then he said, “Yang Ye, the enmity between you and the Divine Phoenix Clan arose because of your friend and the consciousness of your other friend. Now, the Divine Phoenix Clan is willing to return your friend’s consciousness to you, so can you let bygones be bygones?”

“You want me to let bygones be bygones?” Yang Ye had a ferocious expression on his face, “If Snowy’s consciousness is fine, then I’ll do that. However, if there’s anything wrong with it, then I’ll make the Divine Phoenix Clan pay with the lives of all its members!”

The faces of the experts from the Divine Phoenix Clan became extremely unsightly. After all, Yang Ye was slapping them in public! However, they couldn’t do anything about it.

Gu Mo, Gu Tian, and the other experts of the demon race fell silent. They weren’t willing to offend the madman who stood before them. Moreover, Yang Ye’s attitude was very clear, and he only intended to target the Divine Phoenix Clan. So, the Divine Phoenix Clan could only blame itself for capturing Yang Ye’s friends. Now, they’d almost been annihilated as a consequence of that!

Time trickled by. Around 15 minutes later, an old man appeared here. The old man went to Mo Jiang and said, “Xiaoleng… Xiaoleng can’t return.”

“What do you mean?” It was Yang Ye who asked the question. At this moment, a blood red glow had appeared around him.

The old man’s eyelids twitched, and he answered, “Xiaoleng is being held captive by the crown prince of the devil race. She can’t come back right now.”

Meanwhile, Gu Mo hurriedly said, “Yang Ye, calm down. I’ll go talk with the devil race. We…”

“No, I’ll do it myself!” Yang Ye vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Gu Mo was stunned by this, and then he shook his head, “Devil race, I mourn for you!”
