Chapter 1995 – Retreat!

Yang Ye and the others went to the edge of the mountain’s peak, and they could see everything down below.

At this moment, an endless ocean of demon beasts were surging towards Southern Qilin Mountain, and the sight of this dense ocean of demon beasts caused a chill to run down their spines.

There were too many of them!

“Activate the formation!” Suddenly, a voice resounded from above the mountain, and then numerous flying swords appeared in the sky above the mountain. After that, these swords transformed into rays of light that shot towards the demon beasts on the ground below.

They rained down like a storm, and then howls of pain resounded once they entered the ocean of demon beasts.

While the flying swords were powerful, they were far from sufficient when facing the boundless expanse of demon beasts.

A’Man suddenly said, “We won’t be able to defend the mountain!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly. It was really impossible to defend Southern Qilin Mountain. Even if everyone here formed a united front, they still had no chance.

Those demon beasts were much more united!

Suddenly, an old man appeared before Yang Ye’s group. The old man said, “”Mr. Mo requests your presence!”

Mr. Mo was the leader of the southern faction, Mo Tianqiong!

Yang Ye and the others exchanged glances, and then Yang Ye said, “Let’s go!”

They followed the old man to Southern Qilin Hall at the top of the mountain. Around 300 people were gathered here, and they were all top-rate experts.

The meeting was led by two middle aged men. One of them was Mo Tianqiong, and not too far away on his right was a middle aged man in a black robe. He was the leader of the northern faction, Wan Qianyou!

At this moment, everyone in the hall had an extremely solemn expression on their face.

Mo Tianqiong nodded slightly when he saw Yang Ye’s group arrive, and he said, “Everyone, based on our estimations, if this continues, then we won’t be able to defend Southern Qilin Mountain!”

Actually, all of them had expected this. But now that Mo Tianqiong had openly admitted it, they had quite complicated emotions in their hearts.

Meanwhile, Mo Tianqiong said, “While we can’t defend the mountain, it doesn’t mean that we have no hope. I’m sure you’re aware of what their main objective is. It’s actually the teleportation formation here and not us. So, we’ve decided to abandon Southern Qilin Mountain and retreat.”

Retreat!

Everyone had come to the same conclusion.

Mo Tianqiong said, “Everyone, fate brought us together here, yet now, that fate is over. The Dead Dimension is about to fall into chaos. So, your fate is in your own hands.”

Someone asked, “When are we leaving?”

Mo Tianqiong replied, “Southern Qilin Mountain’s formation can last for at least three days, so we’ll leave on the day after tomorrow. Right, the spirit veins at the top and bottom of the mountain are open to all of you now. Many immortal crystals still remain in there, so you can spend the next two days searching for them!”

“Thank you for your kindness, Mr. Mo!” Someone praised.

Many others nodded and praised as well!

Mo Tianqiong grinned, “Good luck everyone!”

It only took a short while for everyone to disperse, and they rushed to the spirit veins. All of them wanted to gain a little before leaving.

Immortal crystals!

A few more immortal crystals represented a larger chance at survival!

As for Yang Ye’s group, they returned to their room.

In the room.

Qin Chuan spoke abruptly, “Aren’t we going to get some immortal crystals?”

A’Man gazed at him and shook her head.

“Why?” Qin Chuan gazed at her with a puzzled expression on his face, “Big Sis, the way you’re looking at me makes me feel really uncomfortable!”

A’Man said, “Haven’t you noticed anything off about all of this?”

Qin Chuan was puzzled, “Something’s off?”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye asked, “Do you really think Mo Tianqiong would be that nice?”

Qin Chuan’s face fell, “You’re saying that they’re planning something?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t know. However, we must be careful. Besides that, we won’t be waiting until tomorrow. We’ll leave tonight!”

Someone asked, “Why?”

Yang Ye replied, “We have enough immortal crystals, so staying is just a waste of time! So, get prepared. We’ll be leaving late at night!”

All of them had no objection towards this.

Yang Ye returned to his room, sat down cross-legged, and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Cultivate!

He refused to waste even a bit of time that could be used for cultivating. His cultivation was at a bottleneck, so it was pointless to continue cultivating in that aspect. This time, Yang Ye planned to cultivate in the Sword Fusion he’d just comprehended.

He was the sword, and the sword was him!

Countless sword cultivators had heard such a thing, but it was absolutely difficult to truly accomplish. He’d once treated the sword as part of himself, but he hadn’t reached the state of treating himself as the sword itself.

Now, he’d accomplished that. However, he had many other things to figure out. Since he didn’t have anyone to guide him, he had to rely on himself and slowly discover a lot of things.

Just like that, time trickled by, and it was late at night.

A’Man arrived in Yang Ye’s room.

Yang Ye asked, “Is everyone ready?”

A’Man nodded slightly, “They’re all ready. However, where will we be heading? Do you have a plan?”

Yang Ye stood up and said, “There’s a plain behind Southern Qilin Mountain, and we can’t go there. Because once the demon beasts chase us there, we’ll definitely be unable to escape them.”

“Then we can only go towards the left of Southern Qilin Mountain!” A’Man spoke solemnly, “The ocean is over 50,000km away in that direction. It should be quite safe!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Yang Ye shook his head, “We’re going towards the right!”

“The right?” A’Man frowned, “It’s an expanse of boundless mountains there. Demon beasts have a huge advantage there!”

Yang Ye replied, “Do the opposite! Don’t forget that there are humans amongst the demon beasts. If they want to pursue outsiders like us, they’ll choose the left first. So, it’s better to take a risk and head right. The mountain range is more dangerous than the plains behind Southern Qilin Mountain, and there are absolutely few who’ll be going that way. The fewer there are, the smaller the target we’ll be, and that’s much more beneficial to us!”

A'Man fell silent for a long time, and then she said, “Perhaps the demon beasts won’t pursue us?”

Yang Ye replied, “They definitely will!”

A'Man was puzzled, “Why?”

Yang Ye explained, “Greed. If the people in Southern Qilin Mountain didn’t touch the spirit veins and take the immortal crystals before leaving, then maybe they wouldn’t chase after us. However, there probably won’t be a single immortal crystal left here by tomorrow. At that time, once the demon beasts realize that they can’t leave this place immediately, they’ll definitely direct their rage towards us outsiders.”

A'Man fell silent for a long time before she said, “Alright, we’ll go towards the right!”

Once they left the room, they saw Qin Chuan and the others waiting outside.

The flying swords were still howling down below the mountain, and it was accompanied by the howls of countless demon beasts.

Yang Ye glanced at the others and said, “Let’s go!”

It didn’t take long for them to sneak out of Southern Qilin Mountain. If it was at any other time, it would be absolutely impossible to sneak out of Southern Qilin Mountain, yet now, everyone here was madly searching for immortal crystals, so how could anyone have the time to pay attention to anything else?

Right after they left Southern Qilin Mountain and planned to flee, a huge explosion suddenly resounded from Southern Qilin Mountain.

Yang Ye and the others shot a glance back at Southern Qilin Mountain, and they watched with astonishment as the barrier of light above the mountain and the flying swords gradually vanished.

After they vanished, there was nothing standing before the demon beasts and Southern Qilin Mountain, and all of them charged up the mountain!

Qin Chuan asked, “What’s going on?”

Yang Ye said, “I see. If I’m not wrong, Mo Tianqiong and the others have left Southern Qilin Mountain. As for the people left here, they’re sacrifices!”

“Sacrifices?” Qin Chuan continued, “You’re saying that what they spoke about in the hall earlier was all a lie, and they intentionally made these people stay?”

Yang Ye nodded, “He expected that these demon beasts wouldn’t spare all of us outsiders. Under such circumstances, the only way to retreat safely is to make some people stay in Southern Qilin Mountain and delay the demon beasts. As for how to make them stay, there’s only a single way to accomplish that—immortal crystals!”

Yang Ye looked up at Southern Qilin Mountain, “All of them wanted to gain some immortal crystals before leaving, but they never realized that it was a trap someone laid out for them.”

At this moment, the sound of battle could be heard coming from Southern Qilin Mountain.

The demon beasts had ascended the mountain, and only now did the humans there realize what was going on. They wanted to fly, but they realized that there was nowhere to escape. There was a dense ocean of demon beasts on the ground and in the air. They’d completely covered Southern Qilin Mountain to the point that there was no gap in them.

The only way to live was to fight their way out!

The situation on Southern Qilin Mountain was horrifying.

Meanwhile, a few groups had already snuck out of the mountain.

Yang Ye’s group entered the boundless mountain range. At this moment, their goal was to escape Southern Qilin Mountain and survive until the seal around the Dead Dimension vanished.

They headed all the way north.

The sun gradually appeared on the horizon. Meanwhile, all of them stopped because they’d passed through the mountain range and arrived at an expanse of crimson ground. It was an expanse of crimson ground that emanated strange red vapors!

Qin Chuan spoke softly, “There’s something off about this place!”

Yang Ye gazed at A’Man, “What is this place?”

A'Man shook her head, “I don’t know! The furthest I’ve been from Sky Residence City was Southern Qilin Mountain!”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, “Let’s just take this one step at a time! Be careful!”

All of them headed forward. Yang Ye suddenly stopped around 15 minutes later.

Meanwhile, a voice resounded, “It has been so long since someone alive has come here!”
