Chapter 1465 – Taking Advantage Of The Situation!

Yang Ye didn’t stay longer in Spirit Village. Once he said his farewells to the long bearded old man, the Village Leader Mo Ke, Yang Ye immediately left Spirit Village and continued forward!

Once he was done with the mysterious woman, Yang Ye really felt much lighter.

Because he didn’t have to worry about someone being behind him at all times!

However, a hand suddenly appeared on his shoulder.

That hand again! Yang Ye’s figure stiffened, and then he laughed bitterly, “Miss Mo Ling, don’t tell me you still need something?”

Mo Ke had told him that the mysterious woman’s name was Mo Ling.

Mo Ling moved her hand to Yang Ye’s back, and then she started writing.

Thank you!

Just two words.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief when he realized that she just wanted to express her gratitude. He was really afraid that she would ask him to help with another troublesome matter. Fortunately, it wasn’t the case.

Yang Ye smiled and said, “It was nothing. Moreover, I took a treasure from you. So, there’s no need to thank me. Er, see you next time....”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye was about to leave.

Meanwhile, Mo Ling’s hand started moving on his back again. This time, she wrote four words — I’ll wait for you!

Yang Ye was stunned. Wait for me? What does she mean?

Yang Ye was about to ask when her hand suddenly vanished. Yang Ye didn’t ask the question because he knew that she was gone.

She’ll wait for me? Yang Ye couldn’t figure it out no matter how he racked his brains, Why is she waiting for me? Has she fallen for me?

Yang Ye shook his head and rejected such an absurd thought. If it was in the past, then it might really be possible. After all, he felt that he was quite great. Yet now, because of his lifespan, he had white hair and looked very old. So, how could she have possibly fallen for him?

However, it wasn’t absolutely certain!

After all, who could dictate destiny?

Yang Ye was confident in himself!

Yang Ye continued forward while drunk with self-satisfaction. He didn’t try to figure out what Mo Ling meant. Because if he couldn’t return from the Forest of Darkness, then he would have wasted his time thinking about it. The important matter at hand was to get to the Forest of Darkness and obtain the Spring of Life. Otherwise, everything else would be meaningless.

After walking for quite some time, Yang Ye suddenly stopped because he felt something was off.

Logically speaking, he should be at the Forest of Darkness by now. However, not to mention a forest, he hadn’t even seen a tree. Yang Ye hesitated for a moment before he summoned Big Blackie. The reason he hadn’t summoned the Ancient Emperor Python was because that fellow had been imprisoned for thousands of years, so it would have probably not even heard of the Forest of Darkness!

Yang Ye gazed at Big Blackie and asked, “Where’s the Forest of Darkness?”

Big Blackie didn’t hesitate to turn and point towards the distance. It was the same direction which Yang Ye was traveling towards.

He was on the right track.

Yang Ye asked, “Then why haven’t we gotten there after traveling for so long?” He was afraid of getting lost. After all, getting lost here was fatal.

Big Blackie shook its head and started to wave its claw about.

A long time passed before Yang Ye understood what Big Blackie meant. It didn’t know the Forest of Darkness’ exact location. It had merely heard of the Forest of Darkness and was only aware of its rough direction. That rough direction was the direction it had pointed towards and the direction that Yang Ye was heading towards.

Yang Ye hesitated for a long time before he continued forward.

Because it was the same direction that Mo Ke had given him. So, it was probably correct.

Since it was correct, then he had to continue forward!

After he left Spirit Village, the miasma appeared again. He’d asked Mo Ke about the miasma here, and Mo Ke didn’t know as well. Mo Ke had merely said that for some unknown reason, a huge amount of miasma had appeared here from a very long time ago. Moreover, the source of the miasma was on the other side of Yellow Springs River.

So, he didn’t know where the miasma came from. As for why Spirit Village wasn’t filled with miasma, it was because the Spirit Race had set up a formation in the village, and it kept the miasma outside the village.

Yellow Springs River!

Actually, Yang Ye was really curious about it. What exactly was on the other side of Yellow Springs River? After all, so many people were so afraid of it! He didn’t know how strong Mo Ke was, but he knew that Mo Ke was definitely stronger than him. Otherwise, Mo Ke wouldn’t have been able to put him to sleep before he could even react. Even though he’d underestimated his opponent and had been taken by surprise, it was sufficient to prove Mo Ke’s strength.

But even with Mo Ke’s strength, he was still so afraid of the other side of the river!

It was the same for the middle aged man who’d given Yang Ye the dragon seal. That middle aged man’s strength was definitely extremely strong as well. However, the middle aged man had still died.

What exactly is on the other side? Yang Ye was extremely curious. However, no matter how curious he was, he had no intention to go there and have a look. He didn’t want to court death! However, he’d decided that once he grew stronger, he could travel through this place. Especially the other side of Yellow Springs River, he could take a look there. Of course, it was after he grew stronger. For example, after he attained the Deity Realm!

If he attained the Deity Realm, then this place wouldn’t be that dangerous anymore!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Suddenly, numerous explosions resounded from afar. A short while passed, and then numerous loud explosions rumbled incessantly like thunderclaps from afar.

Yang Ye was shocked. Someone got here?

Suddenly, his expression changed slightly. Because the explosions were rushing rapidly in his direction.

Yang Ye’s figure flashed and vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye stared fixedly towards the distance while hiding in the shadows. The miasma there was suddenly blasted away by a strand of powerful force, and then a man and a beast appeared before Yang Ye.

The demon beast was huge. It had the body of a person, the head of a cow, and stood on two feet. Its entire body was covered in thick scale armor, and it held a huge black hammer in its grasp. Every single swing of its hammer caused the space around it to tremble violently.

The demon beast’s opponent was a man. The man was huge as well. Even though he seemed quite young, he weighed at least 150kg. He looked very powerful, and he held a black rod in his grasp. Every single time his rod collided with the demon beast’s hammer, a rumbling explosion would resound.

Yang Ye was quite shocked because the man was actually evenly matched with the demon beast.

Who is he? Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto the fat man. He was really quite curious. Because a human had been able to get here, and that was no simple feat.

The man and beast were still fighting in midair.

After fighting for a while, the demon beast suddenly raised its head and roared with fury. After that, a dome of dazzling black light suddenly erupted from its body. The dome had just appeared when it immediately started to shrink back, and then it covered the demon beast’s body like a net of light. Once it was covered by the net of light, the demon beast’s strength instantly rose explosively, and a single swing of its hammer instantly blasted the fat man around 10km back!

Yang Ye was quite surprised. But he came to an understanding just a moment later. Practically all demon beasts had their own innate divine abilities, and that included Eaglet and the others. However, there were limits to such abilities. The demon beast had clearly been infuriated by the fat man, and it had activated its ultimate move.

Yang Ye gazed at the fat man. The force of that attack had clearly been too terrifying. The fat man’s fat was trembling violently, and it was quite a magnificent sight. Besides that, there was a trace of scarlet red on the corner of his mouth. Obviously, he’d been injured by that attack.

The man wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and then he gazed at the demon beast, “Come! Continue fighting with your Grandpa Shi!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure shot towards the demon beast. Once he arrived around 30m away from the demon beast, he grabbed the rod with both hands and slammed it down.

A wisp of viciousness flashed through the demon beast’s eyes, and it roared furiously before raising its hammer and swinging it against the man’s rod. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then both of them split apart in midair.

The man moved around 1km back while the demon beast hadn’t even been pushed 300m back.

But it didn’t take long for the fat man to charge forward again.

The shock in Yang Ye’s heart grew as he watched. Because the man’s strength had far exceeded his expectations. The demon beast’s strength was much greater than Eaglet, Big Blackie, and the others. It could be said to merely be slightly weaker than the python. However, the man was actually able to collide head-on with it, and he was just a Semi-Deity!

A Semi-Deity!

Not a Deity!

Is he one of the top three on the Dragon Rankings? Yang Ye was quite curious.

Even though the fat man was completely fearless in battle and charged forward repeatedly, he couldn’t do anything because the demon beast was stronger than him. So, he was blasted flying, over and over again. In the end, Yang Ye noticed that his entire arm was trembling violently. Obviously, it had definitely become completely numb.

Under normal circumstances, humans were utterly incapable of resisting the physical strength of demon beasts.

The fat man was very strong for being able to fight the demon beast to such an extent.

After he was blasted flying again, the fat man didn’t charge forward again. Because the demon beast had charged at him, and then the fat man was constantly attacked and fell into a defensive state.

The fat throughout his body was trembling violently under the frenzied attacks of the demon beast, and it seemed like oil would start spraying out from him.

Needless to say, he was in quite a miserable state. He was completely suppressed in battle. However, he wasn’t weak. Even though he was suppressed, he was still barely able to resist the demon beast.

However, defeat was only a matter of time!

Around 20 plus breaths of time later, an explosion resounded before the fat man was blasted far away, and his blood sprayed incessantly through the air.

Yang Ye shook his head at the sight of this. If his blood continues spraying, then he’ll probably lose all his blood.

Suddenly, the fat man glanced at the surroundings and said, “Brother, stop hiding. Help me, and I’ll be forever in your debt.”

Yang Ye was stunned. He noticed my presence?

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to realize that the fat man merely knew that someone was here, and he didn’t know Yang Ye’s exact location.

Meanwhile, the fat man was blasted flying again, and he suddenly shouted loudly as his figure flew backwards, “A million divine crystals. Help me and I’ll give you a million divine crystals!”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. He’s that rich?

It didn’t take long for the fat man to be blasted away again.

“Two million divine crystals!” The fat man shouted in midair, “Brother, I’ll give you two million divine crystals to save me!”

A moment of silence ensued, and then a voice resounded, “Five million!”

It was Yang Ye’s voice, of course!

The fat man’s face stiffened in midair, and then he laughed bitterly, “You’re just taking advantage of the situation....”
