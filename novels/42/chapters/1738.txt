Chapter 1739 – Obliteration Sword Formation!

After the woman in a red dress stomped her foot, many Blood Corpses had suddenly appeared here!

There were over a hundred of them!

They just appeared out of thin air, and there had been no sign of their presence before this. It was like they were already standing there from the beginning.

She walked over to Yang Ye and said, “Let’s go.”

Yang Ye shrugged and gazed at Ku Zhuyi, “Let’s go!”

Suddenly, the woman gazed at Yang Ye, “It’s best if you don’t play any tricks. Because it’s meaningless! Trust me!”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “You know what I intend to do!”

“You want to capture me, right?” She looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Want to give it a try?”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a long time, and then he suddenly vanished on the spot. He was behind her when he appeared again. He hadn’t concealed his strength at this moment, but his expression changed when he arrived behind her.

It was because she’d suddenly appeared where he had been standing a moment ago, and she was looking at him.

Both of them were absolutely fast. So, Ku Zhuyi hadn’t been able to react to what had just happened.

Yang Ye stared at the woman. Her speed was actually faster than him, and it was much faster!

After all, he’d launched the attack, but he was still slower than her!

She spoke indifferently, “Do you still want to try?”

Yang Ye shrugged, “Isn’t it just going down there? So be it.” Yang Ye wrapped his left arm around Ku Zhuyi’s waist and leaped down into the well. As for the woman in a red dress, she leaped into the well as well.

After he entered the well, Yang Ye noticed that the space here was much larger than he’d imagined, and the faint light was coming from the surroundings. So, the scene here was clearly visible.

There were numerous symbols all over the well’s walls, and it was just like how it was on the outside of the well.

They descended incessantly, and it took around an hour for them to finally reach the ground.

“Let’s go!” As soon as she finished speaking, the woman in a red dress started walking towards the passageway in front of them.

Meanwhile, Ku Zhuyi said, “Be careful!”

Yang Ye nodded. Just like that, they followed the woman forward.

They didn’t speak all along the way. The surroundings were silent too. So, it was extremely silent here.

Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “Miss, you seem like a straightforward person, so can you tell us your true objective? Otherwise, it’ll give me a headache if I keep guessing.”

She replied, “You’ll find out very soon!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Ku Zhuyi’s voice resounded in his mind, “Just flee on your own if anything happens later”

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she continued via voice transmission, “Based on your strength, it’ll probably be difficult for her to stop you.”

Suddenly, the woman in a red dress said, “You can ask him to try that!”

Yang Ye gazed at the woman, “You’re able to hear her voice transmissions!”Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The woman didn’t say anything and just continued forward.

Around 15 minutes later, she suddenly stopped. There was a door not too far away from her. The door was quite unique. Because it was completely formed from mysterious symbols. There was a wisp of solemness and fear in her eyes as she gazed at the door.

She fell silent for a moment before suddenly turning to look at Yang Ye, “Open it and your mission will be over.”

Yang Ye glanced at the door and asked, “You can’t open it?”

She said, “If I could, why would I have brought you here?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “You think too highly of me. Your strength is definitely greater than mine. If even you can’t, then how could I possibly succeed?”

She spoke with absolute certainty, “You can!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She replied, “Because this door was left behind by that old man in Daoist’s robes. You have his aura on your, so it won’t reject you. As for anyone else, it’ll attack if anyone enters the area a meter around it.”

It was left behind by the old man in Daoist’s robes! Yang Ye glanced at the door, and then he gazed at her, “What’s inside there?”

The woman in the red dress said, “Won’t you find out once you open it?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time before he walked over to the door. The door suddenly started trembling when Yang Ye arrived before the door. Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched, and the woman frowned slightly as well.

Suddenly, the door calmed down.

The woman glanced at Yang Ye and said, “As expected, it won’t attack you!”

Yang Ye glanced at her, and then he gazed at the door. If he was being honest, he didn’t want to open the door. But he had no other choice. He really didn’t have a choice.

Flee?

Her speed was faster than his, so trying to flee wouldn’t work. Fight her to the death? He’d considered it, but the situation wasn’t that dire to warrant that. Because she didn’t seem to be hostile towards him.

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment, and then he placed his right hand on the door. Right when he was about to use the Decay Laws, the Primordial Pagoda suddenly trembled, and then the door trembled. After that, Yang Ye watched with astonishment as it vanished.

What’s going on?

I didn’t do anything!

Yang Ye was stunned.

Meanwhile, the woman took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, “Let’s go!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she walked forward.

Yang Ye and Ku Zhuyi exchanged glances, and then they followed her.

Meanwhile, the Divine Yin Flame’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “She wasn’t wrong. If it was anyone else, even a 5th stage True Realm expert, it would still be impossible to get through that door. As for you, you would be dead if it wasn’t for the pagoda!”

“I would be dead?” Yang Ye asked, “What do you mean?”

“What do I mean?” The Divine Yin Flame said, “That door doesn’t recognize that you’re Master’s successor. It was about to attack you just now. If it attacked you, your current strength wouldn’t be able to stop it at all. So, the pagoda helped. If it didn’t help, you would be a corpse right now.”

The Divine Yin Flame paused for a moment and continued, “Kid, be careful. That woman isn’t ordinary, and Master actually sealed this place, so it makes it even more unordinary. So, be careful!”

Yang Ye nodded. He would be careful even if the Divine Yin Flame didn’t warn him!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and glanced at the surroundings. He was stunned when he saw the scene around him. It was because he was in a hall, and it was a luxurious hall. The surroundings glittered with gold and jade, and it was decorated gorgeously!

Suddenly, the woman raised her right hand, and a black Sword Chest appeared in front of Yang Ye.

She said, “It’s called Obliteration. It was forged by a sword cultivator. That sword cultivator believed that there’s a cause for everything, and if there’s a cause, there’s an effect. Karma. He created a sword formation according to that principle — Obliteration. At the instant the swords emerge, they sever karma, and everything is obliterated before them!”

She paused for a moment and continued, “It’s extremely powerful and can destroy the heavens and the earth. However, only a single type of person can truly bring forth its might!”

Yang Ye asked, “What type of person?”

“The emotionless!” The woman said, “Those without emotion and without kindness. Destroy everything with a single thought! It’s extremely strong. If you have even the slightest kind thoughts in your heart while you fight, its strength will be severely weakened!”

“You don’t have to worry about that!” Suddenly, Ku Zhuyi said, “He won’t hold such thoughts when he fights!”

Yang Ye rubbed his nose, and then he gazed at the Sword Chest. This time, he didn’t need her to tell him. He flicked a droplet of his blood on it, and then it shook violently before Yang Ye felt a connection had formed between them!

Yang Ye issued a command in his heart. In an instant, six black swords appeared in front of him. The swords were around 1m long, completely pitch black, and emanated an icy cold aura that made others feel extremely uncomfortable!

“They were forged with evil intent!” The woman suddenly explained, “All six of these swords were forged with evil intent by that sword cultivator. The stronger your evil intent is when you kill, the stronger these swords will be, and the stronger the formation they form will be.”

Yang Ye glanced at the woman and asked, “That sword cultivator was an evil cultivator?”

She nodded, “Yes!”

“No wonder!” Yang Ye nodded slightly. The sword formation and swords were obviously not created by an ordinary sword cultivator. An ordinary sword cultivator would definitely be incapable of creating something like this. Of course, all of that wasn’t important. What was important was that the swords and sword formation were useful to him!

He didn’t take a look at the sword formation which had appeared in his mind, and he gazed at the woman instead, “Since the door has been opened, then we’ll be bidding our farewells! See you!”

Yang Ye was about to take Ku Zhuyi and leave once he finished speaking, but the woman suddenly said, “I haven’t gotten what I want!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “You still need my help?”

She nodded, “But it’s just a small thing. Come with me.”

She turned around and walked to the back of the hall.

Yang Ye and Ku Zhuyi exchanged glances. They fell silent for a moment before Yang Ye said, “Let’s go!”

It didn’t take long for them to arrive before a black coffin. The coffin was an ordinary coffin, but there was a talisman on the coffin. Yang Ye’s expression changed when he saw the coffin.

Because that talisman was exactly similar to the talisman which was sealing his right arm!

The woman said, “Tear it off!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “What’s in there?”

She replied, “You’ll find out after you tear it off!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I refuse!” His intuition told him that the thing sealed with the coffin was absolutely not something good.

Suddenly, a translucent hand wrapped around Ku Zhuyi’s throat.

A Soul Corpse!

Yang Ye’s face changed when he witnessed this. He hadn’t expected a Soul Corpse to be here! Moreover, he actually hadn’t noticed it all along the way.

The woman in a red dress walked over to Yang Ye and looked him in the eyes, “Tear it off.”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and nodded, “Fine. I’m not afraid of you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he walked over to the coffin. He was about to touch the talisman when it suddenly shook. However, at the moment it shook, the Primordial Pagoda suddenly shook as well, and then the talisman calmed down.

A moment later, Yang Ye pulled it off.

As soon as he pulled off the talisman, the coffin’s lid sprang open.

Yang Ye glanced into the coffin, and his eyes instantly opened wide when he saw the figure within the coffin, “Are you kidding me?!”
