Chapter 1954 – Sky Residence City!

The surroundings suddenly fell silent!

Yang Ye turned around and saw a robust woman on his right. Her figure was huge, and it was more than two times the size of a normal person. As for her legs, they were practically thicker than Yang Ye’s own waist.

She was holding a spiked club in her grasp!

The spiked club was so huge that it exceeded Yang Ye’s imagination. It could be said that even his entire body may not be as huge as it!

The leader of the group of devil men had been smacked away by that exact same spiked club!

The robust woman supported the spiked club on her shoulder as she walked slowly towards the devil men, “You bastards! We usually coexist peacefully, so what the hell is going on now? How dare you cause trouble in my territory? Are you tired of living?”

As soon as she finished speaking, her spiked club suddenly shot forward.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Three of the devil men were blasted away.

Yang Ye was stunned by this scene.

All three of those devil men had been 2nd stage Enlightened Realm experts! But they’d been blasted away just like that!

“A’Man, your people killed our people first!” Suddenly, the devil man who led the group stepped forward, “It’s your side that provoked us first!”

The woman called A’Man frowned, and then she gazed at Qin Chuan who was covered in injuries right now, “Kid, you attacked first?”

Qin Chuan laughed bitterly and replied, “Sister Man, do you think I would dare to disobey your orders?”

A'Man asked, “Then what happened?”

Qin Chuan gazed at Yang Ye, “Sister Man, this brother just came in here from the outside world and somehow offended the devil men, but he just happened to join us. So… In any case, he has joined Sky Residence City. That’s all!”

A'Man turned to look at Yang Ye, and then she appeared before him!

A solemn expression instantly appeared on Yang Ye’s face!

It was because he hadn’t even sensed her movement!

A’Man sized up Yang Ye, and then a wave of pressure enveloped Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was caught off guard and his body instantly fell towards the ground. Fortunately, he reacted quickly and hurriedly resisted the pressure, but the pressure grew stronger and stronger…

Yang Ye looked A’Man in the eyes, and she was looking at him in the eyes as well.

The pressure was getting even stronger!

In the end, cold sweat started to emerge from Yang Ye’s forehead. At the same time, cracking resounded from his entire body. It was the sound of his bones rubbing against each other!

A short while passed before the pressure vanished abruptly.

At the same time, A’Man nodded, “Not bad!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she gazed at the devil man and said, “He’s part of my Sky Residence City now. So, fuck off!”

The devil man who led the group had an extremely unsightly expression on his face, “A’Man, are you planning on going to war with my Devil Cave?”

A’Man suddenly said, “I’ll kill you if you don’t fuck off right now!”

The expressions of all the devil men changed slightly, and their leader didn’t dare to say another word. He just glanced coldly at Yang Ye, and then he led the others away.

Meanwhile, A’Man suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, “Don’t leave Sky Residence City for now.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

A’Man looked towards the distance, “The devil men of Devil Cave aren’t just brutal, they’re protective too. They won’t let this matter rest. So, if you don’t want anything to happen to yourself, just stay in Sky Residence City!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she gazed at Qin Chuan’s group, “Let’s head back!”

Yang Ye’s group followed A’Man to Sky Residence City.

Sky Residence City wasn’t huge, and it was just a small city. Moreover, it was quite old and damaged. There were around 10 young men on the city wall. Some were sitting there, some rested their backs against the wall, and some just lied there. Their expressions changed when they saw A’Man, and all of them stood up on the city wall while their gazes seemed sharp like swords as they stared forward!

A’Man laughed coldly, “All of you can stand on guard for another day!”

All of them had bitter expressions on their faces when they heard her.

Yang Ye glanced at them. All of them were at the Enlightened Realm, and one of them was even at the 3rd stage of the Enlightened Realm!

Moreover, they were around his age!

This place was filled with geniuses!

That was what Yang Ye thought!

After entering the city, Yang Ye was shocked by the scene before him. The city was empty. There were no buildings! The entire city didn’t have any buildings! It was an empty city!

As if he knew what Yang Ye was thinking, Qin Chuan explained, “Don’t even think about resting in this place.”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “You seem to be vigilant against something!”

Qin Chuan chuckled, “You’ll find out at night!”

Meanwhile, A’Man stopped and gazed at Yang Ye, “I’m A’Man from the barbarian race, and I’m the leader of this place. Since you’ve just joined, you don’t have to take the night watch tonight. You’ll do it tomorrow!”

As she spoke, she gazed at Qin Chuan, “Explain everything to him!”

She left once she finished speaking.

Qin Chuan walked over to Yang Ye and said, “Sky Residence City used to have over 100 residents, yet now, only 62 remain. Perhaps there’ll be even fewer tomorrow. Most of the people here are humans, but there are those from the shaman race, sky race, demon race, and barbarian race. However, the enmity between races isn’t brought into here. For example, the human race and shaman race are sworn enemies in the outside world, but in this place, we’re very close to those fellows from the shaman race, and we’ve even fought and saved each other’s lives!”

He glanced at A’Man who was seated cross-legged around 3km away from them, and he said, “Our leader is from the barbarian race, and while the human race’s relationship with the barbarian race isn’t as bad as the relationship between the human race and shaman race, it still isn’t very good. But she doesn’t treat us with any bias here!”

Yang Ye glanced at A’Man, “She’s a genius of the barbarian race?”

Qin Chuan nodded, “The number one genius of the barbarian race. Her age is around ours, but she’s a Hear Dao Realm expert now, and her true strength is sufficient to kill Know Dao Realm experts! Moreover, she can do it with ease!”

The number one genius of the barbarian race!

Yang Ye nodded slightly and moved his gaze away. He asked, “What’s the night watch that you were talking about?”

A solemn expression appeared on Qin Chuan’s face, “Hell Mountain Range surrounds us, and there are many mysterious beings in the mountain range. Most of them never leave. Don’t ask me why because I don’t know. But there’s a type of creature that leaves Hell Mountain Range at night, and they roam the area!”

Yang Ye asked, “What creatures?”

“Wyverns!” Qin Chuan explained, “They’re extremely swift. Especially at night. They’re speed in the night is simply horrifying.” He paused for a moment and continued, “When I just arrived here, I was almost killed by one of them. The only way to avoid being killed by them is to be faster and more ruthless than them! That’s why my speed is so fast now. It’s because those fellows forced me to become this fast!”

He’d been forced to become fast!

Yang Ye fell silent.

Meanwhile, Qin Chuan patted Yang Ye on the shoulder, “I heard from A’Man that the world within Hell Mountain Range and outside Hell Mountain Range are even more dangerous. In short, you have to be mentally prepared because the Dead Dimension is much more dangerous than you ever imagined!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he walked over to the side and sat down cross-legged.

The Dead Dimension!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. Night had arrived. Many were seated cross-legged while their profound energy was fluctuating from time to time.

The surroundings were deathly silent.

Yang Ye looked up at the city walls. There were five people standing on each of the sections of the city walls. Most of them were young, but there were some who were slightly older. They had vigilant expressions on their faces, and they seemed like they were facing a formidable enemy!

A short while passed before Yang Ye moved his gaze away and immersed his consciousness into his body.

Merging with the Sky Dragon!

After he attained the Enlightened Realm, the first thing he wanted to do was merge further with the Sky Dragon. He’d merely merged with a single dragon claw, yet his body had undergone a qualitative transformation. So, how strong would he become once he merged completely with it?

Yang Ye took a deep breath as he stood in front of the Sky Dragon, “Let’s begin!”

A moment later, he sensed something enter his mind, and then dizziness washed over him.

Time trickled by. Cold sweat was ceaselessly appearing on Yang Ye’s face before flowing off it. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

A long time passed before Yang Ye opened his eyes!

Huff!

Yang Ye let out a mouthful of foul air and stood up. He gazed at his hands before shaking them lightly. In an instant, two ethereal white dragon claws appeared over his hands!

He’d had just one before this. Now, he had two!

Yang Ye clenched his fists slowly. As soon as they were fully clenched, the ethereal dragon claws were clenched as well.

At this moment, he felt like they were part of his hands!

Unfortunately, he wasn’t able to merge his entire body with the Sky Dragon. If he could merge his entire body with it, then coupled with the Gold Form he possessed, his physical defense would arrive at a horrifying level.

Sadly, his current realm of cultivation was utterly insufficient to merge fully with the Sky Dragon!

Suddenly, Yang Ye frowned and returned to the outside world.

It was late at night.

He looked up, and he saw the others were utterly vigilant like they were facing a formidable enemy.

Screech!

Suddenly, a sharp and ear piercing cry resounded from outside the city.

Meanwhile, Qin Chuan spoke solemnly, “They’re here!”
