Chapter 2180 – Shattered!

Three against 100 Sages!

Could they win?

Of course not. However, Yang Ye had no other choice. At this point in time, he had to fight even if he faced a thousand Sages!

Powerful energy surged out incessantly from Yang Ye’s blood red sword energy. At this moment, the battlefield couldn’t endure it any longer and collapsed. The surroundings were transformed into a black hole!

Suddenly, the Demon God closed his eyes slowly, and then a terrifying force soundlessly appeared.

Right when Yang Ye’s sword energy arrived around 3m before him, the Demon God suddenly opened his eyes. At that instant, his right hand transformed into a claw that was shaped like a dragon claw yet wasn’t one. It was strangely curved. In an instant, the claw slapped Yang Ye’s sword energy.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s sword energy was slapped into bits!

Suddenly, a sword arrived.

The Demon God’s expression didn’t change at all, and he raised the claw to block it.

Bang!

Powerful force surged out, and some of the other Sages were blasted backward repeatedly.

Ferocity appeared on the Demon God’s face, “Yang Ye, you’re going to die today!”

He shook his claw as he spoke.

Bang!

A strand ripple of energy surged out, and it instantly blasted Yang Ye away. At the same time, he grasped his claw in Yang Ye’s direction from afar!

Bang!

The area around Yang Ye exploded apart, but Yang Ye suddenly appeared behind the Demon God. An instant later, a sword stabbed into the Demon God’s back. It stabbed in slightly, causing blood to spray, but it couldn’t go any further.

Because the Demon God’s body had turned into that of a demon beast.

Or to be more precise, he’d returned to his true form. His body was like an ape. He was extremely tall and wide like a hill, but while he looked like an ape, he wasn’t one. His body was covered in scales that seemed like the scales of a dragon, and he had two sharp and long horns on his head. Those horns glimmered with a cold glow.

Heavenshaking Dragon Ape!

Yang Ye immediately recognized the identity of the Demon God’s true form. It was naturally because he’d read many books in Martial Emperor Academy, and it didn’t just contain the history of the various races, there was information on many powerful demon beasts and other experts!

The Heavenshaking Dragon Ape!

A descendant of the dragon race and spirit ape race of the ancient times. During that time, the dragon race was the strongest, and very few could fight it. The spirit ape race was one of them. Their union gave birth to descendants that possessed the strength of dragons and spirit apes, and the union of these two forces could simply shake the heavens.

The heavens here didn’t just represent any heavens but the entire heavens of the large universe!

At the moment Yang Ye’s sword had stabbed into his back, the Demon God had reacted swiftly and instantly returned to his true form. As soon as he did that, powerful force blasted Yang Ye and his sword away.

Yang Ye flew over 30km away!

The Demon God gazed at Yang Ye from afar, “Yang Ye, they saw you’re the number one expert below the Progenitor Realm. Come, let me see if it’s true!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he raised his right claw and slapped it down.

The world shook before it.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then blood red mist seeped out from his eyes. After that, he transformed into a ray of light that shot up into the air, and powerful blood red sword energy tore through the black hole as it stabbed against the Demon God’s palm.

Crack!

The Demon God’s palm instantly cracked open, and then the blood red sword energy pierced through and arrived before the Demon God.

Suddenly, the Demon God howled with fury.

Bang!

A powerful soundwave rippled out, and it instantly blasted Yang Ye away!

It was like a dragon roar!

At the instant he was blasted away, Yang Ye’s sword left his grasp and transformed into a ray of light that shot at the Demon God.

Hiss!

The sound of something being sliced open resounded. It was the soundwave!

It was quite deafening!

Judgment arrived in front of the Demon God, and it was covered in sharp and powerful sword energy. This attack was capable of slicing through anything before it!

Viciousness flashed through the Demon God’s eyes, and he clenched his left fist and slammed it forward.

BOOM!

It was like a tornado swept out from his fist, and powerful force instantly obliterated the black hole in the surroundings once more. As for Judgment, it was blasted away again, and it started to crack open as it flew!

In the end, Judgment descended before Yang Ye.

At this moment, the sharp sword energy around it was gone.

Yang Ye placed his right hand on Judgment’s hilt. Meanwhile, Judgment spoke softly, “Sorry, I can’t help you anymore.”

Yang Ye grinned, but his smile was slightly pale.

He was about to speak when Judgment suddenly shattered.

It had shattered completely!

Yang Ye stared blankly at the fragments before him, and then he waved his right hand and collected them all.

“I’m sorry!” Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, and then a sword howl shot up into the air and surged through the universe!

In an instant, a sword floated before Yang Ye!

The Sword Precursor!

The sword was the Sword Precursor. He’d left it in his sea of consciousness to nurture it, and now, he’d taken it out!

Yang Ye held the Sword Precursor in his grasp, and a strange feeling appeared within him.

It wasn’t a sword!

It was a part of his body!

That was what he felt right now!

The Sword Precursor’s level wasn’t as high as Judgment or the Sword Supreme, but at this moment, it had truly merged into one with Yang Ye’s heart and mind. Yang Ye was the sword, and the sword was Yang Ye! He’d truly become one with the Sword Spirit!

Yang Ye held the Sword Precursor in his grasp as he walked toward the Demon God.

Yang Ye seemed tiny like an ant before the Demon God’s huge body.

Even someone as powerful as the Demon God didn’t dare to be careless when facing Yang Ye. From the very beginning, he’d treated Yang Ye as an expert in the same realm of cultivation as him. From the beginning of the battle, he hadn’t looked down on Yang Ye at all, and he’d put his full strength in every attack!

Suddenly, Yang Ye stopped. In an instant, a wave of mysterious energy appeared in the surroundings.

The Sword Domain!

Yang Ye activated the Sword Domain once more!

As soon he activated the Sword Domain, Yang Ye pressed the Sword Precursor against his forehead. In an instant, endless sword intent swept out from within him, and the Sword Domain was instantly filled by sword intent. A moment later, ethereal swords appeared within the Sword Domain!

The Invincible Sword Domain!

The Demon God had a solemn look in his eyes, and he slowly clenched his fists. In an instant, thick scales appeared all around him, and they shined with a black glow. Besides that, threads of energy flowed around him, and they ceaselessly flowed like arcs of lightning.

Yang Ye slowly closed his eyes, “Slash!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

As soon as he said that, countless sword howls resounded, and then the entire Sword Domain was filled with rays of light!

At the moment the sword howl resounded, the Demon God suddenly stretched out his hands. In an instant, the energy flowing around him surged into his palms, and then he leaped forward and slapped them down at Yang Ye.

Boom!

As soon as the force from his palms surged out, explosions resounded, and the space in the surroundings was obliterated repeatedly!

At this moment, the space here was truly deathly silent, and it would take tens of thousands of years to be restored!

The battlefield was silent for a moment, and then countless rays of sword energy flickered once more. Just like that, it went on for around 15 minutes before everything returned to calm.

At this moment, Yang Ye and the Demon God were standing facing each other from afar. Blood was seeping out incessantly from the corner of Yang Ye’s mouth, and the Demon God’s body was covered in marks from Yang Ye’s sword. Blood was incessantly seeping out from the Demon God’s body, and because his body was so huge, it seemed extremely shocking like a river of blood was flowing out of him!

The Demon God gazed at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, I rarely admire anyone, but I have to admire you. You possess such strength at your age, I…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and then he appeared behind the Demon God. An instant later, the Sword Domain appeared, and then Yang Ye roared with fury as he stabbed his sword into the Demon God’s back with both hands.

The Demon God’s expression changed drastically when he sensed this. He hadn’t expected Yang Ye to be able to execute such a terrifying attack at this point in their battle!

Because of his size, he couldn’t dodge at all, nor could he counterattack. He could only passively defend himself and attack.

In an instant, countless scales converged on his back to protect the point Yang Ye’s sword was descending toward!

Bang!

The Demon God’s enormous body shook violently. He was about to seize the opportunity to flash away, but Yang Ye suddenly howled hysterically with rage and twisted his sword with both hands!

Hiss!

A moment later, Yang Ye and his sword stabbed through the Demon God, and the latter’s body stiffened on the spot.

Crack!

A moment of silence ensued, and then countless rays of sword energy surged out from within the Demon God. In an instant, the Demon God’s huge body split open into countless pieces that rained down from midair.

The Demon God was dead!

Suddenly, Yang Ye walked out slowly from the mist of blood created from the Demon God’s death, and then he gazed at the other Sages in the surroundings.

He slowly raised his sword at them and spoke ferociously, “Bring it!”
