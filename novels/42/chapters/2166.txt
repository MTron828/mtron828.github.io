Chapter 2167 – Killing is Fun!

The Human Dimension.

After they returned to the Human Dimension, An Nanjing entered the Primordial Pagoda while Yang Ye went to Nature Sacred Ground.

In the hall.

The experts from all over the Human Dimension were gathered in the hall.

Up until now, the human race only had 19 Sages.

19!

It could be described as the true strength of the human race. While the human race had been in existence for countless years, it wasn’t that easy for it to have 19 Sages.

Sages weren’t so easily made. While Yang Ye and An Nanjing already possessed strength that surpassed Sages, they weren’t Sages in the end. Moreover, it was utterly impossible for them to attain the Sage Realm in a short while!

The gazes of everyone in the hall converged on Yang Ye.

At this moment, Yang Ye felt unfathomable to them.

A genius of the human race!

All the Sages here felt rather gratified. While the human race was fond of internal strife at most times, they would still step forward when their race was in danger.

The human race had been defeated, but it had never been conquered!

Yang Ye asked, “Has the Alliance of All taken any action?”

Yang Lianshuang suddenly stepped forward and answered, “They haven’t taken any action in the last six months. However, some strange incidents have occurred throughout the large universe. The spirit energy in many smaller worlds has started to gradually vanish. At this point, no less than 30 continents have been destroyed, and this number is still increasing. Besides that, the spirit energy in even many other places throughout the medium universe and our large universe has started to dry up.”

The End Times!

The atmosphere here became quite heavy.

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly.

The End Times had begun.

Suddenly, Lin Zhen walked in and gazed at Yang Ye, “The Weapon Path has requested your presence!”

“The Weapon Path?” Yang Ye frowned slightly, “Do they need something?”

Lin Zhen shook his head, “They just requested your presence. They say that they have something to discuss with you.”

Meanwhile, an old man spoke abruptly, “They’re probably planning something!”

Yang Ye gazed at the old man. The old man’s name was Elder Xuan, and he was of quite high seniority in the human race, and he could be said to be the oldest Sage in the human race. Something worth mentioning was that Elder Xuan used to be part of the Sage Alliance, and they’d sent him to kill Yang Ye a long time ago.

But Elder Xuan refused!

Meanwhile, Elder Xuan gazed at Yang Ye, “You’re the central pillar of my human race, so you must be careful at all times and can absolutely not act carelessly.”

Even though the human race was united right now, it was because of Yang Ye’s presence. Yang Ye was the central core of it, and he brought everyone together. Moreover, these experts of the human race were willing to accept his leadership. However, no one else could replicate the same thing.

Even the Sovereign of Man had never been able to make the entire human race truly submit to him!

“I think you can go!” Suddenly, Yang Lianshuang spoke. She bowed slightly to Elder Xuan and continued, “The Weapon Path has always remained neutral, so they probably have their reasons for inviting Yang Ye over. As far as I’m concerned, it should be related to the Alliance of All. As for the danger Elder Xuan mentioned, it naturally exists. However, I believe he’s very confident in his own strength!”

She gazed at Yang Ye and grinned when she spoke up to this point.

Everyone else gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “I’ll go have a look. I too would like to know what their attitude towards things is like right now.”

Elder Xuan nodded slightly, “Then be careful. Just send us a voice transmission if anything happens.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “Now we have another problem. The spirit energy in some places within the Human Dimension has started to dry up, so about the people there…”

“Bring them over!” Yang Ye suddenly said, “Our human race is in a crisis right now, so I hope we can all give support and help whenever and wherever it’s needed.”

He withdrew a spatial ring and placed it on the table in front of him, “There are a million immortal crystals in here. All of you discuss how to use it. If it isn’t enough, then all of you contribute some too.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he walked out of the hall, and Lin Zhen followed him out.

A million immortal crystals!

Silence filled the hall.

A million immortal crystals were not a small amount at all. Even if they were all Sages here, their entire wealth may not total a million immortal crystals. The most precious thing in the End Times was immortal crystals.

A long time passed before Elder Xuan sighed, “I can’t compare to him!”

If he was being honest, he would never give away so many immortal crystals at once, especially at a time like this.

Meanwhile, Elder Xuan gazed at Yang Lianshuang, “You manage it!”

Yang Lianshuang nodded and took the spatial ring.

A million immortal crystals!

Even she was moved by that sum!

Outside the hall.

Yang Ye gazed at Lin Zhen, “Do you need something?”

.

Lin Zhen nodded, “To be honest, I have a request.”

Yang Ye said, “Please go on!”

Lin Zhen hesitated for a moment and said, “I want to ask you to take Shu Ya as your disciple.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Yang Ye had naturally not forgotten Shu Ya. It was the young man who’d gained the Confucianist Progenitor’s inheritance.

Yang Ye asked, “Why? I’m sure you’re aware that his path will be completely different from my path!”

Lin Zhen laughed bitterly, “I know. I just want him to have an identity, and identity that will keep him alive. So, even if I’m dead, no one will dare to target him throughout the Human Dimension or even the large universe.”

Yang Ye came to an understanding at this point.

Shu Ya was the Confucianist Progenitor’s successor, but the Confucianist Progenitor and Confucianist Path were gone. Lin Zhen was afraid that the responsible parties would not spare Shu Ya. If that was the case, then Lin Zhen and the entire Lin Clan wouldn’t be able to protect Shu Ya at all.

Yang Ye!

Throughout the human race, Yang Ye was the only one who could instill fear in those existences hiding in the shadows.

Yang Ye nodded when he thought up to this point, “Alright!”

Lin Zhen heaved a sigh of relief in his heart when he heard this, and then he bowed respectfully to Yang Ye, “My Lin Clan will never forget this kindness, and we’ll follow you no matter what from now on.”

Yang Ye’s agreement was undoubtedly a life saving talisman for Shu Ya and the Lin Clan. Moreover, even if those existences come to annihilate the Lin Clan and Shu Ya, Shu Ya would have a very good chance to survive because he had Yang Ye’s protection.

Yang Ye said, “Don’t worry about it.”

Yang Ye turned around and vanished into the sky once he finished speaking.

Lin Zhen stood on the spot and looked in the direction Yang Ye had left toward. At this moment, he felt quite fortunate. He felt fortunate that he hadn’t obeyed the Sovereign of Man’s orders and hunted Yang Ye. If he’d done that, everything wouldn’t be the same as it was right now.

No matter what, it was a good outcome now!

…

Yang Ye left the Human Dimension and arrived at the Weapon Dimension.

This time, he encountered the guardian of the Weapon Dimension again. The latter merely glanced at him before moving aside.

Yang Ye wasn’t the same Yang Ye he knew anymore. Sages were of no threat to Yang Ye, and the Weapon Dimension’s guardian was naturally aware of that. So, he didn’t cause trouble for Yang Ye. Of course, he didn’t dare to!

Now, even if Yang Ye killed him, the Weapon Path would probably be unable to do anything to Yang Ye!

Yang Ye didn’t make a fuss about his past experiences with the middle aged man, and he just entered the Weapon Dimension.

As soon as he entered it, a middle aged man appeared before him. The man sized up Yang Ye and said, “Please come with me!”

He turned around and left once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and followed him.

The middle aged man led Yang Ye deep within a bamboo forest.

Deep within the bamboo forest were two bamboo houses. They were facing each other from afar, and a crystal-clear river separated them. There were six people in the air above the river. Yang Ye recognized two of them. One of them was the Weapon Progenitor, and the other was the Sovereign of Sky!

The Sovereign of Sky!

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment and walked over.

The Weapon Progenitor sized up Yang Ye and smiled, “Congratulations, your strength has grown tremendously!”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “I’m still like an ant to you!”

The Weapon Progenitor replied, “You’re being too humble. Please have a seat.”

As soon as he said that, a chair made of water suddenly appeared behind Yang Ye. Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to sit on it. As for the Sovereign of Sky’s group, he ignored them.

While the Sovereign of Sky had quite a gloomy expression because of this, he didn’t say anything.

Meanwhile, the Weapon Progenitor said, “Allow me to introduce everyone. These are respectively the Sovereign of Sky from the sky race, the Shaman Emperor from the shaman race, the Spirit God from the spirit race, the Devil Sovereign of the devil race, and the Demon God of the demon race.”

Yang Ye sized up the people in front of him. While they were all Sages, they were no ordinary Sages. It could be said that all of them were halfway into the Progenitor Realm!

They were true old experts. Of course, the Sovereign of Sky was excluded.

At this moment, the Sovereign of Sky was the one with the least seniority amongst the people in his group.

Yang Ye was looking at them, and they were looking at him.

Their gazes had curiosity in them.

This young man before them was the most dazzling young genius in the large universe.

The Weapon Progenitor said, “I brought all of you here today to discuss some things. I presume all of you are aware that the End Times is gradually arriving, and it won’t be long before the large universe becomes a desolate universe. Yet we’re all still engaging in internal strife at a time like this. If this continues, the large universe will definitely be destroyed. If it’s destroyed, it will definitely not end well for us as well. So, I summoned all of you here because I hope that all of you will stop fighting temporarily and stop acting against each other in secret. What do all of you think?”

He gazed at Yang Ye at this point. Obviously, he wanted to know Yang Ye’s thoughts.

Yang Ye smiled, “Senior, I think what you just said makes a lot of sense. Fighting and killing is absolutely meaningless. The large universe needs peace, and I, Yang Ye, agree to that.”

The Weapon Progenitor glanced at Yang Ye, and then he gazed at the Sovereign of Sky’s group.

The Sovereign of Sky glanced at Yang Ye, “We can have peace, just hand over the Sprite Lord!”

Suddenly, the smile on Yang Ye’s face instantly became icy cold. He flicked off a leaf on his shirt and said, “Sorry, I was just joking. Peace is utterly meaningless. I think we should fight. Killing is fun!”

All of them were stunned speechless by this.
