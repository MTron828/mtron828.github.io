Chapter 2560

Qi Bitian scanned it for a while, yet she still couldn’t recall anything. In the end, she gave up. She kicked it lightly and left.

The Ascension Platform trembled lightly before returning to normal.

Qi Bitian was curious about everything in the Primordial Pagoda. She was extremely curious and took a look at everything in here.

Once she told the others that she was Erya’s friend, the demon beasts and Sprites within the Primordial Pagoda were instantly welcoming toward her.

Once she found out that all the demons had their own territory, she immediately found a perfect place to be her own territory. It was a natural waterfall not too far away from the Sword Sect. She made a bamboo house there, and she even moved the Worldborn Fruit Tree and Chaotic Fruit Tree to the area before her bamboo house.

Those trees were naturally incapable of resisting her!

A bamboo house with a waterfall to its back and two trees in front of it!

Yang Ye allowed Qi Bitian to do as she pleased. Of course, he didn’t have the strength to do otherwise!

Moreover, he didn’t have the time to deal with her.

However, after repeatedly requesting her help, Qi Bitian finally agreed to help him train the dragon and the other demons!

Thus, their days of pain arrived!

Qi Bitian’s method of training was as violent as Erya. It was simple and direct, it was to get beaten up!

Beaten up to the brink of death!

So, howls of pain resounded through the pagoda.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Once Yang Ye received Sword Scroll’s transmission, he’d immediately left the War Dimension and rushed back to the Ancient Sword Sect.

The Ancient Sword Sect.

Sword Scroll, Gu Nan, and the others heaved sighs of relief when they saw Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was the Ancient Sword Sect’s pillar of support now, so nothing could be allowed to happen to him!

Previously, Yang Ye seemed like he’d gone missing, and they’d been extremely anxious throughout this time. Once something happened to Yang Ye, the Ancient Sword Sect wouldn’t be able to resist the Soul Sect at all!

Yang Ye summoned Oblivion Maiden from within the Primordial Pagoda. She wasn’t very interested in the Ancient Sword Sect’s business, and she just went off to look for Nether Maiden and the others.

Once Oblivion Maiden left, Yang Ye gazed at Sword Scroll, “What happened?”

Sword Scroll replied solemnly, “Our disciples have died inexplicably lately.”

“Inexplicable?” Yang Ye frowned slightly, “I need the details!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Not too long ago, a disciple suddenly died miserably. His soul was gone, and his head was placed at the foot of the mountain! But that was just the beginning. After that, more and more disciples died. At this point, 28 of our disciples have just died without making a sound. Presently, our morale is very unstable, especially in the outer court and inner court!”

Yang Ye’s gaze gradually turned icy cold. Obviously, it was the Soul Sect!

The Soul Sect had started taking action again. But they were using a different method!

Yang Ye asked, “Have the formations in the sect been activated?”

She nodded, “Yes, but it didn’t change anything. Our disciples were killed even when the formations were active! Elder Gu Nan even stood guard there, but even he couldn’t find the person responsible for those deaths. It’s very strange!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when a disciple suddenly walked into the hall. The disciple was stunned upon seeing Yang Ye, and then he hurriedly bowed, “Sect Master!”

Yang Ye asked, “Do you need something?”

That disciple spoke solemnly, “Another senior brother of ours is dead!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Take me there!”

Just like that, they arrived at the foot of the mountain. There was a bloody head and corpse there. Both of them were separate!

Just like before, the corpse’s soul was gone!

Yang Ye asked, “Did it just appear here?”

The disciple nodded, “Just a short while ago!”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. Meanwhile, an old man appeared at the side. He was an elder of the sect, and one of the few Lord Realm experts left in the sect! He’d been constantly standing on guard here!

Yang Ye gazed at the old man, and the latter shook his head.

Yang Ye moved his gaze away and activated the Sword Domain!

The Sword Domain enveloped the surroundings, but he still didn’t discover anything!

A short while later, Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, “Just go do what you’re supposed to be doing. I’ll deal with this matter!”

The others exchanged glances and left.

Sword Scroll asked, “Have you discovered something?”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “A little.”

She asked softly, “Are you confident?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Let me try!”

Sword Scroll nodded and left.

Once she left, Yang Ye returned to his above and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye arrived before Qi Bitian’s bamboo house. At this moment, she was kicking a ball, but it wasn’t a human head. It was a ball made of rattan! As for why it wasn’t a human head, it was because Yang Ye told her that kicking a human head would terrify Lei Lin and the others.

Qi Bitian clearly cared quite a bit about Lei Lin, so she gave up kicking human heads and chose to kick the rattan ball Yang Ye prepared for her!

In any case, it was still a ball!

Lei Lin was seated on the steps outside the bamboo house while holding a huge ball of Lightning Essence in her arms. Since that pool of lightning arrived, she’d never lacked Lightning Essence!

Lei Lin’s eyes lit up when she saw Yang Ye, and she hurried over to him, “Big Brother!”

Yang Ye took her in his arms and smiled, “You seem to have grown a little!”

Lei Lin blinked, “Really?”

Yang Ye nodded in an extremely serious manner!

Lei Lim immediately kissed Yang Ye on the cheek, but it electrocuted Yang Ye to the point of shuddering!

Yang Ye quickly placed Lei Lin back on the ground. After she started eating Lightning Essence all day, she frequently released arcs of lightning unconsciously, and they were quite terrifying too. While they weren’t lethal to him, they were absolutely not merely capable of causing a slight tingle!

Qi Bitian glanced at Yang Ye. She didn’t say a word and just continued kicking her ball!

Yang Ye grinned as he walked over to her, “Um… Is your stay comfortable?”

Qi Bitian spoke indifferently, “You need some help, right?”

Yang Ye’s smile stiffened. While she seemed so carefree at most times and seemed like a young girl, just like Erya. However, Yang Ye knew that she was actually very mature! Very, very mature!

But just like Erya, she has some neuroticism!

Yang Ye spoke seriously, “I-I want to seek your guidance in something!”

Qi Bitian continued kicking her ball and remained silent.

Yang Ye continued, “Anyway, I encountered a mysterious person. That person is killing in my Ancient Sword Sect, and that person is able to kill without making a sound. Moreover, even if I use the Sword Domain, I can’t sense that person’s presence at all. So…”

Qi Bitian suddenly said, “Two possibilities. The first is that person’s strength far surpasses your own. As for the second, that person has a special cultivation technique, secret technique, or some other special ability. However, since it was even able to escape detection when you used the Sword Domain, it’s very likely to be a type of Domain.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

A Domain!

The Space Domain!

At this moment, Yang Ye thought of the woman in a black dress!

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Do you know about the Space Domain?”

Qi Bitian nodded.

Yang Ye asked, “Um… So, can you tell me about it?”

Qi Bitian glanced at him, “Why should I?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Qi Bitian continued, “I don’t feel like getting mixed up in a kids’ game!”

A kids’ game!

Yang Ye’s face darkened. The fight between the Ancient Sword Sect and the Soul Sect was just a kids’ game to her!

Yang Ye would naturally not give up just like that. So, he fully displayed the laws of “shamelessness is power”.

Around an hour passed. Yang Ye was still outside the bamboo house. Two hours passed, and he was still there…

In the end, Qi Bitian glanced at Yang Ye, “Do you know how to kick a ball?”

Yang Ye blinked and hurriedly nodded, “Yes, of course!”

Just like that, Yang Ye started to play with Qi Bitian!

They spoke as they played. In the beginning, they spoke about their game of kicking the ball, and as they spoke and spoke, they moved to the Space Domain…

Qi Bitian kicked as she explained, “The Space Domain is a type of Domain. It’s a Domain that uses the Three Dimensional Universe as its foundation, and it’s formed with the space of the Three Dimensional Universe at its core. Simply speaking, someone who has comprehended the Space Domain can temporarily escape Three Dimensional Space. As for your Domain, it can only cover Three Dimensional Space, and it cannot sense space outside Three Dimensional Space.”

Yang Ye took the ball she kicked over to him and casually asked, “The isn’t the Space Domain invincible?”

“Invincible?” Qi Bitian laughed coldly, “It’s just a mere Space Domain, how could it be invincible? Do you know what’s the greatest among all Domains?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “The Sword Domain?”

Qi Bitian glanced at Yang Ye, “Your skin is really thick!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Qi Bitian raised a finger, “Among all the Domains, there isn’t a strongest Domain. Because the strength of a Domain depends on its owner. If someone is strong, then even if that person has no Domain, that person can still kill someone with a Domain. So, Domains are strong because of their owner. But some Domains are extremely special and mysterious. If you encounter them in the future, you should be careful.”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “What Domain?”

Qi Bitian replied, “A Domain known as the Devour Domain. It possesses the ability to devour, and it can even devour the space in the Three Dimensional Universe. However, someone who possesses such a domain wouldn’t dare to act rashly!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Qi Bitian explained, “The Three Dimensional Universe is no fool. How could it possibly allow someone to devour it?”

Yang Ye asked, “Then…”

Bam!

Suddenly, Qi Bitian smashed the rattan ball in front of her!

She glanced coldly at Yang Ye, “Can you let me finish?”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Qi Bitian continued, “Besides that, there is another extremely mysterious Domain. The Temporal Domain that can reverse time. Of course, it’s quite a profound domain that’s difficult to master, and the slightest mistake may even reverse the user out of existence. Right, I just thought of another one, the Death Domain. It can control souls. Once it’s activated, all souls within it would be under the user’s control. Oh, right. There’s another one, the Life Domain. It’s a special Domain that can understand life, measure life, and take life without the other person realizing it.”

She suddenly gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Do you know what Domain I possess?”

Yang Ye shook his head and asked curiously, “What is it?”

Qi Bitian replied, “I don’t want to tell you!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
