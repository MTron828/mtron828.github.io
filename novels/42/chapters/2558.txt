Chapter 2559

The young girl and Lei Lin were clearly a good match, and the two little fellows talked for a long time.

As for the pool of lightning, it clearly feared the young girl quite a bit. It calmed down upon her arrival, and it didn’t even reveal a thread of lightning.

Just like that, the young girl, Qi Bitian, took up residence in the Primordial Pagoda.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had left the abyss, but he didn’t see a sign of that black robed man from the Soul Sect.

Obviously, the black robed man had left!

Yang Ye felt that it was quite a pity. Because he was at the Five World Realm now, and it wasn’t just in his cultivation, his body was at the Five World Realm too. Moreover, the strength of his body wasn’t inferior to the Primal True Dragon!

He really wanted to fight the black robed man!

Battle!

He wanted to fight to his heart’s content!

Unfortunately, that expert from the Soul Sect had left!

Yang Ye didn’t stay here and left.

He went to War City.

However, an old man stopped him before he could even go inside.

The old man was one of the old men who’d helped him stop the Soul Sect’s expert that day. It was all thanks to those two old men that he’d been able to escape that day!

Yang Ye bowed slightly to the old man, “Thank you for the help earlier!”

The old man sized up Yang Ye and said, “You can’t enter the city!”

Yang Ye was stunned and asked, “Why?”

The old man replied indifferently, “You’ve been expelled from the War Dimension!”

Yang Ye spoke with astonishment, “I’ve been expelled? Who did it? Who?”

The old man replied indifferently, “The higher-ups!”

Yang Ye refused to accept it, “Tell them to come out here! I’ll fight them one on one! I…”

Suddenly, a ray of white light shot down from the sky. It was so fast that Yang Ye wasn’t even able to react before it slammed against him.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was blasted over 1km away.

Yang Ye shuddered as he laid there on the ground.

Meanwhile, the old man walked over to Yang Ye, “Do you still want to fight them?”

Yang Ye crawled up slowly from the ground and shot a glance up into the sky. He could sense a pair of eyes staring at him.

Yang Ye moved his gaze away and spoke seriously, “It’s a misunderstanding! It’s just a misunderstanding!”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and sighed softly, “Leave. We broke the rules by interfering before. Moreover, the War Dimension doesn’t hope for the enmity between you and the Soul Sect to be brought here. So, the members of the Soul Sect and the disciples of your sect have been temporarily expelled from the War Dimension. All of you are prohibited from coming here until your business is resolved!”

Yang Ye fell silent.

The old man added, “If the Ancient Sword Sect is unable to avoid destruction in the end, you can come here. So long as you become a member of the War Dimension again, then the higher-ups will keep you alive.”

Yang Ye shot a glance into the sky and smiled, “I appreciate it.”

As he spoke, he gazed at the old man, “Can I go inside the city? Don’t worry, I won’t cause trouble. I just need to conduct some business in the underground trade area. I’ll leave once I’m done.”

The old man hesitated for a moment and nodded.

Yang Ye cupped his fists, “Thank you!”

He entered the city once he finished speaking.

The old man sighed softly on the spot.

Yang Ye went to the underground trade area again, and he met the mysterious figure in that dark house.

Yang Ye went straight to the point, “Where are the people I’m looking for?”

The mysterious figure replied, “We don’t have the whereabouts of two of them. As for the rest, we have practically determined their locations. It won’t take long before they’ll come to you, if they are willing!”

Two hadn’t been found!

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “Which two?”

The mysterious figure said, “Sky Maiden and Blood Maiden. We did locate Blood Maiden previously, but it only took a while for her to vanish again. As for Sky Maiden, we’ll try our best. But the chances of success are slim!”

Sky Maiden! Blood Maiden!

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while and nodded, “Thank you!”

He turned around with the intent of leaving.

Meanwhile, the mysterious figure suddenly said, “You came out of the abyss.”

Yang Ye stopped and gazed at him, “You’re quite amazing to even be aware of that.”

The mysterious figure asked, “Have you been to the bottom of it?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Why?”

The mysterious figure fell silent for a short while and said, “I’ll be frank. If you know what lies at the bottom of that abyss, you can make a trade with me. I…”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Sorry, I don’t know.”

A trade?

Yang Ye knew that Qi Bitian and those two mysterious old men wouldn’t want him to expose their existence to anyone.

The mysterious figure didn’t say anything while Yang Ye shook his head instead, “Don’t ask for something beyond my ability.”

The mysterious figure sighed softly, “Alright. Take care!”

Yang Ye cupped his fist and left.

Not long after Yang Ye left, a voice resounded in the house, “He has definitely been there!”

The mysterious figure replied, “I know!”

The voice spoke once more, “He was actually able to reach the bottom and return alive… He has many other secrets that we aren’t aware of!”

The mysterious figure replied softly, “The universe is boundless, so how much can we even figure out? The bottom of that abyss isn’t part of the Three Dimensional Universe, but it may not be the Four Dimensional Universe… Just take it slow. We’ll figure it out one day.”

The house fell silent.

Yang Ye left the underground trade area but didn’t leave War Dimension right away. He went to see Ye Zhibei and Xing Biqing.

They were meeting up!

They sat cross-legged together at the top of a mountain.

Both Xing Biqing and Ye Zhibei were silent.

Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t make this seem so serious. I’m just here to see both of you. Because I may not get to return once I leave this place.”

Xing Biqing asked, “Were you expelled from the War Dimension?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Xing Biqing spoke softly, “I expected that to happen!”

“You did?” Yang Ye was quite curious, “How did you know?”

She replied softly, “Your identity is quite special. Once you arrived here with the experts of the Soul Sect, you got into a huge battle, and so I knew the War Dimension would definitely not just stand by idly. This place has a single objective, to stay united against our enemies. Even if we train through battle, it’s at a level that is within the control of the higher-ups. But the enmity between you and the Soul Sect is clearly out of their control. So, the best method is to make both of you leave. Both of you can resolve your issues outside the War Dimension and not lead the flames of war into here!”

Yang Ye smiled, “As you expected, I’m afraid I won’t have another chance to return here once I leave.”

Xing Biqing glanced at Yang Ye, “You don’t really have to return to the Ancient Sword Sect! Based on your strength and talent, so long as you’re willing to stay here and stop interfering in the Ancient Sword Sect’s business, then the higher-ups will definitely keep you safe. Even if they refuse to protect you, I can ask the Xing Clan to do it. So long as you’re at my Xing Clan, the Soul Sect would be helpless against you.”

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “I appreciate it, I really do. But I’m sure you’re aware that the sword cultivators of the Ancient Sword Sect have placed their full confidence in me. If I leave now, what would they do? They will become part of the death caused by the Soul Sect.”

Xing Biqing spoke solemnly, “Allow me to be honest, your return may not be able to change anything. The Soul Sect has been growing for countless years, and even my Xing Clan can’t see through them. This time, they are determined to obtain the Ancient Sword Sect. They will stop at nothing to achieve their goal and get that location above the spirit vein, so that they can become one of the great powers of Eternal Kingdom.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Then I’ll just fight them.”

Xing Biqing sighed softly and didn’t say anything else.

Yang Ye glanced at them, “What about the both of you? Are you going to stay in the War Dimension forever?”

Xing Biqing replied, “No, we have to help deal with many things in our clans.”

She seemed to have thought of something at this point. She paused for a moment and asked, “You’ve been to the desolate race?”

Yang Ye glanced at them. Obviously, they knew who he was.

He smiled, “I have!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Xing Biqing asked, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye replied softly, “The desolate is very strong, and their patriarch is unfathomably strong.”

They fell silent.

Yang Ye added, “Moreover, there is just one voice in the desolate race. They are very united. But Eternal Kingdom has many different voices.”

Meanwhile, Ye Zhibei, who’d been silent until now, spoke abruptly, “Actually, Eternal Kingdom is very united too!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she spoke softly, “The Eternal Lord Token!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “The Eternal Lord Token?”

Xing Biqing smiled, “It’s a command token. Every organization, clan, and person in Eternal Kingdom must obey it. Even the Soul Sect has to obey it. It’s the main reason why they exist in Eternal Kingdom. If they refuse to acknowledge that command token, they would have never been able to survive here. Of course, the command token cannot be used to interfere with the internal affairs of any power. It’s only to be used in the fight against the desolate race.”

The Eternal Lord Token!

Yang Ye asked, “Where’s the Eternal Lord? In the Xing Clan?”

The two of them exchanged glances and shook their heads. Even they didn’t know the answer to that.

Yang Ye had more questions, but he suddenly frowned slightly, and then he stood up.

Xing Biqing asked, “Has something happened?”

Yang Ye nodded and spoke solemnly, “Something happened in the Ancient Sword Sect. I must rush back immediately. Until we meet again.”

Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

They exchanged glances and sighed softly.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

While Yang Ye left the War Dimension, the young girl, Qi Bitian, had arrived at the Ascension Platform. She glanced at it and muttered softly, “Why does this look quite familiar?”
