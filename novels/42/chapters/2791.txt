Chapter 2792 – I Can Carry On!

Yang Ye!

Monarch Yan hadn’t allowed the experts behind him to attack because of Yang Ye!

Yang Ye was the greatest threat to the Four Dimensional Universe in Universe City!

Besides him, all the other Destiny Realm experts were practically incapable of stopping more than one attack from Yang Ye. If they were to be sent down there rashly, then if Yang Ye were to show himself, it was very likely to cause a terrible amount of losses!

He could only launch a full-scale attack once Yang Ye showed himself!

However, Yang Ye still didn’t show himself!

In the city.

Ding Shaoyao glanced at Monarch Yan, “We need to continue buying time!”

Meanwhile, An Nanjing appeared by her side.

Ding Shaoyao’s expression changed slightly, “You…”

She spoke softly, “Besides me, no one else can fight him.”

An Nanjing shot up into the air upon finishing speaking.

Ding Shaoyao’s face turned extremely unsightly because she knew what An Nanjing meant to Yang Ye!

If anything were to happen to An Nanjing, she couldn’t imagine what would happen to Yang Ye.

However, it was as An Nanjing had said, no one else could fight Monarch Yan!

A spear shot toward Monarch Yan.

Dagger-Axe!

An Nanjing was behind the spear.

Monarch Yan gazed at the spear with indifference, and then he stretched out his right hand slowly. There was a ball of fiery red lightning in his grasp!

As soon as the spear arrived, Monarch Yan slapped his palm against the spear.

Bang!

The spear shook violently while blood sprayed from An Nanjing’s mouth. She twisted the spear in her grasp. At the same time, the fiery red lightning in Monarch Yan’s grasp surged toward Dagger-Axe.

An Nanjing’s expression changed. She was about to pull her spear back, but Monarch Yan suddenly grabbed the tip of her spear and twisted it.

Bam!

An Nanjing was blasted away, and a wave of fiery lightning swept at her.

An Nanjing’s eyes narrowed slightly. She squatted down slightly while clenching her right fist and twisting her left. In an instant, a wave of powerful energy appeared here.

Martial Release!

Rumble!

The waves of energy she released forcibly stopped the wave of fiery lightning. Meanwhile, a figure flashed out from within the fiery lightning.

An Nanjing’s pupils constricted as she slammed her right fist forward!

Bang!

An Nanjing’s arm shook violently while her figure was blasted away. Meanwhile, a hand grabbed her right hand. An Nanjing wasn’t even able to react before her right arm had been forcibly pulled out!

Blood sprayed like a fountain from her shoulder!

Ding Shaoyao’s expression changed drastically from the sight of this, “Go!”

As soon as she gave the order, two figures appeared on either side of Monarch Yan.

It was Cang Mu and Sha Ji.

Monarch Yan grinned coldly as he slapped his palms in either direction.

Bang! Bang!

Cang Mu and Sha Ji were blasted away before they could even get close to him.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

They practically didn’t have the ability to fight back!

Suddenly, an afterimage slammed itself at him!

It was An Nanjing!

Ding Shaoyao and the others instantly turned pale from the sight of this because An Nanjing had actually refused to flee!

Monarch Yan gazed at An Nanjing and spoke coldly, “You’re courting death!”

As soon as he said that, he clenched his right hand. In an instant, his entire arm turned fiery red. He hadn’t even slammed it forward when a strand of powerful flaming energy had forced An Nanjing to a stop!

At the instant Monarch Yan was about to swing his punch, An Nanjing suddenly pressed her left palm against her forehead, and then she pressed down slowly, “Divine Martial Style!”

As soon as she said that, her figure turned ethereal. At this instant, countless overlapped images of An Nanjing appeared all around Monarch Yan!

They overlapped in countless layers, and every one of them slapped their palms at him!

Bang!

Monarch Yan was pushed back repeatedly and stopped quite far away!

Everyone was stunned by this scene!

She’s that strong?

Suddenly, Ding Shaoyao’s expression changed drastically, “Watch out!”

As soon as she said that, Monarch Yan suddenly vanished on the spot, and then a shadow arrived before An Nanjing.

Her eyes narrowed slightly. She raised her left hand and slammed it down like a saber.

Countless afterimages overlapped!

Monarch Yan clenched his right fist and slammed it forward. Fiery red lightly sprayed from his fist.

Bang!

A violent wave of energy appeared in the sky, and the entire sky cracked open.

Boom!

A moment later, the afterimages around An Nanjing vanished, and her figure crashed down from above!

Meanwhile, Monarch Yan charged after her!

Ding Shaoyao’s voice resounded from the city, “Stop him!”

Bang!

A wave of light surged up into the air in Monarch Yan’s direction! The latter frowned slightly, and then he slapped his right palm at it!

Bang!

A wave of fiery lightning rippled out!

Rumble!

The wave of light shook violently and shattered.

Monarch Yan dived down from the sky while horrifying fiery red lightning surged around him. He was like a comet!

“Stop him!” Chen Dao’zi’s voice resounded, “Don’t let him charge down here or this place will be destroyed!”

Stop him?

Everyone here was puzzled. Who could possibly do that?

How would they do that?

Destiny Realm experts were weaker than ants before Monarch Yan!

Meanwhile, Monarch Yan was getting closer!

At this moment, Universe City had started to crack!

Suddenly, a figure appeared before Monarch Yan. It was a woman, and she waved her right hand down.

A moment of silence ensued, and then she raised her right hand.

Boom!

A wave of powerful energy forcibly stopped Monarch Yan!

It was Yang Busi!

She glanced at Monarch Yan. Meanwhile, the latter suddenly appeared before her and punched.

Monstrous fiery lightning enveloped Yang Busi!

Boom!

A moment of silence ensued, and then the fiery lightning exploded apart and rippled through the sky like fireworks. Everywhere it passed, thin cracks were incinerated open in space! It was an absolutely shocking sight!

Meanwhile, two figures flickered incessantly in the sky. They were so fast that others couldn’t see them clearly at all.

Ding Shaoyao went over to An Nanjing who only had one arm now, “Are you alright?”

An Nanjing shook her head slightly, “How is he?”

She replied softly, “He hasn’t shown any signs of regaining consciousness!”

An Nanjing spoke softly, “Don’t disturb him. He has definitely encountered something, and it probably requires time to resolve. Once it’s resolved, his Sword Dao may advance further.”

Ding Shaoyao laughed bitterly, “I’m afraid we can’t hold on until then. We don’t have any top-rate experts left. Tian Xiu and Qi Bitian cannot be contacted either. Besides them, no one else is a match for Monarch Yan. And…”

She glanced at the surroundings, “We still have to worry about that mysterious expert. He’s definitely watching from the shadows. While he hasn’t made a move yet, he’s definitely waiting for Yang Ye, or Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu.”

An Nanjing looked up at the sky, “It’s fine, I can deal with it.”

Ding Shaoyao hesitated to say something.

Boom!

Two figures split apart in midair!

Yang Busi and Monarch Yan stood 300m away from each other. At this moment, her countenance was pale while blood could be seen on the corner of her mouth. Moreover, her body had cracked open!

After a few collisions, she’d been heavily injured!

Yang Busi glanced at Monarch Yan, “You’re really strong!”

Monarch Yan replied indifferently, “You’re not weak yourself. This has nothing to do with you, so why give your life away?”

Yang Busi smiled, “That fellow down there is a junior of my clan. As his ancestor, I naturally have to help him. Besides that, I can’t stand the sight of the Four Dimensional Universe. Is that reason enough for you?”

Monarch Yan replied indifferently, “Then die!”

As soon as he said that, he’d vanished on the spot. Meanwhile, a ferocious grin appeared on the corners of Yang Busi’s mouth as she slapped her palms together.

Boom!

In an instant, the space around her shook violently, and a wave of energy rippled out. Meanwhile, Monarch Yan’s fist slammed against the energy.

A head-on collision!

Boom!

As soon as they collided, it was like a volcanic eruption. The entire sky above the city was obliterated.

Suddenly, a huge dragon made of fiery red lightning emerged from the black hole in space, and it blotted out the sky!

The lightning dragon didn’t charge at Yang Busi, and it crashed down toward the city instead.

Hiss!

Everywhere it passed, space was scorched black.

Ding Shaoyao said, “Attack!”

All the other Destiny Realm experts charged up into the air. While the lightning dragon was formidable, a few dozen Destiny Realm experts had no need to fear it!

Suddenly, Ding Shaoyao’s expression changed drastically as she turned around swiftly, “Yang Ye’s in danger!”

As soon as she said that, An Nanjing vanished on the spot. A shadow was charging toward Yang Ye’s figure that was seated cross-legged on the ground.

An Nanjing couldn’t make it in time!

The Sword Precursor shook violently in front of Yang Ye, and then it transformed into a ray of light that shot at the shadow!

It was protecting its master!

The shadow tapped its right index finger forward, and it tapped against the Sword Precursor.

Bang!

The Sword Precursor shook violently and was blasted away.

Meanwhile, a little fellow appeared before Yang Ye. It was Snowy.

Snowy held the Sprite Staff in her grasp as she stared at the approaching shadow. Her tiny figure was trembling. She was terrified because she knew that she was no match for the shadow. However, she was the strongest in the Primordial Pagoda right now!

Moreover, Yang Ye was behind her!

Even though she was terrified, Snowy refused to take a single step back. She just waved her paw, and then rays of spirit energy converged before her. However, along with the arrival of the shadow, the spirit energy vanished without a trace.

Meanwhile, a black palm grabbed her by the throat and lifted her up.

Snowy’s eyes opened wide while her spirit energy was dispersing rapidly at a visible rate, and even the color in her eyes had started to gradually vanish.
