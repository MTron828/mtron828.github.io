Chapter 2207 – Let’s Fight One on One If Your Dare!

Shi Tian and the others’ expressions became extremely unsightly when they heard Yang Ye.

Mutual destruction!

The god race did have the ability to do that.

It didn’t even need the entire god race, just Shi Tian alone could annihilate everyone on Void Spirit Continent. However, Yang Ye could annihilate everyone in the god race besides Shi Tian as well. The only way to avoid that was for Shi Tian to annihilate Yang Ye!

However, they noticed that based on the current situation, that was impossible!

Not to mention Yang Ye’s own strength, he had numerous treasures too. Especially the Primordial Pagoda, it was something that even Shi Tian had to fear! Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

So, if he chose to kill Yang Ye, then the best outcome would be successfully killing Yang Ye at the cost of suffering serious injuries.

But once that happened, the three Paths, the Alliance of All, and the undying race would never allow such an opportunity to escape them!

So, after weighing the pros and cons, Shi Tian made his decision!

Shi Tian gazed at Yang Ye, and then he waved his right hand. A ray of white light flashed, and it descended before Yang Ye.

The white light dispersed to reveal Snowy.

As soon as she saw Yang Ye, Snowy started crying and holding on tight to Yang Ye’s neck while ceaselessly rubbing her head against his chin.

She’d never left Yang Ye for this long, so this period could be described as the darkest days for Snowy.

Yang Ye rubbed her head gently. At this moment, his slaughter intent dispersed.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “It’s alright now. Let’s go home!”

He took Snowy in his arms and turned around.

“Yang Ye!” Suddenly, Shi Tian called out to him.

Yang Ye stopped.

Shi Tian spoke coldly, “I’ll remember this!”

Yang Ye turned around, gave Shi Tian the middle finger, and then vanished on the spot with Snowy.

Shi Tian’s face instantly turned gloomy. At this moment, the slaughter intent he emanated wasn’t much weaker than Yang Ye’s!

He, Shi Tian, had never suffered something like this!

…

Meanwhile, Heaven Secret shook his head, “He’s so difficult to deal with!”

Zhong Ye nodded, “His temper is terrible!”

Heaven Secret shook his head, “Do you know what I like the most about him?”

Zhong Ye gazed at Heaven Secret.

“His sincere heart!” The old man spoke softly, “He's very loyal. His Sword Dao may seem like it’s a Sword Dao of slaughter, but it’s actually one with emotion. The reason he could attain the Progenitor Realm in slaughter intent was because his emotions were so strong. He couldn’t endure the pain from losing his friends, so it turned into slaughter intent. Otherwise, just killing alone would be incapable of allowing him to attain the Progenitor Realm in slaughter intent. If killing was sufficient to attain that, the world would be in chaos by now.”

Zhong Ye glanced at Yang Ye’s leaving figure, “He’s a pitiable person too!”

Heaven Secret nodded, “Have you noticed? To be honest, as far as I know, I’ve never heard of a Sprite Lord that relies on a person and trusts a person that much. Sprite Lords are one of the most intelligent beings in the world, so how could someone she chose be an absolutely evil person?”

He looked up at the direction Yang Ye had left toward and continued, “Now that the large universe is in such chaos, it’s time for us to choose sides.”

Zhong Ye laughed bitterly, “He doesn’t need us now!”

The old man grinned, “He will, very soon. Come on, let’s go do one last thing, and then we’ll go side with him!”

The old man turned around and left.

They returned to the Weapon Dimension, but it had collapsed now. Zhong Ye had quite complicated emotions in his eyes as he gazed at the ruins of the Weapon Dimension. It was once his home, but it was gone now!

The old man suddenly said, “You don’t own the Weapon Path anything. It was the Weapon Progenitor’s own choices which led to the Weapon Path’s current state.”

Zhong Ye nodded and remained silent.

The old man walked down slowly, and then he flicked. In an instant, the scene here changed, and then a huge Go board appeared before them.

Zhong Ye gazed at Heaven Secret, “What’s that?”

The old man replied softly, “The Heaven End Go Board!”

“The Heaven End Go Board?” Zhong Ye frowned, “I’ve never heard of it!”

The old man grinned, “It’s my life’s work.”

Zhong Ye glanced at heaven Secret, “Senior, you stayed in the Weapon Path for this?”

The old man nodded.

Zhong Ye asked, “Why did you choose the Weapon Path?”

The old man smiled, “The energy of slaughter. Among the four Paths, the Weapon Path has the strongest aura of slaughter, and this treasure needs the aura of slaughter. The more, the better.”

Zhong Ye spoke softly, “Senior, you made this yourself?”

The old man shook his head, “I obtained it by chance.”

As he spoke, he gazed at the Heaven End Go Board, “In order to repair it, I gave up Heaven Secret Hall and came here. But this process… Even I’ve forgotten how long it took. No matter what, it has finally been repaired.”

Zhong Ye spoke softly, “Senior, do you really plan to go to Yang Ye?”

The old man walked over to Zhong Ye’s side and patted Zhong Ye on the shoulder, “I know what you’re thinking. Don’t worry, I don’t have any ill intent toward him, nor do I seek anything from him. The undying race is back, and besides that person, no one else can survive alone. I can’t, and neither can you. We’re going to Yang Ye because I hope he’ll be able to create a path to survival for us.”

Zhong Ye asked, “Is the undying race really that strong?”

“Strong?” The old man shook his head, “They aren’t just strong! Just wait and see, the apocalypse is here, it’s truly here. Let’s go!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand and put the Go board away. Meanwhile, Zhong Ye suddenly asked, “Senior, you spoke about a certain person who could survive on his own. Who is that person?”

Heaven Secret’s footsteps stopped momentarily, and he replied, “A sword cultivator who doesn’t use a sword!”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

A sword cultivator who doesn’t use a sword!

Zhong Ye was bewildered!

…

Yang Ye took Snowy back to Void Spirit Continent, and the news of his actions on God Realm had spread throughout the large universe!

Yang Ye’s name reverberated through the large universe once more!

Was there a power in the large universe that Yang Ye didn’t dare to offend?

The answer was no!

As far as the Alliance of All was concerned, their fear for Yang Ye grew!

Including the Weapon Path and Buddhist Path, both of them were living in the Dao Dimension now, and they felt even stronger fear of Yang Ye. Now, they would rather offend the god race than offend Yang Ye!

That madman dared to do just about anything now!

Void Spirit Continent.

Yang Ye descended to the ground with Snowy. Snowy frowned because there was no spirit energy here.

She waved her paw lightly.

Yang Ye understood what she meant. He hesitated for a moment and nodded before speaking softly, “Just in the city!”

Snowy cracked a smile and waved her paws. In an instant, countless strands of spirit energy swept out of her, and it only took a short while for spirit energy to actually appear in the city.

The humans in the city were stunned when they sensed it.

Spirit energy!

Where did it come from?

However, it didn’t take long for them to understand why spirit energy had appeared here.

Snowy!

The Sprite Lord was back!

Thus, Snowy’s status in Void Spirit City instantly rose. It could be said that as far as everyone here was concerned, Snowy’s status was much higher than Yang Ye.

Everyone adored Snowy!

That was how they treated Snowy now!

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Snowy’s return filled the Primordial Pagoda with spirit energy, causing the pagoda to be overjoyed and fly circles around Snowy.

Yang Ye saw on the ground with Snowy, and before him was a fire. There was a goat on the fire.

Roasting a whole goat!

Snowy and Tian Xiu’s favorite!

Snowy stared at it, and she even started to drool!

As he watched Snowy act like that, Yang Ye had a rare smile on his face. The little fellow before him was a loved one, one of his closest loved ones.

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something and rubbed Snowy’s little head, “Will the spirit energy vanish?”

Snowy gazed at Yang Ye, shook her head lightly, and then started waving her paws!

It wouldn’t vanish!

Or to be more precise, so long as she was here, the spirit energy wouldn’t vanish, but it would vanish if she left. The spirit energy hadn’t come from the world, it had come from her, and she couldn’t create an endless supply of it. Of course, it wasn’t a problem to provide spirit energy for the city for a few dozen years. Moreover, so long as there was spirit energy somewhere else, she could move it over here.

Yang Ye rubbed her head, “Is it very tiring?”

Snowy shook her head, but it didn’t take long for her to swiftly nod. After that, she pointed at the roasting goat and indicated that it was very, very tiring to maintain the spirit energy, so she needed to have roasted goat every day!

Yang Ye grinned, rubbed her head, and said, “I’ll roast it every day for you!”

Snowy’s eyes lit up, and then she hugged Yang Ye and kept kissing him.

Suddenly, Yang Ye frowned and looked up. He fell silent for an instant, and then he rubbed Snowy’s head and said, “I’m going to take care of some business. I’ll be back soon. Be good!”

Snowy nodded.

Yang Ye grinned and left the pagoda.

Once he arrived outside, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that shot up into the sky above the city. He looked up, and he saw a few dozen specks of black light shooting over in his direction.

Undying cavalries!

A few dozen of them!

Yang Ye frowned slightly, and then he grabbed his sword and swung it. In an instant, a ray of blood red sword energy slashed up into the air.

Yang Ye glanced coldly at the specks of black light, and it didn’t take long for a few dozen undying cavalries to descend before Yang Ye.

There were a total of 40 of them!

They were led by that same undying cavalry whom Yang Ye had fought the other day!

Yang Ye shook his head, “Is this how the undying race acts? You’re no match for me so you gang up on me?”

As he spoke, he pointed his sword at them, “I, Yang Ye, hate people who gang up on others. Let’s fight one on one if you dare!”
