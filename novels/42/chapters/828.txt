Chapter 829 – Yang Ye’s A Big Liar!

Translator: InVader

Editor: Conspiracing

“Do you think anyone in Pine Prefecture can surpass the disciples of our Ancient Sword School in the Sword Dao?” Yang Ye walked step by step towards the green clothed man while ceaselessly swinging his sword about, and the sword seemed as if it had come to life and emanated numerous sword howls.

The man spoke in a low voice, “Then why don’t you carry the token of the Ancient Sword School!?”

“What a joke!” Yang Ye stopped moving and laughed coldly, “The disciples of my Ancient Sword School only need their swords. The Sword Token of the sec? For what? To domineer over others? Or to use it as a form of reliance and support so that everyone would be respectful towards the disciples of our sect? How laughable! As a disciple of the Ancient Sword School, our greatest reliance is the sword, and it’s our greatest backing!”

When he spoke up to this point, Yang Ye pointed at Zi Xin and the others before he said, “Ask yourself this question. Would they be so respectful towards you if you weren’t a disciple of the Ancient Sword School?”

The green clothed man fell silent. His fists were clenched tightly, and his nails had sunk deep into his palm.

Yang Ye continued, “You’ve fallen into a pit yet still do not realize it. If that continues, then how will you stay true to your heart and train in the sword?”

A short while passed before the man suddenly bowed slightly to Yang Ye and said, “Thank you for the guidance, Senior Brother. Ling Xing will never forget this kindness!”

Clamorous noise erupted in the surroundings because the green clothed man’s words represented that Yang Ye really was a disciple of the Ancient Sword School!

Actually, in the opinions of Li Qingyi, Fan Li, and the others, it wasn’t very difficult to accept that Yang Ye was from the Ancient Sword School. Because his attainments in the Sword Dao were truly too terrifying. So, how could the Ancient Sword School let such a genius in the Sword Dao within Pine Prefecture escape their grasps? Thus, they felt at ease instead when the green clothed man acknowledged Yang Ye’s identity.

I’ve really become a huge liar after I arrived at the Radiant Dimension! Yang Ye heaved a slight sigh of relief in his heart. While he’d advanced to the high rank of the Spirit Realm, his sword intent hadn’t recovered at all. Moreover, he couldn’t utilize the Sword Domain and the Decay Laws he possessed. After all, both of them exhausted a huge amount of profound energy, and based on the current state of his meridians, he didn’t dare to utilize them at all.

So, if this fellow called Ling Xing fought him to the death, then even if he could win, he would probably have to pay a terrible price.

“Wait! My Beastmaster Sect inquired about him. There’s no disciple called Yang Ye on Heavenly Sword Peak!” Zi Xin spoke abruptly in a grim tone, “Moreover, if he really is the disciple of Daoist Gu from Heavenly Sword Peak, then how could he possibly not be known?”

Ling Xing frowned when he heard this. At the same time, Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly while he tightened his grasp on his sword.

Meanwhile, Zi Xin continued, “Actually, it’s very simple to find out the truth. Senior Brother Ling just has to send a transmission talisman to Heavenly Sword Peak to inquire about him. Wouldn’t the truth be revealed then?”

A strand of killing intent flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes as he gazed at Zi Xin. He wanted to kill her right now but doing that would be equivalent to exposing himself. While he wasn’t afraid of the Ancient Sword School, he didn’t want to drag Fan Meng into trouble!

“That works!” Meanwhile, Ling Xing bowed slightly to Yang Ye and said, “Senior Brother Yang, while I believe in your identity, this matter has great implications. So, I must confirm it. So long as Senior Brother’s identity is confirmed, then I’ll personally eliminate these members of the Beastmaster Sect and apologize to Senior Brother!”

He waved his right hand as he spoke, and a golden talisman shot into the air. It expanded in midair, and then numerous fluctuations swept out from it and caused space to ripple. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Everyone was looking at the golden talisman because they would soon find out if Yang Ye was really a disciple of the Ancient Sword School.

Fan Meng gazed at Yang Ye, and she instantly calmed down when she saw how calm and composed he was.

On the other hand, Li Qingyi and Fan Li frowned because they felt that something was off. After all, if Yang Ye really did belong to the Ancient Sword School, then he would definitely have something to prove it. Moreover, Yang Ye seemed to show no intention to do so. Most importantly, Ling Xing had sent the transmission talisman, and it meant that even he doubted Yang Ye’s identity!

Zi Xin had a cold smile on her face as she gazed at Yang Ye, and it was like she was looking at a dead man. She couldn’t deny that Yang Ye was extremely strong. But so what? Could he fight the Ancient Sword School? So long as it was proved that he didn’t belong to the Ancient Sword School, then even a Saint Realm expert would die!

The honor of the Ancient Sword School allowed no disrespect!

A short while passed before a voice suddenly resounded from within the golden talisman, “Ling Xing, I know what you’re asking about. My Heavenly Sword Peak doesn’t have a disciple called Yang Ye!”

Ling Xing’s expression changed, and he swiftly gazed at Yang Ye while killing intent appeared in his eyes.

Meanwhile, Zi Xin roared madly with laughter, “Yang Ye, you’re dead. Not only you, everyone related to you is dead as well. Hahaha!”

At this moment, Zi Xin seemed like she’d gone mad. Yang Ye had killed her martial uncle and torn off her arm, so how could she not feel happy when she could finally watch him die?"

Meanwhile, Li Qingyi, Fan Li, and the others had grim expressions on their faces while they gazed at Yang Ye with disbelief. Moreover, Fan Meng had even turned pale from fright!

Yang Ye tightened his grip on the hilt of his sword and was about to attack.

Suddenly, a voice resounded once more from within the talisman, “While my Heavenly Sword Peak doesn’t have a disciple called Yang Ye, but Daoist Gu did indeed accept a disciple not too long ago. I just don’t know if it’s this Yang Ye you speak about.”

The profound energy within Yang Ye stopped surging when he heard this, and then he gazed at the golden talisman. Meanwhile, panic started to appear in Zi Xin’s heart. She stared fixedly at the golden talisman as if she was deeply afraid of hearing something terrifying.

“Daoist Gu accepted a new disciple?” asked Ling Xing.

“Yes, Daoist Gu left the peak not too long ago, and he said that he’d found a peerless genius when he returned. He even said that the peerless genius he found wasn’t inferior to Senior Sister Lu at all. Unfortunately, he refused to say who it was. In any case, he’s really fond of this new disciple of his. He even said that he wants to forge a peerless sword for his disciple and went into closed door cultivation to forge it so that his disciple would shock the world upon entering our sword school....”

“Thank you, Master!” Suddenly, Yang Ye spoke while his eyes had a trace of sadness and gratefulness in them.

“Yang Ye! Stop the fucking act!” Zi Xin roared furiously, “On what basis do you say that you’re Daoist Gu’s disciple? What’s your proof?”

“Right, I remember now!” Meanwhile, the voice resounded once more from the golden talisman, “While I don’t know if he’s Daoist Gu’s disciple, I do know that Daoist Gu said his disciple possesses the Enlightened Sword Heart. If he possesses the Enlightened Sword Heart, then he should really be that person!”

“Haha!” Zi Xin started roaring with laughter once more while madness filled her eyes, “Yang Ye, do you possess the Enlightened Sword Heart? Do you? Do you? HAHAHA!”

“I really do!” Yang Ye spoke truthfully.

“Ptooey!” She roared furiously, “You still intend to put on an act when death is imminent? They say life is like a show, and it’s filled with acting. Yang Ye, your acting is truly the best!”

Yang Ye paid no attention to her. He gazed at Ling Xing and said, “Do you want to give it a try?”

Unexpectedly, Ling Xing shook his head and bowed respectfully to Yang Ye, “Ling Xing greets Senior Brother Yang!”

Earlier, he was quite puzzled by the fact that his techniques were so weak before Yang Ye. Now, he understood everything. Yang Ye possessed the Enlightened Sword Heart, and that was why his techniques were crushed with such ease.

Yang Ye placed his right hand behind his back while he pressed his sword against his chest, and then he gazed at Ling Xing, “Do you understand why I didn’t want to expose my identity now?”

Ling Xing laughed bitterly as he nodded. After all, how could he not understand? Didn’t that person from Heavenly Sword Peak say so earlier? Daoist Gu had concealed Yang Ye’s identity so that Yang Ye could put on a shocking display.... Yet now, he’d forced Yang Ye’s identity to be revealed, and he could only wonder how terrible the consequences would be once Daoist Gu found out!

A cold glow flashed through his eyes when he thought up to this point, and then a ray of light shot out from his sword chest. Of course, it wasn’t aimed at Yang Ye but Zi Xin’s group!

“Run!” At practically the exact same instant, a middle aged man who stood behind Zi Xin shouted furiously. However, Zi Xin and the other middle aged men had already shot towards the distance.

“Shadow Steps!” Ling Xing roared with fury before he vanished on the spot.

Less than 10 minutes passed before Ling Xing returned with a few heads, and he tossed them on the ground before he said, “I’m sorry. I allowed that woman called Zi Xin to escape. I never expected her to actually carry a Random Teleportation Talisman!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he glanced at Ling Xing, “Do you have extreme-grade energy stones? The more the better!”

Ling Xing was slightly stunned, and then he withdrew a spatial ring and flicked it over to Yang Ye, “There are 1,200 extreme-grade energy stones in there. I hope they will be able to help Senior Brother!”

Yang Ye took it and grinned, “Thank you. I’ll definitely return you double that in the future!”

“While our Ancient Sword School is divided into 9 peaks, we’re still one big family in the end. Since Senior Brother has some difficulties, then I as the junior brother should naturally help out!” Ling Xing continued, “Since it was a misunderstanding, then I’ll be saying my farewells now. Senior Brother, feel free to visit me at Verdant City Peak if you have the time.”

“As for meeting me....” Ling Xing spoke before Yang Ye could finish speaking, “I understand. Don’t worry, Senior Brother. I won’t tell anyone about what happened today!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and then he said, “May I know if Brother Ling has Dao Rank swords? After all, my Master is still forging a sword for me. So....”

Ling Xing hesitated for a moment before patting the sword chest on his back, and 2 swords shot out from within it and arrived before Yang Ye. He said, “Both of them are mid-grade Dao Rank swords, and I haven’t formed a connection with them yet. So, they just happen to be suitable to be given to Senior Brother....”

Yang Ye took them while the smile on his face grew even brighter, “Brother Ling, I also need....”

Meanwhile, Fan Meng couldn’t bear to watch any longer....
