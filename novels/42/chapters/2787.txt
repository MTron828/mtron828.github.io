Chapter 2788 – Snowy, Be Good From Now On!

Bam!

Erya was blasted away!

Meanwhile, Snowy was stunned!

A moment later, she charged over. At the same time, Erya crawled up from the ground, and there was blood coming from her eyes, nostrils, and ears!

Her physical defenses were formidable, and very few could do anything to her. However, if she attacked herself…

When she saw Snowy appear before her again, Erya glanced coldly at Snowy, and then she grabbed the tanghulu in Snowy’s grasp before vanishing into the distance.

Evolution!

Her body was at the most critical moment of her evolution, so her intuition made her choose to leave immediately.

Snowy was stunned as she watched Erya vanish into the distance.

Bang!

Suddenly, a figure slammed into the ground before her.

It was Yang Ye!

At this moment, Yang Ye was in a terrible state. He was covered in blood. Especially his arms, they had cracked open and had severely warped. Even the bones within them could be seen very clearly.

Snowy was stunned by the sight of this.

An instant later, she gazed at the mysterious expert who was charging in their direction. She was about to charge with the Sprite Staff, but Yang Ye suddenly stood up. He grabbed her and tossed her into the Primordial Pagoda!

In the Primordial Pagoda, Snowy descended firmly onto the Ascension Platform. She rolled on it quite a bit before finally crawling up to her feet. After that, she was about to charge out again, but the woman in white stopped her.

The little fellow would just be causing trouble if she was allowed to head outside right now!

Snowy waved her paws swiftly while anxiety covered her face.

The woman in white spoke softly, “I know, don’t worry!”

Snowy was still waving her paws. Moreover, her eyes kept wandering off into the surroundings. Obviously, she was prepared to run at any moment!

The woman in white rubbed Snowy’s head, looked up at the sky, and her eyes gradually turned icy cold!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda, the mysterious expert suddenly stopped and turned around. Meanwhile, a woman arrived before him!

It was Tian Xiu!

Tian Xiu formed a seal and spoke softly, “Omni Ruin!”Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Bang!

In an instant, the space around the mysterious expert exploded apart inch by inch. Countless rays of dark light surged toward the mysterious expert!

Meanwhile, the mysterious expert pressed his index and middle finger together, and then he tapped it forward, “Annihilation of Life!”

As soon as his finger descended, the mass of dark light suddenly stopped. It was like they had been frozen there!

A moment later, countless specks of black that seemed like snowflakes appeared here. Along with their arrival, the dark light started to be obliterated inch by inch. In just a short while, all the dark light had completely vanished without a trace!

Meanwhile, a shadow flashed through the black specks!

Bang!

Tian Xiu was blasted away!

The afterimage charged at Tian Xiu’s figure again. However, a ray of sword energy suddenly slammed down at it!

The afterimage stopped, turned around swiftly, and then raised his right hand lightly. A speck of black light shot forward.

Bang!

The sword energy shattered!

The mysterious expert looked in Yang Ye’s direction and pressed his palms down slightly. In an instant, countless black specks of light appeared around Yang Ye! These black specks of light were extremely terrifying, and every one of them contained horrifying energy!

Yang Ye’s face was rather ferocious at this moment. While he was seriously injured, there was no fear in his eyes!

Yang Ye held the Sword Precursor in his right grasp while blood surged incessantly toward it!

Suddenly, the black specks of light started moving rapidly in Yang Ye’s direction.

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted. He was about to swing his sword when a white shadow suddenly flashed before him, and then rays of sword energy bloomed before him like lotuses!

The woman in white!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

A horrifying wave of shattering resounded.

After being locked in a stalemate against the black specks of light for a few breaths of time, the lotuses around Yang Ye started to gradually wither and be obliterated!

At the same time, Yang Ye noticed that the woman in white’s countenance had practically instantly turned ghastly pale!

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to take a step forward, and then a wave of mysterious energy appeared here.

The Sword Domain!

As soon as he unleashed the Sword Domain, Yang Ye’s face warped because he was heavily injured right now. Forcibly utilizing the Sword Domain could be said to be beyond the limits of his body!

But he had practically no choice right now!

It was the time to risk his life. If he didn’t risk it now, then he would lose it soon after. If he risked it now, he may have a chance to survive!

At the instant the Sword Domain appeared, the specks of black light seemed to show signs of being suppressed, but just an instant later, they started to fight back crazily. At this moment, Yang Ye almost lost consciousness!

Yang Ye bit the tip of his tongue and forced himself to stay awake. After that, she stabbed his sword forward.

An attack that carried his full strength!

Bang!

A wave of powerful sword intent, slaughter intent, and blood red sword energy rippled out like a wave in the Sword Domain!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Explosions resounded incessantly through the area. At the same time, countless rays of sword energy and various other forms of energy rippled madly in all directions. Everywhere they passed, space was practically obliterated in an instant!

It was extremely shocking!

The mysterious expert didn’t try to attack again and just shot backward. After that, he waved his right hand, and the wave of energy that arrived before him was instantly turned into nothingness!

At this moment, the mysterious expert’s aura was actually slightly stronger than before!

Yang Ye was supporting himself up by pressing both hands against his sword, and blood was seeping out incessantly from the corners of his mouth. His body was covered in cracks, even his face had cracked completely. It was an absolutely horrifying sight.

The woman in white and Tian Xiu were in front of him.

On the other side, Qi Bitian was in a fierce battle against Monarch Yan. However, she was being suppressed right now!

Meanwhile, the woman in white waved her right hand, and Past Life suddenly shot forward.

Monarch Yan suddenly stopped, and then he turned around and slammed the fiery red lightning forward.

Bang!

A dazzling fiery glow and a ray of sword energy exploded apart in midair!

A moment of silence ensued, and then the fiery red lightning pierced through the sword energy and surged down upon the woman in white.

She remained indifferent as she took a step forward, and lotuses bloomed below her feet. A moment later, she transformed into a ray of white light that shot up into the sky!

She was going straight for the lightning!

Boom!

A deafening explosion resounded through the sky, and then a lotus of swords exploded apart before a white figure crashed down from above.

Tian Xiu frowned slightly before Yang Ye, and then she wiped off the blood on the corner of her mouth. She was about to attack when Yang Ye suddenly grabbed her hand.

She gazed at him, and her hands trembled at the sight of him right now.

She stretched out her hand to touch Yang Ye’s face, “You go first.”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Tian Xiu spoke softly, “It’s not the time to be willful.”

Yang Ye shook his head again. It wasn’t that he refused to speak, it was just very difficult for him to speak right now.

He pulled Tian Xiu and Qi Bitian behind him, and then he supported up the woman in white. At this moment, all three of them were seriously injured. Of course, they were in a slightly better state than him.

At this moment, the experts in the city had emerged. There were over 40 peak Destiny Realm experts around them, and a huge barrier of light had appeared around the city. This barrier of light emanated monstrous pressure that slammed down upon them in waves.

A disadvantage, an absolute disadvantage!

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and raised his palm. A small golden pagoda appeared there!

The Primordial Pagoda!

Yang Ye passed it to Tian Xiu!

Tian Xiu frowned slightly. She was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly said, “I don’t know if I’ll survive. If I don’t, then allow me to die before all of you. If you can, just leave. They want me, so please do as I say.”

As he spoke, blood was practically spraying from his mouth.

Tian Xiu looked Yang Ye in the eyes, and he cracked a smile, “Let me protect all of you just once!”

As he spoke, Yang Ye suddenly turned around and charged at the mysterious expert and Monarch Yan.

Tian Xiu’s expression changed drastically. She was about to stop Yang Ye when a strand of mysterious energy enveloped them!

The Sword Domain!

The Sword Domain descended upon all three of them. They were shocked and hurriedly withdrew their energy!

If they were to release their energy now, even if it was just their physical strength, it would cause a huge amount of damage to Yang Ye. However, if they didn’t do anything, they couldn’t catch up to him at all.

Just like that, Yang Ye instantly created distance between them.

At this moment, Tian Xiu’s face was ghastly pale, and it was like she’d lost her soul.

Yang Ye was growing faster and faster, and his eyes were shut tight. At this moment, figures flashed incessantly through his mind. Qingshi, Snowy, Weiran, Yuxi, Zhixian, Erya, Tian Xiu, Qi Bitian…

Yang Ye’s face was covered in tears without him even realizing it.

His life had meaning because of their presence!

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s voice came from afar, “Snowy, be good from now on.”

Snowy looked up at the sky from within the Primordial Pagoda. She stretched out her little paw while her tiny figure trembled violently.

At this moment, her mind was blank.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye was growing closer and closer to the mysterious expert and Monarch Yan, and they didn’t do anything.

Their joint forces were even capable of going against the strongest form of Destiny!

Suddenly, Yang Ye roared with laughter. At this moment, he thought of nothing in his mind.

He sought death!

He was truly seeking death this time!

Yang Ye grabbed the hilt of his sword, and at the instant he drew it, he spoke softly in his heart, “Goodbye… forever!”

As soon as he finished speaking…

His sword left its sheath!

At this moment, it seemed like the world had frozen still.

At a point high above the clouds, the woman seated before the Go board stood up abruptly. Justice, that was on the board, seemed to have sensed something and shook violently while emanating a resounding sword howl.

She looked down and frowned slightly, “An empty mind and an attack to decide on life and death. The Sword Dao of Fate…”

At this moment, her face was very gloomy.

At a distant point in the starry sky, a sword cultivator in a cloud white robe stopped abruptly because his sword was trembling violently in his grasp.
