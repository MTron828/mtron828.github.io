Chapter 1416 – Here’s To Propose A Marriage?

It didn’t take long for the Celestial Demon’s voice to stop abruptly.

After that, the Celestial Demon’s terrified voice arose in Yang Ye’s mind, “What’s that? What is that? Aah! No!”

The Celestial Demon’s voice gradually weakened until it vanished.

A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth. After all, the Celestial Demon had courted death. As for what the Celestial Demon had said earlier, he naturally didn’t believe it.

After all, just look what happened to the Demon Lord!

The Demon Lord wasn’t dead, but he was completely crippled. At the moment that Celestial Demon had left his body, the Celestial Demon had taken away all the vitality and energy within the Demon Lord, but the Demon Lord couldn’t resist at all and stop it. He could only watch helplessly as the Celestial Demon did that!

It was the price he paid!

Strength that was obtained through relying on others was like an illusion in the end, and it couldn’t be relied on.

After the Primordial Pagoda killed the Celestial Demon, the scales made of stellar energy around Yang Ye had gradually vanished, and then a feeling of weakness and emptiness swept through Yang Ye. Yang Ye’s head felt like it exploded, and then he collapsed on Qiong Qi’s back.

Zhuang Weiran’s trembling voice resounded, “You....”

Once the Demon Lord and Celestial Demon were killed, the forces of Celestial Demon Stellar Region immediately fled or died in the process.

Nothing unexpected occurred after that and Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region was victorious.

Countless people cheered and howled throughout Clouds of Heaven City.

They were excited and venting.

People who had never faced death would never know how great it was to be alive. Only by experiencing a near death experience would one cherish life even more.

Clouds of Heaven City. Within a room.

The room wasn’t very luxurious, but it was quite exquisite. Even though the decorations here were simple, it wasn’t difficult to realize the owner was a woman.

It was Zhuang Weiran’s room. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Yang Ye was lying on the bed with his eyes closed tight. His face was extremely warped while sharp slaughter intent and sword intent frequently arose from within him. At this moment, his sword intent and slaughter intent were very violent.

Backlash!

Over exhausting the body would cause one to be weak at the very most, and it wasn’t a huge problem. But forcefully improving sword intent would make one suffer from backlash, and that backlash was definitely very painful. If it was possible, Yang Ye wanted to shout out a little or slam the ground to vent his pain.

But he couldn’t!

Because Zhuang Weiran was by his bed, and he didn’t want to embarrass himself in front of her.

Wasn’t it just some pain? He just had to endure it!

Endure it!

Zhuang Weiran stared at him without blinking. She knew that Yang Ye was in extreme pain, but she was helpless. Her strength wasn’t sufficient, and it wasn’t enough to forcefully suppress Yang Ye’s Quasi Returnal Rank sword intent that was in a violent state. She could only let it gradually return to normal. If she tried to suppress it by force and failed, then it would put Yang Ye in an even worse state.

So, she could only watch and do nothing.

A short while later, Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes. He gazed at her and revealed a smile that looked even worse than someone crying, “You should leave for now. I’m afraid that I might lose my composure!”

The pain he experienced from the backlash of his sword intent was truly painful beyond words. It was also why he’d only improved his sword intent at the critical moment. Because he really didn’t want to suffer this backlash.

Actually, an ordinary person wouldn’t be able to endure such pain at all. Only someone who’d experienced all sorts of torture like Yang Ye could remain conscious while suffering backlash from their intent.

Yang Ye really wanted to just lose consciousness, but he didn’t dare to. He was afraid that his sword intent would go berserk if he fell unconscious. It was very unstable right now, and it might even attack him if he wasn’t careful. It was an extremely likely possibility. It wasn’t because his sword intent wanted to attack him, it was because his sword intent was in such an unstable state.

So, he had no choice but to forcefully hold on.

Zhuang Weiran shook her head, took his hand, and said, “I’ll accompany you....”

Yang Ye smiled bitterly. He wanted to shout! How will I shout while you’re here?! But he didn’t say anything. He flipped his palm and grabbed her hand before he said, “Don’t worry, I’ve gone through this a lot. It’s fine, it’ll go away in a while.”

“Actually, that agreement we had....” Meanwhile, she suddenly spoke softly, “If it wasn’t for me, you wouldn’t have been swept into this, and you wouldn’t have almost lost your life. Do you blame me for this?”

Yang Ye replied with a question, “What do you think?”

She shook her head and fell silent.

Yang Ye chuckled, “I told you earlier, it really isn’t necessary to consider all of that when it’s between us. If you do that, it makes me feel like you’re treating me as an outsider, and that makes me quite uncomfortable. Don’t say things like that again, alright?”

She looked up at him, nodded, and replied, “Alright, I won’t.”

Yang Ye remained silent for a while, and then he said, “Weiran, what do you plan to do from now?”

She shook her head and said, “I don’t know.” She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “What about you?”

Yang Ye replied, “I’m going to the large world!”

Men endeavor to reach higher places. He naturally wanted to go to the large world of legend and see it for himself. Most importantly, Snowy and Zi’er were there. However, he had many things to do before he went there. For example, making arrangements for Su Qingshi and the others, and going to see An Nanjing.

Zhuang Weiran nodded, “I understand.” She paused for a moment once she finished speaking, and she seemed like she was hesitant to say something.

Yang Ye asked, “What’s on your mind?”

She shook her head and said, “Let’s wait until you’ve recovered.”

Yang Ye nodded. Indeed, the most important matter at hand was to recover. Yang Ye stopped talking, closed his eyes slowly, and then absorbed spirit energy to repair his body.

He wasn’t just suffering backlash from his sword intent, his body was over exhausted as well, so it needed to recover as well.

Just like that, around two days passed while Yang Ye slowly recovered.

Zhuang Weiran had never left his side during this time.

Once he recovered, Yang Ye opened his eyes, gazed at her, and grinned, “I’m almost fully recovered. Come, let me take you somewhere.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took her hand and entered the 1st level of the Primordial Pagoda.

Zhuang Weiran glanced at the surroundings once she entered the Primordial Pagoda. Besides curiosity, there was a trace of shock in her eyes, “What... what is this place?”

Yang Ye smiled, “This is that treasure you wanted to take from me!”

Yang Ye’s gaze suddenly became gentle when he spoke up to this point. At that time, it was very likely that she would have succeeded, but she hadn’t done so.

She shook her head and said, “It belongs to that senior. It’s at a level that even I can’t understand. If I killed you and took it, I can’t be certain that it wouldn’t attack me.”

Yang Ye smiled, “No matter what, if you hadn’t shown mercy, then I wouldn’t be living in this world anymore.”

She gazed at him, “You were really weak then.”

Yang Ye replied, “What about now?”

She answered, “You’re still very weak!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened. She’s getting mischievous.

Meanwhile, she said, “I never expected you to grow to such an extent in just a short two years. You possess great karmic luck, but great karmic luck is usually accompanied by a path filled with difficulties and disasters. You might have to suffer even more in the future. However, it’s normal. Life has always been filled with suffering.”

Yang Ye suddenly took her hands and said, “Are you filled to take that path with me?”

She gazed at him in silence.

Yang Ye’s face dimmed down slightly, “You’re not willing?”

Suddenly, she embraced him and spoke softly, “When I heard you went to Celestial Demon Stellar Region, I knew that I would have to use my entire life to repay you. Of course, that’s all I can do.”

He wrapped his arm around her waist and laughed bitterly, “You make it sound like a business deal.”

He naturally didn’t think that she was just repaying him. She wasn’t a person like that, and he wasn’t such a person as well. They hadn’t known each other for long, but there was a vague relationship between them. That was why she’d made that agreement with him all those years ago!

If she really felt nothing for him, she would have definitely not made that agreement with him.

She didn’t say anything, and Yang Ye remained silent as well. They just hugged each other like that.

A long time passed before Yang Ye took her hand and said, “Come, let’s go visit two fellows.”

He brought her to the Celestial Demon Wolves that Qiong Qi had dragged in here. At this moment, they were shivering while lying flat on the ground. It seemed like they’d encountered something terrifying.

Both of them seemed to be visibly pleading to him when they saw Yang Ye and Zhuang Weiran arrive.

Yang Ye had quite a solemn expression on his face. He really didn’t understand why the Primordial Pagoda was so deterring to demon beasts, and even Qiong Qi didn’t dare enter it rashly.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts. No matter what, the Primordial Pagoda was his.

Yang Ye gazed at them and said, “One condition, submit to me. Otherwise, die. There’s no other option.”

He would naturally not release them. Even though they weren’t as strong as Qiong Qi, they were ferocious beasts comparable to peak Deities. Moreover, he couldn’t really rely on Qiong Qi. Because Qiong Qi refused to help unless he was really about to die. So, these two Celestial Demon Wolves would be two peak Deities for him to use!

Thus, they had to submit to him no matter what.

There was a trace of hesitance in their eyes when they heard Yang Ye. Meanwhile, Yang Ye just pulled Zhuang Weiran along as he turned around and started walking away.

They instantly became anxious when they saw Yang Ye leave, and then they immediately chased after Yang Ye and Zhuang Weiran. They really didn’t want to stay here anymore.

They were willing to do anything if they could leave.

Zhuang Weiran helped Yang Ye take control of their souls. So, besides Qiong Qi, Yang Ye had two more ominous beasts by his side!

Yang Ye and Zhuang Weiran didn’t stay for long within the Primordial Pagoda because they had many things to deal with.

They’d only just left the Primordial Pagoda when Fen Cangyan appeared before them and said, “Young Miss, Yang... Young Master Yang. We have visitors from Wildlands Stellar Region. They said... they said that they are here to propose a marriage.”

Yang Ye’s face instantly became gloomy.
