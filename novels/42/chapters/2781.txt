Chapter 2782 – The Ordinary Sword!

Of course the man was Yang Ye!

However, he was completely different from before. His aura was completely different!

Meanwhile, An Nanjing walked over to his side, “Congratulations!”

She was naturally able to sense the changes in him.

At this moment, there was a true gap between them.

Yang Ye glanced at An Nanjing and smiled, and then he looked up at the sky, “I wonder how many will survive all of this.”

It was unlike any other battle of the past.

In the past, it was just a battle of a certain area, yet now, the entire Three Dimensional Universe was at risk of destruction.

The enemy was too strong.

The enemy was truly too strong.

Meanwhile, Jian Wudi and the others arrived before the hall, and they couldn’t help but smile when they saw Yang Ye.

Even though the path ahead was bleak, they still had hope.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Everyone, I’m afraid few of us will survive in the end.”

Huang Ying smiled, “It can’t be helped, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Then let’s give it our all. If we win, that would be perfect, and we can continue enjoying our lives; if we lose, then let’s fight this final battle to our heart’s content.”

“Haha!” The others roared with laughter.

Their laughter was full of heroic spirit. Of course, perhaps there was some helplessness in it all.

After all, the Three Dimensional Universe had no choice but to fight for its life or fight to its death!

They had no other choice!

Yang Ye and An Nanjing left Universe City and arrived in outer space. Yang Ye got another chair and placed it there. He just sat there while An Nanjing sat by his side.

Yang Ye suddenly smiled, “I never expected that I would one day protect a world.”

An Nanjing lowered her head slightly.

Actually, while Yang Ye was selfish, it depended on the person. He’d never been selfish to those who considered his own, but he’d just never trusted outsiders in the past.

Suddenly, the space before them trembled, and then an old man walked quickly out of there.

The old man with a bamboo chest!

Yang Ye was stunned when he saw the old man. A moment later, he frowned because the old man had many injuries.

The old man walked quickly to Yang Ye. He glanced at Yang Ye and there was quite a bit of surprise in his eyes, “Young brother…”

Yang Ye smiled and remained silent.

The old man shook his head and smiled, “Congratulations.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Senior, what happened to you?”

The old man sighed softly, “I’m here to seek your help!”

Yang Ye replied, “Senior, please be frank.”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “There are four paths from the Four Dimensional Universe that lead to the Three Dimensional Universe. They are in the four directions. They are teleportation passageways that the Four Dimensional Universe converged all its strength to create. All those years ago, Destiny split herself into four in order to suppress these passageways. Of course, the Four Dimensional Universe is guarding the other three passageways. Because the three of them are very strong, and the Four Dimensional Universe is worried that they would launch a counterattack. That is also why Monarch Yan doesn’t dare to come here with his main body. He has to protect the Four Dimensional Universe. So, do you understand what I’m trying to say?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and replied, “I understand.”

They had merely been fighting the tip of the iceberg!

Moreover, the Four Dimensional Universe wasn’t really afraid of Universe City, it was afraid of the woman in white and the others.

The old man with the bamboo chest said, “I’m here to ask you to help her.”

Yang Ye asked, “The woman in white?”

The old man nodded, “I was guarding the southern passageway with her when she noticed the situation here was very serious, and so she asked me to guard the passageway while she came here to help you. But when she returned, she was seriously injured… Her injuries are very serious because she has always been fighting with injuries as well. The Four Dimensional Universe clearly noticed the state she was in, and more and more experts of greater strength have been swarming from over there. Even the projection of Monarch Yan’s main body is over there. She’s in a very bad situation!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Let’s go!”

But he seemed to have thought of something at this point and said, “Senior, you stay here and protect this place for me, alright?”𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The old man hesitated for a moment and said, “Just the two of you?”

Yang Ye nodded.

He wanted to say something but Yang Ye spoke first, “Senior, trust me.”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye. In the end, he nodded, “Alright, I can take this opportunity to perfect this formation of yours!”

Yang Ye smiled, “That’s great!”

The old man formed a seal with both hands, and then a teleportation formation appeared below Yang Ye and An Nanjing.

An instant later, they vanished on the spot.

The old man fell silent for a moment, and then he shot toward the city below.

Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye and An Nanjing walked out of a teleportation passageway. As soon as they did, a horrible smell of blood assaulted them!

They looked up into the distance, and there was a huge black vortex at the end of their vision. A woman in white was standing there with a sword in hand, and strange living beings were frequently charging out of the vortex.

Even though none of them could endure a single swing of her sword, they were still ceaselessly charging at her!

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “They are exhausting her!”

An Nanjing nodded.

Yang Ye glanced at the woman in white and smiled, “Unfortunately, I can’t play the hero that saves the beauty!”

An Nanjing glanced at him, “You want to be a hero?”

Yang Ye hurriedly shook his head, “I’m joking, just joking!”

He quickly charged over once he finished speaking.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing glanced at Yang Ye while a slight grin arose on the corners of her mouth.

She quickly followed him.

A sword howl suddenly resounded in the distance.

The woman in white stopped, and Yang Ye appeared before her. She frowned slightly, “You?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Let’s kill our way in?”

She gazed at Yang Ye for a few breaths of time and smiled, “Alright!”

Yang Ye suddenly emanated a ray of blood red light.

The Demonic Sword Dao.

Yang Ye turned around, and a ray of light flashed.

Hiss!

Blood sprayed wherever Yang Ye passed.

She grinned behind him, “You’ve grown quite quickly!”

She vanished on the spot as well.

Just like that, Yang Ye, An Nanjing, and the woman in white killed all the way forward. A short while later, they were in front of the black vortex.

Suddenly, a ray of black light erupted from within it, and it instantly enveloped all three of them.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Countless rays of sword energy crisscrossed within the black light, and in just a short while, the black light had been sliced into bits.

Meanwhile, a pitch black sword slammed against the huge vortex.

Boom!

The huge vortex shook, but it didn’t shatter!

Burial flew back into the Sword Gourd on Yang Ye’s waist.

Yang Ye frowned as he gazed at the huge vortex.

The woman in white smiled, “It’s no ordinary vortex. It’s made from the universe walls of the Four Dimensional Universe. Only a handful in this world can destroy it!”

Yang Ye Gazed at her, “Even you can’t?”

The woman in white smiled, “I can. However, what’s the point? The passageway is built, so destroying this wall is equivalent to fully opening a passageway between the universes. It doesn’t make a difference. No, if we launch a counterattack, then destroying it does make a difference!”

Yang Ye was stunned for a moment and said, “Hurry up and destroy it! We’re definitely launching a counterattack!”

She gazed at him, “Are you serious?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She didn’t say another word and just swung her sword.

A sword howl resounded, and then the vortex shook violently. Meanwhile, a shadow flashed out from it.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He was about to attack, but the woman in white was faster than him. She raised her hand and slashed.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then a white and black shadow flickered incessantly in the distance. They were so fast that even Yang Ye couldn’t see their movements clearly!

An Nanjing was about to attack but Yang Ye shook his head.

She gazed at him, and he pointed at the distant vortex. She nodded slightly and understood what he meant.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot, and a ray of light slammed against the vortex.

Burial!

Bang!

The vortex shook violently and cracked open!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye switched Burial for the Sword Precursor and slashed once more!

Hiss!

This slash instantly sliced the vortex into half.

A wisp of madness flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes as he gazed at An Nanjing, “Come on! Let’s kill our way in there!”

As soon as he said that, he charged through with An Nanjing.

Suddenly, a colossus slammed itself at him!

A Panthera!

Yang Ye dashed forward. It only took a moment for them to grow closer and closer.

Suddenly, Yang Ye drew his sword.

An arc of sword energy flashed.

Hiss!

The arc of sword energy appeared behind the Panthera.

The Panthera was still charging forward, but its body split apart at the center… In an instant, blood and internal organs sprayed in a bloody mess!

Suddenly, the shadow, who was in battle with the woman in white, suddenly shot backward. At the same time, he shot a glance at Yang Ye, “The Ordinary Sword…”

There was a trace of disbelief in his voice!
