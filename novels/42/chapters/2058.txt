Chapter 2059 – I Just Want to Kill!

Li Shui’shui gazed at Yang Ye, “He cursed you!”

“Shut up!” Yang Ye glared at her, and then he gazed at the young man. The young man was about to speak when Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

The young man’s expression changed slightly. He flipped his right palm and a spear appeared in his grasp before sweeping down at Yang Ye.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the young man was pushed over 300m back.

Once he stopped himself, he glanced at his slightly numb arm before looking up at Yang Ye and smiling fiercely, “You have some ability, but…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye raised his hand and swung his sword.

Bang!

The young man was instantly blasted over 3km away. This time, as soon as he stopped himself, a sword was against his neck.

The young man stared at Yang Ye, “You…”

Yang Ye gazed at the young man and spoke casually, “Do you know who Yang Ye is now?”

The young man suddenly smiled, “You have some ability, but do you dare to kill me? I…”

Hiss!

The young man’s head flew up into the air before he could even finish speaking.

Yang Ye lowered his sword.

After that, he glanced at the bloody head rolling towards the side and shook his head, “The facts prove that I do dare. Unfortunately, you aren’t able to hear it.”

Yang Ye turned around and swung his sword as he spoke.

Hiss!

A ray of light flashed.

Around 300m away, the ray of light stopped, and it just stopped there like it was frozen in place.

A moment later, a man in an embroidered robe appeared before them.

The man glanced at the ray of light and said, “Your sword moved as you wish. Amazing indeed.” He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “There are few in Martial Emperor Academy who use the sword, and there are only two who are extremely strong. I just happen to know both of them, and you aren’t any one of them!”

Yang Ye shook his head and looked towards the distance, “We want to go in and have a look. You don’t have an objection, right?”

The man looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “What if I do?”

“Isn’t that simple to resolve?” Yang Ye chuckled, and then he vanished on the spot. At the same time, a ray of cold light appeared before the man’s forehead.

The man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he tapped his finger forward. It tapped against the tip of Yang Ye’s sword, and it pushed Yang Ye and his sword backwards. However, Yang Ye twisted his right hand just a moment later.

Bang!

The man was blasted over 300m back, and as soon as he stopped himself, another ray of light shot towards him. It was extremely swift and impossible to dodge, nor could he. Once he tried to dodge it, he would fall into a passive position in this battle!

He restrained his thoughts and bent backwards slightly while stomping his right foot upwards. It kicked straight against Yang Ye’s sword, causing Yang Ye’s sword’s stabbing motion to become an upward swipe!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly released his sword and stomped his left foot down. He relied on the counterforce which came from the space below him to launch a kick at the man.

He wasn’t being vicious; it was merely because the man’s nether regions were the best place to strike in the man’s current posture.

The man hadn’t expected Yang Ye’s reaction to be so swift, and he naturally didn’t dare to let Yang Ye’s foot kick his nether regions. He immediately stomped his foot down and swung his other foot at Yang Ye.

Bang!

The man was blasted away, and long rifts cracked open in the space beneath his feet, obviously displaying how terrifying Yang Ye’s kick had been!

Yang Ye didn’t stop. He appeared in front of the man again. This time, he didn’t use his sword, and he just kicked at the man again.

Bang!

The space around them shook violently and seemed like an earthquake was running through it.

The man’s eyes narrowed slightly while ruthlessness flashed through his eyes. He suddenly formed a strange seal with both hands, and then a ray of light swept out from the seal.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted away.

Yang Ye glanced at his palm. At this moment, the skin there had been scorched black like coal.

Yang Ye looked up at the man, and he saw faint golden flames covering the man’s hands. It hadn’t been a ray of light but crimson gold flames that had hit Yang Ye.

Yang Ye shook his head, and his hands had recovered to normal. The man’s face fell at the sight of this, “How did you do that?”

Yang Ye didn’t say a word in response, and he just shot up into the sky, and then he transformed into a ray of light that shot down at the man.

The man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and flames burned in his eyes. A moment later, a pillar of fire shot up into the air. At the same time, crimson red flames appeared around Yang Ye, making him seem like a descending meteor!

Both flames slammed against each other.

Boom!

A wave of flames swept out, and the space there turned ethereal.

Li Shui’shui and Wo You hurriedly shot backwards. Because even if they survived the powerful wave of flames, it would injure them.

Both of those flames weren’t ordinary!

The sky had turned into an ocean of flames.

No one noticed that the ocean of flames had enveloped the huge statue, but the statue was completely unharmed.

The ocean of flames remained for an entire 15 minutes before vanishing. At this moment, Yang Ye and the man were still here. Based on their outward appearances, they were both fine.

The man stared at Yang Ye, “What are those flames?”

Yang Ye unfurled his fist, and there was a small flame floating there. A smile curled up on his face as he gazed at it. He hadn’t used the Divine Yin Flame for a very long time. It wasn’t that the Divine Yin Flame wasn’t strong, it was because he’d placed all his attention on his physical body and Sword Dao.

A pure pursuit!

Regardless of whether it was the Sword Dao or the physical body, they stressed upon purity. So, he rarely relied on external sources of strength, including the Divine Wings that could drastically improve his speed. He didn’t even use the mysterious black talisman he’d taken from the Weapon Path’s Prediction Line.

While he didn’t use it, it didn’t represent that he wouldn’t!

A moment later, a pair of black wings appeared behind Yang Ye, and Yang Ye’s figure immediately started floating.

“The Sage Rank!” The man’s expression became quite unsightly. Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s figure vanished.

The man’s expression changed drastically, and then a wave of powerful energy assaulted his face. It instantly caused the man’s face to warp.

Two balls of flames suddenly blazed within the man’s eyes, and then a wave of flames swept out from him.

Boom!

An explosion reverberated. An instant later, the man was blasted away while Yang Ye was pushed back repeatedly as well. However, it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to stop himself.

Once he did, Yang Ye looked up at the man and was about to attack. However, another middle aged man and beautiful woman in red clothes had appeared not too far away from him. They gazed at Yang Ye, and then a ray of red light and cold light instantly arrived in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye clenched both his fists and slammed them forward.

Bang! Bang!

Yang Ye was pushed over 1km back!

Once he stopped himself, he waved his right hand, and a sword appeared in his grasp. After that, he raised his right hand, and the tip of his sword started spinning rapidly against his palm.

The middle aged man and red clothed woman seemed quite vigilant at this moment, and the space around them started to ripple. Obviously, they were accumulating strength.

The battle would begin at any moment!

“Stop!” Suddenly, a voice came from the side, and then a middle aged man with a spear on his back appeared before them.

The middle aged man walked swiftly to Yang Ye, glanced at Yang Ye’s sword, and said, “Young Brother, you’re probably here to enter that mysterious building and not to kill, right?”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “I’m not here to kill, but others want to kill me!”

The middle aged man nodded slightly, and then he gazed at the middle aged man and woman in red clothes, “Brother Huang Nian, your son is fine, so this isn’t necessary, right?”

The middle aged man glanced at the man in embroidered clothes. At this moment, he was still emanating faint flames, and his countenance was quite pale. However, his life wasn’t in danger.

He looked up at Yang Ye and was about to speak when the beautiful woman spoke abruptly, “Let it go? How can we?”

She gazed at Yang Ye, “Han Yi, he injured my son, yet you want me to let it go? What? It doesn’t hurt because it wasn’t your son?”

Han Yi frowned when he heard this.

Meanwhile, the woman suddenly pointed at Yang Ye, “You want me to forget it. Sure, tell him to sever both his arms as compensation, and I will. Otherwise…”

“Otherwise all of you will die!” Suddenly, Yang Ye started walking in their direction, “I planned to just let it go. After all, I don’t want to waste time here. But now…”

As he spoke, Yang Ye’s face became quite vicious, “Now, I just want to kill!”

A sword howl resounded!𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m
