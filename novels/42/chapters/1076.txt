Chapter 1077 – String Up Their Heads!

Only 5 people remained on the ruins of Cloud Merchant Group’s branch here, and it was Yang Ye’s group of 3, the beautiful woman, and the grey robed old man.

Besides them, everyone within the entire branch had been buried beneath the rubble.

There had been a few thousand people in the branch before this!

Yang Ye hadn’t expected this, and neither had the old man and beautiful woman. They hadn’t expected the students of White Deer Academy to attack Cloud Merchant Group’s branch and even launch such a lethal attack!

Yang Ye slowly clenched his fists, and he looked up towards the source of the voice. Over 20 cultivators in grey robed had appeared not too far away from him. There were men and women amongst them, and there was a small ‘书’ character embroidered on their clothes.

“You’re Yang Ye?” The young man who led the group and held an iron rod in his hand sized up Yang Ye, and then chuckled, “Did you slam your head against a wall when you were young?”

“Brother Lin Yu, why do you say so?” The person who spoke these words was a man standing by the young man with the iron rod, and he was holding a dagger instead.

“If he hadn’t slammed his head against a wall, then would he boast about crushing our Law Faction?” The man called Lin Yu roared with laughter.

“I think that he might have been kicked in the head by a donkey! Hahaha!”

“Tsk tsk, so that fellow is Yang Ye. He doesn’t seem special at all. Why did he dare to boast like that? I really don’t understand. Hey, Yang Ye! Can you tell me why you dared to say something like that? Did you really slam your head against a wall? Hahaha!”

“I think that there’s no need to wait 2 more days. We can just deal with him today. What do all of you think?”

“Hmm, that’s a good idea. Right, let’s allow him to speak his last words. Otherwise, people would say that we of the Law Faction are inhumane!”

Yang Ye glanced at them and remained silent for a while before he spoke, “I’m your target, so why kill the members of Cloud Merchant Group?” Yang Ye wasn’t a kindhearted person, but he didn’t like dragging others down.

“The members of Cloud Merchant Group?” Lin Yu glanced at Yang Ye and feigned surprise, “Oh my! I never expected that there would be others here. Oh my! I’m so sorry. We were too excited when we heard that you were here, so we accidentally used too much force. Alas, we really didn’t do it on purpose. If... if you don’t like it, then come hit us! Hahaha!”

“Hahaha! Come hit us! Hahaha!”

“I’ve wanted to have a spar with you for a long time. Come! I can’t restrain myself any longer! Come and beat us up with all your might!”

“I can’t fucking take these idiots anymore!” Xuwu Shen stomped his right foot against the ground and shot forward.

“Don’t leave a single one of them alive. We’ll start today with 20 heads!” Yang Ye’s voice was still resounding through the air when he vanished on the spot. He was already within the group when he appeared once more, and then a figure was blasted away. A ray of light flashed through the air, and the head of that student from White Deer Academy was instantly separated from his body.

Blood sprayed out like a fountain!

“Kill!” A vicious glow flashed through Lin Yu’s eyes when he saw Yang Ye and Xuwu Shen attack them, and he was about to attack. However, the sound of air being torn apart resounded, and then a spar instantly appeared before him.

Lin Yu was shocked and didn’t dare act carelessly at all. He swiftly swung his iron rod down!

Bang!

The iron rod instantly cracked apart while the powerful force of the collision blasted him flying. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly appeared behind him. Lin Yu’s pupils constricted, and it was the last expression in his eyes because a fist had smashed against his back.

Bang!

Lin Yu’s figure exploded into pieces, and countless pieces of flesh and innards rained down from the sky!

The other students from the Law Faction were horrified when they witnessed this scene. At this moment, no matter how stupid they were, they knew that they’d underestimated their enemies, and they’d even severely underestimated their enemies.

Moreover, around 5 or 6 out of their group of 20 had already been killed in just a few breaths of time!

When they faced Yang Ye’s group, and especially when they faced Yang Ye and An Nanjing, many of them didn’t even have the ability to fight back. At this moment, the over a dozen students who still remained were filled with fear and intended to retreat.

“Retreat!” One of them suddenly shouted.

However, he’d only just shouted when a spear pierced through his chest, and his figure stiffened before crashing down from the sky.

“Kill whoever flees first!” Yang Ye’s voice resounded, and then he pressed his index and middle finger together before swinging it forward. A ray of sword energy shot out from the tip of his finger, and then the head of a student who was almost 1km away instantly flew up into the air!

It wasn’t mere sword energy, it was even enhanced by Void Rank sword intent!

Moreover, his Void Rank sword intent was a few times stronger than what it had been!

It was a slaughter!

It was an absolute slaughter!

The students of White Deer Academy were like helpless sheep before the joint forces of Yang Ye’s group, and it caused the grey robed old man and beautiful woman to be stunned on the spot.

A short while passed before the grey robed old man gazed at Yang Ye and An Nanjing, and he gulped before he said, “Are they too strong, or are those students too weak?”

“They should be just outer court students! She spoke solemnly, “However, they shouldn’t be slaughtered just like that!” Her voice clearly carried shock in it.

The beautiful woman remained silent for a moment before a wisp of resolve flashed through her eyes, “Give the order for all the branches under my management to accept bets. The winning rate for those who bet on White Deer Academy will be 100 to... no 10 to 1; as for Ocean of Clouds Academy, it’ll be 1 to 1!”

“Eldest Young Miss.... You....” The grey robed old man’s eyes were filled with shock. Such odds represented that the beautiful woman felt that Yang Ye’s group had a very good chance to win. Of course, he was truly shocked by the fact that they would be finished if they lost this gamble. He didn’t even have to give it a moment’s thought to realize that countless people would bet on White Deer Academy once betting was allowed!

At that time, if Yang Ye’s group were to lose, they would truly be finished, and it might even shake the foundation of her clan!

The beautiful woman took a deep breath and said, “Our ancestor once said that the cowardly die of hunger, and the brave have too much. There is no reward without risk. I... am willing to bet with my future on the line!”

The grey robed old man hesitated for a moment, and then he nodded, “Then let’s go all out! I’ll give the orders!”

She nodded, and then she looked up into the sky. At this moment, only 3 students from White Deer Academy remained.

They didn’t choose to flee because they noticed that their speed couldn’t compare to Yang Ye’s attacks. Anyone who fled would be the first to die.

In less than 10 minutes, only 3 from their group of 20 remained!

Hiss!

Bang!

2 figures were blasted flying. One had a hole pierced through his chest, and the other lost his head.

Just like that, only a female student from White Deer Academy remained here. She was around the age of 20, and she was holding a sword tightly with both hands. Even though she seemed to be very firm and strong on the outside, her trembling sword betrayed her.

“I can’t do something like ruthlessly crushing a beauty!” Xuwu Shen shook his head and moved aside.

“Do you think she would have shown mercy if you lost?” Yang Ye glanced at Xuwu Shen and was about to attack. However, the space in the sky suddenly trembled, and then the old man in luxurious robes who’d just left a while ago had appeared here once more.

A ferocious expression instantly appeared on his face when he saw what had happened here, “Yang Ye! You’re courting death!”

The old man was about to attack, but Yang Ye suddenly shot forward and slammed his fist towards the old man. Meanwhile, An Nanjing didn’t stand by idly and she tossed Skysplit at the old man at the same time that Yang Ye had attacked. Skysplit instantly arrived before the old man, and it was even slightly faster than Yang Ye!

The old man was astounded. Even he felt his heart palpitate before the energy contained within the spear. He didn’t dare collide directly with it and intended to dodge it. However, 2 terrifying waves of intent suddenly pressed down upon him!

The old man was horrified.

Bang!

Skysplit slammed against the old man’s chest and blasted him flying. However, Skysplit wasn’t able to pierce through the old man because a ray of golden light had surged out from him at the critical moment. That golden light had stopped Skysplit!

Meanwhile, the old man had just heaved a sigh of relief when his pupils suddenly constricted, and his hairs stood on end. At the same time, he swiftly turned around and slapped his palm forward!

Bang!

As soon as his palm moved forward, a fist instantly arrived before it and slammed against it! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Crack!

The sound of bones breaking resounded as the old man’s figure flew backwards. Meanwhile, An Nanjing suddenly appeared behind him, and her spear swept against his back.

Bang!

The old man’s eyes opened wide as his figure crashed down to the ground, and his fate was unknown.

Yang Ye was just about to launch another attack when the space high above him suddenly split apart, and then a huge palm stretched out from within the crack and slapped down towards him.

“Is White Deer Academy filled with such shameless people? If one fails, a group comes; if a group fails, then the old comes; if the old fails, then an even older one comes?” As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, the ancient sheath appeared in his grasp. He sheathed an intent sword within it before swiftly drawing it!

80 overlapped Heavenrends!

Om!

A sword howl shot up into the sky as a beam of sword energy tore through the air and smashed against the huge palm. A moment of silence ensued before the palm exploded into bits!

“Yang Ye! My Law Faction underestimated you a little!” A voice resounded in the sky.

Yang Ye paid no attention to the voice, and he just turned around to look at the old man who was lying there on the ground. He flicked a strand of sword energy over, and the old man’s head was instantly separated from his body.

Yang Ye turned around and looked at Xuwu Shen, “String up their heads. How can we go empty handed to White Deer Academy? We’ll give them a great gift!”
