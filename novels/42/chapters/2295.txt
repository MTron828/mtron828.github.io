Chapter 2296 – An Nanjing!

At this moment, Yang Ye was lying motionlessly on the ground. It was like he was dead.

An intent covered him, and the intent was surrounded by ferocious vengeful spirits.

The woman in a white dress gazed at Yang Ye without any desire to kill.

She was Bai Zhixian from White Emperor City.

Actually, she hadn’t really left earlier. Or it should be said that she’d left and returned. Because her intuition told her that Yang Ye wouldn’t die that easily.

The facts proved that her intuition was correct!

Suddenly, a few powerful auras swept over from the distant sky.

Bai Zhixian frowned slightly, fell silent for a moment, and then waved her right hand. A strand of white light surged toward Yang Ye. However, the vengeful spirits and Yang Ye’s madness intent didn’t allow the white light to get close.

Bai Zhixian’s face turned cold, “Do you want him to die?”

A breath of time passed, and then the vengeful spirits and madness intent surged back into Yang Ye’s body.

They had their own intelligence, and that was why they were protecting Yang Ye. Because they were only strong and existed because of Yang Ye. If Yang Ye died, then they would vanish with him.

Especially the madness intent!

Yang Ye had created it, and it wouldn’t exist if Yang Ye was gone!

The vengeful spirits were the same. Yang Ye was their best host!

Without the vengeful spirits and madness intent there to stop it, the white light instantly enveloped Yang Ye. Meanwhile, Bai Zhixian withdrew a golden talisman, and there was a trace of reluctance in her eyes as she gazed at it.

However, the auras in the sky were getting closer.

She glanced coldly at Yang Ye and crushed the talisman.

Hiss!

A ray of golden light flashed, and then Yang Ye and Bai Zhixian vanished on the spot.

They’d vanished without making a sound!

A breath of time after they vanished, four auras suddenly appeared here, and then a middle aged man in a black robe appeared where Yang Ye had been.

He was the patriarch of the Shiyuan Clan, Shiyuan Xing!

After he arrived here, three more experts appeared in the surroundings.

They were the three True Dao Realm experts who’d fought Yang Ye earlier.

Their faces were extremely unsightly when they saw that no one was here.

A black robed old man spoke solemnly, “Someone got here before us!”

Shiyuan Xing glanced at the surroundings, and his gaze pierced through over 500,000km into the distance, but he noticed nothing.

Shiyuan Xing’s face gradually turned gloomy.

“So long as he’s alive, our Shiyuan Clan will face severe trouble in the future!” Meanwhile, the black robed old man said, “While he’s only at the Progenitor Realm, his strength surpasses ordinary True Dao Realm experts. It’s impossible to do anything to him without the joint forces of at least three True Dao Realm experts. He’ll be very terrifying if he’s allowed to continue growing!”

Besides Shiyuan Xing, the other three had worry and solemnness in their eyes.

They’d fought Yang Ye for quite some time, so they knew how terrifying Yang Ye’s talent and strength were. Most importantly, he was just at the Progenitor Realm right now, and if he attained the True Dao Realm. At that time, even their patriarch would be helpless against him!

Shiyuan Xing closed his eyes slowly, “We made a mistake!”

Actually, the Shiyuan Clan knew Yang Ye was extraordinary from the very beginning, so they had used their full strength against him and didn’t give him any chance to survive. A few True Dao Realm experts and a formation against a single Progenitor Realm cultivator, it was practically unprecedented in the history of the Eternal Universe. However, Yang Ye had still managed to escape.

He’d escaped!

The atmosphere here was quite heavy.

A long time passed before Shiyuan Xing opened his eyes, “Is Ling Xu still not back yet?”

The black robed old man shook his head, “Not yet. But he’s still alive.”

Shiyuan Xing asked, “What about Void Spirit Maiden and the undying race’s patriarch?”

The black robed old man replied solemnly, “I don’t know. However, if they don’t want to die, then even the Eternal Universe doesn’t have many who are capable of killing them.”

Shiyuan Xing glanced at the location Yang Ye had been at earlier and said, “Ask Ling Xu to return as soon as possible. Besides that, do everything in our power to find Yang Ye.”

The old man suddenly asked, “What about the Immortal Estate?”

Shiyuan Xing replied, “They naturally won’t just let it go after Yang Ye killed someone of theirs. However, they probably don’t have the time to waste on Yang Ye right now.”

The old man was puzzled, “Why?”

Shiyuan Xing replied solemnly, “A mysterious person went to Immortal Estate and took one of their precious treasures. Now, the entire Immortal Estate is searching for him.”

The old man’s expression changed slightly, “Someone entered the Immortal Estate and even took a precious treasure of theirs? That’s impossible!”

Shiyuan Xing closed his eyes slowly, “I think it’s impossible too. However, it should be true. The Immortal Estate was covered in a tense atmosphere when I got there. It was like they were facing a formidable enemy.”

“Who was it?” The old man spoke solemnly, “Who was actually able to go there, take from them, and leave safely?!”

Shiyuan Xing shook his head slightly, “They say it was a sword cultivator, but I don’t know the specifics!”

“Was it the Sword Ruins?” The old man frowned, “Impossible. She would never casually leave the Sword Ruins. Moreover, if it were her, the Immortal Estate’s experts would have gone there by now!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Forget that!” Meanwhile, Shiyuan Xing suddenly said, “Use all our resources to find Yang Ye. Even if we must pay a certain price, just do it and find him. He must die!”

His voice was icy cold as he finished speaking.

…

The incident in Initial City didn’t escape the ears of the other powers.

Shock!

This time, all of them were shocked. In the beginning, they thought Yang Ye would definitely die upon going to the Shiyuan Clan. However, Yang Ye didn’t. Moreover, he’d almost slaughtered the entire Initial City!

It could be said that if Shiyuan Xing hadn’t rushed back to the city, countless more would have died in the city!

Three True Dao Realm experts couldn’t stop Yang Ye at all!

Some were happy while worry filled the hearts of others.

The happy were naturally Sword Sky City. Yang Ye owed them a favor. So, the stronger and more monstrous he was, the more valuable his favor would be. It could be said that Sword Sky City was the biggest winner. Because they hadn’t lost a single True Dao Realm expert, and they’d made Yang Ye owe them a favor instead!

After the incident, the Shiyuan Clan started doing everything it could to find Yang Ye, and they even used their full strength to find him!

…

White Emperor City.

In a simple room that clearly belonged to a woman. There was just a bed, a table, a chair, and a mirror. Besides that, there was nothing else in it.

A slovenly man was lying on the bed.

It was Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s clothes were in rags and dyed red with blood, and beneath those rags was a body covered in cracks.

He was severely injured!

Yang Ye had been severely injured during the battle with the three True Dao Realm experts in Initial City, and then Shiyuan Xing had suddenly appeared and made things worse. Fortunately, he had Primordial Violet Energy! Even though he didn’t have the Primordial Pagoda with him, after so many years of having it, his profound energy had been transformed into Primordial Violet Energy. However, if he had the pagoda, he would recover much more quickly because the pagoda had more Primordial Violet Energy. It was like a second Core for him, and it could provide an endless supply of Primordial Violet Energy to him!

That was why he practically never encountered a moment of having insufficient profound energy!

The Primordial Violet Energy within him was ceaselessly repairing his meridians and bones. His injuries could be described as being truly serious. His meridians and bones were shattered!

Suddenly, the door was pushed open, and a woman walked in.

It was Bai Zhixian.

Bai Zhixian walked over to Yang Ye’s side and gazed at him while thoughts flashed through her mind.

Meanwhile, an old man suddenly appeared behind her.

She withdrew her gaze and looked at the old man, “Father!”

The hunched old man nodded slightly, “You rescued him?”

She pondered deeply for a moment and replied, “No, I just wanted to take those treasures. Unfortunately, they aren’t in his possession anymore.”

The old man replied indifferently, “Then kill him!”

Bai Zhixian was stunned.

The old man gazed at her, “What is it?”

She fell silent for a long time and replied, “I think he can be used.”

The old man sighed softly, “That’s playing with fire.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Even I fear his talent and strength. Now, he’s demonic and insane, so the slightest mistake will bathe my White Emperor City in blood, just like Initial City!”

Bai Zhixian replied solemnly, “I know why he became like this. So, I want to see if I can control him.”

The hunched old man wanted to say more, but Bai Zhixian spoke solemnly, “Father, we’re the only ones left in White Emperor City. We’re like a juicy piece of meat in the eyes of the other powers. All of them want to tear us apart. They didn’t have an opportunity before this, but the Eternal Secret Realm is about to open. So long as something happens to me there, they’ll immediately attack White Emperor City, and they will definitely act against me there too.”

She closed her eyes slowly and continued, “If I want to gain a foothold in the Eternal Secret Realm, I need help. Otherwise, forget finding Eternal Objects, even surviving will be a problem!”

The old man sighed softly, “I planned to ask you to withdraw from that.”

She shook her head slightly, “How can I? It’s one of the last few opportunities we have. No matter what, I have to try. For our family, and for myself!”

The old man fell silent for a long time and said, “You decide.”

He turned around and walked away.

Only Yang Ye and Bai Zhixian remained in the room.

Suddenly, Yang Ye opened his eyes, and then he appeared in front of her. An instant later, a sword descended upon her.

Bai Zhixian didn’t dodge it and looked him in the eye, “An Nanjing!”

Yang Ye’s sword stopped abruptly.

As he gazed at her, two streams of blood red suddenly seeped out slowly from his eye sockets.
