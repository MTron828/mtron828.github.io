Chapter 972 – If You’re Weak, Then Shut Up!

Quasi Void Rank sword intent shot up into the sky from within Yang Ye, and then numerous sword howls resounded incessantly.

Powerful sword intent rippled through the heavens and the earth, and it seemed like even space was on the verge of being blasted apart. However, all the demon beasts here had ridicule on their faces.

He’s speaking about fighting a Saint?Is there something wrong with him in the head?

Even Li Yun was slightly stunned when he heard Yang Ye. Obviously, he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually dare to speak about fighting him. After all, he was a Saint while Yang Ye was only a Half-Saint!

Li Yun shook his head slightly and said, “Ignorant and foolish!”

Yang Ye’s natural talent wasn’t bad, and it wasn’t impossible for him to attain the Saint Realm in the future. However, Yang Ye was still an ant to him now.

“Yang Ye, are you even worthy of challenging Senior Li?” Meanwhile, Seng Yuan walked over to Yang Ye and ridiculed, “Do you think you are Brother Qianxiao?”

Yang Ye shot a sideways glance at Seng Yuan and said, “If you’re weak, then shut up. Alright?”

Seng Yuan’s face fell, “Yang Ye, do you really think that you can defeat me?”

Yang Ye said, “Should we fight again?”

Seng Yuan spoke ferociously, “Bring it on!”

Yang Ye glanced at Li Yun, and then he shook his head, “Forget it. That old fellow will lend you a hand once you’re no match for me. Under such circumstances, you’re in an invincible position. That’s too much of a disadvantage for me.”

“There’s no need for that!” Li Yun continued, “I wouldn’t stoop so low as to interfere in a battle between juniors. If he’s no match for you and dies, then he can only blame his lack of skill!”

“Good!” Yang Ye nodded, and then his figure rose slowly into the sky while the ancient sheath appeared in his grasp. After that, he sheathed an intent sword within it while powerful sword intent instantly appeared in the surroundings and caused the space around him to ripple.

Seng Yuan’s expression gradually turned solemn when he witnessed this scene, and then he slowly clenched his fists. At the same time, numerous solid blocks of rock appeared on his face and neck!

“Calcification!” A wisp of surprise flashed through Li Yun’s eyes, “No wonder he was so confident. So he comprehended the Calcification Technique of the Steel Ape Clan. Now, it’s equivalent to being in an invincible state.”

The Calcification Technique was an innate ability of the Steel Ape Clan, and it strengthened their physical defenses by numerous times. Moreover, it allowed them to be immune to all techniques. Of course, it wasn’t true immunity, and it was merely immunity to some techniques. With Seng Yuan’s own physical defenses and the Calcification Technique, his physical defenses could be said to be comparable to a Divine Rank treasure. Moreover, he was immune to practically all Saint Rank techniques!

Of course, the Calcification Technique couldn’t be utilized without limit. Seng Yuan could only activate once a year with his current strength, and that was why he hadn’t activated it before this.

Li Yun’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye. At this moment, Yang Ye’s aura was growing stronger and stronger. Besides that, it wasn’t just sword intent that circled around Yang Ye, there was slaughter intent as well. The pressure emanated by the 2 intents was extremely terrifying, and it caused even the ground to start splitting apart.

“Yang Ye, I know your physical strength and defenses are extremely formidable. Today, I’ll allow you to realize what truly formidable physical strength and defenses are like. Come! I’ll let you strike me!” Seng Yuan gazed ferociously at Yang Ye while madness filled his eyes. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Li Yun frowned a little when he heard Seng Yuan. He didn’t really like how Seng Yuan was looking down on his opponent. Because Li Yun had watched many people die at the hands of weaker opponents, and most of them had died from underestimating their opponents and giving their opponents an opportunity to take advantage of. So, his impression of Seng Yuan had plummeted when he saw Seng Yuan underestimate Yang Ye.

However, he did understand why Seng Yuan was acting like that. It was because Seng Yuan was disgruntled from losing to Yang Ye twice, and Seng Yuan intended to regain his honor.

Yang Ye held the intent sword in his grasp as he looked at Seng Yuan who stood on the ground below, “Seng Yuan, are you really going to let me strike you? Let me warn you that this attack of mine once shattered the heavens. You might just die from it. So, I have to warn you. Otherwise, I would have gained a victory I didn’t deserve, and I wouldn’t be able to rest at ease!”

Li Yun laughed with ridicule when he heard Yang Ye, and he looked down on Yang Ye a little. If he was in Yang Ye’s position, then he wouldn’t waste his breath at all and immediately attack Seng Yuan. However, Yang Ye didn’t seize the opportunity and was wasting his breath on Seng Yuan instead. Li Yun felt that it was a foolish action like how Seng Yuan was looking down on Yang Ye!

“It even shattered the heavens?” Seng Yuan immediately roared with laughter when he heard Yang Ye, and his voice was filled with ridicule. After all, how powerful was the heavens? Not to mention Yang Ye, even a Saint couldn’t do that. However, Yang Ye had said that he could. So, as far as Seng Yuan was concerned, it was a huge joke.

Seng Yuan chuckled for a while before he said, “Come! Yang Ye, let me see how powerful it is to actually shatter the heavens. I’m truly curious!”

Li Yun slowly closed his eyes. He wasn’t interested in a battle between the younger generation at all. He was a little interested before this, but even that had vanished when he saw how foolishly both Yang Ye and Seng Yuan were acting.

Yang Ye nodded and said, “As you wish!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a sword howl shot into the sky, and then a dazzling ray of sword energy flashed through the air.

It tore through the sky and space, and it was an extremely shocking sight to behold!

Seng Yuan’s face had turned solemn at the exact same instant that Yang Ye drew his sword. Because it carried 40 overlapped strands of sword energy. So, Seng Yuan didn’t dare act carelessly in the slightest. However, he was stunned on the spot at the exact same moment that he intended to fight seriously against Yang Ye!

It wasn’t just Seng Yuan, all the other demon beasts here were stunned!

Because Yang Ye’s attack wasn’t shooting towards Seng Yuan, it was shooting towards Li Yun!

Yang Ye’s target was Li Yun!

At this moment, no matter how stupid he was, Seng Yuan realized Yang Ye’s true intentions! Even though he was extremely furious from being looked down upon by Yang Ye, there was ridicule and a cold smile on his face.

Because Yang Ye was overestimating his ability! Yang Ye was courting death!

Li Yun was slightly stunned as well. He hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually attack him. The sword energy was already in front of him when he recovered from his shock, but he just laughed coldly, “You’re courting death!” As soon as he finished speaking, Li Yun waved his right hand. A ray of violet light rippled forward and smashed against Yang Ye’s attack.

Bang!

An explosion resounded before Li Yun’s expression changed slightly. Because that attack of his had actually been blasted apart by Yang Ye’s sword energy. Moreover, the sword energy didn’t slow down at all as it arrived right before him.

Li Yun’s eyes narrowed slightly while a wisp of ghastly killing intent appeared within his eyes. He raised his right hand and slapped it forward against the sword energy.

Bang!

Just like that, Yang Ye’s 40 overlapped Heavenrends were blasted apart with ease. However, Li Yun moved 3 steps back as well.

Li Yun steadied himself while a ferocious expression appeared on his face. He hadn’t imagined that he would have actually been pushed 3 steps back by an ant at the Half-Saint Realm! That was definitely an extraordinary insult to a dignified Saint like him!

Li Yun raised his head to look in Yang Ye’s direction, but he was stunned again. Because Yang Ye was 3km away, and Yu Wushuang was in Yang Ye’s arms!

At this moment, Li Yun finally came to an understanding. It wasn’t just Li Yun, all the others here came to an understanding as well.

Yang Ye’s target had never been Seng Yuan, nor had it been Li Yun. It had always been to save Yu Wushuang!

All of them had been tricked!

Li Yun was livid. After all, a dignified Saint from Sky Divine Hall like him had actually been tricked by a Half-Saint. It would be an extraordinary humiliation that followed him for his lifetime!

“Die!” Li Yun roared furiously as he clenched his right fist, and then he punched it forward in Yang Ye’s direction!

Over 5km away, Yang Ye was flashing madly towards the distance while holding Yu Wushuang in his arms. This time, he’d utilized the Sword Control Technique and Laws of Speed. So long as he vanished from Li Yun’s field of vision, then he could utilize the Sword Domain to conceal their auras. At that time, they would be able to escape this calamity!

While his plan was sound, reality was cruel.

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically as a sense of danger suddenly swept throughout his body. Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to immediately activate the Dimensional Cube.

Bang!

He’d only just activated it when he sensed a powerful force come from outside the barriers of the Dimensional Cube. The powerful force caused him to spit out a mouthful of blood while Yu Wushuang did the same as well. Fortunately, Yang Ye had endured most of the pressure, so her internal organs were only slightly damaged.

Li Yun’s attack had caused Yang Ye and Yu Wushuang to be instantly injured. However, the force of the attack had instantly blasted them around 10km away into the dense forest ahead.

“You think you can flee?” Yang Ye and Yu Wushuang had just been blasted into the forest when Li Yun’s voice resounded once more, and then a huge palm slapped down from the sky.

Bang!

Everything within an area of 3km of that forest was instantly obliterated!

At the same time, Yang Ye and Yu Wushuang appeared within Li Yun’s field of vision. At this moment, Yang Ye was holding tightly onto Yu Wushuang, and the Dimension Cube surrounded them. While the Dimension Cube had stopped that horrifying attack, it wasn’t easy for Yang Ye. At this moment, blood was flowing from the corner of his mouth, and his face was ghastly pale. Conversely, Yu Wushuang was in a much better state. After all, Yang Ye had endured 99% of the remaining force that came from Li Yun’s attack.

Yu Wushuang gazed at him and said, “Put me down and flee!”

Slap!

Yang Ye smacked Yu Wushuang on the butt and shouted, “Shut up! From now onwards, cling on to my back.” The tiny vortex was in a closed state, and he couldn’t place anyone in there. As for the ancient sheath, the Sword Spirit was in deep sleep, so he didn’t dare to place her in there as well. So, he had no other choice but to carry her on his back.

After he placed her on his back, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light and shot towards the distance again. Moreover, he’d only just flashed off when Li Yun appeared where he was standing an instant ago.

“You’re trying to flee before me? How laughable!” Li Yun laughed coldly, and then he vanished on the spot.

An instant later, Li Yun appeared before Yang Ye.

However, Yang Ye didn’t try to continue fleeing this time. Yang Ye stood on the spot with his eyes closed, and an intent sword was pressed against the center of his forehead. Meanwhile, Yu Wushuang was sitting weakly on the ground.

Li Yun ridiculed, “What? You’re not going to continue running?”

Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes.

Right at the instant that Yang Ye’s eyes opened, Li Yun’s expression instantly changed drastically!
