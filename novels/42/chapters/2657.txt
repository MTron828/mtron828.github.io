Chapter 2658 – First God!

Yang Ye had a truly strange expression on his face!

Yang Ye had bragged in the past, but he’d never bragged like this. This fellow before him was clearly going too far. Of course, that wasn’t even the main problem, the main problem was that the other party was right within the Primordial Pagoda.

The woman in black had heard her clearly!

In the Primordial Pagoda, the woman in black had indifference on her face, and it was like she’d never heard the Yin Yang Goddess.

Actually, Yang Ye was very well aware that Yin Yang Goddess was probably finished in the future.

The woman in black didn’t just have a very bad temper, she was extremely vengeful too.

Meanwhile, Yin Yang Goddess suddenly asked, “What? You don’t believe me?”

Yang Ye blinked and spoke seriously, “Your ability to be here proves how strong you are.”𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

It was a very ambiguous answer!

He couldn’t flatter Yin Yang Goddess now, because if he did that, the woman in black would flare up!

Yin Yang Goddess cracked a smile upon hearing Yang Ye speak so well of her, “Of course.”

She glanced at the sky and sighed softly, “Even then… Sigh…”

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

She shook her head and sighed, “Being invincible is so lonely!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

A short while later, he hesitated for a moment and said, “Senior, I don’t want to stay here. Maybe you have a way to send me back down there?”

Yin Yang Goddess was about to speak when Yang Ye hurriedly added, “I’m weak, so heading back is absolutely difficult. However, with your heaven defying strength, sending me back would only take a snap of the finger!”

He cupped his fist to her and continued, “Please give me your help!”

Yin Yang Goddess seemed hesitant, “Um…”

Yang Ye’s face dimmed down, “Senior, even you can’t do it?”

“Of course not!” She suddenly explained, “B-But my objective is to go above the 9th layer… If I help you return, I will have to break through space all the way to the bottom. In that way, the commotion may be a little too huge. At that time…”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Destiny?”

She nodded slightly, “Let me just say that I’m not afraid of her. However, I really don’t want to get entangled with her. It’s a waste of time.”

It was a polite refusal!

Yang Ye sighed softly and was quite disappointed. Meanwhile, Yin Yang Goddess said, “Why do you want to head back? Many wish to come here, to the peak of the Three Dimensional Universe. When you stand here, you will realize that all below you are ants!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “The problem is that it’s completely pointless! We can’t go up there, and staying here is a waste of time! Moreover, even if we can go up there, it doesn’t seem to make a difference!”

Head up there?

He’d been to the border of the Four Dimensional Space. It was a very strange place, and the slightest mistake may result in their deaths. Moreover, he felt that a form of Destiny was definitely guarding that place!

She glanced at Yang Ye and smiled, “That’s true. I didn’t expect you to have some ability. You’re able to discern your own ability clearly. Just that is a great ability!”

She seemed to have thought of something at this point and asked, “Have you heard of my name before you came up here?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and replied, “No, but it’s very normal. You’re an ancient figure, so it’s normal for people of my era to have not heard of you.”

She thought for a moment and replied, “That is true!”

Yang Ye hurriedly added, “Are you interested in heading down there to have some fun?”

“Have some fun?” She was slightly stunned and shook her head, “What is there to do down there? It’s just a bunch of kids down there!”

Yang Ye replied, “Senior, have you heard of Heng Wangu?”

“Heng Wangu?” She frowned slightly, “He’s still alive?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I heard he’s called the number one expert of the ages down there. Moreover, he’s the leader of a world too. I heard that he, Heng Wangu, was invincible through the ages!”

“That’s bullshit!” Yin Yang Goddess cursed, “He’s nothing! Isn’t he ashamed? Invincible?!”

Yang Ye sighed softly, “It can’t be helped. There aren’t many experts down there. So, everyone in our era thinks that Heng Wangu is the top expert through the ages.”

Yin Yang Goddess laughed coldly, “So the idiots come out to reign supreme when the tigers have left?”

She glanced downward and said, “Looks like I should head back and let the world know that I’m the strongest!”

Yang Ye remained indifferent on the outside, but he was overjoyed inside. He knew this fellow took her reputation very seriously!

She glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Kid, who else is down there besides Heng Wangu?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “There’s one known as Tai Huntian, and a saber-wielding expert who has his eyes covered!”

“Tai Huntian?” She frowned slightly, “That old geezer isn’t dead? And Zuo Mu too…”

She gazed at Yang Ye, “Logically speaking, they shouldn’t be going around showing themselves!”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. He naturally wouldn’t tell her that they’d been forced to show themselves.

Meanwhile, she grinned, “Looks like I have to head down there and join in the fun!”

Yang Ye hurriedly nodded to display his agreement, “How can such an era of supremacy do without you?”

She glanced at him and nodded, “You have a sly tongue. You’re definitely not a good person!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

“Right!” She suddenly asked, “Is Qi Bitian down there?”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “I’ve heard of her, but we’ve never met!”

She seemed slightly relieved, “That’s good.”

She glanced at Yang Ye and didn’t say another word.

Yang Ye asked, “Is Qi Bitian formidable?”

Yin Yang Goddess remained calm as she said, “We’re equally matched!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

She looked into the distance, “Before we leave, I must say goodbye to an old friend. Are you coming?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “I’m willing to expand my horizons with you.”

She turned around and walked off. Yang Ye hurried after her.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

The woman in black sat cross-legged before the wooden house. She glanced at Snowy who was snoring now. She wanted to wake Snowy, but she seemed to have thought of something and didn’t wake Snowy in the end.

The mischievous little fellow had actually been very hardworking lately.

A short while later, she shot a glance upward and smiled coldly. No one knew what she was thinking.

…

Outside the pagoda, Yang Ye followed Yin Yang Goddess for around an hour before they stopped below a cliff.

Yang Ye was stunned.

A man was nailed on the cliff wall!

By two strands of sword energy!

Two strands of seemingly material sword energy.

The man’s hair was very long, or it should be said that it was disheveled. He wore a tattered gray robe and was nailed to the cliff wall.

Based on his aura, he was still alive.

Yin Yang Goddess walked over and waved her right hand, a spatial ring soared into the air and arrived before the man.

She said, “I’m leaving for some time. Good luck, Senior!”

Senior?

Yang Ye had quite a weird expression on his face. Because she was an old geezer too, yet she addressed the man as senior?

Yang Ye looked up at the man but couldn’t see the man’s appearance.

Meanwhile, the man spoke abruptly, “Why? Didn’t you want to go above the 9th layer of space? Don’t say I didn’t warn you. Heading up there with your current strength is a dream.”

She spoke in a slightly helpless tone, “Senior, am I that weak?”

The man replied with a question, “Aren’t you weak?”

She puckered her lips and said, “I’m not trying to go above the 9th layer of space, I’m heading down there. I heard Heng Wangu, that old bastard, isn’t dead. It’s quite unusual, so I want to have a look!”

The man said, “Bring more wine when you return!”

She sighed softly, “Senior, with your strength, you can already overcome those two strands of sword energy. So why don’t you?”

“Haha!” He suddenly started roaring with laughter, “Yin Yang Goddess, don’t start scheming like this. Since you’ve kept me company for so many years, I’ll give you a warning, focus on improving your strength. Head above the 9th layer if you can, but don’t force it!”

She spoke coldly, “Qi Bitian and Emperor Li could, so why can’t I?”

The man replied, “Good luck then.”

She shrugged and was about to leave when the man suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, “You’ve taken a disciple?”

She shook her head, “He was sent up here. I’m sending him back down there.”

The man suddenly fell silent, but Yang Ye could sense that the man’s gaze was on him.

A long time later, the man spoke solemnly, “I sense a few familiar auras from you.”

Yang Ye didn’t know what to say.

Meanwhile, Yin Yang Goddess said, “That kid has come into contact with Destiny but is still alive, so it’s very unusual. No, being able to get here itself is very unusual. However, it’s fine because it’s normal for juniors to have some secrets.”

Yang Ye glanced at her and remained silent. He was slightly fearful and felt fortunate that he’d kept his sword hidden.

At this moment, he realized that his Heaven Executor and Past Life couldn’t really be revealed out in the open! Because Destiny was enemies with all of these old existences!

The man didn’t say anything else.

Yin Yang Goddess said, “Senior, farewell!”

She turned around and led Yang Ye away.

Once they left the cliff, Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Senior, who was that?”

She glanced at him and said, “The First God, an old geezer who has lived for countless years. As far as I know, he was the first to try and enter Four Dimensional Space. He was terribly arrogant at the time and annihilated the sprite of the 9th layer of space upon arriving here, but it didn’t take long for him to suffer.”

Yang Ye asked, “Destiny?”

Yin Yang Goddess nodded slightly, “He was nailed to the wall by the strongest among the four of them. She used him to suppress this 9th layer of space for eternity.”

Yang Ye was quite puzzled, “Doesn’t he know how to run?”

She replied indifferently, “The saddest part of it is that there’s a tracker on him. If he leaves, he will die. Sigh, he courted death all those years ago. Why did he have to be so arrogant? Destiny falls before the First God. He wanted to be the first to slaughter Destiny…”
