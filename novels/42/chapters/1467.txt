Chapter 1468 – Sword Of Rebirth!

Yang Ye hadn’t wanted to cause trouble, but in the end, he noticed that even if he didn’t want to cause trouble, trouble still came looking for him.

The old man was trying to take a yard when given an inch and actually wanted a strand of his soul. This made Yang Ye’s temper flare.

If he helped the old man, it was out of kindness; if he refused, it was his right. But the old man wanted to force him. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

That was intolerable!

A ray of sword energy flashed through the chamber, and it instantly arrived before the old man.

The old man suddenly opened his eyes. His eyes were muddy, dim, and lifeless. At this moment, there was a trace of shock in them. Obviously, he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to be able to execute such a terrifying attack!

If it was in the past, then such an attack would be nothing to him. Yet now....

The old man didn’t think too much about it. He pressed his palms over each other and swiftly pushed them forward.

Bang!

A deafening explosion resounded in the chamber. Countless strands of energy swept madly towards the surroundings. However, regardless of whether it was the energy from Yang Ye’s attack or the old man’s attack, both of them instantly vanished without a trace upon coming into contact with the walls of the chamber!

A few moments later, the surroundings returned to calm!

The old man was still there!

Yang Ye stared at the old man, and there was a solemn expression in his eyes. Because the old man had forcefully endured two overlapped Heavenrends, and the old man seemed completely unharmed!

Meanwhile, the old man suddenly said, “That sword of yours and that sword technique are really not bad!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when the old man added, “However, I have an even stronger sword technique. Want to learn it?”

“No!” Yang Ye turned around and walked away once he finished speaking.

“Young man, don’t be rash!” Meanwhile, the old man added, “After all, rashness never ends well.”

Yang Ye paid no attention to the old man and just continued forward. The old man was strong, much stronger than him, and he had no doubt about that. However, he wasn’t afraid. Because the old man was clearly unable to utilize his full strength. It was very difficult for him to kill the old man, but the old man could definitely not stop him if he wanted to leave.

The old man suddenly said, “It’s a sword technique that uses the body as the sword, the heart as the foundation, intent as speed, the soul as the support, the eyes as the blade.... The sword is me, and I’m the sword. It’s a sword technique that can destroy the five elements, and slash through Yin and Yang. When cultivated to the limit, it can even sever the past and present. In other words, it can sever the cycle of reincarnation and karma.”

This time, Yang Ye stopped, and then he turned around to gaze at the old man, “Is it stronger than the technique I just executed?”

“It’s much stronger!” The old man continued, “That technique of yours possessed sufficient strength, and it can destroy the five elements, but it can’t slash through Yin and Yang, nor can it sever past and present. It’s impossible even if you overlap 1,000 of them. Because destroying the five elements is its limit. The reason I say that it has such a limit is because the person who created that technique had definitely not comprehended Yin, Yang, and Rebirth. So, the limit of that technique is only at destroying the five elements.”

“Yin, Yang, and Rebirth?” Yang Ye frowned. He’d heard of this on more than one occasion. Especially the concept of reincarnation and rebirth. He hadn’t thought about it because it was too far away from him, and his main goal for now was to do well in his current lifetime.

The old man pondered deeply for a moment, and then he said, “Let me give you a simple explanation. The Deity Realm is divided into three levels. The Five Element Deity Realm, Yin and Yang, and the cycle of reincarnation. For the five elements, they comprehend time and the rules of the five elements. So, they belong in the level of the five elements. If they comprehend Yin and Yang, then they rise a level higher and attain the Dualism Deity Realm. The realm above it is the Rebirth Deity Realm.”

Yang Ye asked, “They all belong to the Deity Realm?”

The old man shook his head, “That was the case an extremely long time ago. Yet now, the Dualism Realm and Rebirth Realm don’t belong to the Deity Realm. So, the Dualism Realm is above the Deity Realm, and the Rebirth Realm is above the Dualism Realm.”

Yang Ye nodded, “That sword technique you just spoke of was created by a Rebirth Realm expert?”

“No!” The old man said, “It was a sword cultivator at the Dualism Realm who’d spent over a thousand years to create it. He created this technique to kill Rebirth Realm experts.”

“To kill Rebirth Realm experts?” Yang Ye frowned, “Couldn’t he have just cultivated to the Rebirth Realm? Did he have nothing better to do than to waste over a thousand years on researching a technique?!”

“Attain the Rebirth Realm?” The old man shook his head, “It’s easy for you to say. You don’t even know how difficult it is to cultivate to the Rebirth Realm. Because attaining the Rebirth Realm requires one to enter the cycle of reincarnation. Of course, it doesn’t mean you have to take your own life and get reincarnated. It’s to send your consciousness into the cycle of reincarnation to temper itself and comprehend rebirth. You know... many Dualism Realm experts have fallen into eternal slumber because they failed to comprehend rebirth, and their consciousnesses remained within the world of reincarnation. Besides that, some willingly allow themselves to be immersed in the world of reincarnation and are unwilling to return to reality. In short, it’s very, very, very difficult to attain the Rebirth Realm!”

“It’s far away from me!” Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Tell me about that sword cultivator. I’m quite curious about that person!”

The old man said, “That sword cultivator was an extraordinary genius. He wanted to take revenge, but his enemy was at the Rebirth Realm. However, the gap between the Dualism Realm and Rebirth Realm is too great. Even 100 Dualism Realm experts can’t shake a single Rebirth Realm expert. Moreover, he was very clearly aware that he had an extremely slim chance of attaining the Rebirth Realm. He didn’t want to take the risk. It wasn’t because he was afraid of death, and he was just afraid he wouldn’t be able to take revenge. So, he decided to create a technique which could kill Rebirth Realm experts. In the end, he succeeded. Just one swing of his sword! He used just a single swing of the sword to kill a Rebirth Realm expert!”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “Are there any side effects?”

He knew that powerful techniques usually had side effects.

“It depends on the user!” The old man continued, “He didn’t suffer from any side effects when he utilized it that day. But if you utilize it, then the side effects might be really strong. After all, your strength isn’t equal to his. I’m sure you’re aware that utilizing a force that surpasses your own strength will definitely make you suffer a certain amount of backlash.”

It’s just as I expected! Yang Ye nodded and said, “Why is that sword technique in your possession?”

“Because he was an old friend of mine!” The old man continued, “Once he killed his enemy, he had no further reason to live. So, he gave me the technique and asked me to find a good sword cultivator to inherit it.”

Yang Ye gazed at the old man for a long time, and then he said, “Give it to me, and I’ll come save you once I grow stronger.”

The old man spoke indifferently, “Do you think I’m an idiot?”

“Then just keep it and continue waiting!” As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, he didn’t hesitate to turn around and walk away. He was tempted by the sword technique, but he hadn’t lost his mind. The old man’s strength wasn’t ordinary. If he were to release the old man, then forget about obtaining the sword technique, even his survival would be a problem.

The old man suddenly said, “Wait!”

Yang Ye stopped, and then he turned to look at the old man, “What?”

The old man said, “I can only give it to you after you’ve released me!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I can’t free you right now. As I’ve said before, give it to me, and I’ll naturally come to save you once I possess sufficient strength.”

The old man replied, “What if you don’t return?”

Yang Ye looked the old man in the eyes, “Do you have another choice? No, you don’t. You can only choose to trust me. Of course, you can choose to stay here and wait. You can wait until someone else passes by, and then you can drag that fellow down here. Right, I think the day will come when a person you drag down here will be able to save you.”

The old man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he said, “Come back and free me within three years. Swear with your soul that you’ll definitely save me within three years from now.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he said, “Five years. I’m confident in being able to do so if I’m given five years.”

Both of them looked each other in the eye for a long time. In the end, the old man said, “Fine, five years. I’ll wait five years for you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand, and a scroll appeared in front of Yang Ye. Yang Ye didn’t fear it at all and immediately opened it. It didn’t take long for the scroll to transform into a ray of light that entered his forehead.

Yang Ye naturally wasn’t afraid that the old man would play tricks on him. He had the Primordial Pagoda, so he didn’t have to fear anything that entered his body!

It didn’t take long for some information to appear in his mind.

A long time passed before Yang Ye opened his eyes, and he said, “Who can stop my sword? I’ll sever your path to rebirth with one swing!”

The name of the sword technique was Sword of Rebirth!

Sword of Rebirth!

It carried two meanings. Firstly, it could kill experts at the Rebirth Realm. Secondly, it could destroy a person’s path towards reincarnation. In other words, anyone killed by this technique couldn’t be reincarnated!

Besides that, it could sever karma and cycle of reincarnation!

Another formidable sword cultivator! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. The sword technique allowed him to discern how terrifying that sword cultivator was, and that sword cultivators’ attainments in the Sword Dao were probably not inferior to Jian Wuji and the Unfettered One!

However, it did make sense. The world was so huge, and there were so many sword cultivators, so it was absolutely normal for there to be a few peerless sword cultivators.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at the old man, “Five years. I’ll come save you in five years!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around and started walking away.

However, he hadn’t even taken two steps when he stopped again, and then he turned around to gaze at the old man, “Er, Senior, do you have other powerful techniques or treasures? In any case, you have no use for them right now, so why don’t you give them to me?”

The old man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then he said, “I do have many, but my memory is quite bad, so I can’t remember most of them. I think that I should remember some once you return!”

“I understand!” Yang Ye nodded. He didn’t waste his breath again, and he intended to leave.

However, the old man suddenly said, “Kid, let me give you a piece of advice. Don’t go past Yellow Springs River. I don’t want to wait for the next person that gets here.”

Yang Ye asked, “What is on the other side of that river?”

The old man shook his head slightly, “I don’t know. Because those who do know are dead. The Ominous Territory is a forbidden area for your world. However, that place is the forbidden area of the Ominous Territory.”

The forbidden area in the Ominous Territory!
