Chapter 1929 – Want to Fight?

The tiny vortex had started spinning!

There were only two reasons for that. Danger or treasures. Obviously, it was the second possibility right now.

Because he didn’t sense any danger!

Yang Ye was quite curious.

He wondered which treasure within her actually received the favor of the Primordial Pagoda. After all, it was even more picky than Snowy, and it didn’t take a liking to most things.

So, what was it?”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. In the end, he gazed at Snowy. Snowy gazed at him, blinked, and pointed up!

Go up!

Yang Ye gazed at the woman, and the latter hesitated for a moment before she said, “Respected guest, the treasures on the 3rd floor are at the Imperial Rank or above. The 3rd floor is only open to Violet Card members!”

“Violet Card members?” Yang Ye asked, “What’s that?”

She replied, “People who possess a certain level of status or have spent over a thousand immortal crystals in our Immortal Armament Pavilion.”

Over a thousand! Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. He only had over a hundred right now, but he needed over a thousand to become a Violet Card member.

Over a thousand!

Meanwhile, Snowy raised her palm and an immortal crystal appeared on her claw. She passed it over to the woman.

The woman smiled at Snowy and gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head and smiled, “One isn’t enough, she wants a thousand!”

A thousand!

Snowy raised her claws and started counting. It didn’t take long for her eyes to open wide, and then she looked up at the woman and started waving her claws.

The woman gazed at Yang Ye and asked, “Is she saying something?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The woman asked, “What is she saying?”

Yang Ye rubbed his nose and replied, “She’s saying that’s robbery!”

The woman was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, Snowy gazed at Yang Ye and raised her claws. She was asking him what they should do because they didn’t have that many immortal crystals!

“What else can we do?” Yang Ye spoke helplessly, “We can only leave!”

Snowy pointed up and started waving her claws.

There was an extremely precious treasure up there.

That was what she was telling him!

Yang Ye said, “Then what should we do? It’s our fault for not having that much money?”

Snowy blinked, secretly shot a glance at the woman, and then flew over to Yang Ye and waved her claws lightly.

Take it by force!

That was what Snowy was telling Yang Ye!

Yang Ye had quite the headache. Snowy was growing to become more and more like a bandit. He rubbed her head and said, “We can’t do that. Understand?”

Meanwhile, Snowy moved her claws slightly.

She was telling him to steal it instead!

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Snowy clenched both her claws and just gazed at Yang Ye. She was waiting for Yang Ye to make his decision.

Yang Ye pinched her plump cheeks and said, “We don’t need it. Understand?”

Snowy wanted to say something, but Yang Ye took her in his arms and left.

He had to take her away as soon as possible!

Because he knew that Snowy was very good at tricking treasures into following her. If she did that and brought it into the Primordial Pagoda, then he would be in big trouble. Because once it went into the Primordial Pagoda and the Primordial Pagoda wanted it, then he could dream of taking it out again!

However, both Snowy and the Primordial Pagoda wouldn’t take responsibility for it!

Yang Ye would have to take responsibility!

Run!

Right when Yang Ye and Snowy were walking out, three people appeared at the entrance. It was two men and a woman. They were just walking in from the outside, and they just happened to obstruct Yang Ye’s path.

The man on the left suddenly said, “It’s you!”

Yang Ye looked towards the source of the voice, and he was stunned. It was none other than Gu Bang from the Endless Ocean!

Enemies really were destined to meet!

Yang Ye shrugged and intended to leave, but Gu Bang suddenly obstructed Yang Ye’s path and smiled, “Brother, why are you trying to leave right after we met? We…”

Yang Ye suddenly interrupted him, “Brother? Are we close?”

Gu Bang’s face stiffened, but it didn’t take long for it to return to normal, “While there was some conflict between us, it’s in the past. I’ve already let it go. Could it be that you still…?”

“I don’t want to waste my breath on you.” Yang Ye ignored Gu Bang, “Move aside!”

Gu Bang’s face fell. Meanwhile, the man on Gu Bang’s right suddenly asked, “Brother Gu Bang, who is he?”

Gu Bang replied, “He… he’s a human!”

A human!

The man by Gu Bang’s side frowned when he heard this, and he gazed at Yang Ye, “A human? What are you doing here?”

Yang Ye turned to look at the man. The man was around the age of 25. He wore luxurious clothes and was clearly not ordinary.

Yang Ye said, “What? Is my presence here against the law?”

The man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Are you trying to be haughty?”

Yang Ye took a step forward and arrived before the man, and then he looked the man in the eyes, “Want to fight?”

Fight!

The man was slightly stunned. Obviously, he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to say that and even be so direct about it!

An instant later, a cold smile curled up on the corners of his mouth, “I do!”

“Our shop can’t endure your presence here!” Meanwhile, the woman in a green dress suddenly walked out of the shop and smiled, “If you want to spar, please go to the Combat Arena or Life and Death Arena!”

“Of course!” Meanwhile, the man smiled, “I, Fan Yao, dare not cause trouble in Miss Qing’er’s shop. Miss Zhu’er, please send my regards to Miss Qing’er when you see her.”

Zhu’er grinned. She didn’t refuse but didn’t agree either.

Fan Yao smiled and gazed at Yang Ye, “Human, do you dare to fight me in the Life and Death Arena?”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Zhu’er suddenly said, “As its name implies, the Life and Death Arena is where life and death are decided.”

Yang Ye glanced at her and smiled, “Thanks for the warning!”

He gazed at Fan Yao and continued, “Come on, let’s go to the Life and Death Arena. Wait, I have to do something before that!”

Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot.

Gu Bang’s expression changed drastically when Yang Ye vanished, and his figure shot backwards. In an instant, he was over 100m away from the entrance to the shop. However, he was still caught off guard, and a fist slammed against his chest.

Boom!

A mouthful of blood sprayed from his mouth. But that wasn’t the end of it, Yang Ye’s fist suddenly unfurled into a claw that shot up and grabbed Gu Bang’s throat.

Gu Bang’s figure instantly stiffened!

Everyone here was stunned. None of them had expected Yang Ye to suddenly attack, even Gu Bang hadn’t. Gu Bang hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually attack him in the shop. After all, even Fan Yao didn’t dare to act rashly in there!

Suddenly, Yang Ye slammed Gu Bang against the ground.

Boom!

The ground cracked open while blood sprayed towards the surroundings! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye stomped his foot down on Gu Bang’s right face, slamming Gu Bang’s face against the rocks on the ground. Yang Ye pressed down slightly as he said, “You’re looking for trouble with me?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he kicked Gu Bang in the stomach.

Bang!

Gu Bang’s figure flew away and slammed against a wall in the distance.

Gu Bang’s figure curled up and twitched incessantly on the ground.

Yang Ye’s kick had broken all the veins within him!

Yang Ye patted his hands and gazed at Fan Yao, “Didn’t you want to go to the Life and Death Arena? What are you still standing there for? Lead the way!”

Fan Yao stared at Yang Ye, “Humans really are lowly beings. You actually took him by surprise. If you didn’t, would you…”

Yang Ye suddenly shrugged, “Come, I’ll let you take me by surprise. Come on, do it!”

Fan Yao’s face instantly became unsightly. He was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly shrugged, “I don’t have time to waste on you. Let’s go. Don’t waste your breath if you can just use your fists!”

Fan Yao spoke fiercely, “Since you want to die, I’ll fulfill your wish!”

He transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the distance.

Yang Ye tapped his right foot down lightly and vanished as well.

In the Immortal Armament Pavilion, a woman had suddenly appeared in front of Zhu’er.

The woman shook her head slightly, “Fan Yao is courting death!”

Surprise flashed through Zhu’er’s eyes, “Young Miss, Fan Yao is at the 2nd stage of the Enlightened Realm, and that man doesn’t seem to have attained the Enlightened Realm!”

The woman replied, “Realms of cultivation aren’t always the only standard to determine a person’s strength. Go find out who he is.”

“Yes!” Zhu’er turned around and left.

Once she left, the woman went to the 3rd level. She walked to a pillar of light, and there was a ball of fiery red light in there.

She gazed at it for a long time before she said, “Why did you come here on your own?”

A moment of silence ensued, and then the ball of light suddenly trembled. A moment later, the pillar of light shattered.

At the same time, the other pillars of light around the woman started to tremble.

Fear!

The treasures here which surpassed the Imperial Rank were feeling fear!

Suddenly, the ball of red light vanished on the spot.

The pillars of light in the surroundings gradually calmed down once it left.

The woman frowned instead. There was a solemn expression in her eyes, “An evil treasure… A powerful evil spirit. An evil treasure that strengthens itself by devouring its master… I didn’t expect such a treasure to really exist…”

The woman was about to chase after it, but a voice suddenly resounded, “It will only bring trouble. Let it go!”

She asked, “Where is it going?”

A moment of silence ensued before the voice resounded again, “To select its master!”
