Chapter 1838 – Sky Of Blood!

The Sword Domain!

He hadn’t utilized it in a very, very long time. The reason he hadn’t wasn’t because it was useless, it was because he hadn’t truly grasped it. Moreover, the enlightenment he received from the Unfettered One and Li Taibai made him temporarily decide to put the Sword Domain aside.

Because his sword intent and attainments in the Sword Dao were too weak, pursuing the Sword Domain then was like reaching beyond his grasp. Thus, he’d forgotten about it and pursued the essence of the Sword Dao and sword intent!

Besides that, there was one other reason why he hadn’t utilized it!

It was because it was extremely dangerous to use the Sword Domain in battle. Once his opponent’s strength far surpassed his own, then his Domain wouldn’t be able to endure his opponent’s strength, and he would have to pay with his lifespan!

It was a huge risk!

Yet now, he had no choice but to risk his life!

As soon as the Sword Domain was activated, a wave of mysterious energy enveloped the surroundings, and then Yang Ye’s senses towards the surroundings multiplied. At this moment, even the sound of an ant’s breathing could be sensed clearly!

Counterattack!

Yang Ye immediately used the Sword Domain to counterattack and suppress the Night Emperor’s energy. It worked because as soon as the Sword Domain appeared here, the energy on the three of them started vanishing slowly.

The Night Emperor frowned, “A Domain…. How surprising!”

Boom!

Meanwhile, an explosion resounded from within the Sword Domain, and then Yang Ye looked up at the Night Emperor.

At this moment, he’d obliterated the Night Emperor’s energy.

A moment later, Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot and appeared before the Night Emperor.

A speck of cold light appeared before the Night Emperor’s forehead!

Yang Ye’s sword was there!

The Night Emperor suddenly stretched out his hand, and cold light flickered at the center of it.

Bang!

As soon as the sword and palm collided, both of them were pushed backwards repeatedly. Yang Ye was pushed around 30m back before he used the Sword Domain to force himself to a stop. As for the Night Emperor, he was pushed around 150m back.

This time, Yang Ye had gained the upper hand in the collision by relying on the Sword Domain.

However, Yang Ye’s hair started to turn white.

It was the price he paid!

When fighting a force that surpassed a person’s limits, the person would have to pay a heavy price!

The Night Emperor sized up Yang Ye and chuckled, “As expected of a Domain. It’s much stronger than any form of intent. Unfortunately, you’re too weak when compared to me, so it can’t save you.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he tapped his finger in Yang Ye’s direction.

Hiss!

A beam of cold light surged forward. It was absolutely swift. Even Yang Ye wasn’t able to see its trajectory clearly, but when it arrived around 30 before him, it started to slow down.

It was as slow as a tortoise when it arrived before Yang Ye.

Suppression!

The Sword Domain suppressed everything.

The Night Emperor’s eyes narrowed slightly at the sight of this, and there was a trace of seriousness in his eyes.

Obviously, he hadn’t expected his attack to be suppressed like that!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and looked up at the Night Emperor, and then he vanished on the spot.

The Grand Teleportation Technique combined with Split Second!

The Grand Teleportation Technique combined with Split Second was the limit of his speed, and it was the limit of his strength. Yet now, it was being executed within the Sword Domain, so its might had improved by countless times.

However, as soon as he executed it, the hair by his ear turned snowy white!

The Night Emperor’s expression changed when Yang Ye executed this ultimate move of his.

Danger!

At this moment, the Night Emperor felt danger!

Meanwhile, the Night Emperor suddenly turned around and said, “Defend!”

As soon as he said that, a black vortex suddenly appeared behind him, and then Yang Ye’s wooden sword stabbed it.

Bang!

A rumbling explosion resounded, and then the space in a huge area around them cracked apart and collapsed. Moreover, the damage was spreading rapidly towards the surroundings. In just a short breath of time, the space in an enormous area around them seemed like spiderwebs were running through it!

As for Yang Ye and the Night Emperor, they stood motionlessly on the spot!

Yang Ye’s sword was still pressed against the vortex!

Suddenly, Yang Ye grabbed the wooden sword with both hands and twisted it.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the Night Emperor was blasted over 1km back.

Even though he’d blasted the Night Emperor back, the hair behind Yang Ye’s head had turned snow white.

Presently, he was using the Sword Domain to fight the Night Emperor, but the Night Emperor’s strength far surpassed his own. So, while he could use the Sword Domain to suppress the Night Emperor, he paid with his lifespan for every single attack he executed!

I can’t let this go on!

This time, his opponent could afford to go on like this, but he couldn’t!

The Night Emperor turned to gaze at Yang Ye, “I’ve lived for tens of thousands of years, and I surmounted my realm of cultivation to challenge countless experts. I never imagined that a day would come where someone would surmount their realm of cultivation against me. Needless to say, it really doesn’t feel good!”

He stretched out his hands and waved them lightly.

As his hands moved, the space around Yang Ye started to ripple like waves.

“Suppress!” Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s voice resounded, and then the rippling space gradually calmed down.

The Night Emperor suddenly said, “Rise!”

As soon as he said that, the space, which had just calmed down, suddenly started trembling. At the same time, waves of terrifying energy suddenly surged out from there, and then the ground below started to quake and collapse without end.

A vicious glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, and then he stomped his right foot down, “Destroy!”

Boom!

In an instant, the space in a huge area collapsed and was destroyed, causing the surroundings to be turned pitch black. However, it didn’t affect them at all.

A breath of time later, the surroundings returned to normal.

The Night Emperor was staring at Yang Ye. A moment later, he clenched his right fist and slammed it at Yang Ye.

Hiss!

An energy fist suddenly appeared before him, and then it instantly shot towards Yang Ye.

One the energy fist appeared, the space before the Night Emperor warped severely. Especially the space where the energy fist passed through, it was instantly twisted.

However, the energy fist was growing slower and slower.

When it arrived around 3m away from Yang Ye, it was like the speed of a crawling tortoise.

Yang Ye looked the Night Emperor in the eyes and said, “Shatter!”

As soon as he said that, space shook violently, and then the energy fist exploded apart and transformed into nothingness. It was like it had never been there.

Meanwhile, the hair on the top of Yang Ye’s head had turned snow white.

The Night Emperor gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “It’s the first time I’m witnessing such a strange and miraculous force. Needless to say, you’re invincible while you have the Sword Domain. Unfortunately, it’s only your defenses that are impregnable, and you’re not really skilled at using it in attacks. Moreover, based on the current condition you’re in, you’re enduring energy that far surpasses your own. So, you’re suffering from backlash, right?”

Yang Ye didn’t answer the Night Emperor. He gazed at Blood Maiden and Blind Maiden, “Leave.”

Just as the Night Emperor had said, his current strength wasn’t capable of doing anything to the Night Emperor. Even though the Night Emperor wasn’t as strong as Shao Siyou, he wasn’t weak. At the very least, he was much stronger than Yang Ye right now.

Simply speaking, Yang Ye couldn’t do anything against the Night Emperor, and the Night Emperor merely couldn’t harm Yang Ye for now!

If this continued, all of them would die here!

Blood Maiden and Blind Maiden stayed silent for a few breaths of time, and then Blood Maiden suddenly took Blind Maiden’s hand. As for her other hand, it was on her own throat instead.

This stunned both Yang Ye and the Night Emperor.

What’s she doing?

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s expression changed because Blood Maiden’s nails had pierced through the skin on her throat.

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “Second Sister, what are you doing?”

Blood Maiden didn’t answer him.

More and more blood was flowing from her throat.

Meanwhile, tears seeped out from the corners of Blind Maiden’s eyes.

Yang Ye was about to say something when Blind Maiden nodded, and then Blood Maiden released her.

A moment later, Blood Maiden and Blind Maiden appeared before Yang Ye. Blood Maiden stretched out her hand and rubbed Yang Ye’s head before she spoke softly, “Live on!”

Yang Ye wanted to say something, but Blind Maiden suddenly wrapped her arm around him, and a strand of energy entered his mind. Yang Ye was caught off guard by this, and he was instantly rendered unconscious.

Blind Maiden gazed at Blood Maiden. She didn’t say a word, but pearls of tears were ceaselessly seeping out from the corners of her eyes.

Blood Maiden said, “Go!”

As soon as she finished speaking, the blood around her flickered.

Blind Maiden gazed at Blood Maiden for quite a while, and then she turned around, took Yang Ye in her arms, and vanished into the sky.

The Night Emperor glanced at Blind Maiden and Yang Ye, and then he gazed at Blood Maiden, “Come! Let me see how you’re going to stop me!”

Blood Maiden took a deep breath, stepped forward, and then a wave of mysterious energy appeared around her.

The Blood Domain!

The Night Emperor’s eyes narrowed slightly when he sensed it, “You have a Domain too. But… that isn’t a true Domain. It’s a Pseudo Domain that’s developed by possessing extreme attainments in a certain aspect. It’s very rare as well.”

Suddenly, Blood Maiden took a deep breath, and then she closed her eyes slowly, “Body into blood, and blood into the sky!”

As soon as she finished speaking, her body suddenly started to expand while strands of violent and powerful energy seeped out incessantly from within her.

The Night Emperor’s expression changed at the sight of it, “You’ve gone mad! You’re actually going to detonate yourself?! You’re sacrificing decades of cultivating for that kid? Is it worth it?”

Blood Maiden opened her eyes and gazed at the Night Emperor, “He calls me second sister!”

Boom!

As soon as she finished speaking, Blood Maiden’s body exploded apart. In an instant, the space in an enormous area was transformed into an ocean of blood.
