Chapter 2299 – Geniuses Must Die!

A head!

Blood was still dripping from the head, and its face was covered in shock.

Yang Ye!

No one in Eternal Border didn’t know that name!

Yang Ye tossed away the head, and the black sword in his grasp immediately transformed into countless vengeful spirits that pounced at it.

The stronger the expert, the stronger they would grow upon devouring it.

They could be considered to be a match made in heaven!

Suddenly, over a dozen people appeared not too far away from the hall, and they were from the various powers.

Two of them were the True Dao Realm experts from the Nanli Clan who’d just left.

Nanli Yu stared at Yang Ye, “Bai Zhixian, I didn’t expect you to have gotten together with Yang Ye.”

Bai Zhixian glanced at Nanli Yu and said, “If I were you, I would leave.”

Nanli Yu revealed a ferocious smile, “If I’m not wrong, both of you joined forces and killed my younger brother, right?”

Bai Zhixian closed her eyes slowly and remained silent.

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and then a black sword slashed down from above Nanli Yu.

Nanli Yu’s expression changed drastically, and an ethereal black shield appeared above him.

The sword descended.

Bang!

The black shield instantly exploded apart, and the powerful force of the collision blasted him far away. However, that wasn’t the end of it because another ray of black light flashed.

Nanli Yu was shocked. He stomped his foot down and soared up into the air before slamming his fist forward.

Boom!

A red vortex suddenly appeared in front of Nanli Yu, and then a wave of powerful flames rippled out from it. However, as soon as Yang Ye’s sword descended, the flames were obliterated in just an instant.

Suddenly, a powerful aura assaulted Yang Ye from the left.

It was the True Dao Realm expert from the Nanli Clan.

Yang Ye stopped on the spot and just swung his sword without even looking.

Hiss!

The aura was instantly destroyed.

Yang Ye intended to attack again, but Bai Zhixian appeared by his side and took his hand, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye’s figure trembled, and then his sword gradually turned ethereal.

“Bai Zhixian!” Suddenly, Nanli Yu laughed ferociously, “You’re actually with Yang Ye. Good, very good! Let me see who can save your White Emperor City now!”

Yang Ye stopped.

Nanli Yu’s expression changed, and then he vanished on the spot. The other True Dao Realm expert from the Nanli Clan followed him and left too.

Bai Zhixian was stunned, and so were the other experts here.

They’d fled!

Two True Dao Realm experts had fled!

But it didn’t take long for them to realize why. Yang Ye was influenced by his madness intent right now, so it could be said that a single True Dao Realm expert was very likely to be instantly killed by him; two True Dao Realm experts weren’t able to do anything to him; and three True Dao Realm experts could barely resist him. It would take at least four or even five True Dao Realm experts to suppress Yang Ye. But the Nanli Clan only had two here!

If Yang Ye and Bai Zhixian joined forces, they would definitely die.

So, Nanli Yu had decisively chosen to flee!

They would die if they didn’t!

Bai Zhixian shook her head slightly and walked away while holding Yang Ye’s hand. Meanwhile, an old man with a sword on his back appeared in front of them.

It was Exalt Yu from Sword Sky City!

Exalt Yu glanced at Yang Ye, and then he gazed at Bai Zhixian, “White Empress, is he…”

She shook her head slightly, “Do you need something?”

Exalt Yu replied, “No, I just wanted to warn you that a True Dao Realm expert from the Shiyuan Clan left earlier. If I’m not wrong, he has gone to notify the Shiyuan Clan. Moreover, the other powers are probably itching to make their move too. After all, no one doesn’t desire the treasures in his possession.”

Bai Zhixian glanced at him, “What about Sword Sky City?”

Exalt Yu smiled, “We have an agreement with him. So, we hold no hostility toward him.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “There’s enmity between him and the Immortal Estate. So, it won’t be easy for you to enter the Immortal Estate safely later.”

Bai Zhixian fell silent.

The Immortal Estate!

The Eternal Secret Realm was under the Immortal Estate’s control. Or to be more precise, its entrance was under the Immortal Estate’s control. The other powers had to gain the Immortal Estate’s agreement to enter it. Moreover, after they went inside and returned, they had to give the Immortal Estate 50% of all the Eternal Crystals they obtained. Of course, the Immortal Estate considered that as the compensation for purchasing the Eternal Tokens. However, the Eternal Tokens were actually completely useless!

But no one dared to refuse.

The Immortal Estate was the most powerful organization in the entire Eternal Border. So, unless all the others joined forces against it, they would have no chance of winning.

Meanwhile, Exalt Yu said, “Shiyuan Xing is probably on the way right now.”

Bai Zhixian immediately took Yang Ye’s hand and walked off into the distance.

Exalt Yu glanced at them and frowned. No one knew what he was thinking.

Yang Ye was very terrifying, but the more terrifying he was, the more determined many would be to kill him.

Especially the six clans.

The three sects weren’t desperate to kill him because they had chosen not to attack Yang Ye as they didn’t want to let the other sects take advantage. But the six clans were different. Besides the Shiyuan Clan, the other five clans had even joined forces just to seize those three treasures.

Now, Yang Ye was even stronger than before, so all the six clans were definitely afraid. Especially the Shiyuan Clan. If Yang Ye survived, they would never have a moment of peace. As for the other clans, they may risk everything to kill Yang Ye because they were worried of his revenge.

Besides that, there was the Immortal Estate too.

The Immortal Estate was very, very strong. The stronger an organization was, the greater their aversion toward someone who may become a threat to them. After all, Yang Ye possessed Progenitor Realm sword intent and slaughter intent, and even True Dao Realm intent at his age. The worst part was that he possessed the Sword Domain! Besides that, he had so many treasures. Especially the Primordial Axe of Creation. Once it allowed Yang Ye to use it, then even the Immortal Estate would have to fear him!

The Limitless Sword Master who was once renowned throughout Eternal Border wasn’t as dazzling as Yang Ye at the same age!

The more dazzling and monstrous Yang Ye was, the more they would want him dead. Unless he was so strong that they didn’t dare to act against him, of course. Unfortunately, Yang Ye wasn’t that strong now!

A vile cycle had formed between them.

Exalt Yu shook his head and left.

…

Yang Ye had shown himself!

News of this quickly spread throughout Eternal Border.

Initial City. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The auras of four powerful experts surged up into the air from within Initial City, and then they vanished into the sky.

Four True Dao Realm experts!

This time, all of the True Dao Realm experts of the Shiyuan Clan had set out!

Besides the Shiyuan Clan, countless experts left the Nanli Clan, Beichuan Clan, Hanyuan Clan, Luoli Clan, and Yue Clan’s main cities and vanished into the boundless expanses of outer space.

The entire Eternal Border was alarmed!

The experts of all six clans had left their cities!

Moreover, all of them were traveling in the same direction!

On a mountain, a woman stood proudly there.

There was a huge black sword on her back.

She was Jian You from Sword Ruins.

Jian You looked up at the boundless starry sky, and a long time passed before she spoke softly, “6 True Void Realm experts, 17 True Dao Realm experts… They haven’t just sent all their experts, even their patriarchs have set out. Looks like they want to annihilate him. Should I go or not?”

The True Dao Realm was divided into three smaller stages, the True Dao Realm, True Void Realm, and True World Realm.

Jian You fell silent, and a long time passed before a white little fellow appeared in her mind.

Snowy!

As soon as she thought of Snowy, she twisted her right foot against the ground.

A ray of sword energy shot up into the air!

…

Eternal Immortal City.

Bai Zhixian swiftly led Yang Ye toward the depths of the city, and her face was unprecedentedly solemn.

Yang Ye being exposed had messed up all her plans.

She was very well aware that if they couldn’t enter the Eternal Secret Realm soon, they would have to face over a dozen or even more True Dao Realm experts.

They would never let Yang Ye live!

Especially the Shiyuan Clan. If she were the patriarch of the Shiyuan Clan, she would absolutely stop at nothing to kill Yang Ye. That was what she’d thought when Yang Ye had woken up that day. Because a person like Yang Ye would cause endless troubles to them if he remained alive! Especially when he was such a vengeful person.

So, they had to get into the Eternal Secret Realm!

Bai Zhixian pulled Yang Ye along as she sped up.

It didn’t take long for them to arrive at the center of the city, and a huge blue door stood before them. Blue light flowed within the door, and it frequently emanated horrifying and strange sounds.

“Let’s go!” Bai Zhixian pulled Yang Ye toward the door, but an old man suddenly appeared in front of them.

There was a tiny “仙” character on his left chest.

He was from the Immortal Estate.

Bai Zhixian flicked two Eternal Tokens to the old man, but the old man waved his right hand and blasted them into bits.

Bai Zhixian’s face fell from the sight of this.

Meanwhile, the old man ridiculed, “You want to leave? Bai Zhixian, you must be dreaming. Needless to say, you’re really brave to actually get together with Yang Ye. Don’t you know that my Immortal Estate is determined to kill him? We’d planned to locate that mysterious sword cultivator first, and deal with him first before dealing with White Emperor City, but we never expected you to actually…”

Bai Zhixian interrupted the old man, “Old dog, I advise you to fuck off!”

A hideous expression instantly covered the old man’s face. However, Yang Ye’s figure suddenly appeared before him, and then a sword descended.

The Sword Domain combined with True Dao Realm madness intent, and countless vengeful spirits!

The old man’s pupils constricted to the size of needles!

Bang!

A terrifying aura swept out from within him. At the same time, a fist slammed at Yang Ye’s sword.

Hiss!

The sword descended, and the old man’s body was instantly sliced into two, causing blood and internal organs to spray all over the ground.

However, the old man’s soul had left his body at the critical moment and fled into the sky.

Yang Ye was about to pursue the old man when Bai Zhixian’s expression suddenly changed drastically. She didn’t even hesitate to drag Yang Ye into the blue door of light.

Right at the instant they left, Shiyuan Xing suddenly appeared where Yang Ye had been standing, and four other middle aged men and a beautiful woman were by his side.

The six patriarchs were all here!

Shiyuan Xing gazed at the door of light for a long time, and then he said, “He must die!”
