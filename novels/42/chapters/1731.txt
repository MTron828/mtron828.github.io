Chapter 1732 - Strange! Very Strange!

The master of the Divine Yin Flame was the original owner of the pagoda, of course!

The old man in Daoist’s robes has arrived? This was the first thought that appeared in Yang Ye’s head.

Meanwhile, the Divine Yin Flame said, “He isn’t here.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Didn’t you say that you sensed his aura?”

The Divine Yin Flame replied, “It may be his aura that he left behind in this medium universe, and it isn’t him. If it was him, he would have come for us.”

“Aura he left behind?” Yang Ye frowned slightly, “You’re saying that he stayed in the medium universe in the past?”

“Of course!” The Divine Yin Flame said, “They comprehended and attained the Dao in the small universe, and then left the small universe for the medium universe. Of course, it wasn’t called the medium universe then. He wasn’t the only one, many other ancient cultivators had once resided in the medium universe. In the end, some left, but some may have not left!”

He paused for a moment and continued, “The aura I just spoke of may have appeared because his old abode in the medium universe was discovered.”

An abode! Yang Ye was stunned. Is it that ancient ruin that Yang Lianshuang spoke of? It was left behind by the old man in Daoist’s robes?

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “Do you know its location?”

The Divine Yin Flame replied, “I don’t!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Weren’t you by his side? Why don’t you know?”

“It has been too long!” The Divine Yin Flame said, “Moreover, my consciousness hadn’t fully formed at that time. So, I know very little about the medium universe.”

Yang Ye asked, “Can you follow the aura and find the abode?”

“I can’t!” The Divine Yin Flame explained, “The aura appeared just now, but it vanished a moment later.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time and said, “Let’s put it aside for now and head to that ancient ruin!”

He vanished from the Primordial Pagoda once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he vanished on the spot.

Over a million kilometers away from Sword Immortal City was a mountain. The mountain was over 30km tall and stretched from over 50km. It was eternally covered in mist, so its true form was impossible to discern.

It was called Moment Mountain. It was where the ancient ruin was discovered by the eight clans, and it was Yang Ye’s destination.

The eight clans hadn’t notified the public of their discovery. It was naturally because they wanted to keep it for themselves. Of course, even if others found out, they wouldn’t dare to try and get in while the eight clans had joined forces!

At the foot of Moment Mountain, there were eight old men here.

All of them were True Realm experts!

There was a thin blue barrier of light not too far away from them, and it was right before a cave entrance.

At this moment, there was a gap in the barrier.

Meanwhile, all eight of them attacked once more. Eight beams of light that were in various different colors slammed against the barrier.

Boom!

The barrier shook violently, but it didn’t shatter, but more cracks had appeared on it.

They continued their assault!

Around an hour later, a loud explosion suddenly resounded through the silence of Moment Mountain, and then the entire mountains shook violently while the barrier of light shattered.

Another hour later, rays of light surged over through the sky, and then figures descended before the eight old men.

There were over 30 of them, and all of them were at the age of 30 or below.

They were the successors, young masters, and young misses of the eight clans.

Suddenly, an old man in luxurious robes gazed at an old man in violet robes, “Yang Lin, is your clan’s Yang Ye not coming?”

Yang Ye!

Everyone gazed at Yang Lin when they heard this name.

Presently, everyone throughout the medium universe had heard of Yang Ye’s name! Especially Yang Ye’s deeds outside Sword Immortal City, it had shocked the entire medium universe.

However, many were looking at Yang Lin right now, but most of their eyes had amusement and ridicule in them.

The Yang Clan had two geniuses, Yang Lianshuang and Yang Ye. But they were very well aware that the Yang Clan’s relationship with both those geniuses wasn’t very good. There was no need to mention their relationship with Yang Ye as it was obvious that it would only end with the death of one party!

There was no room for reconciliation!

As for Yang Lianshuang, it was common knowledge that the rules set by the Yang Clan’s ancestor prohibited a female patriarch. Actually, it was very normal, and they understood it well. Because their own clans didn’t allow it either.

Women would be married off in the end. Once they were married, wouldn’t the Yang Clan belong to someone else?

Even though the likelihood of that was quite small, the Yang Clan wouldn’t take that risk.

However, Yang Lianshuang’s natural talent was too great, and she was too strong. She was so strong that the Yang Clan was barely able to suppress her. It was exactly the most depressing thing that the Yang Clan faced. If Yang Lianshuang was male, then she would definitely be the next patriarch. Unfortunately, she wasn’t, and it was exactly why irreconcilable conflict arose between Yang Lianshuang and many higher-ups of the Yang Clan!

Needless to say, the Yang Clan was quite pitiable. It had two peerless geniuses, but both couldn’t be of use to the Yang Clan!

While it was a pity for the Yang Clan, it was great news for the other clans.

They wished for nothing more than to see the Yang Clan engage in internal strife!

Yang Lin’s face was quite unsightly. He gazed at the old man in luxurious robes and replied, “Ying Nie, Yang Ye isn’t a member of my Yang Clan anymore. Right, I heard two members of the Ying Clan have died at his hands, but your Ying Clan hasn’t done anything about it. That isn’t like your Ying Clan!”

The old man called Ying Nie grunted coldly, “What? Your Yang Clan can’t deal with its own problems and needs my Ying Clan to clean up for you?”

Yang Lin spoke indifferently, “That’s my Yang Clan’s business. Your Ying Clan has no need to worry about it.”

Ying Nie laughed coldly, “I’m afraid that the Yang Clan will fail, and it’ll even get overturned by Yang Ye. If that really does happen, then I’ll definitely laugh my head off!”

Yang Lin spoke indifferently, “Don’t worry, your head will stay where it is.”

Yang Nie laughed coldly and didn’t say a word. Actually, the Ying Clan didn’t fear Yang Ye, and it was confident in its ability to kill Yang Ye. But the Ying Clan didn’t do so, and it had decided against doing so. It was because it wanted the Yang Clan and Yang Ye to engage in internal strife!

Actually, the relationship between the Yang Clan and Ying Clan wasn’t very good, and it was slightly related to Yang Ye as well. It was because Yang Ye’s father had killed the successor of the Ying Clan during his time.

At that time, Yang Ye’s father was famous throughout the medium universe, and even the Ying Clan and Ku Clan had to temporarily shrink back before him. They didn’t dare to go head-on against him! So, the Ying Clan had swallowed their grievances then, but it had never forgotten it. They felt that it was a humiliation for the Ying Clan!

So, it really hoped that problems would arise in the Yang Clan. That was why the Ying Clan hadn’t taken revenge after Yang Ye killed two members of the Ying Clan!

Meanwhile, the Wu Clan’s elder stepped forward, “There’s no need to argue on such meaningless things. I have something to discuss with all of you. That barrier before us remained so strong even after being corroded by countless years of time. So, it’s obvious how strong its original owner was.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “So, I think that we should go in there with those little fellows!”

“That would make it meaningless!” The elder from the Ku Clan spoke indifferently, “I agree that the owner of this abode was definitely not an ordinary person. However, why have we asked these little fellows to come here? It isn’t merely for the sake of fighting for treasures, it’s mostly for the sake of tempering them. If we go with them, how will they temper themselves?”

The elder from the Lu Clan nodded, “I agree. We brought them here to temper themselves and not to play. Moreover, we can’t avoid fighting if we go in there. I believe all of you don’t want that to happen, right?”

The others nodded to display their agreement. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The elder from the Wu Clan and the other elders nodded as well, and then they moved aside.

Meanwhile, Ying Nie glanced at the youths here, “Remember that your fate is your own responsibility in there. If you die in there, we won’t avenge you regardless of who killed you!”

It was an unspoken rule. Because if they took revenge, it was very likely to cause war between the clans, and no one could afford that.

The youths nodded. They didn’t say a word and just flashed into the abode.

After everyone entered the above, the elders of the eight clans hid themselves within space. Once they left, some people appeared in the surroundings, and those people swiftly entered the abode as well.

The eight of them didn’t stop those people.

It was an unspoken rule as well!

The eight clans didn’t try to keep everyone else out. After all, even if they were having the meat, they had to leave some soup for others. Otherwise, incurring public wrath wouldn’t be beneficial to them at all. Because those who were able to find out about the ancient ruin here were definitely not ordinary people!

Time trickled by. During this time, some people were ceaselessly sneaking into the abode, and the eight clans didn’t stop them.

Yang Ye had entered without a problem as well.

As soon as he entered the cave, the Divine Yin Flame’s voice resounded in his mind, “Kid, be careful. This place is slightly strange. No, it isn’t just slightly strange, it’s very strange!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
