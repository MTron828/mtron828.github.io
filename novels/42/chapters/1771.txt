Chapter 1772 – The Yang Clan’s Founding Ancestor!

Why don’t you give it a try?

His voice was very soft, but it carried an invisible deterrent force!

However, everyone here had abundant experience in life and battle, and there were so many of them. So, how could they possibly be scared by Yang Ye?

Suddenly, Ying Qing said, “Brother Lu, Brother Wang, Brother Li, and Brother Qin. All four of you come with me and kill this fellow. The rest of you head down immediately. Don’t let anyone on Heaven Void Continent survive!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he charged at Yang Ye.

At the same time, the other four patriarchs charged at Yang Ye as well while the remaining True Realm experts shot down towards Heaven Void Continent.

The war erupted!

Yang Ye glanced at the experts who were charging towards Heaven Void Continent. At this moment, he couldn’t stop them and could only keep the five patriarchs busy.

As for the others, he could only hope that Yang Lianshuang had a backup plan! However, he was very confident in her. She was a meticulous woman, so he felt that she’d definitely considered the possibility of such a situation. Thus, Yang Ye wasn’t that worried!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at Ying Qing who led the charge at him. He didn’t waste his breath at all and just swung his sword.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and Ying Qing was blasted backwards repeatedly. But it only took a moment for Lu Yuntian and the others to surround Yang Ye. A moment later, Yang Ye was pushed over 3km back!

Ying Qing glanced at his palm. It has been sliced into two. If he hadn’t retreated fast enough, his entire body may have been sliced into two!

Strong!

Extremely strong!

That was his evaluation of Yang Ye!

Ying Qing stood there in silence for a moment, and then he took a deep breath and charged at Yang Ye again. If Yang Ye remained alive, the Ying Clan’s future…. The Ying Clan may not have a future!

Besides the Li Clan’s patriarch, the other patriarchs were all at the 5th stage of the True Realm!

Even though Yang Ye was using the Wargod’s arm and the wooden sword, he still wasn’t able to gain the upper hand against them, and he even showed signs of being suppressed!

It was very normal because they were all experts who’d made a name for themselves a very long time ago. If Yang Ye didn’t have the wooden sword and Wargod’s arm, and if he hadn’t advanced to the True Realm, then he wouldn’t be able to fight their joint forces at all.

Even then, they couldn’t do anything to Yang Ye. At the very least, they couldn’t kill him in a short amount of time.

Because Yang Ye’s attacks were truly too terrifying. Not one of them dared to go head-on against his attacks!

That was the reason why such a situation had been created.

However, they had time to waste, but Yang Ye couldn’t.

He couldn’t endure the Wargod’s arm for too long!

Meanwhile, over 60 True Realm experts arrived before the formation around Heaven Void Continent. Even though the formation was strong, it couldn’t resist the joint forces of over 60 True Realm experts!

In less than ten breaths of time, the formation shattered beneath the power of their joint forces!𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Right when it shattered, countless rays of white light shot up into the air from within the city. These rays of white light instantly enveloped the True Realm experts in the sky!

However, it didn’t take long for all the rays of light to be obliterated.

All formations were useless before absolute strength.

“Summon our ancestor!” Suddenly, a voice resounded from within Phecda City.

It was Yang Lianshuang’s voice!

As soon as she gave the order, the space throughout the sky above Phecda City started to tremble lightly, and the frequency of trembling grew faster and faster. After that, a huge round platform made of energy appeared in the sky above Phecda City. At the same time, countless pillars of spirit energy shot up into the air and surged into the energy platform.

Waves of terrifying aura gradually started to seep out from the platform.

Ancestor summoning.

Everyone here stopped fighting, including Ying Qing and the others. All of them had quite solemn expressions on their faces as they gazed at the huge energy platform.

Summoning their founding ancestor could be considered the final trump card of every clan, and it was their strongest trump card!

The founding ancestor of every clan was an extraordinary genius, and it was naturally not that easy for such extraordinary geniuses to die. Or it should be said that most of them had surpassed the 6th stage of the True Realm and arrived at a higher realm of cultivation.

When they leave the medium universe, they usually leave behind a form of protection for their own clans. It may be their clone or a strand of their soul…

Even though it was just a strand of their soul or a clone, one couldn’t be careless when facing them. Because they were from existences who had surpassed the 6th stage of the True Realm. Moreover, they weren’t just existences who had surpassed the 6th stage of the True Realm. Every single one of them had been a monstrous genius, so their strengths couldn’t be judged by convention at all!

An ethereal figure gradually appeared on the platform.

An old man in red robes!

The old man’s hair was crimson red, and there was a strange red symbol between his brows.

The Yang Clan’s founding ancestor!

Once the red robed old man appeared there, everyone noticed that the space here started to tremble. It seemed like it was enduring some sort of terrifying force, and it was an extremely shocking sight!

Ying Qing and the others had solemn expressions on their faces when they witnessed this scene.

The old man glanced at the surroundings, and there was a trace of bewilderment in his eyes. But it only took a while for his gaze to gradually become clear. In the end, his face fell, “Who’s the current patriarch?!”

In just a moment, Yang Lianshuang was standing before the red robed old man. She bowed slightly to him and said, “Ancestor.” She spoke in a neither humble or proud manner.

The red robed old man’s face fell, “You’re my Yang Clan’s current patriarch?!”

Yang Lianshuang nodded, “Yes!”

The old man looked her in the eyes, “I said that no woman is to be the patriarch! Who let you take this position?!”

Yang Lianshuang spoke indifferently, “I did.”

The old man asked, “Who dared to allow it?”

Yang Lianshuang looked the red robed old man in the eyes, “Those who objected are dead.”

The red robed old man gazed at her for a long time. In the end, he spoke in a low voice, “You are an extraordinary genius.”

Yang Lianshuang glanced at the surroundings and said, “Ancestor, it’s meaningless to be conflicted about that right now. While the Yang Clan is in a hopeless situation right now, it won’t truly die while Yang Ye and I are still alive. There’ll be a day when it rises up again.”

The red robed old man frowned, “Yang Ye?”

Yang Lianshuang pointed at Yang Ye, “Him!”

The old man’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye, and then his frown deepened when he saw Yang Ye.

He stared at Yang Ye for a long time. In the end, he shook his head, “I see now….”

Yang Ye glanced at the old man, “What do you mean?”

The old man took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye but didn’t say a thing. He turned to look at Yang Lianshuang, “I knew that my Yang Clan would face tribulation because of a woman, so I left a rule that prohibited a woman from being the patriarch. But I never expected that tribulation to still arrive!”

As he spoke, he looked up at Ying Qing and the others, “Almost 70 True Realm experts! Such extravagance!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly stretched out his right hand and waved it.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

In an instant, ten True Realm experts were suddenly split into two!

The expressions of everyone here changed drastically, including Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang. Because even they hadn’t been able to see how those experts had been killed!

Meanwhile, the intent to retreat had arisen in the hearts of Ying Qing and the others!

Suddenly, the 6th stage True Realm expert from the Ying Clan, Ying Yu, appeared here. He gazed at the red robed old man and said, “He won’t be able to launch many more attacks.”

At the same time, the red robed old man waved his hand again.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The bodies of ten more True Realm experts were instantly split apart again! However, the old man’s body grew slightly more ethereal.

Ying Yu stared at the old man, “Go on!”

The old man nodded slightly, and he waved his right hand again. This wave caused the bodies of ten more True Realm experts by Ying Yu’s side to be instantly split apart.

At this moment, all the True Realm experts here felt fearful!

No, it should be called terror!

True terror!

The old man’s strength was too terrifying. It wasn’t something they could resist at all. At this moment, all of them had the desire to retreat!

Ying Yu said, “Can you attack again?”

It wasn’t that he didn’t want to stop the old man, it was that he couldn’t. Moreover, he couldn’t flee. Because fleeing would still equal death! Fortunately, he knew that the old man couldn’t attack many times as he’d been there when the Ku Clan’s ancestor was summoned all those years ago!

The Ku Clan’s ancestor had merely been able to attack three times.

After all, it wasn’t his real body!

The red robed old man didn’t launch another attack, and he just gazed at Yang Lianshuang, “Remember this! Descendants of the Yang Clan can die, but they can’t lose their backbone.”

Yang Lianshuang bowed respectfully to the old man, “Farewell, Ancestor.”

Ying Yu and the others heaved sighs of relief when they witnessed this scene. Because if the old man could still attack, then they would really have to flee. Fortunately, the old man couldn’t launch another attack!

The red robed old man’s body grew increasingly ethereal. Right when he was about to vanish completely, he suddenly gazed at Yang Ye. He didn’t say anything and just gazed at Yang Ye with a trace of bewilderment and disbelief in his eyes.
