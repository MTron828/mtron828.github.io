Chapter 1821 – Then Let’s Fight!

The gray robed middle aged man stared at Yang Ye. What could he say right now?

Nothing!

Because there was a sword against his forehead!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye looked up at the sky, “There was no enmity between me and the Night Assassins, and I don’t want any enmity to exist as well. Now, I’ll just ask you once. Can we let bygones be bygones?”

A moment of silence ensued, and then a voice came from high above, “No!”

Hiss!

At the same moment, Yang Ye’s wooden sword pierced through the middle aged man’s head.

Yang Ye pulled out his sword and looked up, “Then let’s fight!”

Yang Ye waved his right hand once he finished speaking.

Blood Maiden and the others understood his intentions and charged at Su Yuan’s group. But how could Su Yuan’s group be a match for them now?

It only took an instant for the other three black robed experts to be killed while Su Yuan and Ye Ning were completely suppressed. Based on the current situation, it would take 50 breaths at most for them to vanish from this world!

Suddenly, a strange vortex appeared in the sky, and then a powerful aura seeped out from it.

Yang Ye slowly clenched his right hand!

It was strong!

Very strong!

That expert hadn’t arrived yet, but he or she felt dangerous to Yang Ye, extremely dangerous!

That person’s strength wasn’t inferior to Ying Jing’s clone at all!

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden and Blind Maiden suddenly appeared by Yang Ye’s side, and there was an extremely solemn expression on their faces.

The aura in the sky was growing stronger and stronger. Suddenly, it stopped, and then Yang Ye and the others watched with bewilderment as it receded like a receding tide.

The sky returned to normal!

Blood Maiden frowned, “What’s going on?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t know!”

Suddenly, a hand appeared in the sky, and it flashed by. Su Yuan and Ye Ning, who were bitterly trying to survive, suddenly vanished on the spot.

They’d been saved!

Meanwhile, a voice came from the sky, “This isn’t over!”

The sky gradually returned to calm.

Yang Ye gazed at Yang Lianshuang, “What’s going on?”

Blood Maiden and the others gazed at her too because she could be considered the smartest amongst them!

Yang Lianshuang glanced up at the sky and spoke softly, “They’re very smart.”

Yang Ye asked, “What do you mean?”

Yang Lianshuang replied, “They came to kill us because they didn’t know about our strength. Yet now, they know how strong we are. Under such circumstances, trying to continue fighting us would only end in both sides suffering serious losses!”

She paused for a moment and continued, “We can’t afford to do that, and neither can they. So, they chose to retreat temporarily. That’s why I said they’re smart. Because they know that even if they don’t come looking for trouble with us, others will. At that time, they will be able to reap the rewards!”

Suddenly, Oblivion Maiden asked while holding the fox in her arms, “Why would others come looking for trouble with us?”

Everyone here gazed at her.

Oblivion Maiden gazed at them and asked, “What?”

The pig-riding young woman patted her on the shoulder, “Your level of intelligence has been exposed!”

Oblivion Maiden was at a loss for words.

Yang Lianshuang gazed at Yang Ye, “Your problems will never end while the wooden sword is with you!”

Endless problems!

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while and chuckled, “I’ve never been afraid of trouble.” He glanced at the others and continued, “But I’ve dragged all of you down with me!”

Blood Maiden shook her head slightly, “We needed your help, and there’s no need to say such things between us.”

Yang Ye acknowledged them, and they felt the same way about him. It could be said that his status in their hearts was very high.

Yang Ye’s heart felt warm when he heard her. He chuckled, “Alright, let’s not talk about that.”

He looked up at the sky. There was a thin barrier of light there, and it covered the entire city.

Yang Ye asked, “Can it be destroyed?”

Blood Maiden replied, “Yes, but it’s best not to use force!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Blood Maiden replied, “It’s too strong. It’s only in its defensive state now, but if we try to break through by force, then it’ll enter its offensive state. At that time, even though we wouldn’t have to fear its attacks, don’t forget that many others in the city want to kill us. Moreover, even if we break through it by force, it’ll consume a huge amount of our strength, and it’ll make the situation even more disadvantageous to us!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a few moments and replied, “Who activated the formation?”

Blood Maiden replied, “The City Governor’s Estate of Divine Ruin City!”

Yang Ye nodded and glanced at the surroundings, “Second Sister, Third Sister, help protect me while I prepare something. It won’t take too long!”

Blood Maiden glanced at him and nodded, “Alright!”

As soon as she finished speaking, all of them surrounded Yang Ye. At the same time, Boundary Maiden even created a barrier around Yang Ye, so outsiders couldn’t see him.

The experts in the surroundings became anxious upon witnessing this. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

They were naturally afraid that Yang Ye would run away.

Their strengths were utterly insufficient to rise to the large universe, and they only had a chance if they relied on the wooden sword. So, they would absolutely not five up on it. Especially those experts whose lifespans were almost over!

It may be their last chance!

Even though they were worried that Yang Ye would flee, none of them dared to attack. What a joke! They’d witnessed Blood Maiden and the others’ strength. Every single one of them was a monstrous genius. Moreover, even the Night Assassins had been repulsed, so how could they be a match for Blood Maiden and the others?

No one dared to attack!

Blood Maiden and the others paid no attention to the experts in the surroundings, and all of them were healing!

In the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye immediately went to the Ancient Spirit Python once he appeared in it.

At this moment, the Ancient Spirit Python was on the verge of death.

Snowy immediately flew over to Yang Ye’s shoulder when she saw him, and then she pointed at the python.

Yang Ye rubbed her head gently and walked over to the python, “Follow me or die!”

The python was quite strong, especially because it was a physical strength type. If it was willing to submit to him, then his strength would rise a level higher. At that time, he would definitely be able to crush 6th stage True Realm experts with just physical strength!

As for when he used the sword, his attacks would improve tremendously!

He knew the current situation well, so he had to stop at nothing to improve his strength!

The python glanced at Yang Ye and didn’t reply.

Yang Ye frowned at the sight of this.

Suddenly, Qiong Qi appeared before the python, and then they started to converse.

A short while passed before the python looked up at Yang Ye, remained silent for a moment, and then nodded.

Yang Ye gazed at Qiong Qi, and the latter explained, “Three years. Let it go after three years.”

Yang Ye nodded, “No problem!”

The python immediately transformed into a black shadow that vanished on the spot, and then a small tattoo appeared on Yang Ye’s right arm. It was the Ancient Spirit Python.

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi said, “Kid, that fellow isn’t ordinary in the large universe. If his main body was here, even my main body may not be able to defeat it in a competition of physical strength!

Yang Ye was quite surprised, “It’s that strong?”

Qiong Qi nodded, “Very! That fellow from before didn’t dare to make it use too much strength because he couldn’t endure it at all. As for you, you can. After all, your hand isn’t any ordinary hand. However, if it’s possible, it’s best if you use around 70% of its strength.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Qiong Qi explained, “Because if you use its full strength, your body will enter into a state of extreme exhaustion once its strength leaves you. At that time, anyone will be able to kill you.”

Qiong Qi paused for a moment and continued, “You must realize that both it and your arm don’t really belong to you. So, there’s a price to pay when using strength that surpasses the endurance of your body!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand.”

He turned around and intended to leave, but Snowy grabbed his arm and shot a pitiable gaze at him.

Yang Ye rubbed her head lightly, “You can’t go out and play right now. It’s very dangerous out there. I’ll take you outside once it isn’t dangerous, alright?”

Even though she wasn’t very willing, she still nodded.

Yang Ye gave her a light peck, and then he left the Primordial Pagoda with Qiong Qi.

Outside the Primordial pagoda.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and leaped up on Qiong Qi’s back. After that, he waved his right hand, “Come, let’s go to the City Governor’s Estate!”

Yang Ye’s group set off for the City Governor’s Estate.

They didn’t fly and just walked there!

Countless experts followed them from the shadows.

Yang Ye ignored all of those experts. So long as they didn’t attack, he wouldn’t create trouble for himself by looking for trouble with them.

Just like that, Yang Ye’s group arrived at the City Governor’s Estate.

Yang Ye gazed at it from afar, “City Governor of Divine Ruins City, let us leave the city, alright?”

A moment of silence ensued, and then a voice resounded, “Leave the sword behind and you can go, otherwise… Die!”

In an instant, the atmosphere here became tense.
