Chapter 1091 – White Deer Academy Splits Apart!

Su Shihe’s expression changed drastically when he witnessed this scene. He’d never imagined that Li Laoguai would actually act so shamelessly!

After all, Li Laoguai was a Quasi Emperor!

Su Shihe’s figure charged towards the arena. But there was someone who was even faster than him, and it was An Nanjing. An Nanjing had moved at the exact same moment that Li Laoguai had appeared within the battlefield.

After he killed Xu Fan, Yang Ye was about to leave the battlefield. But his expression suddenly changed. He’d never expected that someone would launch a surprise attack against him. So, he was caught off guard, and he had no choice but to turn around and swing his sword.

Hiss!

A ray of blood red sword energy shot forward, but it didn’t take long for it to be blasted into pieces by Li Laoguai’s attack. After that, Li Laoguai slammed his palm forward. This attack was beyond swift, and Yang Ye couldn’t dodge it at all. He was instantly struck by it.

Bang!

A mouthful of blood sprayed out from Yang Ye as his figure was blasted flying.

Li Laoguai was about to launch another attack, but a spear tore through the air while emanating golden light. A wisp of disdain curled up on the corners of Li Laoguai’s mouth, and he slapped his right palm towards it. The golden light was instantly dispersed while the spear was blasted back.

Li Laoguai’s figure flashed explosively towards Yang Ye who was still flying through the air.

Suddenly, Hao Tian appeared in front of Li Laoguai.

Hao Tian chuckled and said, “Li Laoguai, my hands are a little itchy, and I want to have a spar. Let’s do it.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he didn’t give Li Laoguai a chance to speak before slamming his fist forward.

Bang!

The entire pocket of space instantly collapsed before his fist.

A short while later, Yang Ye and An Nanjing appeared on the arena that had been blasted into powder. At this moment, Yang Ye had put Heaven’s Gravestone away, but there was an extremely obvious palm print on his chest. The palm print had caused Yang Ye’s chest to sink down, and his chest was severely warped at this moment. Moreover, countless cracks had spread out like a spiderweb throughout his upper body.

Hao Tian was standing in front of Yang Ye and An Nanjing, and Li Laoguai was standing in front of Hao Tian. At this moment, Li Laoguai’s face was extremely gloomy and slightly pale, and his right hand which he kept behind his back was trembling.

Li Laoguai spoke in a low voice, “Hao Tian, do you really intend to interfere in my Law Faction’s business?”

“I’m interfering in your Law Faction’s business?” Hao Tian was slightly stunned, and then he shook his head, “Li Laoguai, I have no interest in interfering in your Law Faction’s rubbish. Actually... my hands were just itchy, and I wanted to spar with someone. That’s all.”

He paused for a moment at this point, and then he continued, “But to be fair, Li Laoguai, you said it would be a fair fight, yet you actually interfered. Moreover, you bullied a Half-Saint as a Quasi Emperor. To be honest, if news of this were to spread, you, Li Laoguai, will be famous. Not only will you be famous, your Law Faction and those ancestors of your Law Faction will probably be famous as well.”

Li Laoguai gazed at Hao Tian for a long time. In the end, he said, “It was my Law Faction which invited your Martial Sect. Now, my Law Faction doesn’t welcome members of the Martial Sect here. Senior Hao Tian, you can leave now.”

“So it’s time to make me leave!” Hao Tian chuckled, “I would have left even if you didn’t say anything. It’s truly boring to watch some people shamelessly bully the young and weak.”

At this point, he disregarded Li Laoguai who had an unsightly expression on his face, and Hao Tian turned around to look at An Nanjing, “My good disciple, they don’t welcome our presence, so we have to leave.”

An Nanjing gazed at the palm print on Yang Ye’s chest for a long time. In the end, she took a deep breath, and then she turned around to gaze at Li Laoguai, “One day, I’ll definitely chop off your head with my own hands!”

Li Laoguai’s expression changed slightly. If an ordinary person had spoken these words, then he would have naturally treated it as nonsense. However, he had to take it seriously when it came from the owner of the Martial God Physique.

There was killing intent in his eyes.

Meanwhile, Hao Tian roared with laughter, “My disciple is joking, she’s just joking. Li Laoguai, just take it in one ear and let it out the other ear. You absolutely shouldn’t take it seriously, alright? Of course, if you insist on taking it seriously, then I’ll have no choice but to take it seriously as well.”

Li Laoguai took a deep and long glance at An Nanjing, and then he said, “Please take your leave!”

Hao Tian gazed at An Nanjing. An Nanjing gazed at Yang Ye instead and said, “I’ll work hard on becoming stronger!” She walked over to Hao Tian’s side once she finished speaking.

Hao Tian glanced at Yang Ye and said, “You have a good disposition. I hope my disciple won’t leave you far behind when we meet again!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Hao Tian waved his right hand, and then both Wu Yuan and An Nanjing instantly vanished on the spot with him.

Wu Yuan sent a voice transmission to Hao Tian over 100,000km away from White Deer Academy, “Martial Ancestral Uncle, since you’ve acknowledged him, then why didn’t you take him to the Martial Sect with us? That fellow is absolutely a genius as well!”

“Are you an idiot?” Hao Tian cursed, “Do you really think White Deer Academy would just let us bully them like that? We’re already offended the Law Faction by taking this little girl with us, and the Scholarly Faction is slightly displeased as well. But they didn’t want to fight me to the end. Especially the Scholarly Faction. This little girl possesses the Martial God Physique, so they are aware that the Martial Sect is the best for her, and they know that we’ll definitely not let the matter rest if they don’t let us take her. So, they chose to compromise and make us owe them a favor. However, if I were to be greedy and even intend to take that kid with me, then do you think they would allow it?”

Wu Yuan was at a loss for words.

Hao Tian continued, “If we force White Deer Academy into a corner, we’ll get none of them. Even though White Deer Academy is inferior to the past because it has split up internally, even those abnormally formidable powers like the Nether Pavilion and Evil Faction would have given them face during their prime. Their reserves are still there, otherwise someone would have attacked and swallowed their resources by now!”

Wu Yuan laughed bitterly and bowed to Hao Tian, “Thank you for the guidance!”

“Actually, that kid really isn’t bad.... What a pity.”

...

White Deer Academy.

Yang Ye stood up slowly after he consumed a violet crystal. Meanwhile, Li Laoguai’s gaze had descended onto him. Yang Ye gazed at Li Laoguai as well, and there was a wisp of ridicule on the corners of his mouth, “What? Are you going to tell me that there’s a 4th round? If there really is one, then I really have no choice but to say that I ‘admire’ you.”

Su Shihe stood in front of Yang Ye. At the same time, the experts of the Scholarly Sect had arrived in front of Yang Ye. At this moment, Yang Ye’s protection could be said to be their priority. Because Li Laoguai was acting completely shamelessly!

Yang Ye slowly clenched his right fist. That old fellow’s shamelessness had surpassed his imagination, so Yang Ye had to maintain high levels of vigilance against Li Laoguai.

Li Laoguai gazed at Yang Ye for a short while, and then he said, “Needless to say, you really aren’t bad. Unfortunately, Xu Fan and I failed to kill you repeatedly.”

Yang Ye chuckled and didn’t say anything. Because it was pointless to say anything now. However, he knew that the Law Faction would definitely not let the matter rest just like that. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Meanwhile, Han Yu suddenly stood up on the guest platform, and he said, “Everyone, the competition has come to an end, so it’s pointless for me to stay. Farewell!” Just like the Martial Sect, he wasn’t interested in the nonsense between the Scholarly Faction and Law Faction.

Lin Yueyin stood up as well, “Senior Li, Junior will be bidding her farewells as well!”

“Wait!” Right when they were about to leave, Li Laoguai suddenly spoke, “Everyone, please wait a moment.”

Han Yu turned around to gaze at Li Laoguai, and there was a trace of bewilderment in his eyes.

Li Laoguai said, “The reason my Law Faction invited all of you here today is because we want all of you to bear witness to something. So, please wait a moment.”

Han Yu pondered deeply for a short while, and then he nodded, “Since that’s the case, then I’ll wait a while longer!” He sat back down while he spoke because he wanted to see exactly what the Law Faction was up to.

When she saw Han Yu stay, Lin Yueyin hesitated for a moment before deciding to stay as well.

Li Laoguai nodded to Han Yu and the others, and then he turned around to gaze at Su Shihe, “Since the Law Faction and Scholarly Faction appeared in White Deer Academy, our White Deer Academy’s status in the Central Divine Prefecture suffered a terrible decline. Why? Because we aren’t united internally! That’s something your Scholarly Faction understands, and my Law Faction knows it well as well!”

Su Shihe’s face fell, “What are you trying to say?”

Li Laoguai replied, “What I’m trying to say is that if our factions are to continue fighting, then White Deer Academy will be destroyed by us, sooner or later. At that time, White Deer Academy will probably be unable to maintain its foothold in the Central Divine Prefecture, and only death will await both our factions.”

Su Shihe spoke solemnly, “My Scholarly Faction has been constantly exercising forbearance throughout these years. It was your Law Faction that kept reaching for more!”

Li Laoguai waves his hand in dismissal, “It’s pointless to discuss who’s right or wrong. All I want to say is that if we continue fighting, then it’ll only end in the destruction of both our factions.”

Su Shihe brows knit tightly together, “What exactly are you trying to say!”

Li Laoguai took a deep breath, and then he glanced at everyone here, “Since there’s little common ground for understanding between us, why should we stay together and form a sick ‘White Deer Academy’? My Law Faction has unanimously decided to split up from your Scholarly Faction. In the future, we’ll go our separate ways!”

As soon as Li Laoguai finished speaking, a few dozen beams of light shot into the sky from afar, and then a few dozen figures appeared behind Li Laoguai.

All of them were high-rank Saints!

Li Laoguai looked Su Shihe straight in the eyes, “We want to split up!”
