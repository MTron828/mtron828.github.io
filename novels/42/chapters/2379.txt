Chapter 2380 – No Limit!

“Haha!” The man on the chair suddenly started laughing, and his laughter reverberated through the world.

All living beings in the area retreated before it and gazed in the abyss’ direction with fear.

The sword cultivator’s face was calm, and there wasn’t even a slight fluctuation within his eyes.

After laughing for a while, the man on the chair suddenly said, “Unfortunately, my main body isn’t here. Otherwise, I’d like to see if I can make you swing a second time!”

The sword cultivator said, “I’ll go look for you!”

The man shook his head slightly, “That isn’t necessary. We’ll meet very soon.”

The sword cultivator glanced at him, nodded, and walked away.

Suddenly, the man said, “The limits of the Sword Dao. Needless to say, you’ve really surprised me. However, do you know what lies after that?”

The sword cultivator stopped but didn’t speak.

The man continued, “I hope you’ll be able to overcome your current shackles before we meet again. Because only then will I be a little interested in fighting you!”

The sword cultivator shook his head slightly, “Your limits are not my limits. My limits are no limits.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “Killing you will only take one swing.”

He vanished once he finished speaking.

Meanwhile, the man tapped the armrest of the chair and said, “No limits… Interesting.”

Suddenly, he looked to the side, “Hmm? Another extreme? Interesting, interesting indeed. Haha…”

…

Yang Ye and Nanli Meng arrived at a gorge. The gorge stretched far into the distance, and divine senses were frequently sweeping toward them from both sides of it. However, the owners of those divine senses seemed to fear something and didn’t charge at them.

Yang Ye and Nanli Meng encountered a corpse on the way, and Yang Ye saw a hole from a sword on its forehead!

They exchanged glances and continued forward.

Once they left the gorge, Yang Ye and Nanli Meng arrived at the grassland. They saw the ferocious demon beast as they passed through it. At this moment, it was on the verge of death.

Yang Ye glanced at its stomach, and then he looked off into the distance. Obviously, it was the sword cultivator who’d done that.

Nanli Meng suddenly said, “This demon is at the Two World Realm at the very least!”

Yang Ye glanced at it, and its eyes were closed tight. Obviously, it was waiting for death to arrive.

Suddenly, Snowy appeared here. She glanced at the demon, hesitated for a while, and then flew over to it. After that, she blew lightly, and countless strands of spirit energy enveloped it. Moreover, it even sent a lot of Primordial Violet Energy to it. Once Snowy’s spirit energy and Primordial Violet Energy surged into it, it opened its eyes slowly. Its gaze descended upon Snowy, and then it was stunned.

Obviously, it had sensed her aura.

Snowy patted it on the head, and then it gazed at Snowy for a long time before lowering its head slightly.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Nanli Meng’s eyes narrowed slightly from the sight of this.

She was very well aware of what lowering their heads meant in the world of demon beasts.

Submission!

Nanli Meng felt that it was quite absurd. A powerful demon had submitted just like that? However, when she thought of Snowy’s identity, she immediately came to an understanding.

Snow was a Sprite Progenitor!

A Sprite Progenitor!

Nanli Meng shook her head. Could any monstrous genius even compare to Snowy? The answer was no!

Yang Ye glanced at the ferocious demon beast, and then he asked inwardly, “Sword Scroll, is this demon safe?”

This demon was a Two World Realm expert at least, so if it attacked, it would be a serious issue for them.

A moment of silence ensued, and then Sword Scroll’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “A Primal Vicious Tiger. It’s very vicious, but since it was willing to submit to Snowy, then it represents that it won’t be a problem. In the world of great demons, once they lower their heads, they practically never go back on their word. Moreover, if it causes trouble in the Primordial Pagoda, it would be very easy to deal with it.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment, and he felt that it made sense. There was no one ordinary within the pagoda, especially those two sword formations that could be used now!

Just like that, another powerful demon took up residence within the Primordial Pagoda.

At the mountain range behind Void Mountain.

It was where Yang Ye had prepared for all these demons because they preferred to reside in the mountains. However, Yang Ye knew that they were very territorial, so regardless of whether it was Oxxy, the Primal True Dragon, or this new Primal Vicious Tiger, he’d given them clear territories, and prohibited them from act willfully. He didn’t want them to enter into battle. While Oxxy’s cultivation and strength were inferior to the Primal Vicious Tiger, if Oxxy had the Primordial Axe of Creation, it could still fight the Primal Vicious Tiger.

As for the Primal True Dragon, Yang Ye hadn’t discovered anything special about it. However, he knew that fellow should not be weak!

After all, it was a Primal True Dragon!

Outside the pagoda, Nanli Meng glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Congratulations, you've gained another powerful assistant! Now, I have to worry for those fellows in the outside world.”

A powerful demon!

According to her knowledge, Yang Ye had two demons already within his Primordial Pagoda. Besides the mysterious young girl, those demons were absolutely capable of crushing ordinary Limitbreaker Realm experts.

Practically all the experts who were managing those powers in the outside world were just ordinary Limitbreaker Realm experts. So, if they encountered Yang Ye, they would die before they even knew it. Especially when Yang Ye had so many treasures. For example, the Seal of Suppression and that mirror… Even she didn’t dare to say that she could deal with him.

They continued forward, and it didn’t take long for them to arrive at a cliff. They saw the chair below, and there was nothing on it.

They exchanged glances and were about to head down there, but Snowy suddenly pointed to the right. Obviously, she wanted Yang Ye to go that way.

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to go toward the right.

Nanli Meng glanced down at the chair from the cliff, and then she followed Yang Ye.

Actually, she wanted to go down and have a look, but she sensed danger, true danger!

Her intuition told her not to go down there!

She believed her intuition!

Snowy led them to the right, and it didn’t take long for them to arrive before an ocean of flowers.

It was unlike the other areas here. It was filled with spirit energy, extremely abundant spirit energy, and the spirit energy here was a little special. It was almost similar to Snowy’s spirit energy!

Snowy glanced at the surroundings, and then she sniffed. In an instant, countless strands of spirit energy surrounded her.

Suddenly, a woman in a white dress appeared in the ocean of flowers.

Yang Ye had met her in the past, it had been in the rear mountains of Eternal Village.

The Sprite Progenitor!

She turned around and waved at Snowy. The latter hesitated for a moment and gazed at Yang Ye. Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded.

Snowy cracked a smile at Yang Ye and flew over to her.

Snowy had slight bewilderment in her eyes as she gazed at the woman.

The woman rubbed Snowy’s head lightly, “I was worried, worried that this world would be without a Sprite Progenitor. Luckily, the heavens never go to such extremes.”

A ray of white light suddenly appeared in her grasp, and then a white key appeared around Snowy’s neck.

Snowy grabbed the white key in her paw and looked up at the woman with a questioning gaze in her eyes.

The woman grinned, “Sprite Hall’s key. From this moment onward, you’re the next master of Sprite Hall. Right, there are lots of treasures in there. All of them are yours now.”

Treasures!

Snowy’s eyes lit up when she heard that.

The woman shook her head and smiled, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “Since she’s a Sprite Progenitor, she has some responsibilities, and she must shoulder them.”

Yang Ye replied with a question, “Why should she?”

Responsibilities?

That had nothing to do with Snowy! He didn’t want Snowy to have some responsibilities for no reason!

“Why?” The woman walked over to him, “Because she’s the Sprite Progenitor.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “As far as I’m concerned, she’s not a Sprite Progenitor, she’s just Snowy.”

“How ignorant!” The woman closed her eyes slowly, “I feel a little regretful that I didn’t kill you that day. You’ll only bring harm to her!”

Snowy was immediately furious when she heard the woman, and then she flew over to Yang Ye’s shoulder and glared angrily at the woman.

The intimacy Snowy had displayed toward the woman had vanished completely!

“Senior!” Meanwhile, Nanli Meng spoke abruptly, “She is a Sprite Progenitor, but it doesn’t represent that she must shoulder any responsibilities. Or I should say that you should force your will onto her, right?”

The woman glanced at Nanli Meng and shook her head, “Do you know why Sprite Progenitors possess a special status?”

Nanli Meng shook her head.

She explained, “It’s because Sprite Progenitors can control spirit energy and summon the spirit of all things. Only by grasping all of that can she possess that special status, and only then will some people and powers fear her. Otherwise, even if she becomes a Sprite Progenitor, she still may be imprisoned and become someone or some power’s private property. This responsibility is mostly for her own protection.”

Nanli Meng fell silent.

Snowy didn’t have the ability to protect herself at all right now!

Meanwhile, the woman gazed at Yang Ye, “Her identity made her bound to be extraordinary. If she’s ordinary, only death awaits. Understand?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Her gaze descended onto Snowy again. She pointed at the key on Snowy’s neck, “If you go to Eternal Kingdom in the future, there’s a place called Myriad Mountains. An old man lives there, and you can go seek his help if you encounter trouble. He owes me a favor, so he can help you. Of course, the precondition is that he’s still alive.”

Her figure gradually turned ethereal once she finished speaking.

However, right when she was about to vanish completely, she suddenly looked to the right and frowned, “Leave! Right now!”
