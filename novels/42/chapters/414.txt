Chapter 415 – Shock!

It wasn’t An Biru who entertained Yang Ye, and it was a female manager of the Treasure Gathering Room called Dai Xiaoyue.

“The Madam asked Young Master Yang to please leave if there’s nothing that you need!” Dao Xiaoyue’s tone was extremely courteous. Even though she was asking him to leave, her gentle voice caused others to be unable to arouse even a trace of anger.

Dao Xiaoyue naturally didn’t dare to offend Yang Ye. After all, those two servant girls of An Biru’s had vanished because they offended Yang Ye. Even though her status and identity were much greater than the two of them, she didn’t want to give it a try. Only an idiot would create an enemy for themselves for no reason at all!

Yang Ye felt slightly disappointed when he heard this, and then he laughed with self-ridicule in his heart. Since An Biru had shown unwillingness to have any relationship with him any longer, then there was no need for him to continue pestering her and cause her to detest him!

So, once he thought up to here, Yang Ye nodded and said, “It’s fine if the Madam refuses to meet me. I have another matter that I need to attend to here. I intend to purchase some armor and weapons. I wonder if Manager Dai can conduct the transaction? If it’s impossible, then I’ll head to the Northern An Clan!”

Dao Xiaoyue pondered deeply for a moment before she said, “May I know what Young Master Yang intends to purchase. I can conduct the transaction if it’s a small amount! If it’s a large amount, then I can only ask for instructions from the Madam!”

Yang Ye said, “It’s a huge amount, and they can’t be lower in quality than mid-grade Earth Rank treasures.”

Dao Xiaoyue smiled bitterly and said, “Then I can only ask for instructions from the Madam. Young Master Yang, please wait a moment!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Dao Xiaoyue turned around and intended to leave. However, Yang Ye suddenly called out to her, so she turned around to look at him before she said, “Is there anything else you need, Young Master Yang?”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment before he shook his head in the end. He said, “It’s nothing!”

He’d originally intended to ask this woman to pass a message to An Biru on his behalf. But he decided against it after giving it a little more thought. After all, since she didn’t want to have anything to do with him, then pestering her would only make her detest him.

Dai Xiaoyue glanced at Yang Ye, nodded lightly, and then turned around and left.

Yang Ye remained silent in the hall. Truthfully speaking, he was very uncomfortable in his heart. He hadn’t hoped for much when he came here because he knew that her strength far surpassed his own, and so did her background. Regardless of which aspect it was, he was inferior to her in all of them. Moreover, he’d never thought about using her or using the power standing behind her for his own interests.

He’d merely come here to bid farewell to her. Because they might not be able to see each other again after he returned to the southern territory this time!~

After quite some time passed, there was still no sign of anyone. So, Yang Ye shook his head, stood up, and intended to leave. But right at this moment, a black clothed woman suddenly appeared in front of him.

The woman was completely enveloped by a black cloak and it concealed her appearance as well. If she hadn’t spoken just now, then it would probably be impossible to even differentiate if it were a man or woman beneath the cloak.

“You want to buy Dark Treasures?” The woman’s voice was very cold, and it made those who heard it feel like she’d disliked them for a very long time.

Yang Ye nodded and said, “I need a huge amount of them!”

“Do you have the finances?” said the woman.

“I wouldn’t have come if I didn’t!” said Yang Ye.

“I don’t believe you!”

Yang Ye shrugged and said, “Since it’s like that, then I’ll go to the Northern An Clan!”

The reason he wanted to do business with the Southern An Clan was none other than out of consideration for the help An Biru had given him in the past. But since they weren’t willing to do business with him, then he would naturally not beg to do business with someone who gave him the cold shoulder. He, Yang Ye, wasn’t one who brought contempt upon himself!

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to turn around and walk towards the exit. Right when he was about to step through the door, the black clothed woman had appeared in front of him again. She didn’t speak and just gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye knew that she was looking at him, and her gaze was very hostile because he was able to sense ill intent surging from her!

“If it wasn’t for her, I would have killed you a long time ago!” The black clothed woman spoke coldly while she slowly clenched her hand that was hidden within her black sleeve.

“You can kill me indeed!” Yang Ye didn’t talk back to her. He wanted to, but he, unfortunately, lacked the ability right now. He was truly helpless if the black clothed woman decided to kill him. Of course, it was an entirely different story if Elder Mu was by his side at all times. Otherwise, even the white dragon was unable to ward off an assassination from this woman!

Was it shameful for a Spirit Realm profounder like him to admit defeat to a Monarch Realm expert? As far as Yang Ye was concerned, it wasn’t shameful at all. If he were to talk back to her or speak arrogantly right now, then he could only be said to be brainless and purely looking for a beating!

The black clothed woman clenched her fist even more tightly when she heard Yang Ye, but she didn’t attack. Conversely, she relaxed her fist after clenching it even more tightly just now. She really did want to teach Yang Ye a lesson, and the reasons she’d spoken those words was so that Yang Ye would talk back to her, and then she would have an excuse to bash him up. Because only in that way would others be unable to say anything about her actions!

Unfortunately, Yang Ye didn’t give her that excuse, and he admitted defeat in such a natural manner. This caused her to feel rather depressed in her heart!

After a short while passed, the black clothed woman said, “Come with me!”

Yang Ye shrugged and followed her.

The black clothed woman brought Yang Ye into a spacious chamber. The chamber was extremely large. According to Yang Ye’s estimations, it could probably accommodate a few tens of thousands of people! There were many small rooms in the chamber, and the rooms were labeled with their contents.

Yang Ye was shocked in his heart when he saw the labels on those rooms. Yes, he was shocked by the An Clan’s wealth. Yang Ye swore that even the total wealth of all the six great powers in the southern territory couldn’t compare to the An Clan. Because merely rooms that stored Heaven Rank Dark Treasures, cultivation techniques, and combat techniques amounted to almost 100 rooms!

Besides that, there were countless rooms for Earth Rank treasures. As for treasures below the Earth Rank.... There were none because Yang Ye hadn’t noticed a single one after scanning the entire chamber!

What was it like to be filthy rich? This was it!

At this moment, if there wasn’t an extraordinary assassin standing by his side, even Yang Ye would be unable to restrain himself from plundering this place.

“These are all the An Clan’s treasures? Right, are all the best treasures here?” asked Yang Ye.

“The true treasures aren’t here. However, those aren’t treasures that you possess the ability to buy!” said the black clothed woman in an indifferent tone.

She was looking down on him! However, Yang Ye didn’t mind because he’d never thought about buying even better treasures. After all, it wasn’t realistic. Moreover, even if there were treasures that surpassed the Heaven Rank, he wouldn’t dare to give them to those assassins. After all, Dao Rank treasures would even arouse the greed of extraordinary experts.

“Go ahead and choose! I’ll give you as many as you want if you have the money!” said the woman in an indifferent tone. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment before he said, “I’d like to know if there are any suitable for assassins? I want everything suitable for assassins. You don’t have to worry about the money. I naturally have the ability to pay since I’ve dared to come here.”

The black clothed woman glanced at Yang Ye, and then she directly walked to the door of a room. A set of eight black colored Dark Treasured appeared in front of Yang Ye with a wave of her hand, and she said, “This is the Specter Set. It includes a cloak, a set of shoulder guards, a set of wrist guards, inner armor, and a pair of shoes. Every single one of them is a low-grade Heaven Rank Dark Treasure, and every single one of them is enhanced by an inscription from a Heaven Talisman Master. When the eight pieces are utilized as a set, it’s possible for the low-grade Heaven Rank movement technique, Dash, inscribed by the Heaven Talisman Master to be activated!”

“A low-grade Heaven Rank movement technique, Dash?” Yang Ye was tempted to buy it when he heard the black clothed woman’s description.

“It can double the user’s speed in an instant!” The black clothed woman spoke flatly. “Moreover, the Specter Set has the ability to conceal its wearer’s aura. It’s able to isolate its wearer’s aura without the wearer having to intentionally conceal his or her aura. In short, this Specter Set was made especially for assassins!”

“Alright! Give me 200 sets!” Yang Ye was very excited. If all 105 of them were to wear this set, then their strength will absolutely undergo a tremendous increase. Surmounting a realm of cultivation to kill an enemy wouldn’t be a dream for them any longer!

In his excitement, Yang Ye had failed to notice that the black clothed woman had clenched her right hand at this moment. 200 sets.... At this moment, the black clothed woman really wanted to kill someone. What did it mean to ask for 200 sets of the Specter Set? Every single piece of it was a low-grade Heaven Rank treasure, so 200 sets were equivalent to 1,600 low-grade Heaven Rank treasures!

1,600 low-grade Heaven Rank treasures! Does he think it’s made up of Yellow Rank treasures?

The black clothed woman waved her hand and sent those Dark Treasures back to the room, and then she turned around and walked towards the exit. She felt that she would be unable to restrain herself from killing him if she were to stay here longer. This fellow hasn’t come to buy things at all, he has just come to cause trouble!Because even a Ninth Rank Sect would probably be unable to purchase 1,600 low-grade Heaven Rank treasures with ease! But Yang Ye was all alone, and the information about him indicated that he was an extremely poor fellow. So, what would he use to pay for them?

The black clothed woman felt that Yang Ye couldn’t even afford a single low-grade Heaven Rank treasure, let alone 1,600 of them!

Right when the black clothed woman was about to walk past the door, Yang Ye’s voice suddenly resounded from behind her. “I wonder if this thing is worth a Specter Set!”

The black clothed woman’s figure stopped moving, and then she turned around. When she saw the object in Yang Ye’s hand, her figure had immediately vanished on the spot, and she’d appeared in front of him in the next moment!
