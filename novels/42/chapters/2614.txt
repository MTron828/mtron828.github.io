Chapter 2615 – Madman!

An Nanjing had quite the headache. How should she answer the question?

Actually, she noticed that many things in this world weren’t suited to Yang Lianshuang’s world. Similarly, some of that world’s rules weren’t suitable for this place.

However, Erya and Snowy were being absolutely shameless and had to be corrected!

Otherwise, she could only imagine the trouble they would get into!

However, An Nanjing didn’t answer Snowy because she’d decided to make Yang Ye teach them!

Yang Ye was absolutely responsible for the fact that they’d become so shameless!

Suddenly, the space in the surroundings shook, and then many obscure auras appeared.

An Nanjing frowned when she sensed this.

Erya glanced at the surroundings and gazed at Snowy, “They are definitely here for you!”

Snowy blinked and licked the cotton candy. It didn’t bother her, it really didn’t.

Erya asked, “Aren’t you afraid?”

Snowy shook her head. She pointed at Erya to display that she had Erya!

Erya rolled her eyes and spoke seriously, “Snowy, I think you should learn how to fight!”

Fight!

Snowy blinked and was quite interested!

An Nanjing shook her head, and she felt it was best to keep Snowy from learning how to fight!

Otherwise, she would grow even more lawless with Erya!

Their logic was something that most people couldn’t understand!

Meanwhile, a black robed figure appeared on the right, and the figure walked slowly in their direction.

An Nanjing gazed at the black figure in silence.

Erya glanced at the black figure and withdrew a fist-sized bottle. In the bottle was a fine straw! It was something she’d brought here from that world. It was sour and delicious!

Suddenly, she seemed to think of something and hurriedly passed a bottle to Snowy!

Snowy didn’t refuse… Just like that, they started drinking from the bottles!

Meanwhile, the black robed man suddenly said, “My Lord would like to invite you for a meeting. I wonder if you’ll give him this face?”

Suddenly, An Nanjing vanished on the spot.

The black robed man’s expression changed drastically, and he twisted his right hand slightly. In an instant, a black tornado surged forward!

However, a spear suddenly stabbed toward him!

The spear shot through!

The black tornado was instantly obliterated. At the same time, An Nanjing suddenly appeared behind him. Besides that, a spear was in his chest!

An instant kill!

The black robed man had no chance!

An Nanjing returned to where she’d been a moment ago. Meanwhile, Erya gave An Nanjing a thumbs up, “Big Sis An, you’re my idol!”

An Nanjing glanced at her, “You deal with the next one!”

Erya nodded, and then she looked to the left. A few black clothed figures had appeared there.

Most of them were at the Lord Realm!

Erya didn’t use her fists this time, she withdrew a blade!

A very long blade!

It was even taller than her!

It was something she’d brought over from that world. She’d fallen in love with it upon laying eyes on it in a weapons shop. Why? Because it was long and domineering!

An Nanjing shook her head, “It’s too weak!”

It was an extremely ordinary blade. It could be used in that world, but it was impossible to use in this one. Moreover, using it made Erya seem quite strange!

Erya glanced at the blade and put it away. It was too weak, and it couldn’t be used to strike anyone!

Once she put the blade away, she gazed at the group of black robed men. A moment later, she clenched her fists slowly, and then vanished on the spot.

Bang!

At the instant Erya vanished, the space in a huge area shook violently, and then the space in the surroundings cracked open!

Pure strength!

It was so powerful that even An Nanjing was visibly moved!

Erya’s strength was the strongest and most terrifying she’d ever seen!

Even Yang Ye who cultivated in the body couldn’t compete with her!

Rumble!

Explosions resounded incessantly as figures were blasted away!

Every figure was blasted over 1km away before exploding apart!

Completely exploding apart!

They were blasted apart by the force of her attacks!

It didn’t take long for the battle to stop!

Erya patted her hands together and returned to the others. She gazed at Snowy and said, “You’re up next!”

Snowy blinked, and then quietly enjoyed her cotton candy!

An Nanjing gazed at the two little gluttons with a grin on her face, and then she glanced at the surroundings and said, “Let’s go!”

Suddenly, she frowned again.

A mysterious barrier had suddenly appeared around her. This barrier had locked down the space in a huge area around them!

They refused to let An Nanjing’s group leave!

An Nanjing raised her right hand, and the spear returned to her grasp. A moment later, she hurled it forward!

Hiss!

The spear tore through the air, but it didn’t take long for it to be obstructed by a strand of mysterious energy!

Meanwhile, An Nanjing tapped the tip of her foot against the ground, and then she soared up into the sky. A moment later, she kicked the back of the spear.

Bam!

The spear shook violently and shot through the obstruction before it!

Bang!

Something seemed to shatter in the surroundings, and the world shook around them!

The barrier had been destroyed!

An Nanjing put her spear away and gazed at Erya and Snowy, “Let’s go!”

Erya hurriedly nodded and followed An Nanjing!

However, they were bound to be unable to leave smoothly today!

After all, there was a Sprite Progenitor here!

A Sprite Progenitor who was very likely to change the situation of some things!

An old man had appeared not too far away from them, an old man with white hair and a white beard. The old man wore a loose luxurious robe, and he looked very elegant and wealthy!

The old man glanced at An Nanjing before his gaze fell on Snowy!

Once he verified Snowy’s identity, he gazed at An Nanjing, “I want to invite all three of you to the Origin World. I wonder if you’ll accept my invitation?”

The Origin World!

That mysterious place couldn’t avoid being tempted by the Sprite Progenitor!

Actually, it was linked to Qi Bitian!

Because the commotion she caused had harmed the essence of the Origin World. The best way for the Origin World to heal quickly was to get the Sprite Progenitor and make her help them repair the place!

There was no other quicker way to achieve that!

Meanwhile, Erya suddenly said, “Old man, can we refuse?”

The old man shook his head, “I’m afraid not!”

Erya glanced at the old man and said, “Old man, you should move aside, or I’ll beat you to death.”

Snowy nodded on Erya’s shoulder. It was because Erya was very strong in battle.

The old man sized up Erya and was quite surprised, “You’re not human?”

Erya gazed at An Nanjing, “Big Sis An, am I not human?”

An Nanjing thought for a moment and replied, “I don’t think you are!”

Erya frowned slightly, “Then what am I?”

An Nanjing rolled her eyes, “How would I know?”

Erya thought for a moment and said, “I’m not a demon beast, am I? No, no! Demon beasts are quite ugly. I don’t want to be one.”

The old man spoke indifferently, “Have you finished thinking about it?”

An Nanjing suddenly vanished on the spot with her spear, and then a spear stabbed at the old man’s forehead.

However, it stopped around an inch away from the old man’s forehead.

The old man had suddenly grabbed An Nanjing’s spear, and his powerful strength rendered it impossible to move her spear even an inch further!

Meanwhile, the old man shook his head.

Bang!

An Nanjing was blasted backward with her spear!

A Destiny Realm expert!

The old man was no Lord Realm expert, he was a Destiny Realm expert!

Erya blinked and said, “Snowy, this old man is a little strong!”

Snowy was at a loss for what to say.

An Nanjing glanced at her spear. At this moment, there were many cracks on it!

The old man’s strength surpassed her expectations a little!

Meanwhile, the old man glanced at the surroundings, “Everyone, this Sprite Progenitor is extremely important to my Origin World. Don’t worry, we won’t keep it for ourselves. Once the Origin World is repaired, we will hand her over to you and let you do with her as you please. But for now, please give us face for a while.”

Obviously, the Origin World wasn’t the only power here!

The Origin World didn’t have to give face to some of them, but it had to give face to the desolate race and Eternal Kingdom.

At the very least, they had to show courtesy. Otherwise, he would never be able to take the Sprite Progenitor with him!

The surroundings remained very quiet, and he received no reply!

Meanwhile, the old man cupped his fist toward the surroundings, “Thank you.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he gazed at An Nanjing’s group. A moment later, he waved his right hand, and then a circle of blue light appeared out of thin air beneath An Nanjing and the others’ feet. They were about to resist it, but along with the arrival of three powerful auras, they were unable to move anymore!

Three Destiny Realm experts!

This time, in order to ensure the success of their efforts, the Origin World had sent three Destiny Realm experts!

The Sprite Progenitor was too important to them!

Just like that, An Nanjing and the others vanished with the old man’s group!

There was no room for them to resist before three Destiny Realm experts!

Just a few breaths of time after An Nanjing’s group vanished, a sword howl shot through the sky, and it descended at the peak of the mountain!

The light dispersed to reveal Yang Ye’s figure!

He glanced at the surroundings, and then his face turned cold!

An instant later, he hurled his sword to the right.

“AH!” A shrill cry resounded from afar, and then a bloody head fell from the sky!

But Yang Ye didn’t stop there. He charged up into the sky!

A short while later, shrill cries resounded incessantly!

Heads fell one after the other!

Finally, a furious shout resounded in the sky, “Madman Yang, what the heck is wrong with you?! It’s the Origin World which took them. If you have the ability, then go seek them out! What are you going mad here for?!”

Yang Ye stopped and glanced coldly in the direction of the voice, “How do I get to the Origin World?”

The voice replied coldly, “I don’t know!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he charged at the source of the voice!

“Y-You madman! You… W-We’ll send you there, alright?!”
