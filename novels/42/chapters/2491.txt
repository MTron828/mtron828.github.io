Chapter 2492 – War Dimension!

Yang Ye suddenly became agitated when he thought of that!

But it didn’t take long for him to suppress it.

He had important things to attend to, and he could only do “those things” once he was done with the important stuff!

Yang Ye went to the cultivation room, sat down cross-legged, and closed his eyes slowly.

Belief!

An Nanjing’s invincible spear attack carried her beliefs in the Martial Dao, and it could be explained as an imposing aura! An imposing aura that advanced courageously to kill any enemy with one strike!

It could also be described as confidence, powerful confidence, the confidence of being invincible!Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

An attack that would definitely kill!

An Nanjing’s imposing aura was something that few could resist!

What were his own beliefs and convictions?

Yang Ye was quite lost when he thought of this. Because he’d never considered this!

A long time passed. Yang Ye asked himself that question, and he realized that he aimed to protect!

Protect, and it could also be considered as his responsibility!

There were major responsibilities and minor ones. The responsibilities of ordinary people in the mortal world is to protect their spouse, children, and parents. Why did they work hard every day?

Actually, it was to protect their spouse, children, and parents.

A person would constantly force themselves to do better for their family!

As for Yang Ye, what he protected was actually no different than them.

He wanted to protect the people by his side!

In the cultivation room, Yang Ye just sat there silently all day and night. On the second day, he suddenly stood up, and then the Sword Domain covered the entire room. After that, the blood vessels beneath Yang Ye’s skin started trembling. A short while later, strands of powerful Bloodline Energy converged throughout him. At the same time, his madness intent surged out, but it didn’t take long for him to suppress it!

Pure Bloodline Energy!

Yang Ye looked forward with his sword in hand, and then he suddenly stabbed forward.

It wasn’t an attack for eternal life or the Grand Dao, it was to protect.

Belief!

Just like sword intent, it was an ethereal thing, but it did exist!

Over and over again!

Actually, if someone was watching Yang Ye, that person would think that Yang Ye’s attacks weren’t changing at all. However, Sword Scroll was able to sense that changes were occurring. They were internal changes!

Yang Ye’s strongest trump cards were the Sword Domain, flying swords, and his bloodline. Of course, this Belief Energy could be added to them now. It was Yang Ye’s determination to attack. Yang Ye’s attacks had always been decisive, ruthless, and without hesitation. But now that he’d added Belief Energy to it, they were faster and even more decisive, ruthless, and lacking in hesitation.

It was like how a person would stop hesitating once he or she was sure that it was the right thing to do.

Belief Energy allowed Yang Ye’s sword to become faster and more ruthless! That was the benefit of it!

The Sword Domain, flying swords, Bloodline Energy, and Belief Energy!

It could be said that defeating a Five World Realm expert wasn’t difficult for Yang Ye at all now!

Not to mention that he was still suppressing his cultivation. According to his estimations, if his body was strong enough, he could instantly attain the Four World Realm!

It was absolutely heaven-defying speed to most people, but it was just alright to him. After all, he possessed a pile of Divine Treasures and natural treasures.

It was like comparing a rich man’s son to an ordinary person. How difficult was it for an ordinary person to become a wealthy person without any help? However, if a rich man’s son were to start a business, then not to mention just becoming wealthy, that person could become filthy rich.

After all, the resources available to them were completely different!

Throughout the month, Yang Ye cultivated madly in the Sword Domain, flying sword, and his bloodline. Yang Ye wanted to bring everything he had to his own limits!

A month was like a year in the cultivation world!

Actually, Yang Ye had inspected the space within the Primordial Pagoda. It was different when compared to the space in the outside world. He couldn’t see through such a heaven defying thing, but he knew that the space here and the outside world were somehow linked, but they were different at the same time!

Yang Ye wasn’t able to fully comprehend the difference! But it was alright because the space here belonged to him!

A month passed in the blink of an eye.

Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda. As soon as he left his room, he met Mo Ya. Obviously, she’d been waiting for him.

She sized up Yang Ye and said, “Let me be frank. You may die. Even if you die, the sect won’t do anything for you. So, think about it before you agree!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Let’s go!”

He wanted to have a look at the War Dimension, the place Eternal Kingdom had made specially just to fight against the desolate race!

Mo Ya smiled, “Alright, let’s go to the teleportation platform then!”

She suddenly asked as they traveled, “Are you from the South Region’s Ye Clan?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “No!”

She glanced at him and didn’t say anything.

It didn’t take long for them to arrive at the teleportation platform. At this moment, there were around 10 people gathered here. All of them were Limitbreaker Realm experts. The strongest was at the Three World Realm, a robust man with a huge iron sword on his back!

Mo Ya led Yang Ye over to them, and she gazed at the robust man, “Allow me to introduce you. This is our Inner Court’s Head Disciple, Tie Yuan.”

The robust man sized up Yang Ye and shook his head, “You just attained the Limitbreaker Realm, so it’ll be too dangerous for you. You should head back and cultivate a few more years!”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s fine, I’m not afraid of death!”

Tie Yuan glanced at Yang Ye, “Alright, it’s your choice. Then let’s go!”

Suddenly, an old man appeared here. It was the Inner Court Elder, Elder Xu!

Elder Xu could be described as the top elder here in the inner court!

They bowed slightly to Elder Xu, and the latter nodded, “You’ll be representing my Ancient Sword Sect in the War Dimension, so remember not to engage in internal strife and allow others to laugh at us.”

He glanced at Yang Ye and another white robed man when he spoke.

Mo Ya spoke to Yang Ye via voice transmission, “That’s Lu Yunxian. He gained quite a bit of fame after becoming an inner court disciple, and I heard both of you… Anyway, be careful!”

Yang Ye glanced at the white robed man and moved his gaze away.

All he’d done was taken the man’s seat! Yang Ye felt that it shouldn’t be something which made the man treat him as an enemy!

Meanwhile, Elder Xu added, “This is an opportunity for all of you. As for the sect, the sect will benefit from your arrival in the War Dimension too. The higher-ups have promised to reward you generously if you’re able to enter the War Dimension.”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “What’s the reward?”

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye!

Elder Xu glanced at Yang Ye too, “Why ask about all of that? You’ll find out once you get in.”

Yang Ye felt quite helpless because the old man clearly didn’t like him much!

Elder Xu continued, “Our Ancient Sword Sect won’t be the only ones entering this time, the South Region’s Ye Clan, East Region’s Leng Clan, and East Region’s Yue Clan will be sending their forces too. Don’t bring shame to our sect once you get there. Understand?”

They nodded.

Elder Xu nodded, “Go on!”

Just like that, they entered the teleportation formation while Elder Xu watched.

Once they left, the outer court elder appeared beside Elder Xu.

Elder Xu asked, “Have you found out what I asked?”

Kong Ming shook his head, “As soon as I started inquiring about the Ye Clan, someone from their clan came to see me. In order to avoid unnecessary trouble, I didn’t continue my investigation. So, I cannot say for sure if he is an illegitimate child of a branch family in the Ye Clan! Perhaps only Elder Li knows his true identity. But Elder Li is dead. So, I think his identity is quite suspicious!”

Suspicious!

Elder Xu’s eyes narrowed slightly, “It is quite suspicious!”

Kong Ming spoke solemnly, “His strength isn’t sufficient to kill Elder Li. I’m afraid he’s backed by another power, and they are targeting our sect.”

Elder Xu fell silent for a long time and said, “He’s concealing everything very well. I’m afraid his objective isn’t merely the Ancient Sword Scroll and Heavenly Sword Scripture.”

Kong Ming asked, “Should we take action?”

Elder Xu shook his head, “Let’s wait and see. If he really has backing, we’ll be alarming them by acting now. If there’s no one backing him, then we’ve misunderstood, and it will cost us a genius. Geniuses are the most important in this world right now! Not to mention that he is concealing his strength very well. According to my estimations, he may have combat strength equivalent to the Three World Realm or even Four World Realm!”

Kong Ming’s pupils constricted abruptly, “That’s impossible, right?”

Elder Xu replied indifferently, “He wasn’t afraid of you at all. There’s only one explanation for that, he’s confident in his ability to defeat you. Besides that, I’ve asked the Primal Lionwolf, and it told me that he’s very dangerous, extremely even. He isn’t ordinary. Anyway, let’s leave him be and watch for now. If his presence will bring harm to our sect, then let me see how he will act against us; but if he won’t bring any harm to our Ancient Sword Sect, we naturally should foster him with everything we have so that he’ll become a central pillar of our sect!”

Kong Ming nodded because that was all they could do for now!

…

Two hours later, Yang Ye and the others left the teleportation passageway, and they appeared on the peak of a mountain.

Yang Ye asked, “This is the War Dimension?”

Mo Ya shook her head, “This is its entrance. We must wait here until people come to get us from the War Dimension. After that, we’ll find out what is required to get inside.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “What do you know about the desolate race?”

Mo Ya replied, “I know a little. I heard they were extremely formidable once. However, they are just losers who we’ve conquered before. I heard they are trying to make a comeback this time. Haha! They are just courting death!”

Yang Ye was stunned for quite a while before he asked, “The desolate race isn’t terrifying to you?”

Mo Ya replied with a question, “Do you think the desolate race is very terrifying? Of course, I can’t deny they definitely have some strength. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have dared to attack my Eternal Kingdom all those years ago. However, you should be aware of the outcome. The outcome was that they lost, right?”

Yang Ye thought for a long time and said, “Sure enough, history is written by the victor!”

Obviously, Eternal Kingdom had made the desolate race seem weaker when they were educating the future generations!

Besides a few people, the entire Eternal Kingdom probably felt that the desolate race wasn’t terrifying at all!
