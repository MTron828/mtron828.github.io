Chapter 1682 - Let Me Rest For A While!

Translator: InVader

Lend me your heads!

Yang Jian and the others’ expressions instantly became extremely unsightly when they heard Yang Ye.

Contempt!

It was an obvious display of contempt!

Yang Jian’s face fell. He gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he said, “I really didn’t expect your strength to have attained such a level.”

He’d witnessed Yang Ye’s strength that day. At that time, it was still extremely strenuous for Yang Ye to fight a Half-Step True Realm expert. Yet now, ordinary Half-Step True Realm experts wouldn’t be able to fight Yang Ye at all. Moreover, that was probably not Yang Ye’s true strength!

Yang Ye didn’t speak. He just raised his sword and started walking slowly towards Yang Jian’s group. He just walked like that without releasing his intent, and there wasn’t even the slightest fluctuation of profound energy coming from him. However, Yang Jian and the others felt an invisible wave of pressure, and its mental effects were especially significant.

It was pressure that struck the heart!

Yang Jian stared at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye grew closer and closer. When he arrived around 30m away from Yang Jian’s group, Yang Jian suddenly raised his right hand.

In an instant, 20 powerful auras shot up into the air, and then they formed an invisible mountain that slammed down in Yang Ye’s direction.

Besides those 20 auras that came from Zenith Realm experts, the aura of the old man by Yang Jian’s side had surged out as well. It was right in front of the mountain of aura, and it was the strongest!

The aura of a Half-Step True Realm expert!

When the aura arrived around 10m away from him, Yang Ye stopped, and then two intents surged out from within him!

Unyielding Slaughter Intent! Unyielding Sword Intent!

In just a short moment, Yang Ye’s intents had collided with their auras in midair!

Boom!

A loud explosion resounded, and the space here instantly started trembling violently. Just like that, Yang Ye’s intents and their auras entered into a stalemate.

Even though Yang Ye was all alone, his Unyielding Sword Intent and Unyielding Slaughter Intent weren’t at the slightest disadvantage when facing the auras of the 21 experts standing before him.

The space in the surroundings gradually started to tremble and seemed like the surface of a lake that had wind blowing atop it.

Time trickled by. Around 10 minutes later, the space in the surroundings started to ripple more and more violently…

Another 10 minutes passed, and the space in the surroundings was rippling violently like an earthquake was running through it! It was an extremely shocking sight!

At this moment, the space here was almost unable to endure the force of their collision.

Around 10 minutes later…

Crack!

A clear and loud crack resounded, and then the space in the surroundings started cracking open.

However, as soon as it cracked open, numerous strands of mysterious energy would instantly repair the cracks!

Yang Ye glanced up into the sky while a cold smile curled up on the corners of his mouth. It was obvious that they were afraid of allowing Yang Ye to shatter the space here!

Based on his current strength, so long as he could shatter the space in the surroundings, he wouldn’t even have to fear a True Realm expert once he took control of the energy within the black hole. As for these Zenith Realm experts, even if they were elites amongst elites, killing them would be like slaughtering helpless chickens once the space here was shattered!

Of course, even if the space here wasn’t shattered, he could still kill them with ease if they fought one on one!

“Kill!” Suddenly, Yang Jian’s voice resounded.

As soon as he gave the order, the Zenith Realm experts at the Half-Step True Realm expert behind him charged at Yang Ye. All 21 of them instantly arrived around Yang Ye, and then they formed a strange formation around him.

After that, a wave of invisible energy appeared here.

It was a formation!

Yang Ye glanced at the experts around him and tightened his grip on the ancient sheath in his left hand. A moment of silence ensued, and then he suddenly drew his sword and swung it at the Zenith Realm expert in front of him.

Om!

A sword howl resounded, and then a ray of sword energy flashed out from Yang Ye’s sword. The sword energy tore through the air and instantly arrived before the Zenith Realm expert who was closest to Yang Ye.

The powerful force within the sword energy caused the space in the surroundings to warp!

However, that Zenith Realm expert displayed no fear.

The sword energy arrived before him, and he immediately raised his spear and stabbed it forward.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye’s sword energy was blasted into bits. As for that Zenith Realm expert, he was pushed backwards repeatedly. However, he was merely pushed around 10m back before a large amount of the mysterious energy in the surroundings surged into him.

As the mysterious energy surged into him, he tapped his right foot against the ground, and his body instantly stopped on the spot. After that, he returned to where he’d been standing a few moments ago.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly because it was quite surprising!

It was utterly impossible for that Zenith Realm expert to be a match for him, and it was impossible for that Zenith Realm expert to go head-on against an attack from him. However, that expert hadn’t just accomplished that, he’d done so without suffering any injuries!

“Be careful!” Suddenly, Lu Lige said, “This formation should be your Yang Clan’s renowned ‘Spirit Union Formation’. Once it’s activated, the experts in the formation are like a single whole. In other words, when you face one of them, it’s like facing everyone in the formation. So, good luck!”

The Spirit Union Formation! Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. Sure enough, he noticed that they seemed like a single whole. Regardless of whether it was their movements or auras, they seemed to be merged together perfectly.

Suddenly, Yang Jian’s voice resounded, “Kill!”

The Zenith Realm expert closest to Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Yang Ye when he appeared again. After that, a spear carried a wave of powerful force as it stabbed forward in Yang Ye’s direction! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The spear was like a bolt of lightning and space trembled before it!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He didn’t dare act carelessly. His sword immediately shot forward while carrying Unyielding Sword Intent and Unyielding Slaughter Intent.

He hadn’t tried to use any techniques or tricks.

He intended to go head-on against it!

He liked to collide directly with his enemies!

The sword and spear collided in midair in the most direct manner.

Clang!

As soon as they collided, a sharp and ear piercing sound of metal colliding resounded. At the same time, an invisible wave of energy swept out from the point of collision.

Yang Ye and that Zenith Realm expert were the ones to bear the brunt of it, and they were pushed backwards repeatedly. As soon as Yang Ye stopped moving backwards, his expression changed because a Zenith Realm expert had suddenly appeared behind him, and then a spear stabbed towards him.

The powerful energy contained within the spear wasn’t any inferior to the previous attack!

A cold glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, and then he sheathed his sword before turning around and drawing it!

Om!

A sword howl resounded, and it caused the space around Yang Ye to tremble.

Clang!

As soon as they collided, both spear and sword shook violently, and then the Zenith Realm expert was pushed backwards repeatedly. As for Yang Ye, he was similarly pushed backwards by the force within the collision. However, he hadn’t even moved 10m back when another Zenith Realm expert appeared behind him. Just like before, a spear stabbed towards his back!

At this moment, Yang Ye’s expression finally changed!

Now, he’d finally realized how terrifying this formation was!

It contained the joint forces of 21 people. Even if such energy couldn’t compare to a True Realm expert, it was definitely not much weaker. Moreover, that wasn’t even the most important part. The most important part was that all 21 of them were equivalent to True Realm experts right now.

Because even if he fought off one of them, another would appear immediately, and that person’s strength would still be that strong!

In other words, unless he crushed all of them with a single blow, he would be exhausted to death!

However, how could he possibly accomplish that?

Yang Ye didn’t have the time to think. He immediately turned around and attacked.

Bang!

The spear and sword shook violently, and then both of them were pushed backwards again. But just like before, as soon as Yang Ye’s figure started moving backwards, another Zenith Realm expert appeared behind him!

Lu Lige’s face fell when he witnessed this.

If this continued, then Yang Ye would definitely be exhausted to death. However, he was utterly helpless. Because Yang Jian’s aura was locked onto him. So long as he made a move, Yang Jian would attack right away!

So, he couldn’t help Yang Ye at all!

Yang Ye was being completely suppressed. At this moment, he could only defend himself. Because he couldn’t attack at all. Every single time he faced one of the Zenith Realm experts around him, it was like facing the joint forces of 21 experts. So, he was unable to instantly kill any one of them.

Bang!

After pushing another Zenith Realm expert back, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he vanished on the spot. When his figure appeared again, he was behind the Zenith Realm expert who’d moved to attack him from behind.

The Laws of Darkness!

However, as soon as he appeared behind that Zenith Realm expert, a powerful aura swept out from that Zenith Realm expert!

Bang!

Yang Ye was instantly blasted away by the aura!

“The Laws of Darkness!” Meanwhile, Yang Jian spoke abruptly, “We’re very much afraid of your Laws of Darkness. So, how could we not take precautions against it?” He paused for a moment and continued, “Don’t you have another person to help you? Are you still not going to call for her? Right, don’t you have that diagram too? You can try it as well!”

Yang Ye glanced at Yang Jian, and then he withdrew his gaze. After that, he glanced at the Zenith Realm experts around him, fell silent for an instant, and then slowly closed his eyes.

The expressions of the Zenith Realm experts instantly became solemn.

Obviously, Yang Ye was about to use a powerful technique.

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Ye suddenly said, “It’s time to let all of you witness my true strength.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes, and then he vanished on the spot.

All of them seemed like they were facing a powerful enemy!

However, Yang Ye appeared behind Lu Lige, and then he glanced at them and said, “I’m tired. Let me rest for a while before we continue!”

All of them felt speechless.
