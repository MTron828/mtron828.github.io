Chapter 2608 – Return?

Close quartered combat!ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Yang Ye’s skill in close quartered combat was beyond terrifying now!

He hadn’t just improved his bloodline and cultivation there, he’d improved his reaction and attainments in the Sword Dao too.

From passively suffering a beating to slaughtering them instead, Yang Ye had almost lost his life during this process. While it had been a brutal process, the outcome was great!

In that state of madness, his reaction and every other aspect of him had been improved tremendously!

The Soul Exalt was a true peak Lord Realm expert, and it would be utterly impossible for him to easily annihilate such an expert from afar!

But he could accomplish it in close quartered combat!

After he slaughtered the Soul Exalt with a single attack, the other experts from the various powers fled.

Yang Ye didn’t just let them escape, and a ray of sword energy flashed through the sky.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Hissing resounded through the sky as numerous bloody heads descended from the sky!

A slaughter!

These human and demon experts couldn’t even fight back against Yang Ye, and their heads fell wherever his sword passed!

The experts from the Ancient Sword Sect and Blood Maiden’s group watched Yang Ye carry out the slaughter.

They felt like there was no need for them to help because Yang Ye could deal with it on his own!

It was indeed so. Yang Ye really could resolve it on his own.

It didn’t take long for the sky to calm down!

Dozens of heads were falling from the sky!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. The Soul Awl was gone. Obviously, the Soul Master had taken it.

Yang Ye glanced at the sky, looked down at Elder Xue’s group, and said, “Let’s head back to the sect.”

Head back to the sect!

At this moment, the blood of countless disciples surged!

They’d been driven out like dogs before this, and then they’d started to flee for their lives. It was definitely absolutely aggrieving to these disciples. Now, they could head home!

They could head home out in the open!

How could they not feel excited?

Just like that, Yang Ye led the remaining disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect back to the sect. Once they returned, Yang Ye didn’t order them to rebuild the sect. Because even if they did rebuild everything, those buildings could still be destroyed.

Thus, all the disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect just started living on the various mountains here.

In the beginning, Elder Xue and the others didn’t really support Yang Ye’s choice. However, he possessed absolute authority in the sect now. Moreover, as far as they were concerned, perhaps Yang Ye was doing this for a reason. So, they didn’t say anything.

In his abode, Yang Ye entered the Primordial Pagoda, and he stroked the Sword Precursor gently as he stood on the Ascension Platform.

At this moment, it had been joined back with the help of the Primordial Pagoda, but it was still covered in cracks, and the Sword Spirit had fallen into a deep slumber.

The Primordial Pagoda couldn’t do anything to fully restore the Sword Precursor. They had to wait for Snowy to return because only Snowy could help!

Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda. Meanwhile, Elder Xue and Sword Scroll appeared before him.

Yang Ye flicked the Super Divine Treasure, the Ancient Bell, over to them.

Yang Ye said, “It’s a defensive Super Divine Treasure that can cover a huge area of space. The smaller the area it covers, the stronger it will be.”

Sword Scroll spoke solemnly, “You should keep it!”

Elder Xue nodded and chimed in, “Your safety is of the utmost importance!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “It isn’t very useful in my hands. If it’s here, then unless a Destiny Realm expert attacks, experts below the Destiny Realm will be unable to harm all of you while you’re protected by the sect's various formations and this treasure. Of course, the exception to that is if they attack with a powerful Super Divine Treasure.”

Elder Xue wanted to say more, but Yang Ye smiled, “You don’t have to worry about me. Even if I have 10 Super Divine Treasures, those capable of killing me can still do so.”

She glanced at him and had quite a complicated expression on her face!

After making arrangements for some things, Yang Ye left his abode. Or it should be said that he snuck out of the sect. However, Blood Maiden suddenly appeared before him.

Yang Ye smiled, “Second Sister!”

She glanced at him and asked, “You’re going after them again?”

Yang Ye didn’t conceal his intentions and nodded, “I can’t just let them off like that!”

Blood Maiden replied solemnly, “It’s very dangerous. All of them have Destiny Realm experts. The only reason they haven’t sent their Destiny Realm experts is because they fear your backing. But anyone driven into a corner will throw all caution to the wind. If you drive them into a corner, and they really react like that, it will be a calamity for you and the Ancient Sword Sect. Indeed, you may be able to fight a Destiny Realm expert right now. But what about two? Three? Or five?”

She walked over to Yang Ye, “But besides you, who else in the sect is capable of fighting Destiny Realm experts?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Blood Maiden continued, “I understand that you have a bellyful of rage, but if you go to them now, you can’t do anything. Kill a few of them? That won’t make a difference. Based on the current situation, unless you kill all their Destiny Realm experts, you can’t resolve anything. You aren’t alone now. If you are alone, you can run after you kill a few people. But you aren’t, and you have all of these sword cultivators from the Ancient Sword Sect by your side.”

Yang Ye glanced at the sect below and said, “There are less than a thousand of them left. Too many have died.”

Blood Maiden stated, “And you may get them all killed!”

Yang Ye glanced at the sky, “I just want them to pay the price.”

Blood Maiden smiled, “So long as you remain alive, they will pay the price. If you don’t act now, they will be even more fearful. After all, they are afraid that you will attack. But if you attack, they may be relieved of their fear instead. If I’m not wrong, they’ve definitely prepared for the worst, and they may have even figured out how to deal with your backing. Or perhaps, they may choose to risk everything.”

She shook her head and smiled, “What about you? You can risk everything too. But what will you fight them with? Perhaps even Destiny Realm experts will find you difficult to kill now, but do you think those ancient clans and sects really are helpless against you? Not to mention any other power, let’s just speak about the Soul Sect’s master. How confident are you in being able to fight him?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Second Sister, are you trying to strike a blow to my confidence?”

She shook her head, “I want you to see the situation clearly. If you don’t act now, they’ll be more anxious than you. Moreover, if you don’t attack, they will absolutely not dare to attack you or the Ancient Sword Sect. Your goal now should be to grow stronger. You must be able to kill Destiny Realm experts!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he gazed at Blood Maiden, “Alright, I’ll do as you say.”

She nodded slightly, “I need your help with something else!”

Yang Ye was quite curious, “What is it?”

Blood Maiden spoke solemnly, “Eldest Sister has gone to a place known as the Void World. We haven’t received any news from her until now. I’ve gone to the Void World, but I failed to find her and almost died there.”

“The Void World?” Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What kind of place is that?”

Blood Maiden shook her head, “I’m not very sure either. Eldest Sister has that mysterious devouring ability, and the Void World may be of use to the advancement of her ability. Yet now, we haven’t received any news from her, so something may have happened to her.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Shall we go now?”

“We’re coming too!” Meanwhile, Nether Maiden and the others appeared behind Yang Ye.

Blood Maiden immediately shook her head, “You can’t!”

“Why?” The pig-riding woman frowned slightly, “Why can’t we go?”

Blood Maiden shook her head, “It’s too mysterious and dangerous. Even I almost died there. As for all of you…”

The pig-riding woman interrupted her with a displeased tone, “Are we very weak? I don’t care! I want to go, and so do the others!”

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden’s face turned icy cold.

All of them felt slightly afraid when they witnessed this, and they hurriedly gazed at Yang Ye. Yang Ye glanced at the pig-riding woman and said, “Just Second Sister and I will go there. D-Don’t glare at me. Just listen to me. We’re going there in search of Eldest Sister, not to fight. Moreover, the Ancient Sword Sect has very few experts, so I want all of you to stay here and help me take care of the sect. Don’t worry, we’ll definitely find Eldest Sister and bring her back. I guarantee it, alright?”

They were very strong, but Blood Maiden was even stronger. However, even she had almost died there, and it proved that the Void World was no ordinary place.

The pig-riding woman wanted to say more, but Nether Maiden suddenly said, “Alright, we’ll stay!”

The pig-riding woman gazed at Nether Maiden with bewilderment, and the latter spoke softly, “Second Sister, be careful.”

Blood Maiden nodded slightly, “All of you should be careful here too. While the Soul Sect and the others powers probably won’t attack the Ancient Sword Sect, I dare not guarantee that they won’t play any tricks.”

Nether Maiden nodded, “We’ll take care of ourselves.”

Blood Maiden gazed at Yang Ye, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye nodded, and they vanished on the spot.

The pig-riding woman spoke with displeasure, “They just think we’re weak. Anyway, how did that guy, Yang Ye, get so strong?! Did he take some kind of pills?!”

The others were stunned speechless.

…

A certain teleportation passageway.

Suddenly, a young woman, a young girl, and a little thing appeared within the passageway.

The young girl licked the tanghulu in her grasp, and then she passed it to the little fellow on her shoulder. The fluffy little fellow glanced at the tanghulu, took a lick, and then gazed at the rattle drum she was holding and shook it lightly.

Meanwhile, the young girl suddenly said, “Big Sis An, did we cause trouble for Big Sis Lianshuang?”

The young woman glanced at the young girl and remained silent.

The young girl felt slightly guilty and said, “We didn’t, right? I just went to borrow some money from that place they call a bank. Even though I did it a little violently, I really didn’t hit them. I’m not an unreasonable person!”

Snowy hurriedly nodded as she stood on Erya’s shoulder. They were very reasonable.

An Nanjing glanced at Erya, “You placed a blade that’s much larger than you against their necks. Right, it’s very reasonable! And you borrowed from them, so when do you plan to return it?”

“Return it?” Erya was stunned and asked, “It was my own skill that allowed me to borrow it from them, so why should I return it?”

An Nanjing was left speechless.
