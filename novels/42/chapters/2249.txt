Chapter 2250 – Just I Am Enough!

Yang Ye stood before Shao Siyou with his sword in hand, and blood was dripping from its blade.

The surroundings were deathly silent!

Shao Siyou stared at Yang Ye while the vitality within her was dispersing rapidly. It wasn’t just her vitality, spirit energy was surging out from her too.

She was dead!

A progenitor was dead!

Shao Siyou raised her right hand slowly and pointed a finger at Yang Ye, “W-What was that?”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, “The Sword Domain!”

“The Sword Domain…” Shao Siyou seemed like she’d lost her soul as she muttered those words, and then the color within her eyes vanished.

A short while later, everyone watched as her body suddenly cracked open.

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye at this point.

Fear!

At this moment, all the three other progenitors had undisguised fear in their eyes, deep fear.

Even Master Yuan’s eyes were filled with solemness.

Even he was terrified by Yang Ye’s attack!

Suddenly, Yang Ye gazed at Master Yuan, and the latter’s eyes narrowed slightly while he slowly clenched his fists.

However, Yang Ye didn’t attack. He glanced at the Weapon Progenitor’s group, and said, “I suddenly received information that the undying race is gathering death energy here to heal an expert of theirs, and I was told to come stop it. Right, I don’t know who sent this message to me.” He glanced at the Weapon Progenitor’s group again, and then continued, “I think that all of you didn’t betray the undying race, right? Haha!”

Yang Ye turned around and started walking away.

Meanwhile, the Weapon Progenitor suddenly gazed at Master Yuan, “That attack of his clearly surpassed his own strength, so he's definitely suffering from backlash right now. You’ll definitely be able to kill him if you attack now!”

Yang Ye stopped and nodded, “Yes, try me!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he started waving his right hand about, and rays of sword energy rippled out.

Master Yuan glanced at Yang Ye, pondered deeply for a moment, and then he gazed at the Weapon Progenitor, “You’re right. So, I’ll leave him to the three of you. Kill him!”

He was no fool, he naturally knew what the three of them were planning.

The Weapon Progenitor’s face fell when he heard this. He fell silent for an instant, and then he turned around and vanished into the depths of the endless black holes. As for the Devil Progenitor and Evil Progenitor, they vanished as well!

They’d fled!

They were very well aware that regardless of what happened to Yang Ye, the undying race wouldn’t let them go. So, they decisively chose to escape.

Yang Ye shrugged, and then he walked off into the distance. However, he seemed to have thought of something after taking just a few steps, and he waved his right hand. Shao Siyou’s corpse was instantly transported into the Primordial Pagoda.

Dugu Juetian wanted to say something, but Master Yuan shook his head slightly.

Just like that, the undying cavalry watched as Yang Ye vanished into the distance.

Dugu Juetian asked, “Why?”

Master Yuan shook his head slightly, “He is suffering from backlash, but do you really think we can kill him?”

Dugu Juetian was puzzled, “Why not?”

Master Yuan didn’t say anything, but a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth.

Dugu Juetian gazed at Master Yuan with astonishment, “Master Yuan, you…”

Master Yuan wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth while an unprecedentedly solemn expression appeared on his face, “That person standing behind him is really strong!”

Of course he wanted to kill Yang Ye! Or it should be said that he wanted to kill the Weapon Progenitor and the others as well. But he couldn’t. An expert had attacked him earlier, and that person’s strength was far beyond him.

At a point in the endless black holes, a young girl glanced coldly at the altar’s direction and left.

…

Yang Ye returned to Void Spirit Continent and entered the hall. As soon as he did that, he sat down there.

Backlash!

The Sword Domain!

He’d trained in it for over a month, and he had achieved quite a bit. Moreover, the backlash still existed. The main reason was his cultivation and strength. They weren’t able to endure the strength of the Sword Domain once it had been shrunk down.

The Sword Domain was so strong that even he couldn’t endure it!

However, it was much better now. At the very least, the pain wouldn’t make him lose consciousness anymore.

He hadn’t trained for nothing!

“You were a little impulsive!” Meanwhile, An Nanjing appeared by his side and spoke softly.

Yang Ye shook his head, “I didn't seek revenge from them in the past because I didn’t possess sufficient strength, and I would just be giving my life away if I went after them. Yet now, I have the strength to kill progenitors. If I still don’t go now, wouldn’t my dead brothers have died for nothing?”

An Nanjing fell silent.

Revenge!

Yang Ye would never forget that. Qing Chuan and the others had died in battle for him, and it was pain that would never leave his heart. But the culprits of it all, the five progenitors, still weren’t all dead. So, it definitely didn’t sit well with Yang Ye.

Yang Ye entered the Primordial Pagoda and brought Shao Siyou’s corpse over to the tombs he’d created for Qin Chuan and the others. He sat on the ground and gazed at them as he said, “Three more. None of them will escape.”

A long time passed before Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda.

In Void Spirit Hall, Yang Ye spoke softly, “Elder Yuan.”

It didn’t take long for Elder Yuan to arrive before him.

Yang Ye said, “Help me locate the other three progenitors. Use everything that we can use.”

Elder Yuan glanced at him and said, “Just I am enough! Give me a little time!”

He turned around and left.

The God Realm.

In the God Hall, Shi Tian gazed at the young man before him, “Yang Ye really killed a progenitor with a single attack?”

The young man nodded, “Without a doubt!”

Shi Tian closed his eyes slowly, “That kid is… truly monstrous!”

He’d killed a progenitor with a single attack!

Regardless of what the price Yang Ye had paid to accomplish that, it was sufficient to instill fear in anyone. Even he couldn’t kill a progenitor with a single attack! Simply speaking, besides those few peerless experts of the large universe, no one could stop Yang Ye anymore!

A long time passed before Shi Tian said, “What about those three progenitors?”

“They fled!” The young man spoke solemnly, “There’s no trace of them left.”

“How foolish!” Shi Tian spoke indifferently, “If they just stayed with the undying race, it would be difficult for Yang Ye to kill them. After all, the undying race wouldn’t just let Yang Ye kill them. However, they first chose to form irreconcilable enmity with Yang Ye, then they betrayed the undying race. Now, Yang Ye isn’t the only one who wishes to kill them, the undying race probably won’t let them live either. They’re dead!”

The young man said, “They probably never expected Yang Ye to be that strong. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have betrayed the undying race!”

Shi Tian nodded slightly, and then he closed his eyes slowly, “Have the strategist and the others done as I told?”

The young man spoke solemnly, “We have some ideas. But I’m afraid we won’t be able to move many.”

Shi Tian closed his eyes slowly, “Just around a hundred is enough.”

The young man asked, “Isn’t that too little?”

Shi Tian shook his head, “It’s too much. Our plans will fail if it draws attention. You can leave now. Watch the undying race and Void Spirit Continent’s movements at all times!”

The young man bowed respectfully to Shi Tian and left.

The hall fell silent once more.

…

Void Spirit Continent, in Void Spirit Hall.

With the help of his Primordial Violet Energy, Yang Ye’s injuries were almost completely healed. Once that was done, he immediately started cultivating madly again. Unfortunately, he couldn’t cultivate in the Primordial Pagoda.

Because he couldn’t endure the Sword Domain’s strength in there.

What surprised Yang Ye was An Nanjing instead. She was changing every single day. He didn’t know how to describe the changes, but in any case, he felt that she was very different every single day. According to his inference, it was probably because of the scroll Tian Xiu had given her! 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The inheritance of the void spirit race!

The entire void spirit race!

It was undoubtedly a huge fortuitous encounter for An Nanjing.

Just like that, three days passed in the blink of an eye.

One day, Elder Yuan walked into the hall, and Yang Ye opened his eyes.

Elder Yuan spoke softly, “I’ve found the Weapon Progenitor.”

Yang Ye asked, “Where?”

Elder Yuan spoke solemnly, “Where the Weapon Dimension used to be.”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “Wasn’t it destroyed?”

Elder Yuan nodded, “I’m puzzled by it too. However, according to my deductions, he should be there.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “I’ll go have a look. I’ll leave the affairs here to you!”

Elder Yuan asked, “Do you want me to come with you?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “It’s just three progenitors, I alone am enough.”

Once he finished speaking, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and so did An Nanjing.

The Weapon Dimension.

At this moment, it wasn’t the same Weapon Dimension that it had been. Only some ruined walls remained in space.

An old man was seated cross-legged there, and he was the Weapon Progenitor.

The Weapon Progenitor gazed at all of this in silence.

A long time passed before a ray of light flashed over, and then a young man appeared not too far away from the Weapon Progenitor.

It was Yang Ye.

Yang Ye stood there with his sword in hand and was about to attack, but the Weapon Progenitor suddenly said, “I’ve been waiting for you!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Waiting for me?”

The Weapon Progenitor nodded, and then he stood up slowly, “I’ve prepared a big gift for you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, two people appeared behind Yang Ye.

It was the Evil Progenitor and Devil Progenitor.

At the same time, a huge barrier of light appeared around them, and flying swords circled incessantly within it.

Yang Ye laughed coldly, “You’re using a sword formation against me?”
