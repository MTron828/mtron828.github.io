Chapter 1285 – I Did It Intentionally!

Qian Lankong stared at him without blinking as she awaited his answer.

Yang Ye spoke with surprise, “You came after me just to ask that?”

She replied, “Yes!”

Yang Ye suddenly spoke angrily, “Miss Qian, are you doubting my character? Am I a person who would take advantage of another’s misfortune? Am I such a....”

She interrupted him and said, “Yes!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Qian Lankong walked over to him. They were quite close now to the point they could smell each other’s breath. She looked him in the eyes and said, “Since you dare to look and touch, then why don’t you dare to admit it?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “It wouldn’t be easy for profound energy to enter your body while your clothes obstruct the flow. For the sake of speeding up the healing of your injuries, I....”

She asked, “But your profound energy can still enter my body even without removing my clothes, right?”

He gazed at her for a short while before he said, “Fine, I did it intentionally.” He really had done so intentionally, and the reason he did that wasn’t because he had perverted thoughts, and it was mainly because he wanted to prank her. After all, she’s been putting on airs earlier. So, while he was willing to waste his profound energy on healing her, he couldn’t give it to her that easily. That was the reason why all of that had happened.

After he finished speaking, Yang Ye became vigilant. Because she had a bad temper, so he couldn’t guarantee that she wouldn’t attack him after finding out that he’d done so on purpose.

Qian Lankong gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before she said, “At least you’re acting like a man now!”

Yang Ye was quite surprised when he noticed that she had no intention to attack him. However, he didn’t want to pay any further attention to the matter. So, he immediately said, “Miss Qian, I have many other things to deal with. Farewell.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around and walked away. But he’d only walked for a while when he stopped once more because Qian Lankong had followed him.

Yang Ye gazed at her and asked with a bewildered tone, “What?”

She replied, “I’m a very vengeful person. Those old bastards from the Veiled Region almost killed me, so how can I not avenge that? I’m willing to work together with you, but it’s only temporary. Once we deal with those old bastards, we’ll go our separate ways.”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he was overjoyed. After all, the Sword Alliance lacked help the most. Especially the help of experts at the Voider Realm. With Qian Lankong’s help, while the Sword Alliance’s overall strength would still be inferior to the Veiled Dimension, it would still shrink the gap between them.

Qian Lankong emphasized, “It’s only temporary!”

“Alright, it’s temporary!” Yang Ye smiled. He understood her character. She was headstrong and didn’t like losing face, so he naturally wouldn’t argue with her on such trivial matters.

Qian Lankong glanced at Yang Ye who had a smile covering his face and said, “We have to head to the Veiled Region!”

“Why?” Yang Ye was puzzled. After all, it had been quite difficult to trick those fellows to return to the Veiled Region, so wouldn’t he be walking into a trap by going there?

She said, “The Slayer Pavilion has 3 Voider Realm assassins, 131 Emperor Realm assassins, 327 Saint Realm assassins, and around 1,000 assassins still in training. Yet now, the master of Slayer Pavilion is dead, and I’m the only remaining Voider of the Slayer Pavilion. Do you understand what I mean?”

Yang Ye’s eyes lit up, and he spoke with slight excitement, “You’re saying that we can seize this opportunity to take control of the Slayer Pavilion?”

She nodded, “But I need you to cooperate with me!”

“Me?” Yang Ye asked, “How?”

She said, “Continue pretending to be the master of the Slayer Pavilion.”

“That will work?” Yang Ye frowned. The reason he’d been able to trick the others while pretending to be the master of Slayer Pavilion had mainly been because they very rarely came into contact with the Slayer Pavilion’s master. But if he were to pretend to be the Slayer Pavilion’s master in Slayer Pavilion itself, then it was very likely that he would be exposed.

“It will!” Qian Lankong continued, “The master rarely comes into contact with others. Moreover, even if he does, he still wears his mask. So, once you wear the mask and coupled with my acknowledgement, would anyone dare to not treat you as the Slayer Pavilion’s master?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded, “Alright, that’s completely possible!” His eyes were filled with excitement. After all, if he could gain control over an organization of assassins like the Slayer Pavilion, then the gap between the Sword Alliance and those powers of the Veiled Region would shrink once more. Moreover, it would shrink tremendously!

Qian Lankong said, “But you have to realize that if you head there, then you might not be able to leave if they join forces and close the barrier around the Veiled Region.”

Yang Ye asked, “It has a barrier?”

Qian Lankong nodded, “The continent once suffered a calamity. Divine flames descended from the heavens and ceaselessly destroyed the continent all day and night. For the sake of survival, many Voiders joined forces at that time to create a world, the Veiled Region. In order to keep the divine flames out, they joined forces and created a powerful sealing barrier over the entire Veiled Region. Recently, the barrier has been deactivated. But if they reseal the Veiled Region, then you’ll be absolutely incapable of leaving with just the strength you possess right now!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment, and then he said, “Let’s go to the Veiled Region!”

He didn’t want to give up on gaining control over the Slayer Pavilion!

Qian Lankong glanced at him and nodded, “Then let’s go now. Because they might have already acted against the Slayer Pavilion.”

Yang Ye replied, “Wait!”

“Hmm?”

“I need to refine puppets!” Yang Ye spoke solemnly. He had the corpses of 4 Voiders right now, and he naturally couldn’t waste them. After all, every single Voider Realm Sword Servant would shrink the gap between his Sword Alliance and the Veiled Region. If he was able to possess an almost similar number of Voiders as the Veiled Region, then the Sword Alliance would be entirely capable of going head-on against the forces of the Veiled Region!

Yang Ye didn’t waste a moment of time, and he immediately started to refine the Sword Servants. Yang Ye was quite nervous when refining a Voider’s corpse for the first time. After all, it wasn’t comparable to an Emperor. Fortunately, he was at the Quasi Emperor Realm right now, and his overall strength was numerous times greater than it had been!

The 1st attempt was a failure!

The 2nd attempt was still a failure!

The 3rd attempt failed as well!

The 5th attempt still failed!

Just like that, 2 days passed, yet Yang Ye still failed. However, he didn’t give up, and he just started once more from scratch.

After almost 9 days of failing, Yang Ye finally succeeded.

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and a smile appeared on his face as he gazed at the Voider Realm Sword Servant before him. Even though it was inferior to a true Voider, the gap wasn’t very large.

Qian Lankong spoke solemnly, “Your puppet refinement technique is extraordinary!”

Yang Ye smiled and said, “Actually, there are limitations. My current mental strength is only sufficient to control one more Voider Realm puppet, and my mind would collapse if I try to control more.” If he hadn’t advanced to the Quasi Emperor Realm, then not to mention a Voider Realm Sword Servant, he wouldn’t even be able to refine an Emperor Realm Sword Servant.

Qian Lankong said, “It’s still extremely extraordinary. A puppet at the Voider Realm.... No one has ever been able to possess a puppet comparable to a Voider.”

Yang Ye grinned and started to refine the 2nd Sword Servant. This time, he used a comparatively shorter amount of time. He used just 4 days to refine it successfully. Just as he’d expected, 2 Voider Realm Sword Servants was his limit, and his mind wouldn’t be able to endure another.

Yang Ye waved his right hand and put the Sword Servants away, and then he said, “Let’s go take a look at the Veiled Region.”

Actually, he was going there even if he didn’t have a chance to obtain the Slayer Pavilion. However, he wasn’t going there to look for trouble but to rescue Yun Banqing’s family.

“Let’s go!” As soon as Qian Lankong finished speaking, her figure shot off towards the distance.

Yang Ye immediately followed her.

Both of them were extremely swift, and it only took them a few hours to arrive at the extreme north of the continent.

Yang Ye looked up and an expanse of snow white filled his vision.

“Hide yourself!” Qian Lankong said, “They might have forces watching this place!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then his figure merged into space. Qian Lankong concealed herself as well.

Just like that, Yang Ye followed behind Qian Lankong and snuck ahead.

A short while passed before a crystal blue circle appeared within his field of vision.

Yang Ye asked, “That’s the teleportation formation to the Veiled Region?”

Qian Lankong replied, “Change into the Slayer Pavilion’s master’s clothes, and wear his mask as well. From this moment onward, you’re the master of the Slayer Pavilion. Understand?”

“Alright!” Yang Ye changed into the black robe and wore the mask, “Tell me some things about the Slayer Pavilion. Right, tell me what I have to pay attention to. It would be troublesome if I’m exposed.”

“Proud and cold!” Qian Lankong said, “Act proud and cold. Stop laughing and joking. Besides that, act in a dignified manner. But that shouldn’t be difficult for you. You’re the leader of an alliance, so you naturally have a dignified air. However, you have to emanate it intentionally. Understand?”

Yang Ye asked, “What else?”

She replied, “Besides that, you must remember not to utilize your sword or sword intent while acting as the Slayer Pavilion’s master. You can only use a dagger. Understand?”

“Of course!” replied Yang Ye. His strength would be reduced tremendously if he didn’t use his sword and sword intent, but it couldn’t be helped. His identity would be exposed if he used the sword.

“Hmm, that’s all. Let’s go!” As soon as she finished speaking, her figure entered the blue circle of light, and Yang Ye quickly followed her in. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Once he entered the circle of light, the scene around him instantly changed. At the same time, Yang Ye felt dizzy. But it didn’t take long for the dizziness to vanish.

Yang Ye opened his eyes. A blue sky and white clouds, it was a little different than the world in Dark Hell Continent. Especially the spirit energy here, it was very abundant and almost on par with the Radiant Dimension.

Meanwhile, Qian Lankong’s voice suddenly resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Shit! There’s an ambush here!”

Yang Ye scanned the surroundings, and then his expression instantly changed. Because the space around him had been sealed off.

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “We’ve been waiting a long time for both of you.”

As soon as the voice finished resounding through the air, 7 Voiders appeared around Yang Ye and Qian Lankong. At the same time, 7 terrifying auras pressed down upon them.

These 7 Voiders were Senior Yuan and the others.
