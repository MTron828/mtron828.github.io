Chapter 1354 – Treat Dark Hell Continent Well!

Who is this? Yang Ye’s face fell. That person’s strength was clearly extremely formidable, or it would have been impossible for him to blast both Qiong Qi and Blind Maiden away.

Moreover, that person was clearly on Jian Xu’s side.

Blind Maiden frowned as well. Obviously, she hadn’t expected another expert like this to be present in this world. There was a trace of seriousness in Qiong Qi’s eyes too. Because there was a deep mark on his claws.

Jian Xu’s eyes had a trace of bewilderment in them as well. He hadn’t expected an expert to suddenly appear before him and even help him!

The white light surrounding the figure gradually dispersed before their eyes, and it didn’t take long for a slightly ethereal middle aged man with a sword on his back to appear before them! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Jian Wuji!” Jian Xu’s eyes instantly opened wide when he saw the middle aged man.

Yang Ye’s eyes opened wide as well when he heard Jian Wuji!

Jian Wuji?

That middle aged man is Jian Wuji? What a joke! Isn’t he dead? Did he not die? That’s impossible....

A string of questions flashed through Yang Ye’s mind.

While Yang Ye was still puzzled, Blind Maiden suddenly spoke while standing at his side, “It’s a strand of the soul!”

A soul! Yang Ye was slightly stunned and turned around to look at Jian Wuji. Sure enough, Jian Wuji’s body was ethereal, and it really was the body of a soul. Yang Ye frowned. Why has he come here now? What does he want?

Blind Maiden didn’t attack as well, and she was just looking at Jian Wuji’s soul. However, Yang Ye noticed that her hands were clenched together tightly. Yang Ye knew that it didn’t matter if a strand of Jian Wuji’s soul was here, even if Jian Wuji was here in the flesh, she would probably not give up on killing Jian Xu. It was obvious how deep her hatred was based on how she’d been willing to say on the continent for thousands of years!

Jian Wuji nodded slightly to Yang Ye and the others, and then his gaze descended onto Yang Ye. Or to be more precise, it had descended onto Yang Ye’s forehead. Jian Wuji gazed at Yang Ye’s forehead for a short while before he shook his head slightly, “His consciousness has been eliminated. He still did that in the end.”

As he spoke, he sized up Yang Ye and said, “Not bad!”

Jian Xu had quite a complicated expression on his face when he heard Jian Wuji. Jian Wuji was a genius, and he had extremely high standards. So, ordinary people weren’t able to be acknowledged by him at all. No one throughout Sword God’s Palace had even received his praise, including Jian Xu himself!

Yet now, Jian Wuji had said that Yang Ye wasn’t bad. But it was normal because while Jian Xu was Yang Ye’s enemy, he really approved of Yang Ye’s natural talent and strength.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye asked, “Senior, didn’t you die?”

Jian Wuji shook his head slightly, “I wasn’t able to let go of some things, so I left a strand of my soul behind.”

Yang Ye glanced at Jian Xu and said, “This junior brother of yours destroyed Sword God’s Palace all those years ago. Senior, why didn’t you stop him?”

Jian Wuji replied, “I was in a deep sleep. My soul had no source of energy, so if I didn’t go to deep sleep and preserve my remaining energy, this strand of my soul would vanish once the energy within it dispersed. Just like this very moment, I’ll vanish completely in a moment. Because I haven’t just shown myself, I’ve even fought. Right, the reason I’m here is because your battle jolted me awake. Of course, I would be waking up soon even if all of you weren’t fighting here.”

Yang Ye glanced at Jian Wuji and asked, “What’s your goal?”

Jian Wuji smiled, and then he looked up into the sky, “After being corroded for thousands of years, that remaining energy that he unintentionally left behind should be extremely weak now.”

Yang Ye was visibly moved, “Senior, you left this strand of your soul behind to break open the restrictions above the continent?!”

Jian Wuji nodded, “It is no restriction. If he wanted to destroy Dark Hell Continent, he wouldn’t have had to go to such trouble. That’s just energy that was left behind during my battle with him. All those years ago, the grey energy was still very strong, and this strand of my soul wasn’t strong enough to break it open. Yet now, it should be possible.”

Yang Ye gazed at Jian Wuji for a long time before he asked, “Was it worth it?”

Needless to say, Yang Ye felt quite a bit of admiration towards Jian Wuji. Jian Wuji hadn’t just sacrificed himself for the continent all those years ago, he’d even left a strand of his soul behind to wait thousands of years to destroy the restrictions over the continent. In any case, if he was in Jian Wuji’s position, he would definitely not do that. He, Yang Ye, was a selfish person, and it was something even he admitted!

As far as he was concerned, the most important were his loved ones and friends, and he placed them first at all times!

As for a selfless person like Jian Wuji.... Even though he couldn’t be like Jian Wuji, he admired such a person! Because he could sense that Jian Wuji was sincerely thinking for the sake of Dark Hell Continent, and there were no selfish interests behind it!

Jian Wuji chuckled, “This is the place that gave birth to me and nurtured me. Moreover, there are billions of living beings here. How could I just abandon it? I could if I didn’t have the ability, but I just happened to have some ability. Since I did, then not taking action would go against my heart and my convictions towards the Sword Dao. You’re a sword cultivator, so you should understand me, right?”

Yang Ye nodded. He naturally did. Every single sword cultivator had a different conviction. His was selfish. He would only act when it was beneficial to him, and he wouldn’t even care if it was right or wrong. This was naturally beneficial, and the benefit was being unrestrained. As for Jian Wuji....

To put it in a more direct manner, Yang Ye was a bad person while Jian Wuji was a good person. The bad usually lived longer because the bad would only do things that are beneficial to them. As for the good, the good usually had to do some things that weren’t good for them yet were good for others. Jian Wuji was a person like that. He’d sacrificed himself for the sake of others.

So, while Yang Ye refused to do that, he still respected such individuals.

Jian Wuji nodded slightly, and then he turned to look at Jian Xu. As he gazed at Jian Xu, a trace of complicated emotions appeared in his eyes, “I knew that you would be angry that I didn’t allow you to take control of the Sword God’s Palace and the Stellar Sword Diagram, but I never expected you to destroy Sword God’s Palace because of that.”

Jian Xu spoke with a slightly fierce expression, “Aren’t you the one who forced my hand?”

Jian Wuji shook his head and said, “Do you know why I didn’t allow it?”

Jian Xu spoke angrily, “I really want to know the answer as well!”

Jian Wuji replied, “Your natural talent isn’t bad. All those years ago, it was the best in Sword God’s Palace besides me. However, your heart is always distracted, and you always wanted to take shortcuts. Yet you didn’t realize that there are no shortcuts on the path of the sword. I didn’t want you to take control of Sword God’s Palace because I hoped that you would concentrate on cultivating the sword and avoid getting your heart clouded by authority. As for the Stellar Sword Diagram, it was because I didn’t want you to take a shortcut. Because you wanted the Stellar Sword Diagram to use it as a shortcut to comprehend the Sword Domain, right?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Jian Wuji shook his head, “You knew that the Stellar Sword Diagram requires the Sword Domain in order to be utilized. I know that if you obtained it, you would definitely concentrate all your attention onto studying it. If that really happened, you’ll always be living beneath my shadow and would never be able to advance a step further.”

“You’re lying!” Jian Xu suddenly howled with fury, “You didn’t let me have them because you didn’t want to let me surpass you. That’s the true reason!”

Jian Xu glanced at Jian Xu who seemed to have gone slightly mad, and then he said, “You know very well that I’ve never been fond of lying. I only speak what I think. Moreover, there’s no need for me to lie to you.”

“He isn’t lying!” Meanwhile, Blind Maiden suddenly said, “All those years ago, you merely possessed peak Rebirth Rank sword intent. Yet now, you’re attained the Quasi Returnal Rank. Do you know why? Because you temporarily gave up on the Stellar Sword Diagram and the Sword God’s Palace. If I’m not wrong, you’ve definitely placed all your attention on the Sword Dao, right?”

Jian Xu’s face was pale while a lost expression filled his eyes.

A short moment of silence later, Jian Wuji turned to look at Blind Maiden, “Can you spare him?”

She shook her head in response, “He has to die, even if you were here in the flesh.”

Jian Xu gazed at her for a long time. He was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly spoke with surprise, “He....”

Jian Wuji turned around and saw faint flames coming from Jian Xu.

Soul ignition!

Jian Xu had ignited his soul!

Does he intend to improve his strength from igniting his soul? Such a thought had appeared in Yang Ye’s mind, but it didn’t take long for him to reject the possibility. Because Jian Xu’s aura hadn’t risen explosively at all, and it was Jian Xu’s vitality that was being lost incessantly.

Jian Wuji asked, “Why?”

Jian Xu remained silent. His body was gradually growing translucent, and it was becoming even more translucent than Jian Wuji. Right when Jian Xu was about to vanish completely, he suddenly looked up and gazed at Jian Wuji, “Senior Brother, I’m sorry....”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure vanished on the spot.

Jian Wuji closed his eyes slowly. He remained silent for a long while before opening his eyes, and then he looked up at the sky, “There are many things and people in this world that we’ll only cherish once we lose them. Yet we never realize that it’s too late to only cherish them then. Young one, cherish those around you.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Jian Wuji slowly walked up into the sky.

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi gazed at Jian Wuji and said, “That fellow isn’t bad.”

Blind Maiden spoke as well, “An outstanding individual!”

Yang Ye nodded and looked up at the sky. At this moment, Jian Wuji was growing faster and faster, and it didn’t take long for Jian Wuji’s figure to transform into a ray of light that vanished from their fields of vision.

“Treat Dark Hell Continent well!” Jian Wuji’s voice resounded from high above. At this moment, everyone throughout the continent could hear his voice.

After that....

Bang!

The sky shook violently, and a loud explosion resounded throughout the entire continent.

It didn’t take long for a starry sky to appear within their vision....

The restriction was gone!
