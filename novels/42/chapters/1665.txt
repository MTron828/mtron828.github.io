Chapter 1666 - Little Sky Awakens!

Translator: InVader

Snowy grew sadder as she cried, and spirit energy surged out from her eyes like torrents.

In just a short while, an area of almost 1km was covered in white mist.

Yang Ye patted her head gently and spoke softly, “Little Fellow, what’s wrong?”

Snowy looked up at Yang Ye, and then buried her head in his chest and continued crying.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye was finally able to console Snowy to the point that she calmed down. After he talked with her, he finally understood why she was crying.

She was happy!

She was too happy when she saw Little Sky wake up. So, she couldn’t control her emotions and started crying.

Yang Ye didn’t know whether to laugh or cry when he found out.

Even though Little Sky had woken up, she was still extremely weak. Because the injuries she’d suffered were truly too severe. So, she had to recuperate. However, she had the Soul Nurturing Tree, so her recovery was extremely swift. Based on her estimations, it would take just a few months for her to fully recover.

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Little Sky, will the Soul Nurturing Tree be effective in helping Xiao Qi?”

Little Sky flashed up the Soul Nurturing Tree and sat on it. She thought for a moment and replied, “It should work, but her soul is quite unique, so its effects won’t be very good.”

Yang Ye’s face fell when he heard this. Meanwhile, Little Sky added, “But it’s fine. Based on my estimates, it’ll take two or three months at most for her to wake up.”

Two or three months!

Yang Ye visibly relaxed when he heard this. Xiao Qi had been sleeping for so long, so it was time for her to wake up. He’d promised the old man in a Daoist’s robe that he would send her back home, and he’d never forgotten that promise.

After he’d resolved his business in the Yang Clan, he planned to send her home!

After playing with Snowy and Little Sky for a while, Yang Ye returned to the cultivation room on the 3rd level. At this moment, only An Nanjing and Xiao Yuxi were here.

Xiao Yuxi was meditating and cultivating. She was charging into the Rebirth Realm because Yang Ye had given her a Rebirth Fruit!

Xiao Yuxi’s natural talent was extremely good, so the Rebirth Realm wasn’t difficult for her at all.

As for An Nanjing who was seated cross-legged on the other side, she had an old book in her hand, and it was the compilation of the experiences of Wu Mu, the Wu Clan’s ancestor.

An Nanjing closed the book when she saw Yang Ye walk in, and then she gazed at him.

Yang Ye walked over to her, and then gazed at the book, “Can I take a look?”

She nodded slightly and passed it to him. Yang Ye took it, glanced at it, and then a solemn expression appeared on his face.

The book didn’t just record numerous methods of cultivation, there were comprehensions from cultivating. Besides that, every single comprehension had numerous annotations. The comprehensions weren’t the only ones that had annotations, even every single realm of cultivation was explained in detail and had a detailed list of points to pay attention to!

It was like a textbook for cultivation!

Yang Ye looked through it for a long time before he said, “It’s very useful!”

An Nanjing nodded slightly, “I learn new things from it every day.”

Yang Ye smiled, and then he passed the book back to her, “Let’s train once I’ve improved my body’s cultivation.”

She nodded slightly, “Alright!”

She gained a lot from sparring with Yang Ye. Because up until now, Yang Ye was the only one in the younger generation who could fight her in close quarters.

Yang Ye smiled, “Then it’s decided.”

As he spoke, he sat down cross-legged on the ground and withdrew the Hell Fruit. Yang Ye’s face gradually became solemn as he gazed at the Hell Fruit in front of him. Because he sensed a slightly horrifying strand of energy within it!

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time before swallowing it.

As soon as it entered his body, it transformed into a wave of dark red energy that started spreading throughout him. In next to no time, the dark red energy had arrived at every corner of his body. At this moment, his internal organs, meridians, bones, and blood were completely enveloped within the dark red energy.

It hurt!

The pain was overwhelming!

When the dark red energy started spreading throughout his body, he felt like flames were blazing through his body. No, it was even more terrifying than just flames. At that moment, even he had almost let out a shrill cry!

Fortunately, he’d endured it!

An Nanjing was right beside him, so he had to act like a man!

Yang Ye’s face gradually started to warp. In the end, his entire face was completely warped. At the same time, his clothes suddenly transformed into ashes.

After that, slight flames appeared from all over his skin.

Crackle! Crackle!

Once the flames appeared on his skin, crackling like fireworks resounded throughout him.

An Nanjing walked over to Yang Ye, and there was a wisp of worry in her eyes as she gazed at him.

Because Yang Ye seemed to be on the verge of exploding apart!

At this moment, Yang Ye was clearly suffering. This suffering wasn’t just from his body, it came from his mind and soul too. The Hell Fruit didn’t just work on the body, it worked on his soul and mind.

The difference between the physical pain he suffered and the pain that he suffered from his mind and soul was like the gap between the heavens and the earth. Especially the pain coming from his soul, it was absolutely overwhelming!

Fortunately, he was able to endure it.

Just like that, time trickled by, and Yang Ye was gradually able to get used to the pain. His face slowly returned to calm, but the flames on his body hadn’t vanished.

His body was slowly undergoing a transformation as the flames burned him.

Two days passed like this before the flames on Yang Ye’s body gradually vanished, and his face was completely calm.

One more day later, the flames on him had vanished completely, and then he slowly opened his eyes. After that, he stood up slowly and looked down at his body. At this moment, his body had turned slightly copper.

He clenched his right fist slowly. At the moment it was fully clenched, the veins throughout his arm bulged up, and they were like numerous tiny and ferocious serpents.

The Zenith Realm!

After absorbing the energy within the Hell Fruit, Yang Ye’s body had finally attained the Zenith Realm!

Even though his body was still unable to resist the attacks of True Realm experts, True Realm experts couldn’t annihilate him in an instant. In the past, his body had been utterly unable to go head-on against the attacks of True Realm experts. While he still couldn’t accomplish that, Half-Step True Realm and Zenith Realm experts would find it difficult to harm him.

After all, besides a body at the Zenith Realm, he had the Demon God’s energy. Even though the Demon God’s energy was just like the Sword God’s Seal, and it wasn’t very helpful to him anymore, it could still help. The Demon God’s energy was still helpful, but the Sword God’s Seal wasn’t very useful.

Because it wasn’t able to forcefully bring his sword intent to a higher level. At the very most, it could strengthen his sword intent slightly, and such an increase in strength was insignificant to him.

Besides the Demon God’s energy, the most important reason was the Primordial Violet Energy he possessed. Unless his opponent could kill him with a single attack or heavily injure him with one attack, he could recover in a very short amount of time. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The Zenith Realm in body cultivation!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and gazed at An Nanjing. Meanwhile, An Nanjing turned slightly to the side and said, “Get dressed!”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then slight embarrassment covered his face. Because of the tiny flames throughout his skin, his clothes had been burnt to ashes. In other words, he was completely nude!

Yang Ye smiled with embarrassment, and then he quickly withdrew a green robe and wore it.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing gazed at him, “Your body is at the Zenith Realm?”

Yang Ye nodded, “It’s at my current limit. In other words, besides True Realm experts, it’s difficult for ordinary cultivators to harm me. Of course, monstrous geniuses like you are excluded.”

Some geniuses couldn’t be judged by convention. For example, even though An Nanjing was merely at the Rebirth Realm, he had no doubt that she could break through his physical defenses. Not to mention her, even Ku Zhuyi’s sword soul technique could accomplish that!

In short, even if his strength had improved, he couldn’t underestimate others!

An Nanjing nodded slightly, “There are many experts here. Regardless of whether it’s you or me, we’re still too weak when compared to the top experts of this place. We must strengthen ourselves incessantly. That’s the only way for us to have a greater chance at survival!”

Yang Ye smiled and spoke seriously, “It must have been hard on you to stay by my side throughout these years.”

She glanced at him and said, “There’s no need to say that between us.”

Yang Ye was about to speak when he suddenly frowned, “Someone’s here!”

He immediately vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

In the outside world.

Yang Ye walked out of his cultivation room, and Yang Xuan was there.

She glanced at him and said, “You’ve grown stronger?”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “Do you need something?”

Yang Xuan pondered deeply for a moment and replied, “There’s a piece of information that you might be interested in.”

Yang Ye asked, “What?”

Yang Xuan replied, “It’s about Lu Lige. I received news that the Lu Clan’s successor, Lu Yuanzhan, crippled his Dantian and hung him outside the Lu Clan’s main city. His life may be in danger.”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Why did the Lu Clan’s successor do that to him?”

Yang Xuan glanced at him and answered, “He has a good relationship with Yang Xing, and you took Yang Xing’s puppets. Since Lu Lige came to the Yang Clan to help you that day, he…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Yang Xuan felt speechless.

A breath of time later, Yang Ye suddenly appeared in front of Yang Xuan again, and he asked, “Where’s the Lu Clan?”

Yang Xuan spoke in a low voice, “What are you planning to do?”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “I asked you where the Lu Clan is!”
