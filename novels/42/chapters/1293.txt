Chapter 1294 – Crush Them!

Senior Yuan didn’t say anything else. In his opinion, it wasn’t bad if Qin Xiao and Qin Xiao’s son died. Because the Qin Clan was the only clan amongst the other powerful clans which frequently disagreed with him. The Qin Clan wanted to replace the Yuan Clan as the number one clan. That wasn’t a secret within the Veiled Region. The reason the Yuan Clan had never acted against the Yuan Clan was naturally because it didn’t want to suffer heavy losses in order to get rid of the Qin Clan. Moreover, they didn’t want the other clan to feel that the Yuan Clan desired supremacy and would crush anyone who didn’t obey them!

If he could rely on Yang Ye to eliminate 2 Voiders from the Qin Clan, then there would be no clan left in the Veiled Region that could go against his Yuan Clan. Moreover, would the Qin Clan that had lost 2 Voiders still be confident enough to fight back against his Yuan Clan’s orders?

“You brought this upon yourself!” Senior Yuan laughed coldly and vanished on the spot.

...

Doomsday City.

Qin Xiao flipped his right palm, and a terrifying wave of pressure instantly surged out from there. It caused the entire city below to tremble.

Everyone within the city looked up at the sky while shock filled their eyes.

Voiders!

The residents of the city started to get restless.

“Stay calm and take your positions. Kill anyone who dares to seize this moment of disorder to cause trouble!” Suddenly, a voice resounded through the city.

Ye Liuyun!

Even though many within the city were still shocked and uneasy, they calmed down upon hearing her voice, and no chaos arose throughout the city. Actually, it was mainly because no one dared to act rashly. While she was just a young woman, she wasn’t someone who showed mercy. Some mercenaries had entered Doomsday City and caused trouble, and the outcome was that every single one of them had been annihilated. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

It can be said that Ye Liuyun’s prestige in the city was merely inferior to Yang Ye.

Ye Liuyun led a group out of the Sword Hall and arrived in the sky. Jian Xu and the others were behind her, and all of them were Emperors. Their faces fell when they saw Qin Xiao and the middle aged man.

2 Voiders!

The Sword Alliance didn’t lack Emperors. If it was just a single Voider, then the joint forces of the entire Sword Alliance and the formation around Doomsday City would be sufficient to fight a Voider, and it wouldn’t be that difficult to attain victory. However, 2 Voiders weren’t something that the Emperors of Doomsday City could resist.

Ye Liuyun hadn’t expected 2 Voiders to have come, and she was quite surprised. But her face was extremely calm. Her gaze descended onto Qin Xiao and said, “You’re from the Veiled Region?”

“You actually know about the Veiled Region!” A wisp of surprise flashed through Qin Xiao’s eyes, and then he nodded, “I presume Yang Ye told you about it. Good, it saves me the effort. I don’t want to waste my breath on you. Just hand Yun Banqing over, and I’ll give all of you a swifter death. Otherwise....”

Ye Liuyun spoke indifferently, “Otherwise, you’ll make us suffer all sorts of torture until we die, right?”

Qin Xiao’s eyes narrowed slightly, “You seem to be completely unafraid. What? Waiting for Yang Ye to come and save all of you?”

Ye Liuyun said, “The Sword Alliance won’t hand Yun Banqing over, that’s our answer.”

A cold smile curled up on the corners of Qin Xiao’s mouth, “Are you sure?”

Ye Liuyun didn’t answer him. She just turned around, bowed slightly, and said, “Senior, please lend us a hand.”

“I was waiting for that!” A voice suddenly resounded, and then a colossus appeared in the distant sky. In an instant, the colossus arrived in the sky above Qin Xiao, and then a fist slammed down at Qin Xiao. The fist hadn’t even arrived before Qin Xiao, yet the powerful force it carried had pushed both Qin Xiao and the middle aged man around 30m back.

Meanwhile, the others saw the true appearance of the colossus.

A huge ape!

A Voider Realm demon beast!

The residents of Doomsday City heaved sighs of relief when they witnessed this scene. The black ape’s arrival had definitely relieved the worry and anxiety in their hearts.

Qin Xiao and the middle aged man’s expressions changed when they saw the black ape. Obviously, they hadn’t expected the Sword Alliance to have a Voider, and it was even a demon beast. They didn’t have the time to think about why the Sword Alliance had the help of a demon beast. Qin Xiao immediately slapped his palm up at the fist.

An energy palm flashed forward and collided with the black ape’s fist.

Bang!

Qin Xiao’s energy palm was instantly blasted into pieces, and the black ape didn’t slow down at all as he shot down towards Qin Xiao before slamming his fist down once more.

A wisp of ferocity flashed through Qin Xiao’s eyes. He twisted both of his hands slightly while a terrifying aura surged out from within him.

“Crush them!” As soon as he finished speaking, Qin Xiao’s figure transformed into a ray of light that shot at the black ape.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man’s gaze immediately descended onto the city once he heard Qin Xiao. He didn’t hesitate to clench his right first. However, another colossus suddenly arose from within the city.

An Imperial Cloud Shuttle? The middle aged man frowned. Suddenly, his expression changed, “That’s a Void Cloud Shuttle! You... you actually have a Void Cloud Shuttle!”

Bang!

Suddenly, a blue beam of light shot from the turret at the top of the Void Cloud Shuttle. It flashed through the sky and instantly arrived before the middle aged man.

The middle aged man’s expression changed when he saw the blue beam of light. He didn’t dare act carelessly at all. He flipped his palm and a saber appeared in his grasp. A moment later, he swung it down with both hands.

Bang!

The beam of light exploded into pieces while the middle aged man was pushed almost 300m back!

Bang!

Meanwhile, another blue beam of light shot out from the turret.

The middle aged man’s eyelids twitched while a wisp of ferocity flashed through his eyes. He stomped his right foot down, and his figure transformed into a ray of light that slammed against the beam of light.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Deafening explosions resounded successively in the sky.

Ye Liuyun looked up at the middle aged man and Qin Xiao, and there was a trace of worry in her eyes. The forces of the Veiled Region had attacked Doomsday City, but there was no sign of Yang Ye. Yang Ye was the backbone of the Sword Alliance. If anything were to happen to Yang Ye, then the Sword Alliance would definitely collapse.

That wasn’t exaggerated at all!

She could deter everyone now, and it was mainly because they knew Yang Ye stood behind her. But once Yang Ye was gone, many within the city would definitely not obey her. As for Jian Xu’s group, they might even leave. After all, they felt that the Sword Alliance had a future while Yang Ye was present, and only with Yang Ye present would they feel that there was hope!

Once Yang Ye was gone, it would be impossible for the Sword Alliance to grow into a Diamond Rank power.

“Sword Master!” Ye Liuyun took a deep breath, “How have you been?”

Bang! Bang!

Explosions resounded like thunderclaps throughout the sky, and the entire sky was trembling. Qin Xiao’s strength was clearly inferior to the black ape, so he was being pushed back repeatedly by the frenzied attacks of the black ape. As for the middle aged man, he was completely locked in combat with the Void Cloud Shuttle, so he couldn’t lend Qin Xiao a hand at all.

Even though the Void Cloud Shuttle exhausted a huge number of violet crystals, violet crystals weren’t a problem for the Sword Alliance anymore.

“Father! Let’s retreat for now!” Meanwhile, the middle aged man suddenly sent a voice transmission to Qin Xiao. The current situation was extremely disadvantageous to them. Because anyone could discern that it was only a matter of time before his father lost. Once his father lost, it was very likely that both of them would die here.

Qin Xiao’s expression changed when he heard the middle aged man. He naturally didn’t want to just flee back to the Veiled Region. However, he was very well aware that it was impossible to crush the Sword Alliance now. Moreover, it was really very likely for them to die if he delayed!

Once he thought up to this point, Qin Xiao didn’t hesitate to say, “Retreat!”

As soon as he spoke, the middle aged man nodded and was about to retreat. However, something unexpected occurred.

A ray of light suddenly flashed out of the space beside the middle aged man. The middle aged man’s expression changed drastically when the ray of light appeared, and his hairs stood on end. His instinct towards danger made him try to dodge, but a strand of terrifying force suddenly pressed down upon him and caused his figure to stiffen slightly.

Just that instant allowed the ray of light to pierce through the center of his forehead.

The middle aged man’s figure stiffened on the spot, and Yang Ye was behind him.

“How... how... how swift....” As soon as the middle aged man finished speaking, a strand of blood sprayed from the center of his forehead. Meanwhile, Yang Ye waved his right hand and took the corpse.

“NO!!!” Qin Xiao’s eyes almost split apart with rage when he saw the middle aged man die. Suddenly, the space behind him rippled, and then a dagger stabbed at his nape.

Qin Xiao’s expression changed drastically. He hadn’t expected there to be more experts here. Fortunately, his reaction wasn’t slow. His figure flashed, and he moved to the side at the critical moment, allowing him to barely avoid that lethal strike. However, he’d only just stopped moving when a ray of light was already in front of him. At the same time, a strand of sword intent pressed down upon him.

Qin Xiao was horrified. He hurriedly released his aura as a Voider in order to resist the sword intent. But his aura had just emerged when the aura of another Voider pressed down upon him and instantly suppressed his aura back into his body.

“I’m finished!” Qin Xiao’s eyes opened wide as such a thought arose in his mind.

A ray of light pierced through the center of his forehead while a dagger stabbed into his nape.

“You... you’re Yang Ye.... Good, good....” Qin Xiao seemed like he wanted to say something, but Yang Ye didn’t give him the chance. Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the ray of light shot through Qin Xiao’s forehead again, causing Qin Xiao’s voice to stop abruptly before the color in his eyes faded.

“It’s the Sword Master!” Meanwhile, someone shouted loudly from within the city.

The gazes of the others descended onto Yang Ye, and the entire city seethed with excitement when they saw Yang Ye’s appearance clearly.

“Sword Master!”

“Sword Master!”

Countless people throughout the city were shouting, and their voices shook the sky.

Ye Liuyun was looking at Yang Ye as well, and there was a slight smile on her face. At this moment, the worry in her heart had finally been relieved.

Yang Ye nodded slightly as he looked down at the city below, and then he pressed his right palm downwards.

In an instant, the city went quiet, perfectly quiet.

“If others don’t offend my Sword Alliance, then my Sword Alliance shall not offend others; but if others offend my Sword Alliance, then my Sword Alliance will crush them! From this moment onwards, I officially declare war on the Veiled Region! I intend to crush those 2 sects and 5 cities!”

Yang Ye’s voice rumbled like a thunderclap throughout the city.
