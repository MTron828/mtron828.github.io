Chapter 1982 – The Primordial Pagoda’s Main Body!

Violence? Discussion?

No!

Trickery was the way!

Just like that, the 11 swords entered Yang Ye’s body. Or to be more precise, they entered the Primordial Pagoda.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

The 11 swords floated in midair.

Snowy gazed at them and kept blinking with curiosity!

Hou Qing, on the other hand, had quite a solemn expression on his face as he stood by Snowy’s side. He’d realized how extraordinary they were.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye glanced at the sky, and then gazed at the swords. At this moment, they were floating there in midair. Obviously, they’d noticed that something was off about this place.

A short while passed before the dark red sword asked, “Where’s the weapon seal?”

“The weapon seal?” Yang Ye chuckled and raised his right hand. The weapon seal appeared in his grasp. He gazed at the dark red sword and grinned, “It’s here. Come get it?”

Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!

11 rays of light flashed and instantly arrived before Yang Ye.

Bang!

Suddenly, a ray of golden light flashed, and then swords were blasted back to where they’d been just a moment ago!

The dark red sword asked in a low voice, “What was that?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Go figure!”

A moment of silence ensued, and then the 11 swords started spinning rapidly. In next to no time, rays of sword energy shot up into the air and seemed to be able to pierce through this world.

Suddenly, a strange sound came from deep within the sky, and then a small golden pagoda appeared there.

The Primordial Pagoda!

The swords felt absolutely threatened, and they immediately converged together and pointed themselves at the golden pagoda!

“Interesting!” Yang Ye chuckled. Ordinary treasures would be immediately subdued upon entering the Primordial Pagoda, but these 11 swords weren’t subdued. Moreover, they seemed like they planned to fight the Primordial Pagoda!

But it did make sense because they were precious treasures of the Weapon Path!

The Primordial Pagoda sensed the battle intent those swords emanated.

It was a form of provocation!

They were actually challenging it?

The Primordial Pagoda shook violently, and then countless rays of golden light covered the surroundings as they shot towards the 11 swords.

Suddenly, the 11 swords started to spin rapidly, and rays of light surged out from them.

In an instant, the entire sky was covered in golden light and sword energy!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The sky started to tremble violently while spatial rifts appeared incessantly. It was absolutely shocking.

Yang Ye frowned on the ground below.

Suddenly, the Primordial Pagoda in the sky shook violently, and then it grew! In an instant, it was at least 100 times larger than before!

A huge golden pagoda appeared in the sky!

A moment later, it descended.

Boom!

The 11 swords were instantly slammed to the ground and were unable to move!

Snowy’s eyes were opened wide. Obviously, she hadn’t expected the pagoda to be able to grow in size!

Yang Ye spoke softly as he gazed at the huge pagoda, “Is that it’s true body?”

Suddenly, the Primordial Pagoda returned to normal. Meanwhile, a ray of golden light flashed on the swords, and the golden light coiled around every single one of them. No matter how they moved, they couldn’t break free of the golden light!

Yang Ye walked over to the swords. He gazed at the Primordial Pagoda and was about to speak, but it had started turning ethereal.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing suddenly said, “You can’t take control of them for now!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly because he’d noticed that too. His current strength was insufficient to take control of those swords.

He would only be courting death if he tried to do so by force!

Suddenly, Hou Qing asked, “Now what?”

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “Leave them like this for now. I’ll come get them once I’ve grown stronger!”

Hou Qing nodded slightly, “That is your only choice!”

Yang Ye glanced at the sky. The Primordial Pagoda had vanished without a trace!

Yang Ye shook his head, withdrew his gaze, and looked at the dark red sword, “According to my knowledge, there should be 12 swords here, but there are only 11 here. Where’s the last sword?”

“It’s deep within the bottom of the tower!” The dark red sword spoke solemnly, “What was that thing? Why was it able to suppress our consciousness?”

“Suppress your consciousness?” Yang Ye frowned, “What do you mean?”

This time, the sword didn’t answer him.

“It’s like the soul of a person!” Meanwhile, Hou Qing continued, “You can think of it as the pagoda possessing the ability to suppress their souls!”

Yang Ye grinned. Looks like they’re afraid of the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something and asked, “Why didn’t all of you leave on your own? Why did you stay here?”

He was puzzled about that. Because they could have left, but they hadn’t, and they just stayed here until now.

That didn’t make sense!

This time, the sword didn’t answer him as well, and he received silence as his answer! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment, and then he asked, “Why is the last sword at the bottom of the tower?”

The sword spoke solemnly, “That sword has fallen into darkness.”

Darkness? Yang Ye frowned, “A sword can fall into darkness too?”

The sword replied, “Can’t it?”

Yang Ye asked curiously, “How?”

The sword fell silent for a long time before it replied, “It lives on devouring people’s souls, especially the souls of sword cultivators. Moreover, it devours the consciousness of swords!”

It devours the consciousness of swords! Yang Ye was speechless. It’s quite interesting indeed!

Meanwhile, the sword suddenly asked, “What do we have to do to make you release us?”

Yang Ye smiled. So that’s why it told me so much!

“You want to leave this place?” Yang Ye smiled, “That’s very simple. Follow me and you’ll be able to go outside!”

“Dream on!” The sword's voice suddenly became fierce, “Damnable human! You’re not qualified at all! We’ll never submit to you!”

Yang Ye shrugged, “Looks like we can’t come to an agreement. Just stay here then!”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away.

The sword's howls could be heard from behind him.

After talking with Hou Qing for a while, Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye gazed at the statue in the hall, and he knew that it should be the previous Seal Master of the Slaughter Line, and that fellow was dead!

He’d inherited the Slaughter Line of the Weapon Path!

A long time passed before Yang Ye left.

He didn’t leave the tower, and he went down instead. The lower he went, the more solemn his expression was.

He had a bad feeling!

Yang Ye stopped. Should I continue?

A short while passed before Yang Ye started walking again.

Continue!

He was a sword cultivator, so how could he fear a sword? If word of it were to spread, wouldn’t everyone laugh at him?

Besides that, he had the holy sword which was called the Sword Supreme!

If worse came to worse, he could let both swords fight each other!

Yang Ye sped up and continued down the tower. The area below grew darker and darker, and the surroundings carried a strand of bone piercing coldness!

After quite some time passed, Yang Ye suddenly stopped.

Because he was back where he had been!

As he walked and walked, he’d walked back to where he’d been!

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he continued forward. However, just like before, he arrived where he had been again.

A short while passed before Yang Ye continued forward. This time, he used the Sword Domain.

With the Sword Domain covering the surroundings, Yang Ye noticed the scene around him change abruptly. Numerous ethereal barriers of light surrounded him, and they were translucent.

“What the heck are these?” Yang Ye frowned. A short while passed before he swung his sword, but the barriers of light didn’t even shake.

Yang Ye flipped his palm and withdrew the Sword Supreme. Meanwhile, he seemed to have thought of something and put the sword away again. After that, he withdrew the weapon seal.

As soon as the weapon seal appeared, the scene around him trembled, and then the barriers of light gradually vanished.

Everything returned to normal.

Yang Ye put the weapon seal away and continued forward. It didn’t take long for him to stop.

He was at the bottom!

A sword was floating not too far ahead. The sword was completely pitch black, but its tip was blood red! Moreover, there were three gaps on its blade!

Besides that, four fine golden chains were coiled around it.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. At this moment, he noticed that the walls were covered in strange blood red symbols. There were also two strange talismans!

Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto the black sword. It’s really sealed up tight here!

Yang Ye walked forward, and he stopped around 10m away from the sword.

At this moment, he saw it clearly. There were two fine words inscribed on the sword—Judgment!

Judgment? Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment and said, “I can take you out of this place, but I have conditions. Do you want to discuss them with me?”

The sword didn’t answer him.

Yang Ye turned around and walked away.

He didn’t hesitate at all!

He turned around and walked away without the slightest hesitation!

Since the sword wanted to be proud like that, he intended to be prouder. It was just a sword, while Yang Ye had the Primordial Pagoda and Sword Supreme! Both of them were better than this sword!

He had the ability to walk away from this sword!

Right when Yang Ye was about to vanish through the door, a voice resounded, “I’ve seen you before!”

“You’ve seen me before?” Yang Ye stopped and gazed at the sword, “Are you kidding?”

“I have!” The sword repeated.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
