Chapter 2711 – Unpredictable!

Yang Ye’s state alarmed Snowy. Snowy hurried over to him when she saw him like this and hugged him.

Yang Ye’s body was still trembling!

But he didn’t go berserk!

A short while later, he closed his eyes slowly and rubbed Snowy’s head, “Don’t be afraid.”

Snowy glanced at him. While he looked very terrifying, his eyes were clear. He hadn’t lost himself.

Yang Ye took Snowy out of the cultivation look, looked up at the sky, and sighed softly.

It wasn’t a state he could just enter as he pleased.

He was utterly incapable of entering the state without sufficient rage! However, once he did enter that state, his strength would improve by practically 10 times!

Fortunately, he was someone he was easily enraged!

Yang Ye fell silent as he looked at the distant sky.

Enemies!

He noticed that his enemies weren’t limited to the people of the End World, it included that form of Destiny too!

A short while later, Yang Ye looked down at Snowy and spoke softly, “How did you survive?”

She had been stabbed by Justice!

Yet now, Snowy was completely fine and well!

Snowy blinked and waved her paws swiftly.

She was very excited!

A short while, Yang Ye understood what she meant!Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

After she turned ethereal, her body condensed into form once more!

Yes!

Even she didn’t know how her dispersed body could condense into form once more!

To put it in simpler terms, she seemed impossible to kill!

That was what Yang Ye thought of it!

But it was normal. After all, Snowy had once been the Good Sprite of this entire universe, and even Destiny’s main body hadn’t been able to kill her!

So long as spirit energy existed, and so long as she hadn’t been destroyed by absolute strength, she was impossible to kill!

Of course, it didn’t represent that she was invincible. The little fellow was very weak when it came to battle!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, rubbed Snowy’s head, and left the Primordial Pagoda.

At this moment, he was in a pitch black vortex, and the Destiny Dimension had collapsed!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and vanished on the spot.

He used Great Unknown to teleport to the 9th layer of space!

His objective was to look for Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu!

He had to locate them as soon as possible. Especially before the main body of the strongest form of Destiny gets to them. Moreover, he had to avoid the experts of the End World now.

If he wanted to get to the outer area of the Four Dimensional Universe, he had to go up there through the 9th layer of Space. Because he wasn’t able to use Great Unknown to force his way through the spatial walls between the Three Dimensional Universe and Four Dimensional Universe, nor did he dare to try!

What if he was teleported to a bad place?

Yang Ye glanced at the 9th layer of space. It was empty and completely devoid of any signs of life!

He looked up and was about to leave when he suddenly looked to the side. A woman was walking over slowly!

No, it wasn’t actually a woman!

Yang Ye was astounded. The figure before him was Yin Yang Goddess who had gone to the End World with him!

There was surprise on her face when she saw Yang Ye. Obviously, she hadn’t expected to meet him here!

Yang Ye smiled, “Long time no see, Senior!”

She sized up Yang Ye and said, “Tsk, tsk. Amazing. You’ve actually grown to such an extent in this short amount of time.”

Yang Ye smiled and looked up at the sky. He said, “Senior, are you interested in going above the 9th layer of space?”

Yin Yang Goddess’ eyes narrowed slightly, and then she gazed at the Great Unknown in Yang Ye’s grasp, “No wonder. You have Great Unknown! I didn’t expect the rumors to be true, you’re really on Destiny’s side!”

She had a slightly strange look in her eyes when she gazed at Yang Ye again!

She’d been hunted by Destiny on many occasions in the past!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “You may be a woman, you’re countless times better than many men.”

She was slightly stunned and asked, “Why do you say that?”

Yang Ye explained, “Firstly, you’re not a hypocrite, unlike some people who act one way in front of you and another way behind your back. Secondly, you know I’m on Destiny’s side, but you didn’t attack me. Obviously, you differentiate clearly between good and bad.”

Yin Yang Goddess glanced at Yang Ye, “I know you’re trying to flatter me, but just as you’ve said, Destiny is Destiny, and you are you. You can’t be considered as one. Moreover, I’m not the type to bully the young when I can’t triumph over the older generation. But…”

She glanced indifferently at him, “You’re absolutely sly and full of tricks. So, I won’t get myself mixed up with you, and I won’t stop you from leaving the 9th layer of space.”

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, you’re not coming?”

She shook her head, “I have a feeling that no good will come from staying with you!”

Yang Ye felt speechless. He didn’t say anything else and just turned around with the intent to leave.

Suddenly, Yin Yang Goddess said, “Hey!”

Yang Ye stopped and gazed at her, and she spoke indifferently, “Let me warn you that the outside world isn’t very safe. It may be more dangerous than it is here.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I know. However, as far as I’m concerned, there are no safe places, right?”

Yin Yang Goddess nodded, “True. Good luck then!”

Yang Ye smiled, “See you next time!”

Yang Ye shot up into the air on his sword.

Yin Yang Goddess glanced up at the space above, and then shook her head. She turned around and walked off into the distance, but she suddenly stopped right after taking a few steps.

She looked ahead, and the space 300m away from her trembled. A moment later, a man in a robe walked out from there. He glanced at her and asked, “Has Yang Ye been here?”

Yin Yang Goddess shook her head, “I don’t know!”

The man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then the space before him rippled.

Yin Yang Goddess’ expression changed slightly. She pressed her palms together and pushed them forward.

Boom!

The space in front of her rippled in a strange arc. At the same time, the man tapped his right foot down.

Bang!

The space before her exploded apart, and she was pushed around 3km back!

She wiped off the blood on the corner of her mouth and said, “Amazing!”

The man glanced at her and looked up at the space above them, “You’re quite fast!”

His figure shot up into the space above them.

The entire 9th layer of space trembled!

A few breaths of time after he left, another group appeared here.

It was Heng Wangu’s group!

Heng Wangu glanced upward, and then he gazed at Yin Yang Goddess, “Mr. Yin Yang, long time no see!”

Yin Yang Goddess replied indifferently, “Heng Wangu, all of you are truly formidable! So many of you are actually going after a single junior!”

“A junior?” Heng Wangu shook his head, “You must be joking. Yang Ye is no junior. Even I am not confident in being able to defeat him in single combat!”

Yin Yang Goddess fell silent.

Actually, she had sensed danger from Yang Ye just now!

Meanwhile, Heng Wangu suddenly said, “Mr. Yin Yang, according to my knowledge, you were hunted by Destiny in the past too. So why don’t you join our undertaking?”

She glanced at Heng Wangu, “You’re really targeting Destiny.”

Heng Wangu smiled and remained silent!

Yin Yang Goddess fell silent for a short while and said, “I won’t interfere in your business!”

She turned around and walked away.

First God’s eyes narrowed slightly and was about to attack, but Heng Wangu stopped him.

Just like that, Yin Yang Goddess vanished before their view.

First God suddenly said, “Brother Wangu, why aren’t we killing her to put an end to all potential troubles?”

Heng Wangu shook his head, “That will just make us even more enemies. Our mission is to gather more people on our side, not kill those who refuse to side with us. If we do that, many experts will feel aversion, and they may even oppose us. So, we don’t have to look for trouble with anyone who doesn’t help Yang Ye.”

First God glanced at Heng Wangu and remained silent.

Heng Wangu looked up, “Do you think Emperor Li can kill him?”

First God fell silent for a moment and said, “If even he can’t kill Yang Ye in single combat…”

First God didn’t finish the sentence.

The surroundings fell silent.

A long time passed before Heng Wangu said, “Then let’s wait and see!”

He looked at Zuo Mu and continued, “Have you found Yang Busi’s exact location?”

Zuo Mu nodded, “I have.”

Heng Wangu nodded, “Let’s go meet that peerless figure who reigned supreme over the ancient times!”

He vanished on the spot with the others.

…

Far away in space, Yang Ye shot up swiftly on his sword. He was so fast that space was being torn open in his wake. At this moment, he was in a spatial passageway.

He’d forcibly cut a passageway open through space!

He was madly slashing the space here in the 9th layer to get out of it!

In other words, he was cutting his way to the border of the Four Dimensional Universe!

Yang Ye didn’t use Past Life or Great Unknown this time!

He wanted to rely on his own strength to charge out of the Three Dimensional Universe!

So, it was extremely difficult. It wasn’t that difficult in the beginning, but he gradually started feeling a little powerless!

The deeper he went, the more terrifying the strength of the space there was. Even his sword was barely able to do anything to the space there!

But that wasn’t even the main point! The main point was that the space around him had started to counterattack!

Countless strands of spatial energy had started to press down upon him and were surging toward him like a torrent!

A solemn expression appeared on Yang Ye’s face!

Suddenly, Yang Ye turned around, and a man had suddenly appeared out of thin air there!

The man wore a robe. He glanced at Yang Ye and was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly swung his sword at the man!

The man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “An unpredictable fellow?”
