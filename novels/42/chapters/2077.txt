Run!

As soon as he saw the old man, Yang Ye had decided to run. It was impossible to fight the old man because even the best outcome would still be one where he died and the old man was injured.

So, Yang Ye had decisively chosen to run. However, he was well aware that he may not be able to escape if he just ran without doing anything. So, he’d put on that show and seized the moment that the old man wasn’t paying attention to use the Origin Stone he’d obtained from that prehistoric expert.

He’d escaped this calamity!

However, Yang Ye was very well aware that he wouldn’t be so lucky again.

In the hall within the prehistoric ruins.

“You’re back!” The voice resounded from the casket as soon as Yang Ye arrived.

Yang Ye gazed at the casket and said, “I’ve found all four Sprites. However, I want to know why you made me find them!”

The voice suddenly said, “You’re afraid I’ll harm them!”

Yang Ye nodded.

The voice asked, “What would you do if I wanted to devour them?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m definitely unable to do anything in this place. However, I can guarantee that you won’t get them! Even if you kill me! You still won’t get them!”

Even if he died, the Primordial Pagoda would survive, and those Sprites would be very safe under the Primordial Pagoda’s care!

The voice fell silent for a long time and said, “You really surprised me!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Huh?”

The voice replied, “Don’t worry, I won’t harm them. Sprites are something my people believe in. It's also why we were willing to pay any price to keep them safe. It’s also why I was willing to meet you that day.”

She was naturally talking about Snowy.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief when he heard the voice. He was afraid that the owner of the voice had ill intent towards the Sprites. If that was true, he would absolutely not give the Sprites away.

Even though Yang Ye was an unscrupulous person at most times, he still had his own principles. If something went against those principles, he would absolutely not do it.

Yang Ye summoned all four Sprites.

The Water Sprite, Mist Sprite, Fire Sprite, and Dark Sprite!

Of course, Snowy was there too!

Once they appeared here, they glanced at each other, and the Dark Sprite frequently glanced at Snowy. There was some fear in its eyes because Snowy had beaten it up earlier.

“It really is all of you!” Meanwhile, the voice in the casket resounded again, “If I didn’t have no other choice, I wouldn’t have disturbed all of you. But if I don’t have your help, I wouldn’t be able to survive. Moreover, the formations we left behind are gradually losing their strength, so it’s very dangerous for all of you to continue staying there.”

The Fire Sprite suddenly asked, “Are you the only one left?”

The voice replied, “There are a few more still sleeping. But not many.”

The Fire Sprite nodded slightly, “What do you need us to do?”

The voice replied, “I need to use the energy of the five elements to reverse death.” She paused for a moment and added, “Give me her Blood Pearl!”

She had naturally said that to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye hurriedly passed her Blood Maiden’s Blood Pearl.

The pearl of blood floated above the casket, and the voice resounded, “Sprites, I need your strength.”

They exchanged glances and didn’t refuse. They released their energy towards the Blood Pearl. At the same time, a stream of golden energy seeped out from the casket and converged on the Blood Pearl.

Yang Ye watched as the Blood Pearl trembled slightly, and then an ethereal figure appeared in the air above the casket.

It was Blood Maiden!

Yang Ye slowly clenched his fists at the sight of this.

He was excited!

Since he came up here from the lower universe, Yang Ye had never forgotten about Blood Maiden. However, it was almost equivalent to reviving the dead, so ordinary people were utterly incapable of it. Even Sages didn’t have the ability to do so. He’d planned to ask the Dao Progenitor after he returned to the Dao Path, but because of the Primordial Pagoda, he wasn’t able to go there, so it had been delayed until now.

Yang Ye felt guilty!

He naturally felt guilty about what had happened to her.

Meanwhile, the voice came from within the casket, “I’ve rebuilt her soul. However, her injuries were too severe, so she still can’t regain her consciousness yet. Deep sleep is recuperation for her. You have that mysterious violet energy, so it can guarantee that nothing happens to her soul. However, you must find divine treasures that can nourish the soul. In that way, you can speed up how fast she can regain consciousness. Once she regains consciousness, she’ll be able to rebuild her body on her own!”

Divine treasures that can nourish the soul? Yang Ye was stunned and asked, “What level of divine treasure?”

“The higher the better!” The voice continued, “There’s no need to rush. She’s fine now. Of course, you must keep her soul away from any harm. Otherwise, even a god wouldn’t be able to save her!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Thank you!”

He glanced at the four Sprites and said, “Senior, since you’ve gotten them, then I’ll be bidding my farewell!”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away.

Suddenly, the voice resounded, “Wait!”

Yang Ye turned around and gazed at the casket. The voice said, “I said that I would help you attain the Zen Realm of this world if you help me find these four Sprites.”

Yang Ye replied, “I changed my conditions. You’ve saved my second sister, so we’re even.”

The voice fell silent for a moment and said, “Then how about we do this. Just owe me a favor, and I’ll help you get to the Zen Realm. It’s a fair trade.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Alright!”

He naturally wouldn’t refuse getting an increase in his strength!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “I’m only at the See Dao Realm right now. Will jumping past a level of cultivation leave any side effects?”

The voice explained, “Under normal circumstances, it will. However, you’re different. Forcefully jumping a realm of cultivation would harm the body and foundation for normal people. However, your body far surpasses your current realm of cultivation. It can be said that your body doesn’t conform to your realm of cultivation at all. So, if you attain the Zen Realm now, it just happens to match the current strength of your body. Thus, even if problems occur, they will be minor issues, and you can resolve them by cultivating a little more!”

Yang Ye was immediately at ease when he heard that. If it harmed his foundation, then he would rather not! He would never accept such a loss just for the sake of short term gain!

The voice said, “The Zen Realm requires comprehension. I can only help you comprehend, but how much you comprehend will be up to you.”

The scene before Yang Ye’s eyes suddenly changed once the voice finished speaking. An old man was seated cross-legged not too far ahead of him. The old man formed a seal before his chest, and the space around him was rippling.

Obviously, the old man was trying to charge into the next realm of cultivation, and it was the Zen Realm!

Yang Ye didn’t really understand why the prehistoric expert was showing him this.

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s expression changed while disbelief filled his eyes. Because he could clearly sense everything. The old man’s thoughts, the old man’s current state… He could sense it all very clearly. It was like he was the old man!

At this moment, Yang Ye understood why the prehistoric expert had done this!

Suddenly, a mouthful of blood sprayed from the old man. The old man laughed bitterly. There was some helplessness and sorrow in his laughter.

He’d failed!

Yang Ye fell silent.

Meanwhile, the scene before him changed once more. There was a middle aged man not too far away from him. At this moment, the middle aged man was facing a waterfall, and he seemed to be meditating as he gazed at the falling water.

Just like before, Yang Ye could clearly sense everything, including the middle aged man’s current mental state.

The middle aged man was much calmer than the previous old man.

A long time passed before a smile suddenly appeared on the corners of his mouth, “I see…”

Bang!

As soon as he said that, a terrifying aura suddenly swept out from him. However, it only took a moment for the aura to surge back into him.

The Zen Realm!

The middle aged man had succeeded!

Yang Ye fell into deep thought, and no one knew what he was thinking.

Suddenly, the scene before him changed.

Just like that, cultivator after cultivator appeared before him. Without exception, all of them were charging into the Zen Realm!

The help the prehistoric expert gave him was allowing him to personally experience the process these experts went through to get into the Zen Realm. This process was naturally extremely useful to him. Of course, this was no different than cheating, and it was like taking a shortcut. However, it was a shortcut with very little side effects.

His success still depended on himself.

Most importantly, he had to stay true to his heart. He couldn’t allow anything to affect his mental state, and he only had a chance to advance if he could stay true to his heart. Otherwise, not to mention advancing, he may even form inner demons and never be able to advance further!

The reason the prehistoric expert had dared to let him take this method was because he was a sword cultivator.

If he couldn’t even stay true to his heart, then he wasn’t worthy of being a sword cultivator!

Just like that, time trickled by.

Even Yang Ye didn’t know how long it had been. In any case, cultivators were appearing over and over again before him. They were so numerous that he couldn’t keep count. During this period, he’d watched many fail, but he’d also watched many succeed.

Some failed at the last moment. However, that last step was the most difficult step to take.

Just like that, as he watched, and watched, Yang Ye closed his eyes.

As soon as he did that, the surroundings returned to normal. At this moment, he was seated cross-legged in the hall.

He was like an ancient monk in meditation.

Day after day passed by.
