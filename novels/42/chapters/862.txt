Chapter 863 – I’m Daoist Gu!

It was the Herculean Hammer, of course!

The Herculean Hammer was terrifying because it was capable of multiplying Yang Ye’s strength by 5 times at least. Yang Ye’s own strength was already comparable to a demon beast at the Half-Saint Realm. So, once it was enhanced by the Herculean Hammer, how terrifying would it be?

While Yang Ye was only at the Exalt Realm, he had no doubt that he could use the Herculean Hammer to kill a mid rank Half-Saint even without using a sword. It was even to the extent that he could fight a high rank Half-Saint!

At the moment Yang Ye’s hammer flew into the air, Chen Dong and Yi Liufeng’s expressions had changed drastically. Both of them had never imagined that Yang Ye’s attack would actually be terrifying to such an extent. Especially Yi Liufeng. He felt himself being targeted and locked onto by a terrifying force when the hammer left Yang Ye’s grasp, and that force was as terrifying as a myriad of mountains.

While he was astounded, Yi Liufeng’s reaction wasn’t slow at all. He swiftly pressed his palms together, and the space before him wriggled before forming numerous spatial walls.

However....

The spatial walls shattered into pieces before the Herculean Hammer while spatial rifts swept throughout the surroundings. At the same time, the Herculean Hammer arrived before Yi Liufeng, and it caused Yi Liufeng’s pupils to constrict slightly before a wisp of ferocity flashed through his eyes. He suddenly pulled his palms apart, and a spatial rift appeared in front of him.

The Herculean Hammer was swallowed by the spatial rift. But the expanse of space before Yi Liufeng suddenly exploded apart in the next moment, and then a powerful wave of energy blasted him backwards 600m away.

Yang Ye stretched out his hand and gestured. 3 breaths of time passed before the Herculean Hammer flashed out from space and returned to his grasp. There was a wisp of a bitter smile on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth as he gazed at the hammer in his grasp.

His meridians had recovered, his appearance had recovered as well, but the only thing which hadn’t recovered was the Primordial Pagoda. At this moment, it was still in the form of the tiny vortex. As for the Herculean Hammer, it had jumped out from the tiny vortex, and that was why he felt so puzzled and depressed. Because the Herculean Hammer had emerged from within the Primordial Pagoda, but it hadn’t recovered.

All in all, it was a good thing. Because it proved that the Primordial Pagoda was still in a normal state. In other words, Su Qingshi and the others should be fine. As for why the Primordial Pagoda was still in the shape of the tiny vortex, he felt that it was probably because the Primordial Pagoda had been severely damaged. After all, it had acknowledged him as its master. So if he suffered a heavy injury, the Primordial Pagoda would definitely be unable to avoid being affected. Moreover, Xiao Qi had damaged the Primordial Pagoda when she was playing with it in the first place.

No matter what, the current situation was looking very good. Because his meridians had been repaired, his body had been repaired as well, and he knew that Su Qingshi and the others were fine. Moreover, he even had the Herculean Hammer now.

Besides his sword intent which still hadn’t recovered, his strength could be said to have recovered by at least 80%. If his sword intent was restored, then there was no one beneath the Saint Realm which he couldn’t kill!

“You....” Yi Liufeng gazed at Yang Ye with astonishment. He hadn’t expected Yang Ye’s physical strength to be terrifying to the point of being capable of shattering space with ease. My god! Is this fellow really a sword cultivator and not a body cultivator?

Yang Ye stated, “You’ve lost!”

Yi Liufeng’s expression was slightly unsightly. A long time passed before he nodded, “Being pushed back by the physical strength of a sword cultivator really can be considered as my loss. Very good! Very good indeed. This time, the Dao Order will probably be tricked to death.” When he spoke up to this point, he waved his right hand, and a command token appeared before Yang Ye, “If you encounter disciples of my academy in the future, you just have to display this command token and no one will dare to act disrespectfully to you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yi Liufeng turned around, took a step forward, and vanished on the spot.

“The Cloud Academy Token!” Chen Dong suddenly said, “I never expected the Ocean of Clouds Academy to actually give that command token to you!”

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

Chen Dong explained, “The Cloud Academy Token is a symbol of status. While an owner of that token has no actual authority in the academy, but anyone from the academy must respect its owner. If a member of the academy disrespects its owner, that person would be punished severely by the Discipline Hall of the academy, and they would be expelled if it’s a serious case! If memory serves, the Ocean of Clouds Academy has only issued 2 of these command tokens in the past, and the Ocean of Clouds Academy owes both of them a huge debt!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why did they give one to me?”

Chen Dong pondered deeply for a long time before she said, “They probably intend to draw you over to their side. While you’re a disciple of the Ancient Sword School, it doesn’t stop you from joining the academy. Do you know, the Ocean of Clouds Academy is actually just a branch!”

“A branch?” Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly. After all, the Ocean of Clouds Academy was a Platinum Rank power, yet it was only a branch?

Chen Dong nodded, “There’s a Diamond Rank power in the Central Divine Prefecture, and it’s called White Deer Academy. The Dean of the Ocean of Clouds Academy was a disciple of White Deer Academy. Supposedly, he committed a grave offense many years ago, and that was why he was sent to Pine Prefecture. He was quite a proud and arrogant person, so he established the Ocean of Clouds Academy in Pine Prefecture and would lead its geniuses to the Central Divine Prefecture to participate in White Deer Academy’s competition which is held every 10 years. His goal is to prove that his disciples aren’t inferior to the disciples of White Deer Academy. Unfortunately, it has been a few hundred years now, yet his academy hasn’t won a single time.”

Yang Ye asked, “You think he wants me to participate in that competition?”

Chen Dong replied, “He probably intends to wait and see. But he definitely thinks you have great potential, and that’s why he ordered Yi Liufeng to give that command token to you. The conditions Yi Liufeng spoke about earlier were probably a way to test you, and the outcome was that he lost from a single move. So....”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Let’s talk about this later!” He couldn’t even deal with his own problems right now, so how could he possibly participate in that competition? However, he did take the command token. In any case, there was no harm in accepting it.

Swish!

Suddenly, a ray of light flashed through the sky, and then Wu Yanzhong appeared before them.

Yang Ye and Chen Dong’s expressions changed slightly when they saw him. Because he had a head in his right hand, and it belonged to Kong Lian!

Wu Yanzhong tossed the head to the ground and said, “I received a signal for help from other disciples, so I left Martial Enlightenment City. But I never imagined that the Dao Order would have acted immediately once I did. Not only was I unable to protect those two sisters from the Fan Clan, I made Brother Yang return to the city, and it even resulted in the horrible deaths of Lin Xiao’s group and many other disciples.”

Wu Yanzhong took a deep breath when he spoke up to this point, and then he pointed his finger towards his left arm and made a slashing movement. His left arm instantly flew off into the air.

Yang Ye and Chen Dong were shocked, and then Yang Ye sighed softly. He didn’t blame Wu Yanzhong, of course. After all, it was he who caused all of this, so how could he have any right to blame Wu Yanzhong? However, he hadn’t expected Wu Yanzhong to actually feel guilty to the point of severing his own arm.

Chen Dong seemed to be unable to bear the sight of this and said, “Why do that? Yang Ye killed that fellow from the Hidden Path and that Dao Order Steward, and you’ve killed her. Both of you’ve avenged them, and I presume they would feel gratified if they knew. So, why sever your own arm?”

Wu Yanzhong shook his head and said, “They wouldn’t have died if I didn’t leave! Brother Yang wouldn’t have returned to the city as well and almost died here.” When he spoke up to this point, he gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Brother Yang, you’re heading to the Dao Order to challenge all its geniuses?”

Yang Ye nodded. He hadn’t been acting impulsively when he said that, and it was because he really intended to put an end to this conflict. Otherwise, if the Dao Order were to continuously chase after him, then even if they don’t get tired of it, he would! So, he’d decided to put an end to it all!

“I’ll go with you tomorrow!” Wu Yanzhong spoke while a determined and firm gaze filled his eyes.

Yang Ye asked, “Are you sure?”

“Of course!” Wu Yanzhong gazed at Chen Dong and said, “You won’t stop me, right?”

Chen Dong pondered deeply for a short moment and said, “The higher-ups will definitely not allow both of you to go. Especially Yang Ye. If I’m not wrong, then they’ve definitely dispatched experts to get you. You’ve comprehended the Sword Domain, so you and Senior Sister Lu will definitely become the backbone of our Ancient Sword School in the future. Perhaps we might even be able to rely on you and Senior Sister Lu to become a Diamond Rank sect! So, they would absolutely not allow you to face any danger!”

When he spoke up to this point, Chen Dong smiled and said, “However, I think they’re asking for too much. The sword cultivators of our Ancient Sword School should take revenge when there’s enmity, and it’s best to think about the future in the future. Otherwise, we would all be bound. So, I’ll be going with both of you tomorrow. Even I would like to experience the strength of those so-called geniuses of the Dao Order!

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “Alright, then we’ll head to the Dao Order tomorrow!”

“You’re heading to the Dao Order? You shameless liar! If anyone is going, then it should be me, Nalan Ying!” A clear and melodious shout that carried anger resounded, and then a ray of sword energy swept through the sky. Moreover, the force within it simply seemed as if it intended to split the world apart. It was truly an astonishing sight!

2nd level Heaven Rank sword intent!

All three of their expressions changed slightly. However, Chen Dong and Wu Yanzhong didn’t attack, and there was a trace of bewilderment in their eyes. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Yang Ye naturally had to attack because the sword energy had arrived in front of him. He swiftly smashed the Herculean Hammer forward, and that powerful strand of sword energy was immediately blasted into pieces.

Meanwhile, a woman appeared before them. She was about to attack again, but a voice suddenly resounded, “Ying’er, you’re no match for him!”

As soon as this voice resounded, an old man who carried a sword chest on his back appeared in front of Yang Ye, and the old man’s gaze immediately descended onto Yang Ye, “Who are you?”

A Saint Realm expert!

Yang Ye’s heart shook. Obviously, the old man was probably an expert of the Ancient Sword School! Yang Ye cupped his fists to the old man and said, “I’m Yang Ye, a personal disciple of Daoist Gu from Heavenly Sword Peak....”

Yang Ye didn’t notice that Wu Yanzhong and Chen Dong were looking at him like he was a monster.

The corners of the old man’s eyes twitched, “You’re Daoist Gu’s disciple?”

“Of course!” Yang Ye nodded.

“My ass!” The old man suddenly roared, “I’m Daoist Gu! You’re my disciple? You’re my disciple!?”

Yang Ye was speechless.
