Chapter 1473 – Loneliness!

As they say, life was like a game of chess, and chess was like life. However, how could a Go board be used to represent a person’s life?

Yang Ye understood what the middle aged meant.

It meant the middle aged man had aroused the intent to kill him!

This intent to kill had appeared once he lost the game. He didn’t know why the middle aged man wanted to kill him, but he was very certain that it was related to the game.

Since the middle aged man wanted to use the game as the basis, Yang Ye had destroyed it.

The middle aged man stared at Yang Ye. He didn’t speak nor did he attack, and he just looked at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye said, “Allow me to be honest. Senior, you’ve strayed.”

“I’ve strayed?” The middle aged man suddenly chuckled, “I never expected that I, the Saint of Go, would actually be said to have strayed, and it was even by a junior. Interesting. Go on and tell me about it.”

The Saint of Go? Yang Ye glanced at the middle aged man and said, “Senior, as far as you’re concerned, life is like a game of Go, right?”

The middle aged man shook his head slightly, “Go is even more complicated than man!”

Yang Ye asked, “Is it more complicated than the heart of man?”

The middle aged man was stunned.

Yang Ye continued, “Senior, you’re called the Saint of Go, so I presume you’ve attained the acme of perfection in it. But as far as I’m concerned, you’ve strayed from the path. Because Go is positioned at the top in your heart, and everything else is beneath it. Just as you said earlier, you think that Go is more complicated than the heart of man. But tell me, is there anything in this world that’s more complicated than the heart of man?”

The middle aged man fell silent. Because he couldn’t refute Yang Ye. The heart of man was the most complicated thing in the world. It changed the easiest, and it was the most difficult to fathom.

Yang Ye continued, “They say there are three levels — looking at a mountain and seeing a mountain, looking at a mountain yet not seeing a mountain, and looking at a mountain and seeing a mountain again. They represent three types of mental states, and those who can comprehend these mental states are definitely not ordinary. Senior, which level do you think I’m at?”

The middle aged man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Please do tell!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “I’m not in any one of those levels. Let me ask you something. Why should we even look at the mountain?”

As he spoke, Yang Ye pointed at his chest, “The most complicated thing in the world isn’t a mountain or Go, it’s ourselves. Our own hearts! This heart doesn’t just deceive others, it even deceives us sometimes. What would you get if you look at things with a heart that even deceives itself?” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The middle aged man remained silent.

Yang Ye flipped his palm, and a Go board made out of energy appeared before them. Yang Ye gazed at it and chuckled, “Senior, you say that the game of Go is like my life. But as far as I’m concerned, it’s just a game. I know that as far as you’re concerned, it’s not that simple, and it definitely contains life philosophies, mental states, the Dao, and so on and so forth. However, as far as I’m concerned, it’s just a game.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his hand, and the Go board vanished, “See, it’s gone. However, I’m still here. While one is still alive, the game has boundless possibilities. However, if one is gone, then it’ll just be an ordinary game. It’s extraordinary because of the user, and it’s not the person who becomes extraordinary because of it. Just like this sword in my hand and my Sword Dao. They are extraordinary because of me, Yang Ye! Senior, if you want to comprehend the world and all the things in it, then you must first understand yourself. If you can’t even understand yourself, then trying to comprehend the world is just a joke.”

What was the sword?

Yang Ye has asked himself that question on many occasions. However, he always got the same answer. As far as he was concerned, the sword was a weapon, a weapon to kill. It was just that simple. Perhaps others wouldn’t be of the same mind. The swords of others contained many states of comprehension, philosophies of life, and the Grand Dao.

However, his sword didn’t. As far as he was concerned, the sword was just a weapon!

His sword would change according to the person he was, and he wasn’t the one who changed according to the sword he possessed.

The sword was extraordinary because of its user! A person who was extraordinary because of his sword was a person who was enslaved by his sword. Just like the middle aged man, the game of Go surpassed everything in his heart.

Simply speaking, he was enslaved by it.

The middle aged man slowly closed his eyes and fell silent.

Yang Ye remained silent as well. He didn’t know how strong the middle aged man was, but he knew that the middle aged man was definitely extremely strong. So, he didn’t dare attack rashly while the middle aged man hadn’t attacked. If it were possible, he felt it was best if they could just talk about it. After all, the middle aged man seemed very understanding!=!

A long time passed before the middle aged man opened his eyes slowly, and there was a wisp of self-ridicule on the corner of his mouth, “No wonder! No wonder! The sword is extraordinary because of its user, and Go is the same. No wonder I’ve still been unable to attain the Enlightened Go Heart of legend.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “I’ve been studying the Dao of Go for all these years, but I never studied myself. Just as you’ve said, I’ve strayed from the path. I am the true foundation of everything!”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s great that you’re able to comprehend that!”

“I can only be considered as widening my thoughts!” The middle aged man grinned, “The Dao of Go isn’t as complicated as the heart of man. However, it’s still broad and profound. It’s not something I can rise a level in from just a single piece of enlightenment. However, if I didn’t gain this enlightenment, then I may have been unable to improve for my entire lifetime. In short, I have to thank you.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Just don’t kill me!” Yang Ye hadn’t forgotten how the middle aged man had aroused the intent to kill him.

“I’m not an ungrateful person!” The middle aged man shook his head slightly, “However, you were lucky to have encountered me today. Of course, I’m lucky as well.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and spoke seriously, “Your heart is pure and isn’t affected by the outside world. Such a heart.... In short, your future accomplishments are limitless.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Senior, you’re too kind. But I’m sure you’re aware that I only have around two months to live. The future.... Even having a future is a huge problem for me!”

“The Forest of Darkness!” The middle aged man smiled, “You want me to tell you how to get there, right?”

Yang Ye cupped his fist to the middle aged man, “Please do tell me, Senior.”

The middle aged man pondered deeply for a moment and said, “Continue forward and you’ll get there.”

Yang Ye glanced at the area behind the middle aged man, and then he asked, “Will it be dangerous?”

“It will!” The middle aged man nodded, “It’ll be very dangerous. So, you have to be careful. However, you may obtain a huge number of benefits as well.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Thank you! Senior, I have other things to attend to, so I’ll be bidding farewell now!”

The middle aged man smiled, “I hope I’ll be able to see you come back! Sincerely!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I hope I’ll be able to get back alive as well. Farewell!” As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, he immediately vanished into the distance.

The middle aged man gazed in that direction for a long time, and then he shook his head, “Death is beyond Yellow Springs River. I don’t want to kill you.... However, I can’t save you as well. Your fortune will decide if you live or die.”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure shook slightly and vanished on the spot.

Once he vanished, the scene here actually started to transform, and it gradually transformed into a completely different scene. If Yang Ye came back here, he would definitely not recognize it anymore, and he wouldn’t be able to find his way out. Because the path was gone!

...

After he bid farewell to the middle aged man, Yang Ye continued forward. Actually, he felt something was off. But he couldn’t put a finger on it. In any case, he felt something was strange. However, he had no choice but to continue forward. Head back? What about the Spring of Life? Moreover, he would bump into the giant if he headed back!

He had no choice!

He had to continue forward until the end!

In any case, he’d met all sorts of strange people and demons in the Ominous Territory. So, meeting more wasn’t a big deal. Moreover, he had so many demon beasts with him. Thus, so long as he didn’t encounter something abnormal like the towering giant, he wouldn’t have to fear anyone.

All along the way, Yang Ye didn’t encounter any danger. But he still didn’t dare act carelessly.

After all, carelessness was equivalent to death in this place!

Suddenly, a ray of white light flashed, and then Little Sky appeared in front of him.

Yang Ye was slightly stunned. He hadn’t expected her to suddenly appear in front of him, and he immediately asked, “What are you doing out here?”

She didn’t answer him. She just glanced at the surroundings and said, “This place feels so familiar!”

“Familiar?” Yang Ye frowned, “You’ve been here?”

Little Sky frowned and thought for a while, “I think I have, but I think I haven’t. In any case, I can’t remember.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she gazed at him and said, “This place seems to be slightly dangerous. Be careful. Hehe! I’m going back in to play.”

Once she finished speaking, she didn’t wait for Yang Ye to speak and immediately transformed into a ray of white light that entered Yang Ye’s body.

Yang Ye felt speechless.

A short while later, Yang Ye immersed his consciousness into his body. Little Sky had gone off somewhere. Even though he could find her in an instant, he didn’t disturb her. He knew that she definitely wasn’t able to remember whether she’d actually been here.

But he was quite bewildered. Wasn’t she sleeping before this? How could she have come here in the past?

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then he shook his head and continued forward. Regardless of whether she’d been here or not, it wasn’t very important to him. As for the danger she spoke of, he didn’t take it seriously. After all, he’d know that it was very dangerous since the moment he entered the Ominous Territory.

Moreover, he’d never relaxed his guard!

After walking for around an hour, Yang Ye suddenly stopped. There was a mountain not too far ahead. The mountain wasn’t very tall, and it was just a little over 3km tall. But the mountain seemed as if someone had sliced it open at the center with a sword. There was a crack in the center that was around 3m wide, and the crack was why the mountain seemed like it was two mountains!

Yang Ye observed the crack carefully. He realized that it didn’t just seem like it had been split open by a sword, it actually had been! The edges of the crack were smooth like a mirror!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye’s gaze to descend to the left side of the mountain. There was a line of words at its center — Being invincible is the loneliest thing! The Unfettered One was here!”
