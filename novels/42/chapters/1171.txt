Chapter 1172 – A Quasi Emperor? I Can Fight 10 Of Them!

The black robed man and the others stopped in the sky above Yang Ye because the white dragon’s auras was gone.

All of them had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces.

It didn’t take long for their gazes to descend upon Yang Ye’s shivering figure.

Mu Canglan and Ye Liuyun frowned when they saw Yang Ye. Because they hadn’t expected it to be him. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Meanwhile, the black robed man suddenly gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Did you see a white dragon fly by?”

Yang Ye glanced at the black robed man with terror, and then he stretched out a trembling hand as he pointed towards the distance. He spoke with a trembling voice, “There... there was a black robed and white haired old man. He had a sword in his grasp, and he flew over there with a dragon in his grasp.”

“A white haired old man?” The black robed man frowned slightly, and he was about to leave when he suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, “Why are you trembling?”

Yang Ye couldn’t even speak smoothly as he said, “I... I... was afraid.”

“Trash!” The black robed man waved his right hand as he finished speaking, and a powerful wave of energy shot forward and instantly slammed against Yang Ye.

“AHH!” A shrill cry resounded as Yang Ye’s figure was smashed into the ground.

The black robed man didn’t even spare Yang Ye a second glance before vanishing into the distance with the others.

As for Ye Liuyun and the others, they didn’t continue their pursuit. They’d missed the best opportunity, and they would only be throwing themselves into a pit of death by following the black robed man’s group.

“Good luck!” Elder Mo gazed at Ye Liuyun and the others as he cupped his fists. After that, he led the Snow Lion Mercs away. The other mercenaries and independent cultivators at the Quasi Emperor Realm hesitated for a moment, and then they turned around and left. Presently, it was time to flee. Because they knew that it wouldn’t take long for Doomsday City’s forces to start pursuing them. Perhaps their experts were already on the way now.

Only the 3 members of the Souleater Mercs remained on the spot.

Ye Liuyun held her dark green longbow tightly and remained silent.

The grey robed old man by Ye Liuyun’s side asked, “What do you plan to do now?”

Ye Liuyun was about to speak when she suddenly looked down at the deep hole in the ground. She grabbed a figure out of it with her right hand. It was naturally Yang Ye’s figure.

Mu Canglan and the old man were slightly stunned when they saw Yang Ye. Because he was still alive. After all, they’d sensed Yang Ye’s aura vanish when he was struck earlier.

Yang Ye gazed at them while slight fear could be seen on his face.

Ye Liuyun asked, “What are you doing here?”

Yang Ye glanced at Mu Canglan and said, “I... I was afraid that she would kill me. So... so I fled.”

Ye Liuyun gazed at Yang Ye for a short while and said, “Who are you?”

Yang Ye’s face was covered in bewilderment as he said, “Huh?”

Ye Liuyun gazed at Yang Ye and said, “When we met for the 1st time, both Canglan and Gu Lan hadn’t been able to avoid my arrow, yet you could. The second time we met, which was just now, you’d attained the Saint Realm from the Half-Saint Realm. Moreover, you’ve appeared here now and are completely unharmed after suffering the attack of a Quasi Emperor. Do you really intend to continue keeping up this act?”

Mu Canglan and the old man’s gazes instantly descended upon Yang Ye, and there was doubt in their eyes.

Yang Ye remained silent.

Ye Liuyun continued, “That person who took the Divine Grade spirit vein is related to you, right?”

Yang Ye shook his head decisively. What a joke! He couldn’t admit that! Otherwise, he would be besieged by everyone in this place and Doomsday City. While he didn’t fear them, he wasn’t stupid enough to make enemies for no reason.

Ye Liuyun asked, “Then what are you doing here? Don’t tell me it’s because Canglan wanted to kill you. If it really was that, then you should be fleeing towards the outside and not this place!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Actually... actually, I just wanted to loot some treasures, but I never expected to encounter all of you on your way to pursue that white dragon.”

Ye Liuyun was about to say something when the old man spoke instead, “We have to leave already.”

Ye Liuyun glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Come with us if you don’t want to die!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Ye Liuyun turned around and left.

Yang Ye glanced at her, and then followed after her.

...

Ye Liuyun and the others’ expressions changed when they left the ruins. Because everyone who’d emerged from the ruin was just ahead.

A group of blue robed figures were all around the area, and there were a few thousand of them. All of them were at the Saint Realm or above, and they’d encircled the people here. The blue and white robed man with a sword on his waist and a woman in a blue dress were standing not too far away from everyone. There were 5 other white robed old men standing behind the man and woman.

The man, woman, and the 5 old men were Quasi Emperors!

Yang Ye was stunned when he saw the man with the sword. Because that fellow’s appearance was actually quite alike to his own. Yang Ye turned to look at Nan Shuang who was standing not too far away. Sure enough, Nan Shuang’s gaze was fixed on that fellow.

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment, and then he walked over to Nan Shuang and spoke softly, “He’s that fiancé of yours?”

Nan Shuang remained silent.

Yang Ye rubbed Nan Shuang’s head, and then he gazed at the man. Meanwhile, that man with a sword glanced at everyone here and said, “My Dark Sky Sect has no intention to make things difficult for all of you. We just want the Divine Grade spirit vein!”

Meanwhile, Elder Mo from the Snow Lion Mercs said, “It’s in the hands of Doomsday City. You can go in and ask them for it!”

“Then I’ll wait for them to come out!” The man grinned and said, “I forgot something. My Dark Sky Sect is interested in the treasures within the ruins. So, you can sell what you’ve obtained in the ruins to my Dark Sky Sect. Don’t worry, my Dark Sky Sect will definitely treat all of you well and give you a reasonable price!”

At this point, he pointed at the disciples who were standing not too far behind him and said, “All of you can leave now if you want. You just have to let us take a look at the contents of your spatial rings. If we’re interested in anything, then we’ll purchase it immediately; if we aren’t interested, then all of you may leave. Right, let me give all of you a word of advice. Don’t try anything. Otherwise, don’t blame my Dark Sky Sect for showing no mercy!”

The expressions of everyone here had instantly turned gloomy upon hearing him.

Let them see the contents of our spatial rings? They clearly intend to rob us!

The man grinned, and then he moved back to the side of the woman in a blue dress.

Meanwhile, the woman’s gaze suddenly descended onto Nan Shuang. The others in front of Nan Shuang hurriedly moved aside at the sight of this. Just like that, Nan Shuang was exposed before the woman in a blue dress.

Meanwhile, the man with a sword on his waist gazed at Nan Shuang as well, and he was instantly stunned when he saw her.

The woman walked over to Nan Shuang, so the man hurriedly followed her. Meanwhile, Nan Shuang’s hands were clenched tightly while her gaze was still locked onto the man.

The expressions of the members of the former Phoenix Mercs changed, and they hurriedly went over and stood behind Nan Shuang. Meanwhile, Mu Canglan appeared by Nan Shuang’s side as well, and her eyes were filled with vigilance.

Ye Liuyun’s brows knit together at the sight of this scene.

Nan Shuang finally gazed at the woman in a blue dress when she arrived around 50m away from Nan Shuang.

The woman gazed at Nan Shuang and said, “I noticed that you’ve been constantly staring at my darling since we arrived here. Tell me why!”

Nan Shuang glanced at the man and remained silent.

Meanwhile, the man hesitated for a moment and said, “Yan’er, she... she used to be my fiancée!”

“Your fiancée!” The woman’s eyes instantly narrowed when she heard him, and her gaze was icy cold.

The man’s expression changed slightly at the sight of this, and he hurriedly said, “But there’s no connection between us now. I cut off all ties with her when master took interest in my potential that day. There’s no connection between us anymore.”

The woman gazed at him and asked, “Really?”

The man hurriedly nodded, “Of course. Yan’er, just take a look for yourself. Can she even be compared to you? Both her appearance and natural talent are inferior to yours, so how could I possibly have any connection to her? Yan’er, you’re the only one in my heart. I can swear on it.”

The woman in a blue dress said, “Then kill her!”

Mu Canglan and the others’ expressions changed drastically when they heard her.

Yang Ye glanced at the woman in a blue dress, and then he gazed at the man with a sword on his waist.

Nan Shuang was looking at the man as well.

Even the man with a sword was stunned by what the woman had said. Obviously, he hadn’t expected her to say that. Meanwhile, the woman in a blue dress continued, “What? You can’t bear to kill her?”

The man’s expression changed slightly. Meanwhile, the woman spoke abruptly again, “You can’t bear to do it? It’s fine! Then go with her!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and walked away.

“I’ll kill her!” Suddenly, the man’s voice resounded.

The woman stopped and turned around to look at him, “I’ll be watching!”

The man gazed at Nan Shuang with a gloomy expression on his face, and he spoke fiercely, “Don’t blame me. You can only blame yourself. Why did you look at me for no reason? I told you that there’s no connection between us anymore. We aren’t from the same world at all! We aren’t!”

Nan Shuang clenched her fists and said, “Lin Xing, what... what are you so proud of? Aren’t you just a Quasi Emperor?” As she spoke, she felt that there was no confidence in her words, so she turned around and gazed at Yang Ye, “Don’t you think so too?”

Yang Ye nodded and was really cooperative, “Quasi Emperors really are nothing worth mentioning.”

A wisp of disdain arose on the corners of Lin Xing’s mouth, “It is nothing worth mentioning, but killing both of you will be as easy as stomping on ants!”

Yang Ye chuckled, and then he rubbed Nan Shuang’s head and said, “Do you want to beat him up?”

Nan Shuang nodded unconsciously.

Yang Ye smiled, “Then how about I help you do that?”

Nan Shuang was about to nod again, but she suddenly gazed at Yang Ye and spoke softly, “Are you still going to brag at a time like this. Just... just go!”

Meanwhile, the woman in a blue dress spoke abruptly, “Are you still not going to do it?”

Lin Xing stopped hesitating and issued a command in his heart. The sword on his waist suddenly left its sheath and transformed into a ray of light that shot at Nan Shuang.

Nan Shuang’s face instantly turned pale. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly pulled her behind him.

Nan Shuang’s expression changed drastically. She was just about to push Yang Ye aside when her eyes and mouth suddenly opened wide. Moreover, her eyes were filled with shock and disbelief.

Everyone else here had a similar reaction.

Because they saw Lin Xing’s sword being held by 2 fingers.

Yang Ye gazed at Lin Xing who was standing afar with shock on his face, and then a slight smile curled up on Yang Ye’s face, “A Quasi Emperor? I can fight 10 of them!”
