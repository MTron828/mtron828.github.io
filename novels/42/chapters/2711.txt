Chapter 2712 – I’m Here!

The middle aged man hadn’t expected Yang Ye to immediately attack!

As far as he was concerned, a chat before the fight was absolutely necessary, wasn’t it?

However, Yang Ye had immediately attacked!

While it has exceeded his expectations a little, the middle aged man’s reaction was extremely swift. As soon as Yang Ye’s sword arrived before him, he’d moved around 30m back!

Yang Ye’s attack missed. He was about to attack again when an afterimage shot at him!

It was the middle aged man!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He moved slightly sideways and swung his sword horizontally.

Suddenly, a hand grabbed his sword!

A bare hand!

At this instant, Yang Ye decisively chose to release his sword, and then another sword appeared in his grasp. No, it was two swords!

They were Past Life and the Great Unknown!

At the same moment, the middle aged man released the sword and floated 300m back!

At the instant he left, two swords slashed down where he’d been a moment ago!

Yang Ye stopped and looked up at the middle aged man, and there was a solemn expression deep within his eyes.

The middle aged man’s combat instinct was terrifying!

Yang Ye didn’t attack again because the space in the surroundings was pressing down upon him.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

He wasn’t in the 9th layer of space anymore!

The middle aged man sized up Yang Ye, “No wonder the End World was willing to pay such a huge price to hire me. You do have some skill!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he raised his right hand slightly and shook it left and right.

Boom!

The space pressing down upon him on both sides was blasted 3km backward!

Hiss!

A moment later, the sound of something being sliced apart resounded.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he tapped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that shot forward!

Boom!

An instant later, a rumbling explosion resounded through the spatial passageway, and then a figure was blasted away!

Yang Ye!

As soon as he stopped himself over 1km away, a black shadow shot at him.

The middle aged man refused to give him a chance to catch his breath!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, and the swords in his hands started to tremble violently.

A moment later, the black shadow arrived.

At the same time, Yang Ye opened his eyes!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

In an instant, countless rays of sword energy and sword intent appeared around Yang Ye.

The Sword Domain Sphere!

Meanwhile, the black shadow didn’t stop, and just a moment later, a hand slammed against Yang Ye’s Sword Domain Sphere.

Boom!

Space shook violently and warped. But just a moment later, the space in the surroundings returned to normal, and Yang Ye was over 1km away.

Suppression by absolute strength!

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth. The middle aged man before him was extremely strong. According to his estimations, he was probably just slightly inferior to the clone of the strongest form of Destiny!

It was a terrifying thought!

It was undeniable that all four forms of Destiny, especially their strongest form, had far surpassed many experts in the Three Dimensional Universe!

And if they merged into one, they would be even more terrifying!

The middle aged man looked down at his right hand. There were many bloody cuts on it. Besides that, many remnants of sword energy were raging on his body!

He fell silent for an instant, and then he shook his right hand slightly. The sword energy around him instantly vanished without a trace.

He glanced coldly at Yang Ye, “You’re actually able to injure me!”

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath. A ray of light instantly arrived before the middle aged man.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man unfurled his palm and forcibly stopped Yang Ye’s sword. However, the powerful force carried within the sword instantly pushed the middle aged man backward repeatedly!

The middle aged man was about to counterattack when a few flying swords suddenly appeared around him!

The five element swords!

They were like five copies of Yang Ye, and they shot toward the middle aged man’s weak points!

The middle aged man frowned slightly. He stopped fighting Yang Ye in close quarters, and he created over 1km in distance between himself and Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was just about to attack again when the middle aged man suddenly closed his eyes slowly, and then he clenched his fists and raised his right leg.

Hiss!

In an instant, the middle aged man’s body split apart, and then around ten afterimages shot at Yang Ye from different directions!

At this moment, Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically!

He didn’t give it too much thought and just swung his swords!

Dual Domain Swords!

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

However, a string of muffled explosions resounded, and Yang Ye was pushed at least 300m back with every one of them!

In just a short while, Yang Ye had been pushed back by around 3km!

A breath of time later, everything calmed down.

The middle aged man had returned to where he was. He glanced at Yang Ye with a wisp of ridicule on the corner of his mouth, “So you’re wearing an armor that’s a Super Divine Treasure!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and alleviated the terrible discomfort her felt.

At that instant just now, he may have been completely suppressed if he hadn’t used the armor!

However, even with the armor, the armor was severely damaged now. Simply speaking, he couldn’t use it to get out of trouble again!

Yang Ye looked up at the middle aged man while the latter walked slowly in his direction, “A full set of divine treasures. Unfortunately, they are all external sources of strength that mean nothing!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “What the fuck are you talking about? You’re god knows how many years older than me, yet I can’t even use some treasures? If you’re that amazing, why don’t you suppress your cultivation and fight me?”

The middle aged man shook his head, “I’m not here to spar with you. I have other things to do once I’m done with you. Of course, I have to admit that I overlooked your age just now. It’s absolutely extraordinary that you possess such strength at your age. However, your path ends here!”

He waved his right hand.

Boom!

A wave of powerful aura swept out from him.

In an instant, the middle aged man’s aura rose rapidly. It couldn’t be compared to his previous aura! It was completely different!

If his aura was just slightly weaker to the stronger form of Destiny’s clone, then he wasn’t any weaker to her clone now.

Obviously, he hadn’t used his full strength earlier!

Now, he didn’t want to waste more time!

Yang Ye glanced at the dual swords in his grasp, and then Snowy appeared before him. Yang Ye rubbed her head, and she cracked a smile before taking the swords and pushing them together.

Just like that, they were merged into one!

Once they were merged, Snowy hurried back into the Primordial Pagoda, and then she frowned as she watched Yang Ye.

Outside the pagoda, Yang Ye glanced at the sword in his grasp. At this moment, he could clearly sense that it was slightly different now!

Meanwhile, the middle aged man suddenly vanished on the spot!

A wave of monstrous aura surged through the spatial passageway!

Boom!

The spatial passageway shook violently like an earthquake was surging through it!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, and his sword shook violently in his grasp.

Striking last to subdue the enemy!

The middle aged man grew closer and closer to Yang Ye, and a short while later, he drew his sword!

The middle aged man swung his fist too!

At this moment, there was no technique involved! It was a head-on collision!

Because the middle aged man’s strength covered the entire area around Yang Ye, and his cultivation and strength far surpassed Yang Ye, so it could be said that he was just using overwhelming strength to crush Yang Ye!

Yang Ye had no other choice but to go head-on against the middle aged man. If he retreated, his aura would suffer a blow from that, and then he would fall into a hopeless situation. Moreover, the spatial wall was right behind him, so he had nowhere to retreat!

The strength contained in this attack of Yang Ye’s was much, much stronger than his last attack!

His swords were merged now. These swords already surpassed Super Divine Treasures on their own, so now that they were merged as one, the strength it possessed wasn’t just a simple one plus one.

Moreover, Yang Ye was using his dual Domains and dual intents!

A moment later, the middle aged man’s fist slammed against the tip of Yang Ye’s sword.

Yang Ye’s sword shook violently, but the sword stabbed into the middle aged man’s arm, and it just continued forward all the way!

A vicious glow flashed through the middle aged man’s eyes. He didn’t retreat and continued his charge. He allowed the sword to pierce through his body, but his fist slammed against Yang Ye’s chest!

Bang!

The armor Yang Ye wore instantly collapsed, and he was blasted away. Mouthfuls of blood sprayed from Yang Ye as he flew through the air! In the end, he slammed against the spatial wall behind him.

Boom!

Yang Ye fell on his back, but it only took a moment for him to be on his feet again.

His stomach had sunken in from the impact!

If the armor hadn’t stopped some of the impact, that punch would have gone through his body!

It could be said that the armor had saved his life!

The middle aged man glanced at his pierced right arm, and then he just cut it off!

Because the Past Life Energy within Yang Ye’s sword remained in that arm of his, and it was madly devouring him. If he didn’t give up that arm, he may even lose his life!

The middle aged man looked up at Yang Ye, “I almost made a mistake.”

As soon as he finished speaking, his right arm started growing rapidly!

An invisible wave of pressure appeared out of thin air above Yang Ye!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly while holding tight to the sword in his right hand. His body gradually started to tremble, and his hair slowly turned red, bit by bit.

The Sword Dao of Hatred, or to put it in simpler terms, the Demonic Sword Dao.

It was actually part of the Devil Path!

Right when Yang Ye was about to full enter that state…

“I’m here!” A voice suddenly resounded in Yang Ye’s ears.
