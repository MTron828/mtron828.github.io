Chapter 2131 – Nether!

On the screen, a huge black cloud suddenly appeared in the calm skies of the Confucianist Dimension, and then a woman walked out slowly from within.

Yang Ye had seen this woman in the past!

She was none other than Shao Siyou whom he’d met when leaving the lower universe!

Shao Siyou!

The master of Nether Pavilion!

That was the reason for Yang Ye’s shock! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The Confucianist Path’s destruction was actually linked to her!

Yang Ye suppressed the shock within him and continued watching. After Shao Siyou appeared there, countless experts shot up into the sky toward her.

Suddenly, the scene before him stopped.

The screen of light vanished.

Ding Shaoyao suddenly asked, “You recognize her?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’ve met her once. She’s from the lower universe, and she once established an organization called the Nether Pavilion. I’m friends with the members of her Nether Pavilion. I didn’t expect this incident to be linked to her!”

“The Nether Pavilion!” Ding Shaoyao frowned slightly. She fell silent for a moment, and then she waved her right hand. A moment later, a scroll appeared before her. It was quite old and tattered, and it was even missing a few edges.

“An ancient scroll!” Ding Shaoyao continued, “Recorded within it is some history from before my god race’s time.”

She opened it, and a short while passed before she frowned slightly.

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

She passed the scroll to him, “Have a look!”

Yang Ye opened it, and it didn’t take long for him to frown. On the scroll were the words—Nether Pavilion, ancient sect…

That’s all there was there as the rest wasn’t there.

“It’s not an ordinary organization!” Ding Shaoyao spoke abruptly, “It’s interesting that they existed before my god race.”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “How much does your god race know about the history before your time?”

Ding Shaoyao shook her head slightly, “We don’t know much. That part of history is a little blank. The reason we have some information is because Patriarch Shi Tian used supreme divine abilities and the precious treasure of my god race, the Nirvana Mirror, to explore the past as a person from the future. However, he didn’t gain much.”

Yang Ye nodded, “No matter what, both you and Zhi’er should be careful. The situation in the large universe has grown even more complicated. Especially for your god race. Not only are the other races targeting you, the other three paths are doing the same. Just the slightest mistake may bring annihilation!”

“Of course!” Ding Shaoyao smiled, “We won’t be careless, and we’re even going to keep a low profile now because we have some things to do.”

Yang Ye asked, “What about once you’re done?”

Ding Shaoyao smiled, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “No matter what, be careful. I have some other things to attend to, so farewell!”

Yang Ye turned around and left.

Once Yang Ye left, Zhi’er appeared by Ding Shaoyao’s side.

Ding Shaoyao glanced at her, “Is everything prepared?”

Zhi’er nodded slightly, “At a moment’s notice.” She gazed at the direction Yang Ye had left toward, “I can see that he has a relationship with the Nether Pavilion.”

Ding Shaoyao replied, “It’s fine. We don’t have any conflict with them either. Moreover, everything is unpredictable right now in this current state of things. Besides that, that person has shown herself. Don’t forget that her unique network of relationships and abilities are what we should really fear.”

Zhi’er replied, “Is even the Evil Yin Sprite unable to fight her?”

Ding Shaoyao shook her head slightly, “We can’t entrust our hopes to someone else. All those years ago, our god race placed our hopes in someone else, and that was the cause of the horrible fate we suffered. This time, we can’t make the same mistake.”

Zhi’er nodded, “True. Alright, let’s go!”

A moment later, both of them left.

…

Once he left God Battlefield, Yang Ye shot toward the Human Dimension on his sword. Since he’d given the Confucianist Progenitor his word, he had to keep it. Moreover, the old man had given him that strand of scholarly energy, and it was extremely helpful to him. Even now, he could sense that his body was soundlessly undergoing some sort of change, and it was definitely a good thing for him right now.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to get to the Human Dimension.

Through Yang Lianshuang, he found out where Nature Sacred Grounds was. Based on his current strength, unless a progenitor acted against him, ordinary Sages couldn’t stop him at all.

Yang Ye arrived at a mountain range. It was a mountain range at the southernmost edge of the Human Dimension, and it was a boundless mountain range. Nature Sacred Ground was situated within the mountain range. Now, Yang Ye had a problem. How to find Shuya!

Go inside openly?

Based on the current situation, if he did that, then they may immediately notify the Human Dimension. After all, the Human Dimension and the other races had joined forces, and he would definitely be unable to resist their joint forces.

So, Yang Ye decided to sneak in.

Yang Ye arrived at the foot of the mountain, and the towering mountain before him was like a towering sword. It was Nature Mountain. Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and he noticed divine senses sweeping the area incessantly.

Yang Ye avoided them and entered the mountain.

At the top of the mountain, there was a courtyard here. Yang Ye snuck into it. Once he entered it, he noticed a statue here. It was the statue of the Confucianist Progenitor. Obviously, Nature Sacred Grounds was linked to the Confucianist Progenitor.

Once he entered the courtyard, Yang Ye was about to find someone to ask about Shuya’s whereabouts when a middle aged man suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

The middle aged man asked, “Who are you?”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, I underestimated them a little. None of these ancient powers are ordinary!

Yang Ye undid his black robe.

“It’s you!” The middle aged man frowned. He naturally recognized Yang Ye. After all, did anyone in the Human Dimension not recognize him? Perhaps it was a little exaggerated to say that, but it was a fact. Yang Ye was really renowned in the human race. However, it wasn’t a good reputation that he had, it was a bad one.

Traitor of the human race!

That was Yang Ye’s crime!

Yang Ye said, “I’m not here to cause trouble.”

The middle aged man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “That should be true. Because my Nature Sacred Ground hasn’t done anything to offend you.”

Nature Sacred Ground had investigated Yang Ye too. While Yang Ye liked to kill, he had never taken the initiative to offend any organization. So, as far as he was concerned, Yang Ye was the type of person who wouldn’t offend unless offended.

Yang Ye said, “What’s your position here?”

“Lin Zhen.” The middle aged man continued, “The master of Nature Sacred Ground.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’m sure you’ve heard about what happened in the Confucianist Dimension, right?”

The man replied, “I have!”

Yang Ye said, “I’m here to look for someone on behalf of the Confucianist Progenitor.”

“The Confucianist Progenitor!” Lin Zhen’s eyes narrowed slightly, “He sent you here?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Lin Zhen took a deep breath and said, “Young Brother Yang, please come with me!”

Even the way he addressed Yang Ye had changed.

Yang Ye glanced at Lin Zhen and followed him.

Yang Ye followed Lin Zhen to a hall, and Lin Zhen gestured for him to sit.

Yang Ye sat on a stone chair. Meanwhile, Lin Zhen said, “The Confucianist Progenitor is an ancestor of my Lin Clan.”

The Confucianist Progenitor was an ancestor of the Lin Clan!

Yang Ye was quite surprised by this piece of information.

Lin Zhen continued, “What happened in the Confucianist Dimension was beyond anything my Lin Clan ever expected.” He shook his head, “Forget that. Since our ancestor sent you, he probably sent you here for a reason, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’m here to look for someone. His name is Shuya!”

“Shuya?” Lin Zhen frowned, “Shuya?”

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

Lin Zhen replied, “Young Brother, please wait a moment. I’ll search for him!”

As soon as he finished speaking, an old man appeared by his side. The old man nodded and left.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “I’m quite surprised!”

Lin Zhen grinned, “I know what you mean. You’re surprised about why I’m not hostile towards you!”

Yang Ye nodded.

Lin Zhen replied, “Actually, it’s because of my ancestor. My ancestor wanted our clan to stay away from these conflicts and keep a low profile. He wanted us to try our best to keep a low profile.”

Keep a low profile!

Yang Ye smiled and didn’t say anything. Because the old man had returned to Lin Zhen’s side, and there was a boy beside the old man. The boy was around eight or nine years of age.

The boy was quite timid. He glanced at Yang Ye and Lin Zhen, and then he went over to Lin Zhen and said, “P-P-Patriarch!”

He wasn’t nervous, he was stuttering a little.

Lin Zhen nodded slightly and gazed at the old man. The old man said, “Shu Ya is an orphan. His father was a young master of our clan, but… but his mother was a maidservant. That’s why he wasn’t recorded in our Lin Clan’s register.”

Lin Zhen couldn’t help but frown.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye walked over to Shu Ya. Shu Ya clearly seemed quite nervous, but he didn’t move back. Yang Ye squatted down and spoke softly, “Have you suffered a lot?”

Shu Ya hesitated for a moment and nodded.

Yang Ye asked, “Do you resent them?”

Shu Ya shook his head.

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Shu Ya hesitated for a moment and spoke softly, “Suffering can temper me, and overcoming all odds will lead to rebirth.”

Lin Zhen suddenly gazed at Shu Ya when he heard this, and there was a different light in his eyes.

Yang Ye rubbed Shu Ya’s head and said, “Do you like to read?”

“I do!”

Shu Ya nodded with certainty.

Suddenly, the old man spoke from the side, “I just found out that he does odd jobs in the library… The other young masters of our clan dislike studying and prefer practicing in combat. So, he’s practically the only one studying in the library.”
