Chapter 1685 - I’m Not A Member Of The Yang Clan Anymore!

Translator: InVader

The Divine Yin Flame!

His current strength was sufficient to endure the Divine Yin Flame’s strength. Of course, it wasn’t the Divine Yin Flame’s full strength. If it revealed its true strength while being used by Yang Ye, then even if Yang Ye had the Unyielding Body right now, he would still be burnt into ash!

Presently, he was only able to endure 40% of its strength, at most. If the Divine Yin Flame used even more of its strength, then Yang Ye’s body wouldn’t be able to endure it.

As far as Yang Ye was concerned, 40% of the Divine Yin Flame’s strength was enough!

Yang Xian’s face instantly became solemn when he saw the Divine Yin Flames.

Danger!

That was the first feeling he had when he saw the flames!

“Watch out!” Suddenly, the black robed man behind Yang Xian spoke abruptly.

Yang Xian nodded slightly and gazed at Yang Ye, “You’ve truly surprised me. That flame is no ordinary flame, right?”

Yang Ye grinned, “Why don’t you experience it for yourself?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he tapped the tip of his foot against the ground and transformed into a flaming tongue of sword energy that shot forward.

His sword energy wasn’t just sword energy now. It contained Unyielding Sword Intent, Unyielding Slaughter Intent, and the Divine Yin Flame. It could be said that the energy it contained was sufficient to obliterate the world!

Everywhere he passed, space was instantly torn open, and a very long spatial rift was left in his wake. However, it only took less than half a breath of time for the spatial rifts to be repaired by a mysterious wave of energy.

Yang Xian’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he leaped up into the air and swung the halberd down with both hands.

Both of them refused to give in!

Just like that, their weapons collided in the most direct manner.

Clang!

As soon as they collided, both Yang Ye’s flaming sword and Yang Xian’s halberd shook violently, and then Yang Xian was pushed 3km away while Yang Ye was pushed less than 300m away.

Once Yang Ye stopped himself, he immediately vanished on the spot, and a ray of flaming light flashed.

Bang!

A loud explosion rumbled through the area. Yang Xian was pushed another 3km away. As soon as he stopped himself, blood sprayed out from his mouth. However, Yang Ye was in front of him, and Yang Ye had swung his sword again.

Bang!

As soon as Yang Ye’s sword descended, the space around Yang Ye and Yang Xian collapsed in an instant, causing the surroundings to turn pitch black. However, it only took a moment for the collapsed space to be repaired, and then a figure was blasted out of the area.

It was Yang Xian’s figure.

Yang Xian flew over 3km away, and a mouthful of blood sprayed from him when he descended to the ground.

Something worth mentioning was that Yang Xian’s left arm was gone.

Yang Ye didn’t follow up with another attack, and he just looked up into the sky. At the moment that space shattered just now, he could have killed Yang Xian in an instant. However, someone instantly repaired the space here, and it caused him to be only able to take one of Yang Xian’s arms.

Actually, if no one was helping Yang Xian in secret, he wouldn’t have to use the Divine Yin Flame to deal with Yang Xian.

Because he just had to shatter space here, and he could gain control of a huge amount of dark energy and dark matter. Moreover, his unique physique could be used to its full extent when he was within a black hole. It could be said that he didn’t even have to fear True Realm experts when he had access to the combination of his unique physique, the Laws of Darkness, and his dual intents!

However, those fellows from the Yang Clan had crushed this move of his before he could even use it.

It was an unfair battle!

Yang Ye looked up at the sky for a long time, and then he suddenly smiled, “It’s fine! Let’s continue!” As soon as he finished speaking, he gazed at Yang Xian. He didn’t waste his breath and just tapped his right foot against the ground. He transformed into a ray of flaming light that vanished on the spot.

After he used the Divine Yin Flame, his sword energy was simply heaven defying. Everywhere it passed, space was instantly torn open. At this moment, space was like paper before Yang Ye’s sword.

Yang Xian’s expression changed. A wave of terrifying intent swept out from him, but his Unrivaled Intent had just emerged when it was suppressed by Yang Ye’s dual intents.

If it was one on one, then Yang Xian’s Unrivaled Intent wouldn’t be inferior to either Yang Ye’s slaughter intent or sword intent. Unfortunately, Yang Ye had two intents, and both of them carried his Unyielding Will. So, Yang Xian’s Unrivaled Intent couldn’t resist Yang Ye’s dual intents at all!

Yang Xian’s expression changed again when his Unrivaled Intent was suppressed, and then he held tightly onto the halberd with his right hand and stabbed it forward.

Clang!

As soon as they collided, the powerful force within Yang Ye’s sword blasted Yang Xian over 3km back. At this moment, Yang Xian hadn’t just been pushed back, even his entire body had cracked open from the impact.

Yang Xian glanced at his cracked body, and he realized what his weak point was.

It was his body!

His body was too weak.

His Unrivaled Strength wasn’t physical strength. So, if his Unrivaled Strength was suppressed by his opponent’s strength in battle, then… The consequence would be just like what had happened right now. He wouldn’t be able to fight back at all.

Yang Ye didn’t give Yang Xian a chance to catch his breath. Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Yang Xian when he appeared once more.

Meanwhile, the black robed man suddenly appeared before Yang Xian, and then a spear created countless spear images before descending towards Yang Ye.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then both Yang Xian and the black robed man were pushed back. As for Yang Ye, he was pushed 300m back as well.

Yang Ye glanced at his slightly numb arm, and then he looked up at the black robed man, “What? Not fighting me one on one anymore?”

The black robed man started walking in Yang Ye’s direction. Suddenly, Yang Xian said, “Brother Long Xin, be careful.”

The black robed man, Long Xin, nodded slightly. When he arrived just 30m away from Yang Ye, he flipped his palm.

Roar!

A dragon roar instantly resounded through the surroundings, and then a white spear appeared in his grasp. The spear was pure white, and there were dragons carved on it.

“Azure Dragon Roar!” Meanwhile, Lu Lige suddenly spoke solemnly, “Be careful.”

Yang Ye gazed at Lu Lige, “What is it?”

Lu Lige spoke solemnly, “Long Xin, the Azure Dragon Roar. He’d ranked at the 6th on the Milky Way Rankings, and he once killed a True Realm expert on his own. Be careful! Don’t be careless!”

He killed a True Realm expert! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly as he turned to look at Long Xin. Long Xin was a Zenith Realm expert. Killing a True Realm expert while at the Zenith Realm was sufficient to prove Long Xin’s strength.

Regardless of whether it was An Nanjing or him, or even Yang Jian and Yang Xian, all of them seemed to have never killed True Realm experts while at the Zenith Realm.

He’d experienced the gap between the Zenith Realm and the True Realm. When An Nanjing and him fought a True Realm expert that day, they’d relied on all sorts of formidable intents and treasures to barely fight that True Realm expert. But the black robed man before him could kill a True Realm expert on his own. So, Yang Ye could imagine how strong Long Xin was.

However, did he have to fear Long Xin?

Even if it was a True Realm expert that was standing in front of him, he would still dare to fight!

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Ye tapped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of flaming light that shot towards Long Xin. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Long Xin’s face was calm. When Yang Ye arrived before him, he waved his spear about, and then dragon roars resounded incessantly from his spear. At the same time, countless rays of sword energy formed a huge golden ball of light that enveloped him.

As soon as they collided, both exploded apart, and then countless waves of fire and golden light swept out from the point of collision. Both of them were blasted over 3km away by the aftershock.

“Sky Crusher!” Suddenly, Long Xin’s voice resounded, and then he shot forward like a bolt of lightning with his spear in hand. An ethereal white dragon head flickered on the tip of the spear, and everywhere it passed, the violent wave of energy from before was torn apart. Moreover, the space in an area of almost 30km started rippling like boiling water. It rippled violently, and it was an absolutely shocking sight!

A cold glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes as he sheathed his sword, and then he swiftly drew it and swung it forward!

Heavenrends enhanced by the Divine Yin Flame couldn’t be compared to their past might.

Crack!

The space in the surroundings instantly cracked apart. However, it was instantly repaired by a strand of mysterious energy.

Just like that, Yang Ye’s sword slammed against Long Xin’s spear which had an ethereal dragon head on it.

Boom!

As soon as they collided, space collapsed. However, it was instantly repaired before anyone could even react to it. But as soon as it was repaired, it collapsed once more. Because the force of their collision was truly too powerful!

At the instant space collapsed, Yang Ye seized the opportunity to transform into a ray of light that vanished on the spot. At the same time, a dragon roar resounded abruptly from within the black expanse of space.

Bang!

In an instant, another rumbling explosion resounded.

It didn’t take long for space to return to normal.

At this moment, both Yang Ye and Long Xin had been pushed back 3km each.

Long Xin was supporting himself up on one knee, and his head was lowered. His spear was in front of him, and he was holding tightly onto it. However, the tip of the spear was gone, and there was a pool of blood below his feet. It was a huge pool of blood, and it covered his feet in blood.

Yang Xian’s eyes closed slowly when he witnessed this scene, “Even though we’re not related by blood, we were close as brothers. I shouldn’t have tried to fight to be the successor. I shouldn’t have come…” It didn’t take long for two streams of tears to seep out of Yang Xian’s eyes.

Because Long Xin’s body had no signs of life.

Yang Ye wasn’t completely whole either. There was a broken tip of a spear stuck in his left shoulder. It was the tip of Long Xin’s spear. At this moment, Yang Ye’s blood was ceaselessly seeping out along the spear tip.

Suddenly, Yang Xian walked over to Long Xin’s side. He gazed at Long Xin’s corpse for a long time, and then he suddenly looked up at the sky, “I, Yang Xian, withdraw from the fight for succession. From this day forward, I’m no longer a member of the Yang Clan.”

A ray of brilliant light suddenly flashed out from the sky.

Thud!

An arrow stabbed into Yang Xian’s chest, and his figure instantly stiffened on the spot.
