Chapter 1674 - The Unyielding Physique!

Translator: InVader

The fight he had with Yang Ru allowed him to realize that not a single young master of the Yang Clan was ordinary.

Not to mention anything else, just Yang Ru was someone that he was absolutely not confident in his ability to defeat!

But Yang Ru was absolutely not the only one in the Yang Clan who wanted to kill him. Besides that mysterious expert…

That mysterious expert!

Yang Ye had a solemn expression on his face when he thought about that mysterious expert.

He’d known that the mysterious expert was extraordinarily strong, but he’d still underestimated that person. Yang Lu had been at a disadvantage in both his collisions with that mysterious black shadow, and Gu Xiu hadn’t even been able to fight back before being killed!

It was obvious how strong that mysterious expert was!

Moreover, he’d been swept into the vortex that was the Yang Clan’s fight for succession. There were some things in this world where others wouldn’t let you live if you refused to fight for it, and they would never let you live if you refused to fight for it. For example, if Yang Ru or Yang Xing became the successor, then they would definitely not let him live!

So, he wouldn’t think about withdrawing from this vortex. Because if he chose to withdraw now, he would definitely be killed. After all, there definitely were True Realm experts amongst his father’s enemies. Moreover, there may be a few of them!

He couldn’t withdraw!

Meanwhile, An Nanjing suddenly said, “I may have to enter into closed door cultivation for a while.”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “What is it?”

An Nanjing replied, “I have to comprehend some things.” She paused for a moment and continued, “I’ll definitely help when the competition begins!”

Yang Ye grinned and said, “Do you know… I feel that you’re the most terrifying.”

Since the time they met on Profounder Continent, An Nanjing’s strength had never been weaker than his, but he had the Primordial Pagoda, and she didn’t.

An Nanjing shook her head slightly, “Your heart is bound by too much. Even though they’ve become motivation for you to become strong, they are also invisible shackles for you. The reason the Unfettered One’s attainments in the Sword Dao are so superior is that his heart isn’t bound by anything. He pursues the extremes of the Sword Dao, and he has truly accomplished having only the sword in his heart!”

She walked slowly over to Yang Ye and continued, “But you’re different. There are emotions in your heart, and you can’t keep only the sword in it. You can’t pursue the extremes of the Sword Dao. So, your attainments aren’t as great as his. However, that’s exactly why I’m with you!”

Yang Ye gazed at her. Meanwhile, she added, “The Unfettered One pursues strength and the extremes of the Sword Dao; you pursue protection, the ability to protect your loved ones. Even though it makes you weaker than the Unfettered One, that’s the Yang Ye that I know. That Yang Ye who dares to fight the world for those he loves.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Let’s not talk about this. Go on and cultivate!”

An Nanjing nodded slightly. She was about to leave when Yang Ye suddenly said, “Wait!”

He flipped his right palm and a black shield appeared in his grasp. It was the Zenith Rank shield that he’d taken from that expert of the Ku Clan.

Yang Ye passed it to her and said, “This is for you.”

She glanced at the shield and shook her head, “I won’t try to defend myself like that!” As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Ye shook his head and put the shield away. He refused to do as she did. It was extremely useful at the critical moment. Especially because the shield relied on dark matter and dark energy, so it would definitely be much stronger in his hands!

After he put the shield away, Yang Ye looked up at the room on the 4th level.

The room was pitch black, and he couldn’t see anything within it.

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment, and then he started walking slowly towards the entrance. However, when he arrived just 3m away from the entrance, a wave of terrifying energy swept out in his direction.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He tapped his right foot against the ground while Returnal Rank sword intent instantly surged out from within him. In next to no time, his sword intent formed an invisible sword that shot forward.

His sword intent had just come into contact with the energy when a wave of terrifying energy swept out from the point of collision. In an instant, the space here started to ripple while Yang Ye’s sword intent started to crack apart. Moreover, the mysterious energy from within the room even pushed him back repeatedly.

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly at the sight of this, and he took another step forward. At the same time, a wave of blood red light swept out from him.

Zenith Rank slaughter intent!

As soon as it swept out, the mysterious energy before him was forced to stop.

Just like that, the three types of energies were in confrontation.

Yang Ye was about to enter, but another wave of terrifying energy surged out of the room. Once this energy appeared, Yang Ye’s slaughter intent and sword intent was blasted apart. Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically, and he was about to retreat, but it was too late.

The energy pressed down upon him.

At the moment it slammed against his body, Yang Ye’s expression had changed drastically again. This time, he felt like a million towering mountains were pressing down on him. He’d been caught off guard, so his body instantly bent down. It wasn’t just his upper body that had bent down, he’d almost fallen to his knees as well. Fortunately, he forcefully supported himself up and stopped himself from kneeling!

Bang!

Meanwhile, his slaughter intent and sword intent surged out from within him. However, regardless of whether it was his slaughter intent or sword intent, they were instantly obliterated upon emerging from his body.

Yang Ye’s expression changed again when he noticed this. He hadn’t expected the mysterious energy to actually be so strong. Suddenly, another wave of energy surged out from behind the doors, and it slammed against his body.

Crack!

In an instant, Yang Ye felt like his waist was on the verge of breaking. Even his legs felt like they were going to break.

The energy grew stronger and stronger, and it made Yang Ye’s legs bend more and more. He was on the verge of kneeling on the ground.

Kneel?

A vicious glow flashed through his eyes. In his lifetime, he refused to kneel to the heavens or the earth, and he would only kneel to his mother. No one else could make him kneel!

Hold on!

At this moment, regardless of whether it was his profound energy, slaughter intent, or sword intent, they couldn’t help him.

Willpower!

He could only rely on his willpower to hold on by force!

Yang Ye’s face gradually started to warp. That wasn’t all, cold sweat had even started to flow down like a waterfall. Besides that, his waist was bending further, and he was almost like the shape of a bow.

Besides that, his knees were just a few centimeters away from the ground.

Yang Ye’s knees gradually descended further. Right when they were about to touch the ground, a wisp of ruthlessness flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, and then he roared with fury as he pressed his hands against the ground, causing the veins throughout his arms to bulge up.

Cracking suddenly started to resound throughout his body.

After that, his legs gradually became straight. Even though it was a very slow process, they were straightening slowly.

At this moment, he seemed to be in a very strange posture. Moreover, his eyes were blood red.

Crack!

A while later, the sound of a bone breaking resounded. Once that sound resounded, numerous bones started to break, one after the other. At this moment, Yang Ye’s waist bent down completely.

The bones throughout his waist had been broken!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s legs had cracked open as well!

Yang Ye stared at the room ahead, and his eyes were bloodshot. He gritted his teeth while blood ceaselessly seeped out from the corner of his mouth.

Yield?

So long as he gave up or yielded, he could avoid such suffering. However, how could Yang Ye possibly yield?

He’d lost and cried in this lifetime, but he’d never backed down!

Not in the past, and not now!

His waist could break and so could his legs, but he couldn’t back down!

As time slowly trickled by, Yang Ye’s legs cracked open more and more, and blood ceaselessly seeped out from them.

Crack!

Suddenly, around fifteen minutes later, a clear and resounding crack arose, and then Yang Ye’s legs cracked open. He instantly fell towards the ground. However, he didn’t allow himself to fall flat on the ground and had used his hands to hold himself up.

However, the energy still didn’t vanish, and it was still pressing down on him.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye’s palms to start cracking open, and then blood flowed along his hands and dyed the ground red.

Yang Ye supported himself with his palms and looked up at the door. There was a ferocious smile on his face as he said, “You can break my waist, my legs, and my hands, but you can’t break my will and heart. I, Yang Ye, will never yield!”

Bang!

Another wave of energy appeared from behind the door, and it instantly slammed down onto Yang Ye.

Crack!

The sound of bones breaking resounded, and then Yang Ye’s hands broke. However, he still didn’t allow himself to fall flat on the ground because he’d used his elbows to hold himself up.

Yang Ye looked up at the door, and his eyes were filled with ferocity, “Come on! Bring it on!”

Bang!

Suddenly, another wave of terrifying energy surged out, and it pressed down upon Yang Ye.

Crack!

The sound of bones breaking resounded again, and his arms instantly broke. However, Yang Ye still didn’t fall flat on the ground because he used his head to support himself up.

Bang!

The ground cracked open!

Around fifteen minutes passed just like that, and then Yang Ye suddenly felt his entire body feel light. After that, another wave of terrifying energy surged out from behind the door.

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched when he noticed this. It’s really trying to kill me!

Suddenly, the energy surged into his body, and Yang Ye’s body shook.

What’s going on? Yang Ye was quite bewildered.

Meanwhile, numerous waves of energy surged out from behind the door. It surged out like a torrent and surged into Yang Ye’s body.

“An unyielding will, an unyielding soul, unyielding bones, and an unyielding heart.” Suddenly, a voice resounded, “Congratulations, you’ve obtained the Unyielding Physique.”
