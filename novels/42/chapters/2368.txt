Chapter 2369 – She’s Invincible!

Snowy gazed at the headless man while holding tightly to the Primordial Axe of Creation behind her.

She’d decided that if negotiations broke down, she would swing the axe!

The headless man ignored the pile of Eternal Immortal Crystals and stretched out his hand at Snowy instead. No one knew what he was trying to convey.

Snowy blinked, hesitated for a moment, and then withdrew more crystals and pushed it toward him.

The headless man stood there for quite some time. In the end, he turned around and left.

Snowy seemed visibly relieved from this, and then she went over to Yang Ye. She was stunned when she saw Yang Ye, and she immediately tossed the axe away and started crying while hugging him.

Countless strands of spirit energy seeped out of her eyes.

Yang Ye rubbed her little head and spoke softly, “I-I’m fine, don’t cry!”

Snowy didn’t listen to him and just kept rubbing her head against his chest.

Yang Ye felt quite helpless toward this.

Meanwhile, Nanli Meng went over to his side, glanced at Snowy, and then gazed at Yang Ye, “How do you feel?”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “I’ll survive!”

Nanli Meng chuckled, “As expected of Primordial Violet Energy, such heavy injuries have actually been healed to such an extent in just this short amount of time!”

Yang Ye ignored her and closed his eyes.

Nanli Meng glanced at the surroundings and said, “Based on my estimations, your full strength should possess the strength to break the limits of a world. As for that headless man, his cultivation is at the Limitbreaker Realm, at the very least, it is now. However, he possesses the strength of two worlds. There’s a difference in strength even amongst Limitbreaker Realm experts.”

Yang Ye asked, “How are they divided?”

Nanli Meng smiled, “Limitbreaker Realm experts possess the strength of a world, or to be more precise, they possess the strength to destroy a world. The strength of two worlds represents possessing the strength to destroy two worlds. Simply speaking, the Limitbreaker Realm is divided into five smaller realms, One World, Two World, Three World, Four World, and Five World. After the Five World Realm, it’s a whole different world. There should be no experts above the Five World Realm in Eternal Border. These experts are either in the Eternal Dimension or dead in the Eternal River. Because attaining such strength represents that their lifespan is almost fully exhausted.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Can Limitbreaker Realm experts really destroy a world?”

“Of course not!” Nanli Meng smiled, “Actually, it's exaggerated. For example, if any Limitbreaker Realm expert could destroy Eternal Border, then wouldn’t it be too weak? The Limitbreaker Realm represents the ability to truly destroy the space of this world. For example, if you use your full strength, you can transform this entire area into a void without any matter, right?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded.

Nanli Meng nodded slightly, “That’s true destruction, destruction that makes a place unable to repair itself. As for the difference in strength amongst Limitbreaker Realm experts, let me make a comparison. A One World Realm expert can instantly destroy everything in an area of 500km here, and a Two World Realm expert would be able to destroy everything in 1,500km. As for Three World Realm experts, they are even more terrifying.”

She glanced at Yang Ye and continued, “The Freedom Sect, Creation Sect, Immortality Sect, and Longevity Sect have Limitbreaker Realm experts, and they are being managed by One World Realm experts. As for the experts of their sects, the Two World Realm experts, they’ve gone to the Eternal River. Only Two World Realm experts have the right to enter the Eternal River while One World Realm experts don’t!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time before he gazed at her, “How strong was Tian Xiu?”

Nanli Meng fell silent.

Yang Ye gazed at her. He knew that she knew a lot.

A long time passed before she gazed at Yang Ye, “You really want to know?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Please!”

She replied softly, “Her true strength surpasses the Two World Realm. Perhaps she’s at the Three World Realm or even higher…”

She shook her head at this point, “Perhaps you’re unaware but she has always been suppressing her cultivation!”

Suppressing her cultivation!

Yang Ye slowly clenched his fists, “Why?”

She laughed bitterly, “Because she’s really very strong.”

Yang Ye replied, “I don’t understand!”

Nanli Meng said, “Metal must be tempered thousands of times, and only then can it be made into a sharp sword. Tell me, if a sword couldn’t endure the pain and loneliness, and it left the furnace in advance, then what would happen?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Nanli Meng continued, “She’s using her body as a furnace to make herself into a peerless sword. She’s like a volcano, the longer it accumulates and remains suppressed, the more terrifying it would be when it erupts. Actually, I investigated her intentionally, and if it wasn’t because of the void spirit race, she would have been renowned a long time ago. She was actually very well-known all those years ago too. Unfortunately, she vanished in the end, causing her to be gradually forgotten by the experts of all the worlds, including Eternal Border.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “The patriarch of the undying race is amazing as well. Just like her, he was tied down by his own race. Otherwise…”

Yang Ye suddenly started laughing.

As he laughed and laughed, two rows of tears gradually flowed down his face.

She was alive!

Based on what Nanli Meng told him, he knew that Tian Xiu was alive!

The invincible Tian Xiu was alive!

Nanli Meng gazed at Yang Ye who was lying on the ground and said, “She is alive, but she has left Eternal Border. She can deal with those powers of Eternal Border for you, but she won’t. Do you know why?”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “To temper me?”

“Not at all!” Nanli Meng walked over to Yang Ye, “She thinks very highly of you, very, very highly. However, she’ll go further and further in the future. She’ll go very far, and she hopes that you exist on her future path. The path of the strong is always one that is threaded alone. It isn’t one that someone clears out for you. You must thread your own path. She won’t clear it out for you. She detonated Netherworld Destiny to tell you that you must walk on your own path, and you must rely on yourself for everything. Backing will die and fall. Understand?”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly. In his mind, it was the figure of that petite little girl, that petite little girl who looked down upon the world!

Meanwhile, Snowy—who was lying on Yang Ye’s chest—suddenly rubbed her eyes and gazed at Nanli Meng, and then she pointed at herself. Obviously, she was asking if Tian Xiu had anything to say to her.

Nanli Meng glanced at Snowy and said, “In my records, there are 10 formidable physiques, and anyone who possesses one of them will become an extraordinary overlord who goes down in history. Now, I have to add a new one. Do you know what it is?”

Snowy blinked. Obviously, she was asking what it was.

Nanli Meng gazed at Snowy and spoke seriously, “The Invincible Cute Body! It’s more special than any other physique. She doesn’t need to fight because countless experts would be willing to fight for her. All things, people, Sprites, and practically everything else must give her some face. She’s the only existence in the world who does not fear tribulations of destiny because they do not work on her, and she's the only existence who does not fear karma because there’s only good karma for her. In any case, she’s absolutely invincible!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Snowy blinked and gazed at Yang Ye. She didn’t quite understand Nanli Meng.

Yang Ye rubbed her little head, “In any case, you’re really amazing.”

Snowy cracked a smile, and then she rubbed her head against Yang Ye’s chin.

Nanli Meng shook her head and sighed, “The Sprite Progenitor shouldn’t be like this!”

Yang Ye suddenly gazed at her, “What are those ten great physiques you spoke of?”

She replied, “You know your lover, An Nanjing?”

Yang Ye nodded, “What about her?”

Nanli Meng replied, “She possesses one of them, the Martial God Physique. In theory, she’s the most terrifying!”

An Nanjing!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and asked, “Do you know where she is? I’ll give you a Divine Treasure in exchange!”

She shook her head, “I would like to know. Unfortunately, no one knows where she is right now. I paid a good amount of money to deduce her whereabouts, but do you know what happened? That Two World Realm expert almost died from the backlash!”

“What do you mean?” Yang Ye frowned.

She explained, “I mean she’s being concealed from the heavens, and the person doing that is very, very strong. Extremely strong.”

Yang Ye’s frown deepened.

“You don’t have to worry about her!” Nanli Meng spoke indifferently, “Based on her natural talent, experts will be fighting over her like she’s a treasure no matter where she goes. You’re better off worrying about yourself.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment, and it didn’t take long for him to come to an understanding. Just as she’d said, instead of worrying about An Nanjing, he should be worried about himself. An Nanjing had both strength and luck that were definitely better than him. Moreover, she would be even better off while not by his side.

Staying with him came with a huge pile of trouble!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at Nanli Meng, “One last question. What physique do I possess? Or perhaps is my physique part of those ten physiques?”

She glanced at him, “No, but if there are ten lousiest physiques, then you will definitely be at the top. Right, the Misfortune Physique. Misfortune and death follows wherever you go!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

A short while later, Yang Ye returned to the Primordial Pagoda to heal. He was only fully healed after staying in the Primordial Pagoda for a few days, but only a few hours had passed in the world outside.

They continued forward.

Yang Ye and Nanli Feng went through the mountains. Behind them was a gorge that stretched for over 300m wide and was bottomless. When they looked up, all they could see was a corner of the sky.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

They hadn’t gone far when Yang Ye suddenly stopped, and Nanli Meng gazed at him with bewilderment, “What is it?”

Yang Ye didn’t answer her. He looked ahead, and there was an old man in linen clothes there. The old man had a small bamboo chest on his back and a bamboo in his right hand. At the top of the bamboo was a white piece of cloth, and on the cloth was two pitch black characters—“公平”.

Fairness!

The old man walked swiftly in Yang Ye and Nanli Meng’s direction, and he muttered as he walked, “Strange, how strange. Such an expert in the Sword Dao appeared in a tiny place like Eternal Border. It shouldn’t be, it shouldn’t…”

It didn’t take long for him to arrive before Yang Ye and Nanli Meng. Right when he was about to pass by, the old man stopped abruptly and gazed at Yang Ye, “You can see me?”

Meanwhile, Snowy gazed at the bamboo chest the old man carried, and her eyes were spinning about. No one knew what she was thinking.

However, a chill ran down Yang Ye’s spine!
