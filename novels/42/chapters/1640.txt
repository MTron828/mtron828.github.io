Chapter 1641 - Are You Filled With Despair?

Translator: InVader

Bang!

A wave of powerful intent swept out from within Yang Ye, and it blasted Yang Xuan backwards. However, Yang Xuan immediately slammed her fist forward, and it dispersed Yang Ye’s intent.

Meanwhile, a ray of light arrived before Yang Xuan.

The Sword of Rebirth!

Yang Xuan’s eyelids twitched. She didn’t dare act carelessly in the slightest. She immediately circulated her profound energy while pressing her palms together to form a strange seal, and then she pushed them forward.

Bang!

An invisible wave of energy rippled from the space in front of her, and it didn’t take long for the two waves of powerful energy to slam against each other.

Boom!

An explosion resounded from Immortal Phoenix Pavilion, and it instantly collapsed the entire underground cultivation room. After that, the entire pavilion started to shake like there was an earthquake!

Om!

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded from within the pavilion, and then a ray of light shot up into the air from beneath the ground. However, it only took an instant for a ray of red light to follow it and obstruct the first ray of light.

The rays of light dispersed to reveal Yang Ye and Yang Xuan’s figures.

Yang Xuan gazed coldly at Yang Ye, “Do you know how strong Yang Xu is? His strength is even superior to Gu Xiu and Qian Hu. Besides that, he has over 20 Zenith Realm experts under his command. You’ll only be giving your life away.”

Yang Ye closed his eyes, “Yang Xuan, I won’t force you to help me. After all, you don’t owe me anything. But if you try to stop me…” He suddenly opened his eyes, “Trust me, I’ll take your head!”

Yang Xuan gazed at him for a long time before she said, “I’m your auntie!”

Yang Ye replied with a question, “Have you ever treated me as your nephew?”

Yang Xuan was about to speak when Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t want to talk nonsense with you. I’ll say it one last time, don’t stop me!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he tapped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

Once Yang Ye left, Gu Xiu and Qian Hu appeared here.

Qian Hu asked, “Will things get out of hand?”

Gu Xiu replied, “Isn’t that perfect? Master wants things to get out of control. Master wants Yang Ye to cause trouble and the other young masters to die. If it wasn’t for that, why would we have exposed his identity to Yang Yan’s side?”

Qian Hu shook her head, “That fellow isn’t someone easy to deal with. I’m afraid that he’ll spoil our plans.”

“He doesn’t have that ability!” Gu Xiu said, “Master’s strength far surpasses his, and Master’s natural talent far surpasses his too. No matter how monstrous he is, he can’t compare to Master, right?”

Qian Hu nodded, “It’s a pity that Master is…” She shook her head and didn’t finish.

Gu Xiu shook his head, “Let’s go watch. Let’s see what his true combat strength is like.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he shot off towards the distance.

Meanwhile, Qian Hu suddenly gazed at Yang Xuan who’d been silent until now, “Phoenix Commander, I heard that you used to be very close to your brother.”

Yang Xuan glanced at Qian Hu and spoke indifferently, “If my nephew’s natural talent and potential are superior to Master, then I would choose him, of course. Unfortunately, he isn’t. In the Yang Clan, the strong survive, and the weak are eliminated. Right?”

Qian Hu nodded, “That’s very reasonable.” Her figure vanished into the sky once she finished speaking.

Yang Xuan remained silent on the spot for a long time, and then she vanished on the spot as well.

…

Outside Phecda City.

At the center of the city gates, a woman was hung there by a pitch black rope. Her figure was ethereal, her eyes closed tightly, and her head drooping down. It seemed like she was in deep sleep.

It was Little Sky.

There was a man in an embroidered robe seated cross-legged before the entrance to the city, and he seemed to be just over 20 years of age.

It was the Yang Clan’s second young master, Yang Yan!

Perhaps they knew that someone big was about to happen, numerous powerful auras were hidden all around Phecda City.

Suddenly, Yang Yan opened his eyes and looked up at the sky. A ray of light flashed by and descended to the ground, and then Yang Ye’s figure appeared there.

As soon as Yang Ye arrived, Little Sky suddenly opened her eyes and gazed at Yang Ye. Meanwhile, Yang Ye was looking at her too.

A moment after their eyes met, Little Sky revealed a weak smile on her pale face, “Leave right now, alright?”

A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “Do you know what’s the most painful thing for a man? It’s being helpless when his friends and women need him the most. Watching you being captured was the most painful moment for me.”

Little Sky shook her head, “Fool! Do you realize that they drew you out here on purpose? You’ll die if you don’t leave! Leave now, alright…”

Suddenly, a whip struck Little Sky.

Hiss!

Sparks flew from her body while an expression of extreme pain covered her face.

“A Soul Whip!” Yang Yan stood up and cracked the whip in his hand. He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “It’s specially made for whipping souls. It causes real damage to the soul. Have you experienced pain that comes from the depths of your soul? If you haven’t, I’ll let you experience it later…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

The Sword of Rebirth!

A ray of light flashed forward.

Bang!

However, an explosion resounded, and the ray of light dispersed while Yang Ye’s figure was blasted over 6km away.

Meanwhile, a black robed old man appeared in front of Yang Yan.

It was Yang Xu!

At the same time, ten old men appeared behind Yang Xu and Yang Yan.

All of them were Zenith Realm experts!

Yang Xu glanced coldly at Yang Ye, “Don’t worry, I won’t let you die that quickly. Because just your life isn’t enough to pay for my granddaughter and son’s life. I heard you have wives in a low level world far away from here. Don’t worry, I’ll go there myself and capture them. After that, I’ll make you watch as I torture them to death!”

When he spoke up to this point, he suddenly pointed at Little Sky, “I’ll start with her.”

A cold smile curled up on Yang Yan’s face when he heard Yang Xu. After that, his whip shot towards Little Sky again.

Hiss!

Sparks flew from Little Sky’s body again. Even though it was extremely painful, she didn’t make a sound.

A ferocious expression instantly covered Yang Ye’s face. He didn’t say anything or speak of any threats. Because it was pointless to do that right now. His figure immediately vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Yang Xu when he appeared once more. After that, he drew his sword and swung it!

Heavenrend!

Twelve overlapped Heavenrends!

The reason he could overlap twelve of them now was that he’d activated the Demon God’s Energy. Even though the effects of the Demon God’s Energy had become much weaker after he attained the Rebirth Realm, it was still useful!

A wisp of ridicule curled up on Yang Xu’s mouth. He pressed his right middle and index fingers together before tapping them forward.

Bang!

An explosion resounded. At the same time, a terrifying wave of energy swept out from before Yang Xu. Meanwhile, Yang Xu suddenly flipped his palm and pressed it downwards, causing the wave of energy that was sweeping towards him to shoot towards Yang Ye instead!

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted. He immediately sheathed his sword and drew it again.

A sword howl resounded as a ray of sword energy slashed down at the wave of energy.

Bang!

The wave of energy was instantly minced into bits. However, Yang Ye was pushed almost 10km back. As soon as he stopped himself, a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth. In just less than two breaths of time, his chest was drenched red with blood.,

A cold smile curled up on the corners of Yang Xue’s mouth, “You want to surmount your realm of cultivation to fight me? What a fool’s dream! When I was at the Rebirth Realm, I could surmount my realm of cultivation to kill Zenith Realm experts too. Now, I’m at the Zenith Realm. Trying to kill me while you’re at the Rebirth Realm? There are no more than thirty Rebirth Realm experts in the medium universe of Milky Way System that can do that! But you’re absolutely not one of them!”

He took a step forward while he spoke, and then he tapped his finger in Yang Ye’s direction again.

The space before him shook violently, and then a wave of powerful energy swept out from the space in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted slightly while his profound energy surged madly. At the same time, Slaughter Sword Intent surged out incessantly from him. A moment later, Yang Ye grabbed his sword with both hands and swung it forward.

The energy before him exploded apart, and the aftershock blasted him backwards again. He was pushed around 10km back before he could finally stop himself.

A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of Yang Xu’s mouth, “Do you realize how weak you are now?”

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and then he looked up towards the distance. Meanwhile, Yang Yan flicked his wrist again, and his whip descended upon Little Sky again.

Hiss!

Sprays sprayed from her again.

However, Yang Yan didn’t stop, and he started whipping even more swiftly. In an instant, his whip struck her numerous times.

Yang Yan revealed a savage smile as he continued whipping, “Are you filled with despair?”

Little Sky opened her eyes and gazed at Yang Ye, “Leave, alright? I don’t want you to see me like this.”

Yang Ye gazed at her just like that, and then a stream of liquid gradually seeped out from his eyes.

It was blood red!
