Chapter 1011 – The Graveyard Of Humans!

Chapter 1011 – The Graveyard Of Humans!

There was a man leaning against the wall by the entrance of the courtyard, and his arms were wrapped around a violet halberd.

He wore black clothes and had black hair, and both of them were fluttering freely with the wind while a faint smile hung on the corners of his mouth. His smile seemed quite charming.

Yang Ye sized up the man and asked, “Lou Qianxiao?”

The man sized up Yang Ye, and then the faint smile on his face grew wider, “I never expected that another person in the Half-Saint Realm capable of killing Saints would have appeared in our prefecture. Not bad. Come, let me see how strong you are!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his halberd left his grasp and shot forward like a bolt of lightning.

It couldn’t be said to be very fast, and it should be called quite slow. But Yang Ye had the feeling that he couldn’t avoid it and would definitely die!

It was the halberd’s aura!

An imposing aura!

Yang Ye had a solemn expression in his eyes. His sword had its aura as well when he attacked with it, and he knew how formidable such an aura was. However, he hadn’t expected the man’s aura to actually be strong to such an extent. It could be said that his aura wasn’t weaker to Quasi Void Rank sword intent!

Yang Ye didn’t underestimate the man’s attack. He took a step forward, and then Yellow Springs carried Void Rank sword intent as he tapped it lightly against the halberd.

Clang!

A sharp and ear piercing sound of collision resounded as both the halberd and sword trembled violently. After that, the halberd was blasted back to the man’s grasp, and he took 3 steps back while the limestone beneath his feet were instantly blasted into powder.

As for Yang Ye, he’d take a single step back, and it didn’t cause the slightest change to the ground beneath his feet!

“Void Rank sword intent!” There was a trace of solemnness on the man’s face, “You’ve truly surprised me. You actually comprehended a Void Rank intent. After all, even Lou Qianxiao and I haven’t been able to do so. Of course, it doesn’t represent that we would lose to you. In the end, intents are only auxiliary abilities!”

Yang Ye said, “You’re not Lou Qianxiao!”

The black clothed man said, “You might be dead if I were him!”

“Is that so?” Yang Ye neither agreed nor disagreed, “If you aren’t Lou Qianxiao, then you’re the Endless Devil Sect’s Void Lord, Xuwu Shen.”

“Smart!” Void Lord chuckled, “I’m the number two genius of Pine Prefecture! What do you think? Don’t you feel happy to have finally met me?”

“You’re much stronger than Wan’er and the others!” Yang Ye spoke in a low voice. While he’d only exchanged a single blow with Xuwu Shen, Yang Ye knew that the other 3 top geniuses of the south, Lu Wan’er included, were no match for him. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Lou Qianxiao and I’ve gone to the Central Divine Prefecture!” Xuwu Shen’s smile gradually vanished, “Only by going there will you realize how laughable the so-called geniuses of our prefecture are. Just like you. Your attainments in the Sword Dao are definitely the best amongst the younger generation of our prefecture, but you would probably be unable to even be ranked in the top 10 of the Central Divine Prefecture! Lou Qianxiao and I haven’t been able to leave Qing Daofu and the others far behind because their natural talent is inferior, the problem lies in their mental state. How can a person who isn’t able to discern his flaws and shortcomings be able to become a true expert?”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “I really do agree with that.”

“Let’s not waste our time on that!” Xuwu Shen waved his hand and said, “I’m here on behalf of the Endless Devil Sect. My Endless Devil Sect has always been eager to help others. We’re aware that you’re being bullied by Sky Divine Hall, the Python Clan, and the Steel Ape Clan, and I’ve come here just to lend you a hand. Right, so long as you agree to making Ocean of Clouds Academy a subordinate of my Endless Devil Sect, then my Endless Devil Sect will protect your academy from now on!”

“Thank you for the kind intentions!” Yang Ye continued, “However, we don’t need anyone’s protection. So, you can head back now!”

Xuwu Shen glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Ocean of Clouds Academy only has 4 Saints now, and it’s only 5 even if that other Saints who’s helping you is included. But Sky Divine Hall, the Python Clan, the Steel Ape Clan, and the Dao Order aren’t your only enemies, there are those people from the Central Divine Prefecture as well. To be honest, you’ll have no chance to survive even if you join forces with the Ancient Sword School!”

“If I really have no other choice, I’ll just lead the academy to surrender to Sky Divine Hall.” Yang Ye continued, “I think they will definitely not reject us.”

Xuwu Shen gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he suddenly cracked a smile, “I was kidding just now. Now, we can talk properly. We have a mutual enemy, so I think that we can have a proper discussion about it. Right?”

“An equal alliance!” Yang Ye looked Xuwu Shen in the eyes and said, “Both sides will be of equal status. My request is just that simple.”

“That’s disadvantageous to my Endless Devil Sect!” Xuwu Shen continued, “Even if the Ancient Sword School is included, your forces aren’t as strong as ours, right?”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Then let’s do it like this. You’ll just have to deal with Sky Divine Hall. We will deal with the Python Clan and Steel Ape Clan. As for the Central Divine Prefecture, we’ll join forces against them. Alright?”

“It still isn’t fair!” Xuwu Shen said, “Your academy is the target of those fellows from the Central Divine Prefecture, and it isn’t our Endless Devil Sect!”

“They’ve relied on the forces of Sky Divine Hall to deal with Ocean of Clouds Academy and the Ancient Sword Sect, so they definitely promised Sky Divine Hall something. No matter what it was, it’ll definitely be disadvantageous to your Endless Devil Sect. So, the moment they chose to join forces with Sky Divine Hall is the moment they became enemies with your Endless Devil Sect, right?” said Yang Ye.

“While....” Xuwu Shen intended to say something but Yang Ye suddenly interrupted him, “I understand what you’re trying to say, but what I want to say is that the current situation is already at its most dangerous moment. If we still continue making a fuss about every small detail, then only death will be waiting for us. But if we’re able to win, then your Endless Devil Sect will be the only human power throughout the north.”

Xuwu Shen said, “You aren’t going to encroach on the north?”

Yang Ye replied, “I would be lying if I said that I didn’t want to, but I know my own limits.”

Xuwu Shen gazed at him for a long time before he said, “Then it’s decided! Right, before I came here, I received news that Sky Divine Hall has dispatched some of its experts to the south in secret, and it’s probably to capture that woman, Yu Wushuang, who possesses a unique physique. It wasn’t related to my Endless Devil Sect before this, but it is now. So, don’t worry, those experts won’t be able to arrive in the south!”

Yang Ye flicked a violet crystal over to Xuwu Shen and said, “It’s just a small token. Don’t refuse it!”

Xuwu Shen took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, and he said, “You’re really quite a good guy!” As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand and vanished on the spot.

Yu Wushuang walked into the courtyard once Xuwu Shen left, “Looks like Sky Divine Hall still refuses to give up on capturing me!”

Yang Ye replied, “I don’t intend to give up on destroying them as well!”

Yu Wushuang glanced at Yang Ye and said, “You’re always so confident.” She withdrew a beast skin scroll and passed it to Yang Ye once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What’s this?”

“This is the map of the Zither of Love and the way to get there. It’s not very complete, but it should be sufficient for you to get to the Zither of Love.” She looked Yang Ye in the eyes as she continued, “I know that you’ll never be satisfied until you’re allowed to give it a try. But you have to promise me that you’ll come back right away if it’s impossible. Promise me that you won’t insist on carrying on when it’s too dangerous. Alright?”

Yang Ye gazed at the scroll for a long time, and then he stretched out his hand and rubbed Yu Wushuang’s head. He smiled as he said, “You’re getting more and more smarter. The longer it was delayed, the more disadvantageous it would be for Lu Wan’er, so he was prepared to head to the Zither of Love and search for the Fruit of Creation once he emerged from his closed door cultivation. But he hadn’t expected that Yu Wushuang would have guessed his intentions and made preparations for him!

Yu Wushuang spoke seriously, “That demon king on Immortal Island is called Asura Queen, and she’s the strongest and most mysterious amongst the 12 demon kings of Pine Prefecture. Because no one knows her true strength and background. All they know is that the entire ocean she rules over is extremely hostile to humans. She once said that she would annihilate everyone related to any human who dared to step foot into the Zither of Love! It’s a forbidden area for humans! So, even if you’re heading there, you can’t do so openly!”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “I have the Laws of Darkness and the Sword Domain, even a Saint can’t notice my presence if I don’t show myself!”

“That’s the reason why I dared to let you go!” Yu Wushuang spoke softly, “Of course, I don’t want you to go right now. Because your strength is still quite weak. But I know that you’ll definitely be unhappy if I don’t, and I can’t stop you.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t be worried. I’m just going to give it a try. I’ll give up if it’s truly too difficult.”

Yu Wushuang said, “Remember that the academy, Big Sister Wan’er, and all of us will only have hope while you’re alive. If you’re dead, then you should be able to imagine what will happen to all of us!”

Yang Ye nodded solemnly.

Yu Wushuang continued, “I’ll tell everyone you’re in closed door cultivation. You’re the backbone of the academy and city right now, and they’ll only be at ease while you’re here. Besides that, you don’t have to say goodbye to Big Sister Wan’er so that she doesn’t start worrying about you!”

Yang Ye waved his right hand and Zhu Yuan appeared before Yu Wushuang, “He’ll protect you and Wan’er in secret once I’ve left. Don’t refuse it because I’m not going to Immortal Island to fight anyone, so it’s pointless for me to bring more help. Moreover, only by having a Saint always there to protect you and Wan’er would I truly be able to leave with my heart at ease!”

Yu Wushuang fell silent for a moment before she said, “How long will it take you?”

“Half a month at least, or a month at most!” Yang Ye continued, “You can send me a voice transmission if anything happens in the city.” When he spoke up to this point, he moved close to her and kissed her lightly on the forehead, “Take care of yourself and Wan’er!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Meanwhile, Yu Wushuang touched her forehead and stared blankly on the spot for quite some time.

...

Two days later.

Yang Ye noticed a city not too far away from the Zither of Love. The city was small and not even a tenth of Ocean of Clouds City’s size. Moreover, it was quite tattered.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment before he flashed to its entrance.

The city walls were extremely damaged and covered in cracks. They simply seemed like they would collapse at any moment.

There were 4 large and bloody words above the rusty city gate — The Graveyard of Humans.

The Graveyard of Humans? Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment, and then he flashed into the city. His expression changed drastically when he witnessed the scene within the scene.

There were corpses, countless corpses that filled his field of vision. There were at least over 100,000 of them!

The corpses were nailed in rows on the sides of the street, and there were no buildings there. There were only numerous stone pillars, and those pillars were covered in corpses as well. Most of them were cultivators, and their cultivations weren’t low as well. The weakest amongst them was at the Monarch Realm.

Besides that, Yang Ye noticed 4 corpses right at the front of the rows on both sides.

Those 4 corpses belonged to Saints!

There was a stone tablet at the center of the street, and there was a row of bloody words on it — Those who trespass into the Zither of Love shall die!
