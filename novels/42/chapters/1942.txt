Chapter 1943 – Attack of a Saint!

Yang Ye turned around. There was a black robed old man behind him, and he recognized the old man.

It was Gu Ya who’d traveled to the large universe with them.

Gu Ya!

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “It’s you!” He hadn’t expected that he would encounter Gu Ya here.

Gu Ya grinned, “Young Brother Yang, long time no see!”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “You’re definitely here for a reason, right?”

Gu Ya nodded, “Allow me to overstep a little. You’re an extraordinary genius, and you’ll definitely accomplish great things in the large universe. So, why destroy your own future for a sword?”

Yang Ye smiled, “So you’re here for the sword!”

“Yes!” Gu Ya looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “I know you’re a straightforward person, so I won’t beat around the bush. One of the ten paradises, the Oblivion Sect, stands behind me. The Oblivion Sect can be ranked in the top three amongst the ten paradises. If you’re willing to hand over that sword, then my sect’s master is willing to take you as his personal disciple!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Gu Ya added, “Young Brother, it’s an absolutely great opportunity!”

Yang Ye smiled and looked Gu Ya in the eyes, “You should be aware that I offended the Sovereign of Man and the Shaman Hunter Clan. So, what I want to know is… Is the Oblivion Sect stronger than both of them?”

Gu Ya spoke solemnly, “Young Brother, I’ll just be frank. The holy sword will only bring endless troubles to you. Hand it over, and many will cease to look for trouble with you. At that time, you’ll definitely be able to survive with the strength you possess!”

Yang Ye asked, “What if I refuse?”

Gu Ya looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “I advise you not to do that!”

Yang Ye grinned, “So long as it doesn’t leave me on its own, then it belongs to me.”

As a sword cultivator, handing over his sword was no different than surrendering. So, he would naturally not do something like that. A sword cultivator’s sword could be broken, not bent. While bending represented survival, but it also represented a lack of backbone and honor!

Gu Ya gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “Who was the master of Feng Yu Forest to you?”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Gu Ya shook his head slightly, “Nothing. I’m just asking.”

He waved his right hand, and then two old men appeared by his side.

Both of them were Dao Realm experts!

However, they weren’t at the Know Dao Realm, and they were new Hear Dao Realm experts!

Two Hear Dao Realm experts and a 3rd stage Enlightened Realm expert!

Gu Ya was at the 3rd stage of the Enlightened Realm now!

His cultivation had risen by leaps and bounds!

Gu Ya took a step back, and then he said to the old man who held a cane with a dragon head, “Elder Mo, you deal with him!”

Elder Mo nodded slightly, and then he took a step forward and gazed at Yang Ye. A moment later, a powerful aura swept out like a storm and slammed down towards Yang Ye!

He was using his aura to suppress Yang Ye!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly while his profound energy surged.

A breath of time later, Yang Ye opened his eyes, and then he vanished on the spot.

As soon as Yang Ye’s figure vanished, a ray of light flashed. While Yang Ye was only at the 6th stage of the True Realm, his speed caused Elder Mo, a Hear Dao Realm expert, to be visibly moved by it!

Bang!

An explosion rumbled, and then a figure was blasted away.

It was Yang Ye’s figure!

Yang Ye finally stopped himself after flying almost 3km back, and then he glanced at his hand. At this moment, it had cracked open, and threads of blood were flowing from it. He fell silent for a moment before looking up at the old man.

A Dao Realm expert!

Yang Ye knew that the gap between him and a Dao Realm expert wasn’t small at all, and it should be very huge. If he didn’t rely on any external sources of strength, then his current realm of cultivation was utterly insufficient to go against such experts!

Yet now, even if he used external sources of strength, it was still very difficult for him to deal with such an expert.

The gap in their cultivation was too huge!

Elder Mo glanced at Yang Ye, “Extraordinary indeed. If you didn’t offend the Sovereign of Man and Shaman Hunter Clan, then I would definitely convince the sect master to take you as his personal disciple. Unfortunately, the problems you’re in are too huge, and even my Oblivion Sect wouldn’t dare to rashly get involved in it.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took a step forward, stretched out his hand in Yang Ye’s direction, and twisted it slightly.

In an instant, the space around Yang Ye warped!

A wave of powerful energy enveloped him, and Yang Ye felt like his body was about to be torn apart.

It felt like he was being torn apart!

Yang Ye didn’t dare hold back, and he utilized the Sword Domain. As soon as the Sword Domain appeared, the energy around him weakened tremendously. At the same time, 10 ethereal swords appeared around Elder Mo. An instant later, rays of light crisscrossed and enveloped him!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Countless rays of light flickered incessantly through the Sword Domain, but they were actually unable to get close to Elder Mo!

The space around Elder Mo showed faint signs of being warped, and just that had made Yang Ye’s sword energy incapable of getting close to Elder Mo!

Yang Ye’s face fell once more.

“What sharp sword energy!” Elder Mo spoke abruptly, “Unfortunately, it’s still not really enough!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he appeared out of thin air before Yang Ye. Meanwhile, Yang Ye had appeared 3km away. But just a moment passed before another ray of sword energy appeared before Elder Mo’s forehead!

The Sword Domain combined with Split Second! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

It was absolutely swift. If one looked carefully, one would notice that because it had been so fast, space had been torn open in its wake.

When the sword energy arrived around half an inch away from him, Elder Mo raised his right hand and swung a punch!

Boom!

The sword energy exploded apart while his figure was pushed almost 300m back.

After he pushed Elder Mo back, Yang Ye followed up with another attack. He transformed into a ray of light that appeared in front of Elder Mo again, and then he swung his sword with both hands.

Suddenly, Elder Mo moved 300m backwards, and then he slapped his palm at Yang Ye.

A huge ethereal palm that was over 100m wide appeared in front of Yang Ye, and the powerful energy it carried caused the space around Yang Ye to crack open.

Yang Ye was shocked. However, his sword didn’t stop, and he still swung it down!

Bang!

The ethereal palm was sliced into two. However, Yang Ye was blasted over 10km away.

While he’d been pushed back, Yang Ye had relied on his powerful physical body to forcefully endure it.

“Amazing! Truly amazing!” Meanwhile, Elder Mo spoke abruptly, “All the geniuses of my Oblivion Sect are inferior to you.”

Yang Ye smiled, “The Oblivion Sect… Very good, I’ll pay a visit to your sect in the future.”

“You want to take revenge?” Elder Mo spoke indifferently, “I’m afraid you won’t have the chance!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he gazed at Gu Ya and the other old man, “Don’t give him any chances! Attack with me!”

Gu Ya and the other old man were about to join the battle once they heard this.

Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “You intend to bully me with numbers? I have help too! Show yourself!”

A flurry little head emerged.

It was Snowy!

Elder Mo and the others stopped when they saw Snowy, and there was a trace of curiosity in their eyes.

They were curious about Yang Ye’s help!

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head and said, “Attack them!”

Snowy blinked, and then she waved her claws. She was asking if she really could attack them.

Yang Ye nodded, “This time you can.”

Snowy cracked a smile, and then she gazed at Elder Mo’s group. After that, a sword appeared in her grasp before a ray of sword energy tore through the air.

Elder Mo waved his right hand, and the sword energy vanished without a trace.

Snowy was stunned.

Yang Ye’s face darkened, “Don’t use a sword, use your fists. No, use your paws. Use all your strength. Because they want to kill me. If you don’t kill them, then they’ll kill me!”

“Enough!” Suddenly, Elder Mo spoke coldly, “Yang Ye, are you playing tricks with me? You…”

Suddenly, Snowy appeared 300m away from Elder Mo.

Snowy gazed at the old man, clenched her paws, and seemed like she was very angry.

Elder Mo didn’t say anything, and he just waved a strand of powerful energy towards Snowy.

Snowy took a deep breath, and then her figure shuddered before a wave of terrifying aura emerged from within her.

Elder Mo and the others were stunned when they sensed the aura.

Obviously, they hadn’t expected that little fellow before them to possess such a terrifying aura.

Suddenly, Snowy’s body spun 360 degrees on the spot, and then she slammed one of her tiny fists forward.

Something shocking occurred!

That insignificant little fist caused the space in an enormous area to crack open!

As for Elder Mo, who bore the brunt of it, he was blasted over 30km away.

As soon as he stopped himself, blood sprayed out repeatedly from his mouth, and then he looked up at Snowy, “Sage… Sage Protection…”

Bang!

As soon as he finished speaking, Elder Mo’s figure exploded and vanished without a trace.

Gu Ya and the other old man were stunned!

Snowy blinked, glanced at her paw, and then gazed at where Elder Mo had been obliterated. She kept blinking as she thought to herself, I’m that strong?

Meanwhile, she suddenly gazed at Gu Ya and the other old man, and then she clenched her right paw.

Gu Ya and the other old man’s expressions changed drastically!

Their eyes were filled with fear!

Snowy didn’t attack them. She just sat on her sword and floated slowly in their direction. She was helping Yang Ye pressure them!

Gu Ya gulped when he saw her fly towards them, and then he moved backwards incessantly with the old man.

Meanwhile, Snowy suddenly waved her little claws, and then Gu Ya and the old man moved 3km back.

Actually, the attack of a Sage could only be used once!
