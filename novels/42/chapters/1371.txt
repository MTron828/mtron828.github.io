Chapter 1372 – Why Waste Your Breath?

The Alliance of Guardians would naturally not let the matter rest. Yang Ye had destroyed the Eye of the Heaven Dao in their territory, and he’d even killed their experts. So, how could they possibly let the matter rest?

As for Yang Ye, the Alliance of Guardians had forced him to leave the Radiant Dimension that day, and it had broken its promise by sending the powers of the Radiant Dimension to attack White Deer Academy. Moreover, it even assisted the Celestial Demon Stellar Region to attack Lady’s stellar region, causing her to fall into a hopeless situation. It could be said that even if the Alliance of Guardians intended to spare him, Yang Ye wouldn’t spare them.

Since both sides refused to spare each other, there was naturally only a single outcome, and that was battle! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Yang Ye’s green clothes fluttered with the breeze in midair, and it made him seem carefree and unrestrained beneath the fierceness he revealed. His face was indifferent while his gaze was calm with a trace of indifference. While he stood there with his sword still sheathed, he revealed a very sharp aura that seemed capable of piercing through the world. It made others feel like he was invincible.

“You made the right bet.” Xiao Ling gazed at Yang Ye and spoke softly. Presently, while Yang Ye was still young, he was a peerless expert. Most importantly, he hadn’t forgotten the kindness shown to him in the past. Even though White Deer Academy’s strength had declined tremendously, it wouldn’t be difficult for the academy to return to its prime with an expert like Yang Ye supporting and protecting it.

Of course, the precondition was overcoming the current danger they faced!

Xiao Bieli shook his head lightly, “It wasn’t a gamble. I just felt like it was something I should do.”

Xiao Ling chuckled, “As they say, the good are rewarded.”

Xiao Bieli shook his head, smiled, and remained silent.

Bang!

Meanwhile, an extremely powerful wave of pressure slammed down from the sky above. It was extremely powerful and felt like the sky was collapsing, and it caused the experts within White Deer Dimension to feel suffocated.

But it only took an instant for a strand of terrifying sword intent to shoot up from within Yang Ye, and it was like a torrent that swept up into the air.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded through the sky, and then the terrifying pressure vanished, allowing everyone in White Deer Dimension to feel lighter and return to normal.

Meanwhile, a violet robed old man walked down slowly from the sky. Every single step he took made the sky tremble violently and ripple as if it couldn’t endure the weight of his footsteps.

A Semi-Deity!

After Yang Ye killed a true Voider, the Alliance of Guardians didn’t send more Voiders to give their lives away, and they’d just sent a Semi-Deity instead.

The Alliance of Guardians wasn’t stupid. Since a true Voider had been killed with ease, how could they possibly send more?

Xiao Bieli and Xiao Ling’s expressions became extremely solemn when they saw the old man.

They didn’t know that the Semi-Deity Realm was above the Voider Realm. After all, they hadn’t come into contact with such a level of cultivation. However, their instinct told them that the old man wasn’t on the same level as the last old man. In other words, it was an expert who surpassed the Voider Realm!

Both of them gazed at Yang Ye. Besides solemness, there was a trace of worry in their eyes.

Yang Ye was just an Emperor. So, could he stop that old man?

“Yang Ye!” The old man’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye, “I never expected you to have grown to such an extent. We should have stopped at nothing to kill you that day. That was our....”

“Since you’re here, then why waste your breath!” Yang Ye interrupted the old man, grabbed the Sword Precursor, and drew it.

Om!

A sword howl resounded through the Radiant Dimension as a beam of sword energy shot up into the sky. The sword energy was absolutely swift and powerful, and even space was instantly torn into bits when it shot forward.

At the same time, space in an area of over 10,000km cracked apart. However, Yang Ye repaired the cracks himself. The Radiant Dimension was a small world, so the space here was extremely weak and couldn’t endure his strength at all. If he didn’t repair the space here, then space would collapse. One that happened, it would be a calamity for the residents of White Deer Dimension.

The sword energy vanished into the sky while the old man remained on the spot.

The old man gazed at Yang Ye while disbelief filled his eyes, “I... I never expected... that you would... already be... so... strong.”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure gradually turned ethereal. It didn’t take long for the old man’s figure to vanish before everyone’s fields of vision.

He’s dead?

Xiao Bieli and the others were stunned on the spot, and it took a long time for them to recover.

That powerful old man was dead. Yang Ye had put an end to his life with a single swing of the sword.

All of them had a new understanding of Yang Ye’s strength.

Yang Ye’s face was slightly pale. Even though executing the true form of Heavenrend wouldn’t cripple him and make him suffer from backlash as he had in the past, it still affected him. That attack had used practically half of his profound energy. Moreover, it had been utilized in one go. So, it made his body feel severely empty, and it felt like he’d been starving for a long time.

Fortunately, the current side effects of utilizing the true form of Heavenrend could practically be ignored when compared to the past.

Even though Yang Ye had killed the old man with a single swing of his sword, Xiao Bieli and Xiao Ling still had solemn expressions on their faces. Because they were very well aware that the Alliance of Guardians had gained a good understanding of Yang Ye’s strength now. In other words, the next expert it sent would definitely be much stronger than the last old man.

The battle had truly begun now!

Yang Ye turned to look at Xiao Bieli and said, “Dean, where’s the Martial Sect?” He naturally intended to take An Nanjing with him when he left.

Xiao Bieli asked, “You want to go there?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Xiao Bieli said, “I’ll take you there!”

As soon as he finished speaking, both of them vanished into the sky.

Xiao Bieli suddenly asked while they traveled, “You aren’t going to look for trouble with the Martial Sect, right?”

“Why do you say that?” Yang Ye continued, “Did they participate in the attack on White Deer Academy as well?”

“No!” Xiao Bieli said, “However, the Alliance of Guardians had definitely hinted that they should. But they didn’t act against us. Conversely, they even helped us in secret on many occasions.”

Yang Ye was quite curious, “Aren’t they afraid of the Alliance of Guardians?”

“I’m curious about that as well.” Xiao Bieli continued, “But no matter what, they’d helped us. So, if it’s possible, don’t annihilate them.”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he shook his head and smiled, “Dean, I’m not a psycho who’s obsessed with killing. I’m just going to get my friend.”

“Good!” Xiao Bieli smiled. He’d chosen to come because he was afraid Yang Ye had gone mad with the desire to slaughter and would even annihilate the Martial Sect.

Yang Ye smiled. He knew that in Xiao Bieli’s opinion, he was a madman who loved to slaughter.

Meanwhile, Xiao Bieli added, “The Martial Sect’s reputation is inferior in comparison to the Nether Pavilion or Evil Faction, and it’s weaker as well. However, it may not be so ordinary. Because both the Nether Pavilion and Evil Faction seem to have never offended it. Let’s not talk about the Nether Pavilion because it has always been elusive, and it rarely looks for trouble with anyone else if others don’t offend it. But there has been friction between the Martial Sect and Evil Faction on many occasions, but they were all left unsettled.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “All that matters is that An Nanjing is fine!” He didn’t care whether the Martial Sect was strong or weak. He cared about An Nanjing. He’d decided to make her stay with him and not be separated again.

He didn’t have sufficient strength in the past, so An Nanjing could gain better protection in the Martial Sect. Yet now, he had the ability to protect her. Actually, An Nanjing may not need his protection. After all, she really possessed great natural talent.

An Nanjing was unlike Nether Maiden and the other hall masters of the Nether Pavilion. Nether Pavilion and the others had been reborn. So, once they awakened, their strength would multiply even if they didn’t cultivate. But An Nanjing was unlike them. She didn’t have memories of her past life, and she’d truly relied on her own hard work and natural talent to become the Martial God.

So, based on Yang Ye’s estimation, her strength had probably grown much stronger as well.

That was a good thing, of course. With An Nanjing’s help, he could rest at ease even if he wasn’t at the Sword Alliance. After all, she was entirely capable of taking charge on her own.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye and Xiao Bieli to arrive at the Martial Sect.

They naturally didn’t fly straight into the Martial Sect. While they had the strength to do so, it was too overbearing.

The Martial Sect was built on a mountain. There were countless luxurious and imposing pavilions on the peak of the mountain. The most striking thing on the mountain peak was a stone statue at the entrance of it.

The stone statue was extremely tall, and it was the status of a middle aged man. The middle aged man’s hands were behind his back, and he was looking up at the sky with an indifferent gaze. Even though it was just a statue, it was filled with an unparalleled aura of supremacy.

Xiao Bieli said, “That should be the Martial Sect’s founding ancestor, Luo Wuchen.”

Yang Ye glanced at the statue, nodded slightly, and didn’t speak.

It didn’t take long for a pillar of light to shoot up from within the Martial Sect, and then an old man appeared before them.

Yang Ye recognized the old man. It was Wu Yuan whom he’d met that day in White Deer Dimension.

Wu Yuan had an extremely solemn expression on his face when he saw Yang Ye. Even though the Martial Sect hadn’t sent its forces to attack White Deer Academy, it knew what had happened in White Deer Academy. The 4 great clans and the Evil Faction.... All of them were once awe inspiring powers in the Radiant Dimension. But besides the Mu Clan, the rest were history now.

Xiao Bieli smiled, “Wu Yuan, long time no see!”

Wu Yuan nodded slightly and said, “Congratulations.”

The White Deer Academy had been practically destroyed because it saved Yang Ye all those years ago. At that time, many people said that Xiao Bieli was a fool to go against so many powers for the sake of a student. Yet now.... Countless people envied Xiao Bieli,

With such a terrifying student supporting it, it was absolutely not difficult for White Deer Academy to return to its former glory. After all, Yang Ye was much more dazzling than the founding ancestor of White Deer Academy.

Xiao Bieli smiled, and then he spoke seriously, “We’re here for the little girl, An Nanjing.”

Wu Yuan’s expression changed slightly when he heard Xiao Bieli.

Yang Ye frowned when he noticed this, “What’s wrong?”

Wu Yuan hesitated for a moment and said, “She’s gone.”

Bang!

A terrifying aura suddenly surged out from within Yang Ye, and then Wu Yuan was blasted around 3km away.
