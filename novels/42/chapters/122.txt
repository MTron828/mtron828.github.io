Chapter 123 – Attack!

“Do you know who you’re talking to?” Dong Wushang spoke furiously.

“Junior Brother Yang, this is Senior Brother Dong Wushang from Sky Peak, and he’s the person leading our group this time.” Wei Ran hurriedly explained from the side. He knew about Yang Ye’s disposition, and he was deeply afraid that Yang Ye would enter into conflict with Dong Wushang.

Yang Ye smiled and said, “Earlier, this Senior Brother Dong Wushang said he would give the Flower Palace an explanation. I really want to know what sort of explanation Senior Brother Dong Wushang intends to give the Flower Palace. Does he intend for me to pay with my life?”

“Why did you kill a disciple from the Flower Palace?” Dong Wushang asked once more.

“It was they who attacked first,” Said Yang Ye. He wanted to see how this Inner Court Disciple of the Sword Sect would deal with this matter.

Dong Wushang frowned, and then he turned around to look at Zhao Hanyue. However, the latter didn’t answer him and just gazed at Ghostarm who stood at the side. When he saw this, Dong Wushang took a deep breath, and then he turned around to look at Yang Ye before he said, “No matter what, it was wrong of you to attack and kill a disciple of the Flower Palace. How about this? I won’t kill you, but I must cripple your cultivation. Do you have any objections?”

He didn’t want to make a move against a disciple of his own sect as well, but he was even more unwilling to see Zhao Hanyue join forces with Ghostarm. Because if that happened, then all of them would probably perish here today.

When he heard Dong Wushang, Wei Ran’s expression changed. Yang Ye was someone that had passed through the 21st level of the Sword Servant Pagoda. A disciple with such natural talent and potential was utterly not someone that this Senior Brother standing before him could order around.

Wei Ran was just about to speak when Yang Ye had spoken before him and asked. “So, according to you, only they can kill me, but I can’t kill them?”

“Hmph!” Meanwhile, Zhao Hanyue grunted coldly and spoke with ridicule. “Dong Wushang, I never expected that you aren’t even able to control a single Outer Court Disciple of your Sword Sect. I truly thought too highly of you in the past!”

Xu Yan laughed lightly from the side and said, “Brother Dong, you’re truly too merciful. Even a tiny Outer Court Disciple dares to defy and contradict you. You’re truly a failure at being a senior brother!”

“Zhao Hanyue, Dong Wushang is clearly unable to give you an explanation. Since it’s like that, then why don’t we join forces and deal with the disciples of the Sword Sect that are here. What do you think?” Ghostarm that had been constantly watching the show spoke abruptly.

Dong Wushang’s expression was unsightly to the extreme from being ridiculed by them, and he immediately said in a cold voice, “Yang Ye, no matter what, it was wrong of you to kill a disciple of the Flower Palace. For the sake of preventing our Sword Sect from becoming enemies with the Flower Palace, I must cripple your cultivation and hand you over to be dealt with by the Flower Palace. As for the Sect, I’ll personally give the Sect an explanation!” As he spoke, Dong Wushang intended to make a move against Yang Ye.

“Haha....” Yang Ye suddenly started roaring with laughter. He laughed for a while before he said, “So, this is an Inner Court Disciple of the Sword Sect. It turns out that the Inner Court Disciples of the Sword Sect are so contemptible. No wonder the Sword Sect is at the bottom amongst the six great powers. How truly laughable! Cripple my cultivation and hand me over to be dealt with by the Flower Palace? Dong Wushang! Who the fuck do you think you are?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye didn’t wait for Dong Wushang to speak, and he drew his sword and slashed swiftly like a bolt of lightning!

When he heard Yang Ye, Dong Wushang was first stunned before he exploded with fury. Right when he was about to make a move, he’d never expected that this Mortal Realm Profounder that stood before him would attack before him. Moreover, he’d never expected that the speed of Yang Ye’s sword would actually be so swift. Fortunately, it wasn’t swift to the point that he didn’t have the ability to resist.

He didn’t have the time to give it any thought. Dong Wushang’s figure flashed backward and avoided Yang Ye’s sword strike that shot over like a bolt of lightning. However, right when his foot hit the ground, a pair of utterly pale hands suddenly appeared behind him and stretched out towards his back.

It turned out that Ghostarm had hurriedly attacked as well when Yang Ye drew his sword and slashed it at Dong Wushang.

“It’s Ghostarm! Senior Brother Dong, watch out!” When they saw this scene, Wei Ran and the disciples of the Sword Sect behind him turned pale with fright!

Dong Wushang’s expression changed violently as well. He swiftly stomped the ground with his right foot, and his figure instantly soared into the sky to avoid Ghostarm’s abrupt attack. However, a strand of fresh blood suddenly sprayed out from Dong Wushang’s shoulder.

Yang Ye didn’t pursue Dong Wushang and launch a second attack after completing his first strike. Even though he really wanted to kill Dong Wushang, he wouldn’t join forces with Ghostarm because of Su Qingshi.

Ghostarm cried out in his heart after his sudden attack failed. What a pity!

He wanted to continue the attack, but it was obvious that he didn’t have a chance any longer because the other members of the Sword Sect had circled around Dong Wushang.

Ghostarm licked the fresh blood on his hand, and then he looked at Yang Ye and said, “Little Brother, that was a really swift strike. Since Dong Wushang wanted to hand you over, why don’t we join forces? Right, that beauty by your side as well. What do you think about the three of us joining forces to annihilate all these members of the Sword Sect?”

“Yang Ye, you actually dared to betray the Sect! How audacious of you!” Dong Wushang gazed at Yang Ye as he spoke in a furious tone. He’d never expected that this Outer Court Disciple of the Sword Sect would actually dare to attack him. Moreover, he’d almost perished from Ghostarm’s surprise attack because of this attack. This caused him to be both shocked and furious.

“I betrayed the Sect?” Yang Ye couldn’t help but laugh, and he said, “Dong Wushang, I, Yang Ye, am not a disciple of the Sword Sect, so how can I be considered as a traitor? As for why I’m not a disciple of the Sword Sect, you just have to ask the Sword Commanding Elder in your Sky Peak. Moreover, the enmity between me and this great beauty Zhao is none of your business nor does it have anything to do with the Sword Sect, so stop poking your nose into other people’s business!”

“You aren’t a disciple of the Sword Sect?” Dong Wushang spoke with astonishment, and Wei Ran and the others who stood behind him had astounded and puzzled expressions as well.

“It’s even better that you aren’t a disciple of the Sword Sect. Young Brother, how about we join forces and annihilate these members of the Sword Sect?” Ghostarm invited once more.

“Since you’re not a disciple of the Sword Sect, then who exactly are you? Who gave you the courage to dare to kill a disciple of my Flower Palace?” Zhao Hanyue gazed at Yang Ye while she asked in a low voice.

Yang Ye didn’t answer Ghostarm and Zhao Hanyue. He turned around and said to Qin Xiyue, “Let’s go!”

Under the current circumstances, he was utterly unable to kill Zhao Hanyue, so staying here any longer would only be a waste of time. In any case, so long as Zhao Hanyue didn’t leave the Tomb of Emperor Zhou, then he had more than enough opportunities.

Qin Xiyue nodded obediently, and then she followed behind Yang Ye.

When she saw Yang Ye and Qin Xiyue leave, a cold glow flashed in Zhao Hanyue’s eyes. She had the impulse to attack a few times, but she suppressed it in the end. With that woman present by his side, she didn’t have the slightest confidence in being able to take the life of that young man called Yang Ye.

Ghostarm hesitated for a moment yet didn’t move in the end. Even though he was very displeased by Yang Ye’s attitude, he didn’t have any confidence in being able to take Yang Ye’s life. Because there was a woman at the King Realm by Yang Ye’s side. Most importantly, if he made a move and attacked, then he would be in danger if the woman by Yang Ye’s side joined forces with Dong Wushang.

When he thought up to here, Ghostarm chuckled coldly, and then stretched out his right hand and grabbed Su Xiaoxiao’s corpse that was lying on the ground. After that, his figure flashed and vanished on the spot. “Since no one wants this corpse, then I, Ghostarm, will accept this gift. Don’t worry, I’ll be good to her. Haha....”

“Ghostarm!” Zhao Hanyue roared furiously, and then her figure flashed after Ghostarm.

“I originally intended to watch a show!” Xu Yan sighed and said, “I never expected it would come to such an end. Brother Dong, farewell!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he didn’t stay here any longer, and he brought all the other members of the Origin School along as he walked towards another passageway.

After they left, Dong Wushang asked in a low voice. “Wei Ran, is that Yang Ye a disciple of my Sword Sect or not?” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Senior Brother!” Wei Ran said, “Of course he is. He was originally an Outer Court Disciple of my Sword Sect, but Elder Qian had reduced him to a Labor Disciple because he was unable to absorb Profound Energy at that time. However, he recovered a year later. Moreover, not only had he recovered, he even ascended to the 22nd level of the Sword Servant Pagoda and broke Murong Yao’s record!”

“The 22nd level?” Dong Wushang was shocked.

Wei Ran nodded and said, “That’s not all. He even instantly annihilated Liu Qingyu who was at the 2nd rank of the First Heaven Realm at that time.”

Dong Wushang’s eyelids twitched when he heard this. This is a true monstrous genius, and it’s only a matter of time for such a monster to surpass me!

“But I don’t understand why he said he isn’t a disciple of my Sword Sect!” Wei Ran was puzzled.

After a short while, Dong Wushang shook his head and said, “Let’s not pay any attention to him. I’ll ask the elders about this matter after I return to the sect. It’s fine if that Yang Ye really isn’t a disciple of my Sword Sect, but if he is, then the sect will definitely punish him for attacking a fellow disciple of the sect, killing a disciple of Flower Palace, and saying that he isn’t a disciple of the Sword Sect!”

As he finished speaking, Dong Wushang’s voice carried traces of coldness.

Wei Ran’s lips moved. He’d intended to say that it was the Flower Palace that attacked first, but when he saw Dong Wushang’s furious expression, he knew that this Senior Brother Dong of his hated Yang Ye. So, he immediately swallowed back what he wanted to say.
