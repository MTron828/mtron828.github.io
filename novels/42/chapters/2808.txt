Chapter 2809 – The Ancient Evil Beasts!

The man’s expression turned unsightly to the extreme!

Bully Yang Ye?

He hadn’t even been able to react before his arms were gone.

How would he bully Yang Ye?

Yang Ye didn’t waste his time on the man and just walked away.

Many in the world only dared to bully the weak while fearing the strong. They were absolutely arrogant before the weak, but when facing those who were stronger than them, they would be absolutely cowardly instead!

Just like that, countless watched as Yang Ye and the others vanished from their fields of vision.

Once Yang Ye and the others vanished, the man, who had lost his arms to Yang Ye, suddenly looked to the side. Suddenly, a few figures charged down from the city walls, and then he was smashed into bits before he could even react!

One of them took his spatial ring and left!

Along with Yang Ye and the others’ departure, the city didn’t regain its peace, and the battles grew even more intense instead. However, there was a change in identity. Those who once bullied the weak were being bullied as the weak!

Yang Ye traveled through the starry sky and arrived at the Three Dimensional Universe. Yang Ye made arrangements for them to live in the Three Dimensional Universe and put them under Yan Ku’s leadership.

Eternal Kingdom would definitely be rebuilt in the future. At that time, he would allow the people in Eternal Kingdom to come back here. As for the relationship between the universes, he believed that they wouldn’t cause trouble!

If they were to do that, all of them would die!

Moreover, the mysterious expert and Destiny were still out there!

The Three Dimensional Universe was the only place they were safe right now.

No one wanted to lose their home!

So, Yang Ye wasn’t worried about them getting along.

He was only worried about Destiny right now!

The Destiny who may attack the Three Dimensional Universe at any moment!

Suddenly, Yang Ye and the other experts from the Four Dimensional Universe looked up. Far above in the starry sky, the expanse of outer space there was trembling!

Something was happening!

Yang Ye frowned slightly, and then he shot up above. He could sense a powerful aura coming from deep within the starry sky!

Meanwhile, Yan Ku arrived by his side.

Yan Ku spoke solemnly, “Is it that mysterious expert?”

Yang Ye glanced at Yan Ku, “You know who he is?”

Yan Ku shook his head, “I don’t, but our patriarch would have known.”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment and said, “Return to Eternal Kingdom and manage your people there. I’m going to have a look!”

He transformed into a ray of sword energy that vanished into the distance.

Yan Ku watched Yang Ye vanish while a frown appeared on his face.

If he were being honest, he didn’t want anything to happen to Yang Ye right now. If something happened to Yang Ye, the entire Three Dimensional Universe would have no one capable of fighting Destiny. However, he was very well aware that even Yang Ye would find her very difficult to fight!

The Four Dimensional Universe was practically doomed, and the Three Dimensional Universe’s future depended on that woman’s plans!

…

Yang Ye shot through outer space on his sword, and it didn’t take long for him to stop. There was a huge spatial rift before him, and waves of terrifying aura were ceaselessly seeping out from it!

Those auras weren’t unfamiliar to Yang Ye because Erya had emanated a similar aura!

What was in there?

Yang Ye frowned and was about to go inside when a blazing demon flashed out from within. It looked like a phoenix of legend, but it emanated an extremely evil aura that didn’t seem auspicious at all.

It was the Undying Phoenix of the prehistoric times!

The Undying Phoenix soared through the starry sky, incinerating space into nothingness in its wake. Its flames were so formidable that they weren’t any weaker to the fiery lightning that Snowy had previously subdued!

Yang Ye frowned, “What the heck is that?”

This demon beast was at the Destiny Transcendence Realm at least!

Is it the work of that mysterious expert?

Yang Ye gazed at the pitch black spatial rift, and he could faintly see some pillars within it. There were some people too, and he knew them. They were the mysterious expert and the others!

Suddenly, the phoenix soaring through space looked down at Yang Ye, and then it dived down.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then his sword shot up into the air.

The Sword Precursor transformed into a ray of light that slashed against the Undying Phoenix.

Bang!

The phoenix was forced to a stop, but the Sword Precursor started to burn!

It burned everything!

Another sword appeared in Yang Ye’s grasp. The phoenix shot an icy cold glance at Yang Ye, and then a torrent of flames surged down at Yang Ye!

The flames were so hot that the entire area turned ethereal!

It was truly too hot!

The world around them couldn’t endure its temperature!

Yang Ye was infuriated when he saw it attack again!

Yang Ye shot up into the air, and he swung his sword at it.

Bang!

Countless streams of flames rippled into the surroundings, and the phoenix itself was blasted over 10km away. However, Yang Ye was pushed over 3km back as well. Moreover, his skin was scorched slightly black. However, it only took a moment for him to recover with the help of his Primordial Violet Energy!

Meanwhile, there was a huge injury on the phoenix’s head, and the blood flowing from it didn’t seem like blood but lava!

At this moment, the phoenix was furious from being injured by Yang Ye, and it was about to attack again when a voice resounded from within the spatial rift, “You can’t kill him!”

As soon as the voice finished resounding, a black figure suddenly appeared before Yang Ye.

It was the mysterious expert!

The mysterious expert glanced at Yang Ye, “Congratulations, you’ve taken in the Four Dimensional Universe!”

Yang Ye glanced at him, “What are you trying to do?”

The mysterious expert replied softly, “Don’t worry, I have no ill intent toward you or the Three Dimensional Universe. Our common enemy is Destiny!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “What? Are you thinking about discussing our cooperation?”

The mysterious expert shook his head, “While we have a common enemy, we can’t stand the sight of each other, so just forget working together. However, I hope that we don’t continue fighting each other. What do you think?”

Yang Ye smiled, “That depends on you. After all, I’ve always been fond of peace. If you don’t cause trouble, I won’t go after you!”

The mysterious expert nodded slightly, “Don’t worry, I’m really not interested in you or the Three Dimensional Universe now!”

Yang Ye glanced at the mysterious expert, and then he pointed at the Undying Phoenix, “Keep these demons of yours in check. Don’t let them come to the Three Dimensional Universe or I’ll take their heads!”

“How dare you!” The phoenix roared with fury, and then it ignored the mysterious expert and charged at Yang Ye. Space was incinerated in its wake, and even after it was burned into a black hole, it still didn’t stop burning!

The flames were truly formidable!

Yang Ye remained indifferent. When the phoenix arrived around 1km away from him, the sword by his waist shot up into the air and pierced through the phoenix’s flames!

Bang!

The phoenix was blasted away, and Yang Ye remained motionless on the spot!

The Sword Precursor returned to Yang Ye, and at the instant Yang Ye grabbed it, the flames on it vanished without a trace!

The phoenix refused to give up and was about to charge at Yang Ye again, but the mysterious expert suddenly said, “Must you insist on courting death?”

The phoenix stopped and gazed coldly at the mysterious expert. The latter spoke indifferently, “While we’re not in the same era from the past, there are some in this era that aren’t as weak as you think.”

The phoenix didn’t say a word, but the flames around it were increasing in strength. Obviously, it didn’t really want to stop! After all, it had suffered a loss in the last collision!

Yang Ye ignored the phoenix and just walked away.

The Undying Phoenix stared at Yang Ye as he left. In the end, it chose to attack.

However, the mysterious expert suddenly asked, “Do you want to die?”

As soon as he finished speaking, a wave of powerful energy enveloped the Undying Phoenix!

The phoenix gazed at the mysterious expert, and a pitch black vortex appeared on his right palm. An endless expanse of space could be seen within the vortex!

The phoenix was clearly very afraid and didn’t dare to do anything.

The mysterious expert put the black vortex away and said, “You just awoke, and your strength hasn’t fully recovered. Based on his strength, killing you right now isn’t difficult at all. Moreover, he isn’t our enemy right now, it’s that woman who put an end to that era of ours!”

That woman!

A vicious expression instantly appeared in the phoenix’s eyes.

All those years ago, the Three Dimensional Universe had belonged to these evil beasts, and during that era, humans had been struggling like ants!

These evil beasts and demons had been the overlords of the universe!

However, a human woman appeared one day.

Destiny!Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

It was that woman with a sword who’d put an end to their era, and if it wasn’t for the mysterious expert’s help, all of them would have died at her hands!

The Undying Phoenix fell silent for a short while. In the end, it returned to the world within the spatial rift. When compared to that human man from before its desire to kill Destiny was greater!

The mysterious expert entered the rift. As soon as he did, an evil beast atop one of the pillars opened its eyes. Its eyes were like oceans of blood, and it was extremely ferocious!

The evil beast was the one with the most violent temper among the others—the Vicious Tiger.

The Vicious Tiger spoke fiercely, “Where’s that woman?”

The Vicious Tiger didn’t wait for the mysterious expert’s response and charged out of the spatial rift. After that, it started howling through the starry sky, “Damn bitch! Show yourself! I’m going to tear you apart!”
