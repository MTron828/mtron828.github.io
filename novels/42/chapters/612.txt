Chapter 613 – Sword and Saber!

“10th level Sword Intent?” Yao Ye’s eyes flickered with dense interest, “Not bad. Your Sword Intent is sharp, and it’s even sharper than that thickheaded fellow, Zuo Dengfeng. I never expected that Profounder Continent would actually be able to produce such a genius like you. Brother Luo, just watch the battle from the sidelines. Don’t interfere, otherwise it’ll be an insult to me!” As soon as he finished speaking, a strand of extremely terrifying Saber Intent surged out from within Yao Ye.

10th level Saber Intent!Luo Jun’s expression changed a little, and he hesitated for a moment before he stepped back. After all, all of these monstrous geniuses were extremely proud, and it was especially so for Yao Ye who’d come from the Hallowed Grounds. So, it was within reason for Yao Ye to desire to fight Yang Ye in a one on one battle. However, Luo Jun was still quite worried because Yang Ye wasn’t a weakling at all!

“Watch out for the speed of his attacks!” Meanwhile, the Corpse Ancestor warned Yang Ye while standing not too far away from them.

Yang Ye nodded while dragon scales appeared beneath his clothes. He refused to underestimate any opponent because that was an extremely stupid thing to do.

At practically the exact same instant that Yang Ye’s body was covered by those dragon scales, a ray of white light had flashed before a cut appeared on the part of his clothes which covered his chest.

Yang Ye’s figure moved a little, but he didn’t take a step back.

Luo Jun’s pupils constricted when he witnessed this. Yang Ye has become stronger again?

At this moment, Yao Ye’s expression had changed slightly as well. Obviously, he hadn’t expected that Yang Ye would be able to resist his attack. Yao Ye tightened his grip of his short saber while he stopped underestimating Yang Ye.

A wisp of seriousness had appeared on Yang Ye’s face. Even though that fellow from the Hallowed Grounds hadn’t been able to injure him, that fellow’s attack was really too swift! He’d actually been unable to react before he was struck by it.

“It’s my turn!” Yang Ye stomped the ground with his right foot, and he relied on the counterforce to shoot forward like a cannonball. He waved the wooden sword lightly, and then countless strands of sword qi covered the heavens and the earth as they descended towards Yao Ye.

Yao Ye grunted coldly while he swiftly drew his short saber, and then a wave of saber qi sprayed out and collided with Yang Ye’s sword qi.

Bang!

Rumbling resounded as countless strands of sword qi and saber qi sprayed out into the surroundings, and the ground in an area of 300m around them was turned into a mess. Yang Ye and Yao Ye blasted those strands of sword qi and saber qi away before flashing forward like two shooting stars that collided forcefully in midair.

The wooden sword and short saber collided.

Bang!

A circular wave of energy immediately swept out at the instant they collided, and the formidable energy contained within it blasted both of them back by over 600m.

A wisp of seriousness flashed through Yao Ye’s eyes because his hand was trembling slightly. He hadn’t expected that Yang Ye’s physical strength would actually be that strong. Moreover, Yang Ye’s physical defenses had completely exceeded his imagination. Because Yang Ye’s physical defense was at least a level higher than the Corpse Ancestor!

In the next moment, Yao Ye’s figure suddenly vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Yang Ye when he appeared again. At the same time, the short saber in his hand slashed forcefully against Yang Ye’s neck.

Clang!

Sparks sprayed out as his short saber struck Yang Ye’s throat, and then his pupils constricted. He hadn’t imagined that Yang Ye actually had dragon scales on his body, and those dragon scales didn’t seem ordinary at all. Because it had even been able to stop his Dao Artifact which was enhanced by 10th level Saber Intent. Yao Ye was just about to retreat when Yang Ye’s wooden sword had stabbed his chest!

Bang!

Yao Ye flew over 300m back while an extremely dazzling patch of bright red could be seen on his chest.

Luo Jun had a gloomy expression on his face when he witnessed this scene. He hadn’t expected that Yang Ye would actually be able to injure Yao Ye, so he hurriedly warned Yao Ye, “Brother Yao Ye, don’t fight him in a closed-quarter battle. You’ll be at a disadvantage!”

Yao Ye stretched out his hand and wiped the blood on his chest before licking it. He said, “Blood.... Hahaha! How long has it been since I last bled? I never expected that I would actually bleed in this place which my Hallowed Grounds regards as a lowly world. Yang Ye, allow me to tell you that you’ve made me angry. The consequences of that are very severe!”

“A man should act like a man!” Yang Ye said, “If you want to be a girl, then just snip it off. Why be neither a man or a woman and disgust me? Don’t you know that your current appearance is really disgusting?”

Luo Jun’s eyelids twitched. Yang Ye is really going to completely offend that fellow. But what Yang Ye said makes sense....

Yao Ye’s face warped. The thing he hated the most in his lifetime was people saying that about him. Because it was something that had been his sore spot throughout his lifetime. No one knew that the reason his attack speed was so swift was because he’d cultivated an extremely mysterious technique many years ago, and the first condition to cultivate that technique was to castrate one’s own body....

He’d chosen to go through with it for the sake of becoming stronger. Since that day, he’d transformed from an ordinary genius of the Hallowed Grounds into an extraordinary genius, and he’d risen into the top 10 geniuses of the Hallowed Grounds and became the swiftest saber of the younger generation! But he’d also become a weirdo from that day onward. Because regardless of whether it was his voice, character, or some other aspects, he was transforming to become more and more like a woman.

It was even to the extent that he felt envious and detest when he saw other women....

However, the members of the Hallowed Grounds chose to turn a blind eye to it out of consideration for his strength. Even the monstrous geniuses who were ranked higher than him in the Hallowed Grounds didn’t rashly offend him.

But he hadn’t expected that someone in the southern territory would bluntly tear open that scar of his!

“What?” Yang Ye laughed coldly and said, “Did I say something wrong? You look like a man on the outside, but your character and actions are that of a woman. So aren’t you a piece of disgusting trash?”

“You’re courting death!” Yao Ye’s face warped completely while the short saber in his hand left its sheath. Countless strands of saber qi overlapped together and shot towards Yang Ye. This time, Yao Ye didn’t stop swinging his saber....

Saber qi flashed forward incessantly. Merely an instant passed before almost 5,000 strands of saber qi had appeared here. Most importantly, practically all of them were linked together in succession. Moreover, Yao Ye still hadn’t stopped swinging his saber until now....

The countless spectators in the surroundings were astounded by this scene!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly while he issued a command in his heart. The black sword chest appeared behind him, and then countless swords charged out from within it and flashed towards the saber qi.

All of those swords possessed extremely terrifying might after they were enhanced by Yang Ye’s 10th level Sword Intent, and the space before them trembled violently wherever they passed. 100,000 swords had shot out in unison, and it caused the space throughout the sky above Ancient Domain City to surge! It was an extremely shocking sight!

Bang!

After the swords collided with the saber qi, countless deafening blasts erupted throughout the sky above the city. Countless waves of energy, sword qi, and saber qi swept madly towards the surroundings, and some profounders who were comparatively closer to the aftershock were killed on the spot.

Countless profounders fled madly from Yang Ye and Yao Ye.

“Void Slash!” Right at this moment, Yao Ye’s sharp and ear piercing voice resounded abruptly, and then a beam of sword qi tore through space as it slashed down towards Yang Ye at an extremely swift speed. It was like a sharp blade slicing through decaying bamboo, and it split space apart and created an enormous spatial rift that was over 100m long.

Yang Ye flipped his palm, and then Sword Ruler appeared in his grasp. He stomped his foot on the ground, and the ground beneath him collapsed as he used the counterforce to leap forward. He held the Sword Ruler with both hands as he shouted, and he met Yao Ye’s attack head on.

Bang!

The Sword Ruler struck forcefully against the tip of Yao Ye’s saber qi. A moment of silence ensued before everyone watched with astonishment as Yang Ye’s hands suddenly transformed into golden dragon claws. After that, Yang Ye exerted strength once more, and the Sword Ruler instantly slashed all the way through Yao Ye’s saber qi and descended towards Yao Ye.

Yao Ye’s expression changed drastically. He wasn’t able to dodge in time and could only raise his short saber to resist Yang Ye’s attack.

Bang!

An enormous explosion resounded as Yao Ye’s knees bent slightly, and the ground beneath him quaked before countless cracks started stretching out towards the surroundings.

“So, you are nothing once the speed of your saber is useless against me!” Yang Ye laughed coldly as he looked down at Yao Ye, and he exerted strength once more. Another bang resounded as Yao Ye and Yang Ye instantly shot into the ground.

Clang!

Countless sounds of collision resounded from beneath the ground!

The profounders from both Ancient Domain City and the Exalted Han Empire had stopped fighting, and their gazes had descended towards that hole. Because all of them were very clearly aware that while the battle above between those extraordinary experts hadn’t come to an end, this battle between Yang Ye and Yao Ye would determine their fate. If Yao Ye won, then they had no doubt that Ancient Domain City would be instantly destroyed, and all those who resisted them would be annihilated!

But if Yang Ye won, then what Yang Ye said just now might really come to pass. Even if they weren’t completely annihilated, at least half of all those who weren’t from the southern territory would lose their lives here!

So, all of them had stopped fighting because they weren’t the ones who would decide their fates today, and it was those two people in the ground below!

Ding Shaoyao and the others had heavy and worried expressions on their faces. Even though it seemed like Yang Ye had gained the advantage, no one knew if Yao Ye had some sort of trump card! After all, the members of the Hallowed Grounds had no lack of formidable Dao Rank techniques and Dao Artifacts. It was even to the extent that they had many formidable and terrifying secret techniques....

So, while they were very confident in Yang Ye, they couldn’t help but feel slightly worried.

Bang!

Suddenly, an enormous explosion resounded from below, and then the ground started to collapse incessantly. It wasn’t long before an area of almost 3km outside the city had collapsed.

Bang!

A figure flew out from beneath the ground!

It was Yao Ye!

Luo Jun and the others were overjoyed!

Ding Shaoyao and the other girls instantly turned pale!
