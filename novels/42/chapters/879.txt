Chapter 880 – Wan’er, Long Time No See!

A woman stood on her sword in midair.

It was Lu Wan’er, of course.

Lu Wan’er was wearing a light green dress, and it was studded by sword shaped lotuses. They emanated faint strands of sword intent, and it seemed sharp yet didn’t diminish the elegance of her dress. Besides that, her waist was bound tightly by a green sash. As the wind blew against her while she stood on her sword, her green dress clung closely to her delicate figure, causing her slender and graceful figure to be vividly displayed. It was an extremely moving sight.

Compared to how weak and gentle she’d been in the past, she seemed confident and composed now!

Yang Ye had a complicated expression in his eyes as he gazed at her. All those years ago, she was a weak and delicate girl who didn’t even dare to speak loudly. Yet now, she’d grown to become a person who countless geniuses respected.

Lu Wan’er was looking at Yang Ye while countless disciples of the sword school were looking at her, and most of their eyes carried affection that wasn’t concealed at all.

Lu Wan’er was a true proud genius in the sword school. Not only was her strength at the top of its younger generation, she was gorgeous and usually very amiable. It could be said that she was the goddess in the hearts of countless disciples! The only flaw she had was that she was too obsessed with the sword, and she practically had no room for anything but the sword.

Everyone watched as Yang Ye walked over to Lu Wan’er, and then he stretched out his hand and rubbed her head as he smiled, “Wan’er, long time no see!”

Countless people in the surroundings were petrified.

“He... he... actually touched Senior Sister Lu’s head....”

“He even called Senior Sister Lu by her name... Wan’er....”

“Are we really not seeing things? Are we really not hearing things?”

“I’m going to fight him.... Don’t stop me! I’m going to fight him! He actually dared to do that to Senior Sister Lu! He... I’m going to fight him! AHHHHHH! Don’t stop me!”

“We aren’t stopping you....”

“ How bold of him! He actually dared to try and make a move on Senior Sister Lu! Just watch! Senior Sister Lu will definitely tear him apart!”

“She’ll chop him into pieces....”

The expressions of Daoist Gu and the others had changed slightly as well. After all, they were clearly aware of her disposition. While she was usually amiable and never got angry, she wasn’t someone that could just be offended without any consequences. Because she would kill when she was angry.

“Has his mind been overcome by lust!?” Daoist Gu couldn’t help but break out in cold sweat on Yang Ye’s behalf. Lu Wan’er was the master of the sword school’s personal disciple, so it wasn’t exaggerated to say that her backing was the strongest throughout the Ancient Sword School. So, if she really did attack Yang Ye, then even he couldn’t say anything about it.

However, they were all surprised because Lu Wan’er didn’t attack Yang Ye, she walked over to Yang Ye and jumped into his embrace. She placed her head by his shoulder and spoke softly, “I... I thought you were....” She could never forget this man who stood before her. Because it was he who saved her life, and it was he who changed her life. Otherwise, she would be dead a long time ago.

The jaws of everyone here almost struck the ground from shock when they witnessed this scene, and it included Daoist Gu and the others whose faces had stiffened.

Yang Ye took a death breath and said, “I did almost die....”

She raised her head and looked at him for a short while. Suddenly, she took his hand and said, “Let’s go somewhere else!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she waved her hand, and then a ray of light flashed before both of them vanished on the spot.

Crack!

It was the sound of countless hearts shattering throughout the surroundings!

On a mountain, Yang Ye and Lu Wan’er sat on the edge of a cliff while they gazed at the chasm before them. The chasm was filled with white mist, and it simply seemed like a realm for immortals.

She suddenly said, “You’re much weaker than before!”

Yang Ye smiled, “You aren’t just a little bit stronger than before. Even I might not be able to defeat you now!” He wasn’t being humble. Lu Wan’er possessed 3rd level Heaven Rank sword intent right now, and she was at the Half-Saint Realm. Moreover, she’d inherited the inheritance of the Sword Spirit’s last master and received the full support of the Ancient Sword School. She could be said to be not inferior to him at all!

Lu Wan’er suddenly turned her head to look at Yang Ye, and a short while passed before she cracked a smile. This smile simply made all flowers dim in comparison, and even Yang Ye was slightly dazed by it.

She said, “You know... I’ve always hoped to obtain your acknowledgement. I’d thought that I would never have a chance in my lifetime, but the heavens was good to me. It didn’t just give me the opportunity, it allowed me to accomplish my wish.”

When she spoke up to this point, she turned her head and looked up towards the distant sky, “All those years ago on Profounder Continent, you were the existence that all of us in the younger generation had to look up to. At that time, I hoped that I could head out and help you whenever I saw you fighting with other experts. However, I didn’t have the ability to do that. I really envied An Nanjing because she could fight by your side, yet I could only be a burden to you. That was really not a pleasant feeling!”

Yang Ye smiled, “You’re not weaker to me at all right now!”

Lu Wan’er asked, “You really think so?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She looked at him for a long time before she said, “How about we have a spar once you attain the Half-Saint Realm?”

Yang Ye gazed at her and said, “You really want to defeat me, huh?”

She nodded, “I do indeed!”

“Why?”

“Because you’ll definitely be unable to forget me if I do!”

A moment of silence ensued, and only the howls of the wind here could be heard.

Lu Wan’er suddenly said, “Have you realized it? You have a flaw, and your Sword Dao will definitely be able to rise a level higher if you can overcome that flaw!”

Yang Ye said, “Go ahead!”

She continued, “You’re a very decisive person, and you’ll advance courageously without looking back and never give up once you’ve decided to do something. At the same time, you’re one who follows your heart. Because you dare to admit the innermost thoughts in your heart, and you go along with those thoughts. These are the reasons why your attainments in Sword Dao are extremely formidable. However, there’s one thing which you fail to follow your heart on. Not only do you refuse to follow your heart, you even avoid it. That thing is your feelings!”

When she spoke up to this point, she suddenly moved closer to him and looked him in the eyes, “You’ve always adopted a passive position when it comes to your feelings. Do you know what type of man is the most sad and detestable? Those who clearly want it yet don’t dare to do so and even try to feign being upright! You’re not such a man, but do you realize that your avoidance will cause the same pain to women as those type of men would.

“An Biru likes you, Ding Shaoyao likes you, even An Nanjing likes you. But what about you? You’ve been constantly avoiding them. Don’t tell me you didn’t have the time to care about things like that because that would just be an excuse. Don’t tell me accepting all of them would be unfair to all of them, because that’s an excuse as well. Since you love them and they love you, then as the man in the relationship, you should take the initiative to admit those feelings and not constantly avoid it!”

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time before he laughed bitterly, “Wan’er, you’ve really become quite sharp with your words! Every single one of them strikes the heart. My heart was almost shaken by them.”

Lu Wan’er said, “Am I wrong?”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “You are very right. I really have been quite cowardly when it comes to my feelings. Now I vaguely understand why many sword cultivators sever their emotions. Because all emotions are a shackle! One either has to go along with them or severe them, but I’m definitely incapable of severing them!”

Lu Wan’er cracked a smile again and said, “It’s impossible for anyone to be perfect. Thinking like that is for the best! Anyway, what do you intend to do now? Just stay at the Ancient Sword School?”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “I might not be able to stay in the sword school for long. Because I have numerous things that I need to do. Most importantly, I have to look for An Nanjing, Xiao Yuxi, and the others!”

“An Nanjing is at Sky Divine Hall!” Lu Wan’er said, “According to the rumors, Lou Qianxiao intends to force her to marry him!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I know.”

Lu Wan’er glanced at him and said, “Lou Qianxiao is very strong, and Sky Divine Hall is stronger!”

Yang Ye grinned, “How strong?”

She replied, “You’re definitely not a match for him now!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Perhaps you’re right, but no matter how strong he is, and even if he has attained the Saint Realm, I still have to go, right?”

“I know!” She continued, “You must recover your sword intent now. Not only must you recover it, you must improve your strength as well. I know that you’re very confident in your strength, and you definitely possess formidable trump cards. However, you must not underestimate him, alright? Because it’s very like that you will die if you do that!” Lu Wan’er had a serious expression on her face when she finished speaking”

Yang Ye asked, “Is he really that strong?”

“He can be considered as the stronger amongst the 5 of us!” Lu Wan’er continued, “Actually, rumors say that he can attain the Saint Realm at any time, but he has been constantly suppressing it because of his cultivation technique. So, while he still isn’t at the Saint Realm, even some Saints aren’t able to kill him with ease.”

“He isn’t even 30 yet, right?” Yang Ye frowned, “A Saint at the age of 30?”

She answered, “There’s a type of people in this world that are called Innate Saints. Those who can attain the Saint Realm before the age of 30 are called Innate Saints. I’m not sure if Lou Qianxiao is one, but there really are Innate Saints in the Central Divine Prefecture. In other words, extraordinary geniuses who’ve attained the Saint Realm before the age of 30 do exist!”

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time before he suddenly stood up, “Not to mention that he still isn’t a Saint right now, why would I fear him even if he’s a Saint? I don’t even fear the heavens, so why would I fear a man?”

Bang!

Suddenly, a bolt of lightning appeared in the sky, and it struck straight down towards Yang Ye!
