Chapter 763 – 21 Half-Saint Sword Servants!

The sword energy was like a dense storm that had no gaps in between it at all. Moreover, the sword intent every single strand of sword energy carried was actually not weaker to Yang Ye’s 2nd level Heaven Rank Sword Intent.

There were countless strands of sword energy, and they were both strong and extremely swift. Coupled with the fact that Yang Ye hadn’t expected the Sword Spirit to attack him, so he was caught off guard and instantly enveloped by the sword energy.

“You’re so weak. How could you be worthy of being my master?” A wisp of ridicule arose on the corners of the Sword Spirit’s mouth as she gazed at Yang Ye who’d been enveloped by sword energy, and then she turned around with the intention of leaving.

Bang!

Suddenly, a huge explosion resounded as the sword energy exploded apart. The Sword Spirit’s dark brows knit together slightly as she turned around to gaze at Yang Ye. At this moment, Yang Ye was covered by the Herculean Armor.

He wasn’t able to dodge the sword energy in time earlier, so he had no choice but to instantly activate the Herculean Armor. Fortunately, while the sword energy was powerful, it couldn’t break through the Herculean Armor’s defenses.

“You aren’t the Sword Spirit!” Yang Ye flipped his palm and Lunar Reverie appeared in his grasp. Moreover, his sword intent surged out madly and enveloped down upon the Sword Spirit. However, Yang Ye was horrified to notice that his sword intent couldn’t move an inch closer after it arrived 3m away from her. It was like something had stopped his sword intent.

The Sword Spirit glanced at the Herculean Armor which Yang Ye wore and said, “So you relied on a treasure. You’re nothing worth mentioning. I wonder what made her think highly of you and actually acknowledge you as her master! How truly laughable!” As she spoke, the Sword Spirit suddenly opened her mouth and sucked, and then all the sword intent Yang Ye had emanated were actually sucked into her mouth!

Yang Ye was astounded!

3rd level Heaven Rank sword intent?She possesses 3rd level Heaven Rank sword intent?

The Sword Spirit took a deep breath with a greedy expression on her face, and then she said, “Your sword intent isn’t bad. But the laughable thing is you actually utilized sword intent before me. Do you not know that I’m immune to all sword intent and sword energy? Because I possess a pure Sword Physique, and it allows me to absorb all sword intent and sword energy!

She’s immune to sword intent!Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. He took a deep breath as he exchanged Lunar Reverie for the Herculean Hammer, and then he said, “I only have a single question, are you the Sword Spirit or not.”

“Of course!” The woman in a red dress laughed coldly, “I understand what you mean. That Sword Spirit you knew in the past was me as well, but that was an incomplete form of me. Now, our souls have merged together, and the one standing before you is the true Sword Spirit. Understand?”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a short while. In the end, he shook his head and said, “Just leave!”

A wisp of surprise flashed through her eyes as she said, “What? You intend to let me off now so that you can trap me later?”

Yang Ye was quite dispirited. Indeed, he’d experienced all sorts of difficulties, yet this was the outcome of it all. No one would feel happy upon encountering such a thing.

Yang Ye shrugged and said, “I would have definitely taken many wrong paths on my path towards the Sword Dao if it wasn’t for your help. Moreover, you even saved me from many dangerous situations in the past. In short, while I’ve saved you, it can only be considered as returning the favor. You don’t owe me anything!”

She said, “Do you realize that you won’t be able to execute Heavenrend without me? Moreover, you won’t be able to obtain the last 2 moves of the Tri-Apex Sword Technique.”

“What do you want now!?” Yang Ye was quite annoyed, “You aren’t willing to stay by my side, so what’s the point of saying all of that? Moreover, I don’t think I can stop you if you intend to flee!”

He really couldn’t stop her because her current strength was at the Half-Saint Realm at least! Coupled with the fact that she was immune to sword intent and sword energy, he was completely helpless against her.

She suddenly said, “I’ve changed my mind!”

“What are you trying to say?” Yang Ye frowned. She wasn’t the same Sword Spirit that he knew. She was clearly not a nice person.

She replied, “I need to constantly absorb sword intent to grow and improve myself. Ordinary sword intent and sword cultivators aren’t able to satisfy my needs, yet you are barely qualified. However, I won’t acknowledge you as my master. But we can work together. You should be aware that chaos is about to descend to the world, and it’s beneficial for both of us to work together!”

“What would I gain from that?” asked Yang Ye. If it was the old Sword Spirit, then he would naturally not make a fuss about this. But he had to when facing this new Sword Sprit. Because his intuition told him that she would scheme against him.

“I can guide you in your cultivation!” The Sword Spirit replied, “Moreover, you can learn the other 2 attacks from the Tri-Apex Sword Technique, and it’s even to the extent that I can pass down other sword techniques which surpass it.”

“I have one more condition!” said Yang Ye.

“What?”

“Tell me how to use the Sword Domain!” said Yang Ye. The Sword Domain was the most important part. Because only by truly grasping it would he have the ability to fight those experts that had cultivated for countless years.

The Sword Spirit’s eyes narrowed slightly as she gazed at Yang Ye in silence.

“What? That’s not a problem, right?” Yang Ye asked, “Or even you don’t know?”

“I do!” She said, “But I won’t tell you how. Not for now, at least!”

“Why?” Yang Ye frowned.

She replied coldly, “No reason!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. At this moment, he really wanted to charge over and give her a slap, but he restrained himself in the end. He thought for a moment and said, “My strength isn’t very strong before some of the older Half-Saints. So, I must grasp the true method of utilizing the Sword Domain. Only then would I be able to fight them. Since you know how, then tell me. After all, we’ve known each other for quite some time. Alright?”

She answered, “The Sword Domain you’ve grasped isn’t the true Sword Domain!”

“What do you mean?” asked Yang Ye.

She replied, “I won’t tell you the true secrets of the Sword Domain until I’ve completely recovered!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye asked, “It can pose a threat to you?”

She answered frankly, “Yes!”

Yang Ye gazed at the Sword Spirit for a short while, and then he nodded and said, “Alright. So, according to what you said, my Sword Domain actually isn’t a true Sword Domain?”

“It’s far from that!” She replied, “At the very most, it can be considered to possess the framework of a Sword Domain, but it doesn’t have any material content within it!”

“How formidable is the true Sword Domain?” Yang Ye continued.

She looked up into the sky, and then said, “You’re the heavens within it. So long as your opponent doesn’t possess the strength to defy the heavens, then your opponent would have no chance to defeat you.”

“In other words, the Sword Domain isn’t truly invincible. Because it can still be overcome if my opponent possesses heaven defying strength, right?” asked Yang Ye.

“How ignorant!” She glanced coldly at him and said, “There are no absolute techniques or domains in this world. The Sword Domain’s strength depends entirely on you. If you exceed the heavens and the earth, then your opponent would still be unable to overcome your Sword Domain even if he possesses heaven defying strength. Regardless of whether it’s techniques or any other forces, their true strengths actually fully depend upon the user.”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a long time before he nodded and said, “I understand. I should work hard on improving my strength and not entrusting my hopes onto the Sword Domain. Otherwise, even if I truly grasp it, it would still be useless if I’m not strong!”

“At least you still have some merits!” She glanced at him and spoke coldly.

He glanced at her and couldn’t be bothered to speak another word to her. He started to consider the price he’d paid to kill those Half-Saints from the Fire Spirit Race.

He’d set up a Heaven Grade barrier to trap them just now, so he’d exhausted almost 5,000 extreme-grade energy stones! That really hurt. Fortunately, it was worth it. Because not only did he obtain 10 Half-Saint Sword Servants, one of them was even a mid-grade Half-Saint.

Besides that, he took all their possessions as well. There were 20,000 extreme-grade energy stones, over 30 1,000 year old Firecrystals, and quite a bit of other treasures. In total, those miscellaneous treasures were worth around 10 to 20 thousand extreme-grade energy stones.

It was a windfall!

He gained both Sword Servants and wealth!

Yang Ye quickly found a secluded place and started to refine the Sword Servants. They were very important to him. After all, the defiant profounders were about to emerge and chaotic times were coming. At that time, only strength would be able to guarantee his survival. Moreover, he didn’t just have to possess formidable strength, he had to possess powerful forces as well because he had many whom he wished to protect on Profounder Continent.

The Hallowed Grounds could fall into chaos, but he couldn’t allow Profounder Continent to fall into chaos as well!

The Sword Spirit said solemnly, “You must attain the Half-Saint Realm as soon as possible!”

“I’m not even anxious, why are you?” He glanced indifferently at her and then started to concentrate on refining the Sword Servants.

“You should realize that both the defiant profounders and the Hallowed Grounds aren’t your final enemy. Your true enemy is those fellows from the Outer Heavens. Do you think that you can fight them? I’m not trying to destroy your confidence, but just any expert from there would be sufficient to destroy the entire continent!” said the Sword Spirit in an icy cold voice.

“Would they dare to come down here?” Yang Ye laughed with ridicule and said, “Countless people in this world and even the defiant profounders would be able to instantly attain the Saint Realm if they gained Quintessence Violet Energy. At that time, I refuse to believe the Outer Heavens wouldn’t fear a force of over 10,000 Saint Realm experts!”

“Don’t be a fool!” She suddenly spoke angrily, “You really are ignorant! Do you know what the situation is like in the Outer Heavens? Do you really think the Saint Realm is that formidable? The defiant profounders were all at the Saint Realm all those years ago. Weren’t they still sealed here in the end?”

“Can’t you talk nicely?” Yang Ye was slightly displeased, “The old Sword Spirit was much more amiable.”

“Amiable?” She grunted coldly and said, “You must be dreaming.”

Yang Ye didn’t waste another moment on her, and he placed all his concentration onto refining the Sword Servants.

Just like that, a day passed, and Yang Ye had another 10 Half-Saint Sword Servants. Coupled with the Sword Servants he already had, he had 21 Half-Saint Sword Servants now, and 2 of them were mid-grade Half-Saints!

Such a force was simply capable of sweeping through a clan that had existed for 10,000 years!

“Puppets? Half-Saint puppets? What a surprise!” Suddenly, a voice resounded. Yang Ye and the Sword Spirit’s expressions changed. They turned around to look towards the source of the voice and saw a middle aged man who wore a luxurious robe was standing not too far away on their right.

“How long have you been standing there?” Yang Ye stared fixedly at the middle aged man.

“Since you started refining those puppets. I continued watching because I was curious. I never expected that an entire day would pass just like that!” replied the middle aged man.

An entire day....

Both the Sword Spirit and Yang Ye were astounded!
