Chapter 2520 – Fight First!

Haughty!

Needless to say, Yang Ye was very, very haughty!

He was being so haughty that both Xing Biqing and Ye Zhibei couldn’t help but shoot a glance at him!

Please kill me!

They had a new understanding of Yang Ye at this moment. While he seemed nice and easy to talk to, once he became difficult, he was no different than a madman!

As far as they were concerned, Yang Ye was the type of person who would be nice when you were nice, and he would be terrible when you were being bad!

Yang Ye had a violent temper, especially when he encountered something unreasonable.

If something wasn’t reasonable, he naturally planned to destroy it with his sword!

He knew how to be reasonable, but he was very well aware that at most times, one had to fist use the fist before the other party would be willing to reason with you!

The black robed man before Yang Ye fell silent.

Please kill me!

The person before him was absolutely not ordinary, but was his organization an ordinary one?

He knew he couldn’t accept a loss of over 2,700 World Crystals!

So, the black robed man attacked.

Hiss!

The space around Yang Ye cracked open, and a strong feeling of being torn apart swept through Yang Ye’s body!

Yang Ye was about to attack when Ye Zhibei suddenly took a step forward, and the space in the surroundings flickered. After that, a snow white whip flashed from down above them!

Bang!

The black robed man before Yang Ye was blasted away, but the whip swiftly reappeared in front of the black robed man!

And it contained extremely overbearing force!

The black robed man took a small step back and twisted his right hand. A small pitch black shield appeared in his palm!

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then Ye Zhibei’s whip was blasted away by the shield. Meanwhile, the black robed man tossed the shield forward.

Hiss! Hiss!

The shield spun swiftly as if it was about to slice open the world around it!

Yang Ye was about to act when Xing Biqing stopped him and said, “Trust her!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and nodded, and then he gazed at Ye Zhibei.

Suddenly, Ye Zhibei leaped up into the air, and the white whip in her grasp shot forward like a bolt of lightning.

Hiss!

The whip tore through the air and shot at the black robed man like an arc of light.

Meanwhile, the pitch black shield appeared once more and expanded in midair. It became around 10 times larger! This time, the shield failed to stop the whip, and the whip blasted the shield away before striking the black robed man.

Bam!

The black robed man was blasted away, but that wasn’t the end of it. Ye Zhibei waved her hand lightly, and the whip danced about like an agile serpent that instantly pierced the black robed man’s chest!

However, the black robed man instantly vanished without a trace!

Ye Zhibei’s expression remained calm and composed as she suddenly released her grip, and then a ray of golden light swept out from behind her!

Bang!

A black figure was blasted away. It was the black robed man!

Ye Zhibei was about to attack again when a wave of invisible pressure appeared in the surroundings, and then the space here suddenly condensed!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings with a cold smile on his face!

The person hiding in the shadows didn’t do more and stopped upon stopping Ye Zhibei. After that, a man in a violet robe appeared before them!

The man nodded slightly to them and said, “Oh, the Eldest Young Miss of the Ye Clan, the Eldest Young Miss of the Xing Clan, and Brother Yang. I’m Zhu Yuanxuan, and I’m in charge of this place!”

Xing Biqing spoke indifferently, “You’re the master of this underground trading area?”

Zhu Yuanxuan shook his head slightly, “I’m just an insignificant manager!”

Xing Biqing glanced at him and asked, “So how do you plan to deal with this?”

Zhu Yuanxuan smiled, “I know everything that happened here today. It’s someone of our organization who was tempted by extraordinary wealth, and it’s something our organization should take responsibility for. As for you, all of you may leave.”

Yang Ye asked, “You don’t want the spatial ring anymore?”

Zhu Yuanxuan glanced at Yang Ye and smiled, “We did want it back. However, my Lord said that since it’s you, Brother Yang, we’ll treat it as a gift to you!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “Your Lord knows me?”

Zhu Yuanxuan smiled, “That isn’t something I know.”

Yang Ye didn’t say anything else. He just gazed at Xing Biqing and Ye Zhibei, “Let’s go!”

They nodded. Just like that, they left the street, and Zhu Yuanxuan didn’t stop them!

Once they left, Zhu Yuanxuan pondered deeply for a moment, and then he looked toward a certain direction, “My Lord, we took quite a huge loss today!”

A voice came from the pitch black corner of the street, “Obviously.”

Zhu Yuanxuan hesitated to say more.

Meanwhile, the voice added, “If we didn’t let them go, they may have blasted this place apart.”

Zhu Yuanxuan frowned slightly, “They would dare to?”

The voice explained, “Those two young misses may have some worries to hold them back. Because while they don’t fear us, they don’t want to make enemies for their clans. But it’s different for him. He won’t care about all of that. There is no such thing as fear in his world!”

Zhu Yuanxuan’s frown deepened, “My Lord, you know him?”

The voice fell silent for a long time before it replied, “I do, in person too! However, it was a very long time ago!”

…

Yang Ye’s group didn’t return to War City immediately, and they went to an abandoned hall instead.

Yang Ye flicked two spatial rings over to them.

They glanced at them and were shocked because each of them contained 1,000 World Crystals!

They gazed at Yang Ye with bewilderment, and Yang Ye smiled, “I’ve gotten six Origin World Pills, so I’ve earned a lot already. Both of you came here with me, and you even lent me money and helped, so you should make some too!”T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Meanwhile, Xing Biqing flicked the spatial ring over to Yang Ye, “1,000. We’ll just take back our 500 each. Would we be friends if we have to be compensated for helping? Unless you don’t think of us as friends!”

Yang Ye shook his head and didn’t insist. He just took the spatial ring. Both of their expressions eased up when they saw him accept it.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “You plan to attack and retake the city?”

Xing Biqing nodded slightly, “There’s a spirit vein in this city, and it can be described as the best in the War Dimension. Moreover, some of our businesses are here, and we don’t want to lose them!”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Meanwhile, Ye Zhibei suddenly asked, “Do you have any ideas?”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Would you mind if I say a few words?”

Xing Biqing smiled, “It depends what you say.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Allow me to be honest, both of your cultivations aren’t sufficiently solid.”

They fell silent.

They were both at the peak of the Five World Realm, or they should be described as being at the Half-Step Lord Realm! However, as far as Yang Ye was concerned, their realms of cultivation weren’t very true.

Xing Biqing said, “Go on!”

If it was anyone else, they would definitely be unwilling to accept it. However, it was Yang Ye, so they had no choice but to accept it. Because Yang Ye was merely at the Three World Realm, but his strength wasn’t any weaker to theirs!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “I’m not trying to lecture you. But in my opinion, I’m sure you’ve consumed too many natural treasures. The natural treasures themselves aren’t the problem, even I have consumed them. However, if you consume too much, it’s equivalent to making your cultivation grow rapidly before the time is right. But it’s obvious that the seniors in your clan are aware of the issues this presents. Otherwise, both of you wouldn’t be suppressing your cultivations!”

They gazed at him and waited for him to continue.

Yang Ye said, “I have some thoughts. You carry a clan on your shoulders, and you think about the clan whenever you do anything. That isn’t wrong, but I feel that there should be a limit for everything. If you attach too much importance to your clans, it will make you fearful and hesitant to do everything, and that isn’t worth it. Don’t you think so too?”

They fell silent for a long time before Xing Biqing said, “Are you talking about what happened just now?”

At that time, they didn’t want to fight because they didn’t want to cause trouble for their clans.

Yang Ye nodded frankly, “What I’m trying to say is you are you. You were not born to serve your clans, and you do not live for your clans either. Conversely, your clans will only prosper if you live well. Shackles! You have responsibility, and that is right, but you should not allow some things to become your shackles. Invisible shackles that restrain your nature and heart! Take a tiger for example. If that tiger is raised by a person, then even if it has the viciousness of a tiger, it wouldn’t have the skill of a wild tiger. Independent cultivators don’t have many resources available to them, but an independent cultivator who truly grows into an expert usually possesses strength that’s extremely terrifying!”

Shackles!

Yang Ye saw the shackles that bound them during the incident just now!

It was never wrong to have a sense of responsibility, but if that sense was too strong, it would make someone always be hesitant and fearful. It was like placing shackles on themselves and their heart!

For example, when someone is right up in your face and scolding you, you’re actually thinking about whether doing anything would lead to you getting hit! Or getting scolded by your parents! Or losing the fight and getting beaten up!

Or perhaps, it was like thinking about failure and what to do about it before even trying to do something!

At most times, these shackles were a form of denial, denial of the self!

If the heart was overcome, anything would be very simple before a person!

Just like how Yang Ye was when he was in the Sword Sect. He was still a Labor Disciples, but he wanted to become an outer court disciple. At that time, it was clearly a fool’s dream in the eyes of the other Labor Disciples!

But so many years later, those Labor Disciples had turned to dust, but he was still alive now!

Yang Ye followed his heart. If someone cursed at him, he would dare to hit them. As for whether he could win the fight, who cared? Fight first!

As they say, if you’re poor, then beg! So long as you survive, you’ll still have a chance to make something of yourself!

Yang Ye entered the Primordial Pagoda once he finished speaking. The important matter at hand for him was to help the dragon and the others attain the Five World Realm!
