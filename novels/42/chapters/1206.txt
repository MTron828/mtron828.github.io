Chapter 1207 – You Go First!

Yang Ye spoke with slight excitement, “What do you think?”

Dugu Jian hesitated for a moment and said, “Isn’t that quite treacherous?”

“How pedantic!” Yang Ye spoke seriously, “How could that be considered as treacherous? Just think about it. What would you do if your father were to join forces with the World Devastator Cult and go against our Sword Alliance? You’ll definitely be put in a difficult position. Moreover, you should be aware of our Sword Alliance’s strength. Perhaps we can’t crush the World Devastator Cult but crushing the Dark Sky Sect or Violet Thistle City shouldn’t be a problem at all! Not to mention the strength of the entire Sword Alliance, just I alone am sufficient to annihilate Violet Thistle City!”

Dugu Jian suddenly asked, “How strong are you? I’m really quite curious!”

Yang Ye glanced at Dugu Jian and said, “To be honest, unless it’s an expert above the Emperor Realm, otherwise, if I intend to assassinate someone, no one can possibly stop me!”

Dugu Jian sighed softly, “Let’s talk about that once we get to Violet Thistle City. I’ll do my best to persuade that stubborn father of mine!”

Yang Ye nodded. If it was possible, he really did hope to draw Violet Thistle City over to his side. After all, one more friend was naturally better than another enemy.

...

Two hours later. Violet Thistle City.

Violet Thistle City was at least 1.5 times larger than Doomsday City. The entire city was almost 1km above ground level, and the stone statues of ferocious demon beasts could be seen on its walls. There were lions, tigers, dragons, and even some other strange demon beasts amongst the stone statues. Moreover, all of them emanated a terrifying aura that could be sensed clearly even from thousands of kilometers away.

Dugu Jian said, “My Violet Thistle City is stronger than Doomsday City, right?”

Yang Ye pointed at the stone statues, “What are those?”

“The Beastsoul Formation!” Dugu Jian continued, “Every single stone statue contains the soul of a demon beast, and every single one of them was at the Emperor Realm while they were alive! Even though they don’t possess their past strength any longer, if the formation is activated, then the 108 stone statues on the city walls will form a powerful formation created from the souls of demon beasts. According to my father, it can even trap 20 Emperors!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Your Violet Thistle City is very strong and shouldn’t be any weaker to the Dark Sky Sect, so why is it ranked below the Dark Sky Sect?”

Dugu Jian replied, “Actually, our strength surpassed the 2 sects a long time ago. However, according to my mother, we should keep a low profile and develop well. It’s fine so long as we don’t get into trouble.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Your mother is an extraordinary individual!”

Dugu Jian nodded with strong agreement, “If it wasn’t for my mother, our Violet Thistle City would definitely not be as strong as it is right now. Alright, let’s enter the city!”

Yang Ye nodded.

They’d only just arrived before the city when a surprised voice resounded from atop the city walls, “It’s the junior city governor! Quickly open the gates. The number one sword cultivator of our continent is back.”

Dugu Jian had a slightly embarrassed expression on his face when he heard this, “Err, before this....”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s nothing. It was once my dream as well.”

Dugu Jian nodded, but he had quite an embarrassed expression on his face. He’d always thought that he was the number one sword cultivator on the continent, but after he left Violet Thistle City and gained an understanding of the situation on the continent, he realized that he’d been looking at the sky from the bottom of a well.

Bang!

Meanwhile, the city gates cracked open, and then a cavalry in violet gold armor welcomed them while led by a middle aged man.

Yang Ye glanced at them and was quite surprised. Because he noticed that their horses were actually at the Saint Realm! As for the cavaliers themselves, they were Quasi Emperors. There were around 30 Quasi Emperors here. Besides that, the middle aged man who led the group was an Emperor.

Yang Ye thought to himself, Violet Thistle City is much stronger than I expected!

“Kid, you’re finally back!” The middle aged man walked over to Dugu Jian and smiled, “But why haven’t I heard the name, Dugu Jian, resound through the continent? I remember you saying that the entire continent would be shaking beneath your name once you return.”

Dugu Jian’s face darkened. He glanced at Yang Ye, and he heaved a sigh of relief when he noticed that Yang Ye’s expression hadn’t changed. He turned around to gaze at the middle aged man before he said, “Uncle Ming, let me introduce you to him, my big brother.”

“Big brother?” The middle aged man was slightly stunned, and then he gazed at Yang Ye. Meanwhile, Yang Ye nodded slightly to the middle aged man.

“Big Brother?” The middle aged man glanced at Yang Ye and Dugu Jian as he repeated the same question once more, and he seemed to be in slight disbelief.

Dugu Jian nodded, “I just acknowledged him as my big brother! Let’s head into the city. My big brother and I have some business with my father.”

The middle aged man turned around to size up Yang Ye when he heard Dugu Jian admit it, and he seemed to want to see through Yang Ye.

Yang Ye nodded once more to the middle aged man, and then he gazed at Dugu Jian, “Let’s go!”

Dugu Jian nodded and led Yang Ye into the city.

The middle aged man frowned as he watched Yang Ye and Dugu Jian leave, “He acknowledged someone as his big brother, and it’s even a Saint. Has that kid gone mad from being so obsessed with the sword?”

...

In the city.

Yang Ye was sizing it up the surroundings incessantly, and he was quite shocked. There were many people in the city, and all of them weren’t weak. At this moment, they were sizing up both him and Dugu Jian, but most were sizing him up.

“My mother is amazing!” Dugu Jian continued, “She managed the city perfectly. Actually, my father’s prestige in the city isn’t even as great as hers, on my occasions.

Yang Ye nodded. He knew that he couldn’t become enemies with Violet Thistle City, or it would be a very troublesome enemy. A united Violet Thistle City was definitely extremely troublesome to deal with. Moreover, he didn’t want to put Dugu Jian in a difficult position. At this moment, Dugu Jian was a member of the Sword Alliance, so if Violet Thistle City and the Sword Alliance were to enter into battle, then Dugu Jian would definitely be the one in the worst position.

“Dugu Jian!” Suddenly, a young man appeared in the distance. He wore violet clothes and held a sword in his grasp. At this moment, he was looking at Dugu Jian with a hostile gaze.

Yang Ye asked, “Who’s he?”

Dugu Jian replied, “My cousin brother who’s younger to me, Xiao Yun. He cultivates in the sword just like me.”

Yang Ye nodded. He was just about to speak when Xiao Yun suddenly drew his sword and transformed into a ray of light that shot at Dugu Jian. Meanwhile, Dugu Jian grunted coldly, drew his sword, and tapped it forward. A few dozen rays of sword energy shot forward.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then Dugu Jian took around 10 steps back while Xiao Yun took around 10 steps back as well!

Void Rank sword intent!

There was a trace of surprise in Yang Ye’s eyes. He hadn’t expected that Xiao Yun actually possessed Void Rank sword intent as well. This aroused Yang Ye’s interest and gazed at Xiao Yun.

“Eh?”

“Eh?”

Dugu Jian and Xiao Yun exclaimed at the same time, and then they gazed at each other with a trace of surprise in their eyes. Xiao Yun said, “You’ve grown stronger!”

Dugu Jian sized up Xiao Yun and said, “You’ve grown stronger as well.”

“Again!” As soon as Xiao Yun finished speaking, he was about to attack. However, Dugu Jian waved his hand and said, “We’ll have a chance to fight later. I have important matters to attend to, so move aside for now.”

Xiao Yun laughed coldly, “You have important matters to attend to? You aren’t afraid, right?”

“Would I even fear you?” Dugu Jian said, “Just think about who lost the most in the past.”

“That was in the past, “Xiao Yun continued, “Dugu Jian, let me tell you that my strength improved tremendously lately. This time, I’ll definitely beat you up until even uncle and aunt can’t recognize you!”

He was about to attack when he spoke up to this point, but a voice suddenly resounded from afar, “Yun’er, this isn’t the way to entertain guests. Little Jian, bring your friend in!”

An Emperor! Yang Ye looked towards the distance while Dugu Jian said, “It’s my father.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he started walking forward with Dugu Jian. Yang Ye suddenly glanced at Xiao Yun when he arrived in front of Xiao Yun, and the latter immediately glared at Yang Ye, “What are you looking at? Are you looking for a beating?”

Yang Ye was speechless.

Meanwhile, Dugu Jian suddenly walked over to Xiao Yun and said, “Out of consideration for my uncle, I’ll be a good person this time. I’m serious, cousin brother, keep a low profile!” As soon as he finished speaking, Dugu Jian turned around and walked over to Yang Ye, “Big Brother, let’s go. Don’t pay any attention to that fellow!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then his figure flashed and vanished with Dugu Jian.

“Big Brother?” Xiao Yun frowned, and then he followed them.

...

In a hall.

A middle aged man in violet robes was seated at the seat of the host. He seemed to be around the age of 40, and there was a dignified expression on his face. A beautiful woman in palace clothes was behind the middle aged man, and her expression was calm as she gazed at Yang Ye.

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye and asked, “You’re that fellow, Yang Ye?” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Yang Ye nodded.

Meanwhile, Dugu Jian suddenly said, “He’s my big brother!”

“Big brother?” The middle aged man and the beautiful woman were stunned. Obviously, they hadn’t expected him to say that.

The middle aged man reconfirmed, “You acknowledged him as your big brother?”

Dugu Jian nodded, “Father, we came here to discuss something with you.”

The middle aged man asked, “It’s about Doomsday City?”

Dugu Jian was surprised, “You know?”

The middle aged man spoke indifferently, “Wouldn’t I be a useless father if I was unaware when something so serious occurred?”

Dugu smile with embarrassment. He was just about to speak when the beautiful woman suddenly said, “Jian’er, come over here!”

Dugu Jian glanced at Yang Ye, and Yang Ye nodded with a smile on his face. There was a flash of an apologetic gaze in Dugu Jian’s eyes before he walked over to the beautiful woman. He pointed at Yang Ye and started to speak with the woman in a low voice.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye, “I heard you kill Emperors like dogs?”

Yang Ye said, “More or less!”

The middle aged man replied, “I don’t really believe it!”

Yang Ye said, “I came here to discuss something with City Governor Dugu.”

The middle aged man replied, “I want to see how strong you are!”

Yang Ye glanced at him and said, “Then make your move!”

“You think you’re worthy of making uncle attack you?” Suddenly, Xiao Yun walked in, and he walked over to Yang Ye before he said, “Dugu Jian is getting worse as time passes. He actually acknowledged a Saint as his big brother!”

He turned around to gaze at Dugu Jian at this point, and he said, “Don’t tell anyone that you’re my cousin brother anymore. I can’t afford to suffer such humiliation!”

Dugu Jian was speechless.

Yang Ye glanced at Xiao Yun, and then he gazed at the middle aged man, “You want him to fight me?”

The middle aged man said, “You wouldn’t be unable to fight him, right?”

Yang Ye nodded slightly and gazed at Xiao Yun, “Make your move!”

“You go first!” Xiao Yun spoke coldly, “Otherwise, you wouldn’t have the chance to make a move!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, Dugu Jian shook his head and spoke softly, “Cousin brother, you have my prayers.”
