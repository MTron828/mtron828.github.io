Chapter 350 – Conflict!

“Infuriate you?” The woman on the right laughed coldly and spoke with disdain. “What qualifications do you have to make us infuriate you? You’re just a tiny profounder at the King Realm. Do you think you’re the three outstanding geniuses of the central territory? Infuriate you? How truly laughable!”

“Exactly!” The woman with a mole on the corner of her mouth spoke with disdain as well. “Bumpkin, since you’re so insensible, then we’ll teach you a lesson today. An invite is required in order to auction something or purchase something in our Treasure Gathering Room. Understand? Do you even have one? You don’t, right!? Besides that, has any one of the monstrous geniuses who came to the Treasure Gathering Room not given us sisters a gift? Don’t act so surprised! We wouldn’t accept it even if you want to give us a gift. All the profounders from the southern territory are poor like beggars. The last profounder from the southern territory actually intended to give us 300 energy stones. 300 energy stones! Haha! Do we look like beggars?”

Yang Ye finally came to an understanding. In the beginning, he thought that someone had instructed them to infuriate him and set a trap for him to jump into. But now it would seem like it wasn’t like that at all. The reason they’d acted in this way was merely that he was a profounder from the southern territory....

In the past, he’d constantly heard about how low the state of profounders from the southern territory was within Ancient Domain City, and he didn’t think anything about it at that time. But now, he’d experienced it.

Yang Ye glanced at them before he turned around and walked away. He would naturally not make a fuss about it with people who looked down upon others. Of course, it was mainly because he hoped to obtain energy stones as soon as possible because the improvement of his strength was the most important. He truly didn’t want to waste his time arguing with them!

When she saw Yang Ye turn around and leave, the woman with a mole on the corner of her mouth grunted with disdain and said, “Every single one of these profounders from the southern territory doesn’t just have trash levels of strength, they actually don’t even know how to act. Could it be that they didn’t have parents to bring them up?”

Yang Ye suddenly stopped moving, and then he turned around to gaze at the woman who’d just spoke. The latter laughed coldly when she saw this, and then she provoked. “What? Could it be that you intend to attack me? Come on, I’m standing right here. Let’s see if you dare! Trust me, the Treasure Gathering Room will annihilate your whole family if you dare to touch me!”

“You know....” Yang Ye walked slowly towards her as he said, “If you insult me, then I would treat you like a mad dog while I’m in a good mood. But you should have never spoken about my mother. If it’s related to my mother, it doesn’t matter if you’re a mad dog, I would kill you again even if you’re already dead!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s wrist twisted, and then a strand of violet light flashed and instantly arrived in front of A’Xiu. A’Xiu’s countenance instantly turned pale when she saw this light that was swift like a flash of lightning, and her eyes were filled with astonishment.

She hadn’t imagined that this ant-like profounder from the southern territory would actually dare to attack her in Ancient Domain City, and it was even right in front of the Treasure Gathering Room. Even more shocking to her was that his strength was actually so terrifying! She was a seventh rank King Realm expert at any rate, but she wasn’t even able to resist this attack....

Right at this moment, when the strand of violet light was only a few centimeters away from A’Xiu’s neck, a strand of profound energy had suddenly shot over and instantly blasted onto Yang Ye’s attack. A light bang resounded before both of them exploded apart. Because the explosion was too close to A’Xiu, the residual force from the attacks had swept towards her and instantly mangled her face.

“AH!!” An extremely miserable and shrill cry suddenly resounded.

The other woman at the side was stunned when she saw A’Xiu’s mangled face!

Yang Ye paid no attention to the two women because a middle aged man had appeared here. Yang Ye flipped his palm upon noticing the middle aged man, and then a sword appeared in his grasp. After that, the profound energy within him surged while a strand of flame silently appeared on his sword. The reason he’d done all of this was that this middle aged man was at least a Spirit Realm expert because Yang Ye wasn’t able to see through the middle aged man’s cultivation at all!

When the woman with a mole on the corner of her mouth saw the middle aged man, a savage expression instantly appeared on her mangled face, and she cried out in a frenzied state. “Manager Lian, kill him! Kill him! Kill him!!”

Meanwhile, the other woman had recovered from her shock, and she hurriedly said, “Manager Lian, he looked down upon our Treasure Gathering Room and openly attacked us here, causing A’Xiu to suffer such injuries. Manager Lian, please uphold justice for A’Xiu!”

The middle aged man suddenly shouted in a deep voice. “Shut your mouth!”

Both of them were shocked, and their eyes were filled with bewilderment. The woman called A’Xiu intended to say something, but she instantly shut her mouth upon noticing the middle aged man’s icy cold gaze.

The middle aged man glanced coldly at the two women, and then he turned to look at Yang Ye and said, “Young Master Yang, these two servants didn’t know any better and offended Young Master Yang. Please do forgive their errors!”

“You recognize me?” Yang Ye frowned as he spoke these words.

“Of course!” The middle aged man nodded and said, “Young Master Yang fought the geniuses of the devil, nether, and demon territories by yourself outside Ancient Domain City and brought honor to our human race. Some time ago, you even passed through the Heaven Entrance. So, how could anyone in Ancient Domain City be unaware of you?”

Meanwhile, A’Xiu and the other woman spoke simultaneously with shock. “He’s Yang Ye!”

This name, Yang Ye, was actually very famous in Ancient Domain City. It was for none other than because Yang Ye had passed through the Heaven Entrance. After all, amongst the profounders that had come to Ancient Domain City this time, only a handful had been able to pass through the Heaven Entrance and every single one of them was a genius amongst geniuses! Besides that, Yang Ye had once fought the terrifying experts of the other territories. Moreover, Yang Ye was a sword cultivator, and he was even one who’d comprehended Sword Intent....

So, Yang Ye was rather famous amongst the human profounders. However, usually paid no attention to all of this and didn’t care at all. So, he was slightly surprised when he realized that the middle aged man actually recognized him!

Meanwhile, the middle aged man suddenly said, “Young Master Yang, my Madam requests a meeting!”

“Your Madam?”

The middle aged man nodded and said, “The owner of the Treasure Gathering Room!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“What does she want?”

The middle aged man shook his head and said, “I don’t know. But the Madam said that perhaps she’ll be able to help Young Master Yang with some things if you meet with her!”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment, and then he glanced at the two women. Their hearts instantly turned cold from this, and they couldn’t help but take a step back.

The middle aged man took a long glance at Yang Ye when he saw this scene, and then he said, “A’Xiu, A’Lian. From today onward, both of you don’t belong to the Treasure Gathering Room anymore. Moreover, you’re prohibited from residing in Ancient Domain City. Your fate is entirely dependent on your fortune!”

Their countenances instantly turned ghastly pale upon hearing this. These two conditions could be said to be equivalent to Manager Lian intending to give them no way to survive!

He paid no further attention to them, and he gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Young Master Yang, are you satisfied?”

“No!” Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Your actions will definitely make them resent me. I don’t like potential enemies, even if these enemies are some weaklings that aren’t a threat to me. I just don’t like it. I like to annihilate all my enemies and eliminate all threats before they come to pass!”

“I’m sorry!” The middle aged man said, “They’d been within the Treasure Gathering Room for a few dozen years in the end, so killing them would disappoint the others! Moreover, they were once the Madam’s servant girls, so I can’t make the decision!”

Yang Ye gazed at the middle aged man and chuckled, and then he shrugged and said, “Since it’s like that, then let’s go see your Madam!”

The middle aged man glanced at Yang Ye before he nodded, and then he led Yang Ye in the building.

Once Yang Ye and the middle aged man left, A’Xiu suddenly cried out in a frenzy. “A’Lian, I want to kill him! I want to kill him! How would I make an appearance in public from now on? How would I? A’Lian, I want to kill him! You must help me!”

“Let’s go to the Northern An Clan!” said A’Lian in a low voice.

“The Northern An Clan?” A’Xiu cried out involuntarily. “Have you gone mad? The Madam will kill us if we do that!”

“Isn’t she killing us right now?” A’Lian said coldly, “Just for the sake of a so-called genius, she completely disregarded the two of us who have been by her side for a few dozens years. Since she’s heartless, then she can’t blame us for being disloyal!”

A’Xiu pondered deeply for a moment, and then she gritted her teeth and said, “Alright, let’s go to the Northern An Clan!”

...

Yang Ye met the Madam whom the middle aged man had spoke of in a hall. Actually, it was a bit too much to call her a madam. Because this woman before him wasn’t old at all. If she handed pinned her hair up into a bun and dressed like a woman, then it wouldn’t be exaggerated to consider her a woman in her twenties!

The woman in palace clothes smiled as she said, “Young Master Yang, please take a seat!”

Yang Ye didn’t try to act polite and sat in front of her. After that, he said, “Madam has probably invited me here because you have business to discuss with me, right?”

“There’s no rush for that!” The woman smiled, and then she glanced at the middle aged man and said, “Lian Cheng, how long have A’Xiu and A’Lian been by my side?”

The middle aged man’s heart shook, and he said, “29 years!”

The woman nodded, and then she said, “Those two little girls have been by my side for 29 years, and I’ve never taken them to be outsiders. However, I never expected that it was exactly this which made them become proud from being favored by me, and they became insatiably greedy people. Out of consideration for our relationship in the past, I turned a blind eye to all of that. Just like the incident from before, I’d intended to let them live a long and comfortable life even if I had to offend Young Master Yang. Unfortunately, they’ve chosen to head to the Northern An Clan!”

Right at this moment, a masked man walked into the hall with two heads in his hands. Yang Ye frowned when he saw these heads because it was exactly the heads of those two women in front of the Treasure Gathering Room.

The woman waved her hand, and then the masked man withdrew himself from the hall. After that, she said, “If they’re one of my own, then I would shoulder even the worst mistakes for them. After all, they’re one of my own. However, when they chose to become my enemies, then there’s nothing I can do about it!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she puckered her mouth and smiled before she said, “Young Master Yang, what do you think?”

Is she trying to make a show of strength to me?
