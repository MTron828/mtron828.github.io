Chapter 2709 – Justice!

She glanced at Yang Ye and shook her head, “I grow increasingly disappointed in you.”

Yang Ye laughed coldly, “Can I say a few words before you kill me?”

She nodded slightly, “Of course. After all, they did choose you, so I have to give them some face!”

Yang Ye walked over to her, “Tell me, does this world belong to you, or to all living beings?”

She remained silent for a short while before she replied, “All living beings.”

Yang Ye said, “Then allow me to ask another question. How different are you from the Heaven Dao of the past?”

She chuckled, “You think I’m bullying all living things?”

Yang Ye replied with a question, “Aren’t you?”

She smiled and remained silent.

Yang Ye continued, “All four of you, including the woman in black and white were once supreme existences. You think you’re gods, and you think that this world exists because you’ve protected it. So, you think that you possess absolute authority over this world. It’s even to the extent that you think all living things are only able to survive because of you. You think of yourself as a god that stands above all living things!”

She grinned, “And?”

Yang Ye continued, “I think you’re wrong!”

She grinned, “Interesting. Let me hear it then.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “You set up a barrier, and that barrier is the Destiny Realm. Anyone who attains it will be killed by you. Let me ask you this, how different is that from what the Heaven Dao of the past used to do?”

She chuckled and sat back on her seat. After that, she waved her hand, and the board Yang Ye slashed into bits was whole once more.

Yang Ye sat before her, and she glanced at him with a smile on her face, “The strong set the rules, understand?”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “The strong do as they please, and the weak pay with their lives.”

She smiled, “You have killed quite a few yourself!”

Yang Ye replied, “I have a clear conscience!”

She grinned, “Me too!”

Yang Ye gazed at her and gave up.

Just as the woman in white had said, it was impossible to reason with someone who was much, much stronger!

The strong would never reason with the weak!

She glanced at the Go board. It was an ongoing game. Obviously, someone had been playing it.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “One last thing. You’ve been killing for so many years, but what is the outcome of that?”

She replied, “The outcome is this world still exists. Even if the world considers me their greatest enemy, so what? I think it’s right, so it is right. Thus, there is no problem.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and smiled, “Isn’t that how you do things too?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

She smiled, “What? Are you not going to say anything?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m no match for you, so whatever I say won’t change anything; if I can defeat you, then there’s nothing to say.”

She gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and smiled, “You’re not that terrible.”

She glanced at the sword by the board and asked, “Do you know its name?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

She replied, “Justice, to uphold justice for the heavens. Everything you just said isn’t wrong. We did go to some extremes while protecting this world. But trust me, we are very helpless at many times. Our 3rd once went to the Past Life. She wanted to change the way cultivators thought, and she chose to start with them. Unfortunately, I’m sure you know what the outcome was.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Let’s talk about our 4th, the one you call the woman in black. Do you know why she’s so fond of killing Destiny Realm cultivators?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

The woman smiled, “A very, very long time ago, countless Destiny Realm experts of that era converged together and made some kind of Defiance Formation. They used innumerable secret techniques to make it work, including sacrificing living people, a lot of them too. So many that it would exceed your imagination. As for their goal? It was to kill us. Practically all the Destiny Realm experts of that era were annihilated!”

Yang Ye remained silent.

She chuckled, “You don’t know many things. However, you should know that there are unknown existences beyond the Three Dimensional Universe, and the unknown is watching the Three Dimensional Universe. Actually, it’s normal. Big fish feed on small fish, and small fish feed on shrimp. It is the law of the world. You notice when we slaughter Destiny Realm cultivators, but you do not know what would happen if they are allowed to live.”

She glanced at Snowy who was on Yang Ye’s shoulder and continued, “Let me give you another example. That little fellow on your shoulder almost slaughtered the entire universe once. Besides sprites and some other spirit beasts, she planned to kill everything. Do you know why the True Dragon Clan and other ancient clans of demon beasts are so rare now? It’s closely linked to her.”

Snowy blinked, and then she pointed at herself. She was asking if she was really that strong!

The woman chuckled and continued, “As for that Evil Beast of yours, she devoured the evil of the world to become strong. Do you know what that means? She wanted to devour anyone with evil thoughts and strengthen herself. Besides the two of them, there are some other mysterious existences that were born with this universe. Like the Phantom of All, the Endless Divine Tree, the Nether Paramita Flower… They came into existence with the world, and all of them are extremely formidable… and insane.”

Yang Ye remained silent.

The woman smiled, “Little fellow, what we face is far more than what you can see or imagine. Do you know how chaotic this world would be without us? The worse outcome would be that the entire world would collapse because of them.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while and said, “Looks like I’m not qualified at all.”

She tapped the sword in her grasp, “You are right. We killed many, and while some of them deserved death, some Destiny Realm cultivators didn’t deserve death. Many who died were just innocents. However, the final outcome is a good one.”

She gazed at Yang Ye, “I’m dissatisfied with you because you’re easily swayed by your emotions, and these emotions of yours are just minor emotions. They are selfish emotions.”

She stood up and walked to the side, and then she looked down and said, “Do you have any requests before you die?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time. In the end, he suddenly started laughing, “I still think you’re wrong.”

She shook her head, “I don’t want to discuss that.”

Yang Ye walked over to her side, “Your initial intention was a good one, but you’ve made some mistakes. But as far as you’re concerned, these mistakes aren’t mistakes because the overall outcome is correct… Of course, I know that nothing I say will change anything if I can’t crush you completely. The strong have the last say!”

At this moment, he truly understood the four personalities of the four forms of Destiny.

She glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Actually, choosing you was a mistake of theirs. Now, I will rectify their mistake myself.”

She waved her right hand, and Justice flew into her grasp. She pointed it at Yang Ye, “Come! I’ll let you die with some dignity.”

Yang Ye drew his sword.

He would never just stand there and wait for death to arrive!

Even if he was facing the most terrifying existence in the Three Dimensional Universe!

Yang Ye swung his sword!

This attack was courageous and fearless!

He was a sword cultivator, and that was how sword cultivators should be. No matter how strong his opponent was, Yang Ye dared to draw his sword.

The only aggrieving part was that he’d delivered himself to his enemy this time!

Yang Ye’s sword shot forward very swiftly. It was decisive and utterly devoid of any hesitation!

Meanwhile, the woman drew her sword.

Her attack seemed very ordinary, extremely even. It was very natural too, like the attack always existed in the world. No, it was like her attack was already there before the world was even created.

That was what Yang Ye felt!

It contained too, too many things, yet it also seemed like it contained nothing. It was just that ordinary!

Defeated!

It was defeat without the slightest suspense!

At the instant Yang Ye’s sword shot forward, her sword was against his forehead. He didn’t even know how it arrived before his forehead.

Moreover, he felt his sword and Sword Dao being suppressed!

Utterly suppressed!

She still had a smile on her face like she was facing a friend, but she didn’t hesitate at all.

Her sword stabbed forward!

Suddenly, Snowy grabbed Justice.

Snowy glared angrily at her while holding on tightly to the sword. She was madly devouring the sword sprite within it.

The woman shook her head, “You shouldn’t exist either.”

As soon as she said that, she waved her right hand gently, and her sword stabbed into Snowy’s stomach!

Snowy’s eyes opened wide while her paws gradually loosened. A moment later, the spirit energy within her surged out like a balloon that had a whole in it.

In an instant, the world dimmed down.

Meanwhile, Snowy’s body was rapidly turning ethereal at a visible rate.

Yang Ye was stunned, and then his entire body turned blood red as he howled with fury, “NO!”

He grabbed Snowy in his arms, and as he watched her gradually turn ethereal, it was like his entire soul had been pulled out of him.

Snowy stretched out her paw as she gazed at Yang Ye with slight fear and anxiety. Of course, she mostly just wanted a hug.

Yang Ye hugged her. At this moment, his mind had gone blank!

“AH!” Yang Ye suddenly gazed at the woman and howled with fury, “What did she do wrong? What did she do wrong? She didn’t harm this world! AH!!”

Boom!

In an instant, Yang Ye’s body started to burn!

Boom!

Another strand of flames appeared on Yang Ye!

His sword intent and slaughter intent were burning!

Boom! Boom!

The space all around the mountain peak was covered by two strands of flames, and then space started to ripple!

His dual domains were burning!Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

However, that wasn’t the end of it.

Boom!

A torrent of blood red flames emerged from Yang Ye.

His soul was burning!
