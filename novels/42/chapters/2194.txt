Chapter 2195 – I’ll Protect Them!

This battle allowed Yang Ye to realize a problem.

His strength wasn’t sufficient! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Presently, it was quite difficult for him to kill a progenitor. Moreover, Shao Siyou was even injured. If she wasn’t injured, then not to mention killing her, even surviving would be a problem for him!

Strength!

A long time passed before Yang Ye turned around and left.

Not long after Yang Ye left, a woman appeared where he’d been standing.

It was Shao Siyou.

Her face was absolutely gloomy as she gazed in the direction Yang Ye had left toward.

There was an extremely deep injury on her palm.

Yang Ye’s strength had far surpassed her expectations. While Yang Ye couldn’t kill her now, she couldn’t do anything to him either!

A progenitor was helpless against a Sage!

It was quite laughable!

But that was the truth!

A long time passed before she spoke softly, “He can’t be allowed to continue growing!”

He had a sense of terror this time.

…

After the god race left, the large universe welcomed a trace of peace. However, the negative influence of the End Times was still present.

The worst among all the races was the human race.

Presently, the human race was the target of all the other races when it came to plundering. Countless experts traveled to the human race to plunder, and the human race didn’t fight back. So, the Human Dimension had fallen completely. At this time, someone revealed that Yang Ye was in Void Spirit Continent, so countless humans started to flee there.

Hope!

As far as the humans were concerned, it was their final hope.

Yang Ye had shown himself in Dawn City, and just a single strand of his sword energy made no expert dare to step foot into the city.

So, the only person in the human race who could instill fear or even terror in the Alliance of All was Yang Ye!

Void Spirit Continent!

Regardless of whether there was spirit energy there!

All that mattered was survival!

Just like that, countless human cultivators fled incessantly to Void Spirit Continent.

Void Spirit Continent, in the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground while forming a seal with his hands, and his entire body emanated a red glow.

Slaughter intent!

After his slaughter intent attained the Progenitor Realm, it was actually quite unstable. It was unstable because of his cultivation. He was just at the Sage Realm, but his slaughter intent was in the Progenitor Realm. Their realms didn’t match.

Because of that, it made him frequently affected by his slaughter intent to the point of only wanting to kill!

While he really wanted to kill, he didn’t want to be enslaved by that desire to kill.

Now, he was fortifying his Sword Heart, because a strong Sword Heart would make him impossible to be enslaved by slaughter intent. Moreover, he would be able to gain better control over his slaughter intent. If he could truly control it, its might would rise a level higher!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

More and more were arriving on Void Spirit Continent, and all of them traveled to Void Spirit City.

Void Spirit City was the city Yang Ye and the others resided in. While it was in a state of ruin now, countless people treated it as their final hope.

However, they faced a problem!

Would Yang Ye let them stay?

When compared with the Alliance of All, they feared Yang Ye even more. Yang Ye had attained the Progenitor Realm in slaughter intent, so he was like a god of slaughter to them! A person like that would kill for the slightest dissatisfaction.

However, they had no other choice. If they stayed in the Human Dimension, they would either be killed by their fellow humans or the Alliance of All, but they may have a chance to survive here.

Before the damaged entrance of Void Spirit City.

Yang Lianshuang couldn’t help but frown as she looked at the human cultivators. Qin Yu and Situ Tingyun were by her side.

There weren’t many humans before them, just a little over 1,000.

All of those humans were looking at the three of them.

Yang Lianshuang remained silent. She was facing quite a dilemma right now.

Let them stay?

If she allowed it, more and more would come here. If she was being honest, she didn’t want to let them stay. Because they would have more and more problems if she allowed these people to stay. But she knew that they wouldn’t survive for long if she made them leave.

So, to let them stay or make them leave?

“Let them stay!” Suddenly, a voice resounded.

Yang Lianshuang looked over and saw a young girl walking over slowly.

It was Tian Xiu!

Yang Lianshuang glanced at the mysterious young girl before her and asked, “Why?”

Tian Xiu walked over to Yang Lianshuang’s side and replied softly, “Do you really want the human race to be annihilated?”

Yang Lianshuang fell silent.

Tian Xiu looked up at the sky, “There is a form of energy, it’s called the Energy of the Living, and it’s strong beyond your imagination.”

She gazed at the city and continued, “If the human race is annihilated and only all of you are left, you’ll feel unprecedentedly lonely.”

Yang Lianshuang glanced at the human before them and fell silent.

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu continued, “The Sages of the human race betrayed him, but these people in the lower levels of society didn’t. They don’t have the right to make any decisions, so it isn’t fair to make them suffer the consequences that the Sages of the human race brought about.”

Tian Xiu turned around and walked off to the side.

Yang Lianshuang fell silent for a long time, and then she gazed at the humans before her, “Go inside!”

At this moment, countless people started crying.

Despair!

People who weren’t living in the Human Dimension couldn’t understand how they felt right now.

In the Human Dimension, enemies were everywhere, and it was even to the extent that their loved ones may become their enemies too. Coupled with the experts from the Alliance of All plundering throughout the dimension, it could be said that the Human Dimension had truly become hell on earth.

Void Spirit Continent was their final hope. If even this place wouldn’t take them in, then only despair was left for them!

That was why they came here, even if this place may not have spirit energy.

They just wanted to live and escape the Human Dimension!

Yang Lianshuang had quite the complicated emotions in her heart as she gazed at them.

Indeed, many people in the human race were selfish, extremely selfish. But not everyone was like that. No matter what, Yang Lianshuang couldn’t help but feel quite sad from the sight of them!

The human race had been reduced to such a state!

After they obtained Yang Lianshuang’s permission, more and more humans rushed to Void Spirit continent.

Yang Lianshuang didn’t refuse them and accepted all those who arrived here.

She didn’t tell Yang Ye about what she was doing, not because she didn’t respect him, but because she felt it wasn’t necessary. She had this amount of authority, at the very least. Moreover, she believed that Yang Ye wouldn’t really mind either.

…

Tian Xiu left Void Spirit Continent and arrived at the cemetery from that day.

The surroundings were deathly silent and a little gloomy, and it grew even gloomier upon her arrival. An instant later, an ethereal figure appeared above every single grave here.

Spirits of the dead!

Over ten thousand of them!

They gradually knelt down before her.

Tian Xiu closed her eyes, and a long time passed before she pressed both her palms down. In an instant, all the spirits slowly descended into their respective graves.

The area fell silent once more!

Tian Xiu spoke softly, “Wait for me!”

She turned around and left once she finished speaking.

…

In the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye was still cultivating, and he practically paid no attention to the outside world.

Slaughter intent!

He was trying to fully take control of his slaughter intent. Otherwise, he would leave an expanse of blood red wherever he went. He wasn’t doing it on purpose, and it was only because he hadn’t truly mastered his slaughter intent.

The ability to fully control it both in terms of releasing it and withdrawing it!

Yet now, he could only release but not withdraw!

Just like that, time trickled by.

More and more humans were arriving in Void Spirit Continent. From just a thousand, there were tens of thousands now. While there was no spirit energy here, there was no fighting either.

Ordinary people!

Since there was no spirit energy here, practically all the humans here had become ordinary people. However, no one left because of that.

Because this place was safe!

A’Man suddenly entered the Primordial Pagoda one day. She glanced at Yang Ye who was still cultivating. At this moment, while there was faint red light around Yang Ye, it was much lesser than it had previously been. Obviously, Yang Ye was gradually taking control of his Progenitor Realm slaughter intent.

A’Man seemed to want to say something, but she hesitated for a while and didn’t say anything in the end. She turned around and was about to leave the pagoda when Yang Ye suddenly asked, “A’Man, do you need something?”

She stopped, glanced at him, and said, “I want to return to the Barbaric Dimension.”

Yang Ye stood up, “What’s wrong?”

She replied softly, “The Barbaric Dimension has fallen into chaos too. My clan has quite a high position in the barbaric race, but not to mention my clan, even the royals can barely take care of themselves. Especially when the Barbaric King is injured. Even though I chose to leave my clan, my clan needs me now. So, I’m here to bid farewell to you.”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment and said, “I’ll go there with you!”

She glanced at him and shook her head, “It isn’t necessary. I…”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “I’ve been thinking about some things lately. Yu Jing, Qin Chuan, Mad Saber, Ling, and you… All of you have loved ones and clans. Now that all the races are in chaos, your loved ones are probably suffering. So, I’ve decided that I’ll bring all of your loved ones here. While there’s no spirit energy here, it’s peaceful. I believe that they won’t refuse that!”

He paused for a moment and continued, “From today onward, I’ll protect all of your loved ones!”
