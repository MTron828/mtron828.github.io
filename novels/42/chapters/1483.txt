Chapter 1484 - Fuck You!

Translator: InVader

Powerless!

Demon Wu felt slightly powerless against Yang Ye. Yang Ye was like a turtle that he couldn’t crush! He hadn’t held back when he utilized that mirror just now, yet he hadn’t expected the casket lid to actually be able to resist that precious treasure of his.

He really wanted to ask Yang Ye where Yang Ye bought that casket lid because he wanted to buy a few too!

Lian Banzhuang’s gaze had similarly descended onto the casket lid in Yang Ye’s grasp. Obviously, it had attracted her attention. Actually, it had attracted her attention from the beginning, but she didn’t attach much importance to it. She thought it was just a defensive treasure. Yet now, when the casket lid had been able to resist that beam of lightning, she knew that she was wrong.

It was much stronger than she’d imagined. Not to mention Demon Wu, even she wouldn’t be able to gain the upper hand in a battle with Yang Ye.

Actually, Demon Wu and Lian Banzhuang weren’t the only people who were shocked. Yang Ye was extremely shocked as well.

In the past, he knew that the casket lid and the casket itself were very strong. Because even the Sword Precursor was only able to leave a faint mark on it, so it was obvious how terrifying the casket was. However, he hadn’t expected it to actually be so strong that a Dualism Realm expert couldn’t harm it at all.

Actually, if another person were to have used the casket lid in battle against a Dualism Realm expert, it would be absolutely impossible for that person to fight a Dualism Realm expert. Because while the casket lid could resist the attacks of Dualism Realm experts, the aftershock from colliding with such experts was extremely powerful. Any other person would have been blasted to death by the aftershock.

But Yang Ye was different. Firstly, his body was extremely strong. Secondly, he had Primordial Violet Energy which could ceaselessly repair his body. So long as his opponent couldn’t kill him with a single strike or injure him at a rate that was faster than he healed, otherwise he was invincible!

His defenses were strong, and his recovery was even stronger!

He was like a meat shield!

He was a meat shield that couldn’t be killed!

The only problem was that while his enemy couldn’t kill him, he couldn’t kill his enemy either. Moreover, if his enemy resolved to fight him to the death, then he would be exhausted to death. After all, the volume of profound energy he possessed was definitely inferior to a Dualism Realm expert.

Yang Ye understood his advantages and disadvantages well. He never felt that he could really fight a Dualism Realm expert to the end!

But he didn’t fear one!

He had the casket lid, so he could attack and defend himself!

Demon Wu stared at Yang Ye while he slowly clenched his fists, “I rarely suffer failure here, but I never expected to suffer failure at the hands of a Voider. No matter who you are, you must die today!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his hands. In an instant, two huge palms that blotted out the sky appeared above Yang Ye. A moment later, one of them slammed down towards Yang Ye.

Boom!

The huge palm slammed against Yang Ye’s casket lid. The casket lid shook violently and was smashed into the ground with Yang Ye. As for the huge palm, it didn’t stop and continued down into the ground. It didn’t take long for explosions to resound deep beneath the ground, and the ground in an enormous area shook violently like there was an earthquake!

Just like that, the explosions lasted for around an hour before they stopped.

But just a few breaths of time after Demon Wu’s attack vanished, a hand had stretched out from deep beneath the ground.

Demon Wu’s eyelids twitched at the sight of this, and his face was extremely unsightly.

Demon Wu wasn’t the only one. Lian Banzhuang’s eyelids twitched as well. Obviously, even she couldn’t maintain her composure when she witnessed how abnormal Yang Ye was.

Cough!

Yang Ye started coughing after he crawled out of the ground. In an instant, a trace of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth. He wiped it off, and then gazed at Demon Wu, “Come! Let’s continue!”

Demon Wu was at a loss for words.

Continue? Demon Wu’s face was extremely unsightly right now. He wanted to fight, but he couldn’t destroy that casket lid! He’d attacked madly earlier with the hopes of using the aftershock to kill Yang Ye, or even crippling Yang Ye was enough! However, he failed again. Yang Ye had appeared before him again and even sought to continue fighting him.

Demon Wu gazed at Yang Ye for a long time. In the end, he glanced at Lian Banzhuang and said, “We’ll meet again!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot.

However, Yang Ye hadn’t let down his guard at all, and he became extremely vigilant instead. A moment later, he seemed to have thought of something, and his figure instantly appeared in front of Lian Banzhuang. He’d just appeared in front of her when Demon Wu suddenly appeared in front of him. Demon Wu’s palm slapped down towards him.

Of course, it was supposed to strike Lian Banzhuang. However, Yang Ye’s arrival had made it descend upon Yang Ye instead!

Boom!

Just like before, Yang Ye was slapped flying. But Demon Wu was pushed over 1km away!

Cough!

Yang Ye coughed lightly while a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth. His hands behind the casket lid were shaking, and they’d cracked open. At this moment, his hands were covered in blood. Actually, he’d been injured earlier during the battle. Even though he’d resisted Demon Wu’s frenzied attacks, it wasn’t as easy as it seemed. The powerful aftershock hadn’t just cracked open his hands and body, even his internal organs had cracked open!

If it wasn’t for the Primordial Violet Energy within him, his entire body would have been cracked open!

Demon Wu stared at Yang Ye. He hadn’t expected Yang Ye to see through his plan. When he realized that he was helpless against Yang Ye, he’d changed his target to Lian Banzhuang. So long he killed Lian Banzhuang, then killing Yang Ye was only a matter of time. So, he intended to fake his departure before suddenly launching a surprise attack on Lian Banzhuang. But he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually see through it!

Demon Wu gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he said, “Young man, this is between her and me. I’ll let bygones be bygones if you leave. Alright?”

“You’ll let bygones be bygones?” Yang Ye shook his head and chuckled, “Senior, enmity will never end if the chain of revenge isn’t stopped. Why don’t you let bygones be bygones with Miss Lian? Everyone can just sit down and talk, have some time, and discuss the Dao. Why fight and kill each other, right?”

“Let bygones be bygones?” Demon Wu laughed coldly, “How laughable. If I wasn’t tenacious and lucky, her surprise attack would have killed me a long time ago. Can such enmity be forgotten? Kid, you have that casket lid to protect yourself, so I can’t do anything to you for now. But do you really think that you can fight a Dualism Realm expert just because you have that casket lid?”

“I’ve never thought like that!” Yang Ye spoke flatly, “However, I’m very well aware that once you kill Miss Lian, I’ll be the next on your list. Right?”

Demon Wu stared at Yang Ye for a long time, and then he said, “You’re wrong, I’m going to kill you right now. I refuse to believe that I can’t kill an ant at the Voider Realm!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he appeared in front of Yang Ye and slammed his fist at Yang Ye.

Space trembled before it!

A wisp of ferocity flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, and then he lifted the casket lid and swung it forward!

Boom!

Both of them were instantly blasted away. But it only took a moment for Demon Wu to stop his figure, and then he appeared in front of Yang Ye again. After that, he slammed his fist at Yang Ye again.

Yang Ye raised the casket lid to defend himself!

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted flying again, but it only took a moment for Demon Wu to appear before him once more, and then Demon Wu slammed his fist forward again.

At this moment, Demon Wu seemed as if he’d gone mad, and he was slamming his fist at Yang Ye in succession.

Demon Wu’s body wasn’t that strong, and the only reason his punches were so terrifying was the energy of Yin and Yang that he possessed. The energy of Yin and Yang was many times stronger than ordinary physical strength. It could be said that if it wasn’t for the casket lid, Yang Ye’s body wouldn’t have been able to resist Demon Wu’s punches at all!

Yet now, Yang Ye was almost unable to endure Demon Wu’s frenzied attacks.

A Dualism Realm expert that went berserk was very terrifying!

At this moment, Yang Ye didn’t have the strength to fight back anymore. He could only defend himself, and so it caused him to be pushed back repeatedly.

Around an hour later, Demon Wu suddenly stopped attacking, and then he turned to look at Lian Banzhuang. At this moment, she was standing.

She didn’t attack and just gazed at Demon Wu.

Demon Wu gazed at her for a long time, and then he turned around and vanished into the distance.

Yang Ye immediately heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Demon Wu leave. At this moment, he could be said to be in quite a terrible state. His countenance was ghastly pale while his entire body had cracked apart. Especially his hands, even their bones could be seen. It was an extremely terrifying sight!

Moreover, the cracks throughout his body had covered him in blood.

However, all that blood was being absorbed by the Heart of Slaughter within him. Actually, the Heart of Slaughter had been absorbing his blood from the very beginning. But he’d bled too much, and that was why he seemed to be covered in blood!

Yang Ye cracked a smile when he saw her, “I would be dead if you were just a little later!”

Lian Banzhuang said, “I was done a long time ago!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“A long time ago?” Yang Ye was stunned, and then he said, “Then why didn’t you lend me a hand?”

She replied, “I wanted to see how long you could persist for!”

“Fuck you!” Rage instantly surged through his body, and then he raised the casket lid and slammed it at her!
