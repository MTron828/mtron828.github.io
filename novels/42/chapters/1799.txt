Chapter 1800 – Isn’t It A Little Too Late For That?

Peace?

Needless to say, Yang Ye was quite stunned when he heard her. Because he hadn’t expected them to ask for peace!

A moment later, Yang Ye laughed coldly, “Peace? They’re only thinking about that now? Fuck them!”

The Ying Clan had suffered tremendous losses after the last battle, and they needed time to rest and recuperate. So, seeking peace was a lie, and their true intention was to recuperate. Once they were able to overcome this, they would definitely stab Yang Ye in the back!

Yang Lianshuang glanced at him, “You intend to refuse it, huh?”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Don’t tell me that you want to reconcile with them?”

Yang Lianshuang shook her head, “Only a fool would pursue peace with them. I’m not here because of that. I’m here to tell you that I’m going to the Ying Clan in four hours. Are you ready?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’ve recovered. An Nanjing has recovered as well.” He paused for a moment and continued, “Are we going to annihilate the Ying Clan?”

Yang Lianshuang spoke solemnly, “Every single clan has its own trump cards, and they’re only used at a desperate moment. I don’t know what their trump card is, but it isn’t important. No matter what it is, we have to go there. Even if we can’t annihilate them, we must make it hurt to the bone and force them out of the medium universe!”

Yang Ye replied, “It’s best if they vanish from the medium universe!”

She glanced at him, “It’s for the best if it’s possible. Gather outside the city in four hours. Don’t be late!”

She vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he went into the Primordial Pagoda.

Hou Qing immediately appeared in front of him.

Hou Qing had decided to get some answers, “Kid, what do I have to do to make you release me?”

Yang Ye glanced at Hou Qing, “You came in here yourself.”

The corners of Hou Qing’s mouth twitched, “Kid, I admit that I’ve lost. Now, what I want to discuss is how to make you let me go. You can’t keep me here forever, right?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Senior, you’re so strong. If you attack me once I release you, then who would help me then? Moreover, you’re aware about this treasure that I possess, so I’d definitely die if you spread word of it!”

Yang Ye paused for a moment and said, “Of course, I won’t keep you here forever. Once my strength surpasses you, and you’re no threat to me, then I’ll release you, alright?”

Hou Qing’s face became quite unsightly, “Kid, surpass my strength? How long will I have to wait?”

Suddenly, Qiong Qi appeared near Yang Ye. He gazed at Hou Qing, “That’s easy to solve. Hou Qing, your shaman race’s Shaman Techniques and body refinement techniques are extremely formidable. Guide this kid. Based on his natural talent and coupled with your guidance, it won’t be difficult for him to surpass you!”

“A body refinement technique?” Yang Ye’s eyes lit up, “Is it formidable?” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Of course!” Qiong Qi continued, “The shaman race’s body refinement technique is renowned throughout the large universe. Do you know why he has been able to survive for so long when just his head remains? It’s because of that technique. Kid, if you don’t use that wooden sword, even striking him 100 times wouldn’t make a difference!”

Complacency and pride flashed through Hou Qing’s eyes when he heard Qiong Qi, “Kid, he’s absolutely correct. My shaman race’s body refinement technique is the strongest amongst all races in the large universe. Even the bodies of some powerful demon beasts of the demon race pale in comparison before my shaman race’s body refinement technique!”

Qiong Qi said, “He isn’t exaggerating. Even my main body may not be stronger than his body!”

Yang Ye glanced at Hou Qing with doubt in his eyes. Meanwhile, Hou Qing spoke angrily, “Kid, you don’t believe me? Come! Hit me! Don’t use the wooden sword!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “It’s not that I don’t believe you… But I heard that a sword cultivator almost….”

Hou Qing’s face froze, and an extremely unsightly expression crept onto his face.

A few moments later, Hou Qing’s face gradually returned to normal, “That fellow was very strong.”

He was speaking about the Unfettered One, of course!

Yang Ye asked, “Very strong?”

Hou Qing nodded, “Amongst the people I know, only a single person’s attainments in the Sword Dao can compete with him.”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “Who?”

Hou Qing pondered deeply for a moment, “The Sovereign of Man who managed the human world, the true owner of that wooden sword. Moreover, his Sword Dao is much more terrifying if looked at from a certain aspect.”

Yang Ye asked again, “Why?”

Hou Qing explained, “His Sword Dao is without any impurities. It’s pure to the extreme. His heart only hosts the sword. The reason he could injure me was because of how pure his sword was. His Sword Dao is on the verge of attaining the Dao Realm. Or perhaps it’s already there!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “The Dao Realm?”

Hou Qing glanced at Yang Ye, “The Dao is after the Enlightened. It’s the most difficult to attain. Even some ancient cultivators are unable to enter it. However, his Sword Dao does have its flaws. If he can’t mend it, then his attainments will be limited!”

“What flaws?” Yang Ye grew even more curious. Because Li Taibai had once said that the Unfettered One’s Sword Dao had a flaw too. Moreover, the Unfettered One seemed to be aware.

“Emotions!” Hou Qing continued, “Everything in the world promotes and restricts each other, just like Yin and Yang. One is positive, and the other negative. That’s perfection. His Sword Dao is on the verge of getting to the limits of emotionlessness. However, if he can’t sense the emotions in the world, his attainments in the Sword Dao will stop somewhere and be unable to advance further!”

Hou Qing suddenly frowned at this point. He glanced at Yang Ye while a trace of bewilderment appeared in his eyes.

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

Hou Qing sized up Yang Ye and shook his head, “Kid, do you know what’s your Sword Dao’s greatest flaw?”

Yang Ye asked, “What?”

“Purity!” Hou Qing explained, “Your Sword Dao is tainted by ‘emotion’. It can be said that it’s emotion which allowed it to grow so strong.” He shook his head slightly at this point and spoke softly, “Both of you are two extremes….”

Yang Ye didn’t know what to say.

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi suddenly said, “Stop going off-topic. Hou Qing, give your shaman race’s body refinement technique to the kid. I think that he’s suitable to cultivate it.”

Hou Qing glanced at Yang Ye, “He is quite suitable. But how can I give my shaman race’s technique to a human?”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Qiong Qi suddenly said, “He’ll change his mind. Because he has no other choice!”

Yang Ye shrugged, “I hope so!”

He vanished on the spot as well.

In the 2nd level of the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye went over to the pill furnace, “Senior, you need something?”

The Divine Yin Flame spoke solemnly, “Kid, you have to be careful of both Qiong Qi and Hou Qing. You possess a precious treasure of the human race. If news of it were to spread, countless experts from the shaman race and demon race will come for you. Kid, trust me, you absolutely don’t want that to happen.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand!”

The Divine Yin Flame said, “You don’t just have to be vigilant against the demon race and shaman race, you have to be vigilant against the human race too. Sometimes, the human race is even more terrifying.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Senior, I’m still your master’s disciple. Won’t he protect me once I’m up there?”

The Divine Yin Flame replied, “It’s best if you don’t hold too much hope for that. Because it’s very likely that master is in closed door cultivation to comprehend the Grand Dao. If they find out that Master acknowledged you as the next owner of the Primordial Pagoda, then many would give him face and not look for trouble with you. They wouldn’t dare to as well. But the problem is no one knows that you’ve obtained Master acknowledgement!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

The Divine Yin Flame continued, “So, work hard. Only your own strength is true strength, right?”

Yang Ye nodded. He chatted with the Divine Yin Flame for a while before leaving the Primordial Pagoda.

Outside Martial Heaven City, Yang Lianshuang and the others were gathered here.

Yang Lianshuang, Nether Maiden’s group, Wu Ye, and 15 True Realm experts from the Wu Clan was a force capable of crushing the Ying Clan.

Yang Ye glanced at them and smiled, “We’ll wipe out the Ying Clan today! Let’s go!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a ray of light shot up into the sky and vanished into the boundless starry sky.

Yang Lianshuang and the others followed closely behind him.

Heaven Desolation Continent.

At this moment, everyone in Heaven Desolation City was panicking. Not only had the Ying Clan and the other clans failed to crush the Wu Clan, they weren’t even able to kill Yang Ye. Conversely, the Ying Clan had suffered heavy losses. Now, the Wu Clan’s strength was utterly incapable of going against the Yang Clan and Wu Clan.

Based on how Yang Ye did things, how could he possibly spare the Ying Clan?

He definitely wouldn’t!

Om!

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded in the sky above the city. The faces of countless in the Wu Clan turned ghastly pale.

Yang Ye was here!

A group appeared in the sky above the city, and it was led by Yang Ye, Yang Lianshuang, and Wu Ye.

As soon as Yang Ye’s group appeared there, Ying Yu, Ying Qing, and the others appeared in the sky and entered into confrontation with Yang Ye’s group.

Yang Ye pointed at the repaired city down below and said, “Didn’t I tell you to stop rebuilding it? Why won’t you ever listen?”

Ying Yu gazed at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, my Ying Clan admits defeat, and we’re willing to hand over all the worlds belonging to the Yang Clan. From now onwards, my Ying Clan will absolutely not go against the Yang Clan.”

“Seeking peace?” Yang Ye chuckled, but it didn’t take long for his smile to turn ferocious, and then he raised his sword and swung it down.

Hiss!

The sword energy entered the city and instantly chopped Heaven Desolation City into two.

Yang Ye withdrew his sword and looked back at Ying Yu, “Peace? Isn’t it a little too late for that?”
