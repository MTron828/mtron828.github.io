Chapter 2008 – Excuse Me!

The three old men’s eyelids twitched at the sight of this. They hadn’t expected Yang Ye to dare to attack them here.

They naturally weren’t afraid of Yang Ye and intended to attack.

Suddenly, the patriarch of the wind race said, “Wait!”

The three old men gazed at their patriarch, and the latter gazed at Yang Ye instead, “Young Brother, please calm down. My wing race knows how to appreciate its blessings!”

Yang Ye stopped, “That’s not what I’ve seen!”

The patriarch smiled, “Their heads just aren’t working properly right now. Since that person gave this to you, it proves that you gained that person’s trust. You wouldn’t have even come here if you wanted to keep it for yourself!”

Yang Ye said, “Looks like you aren’t that unreasonable!”

The patriarch smiled, “No matter what, we’ll remember the kindness you’ve shown us by bringing this back to us!”

“Don’t!” Yang Ye smiled, “I’m going to the Heaven Dimension now, and I may enter into conflict with them. So, why don’t you send some experts to go with me instead?”

The patriarch’s face froze.

Yang Ye roared with laughter as he vanished from the hall.

Once Yang Ye left, one of the old men said, “Why didn’t you stop him? The Divine Wings are still in his possession. It’s a precious treasure of our wing race, so how can we allow it to fall into the hands of an outsider?”

The patriarch of the wing race closed his eyes slowly, “You’re only considering the Divine Wings yet fail to consider who gave it to him. Why would our ancestor have given it to him? And you never considered why he dared to come here on his own!”

The old man was speechless.

The patriarch opened his eyes, “Chaos is upon us. While our wing race has some resources and reserves available to it, the slightest mistake may cause us to lose it all. As for him, the human race and all the other races want to kill him, but he’s still alive and well. Do you think he’s an ordinary person?”

The old man remained silent.

The patriarch of the wing race continued softly, “He’s not ordinary at all!”

…

After he left the Wing Dimension, Yang Ye went straight for the Sky Dimension.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive at the entrance to the Sky Dimension, and he didn’t hesitate to enter it.

Yang Ye passed through the spatial passageway and arrived in the Sky Dimension.

However, as soon as he did, a few men in armor surrounded him.

One of them shouted, “Name yourself! Do you have a pass?”

“A pass?” Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t!”

The man roared, “How dare you enter the Sky Dimension if you don’t?”

Another one of the men said, “Don’t waste time on him! Let’s just kill him!” As soon as he finished speaking, he shot towards Yang Ye.

The man suddenly stopped when he arrived in front of Yang Ye. It was because a sword was pressed against his forehead.

Yang Ye pressed his sword forward slightly and asked, “Do you have a problem with me taking a tour of the Sky Dimension?”

That man’s countenance was quite pale.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword suddenly stabbed through his skin, causing blood to flow.

The man hurriedly said, “No, not at all!”

Yang Ye lowered his sword, and then he transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

Meanwhile, the man broke out in cold sweat.

One of the others said, “Should we report this?”

The man shook his head, “He’s not the first to enter the Sky Dimension without permission. Reporting this will only annoy our higher-ups, and we’ll be the ones who suffer!”

The other man nodded, “Indeed!”

…

Around four hours later, Yang Ye arrived at Sky City.

A cold smile curled up on the corners of his mouth as he gazed at the city before him. When he left that day, he’d said that he would be back. Now, he was back.

“Gu Cangyan from the devil race is ranked 7th on the Talent Rankings now! The 7th!”

Suddenly, a surprised exclamation resounded from far away.

“The 7th? Wasn’t he just the 20th yesterday? He’s already the 7th now?”

“Like you said, it was yesterday. He challenged 13 experts throughout the night. Supposedly, he’s challenging the 6th, Lin Yuxian, right now.”

“Lin Yuxian lost!”

The surroundings fell silent once these words were spoken.

A short while passed before someone sighed, “Looks like that fellow plans to challenge his way to the top. If he really succeeds, our sky race will become the laughingstock of all the other races!”

The Talent Rankings!

Yang Ye frowned, and then he seemed to have thought of something, and a slight smile curled up on the corners of his mouth.

Yang Ye entered the city. No one noticed he was human because he stayed hidden. After making some inquiries, he finally figured out what the Talent Rankings was. It was a ranking created by the sky race, and it was naturally created to encourage the younger generation of the sky race.

Yet now, a genius from the devil race had come to the Sky Dimension to challenge the sky race’s geniuses. The sky race’s relationship with the devil race was worse than its relationship with the human race. It could be said that their relationship was similar to the relationship between the human race and shaman race. They couldn’t stand the sight of each other!

Now, a genius of the devil race was rising up on the sky race’s Talent Rankings, so it was undoubtedly a slap to their face!

A terrible slap!

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something, and the smile on his face widened.

A moment later, he vanished on the spot.

Sky City, Talent Arena.

The Talent Area was surrounded by an ocean of people. There was a man in a violet gold robe standing in the arena. He was tall, robust, and had hair that hung down to his shoulder. He had a short blade in his grasp.

The blade was very short and only half a palm’s length, but it was very thick. It was at least as thick as two adult palms. It was a very strange weapon!

Obviously, he was the genius from the devil race, Gu Cangyan.

At this moment, many geniuses from the sky race were hurling curses from all around the arena, but Gu Cangyan had his eyes closed and remained silent.

Suddenly, a man in a cloud white robe appeared in the arena.

Someone exclaimed loudly, “It’s Xiao Luo, the 5th on the Talent Rankings!”

Yang Ye sized up the man and nodded slightly. He felt that the quality of experts in the rankings wasn’t bad. Xiao Luo was a See Dao Realm expert, and based on his aura, he was one who hadn’t relied on much external forces to get there!

As for Gu Cangyan, Yang Ye had taken a glance at him too, but Yang Ye hadn’t been able to discern anything. Gu Cangyan had clearly concealed his own strength.

Meanwhile, Gu Cangyan opened his eyes, “Make your move!”

His voice was quite hoarse.

Xiao Luo sized up Gu Cangyan, and then he vanished on the spot. He was in front of Gu Cangyan when he appeared again. An instant later, a few rays of cold light surged out from Xiao Luo’s palms.

Meanwhile, Gu Cangyan suddenly moved. He swung his blade horizontally. It was done in a very slow manner, extremely slow even, and it was so slow that it seemed like a child was swinging it. However, it was exactly such a slow attack that obliterated the cold light Xiao Luo had sent at Gu Cangyan.

At the same time, Xiao Luo was blasted out of the arena.

The arena had a defensive barrier around it. But at this moment, a huge gap had suddenly appeared in the barrier behind him, and Xiao Luo had been blasted out of that exact same gap!

Deathly silence filled the surroundings.

The clamorous noise from the spectators had gone silent.

Gu Cangyan glanced at the surroundings and said, “Tell the next one to come!”

Yang Ye sized up Gu Cangyan and smiled, “Interesting!”

That attack of Gu Cangyan’s hadn’t been slow at all, and it was a type of Law. It was a very profound Law. Even Yang Ye couldn’t put a finger on it. However, something worth mentioning was that Gu Cangyan’s attack was powerful indeed.

Suddenly, a woman appeared in the arena.

Yang Ye was slightly stunned because he recognized her. It was Xiao Qi’s older sister, the woman who’d warned him from getting close to Xiao Qi!

Gu Cangyan glanced indifferently at her and said, “Make you move!”

She didn’t say anything and just flipped her palm. A sword appeared there.

Star Destroyer!

One of the sky race’s precious treasures! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

She suddenly vanished on the spot once the sword appeared in her grasp. At the same time, an arc of light flashed, and it instantly arrived before Gu Cangyan.

Meanwhile, Gu Cangyan attacked.

He raised his sword and swung it down.

Hiss!

The woman’s sword energy vanished, and Gu Cangyan suddenly vanished on the spot too.

Clang!

The sound of metal colliding resounded, and then the woman was blasted to the edge of the arena.

At this moment, a solemn expression appeared in her eyes. She held tightly to the sword in her grasp. The stars in the sky suddenly started to change, and then countless rays of stellar energy surged down like torrents into her sword, causing it to start trembling.

Yang Ye shook his head at the sight of this. Because he felt that she hadn’t improved at all throughout this time. It wasn’t wrong to rely on external sources of strength, but it was bad to overdo it. After all, nothing could be done without possessing the skill and ability to do it!

But her Sword Dao hadn’t improved at all, and neither had her cultivation. But the speed she converged stellar energy to the sword had improved.

After it absorbed stellar energy, its aura grew much stronger than before, but that didn’t make a difference.

That strength didn’t belong to her!

Gu Cangyan suddenly vanished on the spot, and a ray of light flashed. It was thin like a hair because of its speed.

The surroundings suddenly fell silent.

It was because a short blade was against her throat!

She’d lost!

She’d lost before she could even use her strongest attack!

Gu Cangyan lowered his blade and walked back to where he’d been standing. Suddenly, he turned to the side, and he was stunned. Everyone looked along his gaze, and their gazes converged on Yang Ye.

The woman was stunned too.

Gu Cangyan hesitated for a moment, and then he cupped his fist to Yang Ye, “Excuse me!”

All the spectators were stunned speechless.
