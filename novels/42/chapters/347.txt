Chapter 348 – I’m The Sword Master!

Murong Yao left, and she left with regret and helplessness! She knew that the enmity between Yang Ye and the Sword Sect was utterly irreconcilable. Or to be more precise, it wasn’t something that she could resolve!

Even though she was a disciple of the Sword Sect, she had no choice but to admit that the Sword Sect had gone too far when it came to Yang Ye.... Unfortunately, it wasn’t something she could interfere in. Moreover, while the Sword Sect had betrayed Yang Ye, it hadn’t betrayed her. So, she had to stand on the Sword Sect’s side no matter what!

Murong Yao sighed in her heart. What a pity....

After she left, 20 black clothed figures appeared abruptly behind Yang Ye.

Yang Ye flicked his finger, and then two spatial rings flew into the palm of the black clothed figure in the lead. All the others behind the black clothed figure in the lead instantly felt excited when they saw this, and then they hurriedly bowed to Yang Ye and said in unison, “Thank you, Sword Master!”

They’d arrived here since the battle had begun just now, so they were clearly aware of what was within these two spatial rings!

There were both Heaven Rank and Earth Rank Dark Treasures within them.... Especially those Heaven Rank treasures. Most of them hadn’t even laid eyes on a Heaven Rank treasure in their lives! However, Yang Ye had given it to them without the slightest hesitation, so at the same time that they felt excited, they were also moved!

“Sword Master?” Yang Ye was stunned when he heard this method of address, and then he said, “Leng Jun, when did I become this Sword Master they speak of?”

Leng Jun put the spatial rings away as he smiled and said, “It’s all because we didn’t know how to address you. It’s clearly disrespectful to address you directly with your name, so we gave you a title! The reason we chose the title, Sword Master, was mainly because you use a sword, and your attainments in the Sword Dao are peerless!”

“Peerless?” Yang Ye shook his head and chuckled, and then he said seriously, “Let’s not talk about that. Tell me about the improvement of your strengths during this period!”

Leng Jun nodded and said, “We brothers improved quite well during this period. Leng Yin and I have attained the peak of the King Realm with the help of the Icesoul Fruit, and we’re only half a step away from the Spirit Realm. A few more brothers have attained the peak of the King Realm with the help of the Icesoul Fruit as well. However, their cultivations aren’t stable yet. 62 brothers have attained the eighth rank of the King Realm, and the rest are at the third to the seventh rank of the King Realm! However, even if it’s some peak King Realm experts that they’re up against, they can still assassinate those experts!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“How about in comparison with these monstrous geniuses in the Ancient Battlefield?” asked Yang Ye in a flat tone.

Leng Jun instantly fell silent. The ability to assassinate above their realms of cultivation that he’d spoken of just now was merely limited to profounders from the southern territory because all the profounders in the Ancient Battlefield could surmount their realms of cultivation to do battle as well! So, trying to assassinate these monstrous geniuses while at a lower realm of cultivation was difficult, extremely difficult!

“Your strengths are still insufficient!” Yang Ye said, “After you leave, ask them to continue working hard on improving their strengths. All of you do not need to worry about cultivation techniques, treasures, or energy stones. I’ll deal with all of that! However, I want to see results! I don’t need trash! Understand?”

Leng Jun’s heart shook when he heard this. He knew that Yang Ye was displeased! When he recalled what Yang Ye said about comparing them to the monstrous geniuses in the Ancient Battlefield, a strand of coldness instantly arose from the bottom of his heart! Yang Ye’s objective is actually the monstrous geniuses in the Ancient Battlefield.... If it’s like that, then we really are quite weak!

“I need three things!” Right at this moment, Yang Ye said, “The 1st is to dispatch 10 people to follow those profounders who’d returned to the southern territory just now and protect them on their way there. Once you arrive in the southern territory, monitor their every action. All of you know what you should do if they don’t keep their promises.

“The 2nd is to investigate two people for me. One is called Mo Qingyu, and the other is Mu Jun. Notify me immediately if you find them. Remember that you must absolutely be careful because all of you will definitely die if you’re noticed by them.

“The 3rd is to monitor all the top-rate geniuses in the Ancient Battlefield like Mo Ke and Hun You. Monitor their every action and report it to me when I need it. Understand?”

The ability of a single person was truly too limited. This was something that Yang Ye had comprehended recently. Especially in the Ancient Battlefield where he had to possess prompt information about these monstrous geniuses. Because only in this way would he be able to be fully prepared at all times!

For example, if he knew that Mo Qingyu, Mu Jun, Mo Ke, and the others would be making an appearance there when he’d gone to subdue the Ninth Hell Cold Gale, then he wouldn’t have been caught off-guard by them, and Xiao Yuxi wouldn’t have fallen to her current state....

In short, he needed forces of his own, and he couldn’t just charge forward ferociously by himself. After all, he still didn’t possess the invincible strength that the Founding Ancestor of the Sword Sect possessed all those years ago!

Their expressions changed when they heard Yang Ye. All of them weren’t idiots, so they had a vague understanding of Yang Ye’s ambition and objectives! Yang Ye intended to go against the geniuses of all the other territories and was targeting the Hidden Dragon Rankings! When they thought up to here, all of them started to feel excited! Why? Because since the time of the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor, there had never been another monstrous genius from the southern territory who was capable of crushing all the geniuses from the other territories!

Did Yang Ye possess the strength to accomplish that? In their opinions, it was possible. Moreover, he was the only profounder in the southern territory who had a chance! If Yang Ye was able to reproduce the dazzling accomplishments of the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor, then their names would definitely go down in history with Yang Ye. Even if he couldn’t attain such shocking accomplishments as the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor, but so long as he fought his way into the top 5 of the Hidden Dragon Rankings, then they would definitely make a huge mark in the history of the southern territory with Yang Ye!

So, when they thought up to here, all of them bowed once more to Yang Ye, and then they spoke simultaneously. “We’ll follow Sword Master to death!”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “I’ve given all of you my word, all of you only have to stay with me for 10 years. Once 10 years have passed, all of you can decide if you wish to leave or stay. I’ll absolutely not force you. I, Yang Ye, keep my word! Now, go!”

All of them nodded, and then their figures flashed and vanished mysteriously on the spot!

Once they left, Yang Ye waved his hand, and then all the Darkbeasts in the tiny vortex had instantly appeared before him. The Darkbeast in the lead was Xiao Lang who’d stepped into the Spirit Rank!”

“You’re very strong!” He gazed at Yang Ye as he spoke in a low voice. “I sense the aura of danger from you!”

“Haven’t you become stronger as well?” said Yang Ye with a smile on his face.

“Thank you!” Xiao Lang spoke seriously. It was extremely difficult for Darkbeasts to advance in their cultivation. If he didn’t have the assistance of the tiny vortex, then it would take an extremely long time before he could succeed! So, these words were heartfelt and sincere!

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “There’s no need for that because I need all of your help now!”

“Go on!” Xiao Lang said, “I’ve received such a huge benefit from you, yet I haven’t done anything until now. To tell you the truth, I feel very embarrassed!”

Yang Ye smiled and said, “I want all of you to take control of your clans! It shouldn’t be a problem with the strengths all of you possess right now. I don’t just need all of you to take control of your own clans, I need all of you to take control of other clans as well. Understand?”

“What do you intend to do!?” Xiao Lang spoke in a low voice because Yang Ye’s words terrified him slightly!

“You’ll find out in the future!” Yang Ye said indifferently, “If you’re unwilling, you can leave at any time. I won’t force you!”

“Really?” Xiao Lang’s brows raised, and he seemed to be slightly tempted.

“No!” Yang Ye said indifferently, “If you choose to leave, then I’ll kill you immediately!”

Xiao Lang didn’t get angry, and he roared with laughter instead. After a short while, he said, “Yang Ye, I like your frankness. I don’t care what you want to do, all I know is that my strength will improve incessantly if I follow you, and this is the greatest fortuitous encounter in my life! So, I’ll accomplish what you wish when I return to the Grand Myriad Mountains!” As soon as he finished speaking, his figure transformed into his original form, and then he dashed swiftly towards the Grand Myriad Mountains and quickly vanished from Yang Ye’s field of vision.

After Xiao Lang left, Grey and Silver arrived in front of Yang Ye. Yang Ye’s profound energy surged into his Gale Shoes, and his figure instantly soared into the air before he stretched out his hands to rub their heads while a wisp of a gentle expression flashed in his eyes. Grey and Silver were the two Darkbeasts that had been following him since the beginning, so there were some feelings between him and them. In any case, he’d never taken them to be tools that fought for him! Conversely, out of consideration for their safety, he’d chosen not to summon them when he encountered formidable enemies!

So, he was slightly reluctant to let them leave!

However, he understood a principle, and it was that if they continued staying by his side, then it would only become more and more harmful for them as time passed. Because it was very likely that they would lose their ferocity under the protection of Yang Ye and the little fellow. Only battles under the brutal laws of the jungle would allow them to grow stronger! Otherwise, even if their cultivations were to improve, it wouldn’t make any difference to their combat strengths!

So, even if he was reluctant, he still intended to let them return to the Grand Myriad Mountains!

“Haven’t the two of you always desired that violet profound energy?” Yang Ye smiled as he said, “If you’re able to satisfy me when I head to the Grand Myriad Mountains again, then I’ll fulfill your wish. Don’t get happy yet, because if you’re unable to satisfy me, then I’ll ask the little fellow to torture you every single day once she recovers!”

Their bodies instantly shook when they heard those last few words that Yang Ye spoke, and then they howled before they dashed madly towards the distance. Obviously, they were still extremely afraid of the little fellow!

Yang Ye couldn’t help but laugh when he saw them leave as if they were running for their lives. Even though the little fellow isn’t awake, she’s still really respected!

Yang Ye’s smile gradually vanished when he thought about the little fellow, and then a wisp of dimness flashed in his eyes. While the little fellow looked fine on the surface, she was heavily injured. So, she was unconscious just like Xiao Yuxi, and it really worried him!

However, he couldn’t do anything but wait!

Yang Ye shook his head, and then he raised his head to determine the time.

When he saw that the veil of night was descending, Yang Ye’s heartbeat instantly couldn’t help but speed up. Because according to Elder Mu, he had to transfer his lifespan to Xiao Yuxi every single day. In other words....
