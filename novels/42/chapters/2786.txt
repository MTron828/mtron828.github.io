Chapter 2787 – Tanghulu!

Erya glanced coldly at Yang Ye. Yang Ye was a little worried because Erya wasn’t that easy to reason with right now.

If she insisted on attacking him and Tian Xiu, then the situation here would instantly change!

His intuition told him that Erya really wanted to eat him too!

If it wasn’t for those horns, she would definitely hunt him to the ends of the world.

Meanwhile, Erya suddenly moved her gaze away and looked at the mysterious expert.

Actually, she was actually here for the mysterious expert!

Erya suddenly vanished on the spot.

Hiss!

A sharp tearing sound resounded!

Bang!

The area where the mysterious expert stood collapsed.

However, he suddenly appeared 3km away!

Erya looked at the mysterious expert and slowly clenched her right fist. A vicious aura rippled out from her!

Yang Ye frowned slightly because her aura was quite unusual.

Bang!

Suddenly, an explosion resounded in space, and then two figures flashed.

Bang!

A figure descended before Yang Ye and Tian Xiu. It was Qi Bitian!

At this moment, her countenance was rather pale. Obviously, she was injured.

Suddenly, Erya gazed at the mysterious expert and shadow, and then she charged over. Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically from the sight of this, and then a ray of sword energy went after Erya.

Monarch Yan suddenly took a step forward.

Bang!

A pitch black arc of lightning swept out from him. Meanwhile, Erya’s fist slammed forward!

Bang!

The lightning was forced to a stop. However, it wasn’t destroyed by the force of her punch. Conversely, a figure slammed against Erya!

It was the mysterious expert!

Yang Ye appeared by Erya’s side, and a sword stabbed at the mysterious expert.

The mysterious expert decisively abandoned Erya and stopped moving. He pressed his arms inward toward his chest. Yang Ye’s sword stopped just an inch away from the mysterious expert’s forehead!

The mysterious expert’s arms had clamped down upon it!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly grabbed the sword with his left hand and twisted it.

Bang!

A wave of powerful sword intent rippled forward.

Bang!

The mysterious expert was pushed over 300m back, but right at this moment, a fiery red bolt of divine lightning appeared in Monarch Yan’s grasp. He waved it at Erya!Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Watch out!” Qi Bitian’s voice suddenly resounded from behind Erya!

Erya seemed as if she hadn’t heard Qi Bitian and just slammed herself at it!

A head-on collision with the body!

Boom!

In an instant, Erya was blasted away, and fiery red lightning flickered all around her. Countless arcs of fiery red lightning were madly corroding her body.

“AH!” Suddenly, Erya howled with fury, and her voice carried a trace of misery and pain!

Yang Ye’s figure stiffened slightly upon hearing this, and then he turned around and charged at Erya. Meanwhile, a palm slammed against his back.

Bam!

Yang Ye was blasted away. The armor on him was instantly blasted apart. While the armor had warded off most of the force, his entire body and internal organs had cracked open!

A serious injury with one hit!

The mysterious expert was about to attack again when a ray of dark light shot at him!

Tian Xiu!

Meanwhile, Qi Bitian stopped Monarch Yan. However, Monarch Yan’s strength was even stronger than before now!

Of course, it was because Qi Bitian was strong. Qi Bitian made him feel threatened, and that forced him to gradually expose his trump cards.

Yang Ye arrived before Erya, and Erya, who was in great pain, slammed a punch at him.

Yang Ye moved 300m to the side, and then he summoned Snowy. Snowy gazed at Erya and immediately wanted to fly over. However, Yang Ye stopped her. He pointed at the fiery red lightning that was burning Erya, “Snowy, can you get them off her?”

Erya was in an extremely berserk state. So, not only was he afraid of letting Snowy get closer to her, even he didn’t dare to get close to her.

Snowy glanced at the mysterious fiery red lightning, and then she waved her paw. The Sprite Staff appeared in her grasp.

Snowy waved the Sprite Staff, and then the spirit energy in the surroundings suddenly converged. The spirit energy surged toward Erya like a torrent, causing Erya to suddenly stop when she was about to attack!

Spirit energy!

It was of no threat to her!

Snowy opened her mouth, and then the mysterious fiery lightning around Erya started to tremble. They gradually left Erya and fled toward the surroundings.

Snowy and Yang Ye sighed with relief when they witnessed this!

However, Erya suddenly slapped her palm forward.

Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically, and he shot backward madly while holding Snowy in his arms!

At this moment, the expressions of everyone here had changed!

With Erya at the center, space started to collapse inch by inch. At the same time, a wave of powerful energy erupted like a volcano and surged madly in all directions.

It was so powerful that the world dimmed down before it!

Yang Ye shot backward like a madman, and it didn’t take long for him to arrive before the floating city. Meanwhile, the energy had arrived before him.

Yang Ye hurriedly tossed Snowy into the Primordial Pagoda, and then he raised his sword before him. A wave of sword intent and slaughter intent surged out madly from his sword.

Bang!

As soon as they collided with each other, Yang Ye’s figure shook violently. However, he’d forcibly resisted it!

Meanwhile, the energy didn’t stop and slammed against the floating city!

Meanwhile, a huge barrier of light appeared around the city walls. This time, it was made of lightning, and it emanated energy that wasn’t any weaker to the energy Erya had released!

As soon as they collided, the impact blasted Yang Ye into the air!

At the same time, the entire city quaked like an earthquake was running through it.

Tian Xiu and Qi Bitian stopped as well, and the mysterious expert and shadow didn’t attack either. At this moment, all of them were looking at Erya!

Even Snowy had stuck her head out!

Erya closed her eyes, and the scales around her were actually starting to fall off!

Meanwhile, the horns on her head were gradually changing. They were undergoing an indescribably transformation!

Suddenly, the mysterious expert said, “She’s evolving! We can’t allow her to succeed!”

At this moment, his aura suddenly rose explosively!

Rumble!

The world shook violently, and then everything here started to turn ethereal!

Yang Ye had a solemn expression on his face. The mysterious expert clearly planned to expose his true strength in order to kill Erya!

Yang Ye practically didn’t hesitate to toss Snowy back into the Primordial Pagoda before charging at the mysterious expert!

Qi Bitian glanced at Tian Xiu, and the latter nodded slightly. She tapped her right foot down, and a ray of black light flashed!

Yang Ye was the first to arrive before the mysterious expert, and the latter was furious, “Fuck off!”

The mysterious expert immediately slammed a punch at Yang Ye!

The strength of this punch was simply incomparable to any attack the mysterious expert had previously revealed!

A ferocious glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes. Actually, his intuition told him that he shouldn’t go head-on against this punch. Because his body had already been damaged from going head-on against the last punch. So, it was very unwise to go head-on against this punch right now!

But he had no other choice!

Erya was behind him!

Yang Ye tightened his grip on the Sword Precursor, and then he slashed.

The Domain Sword!

A mouthful of blood sprayed from Yang Ye before the punch even arrived before him, and then the punch slammed against his sword.

At this moment, Yang Ye stomped his right foot down.

Bang!

The space below him exploded into bits!

Meanwhile, he relied on the counterforce to forcefully stop himself from being blasted away. However, forcibly stopping himself like that caused a few more mouthfuls of blood to spray from him!

Erya gazed at Yang Ye from behind, and no one knew what she was thinking.

Suddenly, Snowy appeared before Erya. Erya’s originally calm gaze instantly became vicious from the sight of Snowy!

Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically when he sensed this, and he couldn’t go to Snowy right now!

“AH!” Yang Ye swung his sword repeatedly at the mysterious expert! However, it was he who was pushed back repeatedly!

Meanwhile, Snowy ignored the vicious aura around Erya. She went over to Erya, just like she used to!

Snowy waved her paws swiftly. As she waved them, she pointed behind Erya while anxiety covered her chubby face.

Obviously, she wanted Erya to run!

Erya gazed at Snowy, and she’d already clenched her fist!

An old enemy!

Snowy and Erya could be said to be born enemies, just like fire and water. In the past, Erya would naturally not harm Snowy, but she wasn’t the same Erya anymore!

She had undisguised killing intent in her eyes as she gazed at Snowy.

But Snowy hadn’t noticed that at all. She felt that Erya didn’t understand what she was saying and started waving her paws even more quickly.

Meanwhile, Erya suddenly clenched her right fist. She was about to attack when Snowy opened her mouth, “Run!”

There was still no sound when she spoke.

As she spoke, she withdrew many fruits and placed them before Erya. They were Worldborn Fruits and Chaotic Fruits. Besides that, there was the Desolate Axe. It was Erya’s old weapon! She’d given Erya everything she felt was a treasure to Erya!

Suddenly, Erya grabbed Snowy by the throat. At practically the exact same moment, a tanghulu appeared in Snowy’s grasp!

Erya was stunned as she gazed at the tanghulu, and then she stopped herself.

As she gazed at it, tears suddenly surged out of her eyes.

A moment of silence ensued, and then Erya suddenly howled with fury. A moment later, she clenched her right fist before slamming it against her head!
