Chapter 1755 – Bigamy!

The ascend the throne!

The Yang Clan wasn’t a royal family of the mortal world, but it had its own ceremonies. Otherwise, would anyone know who the patriarch was?

A day later.

Phecda City.

Phecda City was gradually returning to its bustling state. Moreover, there were much more people here than before. Because Yang Lianshuang had summoned back the experts of the Yang Clan who were away from the clan.

Everyone knew it was time for things to change in the Yang Clan.

They naturally didn’t dare to object to it. The only person in the Yang Clan who dared to object would be that 6th stage True Realm ancestor of the Yang Clan, but their ancestor hadn’t stepped forward to stop all of this. Obviously, their ancestor had no objections.

In other words, it was certain that Yang Lianshuang would be the next patriarch.

Phecda Hall.

At this moment, Phecda Hall was decorated for a joyous event, and it was filled with noise and excitement. It was especially so for Yang Lianshuang’s supporters. They could be said to be founding members, so once Yang Lianshuang took her place as patriarch, their status would naturally rise along with her. So, they were working exceptionally hard right now.

“Welcome the patriarch!” A sonorous voice resounded through the hall, and then Yang Lianshuang appeared at the front of the hall. Yang Ye was by her side.

She glanced at the members of the Yang Clan below her before looking at Yang Xuan, “No one from the other clans came?”

Yang Xuan fell silent for a moment before she shook her head.

The smiles on everyone’s faces gradually vanished.

Normally, when any clan had a new patriarch, the other clans would congratulate that person. But this time, the other seven clans had chosen not to attend.

Suddenly, everyone looked towards the entrance of the hall. An old man had appeared there.

Yang Ye recognized the old man. It was the Wu Clan’s grand elder!

The Wu Clan’s grand elder cupped his fist to Yang Lianshuang once he entered the hall, “Congratulations, Miss Lianshuang, on becoming the patriarch.”

Yang Lianshuang glanced at the Wu Clan’s patriarch and asked, “Are you representing yourself or the Wu Clan?”

“The Wu Clan, of course!” The Grand Elder smiled, “Miss Lianshuang, my Patriarch wanted me to give you a message. He wasn’t able to come due to some issues. But my Wu Clan has no ill intent towards the Yang Clan. Not in the past, and not now. My Wu Clan is willing to maintain our previous relationship with the Yang Clan and maintain peace between our clans!”

Yang Lianshuang nodded slightly, “My Yang Clan is similarly willing to maintain our previous relationship and maintain peace with the Wu Clan!”

The Grand Elder nodded and gazed at Yang Ye, “Young Master Yang, Miss An is fine and well in my Wu Clan. You don’t have to worry about her. You’re welcome to visit her any time!”

He naturally had to be respectful when facing Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang. Their joint forces were sufficient to defeat even a 6th stage True Realm expert. But one of them was only at the 1st stage of the True Realm while the other was merely at the Zenith Realm!

It could be said that Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang’s names were renowned throughout the medium universe of the Milky Way System.

Presently, there was a saying in the medium universe of the Milky Way System — Who had the strongest geniuses? All of them have the Yang surname!

It naturally referred to Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang.

Yang Ye nodded and replied, “I will.”

The Grand Elder smiled, “You’re always welcome in my Wu Clan! Farewell!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he didn’t stay a moment longer, and he turned around with the intent to leave. However, he suddenly seemed to have thought of something, and he turned to look at Yang Lianshuang, “Miss Lianshuang, my patriarch has another message.”

Yang Lianshuang replied, “Go on!”

The Grand Elder spoke solemnly, “The Yang Clan is in danger.”

He turned around and vanished from the hall.

The atmosphere in the hall was slightly heavy.

A short while passed before Yang Lianshuang gazed at Yang Ye, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye replied, “I think it’s in danger too.”

“Of course!” Yang Lianshuang placed her hands behind her back and smiled, “Do you know that saying? A man’s wealth is his own ruin by arousing the greed of others. Our clan’s overall strength has declined tremendously after what happened. It can be said that we’re at our weakest moment. However, that isn’t the real reason they are acting against us.”

Yang Ye asked, “What’s the real reason?”

She gazed at him and replied, “You and me!”Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

Yang Lianshuang explained, “Our natural talent is the true reason why they’re acting against us. Our current strength is already sufficient to defeat a 6th stage True Realm expert. So, what if we attain the 3rd or even 4th stage of the True Realm? They’re afraid. They’re afraid that we’ll grow.”

She laughed coldly at this point, “This is how the world works. Sometimes, there’s no right and wrong. Even if you don’t harm anyone, but so long as someone thinks you’re a threat, then they will try to kill you.”

Yang Ye nodded as he fully agreed with what she’d said. Actually, it was a principle he’d understood at a very young age. It was how society worked. No matter how nicely you conducted yourself, you’ll still become the needle in someone’s eye!

It was human nature!

Yang Lianshuang turned to gaze at the experts of the Yang Clan, “I’m sure all of you heard the grand elder of the Wu Clan. Our Yang Clan is like a piece of juicy meat, and the other clans want to take a bite out of us. So, our Yang Clan is at its most difficult moment, and all of you must be prepared for a tough battle at any moment!”

All of them nodded, and there was no fear on their faces.

Even though the Yang Clan’s strength had declined due to internal strife, the members of the Yang Clan still had their backbone and drive. Moreover, while the Yang Clan had lost a 6th stage True Realm expert and Yang Xiao, it still had Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang!

So long as it had them, the Yang Clan’s experts were confident in their ability to face the other clans!

Yang Lianshuang gave some further instructions before ordering everyone to leave.

Yang Ye said, “Why have I seen so few members of the Yang Clan activate their Mad Demon Bloodline?” He’d always been puzzled by this. Because the Mad Demon Bloodline could increase a person’s strength, but even until the moment they died, Yang Xiao and the others had never utilized their bloodlines!

Yang Lianshuang shook her head slightly, “They’ve removed their bloodline!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

Yang Lianshuang spoke solemnly, “The Mad Demon Bloodline can improve one’s strength temporarily, but it has a flaw, and it’s that it makes its user lose clarity of their minds. So, your father suggested that we suppress our bloodlines, and then he created a method to eliminate it from our bodies. However, not everyone was willing to give up our bloodline. Some cultivated their bloodlines in secret for the sake of gaining strength!”

I see! Yang Ye nodded. No wonder the Primordial Pagoda suppressed my bloodline and refused to let it awaken. Exchanging clarity of the mind for strength is absolutely foolish.

Yang Ye stopped thinking about this and gazed at Yang Lianshuang, “Yang Xiang’s soul escaped?”

Yang Lianshuang nodded slightly.

Yang Ye’s face fell. Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang said, “He’s nothing to worry about because that attack of yours damaged his foundation. Even his soul was heavily injured. It’ll take at least a hundred years for him to recover and find a good body. But not to mention a hundred years, in just a few years, even his peak strength would be nothing before us.”

“True!” Yang Ye smiled, “Let’s forget him. Right, are your people at Merak System yet?”

She nodded slightly. Suddenly, the space before her trembled, and she fell silent for a moment before she gazed at Yang Ye, “Your wives and the others are here.”

Suddenly, a group of people appeared outside the hall.

Yang Ye’s eyes instantly became moist when he saw them.

Su Qingshi and Zhuang Weiran were at the front of the group while Qin Xiyue, Lu Jianyao, Lei Lin, Bao’er, An Biru, and the others were by their sides.

Everyone was here!

“Daddy!” Suddenly, Xue’er ran over to Yang Ye and jumped into his arms.

Yang Ye grinned as he held her. He lifted her up and walked over to Su Qingshi and the others. At this moment, he felt extremely content as he gazed at them.

Suddenly, Yang Lianshuang said, “From this moment onwards, the Yang Clan is your home.”

Yang Ye turned to look at her, and he nodded, “Alright!”

He didn’t have a sense of belonging to the Yang Clan. Because the Yang Clan was a clan that cared too much about its own interests, and it was too selfish and emotionless. He would have absolutely not brought them here a while ago, yet now, he believed that Yang Lianshuang would change the Yang Clan!

Moreover, he had to find a place for them to stay.

Make the Yang Clan strong!

That was Yang Lianshuang’s goal, and it was his goal.

Yang Lianshuang left without making a sound. She spoke softly outside the hall, “That fellow isn’t an emotionless person after all.”

She’d noticed Yang Ye’s reaction when he saw Su Qingshi and the others. At that moment, she was really surprised and shocked. Because Yang Ye’s eyes were moist.

As far as she was concerned, a person like Yang Ye should be completely emotionless and ruthless. Even if people like him cared about someone, it would be limited. After all, in this world where the strong were respected, women were mostly just there to make a man look good.

A strong man never lacked the company of women. Under such circumstances, men usually didn’t care too much about their women. However, Yang Ye’s expression told her that he really cared. At this moment, she truly understood why Yang Ye had tortured Yang Xiao to death!

Because they were like his reverse scales!

Yang Lianshuang took a deep breath and looked up at the sky. She remained silent for a long time before she suddenly withdrew a fine bracelet. The bracelet was quite unique. Two small metal chains were joined to a circular object, and that circular object was extremely smooth like a mirror. Beneath that ‘mirror’ were three fine needles, and one of them was slowly moving clockwise.

She gazed at it for a long time before she spoke softly, “That fellow would be guilty of bigamy back home.”
