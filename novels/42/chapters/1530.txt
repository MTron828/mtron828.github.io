Chapter 1531 - Do You Think You’re Yang Ye?

Translator: InVader

Blood Sword Demon! Yang Ye had a weird expression on his face. He’d thought that they were here for him, but he hadn’t expected them to have taken him to be that fellow, the Blood Sword Demon.

They hadn’t discerned his true identity!

This was naturally a very good thing for Yang Ye. Because if the War Pavilion recognized him, then it may not be Dualism Realm experts but numerous Rebirth Realm experts that came for him.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, glanced at the people around him, and said, “How laughable! You actually dare to come looking for me, the Blood Sword Demon, with such few experts? You’re truly courting death!”

The middle aged man who led the group laughed coldly, “Blood Sword Demon, do you think you’re Yang Ye? We’re already thinking highly of you by coming here in a group of five. You…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye flipped his palm, and Heaven’s Gravestone appeared in his grasp. After that, he swung it swiftly.

A ray of blood red sword energy flashed.

Bang!

The middle aged man who led the group was caught off guard, and he was instantly blasted backwards.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s figure transformed into a ray of light that vanished towards the distance.

The middle aged man was stunned for a moment, and then he said, “Get him!”

As soon as he finished speaking, all five of them transformed into rays of light that shot off in Yang Ye’s direction.

Yang Ye didn’t enter the city, and he fled towards the boundless mountains instead. If he activated the Sword God’s Seal, then killing them would only take five attacks. But if he really did that, then the War Pavilion would definitely send Rebirth Realm experts after him. After all, there were many people watching from around the city.

It didn’t take long for them to follow Yang Ye into the mountains. But as soon as they did that, Yang Ye’s aura vanished completely.

All of them frowned.

A moment of silence ensued before one of the middle aged men spoke solemnly, “Guardian Mu, he seems to have brought us here on purpose.”

The middle aged man called Guardian Mu glanced at the surroundings and said, “Be careful.”

The others nodded, and then their divine senses swept towards the surroundings. It didn’t take long for an area of 50,000km to be within the scope of their divine sense. But there was no one here!

Guardian Mu frowned, “Where did that fellow go?”

Meanwhile, one of the other Dualism Realm experts said, “He’s definitely still here in the mountains. Let’s split up and search for him?”

Guardian Mu thought for a while and nodded, “Be careful!”

The others nodded, and then they vanished on the spot. Once all four of them left, Guardian Mu glanced at the surroundings, and then he was about to leave. However, something unexpected occurred. The space not too far ahead from him trembled, and then a ray of light shot out from it!

The ray of light had appeared too suddenly, and it was too swift. Even then, Guardian Mu’s reaction was very swift, and a wave of aura surged out explosively from him.

Bang!

Guardian Mu was blasted away, and at the exact same instant, another ray of light flashed!

Hiss!

This time, Guardian Mu wasn’t able to dodge it, and the ray of light flashed straight through his forehead, causing his body to stiffen. It didn’t take long for the color in his eyes to gradually vanish until they dimmed down completely.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye appeared by Guardian Mu’s corpse. He waved his right hand and stored Guardian Mu’s corpse in the ancient sheath, and then he vanished on the spot.

A breath of time later, a ray of light suddenly flashed down from the sky around 30km away from where Guardian Mu fell, and then another ray of light immediately followed after it.

The body of a Dualism Realm expert stiffened before Yang Ye, and there was a thumb-sized hole on his forehead. Blood was flowing out slowly from that hole.

Yang Ye waved his right hand and put the corpse away, and then he instantly vanished on the spot.

He couldn’t kill Dualism Realm experts in an instant while his sword intent hadn’t been raised to the Returnal Rank. But while one attack was insufficient, two attacks could accomplish it. Ordinary Dualism Realm experts couldn’t resist two Rebirth Swords from him.

He was an entire two realms below the Dualism Realm, but the gap in their cultivations could be made up for with sword techniques and sword intent.

Just like that, Yang Ye killed four Dualism Realm experts with extreme speed.

The last living Dualism Realm expert was ceaselessly scanning the surroundings. Besides vigilance, there was strong fear within his eyes. At this moment, he knew that the other four were dead.

He remained silent for an instant, and then his figure vanished into the sky.

He’d fled!

After four Dualism Realm experts perished, he didn’t have the guts to stay here.

Once the middle aged man fled, Yang Ye appeared where he had been just a few moments ago. An arc curved up on his lips as he gazed towards the direction that the middle aged man had vanished towards, and then he vanished on the spot.

He’d left the Dualism Realm expert escape on purpose. If he killed all of them, the War Pavilion would definitely investigate the matter. Once that happens, the War Pavilion may find out that it was him and not the Blood Sword Demon. But if he let one of them leave, then that person would definitely put the blame on the Blood Sword Demon!

In that way, the War Pavilion’s attention would be focused on the Blood Sword Demon, and even if they sent more experts, they wouldn’t send out any Rebirth Realm experts. Or even if they did send Rebirth Realm experts, they would definitely not send many. However, if the War Pavilion found out that it was him, then they would definitely send a group of Rebirth Realm experts!

As far as he was concerned, the important matter at hand was to find Snowy and Zi’er. As for the War Pavilion, he didn’t have time to waste on it!

Yang Ye didn’t return to the city immediately, and he started to refine the corpses instead!

He was a Semi-Deity now, so he could control around five Sword Servants at the Dualism Realm. Dualism Realm Sword Servants were extremely useful to him. After all, every single Sword Servant was another layer of protection!

One day later, Yang Ye left the mountains and returned to Formation City. He paid the required divine crystals and entered the teleportation formation that led to Oblivion Boundary.

Two days later, Yang Ye arrived at Oblivion Boundary.

Oblivion Boundary was the boundary between the territories of the demon race and human race. Presently, both territories were in a time of peace, so there were many human mercenaries and adventurers on Oblivion Boundary.

Even though the demon race prohibited humans from entering the demon territory without permission, the human race wouldn’t adhere to such rules. Of course, humans didn’t dare to trespass openly, but sneaking in was still possible.

Oblivion Boundary City.

There was only a single city in an area of over 100,000km around Oblivion boundary, and it was Oblivion Boundary City.

Oblivion Boundary City was also called the city that lacked three. It lacked rules, it lacked order, and it lacked any laws! Simply speaking, it was very chaotic. Because all sorts of people could be found in the city, and it was even to the extent that demon beasts which had taken human form or experts of other races could be found in the city.

There were two things that were required to survive here. The first was strength. If one was strong, one could naturally survive here. The second was intelligence. One must be very well aware of who one could afford to offend and who one couldn’t afford to offend. Of course, if one’s strength was at a certain level, then one could naturally offend anyone one wanted!

Yang Ye didn’t head straight for the Demon Territory, and he entered the city first instead. Because he needed a map of the Demon Territory. How huge was the Demon Territory? In any case, it was larger than the human race’s territory. Moreover, the Divine Phoenix Clan wasn’t the only clan in the demon race, and there were other clans as well. So, if he didn’t know where he was going upon entering the Demon Territory and started running around randomly instead, it wouldn’t just waste his time, it may get him in trouble as well. After all, the demon race didn’t welcome humans who entered their territory without permission.

Yang Ye didn’t have a map of the Demon Territory, and the Qin Clan didn’t either. However, someone in Oblivion Boundary City did, and this was something Qin Shan told him.

Even though it was a chaotic city, Oblivion Boundary City was extremely imposing. Just its walls were over 300m tall, causing others to seem tiny before it.

The city gates were open wide, and they weren’t guarded.

Yang Ye walked straight through the gates and entered the city. He noticed that many gazes and divine senses instantly descended upon him when he entered the city. Especially those divine senses, they merely descended upon him in the beginning, but it didn’t take long for them to start acting without any restraint.

Obviously, it was because he was just a Semi-Deity!

Yang Ye paid no attention to those gazes and divine senses, and he just started walking into the city. However, he hadn’t gone far before he suddenly stopped. A woman in a black leather skirt had appeared in front of him.

Based on her outward appearance, she seemed to be around the age of 30, and she had an extremely hot body and was showing a huge amount of skin. Her upper body was only wrapped very tightly in thin leather, causing her large mounds to be squeezed slightly and seem like they would burst free at any moment. As for her lower body, she wore a leather skirt that just barely covered her. It just had to be pulled up a little bit for her secrets to be revealed…

Even though she wasn’t gorgeous, she was pretty. Coupled with her dressing, it made her even more seductive. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

She walked over to Yang Ye, sized him up, and said, “Young Brother, is it your first time here?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She chuckled when she saw him nod, and then she smiled, “Young Brother, you’re truly brave. You dared to come here when you’re just a Semi-Deity. Aren’t you afraid that you’ll lose your life?”

Yang Ye nodded, “A little.”

She moved closer to Yang Ye again while the smile on her face had turned into a spurious one, “Young Brother, your spatial ring looks pretty good. Big Sister likes it, so give it to me. Alright?”

She intended to rob him!

Yang Ye glanced at her. He was about to speak when a huge saber suddenly tore through the air, and its target was Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly when he saw the saber. He was about to counterattack when the woman acted before he could. A dagger suddenly appeared in her grasp, and she flicked it upwards and flicked the saber away.

Once she finished doing that, she looked at a middle aged man in the distance and spoke coldly, “Nan Ba, you’ve broken the rules!”

“The rules?” The man laughed coldly, “Yu Jiaoniang, I’m quite curious. You actually didn’t kill him immediately. Have you taken a liking to that pretty boy?”

She laughed coldly, “I have! What about it?”

Nan Ba was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly started walking towards the city.

Yu Jiaoniang was stunned when she saw Yang Ye walk away, and she instinctively wanted to call out to him and stop him. However, for some unknown reason, her mouth opened, yet she didn’t speak.

Meanwhile, Nan Ba suddenly spoke fiercely, “Did I say that you can fucking leave?”

Suddenly, Yang Ye turned around to look at Nan Ba. At the moment he turned around, his eyes had instantly become oceans of blood. Moreover, even his entire body had turned blood red!

Yang Ye walked slowly in Nan Ba’s direction. Every single step he took left a blood red footprint on the ground, and his blood red eyes stared at Nan Ba as he said, “What did you just say? I didn’t hear you. Why don’t you repeat it again?”
