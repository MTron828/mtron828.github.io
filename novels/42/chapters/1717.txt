Chapter 1718 - Kill Yang Ye And Save 100 Years Of Hard Work!

Kill to his heart’s content!

They were words that Yang Ye had spoken from the heart.

One shouldn’t live a life where one was in constant fear and worry. If the Ku Clan and Ying Clan came looking for trouble with him, then he didn’t fear them at all, and he would kill them!

Yang Lianshuang gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and there was a trace of admiration in her eyes, “Not bad. That’s how men should act. Actually, I’m quite surprised by how much you’ve changed. Even though you killed many in the Yang Clan that day, it was nothing worth mentioning to me.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She spoke indifferently, “Because you relied on external sources of strength. That can’t be considered as your own ability. If you didn’t have that beast, that woman, that mysterious flame, that mysterious wooden sword, and that mysterious arm, then I would be able to kill you within ten moves!”

Ten moves! Yang Ye glanced at her, “You’re very confident.”

Yang Lianshuang replied, “Even though your attainments in the Sword Dao weren’t bad, it was too disordered, it was in a mess. You hadn’t just been unable to achieve the state of ‘True’, you couldn’t even be considered to have attained the zenith. If it wasn’t for that mysterious arm, you wouldn’t even have been able to resist a single move from Yang Xiao!”

Yang Ye fell silent. He wasn’t able to refute that. Because Yang Lianshuang wasn’t wrong. If he hadn’t relied on the Wargod’s arm and the wooden sword, he wouldn’t have been able to resist a single attack from Yang Xiao!

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang continued, “It’s not that you can’t use external sources of strength, but only your own strength is true strength. Obviously, you’ve understood that principle. Currently, your strength and speed haven’t just arrived at your limits, it has arrived at the state of ‘True’. Presently, you’re barely able to be considered as an expert!”

“Barely able!” Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched, “Are there many in the younger generation of the medium universe that are stronger than me?”

Yang Lianshuang placed her hands behind her back, fell silent for a long time, and replied, “It’s best if you don’t keep such a mental state. You can be confident, but never be conceited. Not to mention anyone else, just that fellow ranked at the 1st place on the Milky Way Rankings is someone you’re definitely not a match for right now. Moreover, there are some others who look down on the geniuses on the Milky Way Rankings. Their strength is beyond your imagination!”

She paused for a moment and continued, “There’s always someone stronger. There is no strongest, and only stronger.”

Yang Ye nodded. He truly agreed with that sentiment.

Since his time in Profounder Continent, he’d noticed that once he grew stronger, he would notice that there were many who were much stronger. Just as Yang Lianshuang had said, there was no strongest, only stronger.

Suddenly, she frowned slightly, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “Congratulations!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What?”

She replied, “I just received news that the Yang Clan has put a hit on you. Anyone who brings your head to the Yang Clan will be rewarded with three True Rank treasures, three True Rank techniques, and two True Spirit Fruits! True Spirit Fruits are absolute treasures. It can help one attain the True Realm. As for those at the True Realm, they can use it to improve their cultivations. It’s a rare treasure even in the eight clans!”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Why is that worth congratulating me?”

Yang Lianshuang replied, “Didn’t you want to kill to your heart’s content? Based on the rewards that the Yang Clan is providing, many will definitely come for your head. Moreover, it will definitely not be weaklings that come for you. So, you’ll definitely be able to kill to your heart’s content.

Yang Ye was speechless.

Yang Lianshuang continued, “Be careful. Yang Xiao and the clan didn’t provide such rewards because they really want those people to kill you. Their true objective is for you to become the enemy of countless people. Even though there’s no enmity between you and them, I’m sure you’re aware that when there’s something to gain, enmity will be formed. Once your head is worth a huge amount and is helpful to them, they will come for your head.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand!”

Yang Lianshuang said, “In my opinion, Yang Xiao and the others’ goal is to make you be pursued all day and night, so that you won’t have time to cultivate and have the blood of many on your hands so that you’ll become entangled with all sorts of enmity and karma. After all, every single person you kill is a form of enmity and karma. That person’s friends and loved ones are likely to seek revenge from you. Do you get what I’m saying?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “It’s quite a ruthless method!”

She replied, “It is.” She flicked a scroll over to Yang Ye and continued, “You can get in touch with me through that, and I’ll notify you about any moves the Yang Clan makes. Good luck.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye remained silent on the spot for a long time, and then he was about to leave. However, he suddenly turned to look towards a point in space, “Show yourself!”

As soon as Yang Ye spoke, that expanse of space wriggled, and then a man walked out from there.

The man asked, “You’re Yang Ye?”

Yang Ye glanced at him. There was a small ‘赢’ character on the man’s left chest.

The Ying Clan? Yang Ye frowned slightly, The Ying Clan is here so soon?

But it did make sense. As the strongest amongst the eight clans, it was probably not difficult for the Ying Clan to find him.

The man nodded slightly, “I’m Ying Yu, one of the Ying Clan’s young masters. I just emerged from my closed door cultivation and heard about the hit that the Yang Clan has put out on you. Needless to say, the rewards were really tempting to me.”

Yang Ye said, “So, you took action?”

The man smiled, “Since the Yang Clan is willing to pay such a high price, I presume there’s something special about you. Allow me to experience it, alright? Otherwise…”

Suddenly, the man’s voice stopped abruptly because a sword had suddenly stabbed into his throat.

Besides that, Yang Ye had suddenly appeared in front of the man.

Yang Ye looked at the man whose eyes were opened wide and asked, “Have you experienced it now?”

Yang Ye suddenly pulled out his sword before the man could answer him.

Hiss!

A string of blood sprayed while Yang Ye’s figure appeared 3km away. A moment later, Yang Ye had vanished from the man’s field of vision.

The man’s eyes were still opened wide, and blood was still spraying from his forehead!

…

Because of the Yang Clan, the name ‘Yang Ye’ instantly swept through the entire medium universe.

At this moment, Yang Ye could be said to be known throughout the medium universe, and it was none other than because his head was worth a tremendous sum. Countless were tempted by the rewards, and even some old geezers at the True Realm were tempted!

Besides the rewards, there was also another reason for why they were tempted, and it was because Yang Ye was only at the Zenith Realm!

If Yang Ye was at the True Realm, then many would definitely abandon their thoughts to exchange his head for treasures. After all, True Realm experts were top existences in the medium universe. But Yang Ye wasn’t at the True Realm, he was only at the Zenith Realm!

Moreover, Yang Ye was on the Milky Way Rankings!

Under such circumstances, countless people were tempted.

Kill Yang Ye and save 100 years of hard work!

It was a saying that had spread throughout the medium universe!

It wasn’t exaggerated at all. The compensation that the Yang Clan was willing to provide was truly too enticing. If they obtained those treasures, their cultivation and strength would improve by leaps and bounds.

So, countless started searching for Yang Ye.

Some were comparatively cautious and didn’t seek out Yang Ye on their own. They formed groups instead. They were comparatively smarter. Because as far as they were concerned, since the Yang Clan was willing to pay such a high price, Yang Ye was definitely not an ordinary person.

So, they started forming groups and searching for Yang Ye.

Just like that, countless people throughout the medium universe started searching for Yang Ye, and some mysterious powers and clans had actually started to sell information about Yang Ye’s whereabouts.

Even though most were fake, some were true.

So, Yang Ye was surrounded by a group right now.

It was a group of three men. All of them were around the age of 30, and all of them were at the Zenith Realm! Their auras were dense. Obviously, they weren’t ordinary Zenith Realm experts.

The man who led the group, had a portrait, and it had Yang Ye’s face on it.

He glanced at Yang Ye, and then he glanced at the portrait. After that, a smile curled up on the corners of his mouth, “Yang Ye, it took us quite a bit of effort to find you, and it costed us quite a bit too. Fortunately, it was worth it. After all…”

Suddenly, his voice stopped.

An instant later, a gust of wind blew by, and his head fell off his neck.

The other two men beside the headless corpse were stunned.

It didn’t take long for one of them to gaze at Yang Ye who was still standing on the spot, “Did you do that?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I did!”

The man stared at Yang Ye, “How did you do that?!”

Yang Ye replied, “You didn’t see it clearly? Alright, watch again.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s hand moved slightly.

Hiss!

At practically the exact same moment, the body of the man who’d just spoken had instantly stiffened. It was because a hole had appeared in the center of his forehead.

Yang Ye gazed at the man and asked, “Did you see it clearly now?” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The man muttered with despair, “No…”

The color in his eyes dimmed down once he finished speaking.

Just like that, only a black robed man remained here, and he was shivering.

Yang Ye gazed at the black robed man and asked, “Did you see it clearly?”

Thump!

Suddenly, the man fell to his knees and spoke with a trembling voice, “I have both the elderly and children to take care of. I’m the only pillar of support for my family. Please spare me!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
