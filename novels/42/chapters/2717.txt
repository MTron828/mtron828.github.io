Chapter 2718 – Getting Even!

It wasn’t her main body, it was just a clone!

Tu walked over to Yang Ye and just gazed at him.

Yang Ye’s face remained indifferent, and he looked her straight in the eyes.

A short while later, Tu chuckled, “You couldn’t even give me that bit of face?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “From the very beginning, he has tried to kill me multiple times, and you never stopped him. But you stop me when I try to kill him. What would you do in my place?”

She glanced at him and looked off into the distance, it was where Mo Yu’s soul had dispersed.

She just looked there for a long time. In the end, she spoke softly, “I should say that I brought about his death. I made him possess ambition that far surpassed his strength.”

Yang Ye remained silent.

She’d brought up Mo Yu and personally trained him. So it was impossible for her to feel nothing.

However, Mo Yu may have disappointed her.

Tu continued, “I gave him a chance before this. Heaven Executor going to him was that chance. Unfortunately, his heart was still so full of envy and hatred.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and said, “He wasn’t bad once, but he unfortunately lost himself.”

Her figure gradually turned ethereal.

Yang Ye remained silent.

He wasn’t interested in the relationship between Mo Yu and Tu.

His mind was on crushing the End World and the strongest form of Destiny.

Suddenly, Tu asked, “You’ve met our strongest form?”

Yang Ye gazed at her and nodded.

Tu spoke indifferently, “Looks like she didn’t acknowledge you!”

Yang Ye smiled, “It doesn’t matter. If I have someone strong to rely on, I will; but if I don’t, it doesn’t matter. I’ll just rely on myself.”

Tu gazed at him for a long time. In the end, she shook her head slightly, “If he could think that way, he wouldn’t have suffered such a fate.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “I’ll give 3rd and 4th some face, and I’ll give you this warning. Since you failed to receive her acknowledgement, don’t meet her again. Especially when you can’t defeat her.”

Her figure turned ethereal once she finished speaking.

It didn’t take long for Tu to vanish completely from Yang Ye’s field of vision.

Yang Ye moved his gaze away and withdrew the transmission rock. A short while later, a voice came from within it, “Congratulations, Brother yang!”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “What is there to be happy about?”

The voice chuckled, “You’ve defeated the End World. Is that not reason enough?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “They aren’t really defeated. Right, the End World seems to have a mysterious expert. Do you know about that existence?” His expression became solemn at this point because he still felt a lingering fear when he thought about that expert.

The voice on the other side of the transmission stone fell silent for some time before it said, “I don’t know. We’re investigating as well. But from now on, we may have to go into hiding. Because Heng Wangu seems to have noticed something.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Be careful. Contact me if you need my help!”

The voice chucked, “Then I’ll thank you in advance. Take care, Brother Yang.”

The transmission stone fell silent.

Yang Ye put the transmission stone away, glanced at the surroundings, and then vanished on the spot.

Around an hour later, he stopped somewhere and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

On the Ascension Platform.

Yang Ye went over to Snowy, and she passed a sword to Yang Ye.

Heaven Executor!Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Yang Ye took it. At this moment, it didn’t have a consciousness anymore. Snowy had destroyed its existing Sword Sprite.

It was a brand new Heaven Executor now!

Meanwhile, Snowy pointed at herself and pointed at the sword. She was saying that she could foster a new sprite for it!

Yang Ye rubbed her little head and smiled, “Alright! But don’t make it like the last one.”

Snowy hurriedly nodded. Even she hated the previous Sword Sprite in Heaven Executor.

Yang Ye glanced at the sword. If it didn’t have a new sprite, its strength would decline tremendously. Fortunately, he had Snowy, so fostering a new sprite wasn’t an issue at all.

Most importantly, Heaven Executor could be merged with Great Unknown and Past Life!

Yang Ye put his swords away and went to Erya’s abode with Snowy. At this moment, she’d changed again. Now, the horns on her head were dark gold in color! Besides that, her tail had changed too.

There was a mysterious dark golden glow flowing through her tail.

It wasn’t just her tail, the mysterious dark golden glow was often flowing throughout her body.

Besides that, Erya’s aura was growing, and it was so powerful that even his heart palpitated slightly.

At the same time that he was shocked, Yang Ye felt quite a bit of bitterness. Erya could become so terrifying just by eating two inner core fragments, but he’d done so, so much to get where he was!

Actually, it was normal. Erya was regaining her past strength, but he didn’t have that!

Yang Ye and Snowy stayed with Erya for a while, and then Yang Ye went to An Nanjing’s abode on his own. She was seated cross-legged at the center of the house, and she opened her eyes upon sensing Yang Ye’s arrival.

Yang Ye sized up An Nanjing and spoke softly, “Are you alright?”

She nodded, “I’m fine!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly. Meanwhile, she spoke softly, “That saber cultivator is very strong!”

Zuo Mu!

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

An Nanjing said, “I can sense that he may have been holding back.”

He was hiding his strength!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “You’re saying that he didn’t use his full strength?”

An Nanjing nodded, “He’s hiding it. I almost pushed him to his limits many times, but every single time that happened, I would sense danger.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Be careful when you encounter him next time. He is holding back, and if it isn’t to take you by surprise, it’s to take Destiny by surprise.”

Yang Ye nodded, “The End World held back too.”

He gazed at An Nanjing and smiled, “You’re not leaving anymore, right?”

She nodded, “Of course!”

She would never leave now. Because it was when Yang Ye needed help the most. Yang Ye wasn’t just being targeted by the End World, the strongest form of Destiny wanted to kill him too.

That was a practically unmatched existence!

After chatting with An Nanjing for a while, Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda.

Meanwhile, Snowy remained in the pagoda to nurture Heaven Executor’s sprite!

Tu hadn’t taken Heaven Executor, and its precious sprite was gone. So, Yang Ye would naturally not give up the sword!

Once he merged all three of them, their strength would definitely rise tremendously!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. Suddenly, a voice came from the transmission stone in his possession, “Eternal Kingdom has been breached!”

Eternal Kingdom has been breached!

Yang Ye frowned slightly, and the voice continued, “The desolate race has entered the Eternal Kingdom. So, the powers that were indecisive before have joined them. Now, the entire universe is madly taking over Eternal Kingdom. It’s in chaos now.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “The desolate race has help?”

The voice replied, “It may be linked to you!”

Yang Ye was puzzled.

The voice continued, “Firstly, you took the entire Sprite Palace. Of course, even if the Sprite Palace was still there, they wouldn’t be able to change a thing. The real reason is that you killed the experts from the Origin World, and you’re keeping the End World busy too. So, the Eternal Kingdom has no one to help them. Without the Origin World and End World, the Eternal Kingdom can’t find help from anyone else. After all, they rejected the entire universe, so no one likes them. The only forces that may help them were the Origin World and End World, but one of them was annihilated by you while the other is being kept busy by you…”

Yang Ye shook his head. After all, how could that be his fault?

The voice said, “Eternal Kingdom can be said to have brought all of this onto themselves. Of course, if I’m being honest, if you didn’t destroy the Origin World and keep the End World busy now, Eternal Kingdom may not be annihilated! After all, the Eternal Kingdom has a very long history, and it has a Divine Vein, so they just have to pay a certain price and they would be able to make the experts from both those places help them.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Let’s not talk about that anymore. Anyway, have you found the Soul Sect?”

The Soul Sect!

He'd never forgotten how they’d hunted him wherever he went! There were things that he hadn’t gotten revenge for in the past, but it didn’t represent that he’d given up on getting even. Now that he’d repulsed the End World, it was time to get even.

The voice replied, “I have. They are in the Eternal Kingdom. The Soul Sect’s Master has returned to the Eternal Kingdom too!”

Yang Ye asked, “Didn’t he join the End World?”

The voice replied, “He did, but his subordinates remained in Eternal Kingdom. It’s impossible for their entire organization to join the End World. The End World only wants him. Now that the desolate race is attacking, he chose to return.”

Yang Ye looked up at the sky and said, “It’s time to get even for some things.”

The voice added, “Besides that, those disciples who left your Ancient Sword Sect are all fine and well. However, some of them returned to Eternal Kingdom, and they are fighting the desolate race with the Eternal Kingdom. According to my investigations, their family is still in the Eternal Kingdom…”

Yang Ye nodded, “Are they still alive?”

The voice replied, “Yes, they are.”

Yang Ye looked up at the sky. He’d planned to just go beyond the 9th layer of space, but now it seemed like he had to return to Eternal Kingdom.

Yang Ye said, “I’ll leave investigating the mysterious expert supporting the End World to you. Besides that, I’m counting on you to complete my other requests. Contact me at any time if you need anything.”

The voice chuckled, “We’re on the same boat now. If anything happens to you, my fate won’t be any better. So, I hope we work well together!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Me too!”

Yang Ye vanished on the spot.
