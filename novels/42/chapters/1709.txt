Chapter 1710 - Split Second!

Sword techniques!

Yang Ye’s first target to simplify was his sword techniques. For example, Heavenrend. Heavenrend has been with him for a very, very long time. Because it was a sword technique that could grow along with his strength, and he had the Sword Spirit, so he’d never discarded that technique.

Simplifying represented making the sword technique even simpler and purer.

Heavenrend focused on explosive force and overlapping its attacks. However, sheathing and drawing a sword with the ancient sheath still took time.

Yang Ye was removing these tedious movements. In other words, his goal was for it to be overlapped without sheathing his sword.

Sword moves were no more than stabs, flicks, swings, chops, slashes, and so on and so forth. Now, he’d converted the Heavenrend into a swing, and every time he swung his sword, he would be able to overlap Heavenrend.

It wasn’t just with the swing movement, even the stab, flick, chop, slash, and other movements were being converted too.

In the future, every attack he executed could be overlapped.

Overlapping!

These words were the embodiment of speed and strength, and speed and strength were the quintessence of sword techniques. Any sword technique and even other techniques or flashy techniques were strong because of their speed and strength. Their quintessence was speed and strength.

So, Yang Ye had decided to abandon the techniques themselves and pursue both speed and strength.

He’d tested it earlier. During the battle with Ji Liangchuan, the reason he’d been able to destroy those rays of saber energy at the end was because of utilizing this method, and he’d noticed that it was very effective.

However, it was absolutely difficult to accomplish. Overlapping every single attack had extremely harsh requirements on one’s strength and speed. After all, an attack that isn’t overlapped can be extraordinarily swift, but an overlapped attack would slow down because of the overlapping.

Now, his goal was to train, train with everything he had. He intended to train until the difference in speed between an overlapped attack and a single attack vanished.

There were no shortcuts when it came to cultivating. The only way to simplify things was to practice, practice to the death!

It was an extremely painful process. Coupled with the fact that he could only use his left hand, it was even more painful.

He was just repeating simple moves like stabs, flicks, chops, and swipes. However, every single one of them was equivalent to 20 overlapped attacks. As he trained and trained, he couldn’t even feel his left hand anymore. Fortunately, he had Primordial Violet Energy.

Because he had Primordial Violent Energy, he could carry out high intensity training without any worries.

Cultivating was a never-ending process. In the blink of an eye, Yang Ye had been training for five months. Of course, only fifteen days had passed in the outside world.

During these five months, Yang Ye didn’t do anything but ceaselessly repeat basic sword movements like stabs, flicks, chops, swipes, and so on and so forth. He didn’t even sleep throughout this time.

He swung his sword tens of thousands of times every single day, and he trained until he couldn’t feel his arm. But because he had Primordial Violet Energy, his arm would be instantly repaired once he couldn’t feel it anymore. However, that was only during the beginning. In the end, his rate of training became so insane that even the Primordial Violet Energy couldn’t keep up with him.

So, it forced him to stop training from time to time!

Was it painful?

Absolutely. Because he wasn’t just using his arm when he trained, his entire body was tense. Coupled with the high levels of focus he had to maintain, it was absolutely tiring. But it was necessary.

There were no shortcuts in cultivation. The only way to grow stronger was to train until exhaustion!

Comfort was prepared for the dead!

Two more months passed.

Yang Ye finally stopped training.

In the cultivation room, Yang Ye stood on the spot with his sword in hand. His eyes were closed, and he seemed like he was in a meditative state. He just stood there for around a quarter of an hour, and then he suddenly opened his eyes.

Om!

A sword howl resounded, and then ten rays of light appeared before Yang Ye. Some of them were horizontal, some were vertical, and some were at an angle. In short, they were in all sorts of angles.

Yang Ye gazed at them for a long time, and then a smile curled up on the corners of his mouth. If they weren’t destroyed by external forces, they wouldn’t disperse on their own. He’d executed ten attacks just now, and every single one of them had 20 attacks in them. He’d only used less than a breath of time to accomplish that.

A few months ago, he’d only been able to execute two Heavenrends in succession within a breath of time!

Yet now, he could execute ten!

Besides that, every one of them was much stronger than they had been. After all, his constant training had tremendously improved both his speed and strength. Especially his Unrivaled Strength and physical strength. The main reason he could execute ten of those overlapped attacks within a breath of time was his physical strength and Unrivaled Strength!

Because his physical body’s foundation was very solid, and his Unrivaled Strength was powerful. That was why he could execute ten overlapped attacks within a breath of time!

If An Nanjing’s strength hadn’t improved at all, then she would definitely not be a match for him right now. However, he was very well aware that it was impossible. An Nanjing was very strong before they parted. Now that she had the Wu Clan’s ancestor, Wu Mu, to guide her, it was obvious that her strength would definitely undergo a qualitative transformation!

Of course, it was a good thing for him!

Yang Ye didn’t leave the Primordial Pagoda. Because he had numerous other things to do. For example, simplifying the Laws he possessed!

The Laws!

He possessed the Laws of Speed, the Laws of Darkness, the Spatial Laws, the Temporal Laws, and the Laws of Decay. Besides the Laws of Darkness, he practically never used the other four laws any longer.

The reason he stopped using them was because besides the Laws of Darkness, the rest weren’t very useful to him now. Yang Ye felt they were useless in the past, yet now, he realized that it wasn’t that they were useless, and he’d merely overlooked their strength.

For example, after the Laws of Darkness was improved, its might was completely different from what it had been. There were no weak Laws, and there were no weak sword techniques. There were only weak people.

Besides the Laws of Decay and the Temporal Laws, the other three Laws were the product of utilizing the Sword Domain to copy and comprehend from others. But after he copied it from others, he didn’t put further effort into comprehending and researching them. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Everything required hard work to learn and study it, and only then would it grow more effective.

In the past, he didn’t pay attention to things like this. Or it should be said that he’d overlooked all of it. But he refused to do it again!

He intended to organize everything he’d possessed and learned in the past. He planned to simplify them into their simplest, purest, and most effective form!

The forgetting that the Unfettered One and Li Taibai spoke about wasn’t completely forgetting all sword techniques and the Sword Domain. They meant forgetting the flashy yet impractical things to pursue the quintessence of all things. They pursued the true form of it all. Of course, their conversation wasn’t that simple, but Yang Ye had only figured out this much.

As for the deep and hidden meaning behind their words, he didn’t really understand it completely.

Study the Laws!

Yang Ye started studying the Laws next.

The Spatial Laws!

The first Law Yang Ye studied was the Spatial Laws. Because space was everywhere. He believed that if he truly comprehended it, then it would definitely be the most helpful to him.

The Spatial Laws allowed him to become one with space, and he could control space as well. However, even a Rebirth Realm expert could easily replicate that ability. Moreover, unless he was in a special place, the space in most places was very easy to shatter. That was exactly why the Spatial Laws seemed so useless to him.

It wasn’t just the Spatial Laws. Even the Temporal Laws, Laws of Speed, and the Laws of Decay were the same. It was also why Yang Ye rarely utilized these four Laws.

Were they useless?

That was what Yang Ye thought in the past. But he didn’t think they were useless anymore.

They weren’t useless, it was his fault for not learning them well!

When he started studying the Spatial Laws, Yang Ye called Zi’er over to his side. Because her attainments in space were much greater than his.

“Sense it!” Zi’er spoke solemnly, “If you want to understand space, you have to sense it. We’re within space right now, so sense it carefully. Sense everything about it, and then take control of everything it has and use everything it has. Your goal is to figure out how to control and use it better. It shouldn’t be difficult for you.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he sat down cross-legged and stared to comprehend space.

Space was everywhere. Because everyone lived within space. Of course, when one’s strength arrived at a certain level, one wouldn’t die even if space was shattered.

Now, his goal was to figure out how to use the space around him!

Just like that, day after day passed. Ten days later, Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes, and then he took his sword in his left grasp and swung it.

In an instant, ten rays of light appeared around him!

There was nothing different about them when compared to before, but Yang Ye was delighted!

Because this time, he’d used even less time than before. He’d reduced the overall time by around a tenth!

While it seemed to only be just a tenth, it still was extremely terrifying!

However, that wasn’t even the main point. The main point was that he’d noticed that he could utilize the space around him when he attacked. Space could be an auxiliary force to him and help his attacks grow even faster!

Besides that, he’d noticed that his Laws of Darkness, Spatial Laws, and Laws of Speed could be utilized together!

The reason his Laws of Darkness allowed him to suddenly appear behind others, without them noticing, was actually by traveling through space. At the instant he traveled through space, he could utilize the Spatial Laws, and he could even utilize the Laws of Speed as well!

Of course, it was difficult to utilize all three of these Laws in an instant.

Train!

Train like a madman!

On the first day, he trained 20,000 times. On the second day, 30,000 times. On the tenth day, 50,000 times.

Three months later.

On the 1st level of the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye was standing on a huge rock with his eyes closed, and he had a sword in his grasp.

Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes. A huge tree around 3km away from him was suddenly split apart at the center. An instant later, it decayed and crumbled into pieces.

Yang Ye glanced at the dense forest in the distance.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

All the trees he glanced at were split apart at the center, and the cut was smooth like a mirror.

An instant later, all of them decayed into powder.

As for Yang Ye, he was still standing on the spot and hadn’t moved at all.

A long time passed before Yang Ye looked down slightly and spoke softly, “This attack is formed from the fusion of five Laws. It’s swift to the extreme. I’ll call it… Split Second. A sword of mine that’s in the moment between an instant and eternity! Split Second! An attack in a split second!”
