Chapter 2100 – The Confucianist Progenitor!

Yang Ye had never expected the god race to be behind all of this!

The god race’s objective was obvious, it was to eliminate the Sages of the other races!

Because they were very well aware that if all the races joined forces, then the god race was absolutely incapable of resisting them. But it was absolutely possible for the races to join forces against the god race. Because so long as the god race was aggressive enough, they would definitely join forces. Thus, the god race decided to act first and use such a method to reduce the number of Sages possessed by the other races.

They’d succeeded!

The other races had suffered severe losses!

However, a progenitor was here now. So, could the god race fight a progenitor?

Yang Ye naturally had a rough idea of the middle aged man’s identity. Because it was obviously on a progenitor who could make Sages show such respect.

Yang Ye was quite worried, he was worried about the god race.

He naturally had a good impression of the god race because they had helped him on many occasions.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man glanced at the woman in a white dress and said, “Since you dared to do this, I presume you have something to rely on. I’m really curious about what it is.”

She replied, “It’s best if the Confucianist Path doesn’t interfere!”

The middle aged man smiled, “Why?”

She replied, “You can feel free to try if you aren’t afraid of losing the Confucianist Path.”

The middle aged man smiled, “Are you threatening me?”

She replied, “Not really. Since my god race dared to show itself, we’ve naturally made full preparations.”

She raised a finger and continued, “While we’ve suffered decline, trust me, if we are willing to risk everything, then slaughtering a progenitor is still possible for us.”

The middle aged man’s eyes narrowed slightly and turned a little cold.

She remained completely unafraid of him, “I’m afraid the Confucianist Path will instantly vanish from the world once you’re gone. What do you think?”

The middle aged man said, “Just my Confucianist Path can annihilate the god race in its current state!”

The woman smiled, “Why don’t you try?”

As soon as she finished speaking, she waved both her hands. In an instant, the seawater in the surroundings started rippling, and then a huge barrier of light appeared behind her.

The middle aged man’s face fell, “The Soul Beacon Formation!”

She said, “After my god race returned to the large universe, the Dao Path, Weapon Path, and Buddhist Path have remained silent. If your Confucianist Path doesn’t want to remain silent, you can. My god race will fight the Confucianist Path to the death. As far as we’re concerned, we have nothing to lose because we don’t even have a home anymore. So, losing our lives is nothing. But what about you? Are you willing to abandon your Grand Dao and your Confucianist Path?”

The middle aged man closed his eyes slowly. A long time passed before he opened his eyes and said, “As expected of the god race’s strategist. Everything is within your calculations. Actually, you should be aware why those three paths really haven’t acted against you!”

“Of course I do!” The woman smiled, “All those years ago, the times were on your side, so my god race fell. Now, it’s on our side.”

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye, “What about him? What is your god race trying to get from him?”

“Get from him?” She shook her head, “If we wanted to use him, we would have a long time ago. Confucianist Progenitor, you should be aware that all the races played an important part in where he is right now. It was them who pushed him to the other side, and it wasn’t my god race.”

The middle aged man chuckled, “You’re right, the times are on your side. However, it doesn’t mean that your god race will definitely win.”

She replied, “Let’s wait and see!”

The middle aged man nodded, “Then we shall.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he appeared in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was puzzled by this, “Senior?”

The middle aged man grinned, “I know that you definitely resent all the races for pursuing you. However, I believe that you don’t wish to see blood flow through the large universe, right?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Senior, you think too highly of me. To be honest, it doesn’t matter if it’s the all the races, the four paths, or the god race. Is the enmity between all of you something that I can interfere in?”

Yang Ye shook his head and continued, “I can’t, and I don’t want to. However, what they did to me, and especially what the Sovereign of Man did… There are some debts that I must reclaim on my own one day.”

The middle aged man suddenly asked, “Between the god race and the other races, whose side will you take?”

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to reply, “The god race!” Of course he was going to take the god race’s side. Why? It was very simple. Not only had the god race never pursued him with the intent to kill, they had helped him instead. As for the human race and its principles of righteousness, they couldn’t be relied on at all. Because no one had ever bothered to consider that when dealing with him. Of course, he wasn’t against the human race, and he wasn’t hostile against the human race either. Anyone who tried to kill him was his enemy, and anyone who helped him was someone he would help!

It was just that simple!

The middle aged man sighed softly. If it was just Yang Ye, then no matter how monstrously gifted Yang Ye was, Yang Ye wouldn’t be worth it for him to ask these questions. The problem was that the precious treasure of the Dao Path was within Yang Ye. Since that treasure had chosen Yang Ye, Yang Ye wasn’t just a human anymore. That was the main reason why he regarded Yang Ye as so important!

The middle aged man didn’t say another word and just left. Because he’d gotten the answer he was looking for.

Meanwhile, the woman in a white dress appeared not too far away from Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was about to speak when she said, “Come with me!”

She turned around and left once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and followed her.

Yang Ye followed her to the tree, and then she said, “This is my god race’s treasure, the Divine Void Tree!”

Yang Ye nodded, “That man from before told me!”

She suddenly asked, “Do you know who he is?”

Yang Ye shook his head in response.

“The Confucianist Progenitor!” She continued, “He’s the ancestor of the Confucianist Path, one of the top experts in the large universe. He’s also the person who spoiled our plans this time. However, it’s fine because as far as we are concerned, more than enough Sages have perished!”

Yang Ye asked, “Are you really going to attack all the other races?”

“Attack them?” She smiled, “Of course not. Not to mention us, even the four paths wouldn’t fight the other races to the death. Because it’s pointless. After all, it will only end in losses for both sides. My god race won’t fight them to the death!”

Yang Ye asked, “Then what are you planning?”

She replied, “Do you really want to know?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Meanwhile, she waved her right hand. In an instant, the tree around them turned ethereal and gradually vanished.

An instant later, she suddenly tapped her finger downwards. The water below them split open, and then they dropped down below.

They were descending slowly.

Yang Ye asked, “Where are we going?”

She smiled, “Would you believe me if I said that there’s something in it for you?”

Something for me? Yang Ye was puzzled.

The woman didn’t say more.

“Who are you?” Yang Ye asked this question in the end. He was really curious about her identity. Now that he was close beside her, he still couldn’t see her appearance.

She fell silent for a short while and said, “You’ll know in the future!”

She refuses to tell me again! Yang Ye laughed bitterly. Since she refused to say anything, he didn’t ask again.

They continued their descent. A long time later, they finally touched ground, and then she led them towards the distance. They walked through the water. The underwater world was a dark one, and it felt extremely heavy.

Pressure!

Yang Ye felt a sense of pressure.

A long time later, she suddenly stopped. There was a pitch black casket not too far ahead from them, and there were four golden chains on its corners. They locked down the cover of the pitch black casket, and the other end of those chains were within space.

Meanwhile, she suddenly said, “Lend me a hand!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she spoke softly, “An Ancient of my god race lies within that casket. That progenitor of the Confucianist Path sealed him here, and those chains carry his Scholarly Aura. They’re impossible to break without the help of the other progenitors. Oh, I forgot, there’s one other thing which can break those chains.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Yang Ye asked, “My sword?”

The woman nodded, “Your sword was jointly forged by numerous progenitors. It can be said to be at the peak of manmade treasures. While its Sword Spirit hasn’t awakened yet, the Scholarly Aura in those chains have been corroded for countless years, so they aren’t that strong anymore. Coupled with the fact that the mind of that Ancient has awakened within the casket, these chains can be destroyed if both of you work together from inside and outside!”

Yang Ye nodded and didn’t refuse. He walked over to the casket and withdrew the Sword Supreme. However, he seemed to have thought of something and gazed at her, “Why didn’t the Confucianist Progenitor try to stop you?”

She replied, “His enemy isn’t my god race, and my god race’s enemy isn’t him. At the very least, his Confucianist Path isn’t our enemy for now. So, we’ve chosen to stay out of each other’s business.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I see!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he raised his sword and swung it.

Hiss!

A ray of sharp sword energy tore through the air.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted extremely far away instead!

The woman suddenly appeared behind him and tapped his back, causing Yang Ye to instantly stop.

She said, “Use your Sword Domain and all your strength!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and released the Sword Domain, and then he grabbed his sword with both hands and swung it.

An ear piercing sword howl resounded through the bottom of the ocean.

Meanwhile, the casket suddenly started trembling violently, and a wave of powerful energy surged out from within it.

Bang!

The chains was instantly obliterated.

Meanwhile, a voice resounded, “I’m finally free!”

Yang Ye looked up, and then his expression changed. He raised his sword and swung it.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted away. At the same time, his sword vanished from his grasp.
