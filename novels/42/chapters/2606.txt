Chapter 2607 – A Decisive Attack!

If Yang Ye was still here, he would be surprised!

Because he happened to know this person! It was the Desolate Emperor!

The Desolate Emperor!

One of the peak experts of this world!

The Desolate Emperor glanced at the surroundings and smiled, “He’s pretty good indeed. He was able to grow even in such an environment by refusing to give up on his convictions and even reversing his own bloodline.”

He gazed at the Dark Lord, “The Eternal Lord asked you to keep him here, yet you’ve let him go. Dark Lord, are you taking my desolate race’s side?”

The Dark Lord replied indifferently, “The Darkspace will always remain neutral. It was like that in the past, and it will remain the same in the future.”

The Desolate Emperor smiled, “It’s different now. The Eternal Kingdom is linked to the Origin World and has taken control of that place. It’s very close to being considered as taking control of the Origin World. So…”

“Control the Origin World?” The Dark Lord suddenly interrupted him, “Desolate Emperor, are you kidding me? Needless to say, your strength is shocking, but trust me… If you dare to try and take control of the Origin World, your desolate race and you will vanish from this world!”

The Desolate Emperor smiled and didn’t offer any response.

The Dark Lord added, “Desolate Emperor, your ambition is too huge.”

The Desolate Emperor smiled, “It’s not a bad thing to have ambition, right? Anyway, you should be aware of what happened in that world. That young girl isn’t just slightly strong. She forced the Divine Abode’s master and Origin Master to show themselves, and even a few old geezers didn’t even dare to show their face.”

The Dark Lord said, “What are you trying to say?”

The Desolate Emperor shook his head, “Dark Lord, people like us are at our own limits. If we don’t do what we can, I’m sure you know what the final outcome will be. Besides that, what’s the point of living if we can’t go further?”

The Dark Lord fell silent.

The Desolate Emperor added, “What do you think?”

The Dark Lord replied, “That divine vein is the last one in the entire universe.”

The Desolate Emperor shook his head, “Do any emperors of the mortal world ascend the throne without leaving corpses behind? Everything is nothing more than an ant when compared to the Grand Dao.”

The Dark Lord shook her head, “My Darkspawn will not participate in that.”

The Desolate Emperor nodded slightly, “Remember what you’ve just said. I hope I don’t see you in the Eternal Kingdom. I respect you and the Darkspace, but if you break the rules… Heh!”

The Desolate Emperor vanished once he finished speaking.

A voice suddenly resounded from behind the Dark Lord, “Master, he’s too arrogant!”

The Dark Lord replied indifferently, “He’s determined this time. Forget it, just let him do as he wants!”

As soon as she finished speaking, the beam of light vanished, and the surroundings fell into darkness!

…

A long time passed before Yang Ye opened his eyes slowly, and a ray of dazzling sunlight entered his eyes!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and it was full of light!

He took a deep breath and smiled, “This world is still the best!”

Suddenly, the space before Yang Ye shook, and then his face turned icy cold!

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy flashed through the sky!

Meanwhile, the battle above the mountain range was at its peak!

Blood Maiden was still in battle with the extremely huge ape!

They were equally matched!

But the others down below were being completely suppressed. Especially those demons from the War Dimension. They were extremely strong, and if it wasn’t for Nether Maiden and the others, the disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect would have suffered a slaughter!

The Soul Exalt looked down coldly. The ground was covered in corpses, and most of them belonged to the disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect!

The Soul Exalt looked off to the side. Nether Maiden was fighting a Lord Realm expert from the Soul Sect!

The Soul Exalt’s face instantly turned gloomy from the sight of this. It was all because of these few women that the Ancient Sword Sect hadn’t been annihilated already!

Moreover, if they hadn’t appeared out of nowhere that day, Yang Ye and the Ancient Sword Sect would have vanished a long time ago too!

Thinking about this caused killing intent to arise in the Soul Exalt’s heart!

A moment later, he charged at Nether Maiden!

Nether Maiden seemed to have noticed this and swiftly looked over. Meanwhile, a powerful wave of Soul Energy arrived before her!

Nether Maiden’s pupils constricted, and then she raised her left palm and twisted it slightly. In an instant, the space before her was twisted. At the same time, the powerful Soul Energy actually started to warp.

However, the Soul Exalt suddenly appeared in front of her, and then a pitch black awl stabbed at her!

A Super Divine Treasure!

Bang!

An explosion resounded and a figure was blasted away!

It was Nether Maiden!

The soul exalt was about to attack again when a voice suddenly resounded in his mind, “Retreat!”

Retreat?

The Soul Exalt was stunned.

Retreat now?

The Soul Exalt looked up at the sky while bewilderment covered his face!

It was because that voice belonged to the Soul Master!

Moreover, the battle in the sky had stopped as well. The Demon Commander had received a similar order!

The ape exchanged a glance with the Soul Exalt. Even the Demon Commander was utterly bewildered!

Because victory was right before them!

Suddenly, a ray of light shot through the distant sky.

At this moment, everyone looked up at the sky, and the light was growing larger and faster!

The Soul Exalt’s face instantly turned unsightly!

Yang Ye!

That madman was back! He was back from Darkspace!

At this moment, the Soul Exalt had the desire to retreat!

But it was too late!

Yang Ye appeared in the sky. Nether Maiden, Blood Maiden, and all the others here heaved sighs of relief when they saw Yang Ye!

Yang Ye hadn’t shown himself until now, and they’d been worried that something had happened to him.

Now that they saw Yang Ye, they could finally heave sighs of relief!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and gazed at the ape, “You’re from the War Dimension?”

The ape glanced at Yang Ye and said, “What about it?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Very good. It’s the War Dimension that broke the rules first.”

Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot.

The Demon Commander’s pupils constricted slightly, and then he slammed his fist at Yang Ye!

It was a punch that could truly crush the world!

However, along with the descent of a ray of light, the huge fist fell to the ground.

Blood sprayed in all directions!

Everyone here was stunned, especially the Soul Exalt. At this moment, he was beyond shocked!

Yang Ye’s strength had already been extremely terrifying before this. Now, it was even more terrifying!

The ape was a peak Lord Realm expert, and his body was similarly at the peak of the Lord Realm. Yet now, he had lost an arm just like that!

It was like Yang Ye had been cutting through tofu!

It was too crazy!

At this moment, the Demon Commander was visibly stunned. He had sensed how powerful Yang Ye’s attack was, but he hadn’t expected it to be so strong to the point of instantly taking one of his arms!

What the heck was that?!

But that wasn’t the end of it. Once Yang Ye’s attack descended, he didn’t stop there. Yang Ye appeared before the ape, and then countless rays of sword energy descended like a storm.

The ape was horrified and took a step back. A moment later, he clenched his left fist and slammed it at Yang Ye!

The entire sky shook and rippled before it!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The entire sky was filled with the sound of flesh being sliced open as the ape’s body started to be sliced off, inch by inch, before countless pieces of flash rained down from above!

Yang Ye swung his sword swiftly, and every single swing would make a thick chunk of flesh drop from the air.

Meanwhile, all the other experts here were utterly stunned!

Suddenly, Yang Ye stopped, and he was behind the ape. As for the ape, his eyes were blank and without a shred of color!

Dead!

A Demon Commander of the War Dimension had died just like that!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye gazed at the Soul Exalt. The latter revealed a ferocious look on his face, and then the Soul Awl started spinning before shooting at Yang Ye.

Hiss!

The Soul Awl emanated powerful Soul Energy as it shot toward Yang Ye!

At this moment, the Soul Exalt was using all his strength on the Soul Awl!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye swung his sword!

The Domain Sword!

It stabbed straight against the Soul Awl.

The Soul Awl and Yang Ye’s Executor shook violently, but just a moment later, the Soul Energy around the Soul Awl was instantly dispersed while Yang Ye’s sword intent and sword energy still remained!

It was obvious who the victor was!

Yang Ye twisted his right hand.

Bang!

The Soul Awl was blasted away!

Suddenly, the Soul Exalt appeared before Yang Ye, and he was holding the Soul Awl which had just been blasted away!

Yang Ye remained indifferent when he saw the Soul Exalt, and he just stood there as if he’d been frozen on the spot!

A bad feeling arose in the Soul Exalt’s heart. But at this moment, he had no choice but to complete the attack!

Suddenly, Yang Ye Drew his sword.

Everything fell silent!

The Soul Exalt stopped on the spot and seemed frozen there!

Yang Ye was already behind him!

Hiss!

The Soul Exalt’s head flew up into the air. His soul was about to escape, but Yang Ye swung a backhand slash that pierced through the soul!

Dead!FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye sheathed his sword!

Yang Ye turned to gaze at Blood Maiden who’d arrived before him. He cracked a smile when he noticed the shock in her eyes, “During this time that I was in that place, I could instantly kill anything that arrived within 3m of me!”
