Chapter 2457 – Kill!

Erya was absolutely devastated.

While she was no human, she was raised by humans. Rainy and Eggsy were her friends she’d grown up with in the village. They were her human friends. Yet now, they were dead, killed by humans!

Yang Ye walked over to Erya, squatted down, and gently wiped off her tears, “Let’s go.”

She looked up at him, “Where?”

Yang Ye replied, “To kill!”

Kill!

Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda, glanced at the surroundings, and left!

White Emperor City!

Yang Ye went to White Emperor City first. At this moment, it wasn’t as bustling as it used to be, or it should be described as being quite desolate!

There were very few people here, and it was like an empty city.

Yang Ye frowned from the sight of this, and he wondered if something had happened.

Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye frowned before White Emperor Hall because the city governor was gone!

Bai Zhixian appeared here, and her face was extremely pale.

Yang Ye turned around and grabbed to the right, causing a young man to be brought over to him.

The young man gazed at Yang Ye with astonishment, “You…”

Meanwhile, Bai Zhixian suddenly asked, “What happened?”

The young man gazed at her, and as soon as he saw her, he hurriedly said, “Y-You’re the City Governor!”

Bai Zhixian nodded, “What happened here?”

The young man said, “T-The Former City Governor was taken.”

Bai Zhixian’s face fell. Obviously, it was the experts of Eternal Kingdom!

The young man continued, “Once they found out that Yang Ye and you offended Eternal Kingdom, the people of the city didn’t dare to stay any longer. All of them were afraid of being implicated and fled the city.”

Bai Zhixian said, “You can go!”

The man hesitated for a moment and left.

White Emperor City was a place that could absolutely not be lived in. Because according to rumor, Eternal Kingdom was planning to kill everyone linked to Yang Ye. The city governor had been taken, but who knew if Eternal Kingdom would annihilate White Emperor City too?

They were afraid, even if it was only a slim chance!

The people of White Emperor City were fleeing, so it was clearly an empty city now!

Yang Ye went over to Bai Zhixian’s side and said, “Don’t worry, I’m their target, not your father!”

She shook her head slightly, “They are serious this time. Just as Butcher said, they are acting against you, and they are using you as an example!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “It’s fine, practically everyone who targeted me in the past is dead, and they will be no exception!”

Bai Zhixian gazed at him for a long time and cracked a smile, “You’re still so domineering and confident, and that’s what I like about you!”

She hugged him gently, “I’ll accompany you through everything!”

Yang Ye hugged her tight. This was all a husband could ever ask for!

Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye left the city.

Yang Ye turned back and took one last glance at the city before vanishing into the sky.

There were things that couldn’t just be left alone, and there were debts that had to be repaid!

In the boundless reaches of space, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then flipped his palm. A sword appeared in his grasp.

He swung it!

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy sliced open the space here!

It completely destroyed the space here!

Destroying the world!

That swing of his sword had obliterated a huge expanse of space, completely obliterated it!

Yang Ye swung his sword, over and over again!

Finally, after he swung it over a dozen times, an old man appeared nearby.

It was the Guardian, Qing Xing!

Qing Xing glanced at Yang Ye, “What do you want?”

Actually, he didn’t really want to show himself before Yang Ye, especially at a time like this. But he had no other choice because if he refused to show himself, then even if Yang Ye refrained from destroying Eternal Border, he would severely damage it.

Yang Ye put his sword away, “I thought you Guardians wouldn’t show yourselves!”

Qing Xing spoke solemnly, “Yang Ye, I know you’re unhappy, but look at the situation that Eternal Border is in right now! We’re stuck between Eternal Kingdom and the desolate race, so if we still engage in internal strife, then once the war begins, then our Eternal Border will…”

“It’s your Eternal Border!” Yang Ye interrupted him abruptly, “It’s not mine.”

Qing Xing stared at Yang Ye, “They are right. You don’t think of yourself as someone from Eternal Border. If you want to rescue the governor of White Emperor City and take revenge, then go to the end of the Eternal River. It’s where the experts of Eternal Kingdom must pass.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Qing Xing’s figure gradually turned ethereal!

It wasn’t his real body!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly because Qing Xing had just been a strand of the soul!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, “Show yourself!”

A woman soundlessly appeared nearby!

Nanli Meng!

She was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly said, “Tell me what I want to know and I guarantee your clan’s safety!”

She glanced at him and asked, “What if I refuse?”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Do as you want!”

He turned around and walked away.

Suddenly, a beam of white light appeared before Yang Ye.

She suddenly said, “Everything is in there!”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, and then the beam of light entered his forehead. A short while later, a huge amount of information appeared in his mind.

Meanwhile, Nanli Meng said, “Take care.”

Yang Ye turned around and glanced at her, “You could have just given it to me. In that way, we would still be friends, right?”

She smiled, “I don’t like ingratiating myself with others or trying to curry favor with others.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I thought of you as a friend.”

Nanli Meng looked him in the eyes, “I’m from Eternal Border. While I won’t risk my life to protect it, I do not hope to see it get destroyed. Yang Ye, I understand your desire for revenge, but please show mercy to Eternal Border. Even if the day comes when Eternal Border is destroyed, I hope it isn’t by your hands.”

She turned around and left.

Yang Ye shook his head and vanished on the spot.

Destroy Eternal Border?

He wasn’t that insane. There was a culprit for everything, and he refused to kill those who didn’t deserve death. However, he wouldn’t spare any of those who deserved it!

Meanwhile, Nanli Meng sighed softly. She knew that based on Yang Ye’s character, if she refused to give him what he wanted, then he would be capable of anything.

Nanli Meng glanced at the surroundings and sighed softly. All those years ago, there had been countless experts here during the Primal Era, and that was why Eternal Border had been able to survive the war. Because those experts had been united, and they fought to the death for Eternal Border. That was why Eternal Border had received the Sprite Progenitor’s protection and even aroused the pity of Eternal Kingdom. While they hadn’t fully opened Eternal Kingdom to Eternal Border, they had specially allowed some people to enter from Eternal Border.

Was it a way of giving alms?

It did feel like that, but so what? Eternal Border was weaker than Eternal Kingdom! So, even their scraps was something that could satisfy Eternal Border.

Countless experts had fought for Eternal Broder in the past, yet now, Eternal Border was engaging in internal strife!

Eternal Border’s fate was worrying!

Nanli Meng shook her head, “All of you brought this upon yourselves!”

She vanished on the spot.

…

At a boundless mountain range, a magnificent palace stood deep within the mountains, and a huge door stood before the palace.

The Longevity Sect!

The Longevity Sect was one of the few mysterious powers in Eternal Border. It could be said that the Longevity Sect, Freedom Sect, Creation Sect, and Immortality Sect were the top four sects of Eternal Border after the Primal Era.

Actually, the Immortal Estate had almost joined their ranks to become the fifth. Unfortunately, after their founding ancestor, Yi Shuihan, left, the Immortal Estate failed to produce another extraordinary genius.

Suddenly, a man in green clothes appeared before the Longevity Sect.

It was Yang Ye. He looked up at the door, and he felt that it was truly huge!

Suddenly, a middle aged man appeared before Yang Ye, and his eyes narrowed slightly, “Who are you?”

Yang Ye moved his gaze away from the door and swung his sword.

Hiss!

The door before him was sliced apart, and then two rays of sword energy flashed.

Hiss! Hiss!

The falling halves of the door were instantly sliced into bits!

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye with shock, “Y-You’re Yang Ye…”

In the beginning, he felt that the man before him seemed quite familiar, and once Yang Ye swung his sword, he was certain.

The young man before him was Yang Ye!

Yang Ye looked up at the middle aged man, “It’s time for the Longevity Sect to vanish from this world.”

Yang Ye swung his sword once he finished speaking!

At the same time, a seal appeared above the middle aged man.

The Seal of Suppression!

Yang Ye didn’t want to waste time! As soon as the Seal of Suppression appeared, the middle aged man was suppressed to the Three World Realm.

At this moment, despair covered his face. Not to mention the Three World Realm, he wasn’t confident in being able to resist Yang Ye’s attack even if he was at the Four World Realm!

Hiss!Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

A ray of light slashed down from above him!

Yang Ye sheathed his sword and walked toward the palace ahead.

Meanwhile, a breath of time passed before the middle aged man’s body behind Yang Ye split open at the center and blood splattered all over the ground.
