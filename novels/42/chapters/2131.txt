Chapter 2132 – Nether Maiden!

Lin Zhen asked, “Who’s teaching there?”

The old man hesitated for a moment and replied, “I can’t tell for sure either. Patriarch, I’m sure you’re aware that while our Lin Clan is a clan of scholars, we focus on martial cultivation. So, practically no one cares about that!”

Meanwhile, Shu Ya suddenly said, “It was Grandpa Scholar!”

“Grandpa Scholar?” Lin Zhen’s body trembled slightly.

A short while passed before he walked over to Shu Ya and asked, “What did he tell you?”

Shu Ya replied softly, “A gentleman should always work hard on improvement!”

Lin Zhen fell silent.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye withdrew the Scholarly Sage Brush and passed it to Shu Ya, and the latter gazed at Yang Ye with bewilderment.

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s for you!”

But Shu Ya shook his head, “No, I did nothing to deserve it.”

Yang Ye replied, “It’s a very, very good treasure!”

Shu Ya shook his head, and he was adamant on it.

Suddenly, the brush shrunk down to the size of an ordinary brush.

Shu Ya glanced at it and was slightly tempted. Because he dreamed of obtaining a brush, but he still shook his head.

Yang Ye glanced at Shu Ya’s pockets, there was half a bun there. Yang Ye smiled, “Why don’t we do this? I’m very hungry, so I’ll trade this brush for that bun, alright?”

Shu Ya looked up at Yang Ye and asked, “R-Really?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Shu Ya hesitated for a moment, and then he passed it to Yang Ye, “Big Brother, this bun isn’t worth that brush, so I can’t trade it with you! Gentlemen don’t bully others!”

As he spoke, he bowed respectfully to Lin Zhen, “Patriarch, I’m going to sweep the library. I-I’m leaving.”

He left decisively once he finished speaking.

Suddenly, the brush transformed into a ray of golden light that entered his body, but Shu Ya didn’t notice it!

Lin Zhen gazed at Yang Ye, “What was that?”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “The Scholarly Sage Brush!”

Lin Zhen and the old man’s figures stiffened upon hearing that. A long time passed before Lin Zhen took a deep breath and said, “From this moment onward, Shu Ya is my personal disciple, and he’s the next patriarch of the Lin Clan.”

His voice was trembling.

The Confucianist Progenitor had taken a liking to him, and the Scholarly Sage Brush had chosen him. It was obvious that Shu Ya wasn’t ordinary. Even if Shu Ya was very ordinary now and there was nothing outstanding about him, Lin Zhen had made that decision without the slightest hesitation!

The Scholarly Sage Brush!

The number one treasure of the Confucianist Path!

With that in the Lin Clan’s possession, the Lin Clan would definitely rise up if it didn’t court death along the way. As for the child called Shu Ya, he would definitely be extraordinary in the future.

Actually, Yang Ye’s way of thinking was different.

Lin Zhen thought highly of Shu Ya because of the Scholarly Sage Brush, but Yang Ye didn’t. Shu Ya was of lowly birth, yet he held no resentment. Moreover, he was a man of principle, and it was something that many couldn’t accomplish.

The first half of a person’s life depended on natural talent, but the second half depended on mentality and character.

Mentality was more important than natural talent!

Meanwhile, Lin Zhen gazed at Yang Ye, “I have to thank you for this.”

The Scholarly Sage Brush was no ordinary treasure. Since Yang Ye had been able to avoid trying to take possession of it and had brought it to the Lin Clan instead, it really surprised him.

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “Patriarch Lin, I’m sure you’ve realized that his natural talent isn’t very good. However, natural talent isn’t everything. All those years ago, I was just a labor disciple. While my natural talent wasn’t very bad in my sect, it wasn’t the best. But I’ve come all the way here now.”

Lin Zhen naturally understood what Yang Ye meant. He immediately nodded, “Don’t worry, I won’t treat him unfairly. Even if he’s ordinary before the age of 20, I still won’t treat him unfairly.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Patriarch Lin, you probably will have to give him even more time. Of course, I’m sure you know better when it comes to how to nurture a child, nurture the child’s mentality, and nurture the child’s natural talent. I’m only saying all of this because of that bun. I wouldn’t be able to sleep well if I didn’t say a few words on his behalf after taking his bun for no reason!”

Lin Zhen couldn’t help but smile when he heard this, “Anyway, thank you.”

Yang Ye nodded, “It’s time for me to go too. If anyone finds out I’m here, your clan will probably face quite a bit of trouble!”

Lin Zhen pondered deeply for a moment and said, “It’s best if you are careful in the near future.”

Yang Ye gazed at Lin Zhen, “Huh?”

Lin Zhen hesitated for a moment and said, “According to my knowledge, the Alliance of All has no intention of sparing you. Because you have that Sprite Lord, and every faction needs a Sprite Lord now. They really need one. Some large-scale teleportation formations and other things all require spirit energy, and a Sprite Lord is a living treasury of spirit energy. So, they will definitely target you! Even though my Lin Clan isn’t among the higher-ups of the Alliance of All, we still have access to some information. They should be taking action soon!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Thank you for the warning. Farewell!”

Yang Ye didn’t stay a moment longer and left.

Once he left, the old man beside Lin Zhen suddenly said, “He’s not like the rumors say!”

Lin Zhen nodded, “Looks like the Sovereign of Man really can’t be fully trusted!”

The old man said, “It’s an impasse. Perhaps his enmity with the Sovereign of Man can be resolved, but he possesses a Sprite Lord. As far as the Alliance of All is concerned, they must obtain the Sprite Lord. Even if they can’t obtain it, they absolutely can’t let it fall into the hands of the god race. Once the Sprite Lord falls into the hands of the god race, it represents that the god race will hold control of all spirit energy, and it’s absolutely not something they want.”

Lin Zhen nodded slightly, “No matter what, it has nothing to do with our Lin Clan. From this moment onward, place our focus on Shu Ya, and don’t change his current life. Try your best to create some difficulties for him, and then slowly improve his current situation. His mental state will be spoiled if he instantly becomes the center of our Lin Clan.”

“Alright!” The old man nodded and left.

…

After he left Nature Sacred Grounds, Yang Ye didn’t leave the Human Dimension. He went to Yang Lianshuang’s location instead.

He wanted to go look for everyone from the Nether Pavilion.

When it came to Shao Siyou’s appearance in the Confucianist Dimension, Yang Ye wanted to figure out everything about it. While these organizations had nothing to do with him, it was best to take precautions against them. After all, he wasn’t alone in the large universe, there were many people linked to him.

In a room, Yang Lianshuang remained silent for a long time before she said, “Is it really linked to Shao Siyou?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Yang Lianshuang frowned, and she fell silent again. A long time passed before she stood up and said, “Seriously, I feel like the entire large universe is in a huge vortex. I’ve gained a lot of information from you. The Alliance of All, the three paths, Martial Emperor Academy, the prehistoric race, and the Universe Sprite. Besides that, there’s the question about why the prehistoric race vanished mysteriously and why they’ve shown themselves again now, and then there’s Shao Siyou. The Nether Pavilion existed in the past, so why has it shown itself again now? It’s so chaotic.”

“It is!” Yang Ye continued, “Now, we are within this vortex, and we can’t escape.”

“Strength!” Yang Lianshuang spoke abruptly, “Your current strength is strong, very, very strong. You’re strong to the point of being capable of killing Sages. However, it’s still too weak before some organizations. But you have a Sprite Lord and the precious treasure of the Dao Path. So, your life is destined to never be peaceful. What I’m trying to say is, you must get stronger.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I can’t advance to the Sage Realm in a short amount of time!”

He was no monstrous genius, so he couldn’t just advance to a higher realm of cultivation because he wanted to!

Yang Lianshuang nodded slightly, “True. I was being too impatient. Right, you wanted Nether Maiden’s whereabouts, and I have it. You’ll definitely never guess what she’s doing.”

Yang Ye asked, “What?”

Yang Lianshuang smiled, “She’s actually learning how to be a doctor, and she’s treating patients every day. She’s having quite a nice life now.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “I’ll go pay her a visit.”

Yang Lianshuang, “Are you really just going there to pay her a visit?”

Yang Ye replied, “Yes. While I really want them to come with me because I’ll be much more confident in dealing with the Alliance of All if I have them by my side, I don’t want to disturb their peaceful lives.”

Yang Lianshuang said, “If you really don’t want to disturb her, then don’t go see her!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m going to see them because I have something to tell them. Besides that, you’re being too pedantic. Being unwilling to trouble them doesn’t mean that I can’t even meet them.”

Yang Lianshuang said, “Do as you like. What about An Nanjing?”

Yang Ye asked, “Martial Emperor Academy?”

She nodded, “Do you want me to contact her?”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “I’ll go look for her myself!”

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang said, “You really must drag her over to our side. Her natural talent is the most terrifying I’ve ever seen. Once she gets serious, I think even you may not be a match for her!”

Yang Ye smiled, “That is true!”

Actually, he was really curious about how strong An Nanjing was now.

After chatting with Yang Lianshuang for a while, Yang Ye left.

There was a remote area to the south of the Human Dimension, and there was a small city there. It wasn’t really quite small because it only had around 100,000 residents.

A black robed man suddenly appeared at its entrance. It was Yang Ye.

Yang Ye looked up at the city.

Northern Arrival City.

Yang Ye entered the city and walked along its streets to a corner. There was an inconspicuous shop there, and there was a woman in it.

Bare feet, linen clothes, and a linen dress!

It was Nether Maiden.

At this moment, she was looking down while inspecting the herbs and other treasures before her.

Yang Ye was about to go over when clamorous noise suddenly resounded in the city. Yang Ye looked over, and he saw a cavalry rush swiftly in this direction while led by a young man.

It didn’t take long for the young man and the cavalry behind him to stop in front of Nether Maiden’s shop. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The young man leaped off his horse and strode over to Nether Maiden, “Woman, I’ve lost my patience. All I want to know today is if you’re going to come with me!”

Nether Maiden didn’t even look up at him, “No!”

The young man was livid when he heard this, “Woman, if I get angry, even the world will tremble before me!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless by this.
