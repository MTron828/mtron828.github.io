Chapter 2353: Human

Feng Hailuan screamed in pain as his vitality declined greatly.

He had long since cultivated the Mystery Realms of the body, but now they were forcefully destroyed by Ling Han, which naturally caused him serious injuries.

“What are you howling for? Weren’t you speaking very tough?” Ling Han tossed him onto the ground, and a?crack?was heard with a forceful stomp. Feng Hailuan instantly released a harsh cry. His left leg had been forcefully broken, the broken bone exposed, red and white all over.

“How does it feel to be bullied?” Ling Han followed with another stomp. Feng Hailuan’s right leg was also broken, the part of his knee directly sunk in. Only a bit of torn flesh was left connected to his calf.

“Fun, right?” Ling Han smirked coldly, raising his foot high. This time, he was aiming straight for the place between Feng Hailuan’s legs.

Feng Hailuan was almost crazy with panic. Being injured by an elite of Ling Han’s level would leave behind extremely serious aftereffects. For example, he would need at least a few thousand years to heal his broken bones, if a Heavenly Venerate or Ancestral King did not interfere.

And if his crotch was stomped on, it was a small matter that he would not be able to use his d*ck for a few thousand years. More importantly, the psychological humiliation would mean that he would be living in a nightmare for the rest of his life.

On the other side, Little Terror had also pounced on Sihuang Yun, harshly biting into his bottom. Sihuang Yun was in so much pain that he was sprawled out on the ground. He was continuously kicking out with his legs, as if it was better for him to die than be alive at this moment.

This man and beast, or master and servant were really both too powerful!

“Hehe, as expected of the champion of the Elite Leaderboard of the Thousand Academy Tournament, impressive!” Applause rang out, and a young girl from the Demon Race appeared. Her features were actually quite delicate, but accompanied with the looks of the Demon Race, she still did not match the aesthetic values of Ling Han and the others.

However, Xu Xing’s eyes immediately lit up. He was a genuine member of the Demon Race.

Ling Han’s foot was still planted on Feng Hailuan, but his eyes turned towards this girl from the Demon Race, and his gaze involuntarily became tense.

This was a Ninth Lotus Second Leaf elite!

“Zi Shuang.” This girl from the Demon Race pointed at herself. She possessed an incredibly voluptuous figure, shapely and seductive. Though she still had a tail, it was still a uniquely beautiful sight.

“Junior Brother Ba, you’re not really thinking of killing these junior brothers of mine, right?” She laughed lightly, as if she had absolutely no plans to save Sihuang Yun and Feng Hailuan

Yet Feng Hailuan and Sihuang Yun were both very aware. The competition between them, the people under the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity, was incredibly intense, especially when they were of the same cultivation level because their cultivation resources were similar, which would definitely mean a harsh contest between them.

This was also the deliberate arrangement of the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity. This was just like raising “Gu,” where only the strongest elite would stand out from the?rest1.

Ling Han smiled slightly, and replied, “This man intended to kill me. Why can’t I kill him?”

“This is my junior brother. If you kill him, I can only kill you.” Zi Shuang sighed, appearing to feel very regretful.

This woman was very interesting. She made no mention of wanting to save Feng Hailuan, but rather only spoke of revenge. She was practically saying that she did not care at all about this junior brother, but because they were both of the Desolate Eternity’s line, she had to do something, and eliminate his murderer.

“Moreover, even if I am no match for you, there are still seven senior brothers and two senior sisters here. Seven of them are Ninth Lotus Third Leaf, and two have already ascended to become Ancestral Kings.

“Junior Brother Ba, are you going to kill everyone?” She looked at Ling Han with her large eyes, which were shining brightly.

In the eyes of a member of the Demon Race like herself, Ling Han was extremely handsome.

Ling Han’s demeanor was grave and stern, and though his Body Art had surpassed his cultivation level, it could match early stage Ninth Lotus Third Leaf at most. It would be delusional to hope for even the slightest bit more. To say nothing of Ancestral Kings, even a Ninth Lotus Third Leaf monarch star was enough trouble for him to contend with.

However, he was not the kind of person that was used to threats, either. With him exerting slight force with his foot, Feng Hailuan was instantly waving his limbs with all his might. Ling Han had placed his foot on the latter’s throat, and a frightening pressure was transmitted, making him feel like death was really just around the corner.

“Junior Brother Ba!” Zi Shuang switched her expression, and smiled genially. “In the future, we will all be family. A family naturally has to be harmonious, don’t you think so?”

A smile slowly appeared on Ling Han’s face as he said, “Senior Sister is right.”

He slowly withdrew his foot, while Little Terror immediately loosened its fangs with a cry. With a leap, it darted next to his feet, rubbing against his leg, and looking completely like a cute pet that was begging for a rub.

Zi Shuang showed a hint of wariness. Not only did Ling Han have heaven-defying strength, he could be flexible as well, and did not have the stubborn pride that an ordinary monarch star would usually have.

If this kind of person became an enemy, that would be very, very troublesome.

“This is a wise action.” She smiled dazzlingly. Under the banner of the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity, there were a total of 19 disciples that were at the Ninth Lotus. They all had a competitive relationship with one another, but if they fought alone, it was extremely likely that others would ally together to target them.

Hence, she, too, wished to seek an ally, and as someone who was also of the Demon Race, and whose strength was incredibly powerful, Ling Han naturally was a very good candidate.

Ling Han smiled as well. “Thank you for the compliment, Senior Sister.”

“Follow me up the mountain, all of you.” Zi Shuang did not even cast a second look at Sihuang Yun and Feng Hailuan. As long as they were not dead, she couldn’t be bothered to care.

She led the way ahead of them, her behind swaying accompanied by captivating seduction. Even if they were Angel Race, Holy Beast, or Insect Race, they could not deny that this woman’s figure was really extremely hot.

There was no need to speak of Xu Xing here, as his eyes had not been lifted from her all this while.

It was no wonder that he would be attracted. There were not many monarch stars that could be worthy of him, and it was naturally even more difficult to find a beauty who was also from the Demon Race.

No one gave any regard to Feng Hailuan and Sihuang Yun. After a long while, they finally managed to get back to their feet. One was covered all over with bite wounds, while the other had both his legs broken, his abdomen ripped through, and at least half his head missing.

“If I don’t exact revenge, I will die!”

“I will definitely tear this brat to pieces!”

The two of them made a declaration with gritted teeth. Exchanging a look, they both smirked. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

On the other side, Ling Han and his group followed Zi Shuang up the mountain, and after traveling for a very long while, the fog finally dispersed. Everyone stowed their respective tokens as well.

Zi Shuang didn’t use a token, for there was no such need. The line of Desolate Eternity had cultivated a unique cultivation technique, so they would not be affected by this fog. Otherwise, even an Eighteenth Lotus Ancestral King would lose his way here.

Because this was something set up by a Heavenly Venerate!

“Come, have some tea first. Exalted Master’s real self has been cultivating all this while, and he has left behind a sliver of thought that has been roaming outside his body. He should be returning in a few days.” Zi Shuang smiled as she received them.

This was a drawing room, and was not all that glorious or splendid, but it had an imposing air.

In the drawing room, all the furniture was made of stone. It appeared to be shockingly old, exuding a feeling of age and history.

“Tea!” Zi Shuang shouted lightly, and a servant came not too long after, bearing a tea tray.

Ling Han and the others all looked surprised. It was not how astonishing this servant looked, or how exceedingly high his cultivation level was, but rather that this person was actually a human.

A human!

In the territory of the Foreign Realm, a human had actually appeared!

This was a man that looked to be in his thirties. Docile and submissive, he looked completely like a loyal slave.

Ling Han’s heart involuntarily clenched. He had never expected that he would see a human here, and judging from the look of things, he seemed to have long forgotten the grudge with the Foreign Realm, and was filled with subservience.
