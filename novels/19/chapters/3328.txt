Chapter 3329: Hong Tianbu’s subordinate

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Fang Ziping stopped in front of Huan Xue, smiled faintly, and said, “Does Ling Han live here?”

“What do you want?” Huan Xue tightened her grip, causing the perverted pig to instantly spit out his tongue.

“Tell Ling Han to come out,” Fang Ziping raised his voice slightly.

“You have to pass through me first!” Huan Xue said as she raised the perverted pig as a shield.

She had heard from Young Master that this pig was extremely tolerant, so it was fine even if she used it as a shield.

“Gu!” The little perverted pig kicked its four short legs quickly, feeling extremely depressed.

It was one thing for Ling Han to use it as a shield, but why had even Huan Xue become like this, b@stard?

Fang Ziping, however, didn’t take Huan Xue or the perverted pig seriously at all. He was an Extreme Bone Tier elite, so how could he possibly care about a Blood Transformation Tier cultivator?

He directly shot out a punch. Peng, the courtyard wall immediately collapsed.

“How dare you!” Huan Xue was furious, and charged forward with her sword in hand.

Fang Ziping casually threw a punch, and instantly, Huan Xue was sent flying. She passed through the courtyard and crashed into the inner wall.

Kuang, the inner wall crumbled, revealing a large hole.

In an instant, Ling Han’s figure appeared at the hole, looking directly at Fang Ziping.

He had just been concentrating his full attention on studying that circular plate, and had not thought that the wall would suddenly be blasted through, and then the little handmaiden collapsed in front of him.

With Ling Han’s protective personality, he was instantly angered.

Fang Ziping was completely unconcerned. He looked back at Ling Han, and said calmly, “You are very bold, to actually dare to disobey my command.” Obviously, he was the one who had written the note.

Ling Han’s heart blazed with fury, but his expression was extremely calm, as he said, “You are also quite bold, to actually dare to hurt my maid.”

Fang Ziping faltered for a moment before bursting into laughter.

After a while, he stopped laughing, and said, “You’re called the second Heavenly Dao, and this makes subordinates like us very displeased. You are just some random nobody, and you think that just because you achieved some results, you can be on par with our Lord?”

“However, the Lord is generous, so he asked me to give you a choice. Join the Hong Clan Gang.”

“You still have one last chance.”

Hong Tianbu was truly conceited. He couldn’t even be bothered to personally deal with Ling Han. Instead, he simply sent a subordinate.

However, he did indeed have reason to be conceited. Fang Ziping was in the Extreme Bone Tier, so wouldn’t it be easy for him to suppress a Blood Transformation Tier elite?

Ling Han smiled calmly, and said, “If you kneel down now and apologize to my maidservant, I can consider only breaking one of your arms!”

“Haha, you’re indeed arrogant!” Fang Ziping shook his head, and said, “Junior Brother, you’re too young. You have no idea how astonishing the Lord’s might was in the past. He alone can rival the world, and you can’t even compare to him.”

“Since you’re so stupid, let me use my fists to teach you a lesson!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Fang Ziping stretched out his hands and clenched them into fists. Boom! Fiery flames actually started to burn on his hands.

“Yi, what’s going on?”

“Heavens, how could there be flames burning on his hand?”

“I feel that these flames are very frightening. I feel that if I come into contact with them, my whole person would be burnt into ashes.”

The surrounding students were all astounded. Merely a glance was enough to cause a chill to rise up in their hearts. Just how terrifying was the might of this flame?

Yet Ling Han was surprised. Fang Ziping could actually use his Spiritual Power, to stimulate the energy of a higher level!

Hong Tianbu was truly remarkable.

Spirit Diagrams were needed to stimulate higher-level energy, and Spirit Diagrams should be extremely valuable items, but first, there was Hong Tianliang, and then Fang Ziping. Both of them could stimulate higher-level energy, and they were different energies at that.

In other words, Hong Tianbu had mastered at least two types of Spirit Diagrams. His luck was truly good.

Ling Han scoffed, and said, “You think you’re the only one who knows how to do it?”

With a shake of his hands, golden light instantly flickered.

“En?” Fang Ziping couldn’t help but look surprised. “A Blood Transformation Tier cultivator can actually grasp high-level energy?”

“I’m going to beat you up even!” Ling Han shot out a punch. Boom, a burst of power shot out, bringing with it golden energy, greatly increasing the might of this attack.

Fang Ziping also threw a punch. Peng! The two powers and two types of energy clashed fiercely. Not only did a powerful shockwave surge out, but there was also the chaotic flicker of golden light and sparks.

“I’ve really underestimated you!” Fang Ziping waved his hand, appearing very relaxed, “Your power is actually at the first level of Extreme Bone Tier!” ‘What!’

The people in the area were all stunned. Ling Han was too freakish, wasn’t he? Based on his information, he was still only a Second Change.

No wonder this guy could suppress all the prodigies of the other parties in the hunting competition and get the first place.

Ling Han stared coldly at Fang Ziping, and said, “Apologize!”

“You think you’re worthy!” Fang Ziping scoffed.

Ling Han took a deep breath. The other’s strength was indeed very strong. It was very possible that he was an existence of Fourth Extreme or even Fifth Extreme, but how could he possibly swallow his anger?

His own people had been beaten, so if he didn’t step out, would he still be able to stand tall in future?

They could only battle.

Hong Tianbu, oh Hong Tianbu, in the end, he still made a move on him. Though this person had not personally appeared, and had only sent out one of his subordinates, having an Extreme Bone Tier deal with a Blood Transformation Tier, this was still a one-sided suppression.

‘Humph! What heaven-suppressing freak? Is this all you’ve got?’

Xiu, Ling Han charged out. He had already drawn the broken sword. Shua, as the sword slashed out, Sword Qi danced unhindered.

The advantage of a Spirit Tool was that it didn’t need to expend one’s own Spiritual Power. It could stimulate high-level energy and turn it into an attack.

At the same time, Ling Han’s left hand clenched into a fist. His fury was flaring, affecting his mood, and he couldn’t help but use Fists of Fury.

His punch was imbued with a high-level golden energy, and it could be said to be indestructible.

“No matter how freakish you are, you’re only a Blood Transformation Tier cultivator,” Fang Ziping said with a cold chuckle. He brandished his fists in response.

Peng, peng, peng! The two of them were extremely quick, and their attacks continued to blast towards one another.

Fang Ziping couldn’t help but look surprised. This was because Ling Han’s fist strength had indeed reached the level of First Extreme, but compared to him, it was still far inferior. However, Ling Han’s grasp of high-level energy was much stronger than his.

How was this possible!

He was an Extreme Bone Tier elite, and his level of being far surpassed Ling Han’s. Logically speaking, the strength of his Spiritual Power should have overwhelmed Ling Han’s.

However, the high-level energy that he stimulated was inferior to Ling Han’s. What did this mean?

The other party’s Spirit Diagram was definitely higher in level than his.

He instantly grew a covetous desire. Although the majority of cultivators didn’t know the amazing uses of Spiritual Power, which could communicate with high-level energy, he had traveled the world with Hong Tianbu and learned this technique, so he naturally knew how much the battle prowess would improve after grasping high-level energy.

Thus, when he discovered that Ling Han had grasped a higher grade Spirit Diagram, a powerful longing naturally rose up from the bottom of his heart. He definitely had to get hold of it.

“Brat, I’ll show you my true strength!” He laughed loudly, and using two times the speed of sound, he charged towards Ling Han.

He raised his left hand high, and suddenly stabbed out. Strangely, a long spear actually stretched out from his fist..
