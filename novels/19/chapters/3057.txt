3058 Disdain

Someone in front of Wang Quanhe turned around and sneered.

It was a young man in embroidered clothes. He had just noticed that a little beggar of Heavenly Body Tier had suddenly appeared behind him, and a look of disgust instantly appeared on his face.

The test didn’t take long, only 10 breaths, but there were so many people lining up. How long would it take until it was his turn?

Was he going to endure this little beggar’s stench forever?

It was disgusting just thinking about it!

“Little beggar, get lost!” the young man in embroidered clothes said disdainfully. He was a Severing Mundane Tier, and he could kill Wang Quanhe a few hundred times with a single glance.

Wang Quanhe gritted his teeth. If he were still the young master of the Wang Clan, he would have immediately slammed the table and stood up when he heard this.

But now, he knew what kind of situation he was in.

So what if he was still the young master of the Wang Clan? His opponent was a Severing Mundane Tier, and the latter could kill him countless times with a single hand.

This was the manor of a Celestial King, so no matter how arrogant the other party was, he wouldn’t dare to make a move.

He would endure this!

The young man in embroidered clothes pinched his nose with a look of disdain, as if he felt that Wang Quanhe was still emitting a stench. His eyes were filled with contempt.

“Little beggar, are you going to scram or not?” he said balefully. “Even if I don’t make a move here, do you think you can pass the test?

“That’s impossible.

“Then as soon as you step out of this door, I’ll let you know regret!”

Wang Quanhe’s body trembled. He hadn’t expected the other party to be so unreasonable.

Just because he was lining up behind the other party and his clothes were a little tattered, he was despised to the point that the latter wanted to kill him?

His clothes were a little tattered, but there was definitely no stench. He had already cleaned them before coming here.

Should he persist?

He couldn’t die. If he died, the Wang Clan would really have no hope at all.

However, this might be another opportunity to take revenge on the clan.

No, he couldn’t retreat. If he retreated, he might also retreat step by step when he encountered all kinds of opportunities in the future. He would never have the chance to take his revenge.

If he did not fight, how could he surpass the Li Clan and take revenge for the extermination of his family?

“Hahaha!” Many people in front laughed.

This was naturally to mock the young man in embroidered clothes. He had already said such harsh words, but he still couldn’t scare away a little beggar who was only a Heavenly Body Tier. How embarrassing.

The young man in embroidered clothes couldn’t help but flush. He was truly furious.

“Good! Good! Good!” he balefully said. “You actually dare to disobey me, Lei Dong. You’re really audacious! Since you don’t know the immensity of heaven and earth, this young master will teach you how to behave.”

Wang Quanhe gritted his teeth and didn’t reply.

“Lei Dong, you’re really getting worse as you live. You can’t even handle a little beggar?” someone mocked.

Lei Dong humphed, and said to that person, “Zhao Li, do you want to spar with me?” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“You can’t even handle a little beggar. Isn’t sparring with you just lowering my status?” That person laughed, and continued to mock Lei Dong.

Lei Dong’s face alternated between red and green. He wished he could kill someone.

However, that person was not weaker than him, and the Lei Clan was not stronger than the other clan, either. In the face of the other party’s ridicule, he would at most retort.

Now, he was indeed the one whose weakness had been grasped, and being stepped on.

This despicable little beggar!

He blamed this on Wang Quanhe. If it weren’t for the fact that this guy didn’t know what was good for him, how could Lei Dong have become a laughing stock?

‘Just you wait, I’ll definitely let this little beggar know what regret means.

His face was dark, and his entire body was emitting a cold aura.

Time passed slowly. People left in disappointment, but the length of the line did not decrease. This was because new people kept joining. If they lined up, there was a chance that they could obtain a huge opportunity. Who would not have this bit of patience?

Finally, it was Lei Dong’s turn.

He entered confidently, but after a long time, he came out dejectedly. When he saw Wang Quanhe, his eyes were filled with killing intent.

Of course, he didn’t pass the test, and blamed this disappointment on Wang Quanhe. He felt that it was because of Wang Quanhe that he didn’t succeed.

“I’ll wait for you outside, little beggar!” he said balefully. Before Wang Quanhe could say anything, he had already strode away.

This was the manor of a Celestial King, so he didn’t dare to be too impudent. He could only shoot his mouth off.

Wang Quanhe watched as the other party left. He gritted his teeth and strode into the hall.

“Sit down.” There were two people inside, both expressionless.

Wang Quanhe sat down as instructed. Each of them quickly took out something that looked like a headband, and put it on his head.

He didn’t know what this was, but he understood that this was the so-called test.

“Th-th-this!” A moment later, he heard an incomparably shocked cry behind him.

“Finally found him!”

The two expressionless people’s expressions actually changed, and they both cried out in surprise.

Wang Quanhe was also stunned. Only then did he realize that he had actually passed the test.

Hiss, didn’t this mean that he could make any request to a Celestial King?

He couldn’t help but feel his blood rush to his head. He was so excited that his mind went blank.

Li Clan, oh Li Clan, you guys never imagined that he would return so quickly to take revenge, right?

‘Li Jingchu, oh Li Jingchu, I want to see what your heart is made of!’

Wang Quanhe’s mind was in a daze. He had no idea how he was invited into the inner courtyard. Along the way, many people seemed to be looking at him with reverence and envy.

However, Prince Ma Xuan didn’t appear immediately. Instead, he only appeared in the courtyard where Wang Quanhe was staying three days later.

“Greetings, Milord!” Wang Quanhe knelt down and bowed.

Celestial Kings were the greatest in the world.

Prince Ma Xuan, on the other hand, was incomparably polite. He personally stepped forward and raised his hands, preventing Wang Quanhe from bowing down.

What a joke. This was the person Ling Han was looking for, so how could he dare to put on airs?

“Young friend, how have you been these past few days?” he asked with a smile.

“Thank you for your concern, Lord Celestial King. I’m living very well.” Wang Quanhe was a little terrified. He was facing a Celestial King, yet the latter was still concerned about his daily life. This made him feel touched, terrified, and filled with confidence. Now, there was really hope for revenge for his clan.

Prince Ma Xuan kept talking, but he was only talking about some unimportant topics. This was because he didn’t know why Ling Han was looking for Wang Quanhe. He only knew that this was very important to Ling Han.

That was a Heavenly Venerate!

Wang Quanhe couldn’t help but feel a little anxious when he saw that the other party was only talking about trifling topics.

‘Didn’t you say that as long as the person met the criteria, you would agree to a request?

‘Why didn’t you mention that?’

However, if the other party did not say anything, he did not dare to take the initiative to mention it. What if he made the other party unhappy?

However, his family feud was like a needle that stabbed into his heart, constantly reminding him. Therefore, after enduring for a long time, he finally mentioned this matter.

Prince Ma Xuan laughed heartily. “Young man, don’t be anxious. A mighty figure is about to arrive. You may make your request to him.”
