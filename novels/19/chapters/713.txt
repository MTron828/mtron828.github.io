Chapter 714: This Is a Beast Garden

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Henyee

Everyone exited the Black Tower and continued to advance.

After two days, they’d finally walked left the sea area. The place ahead was another stretch of flatlands, with occasional large trees and sporadic mountain peaks—it was as if they went back to place on the other side of the sea, for the scenery was almost unchanged.

Could the large sea be the center of this Mystery Realm?

“Have we come around again? Is the precious treasure hidden in the sea?” Everyone began suspect.

Xiu , at this moment, a black shadow swept by in the skies, and with a close look, it turned out it was actually a pavilion. It wasn’t sent flying, but instead grew out two legs and pranced over on the earth, disappearing in an instant.

Sh*t! Ling Han and the others looked at each other, speechless.

A ghost, or had it become spiritual? A pavilion actually grew legs and ran?

“Are my eyes blurred?” Li Feng Yu wiped his eyes.

“You’re probably not the only one having a hard time seeing,” Ling Han said; it wasn’t possible that everyone’s eyes were all blurred. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Xiu, xiu, xiu, at this moment, several more figures swept by the sky at a surprising speed.

“Hm, the Lunar King!” everyone cried out in surprise again. They recognized one of them that rode on a terrifying beast lion, which couldn’t be any more obvious.

Being able to stand side by side with the Lunar King, these people were probably all Shattering Void Tier elites.

“Several great Shattering Void Tier elites are chasing it together? That pavilion must contain surprising treasures,” Yuan Cheng He said.

“Unfortunately, it’s been targeted by Shattering Void Tier elites, so there’s no way we’ll have any share.” Li Feng Yu sighed.

With a smile, Ling Han said, “That may not be the case. Opportunities don’t have much to do with cultivation, and if these Shattering Void Tier elites can obtain the treasures inside the pavilion, then wouldn’t’ they have gotten it long ago?”

“That’s right, we may be able to obtain a share.” Li Feng Yu was excited again.

“But, a pavilion that can grow legs and run, this... is too strange, right?” Zhu Xuan Er said.

Li Feng Yu nodded repeatedly, and said, “Maybe it’ll eat all of us!”

Ling Han said, “Forget it, don’t think about this problem now. Even Shattering Void Tier elites can’t catch up with it, let alone us. If it is to be, then this pavilion will appear in front of us; if it isn’t to be... hehe.”

Well, such a treasure was not something that they could obtain just by thinking about it.

Their thoughts down to earth, the first thing was obviously not to hasten on their journey, but to eat a good meal.

Ling Han took out a section of the tentacle beast’s tentacle and refined it with might to make it shrink, condensing the essence. He then added precious medicine from the Black Tower to boil it together; the most precious was the myrietes precious pearl, which Ling Han scraped to get some powder, which he placed in the pot.

As it boiled, clear red clouds rose up as if they were boiling a divine beast’s meat. The aroma permeated the air, making Hu Niu and the Gold-seeking Rat jump up and down; even the rabbit began to eat secretly along with them.

After half a day, the pot of precious soup was finally finished, and everyone had a bowl ladled out to them. There were propagating vein-like patterns rising in the soup as if heaven and earth was revealing its profound secrets.

This was a perfectly tonic soup!

“Niu wants two bowls! No, three bowls!” Hu Niu hadn’t started eating and was already contending for food.

“Zhi zhi, zhi zhi zhi zhi!” The Gold-seeking Rat jumped on Ling Han’s shoulder and squeaked, meaning “this baby also wants three bowls”.

Ling Han shrugged, and said, “Everyone gets one bowl first, and those who can still drink, ladle out more yourselves.”

Everyone was full of ambition; how could a bowl of such a tonic soup be enough?

But once one bowl was down the stomach, except for Ling Han and Hu Niu, everyone’s bodies were gushing with multicolored light and their faces all red; how could they possibly take on a second bowl?

Since everyone couldn’t eat more, Ling Han and Hu Niu didn’t even use a bowl. They surrounded the pot, scooped up the soup, and ate the meat, making the others call out for their freakishness.

This pot of soup was greatly beneficial to progressing in their cultivation, and which medicine wasn’t a great one?

Eating it directly nourished their dao flower and the spiritual infant, carving down vein-like patterns; the speed of growth was shockingly fast.

“In less than half a year, I can break through to the Spiritual Infant Tier!” Zhu Xuan Er said, pleasantly surprised. She always worried because her cultivation was lower than Ling Han’s, and her battle prowess was very much inferior as well, so she was unable to help Ling Han.

Advancing into the Spiritual Infant Tier, she finally wouldn’t need to watch from the sidelines every time.

The Li Siblings’ and Yuan Cheng He’s gains were also great, making them unable to contain their joy.

After resting, they departed again. This was still a paradise for beasts, with various powerful beasts emerging one after another. Most of them were in the Spiritual Infant and the Deity Transformation Tier, and there were even a dozen Heaven Tier ones. Shattering Void Tier ones weren’t seen for the time being, but that couldn’t be a guarantee that there wasn’t any.

It was surprising. In one Mystery Realm, they actually saw two Shattering Void Tier beasts, though not very powerful, and one already had been subdued by the Lunar King; against other people, Shattering Void Tier beasts would crush them overwhelmingly.

After another two days, they finally walked out of this area. A stone door appeared in front, and looking back after passing through it, two words could be seen on it: Beast Garden.

This... this is some ancient force’s beast garden, a place where beast pets are bred!” Everyone was frightened by such immense handiwork; experts like them had to take ten days just to pass through a beast garden.

This was only to pass through it, and not to stroll through the entire area!

“The level of beasts is restricted by bloodline, and since they can reach the Shattering Void Tier now, then their ancestors should’ve also been in the Shattering Void Tier when they were bred here,” Ling Han said; this was the most frightening aspect.

This force could capture Shattering Void Tier beasts and breed them; why did this sound so much like dreaming?

Only the ancient dynasty that sought to split the skies could be so bold and powerful,Ling Han thought. That ancient dynasty had once united all of the lands, but still fell short in the end, unable to split the skies.

“No wonder Shattering Void elites were in such a rush. This is extremely like to be the location of the imperial city of that ancient dynasty.”

“Mystical treasures!”

Everyone felt as if they were on pins and needles. This was a genuine treasure vault of an ancient dynasty.

They advanced in a hurry, but after the flatlands was a desert with a boundless expanse of yellow sand everywhere. If it weren’t for the fireball that never changed position in the sky, they would be very likely to have lost their way.

Like this, they went on for three more days, and suddenly a palace appeared in front of them.

The residence of the ancient emperor?

After they walked over, they then discovered that it wasn’t so. The plaque on the palace gates had the two words, “Tool Pavilion,” written on it.

As the name implied, tool pavilion was obviously a place where treasured tools were kept.

There were many people around the palace. The treasure was clearly in front of them, but they didn’t go further. There was only one possibility... they were obstructed and couldn’t enter.

Ling Han and the others walked over, and after asking a few people, they found out that there was a metal puppet keeping watch by the tool pavilion’s entrance. To enter the building, one had to pass its test first; forcibly charging through without passing its test, one would only be killed on the spot.

“What test?”
