Chapter 559: Corpse Soldiers Show Off Their Power

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

The two battled fiercely. From the circumstances, it was very hard to tell who was better right away.

On top of the city walls, everyone was excited.

The Thousand Corpse Sect boasted greatly, but in the end, they were nothing more than this. Although Jia Zhang was one of the five dragons, he definitely couldn’t enter top hundred amongst the younger generation in the middle state.

Only Xuanyuan Zi Guang, Yao Hui Yue, and so on could represent the limits of the prodigies of the younger generation.

Nevertheless, the Thousand Corpse Sect was a great ancient sect, yet the disciples they fostered were nothing more than this. It seemed that it had been too long, so their sect had waned. If it weren’t for the Fourth Killing Formation, they definitely wouldn’t stand a single blow.

Ling Han, however, shook his head, and said, “Jia Zhang has lost.”

His voice wasn’t low. It was heard by many people on the side, and they couldn’t help but be furious.

“Hey, which side are you on, why would you hope for Jia Zhang’s defeat?”

“Could he be the Thousand Corpse Sect’s spy?”

“I think he’s suspicious!”

These people all stared at Ling Han, their gazes unfriendly.

Zhu Xuan Er was smart, immediately understanding what Ling Han meant. She said, “He’s the Thousand Corpse Sect’s disciple, and Thousand Corpse Sect’s true battle prowess... lies in Corpse Soldiers!”

Hearing Zhu Xuan Er’s explanation, everyone instantly came to the same realization.

Right. Why was the Thousand Corpse Sect notorious and spurned by the people of the world, and even destroyed several millennia ago? It was precisely because they refined Corpse Soldiers!

Where did Corpse Soldiers come from? They came from the martial artists they killed, and the elite warriors’ corpses stolen from cemeteries.

Without Corpse Soldiers, the Thousand Corpse Sect would be a second-tier sect, but with them, it could be compared to powerful forces like the Heaven’s Sword Sect and the Cloud Phoenix Sect, and even go further beyond.

Now, that youngster rivaled Jia Zhang with his personal battle prowess, so when he unleashed his Corpse Soldiers, what would the outcome of the battle be?

Ling Han said Jia Zhang already lost, and definitely didn’t say it without thinking. He wasn’t on the Thousand Corpse Sect’s side, but simply told the truth based on the facts.

However, Jia Zhang, who was the one involved, didn’t realize at all. He still battled with the youngster fiercely, and as the two were well-matched in strength, he was also fully enjoying himself. Being oppressed in the city for ten days made him extremely out of sorts, and he just happened to need a great battle to vent some anger.

“Seventeenth Junior Brother, why aren’t you done yet!?” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Too slow!”

“That’s right, what month and year will this fight go on until?”

The nine youngsters of the Thousand Corpse Sect all began to shout.

That youngster revealed a fierce and savage smile, and said, “Since the Senior Brothers and Sisters are impatient, this little brother will end this battle as soon as possible!” He let out a battle cry, and as ear-piercing sounds came from afar, four caskets slid over.

The Thousand Corpse Sect’s people fostered corpses, and the stronger they were, the more Corpse Soldiers they could foster. He was in the Flower Blossom Tier, and could at most foster six Corpse Soldiers, but this demanded too much. Four was already his limit. Meanwhile, normal Flower Blossom Tier disciples could only foster two.

One needed to separate a part of the divine sense to control the Corpse Soldiers, and the more divine sense was separated, the more it affected the body. Therefore, unless one had extraordinary talent, it was better to pursue the quality of corpse soldiers, and only then the quantity.

“Go!” that youngster shouted lightly, and four Corpse Soldiers immediately leapt out their caskets. Each one was rotten with only the skeleton left, but their bones were refined into the color of shiny silver, as if it were made out of metal.

Third tier Silver-Armored Corpse, equivalent to the Flower Blossom Tier.

That youngster stared at Jia Zhang, and said, “You’re too weak. You’re not qualified to be a follower of I, Si Tu Yao.”

“Bullsh!t!” Jia Zhang was furious. Although he didn’t want to be his opponent’s follower at all, he couldn’t bear the opponent’s disdain. He let out a battle cry, and a mirror appeared in his hand.

“Heptagold Mirror!” he shouted loudly and moved the mirror. Instantly, a flash of golden light surged out, shining towards Si Tu Yao.

Si Tu Yao faced it indifferently, not even bothering to parry or evade. A Corpse Soldier stepped forward to block the flash of golden light. With a zi , a hole instantly opened up on the Corpse Soldier’s ribs, with gas flowing out.

‘Impressive.’ The Corpse Soldier’s physique couldn’t be compared to same tier rare metals, but it was still quite formidable; however, it was penetrated with one attack, serving to show how terrifying this Spirit Tool was.

Si Tu Yao didn’t care at all. He pointed at Jia Zhang, and said, “Kill him!” Instantly, the four Corpse Soldiers were like fierce wolves and tigers, pouncing towards Jia Zhang.

The Thousand Corpse Sect was dreaded and hated by many large forces in the ancient times, which certainly stood to reason. It was not only because their actions were vile, but also because they were powerful! With regards to just personal battle prowess, Si Tu Yao and Jia Zhang were equal, but once Corpse Soldiers were out, their battle prowess wasn’t on the same level at all anymore.

The four Corpse Soldiers were in the ninth layer of the Flower Blossom Tier, refined hundreds of times—their physique was tough, and they did not fear death nor pain. They were literally human-shaped weapons, and which Flower Blossom Tier cultivator wouldn’t get scared seeing them?

Jia Zhang already unleashed that Heptagold Mirror, and his battle prowess skyrocketed a whole lot, but against the four Corpse Soldiers, he was really backed up, completely unable to cope.

“Weak, truly too weak!” The ten disciples of Thousand Corpse Sect all shook their heads, appearing as if he were beneath contempt.

On the top of the city wall, everyone was silent.

Jia Zhang wasn’t really weak. He was at the second layer of the Flower Blossom Tier, but his personal battle prowess reached seven stars, and after unleashing the Heptagold Mirror, his battle prowess skyrocketed to ten stars. It couldn’t be helped that his opponents were too strong and too many. Four Corpse Soldiers were all at the ninth layer of the Flower Blossom Tier in terms of battle prowess, neither fearing death nor pain, with tough defense... Nothing could be done.

He was very soon in imminent danger, and would definitely be killed within ten moves.

“Enough!” Yin Xue Yang said in a deep voice.

Bai Yuan laughed gently, and said, “Juniors are sparring, and the older generation shouldn’t meddle!”

“This lord said, stop!” Yin Xue Yang roared, and his voice turned into waves that rolled towards the opposing side.

This was a Heaven Tier warrior’s furious roar. If hit by the sound waves, it was guaranteed that those at the Flower Blossom Tier would instantly faint.

“Damned fatso, you’re too pushy!” Bai Yuan attacked, and a deathly mist was waved out, blocking Yin Xue Yang’s sound waves.

“Ah!” Jia Zhang let out a tragic scream. His arms and legs were grabbed separately by four Corpse Soldiers, and with a pull, he was torn into pieces. He had no Iron Sheet Body, and having his limbs grabbed and pulled, he obviously died.

“Seventeenth Junior Brother, why’d you dismember him, wouldn’t it be better to leave a complete body to refine a Corpse Soldier?” someone said with a laugh.

Si Tu Yao laughed, and said, “A small fry at the second layer of the Flower Blossom Tier refined into a Corpse Soldier would have limited strength. Moreover, he can still be refined into a Corpse Soldier even after being dismembered, just that a bit more effort is necessary.”

“Who wants to battle?” He looked at the people on the city wall, wearing an expression of disdain.

How truly arrogant!

However, Jia Zhang’s strength was already quite good, yet he was swiftly defeated at the hands of this person. This guy certainly had the ability to be proud.

At least, those who had the same battle prowess as Jia Zhang were not qualified to take up the challenge, or else, they’d just be giving up their lives.
