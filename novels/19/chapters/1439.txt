Chapter 1440 Marital Harmony

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was forcefully dragged aside by Ling Han, and she said in irritation, “You already gave me some alchemical pills a few days ago. Why are you bringing me more so soon?”

“Because I miss you!” Ling Han said with a smile.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden stared at him, and said, “Are you having dirty thoughts?”

Ling Han chuckled drily, and replied, “Is thinking of you a dirty thought? Sigh, where is the basic trust that should exist between people?”

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden also chuckled, saying, “If your hands weren’t groping me, perhaps I might have believed you.”

Ling Han put on a serious expression, and said, “I’m giving you a body examination to determine whether you’ve become fatter or skinnier.”

“Then have I become fatter or skinnier?” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden asked, giving him a sideways glance.

“Your body feels so nice,” Ling Han whispered into her ear, not giving a direct answer. Each of his hands had already conquered one of her shapely breasts, his warm breath flowing down her smooth and jade-like neck.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was blushing so much that even her neck had a pink tinge to it. This was an intoxicating sight.

“Damn pervert!” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden murmured quietly. Her two breasts had been conquered, and this caused her blood to course through her body in excitement. Moreover, her neck was actually an even more sensitive location, and the warm breath flowing over it caused her slender body to involuntarily shudder.

“Wife, your body is so soft and supple,” Ling Han said smugly. The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s reaction was the best encouragement for him.

“Stop mucking around; I still need to cultivate!” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden said. She was very easily embarrassed.

“Say, Wife, you were thick-skinned enough to act as my widow for 10,000 years. No matter what, I have to make you my true wife today. Only then will I be able to repay your loyal feelings.” Ling Han started to strip her clothes, one layer after another.

“You damn pervert!” The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden hurriedly tried to stop him. However, whenever she tried to guard a part of her body, another part of her body would be stripped naked. In the end, she failed to guard any part of her body.

Ling Han clicked his tongue in wonder, saying, “Wife, your skin is so white and smooth, almost as if it’s carved out of jade. See, my hands can’t stop themselves. They’ve already slid to the bottom.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was incredibly embarrassed, and she couldn’t help but glare at him. Ling Han was actually teasing her!

“Please, don’t!” In her current state, she could only beg Ling Han to stop.

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Wife, when you went to my place back then, you would take whatever you wanted. However, did I ever argue with you? After 10,000 years, it’s time for me to seek the repayment along with some interest!”

“Ling Han! Young Master Han! Brother Han!” The more the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden called him, the more seductive her voice became. In fact, her last exclamation of “Brother Han” almost melted Ling Han’s heart. “Just let me off once, okay? Okay?”

“Call me brother a few more times,” Ling Han said, not retreating from his position.

“Brother Han, good brother,” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden called, her face flushed completely red.

“Heh, this is more like it.”

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden breathed a sigh of relief. Was Ling Han finally going to retreat? However, she was immediately astonished because not only was Ling Han showing no signs of retreat, but he was even taking things a step further, grabbing her in his arms and carrying her into the bedroom.

‘You’re going back on your words!’

She was almost about to cry. She hurriedly wrapped her arms around Ling Han’s neck, not allowing him to put her down. She then bit his shoulder, and said, “Ling Han, why are you going back on your words?”

“Hehe, when did I say I would retreat if you called me brother?” Ling Han asked with a mischievous grin.

“Damn pervert! I’ll fight to the death with you!” The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden twisted her slender body as she started to aggressively resist.

Peng, peng, peng!

The two of them became entangled as they scuffled.

“Owww!!!” Ling Han suddenly cried out in agony, saying, “Wife, where are you kicking? That’s Little Han! If you break Little Han, the one who suffers will be you!”

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was both embarrassed and worried. She had accidentally kicked Ling Han between his legs. “It’s not hurt, is it?”

“How can it not be hurt? There’s a burning sensation all over it. Gasp! I think my balls are about to shatter!”

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was so worried that the color drained from her face. She had only been embarrassed, and it wasn’t as if she didn’t want to make love with Ling Han. “What should we do? What should we do?”

“Can you check it for me and also console Little Han?”

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden faltered for a moment before realizing that she had fallen victim to Ling Han’s evil ploy. Just how astonishing was his physique? How could he have been injured by her? She aggressively hammered his chest, exclaiming, “Damn pervert, you’re playing tricks on me again!”

However, Ling Han ignored her words, instead passionately sealing her lips with a kiss. This caused the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden to gradually calm down. She then reached over and wrapped her arms around his neck, their tangling bodies causing her to finally lose her defenses. Ling Han finally entered her, causing her to let out a soft and intoxicating moan.

This was a passionate and steamy affair.

After a long while, the bedroom finally fell quiet.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was resting in Ling Han’s lap, her beautiful cheeks still flushed an intoxicating red. She punched Ling Han’s chest, saying, “You bullied me!”

“After being bullied by you for so many years, can’t you allow me to bully you once or twice?” Ling Han laughed heartily, and continued, “I’m a man, so I won’t argue with you. Just let me spank your bottom 10 times a day.”

“In your dreams!” The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden jumped up in fright.

However, how could she escape from Ling Han’s grasp? Ling Han reached over and immediately pulled her back.

Pa, pa, pa!

He aggressively spanked her bottom.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s shapely bottom undulated with his strikes, and this was an indescribably beautiful scene.

‘Tsk, tsk, tsk, not bad. I have to make this a daily habit of mine.’

***

In the blink of an eye, 10 years had already passed.

There was great marital harmony between Ling Han and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, his yang supplementing her yin, and her yin supplementing his yang. Moreover, with the help of an exorbitant amount of alchemical pills, both of them saw improvements in their cultivation level. One of them advanced to the high extreme, while the other advanced to the medium extreme.

Meanwhile, Ding Ping and Jiuyao also advanced rapidly, both of them successfully breaking through to the Heavenly Body Tier. Following this, there was no more significant weakness in their group.

At the same time, Gu Daoyi’s name was also becoming more and more renowned. In fact, there was even a faint suggestion that he was was the number one king tier of the younger generation. Although he hadn’t advanced to the Eternal River Tier yet, it was rumored that he was already invincible among the Heavenly Body Tier.

Several more months passed, and the North Emperor and the Stone Emperor finally arrived together. They then both came over to visit Ling Han. Ling Han was relatively famous, after all, so it was extremely easy to find him.

“Brother Ling!” These two clearly weren’t from the same galaxy, yet they always seemed to be together. It was hard not to suspect that there was some unspeakable secret between them.

“Brother Stone, Brother North!” Ling Han exclaimed as he walked over to greet them.

“Huh, Brother Ling sure is extraordinary. Only less than 100 years have passed, yet you’ve already advanced to the high extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier. This is truly incredible!” the Stone Emperor exclaimed. He had already held Ling Han in high enough regard, yet he was still given a start by Ling Han’s astonishing growth.

However, Ling Han shook his head, saying, “I’m still no match for you two.” He couldn’t see through the Stone Emperor and North Emperor’s auras, and this signified that they were most likely at the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier, perhaps even the pinnacle level.

“Oh, Ling Han, are you trying to be humble, or are you trying to show off?” the North Emperor remarked with a shake of his head. “Anyhow, several powerful king tiers have popped up recently. We truly can’t underestimate the talents of this world.”

The Stone Emperor nodded in agreement, saying, “Perhaps the universe is entering a golden age of cultivation. Those who advance to the position of Saint in this age might create history and even shatter the unreachable barriers, maybe even becoming Saint Kings!”
