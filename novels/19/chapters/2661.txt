2662 Stepped on his face!

Heavenborn was astounded. His physique was comparable to Divine Metal, but the methods that Ling Han showed actually caused his heart to beat wildly. What was going on here?

With a step, Ling Han charged towards Heavenborn.

Heavenborn felt wary, yet did not dare take it head-on. He hurriedly used his movement technique to dodge.

One pursued, while the other fled. In the time needed for a good few breaths, the two of them actually did not exchange even a single blow.

This caused the spectators below them to be surprised. ‘Heavenborn, don’t you claim that your physique is unbeatable? You are not afraid of anyone below Heavenly Venerable Tier. Yet, why are you now so afraid that you dare not face a strike head-on?’

Their cultivation levels were slightly too low, and they couldn’t see very clearly, but A’mu and the other big shots looked stunned.

“This is… Heavenly Venerate Technique!”

“No wonder even I felt wariness that comes from not wanting to face it.”

“However, even if a Celestial King can use a Heavenly Venerate Technique, would it still surpass the limits of the Celestial King Tier? As long as it has not reached the Heavenly Venerable Tier, what would Heavenborn be afraid of?”

“Could it be that this attack has actually broken through the limits of the Celestial King Tier?”

This was something that all three great big shots could not confirm. After all, they were all watching the battle.

Heavenborn was battered and exhausted. Ling Han’s power burst was actually superior to his, attacking hotly behind him. Heavenborn felt his face flush hotly. At the same time, a suspicion rose up in him as well. Could Ling Han’s battle prowess really break through to the level of the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier?

No matter how he thought about it, it was impossible. Ling Han was just a Seventh Heaven Celestial King.

Beneath them, Heavenborn’s subordinates were all rendered speechless; the invincible king in their eyes was actually fleeing!

It should be known that even when it was a challenge against a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, Heavenborn stood firmly, without showing any weakness. With this comparison, the gap was really too apparent.

Heavenborn saw the change in everyone’s expression. He gritted his teeth, and decided that things could not continue like this, or how could he bring himself to face others in the future?

Moreover, he did not believe that Ling Han’s battle prowess really could be as strong as that.

“Come!” Heavenborn shouted loudly, his hands transforming into massive hammers, which barrelled towards Ling Han.

Clang!

Without dodging or evasion, he naturally was immediately embroiled in an exchange of blows with Ling Han.

Frightening power bubbled, forming a massive explosion in the skies.

“Haha, I have really overestimated you. I have thought…” Heavenborn laughed loudly. In this exchange, he realized that he had been worried for nothing. Ling Han’s power was only so-so, completely not as strong as his.

And to think he had felt so wary. He had actually been intimidated by Ling Han.

But in the next instant, Heavenborn’s expression changed drastically.

A frightening power of lightning surged into his body, and was presently wreaking havoc and exploding. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Heavenborn could be considered Divine Metal Physique, and even a peak-stage Celestial Physique’s power could not wound him, but this was lightning. While his body would not be damaged, the former would not disperse without a long period of time. Every time it flowed through his body, his limbs were numbed, and he felt terrible.

Correct. Divine Metal did not fear lightning, but lightning would not be expending the slightest bit of power during its conduction by Divine Metal. Every time it flowed through his body caused Heavenborn enough suffering.

Heavenborn was both stunned and curious. There was absolutely no way that ordinary lightning could influence him, and Ling Han’s power had clearly not reached the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, yet why would it cause him such suffering?

Could it be that Ling Han was capable of drawing on the fundamental power of the Genesis World?

But if that was the case, that meant that Ling Han should already have become a Heavenly Venerate. In that case, killing Heavenborn would be practically as simple as slaughtering a chicken, so how could Ling Han possibly be fighting with so much hardship? Moreover, there were seven ribbons of iridescent light wrapped around him. This was a genuine, authentic Seventh Heaven Celestial King.

But what Heavenborn didn’t know was that while Ling Han could not draw on Void Particle Energy, he was being tempered by this kind of energy, which allowed him to possess such terrifying Body Art. When using this kind of power to employ the Five Elements Lightning Technique, the latter would naturally possess a sliver of power of the Heavenly Venerable Tier as well.

Even if it was just a tiny bit, it was enough to cause great suffering to Heavenborn. After all, he was only at the Seventh Heaven as well.

Heavenborn’s whole body was flashing and sparking with lightning. Because of his Divine Metal Physique, he was practically invincible in the Celestial King Tier, yet now it was also because of his Divine Metal Physique that he was suffering. The power of lightning continued to surge without dispersing.

Of course, if it had not been Heavenborn, any other person would have long since been killed by this strike.

“Having fun?” Ling Han asked calmly. With his present strength, he could only use the Five Elements Lightning Technique nine times, but this was also enough.

Again!

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Ling Han sent out a series of palm strikes, every strike of the Five Elements Lightning Technique landing on Heavenborn. With Heavenborn’s present state, there was absolutely no way he could dodge. His whole body was shuddering from being blasted, and he had lost all battle prowess.

Heavenborn collapsed onto the ground, completely losing consciousness, but his body was still twitching.

In this battle, Heavenborn was completely defeated.

But even so, Ling Han still could not truly wound Heavenborn. At present, the latter was like a Celestial Tool that had been suppressed, but was nonetheless indestructible.

However, this result surpassed everyone’s expectations. This was Heavenborn, the man that claimed to be undefeatable. Before, while Heavenborn still lost in an exchange with a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, even the Ninth Heaven Celestial King still could not do anything to him.

This present scene was really too shocking.

In the skies, A’mu and the others were also very surprised.

“There is another person now on the path to the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier,” Du Shiyi stated.

“This is not strange. What is strange is the fact that he is only at the Seventh Heaven!” Can Yue’s eyes narrowed slightly, revealing a powerful fighting spirit.

“I hope he will mature quickly!” A’mu declared smilingly.

Everyone looked up at Ling Han. This guy’s destructive power was really too shocking, and even Heavenborn, who claimed to have a Divine Metal Physique, had been defeated. In the future, Ling Han’s accomplishments would definitely be astonishing.

There were descendants or heirs of great forces here, and their eyes were all flashing. This person was definitely worthy of being enticed to join their side.

Ling Han raised his foot and lowered it, stepping onto Heavenborn’s face.

He did not use any power, because Heavenborn’s body was akin to Divine Metal, and there was absolutely no way he could be injured. Ling Han couldn’t be bothered to waste effort, either. However, with the stomping down of his foot, a footprint was added to Heavenborn’s face.

Everyone saw this, and they all gaped widely.

This naturally did not cause the slightest damage to Heavenborn’s physical body, but the significance of humiliating him could not be any more apparent. In the future, it was destined that if Heavenborn was not able to defeat Ling Han, he would never be able to raise his head high in front of Ling Han again.

Hiss, Ling Han was meaning to form a grudge with Heavenborn that would only end with one of them dead.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and turned to leave.

Yi, Yan Xianlu, and the company were all very excited. Ling Han was their icon. He had defeated Heavenborn, who was acclaimed as undefeatable, which naturally made them feel as if they were pumped full of adrenaline.

This battle caused a great commotion in the martial academy.

It was said that when Heavenborn returned to consciousness, he spat out three mouthfuls of blood in fury, his expression frighteningly ugly. One of his subordinates wanted to comfort him, and Heavenborn almost killed him with a single strike.

The influence of this battle on Heavenborn was too severe, causing him to fall off his high pedestal. On the contrary, Ling Han had replaced him, and become the brightest existence in this term of new disciples. A great many forces wanted to establish amicable relations with Ling Han. He was a future Heavenly Venerate.

Though there were many Heavenly Venerates in the Flaming Frost Realm at present, that still could not change the outstanding and invincible status of the Heavenly Venerable Tier. A Heavenly Venerate was worthy of being enticed by any force.

Hence, after this battle, Ling Han endlessly received invitations from various forces, who were inviting him to attend this banquet, or participate in that meeting, but Ling Han did not pay them any regard at all.

He was tidying up the resources that he had previously obtained, and chose some items from among them that were useful for his cultivation of Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. Then, he began a period of seclusion.

These resources were considerably bountiful, and were equivalent to 10 times the amount of treasures bestowed by the martial academy over 100,000,000 years. Ling Han made a rough calculation, and they were more or less enough to help him cultivate to the eighth level of the Indestructible Celestial King Physique.
