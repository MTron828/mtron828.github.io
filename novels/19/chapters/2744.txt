2745 Special Training

“Heh, what right do you have to issue a challenge?” Yang Zhihe said calmly. There was displeasure in his voice, and there was also a sense of anger.

However, this was the An Clan’s territory—even though it had already been destroyed. However, even An Tayun hadn’t lashed out, so they naturally couldn’t use force, either.

As much as they were esteemed guests, it would still be disrespectful for them to usurp the host’s position. In any case, An Tayun was also a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate.

Ling Han pointed at Yang Zhihe, and said, “If you don’t dare to battle, then piss off to the side. Don’t spew any more nonsense. That, um, Little An, we won’t take advantage of them, either, even though your daughter is already infatuated with my grandson. Come, don’t cultivators speak with their fists? We’ll hold a battle at the same cultivation level and determine the victor that way. What do you say?”

“Little An” grimaced upon hearing this. Someone actually dared to call him “Little An”?!

‘Little your mom!’

Yang Zhihe suddenly changed his mind, and said, “I also agree to this proposal.” He could tell that An Tayun was apprehensive of Ling Han, meaning that this person was most likely a powerful opponent.

However, he was extremely confident in his son. Of the seven dragons of the Yang Clan, his youngest son was the most powerful.

He wouldn’t mind if his son pummeled Ling Feifan to death. Meanwhile, if Ling Han dared to interfere, he would join forces with An Tayun to stop him. What troubles couldn’t they overcome?

At that time, the Yang Clan and the An Clan would be tightly bound together, sharing both joys and sorrows.

An Tayun pondered for a moment before also nodding slowly. He was also curious about Ling Feifan’s potential. After all, his daughter had already uttered such words, so perhaps it was worth some consideration. Moreover, his background was also fairly powerful and decent.

Of course, this was apart from the toxic tongue that seemed to run in the family.

“Alright, a battle at the same cultivation!” An Tayun said.

“Hold on!” Ling Han raised a hand, and said, “Let’s rest for a few days first. My grandson’s cultivation was sealed by you people, so even if it’s unsealed now, it’ll still be impossible for him to recover to his peak state any time soon.”

“Approved!” Yang Zhihe said with indifference. Before absolute strength, what would it matter even if Ling Feifan trained in earnest for a few days?

Ling Han left with Ling Feifan. However, they immediately entered the Celestial Guest Residence after traveling a small distance. He naturally had to show his grandson to his wives and lovers, especially Helian Xunxue.

After Ling Han left with his grandson, Yang Zhihe looked toward An Tayun.

“Brother An, who was that?”

An Tayun pondered for a moment before replying, “He might be a Heavenly Venerate from the Promise City Realm.”

“Hmm?” Yang Zhihe frowned upon hearing this. It wasn’t as if he hadn’t battled against the elites of the Promise City Realm before. However, he had certainly never come across this Ling Han. But since An Tayun had said so, it would be disrespectful of Yang Zhihe to say anything else.

***

Inside the Celestial Guest Residence, Ling Feifan obediently paid his respects to Ling Han’s lovers. Of course, he was also very willing to do so. This was because the women all gave him presents, all of them Celestial King Tier treasures.

Helian Xunxue more so wrapped him in an embrace, with tears flowing down her cheeks. It had already been an entire epoch since she had last seen her son, so now that she was seeing her grandson all grown up, how could she not get emotional?

With his smooth talking skills, Ling Feifan was quickly able to bring a smile to Helian Xunxue’s face.

After a while, Ling Han dragged him to the side, and said, “Grandson, I’ll give you three days of special training.”

“Gramps, I can deal with him myself!” Ling Feifan said indifferently. “Don’t forget, I’m your grandson! I’m not afraid of anyone at the same cultivation level!”

Pa!

Ling Han immediately smacked him across the head. “Being confident is a good thing, but what you have is blind confidence! Did you really think that I dragged you over to rest for three days?”

Only at this moment did Ling Feifan wear a serious expression as he asked, “That small dragon is very powerful?”

Ling Han smiled, saying, “Which person who can reach the Ninth Heaven through their own abilities isn’t an extraordinary person? Moreover, his father is a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, so it’s extremely likely that he possesses some Heavenly Venerate Techniques. Once he unleashes them, how are you going to block him?”

Even if a Ninth Heaven Celestial King had their cultivation sealed, they would still be able to unleash Heavenly Venerate Techniques. It was just that its might would be greatly reduced. At the same cultivation, however, how could Celestial King Tier Techniques possibly rival Heavenly Venerate Techniques?

Ling Feifan was deeply astonished. “Grandpa, hurry up and teach me Heavenly Venerate Techniques!”

Ling Han involuntarily rolled his eyes. They only had three days, so even if he accelerated time, would his grandson really be able to master a Heavenly Venerate Technique?

“Impossible,” he said in a resolute voice.

“Then what can we do?” Ling Feifan said with a gasp. “Grandpa, if I can’t get a wife, then you won’t have a granddaughter-in-law! In the future, you won’t get a great-grandson!”

Pa!

Ling Han smacked him across the head again. He actually dared to use this to threaten him?

“That’s why I’m giving you special training!”

“Oh,” Ling Feifan replied with a nod.

Even if Ling Han accelerated the flow of time 1000-fold, that would still only be less than 10 years. What could his grandson learn in that time?

Thus, Ling Han didn’t plan to teach him Heavenly Venerate Techniques. Instead, he placed his right hand on Ling Feifan’s head.

“Grandpa, are you planning to pass down your 100,000,000 years’ worth of cultivation?” Ling Feifan said in giddy excitement. Ling Han was a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate! Thus, he might be able to transform him into the most powerful Ninth Heaven Celestial King in a single go!

“In your dreams.” Ling Han wanted to smack him across the head again. “Only by cultivating yourself can you obtain the best and most stable results. Only then can you continue to march forward. This time, I’ll leave a wisp of power in your body. If your opponent unleashes a Heavenly Venerate Technique, activate this power and use it to rival him. Otherwise, battle with your own strength.”

“Okay,” Ling Feifan said with a nod.

After traveling for one epoch, Ling Han had traversed through heaven knew how many dimensions. Even if he weren’t specifically looking for them, he still managed to obtain many Celestial medicines and Divine Metals. However, trying to rapidly raise Ling Feifan’s strength would still be an impossible task.

Thus, he planned to activate the power of his core to leave a wisp of power in Ling Feifan’s body. That way, he could use it to deal with his opponent’s Heavenly Venerate Technique.

If it were any other person—even if it were the Empress, Liu Yutong, or one of the other women—Ling Han would be unable to do this. However, Ling Feifan shared his blood, and he was an extension of his life. Thus, this possibility could be achieved.

Ling Han carefully activated his core. If it reached a critical stage of circulation, even Ling Han would be ruthlessly blown apart.

A single sliver at a time, Ling Han carefully manipulated this power. This power couldn’t exit his body, yet thanks to their blood relation, wisps of power could still flow into Ling Feifan and temper his body.

Ling Han was astonished by how smoothly things went. He had initially thought that he could only leave a wisp of this power in Ling Feifan’s body. Unexpectedly, however, he could even use it to temper his body! Ling Feifan had only just advanced to the Celestial King Tier, so if he tempered his grandson’s body for close to 10 years, the results would most likely be astonishing.

“Aaah…!!!” However, Ling Feifan screamed in agony. He had never practiced Body Arts before, so his physique wasn’t especially powerful. With this power wantonly coursing through his body, he naturally couldn’t help but scream.

His skin started to crack, with blood spraying into the air. He appeared as miserable as could be.

However, Ling Han acted as if he couldn’t see this. If Ling Feifan failed to endure even this, then there would be no need for him to screw over the young girl from the An Clan. He would be better off training for another few hundred million years.

With the acceleration of time, it wasn’t long before nine years flowed by.

Ling Han finally retracted his hands. Meanwhile, Ling Feifan scrambled up and fled as quickly as he could. It was as if Ling Han were a terrifying beast.

He swore that he would never do this again.

“Test your strength,” Ling Han said.

Ling Feifan swung his arm before involuntarily exclaiming, “The speed of my fist has increased several hundred-fold!”

This was simply unfathomable. Just based on this fact alone, his strength could already increase several dozen-fold or even several hundred-fold!
