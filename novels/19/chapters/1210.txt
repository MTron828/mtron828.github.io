Chapter 1211: I’ve Returned

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han circulated another drop of Indestructible True Fluid, and his wounds instantly started to mend.

However, circulating two drops of Indestructible True Fluid in quick succession caused its effects to decrease dramatically. The second drop of Indestructible True Fluid was only able to stabilize and mend his wounds, not completely heal them.

Even so, his recovery ability was still absolutely stunning.

Even Venerable Trinity’s interest was piqued, and he remarked, “This youth is fairly outstanding.”

How high were Venerable Trinity’s standards? Being praised as outstanding by him was truly remarkable.

A feeling of jealousy welled up in Yang Hao’s heart. He was afraid that Venerable Trinity would take a liking to Ling Han’s talent and take him as a disciple. If that were to happen, he wouldn’t be able to exact his revenge anymore. Moreover, he would have another powerful competitor.

The thought of this made him especially uneasy.

Sure enough, Venerable Trinity said, “Young man, are you willing to acknowledge me as master?”

If he had asked this upon his arrival, perhaps Ling Han would have agreed. Even if his intentions weren’t genuine, he could at least take advantage of his new identity to overcome this dire situation. However, Venerable Trinity had suppressed Empress Luan Xing and allowed Yang Hao to strike her. Ling Han couldn’t accept this.

Venerable Trinity was targeting his future wife, yet he still wanted him to acknowledge him as master? And Yang Hao... would become his senior brother?

No way!

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Those who are teachers should be virtuous! Venerable Trinity, do you think you possess the virtue of a teacher?”

The surroundings instantly fell silent.

‘Is there something wrong with my ears? Why do I feel like I heard that brat criticizing Venerable Trinity?’

Gasp!

‘How daring! Someone in this galaxy actually dares to question Venerable Trinity’s virtue before his face! Is this a joke?’

“Impudence!” Hua Yongning and Gao Fang berated. They hadn’t planned on unleashing their might at a measly Mountain River Tier cultivator, yet who told Ling Han to insult their master? They had no choice but to act.

Meanwhile, Yang Hao breathed a sigh of relief. Having insulted Venerable Trinity, there was no way that Ling Han could be taken as his disciple anymore, regardless of how talented he was. He couldn’t help but chuckle at Ling Han’s stupidity in his mind. True men should know when to yield and when to stand firm. Standing firm when one didn’t possess enough power was merely seeking death.

He was afraid that Venerable Trinity would let him off the hook due to his appreciation of prodigies. Thus, he immediately charged toward Ling Han, shouting, “How dare you insult my master! You’re asking for death!”

Divine patterns intertwined as his palm struck at Ling Han. He had put all of his power behind this strike.

He was going to kill Ling Han and eliminate all future trouble!

Weng!

Shadows of giant snakes materialized behind Empress Luan Xing, each of them measuring tens of thousands of meters in length. They all exuded an ancient and desolate aura. Venerable Trinity’s suppression instantly vanished, and she immediately pressed her palm toward Yang Hao.

“Damn it!” Hua Yongning and Gao Fang hurriedly dashed over to block Empress Luan Xing’s attack. If Yang Hao were killed before them, they would definitely be punished severely! They wouldn’t be killed, but they would certainly fall out of favor with Venerable Trinity. If that were to happen, it would be impossible for them to obtain his core inheritance.

They couldn’t accept such a fate.

The two Heavenly Body Tier elites lunged over to block Empress Luan Xing’s attack. Although they had reacted too late, their closer distance to Yang Hao meant that they were still able to block her attack.

Boom!

The strikes of the three elites collided together.

Peng, peng, peng, peng!

Shock waves surged into the surroundings, instantly smashing the palace into smithereens.

Peng!

Yang Hao was close to the collision, and he was instantly sent flying after being scraped the devastating shock waves.

Pa, pa, pa!

Several of his bones snapped. Fortunately, he had only been hit by a weak shock wave. Otherwise, he definitely would have died.

Hua Yongning and Gao Fang were both astounded. They were all at the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier, so why was their power so much weaker? They had teamed up against Empress Luan Xing, yet they had still almost lost.

They were certain that she hadn’t reached the pinnacle level of the Heavenly Body Tier yet. So, how was she so powerful? One had to realize that this was only a “spiritual mark” that she had left. That being the case, just how powerful was her real self?

“Huh? Young Lady, you’re a member of the Nine Snake Tribe!”

Xiu!

A figure descended from the sky. He was shrouded in divine light, and it was impossible to see his height or features. However, the aura that radiated from him was absolutely terrifying.

He was none other than Venerable Trinity!

This Eternal River Tier elite had actually appeared before them! He had only been interfering casually before, yet had been already able to suppress Empress Luan Xing. Although she had escaped his fetters in the end, it wouldn’t be hard for him to suppress her again.

However, there was only a single reason why he had revealed himself—Empress Luan Xing’s identity as a member of the Nine Snake Tribe was far too astonishing!

“Who would’ve thought? I was actually able to meet a member of the ancient divine tribes!” Venerable Trinity said in excitement. He stared at Empress Luan Xing as if there were flowers blossoming from her face.

Empress Luan Xing shuddered in apprehension. Although she had unleashed the power of the Nine Snakes to break free from Venerable Trinity’s grasp, she knew that he had only been suppressing her casually from someplace very far away. He hadn’t been using his full power. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

There was an insurmountable gulf between the Heavenly Body Tier and Eternal River Tier, and this was a gulf that even her Nine Snakes bloodline couldn’t overcome. Moreover, she hadn’t reached the pinnacle level of Heavenly Body Tier yet, and this was more so only a clone of hers.

She was no match for Venerable Trinity!

“So what?” she asked calmly. Meanwhile, she continued to shuffle closer to Ling Han. If Venerable Trinity targeted her again, she would be able to enter the Black Tower with Ling Han.

“Ancient divine tribe... Haha, hahahaha!” Venerable Trinity laughed loudly, and it was clear that he was beside himself with delight. In fact, even the divine light that shrouded his body gradually dimmed and vanished, revealing a skinny and bony elder.

He—the most powerful elite of the galaxy—was lost in emotion. This revealed just how excited he was at this moment.

However, the more excited Venerable Trinity was, the more anxious Ling Han and Empress Luan Xing became. This signified that Venerable Trinity cared very, very much about this.

“M-Master!” Yang Hao stuttered as he regained consciousness and struggled to his feet. Although several of his bones had been broken, he could still hold them together with his Origin Power. Walking properly wasn’t much of an issue. In fact, he could still battle, though his battle prowess would definitely be affected.

Venerable Trinity ignored him, and he continued to stare at Empress Luan Xing, saying, “Young lady, your bloodline is mine!”

Sure enough, this old geezer was interested in Empress Luan Xing’s bloodline. Although they were unsure of how he was going to obtain it, they knew that this was definitely bad news for Empress Luan Xing.

“Let’s leave!” Ling Han lunged over, and was just about to place Empress Luan Xing into his Black Tower.

“Young man, stay out of this!”

Venerable Trinity didn’t need to move, and he was able to restrict Ling Han with just a thought. He raised a hand and grabbed at Empress Luan Xing.

Yang Hao’s anger surged, and since Empress Luan Xing was being dealt with by Venerable Trinity, he decided to take his fury out on Ling Han.

‘Go die!’

He threw a fist at Ling Han’s head as he lunged toward him.

“Ling Han!” A voice suddenly traveled over, though it sounded like it had come from the ends of the sky.

“Ling! Han!” This time, the voice sounded like it was right next to them.

Peng!

A figure crashed down from the sky. No one saw how she had appeared. However, she coincidentally landed on top of Yang Hao, who was trampled into the ground, forming a human-shaped crater.

“Ling Han, Niu’s returned!” the person shouted in joy.
