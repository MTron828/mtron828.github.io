Chapter 1741: What should be done without an invitation?

“We’ll just go in like that,” Ling Han said with a grin.

With one arm around each woman, Ling Han squeezed through the crowd, and strode forwards. Underneath their intimidating bearing, those standing in front of them could only step aside to give way.

After all, those that were surrounding the stone doors were only Genesis Tiers; hadn’t Severing Mundane Tiers all entered in earlier? Of course, even if they were Severing Mundane Tiers, there were not many people that could withstand Ling Han’s aura by now.

“Invitation card.” The man standing guard at the doors was a middle-aged man, and his cultivation level as a Severing Mundane Tier was enough to suppress all minor characters that wanted to create trouble.

As expected of the Fu Clan. They were really rich and imposing; even a mere guard was so lavish as they had directly assigned a Severing Mundane Ancestor as a mere guard!

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “We have just come out of the Severing Mundane Pool, and have not received any invitation card.”

The middle-aged man cast a look over Ling Han, his eyes filled with doubt.

Just come out?

The Severing Mundane Pool had already closed, and you just so happened to come out right before it closed? He did not believe it.

He thought that Ling Han should have long since broken through to the Severing Mundane Tier, and had come here to trick them. Because Fu Clan only wanted prodigies, it was natural that they would only welcome those king tiers that had advanced to the Severing Mundane Tier in the Severing Mundane Pool. Otherwise, if they were merely ordinary Severing Mundane Tiers, then what was the point of recruiting them? To waste their resources?

...Not all those who entered today might be able to board the Fu Clan’s ship. Only those prodigies that could possibly achieve a flawless severance were going to be targets for the Fu Clan.

“Hoho, without an invitation card, you had best turn back,” the middle-aged man said with a smile, but did not turn Ling Han away with harsh words.

This was the bearing of a noble clan. Otherwise, the servants that came from smaller clans would instead be even more arrogant.

Ling Han was not angered, either, and smilingly said, “Please help us inform Miss Fu Xiaoyun.”

He even had designs on the exquisite fairy of our Fu Clan?

The middle-aged man showed a hint of displeasure. Fu Xiaoyun was too outstanding. Advancing into the Severing Mundane Tier was only the beginning. In future, her achievement would definitely be at the level of the Immortal Palace Tier, and the only question was whether she could become a big shot among Immortal Palace Tiers.

Was she anyone you could have ideas about?

What a shameless toad[1].

“Sir, if you continue to be a pest, then don’t blame me for being rude,” the middle-aged man retorted coldly.

“Have you heard that? Scram!” A proud voice rang out from behind them.

Everyone turned and looked over. That was a young man, and his expression was completely one of insufferable arrogance.

His name was Ning Hao, and he was a rookie that had just advanced into the Severing Mundane Tier this time.

At first, he could only be an ordinary Severing Mundane Tier, but because of the effect of destiny, he had hit a bit of ******* luck. The strike he delivered was very thorough, and he had achieved a flawless severance. This naturally led to him becoming extremely arrogant.

What Changsun Liang and Xiao Sheng? Weren’t they all the same as he? They had all achieved a flawless severance.

Thus, his self-confidence immediately shot sky-high, feeling that he was the strongest prodigy in the present generation. He could tell that both Ling Han and the Empress were Severing Mundane Tiers, but so what? They must have achieved Severing Mundane Tier in some unknown corner, so how could they compare to him, who had achieved a flawless severance?

There was also a woman beside him. She was very beautiful, but was also similarly arrogant. Her slender arm was wrapped around Ning Hao’s arm, her chin raised so high that her nostrils were almost facing upwards.

Ling Han turned his head, frowned, and said, “Do you know how to speak properly? If you don’t, then just shut your damn mouth!”

This...!

When everyone heard this, they all thought that Ling Han was very aggressive.

Though Ning Hao was very arrogant, Ling Han was not going to appear polite, either, immediately throwing an insult his way. But it was true; how could anyone being told to scram for no reason feel satisfied?

“You are courting death!” Ning Hao’s eyes turned cold, but when his eyes swept over the Empress and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, he couldn’t help but show a cold smirk, and said, “These two beauties, do you want to attend the Fu Clan’s banquet? That would be simple; as long as you two dump that guy, I will take the two of you in.”

“Brother Hao, then what about me?” The woman beside him immediately leaped up. According to the rules, every guest could only bring a single companion.

Ning Hao sneered, and withdrew his arm from her grasp. He coldly retorted, “You can scram now!”

This kind of woman was only good enough for playing around; could it be that she expected to become a phoenix by taking advantage of her connection with him[2]?

The woman only looked despondent for a while before immediately shrieking, “Ning Hao, how dare you! You are really heartless after you have had your way with me! You will definitely get your just desserts!”

Ning Hao’s expression darkened, and showed killing intent. This woman actually dared to announce the matters between them in public, and actually dared to speak of it in such a crude manner.

“Get lost!” The Empress was furious. Shua, she delivered a palm strike in Ning Hao’s direction.

Boom, the palm that was akin to white jade swept out, her Origin Power taking the form of a fine small hand that slapped out towards Ning Hao’s face.

Ling Han couldn’t help but nod. The Empress’s control over her power had already reached a very fine level.

Though elites would form a giant hand at the slightest inclination, this was because their power was too strong, and after their Origin Power took form, it naturally would be even bigger and very simple. But to control the size of the hand that had been formed from her Origin Power to a very small size would require her grasp and control over her own power to reach a very high level.

After advancing into the Severing Mundane Tier, the Empress had finally succeeded.

A light tap was actually a harsh blow!

Ning Hao scoffed. ‘I only gave you a chance because you have quite a good figure, yet you have forgotten yourself in your arrogance?’

He, too, sent out a palm strike, which turned into the size of at least a house, greeting the Empress’s incoming blow.

Just look, this was what true power was—the mighty power that only a flawless severance could possess.

Boom, this palm strike of his caused a clap of thunder. A Severing Mundane Ancestor was naturally strong, their Regulations glowing, and possessing a supreme aura that mortals could only worship

The Empress threw out a palm strike. Her tiny, jade-like palm sank into the giant hand, just like a grain of rice thrown into the water, completely negligible and without the slightest effect. Yet that was only for an instant. The large hand outside suddenly crumbled, and the Regulations also dispersed completely at the first moment.

That fine small hand appeared once more, pressing down on Ning Hao, completely unaffected.

Instantly, Ning Hao’s face turned pale.

Their palms clashed, but the strength of his palm strike completely crumbled, yet the power of his opponent seemed to be completely unaffected. What justice was in that?

Just how wide did the gap of power have to be between them to lead to such a situation?

Peng!

He had not finished the thought when he was already sent flying by a palm strike, passing out directly.

“Ptui!” The woman from before walked over and spat at him. Only then did she strode off.

Ling Han didn’t even bother to look. The Empress was capable of being a king tier even in the second severance, so what was there to be shocked about her managing to toss over such trash? He directed a smile at the middle-aged man, and said, “Just help me out here!”

The middle-aged man was already dumbfounded. He was also a first severance, and naturally knew that Ning Hao was not artificially strong, and his strength was considerably powerful. But even so, he had still been directly struck like an idiot by a single palm strike.

He hurriedly changed his attitude, and said, “Three guests, this way please!”

They should not have been lying, and had indeed come out of the Severing Mundane Pool. Otherwise, if they hadn’t advanced into Severing Mundane Tier there, how could their strength possibly be this strong?

Ling Han nodded at him, and the three of them walked through the stone doors together. Suddenly, the scene in front of their eyes immediately changed. They had entered into a colossal space, which contained mountains and water bodies, just like a small world.

Merely with a few looks, Ling Han was sure that this definitely was a Spatial God Tool that had been directly refined based on a small world.

So rich!

“Three guests, this way please.” Someone was waiting for them respectfully inside, and seeing Ling Han and his group appear, immediately extended his hand to show them the way in.

Ling Han and his group followed behind him. Very soon, another person took that man’s place, continuing to receive the guests that entered.

This really was a small world. The power of Regulation was too weak, and though the people that were guiding them in were only in the Genesis Tier, they could travel a few million miles in a single step. In just two or three steps, they were already led to the front of a dazzling palace.

“Three guests, the banquet will be held in the palace, so please go on ahead on your own.” The person turned back. He still had to continue his work to guide new guests.

Ling Han was just about to walk forwards when he suddenly took a sniff, and turned towards a row of courtyards at the side of the palace instead.
