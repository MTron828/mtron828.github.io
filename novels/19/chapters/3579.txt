Chapter 3580: Mistaken again

Translator: Henyee Translations | Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han was astonished.

Why was this person so stubborn, and was so determined to make things difficult for him?

He had walked all the way here from Seventh Change, Seventh Extreme, Seventh Inscriptions, and so on. The strength of his physique was not something that any Mystery Realm Tier cultivator could compare to, yet you insist on fighting him head-on. Had your head been kicked by a donkey?

However, since he was determined to clash head-on with his strengths, Ling

Han naturally would not be concerned either.

After exchanging a few more blows, Liu Huayun’s condition was extremely Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

poor.

His hair was completely disheveled, and his forehead was covered with cold sweat. That was from the pain.

It was really painful. He had broken at least three finger bones, and there were also a great many cracks on the bones of his arm. If they clashed a few more times, it was guaranteed that his arm would be crippled.

This was really ironic.

Previously, he had threatened to break Ling Han’s arms and legs, but what was the result? It seemed like his own hands had already been broken, and his arms were just about done.

It was clearly a head-on clash, and the shockwaves that both sides suffered were the same. Logically speaking, Ling Han should not be any better off than him.

But looking at Ling Han, who looked completely calm and composed, did he even look the slightest bit disheveled?

What kind of freak was this?

■Are you f*cking forged from Origin Gold?’

“Who exactly are you?” Liu Huayun forced out through gritted teeth. This setback had caused him to suffer too great a loss.

“I am Can Ye,” Ling Han said with a smile, hooking a finger at Liu Hua Yun.

“Didn’t you want to break my arms and legs? Come, I’m waiting.

Liu Huayun’s expression was livid. Wasn’t this a blatant slap to his face?

“Can Ye, I’ll remember you!” he said through gritted teeth. He really wanted to smash Ling Han to death with a single punch.

Ling Han spread his hands. He was very innocent in this matter, all right?

Liu Huaming had been thrashed by Niu Jianhua, so what did it have to do with him?

Why would he attract animosity?

He could not figure it out. He had clearly come out of the Divine Stone, so his luck value should have been full, so why had he encountered such an undeserved calamity?

Seeing Ling Han’s bitter expression, Liu Huayun couldn’t help but become even more furious. ‘You’ve already gained such a great advantage, so why do you still look like you’ve suffered a loss? Mockery, this is an absolute mockery.’ Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “Since you want to cripple my arms and legs, I naturally won’t be reserved either. I’ll just cripple five of your limbs.” Liu Huayun was startled. Five limbs, where did five limbs come from?

Ling Han saw that he was confused, and kindly explained, “The so-called fifth limb, only men have it.”

Only now did Liu Hua Yun understand. This f****** wanted to castrate him? “Can Ye, do you think that just because your physique is slightly stronger than mine, you will definitely win?” he asked coldly. From his sleeve, he drew out a long sword. It was slender like a whip and soft, but once it was activated with mystical power, the blade immediately straightened.

He formed a hand seal and pointed it directly at Ling Han. His whole person also exuded a sharp air of violence, as if he too had become a sword.

Ling Han was surprised. He had not thought that this guy would have some accomplishments in Sword Dao. Merely from the way he stood and stood, he already had a sliver of the graceful bearing of a Grandmaster of sword techniques.

-Can you still speak so stubbornly before my Deadly Thirteen Swords?” Liu Hua Yun asked proudly. When he was using a sword and when he was not, his battle prowess was completely different.

“King of boasting, make your move,” Ling Han said with a smile.

“YOU are asking for your own suffering!” Liu Huayun released a sharp cry, and charged towards Ling Han. As his sword swept out, it was blindingly bright.

Deadly Thirteen Swords, each strike fatal.

Ling Han activated his Eye Technique, capturing the weak point in the sword technique. He then tapped out a finger, and the mystical power shot out from the aperture on his fingertip. Pu! A streak of blood immediately appeared on Liu Huayun’s left shoulder.

What!

Liu Huayun’s attack suddenly came to an abrupt stop. He looked dumbly at Ling Han, his face filled with disbelief.

No matter what secret technique it was, there would be flaws, and in the process of cultivation, because he could not learn it properly, even more flaws would appear.

Liu Huayun was a prodigy of the Sword Dao. He had completely mastered this Deadly Thirteen Swords. Thus, he was only left with the weakness of the sword technique itself.

However, this kind of weak point was hidden in the fierce attacks. Ordinary people would not be able to see clearly even his sword technique, what more a weak point, so how could they possibly be able to grasp the weak point within? However, he had just launched his attack, when Ling Han’s finger shot out, directly targeting the only flaw in the sword technique. How could he not be shocked?

It must be a coincidence.

He pulled himself together, raised his sword again, and rapidly stabbed out at Ling Han.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and still tapped out a finger. Pu, the force passed through the weak point of the sword technique, and landed on Ling Han’s right rib.

Pu! Another burst of blood sprayed through the air.

Liu Huayun’s body trembled. He had done this twice in a row, and that was definitely not by luck, but rather because Ling Han had really managed to grasp the weak point in his sword technique.

How was this possible? How was this possible?

Ling Han was slightly surprised, and asked, “Yi, wasn’t it the Thirteen Swords?

Why aren’t you attacking anymore?”

What else was there to offer!

Liu Huayun shook his head. The might of the Deadly Thirteen Swords was incredibly powerful, but it was also because of this that it was too weak in terms of defense. That was because as long as he could kill his opponent with a thunderous force, what difference did it make whether his defense was strong or weak?

Previously, even if he had encountered an opponent that was evenly matched, as long as he used the Deadly Thirteen Swords, the latter would definitely only be able to defend, unlike Ling Han, who could make him bleed with a flick of a finger.

If he continued to use this sword technique, he would only be asking for trouble.

He once again drew his sword, but this time, the sword’s momentum was not so fierce. Instead, it had the air of a gentle breeze.

He changed his sword technique. This was the Misty Rain Sword.

Ling Han activated his ocular technique, and a smile appeared at the corners of his lips. This sword technique was different. It was more inclined towards defense, and was 30% offensive and 70% defensive. He had still grasped the weak point, but even if he managed to penetrate this weak point, his opponent would still be able to easily resolve it.

He tapped out a finger, and a burst of powerful Qi shot out. As expected, Liu Huayun’s sword changed course, and easily dispersed this attack.

Ling Han smiled faintly. Was this enough to oppose him?

He took the initiative to attack, unleashing the Lightning Fist. His attacks were instantly as quick as lightning.

This was a fist technique that he had obtained from the Seventh Imperial Prince. Ling Han didn’t usually use this fist technique, so it was very unlikely that anyone would recognize him through it. Moreover, since the Seventh imperial Prince could use it, there might be even more people who could use it as well. Thus, there should be no need for him to worry that his identity would be exposed.

Xiu, xiu, xiu! One after another, fist imprints shot towards Liu Huayun. They were like shooting stars that had fallen onto the ground, indescribably fast.

Liu Huayun brandished his sword in a slash. He was very aggressive, and was still launching attacks at Ling Han even though he was facing these punches head-on, wanting to turn the situation around.

Once Ling Han grasped the initiative, how could he allow his opponent to turn the tables?

His attacks became fiercer and fiercer, and he continued to suppress Liu Huayun.

Unfortunately, in order to conceal his identity, Ling Han couldn’t use the Demonic Monkey Fists, nor could he use the Heavenly Pattern Jade. Otherwise, if his battle prowess was fully unleashed, he would have long since disposed of this opponent.

Even so, Xiao Zhixuan’s small mouth was still wide open in shock.

She had misjudged again.

Previously, he had thought that Niu Jianhua was only an ordinary second-generation young master. She had not thought that Niu Jianhua was actually a one-star genius, and what was more unexpected was that Ling Han was actually stronger than Liu Huayun.

A martial arts tournament had actually attracted so many top-notch prodigies?
