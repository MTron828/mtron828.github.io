1273 Destroying Enemies

Faceless stood as firm and as upright as a mountain. His white clothes billowed gently, and an intense aura of smugness exuded from his body.

However, he was indeed powerful!

One could only act smug and show off if they were powerful. Otherwise, they would merely be making a fool of themself.

Astonishment finally spread across Xie Donglai’s face. Faceless’ aura had suddenly become profound and formidable, and it was as if he had become an untouchable god.

‘How is this possible? He’s clearly only at the medium extreme. So, how did he suddenly become so powerful?’

“Mister... you are?” Xie Donglai asked solemnly. He didn’t dare to underestimate his opponent anymore.

Faceless smiled faintly, and said, “You’re not worthy of learning my name.”

Xie Donglai was instantly enraged. He wasn’t worthy of learning his name? He was a descendant of Great General Xie, and his background was more so an Eternal River Tier force! Yet, he wasn’t worthy of learning his opponent’s name?

‘This person is even more arrogant than Ling Han! He’s even more detestable!’

“Die, die, die!” he roared. He had suppressed his anger for far too long in Wolf Fang City. Before that, he had also been kicked out of the Purple Moon Army’s territory before even making it into their encampment. Right now, his pent up anger was finally erupting.

The two elderly servants retrieved their weapons as they crawled back up. The forcefully suppressed the astonishment in their minds.

In the beginning, they had thought that Ling Han and Faceless were both at the medium extreme of the Sun Moon Tier. Thus, they had naturally felt that it beneath them to use God Tools. Now, however, Faceless had suddenly transformed into a formidable elite. As such, they naturally couldn’t maintain the same level of composure anymore.

“Brother Faceless, I’ll leave them to you!” Ling Han said with a smile.

“No problem,” Faceless replied calmly. He appeared especially relaxed. In fact, this was exactly how he felt at this moment. He was at the pinnacle level of the Sun Moon Tier, after all, so he could crush Xie Donglai and his two elderly servants with a simple wave of his hand.

‘Faceless?’

Xie Donglai had naturally heard Ling Han’s exchanges with Faceless. However, he didn’t believe that Faceless was genuinely his name. It was because of this that he had asked Faceless for his name. However, he had ended up being slapped across the face instead.

‘Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!’

Meanwhile, the two elderly servants charged at Faceless together. To his surprise, they actually possessed a combination attack formation. Their steps were like Yin and Yang, one high, one low, one above, and one below. The power of their attacks stacked together, and its might was genuinely impressive.

Faceless strummed his qin. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Weng!

A sound wave burst out and transformed into a spear that swept toward the two elders.

Peng!

The two elders were no match for this spear, and they were both sent flying by its formidable might.

‘This...!’

Xie Donglai trembled lightly. The combined attack of his two elderly servants was extremely powerful. When they teamed up, even he would struggle to defeat them. However, Faceless had defeated them with a simple strum of his qin.

“Sun Moon Tier... pinnacle level!” he said with a quiver in his voice. Apart from this, he couldn’t think of any other possibilities.

Faceless seemed indifferent, and he said, “My job is to hold you people back and have you watch on obediently. I suggest that you cooperate with me and don’t make me waste my strength. I despise people who trouble me unnecessarily. When it comes to such people, I have a habit of directly killing them. Understood?”

Xie Donglai wore an ugly expression. He was the descendent of an Eternal River Tier elite, yet he was actually being threatened like this! How could he accept this?

However, Faceless had already made himself very clear. If they continued to resist, he would directly kill them. He didn’t doubt Faceless’ killing intent one bit. People like him looked especially gentle and amiable, but when they started to kill people, they would become shockingly ruthless.

Xie Donglai and his two elderly servants didn’t dare to move. However, they had the background of Great General Xie, and they also had some life-saving trump cards up their sleeves. Thus, they still had a chance to escape even if Ling Han and Faceless tried to kill them and destroy the evidence of their actions.

Xie Donglai’s mind whirred as he stood watching the scenes before him. He wanted to invite this supreme prodigy to his side. If he could make Faceless his subordinate, his standing in the Xie Clan would definitely elevate to another level.

This wasn’t impossible. After all, Faceless still didn’t know his true identity yet.

‘Heh, so what if you’re a supreme prodigy? Can you pass the barrier of the Eternal River Tier?’

“Brother Faceless, I’m Xie—”

Pu!

A burst of Sword Qi slashed over just as Xie Donglai started to speak. The Sword Qi struck his mouth and instantly shattered several of his teeth. His words were naturally stuffed back into his mouth.

“If you utter any more nonsense, broken teeth will be the least of your worries!” Faceless said coldly.

Xie Donglai was as embarrassed as he was infuriated. Since when had he ever been humiliated like this before? However, he didn’t dare to voice his anger. Instead, he glared at Faceless, and promised himself that he would exact revenge in the future.

He would advance to the Heavenly Body Tier as quickly as he could and use his advantage in cultivation level to suppress him.

In any case, he genuinely didn’t dare to speak anymore.

Meanwhile, Ling Han stood opposite to Zhu Liyun.

“You want to kill me?” Zhu Liyun asked in scorn. She admitted that Ling Han was a supreme prodigy in alchemy. However, when it came to cultivation, he was only at the low extreme...

F*ck, wait! He was already at the medium extreme?

Zhu Liyun was stunned. Ling Han had only been at the middle stage of the low extreme when she had first met him. Only a few months had passed, yet he had already advanced to the medium extreme? This was utterly terrifying!

Were alchemists all this freakish?

“I don’t ‘want’ to kill you. I’ll definitely kill you!” Ling Han said gravely. He absolutely abhorred dishonest and disloyal people like her.

“Humph! So what if you’ve advanced rapidly? You’re still an entire two minor levels below me! This is an insurmountable gulf!” There was a cold sneer on Zhu Liyun’s face. If Faceless were her opponent, she would definitely wet herself in fright. However, Ling Han? Heh...

“Is that so?” Ling Han retrieved his Divine Demon Sword. He would kill this person with his full power.

Zhu Liyun also retrieved her God Tool. She wouldn’t relax and become careless just because her opponent’s cultivation level was below hers. Conceit was a bad habit of men. In order to achieve her goals, she would go all out and use any method possible.

In any case, this was a battle of life and death, so she would obviously use her full strength. As the saying went, a lion would use its full strength even when wrestling a rabbit.

Ling Han didn’t speak any more nonsense. Facing this kind of vile woman, there was only one thing he needed to do—kill her!

He lashed out with his Divine Demon Sword, which emitted a boundless divine light and bursts of devastating Sword Qi. The Sword Qi was like soaring dragons and crackling lightning. Its might was simply formidable.

A look of greed appeared in Xie Donglai’s eyes when he saw this. This was an incredibly powerful sword. In fact, even he could sense a shred of its might. If he could obtain this sword, perhaps his battle prowess would elevate by a noticeable amount.

However, a ruthless killer was standing right in front of him, so how would he dare to move?

Anyhow, Zhu Liyun was no pushover, either. This was mainly because she enjoyed a significant advantage in terms of cultivation level. This wasn’t something that could be overcome with a God Tool. She wielded a saber, and her strikes were bold and ferocious. Like an angry shrew shouting on the streets, her aura was vicious to the extreme.

After a few exchanges, Ling Han was instantly pushed to his back foot.

No one found this strange. After all, there were a whopping 11 stars between their cultivation levels. Even if Ling Han were a 10-star genius, he could only grit his teeth and accept defeat. In any case, it was impossible to become a 10-star genius unless one advanced to the pinnacle level. However, if Ling Han were at the pinnacle level, he would already possess the ability to suppress cultivators at the consummate level. Thus, this was an impossible cycle.

However, Ling Han had never planned to fight a long and drawn-out battle, and he had never planned to tire his opponent to death using his freakish physique and recovery ability. Instead, he directly retrieved the Misty Soul Capturing Flower.

Zhu Liyun’s eyes instantly glazed over when she saw this flower. Then, fervent excitement appeared on her face.

Pu!

Sword light slashed over, and a head flew into the air. A fountain of blood sprayed into the sky.
