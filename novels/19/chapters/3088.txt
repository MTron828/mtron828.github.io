3089 Bring Peace to the World

Extermination’s soul was very powerful, and it was now a fusion of two souls. The former Heavenly Venerate was even more incredible as he had fused with the souls of countless living beings in the Genesis World of the last era.

Although more than 90% of the souls had been reduced to ashes by the destruction of the Genesis World at that time, even with only 1% left, it would still be indescribably powerful when fused into a person’s body.

Thus, Extermination was confident enough that she could compete with Ling Han for control of the body, even if it was Ling Han’s own body.

Peng, with a heavy punch, Extermination’s spirit was instantly shattered, but these fragments all entered into Ling Han’s body, converging towards his mind.

With every piece, Extermination’s divine sense would become stronger. Upon reaching Ling Han’s mind, she also transformed into her human form.

…Being shattered by Ling Han’s fist was naturally a heavy blow to Extermination’s spirit. Right now, it was only left with less than 1% of its original strength, but this was already enough, far 10,000 times stronger than an ordinary Seventh Tier.

On the outside, without the control of Extermination’s divine sense, her physical body naturally couldn’t continue fighting any longer. It was blasted apart by only a single punch from Ling Han, and endless energy surged violently, transforming into billowing waves.

Ling Han’s body automatically absorbed this incomparably vigorous energy. Once he finished absorbing it, it would be equivalent to the energy of the entire Void and the entire Genesis World converging onto his body.

This was an endless power.

However, Lin Luo and the others were all nervous. The divine sense of Extermination had not been severed, and had even entered into Ling Han’s body. If she controlled Ling Han’s body, then all the good fortune would be obtained by her.

‘Ling Han, you must hold on. You can’t fall on this final step.’

Within the mind.

Extermination strode forward, heading straight towards the core of Ling Han’s mind. She wanted to find his spirit and kill him. This way, she could easily plunder Ling Han’s physical body.

“Looking for me?” Ling Han appeared, and his soul also transformed into a human form. He stood with his hands clasped behind his back, not feeling the slightest bit of nervousness.

Extermination looked at Ling Han, and revealed a cold smile. “You’re too conceited! Although your physical strength is invincible, when it comes to the strength of your soul, it’s impossible for you to compare to me!

“You are destined to be killed by me, and your body will become my new body and head to a new world!

“And all of this has nothing to do with you.”

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “You talk too much nonsense, and are wasting my time! So, hurry up and disappear completely!”

He took the initiative to attack and threw a punch at Extermination.

“If you fight me here, your own strength won’t be of any use at all!” Extermination cackled as she sent a palm strike towards Ling Han’s direction.

Peng!

This attack was solid, but it didn’t cause any waves. This was a clash of divine sense.

However, Extermination’s expression changed drastically, and she was immediately sent flying. Her body was also torn apart, turning into countless fragments.

Fortunately, this was a soul. Extermination’s body quickly reassembled and returned to its original state, but it was obvious that she had shrunk.

This attack was very damaging to her.

“H-how can your soul be stronger than mine?” Her face was filled with disbelief.

Ling Han smiled calmly, and said, “You’ve fused with many souls from the Genesis World of the last era, so you think you’re very impressive and awesome, right? But you wouldn’t have thought that the number of dimensions in my body now far exceeds the sum of the two Genesis Worlds of these two eras combined. Moreover, they’re all of the transcendent level, and have also developed living beings.

“Living beings will have willpower. When their willpower is combined, how could you be a match for them?”

Even if Extermination’s soul hadn’t been harmed, and she had fused with all the souls during the destruction of the Genesis World, she still wouldn’t have been able to compare to Ling Han, let alone under such circumstances when she had had to bear with discounted power.

If she could still be stronger than Ling Han, that would be unreasonable.

“Now, get out of my body!” Ling Han charged over and threw a punch. Peng, Extermination instantly retreated as her figure dimmed. She had suffered another serious injury.

“You, you deliberately let me invade your mind. This way, you can easily destroy my physical body and obtain all the energy!” Extermination came to a sudden realization—with the strength of Ling Han’s divine sense, it was utterly impossible for her to invade his mind.

Thus, Ling Han had intentionally screwed her over. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Under the continuous barrage of attacks, Extermination could only retreat step by step. In the end, she was blasted out of the mind, expelled from Ling Han’s body, and transformed into a ball of flickering light.

Now that her physical body had been destroyed, her remnant soul was like a rootless duckweed.

Extermination was unwilling to die. She looked at Lin Luo and the others, wanting to plunder another body.

“You’re deluding yourself!” Ling Han said. He threw a punch, and peng, Extermination’s soul was instantly shattered.

Boom! A ripple spread through the entire Void.

The tyrant of an era had finally perished and completely disappeared from the world.

It had to be admitted that Extermination was an incomparably powerful existence. Unfortunately, she had to stand against Ling Han.

Lin Luo and the others were all watching. Right now, Ling Han was absorbing the boundless energy of Extermination. When Ling Han completed this step, he would possess the ability to pierce through this world.

Now, the Void was already dead, and it was impossible for the Genesis World to be reborn. They could only hope that Ling Han would open the door to a new world. Otherwise, although they would not die, they would feel even worse than death.

Endless life, endless loneliness, and endless silence.

100,000 years later, Ling Han suddenly opened his eyes, and a majestic light flashed past like a thunderbolt.

He casually moved his limbs, and a terrifying power instantly surged, as if the Void couldn’t withstand it, and was about to shatter.

“Ling Han!” Lin Luo and the others said one after another. For an ultimate elite of Seventh Tier, 100,000 years of waiting was naturally not a big deal.

There was an end to waiting like this. If Ling Han told them that he was unable to break through this heaven and earth, then even Lin Luo and the others would feel as if time was crawling and eventually go crazy under that boundless despair.

Ling Han nodded, and looked at everyone. “Now, I have enough power to open that door and head to another new world—but I also don’t know what the situation there is like.

“Everyone, are you going or staying?”

Unsurprisingly, Lin Luo and the others expressed that they were going. If they stayed here, so what if they had eternal life? This kind of loneliness was unbearable.

“Alright, then I’ll open this door!”

Ling Han arrived at the place where the door of light had appeared earlier. He channeled all of his power, and threw a punch.

Peng!

The Void trembled, and a passageway was forcefully formed.

“Everyone, let’s go!” Ling Han turned around, revealing a faint smile.
