Chapter 3538: Exchange of Stones

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The rock-like creature was clearly ambushing them, because when Ling Han threw out the Heavenly Pattern Jade, it immediately leaped up and charged towards Ling Han.

Unfortunately, it definitely had not foreseen that Ling Han would actually have a deadly weapon like the Heavenly Pattern Jade in his possession.

With eleven times the speed of sound blasting out, how could it possibly dodge?

—If Ling Han hadn’t made a move yet, it could still dodge in advance through judging the course of Ling Han’s attack.

However, once the Heavenly Pattern Jade was unleashed, it would reach 11 times the speed of sound, and at such a close distance, even Mystery Realm Tier elites wouldn’t be able to dodge it, what more when it was charging towards Ling Han.

Peng!

It was only a single strike, and this creature was forcefully destroyed. The Heavenly Pattern Jade was a Two Star Material, and it was a specialized spiritual tool. Even if it was Ling Han that had activated it, it still possessed incredibly astonishing might.

“Yi?” Ling Han walked over. Though this creature had been blasted apart, there was no blood or flesh left behind. Instead, there was only a gray round core, which was only about the size of a jujube.

He picked up the round core, and saw that there were multiple veined patterns on it, exuding an ancient aura.

Yi, this was not a living being?

Ling Han was very curious. He had clearly seen the blood and Qi of this thing, but it was actually not a body of flesh and blood?

Judging from this round core, that rock creature should have been formed by a formation, so it had no flesh and blood, and this round core was its core.

Ling Han held the round core in his hand and tossed it around. There was nothing special about it, but he still put it away. It was naturally impossible to throw away something that he did not know the purpose of. In any case, it did not take up much space.

“Let’s go.”

They continued onwards. This time, Ling Han kept an eye out, and carefully observed the rocks on either side of the path. If he saw anything off, he would activate his eye technique to observe.

There was nothing wrong with being careful. He actually discovered a few monsters formed by formations, and he used the Heavenly Pattern Jade to launch a sneak attack on them, killing them cleanly.

If anyone saw this, they would definitely exclaim in disbelief. Since when had Inscription Tiers become so awesome, being able to kill monsters two levels above them?

The number of circular cores in Ling Han’s hands gradually increased. Though he had studied them carefully, he still did not discover anything off about them. However, he still put away every single sphere.

After a day, Ling Han collected 25 circular cores, which also meant that he had killed 25 monsters formed by formations.

This battle merit was something to be a little proud of, especially when Ling Han was only in the level of Inscription Tier. Probably no one would believe it even if he told them.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

It could not be helped. Who asked these monsters formed by formations to be waiting for a chance to ambush them, and Ling Han just happened to have Heavenly Pattern Jade?

Neither of these two factors could be overlooked. Otherwise, even if Ling Han was lucky enough to succeed, that should only be a one-time thing, unlike now, when he had succeeded every time, and each time was fatal. This efficiency was really too high.

When night fell, this craggy and steep mountain path finally came to an end. A stone house appeared in front of them, standing erect very abruptly, and behind the stone house was a large lake.

Ling Han pondered for a moment. He then used his ocular technique to examine the stone house before walking over.

The inside was very simple. There was only a very large stone table, and what was strange was that there was a circle of holes in the centre of the stone table. Upon counting, there were a total of nine holes. They were not very big, and could only fit something the size of a date, at most.

It couldn’t be so coincidental, right?

Ling Han subconsciously took out a round core, and placed it inside the hole. It was just right. Half of it was embedded, and the other half was exposed, as if it had been tailor-made.

“All right,” Fourth Baby said.

“Yi, Father, you’ve taken so many beads, so why don’t you try placing them here?” Fifth Baby also said.

Ling Han did as he was told, and inserted one round core after another. When all nine round cores were inserted, a strange scene appeared. The nine round cores sank at the same time, and a rock appeared in the centre of the table. It was slightly smaller than a fist.

Yi, this was a Divine Stone?

“This is Extreme Frost Cold Stone,” Second Baby immediately said, “Building a celestial foundation from this core can allow a Celestial Foundation to possess the power of extreme cold, comparable to a ninth grade Mystical Power.”

Ninth grade?

This was already very impressive. After all, it was Mystical Power, and to be crowned with this title, it naturally had to be very impressive.

Ling Han was surprised. As it turned out, fighting monsters could be used to trade for treasures.

He put away the Extreme Frost Cold Stone, and put in nine round cores. When the round cores disappeared, a stone immediately replaced them.

“Flame Spirit Stone,” Seventh Baby said, yawning as she spoke. “It can allow cultivators to possess a divine flame…”

Before she could even finish her sentence, she did not disappoint everyone’s expectations and collapsed onto the ground. With a hu, hu, hu, hu, she had already fallen asleep.

As expected of the Sleeping God.

Unfortunately, there were only seven round cores left, which was not enough to trade for another Divine Stone.

Though he had only obtained two Divine Stones that could only compare to a ninth grade Mystical Power, this was already very impressive. It was said that even the highest grade Divine Stones could not compare to a first grade Mystical Power. It could not be helped. The highest grade Innate Divine Physique was definitely gifted by the heavens.

Ling Han didn’t stay in the stone house for too long. If he spent the night here, it was extremely likely that someone would come in the middle of the night. Who knew if they would have malicious intentions toward him?

There was also Hong Tianbu, and he was most likely still searching for Ling Han on the outer circle of the island. After all, he hadn’t obtained any stone to pass through. Logically speaking, he shouldn’t have been able to reach the foot of the mountain.

Thus, Hong Tianbu should have searched for a very long time before realizing that he had already ascended the mountain.

Ling Han exited the stone house. Next was a large lake, and there was a small raft on the banks.

This raft was really very small, and could only seat one person. Ling Han had the babies and the perverted pig enter the Essence Nurturing Gourd while he jumped onto the raft and rowed towards the opposite bank of the lake.

Huala, the wooden oars sank into the water, creating a splash. The night breeze blew, making one feel carefree and relaxed.

Ling Han also felt a sense of relaxation that he had never experienced before. After entering this world, he had been continuously cultivating and battling. It was rare for him to have a moment of relaxation like rowing a raft on a lake.

He closed his eyes, and just paddled like that, enjoying the feeling of the lake water lightly patting the small raft.

Hold on!

His eyes suddenly snapped open, and he looked towards the surface of the lake. Involuntarily, his expression couldn’t help but change.

—There was not the slightest change to the moon in the lake!

How could this be? The lake waters were moving, and that would definitely cause a change to appear in the reflection of the moon.

Pa, right at this moment, a huge wave suddenly rose up on the surface of the lake. A massive tentacle broke through the water, and struck heavily towards the small raft.

If Ling Han had been careless all this while, it was extremely possible that this attack would have caused him to be consigned to eternal damnation. However, since he had already become alert, it was naturally impossible that he would be hit.

He leaped up high, and leaped forwards.

Because he had not used Imminent Skyline, and it was indeed a little rushed, this leap only covered a distance of a few dozen meters. Ling Han’s right foot landed, and stepped on the surface of the water. He planned to borrow a little tension from the surface of the water.

But when his feet touched the surface of the water, he did not manage to borrow the slightest bit of power, and his whole person instantly sank straight downwards..
