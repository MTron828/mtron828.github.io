Chapter 416: Terribly Conned

Haha!” Ling Han laughed loudly. With a casual toss of his hand, the black rock inside his grasp was immediately thrown out.

“No!” the Asura Demon Emperor roared in fury. He had indeed possessed the Primal Chaos Source Rock, but the problem was this piece of Primal Chaos Source Rock was much too small. It was actually the size of a peanut and there was only a pitifully small amount of Chaos Source within.

When members of his race took over the bodies of other living things, they indeed paid no mind to the build of their victims. It could be as small as the Golden Mosquito Ant or as big as the Howling Heaven Beast, and they could adapt anyways. Moreover, even if they were not satisfied, then they could always change to a new body. At worst, they would only experience a period of weakness.

But the Primal Chaos Source Rock was different; once fused, this was an irreversible process. He could never come back out. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

If the Primal Chaos Source Rock was big enough and possessed sufficient Chaos Source, this would give them unlimited space to expand. They would be able to swallow all the souls in this world and fuse with them. They would then be able to endlessly increase their personal power until it reached the maximum amount the Primal Chaos Source Rock could allow.

Which also meant that the bigger the Primal Chaos Source Rock was, the more Chaos Source it contained, and thus the bigger his potential to become stronger.

But the problem was not that the Primal Chaos Source Rock was too big, but that it was too small—much too small. It was so small that it could only accommodate a shattered piece of his soul! Moreover, there was only a scrap of Chaos Source inside, and he could not possibly increase his power with that.

What did that mean? It meant that his power would eternally stagnate on this level, and he might not even be able to re-absorb the other eight pieces of his soul.

Of course, there was still a way to solve this matter, and that was for this piece of his soul would be swallowed.

How could this be? The Primal Chaos Source Rock he had seen was definitely not as small as this.

Ling Han laughed quietly. The instant that he was knocked down by the Asura Demon Emperor, he drew the large black rock into the Black Tower, then withdrew the small black rock and shoved it at the former. Furthermore, the Chaos Source in this small black rock had been largely sucked out by Small Tower, so there was only a slight sliver remaining.

Sure enough, the Asura Demon Emperor did not even pause to think, overwhelmed by his anxiety. The moment he sensed the aura of the black rock, he immediately streamed inside.

...Small Tower had told him of the relationship between Primal Chaos Demonic Qi and Primal Chaos Source Rock. Thus, he came up with this plan in that single instant and managed to successfully dupe the Asura Demon Emperor.

That small black rock actually began to shake, trying its best to transform into human form. Ling Han rushed forward and delivered a kick. “Old demon, I’ll see you next time!”

The pitiful Asura Demon Emperor was in the process of fusing with the Primal Chaos Source Rock. Since the two of them came from the same source, this process, once begun, was unstoppable. So how could he possibly be capable of defending himself? He instantly flew off into distance from the force of the kick.

“You damn human boy, just wait, I will definitely kill you!” Asura Demon Emperor roared in fury. He had been horribly conned.

“I’ve finally vented my grudge!” Ling Han laughed loudly. Now, the Asura Demon Emperor only possessed one-ninth of the power he’d possessed at his strongest at most. Even if he possessed an immortal body, he could still be suppressed, and it would be much easier to deal with him in this way.

And now that the Primal Chaos Source Rock had been removed, the Demonic Qi in this place would slowly disperse until it became nothing. By that time, this Dark Devil Forest would be history.

Phew, he was in a good mood.

Ling Han laughed. Being able to ruthlessly con an old demon—an immortal monster from millenia past—caused a sense of fulfilment to spring up unbidden. There was only one word for it: invigorating!

“En!” He heard moaning and saw that Rong Huan Xuan was actually getting to his feet staggeringly.

F***, this guy was still alive?

Ling Han knew that his body had not died before, but being taken over by the Asura Demon Emperor, his consciousness was actually not erased? When had the Asura Demon Emperor become so “kind”?

“You never thought that I would be still alive, right!?” Rong Huan Xuan stared fixatedly at Ling Han. He had never been on good terms with Ling Han from the moment they met.

This Rong Huan Xuan was the original Rong Huan Xuan, and also the real Rong Huan Xuan.

Ling Han sighed and said, “Sure enough, good people don’t live long, whereas evil survives a thousand years. He’s still not dead even with that!”

“Hahahaha, I refine Corpse Qi, so I won’t die so easily!” Rong Huan Xuan stared at Ling Han and said with a cold smirk, “I not only did not die; furthermore, my power is superior to yours!”

“Ai, my previous good mood has now been ruined.” Ling Han shook his head. “If we’re being honest here, I am your savior at the very least. Is this how you are going to repay me?”

“I will refine you into a Corpse Soldier and allow you to exist forever—that’ll be good enough, right?” Rong Huan Xuan laughed loudly and took the initiative to attack.

A smile appeared at the corners of Ling Han’s lips as he said, “It seems that you are being smug too soon!” He advanced to parry the oncoming attack, without any signs of fear.

Peng!

The two attacks collided and Rong Huan Xuan was forced into a continuous retreat. A flush appeared on his pale face as if he had dabbed blusher on his cheeks.

“How could this happen!?” Rong Huan Xuan exclaimed in shock. He actually lost to Ling Han in a clash of force.

“Let me kindly explain it to you.” Ling Han smiled slightly. “You managed to enter the Spiritual Pedestal Tier because of the Demonic Qi, but it was the Asura Demon Emperor who was guiding things. You yourself do not cultivate Demonic Qi, so how could you possibly make full use of that kind of power? Moreover, you are only in the first layer of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier, and without the Demonic Qi in this place compounding with your own ability, I will be able to suppress you seventeen or eighteen times with one arm.”

Rong Huan Xuan fumed angrily. A brat in the seventh layer of the Spiritual Ocean Tier actually pointed at his nose and said that he was just in the first layer of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier—how could that still be logical? However, there was one thing that Ling Han was right about, and that was none of the members of the Thousand Corpse Sect was known for their own personal ability, but rather depended on their Corpse Soldiers!

He now had no Corpse Soldiers to help him, so he was only an ordinary cultivator of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier. Furthermore, he was a cultivator that had just broken through to the Spiritual Pedestal Tier. Putting Ling Han aside, even Shen Zhong Cheng would be able to kill him.

“Now that I’ve regained my body, I will begin to cultivate Corpse Qi again. When I obtain powerful Corpse Soldier, I will come to seek you again!” Rong Huan Xuan left behind a line that fit the situation, and jumped into the Three Live Corpse Caskets. Hong , the Spirit Tool activated and fled.

Since he could not beat his foe, then he of course had to flee... or what? Staying for supper?

“I temporarily suppressed a problem, but I’ve also gotten a new problem. I don’t know if this is right or wrong,” Ling Han mumbled. He had now split “Rong Huan Xuan” into two. Though the ability of the Asura Demon Emperor was under control now, he had transformed into a real undying body, whereas Rong Huan Xuan was “revived”. With the protection of the Three Live Corpse Caskets, he, too, possessed an undying body.

“The so-called undying body is only relative.” Ling Han soon smiled confidently. “As long as my power is strong to a certain extent, even if Rong Huan Xuan hid himself in the Three Live Corpse Caskets, I would still be able to kill him with a shock wave! As for the Primal Chaos Source Rock? If this thing was really indestructible, how could it have been shattered in the first place?”

The small black rock from inside the brain of the giant serpent had most likely fallen off from the big black rock. This meant that the Primal Chaos Source Rock could be shattered.

“I’ve already obtained the Primal Chaos Source Rock and the Heavenly Luck Stone; now I only need to get the Crimson Red Chilling Ice Grass and this trip to the Dark Devil Forest will be over!”

Not just over—merely the Heavenly Luck Stone had made this trip more than worth it. Furthermore, though Ling Han could not use the Primal Chaos Source Rock, its value was estimated to be hundredfold, thousandfold, or even millionfold the value of the Heavenly Luck Stone.

One had to understand that this was an item that could be useful to the Black Tower.

Ling Han planned to leave behind a small piece to improve his divine sense; the rest would be refined by the Black Tower, which would extract the Source Power inside to repair itself.

The two of them advanced in the opposite direction of the valley. He did not want to encounter anyone else at this time. He only wanted to quietly collect the Crimson Red Chilling Ice Grass, then return to Extreme Yang City. When he obtained the last ingredient, the Nine Leaf Black Ganoderma, he would finally be able to concoct the Restore Spirit Pill.
