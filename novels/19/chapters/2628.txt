Chapter 2629: An Eighth Heaven Celestial King moves

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“A mere Fifth Heaven Celestial King, quickly throw down your sword and surrender!” That Eighth Heaven Celestial King stood with his hands crossed behind his back, appearing very powerful and authoritative.

He naturally had the right to do this. He was an Eighth Heaven Celestial King, merely a single cultivation level away from the peak battle prowess of the Celestial King Graveyard. He naturally had the right to make demands, and could act domineering.

The Empress couldn’t be bothered to even respond. WIth Celestial Tool in hand, she wanted a battle.

“I am Zhang Tianyan!” that Eighth Heaven Celestial King announced. “Seeing as how your natural talent is not too bad, I will give you a chance to survive. As long as you are willing to become my disciple, I can spare your life, and can teach you supreme techniques!”

He coveted the Empress’s exquisite beauty. It was a lie that he was going to take her as a disciple; the truth was that he wanted to make her his mistress.

The Empress shouted lightly, and took the initiative to attack.

“You are biting off more than you can chew!” Zhang Tianyan smirked coldly. He delivered a palm strike, and?weng, a frightening pressure assailed. Regulations took solid form, pressing down on the Empress.

Peng!

The Empress was instantly sent flying. Though she was very strong, she could not compare to Ling Han, so how could she match an Eighth Heaven opponent when she herself was only in the Fifth Heaven?

Thankfully, the Celestial Tool sliced apart the Regulations, so she was not too heavily injured.

“Where’s that brat?” Zhang Tianyan’s gaze wandered. He feared that Ling Han would flee directly when he saw Zhang Tianyan move. If that happened, Ling Han really might be able to escape.

The Empress gave no answer. She grabbed out with her left hand, and boundless water vapor and lightning were drawn towards her. Meanwhile, grass sprouted on the ground, trying its best to grow.

“Yi!” Zhang Tianyan looked slightly surprised. Regulations of Water, Wood, and Lightning were rapidly being drawn and fused in the Empress’s hands. Ordinarily speaking, a Fifth Heaven Celestial King definitely could not possibly gather so many Regulations. This had reached the Seventh Heaven Celestial King Tier!

‘Interesting!’ Zhang Tianyan’s eyes slightly lit up. ‘This little girl has actually grasped a secret technique, and it seems very extraordinary.’

He was greatly moved. He could obtain both the beauty and a secret technique. He was really coming back with full rewards this time. In comparison, even if he did not capture that man from before, it did not seem all that important now. In any case, other Celestial Kings would still move.

‘I’ll have to see exactly how extraordinary this secret technique is,’ Zhang Tianyan thought to himself.

As he thought this, the Empress had completely gathered the three kinds of Regulations. Divine Fluid Raging Lightning had fused with Azure Wood Chaotic Lightning, turning into Lightning of Water and Wood. A greenish-black spear of lightning appeared, gripped in the Empress’s hand.

“This truly is very extraordinary. If I was the slightest bit careless, this attack could even rip through my defense!” Zhang Tianyan mumbled, his eyes even brighter. The reason he had entered this place was so he could obtain the remaining six parts of the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll, yet now he discovered that the secret technique the Empress possessed was not the slightest bit inferior to it.

This was a great profit.

Crack!

The Empress moved, throwing the lightning spear, which shot rapidly towards Zhang Tianyan.

Zhang Tianyan was proud of his own strength, and naturally would not even bother to dodge. He stretched out a hand and grabbed the lightning spear. Great dao wrapped around his hand, and practically no technique could touch him.

Pa!?However, he clearly overestimated his own strength, and also underestimated the might of this Heavenly Venerate Technique. Though he had got hold of the lightning spear, the lightning was still wreaking havoc, and still caused his right hand to explode, blood seeping from the wounds.

This could only be considered minor injury, but the attack of a Fifth Heaven Celestial King could actually make an Eighth Heaven Celestial King bleed. By itself, this was an extremely rare event.

Yet Zhang Tianyan was not furious, but rather delighted. The power of the lightning spear was too strong, but it also brought him a great pleasant surprise. If he could obtain this secret technique, then could he use this to intimidate Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings?

He laughed loudly, and he approached the Empress quickly with a flash.

Since he had already witnessed the might of this secret technique, he had also lost his patience. Now he was going to capture the Empress, and gain both her and her secret technique for himself.

It was true that the Empress was proud, but she was not stupid. Since an Eighth Heaven Celestial King had unleashed his might, how could she possibly face him head-on? With a quick flash of her figure, she dodged.

“You want to escape from me, you are truly dreaming!” Zhang Tianyan laughed loudly. His large hand descended, and everything within five km of him had fallen under his control. Even Regulations would have to submit to him.

That was how domineering an Eighth Heaven Celestial King could be.

The Empress remained cold. The Celestial Tool in her hand slashed out, forcefully cutting out a path for herself.

“En, a Celestial Tool?” Zhang Tianyan was taken back, and then laughed loudly. He was really overjoyed by now. This was not just two birds with one stone, but three. He could actually gain a Celestial Tool as well with this move.

Was this a supreme opportunity that the heavens had bestowed on him?

“Where are you running to!” He moved once more, drawing on the Regulations of heaven and earth which turned into multiple pillars that surrounded the Empress.

The Empress brandished the Celestial Tool to open a path for herself, while her left hand continued to use Lightning of Water and Wood to deliver blasts at Zhang Tianyan, forcing him to slow down.

Back and forth, Zhang Tianyan shockingly discovered that he actually was unable to do anything against the Empress.

It was not that the Empress was heaven-defyingly powerful, but rather that the Celestial Tool she had in her hand could cut through anything and everything. Even the prison that he had formed from Regulations was easily sliced through, and more importantly, he also had reservations in his offensive. He was not willing to harm the Empress. He wanted to capture for himself a complete, flawless beauty, and that was how the Empress managed to easily evade him every time.

After several times, Zhang Tianyan had gradually lost his patience.

In his eyes, the Empress was no longer a person, but rather a treasure chamber. He was determined to obtain her, and she was not to be shared with anyone else, either.

If he had to injure her, so be it. In any case, as long as the core of a Celestial King was not injured, any injury could be quickly recovered.

With these thoughts, the intensity of his attacks increased countless times over, causing the Empress to be seemingly in a difficult situation.

It could not be helped. The gap in cultivation level was too wide. The fact that the Empress could hold on until now was already very, very impressive.

“If you do not want to suffer any longer, surrender quickly!” Zhang Tianyan demanded coldly. For Celestial Kings like him, once they had steadied their resolve, their will definitely could not be shaken. No matter how pitiful the Empress looked, it was not enough to soften his heart.

The Empress still stayed silent. What worth did this damn bug have to make her speak?

“Stubborn!” Zhang Tianyan humphed, and slashed out his palms towards the Empress like they were two axes.

Even if he was wary of the might of the Celestial Tool, and dared not approach too close, with the attack that was driven by the cultivation level of an Eighth Heaven Celestial King, every palm strike would be heavy as a mountain, smashing forcefully through Regulations, and also made it extremely difficult for the Empress herself to draw on any Regulations.

This was the strength of a high-level Celestial King. With their superior cultivation level, they could directly empty out all Regulations in the area, and lower-level Celestial Kings would not be able to draw on Regulations. They would be forcefully suppressed to the Severing Mundane Tier.

The Empress could only use the Celestial Tool to attack him. It was not affected by Zhang Tianyan, and could destroy anything in this world.

“Just sit down obediently!” Zhang Tianyan laughed loudly. He had already grasped the upper hand completely. Pressing down a single palm, he wanted to crumble all of the Empress’s battle prowess.

But when he lowered his palm, he discovered that he had actually become exceedingly slow.

“Yi, Regulations of Time?” He was surprised. Faced with his great power, the Empress should not have been able to draw on any kind of Regulations at all, so where had these Regulations of Time come from then? Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Moreover, being able to use Regulations of Time when she herself was not yet Ninth Heaven, just how heaven-defying was the good luck of this pretty little girl?

Xiu!?The Empress took advantage of the opening to slice out of the siege and once again escape.

She had used the Greatest Eternity Everlasting Physique. Her own physique naturally could not possibly be sealed by Zhang Tianyan. Otherwise, that would mean that she had already fallen into his hands.

“I don’t believe this. How could it be that I can’t capture a little Fifth Heaven Celestial King like you!!” Zhang Tianyan was also truly angered now. He, a great Eighth Heaven Celestial King, had moved, and actually had not been able to capture his prey after such a long time.

“Oh, is that right?” Ling Han’s cold voice rang out.
