Chapter 1758: Invitation from the large black dog

The search for the whereabouts of Ling Han and the Empress naturally ended in failure again.

And from this, Ling Han found out that at least a Dividing Soul Tier elite was still not strong enough to discover the existence of the Black Tower, and when he thought further about it, the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire, too, did not show any reaction about the Black Tower. Thus, this line of safety could completely be stretched to the Immortal Palace Tier.

If he encountered an Ascending Origin Tier elite, he would have to be careful... In any case, Celestial Kings were definitely capable of discovering the existence of the Black Tower. This was something that Small Tower had reminded him about over and over again.

Han Hongfei was very furious. He, a powerful Yang Soul grand elder, had made a move, and he was actually going to return empty-handed?

He did not only want to apprehend Ling Han to preserve the prestige of the Han Clan, but also wanted to snatch all the fated opportunities belonging to Ling Han, which very possibly could contain a Celestial King technique. If it was not for the fact that the Han Clan did not want to draw attention, they’d actually very much want to send an Immortal Palace Tier elite over.

Finally, when Han Hongfei saw the Empress, he had gained inappropriate desires as well. This kind of exquisite beauty was definitely enough to enchant anyone, and he could not control himself at all.

Unfortunately, all his wishes had turned out to be moot. What could he do if he could not even find his target? Even if he was very powerful, it was completely useless.

He dug three feet into the ground in a search, unwilling to give up the matter. He was definitely not going to believe that Ling Han was capable of using a spatial teleportation secret technique in front of him. In this manner, the ancestral shrine of the Ding Clan was completely ruined.

At first, the ancestral shrine could still be rebuilt, and the memorial tablets could be rearranged, and then they would be able to “return 18 years later as a good man”[1]. But the situation now was Han Hongfei had refined every single tile and brick into nothing. He worried that Ling Han’s Spatial God Tool was extremely small, which would allow him to escape by passing off as rubble.

Ding Yaolong’s face had turned pale, and as he watched the memorial tablets of “Ding” so on and so forth being refined, his heart was dripping blood.

The ancestors!

He did not dare stop him, and his hatred for Ling Han only intensified many times over in his heart. He swore that if he had the chance, he would definitely tear Ling Han into pieces.

Not only did Han Hongfei refine all the objects on the ground once over, he even removed layer after layer of the ground, right until groundwater surged out of the ground, turning the area of the ancestral shrine of the Ding Clan into a lake, and only then did he reluctantly give up.

He really could not find that brat.

Could it be that he really had used some kind of spatial secret technique?

The secret technique of a Celestial King?

Gasp!

Immediately, his expression changed drastically, and he showed an incredibly jealous expression.

There was a gap of a whole major tier, which meant four minor levels, between himself and Ling Han. This difference in strength was really too boundless, but he still managed to pull the wool over his eyes. This kind of secret technique was really too powerful.

If he could obtain it, then wouldn’t he have no need to fear even if faced with an Immortal Palace Tier elite?

Han Hongfei was unwilling to give up, and took residence in the Ding Clan Manor. In any case, Celestials had a limitless lifespan, so he could completely afford to wait. He was taking a gamble that perhaps Ling Han was still in the vicinity. That was because he had indeed not sensed any ripple in time and space. Perhaps Ling Han had only temporarily entered into a separate dimension, and that was why he could not discover his existence.

With Han Hongfei keeping watch, the Duan Clan and Long Clan naturally did not dare mobilize troops against the Ding Clan and rise in revolt about the matter of the Bell of Ten Thousand Ghosts. However, they immediately sent someone to report the issue to the Black Moon Sect. In fact, if the Black Moon Sect could not settle the matter, they would continue to report the matter further up the hierarchy. This kind of evil weapon definitely could not be allowed to appear!

After Ling Han stayed for a few days in the Black Tower, he left quietly. He deliberately repressed his aura, and it was extremely difficult for even a Yang Soul elite to discover him—unless his eyes just happened to spot him, or he was overwhelmingly close to him.

“Little Han, come with Grandpa Dog.” However, Ling Han had not walked for too long when the large black dog turned up from an unknown corner. He was standing on his hind legs, and slung an arm around Ling Han’s shoulders as if they were close brothers. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The nose of a dog was indeed sensitive.

Yet Ling Han’s heart was filled with caution. This large black dog would trick everyone and anyone, and one definitely could not trust its warm attitude. Otherwise, one would definitely fall for one of its tricks without even knowing it.

“What?” he asked casually.

“Grandpa Dog discovered an ancient site, and there is a considerable number of Celestial medicines there. Are you interested in taking a trip with Grandpa Dog?” the large black dog asked.

Ling Han was filled with suspicion. “If there was actually something as good as that, you actually did not think of taking it all for your own?”

“What kind of dog do you think Grandpa Dog is?” The large black dod had an expression of indignant fury as if he had suffered some grave injustice. “And to think that Grandpa Dog thought of you at the very first moment, yet you actually doubt me like this... Grandpa Dog must have gone blind, and trusted a cruel dog like you wrongly... Pei, pei, pei!”

Ling Han’s expression was filled with disdain, and he retorted, “Your expression is so exaggerated, it is making me even more suspicious.”

The large black dog immediately came to an abrupt stop, stretched his paw into his iron underwear, and scratched. He bared his teeth in a grin. “I didn’t think that you would have discovered Grandpa Dog’s true face so quickly. If I want to deceive you in the future, the difficulty level will increase considerably.”

Supporting his chin, he put on an expression of deep thought. That could not be allowed.

Ling Han instantly sent a kick over. This damn dog was really despicable.

“All right, brat. That ancient site is slightly dangerous, and Grandpa Dog needs you to keep watch and become a hired thug.” The large black dog revealed the truth as he leaped out of the way of the attack.

Ling Han’s expression was filled with suspicion. The large black dog definitely could not have spoken the truth so easily.

However, though the large black dog was cunning, it did indeed seem like he had never truly harmed Ling Han before.

“Fine, I’ll go!” LLing Han nodded. With the help of Celestial medicine, his cultivation level would advance even faster. If he could advance into the second severance, then he could easily kill any member of the Ding Clan aside from Ding Yaolong himself.

Even if he faced Ding Yaolong, he would not be like how he had been before, only managing to dodge and run. No matter what, he could counter at least once or twice.

“I knew that you’re a cunning brat, and would definitely agree,” the large black dog said, grinning.

The man and dog arrived at a dense forest, and the large black dog drew out multiple pieces of Godly metal which it arranged on the ground, building what looked similar to a sacrificial altar.

This was not Godly metal, but was rather Pseudo-Divine Metal!

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel envious. He really wanted to steal a few pieces for himself. He did not mind how many Stars the Pseudo-Divine Metal was as long as he could toss them over to the Divine Demon Sword to consume. However, he immediately curiously asked, “Little Black, weren’t we heading to some ancient site?”

“Ptui, how long do you plan on running on your two legs? Even if I am specialized in spatial teleportation, don’t even think of reaching the place if we’re not spending 10 to 15 days,” the large black dog said disdainfully. “You don’t understand, brat. Grandpa Dog is presently constructing a teleportation formation.”

Ling Han was puzzled, and asked, “You actually know how to use formations?”

“Of course. All those years ago, I— yi!” The large black dog stopped moving his paws, and scratched his behind. “What did I do all those years ago? So strange, I seem to have lost a large amount of my memories!”

Ling Han had the same feeling. The origin of the large black dog was definitely extraordinary. When he had still been in Genesis Tier, he could bite the behind of a fourth severance grand elder. Though he did not manage to inflict injury with its bite, being able to bite the latter was already an incredibly bizarre feat.

Ling Han was freakish enough, right? But if it was him who had to secretly approach a fourth severance grand elder and make a move on him without the latter realizing it, putting aside the fact that he was not capable of it in the Genesis Tier, he could not possibly accomplish it even now.

“Aaah, Grandpa Dog can’t remember!” The large black dog went nuts for a while, and then suddenly showed a wicked grin. “Come, let’s go and rob that ancient site completely.”

The speed at which he suddenly changed attitude was completely unexpected to Ling Han.

What kind of thought process was going on in his head?

The large black dog arranged for a very long while, and a small-scale sacrificial altar was already built. Ling Han and he ascended it, and the latter repeated a chant. That was an incredibly dry and obscure chant, and the pronunciation was very strange.

Ling Han tried to repeat it, but shockingly discovered that he actually could not remember a single letter!

Weng, it was at this moment that the sacrificial altar glowed, and the light wrapped around both man and dog. Then, it trembled slightly. When the light had dispersed, both Ling Han and the large black dog had disappeared without a trace.
