Chapter 1205: Failure?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Zhu Tianchou was astonished.

Ling Han was merely in the Mountain River Tier, yet the burst of speed actually made him faster than even him. Was this possible?

However, even if he didn’t want to, he had to believe this. Not only did the gap between himself and Ling Han not shorten, it was instead widening endlessly.

‘So fortunate,’ he thought. Previously, it’d indeed been wise of him to have the other person stand guard to wait for Ling Han at the auction grounds. Otherwise, the two of them would only be able to sigh helplessly as they followed Ling Han fruitlessly.

Yet Ling Han knew he would not be able to maintain such speed for long. This was a little like the Ultimate Arrow, though it was not as exaggerated. For a short time, he could burst with a terrifyingly fast speed, and he could maintain this kind of high speed more or less for about six or seven minutes.

And this was taking into account the fact that he had not completely grasped the Star Plucking Step. If he could completely understand the true essence of this movement technique, the burst of speed would be even greater.

Soon enough, Ling Han’s speed had decreased. However, he had already arrived at the foot of the mountain, and the small town had appeared in front of him.

There was just a little bit of distance he had to cover.

“Han Lin, will you still not halt!?” A cold humph sounded, and a Sun Moon Tier elite appeared, standing in Ling Han’s path like a god descended.

“Whether I halt or not, what relation does that have with you?” Ling Han’s figure flashed, intending to make a turn and pass.

“What a joke. I, Yu Si, am standing guard here, and you still think you can pass?” This Sun Moon Tier smirked coldly, stretching out a hand to grab Ling Han. He was in the late stage of the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier. As he delivered this attack, a sun and moon flickered, exuding a terrifying aura.

This was not the Yellow Spring Mystery Realm, where there would be restrictions in place to target power above the level of Sun Moon Tier.

Ling Han clenched his fist, and shot out a punch.

‘What? Are you planning to seek death?’ Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Yu Si was internally surprised. A mere Mountain River Tier would actually dare oppose a Sun Moon Tier; where had he gotten such outlandish courage from? He gave a humph, yet still drew back some of his power to avoid killing Ling Han with a single blow.

As long as his crime was not proved and he himself sentenced, Ling Han would be a seed of the Majestic Heaven Sect. Yu Si could only “invite” him back for the trial. If he crippled Ling Han or even killed him, then he would have to pay a corresponding price for his actions.

A fist landed on the giant descending palm, and suddenly, a frightening shock wave was generated. Peng, peng, peng, peng. The mountain rocks around them were all shattered by the force.

An expression of disbelief appeared on Yu Si’s face. Ling Han’s punch... actually blocked his attack!

‘This...! This...! This...!’

“The peak stage of the pinnacle level! You have actually cultivated to the peak stage of the pinnacle level!” His astonishment was indescribable.

The pinnacle level belonged to the territory of king tiers, but even so, it was not every king tier that could cultivate to the peak of the pinnacle level. This was the pinnacle level, and in this cultivation level, every step forward was incredibly difficult to take.

Just how old was Ling Han? Yet, he had already cultivated to the peak stage of the pinnacle level!

Furthermore, the peak stage of the pinnacle level meant that his power could surpass a major tier!

Presently, this brat’s power was equivalent to that of the early stage of the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier. Yu Si was actually in the the late stage of the low extreme, yet because he had feared killing Ling Han with a single strike, he had held back some of his power, causing the power on both sides to actually be more or less equal.

“Haha, no big deal. You do not have to admire me so much,” Ling Han said, smiling.

“Humph, even if you are in the peak stage of the pinnacle level, so what? That is only equivalent to the early stage of the low extreme. I will still be able to easily suppress you!” Yu Si said. That was good too. He could use his full abilities, and needed not worry that he would mistakenly kill Ling Han, implicating himself as well.

He used the power of the Sun Moon Tier, and all the divine patterns on his body lit up, exhibiting his full battle prowess.

“Brat, today I will let you know that the difference between Mountain River Tier and Sun Moon Tier is not merely in terms of power, but also the grasp we have of the Dao of Heaven and Earth!”

Hong, he, too, delivered a punch. The divine patterns interwove densely together, forming a terrifying might.

Ling Han took it head-on, yet was immediately sent flying, blood gushing from all over his body.

He got back up with gritted teeth. The other had spoken true. The Sun Moon Tier was not only stronger than Mountain River Tier in terms of power, but also in the level of comprehension of the Regulations of this heaven and earth. He had cultivated to the peak stage of the pinnacle level, and in theory was only inferior to his opponent by two stars of power, but added with the Regulations of heaven and earth, this gap was extraordinarily wide.

Why was it said that 10 stars of power would be able to match the early stage of the low extreme of Sun Moon Tier? That was because this kind of Sun Moon Tier had just crossed over into this new territory, and their comprehension of the Regulations was more or less equivalent to the peak stage of the pinnacle level.

“Come with me back to the sect obediently to undergo the trial!” Yu Si moved again. He opened his mouth, and spat out a giant brown bird. The bird spread its wings, and flew towards Ling Han.

This was a giant beast. When its wings stretched out, they were 300 meters long, and it was completely covered with divine patterns. This was completely an attack that was formed from the Regulations of heaven and earth.

Ling Han did not take the attack forcefully. He had already tried, and the other’s battle prowess was indeed superior to his. If he took it head-on, he would only be seeking his own suffering.

He began to roam around in battle by using the Star Plucking Step. Though it no longer enabled him to have super speed, he could move in an erratic manner, which did not allow Yu Si to lock on him. Thus, his attack could not possibly exhibit the might that it should have had.

Yu Si, however, was not impatient. Zhu Tianchou should be able to arrive soon. The latter was in the peak stage of the low extreme. He would be able to take Ling Han down single-handedly, what more when joining forces with himself.

He would only have to detain Ling Han, and not allow the latter to go to the auction grounds. He was sure that Ling Han could not possibly have handed over a treasure like the Thousand Source True Fluid to the Mo Clan Establishment ahead of time—who would be able to do so without worrying?

True enough, in a short while, Zhu Tianchou had arrived. His burst of speed was indeed not as fast as Ling Han’s, but its merit was that he could use that kind of speed for a long time. Thus, he had arrived only slightly later than Ling Han.

“Hahaha, let us see where else will you go!” Zhu Tianchou’s face was slightly flushed. He, a powerful elite of the Sun Moon Tier, actually allowed a Mountain River Tier to get away from him; how humiliating!

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “All right, I will follow you two back to the sect.”

Zhu Tianchou and Yu Si suddenly felt uncomfortable, just like they had just thrown a punch into empty air. At first, they had wanted to properly create some difficulties for Ling Han, but who would have thought Ling Han would have been so decisive? However, since Ling Han had not been able to enter the town, he naturally couldn’t have handed the Thousand Source True Fluid over to the Mo Clan Establishment, and they could be considered to have successfully completed their mission.

“Let’s go then!” the two said, their expressions dark.

Ling Han did not look the slightest bit frustrated, causing Yu Si and his companion much confusion. Ling Han’s plans had obviously failed, so why was he still so calm?

They couldn’t see through him.

The trio headed towards the main peak. One elite of the Sun Moon Tier was walking in front and the other walking behind, with Ling Han sandwiched between them. They had condensed their Origin Power, but did not take any action; they would be able to burst out with the strongest blow at any moment to prevent Ling Han from running away.

Yet Ling Han had completely no plans to flee. He smilingly asked, “Are you guys wondering why am I still so calm and serene now that I have completely failed and obviously not handed over the Thousand Source True Fluid to the Mo Clan Establishment?”

Both Yu Si and Zhu Tianchou were internally baffled. This was indeed the source of their confusion, yet these words had come so calmly and leisurely from Ling Han’s mouth, giving them a very bizarre feeling.

“Humph, since you know that you have completely failed, you should obediently hand over the Thousand Source True Fluid. You have to know you are completely incapable of protecting so much divine fluid with your abilities!” Yu Si declared coldly.

Ling Han smiled slightly, and said, “Haha, I know that you have placed my friends and disciple under surveillance. However, in truth, I am merely bait. Now that I have appeared, you would all come to chase after me. Haha, that disciple of mine should have already handed over the goods to the Mo Clan Establishment by now!”
