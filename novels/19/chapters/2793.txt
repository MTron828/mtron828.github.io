2794 Zhuang Feirui

Shi Mengyu was quite excited, and said, “In the past, Senior was the most famous character on the fourth level, being ranked ninth on the general leaderboard for battle merits. Even now, your ranking can still be seen on the general leaderboard. Moreover, you have only been pushed down to the 12th place.”

Zhuang Feirui was surprised. “Only several epochs have passed, and my position has already been forced downwards by three ranks?”

In the past, though he had not been in the fourth level for very long, he was too freakish. He had shockingly charged to the ninth place on the general leaderboard. If it were not for space establishing itself at the time, and that he was forced to battle on the second level, which led to losing the advantage of city defense, causing him to be trapped here, his battle merit would have been even more prominent.

Perhaps he would have already reached first place on the general leaderboard.

Even so, just look at how terrible that battle had been, yet he had still survived. Furthermore, he had even improved further, becoming a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate. With this, one would know just how freakish he was.

Geng Xuandan nodded. “A few more incredibly freakish people have popped up in the recent epoch, such as Lady Lin Youlian, Lord Xin Qihu, and Lord Wu Haoyang, and they have become Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates in just a billion years.”

Zhuang Feirui showed a hint of seriousness. “I truly cannot underestimate them!”

“All right then. We should leave here now,” he said. As a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, as well as the strongest prodigy, he naturally took command of the situation. “However, before that, there are still two things I have to do.

“Firstly, obtain the Heavenly Venerable Seal here.”

Everyone nodded. This was also their main purpose for coming here. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Secondly!” Zhuang Feirui revealed sinister killing intent. “Kill all those surviving dregs of Hysteria’s army!”

Ling Han frowned, and said, “Those anomalies have already gained their own consciousness, and it is impossible that they would continue to work for Hysteria. They can be absorbed into our army, strengthening our forces.”

“Hm?” Zhuang Feirui looked towards Ling Han, showing hints of displeasure. “A mere First Tier actually dares to rebuke me? When I bathed in the blood of war, who knew where you were then!”

With how prodigious he was, countless people had had high hopes for him in the past. In the future, he would surely become a Fifth Tier, and even Sixth Tier or Seventh Tier was not impossible for him to attain.

And now, a puny First Tier junior actually dared to doubt his decision, so how could he not be angered by this?

Throughout these few epochs, he had only been able to hide here, cultivating every day. If his personality was not the slightest bit distorted, it would be strange.

Ling Han shook his head. “You are but a member of the Flaming Frost Realm yourself, so what qualifies you to just decide with a single word?”

“Because I am Zhuang Feirui!” Zhuang Feirui declared coldly, stretching out a hand to grab Ling Han.

Ling Han extended a hand to parry this blow. A shock wave instantly surged out from where their arms clashed, spreading out in all directions. Immediately, a considerable number of people were thrown off their feet.

“Hm?” Zhuang Feirui showed a hint of surprise. Though that was only a careless move, this blow was still not something that a First Tier Heavenly Venerate could parry.

“Quite capable; no wonder you dare act so arrogant in front of me!” He moved again. Boom! This time, the power that he had unleashed was even more frightening than before.

Ling Han’s eyes widened. The force of this attack had actually surpassed the Third Tier!

He quickly channeled a Heavenly Venerable Seal, meeting Zhuang Feirui’s strike.

Peng! Their two hands clashed again.

Ling Han frowned. It might look like he had successfully parried this blow again, but it should be known that Zhuang Feirui had not used any Heavenly Venerable Seals.

In other words… when the other man had been in the First Tier, the Powers of Dimension that he had extracted were definitely no small number. Perhaps it might have been a few, or over a dozen, or even several dozen!

Ling Han no longer felt any surprise. There were actually a large number of prodigies who had successfully broken through in this manner. Ling Han and the Empress were not the only two. However, Ling Han was certain that aside from him, the others should have fused the Powers of Dimension that they had extracted into a core just like the Empress had, and no one had turned themselves into a Genesis World like Ling Han had.

Of course, this large number was in relative terms, only limited to that highest grade of prodigies, and it was possible that there would only be over a dozen in every level.

However, Zhuang Feirui had an absolute advantage in terms of cultivation level, after all. Even if his progress of cultivation at the First Tier was far from comparable to Ling Han’s, he could still use his advantage in cultivation level to claim victory.

“If I want to kill, can you stop me?” Zhuang Feirui attacked repeatedly, every blow domineering.

Ling Han was cold and quiet, merely clashing continuously with Zhuang Feirui.

“If I wish to kill you, how will you be able to escape?” Zhuang Feirui continued, showing extremely powerful confidence.

His power was growing further and further, almost reaching the Fourth Tier.

Ling Han fought with all his power. He was definitely not the type to give up easily.

Everyone shook their head. It was unfortunate. Ling Han’s level of freakishness was definitely not inferior to Zhuang Feirui’s. In fact, it surpassed the latter. However, it could not be helped that the difference in cultivation level between the two of them was too wide.

“I am going to kill you now, and what can you do about it?” Zhuang Feirui had taken the initiative completely. He further unleashed his power, and his battle prowess had already advanced to the Fourth Tier, causing such suppression that even Ling Han was just barely able to defend himself.

“Just a mere First Tier Heavenly Venerate!” Zhuang Feirui spat disdainfully.

He had probably not said much throughout these few epochs. There had just been four of them survivors, so Zhuang Feirui had an extremely intense desire to show his power. After all, he had been the strongest prodigy of his time, and what he hated the most was when others did not obey his commands.

Ling Han was fighting a hard battle. He was not doing this out of stubbornness, because he still had a letter that Chu Hao had given to him. He only had to rip it open, and he would gain a burst of destructive power on the level of the Fifth Tier, which was enough to eliminate Zhuang Feirui.

…Even if there was suppression of power here, the power of a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate should not be affected.

Hence, if the time came for desperate measures, Ling Han would definitely take out the letter to face his enemy, but before this, he still wanted to test out his own power to see how far he could battle Zhuang Feirui.

Zhuang Feirui had really been lonely for too long. His words did not stop at all as he continued to mock Ling Han and insult him so that he could show just how strong he himself was.

The others also gave him face, expressing their admiration for Zhuang Feirui’s battle prowess. After all, he had indeed been the strongest elite of the fourth level all those years ago. Who knew how many people admired him. Now that they saw that he was still alive, and had even advanced to the Fourth Tier under such terrible conditions, they naturally were very impressed.

In comparison, Ling Han’s way of doing things was too independent, and he gave no one any face. Now that he had fallen into a disadvantageous position, there was naturally no one who would help him.

The Empress and his other companions were few and weak, after all. Thankfully, they knew that Ling Han still had a trump card up his sleeve, and were not too anxious.

“Within three moves, I will make you beg to be spared!” Zhuang Feirui declared proudly. He could no longer be bothered to continue dragging things out with Ling Han. A Heavenly Venerable Seal flickered. He was going to suppress Ling Han completely.

Ling Han sighed. Could he really only resort to this? Once the other man went all out, he would have to use that letter from Chu Hao.

Just as Ling Han was about to take out the letter, boom, the heaven and earth trembled harshly again. An indescribable might assailed them, affecting every single one of them.

“Yi, my power is suppressed again.”

“Damn it. The dimension has reestablished itself again. Our power is again suppressed to the First Tier.”

The Second Tier and Third Tier Heavenly Venerates were all muttering in displeasure. Then, they suddenly thought of a possibility, and all of them turned to look at Ling Han.

Peng!

With a battle cry, Ling Han threw out a heavy punch, which landed on Zhuang Feirui’s hand.

As great power surged, Zhuang Feirui was immediately sent flying from the strike. His figure rapidly shrunk in size, and then he crashed into the rock wall above their heads with a boom. His limbs were all spread apart, forming the Chinese character for the word big1.
