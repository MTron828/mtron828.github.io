Chapter 1257: Fighting over the Realm Spirit Stone

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han had heard Rabbit provide a detailed description of Realm Spirit Stones before. Thus, he was able to determine that the stone before him was a Realm Spirit Stone with a single glance. Moreover, it was actually the size of a palm! This was truly astonishing.

Generally speaking, finding a Realm Spirit Stone that was the size of a pinky was already very fortunate. Finding one that was the size of an egg would be extremely fortunate. Now, however, Ling Han had found one that was the size of a palm! Even Heavenly Body Tier elites would be tempted if they saw this.

“If I were you, I definitely wouldn’t pick that up. Instead, I would immediately turn around and leave!” a voice suddenly said. This voice was cold and eerie, and it possessed an overwhelming killing intent.

After leaving the Black Tower, Ling Han had naturally transformed his body to a normal size. He looked toward the source of the sound, only to see a youth standing not too far away from him. His eyes were fixed on the Realm Spirit Stone at his feet.

This person didn’t give him an odd feeling, so he was definitely from the Immortal Realm.

Ling Han couldn’t help but smile, and he asked, “Why?”

“Because I have my eyes on it. You’ll only end up dying if you fight me for it,” the youth said coldly.

“Oh, so you’re trying to steal my things?” Ling Han asked.

The youth sneered in scorn, and said, “This Realm Spirit Stone doesn’t have an owner yet. It’s not in your hands, so how am I stealing your things? Natural treasures are obtained through power!”

Ling Han bent down and picked the Realm Spirit Stone up. He then smiled, and said, “It’s in my hands now. What now?”

The corners of the youth’s mouth twitched in anger. ‘You’re doing this on purpose, aren’t you?’

“Tell me your name. My Thousand Hallucination Saber doesn’t kill the nameless!”

This person was fairly interesting.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “My surname is Ni, and my name is Ba.”

“Ni Ba?” the youth muttered. He couldn’t recall any powerful youth going by this name. However, he suddenly came to a realization after muttering the name a few more times. Didn’t ‘Ni Ba’ mean ‘your dad’?

‘This b*stard! He actually dares to humiliate me!’

“Very well, you even dare to trick me, Yan Jun!” Killing intent surged from the youth’s body. He couldn’t contain his urge to kill any longer.

Ling Han put the Realm Spirit Stone away before saying, “I was just kidding. Young people need to be tolerant and magnanimous. Why the serious expression?”

Shua!

There was a flash, and Yan Jun had already swung his saber at Ling Han. His saber skills were extraordinary, and even the air was torn apart by his slash. A vacuum fissure appeared between him and Ling Han.

Ling Han activated the Star Plucking Step, evading this attack at an incredible speed.

He couldn’t help but sigh in emotion. The secret techniques of the Immortal Phoenix weren’t limited to just Rising From The Ashes. Their speed was also tremendous. In fact, the speed of Immortal Phoenixes and Rocs could be regarded as the quickest in the world. It would be amazing if he could comprehend and achieve such a speed as well.

However, it was a pity that the main focus of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll was on “indestructibility”—this cultivation technique primarily focused on tempering one’s physique and divine sense. The Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll wasn’t outstanding in terms of movement technique and power.

Meanwhile, Yan Jun was astonished by Ling Han’s speed.

He humphed, and said, “No wonder you dare to compete against me. So it turns out that you do have some skills.”

“Seeing as this is the Two Realm Battlefield, I don’t want to kill you,” Ling Han said calmly. “I’ll spare your life so you can battle against the Netherworld beings. However, if you insist on provoking me, I’ll have no option but to send you into the afterlife.”

Yan Jun laughed in fury, and said, “You merely evaded a single strike of mine, yet you actually dare to make such a bold claim? Heh, what an absolute joke!”

Ling Han also laughed, and he said, “If a tiger doesn’t roar, you’ll think I’m an ill cat, huh?”

Bursts of divine light surged from Yan Jun’s body and streaked into his saber.

Peng, peng, peng!

The saber started to pulsate with the sound of a heartbeat, and it was as if it had developed a life of its own.

Ling Han knew that his opponent was charging up for a big attack. However, he didn’t seize this opportunity to attack and disrupt his opponent. Instead, he allowed Yan Jun to charge his attack all he wanted.

Yan Jun was only at the peak stage of the low extreme, which was one sub-minor level above Ling Han. If Ling Han wasn’t confident in defeating such an opponent, he would be far too trashy.

“Arrogant! You’re truly arrogant!” Yan Jun shouted. After absorbing countless bursts of divine light, a black mist started to rise from the saber in his hand. The sight of this was extremely strange. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

His opponent clearly knew that he was charging up for a big attack, yet he still didn’t seize the opportunity to attack him or disrupt him. He was far too arrogant.

He lunged at Ling Han, and roared, “You’re going to pay a bloody price for underestimating me!”

Weng!

His saber swung forward, and it surprisingly released a ferocious black beast. It was unclear what this beast was—it looked a bit like a tiger, yet it had the tail of a fish.

The ferocious beast widened its maws and bit at Ling Han. The inside of its mouth was pitch-black, and it was as if it could swallow everything in the world.

Ling Han didn’t retreat. Instead, he clenched his hand into a fist and delivered a punch at the ferocious beast. Countless divine patterns intertwined, eventually forming a boundless streak of light.

Peng!

The ferocious beast was instantly sent flying. It transformed back into a streak of saber light that gradually shattered into pieces in the air.

Yan Jun was stunned. This was his most powerful strike, and the Thousand Hallucination Saber in his hand had magnified the might of his attack manyfold. However, his opponent had shattered his attack with a casual, ordinary punch. His opponent... was far too powerful!

He immediately released a long howl. Sound waves surged into the surroundings, and under the influence of his Origin Power, they raced in all directions at a speed much quicker than normal.

It wasn’t long before howls of reply traveled over from the distance. Moreover, it wasn’t just one howl. Rather, there was a wave of howls.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “What’s this? You can’t defeat me, so you’re calling for reinforcements?”

Yan Jun couldn’t help but flush in embarrassment. He was a proud person, and he had always believed that he was at least second—if not first—among those of his age group. However, he had come across a powerful enemy that he couldn’t defeat right after entering the Two Realm Battlefield.

Not only that, but his opponent was even one sub-minor level below him!

If this were a fight over nothing, his pride would definitely have him turn around and leave. However, their fight involved the ownership of a palm-sized Realm Spirit Stone! Just how valuable was it?

Thus, he cast aside his shame, and called for reinforcements.

After a short while, five people arrived from different directions at almost exactly the same time. Their cultivation levels ranged from the low extreme to the high extreme; four of them were male, while only one of them was female.

“What’s wrong, Junior Brother Yan?” the five people asked. The howl that Yan Jun had unleashed just then was an emergency signal of the Blazing Inferno Sect.

Yan Jun pointed at Ling Han, and said, “There’s a Realm Spirit Stone on him, and it’s as large as a palm!”

The five people were astonished and delighted upon hearing this.

One of the more senior men cupped his hands in salute, and said, “This brother over here, can you please give the Realm Spirit Stone to us? The Blazing Inferno Sect will definitely compensate you well.”

Ling Han smiled, and said, “You want me to give you the Realm Spirit Stone in exchange for an empty promise?”

The six people exchanged a glance, a hint of delight on their faces. Judging by Ling Han’s attitude, it seemed as if there was room for discussion.

“Brother, name a price,” the man said.

Ling Han pondered for a moment before saying, “Easy, I’ll exchange it for True Origin Stones or Godly metal.”

To him, Realm Spirit Stones were merely a form of wealth. Thus, he naturally didn’t mind selling it to others.

“No problem, no problem!” the man said hurriedly. He then hesitated briefly before asking, “Brother, can I please see the size of the Realm Spirit Stone for myself?”
