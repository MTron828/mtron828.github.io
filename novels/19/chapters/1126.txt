Chapter 1127: Principles

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

‘How unreserved!

‘You’re the mighty empress, so how can your willpower be so weak?’

Ling Han’s heart thumped against his chest. She was a stunning beauty who could hook a man’s heart with her flawless figure with a single glance. Back when he hadn’t seen her face yet, the image of her figure would still drift into his mind from time to time.

Now, however, she was actually throwing herself at him. Moreover, she even allowed him to witness her true appearance. How tempting was this?

Ling Han tried to resist, yet his hands involuntarily grabbed her voluptuous breasts again.

‘F*ck! Why did I place my hands there?!

‘It must be because they’re too big a target. I reached over without even knowing...

‘So big! So erect! So soft! So bouncy!’

Ling Han gulped with great difficulty. He was finally able to experience the amazing sensations this time.

He shook his head vigorously. Now wasn’t the time to think of such matters!

Rip!

The empress couldn’t contain herself any longer, and she started to rip off more of Ling Han’s clothes.

‘F*ck! F*ck! F*ck!’

Ling Han cursed in his mind. His body flashed, and he disappeared into the Black Tower.

A dazed look flashed across Empress Luan Xing’s eyes as Ling Han’s body suddenly vanished from her embrace. Her reactions were slightly sluggish under the effects of her lust. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Huh?” The Notionless Saint’s voice sounded again, and he said, “Spatial God Tool? It can’t be... Even if he hid into a Spatial God Tool, the Spatial God Tool itself shouldn’t have disappeared.”

‘As expected! That old geezer didn’t leave!’

Ling Han grumbled in the Black Tower. Then, he felt a strong urge to slap himself across the face.

A stunning beauty had actively thrown herself at him, yet he had actually hidden in the Black Tower?!

Did he have any feelings for Empress Luan Xing?

Ling Han had to admit that this empress’ charm was already transcendent above everything else. Even his heart would thump in excitement every time he saw her. Yet, he had actually fled from her embrace just like that? Just thinking about this made him feel like he was a hypocrite. He clearly lusted after her, so why was he acting like a saint?

‘I’m not acting like a saint. It’s just that... I’ll feel guilt and regret if I take her like that.

‘Moreover, my aim is to reach the pinnacle of cultivation. If there are any weaknesses in my mind, I’ll definitely be affected when I’m trying to comprehend the Heavenly Dao in the future. Perhaps it might even lead to my death.

‘My principle is to retain a clear conscience. As such, there’s a line that I simply can’t cross.’

With this in mind, his emotions gradually settled down. It was also because of this reason that he chose to expose the secret of the Black Tower rather than to cave in facing his lust and tangle with Empress Luan Xing.

Small Tower suddenly appeared beside him, and said, “You can tell that person that I have a way to reincarnate him.”

Ling Han was dazed for a moment. Then, he almost jumped up in anger, shouting, “Why didn’t you tell me earlier!”

He had been trapped in this place for almost two years!

“Firstly, you didn’t ask. Secondly, you didn’t enter the Black Tower, either. I thought you were enjoying your time with that empress and didn’t want to leave,” Small Tower said calmly.

‘This dude!’ Ling Han muttered in his mind.

However, he couldn’t help but reflect on his actions. He had remained especially “honest” these two years. Was he satisfied with his current situation due to Empress Luan Xing’s irresistible charm?

He was astonished upon realizing this. The empress’ charm was far too incredible! It was so strong that he had been affected without even knowing it!

Ling Han collected his thoughts, and said, “That old geezer only has a wisp of his soul remaining. Moreover, he refined his own divine sense and brought himself closer to death. However, you’re saying that you can still save him?”

“Correct.” Small Tower had always been frank with its words. It said, “The Reincarnation Tree can help him maintain the last remnants of his soul. Moreover, when you unlock the next level of the Black Tower, he’ll be able to gather the power of the five elements and forge a Five Element Body.”

“Five Element Body? That sounds so badass,” Ling Han said.

“Tell him that forging the Five Element Body is an act going against the heavens. It’ll cause his Immortal Tribulation to occur 10 times as often.”

“Immortal Tribulation?” Ling Han asked.

“Am I obligated to answer all of your questions?” Small Tower rebutted. Then, it answered its own question, and said, “No! So, don’t waste any more of my precious time. I have to continue repairing the Black Tower. If it weren’t for the fact that I need you to become more powerful, I wouldn’t even come out to speak to you!

“Sigh, what a troublesome master. I need to take care of everything for him.”

Its body slowly became transparent and disappeared as it spoke.

“F*ck! Have you ever treated me like your master?” Ling Han mumbled.

He calmed down and collected his thoughts.

Xiu!

He exited the Black Tower with a flash.

“Mmm...” A seductive moan traveled into his ears, and he was immediately pulled into Empress Luan Xing’s embrace. This empress hadn’t activated her divine patterns while embracing him just then—in other words, she hadn’t restrained him using her martial intent—and it was because of this that he had been able to hide in the Black Tower.

However, her divine patterns were activated this time, and Ling Han was genuinely restrained.

“Sh*tty senior, don’t you want to take revenge?” he frantically shouted. “Don’t you want to return to the Genesis Tier? You saw just then, didn’t you? I also have astonishing secrets. I can help you forge a Five Element Body! However, the problem is that you’ll have to face the Immortal Tribulation 10 times more often!”

“What?!” There was a hint of pure shock in Notionless Saint’s voice, and he said emotionally, “Brat, is what you say true?!”

If he could live on, and if he could take revenge with his own two hands, why would he still refine his own fruits of cultivation in preparation for someone else?

“Of course it’s true! Release the technique on her first!” Ling Han shouted.

“Hehe, you really are one strange lad,” the Notionless Saint commented. “Fine, I’m interested to hear about your idea.”

Pa!

Empress Luan Xing suddenly stopped moving. However, she also lost all of her strength, and she immediately collapsed into Ling Han’s lap.

Ling Han had been busy trying to free himself from her embrace when she had been taking initiative just then. Now that she fell silent, he was able to clearly feel just how soft, just how hot, and just how supple her body was.

His mouth instantly became dry as a primal urge welled up inside him.

His feelings at this moment proved the saying to be true—a concubine was better than a wife, a lover was better than a concubine, and an unattainable lover was better than an attainable lover 1 !

He had rejected her when she had opened herself up to him, and now that it was all over, his heart became itchy with desire.

Ling Han hurriedly took a deep breath. He drew on all his willpower to place Empress Luan Xing aside, and he said, “Sh*tty senior, I’ll bring you to a place. Don’t resist.”

“Nonsense. I can forge Spatial God Tools myself, so of course I understand this concept,” Notionless Saint said. “However, the remnants of my soul have suppressed underground this entire time. It was suppressed using the power of heaven, and once it becomes exposed, I’ll be left with only two options—fuse it into someone else’s body, or have it dissipate and vanish. It’s impossible for my soul to return underground.

“So, you’d better not be lying to me. Otherwise, I’ll definitely kill you before I vanish!”

Ling Han waved his hand, and said, “Don’t worry, don’t worry. I won’t give you any reason to kill me.”

“Very well, I’m coming out now!” Notionless Saint was a decisive person, and the columns in the tower instantly lit up. A ball of white light hovered into Ling Han’s vision.

Ling Han released his divine sense and wrapped it around this ball of light.

Xiu!

He entered the Black Tower with the white ball of light.
