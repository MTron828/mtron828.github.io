Chapter 2072: Laying a Trap

Ling Han also strode forward, advancing side by side with Ji Wuming.

“Today marks the death of you two!” Zhu Huiyun said. She launched a vicious punch, obliterating an attacking black figure.

Although these black figures couldn’t be killed, the more comprehensively they were ripped apart, the longer it would take them to reform. Of course, this “long time” was only a few seconds.

The black figures rapidly reformed. Meanwhile, Ling Han and Ji Wuming drew closer and closer to Zhu Huiyun.

Xiu, xiu!

At this moment, two figures suddenly charged out from behind the boulder, with both of them dashing toward Ji Wuming. At the same time, Zhu Huiyun also leaped forward, with her sword slashing down at Ji Wuming.

The two figures who had charged out from behind the boulder were none other than Yu Huaqing and Tian Qingyue.

Sure enough, this was a trap. The two supreme monarch tiers had used some kind of technique to conceal their auras, preventing even Ling Han’s divine sense from discovering them. It was as if they hadn’t existed.

At this moment, they were launching a deadly attack, aiming to kill Ji Wuming who possessed relatively weak defenses.

This was an extremely suitable plan. As long as they killed Ji Wuming first, Ling Han wouldn’t be able to do anything. His powerful defenses would do him no good.

Ling Han humphed as he stepped forward to block these attacks for Ji Wuming.

“We’ve been waiting for you!” Tian Qingyue suddenly said with a smile. She waved her right hand, tossing forth a jade vial that instantly grew dozens of times larger. The jade vial fell toward Ling Han like a net.

Peng!

The jade vial landed, and Ling Han also disappeared.

“Kill!” Tian Qingyue and the others roared as they charged at Ji Wuming. They all unleashed their full battle prowess.

“Oh? Xu Lan’s Treasured Tranquility Vial?” Ji Wuming said in a calm voice as he glanced at the jade vial. His feet remained unmoving, and he didn’t choose to face the three monarch tiers head-on.

They were three supreme monarch tiers, after all, so even he couldn’t face them head-on. Otherwise, he would simply be seeking death.

Tian Qingyue and the others had laid a trap. Even though their target was still Ji Wuming, Ling Han was the first person they had to deal with. Thus, they used a treasure to temporarily remove him from the battle.

“Oh, it isn’t the Treasured Tranquility Vial. It’s merely a replica that can only be used once,” Ji Wuming said with a nod. Even though he was surrounded by three supreme monarch tiers, he showed absolutely no signs of fear.

He had truly witnessed this kind of scene many times before. When fighting against the storm of darkness, he had even been surrounded and attacked by several elites who had cultivation equivalent to that of Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. In the end, however? They had all been violently killed by him.

He responded to whatever the supreme monarch tiers threw at him, shifting his feet as he calmly navigated between their attacks.

Tian Qingyue and the others wore expressions of pure astonishment. This wasn’t because Ji Wuming had recognized their treasure as a replica of the Treasured Tranquility Vial. Instead, it was because he had directly spoken the title of Celestial King Xu Lan.

This was the esteemed title of a Celestial King! Was it something that a measly Dividing Soul Tier cultivator could utter? Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

This was unforgivable disrespect!

Regardless of how outstanding a prodigy was, and regardless of how haughty they were, they all had to show utmost respect when they mentioned Celestial Kings.

“You actually dare to blatantly utter the name of a Celestial King? How audacious!” Tian Qingyue said in a baleful voice.

However, Ji Wuming didn’t pay this any heed. In reality, the large majority of the current Celestial Kings were his juniors. If they knew of his true identity, they would all pay utmost respect to him. There were Nine Heavens for Celestial Kings, and each succeeding Heaven was unbelievably difficult to reach. Before a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings were naturally juniors.

Celestial King Xu Lan was only an Eighth Heaven Celestial King, so in Ji Wuming’s eyes, they naturally weren’t worth mentioning.

“Enough with the nonsense. He’s simply trying to buy time!” Yu Huaqing said in a cold voice.

“That’s right. Kill him!”

The three supreme monarch tiers all unleashed powerful attacks in unison. They wanted to kill Ji Wuming as quickly as possible.

After all, the Treasured Tranquility Vial was only a replica, so it definitely couldn’t trap Ling Han for too long.

However, Ji Wuming remained calm as he continued to eerily weave through their attacks. It was as if he had completely disappeared from this space, with none of the attacks being able to hit and injure him.

“Regulations of Space!” the three supreme monarch tiers exclaimed in astonishment. Their eyes were filled with shock.

The Regulations of Space were transcendent above the Regulations of the Five Elements. Moreover, cultivating this Regulation was also incredibly difficult. This was because one had to obtain Void Herbs or similar Celestial medicines if they wanted to comprehend this Regulation. If one couldn’t even obtain such items, how could they hope to obtain the secrets of this Regulation?

Right now, Ji Wuming could dodge their attacks simply by performing a movement technique. This was evidence that he already had a comprehensive grasp of the Regulations of Space.

How had he cultivated this?

Such fortune was truly enough to make one’s eyes go green with envy.

However, the three supreme monarch tiers didn’t feel deflated. Instead, they increased the ferocity of their attacks.

Even though the Regulations of Space were indeed transcendent above the Regulations of the Five Elements, one still needed to consider one’s grasp over these Regulations. After all, it was impossible that 100 points worth of Regulation of Wood couldn’t defeat 10 points worth of Regulations of Space.

Thus, they could naturally shatter Ji Wuming’s Regulations of Space as long as they increased the ferocity of their attacks. As the saying went, brute force could shatter all techniques.

Sure enough, when the power of their attacks reached a certain level, Ji Wuming’s movements started to become slightly disorganized. This was a result of his Regulations of Space being damaged.

However, Ji Wuming didn’t seem to care about this. He held his hands flat, with one hand connecting to the past and one hand controlling the future. It was as if he existed in the past, yet it was also as if he existed in the future. His figure was ethereal, and it couldn’t be captured.

“Regulations of Time!”

Tian Qingyue and the others became even more shocked. So be it if Ji Wuming had only mastered the Regulations of Space, yet he had even mastered the Regulations of Time?

Regardless of whether it was space or time, neither of these Regulations could be practiced at will. One had to first obtain the corresponding Celestial medicine. Moreover, to reach Ji Wuming’s level of mastery, the amount of Celestial medicine needed was definitely astonishing. In fact, it was definitely enough to make most Celestial Kings draw a sharp breath.

Not only did they need to be powerful enough, but they also needed to have lived for long enough. Otherwise, even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings couldn’t reach such a level.

This person… Just who in the world was he?

Peng!

At this moment, a palm imprint suddenly appeared on the surface of the Treasured Tranquility Vial. There was a flurry of banging sounds, and more and more palm imprints started to appear. At the same time, these imprints also became deeper and deeper.

“Hurry! He’s about to shatter the treasure and escape!”

“We have 10 strikes at most! We definitely have to dispose of this person!”

“Unleash your trump cards!”

Tian Qingyue and the others were extremely panicked. Ling Han was about to escape, so they definitely had to kill Ji Wuming as soon as possible. Otherwise, the tables would turn, and they would have no more hope of victory.

“Crescent Moon Shining Through the Ages!” Tian Qingyue roared. He was the first to respond, with a bright moon immediately materializing behind her. This moon was as limpid and cool as water, and there was an incomplete ancient character on its body. This character instantly lit up, causing the radiance of the moon to become even more brilliant.

When the moonlight struck Ji Wuming, his body immediately froze, and he was unable to move anymore.

“Purple Blade Divine Sword!” Zhu Huiyun roared. She also unleashed her trump card, drawing a purple Divine Sword from the crown of her head. This wasn’t a true Celestial Tool, but rather a Divine Sword that had been formed from her divine sense.

Divided souls didn’t necessarily have to take the form of a human. In fact, they could also take the form of all kinds of weapons. However, this was extremely rare.

Zhu Huiyun’s gaze was piercing. After she thrust her sword down, she would detonate this divided soul, and instantly raise her battle prowess by 10 times or even 100 times. This would unleash a devastating destructive power.

At this moment, Yu Huaqing also struck his own chest.

Boom!

A pair of wings materialized on his back, and numerous symbols lit up at the same time. This caused his battle prowess to rise to an astonishing height.

Ji Wuming chuckled upon seeing this. “Maha Kasyapa, myriad Buddhas…”

He started to recite the names of Buddhas, and the symbol “卐” materialized on his forehead. Boundless golden light shone down upon him, enveloping his entire body.

Peng, peng, peng!

The attacks of the three supreme monarch tiers arrived, yet they were all blocked by the brilliant golden light. At this moment, Ji Wuming was like a Golden Buddha, undying and indestructible.
