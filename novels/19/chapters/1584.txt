Chapter 1585: An unexpected helper

“Since he has committed murder, what else is there left to say? Apprehend him!” an unfamiliar Black Demon exclaimed. He was a member of the Gou Clan, and belonged to the conservative party.

“Wait!” A voice rang out, and Gu Feng actually stepped out, and stood in front of Ling Han, looking like he was about to confront the few Black Demons head-on. “Seniors, this matter should be discussed further. Though Ling Han has indeed overstepped his boundaries slightly, it was also because these three people have bullied him intolerably.”

Everyone was astonished. They had not thought that someone would actually stand up and speak on Ling Han’s behalf at this moment.

Could it be that this guy was a rash fool?

The Heaven Demons were arguing with each other, and you actually dared interfere; who did you think you were? Was it just anyone that could become an envoy of justice? Were you even qualified to uphold justice?

“Humph, we are enforcing the rules here, step aside!” the Black Demon from the Gou Clan said. He flicked his sleeve, appearing to be slightly displeased.

However, Gu Feng was a Demon Master as well. Though he was weaker than him, he had to give him some face after all.

Yet Gu Feng was very stubborn, and he insisted, “Ling Han has to be punished, but his crime does not deserve death. Please have mercy, Seniors!”

Everyone was even more confused. They did not see that he had any friendship with Ling Han, so why would he protect him at this time? Could it be that they had an unknown relationship between them that could not be exposed to others?

Even Ling Han was slightly confused. If Gu Feng had been the Rain Emperor, Feng Po Yun, Empress Luan Xing, or Hu Niu, then he would not be confused at all, because them helping him would be due to their brotherhood, or because they were husband and wife.

But Gu Feng? In fact, he only knew the other’s name.

“Step aside, or you will be suppressed alongside him!” the Black Demon from the Gou Clan stated coldly. He belonged to the conservative party in the first place, and was filled with negative feelings for those not belonging to a Forbidden Land. Since he has already given the other face, but he did not want to accept, then he shouldn’t blame him for being merciless.

Did he really think that he did not dare make a move?

Gu Feng showed a conflicted expression, his hands clenched tightly into fists, yet just when everyone thought he was about to give up, he shook his head resolutely, and exclaimed, “I will not!”

Such nerve!

Just exactly were you aiming for? The two of them did not have any deep relations between them, yet he still took the risk of himself possibly being suppressed. This was practically absolutely baffling. Could it be that there was really such an idealistic person in this world that would not hesitate to attempt the impossible for the sake of righteousness?

“Humph, then we will apprehend you as well!” the Black Demon from the Gou Clan exclaimed coldly.

“Gu Feng!” Ling Han called out from behind, communicating a message through divine sense. “Later I will wrap my divine sense around you, make sure you do not resist.”

A strange look flickered in Gu Feng’s eyes, as well as a sliver of resistance, yet he still nodded.

Ling Han took a few steps forwards, and laughed loudly. “We’ll end things here today. Take a message from me: have that old geezer from the Tan Clan come here personally, and I will come out to meet him. Otherwise, you will never find me for the rest of your lives!”

“Where else do you think you can hide?” The Black Demon from the Gou Clan moved, and grabbed out at Ling Han, yet he had just raised his hand when he shockingly discovered that Ling Han had vanished.

It was as if he had turned into empty air, and had completely disappeared.

Not only Ling Han, even Gu Feng had disappeared!

“Eh?” All the Demon Masters were stunned—where was he?

“There is no wave caused by tearing of space, so he definitely had not left via using a Teleportation Seal.”

“A Spatial God Tool!”

The Demon Masters soon confirmed that. A few of them immediately smirked coldly. What a real joke. Did he think that just because he hid inside his Spatial God Tool, they would not be able to do anything to him? They were Demon Masters here, and they themselves were capable of creating Spatial God Tools, yet he wanted to pull a bluff on them?

Such ignorance.

They released their divine sense, and began to search for this Spatial God Tool. However, their expressions became gradually grimmer and uglier.

They could not find it, no matter where they searched.

How could this be possible?

The Demon Masters all exchanged looks, and could see the surprise in each other’s eyes.

Where was the Spatial God Tool?

“This is definitely no Spatial God Tool!”

“But what kind of treasure would be able to take in a living being, yet not reveal any traces?”

“Gasp!”

They inhaled sharply at the same time. “A Celestial Tool!”

That was a Celestial Tool, something that not even a Celestial King might possess, and those that did possess it would definitely be big shots among the Celestial Kings.

“In the great turmoil all those years ago, some Celestial Kings had fallen, and there were even some supreme Celestial Kings that stood at the seventh or eight heaven among them. Then, it would be possible for the boy to have obtained a Celestial Tool.”

“That’s right; it must be because he has obtained the treasure trove of a Celestial King, and learnt a Celestial King technique that allowed him to merge the Regulations of the two Realms. FUrthermore, he also possesses a Celestial Tool!’

“We have to find him!”

Those Black Demons were all filled with jealousy. Even Ye Chengzhang and Zheng Jing who had initially been on Ling Han’s side were restless. In view of a Celestial King technique and a Celestial Tool, even they could not control their greed.

Yet, how could they actually manage to find the Black Tower?

What wishful thinking!

After searching for a few days, they had no choice but to give up, report this piece of news to their superiors, and ask for stronger characters to be mobilized. However, even if Earth Demons and Heaven Demons came, so what? They only stood at the apex of divine dao, so how could they possibly discover the profound secrets of a Celestial item?

Ouyang Taishan also came. He flew into a thunderous rage, and exclaimed, “So this was why you all drew me over to Moon Wolf Planet. It wasn’t because someone was stuck inside a Mystery Realm, but rather because you all wanted to make a move on Ling Han!”

“Who is it? Step out! Who came up with such a vile scheme?!”

The few Heaven Demons looked at one another, and one of them said, “Brother Taishan, there is no need for you to be too excited. As the saying goes, all natural treasures of the heaven and earth should be possessed by those of virtue, and that brat is only a mere ant, so what right does he have to possess the precious treasures of a Celestial King?”

Ouyang Taishan’s eyes were extraordinarily cold, and a silvery river appeared behind him. It was densely covered with innumerable stars that were exuding a brilliant light, while he himself was also emitting a frightening aura. It was as if the whole Mystery Realm would crumble with a slight tremble from him.

This was absolutely possible. The Genesis Tier stood at the apex of divine dao, and had absolute destructive power in this realm.

“And you all have virtue?” he questioned disdainfully, furious to the extreme.

“Hoho, the incident has already happened, so what need is there to deliberate about this further?” A Heaven Demon stepped out as a peacemaker. “What is important now is to make that brat come out. After all, the matter of entering into the Celestial Realm is still left on his shoulders.”

Ouyang Taishan was already speechless with fury. You all treated him like this, and would now delude yourselves into thinking that Ling Han would assist you in merging the two Realms?

“To be fair, that brat is indeed unqualified to possess the inheritance of a Celestial King. This is something that belongs to us, the remaining residents of the Celestial Realm! However, since it was that brat that obtained the treasure trove of the Celestial King, we can allow him to cultivate the Celestial King technique as well, but he must hand over the Celestial Tool!” another Heaven Demon declared.

This was completely ridiculous. It was they that wanted to snatch what belonged to Ling Han, yet they put up a pretence of being generous, and allowed Ling Han to cultivate a Celestial King technique as if they had granted him an insurmountable kindness.

Ouyang Taishan didn’t even want to speak anymore. He had made his decision. As long as Ling Han appeared, he would take him away from this place. He was the one who had brought Ling Han to this place, and he naturally would bring him out of this place completely unharmed.

The Heaven Demons all exchanged looks and nodded. One of them moved unnoticeably, and had already sealed Ouyang Taishan’s movements, not allowing him to make any move to interfere.

As a Heaven Demon himself, and furthermore, one that had cultivated to the pinnacle, he still had that much confidence to accomplish that.

“Ask Old Geezer Tan to come over. Though it is possible that the brat was speaking false words, we can still make an attempt!”
