Chapter 1923: Accidental injury

Though Yan Xianlu was very wary of the young girl’s strength, in the face of a supreme fortune, how could he stand aside?

“Miss, who are you?” Yan Xianlu was the first to move. From the very beginning, he had not planned to allow anyone else to have the great fortune granted by the Celestial King. This was meant to be his, and the only reason why he had widely invited the prodigies in the world was just to stimulate a resonance from the heaven and earth of this place.

Of course, it was also for an important matter that he was currently plotting.

This time, Yan Xianlu no longer stayed on the defense. With him actively moving to attack, his battle prowess became even stronger. All the strands of his black hair actually became gradually transparent, turning into streaks of aura of great dao, his whole person becoming incredibly ethereal.

He had a Celestial Dao Physique!

Both Shan Jitong and Lao Song paled in shock. They already knew how strong Yan Xianlu was. In fact, it was highly possible that even with the two of them working together, they were still no match for him. However, after he actively drew on the power of his Divine Fetus, only then did they realize just how wide the gap was between him and them.

So it turned out that this was Yan Xianlu’s true strength.

Their Dao Hearts suffered a blow, but they immediately recovered their confidence.

No matter how strong his power of Divine Fetus was, it only allowed Yan Xianlu to have an advantage before the Celestial King Tier, but once he became a Celestial King, all Regulations would be equal, and it would depend on who had a stronger grasp of Regulations, and used their Regulations better.

Clearly, without a unique opportunity, it would be very difficult for them to catch up to Yan Xianlu in terms of battle prowess before the Celestial King Tier, but it should be known that the Celestial King Tier was the true starting line for monarch tiers like them.

So what if you could smile for now? What was most important was the person who could laugh last.

...It was not like there were no such cases in this world. Some prodigy would shine for a moment, invincible among his peers from the Severing Mundane Tier all the way to the Ascending Origin Tier, but after becoming a Celestial King, he was stagnant on First Heaven, not even managing to advance into Second Heaven.

For such a Celestial King, no matter how awesome his battle prowess was in a battle of equals, would he be able to match a third heaven Celestial King?

However, from the look of things now, Yan Xianlu was definitely invincible. If there was anyone left in this world that could match him, it was really hard for them to imagine what they would be like, and to speak of surpassing Yan Xianlu?

That was even more impossible. This should be power that was truly invincible in the Severing Mundane Tier. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Peng!

They had not even finished that thought when they saw the young girl had already rushed over like a primeval beast, without dodging or evading—she just simply rampaged over. Then, with a wave of the young girl’s fist, Yan Xianlu was sent flying.

He flew, he flew, he flew...

Even someone as strong as Yan Xianlu was actually no match for her?

The mouths of Shan Jitong and Lao Song gaped widely, big enough to fit an egg. Their faces bore expressions of utter shock. How could this be possible!

No, no, no, it was not that there was really such a huge gap between Yan Xianlu and the young girl, but rather that this young girl belonged to the power category, and in a head-on confrontation, she was incomparably domineering and fierce.

Even so, they could still tell how strong this young girl was, she was practically... heaven-defying!

And then, the two of them felt gloomy.

That was because the young girl did not even pause, and rushed towards them. Without the slightest bit of reservation, she treated them like foes she had to crush. Peng, peng, and it was another two punches.

They hurriedly stretched out an arm to parry, but only felt the surging of a frightening force, as if the young girl was not a human being, but rather a most ancient Source Beast. When the force of her power surged past, they were involuntarily sent flying as well.

F***, why did she beat them? What did they do?

The young girl stormed over, and behind her was the terrifying army of manifestations. Their numbers were so high that even though Yan Xianlu and the others had suffered a little, they dared not chase the young girl for revenge.

...If they wanted revenge, they would have to get through the army of manifestations first. Just ask, who would dare fight so many enemies that were equal in cultivation level to them head-on?

The Dao Achieving Stone of the Celestial King!

Yan Xianlu and the others all looked depressed. After so much difficulty, they had finally made it here, yet their great opportunity was actually snatched away by a mysterious young girl.

They felt great resentment.

But when the young girl rushed over, she directly ignored that Celestial stone. Instead, she continued to run forwards, and arrived at the peak’s summit. This was already the absolute summit, and there were only white hazy clouds and fog in the surrounding, not a single person or object in sight.

‘What on earth is going on?’

Yan Xianlu and the others were once again dumbfounded. What was going on with this young girl? You had already sent the three of them flying, yet completely ignored the Celestial stone? Was this a mockery of them?

“Ling Han! Ling Han!” The young girl cupped her hands at both sides of her mouth, calling out loudly at the top of the peak.

This naturally was Hu Niu, but now that she had stopped, countless manifestations immediately caught up with her. Like thirsty horses drinking from a stream, they all pounced at her. Multiple figures flew forwards, instantly submerging her in their numbers.

Yan Xianlu and the others were repeatedly numbed with shock, rendered incoherent with their astonishment, and completely deranged.

Was there something wrong with you?

Though you were indeed very strong, and it was very possible that not even Yan Xianlu was a match for you, but still, having so many manifestations attack you at once, even 10 Yan Xianlu would probably be thrashed and devastated.

How would you be able to block that?

And you actually still stopped. They really didn’t know what to say at this point.

You managed to reach the fifth severance even with such intelligence or the lack thereof, and you were actually a top-tier monarch tier at that?

This was practically dragging down their standards.

Boom!

Yet just at this moment, a streak of light shot out from within the ball formed by manifestations. Then, a second streak, a third streak, and in an instant, it had become millions and millions of streaks of light. An endless might reverberated. Peng, all the manifestations were sent flying, and were then reduced to dust by the streaks of light.

Hu Niu reappeared. Clapping her hands, she appeared to be slightly displeased. “Niu hasn’t found Ling Han yet, and is currently unhappy, and you guys actually dare come to cause trouble, how despicable!”

Her eyes swept over the surroundings, ferocity flickering in her eyes.

The look caused the hearts of Yan Xianlu and the others to jolt. They felt an urge to dodge.

But how could a monarch tier lose his fighting spirit?

All three of them were unafraid, and engaged in a staring contest with Hu Niu.

Hu Niu was furious, and demanded, “You guys looking at Niu like this, are you asking for a fight?”

Instantly, Yan Xianlu and the others were speechless. ‘You were the one glaring at us, all right? How can you say that now?’

However, what was the technique that the young girl had used just now? She had actually destroyed all the manifestations in an instant. This was too ruthless, wasn’t it? Even a Yang soul, or even Yin soul elite could not possibly do that, right? Earth soul might barely be capable of it, and only a Heaven soul could crush his opponents with a flip of his hand.

This young girl was clearly only a fifth severance, yet possessed the battle prowess of a Heaven soul?

Impossible!

They admitted that Hu Niu was very strong, but they definitely did not think that her battle prowess could be so high. It had to be that Hu Niu had used some kind of rare treasure.

“Yi, this seems like a valuable treasure!” Hu Niu looked at the Celestial stone on the ground, and her eyes immediately shone. Pa, pa, pa. She ran towards the Celestial stone. “Not bad, not bad. I can give this to Ling Han as a gift!”

“Miss!” Yan Xianlu could not help but speak up. “This does not belong to you yet!”

“You people want to snatch Niu’s belongings?” Niu turned to look at the three of them, the violence in her eyes clear to see, as if she was a tigress that was protecting her food.

Shan Jitong and Lao Song were definitely about to experience a mental breakdown because whatever others did, in the end, they would definitely be treated the same by Hu Niu.

Previously, they had clearly not been blocking the way, yet they had still been sent flying with a punch. And now, they clearly did not say anything, yet were still injured accidentally by Hu Niu.

They were really too innocent.
