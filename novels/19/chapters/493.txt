Chapter 494: Last Resort

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

“The Indestructible True Fluid is only effective for those cultivating the Indestructible Heaven Scroll; even if you took it out, its effects would reduce drastically,” Small Tower said indifferently.

“Reduce drastically, but still effective, righty?” Ling Han’s gaze brightened.

“Yes, this is a treasured medicine for the human body extracted by the Indestructible Heaven Scroll. Its effects are the best for oneself, and second for others cultivating Indestructible Heaven Scroll, as for others, the effects will decrease by a hundred times.” Small Tower still said dully.

“As long as it’s useful!”

Ling Han was the Grandmaster of alchemy. He forcibly added five drops of the Indestructible True Fluid to the White Phoenix Water True Pill’s recipe. This was also the total amount he could extract... he’d had just consumed one drop to save himself.

In only half an hour, he refined the pill. There was just one that condensed five drops of Indestructible True Fluid’s essence, possessing amazing recovery effect.

“Last resort!” Ling Han fed the pill to Zhu Xuan Er. But she was already near death, her jaw tightly shut, so how could she take it in?

Ling Han tore off her veil and pried open her jaw, shoved the medicinal pill inside, and then poured down some diluted spiritual liquid. The medicinal was inside her mouth, but it couldn’t seem to be swallowed.

“Si Chan, help, pass her some air.” Ling Han hurriedly called Li Si Chan over.

Seeing Zhu Xuan Er’s heavily injured state, Li Si Chan was first taken aback, and then stupefied. Revealing disbelief in her eyes, she muttered, “How could there be such a beautiful person!”

Ling Han just noticed that he tore off Zhu Xuan Er’s veil and revealed her true appearance. She was breathtakingly beautiful as expected, no less beautiful than Heavenly Phoenix in those years.

The difference as that Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was like a goddess of war, heroic in posture, illuminatingly beautiful, and charming at her core. Zhu Xuan Er was cold, like a bright moon and out of this world.

Of course, in terms of disposition, Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was a notch above. After all, she was one of the seven Heaven Tier elites in his former life, and how could that confident bearing be something normal people could strive for?

“Don’t stare blankly, hurry!” Ling Han hurriedly urged as the Small Tower’s Source Power was soon going to be expended.

Li Si Chan hurriedly ran over and passed a breath of air to Zhu Xuan Er form mouth to mouth, making her swallow White Phoenix Water True Pill.

Visibly, Zhu Xuan Er’s wounds were recovering at a miraculous speed and so were her internal organs, but she still hadn’t woken up—under the impact of the Flower Blossom Tier martial intent, her divine sense was near shattered.

Ling Han sighed. Injury of the divine sense... he was also at a loss. Now Zhu Xuan Er’s life was restored, but whether she could wake up and when she would wake up depended on her desire for survival and tenacity.

“Si Chan, take care of her!” he said, then burning with killing intent, he flashed out of the Black Tower.

However, Yan Tian Zhao was already gone.

“He ran, Hu Niu and Small Rock are chasing,” Can Ye said.

The corner of Yue Kai Yu’s mouth twitched as he muttered, “Why am I the only one who finds it strange that two people vanished out of thin air, and now one appeared out of thin air!” ‘Could everyone be abnormal, or am I the only abnormal one?’

“Young Master Han, how’s Fairy Zhu?” he hurriedly asked.

“Won’t die.” Ling Han nodded.

As they were speaking, the Rock Spirit returned with Hu Niu sitting on its shoulder.

“Dang it, he slipped away. I only bit off one arm, stinks like heck!” Hu Niu tossed down a severed arm.

Liu Yu Tong and the others were shocked. Even with the Rock Spirit’s help, it was still a Flower Blossom Tier against a Flower Blossom Tier—tearing off one of Yan Tian Zhao’s arms despite that, Hu Niu’s battle prowess was truly strong.

Ling Han’s expression was still cold. Yan Tian Zhao possessed a god’s memories, and when he was torn into pieces back then, he still recovered perfectly fine afterwards, didn’t he? For such an existence, regenerating a severed limb was probably not something difficult.

He decided that the next time he saw Yan Tian Zhao, if he still hadn’t reached Flower Blossom Tier, then he would let Small Tower give him a power boost to strike down Yan Tian Zhao for sure!

It was the pill he refined that awakened Yan Tian Zhao from the state of slumber—being the one to bring about his appearance, he naturally should be the one to end him as wel.

“Young Master Han! Young Master Han!” Yue Kai Yu ran over. “Where did you just go? And, where’s Fairy Chi? Why don’t you guys find it strange? Why am i the only one curious?

Ling Han blinked and said, “You’ve got blurry vision!”

‘Blurry my as*, Zhu Xuan Er’s clearly not here. Why don’t you give me a reason!’

Ling Han didn’t explain at all, so Yue Kai Yu could only stand there with his mouth twitching—was he going to catch Ling Han by his neck and force him to explain?

“Let’s leave here first,” Ling Han said.

The five continued onwards. With Yan Tian Zhao’s sneak-attack, they were even more cautious, but the road following was unusually smooth, encountering not a single assault from beasts, walking smoothly out of the mountains and forests.

Presumably, the Azure Flame Vulture’s show of force intimidated the other beasts to stay in their lairs and not dare to come out.

Ahead was a vast stretch of flatland, and in the far in the distance was a building, appearing extremely conspicuous on the dark-green flatland.

This should be the place of the second test.

The five walked over quickly, and soon, they arrived before the building. They came relatively early—there were only ten people here.

The formation spirit appeared and said indifferently, “In one more day, the test will begin.” Then, it glanced at Ling Han. “You sure can stir up trouble!”

Ling Han said faintly, “What trouble did I cause?”

“The entire forest is in a riot, wasn’t it you who caused the trouble?” The formation spirit snorted.

Ling Han snickered and said, “No rules about not doing that, right?”

“Causing more trouble for me!” the formation spirit said in discontentment. “If it weren’t for the trouble you caused, the people that can come to the second stage would at least decrease by half.”

The first few who arrived were shocked. What exactly did Ling Han do?

Ling Han wouldn’t possibly say that he stole an Azure Flame Vulture’s egg to foster a beast of at least Deity Transformation Tier in the future, keeping his mouth shut, which left the others itching on the inside.

A day later, more and more people arrived at the second stage, and tallying, there were over seventy people. In other words, among those who came from the first stage, over half arrived.

Ling Han set up a tent, taking the chance to go into the Black Tower because Zhu Xuan Er woke up.

The injuries on her body were completely healed, but her divine sense was still heavily damaged—recovering wasn’t a day’s effort but one to two months’ time. But if she could endure past this stage, it would actually be of great help to her martial arts progression.

Waking up from such an injury, this was a type of creation in destruction.

At a loss, Zhu Xuan Er asked, “Young Master Han, where’s this place?” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Moreover, she even saw LI Si Chan here!
