Chapter 3410: Absolute Fairness

Translator: Henyee Translations | Editor: Henyee Translations

Xuanyuan Dingguo soon left.

However, just as he left, another person came.

It was an old man dressed in eunuch attire. He had arrived silently like a ghost, making the seven Calabash Brothers feel as if they were facing a great enemy. They were all prepared to attack.

“So it’s Senior Zhu.” Ling Han cupped his hands. This was the old eunuch, Zhu Qi, an elite of Mystery Realm Tier. No one knew how many years he had been in the Imperial Palace, and in fact, no one had even known of his existence before.

A Mystery Realm Tier! Right now, he could be said to be the strongest below Chen Fengyan, yet he was actually willing to cripple himself and become a eunuch?

It was unbelievable.

Zhu Qi looked at the seven Calabash Brothers and said with a smile, “Young man, you’re really blessed. You have even managed to encounter the fortune that has been nurtured by the heaven and earth.”

Ling Han merely chuckled. ‘You don’t know how annoying it is to raise a child when you haven’t raised one yet. Which one of these seven brats is easy to deal with? They’re simply little devils.’

However, if he really said it, wouldn’t it hurt the other party’s “root”??

Thus, Ling Han very tactfully only smiled. Otherwise, he would definitely be beaten up.

“I’m here on His Majesty’s orders to give you something,” Zhu Qi said. He reached out and swiped the table, and a jade scroll appeared out of thin air. It was obvious that it was quite old, and it emitted an ancient aura.

“His Majesty bestowed it?” Ling Han was surprised. Wasn’t this Holy Emperor in seclusion?

“Hehe, His Majesty has great achievements. Although he is in seclusion, his divine sense can reach anywhere and everywhere,” Zhu Qi said, his face full of admiration.

Could it be that you’re infatuated with Chen Fengyan, so you’re willing to endure castration and enter the palace to accompany him?

Ling Han couldn’t help but shudder. This scene was a little too beautiful, and he didn’t dare to continue thinking about it.

“What’s this?” he asked.

“A formation,” Zhu Qi said. “His Majesty said that you can comprehend it yourself. No one can help you. However, there are also some materials to make the formation foundations and some blood. As long as you can understand this formation, you can make it.”

He took out a piece of metal the size of a human head and a jade jar. Even though it was covered, one could still see terrifying blood and Qi rising from it.

In order to create a formation, the materials and ink to construct the formation foundations were also necessary.

The higher the level of the formation, the higher the level of the materials needed. The ink also had to be the blood of high-level existences. It could be said that the basic structure of the formation was extremely expensive, and with just a single failure, the waste would be huge.

“Thank you, Your Majesty. Thank you, Senior Zhu,” Ling Han hurriedly said.

Zhu Qi nodded and said, “His Majesty indeed sees you in a different light. This jar contains the precious blood of the Demon Emperor. If you consume it, it will be enough to increase your level of being greatly. His Majesty didn’t reward this to his children, but gave it to you to refine formation foundations. It’s obvious that he has great expectations of you.”

Ling Han was astounded. This was actually the blood of the Demon Emperor?

It seemed that the Demon Emperor was not simply beaten up after sparring with Chen Fengyan. Instead, he was beaten up so badly that he was forced to bleed.

That was true. Otherwise, how could a dignified Demon Emperor bow in submission?

“I understand.” Ling Han nodded.

Zhu Qi took a deep look at Ling Han. He actually didn’t understand why Chen Fengyan thought so highly of Ling Han. Hong Tianbu was clearly more outstanding in martial arts, and his cultivation level was even higher. Shouldn’t he properly nurture Hong Tianbu?

“His Majesty said that you only have to do things with a clear conscience, and there is no need to restrain your actions,” he repeated.

Ling Han smiled. Chen Fengyan’s personality was really to his liking.

“Yeah.” He nodded again.

Zhu Qi coughed, and said, “This old servant is leaving, there is no need to send me off…” He did not allow Ling Han to send him off, and with a move of his body, he had already left.

The old eunuch stood on the treetop and looked around. He muttered, “Strange, where is that Innate Divine Physique? We’ve clearly searched for so long, but we still haven’t found it.”

He would never have thought that the Innate Divine Physique he was thinking about was actually right under his nose. It was just that it was not a newborn baby at all, but an adult man!

Even if he was beaten to death, he would never think of Ling Han.

After Zhu Qi left, Ling Han began to study the jade scroll.

“Father, this blood smells so good!” The seven Calabash Brothers climbed onto the table and sniffed.

F*ck, blood can smell good? Are you vampires?

Ling Han hurriedly picked up the jar. Since Chen Fengyan thought so highly of him, he naturally had to create this formation as well, which would be worthy of the former’s appreciation of him, and he could not let the seven babies drink it.

“He must have embarked on the path of immortality. Otherwise, it’s impossible for this blood to remove all the fishy smell, just like the great dao wine,” Eldest Baby commented.

Second Baby activated her eye technique and looked at it for a while before saying, “Yes, there are a lot of vitality factors in his blood. There’s a trace of immortal aura. He has indeed crossed the Celestial Gate.”

What secrets could he hide in front of these children?

Ling Han sighed, and said, “These are the materials needed to make the formation foundations, so you can’t have any ideas.”

“Oh, Father.” The seven children were dejected.

Ling Han was very at ease. Although the seven children were very tough, they were true to their words, so he did not have to worry about them disobeying him. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Also, no matter how precious this blood is, it’s still blood. Don’t think about it in the future,” he warned solemnly.

“Got it, Father.” The seven Calabash Brothers nodded again.

Only then did Ling Han relax. There were plenty of delicacies in the world, so what was the point of fixating on at blood?

He let the seven children play by themselves and began to study the jade scroll.

There was a formation recorded on it called “Absolute Fairness”.

It was very simple. After the formation was activated, the cultivation level of everyone in the formation would be pulled to the same level.

Such a formation was not rare. Previously, the Ancient Dao Sect had such an ancient formation, but they only had the formation foundations. No one knew how to make it. Moreover, this formation was very huge.

However, the “Absolute Fairness” recorded in this jade scroll was different. Although it required a total of 49 formation foundations, the formation foundations were very small and could be set up on clothes. Once activated, it could pull all living beings within 30 metres to the same cultivation level.

…With the lower cultivation level being the standard.

Therefore, this was “Absolute Fairness”. It was completely a battle between people of the same level.

Though the formation naturally had an upper limit, but it was as high as the Mystery Realm Tier, and there was also a time limit on how long it could be used, it could only last for ten minutes. After using it once, it would need a whole day to recharge.

“If it’s ten minutes… who among those of the same level that I can’t handle?” Ling Han smiled. “As long as I can create this formation, I’ll be able to fight Yuwen Hou.”

He concentrated on studying the formation. This was extremely complicated. Not only did it require formation patterns that surpassed extreme effectiveness, but it also required incomparably complicated combinations between various formation patterns. Ordinary people would not be able to remember it.

This required too much Spiritual power.

Ling Han, on the other hand, was tireless. Instead, his interest was piqued, and he was completely engrossed.
