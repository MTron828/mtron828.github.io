Chapter 1336 Great Slaughter

An ancient coffin that seemed as if it would not change for eternity suddenly released a loud commotion. Instantly, this caused the hearts of all the surrounding Eternal River Tier elites to clench.

Even if they had never experienced it themselves, they had also heard of this kind of legend. An incredibly powerful existence left behind a fated opportunity; as long as someone could help his daughter reincarnate and come back to life, they would be taught a supreme secret technique as reward.

All of a sudden, they all wanted to stop fighting to snatch this fated opportunity.

However, the world changed whether you wanted it or not. Xie Qian was like a mad dog, and was still unendingly attacking. He had completely lost all his reason, and his only remaining thought was killing and death.

A grand Eternal River Tier elite had actually fallen to this level. Just the mere thought of it would make one sigh.

Cracking sounds were still ringing out from the ancient coffin. The top that had initially been like a part of one solid object had separated, revealing a massive coffin lid. Like a thundercloud, it was astonishingly huge, casting a very long shadow.

The elites were all filled with expectation. Perhaps the key to their surpassing the Eternal River Tier and advancing into Saint level lay here!

Boom!

A pillar of light shot up into the skies, directly blasting a hole in the ground above it. It penetrated the chaotic space of the Two Realm Battlefield, and at the same time shot into the skies of the Immortal Realm and the Netherworld, exuding endless brilliance. It was brighter than the sun, and could be seen clearly even if one was an entire galaxy away.

All the Eternal River Tier elites flew up into the skies, wanting to begin a fierce competition.

But it was at this moment that the light pillar that had shot up into the skies actually began to spin at an incredibly fast rate. Even Eternal River Tiers were unable to evade. Shua, in an instant, it had spun several tens of thousands of times.

“Ah...” All the Eternal River Tier elites released terrible cries. To their horror, they realized that their spirits had been ignited, their heavenly bodies shattering automatically as if they were adding flammable liquid to their spirits, causing their spirits to burn fiercer and fiercer. It was completely unstoppable.

This... This was rushing on the path to death!

The only difference separating them from Xie Qian was that one had lost all reason, and had completely no idea what he was doing, whereas they clearly realized what was happening now, and this also scared them out of their wits.

Death was not frightening, but watching helplessly as they walked towards death... this kind of experience was definitely not something anyone could bear.

Yet no one could resist. Even the great elites of the Eternal River Tier could only watch helplessly as their souls burnt brightly. Their life essence was being released in an extremely short amount of time. How shocking was it to have so much life essence from Eternal River Tier elites? Innumerable grass and flowers actually sprouted on this barren land in a single instant.

These stalks of green grass were visibly boring out of the ground, sprouting, growing leaves, and flourishing well. Finally, flowers bloomed.

A fragrance wafted in this air, causing this underground world to transform into a place like paradise on earth.

However, the price for this was too massive. Several dozen Eternal River Tiers were endlessly burning up their life and vitality just to exhibit this show to present the miracle of life.

Every Eternal River Tier elite released furious roars, trying their best to struggle out of this crisis, but it was useless. A powerful energy that far surpassed their life level was acting on them, reducing them to meat on a chopping board which could only be slaughtered as the cook pleased.

Just like Xie Qian, they could only persist for a single day at most. At the end of the day, they would all be burnt to nothing. Even if their bodies were still present, without their spirits, they would only be mere corpses.

This was a great slaughter, and was also a tragedy that had not happened in the Long Light Galaxy for billions of years. Several dozen Eternal River Tier elites were all simultaneously slaughtered, setting a new precedent.

In the Black Tower, Ling Han and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden were both dumbfounded with shock—Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was shocked from hearing Ling Han’s retelling of the present situation, which caused her to be incredibly stunned. In her eyes, Eternal River Tier was equivalent to an invincible being, yet now these invincible elites were completely helpless, and their spirits were all burning.

“Looks like... Ding Zizhen had not told us the complete truth,” Ling Han uttered darkly.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden nodded. Every Eternal River Tiers would be burnt, and perhaps even Saints would be helpless as well. Then who else in this world would be able to revive Ding Ling?

“Not only had he not told us the truth, I’m afraid we have been used,” she deduced. “The reason that Ding Zizhen buried his daughter here is probably related to the fact that this place is the Two Realm Battlefield.”

Ling Han nodded. “In these millions of years, who knows how many people have died, and how much blood has been spilled in this place. Though I do not know how exactly the spirit of a dead person could be regathered, I think it should be linked to death and bloodshed. Then the Two Realm Battlefield would be the most suitable place.”

“Accumulation for millions of years... It has probably reached a certain critical point, and that is why this place has appeared,” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden continued.

“Making living people into a blood sacrifice should probably be a procedure of the second stage,” Ling Han said.

“The Five Sects could refine a Realm Pill, so Ding Zizhen’s methods must be even more astonishing. Using souls as his raw materials to refine a truly incredible alchemical pill to regather the soul of a person who has been dead for who knows how many years so she would be reincarnated and come back to life,” Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden said.

The two of them shared a look, and could more or less deduce the truth of the matter. But the problem was they were completely incapable of interfering, and could only sit and watch in the Black Tower.

If they went out, the only path was death!

“I hope Rabbit and that perverted ginseng are all right. Faceless and the others should have already fled.” Ling Han sighed.

“Probably.” Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden nodded.

Faceless and the other king tiers fled fast enough, and their abilities were considerably extraordinary as well, so it should have been no problem for them to escape. Although the cultivation level of Rabbit and old ginseng was not high, they were extremely slippery. Their skill in escaping was top-grade. If it was in mere terms of survival abilities, they could be compared to a Heavenly Body Tier.

“But the Purple Moon Divine Maiden would be...” Ling Han and Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden spoke at the same time, but fell silent all of a sudden.

They were both indebted to the Purple Moon Divine Maiden, but in the present situation, it was completely impossible for them to go out and rescue the Purple Moon Divine Maiden. This caused them to feel terrible, and at the same time, were filled with fury towards Ding Zizhen.

It was one matter for you to want to revive your daughter, but to make so many pay with their lives, that was too demented.

From a certain aspect, there was no difference between Ding Zizhen and the Five Sects. They had both killed innumerable living beings through their schemes.

Pa, pa, pa. One after another, elites burnt their flame of life completely, their bodies collapsing. On the surface, they did not seem to have the slightest injury, but in truth, their souls were already gone, so they had died completely and absolutely.

Another pillar of light shot out of the ancient coffin, and it was far wider than the previous one. In the middle of this pillar of light, the figure of a woman was slowly appearing. Her limbs were drooping as if she was asleep, but also as if she was in a coma.

At present, she was only left with skin wrapped around her bones. She was dressed in a long green skirt that fluttered lightly in the breeze.

A strange event followed. Her skin was presently becoming plump as if the water of life had been injected into her body. Starting from her right leg, her dry skin was rapidly becoming tender and soft, and then continuing upwards. However, it was only limited to one half of her body.

It could be clearly seen that her initially shrivelled hip was slowly becoming erect, solidifying, becoming well-rounded, and her breasts were also slowly raising up, with a deep ravine between the two mountains, astonishingly curvaceous.

Finally, it was the face. Her lips were like fire and her complexion like jade. Her hair had also recovered its luster, revealing a beautiful set of features.

However, this was also only one half of her body[1].

Xiu, the pillar of light suddenly vanished, and that woman was still standing in midair.

Her eyelids trembled, and she opened her eyes.

[1] Pretty unclear how the halves are divided... It sounds like the front half, maybe? Could be just left or right, but it doesn’t sound like it.
