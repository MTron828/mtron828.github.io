Piles of white bones surrounded the small hill.

Ling Han finally understood how they had died. They hadn’t died from fighting over this flower, but rather they had been silently killed by the “black cloud” after being entranced by the flower.

“Ah!” Shui Yanyu yelped in astonishment, a lingering fear still in her heart. If Ling Han hadn’t pulled her back just then, she would have also become like the other two people. She would have walked over and been killed by the black cloud.

“W-what was that?” she asked in a trembling voice.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “It was too quick, I couldn’t see it.”

Shui Yanyu was slightly surprised. Even Ling Han hadn’t been able to see it clearly? That black cloud was truly uncanny.

Ling Han thought for a moment, and then casually tossed a black ball into the air.

“Hahaha, Little Asura has come!” The black ball expanded in the air, with arms and legs extending from its body. It eventually transformed into a large humanoid puppet.

Weng!

The black cloud flew out again, this time swooping toward the Asura Demon Emperor.

“Who are— Holy f*ck!” The Asura Demon Emperor was furious, but his angry shout quickly turned into a surprised cry. He immediately scuttled backward upon landing on the ground. The black cloud swarmed toward him as he ran away, and it eventually engulfed his body.

Shui Yanyu and Hu Feiyun both yelped in surprise. This was because numerous pits had appeared in the Asura Demon Emperor’s body. His left arm suffered the most, and it was as if it had been completely corroded. Only a tiny bit of the arm still hung from his elbow.

The other parts of his body were only slightly better off. However, they were at least still intact.

“Master!” There was an aggrieved look on the Asura Demon Emperor’s face as he gazed at Ling Han. He didn’t need to screw him over like this, did he?

Ling Han ignored him, and said, “That black cloud is formed from a swarm of countless insects. It’s just that they’re so small that they look like a black cloud when gathered together.”

“Those were insects?” The Asura Demon Emperor shook his devastated left arm as he jumped up, and shouted, “What kind of teeth do they have? What kind of human can defend against them?!”

“You’re not a human!” Hu Feiyun pointed out.

The Asura Demon Emperor, who was extremely shameless, said, “If Master’s wife says I’m not a human, then I’m not a human! I’m actually a dog! Woof! Woof!” He dropped to the ground and started barking like a dog. Hu Feiyun giggled upon seeing this, and she didn’t try to correct his way of referring to her.

“Are we still going to pluck that flower?” Shui Yanyu asked.

They had all retreated a fair distance back to avoid being entranced by the flower again. Although Ling Han and Hu Feiyun hadn’t been affected last time, perhaps their stronger resistance was due to their relatively higher cultivation level.

If they stayed near the flower for too long, it was possible that they could still be affected.

“Those insects mightn’t be very strong, and maybe that’s why they have to rely on the entrancing effects of the flower. Only after their victims are entranced do they fly out to feast on their flesh. However, their teeth are truly impressive. They devoured the two Mountain River Tier cultivators in a flash.”

Ling Han pondered for a moment before saying, “Even Level Five Godly metal isn’t strong enough to deal with them. They can still gnaw away at it, albeit with slightly more difficulty.”

The Asura Demon Emperor was proof of this. The puppet that he resided in had been forged from Level Five Godly metal, yet his left arm had almost been completely obliterated.

A confident smile appeared on Ling Han’s face, and he said, “Let me try them out!”

Shui Yanyu was given a huge fright, and she shouted, “You’re crazy!”

Couldn’t he see the wretched state of the Asura Demon Emperor?

“Let Little Asura go!” she added hurriedly.

“Milady!” the Asura Demon Emperor wailed plaintively. It made sense that his master should stay away from danger, but that didn’t mean that they should push him toward peril instead!

Ling Han smiled, and said, “There’s no need to worry. My physique is on par with Level Five Godly metal now, and coupled with my insane recovery ability, these insects might be unable to threaten me! Anyhow, I wager that these insects don’t have powerful defensive abilities.”

He hadn’t sensed any Origin Power fluctuations from the black cloud, and this signified that the insects had either never cultivated before, or had cultivation levels that were far above his. These were the only two possibilities.

However, was the latter possible?

If these insects were all at the Sun Moon Tier, perhaps even Heavenly Body Tier elites could be killed by them.

There was strength in numbers. When quantity reached a certain threshold, it would lead to a qualitative change.

These insects were astonishingly quick, and they also possessed terrifying teeth. If their defenses were also powerful, then the heavens were being far too unfair.

Shui Yanyu was familiar with Ling Han’s personality, and she knew that he wouldn’t change his mind easily. She could only nod and say, “Be careful, be careful, and be careful!” She told him to be careful three times, revealing just how concerned she was for his safety.

“I will!” Ling Han nodded, and said, “We still haven’t made a child yet, so how can I bear to die?”

“G-go die!” Shui Yanyu’s face flushed red, and she couldn’t help but push Ling Han. Ling Han clumsily charged toward the hill.

Shui Yanyu was easily embarrassed, and she was unable to endure Ling Han’s teasing even when it was just the two of them. That being the case, how could she not feel utterly embarrassed now that there were two outsiders beside them?

A look of interest appeared on Hu Feiyun’s face. Was there some “adulterous affair” between these two people? Meanwhile, the Asura Demon Emperor continued to crawl on all fours and act like a dog. He used a hand to scratch his neck, and it was as if he were afraid of being killed and silenced.

Ling Han continued to charge toward the hill.

Weng!

The hill immediately detected his presence, and the black cloud swarmed out once again.

Ling Han humphed, and said, “I don’t believe that your defenses are also incredible!”

With a thought, bursts of roaring flames surged from his body. Streaks of divine patterns were intertwined among the flames.

“Squeak!” The black cloud instantly descended into chaos. It became like a headless fly, and the insects quickly separated into numerous smaller groups.

The swarm of insects had been like a black cloud before, yet the smaller swarms were more like several squirming snakes now. However, there were also one or two swarms that found their direction and continued to swoop toward Ling Han. They eventually arrived before his body.

Ling Han could clearly see that the “black snake” before him was formed from a swarm of countless insects. Each insect was incredibly tiny, yet they all had disproportionately “humongous” teeth. Not only that, but they were also unafraid of death. They clearly knew that Ling Han was bathed in flames, yet they still continued to charge toward him wave after wave.

“Squeak, squeak, squeak!”

The insects were burned to death one after another, yet they forcefully carved a path out and allowed even more insects to swarm onto Ling Han’s body. They started to gnaw at his flesh.

Ling Han humphed and unleashed his Seven Kill Subduing Soul Technique.

Weng!

The insects that were gnawing at his flesh were instantly stunned. In fact, most of their souls were immediately shattered into pieces. Only a small number of them managed to survive.

Sure enough, these insects had very weak defenses even though they possessed incredible speed and terrifying teeth. Not only was their physical defense weak, but their divine sense defense was also weak.

The heavens were indeed fair. These insects had been bestowed with unique abilities even though they hadn’t cultivated at all. However, they also came with fatal weaknesses.

It was because of this that they used that enchanting flower as bait. They would wait until their victim was entranced, then swoop over and instantly devour their flesh.

However, Ling Han was prepared, so the outcome was completely different!

After all, he was a king tier of the Mountain River Tier.

“Gasp!” Ling Han bared his teeth in pain. Although he had killed most of the insects, there were still some that clutched onto his flesh with their “humongous” teeth, even though they were already dead or unconscious.

‘It hurts!’
