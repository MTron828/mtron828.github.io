Chapter 975: Startling a Heavenly Body Tier Cultivator

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

This slash was incredibly dazzling, and even the sun in the sky appeared dull in comparison.

This wasn’t a great elite of the Sun Moon Tier, but instead a great elite of the Heavenly Body Tier!

Ling Han’s first reaction was to hide into the Black Tower. This wasn’t a question of courage. Even though his physique was already on par with Level Two Godly metal, it was still doubtless that he would turn into dust if he was struck by this slash.

Weng!

Right at this moment, however, a golden staff instantly descended from the sky and appeared before him. Streaks of divine patterns lit up on the staff, forming a golden zone that protected both him and Shui Yanyu and Hu Feiyun, who were standing behind him.

Ding!

The sword light slashed into the staff, sending up a long streak of sparks.

Boom!

A terrifying shock wave slid past the two sides and roof of the golden zone. These were streaks of sword patterns, and their vicious sharpness caused even the space to become unstable. It was as if space were going to tear apart.

“Hmph! You dare attempt to kill my people before me? What courage!!” A mighty figure appeared before Ling Han and firmly grabbed the staff. A domineering aura was radiated from his body.

He was Ding Li’an, one of the Seven Generals of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire.

He had a burly figure, and wore a crimson armor that was etched full of divine patterns. It was evidently a God Tool. His black hair billowed in the air, and coupled with the golden staff in his hand, he appeared like an invincible God of War.

One man guarded the pass, and even 10,000 wouldn’t be able to break through!

The most renowned battle of this elite was when he charged into the Eternity Sky Majestic Empire by himself and killed a traitor in the Imperial Capital of the enemy. In the end, he managed to successfully break back out and return to the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire.

Of course, he also paid a huge price for it, and almost lost his life. He only recovered from his wounds after recuperating for several hundred years. According to rumors, he still suffered from the side effects, or else he might have already broken through to the medium extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier.

“Heh, what a heavy accusation, Great General. He’s merely a cultivator at the Mountain River Tier, and this king has already killed countless such cultivators. It’s as simple as flicking my fingers.” A middle-aged male slowly walked out. His skin was white, even a little transparent.

“King An Lan, do you want to battle against me?” Ding Li’an raised his staff and pointed it toward the middle-aged male. His fighting spirit soared, and the image of a star formed behind his back, exuding a might that desired to suppress the sky.

If the target of his staff had been an ordinary person, perhaps their entire body would have already exploded. However, the middle-aged male whom he referred to as King An Lan was completely unaffected. He was a crowned king of the Jade Drop Majestic Empire, and not only was he powerful, but his status was also extremely lofty. Thus, he naturally wasn’t afraid of Ding Li’an.

“This King wants the life of this brat,” he said softly. “He must die today.”

Ling Han chuckled coldly, and said, “Dare I ask, King An Lan, where I have offended you?” He originally didn’t have the right to converse with elites of the Heavenly Body Tier. However, this person was trying to kill him, so why would he care about such formalities?

A look of disdain flashed across King An Lan’s face. A mere ant of the Mountain River Tier actually dared to stand while speaking to him? What gall!! He didn’t reply, and merely stared at Ding Li’an.

Ding Li’an’s expression was cold. “You think I don’t know that this little buddy reached the Crimson Lake Island three times? Are you afraid that he’ll become a huge threat to the Jade Drop Majestic Empire in the future?”

“Haha! So what if that’s the case?” King An Lan didn’t refute this claim. At their tier, it was beneath them to lie through their teeth. He laughed, and said, “However, this brat merely has some potential. Even if he can realize it, that’s still a matter for at least tens of thousands of years later. Great General Ding, what’s the point of protecting him?”

“Well then, why is King An Lan so anxious to kill him?” Ding Li’an rebutted.

“Great General Ding, I’ve heard that you secretly have a crush on the empress. Aren’t you afraid that this prodigy is going to attract her attention, and perhaps even... Hehe!” King An Lan suddenly changed the topic.

This was also Ding Li’an’s weakness.

He was deep in love with the empress of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire, and this was a secret that was known by almost everyone. However, his status was too lofty and his strength was too powerful, and the other person was more so the empress of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire. As a result, not many dared to raise this matter.

Now that King An Lan publicly spoke of this matter, Ding Li’an’s expression instantly became dark. A petrifying killing intent seeped out from his body.

The empress was his weakness, and she was also his reverse scale 1 . She was more so a holy figure who couldn’t be violated!

“King An Lan, are you seeking death?” Ding Li’an was simmering with killing intent. He loved the empress of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire deeply, yet he was too ashamed of himself to pursue her. He believed that not a single male in the world was worthy of being with the empress. Now, however, someone actually dared to disrespect the empress. This made him seethe with rage.

King An Lan’s heart jolted. He hadn’t envisioned that he would fail to drive a wedge between them, and instead would end up enraging Ding Li’an. What an absolute backfire!

“Heh, this general also thinks that this brat is an eyesore. I also want to end his life!” Another voice sounded, and a white-robed male suddenly appeared beside Ding Li’an and King An Lan. His face was jade-like, and he possessed a rarely seen beauty. However, his amorous eyes were far too lustful, and it was clear that he was someone who had tangled with many women.

“Qi Feng!” Ding Li’an said in a deep voice.

Qi Feng was a Great General of the Eternity Sky Majestic Empire. His status was equivalent to Ding Li’an’s, and his strength was also similar to Ding Li’an’s. When Ding Li’an had charged into the Eternity Sky Majestic Empire, he was the main elite who had pursued him. It was a pity that Ding Li’an had succeeded in fleeing back to the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire, however, and this was something that continued to weigh on his mind.

It could be said that they were old enemies. However, the three Majestic Empires hadn’t gone to war for a long time, and thus they also hadn’t been able to battle each other for a long time.

“Ding Li’an, hand that brat over. Otherwise, I won’t mind teaming up with King An Lan!” Qi Feng threatened sinisterly. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Ling Han was astonished. He had merely reached the island three times, and now even elites of the Heavenly Body Tier wanted to slay him on the spot?

“We’ve truly drawn too much attention this time!” Shui Yanyu whispered. “After reaching the island twice, Zhao Lun also met with the threat of death when he left. However, he had already shot to fame at that time, so in addition to Great General Sha Jing, he also had Great General Zhao Jianbai protecting him in secret. It was thanks to them that the Eternity Sky and Jade Drop Majestic Empires weren’t able to kill him.”

There was an anxious look on her face. Who would’ve imagined that Ling Han would be so freakish and reach the Crimson Lake Island three times? This was several times more freakish than Zhao Lun, and it would be strange if the other two Majestic Empires didn’t try to kill him.

However, there was only one Great General here in Ding Li’an. How could he possibly block two great elites of the Heavenly Body Tier?

King An Lan sneered coldly as he wrapped his arms before his chest.

Meanwhile, Ding Li’an appeared to be in a wild state, and he brandished his staff for a moment before resting it onto his shoulder. “You two can try! However, I’m warning you, if one of you tries to battle me while the other attempts to kill him, don’t blame me for being merciless. These youths that you brought over... none of them will survive!”

King An Lan and Great General Qi Feng’s expressions changed drastically when they heard this. Meanwhile, the youths from the two other Majestic Empires also trembled in fear.

These words were uttered by an elite of the Heavenly Body Tier, so who would dare to treat it as an empty threat?

“Ding Li’an, let this general test which stage you’ve cultivated your Northern Desert Crimson Sun Technique to! “Qi Feng raised his fists as he spoke. He looked like a frail scholar, yet his expertise was none other than fist techniques. He was renowned for his ferocious close-quarter combat.

“This king would also like to have a taste of General Ding’s supreme staff techniques!” King An Lan brandished his sword and released boundless divine might.
