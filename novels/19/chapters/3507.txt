Chapter 3508: Destroying the foundation stone of the Celestial Path

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The sky was filled with rockets.

Gongsun Liang looked apprehensive. These arrows were all formed from high-level fiery flames, and possessed incredibly frightening destructive power. At the level of Foundation Building, they could be considered absolutely strong. Even if a Cauldron Forging Tier cultivator was not careful, it was possible that he would be severely injured.

He clasped his hands in front of him, and madly drew on the power of heaven and earth, then blasted it towards the skies.

One after another, the rockets were destroyed, but there were still a few that had slipped through the net. Gongsun Liang was unable to dodge in time, and an arrow was instantly shot into his left shoulder.

“Ah—” he released a terrible scream. High-level energy wreaked havoc in his body, destroying his vitality, causing him unbearable pain.

Although he was a Foundation Building Celestial, there were many such people in prison. He wasn’t a stunning prodigy. Thus, he didn’t possess any toughness or indomitable quality. Thus, he would naturally scream in pain.

The golden bull was emotionless, and it continued to launch attacks at Gongsun Liang. It wanted to kill this person in a single stroke.

Ling Han shook his head. The so-called Celestial Path elites were actually no different from mortals. They only lived longer, had stronger power, and were slightly more powerful. In other areas, even Celestials had emotions and desires, and could also sense pain, as well as fear of death.

So what if he had crossed over the Celestial Gate? This rebirth could only be considered in terms of abilities.

Shen Tian and the others were all stunned. Even if they weren’t in the Foundation Building Tier, they could still clearly see that Gongsun Liang was about to lose, and it wouldn’t take very long.

They could not accept this. It should be known that they had all walked out of prison, and had seen many elites. It was also because of this, that they looked down on the people outside very much. Compared with the beings in prison, they were indescribably weak.

But their Master, a Celestial Path elite, was actually going to be defeated, and possibly even killed. How could they believe this?

“Don’t kill me!” Gongsun Liang couldn’t hold on any longer, and he shouted, “I’m willing to surrender! I’m willing to surrender!”

Ling Han shook his head, saying, “You’re only thinking of surrendering now? It’s too late!”

If everyone was like him, raising the flag of objection, and just said a word of surrender when they were about to die, and they would be able to escape, then wouldn’t the whole world be in chaos?

How could one rule the world without strict laws?

Previously, the Foreign Affairs Department had not revealed their fangs all this while, so it was inevitable that they would give off a feeling of gentleness. Thus, Ling Han also wanted to take this opportunity to establish his might, and let others know that on the other side of gentleness, there was also iron-bloodedness and bloodshed.

There were more than just a few formations on the golden bull. Gongsun Liang turned around and wanted to flee, but his figure had just risen, when he suddenly fell down from the skies, landing solidly. In fact, he had even created a deep pit in the ground.

Gravity Formation!

Gongsun Liang barely managed to get back to his feet, but even his body was trembling. The effects of this Gravity Formation on him were too great, so much so that it was extremely difficult for him to even stand.

How was he supposed to continue fighting like this?

It was clear that this was a powerful attack from the golden bull. The fact that it hadn’t used it at the first moment was probably because it had expended too much energy from the Dao Stone.

“Moo!” The golden bull opened its mouth again, and released a soundwave. It actually turned into an extremely ancient seal that blasted towards Gongsun Liang.

Gongsun Liang was suppressed by the gravity field, so he couldn’t dodge at all. However, Spiritual Power was formless, so it wouldn’t be restrained by gravity. He immediately grabbed a large rock and used it as a shield. Peng! The large rock instantly shattered upon contact with the seal, rendering it completely useless.

He roared loudly, and a block of stone materialized in front of his chest, as if it could support heaven and earth.

This was the cornerstone of his Celestial Path, and was also the key to his becoming a Celestial Path elite. It was incredibly important. Under normal circumstances, it was definitely impossible for him to sacrifice it, but now, for the sake of staying alive, he could no longer care.

The seal landed on the foundation stone of the Celestial Path. Peng, it was instantly shattered and destroyed, but a crack also appeared on the foundation stone of the Celestial Path.

Gongsun Liang looked pained. This was the foundation stone of the Celestial Path. If it shattered, he would fall from the Foundation Building Tier and become a mortal again. Moreover, he had already lived for several hundred years, so once his cultivation level was weakened, his lifespan would probably dry up in no time.

But even if the foundation stone of the Celestial Path had not shattered, and only cracks had appeared, it was still a great loss for him. He would need to spend a great amount of time and treasures to repair it. Otherwise, if the cracks continued to expand, it would still damage his dao foundation.

The golden bull roared again, and spat out another seal.

Under the suppression of gravity, how could Gongsun Liang dodge?

He could only summon the foundation stone of the Celestial Path again, to block the might of the seal. Otherwise, he would only be killed.

Peng! Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The cornerstone of the Celestial Path once again blocked the might of the seal, but the cracks widened further.

Gongsun Liang was inconsolably terrified. He was drinking poison to quench his thirst. Even if he could just barely hold on now, as long as the cornerstone of the Celestial Path shattered, he would fall to Mystery Realm Tier, so how would he be able to stand against the golden bull?

But there was nothing that could be done. Now, if he did not use the cornerstone of the Celestial Path to block it, his only fate would be to die on the spot. Hence, even though he knew this, he could only force himself to resist. Peng! Peng! Peng!

After a dozen over times, Gongsun Liang’s foundation stone of the Celestial Path was already covered with cracks, and shattering was only a matter of an instant.

Ling Han and Princess Bixiao both sighed in emotion. As expected of the war colossus, capable of sweeping aside all other Foundation Building cultivators.

Gongsun Liang’s fate was already set in stone. Right now, he was merely struggling on the verge of death.

“Gongsun, I’ve arrived. Come and see me!” A loud shout rang out, and a majestic voice rang out, shaking the heaven and earth.

Gongsun Liang instantly revealed a look of delight. This was the Xuan Tianling, a Cauldron Forging Tier elite!

As long as this person arrived, he would be saved.

“Lord Xuan, save me!” he shouted with all his might.

In the distant skies, a figure was presently streaking through the air, indescribably fast.

“What do we do?” Princess Bixiao turned to look at Ling Han. To be addressed as Lord by Gongsun Liang, this person’s cultivation level was definitely above that of Gongsun Liang. Though the war colossus was awesome, against Cauldron Forging Tier… it was probably still not enough.

Ling Han gritted his teeth, “This Gongsun Liang must be dealt with!”

He controlled the golden bull to continue attacking, wanting to kill Gongsun Liang before this “Xuan whatnot” arrived.

“Stop!” The figure in the skies was astonishingly fast, and arrived in an instant. However, Gongsun Liang had also reached the end of his line, and after receiving another seal, the cornerstone of the Celestial Path finally crumbled.

“No—” He released an extremely tragic roar. He was done for. From now onwards, he would become a mortal.

“Let’s go!” Ling Han grabbed the seven children and stuffed them into the Essence Nurturing Gourd. He then summoned the golden bull back and leaped out.

Though he had not managed to kill Gongsun Liang, he had crippled the latter’s cornerstone of the Celestial Path, so living was not much different from being a cripple, and he could no longer play any tricks.

At this moment, Princess Bixiao couldn’t care less about gender anymore. She leaped onto the bull’s back and sat behind Ling Han.

The golden bull’s legs moved, and it was as if it were flying.

Xiu, the person in the skies descended, and they could see that he was actually standing on a long spear. When he neared the ground, he put away the long spear, then looked towards Gongsun Liang. Instantly, his expression darkened. “Where do you think you’re running to!” He once again drew out his spear, and flew into the skies, chasing after Ling Han and the princess..
