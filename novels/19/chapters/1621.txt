Chapter 1622: Becoming a Saint One After Another

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden had received the inheritance of the three Phoenix Kings, and this had elevated her bloodline to the pinnacle level of the Immortal Realm. Moreover, she had a constant supply of alchemical pills from Ling Han, and she was also able to comprehend dao under the Reincarnation Tree. Thus, there were almost no obstacles hindering her cultivation. As such, how could her cultivation speed not be insanely quick?

If they hadn’t been held up in the Netherworld for 10 years, perhaps she would have reached the Genesis Tier even sooner.

Now, however, she was finally breaking through after having accumulated her comprehensions and cultivation for so long.

She simply smiled at Ling Han before leaping up into the sky.

If she underwent her heavenly tribulation here, it was entirely possible that she might obliterate the entire Wood Figure Planet.

Ling Han naturally followed her into the sky as well. Although he wouldn’t be able to help her, he still had to remain by her side, and watch her undergo her heavenly tribulation.

Boom!

Dark thunderclouds formed in the icy-cold dark sky above the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s head, and the first bolt of lightning was already fervently striking down at her.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden unfurled her wings that measured a whopping 500 kilometers in length as she looked up to meet the lightning strike. This was bound to be an intense clash.

In the blink of an eye, 10 golden paths had already unfurled toward this area as the Star Sand Saint and the other Saints made their way over. Upon seeing that it was the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden undergoing heavenly tribulation, they were all stunned beyond words.

Apart from the Star Sand Saint, the nine other Saints had all attended the disciple recruitment ceremony at that time. However, which of them had held high hopes for the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden at that time? If it weren’t for the extremely good memory of Saints, perhaps they would have already forgotten about this person they had labeled as only having “ordinary talent”.

Indeed, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s talent had only been worthy of such a label at that time, especially among the sea of prodigies gathered at the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy.

However, who could have imagined that someone with such “ordinary talent” would one day become a Saint?

In fact, even the Star Sand Saint was slightly red-faced with embarrassment now. At that time, he had chosen Gu Daoyi to become his disciple. Even so, he had expected Gu Daoyi to require at least 10,000 to become a Saint. However, how long had passed now? Yet this woman had already reached this stage.

It was as if those close to Ling Han were all freaks!

“It’s only been three years, yet two Saints have actually appeared in quick succession! How incredible!” the 10 Saints exclaimed in emotion.

Ling Han was slightly surprised upon hearing this. ‘Two Saints?’

He strode over, and asked, “Who else has become a Saint?”

“Notionless,” the Torrential Rain Saint replied.

‘Oh, the Notionless Saint has become a Saint again!’

Ling Han didn’t find this strange at all. After all, the Notionless Saint already possessed the complete comprehensions of a Saint. Moreover, he possessed a Five Element Body now, and he also had an endless supply of alchemical pills. Thus, it was only natural that he had become a Saint sooner than the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. It was just that the Notionless Saint wouldn’t have any more past experience to go off now, and as a result, his cultivation speed would become much, much slower. He would definitely be overtaken by the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden.

In fact, even the Empress and Ling Han would overtake him.

“Where is he?” Ling Han asked. He couldn’t see the Notionless Saint anywhere.

“He left one month after becoming a Saint, and no one knows where he’s gone,” the Torrential Rain Saint replied. He didn’t dare to act senior before Ling Han. Of course he didn’t! Even the Star Sand Saint had to treat Ling Han as an equal, so if he dared to act senior, then wouldn’t he be looking down on his own master?

Ling Han frowned upon hearing this. He was aware of the Notionless Saint’s will to exact revenge on his three traitorous disciples. However, the Notionless Saint had also mentioned before that after so many years, his three disciples had most likely all become Saints already.

As such, victory wasn’t assured if he went by himself.

However, he had set off already, so it wouldn’t make a difference regardless of how worried Ling Han felt. He could only hope that the Notionless Saint wouldn’t come across any troubles. In any case, he was a Small Saint, so it would be extremely difficult for others to kill him unless he stubbornly battled to the death himself.

Boom!

Heavenly tribulation was devastating, and this was more so the case for those advancing to the Genesis Tier. After enduring this heavenly tribulation, one would receive the recognition of heaven and earth. In some way, this signified that they were the envoys of heaven and earth. Thus, this tribulation was extremely difficult to overcome.

Fortunately, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden had received the inheritance of the three Phoenix Kings, and thus her battle prowess was far superior to what it was before. She was able to withstand her heavenly tribulation with ease.

Half a day passed, and her heavenly tribulation finally came to an end. The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden immediately unfurled a golden path and went to Ling Han’s side. Although she had still suffered some minor wounds, they were of absolutely no significance.

“Congratulations, fellow cultivator!” the nine Small Saints said to the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden as they clasped their hands in congratulations. Since she was already a Saint, they naturally had to treat her as an equal.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden nodded with a modest smile. She wasn’t as proud as the Empress, and she was still fairly polite toward other people. Right now, she appeared timid and gentle as she stood beside Ling Han, and this caused the other Saints to all feel envious. It was already difficult enough for one to become a Saint, much less find a partner who was also a Saint.

Ling Han was bound to become a Saint, and at that time, both husband and wife would be a Saint. This was incredibly rare!

“Ling Han!” the Empress suddenly called.

Ling Han’s expression involuntarily became strange. ‘It can’t be this coincidental, can it?’

“You’re also going to break through?” he asked with his divine sense.

“Mm-hm,” the Empress replied with a nod.

‘I was right!’

Ling Han waved his hand and let the Empress out of the Black Tower.

The Empress immediately took a step, striding to where the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden had endured her heavenly tribulation just then.

Rumble!

The thunderclouds that had just disappeared started to gather above her again.

“...” Star Sand Saint.

“...” Nine Small Saint.

‘Do Saints come wholesale in your family? They’re going to endure heavenly tribulation one after another?’

Thinking back to the past, which of them hadn’t needed to experience countless years of cultivation and accumulation? Only then had they been able to release all of their accumulated comprehensions at once and break through to become a Genesis Tier Saint. However, it was as if these young cultivators were on steroids, enabling them to break through to the Genesis Tier in quick succession in just a few dozen years.

To compare themselves to these people would indeed drive them nuts!

“This...!” The Star Sand Saint suddenly exclaimed. The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s heavenly tribulation had been extremely ordinary. However, something was slightly off now. This woman’s heavenly tribulation appeared to be far too terrifying. In fact, it was so terrifying that even he felt a cold chill run down his spine.

Meanwhile, the nine Small Saints involuntarily took a step back. This heavenly tribulation was yet to fall, yet their hair was already standing on ends in apprehension.

Crack!

The first bolt of lightning crashed down, transforming into a humanoid war god as it did so. Upon materializing, it immediately thrust the spear in its hand toward the Empress.

“Gasp!”

The nine Small Saints were stunned. “This strike is enough to kill any of us!”

Just how powerful were they? Even Medium Saints would find it incredibly difficult to kill them with a single strike. Doing so would require a Great Saint! No wonder the Star Sand Saint had exclaimed in astonishment. This heavenly tribulation was on the level of Great Saints!

‘Heavens! Is this really a heavenly tribulation for someone who’s only just advancing to the Genesis Tier?’

If the nine Saints came across a Great Saint, they would still have the ability to flee even if they were unable to rival them. However, heavenly tribulation was a test from heaven and earth. Who could escape this test?

To face the attack of a Great Saint as a Small Saint would only yield one result—death. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

However, the Empress was completely unafraid as she flipped her slender hands and unleashed celestial technique after celestial technique to clash with her heavenly tribulation. In fact, she showed no signs of struggle.

The Saints were rendered speechless upon seeing this. ‘You’ve only just become a Small Saint, yet you’re already rivaling the attacks of a Great Saint? Is there still any sense in this world?’

Just then, they had still been thinking about how they had missed the biggest gem in the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. Now, however, they realized that they had missed an even bigger gem. This was a supreme prodigy that even Gu Daoyi had absolutely no hope of matching!

Crack, crack, crack!

Bolts of tribulation lightning continued to crash down, forming more and more humanoid bolts of lightning. Each of them possessed the power of a Great Saint, and they were more so impossible to completely destroy. They would immediately regather upon being smashed apart, and it was clear that they were indestructible and undying.

When the number of lightning humanoids reached 50, they finally underwent a qualitative change, and were able to completely suppress the Empress.

“Humph!” The Empress shot a piercing gaze at the lightning humanoids.

Swish, swish, swish!

Several figures leaped out from within her—these were her nine doppelgangers. The 10 Empresses then immediately started to fight their heavenly tribulation together.
