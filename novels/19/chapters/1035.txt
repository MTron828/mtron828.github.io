Chapter 1036: The Unfortunate Pei Ji

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Put down the stone slab and we can spare you!” the Gray Cloud Octopus uttered coldly. Her whole head of tentacles was lightly dancing. At first, they were only about a foot long, but now, they extended to about three meters long, just as if they were spiritual serpents.

Demon Faced Crab, Black Armoured Prawn, the giant turtle, and the seahorse were all staring at Ling Han, their eyes extremely unfriendly.

Although this human’s physique was very amazing, it was definitely not something that could not be broken through. If that had not been the case, he would not have been throwing up blood continuously when he had been on the receiving end of their combined attacks just now. Even if that stone slab possessed the special effect of absorbing attacks, it was only about the size of a human palm. At most, it would only be capable of protecting one vital point.

In terms of battle prowess, the five of them were at a complete advantage, and if they worked together, they would still be able to easily eliminate this human.

Ling Han snickered, and said, “Let’s exchange a few blows first!”

He took the initiative to charge, brandishing his sword in an attack.

“Damn it!” The five Demonic Beasts all flew into rage, and they shot out their respective attacks at Ling Han.

Ling Han’s purpose was to test out the uses of this stone slab. After all, he had hidden in the Black Tower previously, and thus had only gotten very vague information.

Peng, peng, peng, peng. The attacks shot over, and Ling Han took out the stone slab to block to the right and parry on the left, instantly absorbing the various attacks. It was like a sponge soaking in water, making no sound and frighteningly quiet.

He was involuntarily surprised. His physique was very tough, but after enduring an attack that exceeded the limits of his power, he would still be forced back or even be sent flying, completely unlike now when he was able to disperse even the attack from an elite cultivator at the peak stage of consummate level.

This was too inconceivable.

However, though the stone slab’s effect was unnatural, with the combined attacks from five great elites, Ling Han could not possibly handle everything, and still suffered quite a number of attacks, causing him to once again throw up blood repetitively.

His purpose was to test out the stone slab, and since he already knew the effects, there was naturally no further purpose to continue the battle for no reason.

“Hmm?”

Ling Han was just about to enter into the Black Tower when he saw another person enter into the treasure trove.

What first came into sight was the legs that looked like tree roots constructed of innumerable metal rods. Then, it was an old man, who had lost the lower half of his body, and it was connected atop these metal rods.

Pei Ji!

Obviously, he, too, had discovered that a pillar of light had shot skywards from here, and thought that a secret treasure had appeared. Hence, he had rushed here with all impatience.

“Big Brother Pei, great! Quick, come and help me block these people!” Ling Han called out loudly.

“Ling Han!” Pei Ji couldn’t help but be surprised. He had never imagined that he would see Ling Han here. Was this brat a portent of calamity for him? Why was it that he would see the latter everywhere he went?

Ling Han pounced over, but at the instant he neared, he flashed right into the Black Tower.

Immediately, Gray Cloud Octopus, Demon Faced Crab, and the other great elites all turned their eyes to Pei Ji.

“Where’s the brat?” they asked icily. If that stone slab could be used appropriately, then the value it exhibited would be incredibly astonishing.

Pei Ji was baffled. At first, he had thought Ling Han was mocking him by calling him ‘Big Brother’, but when he saw the extremely unfriendly eyes of these five, he knew that he had been done in by Ling Han.

Ling Han had diverted the disaster onto him!

Damn it, exactly what utterly horrible thing had that brat done that it would implicate him as well?

“Hoho, I shall not lie to you. Not only am I not friends with that damnable brat, we are enemies. I, too, want to kill him and delight in his death afterwards!” Pei Ji took a few steps back, not daring to be the slightest bit careless.

He was even more displeased internally. If it were not for the fact that his two pseudo Sun Moon Tier puppets had been snatched away by Ling Han for some inexplicable reason, he would’ve been able to easily suppress these five animals, so what need would there be for him to be as cautious as he was now?

“Humph, the words of humans should never be trusted!” Demon Faced Crab said coldly.

“That’s right. Though this old man is already crippled, and does not have much youthful vitality, either, he is still an existence of the consummate level, after all. Devouring his blood essence would still be a little nutritious.” Gray Cloud Octopus stretched out her foot-long tongue and licked her lips.

Pei Ji was stunned, and quickly went into a defensive position. He said, “Everyone, I am not one easily to be trifled with, either. If you want to kill me, at least one of you would die with me!”

“Is that right?!” The five Demonic Beasts made their moves at the same time, and attacked Pei Ji simultaneously.

Peng! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The moment they made their move, Pei Ji was completely at a disadvantage, and ended up being horribly thrashed by the five Demonic Beasts.

His battle prowess only matched his cultivation level, or was even a bit weaker than that. The majority of Demonic Beasts, though, could reach the standard of battle prowess they should have; a great many even possessed battle prowess that exceeded their cultivation levels by a star because of their tenacious body and unique anatomy.

Hence, with only him against a large number of enemies, and furthermore being dominated in terms of battle prowess, Pei Ji was naturally even worse off.

“Pu!”

He spat out blood madly. As a puppeteer, he himself was weak in actual battle. However, his strongest two puppets had been taken by Ling Han, so he had only had a few puppets left to cover him while he fled, but they were all in the low extreme.

This kind of puppet absolutely could not dive into the deep sea, and they had long been crushed by the underwater pressure. Furthermore, he could not store them into his Spatial Spirit Tool. Hence, he was really all by himself now.

The situation now was practically disadvantageous to him to the utmost.

“A mere human!”

“Just a human!”

The five Demonic Beasts all smirked coldly. Pei Ji’s inability to withstand a single blow finally helped them recover their lost confidence. The brat just now was after all an exceptional case, and the majority of humans were still “normal”.

Pei Ji was extremely depressed. He had not seen any treasures after rushing all the way here, and was now being targeted by the combined attacks of five elites. This was practically baffling, and extremely depressing.

That despicable brat, it was all his fault! His fault entirely!

“Hundred Flowers Dancing Wildly!” Pei Ji delivered a powerful move. Innumerable metal legs bloomed like they were the petals of a flower, the power of the attack extremely shocking. What mood did he have to linger in the battle? He planned to deliver a powerful move to cut a path of blood out and flee.

Whatever treasure there was, he did not want it anymore!

“Humph!” Turtle stepped out to block his attack. His body shook, and instantly became a few times bigger, forcibly taking this attack head on.

Peng, peng, peng, peng . A series of attacks fell, but merely created brilliant sparks on that turtle’s back, completely unable to break through his defenses.

Turtle was the Demonic Beast with the strongest defenses; there was practically none that could match it.

Pei Ji almost spat out blood. He had shot out a powerful move, yet only one the elites from the other side was enough to block it forcefully.

“Die!” Demon Faced Crab and the other three immediately followed through with an attack.

Shua , countless octopus tentacles stretched out, while giant crab pincers and prawn pincers clamped down. They were all covered with divine patterns, and flickered with divine light.

“Ah...!!!” Pei Ji released a horrible scream. Though he was defending with all his might, there were too many enemies, and they were too strong. One of his arms was instantly cut off, and over a dozen bloody holes appeared on his chest. Thankfully, his vital points had been missed. Otherwise, he would definitely have died with their single attack.

The five great Demonic Beasts did not pull any punches. Another attack blasted over, intending to end Pei Ji’s life.

“Apologies, this person is guilty of terrible crimes, and I must kill him personally!” Ling Han appeared, the Ultimate Arrow already activated.

The five great Demonic Beasts all felt their hair stand on ends... if they had any. This arrow made them feel a powerful threat. If they did not defend with all their might, even they would be severely injured, or possibly even instantly killed.

Without waiting for them to form their second thought, xiu , the arrow had already shot forth with all its fury.

“No!” Pei Ji only managed to widen his eyes, and an arrow had shot into his chest. The tail of the arrow flashed past, and directly flew out through his back.
