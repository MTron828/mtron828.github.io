Chapter 2322 The passageway crumbles

After You Yuan and the others had gotten the Ancestral King blood, they naturally exited the auction house at the first possible moment, and left via a Transfer Formation.

Though there were two Ninth Lotus elites guarding their group, who knew how many people had set their eyes on the Ancestral King blood? They definitely could not stay too long here.

Ling Han returned to the team. Though everyone was slightly curious where he had gone, they definitely could not connect him with the person who had drawn the waters of calamity to them and who was also the seller of the Ancestral King blood. There was only one word for it: how could Ling Han possibly have so much wealth?

They arrived outside the Transfer Formation, and with a flash of light, xiu, their figures immediately vanished.

“F***, we are too late!” A group of five caught up with them, and they all had Ninth Lotus on their foreheads.

“Where did those people go?” One of them grabbed the guy that managed the Transfer Formation.

“Th-they have gone, gone to Mad Clouds City,” the guy replied shakily, feeling like his whole body was shaking.

“Quick, transfer us over to Mad Clouds City as well,” another Ninth Lotus elite demanded.

The guy looked like he was caught in a dilemma. “Milords, they have not finished the transfer. If another transfer is started at this moment, it is possible that the spatial passageway will be destroyed, and it is unknown where you will end up.”

Pa, a Ninth Lotus elite moved, and directly smashed the guy’s head into mush. He looked menacingly at another servant, and asked, “He was not obedient. What about you?”

“I am obedient! I am obedient!” The servant hurriedly started the Transfer Formation. Xiu, the Transfer Formation activated. After a flash of light surged past, the five of them immediately vanished. But only after a while, a loud bang rang out. The Transfer Formation actually exploded, and as the power of Space surged out in a wave, this town was practically razed to the ground.

And in the spatial passageway, Ling Han and his group felt a sudden tremor. A strong wave suddenly appeared in space, and all of them could not stand firmly, continuously swaying to and fro.

“Oh no, the spatial passageway is about to explode. We must immediately tear a rip in space and flee!” Qi Shuang and Yuan both paled in shock. If space really exploded, and the destructive force swept past, there would be no one that would be spared aside from Ancestral Kings at minimum. The two Ninth Lotus elites hurriedly exerted their full efforts, and tore a hole in space. The whole group hurriedly leapt out.

However, what was a spatial passageway?

Traveling three meters here could possibly correspond to a distance of tens of thousands of km outside, and only in that way would journeying time be saved. Hence, the time that everyone felt outside was also different. As long as there was the slightest bit of difference, where they arrived in the outside world would also be overwhelmingly far apart.

Ling Han naturally grabbed Hu Niu and the other women. Worse come to worst, he would also draw the three women into the Black Tower, but it could not be done with a random Spatial God Tool. It was extremely possible that it would suddenly shatter, and if a Spatial God Tool exploded in the void, all the people and items inside would be scattered to who knew where.

Xiu, xiu, xiu. One after another, they were thrown out of the spatial passageway, and a boundless distance was between every single one of them. “Haha, hahahaha!” You Yuan suddenly laughed loudly. At present, he was inside a small valley, and it was completely silent.

If it was just that, he naturally could not be so excited. However, that bottle of Ancestral King blood was still with him. It was very simplethe price he had paid was highest, so the Ancestral King’s blood was passed to him for safekeeping

They had all decided to use the Transfer Formation to go somewhere else. When they had completely tossed ther followers off their tail, they would then decide how this bottle of Ancestral King blood would be split among them and how much each person was entitled

to.

But now, everyone had disappeared, and he naturally had no further need to share the Ancestral King’s blood with others.

It should be known that when the spatial passageway exploded, anything could be destroyed. Then it would be nothing strange if there was a bottle of Ancestral King blood that was destroyed as well, right?

“Ba, make sure you don’t die!” he declared with menacing eyes as he uncorked the bottle without hesitation, and rubbed the Ancestral King blood on himself. He opened all the pores on his body to absorb the energy essence contained within.

With a cultivation level like his, he could not directly consume the Ancestral King blood, but rather had to absorb it through his skin. Otherwise, even if it had been refined, it could still easily cause him to explode.

He wanted to immediately break through to the Eleventh Leaf. As long as he had taken this step, his battle prowess would soar to the Ninth Lotus, and killing Ling Han would naturally be an easy matter by then.

Once, twice, three times... He only had to rub a bit of Ancestral King blood every time. If he rubbed too much, he would firstly not be able to bear it, which would be equivalent to committing suicide, and secondly, the essence inside the Ancestral King blood would disperse rapidly with the passing of time, causing an astronomical waste.

He had long since attained Tenth Leaf’s peak stage. Every time he absorbed the Ancestral King’s blood, his stores of energy would increase slightly.

When there were just a few drops left of the Ancestral King blood, a frightening aura suddenly surged within his body. It was like a wild tsunami wave in the ocean. Peng, peng, peng, wherever the aura passed, all the mountain rocks around him were shattered into bits.

Kuang, thunderclouds gathered densely in the skies. The heavenly tribulation was here.

He took his final step in the Immortal Palace Tier, and advanced to the height of Eleventh Secret. As long as he survived the heavenly tribulation, his cultivation level would be comparable to the Ascending Origin Tier! Even if there was an astonishing gap between the three minor levels of the Ascending Origin Tier, the battle prowess of a Monarch Star would still be enough to overwhelm someone who had achieved Minor Accomplishment in the Ascending Origin Tier.

“Come! Come!” You Yuan laughed madly with his figure shooting into the air, meeting the heavenly tribulation of his own volition. He could no longer hold himself back. After enduring the heavenly calamity, he would set out to find Ling Han, and tear that detestable guy into pieces while taking advantage of this opening when their group had yet to reunite.

Not too far away, five Ninth Lotus elites cast their eyes over.

“Someone is enduring a heavenly tribulation?”

“It can’t be that those guys have used the Ancestral King blood, and have now begun to break through, right?”

“F***, we have to immediately rush there.” These five people naturally were those people that had forcefully started the Transfer Formation and the culprits that had caused the spatial passageway to crumble. They were completely unharmed because they were all at the Ninth Lotus. Very soon, they had gathered once more, and continued to search for the whereabouts of the group from Hundred Battles Academy.

Their figures darted quickly, and soon arrived at the valley where You Yuan was undergoing the heavenly tribulation. “This is a great Ninth-Lotus tribulation!”

“Strange, I clearly have not sensed any qualitative change in Spiritual Power.”

“Gasp!”

“Eighth Lotus Eleventh Leaf!” all five of them exclaimed simultaneously.

Only an Eighth Lotus Eleventh Leaf’s battle prowess would directly soar to the Ninth Lotus in a situation when there was no change to his Spiritual Power.

“That’s right.” You Yuan’s figure descended. He had already finished his heavenly tribulation. His eyes swept over them, and he asked calmly, “There is no way that the spatial passageway would explode for no reason. Was it because of you people?”

He was a Monarch Star, and not only did he have astonishingly high natural talent in cultivation, his intelligence and wits were naturally top-grade as well. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

If he had still been a Tenth Leaf, he naturally could only have fled immediately, but now he had advanced into the Eleventh Leaf, so his cultivation level was comparable to the Nine Lotus, and his battle prowess overpowered even peak stage Ninth Lotus First Leaf, so he naturally had utter confidence.

“Hand over the Ancestral King blood!” a Ninth Lotus elite demanded calmly.

“Yi, isn’t this guy that arrogant profligate from the auction house?” Someone “recognized” You Yuan.

“That’s right, it is this guy!” The five of them were all overjoyed. This guy had obtained who knew how much celestial medicines, and even if they were not as valuable as the Ancestral King blood, it was still enough to make anyone drool.

“Haha, this is really our gift from the heavens!”

They dispersed, surrounding You Yuan.

A muscle involuntarily twitched in You Yuan’s cheek. Who exactly was that bastard that had screwed him over? If he really had gotten so many celestial medicines, he would’ve conceded, but the crux of the matter was that he was merely an innocent scapegoat for another. He was really too displeased with this.

“Hand over the celestial medicines and the Ancestral King’s blood!” the five declared coldly. “And then we can leave your corpse intact!”
