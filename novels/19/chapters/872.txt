Chapter 873: The Harder You Fall

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ding Feiwen experienced a full-body shiver; how could this be!? How was this possible!?

Wasn’t Ding Ping just a piece of trash that only had some brute strength? On what basis did he manage to obtain the favor of a figure so lofty that even such ultimate elites like Jie Wu would have to kneel down to pay their respects to!?

Even Jie Wu was so, so what was a mere disciple of the Crimson Sun Sect worth?

“Ling Han? Yi, this name seems kind of familiar!” someone mumbled.

“That’s right; feels like I heard it before somewhere.”

“Should be an elite, right?”

“Of course, if he’s not an elite, why would Lord Jie show such great respect?”

Everyone was discussing in low voice. This scene was really too shocking, and also spurred much curiosity amongst the spectators. Who on earth was this Ling Han?

Jie Wu stood, humphed, and said, “Insolence, to dare to rashly discuss the emperor, do you all want to die?”

All of a sudden, complete silence descended!

The emperor!

That was right, didn’t the current emperor precisely have the surname of Ling with the given name of Han?

When one spoke of this emperor, who would not willingly proclaim their submission? He was the one who had united the middle state and the four regions, and had even absorbed the four seas into his territory—he was the first in all of history!

Ding Ping... had actually been taken under the wing of the emperor!

‘F***!’

Ye Yuan’s beautiful eyes immediately shone. This was a real wealthy husband; if she could marry Ding Ping, how high would the status she could attain be? Did you not see how even Jie Wu wanted to kneel to pay his respects?

Putting aside the others, even Ding Ping had a scare. He had only guessed that Ling Han had to have a formidable background, but no matter what, he would not have guessed that the latter was the emperor of the Great Ling Empire! This was too unimaginable.

... The greatest person in this world actually came to a small place like theirs here?

“You may dispense with the courtesies, sirs.” Ding Ping kept up an appearance of being unperturbed as he thought he definitely could not allow his master’s name to be tarnished.

“Thank you, Young Master!” Jie Wu and Liu Zhenshi both replied respectfully. Although they could not see what was special about Ding Ping, merely in terms of conduct, Ding Ping was better than Ding Feiwen by who knew how many times. Indeed, this was the real one they sought.

The other members of the Ding Clan finally came to realize that Ding Ping this time had really become so impressive and awesome that his awesomeness level had spiked sky high!

‘Quick, quick, quick, we have to quickly amend the mistakes we made earlier as soon as possible!’

“Ding Feiwen, do you know your crime?” the patriarch of the Ding Clan immediately shouted, and looked darkly at Ding Feiwen. This brat actually dared to boss him around just now; if you really were the disciple of a great elite of the Crimson Sun Sect, he would force down his anger, but now?

‘F***, just wait obediently to be dealt with!’

Ding Feiwen knelt down with a pa ; he also knew that he was horribly harmed by this misunderstanding! Who would have imagined that Ding Ping was actually so awesome to be able to take Ling Han as his master? This was what had caused everyone to misunderstand and raise him to a very high pedestal, but the f******* higher he was raised, the harder he would fall!

Oh no, oh no, he was really done for this time.

“I... I... Spare me, Lord Patriarch!” He was already crying. He could feel darkness envelop his vision. Whom had he offended? The disciple of the emperor, a person that even Jie Wu had to kneel down to pay respects to!

“Ding Ping, what do you think should be done?” the patriarch of the Ding Clan asked Ding Ping quickly, his face all smiles.

As the saying went, “when a man achieves the Dao, his poultry and dogs rise to Heaven as well” [1. An idiom, it means once a man gets an important position, all his cronies would be raised to high positions as well.]. With Ding Ping as their signboard, wouldn’t they all be able to move unhindered in this Great Ling Empire?

Ding Ping was neither arrogant nor impatient, and said, “Just deal with him as he should be dealt with in accordance with the rules of the clan.” His horizons had, in that instant, been expanded further than ever before, disdaining to even bother with Ding Feiwen. However, his disdain did not mean that he would let Ding Feiwen get off scot-free.

This person was petty and hateful, using public office to avenge private resentments; there was naturally a need to punish him.

The patriarch of the Ding Clan felt the matter was a little difficult to handle; weren’t the rules of the clan also decided by people? So, should he make the punishment lighter, or heavier? Err, he had better make the punishment heavier. Even saints had a temper, and Ding Feiwen had previously treated Ding Ping like that... any other person wouldn’t be able to tolerate it, right?

Moreover, he was still angry himself!

“Take him away first, and imprison him in the dungeons to be dealt with later!”

“Yes, Lord Patriarch!”

Ding Feiwen screamed, hurriedly begging for mercy from Ding Ping. “Brother Ping, save me! On the basis of our previous friendship, I beg you to save me, I will definitely work extremely hard for you in the future!”

The members of the Ding Clan were all disdainful; how could there be something as good as that?

To work extremely hard for the disciple of the nation’s leader, that would be a hundredfold nobler and better than even the likes of Jie Wu’s status as sect leader, right? And he called that mercy? That was too shameless!

Ding Ping was naturally unperturbed. He had already seen through the true character of this vile person.

Ding Feiwen cried out and begged for mercy, but no one paid him any heed. He was dragged out, his cries becoming softer and softer till they could no longer be heard.

“Big Brother Ping!” Ye Yuan walked over, her beautiful eyes filled with adoration. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Ding Ping merely cast a look at her, his heart filled with an indescribable serenity.

In the past, he’d only needed to look at this woman and he would feel heartfelt happiness, becoming excited. But from the moment he had seen through her real character, his first love had completely ended, leaving behind only bitter memories.

In a mere day’s time, he had experienced all the ups and downs of life, which also caused him to rapidly mature.

He paid her no heed, and merely said to Jie Wu and Liu Zhenshi, “Many thanks to both of you for coming to visit me, milords. I am grateful!” If they had not done so, he would not have been able to avoid the punishment of three hundred strikes of the staff.

“Hehe, it is what we should do,” Jie Wu and Liu Zhenshi both replied humbly. Although Ding Ping’s current ability was incredibly weak, since he could be taken as disciple by Ling Han, they believed that he would definitely become an elite that could shake the whole world in future.

Ye Yuan was naturally unwilling to lose this kind of wealthy husband; she continuously talked from the side about all the experiences they had shared in the past, wanting to stir Ding Ping’s memories so that his old affection for her would be reignited.

She was also very resentful; if it had been a day later, then Ding Ping would have only thought that she had broken the betrothal contract with him only under pressure from her clan.

... A woman like her would only lay the blame on others, and have completely no intention of reflecting on her own wrongs.

Yet Ding Ping had already given up on her, and ignored her completely. In the end, unable to bear her continued pestering, he chased out all three members of the Ye Clan. However, Ye Yuan was obviously not going to drop the matter so easily; after a few days, she would definitely return again.

After conversing for a while, Jie Wu and Liu Zhenshi both begged their leave and departed, saying as they left that no matter what Ding Ping encountered in future, he could seek them out for help to solve the issue. These words were naturally aimed at the members of the Ding Clan—you all had best behave yourselves, for he was the disciple of the emperor himself!

Soon afterward, the Ding Clan naturally worshipped Ding Ping like he was their ancestor.

Ling Han did not pay this matter any further attention; he only kept looking for the location of Corpse Boss. The fact that the latter would appear here clearly meant that there had to be some treasure here that was worth his appearance, or that the surviving members of the Thousand Corpse Sect were nearby.

On the second day, Ding Ping came to look for him, his attitude even more respectful, and also looked extremely grateful. His fate had been altered by Ling Han; without Ling Han, he would still be that fallen genius and a piece of trash.

Ling Han did not say much more, and merely guided him on the cultivation of the Nine Dragons Tyrant Body Art.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed. Ling Han’s eyes suddenly snapped open from his position of sitting cross-legged on the ground. He sensed a very powerful aura. It was very vague, but how could it possibly evade his senses?

Corpse Boss had appeared!
