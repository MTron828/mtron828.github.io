Chapter 2117: My Hands Are Getting Tired From this Rich Harvest

Because he already had a wealth of previous experience, Ling Han was able to easily resolve the conflict between the six Source Powers. They each settled in an area of his Dantian.

Anyhow, he had finally obtained a Source Power of each of the Five Elements. His Great Clash of Source Powers could now unleash its full might.

“Stop congratulating yourself, hurry up and get a move on,” Small Tower said in impatience. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ling Han nodded in reply. He had no time to investigate the uses of the Black Tortoise Chaos Origin Soil as he stood up to leave.

Several hours later, they arrived on the bank of a wide river.

This was an extraordinary river, in that its contents weren’t water. Instead, it was filled with tumultuous lightning.

It was obvious that this led to a Source Power of Lightning.

Ling Han involuntarily thought of the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire. At that time, he had followed a river of lightning before discovering the resting place of his divine sense. How was he doing now? Had he recovered his Immortal Palace Tier cultivation?

It would be extremely difficult for him to exact revenge, right? After all, he had seemingly offended an Ascending Origin Tier elite. Regardless of how prodigious the Heavenly Emperor of Thunder and Fire was, it would still take him millions of years to reach the Ascending Origin Tier, right?

This was taking into account the fact that he was already a prodigy among prodigies.

Ling Han rid himself of these random thoughts. The Source Power of Lightning was another Source Power that he didn’t possess. If he obtained it, he would once again grow significantly more powerful.

“Has anyone obtained nine Source Powers before?” he suddenly asked in curiosity.

“Yes!” Small Tower replied without any hesitation.

“Who?”

“The original owner of the Black Tower,” Small Tower replied. There was a hint of melancholy in his voice.

Ling Han was instantly rendered speechless. It was largely because he practiced the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll that he was able to obtain six Source Powers of heaven and earth. Otherwise, if he relied on himself… perhaps he couldn’t even obtain a single Source Power.

In comparison, the gulf between him and the original owner of the Black Tower was extremely evident.

“Don’t lose heart!” Small Tower said. “The Heavenly Venerate was able to obtain nine Source Powers of heaven and earth simply because he severed his own cultivation after reaching the Ninth Heaven. Before starting his new life, he had already created the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll.”

Ling Han was astonished upon hearing this. As it turned out, Ji Wuming wasn’t the only Ninth Heaven Celestial King to sever his own cultivation?

However, this also made him feel much better. At the very least, that person also hadn’t been able to obtain nine Source Powers of heaven and earth from the very start.

He strode forward, and it wasn’t long before he reached the end of the lightning river. A pool of lightning appeared before him, and within it were arcs of crackling blue lightning liquid.

“Limitless Yin Lightning!” Small Tower said.

“Same old rules?” Ling Han asked.

“Mm-hm.”

Ling Han started to absorb the Source Power.

With the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, absorbing Source Powers of heaven and earth was no difficult task. The problem right now was time. Ling Han didn’t have much time to waste.

After nine entire days, Ling Han finally managed to arouse and absorb this Source Power of heaven and earth.

“My first four Source Powers of heaven and earth all took exorbitant effort to obtain. Now, however, it’s as if I can obtain them with a nod of my head. Sigh… This comparison makes me feel depressed,” Ling Han said with emotion.

“Stop acting pitiful after you’ve received a benefit!” Small Tower scolded.

Ling Han chuckled upon hearing this. Anyhow, if one didn’t need to, who would want to spend an exorbitant amount of effort? However, things were genuinely far too easy now. He couldn’t help but sigh with emotion.

Following the guidance of Small Tower, he started to search for the fifth Source Power of heaven and earth.

“Huh?” After walking for a short while, Ling Han came to a stop.

There was a corpse before him.

It was extremely normal to come across corpses here. After all, this was an ancient battlefield, so it would be strange if there was no corpse. However, this corpse… was extremely peculiar. Even though it was humanoid, its features were extremely strange.

It had a pair of cow hooves, and its body was also pitch-black and covered in scales. There was a pair of thin cicada wings on its back, and its gigantic eyes almost took up half of its face. Meanwhile, its mouth was as thin and long as the mouth of a mosquito, and it was already beyond what could be called a mouth. Calling it an arthropod’s mouthpart would be more fitting.

Ling Han had come across beings from numerous races before. Regarding those that could shapeshift, even though they would maintain some features of their race… he definitely hadn’t come across anything like this before.

“This is an elite from the Foreign Realm,” Small Tower suddenly said.

‘Humans from the Foreign Realm look like this?’

“So ugly,” Ling Han remarked.

“This is an 18th Lotus elite. In order to stop him, our realm dispatched four Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. However, even so, one of the Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings was still killed,” Small Tower said.

“Simply to stop him?” Ling Han asked with a solemn expression.

The difficulty of stopping an elite and killing an elite was completely different.

If even stopping a person required four elites of an equivalent level, especially paramount beings such as Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, just how powerful were the elites from the Foreign Realm?

“Yes, simply to stop him,” Small Tower replied in a stern voice. “You can also appreciate the grave nature of this battle now, right?”

“Is this foreign elite especially powerful, or are they all this powerful?”

“They’re all this powerful!”

Ling Han was genuinely stunned upon hearing this.

Those who could become Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings were all top-notch prodigies. Even if there was a gap in abilities between them, this gap shouldn’t be large. However, any random elite from the Foreign Realm could rival four elites from the Celestial Realm. It was no wonder that the Celestial Realm could only choose to defend, and not counterattack. It was no wonder that they couldn’t comprehensively defeat the storm of darkness.

“Moreover, this is taking into account the fact that the elites from the Foreign Realm experience suppression from our heaven and earth after entering the Celestial Realm. Otherwise… they’ll be even more powerful!” Small Tower revealed an even more brutal fact.

‘Thank heavens!’

Ling Han nodded in understanding. Thank heavens the Celestial Realm hadn’t counterattacked. Otherwise, they would have faced a one-sided massacre.

“Hmm? The Ancient Realm has been split into two, the Immortal Realm and the Netherworld. Is this because of the Foreign Realm?” Ling Han suddenly recalled this question that had bothered him for a long time.

“Yes, but also no,” Small Tower replied. This was a confusing answer.

‘F*ck! If it is, then it is. If it isn’t, then it isn’t. What kind of answer is this?’

“The Ancient Realm being split into two was indeed related to the invasion of the Foreign Realm. However, that was only a trigger. The fundamental reason was still related to the Celestial Realm itself,” Small Tower explained.

“What reason is that?” Ling Han asked.

“This involves Heavenly Venerates, so it’s best that you don’t ask,” Small Tower replied. It refused to answer Ling Han’s question.

‘Related to Heavenly Venerates again!’

However, this made sense. If not Heavenly Venerates who had transcended the Regulations of heaven and earth, who else could split the Ancient Realm into two? Moreover, only at the command of Heavenly Venerates would the entire Celestial Realm obey and follow. This was why no one dared to bring those from the Ancient Realm into the Celestial Realm.

However, there was something else that Ling Han was curious about. What was the reason for this?

They were already paramount Heavenly Venerates, so how could they be afraid of a few people ascending from the Ancient Realm?

However, this involved those three old monsters, so Small Tower definitely wouldn’t indulge his curiosity. Otherwise, if they dared to speak the name or title of those three Heavenly Venerates, a wisp of their awareness would descend. At that time, things would truly become troublesome.

“Forget about it. Let’s obtain the Source Powers of heaven and earth first!”

Ling Han continued to advance. Three days later, he obtained the fifth Source Power of heaven and earth, the Heavenly Sun Black Gold. However, it was a shame that he already had no need for this Source Power. He placed it inside the Black Tower, and this process made him involuntarily tense up. He was afraid of attracting the attention of those three old monsters.

“Alright, even if there are more Source Powers of heaven and earth that you can’t use, you can’t place them inside the Black Tower anymore. Even though there’s a 90 percent chance that it won’t be discovered, the more risks you take, the higher the chance of being discovered,” Small Tower said in a solemn voice. It prevented Ling Han from taking any further risks.

Ling Han pondered for a moment before nodding in agreement.

The Empress and Hu Niu could both obtain a Source Power of heaven and earth. In any case, they couldn’t use a Source Power of heaven and earth to act as their divided soul anymore. As such, having one more or one less wouldn’t make too much difference.

“There’s still a Source Power of Slaughter ahead!”
