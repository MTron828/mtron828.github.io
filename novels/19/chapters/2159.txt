Chapter 2160: The Peach Blossom Origins

Next, Ling Han planned to first pick up his parents, Helian Xunxue, and the others. Then, he would venture to the Heavenly Saint Palace to visit his son, and learn that omnipresent technique while he was there, and then head off to the Imperial Void Sect.

He did not have any positive feelings towards the Sealed Emotion Palace or the Imperial Void Sect, so entering into the Imperial Void Sect was firstly a stepping stone for him—to investigate that mysterious Sealed Emotion Palace—and secondly, he wanted to rob the complete treasure trove of this great sect.

Whatever the case, they had to pay a little interest first.

He used the Regulations of Space, and added the Regulations of Time, and his whole person had become ethereal. Time and space seemed to be completely warped, and the burst of speed he gained was astonishingly fast.

He then tried on those straw sandals, and once they were activated,?xiu, his speed increased in a burst of 10 times over!

This allowed his speed to be capable of matching the Ascending Origin Tier!

Ling Han couldn’t help but smile in satisfaction. Now, as long as it was not a Celestial King that moved against him, he would not need to duck into the Black Tower for any kind of attack he faced. He could completely oppose the attack with the techniques that he presently possessed.

However, even the extreme speed of the Ascending Origin Tier could not possibly compare to the means of a Celestial King Tier. Ling Han used a whole seven months’ time to finally return to the Roc Heaven.

It was still the same heaven and earth, but Ling Han’s feelings were completely different.

The Roc Palace had initially been the most powerful force of the Roc Heaven. In fact, in the whole Western Celestial Realm, it could be ranked in the higher echelons. However, now the master of the Roc Heaven had become the Four Seas Palace, and the flags that belonged to the Four Seas Palace were raised all over the territory that had originally belonged to the Roc Palace.

All the locals were forced to switch to worshipping the Four Seas Palace, and believing in Shang Zhiwei.

Belief was a kind of power. This was not a power of the heaven and earth, but rather one unearthed from multiple generations of descendants. One person’s power was negligible, but after they were all gathered together, a mighty power could be created that would make even elites stunned.

However, this kind of power could only be used by Celestial Kings. Because it did not belong to the power of the heaven and earth, and was outside of Regulations, ordinary cultivators could not possibly draw on it. Only Celestial Kings that had reached the height of the heavens could harvest the power of belief for their own use.

Ling Han shook his head, and released the four women from the Black Tower. Then, with Hu Niu leading the way, they journeyed onwards.

After around 10 days, they arrived at a tall mountain. This place was only a mere 5,000 km from the mountains of the Roc Heaven, and elites would be able to arrive here in just a short while.

“There, Father-in-law and Mother-in-law are in the valley below,” Hu Niu said. Though her wedding with Ling Han had not been held yet, with how she continued on her own way, how could she possibly be concerned about these paltry matters? She was already directly addressing them as father-in-law and mother-in-law.

Ling Han nodded, slightly excited. He actually could not take a step forward.

“Let’s go!” It was the Empress who gave Ling Han a hand, and brought him down the mountain.

Hu Niu was not willing to fall back, and hurriedly snatched Ling Han’s other arm, so Bewitching Maiden Rou could only pout moodily.

Xiu, they descended from the mountain, and entered into the valley.

Goodness, this place… had so many people!

Ling Han had thought that only his parents, Helian Xunxue, and the others would be here. Added together, there would just be a dozen or so of them, but now the people of this valley numbered in the tens of thousands.

“Who goes there?” Someone discovered Ling Han and his group, and immediately shouted, “To actually dare to barge into the Peach Blossom Origins, are you tired of living?”

Ling Han frowned slightly. This person looked to be in his forties, and his cultivation level was the Mountain River Tier. His flame of life had burned for over 3,000 years. If he had been in the Ancient Realm, he definitely could’ve been considered a super genius.

However, in the Celestial Realm, this could only be considered so-so.

This person’s natural talent for cultivation was average, yet he could advance to the Mountain River Tier at around 3,000 years old. He had to have gotten the support of a great volume of cultivation resources, and had practically been forcibly pushed up to this height.

What caused Ling Han to frown was not the problem of this person’s cultivation level, but rather that his attitude was too brash. Even if others accidentally barged in, he absolutely could have chosen to ask the intruder to leave in a peaceful manner. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“My name is Ling Han. Who is the person in charge here? I would like to ask for an audience,” Ling Han said. Because he was about to see his parents, he suppressed his displeasure as well.

“What a joke. You barged into the Peach Blossom Origins, and actually delude yourself into thinking of getting an audience with our Valley Master?” That person scoffed, appearing extremely contemptuous.

“Huaming, what is going on?” Another man walked over. He looked to be in his thirties, yet his cultivation level had reached the Sun Moon Tier. In truth, he was several hundred years older than the previous person, though he looked much younger.

“Granduncle Zilu!” The previous person hurriedly paid his greetings. “These five people barged here, and said they wanted to meet with the grand elder!”

“Haha!” The person who had come after involuntarily laughed coldly, his eyes sweeping over Ling Han and the others. He was just about to rebuke them, yet his eyes suddenly glowed brightly. All of a sudden, he had been captivated by Hu Niu and the others.

“Lord Valley Master is not someone that you can meet just because you wish for it. However, if there is anything, you may speak with me about it. For better or worse, I am at least the protector here,” he declared with great pride.

Ling Han could only feel this was inconceivable. They were clearly just a Mountain River Tier and Sun Moon Tier, so why did they have such a puffed-up opinion of themselves? Could it be that they thought that this was the Ancient Realm, and not the Celestial Realm? Otherwise, how could they have such a powerful superiority complex?

“Is Helian Xunxue here? What about Liu Yu Tong? Or Li Si Chan? Zhu Xuan Er? Shui Yanyu?” Ling Han uttered the names of many people in a single breath.

The person who had come after couldn’t help but inhale sharply. “How dare you, to actually directly address the names of the Lady Matriarchs, you deserve to die 10,000 times over!”

When he spoke of death, he moved aggressively, grabbing out at Ling Han’s chest. He actually wanted to claw out Ling Han’s heart, and kill him.

Ling Han was even more displeased. With a tap of his finger, that person had instantly turned into a wooden statue, and could not even move a single finger.

“How dare you!!”

“To actually dare make a move on the people of the Peach Blossom Origins, don’t you know that we are under the protection of the Roc Palace?”

“Kill him!”

When they saw Ling Han actually dared to move, the people in the vicinity all drew their weapons, surrounding Ling Han and his group. Their main target was still Ling Han. As the four women were all delicate beauties, especially the Empress and Hu Niu, others did not even dare to offend them.

Ling Han humphed, his aura slightly spreading out.?Pa, pa, pa.?These people all immediately stumbled to the ground, their weapons all falling from their hands on the ground.

“Invaders!”

“Move out, defense squad!”

Someone called out loudly, and in only a while, a troop of 100 men appeared. They were all in the Mountain River Tier, and surrounded Ling Han and his group once more. However, they merely surrounded them without attacking. It was unknown whether it was that they had not received any command to attack, or if they were wary of Ling Han’s strength.

A while later, the crowds split apart, and a young man walked out from the path that had been created. He looked to be only in his twenties, and his flame of life had only been burning several hundred years, but his cultivation level had shockingly reached the Genesis Tier, far surpassing every other person here.

…His natural talent for cultivation was extremely outstanding.

This young man was dressed in white robes, and held a paper fan in his hands. His showiness was practically directly in their faces.

“Young Master Long!”

“Now that Young Master Long has appeared, he would definitely be capable of suppressing everything!”

“To dare act insolent in our Peach Blossom Origins, they really have no idea what death is.”

Everyone was cheering loudly, seeming to be filled with confidence in this young man.

The white-robed young man was also extremely proud. First, he glanced disdainfully at Ling Han, and then looked towards Hu Niu and the other women. Astonishing light immediately shot from his eyes. He humphed, and demanded, “You, just commit suicide.”

These words were directed at Ling Han.

Ling Han was shocked. What was going on with these people? Wasn’t this the valley that his parents and the others were residing in? Why were there so many strange weirdos popping out?
