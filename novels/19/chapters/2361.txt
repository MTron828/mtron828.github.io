Chapter 2362: Beaten until bursting

Once Ling Han advanced into the Ascending Origin Tier, his Vitality Index would spike, and unlock his room for evolution.

Void Particle Energy could temper the body, and his physical power began to soar.

The advancement of cultivation level should be very, very slow. It was the process of cooking soup over a slow fire. However, Void Particle Energy was the essence energy of a Genesis World, far surpassing the height of Regulations. If this was used to temper a Ninth Lotus being, the effects would naturally be spectacular.

Ling Han’s physical power began to soar. It had initially only been comparable to the early stage of consummate level of the Ascending Origin Tier, yet it now leaped all the way to the middle stage, and the rate of advancement showed no signs of slowing down, either.

Crack! Crack! Crack!

Thunderclouds spread out densely, bolts of lightning striking madly, turning into multiple giants of lightning as they launched a mad barrage on Ling Han.

But for someone with Ling Han’s physique, this was completely negligible.

Under the tempering of Void Particle Energy, Ling Han’s Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll also released a greater might, increasing the toughness of his physique.

As Ling Han battled the heavenly tribulation fiercely, he roamed at the edge of the cliff, continuously absorbing Void Particle Energy, and increasing his physical power and improving physique.

A day later, the heavenly tribulation had passed, but the thunderclouds had still not dispersed. They were still occasionally building up and dissolving. This was because Ling Han was still using Void Particle Energy to strengthen himself.

The level of this energy was too high. Every once in a while, Ling Han’s strength would increase a bit, and it was a practically visible rate. It was really too fast.

When the deadline of 10 days arrived, only then did he stop with slight dissatisfaction.

He was engrossed in the enjoyment of increasing his strength, and to suddenly stop now made him feel a slight dejection.

‘My present Body Art should have surpassed the peak stage of consummate level of the Ascending Origin Tier.’ Ling Han deduced internally. ‘According to Wally’s Vitality Index, I should be around 4300 points or so, but there is still some distance from 5000 points.’

If one’s Vitality Index reached 5000, they would be a Celestial King.

Ling Han returned, and did not go to his quarters, but rather headed directly to Sword Manifestation Peak.

This was the highest and steepest mountain of Divine Desolate Mountains. From afar, it looked like a solitary sword that was stabbing into the clouds.

Ling Hans strode forwards, getting faster and faster. He did not use the slightest bit of power of Regulation, but as he stepped out, he naturally surged with frightening power of Regulation. Space seemed to have been forcefully compressed, and every step he took was equivalent to a boundless distance.

Peng, peng, peng,?he barged all the way over, without stopping at all. All the mountain rocks that blocked his way were crushed into dust.

Ling Han released a battle cry, his voice ringing out like a heavy hammer, so resounding that bits of rocks were bouncing in the mountains before they, too, were shattered.

He ascended Sword Manifestation Peak, and after traveling quickly for a long while, his steps finally slowed down as he strolled casually like a normal person.

About an hour later, Ling Han arrived at the summit. There was a massive platform here.

Initially, this had been a sharp summit, but it had been sliced off. It should be a deliberate move so it could be used for battle.

A considerable number of people were already standing around the platform. The Empress and the other women, with Little Terror still curled up in Bewitching Maiden Rou’s arms, Huai Jian, Jing Zhongyue, Zi Shuang, and the others. Practically all the disciples that had reached Ninth Lotus had arrived.

Xue Ge was very anxious to get his revenge, so it was natural that he had arrived much earlier. He still maintained the image of a bald man of great build. His arms were crossed behind his back, and as the mountain breeze blew, the robes he wore rustled loudly.

“You are quite late!” he declared coldly.

Ling Han grinned. “So eager to be beaten?”

“Haha!” Xue Ge laughed drily, yet his laughter held no amusement. “Could it be that you still do not know my current cultivation level?” A lotus flower bloomed on his forehead, possessing nine petals and two leaves that were as black as ink. “I am a Ninth Lotus Second Leaf, what about you!”

Now that they had confirmed Xue Ge’s cultivation level was truly Ninth Lotus Second Leaf, those like Feng Hailuan and Sihuang Yun all had grim expressions. In terms of cultivation level, they had already been surpassed by this young junior brother.

Ling Han smiled calmly, and a lotus flower similarly appeared on his forehead. It also had nine petals, but only held a single leaf, and this leaf was extremely blurry at that, almost unformed.

Huai Jian and the others were naturally clear. Ling Han had indeed had some improvement, advancing into the Ninth Lotus, but only had the cultivation level of the early stage of the Ninth Lotus’ First Leaf. In fact, it was the early stage of the early stage at that.

The gap in cultivation level was clear to see. Previously, they were at the same starting line, but now Xue Ge’s leading advantage was already incredibly apparent.

“I can still beat you till you burst,” Ling Han said.

“What wild boasting!” Xue Ge smirked coldly. He knew that Ling Han’s Body Art was amazing, with battle prowess reaching peak stage Ninth Lotus Second Leaf, or even Ninth Lotus Third Leaf. But Xue Ge? He was a supreme monarch star, with battle prowess directly soaring to the late stage or even peak stage of the Ninth Lotus’ Third Leaf.

“Ba, you have been too arrogant. I will definitely make you return what you owe me!”

Xiu

, his figure charged out, as fast as lightning.

Ling Han was calm, casually shooting out a punch.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

He seemed to be neither too fast nor too slow, yet every punch just happened to block Xue Ge’s attacks, and he did not fall into the slightest bit of disadvantage.

‘What?!’

Everyone watched, their eyes wide with shock.

How could this be? They were both supreme monarch stars. In that case, as long as one had an advantage in cultivation level, they would definitely be able to obtain victory in battle.

Ling Han released a battle cry, lightning wrapping around his fists. This was something that he had come up with by fusing Regulations and Body Art together, unleashing an even more terrifying destructive power.

His movements were wide and obvious, the black lotus flower on his forehead swaying, as if it had come to life.

This time, Ling Han had absolutely no interest in playing with Xue Ge move by move. The moment he started, it was his full battle prowess unleashed, suppressing Xue Ge completely.

Everyone could not speak. Ling Han’s strength was inconceivable to them.

He had clearly just advanced into the Ninth Lotus, yet his battle prowess had reached the peak stage of the Ninth Lotus’ Third Leaf, and was in fact just that bit stronger, even. In that case, when he reached the Ninth Lotus’ Third Leaf, wouldn’t he be able to clash even with an Ancestral King?

Xue Ge roared in fury. His expression was filled with disbelief. He had obtained such amazing improvement in a single stroke, yet was still no match for Ling Han. Furthermore, he had always been brimming with confidence, thinking that he could win easily and vent his fury. Who would have expected that reality was completely contrary to his expectations.

He took his original form, a mere Blood Insect that was less than a foot long.?Xiu, xiu, xiu, it was like he was flying with how amazingly fast he bounced as he attempted to break through the limit of what Ling Han could trace visually with his movements.

However, this was all completely wasted effort. By now, Ling Han could battle with his Body Art, his movements keeping on track with his wishes. There was no need for him to draw on Regulations at all, so the speed of his attack would be just that bit faster than that of an opponent of the same cultivation level.

Though it was just a slight bit, could a monarch star afford this minor gap?

Peng!

Ling Han’s punch landed on the Blood Insect. Though the target’s surface was small, the power of his fist was too overbearing, forcefully pummeling the Blood Insect and causing to throw up a mist of blood. Xue Ge was in so much pain that he released an incredibly agonizing wave through his divine sense.

Ling Han did not quit while he was ahead. Who asked this guy to provoke him? If this was not Divine Desolate Mountain, he would definitely deal a fatal blow, and directly erase this damn insect.

“Enough, enough!” Everyone hurriedly approached to mediate.

Ling Han shot a few more punches, and only then did he stop.

After stopping the fight, when everyone looked towards Ling Han, their gazes were completely different. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

This was a strong rival that they could not just circle around. With Ling Han there, a large portion of any future cultivation resources would definitely be going to him.

Meanwhile, Zi Shuang was very regreful. If she had known, she would have formed an alliance with Ling Han. Now, if she spoke of this matter, it would be Ling Han who was stronger, and she would be the weaker party, so she would definitely have to make great sacrifices should they discuss conditions.
