Chapter 3505: Catching thief

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

When they arrived at a safe place, Ling Han and Second Baby came out together, using ocular techniques to search for the treasure chamber of the Highest Splendor Sect.

“There!” Not long after, Ling Han and Second Baby said at the same time.

Second Baby had seen it with his own eyes, and in Ling Han’s case, he had used an eye technique combined with his understanding of formations to discover a man-made land of heaven and earth.

They walked over. Ling Han pondered for a moment before retrieving the purple-gold mask and putting it on.

This was a great hall. The doors were tightly shut, and there were eight people standing guard at the doors.

Lmg Han didn’t rush over at the first instant. He sized it up, activated his eye technique, and saw even more.

This great hall itself was under the protection of the formation, and had both the effect of warning and defense. If one wanted to barge in forcefully, putting aside the question of whether he would be able to break through this layer of defense, the great formation would immediately send out a warning. He was sure that even Gongsun Liang would arrive personally.

Though Ling Han had come to see Gongsun Liang, it was definitely not under such circumstances.

Faced with this kind of formation, even Sixth Baby couldn’t do much. She could indeed enter, but the problem was how to bring things out.

After Ling Han observed for a while, he finally calmed down.

He could handle it.

He stepped out, and just walked boldly towards the main doors.

Which master -pul” The eight people naturally saw Ling Han, and thought that he was a member of the sect, so they were completely unguarded.

They had been guards here for a long time, but nothing had ever happened to them. Naturally, they would be numb and careless.

But when they saw the mask on Ling Han’s face, they immediately realized that something was off. They all drew their weapons, and glared angrily at Ling Han.

“Who are you?” the guards shouted.

Ling Han naturally wouldn’t reply. Peng, peng, peng! He threw a series of punches, instantly defeating the eight guards.

These eight people were only in Extreme Bone Tier, so how could they possibly withstand a single blow from him?

Ling Han began to break through the formation. Previously, he only had a rough understanding, and now he was getting serious.

The Eye Technique was activated, and all the details of the formation appeared in front of him, leaving nothing out.

Simple.

Ling Han threw out a isolation formation. One, two, three, and every isolation formation cut off a node of the great power of heaven and earth. When Ling Han inserted seventeen isolation formations, this great formation had completely lost its effects.

He pushed open the doors, and with a creak, the doors immediately opened, revealing a dazzling treasure chamber.

The entire room was filled with jade seeds. There were also shelves that were filled with all kinds of precious materials.

Ling Han didn’t care about what they were, and simply stowed things away. Though he didn’t make any noise, it was best to deal with it as soon as possible. The treasures on the shelves were easy to deal with. In a few moments, they were all stored away. The problem was the jade seeds. There were really too many of them.

After working for a whole three hours, Ling Han finally emptied out this treasure chamber, and this was still the result of seven toddlers helping together. Of course, while they were busy, Seventh Baby once again fell headfirst into the pile of jade seeds and fell asleep.

“Let’s go.”

Lmg Han brought the seven toddlers back. When he arrived at his own courtyard, he did the same thing, and had Sixth Baby bring the gourd into the courtyard without alerting anyone.

Perfect.

Early the next morning, not long after Ling Han finished cultivating, there was a loud bang. It was obvious that the door had been kicked open again.

He walked out, and saw that Princess Bixiao was one step ahead of him.

Five people entered from the main doors, and Tu Jianbai was shockingly among them.

“Let me introduce.” Tu Jianbai said, “This is our Eldest Senior Brother, Shen Tian, and this is my Third Junior Brother, Bao Zhixue, Fourth Junior Brother, Lian Xinrui, and Fifth Junior Brother, An Yutang.”

Ling Han nodded, and said with a smile, “You guys came so early, so could it be that Sect Leader Gongsun has the time to see us?”

Shen Tian took a step forward, and asked, “Did the two of you sleep well last night?”

“Why is Brother Shen so concerned about our sleep?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

Shen Tian gave an ‘oh’, and said, “Yesterday, a burglary happened in the sect and the treasure chamber was ransacked completely by some outrageously ’ bold criminal. So, if the two of you just happened to not sleep well, I would like to ask, did you guys hear something?”

Princess Bixiao’s heart instantly jolted, and she immediately thought of Ling Han.? &

Combined with what Ling Han had said yesterday, she was sure that this must have been done by Ling Han.

-He had this ability. Sixth Baby could become invisible, and he himself was a Grandmaster Formation Master, so he was best at opening treasure chambers and whatnot.

Princess Bixiao naturally wouldn’t show any emotion. At present, she was in the same boat as Ling Han, and Ling Han had even said that he would share some of the benefits with her. She definitely couldn’t let the cat out of the bag. Meanwhile, Ling Han was surprised, and asked, “Who is this’ To be so outrageously bold, to actually dare to commit theft right under Sect Leader Gongsun’s nose.”

“That’S right. If we find that thief, I will definitely make him regret coming to this world!” Shen Tian said balefully, his eyes fixed on Ling Han.

Ling Han laughed loudly, “What do you mean by looking at me like that, Brother Shen? Could it be that you think that I was the one who did it?”

“Isn’t it Brother Ling?” Shen Tian also smiled.

Lmg Han shook his head, “For something that does not have evidence, Brother

Shen had best not speak carelessly.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Since Brother Ling is so bold and forthright, why don’t you let us search you?”

Shen Tian asked calmly.

Ling Han shrugged nonchalantly, and said, “This is the territory of the Highest

Splendor Sect. If you guys want to search, go ahead.”

“Brother Ling, we want to take a look at your Spatial Spirit Tool,” Shen Tian continued.

“Brother Shen, you’re making things difficult for me,” Ling Han naturally wouldn’t agree. “This involves my privacy, especially Princess Bixiao’s Spatial Spirit Tool. It’s possible that she also has some personal items, so it’s inconvenient to show it to outsiders.”

Princess Bixiao immediately recalled the Spatial Spirit Tool that had been stolen from her. In fact, there was even a change of undergarments for her. It would have been better if Ling Han had not said this. The moment he did, she felt an urge to commit murder.

“Brother Ling, in order to clear your name, it would be best for us to search you,” Shen Tian said. His voice wasn’t loud, yet it was filled with determination.

Ling Han smiled, “If I say no, are you guys going to make a move by force?”

“Thus, Brother Ling, it would be best if you don’t make the situation so awkward,” Shen Tian said.

Ling Han understood internally. Now, it was only five disciples moving, which meant that Gongsun Liang still did not want to completely offend the Dark North Nation. Otherwise, with a Celestial Path elite moving, what need was there for so much nonsense?

“If it was just the five of you, hoho, that would not be enough,” he said with a smile.

“Brother Ling, are you determined to go your own way?” Shen Tian’s expression instantly darkened.

“Hehe.” Ling Han merely chuckled.

“Move!” Shen Tian waved his hand, and Tu Jianbai and the others instantly surrounded Ling Han and Princess Bixiao.

“Two Mystery Realm Tier elites, and three Enlightenment Tier elites,” Princess Bixiao immediately said.

“You deal with the Mystery Realm Tiers, and I will handle the Enlightenment

Tiers. How about it?” Ling Han said.

“No problem.” Princess Bixiao was filled with confidence..
