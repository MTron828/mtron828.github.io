2694 Embarrassment of the Yun Clan

Yun Haoyang’s arrow shot out, bearing boundless might.

How could the great attack of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate not be powerful?

But the problem here was that Ling Han was really too smart. The moment he had glimpsed the powerful might contained in this strike, he had already begun his retreat, and Yun Haoyang could not move while he had been building up power for this attack.

Though this process only needed less than half a breath’s time, for Ling Han, this little bit of time was already enough for him to cover a very, very large distance. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Xiu! The golden arrow pursued Ling Han rapidly, its speed far surpassing his. It quickly closed the distance between them, but even a powerful shot would eventually lose its force. When the tip of the arrow was within 30 meters of Ling Han, the force of its course had already been exhausted. The golden brilliance left the arrow continuously, and the body of the arrow was also beginning to break apart and crumble. In the end, it turned into nothing.

The attack of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate ended without causing any damage.

“I’ll come play with you again.” Without stopping, Ling Han’s voice floated over to his opponent from afar.

Yun Haoyang stood firmly, and made no move to pursue. Just looking at Ling Han’s speed, he knew that the latter was not much slower than himself, and Ling Han had the advantage of setting out first. It would be too late to set off in pursuit now.

Fine then. His mission was only to stay and guard the clan. When his cultivation level as a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate had been completely stabilized, he would be setting out to the Realm Battlefield. It was fine as long as he dealt with Ling Han before that time came.

Ling Han only stopped after running for a very, very long time.

After a while, the large black dog and Wally arrived.

“Little Han, this clan is guarded by a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. Let’s just go to some other clan,” the large black dog said.

“No, I’ll continue to play around here.” Ling Han shook his head, his expression very determined. He wanted to use Yun Haoyang as a sparring partner, and break through to the Ninth Heaven.

“Brat, you are playing with fire here!” the large black dog exclaimed seriously.

The authority of a Heavenly Venerate could not be challenged. Ling Han had provoked a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate of his own volition, so even if he was killed, the Lin Clan would be in no position to say anything. He had asked for this himself. And with Yun Haoyang’s strength, if Ling Han made just one mistake, he would be condemned to the point of no return.

Ling Han smiled. “I will try my best not to die.”

The large black dog rolled his eyes at him. “If you die, Grandpa Dog will find some way to retrieve your body.”

“Really? Thanks,” Ling Han said through gritted teeth. Couldn’t this guy say something nice for once?

The large black dog patted Ling Han’s shoulder. “Brat, just how many years have you been cultivating for? Now, you are close to matching a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate already, so why are you in such a rush for success? Let’s just take things one step at a time.”

Ling Han knew that there was logic in the large black dog’s words. Even in the Flaming Frost Realm, the person who had reached the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier the fastest had spent over 10 billion years to do so. Ling Han had only been cultivating for 100,000,000 years, and could already just manage to match a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. This was something that had never been seen before, a speed that could not be matched.

However, Ling Han had an oppressive feeling. It was not just from Heavenborn, He Yufeng, the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable, and the others—the greater pressure originated from Hysteria.

The events of the Celestial King Graveyard told him that Hysteria would not just be attacking them head-on; it was also capable of using resources and intelligence.

A heaven-defying military force was already hard to defend against, and with the addition of resourcefulness and intelligence, this kind of enemy was too frightening.

This time, it was the Celestial King Graveyard, so what would it be the next time?

Hysteria kept maintaining the offensive. This meant that as long as it succeeded even once, the Flaming Frost Realm would be done for, and in a chain of reactions, the whole Genesis World would be falling into Hysteria’s grasp.

The large black dog also became serious. “All right. If you are captured, Grandpa Dog will find some way to save you.”

Ling Han smiled, and began to preserve his strength.

He was replaying the battle with Yun Haoyang in his head now, firstly to study the latter’s battle tactics, and secondly to see if he could find a trigger for his own breakthrough from him.

However, when one had reached the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, even the slightest move was an amazing move, so what clues would Ling Han be able to find?

Ling Han sighed, and decided to seek Yun Haoyang out for another battle.

He had always been resolute and decisive; he immediately charged back.

“Yun Haoyang, come fight me!” Ling Han called out in challenge at the gates of the Yun Clan.

“You actually dare to come again?” Yun Haoyang humphed. Ling Han had just fled with his tail between his legs moments ago, and he had returned so quickly?

Had he really not learned his lesson yet?

Yun Haoyang charged out resolutely, and immediately moved to suppress Ling Han without wasting words.

As long as Yun Haoyang did not unleash any powerful attacks, Ling Han would be able to handle him with his Indestructible Celestial King Physique. At most, he would only sustain some minor injuries. However, when Yun Haoyang launched a powerful attack, Ling Han knew that he was outmatched, and would break into a run at the first instant.

Ling Han had set his sights on Yun Haoyang, and would charge to the Yun Clan to call out a challenge frequently.

At times, the interval would be quite long as he would take over a dozen days before he paid another visit. That was because his injuries were slightly heavier than usual. At other times, he would charge back after just a few hours. That was because Yun Haoyang had taken too much time to release a powerful attack, so Ling Han managed to escape a long time ago.

Fighting to and fro like this, half a year’s time passed in the blink of an eye.

Though Ling Han had not been able to penetrate the defenses of the Yun Clan, the Yun Clan had also not managed to apprehend him. Furthermore, because of Ling Han, the members of the Yun Clan did not dare to take a single step out their doors at all, fearing that he would suddenly intercept them and kill them.

A dignified Heavenly-Venerable-Tier force was actually forced to become cowards in their own clan?

This made every single member of the Yun Clan righteously furious, but who asked that Ling Han was really too freakish? His speed was not much lower than that of Yun Haoyang himself, and even Yun Haoyang could not do anything against him. Chasing Ling Han off was an easy task, but to suppress and capture Ling Han, that was just being delusional.

It was not that Yun Haoyang had not pursued Ling Han before, but as long as he did not launch any great attacks, he would not be able to do anything to Ling Han. But if he did release a great attack, he would need time to prepare for it. This little bit of time was enough time for Ling Han to escape.

A Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate had made a move, yet was still unable to take down an Eighth Heaven Celestial King?

When the news spread out, everyone was stunned.

When Ling Han had exchanged blows with He Yufeng previously, he had still been unable to withstand a single blow. Though the fury of an ordinary man had still caused He Yufeng to bleed, the gap between them could not be any more obvious.

Yet now? A whole half year’s time passed, and Ling Han was seen constantly provoking the Yun Clan, but there was no sign of the Yun Clan taking him down. To say that Yun Haoyang had been going easy on Ling Han, there was probably no one that would believe something so ridiculous, was there?

This was too terrifying. He had just advanced by one cultivation level, and his battle prowess had multiplied many times over.

However, they had overlooked the role played by the Divine Demon Sword. If Ling Han did not possess this Heavenly Venerate Tool, he could only flee immediately when he encountered Yun Haoyang. He would not be qualified to oppose him at all.

But even so, Ling Han was indeed very amazing, forcing a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate to the point that the latter could only stay on the defense in his clan. What other Celestial King could actually do the same?

However, Ling Han was not the slightest bit satisfied.

He kept challenging Yun Haoyang, as if he was playing with fire. His motive was to make use of the latter to help him break through to the Ninth Heaven, but half a year had already passed, and he still did not have any improvement. He could not see any hope of breaking through at all. This made him slightly depressed, and agitated as well.

Again!

As usual, Ling Han went to the Yun Clan to call out a challenge, and Yun Haoyang also accepted helplessly.

“You are trying to use me to help you break through to the Ninth Heaven, right?” After fighting for so long, Yun Haoyang naturally discovered Ling Han’s motives as well. Otherwise, it would be meaningless to have challenged him over and over again like this. A cold light flashed in his eyes. A Celestial King actually dared to use him as a grindstone to polish himself. Just how arrogant was he? And just how far was he looking down on him to do such a thing?

Ling Han broke into a grin. “You found out?”

“There is no way you can succeed!” Yun Haoyang sneered. “Nine nines return to one, the pinnacle number of this world! Though I admit that you are indeed freakish, the threshold of the Ninth Heaven requires slow polishing and grounding. Spending over a billion to 10 billion years would be considered quick, and even an epoch would not be considered too long, either. Furthermore, the higher one’s natural talent, the more time would be needed to break through this barrier.

“You will not be able to last until then at all. My cultivation level is close to stabilizing completely. Once it’s done, my battle prowess will surge many times over, and killing you then will be as easy as slaughtering a chicken!”
