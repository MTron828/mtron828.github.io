2763 Crippled?

Ling Han channeled the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll over and over again, but he could only repair his body superficially. Externally, the bloodstains on his body had disappeared, but the bloody hole in his chest was still there, his heart had disappeared, and blood was continuously gushing out.

He couldn’t control his body at all. Every muscle and every bone had each become an independent part, and internally, there existed the unique powers of the dimension—there was no way they could be unified at all.

In this way, he wasn’t even good enough as a Celestial King, let alone to battle against a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate!

Ling Han tried to exert force, and suddenly let out a muffled groan. The powers in his body clashed with each other, and he couldn’t deliver a strike at all. It would only cause conflict within his body—the blow instantly shattered his right hand.

He put the pieces of his right hand back together again, frowning.

Now this was a huge problem.

He didn’t think it was because he had previously rebelled against the heaven and earth, and therefore was deliberately being targeted by the Flaming Frost Realm.

This was entirely due to him being too greedy, having absorbed too much power from the dimension, and far exceeding the limit that his body could sustain. Therefore, once all of it was channeled, he exploded.

Now that his core had been shattered, his previous efforts had all gone to waste, and he had completely become a cripple.

Was there no way to remedy it?

Ling Han kept trying and trying to rebuild his core, and fused all these powers into it once again, but he found that this was simply a delusion. The powers within his body were too chaotic; they would counteract one another at the slightest movement, and cause him to be split apart into pieces in an instant.

He tried various methods, but to no avail.

The Empress even went to ask Wally to come over, but there was nothing Wally could do about it. He was good at analyzing data, but he had never encountered such a situation before, and could only stare blankly.

The previous massive explosion of Ling Han had stirred up such a great commotion that there was no way to hide it, as the powerful aura that filled the entire martial academy had disappeared, so Ling Han had to have stopped breaking through.

Why hadn’t Ling Han made an appearance yet?

Someone had discovered that Wally had gone to Ling Han’s abode, and went to ask him specifically.

This guy didn’t know how to keep secrets at all, so he told the truth after being offered a piece of Divine Metal.

Immediately, the entire martial academy was in an uproar.

Ling Han was crippled.

He had failed in breaking through to become a Heavenly Venerate. It was said that he had suffered a very severe Dao injury, with no chance of recovery.

This piece of news seemed to have grown wings, and it quickly spread to the Realm Battlefield, triggering a huge commotion.

Ling Han’s friends, such as Rain Emperor, Yi, and the others, all felt sorry, but being in the Realm Battlefield meant that they couldn’t leave as they pleased. They also couldn’t just drop everything to visit Ling Han.

However, he had many enemies. Not just enemies; for example, his rivals such as He Yufeng, Lou Tianqian, and others were all excited. Previously, they had all been so happy, but it had all been in vain as it turned out that Ling Han hadn’t been dead, and had made a comeback.

However, this time, this piece of news was legitimate, and they all laughed heartily. Finally, this guy was doomed.

Ling Han’s potential was astonishing; therefore, whether he was really crippled or not had great implications.

Not long after, a distinguished and powerful figure arrived.

Chu Hao, Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate.

This person was an extremely powerful figure because he was the disciple of Lin Luo, the Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate, and he himself was expected to break through to become a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate. He was the person in the entire Genesis World who bore the greatest expectations… or one of them.

Aside from him, there were Zhou Heng, Lin Xiaoyang, and the other Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates, as well as rising stars such as Lin Youlian, Xin Qihu, Wu Haoyang, and others, who might become Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates in the future.

Chu Hao personally examined Ling Han’s situation.

“Lord Chu, how is it?” All the women were filled with concern.

Chu Hao frowned, and after quite a while, he said, “You wanted to condense the unique powers of the major dimensions and turn them into your own core. This is a very creative and bold idea, but you have absorbed too many powers. Now these powers are in conflict with each other in your body, and if I forcibly suppress them, I can only annihilate them one by one, which means that all your previous efforts will be in vain.”

All the women were disappointed. Even Chu Hao couldn’t do anything about it? Then what about Lin Luo?

Ling Han murmured to himself hesitantly, “That is to say, if I want to change the current situation, I have to give up everything and start all over again?” To revert this, he would have to go back in time by one epoch, back to the time when he was still a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

“Correct.” Chu Hao nodded.

Ling Han thought for a long time before saying, “Let me think through it carefully, I don’t want to waste my previous efforts before trying out all means.”

“Yes.” Chu Hao nodded, having great admiration for Ling Han’s decision because he also had a similar character. No matter what situation he was faced with, he would never give up hope, even if such hope did not exist in the eyes of others, with the success rate being absolutely zero.

“Call me if you need anything.” He left a letter with his divine seal, which contained a fragment of his divine sense. After tearing it apart, the divine sense would materialize. It had the battle prowess of a Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate, and he would be able to sense it as well.

Ling Han nodded, and said solemnly, “I will always remember your kindness, sir.”

Chu Hao smiled. This person was a bit like how he had been in the past—this filled him with a favorable impression of Ling Han.

“As long as one is alive, one should never give up hope.” He patted Ling Han’s shoulder lightly before taking his leave.

However, when he left like this, and Ling Han’s condition didn’t get better, this naturally convinced everyone that Ling Han was really doomed, and even the Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate couldn’t do anything about it.

Some people felt that it was such a pity. It was such a pity that this person, being an incomparably freakish prodigy, could not become a Heavenly Venerate to fight against Hysteria. However, there were some people who scoffed, saying what was the point—no matter how strong a person was, could he defeat Hysteria?

On the contrary, Ling Han let go of the burdens on his heart. He often walked around the martial academy so as to refresh his frame of mind.

His condition was seen by everyone. There was a bloody hole in his heart, which could not be recovered. This also made people feel rueful—Ling Han was truly doomed.

From then on, Ling Han’s name was no longer found on the list of prodigies!

However, Ling Han did not give up at all.

He actually had a way out. If worse came to worst, he could act according to conventions and cultivate like the others. With his freakishness, he could still become the strongest Heavenly Venerate, but he would only be one of them.

But he didn’t want to take this step until it was absolutely necessary.

One reason was that he was unwilling, and the other reason was that he believed that there was always a way out. There had to be a solution.

Time passed slowly, and the news of Ling Han becoming a cripple had also become old news, which was only brought up occasionally. Some people would sigh, while others would treat the subject with scorn and ridicule. Zhuo Kai, for example, was the more active type.

Yu Wudi had already died, and Zhuo Kai was the only person in the martial academy who had an old grudge with Ling Han. He had been reluctant to offend Ling Han before, but he no longer had any scruples this time.

He kept condemning Ling Han, be it in public or in private, trying his best to humiliate Ling Han, and criticizing him to the point of being worthless.

Zhuo Kai absolutely wasn’t afraid of Ling Han coming to make trouble for him. With Ling Han being a cripple, what was there for Zhuo Kai to be afraid of!

...

However, after the Empress heard about it, she directly went to kill him without the slightest hesitation.

To say nothing of the fact that Zhuo Kai wasn’t even a disciple of the martial academy, so what even if he was? Given the Empress’s especially proud character, if someone was to offend Ling Han, she would definitely give that person a death penalty.

As Zhuo Kai wasn’t a disciple of the martial academy, the Empress would not violate any rules even if she killed him. However, when the news came out, would Zhuo Bing let it go? He would definitely come to seek revenge against the Empress.

The Empress wasn’t fearful in the least. To say nothing of the fact that they still possessed trump cards, her own battle prowess could match a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, so she didn’t take it seriously at all.

The only thing she cared about was Ling Han.
