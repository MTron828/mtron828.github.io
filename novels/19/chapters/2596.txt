Chapter 2597: Strong resolution

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Without waiting for the people of the Ten Thousand Dragons Alliance and Seasons Alliance to voice their objections, Desolate Moon stretched out a hand.?Shua, a massive sphere of light immediately appeared in front of him.

“Is he going to attack?”

“How bold; does he plan to challenge countless Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings all by himself?”

“Humph, just biting off more than you can chew!”

All the Celestial Kings humphed coldly as they prepared themselves for attack. Each of them only had to launch a single attack, and Desolate Moon would definitely be eliminated.

However, Desolate Moon did not attack. Countless seals appeared in the light sphere before him, and something that surpassed Regulations was flickering within it.

“This is!” All the Celestial Kings swept over a glance, and their eyes instantly lit up.

“Nine Transformations Divine Scroll, a Heavenly Venerable Tier technique!” Desolate Moon stated evenly. “This was created by the Nine Transformations Heavenly Venerate. It is split into nine parts. If one can obtain all nine parts of the Divine Scroll, and master it completely, one will be able to cast aside the chains of heaven and earth, and attain the Heavenly Venerable Tier.”

“What!?”

“There is actually such an amazing technique!”

“Hiss, Heavenly Venerable Tier!”

The people from the Ten Thousand Dragons Alliance and Seasons Alliance all exclaimed in shock. They had heard that Desolate Moon was teaching some kind of secret technique within his alliance, but they did not believe it at all. Who would teach such a supreme, powerful technique for nothing?

This had to be the conspiracy of the Desolate Moon Alliance, and their motive was to disintegrate their enemies’ alliance. It definitely could not be trusted.

But who could have expected that Desolate Moon would actually have such a strong resolve to teach them the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll in public like this. This was practically… They did not know what else they could say about this.

Ling Han was also stunned. To say nothing of the fact that he was unable to teach the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll to others, but even if he could, it was impossible that he would just simply teach it to everyone he came across. Instead, he would control it within a strict range.

For example, his wives, his son, his brothers, his disciples. But to actually teach it to one or even countless strangers, that was absolutely impossible.

Just what madness had gripped Desolate Moon?

It was definitely impossible that a Heavenly Venerate would allow a Ninth Heaven Celestial King to advance into the Heavenly Venerable Tier, and that was something Ling Han was sure about. However, a Heavenly Venerable Tier technique was a Heavenly Venerable Tier technique, after all, and possessed boundless might.

For example, the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. As long as Ling Han had the support of enough resources, he would be able to advance his physique to the level of Divine Metal. Then, he would be an indestructible and immortal being among Celestial Kings.

Out of those who had attained the Heavenly Venerable Tier, who would be weaker than the other?

Thus, the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll had to be able to provide a frightening boost in terms of attack power. In a battle of equal cultivation levels, it might even possibly threaten the defenses granted by the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll.

‘This kind of technique… is just taught randomly and simply?’ Ling Han thought, but his eyes were focused on that sphere of light. No matter what, this Nine Transformations Divine Scroll was real, so he definitely would not miss out on it.

In this moment, a dead silence had fallen. No one was interested in speaking. They were all greedily memorizing the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll. Every single person was staring fixedly at the sphere of light, as if that was a supreme precious treasure.

The sphere of light flashed continuously, one seal after another flickering. This was a Heavenly Venerable Tier technique, yet it had been split into nine parts. It granted Celestial Kings the right to touch and grasp it. Otherwise, if the whole Divine Scroll was just thrown at them, even the most prodigious Celestial King would be driven dizzy.

From this aspect, the Nine Transformations Heavenly Venerate was truly amazing.

About a day later,?weng, the sphere of light disappeared abruptly.

Everyone was stunned, and felt a complete loss. Then, an extremely chaotic commotion burst out. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Friend Desolate Moon, why is this Divine Scroll incomplete?” someone asked.

“That’s right. Since Friend Desolate Moon did not mind sharing this Heavenly Venerable Tier technique with us, why don’t you simply take out the entire Divine Scroll?”

“Friend Desolate Moon, we will remember this kindness, and will definitely repay you in future.”

Ling Han scoffed internally. Even if he believed a ghost, he would not believe the words of anyone in the Celestial King Graveyard. There was only slaughter and bloodshed here. There was only profit and mutual deception. Easily trusting others would only lead to death.

Though these Celestial Kings spoke very nice words, they only wanted to obtain the complete Nine Transformations Divine Scroll. Perhaps they would turn around and stab Desolate Moon in the back when they truly obtained it.

No one knew what Desolate Moon was thinking. His face was not revealed, and no one could discern his expression or eyes. He said calmly, “I am not being stingy here, but rather I myself only possess three parts of the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll as well.”

When these words were said, a storm of protest rose among the crowd. With only three parts of the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll, how were they to push open the doors to the Heavenly Venerable Tier with it?

Desolate Moon pressed down his hands. “However, through various clues, I have already discovered the whereabouts of the remaining six parts of the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll.” He paused, and then continued, “That’s right. They lie within this swamp, inside the Ancient Tomb.”

When these words fell, they instantly ignited everyone’s excitement. They all turned to look towards the swamp, their eyes burning and their fighting spirit soaring sky-high.

As Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, they naturally could determine the authenticity of the three parts of the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll they had previously seen—they were definitely authentic. Furthermore, their might was endless, containing supreme profound secrets.

Hence, their desire to obtain the remaining six parts of the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll became even more intense.

However, it was not everyone that would be this impulsive.

Could the words spoken by Desolate Moon really be trusted?

What if he actually had hold of the complete Nine Transformations Divine Scroll, yet had given them false information so that they would put their lives on the line and work for him?

But if Desolate Moon really possessed the complete Nine Transformations Divine Scroll, yet was still scheming for what lay within the Ancient Tomb, that meant that the object that was hidden within was incredibly precious. At the very least, it would not be inferior in value to the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll. Otherwise, what need was there to use a Heavenly Venerable Tier technique as a recruitment tactic?

Everyone held their own individual thoughts, but they reached an agreement on one matter, and that was that they definitely had to raze this swamp to the ground.

The great Celestial Kings all worked together. They were all Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. Otherwise, even Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings were not qualified to participate. This swamp was extremely terrifying, and the black Qi wafting from it possessed frighteningly deadly might. Even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings would have to resist it with their full effort.

“The highest tier Regulation of Poison.” Ling Han came to this conclusion after surveying it for a few days.

The highest tier of Regulations was the Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier, and only Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings would be able to match this level. Moreover, a streak of black Qi from this place was equivalent to a single Ninth Heaven Celestial King that cultivated the Regulation of Poison. Just the thought of that was frightening enough.

It could only be swept aside bit by bit through the combined efforts of countless Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings.

Their progress was exceedingly slow because their “enemy” was too strong.

The news spread out, and even more Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings arrived. Desolate Moon was not miserly at all. In any case, the three parts of the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll had already been taught to so many people. Any Ninth Heaven Celestial King who came would be allowed to learn.

One year, 10 years, 100 years. The Celestial Kings were all forging onwards steadily. After all, they were true Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, so how could they be deterred by poisonous Qi that was born in nature?

However, looking down from above, there was still no sign of boundaries for the swamp. Who knew how many more hundreds, thousands, or even millions of years it would need before it could finally be eradicated.

Thankfully, the one thing that Celestial Kings did not lack was time. They had no fear of Immortal’s Tribulation. As long as they were not killed by other elites, their lifespan was unlimited.

Ling Han would also go to the swamp, and extract a streak of poisonous Qi to temper himself. It almost resulted in his death every time. In the most serious case, his whole body even rotted, and he nearly just died like that.

This was a battle with a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. Even if it was just a sliver or a streak, it was extremely terrifying. He could be easily killed. This was absolutely playing with fire.

But the effects were astonishing. The constant battle with Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier Regulations caused his cultivation level to improve by leaps and bounds as he rapidly and steadily advanced towards the peak stage of the Fourth Heaven.

10,000 years, 100,000 years, 1,000,000 years… Time passed very quickly, but the swamp was still there, as if there was no end to it.

Just how long would they have to continue doing this?
