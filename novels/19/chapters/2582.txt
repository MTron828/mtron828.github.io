Chapter 2583: Stoking Flames

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Tang Yuan didn’t dare to enrage Ling Han, and he had also decided to yield to Lu Li. However, this didn’t mean that any random person could bully him.

He made a pushing motion with his hands.

Peng, peng!

The two guards were immediately sent flying.

“Let’s go!” He recovered some of his might as a second-generation young master.

However, because of his floral dress, all of this seemed extremely comical.

Ling Han clasped his hands behind his back as he trailed after Tang Yuan. He was calm and relaxed, and he was extremely curious about why Tang Yuan had suddenly yielded. Moreover, he had yielded so comprehensively that he was even wearing a floral dress to please his once-enemy.

‘Interesting.’

They entered the residence, and it wasn’t long before someone walked over to meet them. They didn’t taunt Tang Yuan, and they simply led the way.

The group walked to a garden, only to see that a huge feast was being held. There was a sea of guests.

The person leading them suddenly stopped, and shouted, “Young Master Tang has arrived!”

His shout was so loud that he instantly attracted the gaze of everyone. Upon seeing Tang Yuan, these guests immediately spat out whatever was in their mouths, from wine to food. Some people were considerate, and they simply spat into the air. However, some of them directly spat the contents in their mouths onto other peoples’ clothes.

Laughter erupted, and the garden was filled with a sense of joy.

Tang Yuan felt so humiliated that he wanted to crawl into a hole in the ground. He naturally understood that they were all laughing at him. As a young master, this was utter humiliation that he had never experienced before. He wanted to immediately turn around and leave.

However, he wasn’t stupid. Since his father had especially written that letter, this signified that things were extremely serious. If he dared to throw a tantrum, it was extremely likely that he would be beaten half dead by Tang Mingbo. At that time, he would still have to crawl over to please Lu Li.

Thus, since he was destined to suffer humiliation, why would he choose to suffer a brutal beating on top of that?

Zhao Shuang was also present, though he had been invited as a guest. Upon seeing Tang Yuan, he was naturally transfixed with shock.

First, it was Yang Xiaoling, and now it was Tang Yuan. It was as if Lu Li were on the same level as the Azure Ghost Celestial King; it was as if no one could hope to oppose him.

“Hahahaha!” Lu Li roared with laughter as he appeared, followed by a crowd of young masters from Ghost King City. They all treated him as their leader. Yang Xiaoling was also a focal point. She was as beautiful as a flower, and her seductive appearance was also as alluring as could be. She had always been a commanding figure among the young masters, yet at this moment, she was like an obedient little bird as she followed Lu Li. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

At this moment, Lu Li was standing at the pinnacle of life. He couldn’t be any more impressive.

“Tang Yuan, I said that you would come, didn’t I?” he said.

Tang Yuan gritted his teeth, bowing in respect, and saying, “Young Master Lu is correct. This underling was blind before, and actually dared to oppose Young Master Lu. This underling deserves a beating!” After saying this, he started to slap himself again and again. Moreover, he used quite a lot of force.

Lu Li roared with laughter. After Tang Yuan had slapped himself several dozen times, he said calmly, “Alright, alright, I’ll accept you as my underling. Just be smarter in the future, hear me?”

After all, Tang Mingbo was also a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. Even though he possessed something that Tang Mingbo wanted, he still couldn’t take things too far.

Right now, he had won enough face, so it was a good time to stop.

Tang Yuan breathed a sigh of relief. He had truly been afraid that Lu Li would humiliate him further. Even though he had been humiliated now, this was still within what he could tolerate. He hurriedly smiled, and said, “Thank you, Young Master Lu, this underling will definitely listen to Young Master Lu in the future. I’ll do whatever you command me to do.”

Lu Li was extremely satisfied upon hearing this, and he wore a beaming smile as he nodded in acknowledgment.

Tang Yuan looked over to Ling Han at this moment, shouting in a solemn voice, “Hurry up and kneel! Pay respects to Young Master Lu!”

He was naturally doing this on purpose. He knew that Ling Han definitely wouldn’t obey him, so he could seize this opportunity to sever all ties with Ling Han. Moreover, with Lu Li’s current might and power, he would definitely exert pressure to force Ling Han to yield. At that time, they would directly lock horns.

The best result would naturally be for Ling Han to directly kill Lu Li and then be killed by a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. That would be the perfect scenario.

Ling Han chuckled as he looked at Tang Yuan, saying, “Are you seeking death?”

He didn’t give a toss about the battle between the two profligates in Tang Yuan and Lu Li. However, if he were truly dragged into the conflict, he didn’t mind causing a huge commotion before leaving.

The Celestial King Graveyard was massive, and many forces were hostile to one another. Thus, would the elites from Ghost King City dare to run to other territories to hunt him?

“Li Long, it’s only because of your decent strength that I endured your disrespect for so long. However, we’re standing before Young Master Lu now! Is this a place for you to act with wanton disregard?!” Tang Yuan said in a baleful voice. Ling Han’s reaction was naturally within his expectations.

“I’m no match for you, but this is the residence of Young Master Lu! Do you still dare to cause a commotion?

“Don’t bring trouble onto yourself!”

Upon hearing this, the other young masters also started to speak, urging Ling Han to pay respects to Lu Li.

“Do you think you’re impressive just because you’re a Blood Martial King?”

“Are you stupid? Blood Martial Kings are merely a bit more powerful. However, are you not a dog still?”

“Dogs should show the obedience of dogs!”

“You’re nothing but a measly Third Heaven Celestial King.”

Their impression of Ling Han was still stuck in the past. They didn’t know that Ling Han had already become a Fourth Heaven Celestial King. This was because Ling Han hadn’t unleashed his full strength while battling against Shi Yuan; he hadn’t needed to. He had killed him with ease.

These people were naturally sucking up to Lu Li, but this also made it difficult for Lu Li to take a backward step. Tang Yuan was already his underling now, and he had also admitted that he was unable to contain Ling Han. Moreover, this was his territory, so how could he allow Ling Han to act as he pleased?

Thus, he had to suppress Ling Han.

He naturally didn’t dare to do this himself. He was only a Second Heaven Celestial King, and he could only barely count as a king tier. Thus, could he even withstand a single strike from Ling Han?

“A’Yuan!” Lu Li shouted as he glanced to the side.

A’Yuan immediately stepped forward. He had been standing still the entire time, and it was as if he had fused together with the air. No one had noticed his existence. Now that he had stepped forward, however, it was as if he were a sword out of a scabbard, radiating with a dazzling and ice-cold aura.

His radiance was brilliant, and it was as if he were a divine weapon.

He had initially seemed as ordinary as could be, yet he was now surrounded by four ribbons of iridescent light. His right hand rested on the hilt of his sword, and his eyes were piercing and filled with terrifying killing intent.

‘Fourth Heaven Celestial King?’

Ling Han was astonished. His cultivation was already advancing quickly enough, and he hadn’t imagined that A’Yuan’s cultivation speed was also this quick.

This youth couldn’t be underestimated. His battle prowess was astounding.

“You’re very powerful, so why are you acting as a dog for these kinds of young masters?” Ling Han asked.

A’Yuan took several more steps forward, stopping nine meters away from Ling Han. His body was slightly crouched like a wild beast, and it was as if he could unleash an earth-shattering battle prowess at any moment.

“My master told me to protect him,” he replied emotionlessly.

“Hmm? Who’s your master?” Ling Han asked.

“Enough with the nonsense! Capture him!” Lu Li roared in frustration. “Don’t kill him. Leave him alive and make him suffer as much pain as possible. Show him the consequences of disobeying me!”

A’Yuan didn’t reply. However, he unsheathed his sword with a clang, and pointed it at Ling Han. The atmosphere instantly became ice-cold.

“Are you going to surrender, or do you want me to suppress you?” he asked.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “If you unleash your full strength, perhaps you can withstand 100 of my attacks. However, if there’s apprehension in your heart, you’ll be defeated within 10 strikes!”

A’Yuan’s gaze jumped. He had remained cold and emotionless like a War Soldier the entire time, yet he finally revealed a sliver of emotion at this moment.

Weng!

The sound of a ringing sword traveled over. He had already drawn his sword and thrust at Ling Han’s heart.
