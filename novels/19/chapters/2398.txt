Chapter 2399: You can already do Eighth Refinement?

This was very much Grandmaster Zi Cheng’s style. It seemed like the only thing in his eyes was profit. As for any honor of alchemy, how could that possibly be more important than earning a few Star Stones in his eyes?

Ling Han nodded with a smile. “I’ve earned a lot.”

Though he did not have much time to concoct alchemical pills for profit, he did have an alchemy pharmacy, and also had Liu Jun working for him, so he actually had earned a considerable amount. Of course, compared to the accomplishment of him robbing over 100 Ancestral Kings, it was really far, far too little.

Grandmaster Zi Cheng laughed loudly, and only then expressed his concern over Ling Han’s skill in alchemy. “Brat, are you at Sixth Refinement yet?”

Ling Han nodded. “I reached Sixth Refinement long ago.”

“Then when can you do Seventh Refinement?” Grandmaster Zi Cheng asked further, his expression completely natural. That was because Ling Han’s natural talent at alchemy was really too high. He had to have advanced into the Sixth Refinement in the tens of thousands of years, but that might not be for Seventh Refinement.

Ling Han cracked a grin. “I can already do Seventh Refinement.”

Only now did Grandmaster Zi Cheng really get a shock. “Brat, not bad!” Seventh Refinement was his equal. This little disciple of his was indeed extraordinary to manage to catch up to him in such a short period of time. If so, surpassing him would only be a matter of time.

He did not feel the slightest jealousy. The stronger the disciple, and the faster he advanced, the more pleased he would naturally be as the master.

“Then, when do you expect that you would be able to attain Eighth Refinement?” Grandmaster Zi Cheng was filled with anticipation.

Ling Han was slightly sheepish. The expectations this master had for him seem to be a little low. If he said he could already do Tenth Refinement, would it shock the old man to death? But he could not deceive his master, which made him hesitate slightly.

“Brat, don’t feel embarrassed. The stage of Eighth Refinement is indeed hard to breach. Just look at me; see how many hundreds of millions of years I have been stuck on this level?” Grandmaster Zi Cheng thought that Ling Han breaking through to the Eighth Refinement was far in the indefinite future. Though he felt slightly disappointed, he still comforted Ling Han.

Hu Niu couldn’t help but say, “Old man, Niu’s Ling Han has already reached the Eighth Refinement long ago!” The damn old geezer actually dared to look down on Ling Han.

“Cough!” Grandmaster Zi Cheng was shocked, and hurriedly confirmed with Ling Han. “Really?”

Only then did Ling Han smile, and answer, “Indeed, I can do Eighth Refinement.”

‘F*ck!’

Even Grandmaster Zi Cheng couldn’t help but be moved. Before Ling Han had broken through to Eighth Refinement, he very much hoped that his disciple could advance to this stage, but when Ling Han had truly attained Eighth Refinement, he was slightly dejected. He had not expected that his disciple would surpass him so quickly.

“Come, show me,” he said.

Ling Han nodded. Actually, Grandmaster Zi Cheng’s natural talent in alchemy was also very strong, and the reason why he had not advanced into Eighth Refinement was because, firstly, Eighth Refinement was indeed difficult, and secondly, the old man had no one to lead the way in front of him.

If Grandmaster Zi Cheng could see the process of Eighth Refinement a few more times, he would definitely be able to take this step.

Thus, Ling Han took out a Four-Star alchemical pill, and began to perform Spirit Refinement.

…Now, before the Tenth Refinement, he practically could ensure a 100% success rate in Spirit Refinement. Thus, when it was similarly Eighth Refinement or Ninth Refinement, he naturally had no wish to waste it on low-grade alchemical pills.

First Refinement, Second Refinement… Seventh Refinement!

After reaching Seventh Refinement, Ling Han paused slightly, and then began Eighth Refinement.

Grandmaster Zi Cheng’s expression involuntarily became solemn. Eighth Refinement was a step that he had never managed to take, and he was even more nervous than Ling Han as an observer, his hands involuntarily clenching into tight fists.

But Ling Han’s movements were smooth and unhurried. There was not the slightest pause. It was as if Spirit Refinement was something as simple and easily done as just sweeping the floor in his hands.

Very quickly, he was finished, and the eighth golden veined pattern appeared on the alchemical pill.

Eighth Refinement!

Grandmaster Zi Cheng felt his heart throbbing wildly, but after a while, he broke into a smile, which soon turned into loud laughter that seemed capable of shaking the heavens.

“Good disciple! Good disciple! Good disciple!” he hurriedly said, almost breaking out into tears.

The accomplishments of the disciple had surpassed the master, which made him feel both excited and exhilarated. Of course, he also felt slightly rueful. The rear wave had completely pushed down the front wave.

The women exchanged a smile, and the Empress said, “Old geezer, Husband’s standard is not just limited to Eighth Refinement!”

When these words fell, even Grandmaster Zi Cheng couldn’t help but tremble.

Wh-what? The Eighth Refinement was still not the end?

‘It can’t be that you’ve reached Ninth Refinement, brat?’

Grandmaster Zi Cheng had really gotten a scare. He could still imagine Eighth Refinement, because he himself was actually not too far from this stage as well, but Ninth Refinement was a threshold that he had really never come into contact with. It was a stage that was filled with mystery for him.

“Brat, you’re not going to tell me that you can do the Ninth Refinement too, right?” he asked.

At first, Ling Han had not planned to tell the old man the truth so quickly, fearing that he could not take it. THis would be a little too stimulating. But since the old man had asked, he could only nod. “I can.”

Instantly, Grandmaster Zi Cheng was speechless and gaping, dumbstruck.

Ninth Refinement was too fantastical.

“Show me,” the old man said in a shaking voice.

Ling Han began. For him, Ninth Refinement was only slightly difficult. He still managed to finish very quickly.

The ninth golden veined pattern, Ninth Refinement!

Grandmaster Zi Cheng practically snatched this alchemical pill over. Holding it in his hand, his eyes were closed, with him revealing an expression of great enjoyment.

“From today onwards, this alchemical pill is the most prized treasure of Alchemy City!” the old man declared.

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh. “Master, you cannot be greedy with your disciple!”

Grandmaster Zi Cheng naturally knew that Ling Han was just joking, but his hand was gripped tightly, as if he feared that Ling Han would snatch the pill from him. He was acting very childishly.

The women all pouted. Merely Ninth Refinement, and it was the prized treasure of the city? Their man could still do the Tenth Refinement!

Bewitching Maiden Rou opened her mouth. “Ling Han— wu!”

She had just barely opened her mouth when Ling Han had stopped her with a hand on her mouth. The old man was already shocked enough. If he knew that Ling Han could now do the Tenth Refinement, he might really go mad.

Grandmaster Zi Cheng was distracted. He would keep this Divine Pill in his collection from now onwards, and only the most outstandingly talented disciples would be able to study it so they could increase their comprehension of alchemy. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Go on, go on!” He waved a hand, as he stowed the alchemical pill carefully.

Ling Han and the others were all smiling. The old man really still had a bit of childish innocence.

They settled down first. It was rare for them to return, so they naturally could not just leave immediately.

Now that the chairperson had returned, everyone in Alchemy City naturally rejoiced. Grandmaster Zi Cheng took care of arranging a grand feast, inviting the various forces of Alchemy City.

Grandmaster Zi Cheng did not mention Ling Han’s standards in alchemy in too much detail, but only revealed the subtle message that his disciple was no longer inferior to himself.

Even so, the Alchemy City was still in an uproar. Did this mean that they now had another Four-Star Grandmaster?

A great feast was held, and those like those previous Holy Sons and Holy Daughters were all convinced now. They did not dare to harbor the slightest disloyalty at all. Ling Han had already become a Four-Star Grandmaster, and who knew, he might have reached the Seventh Refinement as well, or Grandmaster Zi Cheng would not have said that he was “no longer inferior to me.”

This was too shocking. Only a few tens of thousands of years had passed, and another such king of alchemy had already appeared!

“Hahaha!” Just when the celebration was being held, a loud laugh rang out, and a young man appeared quickly after. His arms crossed behind his back, he strode over from the distance as if there was no one around him.

Immediately, someone stood up, and shouted, “Identify yourself!”

“Xie Yangbing!” the young man announced proudly, and then paused slightly. “Western Celestial Realm, Ancient Alchemy Tower!”

Commotion rose up among the crowd. This young man was actually an heir of the Ancient Alchemy Tower!

It should be known that whether in terms of cultivation or alchemy, the Western Celestial Realm had surpassed the Eastern Celestial Realm, and it was a crushing superiority at that. Not only did the Ancient Alchemy Tower have a considerable number of Four-Star Alchemists, they even had the true big players of alchemy—Five-Star Alchemists!

Then what was the meaning of Xie Yangbing’s visit now?
