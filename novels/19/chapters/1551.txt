Chapter 1552 Are you male or female?

Yet Wu Jue simply ignored him, and exclaimed, “Mo Li, get revenge for me, help me get revenge!” He was acting like a spoiled child.The sight caused Zhu Xuan even more displeasure. This guy was practically just a kid, so how could he possibly become her husband?

Mo Li nodded, and replied, “All right.”

Mo Li was going to make a move?

Everyone couldn’t help but be curious and excited. How many years had it been? Mo Li was famous like the brightest star in the skies. Since a long time ago, there was already no one that dared to challenge him, yet Ling Han previously had also displayed a frightening physique; would he be able to endure Mo Li’s attacks?

They were all curious!

“I will make three moves,” Mo Li said to Ling Han, his expression calm.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “No way, we have no animosity between the two of us, and we’re about to fight a life-and-death battle already?”

A great many people immediately shook their heads. That was Mo Li, and he would be the only one beating others to death—who would dare oppose him? Long ago, millions of years ago, there already existed this kind of legend. As long as one could take a single move from Mo Li, then he would be capable of doing as he liked among the Eternal River Tiers. Taking three moves practically would qualify one to rule over the Eternal River Tier. If it was 10 moves, then one would be a big shot among big shots.

Three moves?

You couldn’!

Mo Li was neither angered nor irritated, and again emphasized, “Three moves!”

“Fine then, I’ll play with you!” Ling Han thought for a moment, his interest in gossip suddenly blazing. Involuntarily, he said, “Then, let’s make a wager. If I can’t take three moves from you, whether you want to beat me or kill me, I will have no disagreement. However, if I can take three moves, it will naturally be your loss. You’ll have to tell me whether you are male or female.”

Gasp!

Hearing that Ling Han actually still dared to bargain, everyone inhaled sharply, seeming to be incredibly stunned.

That was Mo Li, the top elite of the Eternal River Tier!

If he was willing to confirm his gender, what need was there for you to ask? Obviously, he was not! And you actually went to touch on his weakness; wasn’t that just courting death?

Mo Li still had a wooden expression, his figure rising into the skies. “Come fight me.”

“Filth King Ling, rest assured and go. If you die, Brother Li will collect your corpse.” Gou Li was already capable of movement. With a strong physique, his speed of recovery was considerably astonishing.

“Scram!” Ling Han almost shot out a foot to kick him.

He rose into the air, and stood on the same level as Mo Li, facing him directly.

“The first move.” Mo Li stretched out his right hand, and pressed it towards Ling Han.

The light of fighting spirits suddenly sparked in Ling Han’s eyes. This was a very strong opponent, and was stronger than even such big shots like Ren Feiyun. It was highly possible that he was a rank three king tier! This kind of king tier was really too rare, and that was why he naturally could be praised as a grand figure in this galaxy.

In the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy, which of the disciples were not well-known figures in their own respective areas? They were existences that were ranked in the top 10, at the very least.

‘Then let’s test out the battle prowess of the top king tier in the Netherworld!’

Ling Han channelled the Limitless Nine Deaths Formation. Boom, his whole person suddenly exploded with a boundless violent Qi. The Limitless Nine Deaths Formation was a killing formation in the first place, and ranked as the top among Level 16 formations.

11 killing formations activating at the same time, what kind of concept was that?

Ling Han moved, but did not use their full power. Instead, he only showed 30% of their might.

However, this was already incredibly frightening.

When he shot out his fist, a boundless murderous aura surged forth, and he was like the king of the underworld that had climbed out of hell, intent on slaughtering everything.

Everyone couldn’t help but be greatly shocked. This transformation was really too fast!

Previously, though Ling Han’s physique was freakishly strong, his battle prowess was not very strong, and he gave off an amusing vibe. But presently, it was as if he was a completely different person. That dense killing intent was practically enough to freeze one solid.

Only Bei Kai had some awareness of it. When he had been sent flying by Ling Han’s final blow, he had felt this kind of dense killing intent, which almost froze his blood into clotting. Now, his body involuntarily shivered with lingering fear.

That expression on Mo Li’s face that seemed like it would not change for 10,000 years also changed. Though it was only a bare twitch of his lips, that was a real change. With a shout, boom, his whole head of silver locks flew behind him, a silvery river appearing in midair, covered densely with great stars.

“Gods!” Someone swept an eye over it, and involuntarily paled in shock. “Mo Li’s stars have actually exceeded 1,000,000!”

‘What?!’

The others were also stunned speechless.

Attaining as many as 1,000,000 stars meant that he had reached the peak stage of the Eternal River Tier, and could attempt breaking through to the Genesis Tier. However, Genesis Tier was difficult to reach. Some freakish king tiers could continue pushing forward in the Eternal River Tier, and break the limit of 1,000,000 stars.

This could allow them to continue increasing their power. However, their grasp of the Regulations of the heaven and earth would stagnate, and they ultimately could not be called Saints.

But how could it possibly be easy to break through the number of 1,000,000 stars?

As expected of Mo Li, he was too strong!

But what was more inconceivable was that Mo Li actually channelled the silvery river. Just what kind of terrifying pressure had he encountered here? In other words, just how strong was Ling Han to actually manage to force Mo Li to this extent?

Hong, Ling Han shot out his fist violently, as if it was capable of causing the skies to collapse and leveling the underworld.

“Break!” Mo Li exclaimed lightly, brandishing his palm to meet Ling Han’s blow. Silvery light danced, similarly raising into the skies.

Peng!

The two of them exchanged a blow, and both were sent flying backwards.

Mo Li’s face that had been astonishingly pale became even slightly paler in an inconceivable manner, yet Ling Han was completely indifferent. His physique was too strong; what effect could a mere rebound have on him?

Immediately, he halted his retreat. Then, recomposing himself, he charged out at Mo Li again.

This time, he had increased the might of the Limitless Nine Deaths Formation to 70%!

Mo Li gritted his teeth, and boldly stepped forwards.

Peng!

The two of them once again bounced back. Mo Li was really very strong, and was not at a disadvantage at all, though his face became slightly paler again.

Ling Han made a comeback. This time, he held nothing back. He channelled all 11 killing formations, blasting them madly at Mo Li.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Two great king tiers fighting caused even the skies to darken, and only an endless thunder was echoing in the area.

Mo Li was really very powerful; he actually could hold up against 11 Limitless Nine Deaths Formations. However, thinking about it seriously, this was normal. His stars had already exceeded 1,000,000, and theoretically, he could be claimed to be in the pinnacle level of the Eternal River Tier, becoming a demon in a different sense of the word!

Having the power of a Demon Master, yet his grasp of Regulations was slightly weaker.

But Mo Li’s strength was known to all. He was publicly acknowledged as the top in the Eternal River Tier, yet Ling Han actually managed to fight him to a tie. No, he was in fact taking the initiative to attack, and suppressing Mo Li in battle. This was really something that was difficult to accept.

Wasn’t it Mo Li who said that he would let Ling Han have an allowance of three moves? Why were the tables now turned? It seemed like it was Ling Han that was testing Mo Li.

Ling Han had long forgotten their agreement of three moves. He was already excited by battle, and cared about nothing else. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Fight, fight, fight.

This battle caused even the sun and moon to pale. Neither of the two great king tiers had a habit of admitting defeat. However, when it was the second day, they both stopped. That was because a more frightening shock wave was coming from the galaxy—the two Demon Masters had already begun their spar.

Ling Han stared at the galaxy. The two Demon Masters were really too dazzling. Even if there was a distance of millions and millions of galaxies between them, they could still be clearly seen.

“You have won the wager!” Mo Li was expressionless. Then, he communicated through divine sense, and succinctly spoke out a word.

Ling Han’s expression involuntarily became strange.
