2700 He is Ling Han

Ling Han looked at Situ Tailong as if he was looking at an idiot.

Had Ling Han made any attempt to conceal his identity? From the start, he had been saying that he was Ling Han, but these people refused to believe it, and kept insisting that he was an imposter.

“Let’s go together,” Ling Han said with a smile as he reached out with his hand to grab Situ Tailong.

“I’m a disciple of the martial academy, you can’t treat me like this!” Situ Tailong shouted. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Ling Han naturally ignored it. When one’s strength had reached such a powerful level, one could disregard the rules. Furthermore, this place wasn’t within the martial academy, so what would Ling Han need to care about?

He grabbed Situ Tailong, and “planted” him upside down on the road.

Everyone was looking at Ling Han, their eyes bright.

This really was Ling Han.

Really fierce and domineering!

How could such a fierce person die? How could he have died in the hands of the Yun Clan?

Xiu, xiu, xiu, more Celestial Kings appeared, descending from the sky, all of them from the Yun Clan.

There was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King who had appeared; he couldn’t help but scowl angrily when he saw his clan members being planted on the road one by one.

The matter of Ling Han had been suppressed with great difficulty, with the reputation of the Yun Clan slowly being restored, but such an incident happened again today, which was a huge blow to the reputation of the Yun Clan.

“Damn brat!” he cursed, but didn’t make a move right away.

With the opponent being able to suppress five Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings, this person’s cultivation level had to be the Ninth Heaven. If it was just that Ninth-Heaven Yun clansman, then perhaps his chances of victory wouldn’t be high.

He sent out a signal to summon more members of their clan.

“Who are you?” he asked Ling Han. Although he felt that Ling Han was very similar to the one from 200,000 years ago, he knew that Ling Han was already dead.

Ling Han was too lazy to answer; he made a move to grab that particular Celestial King.

That Ninth Heaven Celestial King became very angry. ‘Both of us are at the same cultivation level, so how could you ignore me?’

“You’ve gone too far, do you really think that I am afraid of you?” He used a secret technique to counter the attack.

Peng!

When the attack landed, sure enough, the Celestial King collapsed as he couldn’t even match a single blow from Ling Han.

So the legend was true!

Witnessing such a scene, the people in the surrounding area became very excited. The Ninth Heaven Celestial King had been suppressed with a single palm strike; as expected of Lord Ling Han.

At this moment, all the members of the Yun Clan froze.

What was going on?

After all, their clansman was an elder with the cultivation level of the Ninth Heaven. In their eyes, he was an idol with unattainable strength.

But now he was defeated by Ling Han with a single palm strike, as vulnerable as a baby upon facing an adult.

Could it be… that this person was a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate?

Xiu, xiu, xiu, more Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings descended—all had come after receiving the signal from that Ninth Heaven Celestial King from before. They acted swiftly as soon as they received the news, so the time interval was incredibly short, but they were still too late.

“Who are… you?” They were extremely cautious.

“Ling Han!” Ling Han replied with a smile, and sent out a palm strike.

There was a total of 13 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings who came, and upon seeing Ling Han’s attack, they all joined forces to block it.

Peng!

Ling Han’s hand turned into a large white-colored hand that was nine meters long, looking like it was made of jade. Now this large hand was blocked. 13 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings had each shot out palm strikes that had transformed into hand-shaped millstones of different sizes to block the strike of the large white-colored hand.

All of them were gritting their teeth, with veins popping on their faces, and looking extremely labored.

On the other hand, Ling Han appeared relaxed, as if he wasn’t engaging with anyone in battle.

It took 13 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings to block the strike of one person.

“P-Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate!” everyone said in trembling voices.

It was widely known that 10 Celestial Kings at the peak of the Ninth Heaven could just barely block the attack of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. While there were as many as 13 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings in the Yun Clan, not all of them were at the peak of Ninth Heaven.

Moreover, there was also a difference in strength between weaker and stronger Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates. When 10 Celestial Kings blocked one, then the one who was blocked would have been the weakest Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate.

Xiu!

At this moment, someone in the sky shot out an arrow, so fast that it looked like a stream of light.

“So what if he’s a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, this the Yun Clan!” A majestic voice which made everyone’s blood bubble and boil sounded.

An elite made a move, albeit not Yun Yanghao, but a Celestial King at the peak of the Ninth Heaven.

When these words fell, everyone in the Yun Clan felt motivated. Yes, they were the Yun Clan, after all. Even if a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate attacked, they would be able to stop him by dispatching more Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings.

Ling Han humphed, raised his other hand, and launched a strike towards the golden arrow.

Peng!

With the impact of a single punch, the golden arrow instantly shattered into countless flashes of light. If there wasn’t a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate to take action, then who could stop Ling Han? His right hand exerted force, and boom, the white-colored hand pressed down abruptly. Such copious power was not something that the 13 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings could jointly fight against, and this instantly caused those Celestial Kings to collapse all over the ground.

In this exchange of blows, 14 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings were completely defeated.

However, due to the eruption of his full strength, Ling Han was unable to completely control his own aura, and boom, nine ribbons of iridescent light appeared on his body.

“Nine, Ninth Heaven Celestial King!” everyone in the Yun Clan said in a trembling voice, as if they were in mourning.

If Ling Han had really been a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, they wouldn’t have been so shocked, but Ling Han’s cultivation level was only the Ninth Heaven—this was really too terrifying.

A Ninth Heaven Celestial King had done what only a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate was capable of doing.

How freakish was that? And how frightening?

“L-Ling Han!” Someone finally said a name—naturally it had to be the catastrophe that had brought shame to the Yun Clan.

This guy wasn’t dead, and had even advanced to the Ninth Heaven. As they had feared, Ling Han at the cultivation level of the Eighth Heaven was just about able to battle against a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, so when he had advanced to the Ninth Heaven, he would really possess the strength of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate.

“Why aren’t you dead yet!”

Ling Han laughed. “What you’re asking is really too mediocre. If I am dead, then is the person standing here a ghost?”

“Little Han, he’s cursing you!” On the sidelines, the large black dog added fuel to the fire. With a shake of his body, he transformed into a dog again. “Grandpa Dog in this form is still the most handsome,” he said shamelessly.

The people of Yun Clan were on the verge of despair. Yun Haoyang had taken action, but he still couldn’t kill a Ling Han at the Eighth Heaven. Now that Ling Han had advanced to the Ninth Heaven, would there be anyone in the Yun Clan who could stop him? Their grand elder was still in the Realm Battlefield, and wasn’t able to withdraw from it at all.

“I really didn’t expect that you would not only survive, but even go a step further.” Yun Haoyang’s deep voice rang out. Xiu, he descended from the sky and landed with a single step, not showing any domineering behavior.

“Elder Hao!” All the members of Yun Clan immediately knelt on the ground, although there were those who were actually higher in seniority than Yun Haoyang among them.

The strong would be respected.

They once again regained confidence as they had a real Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate in their own clan, and therefore would definitely not lose to Ling Han.

Ling Han smiled lightly. “Were you thinking that it was obvious that I was not as powerful as you, and yet I still fought with you for such a long time, so I had to be an idiot, no?”

“I have to say, you are indeed freakish to have broken through to the Ninth Heaven by using me.” Yun Yanghao was deeply rueful. Which Ninth Heaven Celestial King, Heavenly Venerate, and Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate wouldn’t spend countless years when overcoming this obstacle? This was the last and strongest obstruction of heaven and earth, and it required a lot of hard work to break through it.

And Ling Han belonged to the most supreme freakish kind, and had successfully advanced with the help of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, which made the latter feel inferior.

“Having said so much, do you want to fight or surrender?” Ling Han shouted.
