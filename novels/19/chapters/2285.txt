Chapter 2286: Taken Fancy To

Translator: Henyee TranslationsEditor: Henyee Translations

10 days passed, and Celestial Maiden Yunhe arrived as promised.

Ling Han left the academy with her, and after walking around in a huge circle, they finally entered a small forest where there were already a dozen or so people waiting. They were all beautiful members of the Angel Race.

Upon seeing them arrive, three beautiful women from the Angel Race blinked at him in unison. However, this wasn’t seen by the others.

They were none other than the Empress, Hu Niu, and Bewitching Maiden Rou.

“Huh? Why did the three of them also come?

They were all monarch tiers, so it wasn’t strange that they had been invited by Celestial Maiden Yunhe. However, it was strange that none of them had come to tell him. Perhaps they had wanted to give him a surprise.

In any case, upon seeing that Celestial Maiden Yunhe had actually invited a demon, the remaining people all wore expressions of displeasure. What was the meaning of this?

“Celestial Maiden Yunhe, why did you invite a demon to our party?” a man asked. He had golden-yellow hair, and his skin was as smooth and delicate as could be. In fact, it was perhaps more well-kept than that of most women.

Celestial Maiden Yunhe had already predicted their displeasure, and she said with a faint smile, “Brother Ba possesses extraordinary strength, so he’ll definitely be a huge help for this adventure.”

“Haha, he’s nothing but an ugly demon,” the man said in disdain. “So what if he’s a monarch tier? We have a total of seven monarch tiers here!”

Upon hearing this, Ling Han couldn’t help but sigh with emotion in his mind. The Hundred Battles Academy was only one of almost 1000 academies in the Foreign Realm, yet there were already seven monarch tiers standing before him. The Celestial Realm simply couldn’t rival this.

It was no wonder that it was still the Foreign Realm that was attacking and comprehensively suppressing the Celestial Realm even after so many years.

“Han Feng, watch your words!” Celestial Maiden Yunhe immediately said in warning, She had witnessed Ling Han’s cold-bloodedness before, and she was also well aware of his heaven-defying power. She had been completely powerless before him.

“Celestial Maiden Yunhe, have you been deceived by this brat’s bombastic words?” the man sneered. Celestial Maiden Yunhe was a rising star in the Angel Quarters of the Hundred Battles Academy. Before the arrival of Hu Niu and the others, she had been a unique existence with no rival. Countless men

had been enchanted by her.

However, Celestial Maiden Yunhe had never given them the time of the day, much less become someone’s partner. Now, however, she was actually being so friendly with a demon? That naturally caused them to feel dissatisfied. This man was simply the first to step forward.

Celestial Maiden Yunhe furrowed her delicate brows. In reality, she was also extremely displeased with Ling Han. He had messed with her things without permission, and he also treated her with such apathy. If it weren’t for his extraordinary power, and if it weren’t for the fact that he could greatly

increase their safety on this adventure, she definitely wouldn’t have invited him.

“If you don’t want to fight alongside Brother Ba, you’re free to leave right away. I won’t stop you,” Celestial Maiden Yunhe said in a calm voice.

Everyone exchanged glances, and their expressions of displeasure became even greater. They felt like Celestial Maiden Yunhe was favoring Ling Han far too much. No matter how they looked, they couldn’t see any redeeming qualities in the demon.

“Brother Ba, is it? I want to ask for some advice!” the man said. He glanced at Ling Han, and his lips curled up ina light smile.

Ling Han looked at Celestial Maiden Yunhe, and asked, “It’s fine if I kill a fool like him, right?”

Celestial Maiden Yunhe hurriedly shook her head, saying, “Han Feng is the young master of the Golden Sun Clan, so please go easy on him, Brother Ba!”

“Oh, okay then,” Ling Han said with a smile.

Upon hearing this, the angels became even more displeased.

They had yet to fight, but the two of them had already concluded the victory of the demon in advance. How preposterous was this? After all, Han Feng was also a Five Leaves monarch tier. Even if there were a power gap between monarch tiers, it wouldn’t be so great, would it?

“Very well. Very well!” the man said with a dark expression. He directly retrieved a glowing treasured sword which almost looked as if it were transparent. With a shake of his hands, 10 symbols instantly materialized on the sword.

“Ten Symbol Treasured Tool!” everyone exclaimed.

In the Foreign Realm, the power of treasured tools was completely decided by the number of symbols that decorated them. However, at the Sixth Lotus, the upper limit was only 10 symbols. Even so, it was still extremely difficult to achieve. The materials needed and the skill requirement of the

weaponsmith were far too great.

Even though they were all emperor tiers or monarch tiers, it was still extremely difficult for them to obtain Ten Symbol Treasured Tools. Generally speaking, they would only possess Eight Symbol Treasured Tools. Even Nine Symbol Treasured Tools were extremely rare.

Han Feng had retrieved a Ten Symbol Treasured Tool right away, and this was a clear sign that he was indeed burning with fury. He wanted to defeat Ling Han in a single strike.

“Come!” With the treasured tool in hand, Han Feng instantly became filled with confidence. With his might as a monarch tier and the power of this Ten Symbol Treasured Tool, it was only natural that he was now invincible.

“Since you’re asking for a beating, I’l satisfy your itch,” Ling Han said in a calm voice. With a casual wave of his hand, he pressed down at the man.

“Audacious!” the man said with a humph. He raised his sword, and slashed down at Ling Han.

Weng!

There was a brilliant flash of light.

Ling Han didn’t pay any heed to this, and his hand continued to press down.

Pa!

The sword light instantly crumbled, and Ling Han’s hand was like a mountain as it pressed Han Feng to the ground. Han Feng lay sprawled, his face buried in the ground. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Everyone was stunned. Han Feng had been defeated in a single exchange? One had to realize that he had retrieved a Ten Symbol Treasured Tool, which could greatly increase his battle prowess! Yet, he still couldn’t block a single strike from Ling Han?

Celestial Maiden Yunhe seized this opportunity to ask, “I take it that no one doubts Brother Ba’s strength anymore?”

Even though she had already been aware of Ling Han’s strength, this scene still caused her heart to waver.

Everyone was speechless.

If Ling Han were from the Angel Race, they would definitely walk up to him with delight. He would be like a shining star. Now, however, they only felt increasingly jealous of Ling Han. He was only a mere demon, so how could he be so freakish?

“Welcome to the team, Brother Ba,” a man said with a smile. However, his smile was extremely forced.

They exchanged glances, and they already reached a tacit understanding. Afterward, they would isolate Ling Han, and give him the silent treatment.

Fortunately, even though Celestial Maiden Yunhe had seemingly fallen to him, there were still three stunningly beautiful women on the team. None of them was inferior to Celestial Maiden Yunhe.

“Let’s head off,” Celestial Maiden Yunhe said with a wave of her hand.

After setting off, she introduced the other team members to Ling Han. Ling Han didn’t pay any heed to the others, but he couldn’t help but laugh out loud when he heard the names of Hu Niu and the others.

One was called Niu, one was called Xing, and one was called Rou. They were truly lazy, and they simply used a character from their real name.

Upon seeing Ling Han’s smile, Celestial Maiden Yunhe immediately said in warning, “Brother Ba, it’s best that you don’t try to chase them!”

“Why?” Ling Han asked with a smile. Did he need to chase them? They were already his wives.

“Someone has already taken a fancy to them,” Celestial Maiden Yunhe replied.

“So I’m not allowed to chase them then?” Ling Han mused with a smile.

Celestial Maiden Yunhe was instantly pissed off upon hearing this. She was as beautiful as a celestial maiden, yet he was completely apathetic as if he were blind. Despite that, he was attracted to the three of them at first glance? How was she any inferior to them?

Just what kind of tastes did this rascal demon have?!

She humphed, and said, “I might as well tell you then. Do you know who You Yuan is?”

“No,” Ling Han replied with an honest shake of his head. He had been immersed in cultivation recently, so how could he have had time to worry about other matters?

Celestial Maiden Yunhe was rendered speechless. “You don’t even know You Yuan? Can we still continue this conversation?!

“He’s a monarch star!” she said in a solemn voice..
