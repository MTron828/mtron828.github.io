Yet Ling Han thought of something else.

In theory, it would be the inhabitants of the Immortal Realm that could not cultivate to 20 Stars of Shattering Void Tier, because the final three Stars of strength was an unbreachable gap. Only people of a small world, through the bountiful rewards obtained from opening the sky, would be able to gain those additional three Stars of strength.

From a certain aspect, it was fair. You, as an inhabitant of the Immortal Realm, enjoyed an endless supply of resources from birth, so you would have to make some kind of sacrifice in exchange.

Of course, this kind of sacrifice was practically negligible. Just look at how many years the Joint Peace Planet had existed, yet how many small worlds arrived by opening their sky in these many years?

However, what qualified Xu Ran to reach strength of 20 Stars of Shattering Void Tier, then?

He had to have come by splitting open the sky!

Why weren’t there any legends about him? Even Xiang Chengyun thought that Ling Han was the first person in history to come by splitting open the sky, but there obviously had appeared another one 300,000 years ago.

Perhaps some kind of secret was hidden behind this.

Xu Ran appeared 300,000 years ago. He stayed in the Scarlet Heaven Academy for only 300 years, and when he reached the peak of perfection of the Mountain River Tier, he left the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire, and perhaps even Joint Peace Planet. From then, all information about him was lost.

Shui Yanyu said, “If you want to attain strength of 20 Stars of Shattering Void Tier, you have to do three things simultaneously. First, you have to increase your Origin Power; second, increase the strength of your physical body; third, increase the might of your secret techniques.

“Today, we shall begin from increasing the strength of the physical body, and this is also the easiest place to start.”

She guided the students in their cultivation; this was really very simple. Just shatter all the bones in the body, then use a secret technique to temper them before restructuring your skeletal structure again.

Once could only increase a little bit of the toughness of your physical body, but tempering for a hundred times, your body could become as tough as steel.

Hearing her say such an understatement, they all felt a muscle in their faces twitch. This was too frightening, right? How many could bear such agony? If they could knock themselves unconscious, and could complete the tempering under a completely ignorant, unaware state, that’d be fine. However, this required you to maintain awareness, and take the initiative to make the sacrifices to activate the process to be able to obtain the desired effects.

Everyone understood the logic, but to accomplish it? It was really too difficult!

Thankfully, they did not need to aim for strength of 20 Stars—it was enough for them to push their battle prowess up to 20 Stars. This, in comparison, was much easier, and there was no need to torture themselves so horribly.

The day ended, and they all felt a ripple in their hearts due to Shui Yanyu’s outstanding beauty and grace, but also felt slight respectful fear towards her, worrying that she would force them to break all the bones in their bodies. This was definitely no joking matter.

Thankfully, Shui Yanyu also had to work on her own cultivation. Hence, they only had to go to class once every five days. At other times, they would be cultivating on their own. If they had any question, they had to keep it for next class.

The teachers in the Academy naturally could not compare to masters that were taken through the proper rites. This was not a real master-disciple relationship, but merely passing on of their skill.

Ling Han called Li Weiwei out and headed to his place of residence. Ji Yun’er followed suit.

“Hey, you’re acting so mysterious. What actually did you want to say?” Li Weiwei was an impatient person, and could no longer refrain from asking the moment they entered the courtyard.

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “I want to treat the both of you to a meal.”

“Tsk!” Li Weiwei immediately scoffed. Do you think I haven’t eaten exotic delicacies? To actually use this kind of method to bribe me? Hold on!” She stared at Ling Han, and said, “Hey, hey, hey. It can’t be that you’ve put some drug in the food, and plan to conspire against us, right? You animal, you actually want to kill two birds with one stone; how dirty!”

“Weiwei!” Ji Yun’er called out, her pretty face flushed bright red. Even she was astonished by the rich imagination this girl had.

Ling Han drew out food ingredients from the Black Tower, and began cooking. He said, “Take it or leave it; do you think I’m begging you to stay here??”

“I will not fall for your reverse psychology trick; that kind of ploy is something I’ve already done before I was three! Yi...” Li Weiwei suddenly took a sniff, and her eyes trained on the three pieces of meat on the grill, and then turned to glance at the soup on the side as well.

“Smells nice!” she said, moved.

“None of your business!” Ling Han said, smiling, “There’s poison inside this meat, so just stay and watch from the sidelines!”

“Hmph, if you dare to put poison in it, I’ll kill you!” Li Weiwei could not help but lick her lips, and said, “Blockhead, where did this meat come from? It smells great!”

Ling Han tossed her a look, then asked, “What is it? Do you want to eat?”

“Damn blockhead!” Li Weiwei humphed. “You really are petty. I just teased you a bit! Fine, I want to eat, so what about it? If you don’t like it, come and bite me!”

Ling Han was struck speechless. No wonder the Left Minister had such a headache about this beloved daughter of his. Indeed, she did not have the slightest bit of reserved nature a well-bred young lady should have. He smiled, and said, “I still have much of this type of food. So, I want to make a business deal with you!”

“You want to sell them to me? All right, however much you have, I’ll take them all,” Li Weiwei said with a casual wave of her hand, appearing to be very rich and overbearing.

Yet Ling Han looked at her doubtfully, and retorted, “How many True Origin Stones would you have? If you have less than 1000, then don’t tell me you’re rich!”

Li Weiwei opened her mouth to retort, but ultimately sighed in defeat. She really could not produce 1000 True Origin Stones. The nobler the clan, the stricter the restrictions would be on the expenditure of their juniors. That was because if you had a lot of wealth in your hands, you could possibly spend your time drinking and making merry. However, the young age was the golden period of cultivation, so how could you waste it foolishly like that?

Meanwhile, Ji Yun’er’s beautiful eyes lit up, and she asked, “So what Senior Brother Ling means is to sell these food ingredients to the various noble and prestigious clans?”

Ling Han clasped his hands, smiling, and said, “Junior Sister Ji is truly intelligent!” He was ranked first in this batch of freshmen, and thus, whether they were older or younger than him, all would have to address him as Senior Brother.

Li Weiwei was displeased, and mumbled, “What part of me is stupid?”

“However, this is not Spiritual Meat. No matter how delicious it is, I do not think anyone would be willing to pay True Origin Stones for it.” Ji Yun’er could tell that Ling Han obviously wanted True Origin Stones. Furthermore, he wanted a large amount.

“Spiritual Meat? What is Spiritual Meat?” Ling Han questioned.

Li Weiwei immediately scoffed, and answered, “You really are a country bumpkin, you don’t even know what Spiritual Meat is! Let me tell you, only Immortal level Demonic Beasts could nurture Spiritual Meat. That is the most essential part of them, and one could devour it directly. It would greatly replenish your energy, and could also improve your cultivation. The effects are even better than the True Origin Stones. Unfortunately, no matter how big the Demonic Beast is, the nurturing of Spiritual Meat is influenced by cultivation level. If the Demonic Beast is in the minor levels of the Mountain River Tier, there is only as small a piece as this.”

She demonstrated the size to be about the size of a thumb. It was really pitifully small. One had to know that Immortal level Demonic Beasts could reach the terrifying size of a small mountain.

Ling Han gave an “oh”. Then, he would have another channel to increase his cultivation. When he saw a piece of barbequed meat was about done, he removed it, and used a small knife to cut it into two pieces. Then he placed it on plates, and passed them to Li Weiwei and Ji Yun’er, respectively. He said, “Try out the taste first. See if it’s worth paying True Origin Stones for.”

“Blockhead, you really didn’t put any drugs in it?” Li Weiwei’s face was filled with suspicion.

“If you’re not going to eat it, give it back to me!” Ling Han pretended he was about to take back the plate.

“Go away. Now that you’ve handed it into my hands, it belongs to me now. There’s no way you’re taking it back!” Li Weiwei hurriedly defended her food. Using chopsticks, she picked up the barbequed meat, and bit down. Abruptly, she had swift change of expression.
