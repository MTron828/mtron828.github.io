3102 Sun Jianfang Was Stunned

Ling Han continued to punch. During this process, traces of energy surged into his body, surging through his meridian, widening it, pushing out impurities, and leaving behind some sort of mysterious energy.

Hu, hu, hu. Ling Han’s punches became faster and faster. In fact, one could even see afterimages left behind his punches.

‘Although the Meridian Opening Tier is determined by how many meridians are opened, cultivation level is cultivation level, and strength is strength. The two of them cannot be confused.

‘Two people may both be One Meridian, but the width of the meridian that each person opens is different.

‘Usually, the strength of a One Meridian is about 250 kilograms.

‘250 kilograms of strength is already very extraordinary. For someone like that, killing a wild wolf with his bare hands would be no problem.

‘However, the limit that can be attained is 400 kilograms of strength, which is enough to defeat a ferocious tiger!’

Ling Han thought to himself as he punched. His dream was to achieve 400 kilograms of strength. This way, even if his cultivation speed was a little low, as long as his power was strong enough, was there still any need to be concerned about his cultivation level?

Strength was the true way to go. Everything else was meaningless.

Ling Han had cultivated from his very beginning of Body Refining Tier to Heavenly Venerable Tier, so would Ling Han still care about something as superficial as cultivation level?

He practiced from morning to noon and finally stopped.

It wasn’t that he was tired. On the contrary, his essence, qi, and spirit were at their peak. However, his meridian was in pain, making him realize that if he continued to train, his meridian might break.

That would be too foolish.

More haste, less speed[1]. There had to be moderation in everything.

Ling Han had a good rest, took a bath, and ate a meal.

Then, he came to the basement, where a meter for strength was placed.

This was a very crude calculator of strength. It was very large and took up two-thirds of the available surface area. It was fixed to the ground with incomparably thick steel screws.

Facing Ling Han was a black iron plate with leather wrapped around it. If he punched it, it would immediately display his level of strength.

The reason why it was wrapped with leather was naturally to protect his hand.

Ling Han focused, and then suddenly threw a punch.

The energy in his meridian surged out majestically. Peng! His punch landed solidly.

However, the dynamometer didn’t vibrate at all. Instead, the numbers kept jumping and finally stopped at a number.

“132 kg. That’s all?”

Ling Han was slightly dissatisfied. Although he had already set aside the fact that he had once been an omnipotent Heavenly Venerate, after these few days of cultivation, he actually only had 100 kilograms of strength?

Wasn’t this a little too weak?

‘It would be great if Wally was here. This Four Directional Fists is only a simplified version. The effect definitely can’t compare to that of the real fist technique. If I can deduce the real fist technique, my advancement will definitely be much faster.’

Ling Han sighed. However, the Four Directional Fists was the foundation of the Ancient Dao Sect. Even those elders could only learn three to five moves, so how could he possibly obtain the complete inheritance?

Not only could it be used to cultivate, but it could also be used to fight enemies. It was extremely powerful.

‘Let’s try using the fist technique.’

Ling Han started practicing the Four Directional Fists, and then abruptly threw another punch.

BANG!

A ripple emerged on the leather, and it let out a muffled sound. The value changed again.

‘152.5 kilograms.

‘The enhancement isn’t very strong, but it’s solid.

‘If I don’t use the fist technique and punch continuously, my power value will fluctuate between 100 and 130. However, after using the fist technique, I can always maintain the value at around 150 kg.’ Ling Han rubbed his chin, pondering. ‘Then how many punches can my current body allow?’

He began to experiment again. If he didn’t use his fist technique and maintain his fastest punching speed, he could probably hit 100 times. Then, his speed would slow down. By the time he hit 300 times, he would basically have no strength left.

If he were to use the fist technique, he would be able to deliver 150 punches in one go. Then, his arms would feel as if they were on fire, and he would be unable to exert any more force.

‘If I’m fighting someone, I have to calculate my limits. I can’t just focus on fighting and fall into a state of exhaustion.’

From the afternoon onwards, Ling Han stopped practicing his fist technique. He rested well, and then he once again began to train with all his might on the morning of the second day.

His improvement was astonishingly fast. After a day, his fist strength had increased to more than 145kg.

‘The effect of the Spirit Gathering Formation is very obvious. It made my advancement more than double.

‘It’s just that my body’s strength is a little low. It’s not enough to allow me to cultivate for an entire day.’

What he didn’t know was that if someone else were to use the Spirit Gathering Formation like him, they definitely wouldn’t be able to get out of bed the next day.

Ling Han’s recovery speed could be considered abnormal.

It was just that he hadn’t completely gotten used to his current body of an ordinary person. He would subconsciously compare the present him with how he had been in the past. In that case, he would definitely think that he was far inferior to his previous self.

Day after day, Ling Han’s progress was astonishingly fast.

By the 10th day that he had agreed on with Sun Jianfang, Ling Han’s fist strength had already reached the 250-kilogram mark.

Theoretically speaking, he could already be considered to have reached the peak of One Meridian, and could now open up a second meridian. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

However, Ling Han did not feel at all that he had widened the Zuyang Bright Gastric Meridian to the extreme, and felt that there was still a great deal of room for improvement.

“Young Master, Lord Sect Master has summoned you.” Huan Xue came over.

Ling Han nodded. He stood up and left his rooms, heading over to where Sun Jianfang was.

“How is it? Have you sensed your meridians?” Sun Jianfang asked. Although 10 days was a little short, combined with the Meridian Guiding Fruit and Ling Han’s genius, it should be possible for him to sense his meridians.

“I sensed it!” Ling Han replied honestly.

Sun Jianfang revealed a smile, appearing very satisfied. Even with the help of the Meridian Guiding Fruit, to be able to sense his first meridian in 10 days was still very extraordinary.

“Good! Good! Good!” He pointed at the strength tester placed in the courtyard. “Come, let’s see how much strength you have now.”

Ling Han walked over and clenched his fist. Power surged in his meridian, and he did not use any fist technique. Peng, he threw a punch, and the numbers flashed.

“…253 kg?!” Sun Jianfang was instantly shocked speechless. Although this little bit of power was not worth mentioning in front of him, a person who had only been “born” more than 10 days ago and had just sensed a meridian could actually blast out about 250 kg of power?

F*ck, what kind of monster was this?

This was already the peak of One Meridian.

“A prodigy! Truly a prodigy!” Sun Jianfang could not help but sigh with emotion. He looked at Ling Han, and his gaze became even gentler. “Your progress has far exceeded my expectations.”

He thought that Ling Han’s fist strength would at most reach 50 kilograms. After all, he had only just begun. However, he was truly a little frightened now.

Ling Han was able to cultivate to become One Meridian in 10 days. Even though the higher one’s cultivation level was, the slower one’s progress would be, this fellow should reach Twelve Meridians in a year or two, right?

Hehe, he secretly laughed at himself for taking this for granted. The more meridians one opened, the more difficult it would be to sense new meridians. He had been through this before, so how could he not know?

However, even if Ling Han could only reach Twelve Meridians in five to 10 years, this would still be extremely shocking.

How long had it taken Sun Jianfang to reach the same level?

A full 37 years.
