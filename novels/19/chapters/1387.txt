Chapter 1388 The Uncanny Human Skin Old Man

However, Han Tao didn’t possess a mental fortitude as powerful as Ling Han’s. He involuntarily took a few steps back.

“Where’s my dog? Have you seen my dog?” The old man shuffled forward, almost sticking his face into Han Tao’s face.

Han Tao could clearly make out every detail of the old man’s face—that pale skin, those bloody eye sockets, and that empty mouth. At this instant, a thought suddenly surged into his mind—human skin!

He was petrified, and his hair instantly stood on ends. His heart started to beat wildly as if it were about to explode.

At his cultivation level, there were already few things that could actually affect his emotions. Right now, however, he had been scared out of his wits. His face was as white as a sheet. His knees buckled, and he couldn’t help but crumple to the floor.

“Where’s my dog? Have you seen my dog?” the old man asked. He wasn’t willing to give up, and he continued to press Han Tao for an answer. At the same time, he even extended his arms toward Han Tao, his long and slender fingers as smooth as jade. However, his body was radiating with sinister killing intent.

Han Tao finally came to his sense, shaking his head vigorously and answering, “No, I haven’t seen it!”

“Oh!” A look of disappointment washed over the old man’s face, and he said, “Then I’ll ask someone else.” With a single stride, he arrived beside someone else.

This old man was definitely a supreme elite. His aura was petrifying, and just being near him would cause one to feel boundless terror. Although the people here were all Heavenly Body Tier elites, they were no different from ordinary people in the “eyes” of this old man.

Many people were like Han Tao, collapsing to the ground in fright when they were approached by the old man. In fact, these people were already the fortunate ones. Some people were scared silly, not coming to their senses and giving an answer even after being questioned by the old man three times. When the old man came across such people, he would reach over and ruthlessly snap their necks.

Moreover, the divine sense of these people didn’t escape their bodies. Instead, they were obliterated along with their bodies.

After a short while, the intense battle in the valley ground to a halt. Everyone stared at the old man in shock and terror. In fact, they didn’t even have the courage to flee.

This was the suppression of a transcendent being. He was like a Beast King who wanted to engulf the 100 beasts below him. The beasts might want to flee, but they wouldn’t possess the courage to do so. They could only stay still and be willingly consumed by the Beast King.

Fortunately, this old man wasn’t a human-eating beast, nor was he someone who killed others indiscriminately. The old man would only kill people in irritation if they failed to answer him after being questioned three times.

If one couldn’t even answer such a simple question, then it was purely their own fault if they were killed by the old man.

Everyone was pale with fright as they looked at the old man. Why was there such a powerful being in this place? No, no, no, this wasn’t a being; it was a sheet of human skin! However, just a sheet of human skin alone was already this powerful, so just how powerful was this person in his peak condition?

However, in the countless years that this mystery realm had existed, they had never heard of the existence of such an uncanny sheet of skin before!

The old man questioned the elites one by one. After questioning everyone, he walked before the Makara Flower, cocking his head as he took a glance at it. “This flower... is a little familiar,” he mumbled to himself.

Under the watchful gazes of the elite, he reached over and plucked the flower. He then stuffed it into his mouth and chewed for a while before finally swallowing it.

The elites were all stunned.

One had to realize that the Makara Flower was potent enough to poison even elites at the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier to death once it fully blossomed. However, the old man had swallowed it whole! Although the Makara Flower hadn’t blossomed yet, its poison was definitely still contained within its bud. By chewing and swallowing it, wasn’t the old man seeking death?

However, this old man was only a sheet of skin anyway. Theoretically speaking, he was already long dead. So, how could he be killed a second time?

Moreover, this old man was unfathomably powerful. As such, perhaps this poisonous flower wouldn’t be able to kill him even if he were truly alive.

The Makara Flower was eaten by the old man, and no one dared to object. Right now, the elites only wished to leave this place alive. To say nothing of eating the Makara Flower, the elites wouldn’t complain even if the old man were to eat all of their ancestral weapons!

After eating the Makara Flower, the old man stood still and didn’t move anymore. It was as if he had been killed by the poison. However, after a short moment, he glanced in the direction of Ling Han. With a single stride, he teleported through space and arrived beside Ling Han.

The Heavenly Body Tier elites were stunned silly again. Teleporting through space was one of the most difficult tasks. This pertained to the Regulations of space and was something that only Genesis Tier Saints had the right to learn. This was also the reason why only Genesis Tier Saints could travel throughout the universe. It was because they were tremendously quick. Otherwise, they could only await death amid the lonely and desolate expanse of the universe.

This sheet of human skin... was actually at the Genesis Tier!

“There’s a familiar smell on your body,” the old man said as he stared at Ling Han with his empty and petrifying eye sockets.

Ling Han’s hair instantly stood on ends. ‘I’m a human, and you’re a sheet of human skin. There isn’t a shred of familiarity between us, okay?’ He wanted to flip the bird at the old man, yet decided against it upon thinking of his tremendous power. It would most likely be useless even if he dragged the Notionless Saint out from the Black Tower.

“What guidance would Senior like to offer?” Ling Han asked respectfully.

The old man shuffled closer and took another sniff of Ling Han’s body. A confused expression spread across his face. He then scratched his head, and asked, “Where’s my dog? Have you seen my dog?”

‘Fine, we’re back to this sh*t again.’

“No,” Ling Han replied with a shake of his head.

“Then I’ll ask someone else.” The old man arrived at the valley with a single stride. He then tortured the elites with another round of questioning.

Ling Han hurriedly fled from the scene. He didn’t want to see that crazy old man again.

‘Strange... Although few people can make it to the fifth level, the total number of people who have made it here is definitely significant, especially after hundreds of millions of years. Yet, there’s never been any news of this strange old man. It’s extremely likely that he’s only appeared here recently.

‘Hang on, the old man said that there was a familiar smell on my body. If he wasn’t speaking nonsense...’

A speculation suddenly appeared in Ling Han’s mind.

‘Perhaps this old man was the owner of the fourth level. However, due to some circumstances, he has been skinned alive. Yet, he’s far too powerful, so he can still wander around even though he’s only a sheet of skin. In fact, he even has some instinct, an instinct to look for his dog or whatever.

‘In the past, he was probably in a slumber or unable to move. Only after I achieved resonance and absorbed the power from the words on the palace of the fourth level was the old man finally awakened.

‘In that case, it’s understandable that the old man can smell a familiar scent on my body...’

Of course, all of this was only Ling Han’s wild speculation. It would be almost impossible to verify whether his speculation was accurate or not.

In any case, he had fled from the scene, not wanting to play the game of “find my dog” with the old man any longer.

He wasn’t interested in exploring this level for other Godly medicines, either. This level was filled with a lifeless aura, and any Godly medicine that he could find would probably be like the Makara Flower. The main use of these Godly medicines was to poison and kill others. They were completely useless to cultivation.

Thus, after a few hours, Ling Han arrived at the palace of the fifth level.

Thousand Water Palace.

However, these three words were already dim. It was clear that someone had already absorbed the power within these words.

Ling Han couldn’t help but sigh as he walked into the palace.

Before him was a Heavenly Origin Dao Fruit. This fruit was already close to maturity, and it exuded a faint fragrance that could excite one’s Origin Power. It would make one feel as if they were about to break through.

A stunned expression spread across Ling Han’s face. He hadn’t experienced such feelings while on the fourth level. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

If all nine palaces were planted with these Heavenly Origin Dao Fruit, and if their levels of maturity were all the same, then this signified that the nine Heavenly Origin Dao Fruits were already on the verge of maturity. Only a few days had passed, yet the fruit was already oozing with a pleasant fragrance.

‘Could it be that some unimaginable transformation is truly going to take place in the Medicine King’s Cave this time around?’

“This smell is slightly familiar,” a voice suddenly said from right behind Ling Han.
