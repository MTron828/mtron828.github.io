1506 Eight Stones Forbidden Land

Had you f***** come from the wild? Gone mad from poverty? Digging out even the steps?

This was really too ignorant of the ways of the world, right? Didn’t he see there was a palace at the summit? The things hidden inside would definitely be more valuable than what you were digging out now? Just how stupid could you be?

How short-sighted.

In this short instant, the seven of them stuck a sign of ‘country bumpkin’ on Ling Han. Only that kind of person would want to dig out these golden steps when they saw them. Err, though they were also slightly tempted. This was Level 16 Godly metal that had paved out a mountain path. Such wealth, tsk, too astonishing.

They held up against the terrifying mountain winds, and soon came closer.

“Yi!”

“En!”

“Tsk!”

When they saw Empress Luan Xing, everyone bore a stunned expression. Even the three women’s mouths were slightly gaping, their eyes wide. Though they were confident in their own beauty, and did not admit inferiority to any of the other three, in front of the Empress, even they had no choice but to concede.

The gap was not just a little bit. Even if they did not want to admit it, there was nothing they could do. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The four men were even worse. Two of them were already drooling, and their saliva had wet part of their clothes. It was as if they were idiots who had never seen a woman before.

How could there possibly be such a beautiful woman in this world? Every movement and gesture from her were perfection itself.

“Cough!” A young man was the first to come back to his senses, and said, “I am Hu Can, and these are my clansmen. Since we were able to meet in this boundless universe, it is clear we were destined to meet. Why don’t we work together to explore this Mystery Realm?”

When they heard his words, the other three men all looked excited, while the three women’s expressions darkened. They felt inferior in front of the Empress, so they naturally did not want all the attention to be drawn by the Empress.

Ordinarily speaking, if outsiders had appeared in a Mystery Realm that had such astonishing background, the first reaction should be to kill them to keep the secret, but who asked the Empress to be too beautiful? She was so beautiful that all their hearts had melted, and they actually brought up the suggestion of exploring the Mystery Realm together.

Empress Luan Xing didn’t even want to speak. Her attention was only focused on Ling Han, and as for the others? They were ignored completely.

Ling Han’s eyes swept over the group. He had already seen everyone from the low extreme of Eternal River Tier to the consummate level, so even if their cultivation level was higher than his, he could still estimate their cultivation levels through comparison.

Out of the seven of them, the speaker, Hu Can, had the highest cultivation level. He had reached the peak stage of the consummate level. It was extremely possible that he was a young big shot that was in no way inferior to people like Ren Feiyun and Qi Tian.

He was a little surprised. The highest authority in this area of the universe should be the Star Sand Saint, so those young king tiers who hoped to become Saints should have enrolled in the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy. However, Ling Han was very unfamiliar with these seven people. Furthermore, he did not spot the sign of the Star Sand Martial Arts Academy on their clothing, so they should not be senior brothers and senior sisters that had enrolled in the academy one or two million years ago.

Moreover, these seven people were too young. A difference of one to two million years was still very apparent. With Ling Han’s judgement, these seven people should be less than a million years old.

Less than a million years old, yet there was one in the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier, two in the early stage of the consummate level, three in the high extreme, and one in the medium extreme. This lineup was a little frightening. What place had produced so many top grade prodigies?

Ling Han thought such, but said, “No need, we will just depend on our own abilities!”

Immediately, Hu Can and his group looked displeased.

‘What kind of place do you think this is?’

The Mystery Realm left behind by the Heavenly River King! If news of it leaked out, putting aside such Eternal River Tiers like themselves, even Small Saints, Medium Saints, or even Great Saints would not be qualified to enter; this was a stage that only Saint Kings could enter!

And now, they were kindly inviting the two of them to explore together. Firstly, they were planning to give some face to the Empress, and secondly, they wanted to keep these two under their eye, and when they were done, they would definitely bring them back to the Forbidden Land.

What a joke; they had obtained the treasures left behind by the Heavenly River King. Could such news be allowed to spread out? Wouldn’t that then draw the attention and aggression from the other Forbidden Lands? Wasn’t it precisely the hidden treasure here that had caused the Ancestors of the Forbidden Lands to attack the Heavenly River King together?

He was not giving them face!

“Brat, you are so inconsiderate!” The only one in the medium extreme of Eternal River Tier walked out. His name was Hu Bing. “You really are a country bumpkin that has no idea of his own weight! This is the secret treasure of the Heavenly River King. The fact that you managed to come in here is already a mighty good fortune, and you still want a share of the loot?”

Hu Can and the others did not stop him. In their eyes, Hu Bing alone was enough to suppress this pair, and everything was fine as long as he did not injure that exquisite beauty.

Ling Han was surprised. These seven people actually knew of the treasure trove of the Heavenly River King? They knew of the situation in this place?

Then that meant that it was no coincidence that they had come here.

Ling Han couldn’t help but become interested, and he asked, “Where have you all come from?”

“Us?” At first, Hu Bing was disdainful of even speaking more with Ling Han, but when the exceedingly beautiful Empress’s eyes focused on him, with a sliver of curiosity in them, he immediately felt his blood boil and became rash. He very much wanted to show off a little, and immediately spoke up, “We come from the Eight Stones Forbidden Land!”

Eight Stones? Forbidden Land? What was that?

Ling Han looked at the Empress, and she shook her head slightly, expressing that she had never heard of this before. Thus, he deliberately spurred them on to reveal more. “What Eight Stones Forbidden Land? Merely the name sounds like no decent place, unable to produce any kind of elite; you all are a bunch of country bumpkins!”

C-country bumpkins?

This time, Hu Can and his whole group were furious. Whom was he calling country bumpkins? Ah, who was the country bumpkin here? Who was the one currently digging out the steps? Ah! He himself was the largest country bumpkin, and he still dared to call others that!

Hu Bing couldn’t bear it any longer, and declared, “You are a frog that lives at the bottom of a well, so you have never heard of the Forbidden Lands, of course! It should be known that our Forbidden Land has existed forever, and our origins are derived from the—”

“Hu Bing!” Hu Can and the others shouted at the same time, stopping Hu Bing from saying anything further.

Only then did Hu Bing’s face pale. He pointed at Ling Han and exclaimed, “You dare deceive me!” He should not have been so easily infuriated, but who let there be an Empress standing on the sidelines? This fact had dragged his intelligence level down endlessly.

Ling Han broke into a grin, and said, “You were the one who said the words; have I forced you? Just continue, where have the Forbidden Lands originated from?”

“None of your business!” Hu Can interrupted. “Miss, apologies. The treasure trove of the Heavenly River King is much too shocking, we have to ensure that the news would definitely not leak out. I would please trouble the two of you to stay by our side, and when the situation has eased, the two of you will naturally regain your freedom.”

Though he was saying these words, there was naturally another plan formulating in his head—for that man, just find some way and kill him; as for the woman, with her all on her own and having no one to rely on, wouldn’t it be an easy feat to approach her?

Looking at the exquisite beauty of the Empress, even he, a young king tier that was close to Saint level, could not stop his heart from throbbing wildly, and swallowed a few times.

Too beautiful!

He definitely had to deal with her before returning. Otherwise, there was a young big shot in the clan who had long since entered into the Saint level. If she drew his attention, how could he be qualified to compete?

That meant that they were planning to keep the two of them under house arrest? An idea came to Ling Han, and he exclaimed, “We have come from the Great Ling Forbidden Land!”

He decided to deceive these people again.
