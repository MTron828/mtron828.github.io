2659 Battle invitation from Heavenborn

Ling Han didn’t move, but a very loud commotion was heard from outside only after a short while. Clearly, Yi and Zhu Hongxuan had already come to blows.

This battle did not last very long. Very soon, calm resumed, and then Yi came striding back in.

Yan Xianlu couldn’t help but ask, “What does Heavenborn want?”

Yi took a deep breath, and answered, “He has issued a challenge of battle to Ling Han, to be held at the Thousand Winds Forest three days later.”

A challenge from Heavenborn?

Ling Han thought for a moment, and then asked, “What cultivation level is Heavenborn at now?”

“His progress is astonishing; he is already in the Seventh Heaven!” the Rain Emperor declared.

Not even 100,000,000 years had passed, and he had advanced through two consecutive cultivation levels. This speed was shocking. It should be known that the higher the cultivation level, the slower it would be to advance to the next level.

Ling Han cracked a smile. “Seventh Heaven? All right. Agree on my behalf. Three days later, we will battle at the Thousand Winds Forest!”

The Rain Emperor’s, Yan Xianlu’s, and Yi’s expression changed drastically, and they began to dissuade him.

“Ling Han, don’t be rash. Heavenborn’s battle prowess far surpasses his cultivation level, and the extent of his freakishness is not inferior to yours! He has once challenged a Ninth Heaven elite… and he won the battle!”

“Furthermore, this person’s physique is as tough as Divine Metal. That is the most terrifying aspect. No matter how strong a Celestial King is, they would only be suppressed by him, and there is no way to kill him.”

“By birth, he is already invincible, and is too difficult to deal with.”

Ling Han merely smiled slightly, and then released his reins on his cultivation level. Instantly, seven ribbons of iridescent light wrapped around him. Boom! A shocking aura spread out, and the Rain Emperor and the others all paled in shock.

“Fourth Brother, you actually have broken through to the Seventh Heaven as well!” After a moment of surprise, the Rain Emperor’s expression was filled with joy.

Ling Han nodded. Though he had already caught up to Heavenborn in terms of cultivation level, there was not much delight in his expression. That was because as he had planned it, he had wanted to break through to the Ninth Heaven within 100,000,000 years, yet now he was a whole two cultivation levels away from his goal. This was really far too divergent from his original estimations.

“In a battle at the same cultivation level, Fourth Brother’s battle prowess would definitely not lose to Heavenborn’s!” the Rain Emperor exclaimed, nodding his head.

“However, the greatest strength of Heavenborn is not his battle prowess, but rather his physique, which is similar to Divine Metal, which is indestructible!” Yan Xianlu was still worried.

Ling Han smiled. “It’s fine. I have returned this time to test out the strength of this guy. Even if he had not issued me a challenge, I would have still battled him.”

“Then… I’ll go and give him your answer.” Yi stepped out again.

Very quickly, a shocking great piece of news spread out. Heavenborn had issued a challenge of battle to Ling Han, which would be held three days later at the Thousand Winds Forest.

Instantly, the whole martial academy was in an uproar.

Who was Ling Han? Probably nine out every 10 people did not know, but there was practically no one who did not know who Heavenborn was. It wasn’t clear how many powerful disciples he had challenged on his path to the Seventh Heaven. The majority of his battles had ended with a complete victory, and even his occasional non-victories would be ending with a tie.

That was because no one could do anything against his physique. His physique was extremely tough, as if his body was made out of Divine Metal!

Only a Ninth Heaven Celestial King could refine Divine Metal, but he would still be unable to destroy Divine Metal, so how could Heavenborn be truly injured?

This was a monster!

And now this monster was actually challenging a person whose name had never been heard before. How could they accept this?

“Could it be that this Ling Han is a very low-profile person, but in truth is a great emperor at the peak stage of the Ninth Heaven?”

“That’s right, that’s right. If it was not for that, how could he be worthy of being challenged by Heavenborn? The latter has always only challenged those at a higher cultivation level than himself. In a battle of equal cultivation levels, even those as strong as Xiao Yingxiong, Miao Hua, and the others would not be a match for him.

“Wrong, you’re all wrong. This Ling Han… is only in the Seventh Heaven.”

“What?!”

“Heavenborn is actually challenging a Celestial King of the same cultivation level?”

“Hehe, It is said that Ling Han and Heavenborn come from the same dimension, and have been old rivals since long ago. Though Heavenborn got the upper hand, he was unable to kill Ling Han. Thus, this is their battle for the nth time.”

“I have also heard that the root of their grudge is a woman!”

“Ptui, then why have I heard that it was Heavenborn that had courted Ling Han, but Ling Han was not homosexual. As a result, Heavenborn’s love turned to hatred, and they had completely turned against one another?”

“You’re all wrong. Do you guys remember the Zhang San and Li Si that left their names on the Eternal Stone?”

“Of course I remember. Those two are definitely powerful people!”

“Ling Han is Zhang San; he is Li Si as well!”

“Gasp!”

“Then the battle between the two of them would be a spectacle to watch. Ling Han is definitely not weak.”

“So what? Don’t forget about Heavenborn’s physique. His physique is comparable to Divine Metal, and there is no need for him to be afraid of any Celestial King.”

“True, it should still be Heavenborn who has better chances of winning.”

The disciples were all discussing spiritedly, and became extremely gossipy all of a sudden. Furthermore, a great many forces were also mobilized by the news. To be worthy of a challenge from Heavenborn, Ling Han had to be an extraordinary person as well. They wanted to establish relations with Ling Han.

The whole academy was filled with anticipation, and the battle of titans that would take place three days later would be extremely exciting.

Yet Ling Han did not feel the slightest hint of nervousness before the battle. He was just spending time calmly with the women, as if the one that would be going into battle three days later was not him. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Husband, do you have confidence?” Liu Yutong and the other women asked.

Ling Han smiled softly. “Heavenborn, in terms of pure defense, has already attained the pinnacle of the Celestial King Tier, and what can truly destroy Divine Metal is only the power of the Heavenly Venerable Tier.”

“Then, what can be done?” Everyone was anxious, especially Bewitching Maiden Rou. She had personally witnessed how Heavenborn had unleashed his might. At the time, even the combined efforts of Ling Han, the Rain Emperor, Ji Wuming, Huo Furong, and company was not a match for him alone.

“It’s fine. Your husband is not someone to be trifled with, either,” Ling Han said smilingly. In these few years, he had also perfected his grasp of the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll. He alone possessed three Heavenly Venerate Techniques. Was that still not enough to qualify him to battle Heavenborn?

When the women saw how confident Ling Han was, they could only place their trust in this husband of theirs.

Three days’ time passed in the blink of an eye.

Because both parties involved in this battle were very well-known, and with some people deliberately adding fuel to the fire, not only did all the disciples of the present term come to watch when the time for the battle arrived, but some incredibly outstanding characters from the last few terms had come as well.

A’mu, Can Yue, Du Shiyi. These were all people who had left their names on the Eternal Stone. They had long since attained the peak stage of the Ninth Heaven, but the step into the Heavenly Venerable Tier was really too hard to take. Even now, they were still struggling earnestly at this cultivation level.

Even the three of them were here, which was clear proof of how much attention this battle had garnered.

The three big shot disciples stood in midair, their hands crossed behind their backs. They were too far to approach, with nine ribbons of iridescent light wrapped around them. Yet it seemed like these nine ribbons were close to fusing into one, and could not be grasped.

This showed that they were about to advance to the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier. Once they took that step, they would have leapt out of the range of Celestial Kings.

Heavenborn had long since arrived. As if he was a central figure that everyone revolved around, there was a crowd of people surrounding him. Meanwhile, he himself stood calmly, his arms crossed behind his back and seven ribbons of iridescent light wrapped around him, his abilities displayed to the full extent.

Just when it looked like time was passing continuously, but there was no sign of Ling Han at all, everyone began to get anxious.

“Where’s Ling Han?”

“It can’t be that he’s afraid to battle, right?”

“Hehe, if he agreed to the battle, yet cowered right before the battle, what face would he have left to stay any longer in the martial academy?”

“His infamy would really last for millenia then!”

Among the spectators, it was Zhuo Kai who felt the gloomiest. He had been harshly beaten up by Ling Han, and had initially planned to exact his revenge, but his power in the martial academy was limited. Furthermore, his ancestor was battling in the Realm Battlefield at present, and there was absolutely no way that he would return, so Zhuo Kai could only bottle up this anger.

Afterwards, Ling Han went off quietly to the Celestial King Graveyard, and Zhuo Kai had no further possibility of revenge.

Finally, he waited until an opportunity like this had come. He was extremely eager to see Heavenborn beat Ling Han up, but why hadn’t Ling Han come?

Right at this moment, a figure suddenly appeared in the distance.

It was none other than Ling Han.
