Chapter 1193: A Myriad of Secret Techniques

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Numerous light orbs hovered around the palace. If one looked closely, they would see that there were countless characters churning within these light orbs. However, these characters were blurry, and it was hard to see them clearly.

“Those are all... cultivation techniques!”

“I think I saw the Great Net Mind Refreshing Technique!”

“Purple Smoke Palm Technique!”

“Bamboo Heart Sword!”

The seven king tiers read name after name as they stared at the light orbs in the sky. The characters in some light orbs were easier to decipher than others.

“What?!” He Tao cried out in surprise. “Virtuous Origin Heart Sutra! I saw an incomplete copy of this technique in an ancient sect once. This is a profound cultivation technique, and even that ancient sect only owned a damaged copy. I heard that if one masters this cultivation technique, their Origin Power will gain the power of lightning. As such, they’ll be able to obliterate their enemy’s defenses with ease.”

This was an ancient cultivation technique, and it had been passed down for heaven knew how many tens of thousands of years. However, it had become a lost technique already, and only the inheritances of some ancient sects still contained scraps of records about it. Was this Virtuous Origin Heart Sutra the complete version, or was it an incomplete version?

If it were the complete version, its value would be incalculable.

At this moment, they understood that this was indeed a treasure storage. Moreover, the value of its contents was far beyond their imagination. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Xiu!

Shen Zhu’er was the first to leap up and grab at one of the light orbs. Her speed was incredible, and her hand was just about to clutch around the light orb. However, that light orb suddenly tremored, and it shot away at an even quicker speed. Shen Zhu’er had only been a whisker away from grabbing hold of it.

Shen Zhu’er landed back on the floor empty-handed.

The remaining six king tiers were all astonished. Shen Zhu’er wasn’t weaker than any of them. Thus, if she couldn’t grab hold of a light orb, then it was very likely that none of them would be able to, either.

Trying to obtain these inheritances would be immensely difficult!

The seven of them stopped speaking. They all locked onto a secret technique that they desired, and then leaped over to grab at it. It was as if the myriad of light orbs had come to life at this moment, and they all weaved around like agile fish. Light flashed through the air, and it was dazzling to the extreme.

After leaping around for a while, the seven king tiers gradually calmed down and stopped. When the last person stopped, the light orbs in the air also came to a rest. They were like stars hanging in the sky.

‘They’re truly difficult to obtain!’

The brows of the seven king tiers knitted into frowns. Although they were the king tiers of the younger generation, they were genuinely in a difficult situation at this moment.

Xiu, xiu, xiu!

Right at this moment, however, seven light orbs suddenly tremored and shot toward the seven people.

Ling Han and the others hurriedly caught the light orbs.

Pa, pa, pa!

They each caught a light orb with extreme ease.

What was going on? They hadn’t been able to obtain anything before no matter how hard they tried, yet these light orbs were actively shooting toward them now?

Pa, pa, pa, pa!

The light orbs shattered one after another.

Countless characters and images appeared in their minds, and along with them, different cultivation techniques and martial arts techniques.

Ling Han didn’t know what techniques the others had received. However, he received a movement technique called the Star Plucking Step.

Upon reaching the peak stage of this technique, he would be able to ascend the heavens with a single step, plucking the stars and grasping the moons.

Of course, this description was slightly exaggerated. Even so, it still revealed the impressive nature of this movement technique. As to what level one could reach with this technique, that depended on each person’s fortune and comprehension.

Ling Han skimmed over the movement technique in his mind. However, it was extremely complex, and it wasn’t something that he could digest in a short amount of time. He would need at least a few years to comprehend this technique. In fact, he might need a decade or even several decades.

Immortal level techniques were all like this—formations, pill recipes, and movement techniques were all the same. One would need to spend an exorbitant amount of time to comprehend, grasp, and utilize them.

However, Ling Han wasn’t annoyed. Instead, he was delighted.

He had the Reincarnation Tree, so time really wasn’t an issue. Moreover, the longer one needed to spend on a technique, the more valuable that technique would be.

Shen Zhu’er and the others also wore looks of delight. It was evident that they had each received an extraordinary secret technique.

They all looked up at the light orbs in the air, their expressions showing that they were hell-bent on obtaining more.

The random light orbs that had shot over had contained supreme secret techniques, so the value of the light orbs in the air was definitely unfathomable.

However, no more light orb shot over. It was as if those light orbs were the reward for them opening the door to this palace.

The seven king tiers lunged toward the light orbs again; unsurprisingly, they all came up empty-handed. No other light orbs shot over, and this left all of them extremely disappointed.

Countless treasures hovered before them, yet they could only look but not obtain them.

This was torture!

“Hehehe, do you want more cultivation techniques?” a voice suddenly asked. This voice was soft and serene, and it was as if it were right next to the ears, yet it also sounded distant at the same time.

“Who is it?!” the seven king tiers shouted in astonishment.

“Show yourself!”

“Don’t hide in the shadows!”

“You people want to see me that badly?” The voice drifted into their ears again, and tendrils of black aura formed in the surroundings. This black aura was the same as the black aura outside the mystery realm. Moreover, it even possessed an air of death.

The black aura formed a person amidst the seven king tiers.

“Who are you?!” Shi Anguo immediately asked.

“I’m naturally the owner of this place!” the person said.

Ling Han and the others glanced at each other before bowing, and saying, “Our respects, Senior.”

They were all proud individuals, so they naturally wouldn’t kneel. However, they had accepted secret techniques from this person, so it was only right that they bowed in respect.

“Raise your heads!” the person said as he raised his hand.

However, his body was relatively unstable, and it continued to drift and distort.

“All of you are supremely talented individuals who are worthy of receiving my inheritance.”

The seven king tiers bowed again, and said, “Thank you, Senior.”

“However, I only need one successor. Which of you is willing to acknowledge me as master?” the person asked.

Ling Han and the others glanced at each other again.

“Whom does senior want to take as a disciple?” they asked.

Although this person had claimed that they were the owner of this place, should they really believe his words?

As people who had become king tiers, they were naturally capable of making their own judgments. How could they blindly trust others?

“If I were to choose...” The aura-formed person purposefully paused and swept his gaze over all seven of them. It was as if he were observing their reactions. However, how could Ling Han and the others be affected by this? Their expressions remained calm and composed.

“I would choose him!” The person raised his hand and pointed at Ling Han.

“Me?” Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Apologies, but I have no intentions of acknowledging a master.”

Even if he wanted to acknowledge a master, he had a Saint in his Black Tower. There was no need for him to acknowledge this aura-formed person as master.

The person couldn’t help but feel astonished. Ling Han had actually refused his offer?

To the large majority of people, acknowledging elites as masters should have been an irresistible temptation.

However, Ling Han hadn’t hesitated at all before shaking his head and turning down his offer.

The aura-formed person turned his gaze elsewhere. He pointed at Shen Zhu’er, and said, “What about you? Are you willing to acknowledge me as master?”

Shen Zhu’er hesitated briefly before saying, “This junior already has a master, so I also have no intention of acknowledging a new master.”

His offer was turned down again?

The aura-formed person grimaced slightly. It was as if he had taken a blow, and he asked, “What about you people?” He pointed at the five remaining king tiers.

The five king tiers exchanged a glance, and then all shook their heads in reply.

This person had suddenly appeared, and was now tempting them to become his disciple. The seven king tiers couldn’t help but feel suspicious.
