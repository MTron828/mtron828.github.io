2986 Suppress

Golden Silk Moth gave everything he had, unleashing his most powerful ultimate technique.

Not only were his hands glowing, but even his body started to radiate with a brilliant glow. He then… transformed into an insect.

Ling Han grimaced upon seeing this. He felt a strong urge to burst into laughter.

‘Are you joking?’

This wasn’t an ordinary insect, and it was instead a golden silkworm that measured 300 meters in length. Its body was covered in rings of golden light, and it was more so exuding a boundless chaotic aura that was filled with a sense of sacredness.

This was the original form of Golden Silk Moth.

He was originally a silkworm, and after nine transformations, he finally advanced to the Seventh Tier. During his final transformation, he also returned to his original form, perfectly completing the cycle. However, this was a cycle that allowed his strength to rise explosively by countless times.

“Die!” Golden Silk Moth roared. He opened his mouth, and the rings of golden light on his body undulated before shooting toward Ling Han.

Weng, weng, weng!

The rings of golden light arrived 30 meters above Ling Han, yet they didn’t immediately slam down. Instead, they stopped for a brief moment before stacking together and forming a sheet of golden light.

Ling Han instantly discovered that he couldn’t move.

‘This golden light is able to restrict movement?’

Ling Han glanced around, and he immediately gave an oh in realization.

‘So that’s how it is.’

As it turned out, Golden Silk Moth was purposely trying to appear mysterious.

What was restricting Ling Han wasn’t the sheet of golden light above his head. Instead, it was the barely perceptible golden threads that were so fine that they were almost invisible to the naked eye. Perhaps even Sixth Tier elites wouldn’t be able to see them.

‘Is this his silk?’

However, after thinking about this for a moment, Ling Han realized that this was only natural. After advancing to the Seventh Tier and returning to his original form, of course this little silkworm would be able to spit silk.

These lengths of silk were imbued with the six fundamental powers, and it was because of this that they were incredibly tough and able to restrict Ling Han.

However… Golden Silk Moth was overestimating himself.

“Die, brat!” Golden Silk Moth charged down, spitting out the six fundamental powers and forming a divine saber that slashed down at Ling Han.

Ling Han shook his head as he channeled all of his seventh-grade seals again.

Snap, snap, snap!

With a lift of his arms, all of the golden silk around him instantly snapped.

He threw a punch at Golden Silk Moth.

Spectacular expressions immediately flashed across Golden Silk Moth’s face. In his eyes, this should have been his grand opportunity to counterattack and turn the tables. With Ling Han being restricted, he would have no option but to face his attacks head-on.

Even if his strength were inferior to Ling Han’s, his physique was definitely far superior to Ling Han’s.

He could remain unfazed after facing 10,000 or even 100,000,000 strikes from Ling Han. However, Ling Han would suffer severe wounds or even be killed after facing a single one of his attacks.

This was the freakish and unreasonable power of Seventh Tier elites.

Now, however, the situation was completely different from his imagination. This should have been his opportunity to land the killing blow, yet Ling Han had easily dealt with his ultimate technique, and then launched a counterattack of his own. In fact, it looked as if he were charging down to take Ling Han’s punch on the face.

Just how vexing was this?

Peng!

Just how quick were Heavenly Venerates? Before Golden Silk Moth could even finish his thoughts, the two of them had already clashed together.

The divine saber that Golden Silk Moth had summoned was like a paper toy as it crumpled before Ling Han’s fist. Meanwhile, Ling Han’s fist continued to surge forward, eventually slamming into his face.

The gigantic insect that measured 300 meters in length was instantly sent flying.

Ling Han shrugged, shaking his head, and saying, “Still so weak.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Golden Silk Moth was almost angered to death. Even though he wouldn’t suffer any wounds regardless of how many times Ling Han attacked him, hearing such contemptuous and demeaning remarks from a Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate still caused him to feel an immense sense of humiliation and anger so severe that he almost wanted to end his own life.

However, what could he say?

His strength was indeed inferior. Far inferior.

“I’ll pummel you until you yield!” Ling Han roared. He continued to bombard Golden Silk Moth with furious attacks.

Once Ling Han unleashed his might, Golden Silk Moth had no more opportunity to counterattack. His only option was to face these attacks head-on.

Even though these attacks didn’t hurt at all, this was still a tough mental challenge for Golden Silk Moth. He was filled with unbridled fury. In fact, he felt an urge to kill Ling Han even if this meant dropping back down to the Sixth Tier.

“Brat, my physique is indestructible and invincible, so your attacks are nothing more than mere tickles!” he roared. Even though he was being suppressed, he still tried to talk back and save some face for himself.

Ling Han cracked a smile, and said, “This is your grandpa spanking his grandson, understand?”

‘Grandson my a*s!’

Golden Silk Moth wanted to vomit blood. Just how many epochs had he cultivated for? The grandpa of Ling Han’s grandpa’s grandpa could easily be the grandson of his grandson’s grandson! Yet, Ling Han actually wanted to flip this around and become his grandpa? The issue was that he was genuinely unable to fight back at this moment. Was this not like a grandpa spanking his grandson?

Was he the most pitiful Seventh Tier elite in the world?

Ling Han’s attacks became increasingly relentless and ferocious.

However, he certainly didn’t feel like he was wasting his strength, nor was he losing himself in the euphoria of pummeling a Seventh Tier elite.

No, this wasn’t the case. Instead, he was doing this because Seventh Tier elites could be suppressed even though they couldn’t be killed.

This was Ling Han’s wild ambition at the moment. He was going to suppress a Seventh Tier elite.

In the face of Ling Han’s relentless attacks, Golden Silk Moth’s body also started to change. From its initial 300 meters in length, it had now shrunk to just 270 meters. This was a very obvious transformation.

This was the nature of being suppressed. Even though Ling Han’s attacks couldn’t wound Golden Silk Moth, they could indeed cause his physical form to change.

It wasn’t long before Golden Silk Moth shrunk to 240 meters in length, and then 210 meters, and then 180 meters… He shrunk more and more, and even when he eventually shrunk to one meter in length, Ling Han still didn’t relent.

Golden Silk Moth finally started to feel afraid. “Brat, what are you trying to do?!”

Ling Han grinned, and replied, “Remember to call me master in the future!”

‘Master? What is he trying to say?’

Golden Silk Moth faltered for a moment before suddenly coming to his senses. Ling Han wanted to become his master.

‘You’ve gone crazy!’

He was a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate! A Seventh Tier ultimate elite!

Hmph! Seventh Tier elites were indestructible and undying, and even paramount beings like Hysteria were unable to kill them. They were unafraid of anyone, so who could force a Seventh Tier elite to yield and become a subordinate?

No one. The answer was no one!

“In your dreams!” Golden Silk Moth spat coldly.

Ling Han simply chuckled in reply. ‘Just you wait and see.’

60 centimeters, 30 centimeters, 15 centimeters, two centimeters!

Under Ling Han’s barrage of attacks, Golden Silk Moth’s body eventually shrunk to just two centimeters in length. This size was already no different from ordinary silkworms. It was just that his body was completely golden, making him appear especially sacred and pure.

Ling Han grabbed Golden Silk Moth in his hand, with his devastating power like spiderwebs that wrapped around his body, preventing him from growing larger again.

This didn’t cause any harm to Golden Silk Moth’s body. To say nothing of two centimeters, he wouldn’t be injured even if he were to shrink 100,000,000 times more. However, the problem was that he, a mighty Seventh Tier elite, was actually being pinched in someone’s hand like a pet! Just how humiliating was this?!

If someone saw this, he would definitely lose all his face!

“Ling Han, I’m a Seventh Tier elite, a main force in the battle against Hysteria. If you capture me, will that be fair to the world?” he shouted. However, his body was extremely small at the moment, and this caused his voice to sound extremely childish as well. It was as if he had truly become a child.

“Pei! And I’m someone who can kill Hysteria! Yet how did you treat me?” Ling Han spat in disdain. “Obediently become my pet. When you decide to call me master, I’ll consider letting you go.”
