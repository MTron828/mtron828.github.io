Chapter 2265: Snatching

The Imperial Void Celestial King had moved!

The Eternity Celestial King humphed, and exclaimed, “Imperial Void, you have gone too far!” He moved as well, helping Ling Han to disperse this attack.

Boom!

The whole great palace trembled, and a terrifying storm of power surged out madly. All those Celestial Kings below Eighth Heaven were sent flying.

A Ninth Heaven Celestial King was too strong, and both Imperial Void and Eternity were two of the strongest of them. The aftermath of a single blow would have that kind of might.

Only Ling Han was still standing where he had been, for the Eternity Celestial King had blocked the attack that had blasted towards him.

“Eternity, you dare stop me?” Imperial Void Celestial King demanded menacingly, his expression icy.

In his awareness, there had long since been no worldly concept like right or wrong. Everything was for the sake of pursuing the true pinnacle of cultivation.

And now there was a chance laid out in front of him. Whether the other would give it to him of his own volition, or he moved to snatch this chance, he was determined to obtain it.

The Eternity Celestial King also looked furious as he exclaimed, “This boy has done a great service for the Celestial Realm, yet as his senior, you actually wish to deprive him of his treasure. Have you no shame?”

“Shame?” The Imperial Void Celestial King laughed loudly. “In the face of the survival of the Celestial Realm, you speak of shame with me? Hehe, Eternity, a cultivator should sever his emotions and connections. Your obsession is too strong. It is no wonder that your battle prowess has stagnated.”

The Eternity Celestial King sneered, “Imperial Void, do you dare swear a dao oath that you will be willing to battle for the sake of the Celestial Realm after becoming a Heavenly Venerate, right until your last drop of blood?”

Instantly, the Imperial Void Celestial King’s smile withdrew. For elites like them, dao oath was actually a questioning of their own hearts. Once they had sworn a dao oath, if they could not fulfill it, they would encounter great danger when they attempted to break through to a higher cultivation level.

This was a backlash that came from their own heart, and was more dangerous than anything else.

At first, Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings were already incapable of further progress, so they naturally had no need to fear any dao oath, but it just so happened that the Imperial Void Celestial King still wanted to become a Heavenly Venerate. That was a completely different story.

“No words to refute me?” the Eternity Celestial King scoffed. “Though this brat is outrageously bold, his words ring true. What has your line done for the Celestial Realm?”

Quite a number of Celestial Kings nodded at this. Originally, if there had been three Heavenly Venerates as their commanders, the pressure on Clear Heaven Pass would’ve been reduced countless times over.

The Imperial Void Celestial King frowned. He naturally would not be concerned about the opinions of these Celestial Kings, but at present, he wanted what belonged to Ling Han. If he angered these Celestial Kings, there was no way he could succeed. After all, there were indeed a few Celestial Kings that could be his equal, and if two or three of them joined forces, they would be able to stop him.

He suppressed his killing intent, and said, “The Heavenly Venerable Tier has surpassed the Regulations, and is not recognized by the heaven and earth. Every time one appears and makes a move, they would be taking the great risk of being killed by the heaven and earth. Thus, before reaching the very crucial point, how could a Heavenly Venerate possibly step out?”

These words gained the agreement of a great many Celestial Kings. The Imperial Void Celestial King was right. Though Heavenly Venerable Tier was superior to Regulations, they were also not recognized by the heaven and earth because of this.

“Excuses!” the Eternity Celestial King sneered. “Imperial Void, these words of yours will only be able to deceive those Celestial Kings that have just advanced! Eight epochs ago, the connecting point between the two Realms was already incredibly stable, and even the Heavenly Venerates of the Foreign Realm could enter. At that time, was there any Heavenly Venerate that had moved?

“Yes, but there was only one: the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable!

“He battled 11 Heavenly Venerates of the Foreign Realm, and in the final moment, he used himself to fuse with Heavenly Dao, barraging the connecting point of the two Realms, and causing it to shatter, and this was what guaranteed as much as eight epochs’ time to recuperate for the Celestial Realm.”

When these words fell, the newly promoted Celestial Kings and even the mighty figures that had only advanced to the Celestial King Tier in the latest five to six epochs were all stunned. This was a page of history that had been erased. Who would have imagined that the Celestial Realm had almost been conquered eight epochs ago?

Realization finally dawned on Ling Han. The Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable had died in that manner.

With him alone facing 11 enemies, no matter how strong the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable was, what could he do? There was absolutely no way he could be their match.

…Anyone who could become a Heavenly Venerate had to be a supreme elite. In a one-on-one battle, it was hard to say who would emerge victorious, what more when there was such a large disparity in the numbers.

Hence, in the end, the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable could only fuse himself with Heavenly Dao, and barrage the connecting point of the two Realms, causing it to shatter, and once again become unstable, winning the chance for the Heavenly Realm to rise again after the calamity.

But it had already been so dangerous at that time, yet still not one of the three great Heavenly Venerates moved. This was practically a betrayal of the Celestial Realm.

No, Small Tower was very wary of the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable and the others, so they must even have been on opposing sides. Then, these three were even more despicable. Could it be that they had still been holding the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerate back at such a crucial moment?

Ling Han really could think of no reason why the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable and the others would do that, but the truth was the truth.

The Imperial Void Celestial King’s expression was already dark. Fixing his eyes on the Eternity Celestial King, he declared menacingly, “Regarding the secret history of that era, my master as well as the other two lords have already decreed that it is to be forever sealed in that time, and you actually dare reveal it. That is a grave breach!”

“Hahahaha!” The Eternity Celestial King laughed loudly. “Didn’t you say that Heavenly Venerable Tier is unrecognized by the heaven and earth? How could it be that a Heavenly Venerate would come and hunt me down for such a paltry matter? Then I would really like to ask, is it those paltry events of the past that are more important, or is the resistance against the Foreign Realm more important?”

These words had really hit the nail on the head.

The Imperial Void Celestial King’s killing intent blazed, and solidified to enshroud him. “Eternity, I thought that you were a smart person since you could live so long, but now it looks like you only accomplished that because you had slightly good luck.”

“If the Celestial Realm dies, everyone will be finished. I truly do not understand what your line as well as the other two lines mean, just simply sitting by and watching as the Celestial Realm teeters precariously on the edge,” the Eternity Celestial King mused, emanating an indescribable grief and indignation.

If the three great Heavenly Venerates could join forces and battle, the situation would definitely be different.

“A short-sighted character naturally would never be able to understand!” the Imperial Void stated calmly. Stretching out a hand, he pointed at Ling Han. “Hand over this boy, and I will turn and leave. Otherwise… I will unleash a massacre today.”

“I don’t believe that!” The Everlasting Youth Celestial King stepped out, standing on the Eternity Celestial King’s side. He was also infuriated. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Neither do I.” Another Celestial King stepped out. It was the Thousand Words Celestial King.

“Me as well.” This was the Cloud Void Celestial King.

As many as seven Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings stood on the same side as the Eternity Celestial King, facing the Imperial Void Celestial King directly.

“Are you all tired of living?” the Imperial Void Celestial King demanded coldly. Among these eight Celestial Kings, only the Eternity Celestial King and Everlasting Youth Celestial King were worthy of his notice. Though the others were also Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, the gap in their battle prowess was a little wide, and he was completely unafraid of them.

“Even the line of Sealed Emotion cannot do as they please!” the Eternity Celestial King declared decisively. “I am definitely going to protect this brat!”

“Then you can all just go and die!” The Imperial Void Celestial King moved, stretching out a hand. Instantly, countless palms appeared in the palace, blasting out simultaneously at the eight great Celestial Kings.

The Eternity Celestial King roared furiously, and a celestial light surged out of his body, turning into an incredibly stunning Sword Qi.

The other Celestial Kings moved as well, charging to attack the Imperial Void Celestial King.

The nine great Celestial Kings battled fiercely, and very soon, they had exited the great palace. Flying into the skies, they broke out into an intense exchange of blows.

The Imperial Void Celestial King was indeed powerful. Even if it was only him against eight opponents, he still did not fall into a disadvantage, and the fact that he could be ranked as one of the strongest Celestial Kings was definitely not because of the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable.

“Han Lin!” A loud shout rang out, and Hong Huang walked over, his eyes set on Ling Han. “In the academy, you actually dared to rebuff my favor, and now you dare to disobey Senior Brother Imperial Void. You are merely seeking your own death!”

He lashed out, moving to attack Ling Han..
