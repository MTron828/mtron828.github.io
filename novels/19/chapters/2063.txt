Chapter 2064: All arrived

It was Zhu Huiyun.

Ling Han had come up with the idea of looking for Heavenly Dragon Bone Ashes here, so there was no reason that others would not have the same idea.

Wasn’t it so? Tian Qingyue had come, and Zhu Huiyun had also arrived.

When he saw Zhu Huiyun, Tian Qingyue couldn’t help but withdraw his gaze. He had no wish to lose his composure in front of this old rival.

“Celestial maiden Zhu, that’s him!” Behind Zhu Huiyun, a green-robed man pointed at Ling Han.

‘What are you pointing at me for?’

Ling Han tossed a glare at that person, his gaze a little fierce. It could not be helped. He had just been in a fight, and it was with a powerful enemy like Tian Qingyue at that. His energy was all maintained at the most alert and peak stage.

“I heard Zezhu say that you stimulated the black dragon bridge?” Zhu Huiyun spoke up, directing a question at Ling Han.

“What!?” Tian Qingyue exclaimed in spite of himself.

‘How is this possible?!’

The black dragon bridge was also called the Most Venerable Divine Path. It had never been trodden by anyone since the Hundred Dragons Mystery Realm first appeared. This was also called an impossible miracle, and only the Most Venerable Master of the heaven and earth could manage to conquer it.

However, a Ninth Heaven Celestial King would only be equal to the heaven and earth, so how could there possibly emerge a Venerate that surpassed the heaven and earth? DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Tian Qingyue realized that he had lost his composure, and hurriedly shut his mouth.

He looked at Ling Han, the jealousy in his eyes even more apparent than before.

Though there had never been one before, Tian Qingyue did not think that Zhu Huiyun had made a mistake.

Ling Han’s strength had reached an inconceivable extent. Even while he was only at Yang Soul, he could match Tian Qingyue. This had far surpassed the capacity of a monarch tier, so it was logical that he had been able to stimulate the Most Venerable Divine Path.

Why did this kind of honor not belong to him instead? Tian Qingyue clenched his fists tightly, forcibly suppressing the urge to make a move.

Meanwhile, Ling Han glanced at Zhu Huiyun. He had not made contact with this female monarch tier before. He nodded, and replied, “That’s right.”

There were too many people that had witnessed this scene. There was no need for him to hide that fact, nor could he do so.

Zhu Huiyun nodded, and then continued, “My master has made a prediction before that if the Most Venerable Divine Path is stimulated, one can obtain Blooms of Dao upon it. I am sure Brother Ling too has obtained a harvest, right?”

Ling Han’s eyes involuntarily narrowed. This woman’s master was most likely also a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. At least, he had to be an Eighth Heaven Celestial King. Otherwise, he could not have possibly been able to predict this kind of secret of heaven and earth.

Ling Han declined to comment, and only smiled faintly. This had already touched on personal secrets. There was absolutely no need for him to answer this kind of question.

“I would like to ask Brother Ling to part with some, and sell me 10 Blooms of Dao,” Zhu Huiyun said.

This was really a very large appetite.

Ling Han had only obtained 17 Blooms of Dao in total, and then after sharing with the three women, each person would only have five on average. And this Zhu Huiyun demanded 10 from the very start. Even if Ling Han had not shared with the three women, after selling to Zhu Huiyun, the number of Blooms of Dao in his possession would still be the minority.

Most importantly, Blooms of Dao were not like Dragon Crystals, and were even more valuable, so how could their value be measured in Star Stones?

…It should be known that this was a treasure that could only be obtained when one stepped onto the black dragon bridge. In a whole epoch, only Ling Han and Ji Wuming had managed to accomplish that.

Ling Han shook his head. “What Bloom of Dao? I have never seen such a thing.”

“Brother Ling, you are really being unfriendly here.” Zhu Huiyun’s pretty face darkened slightly, not angry but still intimidating.

When a monarch tier became angered, even the weather would change.

“Who do you think you are?” the Empress spoke up, an endless dignity rippling out. Though her cultivation level was not very high, her aura was definitely astonishingly strong. It was inborn for her, and no one would be able to copy that even if they wanted to.

Zhu Huiyun had already been a little angered, and now a further layer of cold ice came over the expression on her pretty face. She pointed a finger at the Empress, and demanded, “You actually dare act insolent towards me?”

“It was you who delivered your own face to ask for a beating,” Ling Han countered calmly. “I am not in the habit of hitting women, but if you continue to pester me, I will not be reserved, either.”

“Hehe, do you think that you can be invincible in this world just because you have stimulated the Most Venerable Divine Path?” Zhu Huiyun asked in disdain.

Cultivation level was a glaring shortcoming. There was a total gap of three minor levels between them, and taking into account her status as a monarch tier, that would be five levels. What right did Ling Han have to make such a threat?

Even if Ling Han had stepped onto the Most Venerable Divine Path, he would only be able to surpass four levels at most.

“Zhu Huiyun, don’t underestimate this person,” Tian Qingyue spoke up, his expression grim. “Let’s work together, and then we’ll share the Blooms of Dao between us equally.”

Zhu Huiyun was taken aback, and then blurted out, “You have already exchanged blows with him?”

If that had not been the case, why else would he have suggested joining forces?

Hold on, Tian Qingyue definitely had to have been unable to apprehend Ling Han… Heavens, this guy was only a mere Yang Soul!

She had underestimated him, she really had. How could someone who had managed to step onto the Most Venerable Divine Path be judged with conventional reasoning?

Though Tian Qingyue was not willing to admit it, he firstly wanted to kill Ling Han, and secondly, he also wanted to obtain the Blooms of Dao, so after a slight pause, he still nodded his head in admission.

Though Zhu Huiyun had long since guessed that, when she saw Tian Qingyue admit it of his own volition, she still couldn’t help but feel a jolt in her heart.

There was actually such a heaven-defying person in this world!

Immediately, a powerful killing intent radiated from her. If she did not get rid of this kind of prodigy, she would not be able to rest easy.

“Fine, we’ll work together to eliminate this person!” Her personality was incredibly decisive, and she immediately came to a decision.

Tian Qingyue nodded. He couldn’t kil Ling Han on his own, but it was highly possible now that Zhu Huiyun was added into the equation—they could capture Ling Han, and then forcibly refine Ling Han using Regulations like a cauldron.

Under the crushing pressure of the Dao of Heaven and Earth, no matter how tough his physique was, it would be completely useless.

The two super monarch tiers both showed an intense killing intent. The number of times they had worked together with another person was pitifully few, what more when it was to deal with a person who was inferior to themselves by three minor levels. If this was known to others, there would definitely not be a single person who would believe it.

Xiu!

Right at this moment, a figure suddenly sped over from the distance. He was moving astonishingly quickly, and there were two other people behind him whose speed was similarly overwhelmingly fast.

“Yi?” The person at the forefront immediately stopped, and asked Ling Han, “What is it? Gotten into some trouble?”

It was Ji Wuming.

Ling Han was just about to speak when he saw the two people behind Ji Wuming had also stopped. These two people were… Xia Houtong and Yu Huaqing.

The super monarch tiers that had entered this space had actually all arrived in unison.

“Why aren’t you running anymore?” Xia Houtong asked coldly. These words were directed at Ji Wuming.

Ji Wuming glanced at him, and scoffed, “I just can’t bother myself to tangle with you guys. Did you think I was afraid of you?”

“Hehe, what arrogant words!” The corners of Yu Huaqing’s lips crooked up in a grin, his demeanor very arrogant.

Meanwhile, Tian Qingyue and Zhu Huiyun were both a little confused. The two great monarch tiers that were their equals were actually pursuing Ji Wuming together, while the former two were presently just planning to join forces to take Ling Han down, and it just so happened that Ling Han and Ji Wuming seemed to know each other. When they mulled this over, it seemed quite strange.

Yet Ling Han came to a realization. “These two people also covet your Blooms of Dao?”

“Just two clowns,” Ji Wuming stated calmly. In the whole world, only Ling Han was worthy of being considered as a rival by him at present.

So what if Yu Huaqing’s and Xia Houtong’s cultivation level was higher than his? In the past, he had been a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, and stood at the apex of the Celestial Path. He had seen too many so-called supreme prodigies like Yu Huaqing and Xia Houtong, and also killed too many of them, so how could they possibly cause a stir in his heart?

Hearing Ling Han say this, Tian Qingyue, Xia Houtong, and the others also came to a realization. As it turned out, their goal was the same. It was just that their targets differed.

“Then, we won’t interfere with each other.”
