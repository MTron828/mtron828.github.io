Chapter 2376: The large black dog versus Wally

Ling Han was also surprised. He knew that the large black dog had long since gained the strength of a Celestial King, but in his eyes, Wally had always been mysterious and unfathomable. To think that he would actually die with a single strike; this was completely unexpected to him.

It was like there had been a person that kept bragging that he had been the top elite in this world, and everyone had believed him, yet in the end, he had been pounded into mush by another. This gap was really too far.

“Er… my condolences.” The large black dog patted Ling Han’s shoulder, looking as if this matter was completely unrelated to him.

“You damn dog!” Ling Han wanted to kick this guy, but the large black dog was the master of trickery, so how could he possibly allow Ling Han to successfully sneak an attack on him. He instantly dodged with a twist of his behind.

“Yi?” Ling Han was just about to speak when he shockingly discovered that the bits and pieces that Wally had fallen apart into were actually wriggling, and surging towards the same spot.

This was a little like millions and millions of ants returning to their nest. Very soon, these broken pieces gathered together, and began to fuse.

A spherical shape first appeared, and then it sprouted arms, thighs, and neck at the same time. When the head also appeared, the hands and feet also formed, becoming a human figure.

Wally had come back to life.

Both Ling Han and the large black dog were extremely stunned. ‘You have already been f****** blasted into bits, and you can actually still come back to life? Moreover, there isn’t even a scratch on you?’

“Interesting!” The large black dog raised his paws, looking like he wanted to play again.

Wally’s eyes glowed.?Xiu, he shot towards the large black dog.

“Yi, you don’t look all that powerful, but your destructive power is extremely astonishing,” the large black dog exclaimed. He waved a paw to block him, and actually a few hairs were burnt off of him, exuding a faint charred smell.

Ling Han knew that this should be Wally using Void Particle Energy. Hence, even if his cultivation level was not all that high, his power was still extraordinary.

“Let Grandpa Dog see what you’ve got!” The large black dog charged out. He did not use the great might of a Celestial King, but rather suppressed his cultivation level to spar with Wally.

Wally was aloof. He actually did not even ask why the large black dog wanted to attack him, and merely focused on evasion. Occasionally, his eyes would glow red, condensing terrifyingly destructive lasers of light.

The man and dog fought on and on. If the large black dog did not use Celestial King Tier’s power, he could do no harm to Wally at all. Instead, it would create a great problem for him.

However, once the large black dog used Celestial King Tier’s power, Wally would not be able to bear it, and would be very quickly smashed.

But Wally would not bleed, so no matter how many pieces he was shattered into, there was no need to fear. They would very quickly piece themselves back together, and he would come back to life.

Ling Han nodded internally. Wally had been created after the Dark Inverse Realm had expended the resources accumulated over several hundred epochs. If he could be easily killed by a Celestial King, that would be too undeserving of the price paid to create him.

“All right, all right. Let’s all just sit down and have some tea,” Ling Han said, smiling.

After the large black dog destroyed Wally a good few times, he finally stopped, and was even more curious about Wally now. If he, too, could possess this kind of recovery ability, he wouldn’t have to fear even Heavenly Venerates in the future, would he?

“You have expended 30% of my energy,” Wally said earnestly, and looked at the large black dog for a while. “Bad doggy!”

Pu!

Ling Han instantly spluttered. He could not imagine that Wally would suddenly pop out with this phrase after a long while of silence.

“Brother, how did you learn this move? Why don’t you teach it to Grandpa Dog?” The large black dog clapped a paw on Wally’s shoulder, looking like they were close brothers. This was extremely shameless.

Wally frowned. “I am a Supreme War Soldier built using superstring material. I am more inclined towards support, calculation, and analysis. You are a pure living organism of the canine species. How could you possibly be my brother?”

The large black dog’s expression instantly turned dark. No matter how he thought about it, the other’s words were all insults, but Wally had spoken them so seriously that it was difficult for him to show his anger.

But he soon showed an expression of shock, and turned to say to Ling Han, “What is this guy babbling about? Why doesn’t Grandpa Dog understand?”

Ling Han laughed, and replied, “You were birthed by your parents, and as for him? He was created. Hence, if you want to learn this ability of his, you have to first commit suicide. Who knows, maybe they can modify you into a War Soldier.”

The large black dog quickly shook his head. “Grandpa Dog is living so free and carefree, and has absolutely no wish to die.”

Ling Han grinned. “Damn dog, do you want to become a Heavenly Venerate?”

The large black dog’s eyes lit up. “What? You have some way, brat? Is there some kind of supreme celestial fruit? Quick, give it to Grandpa Dog. Will I become a supreme being upon consuming it?”

Ling Han glared at him in irritation. “Why don’t you just ascend to the heavens while you’re at it?”

“Brat, are you insulting Grandpa Dog?” The large black dog also responded with a glare.

Ling Han scoffed, and said, “Do you want to learn or not? If not, then forget it. It’s not that I have no one to teach!”

“Brat, you really can help me?” The large black dog was doubtful. It was much, much too hard to become a Heavenly Venerate. It was rare for even one to appear over several epochs. For example, after Heavenly Venerate Wu Le’s emergence, over a dozen epochs have passed, and only the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable had become a Heavenly Venerate.

A mere Ascending Origin Tier actually said that he had a way of becoming a Heavenly Venerate. How could a person, no, no, no, no, a dog believe that?

Ling Han put on airs, and grinned. “If you don’t believe me, then forget it.”

“I believe you!” The large black dog nodded hurriedly. “Come, explain it to Grandpa Dog.”

Ling Han patted Wally’s shoulder, and said, “Then it would be on his shoulders.”

“En?” The large black dog was very surprised, but thinking about how Wally clearly did not have a very high cultivation level, yet was still capable of harming his fur, and could recover even after being blasted to bits by a Celestial King, how could it be if there was nothing amazing about that?

He really was a character. Instantly, he said shamelessly to Wally, “Brother, let us talk closely?”

Wally released a green scan on the large black dog again, scanning him again.

“Why do you keep scanning me?” The large black dog bared his teeth. If he did not believe that the other held the secret to becoming a Heavenly Venerate, he would definitely pounce and give him a few bites.

“To examine if you have rabies,” Wally said seriously.

“Hahahaha!” Ling Han laughed raucously. This Wally was no living creature, so how could he possibly get sick? Clearly, this was Wally trying to get revenge.

“Woof!” The large black dog could not withhold himself any longer, and pounced, wanting to bite Wally, but Ling Han just managed to stop him. Thankfully, the large black dog, too, had his own judgment, and wanted to get the method to become a Heavenly Venerate out of Wally. Thus, Ling Han managed to stop him very easily. Otherwise, if a Ninth Heaven Celestial King truly raged, how could it be that Ling Han could manage to pull him back?

Wally still explained the essence of the Genesis World again, and also took out his formulae and models, completely confusing the large black dog. The latter was completely lost, and had absolutely no idea. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

This was natural. This was completely different from the Dao he cultivated. It was equivalent to having established a different cultivation system, but this was a study of the essence of heaven and earth, so it would not be considered heresy by the heaven and earth.

But the large black dog was very cunning. He could see the benefits of this kind of model and formula through Ling Han. Thus, propping up his head, he had already begun to ponder long and hard over it.

“I want to become a Heavenly Venerate. From today onwards, I will begin my seclusion. If anyone dares to disturb me, I will bite, no, pummel him to death!” the large black dog declared. He dug a hole and buried himself in it. He really was going into seclusion.

Ling Han snickered. Even if the large black dog was already a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, it was a small matter to comprehend that model, but more importantly, he had never touched Void Particle Energy and such before, so wanting to successfully convert the model into a “cultivation technique” was as difficult as ascending the heavens.

This damn dog would eventually come to beg him.
