Chapter 2247: Chicken Slayer

Only after flying far away on the Origin Magic Cube did Ling Han have time to appreciate and try out this new “toy.”

This was indeed a new toy. Using the Origin Magic Cube, he could control this entire heaven and earth.

If he so desired, the Origin Magic Cube would continue to evolve in this heaven and earth, eventually forming a new world, one which could birth all kinds of life forms. However, this region lay between the two realms, in the location of the Two Realm Battlefield. Thus, once it completed its evolution and thoroughly realized its existence, the commencement of battle between the two realms would most certainly rain death and destruction upon the beings that inhabited it.

Because this heaven and earth was far too low in level, with a core only equivalent to the level of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, it was only natural that the most powerful being of this heaven and earth could only reach this level at the maximum as well. Thus, their only fate would be to become cannon fodder on the battlefield.

After becoming familiar with this giant toy, Ling Han still needed to spend a long time to finally gain some insight into it. He unleashed his divine sense, causing the entire neutral zone to become his eyes.

He was the ruler of this realm.

He could see the two Monarch Stars from the Rare Earth Realm who were currently threatening the lives of everyone in the Celestial Realm.

If Ling Han wished, he could even kill Gaddalon and Yamu with a single thought. However, doing so would allow the Celestial Kings of the Foreign Realm to easily determine that the Origin Magic Cube was in his hands.

At that time, when a Heavenly Venerate of the Foreign Realm attacked, this realm would be completely incapable of withstanding his wrath. Its only fate would be transforming into nothingness.

Of course, a Heavenly Venerate of the Foreign Realm wouldn’t attack so rashly. This was because destroying this realm risked destabilizing the connection point between the two realms, in turn affecting their advance.

Why didn’t the Heavenly Venerates of the Celestial Realm interfere in this matter? If they seized the opportunity to destroy this realm, wouldn’t that hinder the assault of the Foreign Realm? At the very least, couldn’t they buy more time?

Well, this was a question for them!

A stroke of realization flashed through Ling Han’s mind. No wonder the large black dog viewed the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable with such contempt and disdain. They were far too passive when it came to dealing with the invasion of the Foreign Realm.

Ling Han naturally couldn’t stand by idly while his allies from the Celestial Realm were killed. With a single thought, he immediately teleported to the battlefield.

However, he still needed to cause some trouble for the Celestial Kings of the Foreign Realm. He would kill at least a dozen or two dozen of their Celestial Kings. Of course, he naturally couldn’t display too much of his power, or else he risked exposing his secrets.

Ailean was slightly surprised because he didn’t recognize Ling Han at all. “How may I refer to you, friend?” he asked.

Gaddalon and Yamu were both Monarch Stars, and their cultivation levels had more so surpassed the Fifth Secret. Their battle prowess was simply unfathomable. Meanwhile, there were only a handful of Immortal Palace Tier Monarch Stars in the Celestial Realm. Apart from Ling Han, there was only Xing Chenyue, Ji Wuming, and two other people.

However, Ji Wuming and the others were still receiving special training from the Celestial Kings, and they were aiming to surpass the Fifth Secret in the shortest time possible. Otherwise, they would be too weak to fight against the Immortal Palace Tier Monarch Stars from the Foreign Realm.

‘Xing Chenyue?’ Ailean thought to himself.

However, she was female, while this masked person was clearly male. Moreover, she was cultivating toward the Tenth Secret, so she definitely wouldn’t halt her cultivation to suddenly come here. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Right now, Ailean’s instinct was telling him that this masked person’s battle prowess was no weaker than his.

‘Strange… Who in the world is he?’

Ling Han smiled, and replied, “I’m a chicken slayer.”

‘Chicken slayer?’

Everyone grimaced upon hearing this. What kind of name was this?

However, he was from the Celestial Realm, so the chickens that he wanted to slaughter were naturally the cultivators from the Foreign Realm. Haha, this was a blatant show of contempt for the Foreign Realm.

Many people instantly chuckled upon hearing this.

“Shameless boast,” Yamu said in a menacing voice. Her 100 feet danced, and she was already charging toward Ling Han.

Whoosh!

She was clearly skilled with the Regulations of Space, and the space surrounding her instantly transformed into rippling waves, allowing her to travel through them as she pleased. Her speed was astonishing, and she already appeared before Ling Han in an instant. With her mouth agape, she bit down on the masked figure.

This was no simple bite. Instead, it was one that had drawn on the Regulations of Space. Her gaping maw transformed into an independent space, one from which escape was impossible.

Ling Han smiled as he threw a punch.

Peng!

The onlookers could only see a flash of white, yet Yamu had already been violently smashed back and sent flying.

Peng, peng, peng!

She obliterated thousands of celestial bodies before finally coming to a stop.

Those of a lower cultivation level were already unable to see Yamu’s whereabouts. Only those at the Immortal Palace Tier could faintly discern her figure at an extremely distant location. This was a gigantic insect whose body was bathed in green blood. Her state was as miserable as could be.

At this instant, everyone was transfixed with shock. They couldn’t utter a single word.

Yamu was a Monarch Star, equaling an Eighth Secret cultivator, yet she had actually been sent flying with a single punch? Who could believe this?

Even Ailean and Gaddalon hadn’t expected such a situation. Cold sweat instantly trickled down their backs.

Far too powerful; this person was truly far too powerful.

Whoosh!

There was a flash of white as Yamu charged back. She was skilled with the Regulations of Space, so a distance of hundreds of millions of kilometers was but an inch to her.

She glared at Ling Han, and there was a strong sense of apprehension in her eyes.

Even if she had underestimated Ling Han before, and even though she had been careless with her attack, it was ultimately because Ling Han was far more powerful than her that he had been able to send her flying with a single punch.

“10th layer of the Eighth Lotus!” Gaddalon said in a solemn and deeply apprehensive voice.

“Tenth Secret!” Ailean also spoke. He was more so feeling a sense of confusion. He could clearly sense that Ling Han’s strength was similar to his, so how had the other party suddenly become a Tenth Secret elite? This transformation was far too great.

Ling Han smiled with composure. To say nothing of the Tenth Secret, if he wanted to, he could even launch an attack rivaling the power of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate. He could kill a Ninth Heaven Celestial King with ease.

“Do you people believe me now? That I’m a chicken slayer?”

Fury instantly spread across the faces of the cultivators from the Foreign Realm.

Were they weak and frail chickens? No!

They were invaders; they were elites! Yet, they were actually being referred to as helpless chickens now? This naturally caused them to feel great humiliation.

“10th layer of the Eighth Lotus is indeed powerful. However, we aren’t short of such elites, either!” Gaddalon said in a calm voice. They could lose a soldier, but they couldn’t lose their morale. The might of the Foreign Realm couldn’t be lost because of them.

They had obtained a crushing advantage at both the Severing Mundane Tier and the Dividing Soul Tier. This wouldn’t—and couldn’t—be any different at the Immortal Palace Tier.

“That’s right. Sen Luo, 10th layer of the Eighth Lotus!”

“Nai You, 10th layer of the Eighth Lotus!”

“Wu Xin, 10th layer of the Eighth Lotus!”

“Chi Xue, 11th layer of the Eighth Lotus!”

Gaddalon and Yamu called out the names and cultivation levels of the Monarch Stars from the Foreign Realm. With each name they called, a delighted roar would erupt from the cultivators of the Foreign Realm. Their morale instantly recovered, and it even started to become more fervent and lively.

Meanwhile, the cultivators from the Celestial Realm felt extremely stifled. The Foreign Realm actually possessed this many Monarch Stars? In fact, someone had already reached the Eleventh Secret? This was far too terrifying.

This quantity and this quality… It was as if they had suppressed the entire Celestial Realm.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Let them come over. I’ll annihilate whoever comes my way!”

Even though his voice wasn’t loud, its infectious tone lit a flame of hope in everyone’s mind, expelling the frosty fear that had gripped their bodies.

“Leave!” Gaddalon roared.

There was a gap of two minor levels between them and Ling Han, so even if he teamed up with Yamu, they would still be no match for him. Being stubborn would be akin to seeking death.

They had no other option. The people they had mentioned either hadn’t come or were currently cultivating in seclusion, aiming to reach a higher cultivation level.

Ling Han stood with his hands clasped behind his back, saying in a calm voice, “One or two people will suffice to deliver this message. As for the others… your life ends here..”
