How many Powers of Dimensions had Ling Han fused?

No one was clear about it, but everyone knew that their quantity had to be staggeringly excessive, otherwise it would be absolutely impossible for a First Tier Heavenly Venerate to possess the power of a Third Tier.

Although He Liqun hadn’t been able to fuse more than one Power of Dimension, he had heard that he could make himself stronger in this way after reaching the Third Tier. Therefore, he was able to quickly deduce the secret of Ling Han being so powerful.

Inwardly, he was aghast, and even told himself that he had to take this opportunity to kill Ling Han; otherwise, when this guy advanced to the Second Tier, even if he didn’t have the strength to suppress He Liqun, the latter himself would also be unable to deal with Ling Han.

!!

So, this was the only chance.

‘Kill!’

He Liqun drew out a Heavenly Venerate Tool, which was a long dark golden spear. He made a sweeping motion with it, and boom, seven seals on the spear began to glow.

These were Heavenly Venerable Seals.

“Dark Moon Spear!” he yelled softly, stabbed out with the spear, and the entire world became dim and lifeless, but a dark moon rose behind him, exuding a strange aura.

He Liqun was going all out, using a Heavenly Venerate Technique, Heavenly Venerate Tool, and Heavenly Venerable Seals with the intention of suppressing Ling Han in the shortest possible time.

Ling Han also drew the Divine Demon Sword, and charged towards He Liqun.

The Heavenly Venerate Tools crashed into each other, and so did the Heavenly Venerate Techniques both of them used, all unleashing their strongest power.

Despite He Liqun being a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate, he had only mastered the seven widely known Heavenly Venerable Seals. He channeled them one by one, resonating with the seals on the spear, and it erupted with an even stronger power.

However, as long as he was in possession of a Heavenly Venerate Tool, how could he not have mastered these more widely known seven Heavenly Venerate Seals?

Did he gain an upper hand?

The two kept exchanging blows. He Liqun couldn’t gain the upper hand at all, and the duration for which the Heavenly Venerable Seals could release energy was limited. After seven hours, He Liqun could no longer channel the Heavenly Venerable Seals, and his battle prowess fell rapidly.

Usually, this wouldn’t have mattered. It could be said with certainty that 99% of Heavenly Venerates only mastered the more commonly known seven Heavenly Venerable Seals, while people such as Rain Emperor, Yi, and others had not even mastered these seven Heavenly Venerable Seals at all, because they did not have their own Heavenly Venerate Tools.

However, Ling Han was different. He obtained an incomplete seal when he became a First Tier Heavenly Venerate, and despite it being incomplete, its power surpassed that of those more widely known seven Heavenly Venerable Seals.

Weng!

When He Liqun’s battle prowess plummeted significantly, Ling Han’s battle prowess on the hand was increasing as he channeled this incomplete seal, which he called The Eighth Seal.

As tables turned, the originally equal battle prowess on both sides suddenly gave rise to a huge disparity.

Boom, Ling Han slashed with his sword. Although He Liqun countered with the Dark Moon Spear, he was unable to block Ling Han’s power at all, and was sent flying by the blow.

Ling Han stepped forward and quickly chased after him.

Ding, ding, ding, he kept slashing with his sword, and He Liqun also kept parrying, but every time he received a blow, his face changed drastically as he felt his chest boiling, and was experiencing unspeakable pain.

After more than 10 sword strikes, He Liqun was sent flying unmeasurably far. With a bang, he fell to the ground, knocked out a deep hole, and disappeared completely from sight.

However, it was only for a brief moment. With a bang, the ground shattered, and He Liqun came charging out murderously. He was holding the Dark Moon Spear, with blood dripping from the corner of his mouth and disheveled hair, looking extremely battered.

With the disparity in battle prowess being more than tenfold, fighting recklessly would naturally bring about such results.

He Liqun looked meaningfully at Ling Han. The former no longer intended to continue fighting, but rather wanted to leave immediately. As long as he could recover his power, even a freak like Ling Han would not be his match. He still had such confidence on this matter.

“Humph!” How could Ling Han possibly let him go, so he pursued him.

However, it couldn’t be helped that it would indeed be too difficult for one party to prevent it if the other party wanted to escape when both sides had similar strength.

He Liqun had taken off first, always maintaining a slight lead, with Ling Han being unable to draw any closer to him.

Fortunately, there was only one exit here, and it would be impossible to pass through the crevice in the ground quickly enough, which gave Ling Han enough time to block He Liqun’s path.

Seeing that they were approaching the crevice, boom, a mighty attack was shot over, directly aimed for Ling Han.

This was the power of the Third Tier.

Ling Han had no choice but to turn around, and threw a punch. Peng, energy exploded, setting off a tremendous storm that reverberated in this underground world.

He turned his head, and saw that He Liqun had already escaped through the crevice in the ground.

…Although it required some time, just an instant was enough.

He Liqun was definitely out of reach now.

Ling Han’s face was dark. He turned around again, and looked at the person who had made a move against him.

That was… Shen Fei.

Seeing that Ling Han looked angry and wanting to attack, Shen Fei chuckled. “I have to admit, your battle prowess is indeed amazingly strong, but Brother Wu, Brother Zhao, and Brother Niu will advance or retreat in unison with me. You will be fighting against four of us on your own, so what are your chances of winning?”

The ones whom he named were all Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates, who would now still have the battle prowess of Third Tier.

Ling Han was indeed very strong, being practically invincible among Third Tier Heavenly Venerates, but he was only one person, after all.

“Truly shameless!” the 12-headed lionman said coldly. “I really detest the looks of you. Brothers, let’s beat up this guy together.”

“Alright!” The other anomalies nodded one after another.

Shen Fei couldn’t help as his expression changed drastically. If he was on the fifth spatial level, he would naturally not be afraid of these people, as he could have suppressed them with a flip of his hand. But now that 100 or so Third Tier Heavenly Venerates were going to attack in droves, how could the four of them be able to fight against them?

“Don’t be impulsive. I can promise to bring you out of here, and let the higher-ups decide your fate,” Shen Fei quickly said as he knew that most would have the same idea he did.

Therefore, it would be best to calm these anomalies first since none of them could escape anyway. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Hehe, don’t worry about it. Thrash first, talk later,” a six-armed monkey said. He had a violent temperament, and took the initiative to attack, launching himself against Shen Fei.

When he made such a move, other anomalies also attacked one after another, and suddenly it became a pack of over 100 anomalies beating up four people, which naturally was an absolutely one-sided battle. This also intimidated Shi Mengyu and the other Third Tier Heavenly Venerates, and they did not dare to intervene at all.

Fortunately, these anomalies were just thrashing Shen Fei and the others, and had no intention of taking their lives.

“Brother Ling, please persuade them,” Shi Mengyu said to Ling Han. She had always been a person who would try to play mediator. She couldn’t just watch as four Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates were beaten to death, right?

Even if they wouldn’t be beaten to death, it wouldn’t be good to be ganged up on like this. How would these people face anyone in the future?

Ling Han shrugged. “I’m not one of them, so why would they listen to me? Do you think I’m really collaborating with the enemy?”

...

Ling Han definitely wouldn’t persuade them. It was precisely Shen Fei’s move that allowed He Liqun to escape. Ling Han couldn’t vent his frustration, and yet they still wanted him to stand up for them?

Dream on!

Shi Mengyu couldn’t persuade him further. Ling Han’s direct words instantly rendered her speechless.

After thrashing for a long time, the monkey, the lion, and the other anomalies finally stopped. It could be seen that Shen Fei’s group were all bruised and battered, making for an extremely tragic scene.

These four people felt so humiliated and enraged that death seemed like a better option. As dignified Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerates, they were actually ganged up on by a bunch of Third Tiers—how could they tolerate this?

But none of them intended to go all out. If they hadn’t even had this bit of fortitude, how would they have been able to become Fourth Tier?

They would definitely seek revenge!
