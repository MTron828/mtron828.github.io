Chapter 575: Sword Heart Illuminated

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

After crossing past the great threshold of ten flashes of Sword Qi, Ling Han cultivated nine more flashes smoothly, but the twentieth flash of Sword Qi was another threshold, blocking him for a long time.

Feng Po Yun was really generous to Ling Han as a sworn brother. In the Monkey Wine he left, he especially sealed some martial intent—when Ling Han drank it, this martial intent would also circulate throughout his body, increasing his all-around martial arts comprehension.

This made Ling Han extremely shocked.

Reaching the Spiritual Infant Tier, one would be able to brand a weapon with martial intent, and with long-term nourishment, it could become a Spirit Tool. After advancing into the Flower Blossom Tier, one could brand with martial intent special materials to create spirit talismans.

Spiritual Infant Tier warriors were even more kickass, writing their martial intent into law decrees which could suppress the world!

Of course, Deity Transformation and Heaven Tier elites could also write law decrees that were more powerful. Ling Han also wrote law decrees in the previous life; it was very convenient, intimidating enemies without personally taking the field.

However, sealing martial intent into alcohol that could be taken in and made for personal use... Ling Han could only be impressed with this method.

Martial artists refined Origin Crystals and could also leave a trace of martial intent, but it was far from being comparable to this.

Feng Po Yun was a grandmaster in the way of the sword!

The reason he left martial intent in Monkey Wine was obviously because he also saw that Ling Han was a sword user, so he specially helped him. This martial intent was extremely pure, without a shred of impurity; it was simply the supreme comprehension of the way of the sword.

For Ling Han, this gift was truly priceless!

Five days ago, Ling Han kept increasing his cultivation; Monkey Wine didn’t increase his tier as crazily as it did the first time, but it still allowed him to reach the sixth layer of the Flower Blossom Tier.

In the following five days, Ling Han studied Feng Po Yun’s sword path, but didn’t absorb it directly, using it as reference.

If absorbed directly, with Feng Po Yun’s level in the way of the sword, it was enough to take the initiative, influencing Ling Han’s own path into only being able to take Feng Po Yun’s path. However, he’d already decided on his own path, so he obviously had to jump out of this loop.

The good qualities of others could serve to polish one’s own qualities.

Feng Po Yun cultivated sentimental sword, extreme in affection. He loved only one person in his entire life, and even after the other person’s death, his feelings didn’t change and his obsession didn’t wane. Honestly, Ling Han couldn’t comprehend such sword intent anyway. It was true that he loved Heavenly Divine Phoenix Maiden, but he definitely couldn’t be as besotted as Feng Po Yun.

He only extracted Feng Po Yun’s comprehension in the way of the sword. After all, this was what Feng Po Yun gained in several hundred years of diligent cultivation, and at the heights of the Shattering Void Tier, it already surpassed the level of Sword Qi and Sword Ray, reaching Sword Heart.

Sword Heart illumination; even with a stalk of grass in hand, one could strike down the stars.

Feng Po Yun’s Sword Heart shined within Ling Han’s consciousness. Ling Han used Feng Po Yun’s Sword Heart to illuminate his own, increasing comprehension on the sword path to form Sword Qi.

After five days, Ling Han flicked his right hand, and shua, shua, shua , nineteen flashes of Sword Qi swept out, while the twentieth flash moved indistinctly at his fingertips, hidden and not unleashed.

It had sprouted.

Ling Han continuously moved his fingers, and the twentieth flash of Sword Qi became thicker and thicker, soon forming.

“The twentieth flash of Sword Qi is a threshold, and after crossing over it, the power at least doubled.” Ling Han nodded. Previously, when he felt immense pressure fighting against Xuanyuan Zi Guang, it was mainly because the opponent grasped Sword Qi that surpassed twenty flashes, achieving a qualitative change.

“Now, fighting against that guy, I have fifty percent chance of winning.

“It can’t be helped that I can’t use Mysterious Three Thousand. The strongest art can’t be used, or else I could decide the outcome in one move.

“While there’s still time, I’ll continue to cultivate Sword Qi. Since I’ve crossed the great threshold of twenty flashes, I should be able to cultivate several more flashes in a short amount of time.”

Feng Po Yun’s Sword Heart’s aura was still present, so Ling Han obviously wouldn’t waste it. This was an extremely rare chance; even Feng Po Yun might not be able to do this that many times. Severing one’s own Sword Heart to give part of it to others was a type of injury to oneself.

Ling Han exclaimed that this big brother was truly a sentimental personal. Just because they became sworn brothers, he generously gave him such an opportunity.

He had to reciprocate this well in the future.

After three more days, Feng Po Yun’s Sword Heart finally disappeared.

Ling Han stopped and waved his right hand; 23 flashes of Sword Qi flashed by, terrifyingly shocking.

“How unfortunate. With a month more, I would push Sword Qi to the limit of 29 flashes!

“But, is 29 flashes truly the limit?”

Ling Han didn’t know. This was something that he would know only after he personally advanced into that level. The so-called limits were made to be broken; for some people, ten flashes was the limit, and for others, twenty flashes was the limit.

He exited. Zhu Xuan Er greeted him, and said, “Brother Han, you finally came out of seclusion. Sister Hong’s almost worried sick. The contest stars the day after tomorrow.”

Ling Han laughed, and said, “Let her worry, I still haven’t taken appearance fees from her.”

“Oh. right...” Zhu Xuan Er took out a few head-sized rocks from a spatial ring. The colors of the rocks varied: there were black ones, yellowish brown ones, and purple ones. “These are the star fragments that big brother struck down—after the people in the city picked them up, they didn’t dare to keep any themselves, giving it to Brohter Han to deal with.”

Fallen star metal!

Ling Han exulted, and examined a few of the meteorites, revealing a smile. He said, “Blood Rainbow Iron, Dragon’s Tooth Gold, Crimson Cloud Bronze Stone... haha, all are seventh tier rare metals!

“Unfortunately, there isn’t even an eighth-tier one. Haha, well, can’t be too greedy; seventh tier rare metal is already not bad.”

Ling Han said to Zhu Xuan Er, “You should change your sword. This is seventh tier rare metal; nourish it daily and brand it with your own martial intent, and it’ll become a seventh-tier Spirit Tool in the future!”

“Thank you, Brother Han!” Zhu Xuan Er said softly, exuding tenderness and love at Ling Han and looking like she would let him do as he pleased.

“Don’t seduce your brother, my will is quite firm!” Ling Han pinched her smooth jade-like chin, and then brought her into the Black Tower. He was going to refine those star metals into weapons.

These could only be called iron ore; from purifying to burnishing, and refinement, it wouldn’t be completed without around half a year’s time even if given to the most remarkable ironsmith.

However, inside the Black Tower, everything became extremely simple.

Ling Han was like a god, unleashing tenth tier divine fire and easily melting these ores. ridding them of impurities. In only half a day, the ores were thoroughly tempered.

“What shape do you like?” Ling Han asked Zhu Xuan Er. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Under Zhu Xuan Er’s constant adjustments, Ling Han forged a precious sword with a thin but extremely sharp blade. This wasn’t a Spirit Tool yet, and needed the constant nourishment of martial intent; the level of the raw material was still there, though.

Ling Han also forged one for himself, but his brute force was too terrifying now. The hundred-pound sword in his hand was no different than an embroidery needle, and didn’t feel heavy at all.

Next, Ling Han forged a bow and ten arrows for himself, but the bowstring still had to be found otherwise.

After completing all this, the Spirit Treasures Pavilion’s once-in-three-years contest was finally about to start.
