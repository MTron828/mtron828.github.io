Chapter 2219: Important decision

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable laughed loudly. “Jiuwu, just how many epochs has it been since you became a Heavenly Venerate? And you are actually afraid of a few juniors!”

“Humph, so what?” The slit eye scoffed. “As long as they can possibly pose a threat to me, I will erase all of them! Too bad that memories would also be erased after leaving here. Otherwise, you could not possibly have become a Heavenly Venerate, either!”

Hearing this, realization dawned on Ling Han and his group. As it turned out, this Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate was even attempting to kill the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable in the Timestream, but at the time, he had not succeeded, and once he left his place, all the relevant memories would disappear. Even a Heavenly Venerate would not be exempted. Otherwise, even if the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable had heaven-defying good luck, he could not have possibly avoided being hunted down by a Heavenly Venerate in real time.

Only after returning to this place would the memories that had disappeared recover, and Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate would recall that he had previously attempted to erase the younger Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable from history, changing his destiny.

But the stronger a mighty figure was, the harder it was to change because there were too many implications. With this kind of power of heaven and earth and lashback from karma, even a Heavenly Venerate would find it very difficult to succeed.

For example, Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate now wanted to kill Ling Han and his group, yet it just so happened that the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable came out to rescue them. This was a kind of power from karma.

“There is no absolutely determined future, so even if I wish to go against the will of heaven, what of it?” The slit eye trembled, and actually walked out of the distance, becoming a giant that was millions and millions of meters tall.

He donned bright yellow robes, wearing a black imperial crown. There was only a single slit eye on his forehead, exuding divine light, as if it could see through the past and future.

He was standing right there, yet seemed like he did not exist at all, which was extremely mysterious.

“With me here, you cannot kill anyone!” Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable declared proudly, and then shouted at Ling Han and his group, “Hurry up with your real business here!”

Though Ling Han and his group very much wanted to watch the great battle of Heavenly Venerates, they also knew the danger of that. Only a shock wave from a single attack of a Heavenly Venerable Tier would be able to kill them 10,000 times over.

If they insisted on watching the battle, it would be equivalent to committing suicide.

“I’ll send you off!” The Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable moved, and a great power surged out. Instantly, the five of them were thrown out. They could see grass flying beneath their feet, and traveled a boundless distance in an instant.

Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate moved, wanting to stop Ling Han and his group. He had absolutely no intentions to exchange blows with the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable. The latter had already died in history, yet he himself had lived till the present and future. If he battled with the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, it was possible that he would be severely injured or even die. What was the point, then?

The Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable laughed, and with a wave of his hands, Ling Han and his group sped up further. Then, he turned his head, and faced Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate directly.

“Going against the era, it is destined that you cannot possibly succeed!” he said.

Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate smirked coldly. “In front of me, there is nothing impossible! Even if there is great karma from the heaven and earth, so what? I have already surpassed Regulations, and even the heaven and earth can do nothing against me!”

He moved aggressively, wanting to blast the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable aside so he could hunt down Ling Han and his group.

The Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable also had no intention of battling him to the death. Though he had seen how he would be dying in the future, he presently had endless attachments that he could not let go of, so how could he possibly risk dying to battle the Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate to the death?

For those that had reached heights that they had, who was not the most outstanding prodigy of an era, so who would be weaker than the other?

Since it was a matter of the future, it should be left to be resolved in the future. The goal of the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable was very simple, and that was to save the lives of Ling Han and his group.

The two great Heavenly Venerates battled fiercely. Even the slightest movement would produce an incredibly mighty power easily capable of killing a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

Thankfully, Ling Han and his group had already been sent far away enough by the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable. Otherwise, even if they were in a place with such chaotic time like this, the attack of a Heavenly Venerate would still be able to penetrate time, and land a lethal blow on them.

When the Heavenly Venerate power on them was fully expended, they stopped automatically. They saw that they had crossed over the grassy plain, and multiple crystalline pillars lay ahead of them. These pillars reflected their figures, yet their reflections moved differently.

Some were going around in circles, some were seated in cultivation, and some were scratching their heads madly.

“Is this an illusion?” Bewitching Maiden Rou asked.

Ling Han thought, and then shook his head. “Since this is the Time Mystery Realm, time itself is chaotic here. Perhaps what we see is a certain fragment of the future.”

“En.” Both the Empress and the Rain Emperor nodded.

“It should be this place.” Ling Han surveyed the surroundings. According to what Small Tower had said, this was the end of the Time Mystery Realm, and plucking the power of Time here would grant a chance of building a Mystery Realm of the human body, and advancing into the Immortal Palace Tier.

The five of them each found a position, and then sat down cross-legged, beginning to break through to Immortal Palace Tier.

This was similar to a scene that had appeared in the crystal pillars. Clearly, this place had already recorded a fragment of their future.

The mystical power of Time was indeed extraordinary.

Ling Han’s heart soared, making contact with the mystical power of Time around him.

There was the past, present, and future. Time had taken the form of shards, which was incredibly amazing.

After so many years of settling, Ling Han had long since been equipped with the qualifications to break through to the Immortal Palace Tier. Thus, when the mystical power of Time came, strong enlightenment immediately rose up in his heart.

Correspondingly, some mysterious change had also taken place in his body inside the Black Tower. It was exuding a brilliant light, dazzling and eye-catching.

Ling Han hesitated slightly about which of the five organs he should cultivate.

“Heart first, then.” He soon came to a decision.

The heart was the leader of all six organs. When the heart was clear, so was the spirit.

However, before breaking through to the Immortal Palace Tier, there was one more thing he had to do.

And that was to take all the divided souls back into his body—for ordinary Dividing Soul Tiers, that was four souls returning to one, but for Ling Han, it was nine divided souls combined into one.

Sensing that they were about to be fused again, the nine divided souls all expressed defiance. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

They were not Ling Han’s souls, but rather the nine Source Powers of heaven and earth. Previously, they had existed in the form of a divided soul, which was equivalent to them having been granted an independent life. And now that Ling Han was about to take them back into his body, it would be equivalent to erasing their independence. They were naturally dissatisfied with this.

However, they were a part of Ling Han that had been split off, and Ling Han was their master. There was no way that they could resist.

Ling Han paused slightly. Then, gritting his teeth, he decided not to fuse the nine Source Powers of heaven and earth.

He already had the imprint of the Source Powers of heaven and earth in his body. Thus, even if he released the nine Source Powers, it would not affect his future comprehension. However, his strength would definitely be greatly affected.

For example, he definitely would no longer be able to use Great Clash of Source Powers.

But once Ling Han’s decision was made, he did not hesitate any further.

He had always believed firmly in his own strength. No matter how strong external factors were, there would ultimately be a limit, while his own strength was what truly had no limits.

The nine Source Powers had already given him extremely great help, so granting them freedom would also be showing thim respect and gratitude.

That was the case!

Ling Han’s body in the Black Tower trembled, and the nine divided souls all fell out of his body.

He did not want any external objects, and wanted to advance into Immortal Palace Tier with the purest self, breaking through to become the strongest.

The nine divided souls all expressed gratitude towards him. Throughout the ages, who could be so domineering and confident in themselves?

Ling Han extracted the mystical power of Time, and began to temper his heart so he could construct the first Mystery Realm of his body..
