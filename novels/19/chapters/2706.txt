2707 Last-minute preparations?

Ling Han nodded. “Brother Du has already returned to the martial academy to report the news.”

When these words fell, everyone sighed in relief.

Good. They could hold on for a few more years, and they would definitely manage to succeed. They had already stayed on defense here for 100,000 years, so continuing to defend for a few more years should be no problem.

With the help of the terrain here, there was actually not much difference if there were seven or 70 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates besieging them here. That was because the attacks that they could deliver were limited, and were only so many.

At the mouth of the canyon, the number of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates that could attack at the same time was around 10. This also exerted a powerful pressure on them, causing great strain on A’mu and the others.

Thankfully, they were not using their own power to resist; instead, they were using Heavenly-Venerable-Tier treasures.

Thus, as long as these treasures could still be used, they would be able to continue holding on.

None of these were real Heavenly Venerate Tools, but had rather been forged by Heavenly Venerates. Because Devouring Metal was limited in amount, how could it possibly be bestowed on their juniors.

Ling Han did not move, but rather began searching in the canyon. According to Du Shiyi’s memories, he had vaguely glimpsed the existence of Crimson Inferno Divine Flame Stone.

…After all, they had been staying here for 100,000 years. Even if they had been fighting all this time, there would’ve somehow been that little bit of time where they could observe the surroundings here.

Ling Han was searching. If there really was Crimson Inferno Divine Flame Stone, he would immediately cultivate the Indestructible Divine Metal Physique to perfection. By then, he would be able to turn their defensive stance into an offensive stance, and charge into that group of Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates with his own power, eliminating all his enemies.

“What are you standing around for? Come and give us a hand!” another Celestial King shouted at Ling Han.

His name was Liang Taiming.

“Hold on.” Ling Han’s eyes searched his surroundings. If he did not find the Crimson Inferno Divine Flame Stone, he could only flee once this line of defense was broken. With the combined force of over 100 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates, even if they were of the weakest level, they still weren’t something that he could match.

Du Ba, Liang Taiming, and the others were almost maddened with fury. If it was not for the fact that they could not free themselves now, they would definitely give Ling Han a harsh beating now.

Even Can Yue and A’mu were slightly displeased. ‘At present, all of us are in the same boat; you are going too far.’

Ling Han did not explain. Even if he did, these people probably wouldn’t believe him, either. For a Ninth Heaven Celestial King to be able to eliminate about 100 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates, wasn’t that the stuff of fantasies?

Ling Han had to find the Crimson Inferno Divine Flame Stone first.

After a search, his eyes paused on a groove on the mountain wall. There should have been a stone here before, but it had been removed. The marks were still very new.

“Who removed the stone here?” Ling Han asked.

No one answered him. ‘Just what are you here for?’

“Brother A’mu?” Ling Han looked towards A’mu.

A’mu had initially not wanted to reply, but having Ling Han call him out directly, there was nothing he could do about it. He answered, “It is with Brother Zhuge.”

Brother Zhuge’s name was Zhuge Xuanming.

Ling Han already knew who each of them was from Du Shiyi’s memories. He turned to look towards Zhuge Xuanming. “Brother Zhuge, please hand that stone over to me. It will be very useful for me.”

“Scram!” Zhuge Xuanming was furious. ‘You keep giving all sorts of excuses when we ask you to defend against the attacks. Now, what are you planning?’

Ling Han shook his head. “Sorry for this, then. I have no time to explain now. You guys will know in the future.”

He moved directly, and grabbed out at Zhuge Xuanming.

“You traitor, could it be that you are a spy?” Zhuge Xuanming also countered with full force, meeting Ling Han’s movement with his own attack.

However, what other Ninth Heaven Celestial King was capable of resisting Ling Han?

Even a super freak at peak-stage Ninth Heaven, with an Evolution Index that reached 12, could not… unless he, too, could use the fundamental power of the Genesis World to temper himself like Ling Han.

Peng! With a single blow, Zhuge Xuanming was throwing up blood from the impact, his expression incredibly dispirited.

“You…” Everyone was outraged. Even Can Yue and A’mu were no exception. Ling Han had really gone too far.

However, they were immediately shocked. He had injured Zhuge Xuanming with a single strike. Could it be that this was a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate?

Ling Han tossed the Divine Demon Sword over to Can Yue. “I’ll lend this to you for a while!”

Can Yue was startled. He knew that this was a real Heavenly Venerate Tool. With the help of this item, it would be child’s play for him to kill peak-stage Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. Even if it came to resistance against a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, he would gain a considerable amount of confidence.

Ling Han had previously acted completely like he had been here to muck around, yet now he had lent him his precious tool. This clearly was one of their own.

Shua! Can Yue raised the sword and delivered a sweep. A cold light shot into the skies, bearing boundless might.

With how powerful a Heavenly Venerate Tool was, even a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate would have to evade, what more when these Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates were at the weakest level.

“Surround them and halt the attack.” Desolate Moon’s voice rang out. He was personally overseeing things here, commanding the battle, determined to seize Ling Han and kill him.

Without instruction, these Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates were just a pile of loose sand. Even if they had an advantage in numbers, they would still be fighting on their own, and they could not make full use of their advantage in numbers. However, it was different if there was someone commanding them. Their power would soar immediately.

The pressure on Can Yue and the others instantly increased many times over, so heavy that they were close to losing all hope.

But they were all supreme prodigies. Faced with this kind of pressure, they would only become even calmer and more collected. Perhaps, this was the trigger that could allow them to attain a breakthrough, and they might suddenly sense that unique power of the Flaming Frost Realm.

Of course, even if they broke through to the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, it would not be of much use.

That was because one would not have any qualitative change in battle prowess when one first broke through to the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier. No matter what, one would have to boost their Body Art to the same height as Regulations. Then, with the combined force of Body Art and Regulations, their battle prowess would more than double.

For example, these Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates in front of them belonged to the weakest level, but they were still stronger than any Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

The power of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate could only be evident with the passing of time.

Ling Han did not care about anything else. He grabbed the Spatial God Tool that Zhuge Xuanming possessed, and he soon found a red stone with a sweep of his divine sense.

Crimson Inferno Divine Flame Stone!

‘Haha.’ Ling Han took out the stone, and then stuffed the Spatial Celestial Tool back into Zhuge Xuanming’s robes. Meanwhile, he walked to the side. He was going to cultivate the Indestructible Divine Metal Physique right here, right now.

“Come!” he exclaimed lightly. With a wave of his hands, a large pile of natural treasures appeared on the ground.

With the guidance of his hands, treasures flew towards him one after another. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The objects here were very mixed. There were Celestial medicines that were epochs old as well as dead waters from the Underworld and a shell that had been shed by a Ninth Heaven Divine Tortoise, and Ling Han grabbed them one after another. He absorbed them into his body, and began refining them.

The commotion caused by this was rather loud, causing Can Yue and the others to turn around repeatedly to see what was happening.

Strange expressions appeared on all their faces. ‘Are you making last-minute preparations here?’

Meanwhile, Zhuge Xuanming inwardly said, ‘If Ling Han really can do something worthwhile, then on the basis that Ling Han is trying to save all of us, I will bear with this. Otherwise, I will definitely make Ling Han know that I am definitely not one to stand for humiliation.’

Time was slowly passing by, and the pressure on A’mu and the others was also increasing gradually.

With Desolate Moon’s instructions, even if there were only 10 Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates that could attack at the same time, he could fully unleash every single person’s battle prowess to the fullest. Furthermore, with the endless barrage of spiritual attacks, they were close to the verge of collapse.

The fact that they could still continue was merely because they were all supreme prodigies, so their willpower was many times stronger than the ordinary person’s.

Still, there would ultimately be a limit to their willpower, and they were close to reaching this limit.
