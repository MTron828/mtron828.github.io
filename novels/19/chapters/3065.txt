3066 Manifesting Spiritual Qi

Pa!

Xu Fei was immediately slapped across the face. This was a crisp and loud slap that immediately caused the color to drain from his face.

This was naturally a painful slap. More important than this, however, was the fact that he didn’t even know who had slapped him!

Just thinking about this caused a cold chill to run down his spine.

“Wh-which lord has come? Please forgive me for not welcoming you,” Xu Fei said. He didn’t dare to shout in anger, and he instead lowered his voice in a subservient manner.

Prince Ma Xuan’s heart jolted in shock as well.

‘Perhaps it’s him?’ he thought to himself.

“This slap was to punish your toxic tongue. Do you have any complaints?” Ling Han asked.

Ling Han initially didn’t want to interfere. However, who told Xu Fei to accuse Wang Quanhe of being Prince Ma Xuan’s illegitimate son? To carelessly change someone’s ancestry like this… Was this not asking for a slap?

Xu Fei felt like crying at this moment. He had merely said this in jest, yet he had somehow managed to draw great calamity upon himself?

He wailed in grief in his mind, yet he didn’t dare to let his emotions show on his face. Instead, his expression became solemn as he said, “Yes, you were correct to punish me. I’ll definitely keep this lesson in mind.”

“Alright, off you go then,” Ling Han said.

However, Xu Fei wasn’t willing to give up so easily. “Lord, may I have the honor of seeing your appearance?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Pa!

He was immediately slapped across the face again.

Prince Ma Xuan chuckled coldly when he saw this.

Even though he couldn’t see Ling Han, either, he had already guessed the identity of this mysterious person.

‘Just how freakishly powerful is Ling Han? Him speaking to you is already giving you enough face, yet you still want him to show himself?’ he said in his mind. ‘What a joke… He’s a Heavenly Venerate!’

Xu Fei finally gave up all thought of resistance after suffering this blow.

He had already been prepared this time, yet he had still been mysteriously slapped by that person. It was abundantly clear that the person was more powerful than him, far more powerful than him.

He couldn’t provoke this person.

He bowed to the sky before turning around to leave. He would leave this troubled place forever and never return again.

Wang Quanhe also retracted his gaze. He knew that the mysterious person was definitely Ling Han. After all, only Ling Han was capable of wielding such magnificent power.

He continued to slaughter the members of the Li Clan, interrogating them before hacking them into pieces. When he came across those who hadn’t participated in the battle at that time, he would simply cripple their cultivation before tossing them aside. He would spare their life.

Yet, in this world, was this not the same as being killed?

“Ungrateful brat, your cruelty today will destine you to death by someone else’s hand one day!” the clan leader of the Li Clan roared. At this moment, only he and Li Jingchu were still alive.

“You… need to die 100 times,” Wang Quanhe said coldly. He started to carefully dice the clan leader into small pieces.

Even Prince Ma Xuan couldn’t help but find this cruel. Killing someone was as simple as separating their head from their body. Wang Quanhe was taking things too far.

However, Ling Han was nearby, so how would he dare to interfere?

Li Jingchu wet herself in fright, with her pretty face becoming deathly pale.

The clan leader suffered a truly agonizing fate, with his body diced into 100 pieces, not one piece more, and not one piece less. However, his cultivation meant that he wouldn’t die straight away, and he could only suffer in unbearable pain as his blood flowed across the ground. This was a truly horrifying sight.

Prince Ma Xuan had already turned his head around to avoid looking at this. If Ling Han weren’t present, he would leave even if didn’t stop Wang Quanhe.

Now, however, he could only tolerate his disgust as he stood there.

In reality, even Ling Han was frowning slightly as he observed the situation. Perhaps he had genuinely raised a demon?

After the clan leader of the Li Clan drew his final breath, Wang Quanhe turned around to look at Li Jingchu.

“Don’t kill me! Don’t kill me!” Li Jingchu shrieked as she prostrated on the ground and furiously kowtowed. Her hair disheveled and she looked much like a lunatic as she begged, “Quanhe, I’m willing to do anything for you! I don’t ask to be your wife, and I can even be your maid or woman—”

Pu!

She immediately fell silent. This was because a sword had directly pierced through her mind.

Wang Quanhe sheathed his blade, a complicated expression on his face.

He had already exacted revenge, so why wasn’t he feeling any joy at all?

“Let’s go,” Ling Han said as he walked over. He grabbed Wang Quanhe and directly opened a fissure in the void, stepping in and traveling through the dimensions.

“Respectful farewell, milord!” Prince Ma Xuan said respectfully the moment before the spatial fissure closed.

Only Heavenly Venerates were capable of opening fissures in the void. Those below the Heavenly Venerable Tier could only open fissures in space, but not fissures in the barriers around the dimensions.

Several months later, Ling Han returned to the Profound Negative Realm with Wang Quanhe. Here, he truthfully explained the origins of the Wang Clan to him.

“Greetings, Old Ancestor,” Wang Quanhe said as he fell to his knees. He respectfully bowed and paid his respects to Ling Han.

Ling Han sighed, and asked, “Do you blame me?”

“I wouldn’t dare,” Wang Quanhe replied, with his head still lowered.

He said that he didn’t dare, not that he didn’t.

Ling Han waved his hand, and said, “From today onward, you can change your name to Ling Quanhe.”

“Ancestor, without the blessing of my parents, Quanhe wouldn’t dare to change his surname.”

Wang Quanhe was unexpectedly stubborn.

The knot in his heart was extremely tight.

Ling Han thought for a moment before saying, “Alright, suit yourself then.”

He couldn’t continue to spend time and effort on this descendant forever. After returning to the ancestral grounds of the Ling Clan, he would ask Ling Jianxue to deal with this matter. Meanwhile, he would enter seclusion.

He had obtained another secret code of life, and he still had yet to fully digest it.

This time, he spent a lengthy 300,000,000 years in seclusion.

Tiny wisps of Spiritual Qi appeared on each of Ling Han’s dimensions.

Spiritual Qi!

This was the foundation of cultivation and the root of cultivators’ power!

There were some powerful beings who would be at the Celestial King Tier the moment that they were born. Thus, they could skip the process of refining Spiritual Qi and directly start accumulating Source Power. To most beings, however, Spiritual Qi was the foundation of their cultivation.

A look of delight appeared on Ling Han’s face. The manifestation of Spiritual Qi in his dimensions meant that they would instantly start to advance several times quicker than before.

He performed some calculations, and he found that he only needed around 10 billion years to elevate all of his dimensions into high-tier high-level dimensions.

This was simply astounding. At that time, he would perhaps be powerful enough to rival or even suppress Hysteria!

Moreover, he would only be at the Sixth Tier.

Being able to suppress Hysteria—the most powerful enemy and the most powerful being in the world—while only at the Sixth Tier… Who could believe this?

‘The secret code of life can be viewed as the key to opening the door to the eighth type of power. This secret code also has a strong affinity with the Power of Dimension, so after obtaining it, I’ve technically already advanced to the Seventh Tier. It’s just that I haven’t actually obtained the sixth fundamental particle yet.

’10 billion years… Give me another 10 billion years, and Hysteria will no longer be able to act with such wantonness.’

Even if Ling Han still couldn’t kill Hysteria at that time, he would at least be able to suppress it comprehensively. He could then slowly cultivate to the Seventh Tier. When he succeeded, could anyone still remain undying and indestructible before him?

‘But… where did this Spiritual Qi come from?’

Ling Han was extremely curious. All forms of power had to come from somewhere, and they naturally couldn’t appear out of thin air. This was just like how First Tier Heavenly Venerates wouldn’t be able to extract the unique power of other dimensions. After losing their source of power, they would slowly grow weaker and weaker.

Even though Second Tier Heavenly Venerates would only be suppressed to the First Tier, this was still relying on the fact that they could extract some fundamental power. At the end of the day, they still needed a source of power.

Ling Han continued to cultivate in seclusion, and he became increasingly interested in the origins of Spiritual Qi.

As he deduced the Heavenly Venerable Seals, he continued to ponder the origin of Spiritual Qi. Doing two things at once indeed affected his efficiency. However, it wasn’t by very much.

Another 400,000,000 years passed, and Ling Han finally made a discovery.
