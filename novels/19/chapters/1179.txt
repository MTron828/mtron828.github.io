Chapter 1180: Unexpected Encounter

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Meng Wei and the others faltered for a moment before roaring loudly and charging toward the man.

‘F*ck! He actually dared to threaten us!’

They charged out of the secret room. There was a lot of space in the manor, and as such, the Viper Poison Explosive Pill could only affect one person at most. It wouldn’t be like just then, where everyone was apprehensive of its effects.

Cold sweat dripped down Ji Zhengping’s forehead. The arrow from that mysterious person had completely penetrated his shoulder. In fact, it had almost taken his life. It was far too terrifying.

If it hadn’t been for his incredible reaction speed, that arrow would have definitely obliterated his heart.

Fear lingered in his mind. If he had been a tiny bit slower just then, he would’ve already been a corpse on the ground.

“Hahaha! Junior Brother Ji, it looks like you’re in quite the bind, no?”

Xiu, xiu, xiu!

Another four people leaped over, each of them radiating with a powerful aura. If Ling Han were to come out from the secret room at this moment, he would realize that there was an old friend of his among these four people.

Sha Yuan!

Ji Zhengping gritted his teeth in pain as he pulled the light arrow from his shoulder. Blood instantly sprayed into the air, and he couldn’t stop it no matter what. This was inevitable as Ling Han’s martial intent was naturally imbued into the arrow. If it wasn’t eliminated, his blood would continue to flow.

Moreover, he would end up with a scar if it wasn’t eliminated completely, a scar that would remain forever.

He humphed, and said, “There’s an astonishingly powerful person in that room!”

“Oh, even Junior Brother Ji reckons that person is powerful,” a blue-robed youth said with a smile. “I’ve got to see just how impressive they are! I’ll hand the people outside to you, then. That should be fine, right?”

“Of course!” Sha Yuan said with a cold smile. His eyes turned to Meng Wei, and he didn’t attempt to hide his lust.

He had always been a playboy, and he had been able to do as pleased in Point Star City. However, his life had become extremely dull after he entered this mystery realm. In fact, he was already nearing his wits’ end. Thus, flames of lust naturally burned in his heart now that a seductive and bold beauty had appeared before him.

“What are you looking at?” Meng Wei humphed, and said, “I don’t like soft pretty boys like you. So, don’t even think about bedding me. Otherwise, I’ll kick your nuts into oblivion!”

Her words were incredibly bold.

Sha Yuan chuckled, and said, “Once you fall into my hands, it won’t be a matter of whether you like it or not!”

Once he spoke, Ling Han—who was still in the secret room—could naturally hear him loud and clear. He couldn’t help but smile coldly. He hadn’t gone looking for Sha Yuan, yet Sha Yuan had delivered himself to him.

‘This is excellent. It’s time for me to kill him.’

He swiped his hand across his face, and his appearance instantly underwent a dramatic change. However, he hadn’t disguised himself into another person. Rather, he had reverted back to his true appearance.

Disciples of the Majestic Heaven Sect obviously couldn’t kill each other. Even if they were fighting over treasures in a mystery realm, they would stop fighting once someone achieved victory.

...Of course, some would still kill their fellow disciples if there were no witnesses. After all, who would know that they were the culprit?

However, it was “Han Lin” that was the disciple of the Majestic Heaven Sect, not Ling Han.

It was because of this that Ling Han reverted back to his true appearance. In any case, he wanted to dispose of Sha Yuan with his true identity as well. Exacting revenge in this manner would feel far more satisfying.

“You guys stay here,” Ling Han said to Shui Yanyu and Hu Feiyun. He didn’t want to risk exposing the fact that he was “Han Lin”.

“Mm-hm!” Shui Yanyu nodded in understanding. Meanwhile, Hu Feiyun appeared a little confused as she nodded. She didn’t understand why Ling Han was suddenly reverting back to his true appearance.

Ling Han strode out of the secret room.

Sha Yuan was just about to launch into action, yet he suddenly faltered when he saw the person that had walked out of the secret room.

‘Ling Han!

‘How is this possible? Why is he also here?’

Ever since entering the large tomb in the galaxy, Ling Han hadn’t appeared again. The recruitment examination for the Majestic Heaven Sect had occurred one year after he had entered the large tomb, and Ling Han naturally hadn’t attended. Thus, many people speculated that Ling Han had died in the large tomb.

That being the case, it came as a huge shock for Sha Yuan to see Ling Han here!

“Ling Han!” Sha Yuan said with a cold humph. He had wished to see Ling Han dead for a long time, yet Ling Han seemed to be extremely fortunate, and he wouldn’t die no matter what. However, he would personally kill him this time, so how could Ling Han escape?

This person had huge secrets and valuable treasures. Sha Yuan would definitely make these his own.

Would he lose to Ling Han?

No way! Ling Han had only been at the high extreme of the Mountain River Tier when he entered the large tomb. Only a mere three years had passed since then, so there was no way his cultivation level could have reached any great heights.

“Brilliant! I can’t believe we’ve come across each other here!” Sha Yuan chuckled coldly, and said, “You’ve already escaped far too many times. However, I’m going to personally kill you this time, and I definitely won’t let you escape again!”

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh loudly, and said, “Sha Yuan, you’re living in your own fantasy world!”

Right now, the gulf between him and Sha Yuan was like the distance between heaven and earth.

“It’s only been a mere three years... Don’t tell me that you’ve suddenly become stronger?” Sha Yuan didn’t believe for a second that Ling Han could become stronger than him. To immortals, three years was a very short amount of time. In fact, it was too little time to advance even one sub-minor level.

“Junior Brother Sha, you know this person?” It was clear that all five of them were from the Majestic Heaven Sect. Moreover, they were all key disciples. Although they weren’t as talented as seeds, their cultivation levels weren’t necessarily lower.

All five of them were at the consummate level of the Mountain River Tier. In addition, the fact that they were key disciples meant that they were at least three-star geniuses.

Thus, they weren’t afraid even though Ji Zhengping had been severely wounded by a single arrow. They were still brimming with confidence.

“Of course I know him. He’s a bumpkin that arrived after opening the sky!” Sha Yuan said in disdain.

“Oh!” The other four people all nodded in understanding. At the same time, they lost all interest in Ling Han.

If he were the heir of some powerful force, then him opening the sky would be extremely impressive. However, Sha Yuan had already labeled him as a “bumpkin”. This revealed that Ling Han was indigenous to some small world, and didn’t have any background in the Immortal Realm. Thus, they naturally didn’t need to pay any attention to him.

“Since Junior Brother Sha has old enmity with him, we’ll let you dispose of him!” the blue-robed youth said. He continued to stare at the secret room as he said this. It was the elite who had wounded Ji Zhengping that made him feel fearful. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Meanwhile, Meng Wei and the others were all slightly puzzled. Why had Ling Han’s appearance suddenly changed so drastically? If it weren’t for his clothes being the same, and if weren’t for the fact that “Ling Han” sounded extremely similar to Han Lin, they would have had serious suspicions that this “Ling Han” had been hiding in the secret room this entire time.

“I’d love to!” Sha Yuan said as he stared at Ling Han. His eyes were filled with killing intent.

To be completely honest, he hadn’t actually wanted to enter the Majestic Heaven Sect.

He had been an extremely profligate young master in Point Star City, and he had been able to do as he pleased. Even if he got into trouble, there was his father’s influence to protect him. However, what was his life like in the Majestic Heaven Sect?

His background had become completely insignificant—there were far too many disciples who were the descendants or heirs of Heavenly Body Tier elites. As a result, his feeling of superiority had vanished into thin air.

After arriving at the Majestic Heaven Sect, it was as if he had fallen from the clouds into a puddle of mud. There was nothing for him to feel superior about.

However, if he could obtain Ling Han’s secrets, he would definitely advance in leaps and bounds and become a seed-level prodigy.

That would be tremendously impressive.

“Ling Han, your secrets are mine!” he roared.

He lashed out with his right hand as he lunged toward Ling Han. Countless divine patterns surged out, transforming into a giant hand that measured 300 meters in length.
