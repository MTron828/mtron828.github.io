2950 Enemy of the World

Ling Han was insanely quick, and he arrived in the Genesis World of the last era in just seven years.

Thank you readers!

In terms of traveling through the Void, it was very likely that only Hysteria was quicker than him.

Ling Han and his two wives immediately began to search for a spatial passageway that would take them to a deeper dimension. Once Ling Han’s battle prowess reached the Seventh Tier, they would no longer need to go to so much trouble. He could directly charge down, ignoring the chaotic winds and origin flames.

“Those people are so detestable!” Hu Niu said with a pout. She placed her hands on her hips, and continued, “They actually dared to smear Niu’s Ling Han! Niu is going to kill them all!”

She was extremely angry as she said this. In fact, she had never been an extremely kind person to begin with, and she had more so been as ferocious as a tiger when she had been young.

!!

The Empress glanced at her, and said, “You’re too weak, so you’re merely speaking nonsense.”

“Wayaya, you huge vixen! You actually dare to doubt Niu?!” Hu Niu said in anger.

The Empress simply replied with a chuckle. Nothing else needed to be said, and her intent was as clear as could be.

Ling Han gestured for them to calm down. Of course, the two women had only been bickering, and there was nothing more to it than that.

“In fact, that wasn’t too bad. At the very least, I was able to determine who’s on my side and who wants me to die,” Ling Han said.

“Also, we have enough time to look through this place now,” Hu Niu said with a giggle. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Indeed,” the Empress said with a nod. “Otherwise, we’d be forced to battle against Hysteria’s army in the Realm Battlefield. However, since they view us as traitors now, we naturally don’t need to help them anymore.”

“Alright, I’ll cultivate until my battle prowess reaches the Seventh Tier before leaving,” Ling Han said with a hearty laugh.

They arrived at the 13th dimension. They could only call this the 13th dimension and not the 13th layer because they had come here through a spatial passageway. Thus, they were unable to determine which layer this dimension belonged to.

However, this didn’t matter. What mattered was how much they could obtain from this place.

The three of them kept an extremely low profile, and remained extremely cautious. They were enemies of the entire world, after all, so they naturally couldn’t expose their location. Otherwise, they would be hunted by the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate. At that time, Ling Han’s only option would be death, regardless of how freakish he was.

There were countless treasures here, but one needed to overcome many difficulties and also possess a good fortune to obtain them.

Chaotic storms of energy swept through the dimension, filling every corner with danger. Even with battle prowess at the Sixth Tier, Ling Han still needed to be extremely careful.

After all, his body had only been tempered by three fundamental powers, so his physique was still quite a long way off from reaching the Sixth Tier.

This was quite an interesting quirk. In the past, Ling Han’s physique had always been more powerful than his cultivation. Now, however, it was the opposite.

The Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll was already unable to keep up with his cultivation, and Ling Han didn’t have any plan to raise it to the next level, either. This was because the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll was subject to numerous limitations—it was created by a First Tier Heavenly Venerate, so it naturally didn’t possess any information on the six fundamental powers.

Moreover, to put it simply, the strength of a Heavenly Venerate was directly correlated to their mastery of the fundamental powers.

Ling Han had a whole heap of time now, so he started to focus his concentration on cultivation.

Since he didn’t need to worry about the situation on the battlefield, Ling Han could naturally focus all of his attention on cultivation.

He continued to search for veins of ore as he grew his strength.

Following his slight advance in cultivation, the Powers of Dimension inside him also started to grow. He could now hold a maximum of over 200 dimensions. Thus, he needed to spend a lot of time to grow these dimensions to their full potential.

If these dimensions grew a little, Ling Han’s battle prowess would also grow a little.

In the blink of an eye, over 4,000,000 years passed.

Ling Han’s cultivation did indeed grow a little. However, he still had yet to reach the late stage of the Fourth Tier.

There were far too few raw stone veins here. With the terrifying amount of energy that he needed to improve his cultivation, this lack of raw stone veins was completely unable to support him.

Even so, his cultivation speed was indeed a little faster in this place. However, it was only faster to a limited extent.

This was inevitable as the environment became increasingly hostile the deeper he traveled through the group of dimensions. The heaven and earth also became increasingly shattered. Thus, it was only natural that there were few Heavenly Venerable Stones.

However, even though there were fewer raw stones, the quality of each was higher. In fact, there were even fourth-grade Heavenly Venerable Seals.

If Ling Han ventured to the deeper dimensions, perhaps there would be third-grade, second-grade, or even first-grade seals?

“Hmm?”

Ling Han suddenly faltered at this moment. He could sense several auras rapidly moving toward them.

‘Who is it?’

He didn’t tear open the Void to leave straight away. This was because the auras were powerful, but they were nowhere near the level of Seventh Tier elites.

He wasn’t afraid of anyone under the Seventh Tier.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!

11 people quickly appeared before Ling Han.

In fact, it wasn’t entirely accurate to refer to them as “people.” Eight of them were indeed people, but three of them were monsters with numerous arms, legs, and heads.

Three of Hysteria’s creations, plus Huangfu Dongyue and the seven other spies…

“Ling Han, you’ve already been abandoned by everyone in the Genesis World,” Huangfu Dongyue said. “Why don’t you return to the main body? You’re one of us, and you also have a spiritual mark left by the main body. We’re countless times more noble than those fragile life forms!

“If you abandon your incorrect ways and adopt what is right, the main body is willing to forgive your crimes.”

Ling Han roared with laughter, and said, “Alright then, I’ll switch sides right away!”

“Then return with me to the main body. There’s something it wants to say to you,” Huangfu Dongyue said.

Ling Han scoffed, and said, “I’m not under Hysteria’s control, and my battle prowess is also immense, far beyond its imagination. Is Hysteria getting anxious? Something to say to me? It merely wants to kill me and examine my corpse!”

“Ling Han, what’s the point of resisting?” Huangfu Dongyue said. “Have you forgotten about how you were treated by the others in the Genesis World?”

Ling Han nodded, and replied, “I naturally haven’t forgotten who forced me into this situation.”

“Heh, we were merely speaking the truth,” Huangfu Dongyue said with a smile. “Ling Han, there’s nowhere else for you to go. Even Seventh Tier elites are hunting you now, and once they find you, your only option will be death.

“With such a bright future, why do you insist on sticking with the Genesis World?

“Do they care that you were wronged? Will they empathize with you?”

Ling Han roared with laughter, and said, “It’s been a few million years since I last saw you, and your eloquence has truly seen some improvement. Go back and tell Hysteria to clean its neck; I’ll personally chop it off one day!”

“Ling Han, what if Hysteria has several heads? Which neck do you want it to clean?” Hu Niu said with a giggle.

“Indeed,” Ling Han said with a nod.

Hearing this, Huangfu Dongyue didn’t say anything else. It was clear that Ling Han possessed an extremely strong willpower, and wouldn’t be swayed by him.

Then his only option was to battle.

He couldn’t help but sigh. This was the last resort, and it would be extremely difficult to stop Ling Han from traveling through the dimensions.

“Since you’re unwilling to yield to Master, you’ll ultimately be annihilated by Master’s brilliance.”
