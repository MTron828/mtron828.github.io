Chapter 848: Return to the Sea Race

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

After this battle, the hearts of the people in the Great Ling Empire had become more united. The only issue was that Ling Han’s body could only bear the power of ten Stars of Shattering Void Tier. Hence, there wasn’t much increase in his power.

His cultivation had been increasing all this while, but compared to the power of ten Stars of Shattering Void Tier, it was still negligible. Only stepping into the Shattering Void Tier would bring about a qualitative transformation in his power.

Without realizing it, another few months had passed.

Ling Han had already reached the ninth layer of the Heaven Tier, and was beginning to switch to cultivating the Extreme Yang Technique. Although there wasn’t any bottleneck, to begin cultivating a new technique still needed to be done cumulatively. He reckoned that breaking through to the Shattering Void Tier would take about a year’s time.

This was already quite amazing. One had to know that he was only twenty-one years old. In reality, he had only just recently stepped into his adult years. If compared to his relative age, it was only later by one or two years.

But it was important to know that he was actually in the Lower Realm!

Could the Lower Realm compare with the Immortal Realm? Otherwise, how could it be possible that the Immortal Realm would be encroaching into the Lower Realm? Rather, it would be the Lower Realm encroaching into the Immortal Realm.

Given that the period of one year previously agreed upon with the Sea Race was up, Ling Han and Helian Xun Xue packed up with the intention of making a trip to the north sea. Firstly, it was to take a look at their son. Secondly, it was to visit Helian Tianyun to see what kind of new accomplishments he had.

Ling Dong Xing wanted to go together with Helian Xun Xue to see his grandson. That being the case, Ling Han brought both of them. Anyway, the Black Tower was so big that it could accommodate them even if there were more people.

Hu Niu naturally couldn’t be left behind. The little girl was becoming more feminine, and her chest was beginning to show some slight undulation. Sometimes, she would learn to act coquettish like Zhu Xuan Er, which Ling Han found to be quite hilarious.

Rabbit said that he had not been to the sea, and was taken along as well. Rock Spirit had already been back since long ago; this time, it had also set out with them on the trip, responsible for being Hu Niu’s mount. It had been continuously receiving the essence of earth within Black Tower, and had crossed over the last step to reach the Shattering Void Tier in advance of the others.

This was unimaginable in the past. From the Flower Blossom to Shattering Void Tier, how many spirit stones did one need to absorb?

Lord Rock is indeed smart, and followed the right owner! it thought, a simple-minded expression on its face. Despite being a Shattering Void Tier elite, it was as docile as a dog in front of Hu Niu.

Everyone set out, heading towards the sea.

Before entering the north region, Ling Han went to take a look at the ancient mining area. The black mist there was like a vast ocean, which had completely swallowed up the original capital of Fire Country.

This was a hidden danger.

Ling Han thought that the first thing he would do after stepping into the Shattering Void Tier would be to raze this place.

They entered the sea, and rushed to Dome Cloud Island. The journey was very smooth all the way, and it took them just four days to reach the destination. It was also because the strength of both Ling Han and Hu Niu had progressed to another level, and thus their speed was naturally faster.

“Who’s there?!” Guards soaring through the sky stopped Ling Han and the others.

“Seventh Princess! Consort!” When they saw the appearance of Ling Han and the others, they became respectful, and made their salutations. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Helian Xun Xue waved her hand, and said, “No need to stand on ceremony, where is the king?”

“Currently inside the palace.”

Helian Xun Xue naturally didn’t need them to lead the way. As she missed her son dearly, she impatiently flew all the way. The moment she entered the Royal Palace, she only saw that Helian Rong was holding a little boy and playing with him in full eagerness. “Call grandfather! Call grandfather!”

“Big one! Big one!” The little boy grabbed the ear of Helian Rong, and clapped his hands.

“It’s grandfather, not Big One!” Helian Rong was saying frantically. This little kid was already able to talk for a few months now, but only engrossed in calling him ‘big one’—it really made him feel extremely anxious.

Both Ling Han and Helian Xun Xue flew down, which made Helian Rong jumped in fright. Currently, his mind was completely focused on Ling Jian Xue, putting all his hope on the other party to call him ‘grandfather’. Who would have thought that Ling Han and the others would suddenly appear.

“Father! Mother!” Ling Jian Xue suddenly shouted, and scampered over to them.

“Pu!” Helian Rong suddenly spewed out a mouthful of blood. He had already lost count of how many times he had taught the little rascal who would only go calling him “big one” instead of addressing him as “grandfather”. He’d never thought that when Ling Han and Helian Xun Xue arrived, the little rascal would actually address them properly.

Damn it!

Helian Xun Xue was happy yet regretful; she wasn’t able to teach her son call them ‘mother’ and ‘father’. It was her son who had learned it himself. She hugged her son, and said, “Good son, mother will no longer be apart from you!”

She no longer cared about anything. Her only thought was not to be separated from her son.

“Hahaha, damn brat. You are finally here!” Helian Tianyun also flew in. In the past one year, he had indeed stepped into the Heaven Tier; his dragon’s might had gotten somewhat stronger, though the change wasn’t too drastic. After all, he had originally reached his peak state, and improvement would thus naturally be limited.

Although Ling Han also missed his son very much, he was more pleased to see the change in his son. The little boy had yet to reach two years old, but his brute force had already reached the peak of the Spiritual Pedestal Tier. His progress was truly amazing.

“What is the current situation of the four seas?” he asked, naturally taking care of serious matters first.

Helian Tianyun very proudly puffed up his chest, and said, “Now, the four seas are all under the control of This Lord. More than half of the Sea Race of the central sea have also sworn allegiance to this lord. You’ve come at just the right time. I intend to attack the Sea Emperor in a few days’ time. Come and join in the fun.”

Dragon’s might really came in handy. With so many Shattering Void Tier cultivators among the Sea Race, most have already been conquered by a little boy who was presently still in the Heaven Tier.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Okay, it would be good to observe and gain knowledge first-hand.”

Under the True Dragon’s might of Helian Tianyun, most of the Sea Race had chosen to stand under his banner. However, the imperial family was naturally unwilling to lay down their weapons and surrender. They even had the backing of the Immortal Realm, and thus would naturally fight him to the end.

However, although there were many elites among the imperial family, it wouldn’t be more than the numbers of all the four seas. This obstacle was as good as removed.

After three days of preparation, the army was dispatched. There were elites continuously joining the army. The number of Shattering Void Tier cultivators was more than 300. This was because some of the Shattering Void Tier cultivators actually had to stand guard and oversee their clans. Otherwise, bringing together 400 of them wouldn’t be an issue at all.

The ancestral homes of the royal clans of the four seas were all on the island. The only exception was the imperial family. Their ancestral land was in the deep sea, within a strait, surrounded by super-large sea beasts. Although they had not developed intelligence and had zero cultivation knowledge, with their extremely formidable physique and brute force, their battle prowess had reached fifteen Stars.

They were the natural guardians of the imperial family—the most powerful guardians that could tear to pieces any Shattering Void Tier cultivators who firmly charged forward.

However, in front of Helian Tianyun, these sea beasts were completely powerless.

The reason the imperial family could use them as guards was because these sea beasts would be affected by dragon’s might. Such dragon’s might had to be extremely pure; the level of might such as Helian Rong’s wouldn’t have any effect at all.

But, who was Helian Tianyun? He was the alternative dragon from millennia ago, and had even cultivated a True Dragon’s Fang! Now that he had obtained a second lifetime through the True Dragon’s Fang, his dragon’s might was even stronger than in his last life. Therefore, with a single thought of his, these sea beasts would retreat one after another.

In front, there was an extremely huge strait.

“How dare you offend the imperial family. Do you all know your crime?” A cold voice was heard from within the strait.
