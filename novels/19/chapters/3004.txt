3005 Pinnacle Defense

Ling Han looked coldly at Feng Wuding.

Feng Wuding naturally wouldn’t back down. He also looked back at Ling Han.

With the two men looking at each other so “affectionately,” it was very likely that the masses who were not aware of what was really going on between them would think that there was some kind of indescribable love affair between them, but those people only had to observe the killing intent that was exuding from them, and they would know that there was only one kind of relationship between the two of them, and that was deadly rivalry.

“Feng Wuding. I’ve said it before, you’re going to die today!” Ling Han said calmly.

When these words fell, everyone was greatly shocked.

Although killing Sealed Emotion, Yi Long, Huang Feng, and so on were serious crimes, Ling Han had displayed sufficient strength, and thus possessed privileges that were above the law.

He could destroy Hysteria’s army with a single move. This kind of talent was too important, and was definitely not someone that a few Fourth Tiers or Third Tiers could exchange for.

However, Feng Wuding was different.

He was the Son of Destiny, having obtained the inheritance of the Genesis World of the last era, and was the key to destroying Hysteria.

One could only resist Hysteria’s attacks, while the other could destroy Hysteria. Who would you say was more important?

Hence, if Ling Han really killed Feng Wuding, the matter would become serious.

Moreover, Lin Youlian and the others wouldn’t allow Ling Han to do this. They would definitely try everything in their abilities to stop him.

“Humph, do you think you’re even worthy?!” Feng Wuding said haughtily.

Ling Han shook his head. “What bullsh*t Son of Destiny!”

Since long ago, he had not believed that Feng Wuding was some Son of Destiny, because there was nothing special about him.

Yes, 100 dimensions could indeed crush any prodigy. For example, Lin Youlian and the others had only created two dimensions in their bodies. However, when compared with Ling Han, 100 dimensions were practically trash.

Even if Feng Wuding was allowed to reach the Seventh Tier, would he be able to match Hysteria?

Absolutely not!

Thinking about it, it was very simple. Hysteria had similarly never stopped cultivating, and furthermore, it was endlessly devouring dimensions. Its abilities were constantly strengthening, so what basis did Feng Wuding have to think that his rate of cultivation could surpass Hysteria’s?

Others would have an end to their cultivation, and that was why they could be surpassed, but faced with an existence that had no limits and kept improving, how were they supposed to surpass it?

And Feng Wuding called himself the Son of Destiny?

“You dare to slander me?” Feng Wuding said balefully. He had really tolerated Ling Han enough.

“Bullsh*t, I’ll kill you and see what the heavens will do!” Ling Han said calmly. With a flash, he was already charging towards Feng Wuding. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

There was a sequence of killing, and now it was Feng Wuding’s turn.

Feng Wuding naturally had to accept the challenge. He wasn’t an indestructible Seventh Tier, so how could he dare to let Ling Han attack him randomly?

He would battle!

Unfortunately, once Ling Han became serious, how could Feng Wuding possibly be a match for him? Very soon, he was being suppressed, and it would only be a matter of time before he was killed.

“Ling Han!” Xin Qihu and the others, a group of four with battle prowess of Seventh Tier, hurriedly rushed forwards to attack Ling Han together to decrease the suppression on Feng Wuding.

Ling Han humphed as he channeled his Powers of Dimension into an invincible defense. He then ignored the attacks of Xin Qihu and the others, and simply targeted Feng Wuding.

Xin Qihu and the others didn’t know that Ling Han’s defenses were already of the Seventh Tier. Seeing that he actually let go and allowed them to attack as they liked, they couldn’t help but cease their attacks and send them elsewhere.

What surprised Ling Han was the fact that Lin Youlian, Bai Mifan, and Wu Haoyang acted in the nick of time, which he could understand. However, Xin Qihu actually forced himself to stop in time, which he found to be odd.

It was too strange.

However, even if the four of them had ceased attacking, there were still some micro-attacks that swept over towards Ling Han. After all, Seventh-Tier attacks were too fast, so how could they possibly be withdrawn all at once?

However, when these attacks landed on Ling Han, they didn’t even hurt a single hair on Ling Han’s head, and yet they still had some effect. After all, it was the power of Seventh Tiers, which managed to slow down the speed at which Ling Han pounced, and allowed Feng Wuding the chance to retreat.

“What?!”

Lin Youlian and the others were all shocked. Even if the attacks that landed on Ling Han were only a part of their full-blown attacks, a Seventh Tier was still a Seventh Tier, so how could their attacks possibly be taken head-on?

However, Ling Han was completely unscathed. What the heck was this?

“Seventh-Tier defense!” Xin Qihu spat out word for word.

Although Lin Youlian and the others didn’t want to believe it, facts spoke louder than words.

Heavens, for a Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerate to possess Seventh-Tier battle prowess was already inconceivable, but to actually have a physique of Seventh Tier, was this person still a Fifth Tier?

Hiss, this time Ling Han had really gained the confidence to ignore the rules.

Even if he was out of control, so what? He was immortal and indestructible, so who could discipline him?

It wasn’t just them. The spectators around them had also gotten numb with shock. How could Ling Han possibly be as strong as this?

Even though Feng Wuding thought he was extraordinary, he still felt a strong chill rise up from the bottom of his heart.

The opponent whom he was facing was a “true” Seventh Tier.

Both his opponent’s power and defense had reached the pinnacle of the world, and he could neither be killed nor wounded, while Feng Wuding’s only fate was to be pummeled by his opponent.

This kind of battle was absolutely unfair.

Ling Han merely stared at Feng Wuding, and asked calmly, “Who else wants to stop me?”

“Brother Ling, please reconsider. Feng Wuding is the Son of Destiny of the Genesis World of the last era. It is very possible that he is key to eliminating Hysteria,” Lin Youlian said seriously. She naturally still wanted to persuade him.

This time, what she was worried about was not Ling Han’s safety, but the overall situation.

Ling Han laughed. “This so-called Son of Destiny is only a claim from Chong Yan and the others, and I… am filled with doubt about their words!”

A dignified ultimate elite of the Seventh Tier would actually lie, and through his own observations and the theory of the World’s Will, Ling Han had confirmed that Feng Wuding was definitely not some Son of Destiny.

It was extremely likely that Chong Yan and the others were hiding their own secrets.

The Seventh Tiers were absolutely tight-lipped about the secret, which might be a shockingly huge conspiracy.

“Big Brother, it’s better to stop,” Bai Mifan also advised.

Ling Han shook his head, and pointed at Feng Wuding. “I already said, I will definitely kill him today!”

Feng Wuding was furious. Was Ling Han really treating him like a meat bun[1]? He humphed. “Ling Han, do you think it would be so easy for you to kill me?”

“You’ll naturally find out when you die,” Ling Han said calmly. At this moment, Feng Wuding was no longer worthy of being his opponent—from the very beginning, he hadn’t taken Feng Wuding to heart.

Ling Han charged out, throwing punches with both fists, and furiously attacking Feng Wuding.

Feng Wuding, Lin Youlian, and the others moved in quick succession. The five with Seventh-Tier battle prowess joined hands together once again to stop Ling Han from committing a crime.

But could they really stop him?

Now that the battle had begun, Xin Qihu and the others naturally had no qualms. They went all out, but after a few moves, they finally knew why a real Seventh Tier was so impressive and awesome.

He was immortal and indestructible!

When their attacks landed on Ling Han’s body, they only caused a spattering of multiple streaks of light, and were completely unable to wound Ling Han in the slightest. However, they had to disperse Ling Han’s attacks, or they would be severely injured even if the attacks were to scrape past them.

This kind of battle was too unfair. Ling Han only needed to attack, and could use his full abilities, while Feng Wuding and the others could only ward off his attacks, suffering indescribably.
