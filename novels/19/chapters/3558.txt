Chapter 3559: Exclusion method

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Here was the problem. There was a stone statue that could evade divine sense, and it could also deceive the brain. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t realize that there was one less stone statue.

Ling Han believed that aside from him, there was at least no other person below Celestial Path that could realize this fact.

-He had relied on the endless power of beings in the dimensions in his body to temporarily form an inner world, and only then did he realize that something was off, and this kind of possibility did not exist for others. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

However, there was another problem. Which stone statue was it?

If Ling Han opened his eyes and looked, there was nothing special about any of the stone statues. If he channeled his divine sense to search for it, it still didn’t match. There was a mysterious force that was impeding him.

He looked towards Hong Tianbu, only to see that the latter’s expression was filled with confusion. He was frowning, and it was clear that he hadn’t discovered anything off about this at all.

In Hong Tianbu’s opinion, since the stone statues were completely the same, then it was only a matter of luck. This naturally made him feel slightly conflicted.

Only after a while, Hong Tianbu made his choice.

That was because he believed that his luck would definitely bring him great fortune.

“I choose this one.” Hong Tianbu pointed at a stone statue.

The small rock golem nodded, and with a toss of its hand, threw a rock at Hong

Tianbu, “This is your reward. You can leave now.”

“Ultimate Black Stone!” When Hong Tianbu saw this, he couldn’t help but exclaim in shock, his eyes burning with desire.

This was the highest grade of Foundation Building Divine Stones, and was not the slightest bit inferior to the Ten Thousand Star Stone. However, the Ten Thousand Star Stone was more inclined towards attack, while the Ultimate Black Stone could increase the degree of compatibility with the Dao of Heaven and Earth, speeding up the rate of cultivation and increasing appreciation.

In Hong Tianbu’s eyes, he already had the eye of a Primordial Beast, and his battle prowess was already incredibly powerful. It was definitely the Ultimate Black Stone that would be more useful for him.

He laughed loudly. His luck was indeed heaven-defying. He had won a prize of

the highest grade Divine Stone, so how could that not prove this?

Hong Tianbu swept a glance at Ling Han in a show of superiority, then went back the way he had come.

Idiot.

Ling Han shook his head. He was 100% sure that Hong Tianbu hadn’t chosen that special stone statue. What was he acting all smug for?

However, any random stone statue would be bestowed with the highest grade Foundation Building Divine Stone, so if he chose the special stone statue, just how astonishing would the rewards be?

Ling Han’s heart involuntarily thumped. Even with millions of veined patterns,

he still felt as if his heart was about to jump out of his chest.

“Brat, let me warn you first. You have one day to slowly make your choice, but after one day, if you still don’t make your choice, you can only be thrown out,” the small stone figure said.

Ling Han nodded. This guy had not said anything to Hong Tianbu, yet revealed this to him. This was the benefit of being on good terms previously.

He calmed his emotions, and made himself completely calm. He once again stimulated the power of the beings in the dimensions in his body, to locate that special stone statue.

Where? Where? Where?

It was as if this stone statue was capable of flight. Ling Han had clearly seen eleven normal stone statues, and he only had to find the last one and point it out.

However, the last stone statue kept moving, and he was unable to locate it. His eyes suddenly snapped open, yet he saw that the twelve stone statues were all standing upright, and there was not the slightest bit of strangeness about them.

This was really a very strange feeling.

Ling Han drew out a pen, walked forwards, and drew on one of the stone statues.

“Brat, you choose this one?” the small stone golem asked, actually revealing a disappointed expression.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “No, I’ll mark out the stone statues that I won’t choose.”

Since he couldn’t point out that special stone statue, he would use the method of elimination.

In his inner world, because they had been contributing Spiritual Power all this while, all the living creatures were gradually feeling exhausted.

Ling Han hurriedly increased his speed. He now realized that the beings of the dimensions inside his body were incredibly important to him. He definitely couldn’t kill the goose that laid the golden egg.

One stroke, two strokes, three strokes… his speed was extremely fast, and he had already drawn eleven strokes.

Ling Han smiled, “I choose the last one.”

“Oh?” The small stone golem smiled, and asked, “Which one is it now?

Ling Han took a look, and couldn’t help but feel surprised. That was because the strokes that he had previously drawn had disappeared, which also meant that he had worked for nothing.

F***, yOu can’t play around with people like that.

“Since that’s the case, I can’t choose.” Ling Han shookhis head. He already had a Ten Thousand Star Stone. In truth, he didn’t have much extravagant hopes for Foundation Building Divine Stones anymore, so he was very confident, and had a very calm mentality.

He turned around, and went back the way he had come.

“Wait!” When he had already walked down the stairs, the small stone golem suddenly spoke up, “Come, come, come, brat, let’s have another chat.” Ling Han turned around as he was told, “Oh, what are we talking about?” “Brat, have you really discovered something strange?” the small stone golem asked.

Ling Han nodded, “If I use my divine sense to sense, I only discovered eleven stone statues. Thus, the last one must have some unique trait.”

The small stone golem was silent for a moment, “I never thought that you would really see through me!”

“Then I pass?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

The small rock golem nodded, “You are one of the very few people who can pass after this place of trials opened.”

Ling Han was startled. There were actually others that had also seen through the mystery?

That couldn’t be, right? There was actually not just one special existence like him?

“Brat, don’t look like that.” The small rock golem shook its head, “I am the one who should be shocked, all right? Your bone structure is ordinary, and your natural talent is average, yet you actually compacted your foundations to such a sturdy extent. This is already extremely inconceivable.”

“And now, you can actually sense Lord Pan Shi’s statue, which is even more dumbfounding.”

Ling Han gaped. He was actually being looked down on.

Was it usually his fault for having an ordinary bone structure and natural talent?

“How strange. With your natural talent, how can you cultivate to such a high level?” The small stone golem was still puzzled. In its eyes, this matter was really too inconceivable, making it curious.

“Hehe.” Ling Han merely smiled. ‘I’m really sorry. You can’t figure it out no matter how hard you wrack your brains.’

The small stone figure was puzzled for a while, then finally came back to its senses, and said, “Brat, you are only living on this small planet, so your outlook is naturally limited. Unlike me, who is steering the Ethereal Peak through the universe continuously, and has seen too many prodigies.

“Some prodigies are truly stunning and freakish beyond imagination.” “Among them, there were also a few emperor tiers, who dazzled an era and ruled for countless years.”

F***, that was an exaggeration, wasn’t it? He was just boasting.

Ling Han did not say anything, and merely used his eyes to express his thoughts.

“Brat, don’t you doubt me!” The small stone golem humphed, “Do you know who Lord Pan Shi is?”

“I don’t know.” Ling Han shookhis head honestly.

“Of course you don’t know,” the small stone golem said proudly.

This guy was really asking for a beating. Since you know that I don’t, then what’s the point of asking?

“Lord Pan Shi is an Ancestral King!”
