1272 Arrival of Pursuing Troops

Killing intent flashed across Ling Han’s eyes.

This woman was truly selfish. After being rejected, she had chosen to push everyone else into extreme danger. He had never seen such a disgusting woman before! Moreover, did she genuinely like him? No, she was simply attracted by his identity of a Level Eight alchemist—although she only believed that he was a Level Four or Level Five alchemist.

It was rare for Ling Han to feel killing intent toward a stranger. However, this woman had succeeded in triggering his killing intent. With regard to this, she was quite special.

A cold smile appeared on Xie Donglai’s face. He nodded at Zhu Liyun, and said, “He’s indeed here!”

Zhu Liyun hurriedly put on an obsequious smile, and said, “After seeing this person visit that b*tch, I returned to Wolf Fang City to gather more information. Only then did I discover that he had headed in this direction. Thankfully, I completed the task that Young Master Xie gave me.”

In fact, they had already scoured the Two Realm Battlefield for a long time. However, Ling Han had been cultivating in seclusion in the Black Tower, so how could they have found him? If it weren’t for Xie Donglai’s pettiness and overwhelming desire to exact revenge on Ling Han, they would have given up a long time ago.

Trying to find someone in this place—even with a general direction—was like trying to find a needle in a haystack.

Xie Donglai stared at Ling Han coldly, and said, “Ling Han, so it turns out that you’re that b*tch’s lover! No wonder I thought your name sounded a bit familiar!”

Killing intent flashed through his eyes. He finally understood why Ling Han had opposed him the entire time. As it turned out, it was because of his relationship with the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden.

However, he was like a mantis trying to stop a chariot. So what if he was a Level Eight alchemist? If he killed everyone here, who would suspect him of being the killer?

In fact, what did it matter if they suspected him? They would need evidence to convict him. Without evidence, who would dare to use force against a descendant of an Eternal River Tier elite?

Ling Han turned to Faceless, and said, “Brother Faceless, can you hold those three men back for me? I want to kill that woman.”

Faceless didn’t ask any questions, instead saying, “Are you sure you can defeat that woman? Although her strength is only so-so, her cultivation level is far higher than yours.” He could clearly determine that Ling Han’s battle prowess hadn’t reached the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier yet.

Ling Han flashed a confident smile, and replied, “I’m positive!”

Faceless nodded, and said, “Fine, I’ll deal with those three men, then.” He appeared especially at ease.

This was extremely normal. He was at the pinnacle level of the Sun Moon Tier, and it was possible that he had already reached the peak stage. Meanwhile, Xie Donglai and his two elder servants were only at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier. For them, fighting against a pinnacle level elite would be like fighting against a Heavenly Body Tier elite. Their advantage in numbers would be completely useless.

At least, the three of them would stand no chance against Faceless. Perhaps they would need 10, 100, or even 1000 cultivators to team up against him. The exact number would depend on Faceless’ accomplishment at the pinnacle level. Whether he was at the early stage, middle stage, late stage, or peak stage would make a huge difference.

Ling Han had full confidence in Faceless’ ability. Thus, he was extremely relaxed as he strode toward Zhu Liyun. He was going to kill this toxic woman first. Otherwise, he would be leaving a poisonous snake by the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s side.

“You two are far too arrogant!” Xie Donglai shouted. He had naturally heard Ling Han’s conversation with Faceless, and it had caused him to almost explode in anger. The two of them were measly cultivators at the medium extreme, yet one of them dared to claim that he would fight against three of them, while the other claimed that he would kill Zhu Liyun.

Where was their confidence coming from? Where was their courage coming from? Would they die if they didn’t make such bold claims?

He had nothing but scorn for Ling Han and Faceless upon detecting that the aura from their bodies was only at the medium extreme of the Sun Moon Tier.

Gasp!

However, this thought had barely left Xie Donglai’s mind when he immediately sucked in a cold breath. ‘How long has passed? Yet Ling Han has already advanced another level? Had he already been stuck at the peak stage of the low extreme for a long time? And he coincidentally broke through at this time?’

If this were the case, he could still accept it. Otherwise, wouldn’t this brat be a supreme freak?

One had to remember the Purple Moon Divine Maiden’s claim that Ling Han’s true age was definitely under 50. This was the claim of an Eternal River Tier elite. Who dared to question it?

‘He’s reached the medium extreme of the Sun Moon Tier before 50!’

Killing intent surged from Xie Donglai’s body. He definitely couldn’t spare this love rival. He was far too f*cking freakish!

“Kill him!” he shouted softly. He naturally didn’t need to deal with Ling Han himself. His two elderly servants would dispose of Ling Han for him.

“Understood, Young Master!” The two elderly servants immediately charged at Ling Han.

“Heh, I’ll play with you two.” Faceless dashed over to meet them.

“Why are you hiding your appearance? Can you not show your face to others?” Xie Donglai mocked. Surprisingly, his insults had improved significantly after his several verbal skirmishes with Ling Han. He was far more toxic than before.

Faceless’ expression couldn’t be seen. However, he replied with a stroke of his qin. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Weng!

A sword instantly materialized in the air and slashed at Xie Donglai.

By the looks of it, he had been angered slightly.

“You dare?!” The two elderly servants exchanged a glance; then, one of them charged toward Faceless, and the other charged toward Ling Han.

Weng!

Faceless stroked his qin again, and a spear materialized in the air and shot at the elderly servant who was charging toward Ling Han.

Peng!

The elderly servant simply threw a punch backward and shattered the spear to pieces. Meanwhile, the other elderly servant had already appeared before Faceless.

Peng!

He launched a strike and sent Faceless flying backward.

Faceless twisted in the air before landing on the ground. He coughed upon landing, and a splotch of blood instantly appeared on his face veil. He suddenly came to a realization, and exclaimed, “Oh! I forgot to undo the suppression on my cultivation!”

Ling Han’s expression involuntarily darkened. He hadn’t expected Faceless to have such a “foolish” side to him.

If he were killed because of such a mistake, wouldn’t that be incredibly sad?

Peng!

He hurriedly threw a punch as these thoughts flashed through his mind. His fist collided with the elderly servant’s, and he instantly slid backward. His power was far below that of the elderly servant. However, because of his powerful physique, he was able to absorb the power of the elderly servant’s strike after dragging a 300-meter long ditch along the ground.

Ling Han shook his hands. His Godly bones were numb due to the formidable power of the collision, and the skin on his hands had also cracked open, allowing blood to seep out. “Brother Faceless, don’t screw us over.”

“It was an accident, an accident,” Faceless hurriedly said.

“Childish games!” Xie Donglai chuckled coldly, and shouted, “Hurry up and kill them!”

Ling Han’s rapid advance in cultivation terrified him. At his current speed, it was possible that he would reach the peak stage of the Sun Moon Tier within 100 years. In fact, he could break through to the Heavenly Body Tier within 1,000 years!

This was inhumane.

The two elderly servants continued to attack Ling Han and Faceless.

“I said I would play with both of you!” Faceless said with a smile. He charged forward, and his aura instantly increased explosively.

Peng!

He appeared before Ling Han in a flash, and he immediately pressed his palm toward one of the elderly servants. A devastating power swept over and instantly sent the elderly servant flying. His trajectory just so happened to intersect with the pursuing elderly servant, and they violently collided with each other.

The two of them instantly tumbled along the ground.

Peng, peng, peng, peng!

They only came to a stop after tumbling an extremely long distance.

This strike was earth-shattering, and it left Xie Donglai and the others stunned.

‘W-what in the world is going on?’

An elite at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier had been sent flying by a single strike. Not only that, but he had even collided into another elite at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier and sent him tumbling along the ground.

‘F*ck!’
