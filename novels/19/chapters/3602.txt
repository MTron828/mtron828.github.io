Chapter 3603: Pang Shu

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The Flame King sent the golden sword flying with a single palm strike, but the flames on his hand also dimmed for a moment. Obviously, dispersing this attack wasn’t as easy as it looked.

“Handsome Brother, charge!” The little loli cheered Ling Han on. He actually dared to sneak attack her, how detestable!

Ling Han naturally wouldn’t allow others to attack him as they liked. Moreover, if he attacked from afar, he wouldn’t be able to unleash the might of the destructive energy either. He charged forward, planning to engage in close-quarter combat with the Flame King.

The Flame King was completely unafraid, and it also sent out a palm strike.

Peng!

The flames clashed with the darkness. Both were high-level energies, but while they were both high-level energies, there was still a difference in their density, as well as a difference in quality.

As the black energy surged, the flames instantly faded greatly.

The Flame King was astonished. Its extremely simple brain was only filled with battle instincts, and it knew that this was disadvantageous to it.

It hurriedly retreated, but half of its arm had already completely dimmed, and there were no longer any flames burning.

This human was so terrifying.

It stretched out its other hand, and pulled forcefully on its dim left arm. Peng, this arm was torn off, but it was only an instant. Flames burned fiercely, and its severed arm immediately regrew.

However, if one looked closely, they would discover that the brightness of the flames on its body had dimmed slightly.

Clearly, there was a price to pay for its severed arm to regenerate.

This ability would definitely be envied to death by countless cultivators, because the regrowth of severed limbs would at least have to be an ability that only Venerate Tier elites could possess, and in the case of Saints, they could even regrow a drop of their blood. The tenacity of their vitality was practically chilling.

Ling Han was also slightly surprised, but he immediately charged out again.

This time, he would kill the Flame King with a crushing force, not giving it any chance to recover.

The Flame King was truly afraid of this human. It stretched out a finger and pointed at Ling Han, wanting to detonate the fire poison in his body.

However, it immediately looked dumbfounded, because there were no flames burning inside Ling Han’s body.

More or less, there had to be something, right?

However, Ling Han had killed his enemies with a single punch before, so what fire poison could invade his body with the Destructive Energy there?

Since there was zero fire poison, how could it be detonated?

The Flame King didn’t believe it and tapped Ling Han again, but it was still ineffective.

Thankfully, it did not know how to speak. If it continued to point and shout “explode, explode, explode” at the same time, the situation would be even more awkward.

‘Holy f*ck! Are you a freak?!1

The Flame King’s expression looked constipated, and he was about to go crazy.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and threw out a punch.

The Flame King hurriedly parried, but the destructive energy corroded, and wherever it touched, the flames all dimmed.

And this was still because it was strong enough. If an ordinary fire monster was hit by a punch, it would be directly destroyed, but it had only dimmed slightly. It lived up to its name as a king.

But so what?

Ling Han followed up with a few more punches. The Flame King was like a fire that had been splashed with water, and very soon, it was completely extinguished.

Die.

Ling Han’s eyes swept over, and couldn’t help but sigh. There was only the essence of fire, and no Fire Origin Stone.

Forget it, it was just that there was no icing on the cake. Furthermore, there were so many caves here. He would look for it elsewhere.

He went back the way he had come. When he arrived at the exit, he immediately sensed that there were a great many people outside.

Previously, he had robbed a dozen over people, and now they had come to exact revenge?

Hehe.

Ling Han was completely unconcerned. In this place, cultivation level was suppressed, and he was unafraid even if elites of Celestial Path came. He would still beat them to burst.

He strode out, and saw that there were indeed over twenty people standing at the cave entrance, led by a young man in red robes who looked to be in his mid-twenties.

When he saw Ling Han, the young man in red smiled faintly, “My name is Pang Shu, a member of the Pang Clan.”

“And then?” Ling Han asked.

Pang Shu was taken aback. He really did not know what else to say now that Ling Han had replied like this.

He was a little embarrassed, and coughed before saying, “I’m the person-in-charge here from the Pang Clan. The essence of flames that you’ve gathered will all be handed over to me. I’ll record the amount for you. When the time comes, you can go to the Pang Clan to trade for what you need.”

‘Oh, this guy thinks I’m a hired help from the Pang Clan?1 Ling Han thought to himself.

“Additionally, malicious competition is not advisable.” Pang Shu continued, “Return all the essence of flames that you have snatched, as well as compensate for some losses, and this matter will be considered over.”

“It’s still Seventh Young Master Pang who is more just,” the others praised.

“Brat, did you hear what Seventh Young Master Pang said? Hurry up and return the essence of flames to us!”

“And compensation!”

“There’s no need for too much, just double it.”

These people clamored. The source of their confidence naturally came from Pang Shu. This was a Foundation Building elite. Even if the cultivation level of this place was suppressed, Foundation Building Tier elites were still considerably stronger than the ordinary Mystery Realm Tier.

“Hey, hey, hey, what are you guys shouting for? There’s not even a single handsome guy, and you have the nerve to say that,” the little loli said in displeasure. How had these people grown up to look like this? She actually couldn’t find a single handsome guy among the twenty over people; they were way too embarrassing.

Ling Han smiled faintly, “You are the person-in-charge of the Pang Clan here?”

“Of course,” Pang Shu said proudly. He looked down on everyone here. There were differences between immortals and mortals, all right? However, in order to complete the mission, he had to be cordial, and this naturally made him very displeased.

Ling Han rubbed his hands together, “Then you must have a lot of essence of fire on you?”

Hold on, why did these words sound so awkward?

Pang Shu was surprised, and asked with a frown, “What do you want to do?”

Ling Han laughed loudly, “Rob you!”

The essence of flames couldn’t be brought out of the valley, so Pang Shu definitely had a lot of essence of flames.

Pang Shu faltered for a moment, then laughed loudly. This young man had really gone mad, to actually say that he wanted to rob him.

When he smiled like this, the others naturally laughed as well. They all looked like they had encountered an idiot.

This was too funny. A mere Mystery Realm Tier actually dared to threaten a Foundation Building elite… if they knew that Ling Han was actually an Enlightenment Tier, they would definitely be even more surprised.

Ling Han did not get angry, and laughed along with everyone else.

Pang Shu suddenly stopped laughing, and said balefully, “Don’t think that just because you have some abilities, you can be condescending. A mere Mystery Realm Tier — yi?”

He looked at Ling Han, and felt that this was a little strange.

Was this really a Mystery Realm Tier?

If this was outside, he would be able to see through Ling Han with a single glance, but now that his cultivation level had been suppressed, his insight had also become considerably poorer. He only felt that Ling Han was a little unusual, but could not tell the exact details.

“With enough strength, you naturally can be arrogant and condescending!” Ling Han suddenly charged out, and shot out a punch.

Pang Shu revealed an expression of disdain. A mere Mystery Realm Tier actually dared to make a move on him?

Fine, he would kill him as a warning to the others. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

He was just about to make a move, when he felt a massive pressure assailing him, as if there was a Primordial Beast exerting pressure on him, causing his heart to tremble in fear.

With this shock, his movements suddenly slowed.

Peng, Ling Han’s fist shot out, and Pang Shu was forcefully smashed onto the ground, his face deeply smashed into the dry and cracked ground.

This… All of a sudden, the whole area was silent, without the slightest bit of sound..
