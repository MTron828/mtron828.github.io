Chapter 1843: Can You Truly Accept Them?

Immortal Palace Tier elite!

“Lord Zihe!” the Dividing Soul Tier elites exclaimed. They hurriedly kneeled down and greeted him with respect.

When coming across elites, it was natural for those who were weaker to pay their respects. Moreover, not only did this Immortal Palace Tier elite possess a superior cultivation, but he had even come from a Celestial King Tier force. Thus, to say nothing of them, even the ancestors of their forces would have to treat him with utmost respect.

This person was called Zihe Ji.

Fu Yan’s heart involuntarily jolted upon seeing him. He could act with arrogance and haughtiness before Qianzhao Yu and the others, and it wouldn’t matter even if they teamed up to target him. He could dispose of them with a single hand.

Even if they used their battleships, he could still rely on his movement techniques to calmly dodge their attacks. He would face absolutely no risk of suffering any wounds.

The cannons of these battleships needed to lock onto their target. With his strength as an Immortal Palace Tier elite, would he allow these cannons to lock onto him?

Meanwhile, Ling Han wasn’t afraid of things exploding out of control. He was enjoying the show, and he even retrieved a chair to sit down on. The Empress sat in his lap, and he appeared as carefree as could be.

‘F*ck!’ Fu Yan almost exploded in rage. ‘Who’s caused all of this trouble? How detestable! If it weren’t for the Roc Palace, I would have already diced you into mincemeat!’

Before Zihe Ji, Fu Yan didn’t dare to act with such arrogance anymore. “Brother Zihe, give me some face this time!”

Zihe Ji’s expression was ice-cold, and he calmly said, “Who do you think you are? Give you some face? You’re not worthy!”

Fu Yan was brutally rejected, and he couldn’t help but go red with anger.

He was also an Immortal Palace Tier elite, yet he was being humiliated before so many people. How could he endure this?

Lin Fang and the others chuckled coldly as they watched this.

‘Ling Han, so what if you’re freakishly talented? You’re destined to die today!

‘With two elites from two different Celestial King Tier forces stepping forward, Fu Yan won’t even dare to make a peep! At that time, how can you, a measly third severance cultivator, escape from the grasp of the Immortal Palace Tier elites?

‘It’s completely impossible! You’re dead meat!’

Fu Yan’s breathing quickened, and only after a short while did he finally manage to compose himself. “Brother Zihe, has this brat also offended your mighty clan?”

Upon hearing this, Zihe Ji’s expression became even colder.

He definitely had to exact revenge. However, the culprit who had killed their successor was only at the Severing Mundane Tier. As such, he wasn’t willing to announce this before so many people. It was far too humiliating!

Oh, the successor of a Celestial King Tier force was even weaker than some random cultivator, and they were even killed with ease? Announcing this would be equivalent to humiliating the Zihe Clan!

“Enough with the nonsense! Hurry up and piss off!” Zihe Ji said in impatience. Not only was he more powerful than Fu Yan, but he had even come from a Celestial King Tier force. Thus, he didn’t need to give him any face at all. Yet, Fu Yan seemed to feel overly confident, and he continued to babble rubbish before him.

Fu Yan’s legs were trembling. He was naturally aware that Zihe Ji had come from a Celestial King Tier force, and he was naturally aware that Zihe Ji was someone he could only gaze up at. However... he gazed toward the female knight from the Roc Palace. The sight of her defeating the nine elites from the Fu Clan was still fresh in his mind.

He gritted his teeth, and said, “Brother Zihe, if it isn’t some great matter, the Fu Clan is willing to make compensations for this brat.”

In his mind, Ling Han might have been overly arrogant, and accidentally offended the successor of this Celestial King Tier force. This was something that could be resolved with peace.

“Hahaha!” Zihe Ji roared with laughter. However, there was no smile on his face.

How laughable! After killing the successor of a Celestial King Tier force, a measly three-star force was now claiming that they were willing to offer compensation? How would they compensate them? What would they compensate them with?

Did they know how many resources were needed to raise a Severing Mundane Tier successor who had severed heaven and earth? It was enough resources to instantly plunge a three-star force into poverty!

“Fine, since you insist, it won’t hurt for me to tell you!” Zihe Ji’s expression was ice-cold, and he continued, “This detestable brat killed Zihe Bingyun, the successor of my clan!”

Pa!

Fu Yan stumbled back and collapsed to the ground. What did it matter that he was an Immortal Palace Tier elite? Right now, he was feeling as weak and feeble as could be.

‘Brat... how have you survived until now?’

Fu Yan wanted to cry, yet no tears were forthcoming. He had initially wanted to butter up to the Roc Palace, yet now... Not only had he failed to butter up to them, but he had even offended the Zihe Clan now.

Even seeking death wasn’t this bad.

‘I’m done with this... I’m completely done with this...’

Fu Yan hurriedly crawled up, saying, “This brat is actually this detestable? I was also deceived! Brother Zihe, please!” He was indeed an elite, and his attitude changed quicker than the pages of a book could be flipped.

The other elites couldn’t help but look at him with disdain. ‘Weren’t you all arrogant and mighty just then? Why have you suddenly become a coward?’

“Oh, it’s fortunate that you said this. Otherwise, you’d already be a corpse!”

Crackle!

A bolt of lightning descended from the sky. This was a solidly built man, and his entire body was covered in arcs of white lightning. As they intertwined, they formed numerous symbols of the great dao. Just his presence alone was enough to frighten everyone present.

Everyone had to face heavenly tribulation. Thus, lightning was undoubtedly something that many people detested.

This man was Sun Zhen, an elite from the Thundercloud Palace.

Fu Yan’s frail heart involuntarily shuddered again. ‘Did Ling Han also do something to the Holy Son of the Thundercloud Palace? Gasp! It can’t be, right...?’ He didn’t dare to ponder this anymore. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

‘Holy f*ck! How can there exist such a troublemaker in the world?

‘The Fu Clan definitely can’t shoulder his crimes! We simply can’t shoulder his crimes!’

He respectfully stepped back. Although Qianzhao Yu and the others were gazing at him in disdain, he simply pretended that he couldn’t see their gazes. This was no time to act with arrogance.

“Ling Han, how audacious of you!” Sun Zhen roared. His voice was like booming thunder.

Ling Han grinned, and said, “You’re right, I’m indeed an audacious person!”

Upon hearing this, those who had been slightly doubtful about Ling Han killing Zihe Bingyun were fully convinced that he was the culprit.

Just listen! He was actually speaking to an Immortal Palace Tier elite with such disrespect! That being the case, would he give a damn about killing a Severing Mundane Tier cultivator?

Sun Zhen faltered upon hearing this. He hadn’t been praising Ling Han, so why was this brat so proud of himself? He humphed before continuing, “Since you’ve admitted it, you can go die!”

“Brother Sun, let the Zihe Clan deal with this brat!” Zihe Ji said as he stepped forward and grabbed Sun Zhen’s wrist. He stopped Sun Zhen from attacking Ling Han.

Ling Han was only at the peak stage of the third severance, so how had he killed Zihe Bingyun and Luo Changfeng?

This brat definitely harbored some great secret. As such, Zihe Ji wanted to personally kill him so that he could pluck his soul and steal his secrets.

Sun Zhen chuckled, and said, “Fine, I’ll kill him, and you can take his corpse.”

Zihe Ji also chuckled, saying, “Since you’re already willing to hand his corpse to me, why don’t you let me kill him as well?”

“Brother Zihe, you’re pushing things a little. This brat killed the Holy Son of my sect, so how can I let him off without doing anything?”

“Is it not the same if I deal with him? The most important thing is the result!”

The two elites started to argue with each other. Both of them wanted to kill Ling Han as doing so would allow them to pluck his soul at this first instance. After all, they couldn’t trust each other to share his secrets.

Everyone came to a sudden realization upon seeing this. They had naturally come across similar situations before, so they all knew what these two elites were arguing about.

Ling Han sighed, and said, “Have you two finished arguing or not? I don’t have so much time to waste.” It was a shame that the large black dog had already left. Otherwise, he could unleash his might and dispose of these measly Immortal Palace Tier elites in the blink of an eye.

“Brother Sun, then let’s rely on our own abilities,” Zihe Ji said. He knew that he couldn’t convince Sun Zhen, so he decided not to speak any more nonsense.

“Agreed!” Sun Zhen said with a nod. In the end, arguments between cultivators were always settled using power.

They both lashed out to snatch Ling Han’s life.

Pa!

However, just as they raised their hands, two lengths of white silk suddenly shot over from the sky in the distance, wrapping around their wrists and forcefully stopping their attacks.
