2909 Wedding and assault

Of course, this was only an idea. Firstly, Ling Xi would definitely not have it, and secondly, Ling Han could not bring himself to kill Fu Tianxing. After all, he was a disciple that he had personally taught.

However, when Ling Han thought about how his daughter, such a delicate flower, was about to be stolen by that brat, Ling Han couldn’t help but feel furious. No matter how he looked at Fu Tianxing, he was still displeased.

He reluctantly arranged a wedding for the two of them.

Of course, Ling Han was also a celebrity now. Who didn’t know that he was freakish? While being at Third Tier, he could already fight Xin Qihu who was a Fourth Tier, and his future prospects were limitless. Thus, when they learned that he was going to marry off his daughter, the people who came to offer their congratulations came in waves.

On the day of Ling Xi’s wedding, there were as many guests as there were clouds in the skies.

“Yi, Miss Lin, I didn’t expect you to give me face!” Ling Han was surprised because even Lin Youlian had come.

It wasn’t Ling Han’s wedding, so Lin Youlian had given him enough face by deigning to attend.

Lin Youlian only smiled and nodded. She had never been competitive or angry; she was actually very similar to Ling Xi.

When the auspicious time arrived, everyone came to the hall, ready to witness the most important moment in the couple’s lives.

“Wu…”

At this moment, an ancient and melodious horn sounded, startling everyone.

“The Hysteria army is attacking!” someone suddenly shouted.

In an instant, everyone was in an uproar. This day had finally arrived.

Lin Youlian immediately displayed her calm side as the commander-in-chief, and said, “Everyone, go below the city wall immediately.”

“Understood!”

All the Heavenly Venerates obeyed and set off one after another.

Ling Han also nodded at the people from the Ling Alliance. “Let’s go.”

Everyone arrived at the city wall. Some were making preparations below, while others stood on the city wall and looked into the distance.

The raging energy storm was about to disappear, and through the thin shroud remaining of the energy storm, one could see rows of Hysteria troops that were ready to attack. It was too easy to distinguish them, and it was extremely obvious that they had many heads and limbs. Their unique traits were extremely apparent.

As long as the energy storm completely dissipated, this iron-blooded army would charge over. They had no mercy. Not only did they not care about the lives of their enemies, but they also did not care about the lives of their companions.

Everyone’s heart constricted. This was the most crucial battle. As long as they could withstand this wave of attacks, everything would be fine. However, if they couldn’t, they might be defeated.

The energy storm became weaker and weaker, and when there was only a tiny bit left, some irritable Hysteria troops became the first ones to rush out. However, after being sucked in and ground to nothing by the energy storm, even Fifth Tiers were instantly wiped out.

One had to know that this was something only Seventh Tiers, who were indestructible and immortal, could withstand.

However, after only a few breaths’ time, the energy storm finally disappeared completely. Boom, the Hysteria army suddenly erupted with a terrifying whistling sound. Instantly, this army moved, charging towards them like an avalanche.

“Attack!” Xin Qihu commanded, and several thousand Heavenly Venerates on the city wall attacked at the same time. Instantly, streaks of brilliance shot out, and even the sky lost its color, leaving only these attacks dancing wildly.

Most of these were Fifth Tiers’ attacks. Although long-range attacks would be slightly weaker in terms of power, they were still very powerful.

Boom!

This wave of attacks fell, and the Hysteria’s army collapsed in large numbers. These were all cannon fodder with cultivation level below the Fifth Tier, but those at the Fifth Tier were practically unharmed, and were charging forward faster and faster.

“Prepare for close combat!” Wu Haoyang shouted.

He took out a saber and floated in midair, casting down a golden light. When the Hysteria army rushed past the city wall and collided with this golden light, a large number of Heavenly Venerates were immediately destroyed.

He was an elite with Sixth-Tier battle prowess, and here he was almost like a cheat.

Lin Youlian and Xin Qihu also released their respective precious tools. Although their martial prowess was outstanding, they could not kill recklessly here. They had to prioritize the overall situation. Their most important mission was to minimize their own losses.

Otherwise, Hysteria would have been able to continuously send out an army, and one more of their number dying would mean one less soldier.

However, Ling Han did not have such scruples. He let out a long howl, and took the initiative to attack.

He channeled the Heavenly Venerable Seals, drew his Divine Demon Sword, and began a massacre.

Pu, pu, pu. His battle prowess was now at the peak stage of the Fifth Tier, and those who had not reached Fifth Tier were absolutely not Ling Han’s match, and were not able to withstand a single blow from him. Streaks of ink-black blood splashed out, and the Hysteria’s troops that died in his hands instantly exceeded 100.

However, Ling Han was surprised to discover that he had not absorbed the slightest bit of life essence.

The Hysteria’s troops weren’t considered as lives? Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

He recalled that he hadn’t been able to absorb any life essence after killing Meng Dong’s group, either. It seemed that this was a special characteristic of Hysteria—they could only absorb and not release.

Previously, when Shao Ying and Ba Duo died, their life essence would overflow because they were indeed human at that time. However, after Meng Dong and the others fused together, it was different. It was as if they had summoned a portion of Hysteria. It was completely a characteristic of Hysteria.

This made Ling Han very disappointed. He had originally thought that given that the Realm Battlefield had reopened, he could use this to quickly increase his cultivation level. He had not expected that killing the Hysteria army was basically meaningless.

He roared loudly and channeled the first-grade Heavenly Venerable Seal, stimulating his battle prowess to an even more terrifying level as he unleashed a merciless massacre.

The number of Hysteria troops was astonishing, but there was also a flaw. None of them had mastered Heavenly Venerable Seals.

One could imagine how difficult it was to bestow Heavenly Venerable Seals on others. One could only sever them from oneself. Even Hysteria, as a dimension itself, should be greatly restricted.

In this way, within the Fifth Tier’s ranks, the Hysteria troops that could suppress Ling Han didn’t exist at all, allowing him to charge about recklessly.

However, he only had Fifth-Tier battle prowess, after all. Facing a battle prowess of hundreds of thousands of enemies of the same level, even Ling Han would not be able to withstand it. Under the fierce and violent bombardment of the enemy, he got injured swiftly, and had no choice but to retreat behind the city wall to catch his breath.

This was definitely not a quick battle that could be ended swiftly, so he could not be too anxious. What if he encountered danger after he has revealed all his trump cards at once?

Lin Youlian and the other two were in charge. They were incomparably powerful, and were completely focused on defense. Naturally, they formed an insurmountable barrier and guarded firmly. If anyone encountered danger, they would immediately make a move to render assistance.

Without these three people, the casualties of Ling Han and the others would have increased by more than tenfold.

If anyone could not hold on any longer, they would hide within the protection range of their three precious tools. The area covered by such a protection range was very small, but it formed an absolute defense. The Hysteria’s army could not break through at all, because this was the might of the Sixth Tier.

The Hysteria troops were endless, ranging from Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings to Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerates. The number of monsters at each cultivation level was also astonishingly large, and there were hundreds of thousands of monsters at the Fifth Tier. Compared to the Flaming Frost Realm’s mere 1,000-odd people, they were suppressed by more than a hundred-fold in terms of quantity.

This battle lasted for a full three months before the follow-up troops from Hysteria’s side were finally sparse, and it was no longer as overwhelming as before.

This was a great victory, but at the same time, it was also a tragic victory. The number of Heavenly Venerates who had died in battle was as high as 10,000. Although it was pitifully small compared to the number of Hysteria’s combatants, how many Heavenly Venerates were there in the Flaming Frost Realm?
