Chapter 1725: Heading to the Severing Mundane Pool

Mao Dai relented far too easily, so much so that Ding Shan found it slightly difficult to accept. However, he didn’t hesitate as he said “apologies” and entered the chariot.

Ding Shan used his divine sense to investigate the chariot, yet he couldn’t find anything out of the ordinary. He investigated it for a second time, yet he still made no discoveries. Only after investigating it for the third time did he exit the chariot, and say, “Brother Mao, please allow me to search your body.”

Mao Dai smiled calmly as he raised his arms and signified for Ding Shan to search as he pleased.

However, he was feeling slightly astonished at this moment. This was because he had personally witnessed Ling Han entering the chariot, yet Ding Shan actually hadn’t managed to find any traces of him. This was truly strange.

No wonder Ling Han had been brimming with confidence just then, telling him to let the Ding Clan search all they wanted.

In reality, Ling Han didn’t need to seek his help in leaving the city at all. There were numerous convoys leaving the city these past few days, and with Ling Han’s abilities, he simply needed to sneak into one of these convoys to leave without a trace.

Mao Dai smiled faintly. Ling Han had most likely asked for his help to bid him farewell. Otherwise, Ling Han could have left without him ever knowing.

This young man was fairly interesting.

Anyhow, Mao Dai had no Spatial God Tool on him, so Ding Shan naturally couldn’t find anything at all. Ding Shan looked at him in astonishment. Perhaps he was truly leaving the city for a spin?

“Can I leave the city now?” Mao Dai asked calmly.

“Please go ahead, Brother Mao.” Ding Shan ordered the guards to step aside.

Mao Dai entered the chariot and continued on his journey.

However, after standing on the city walls and gazing at the disappearing chariot for a while, Ding Shan suddenly leaped down and started to tail it.

He had a nagging feeling that it was strange for Mao Dai to leave the city at this moment. Combined with Mao Dai’s relationship with Ling Han, Ding Shan subconsciously made the decision to tail him.

Although he kept a great distance, his divine sense would definitely detect Ling Han if he were to appear in the chariot.

However, it seemed as if Mao Dai were truly out for sightseeing. During the dozen or so days, he continued to travel around and visit different sites. This caused Ding Shan to lose most of his patience. After all, he couldn’t place all of his wagers on Mao Dai. What if he were only bait?

Thus, after tailing him for another three days, Ding Shan finally gave up and returned to Dark Moon City.

“Brat, you can come out now,” Mao Dai said. He had naturally detected Ding Shan tailing them. Although Ding Shan had concealed himself extremely well, who was Mao Dai? He was the greatest prodigy behind Ding Yaolong!

However, Ling Han didn’t leave the Black Tower immediately. Only after waiting for half a day more did he suddenly appear in the chariot.

He had no option but to do this. After all, when Mao Dai had called him just then, he had still been making love with the Empress and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. How could he stop? Thus, he could only make Mao Dai wait for a little longer.

However, Ling Han naturally wouldn’t reveal this. He simply said, “Thank you for helping, Senior.”

Mao Dai chuckled, and said, “Even without my help, it would have been easy for you to leave. In a few months, I’ll be bringing Zhang Chong to the Severing Mundane Pool. If you come across Zhang Chong inside, then please do help if you’re able to.”

“Definitely!” Ling Han replied. He then asked, “Senior, does one only need to enter a special place when severing the first mundane?”

Mao Dai nodded, and replied, “Generally speaking, yes. This is because only heaven and earth possess the power to sever the mundane. However, after the first time, one’s body will also possess the engraving of such power. As such, one won’t need to enter these special places anymore. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“However, due to the limitations of their talent, some people do indeed need to go to places such as the Severing Mundane Pool every time they sever a mundane. They need to comprehend the mystical power of heaven and earth anew before they can sever the second mundane, the third mundane, and so on.”

Ling Han nodded in understanding before respectfully bowing, and saying, “Then farewell, Senior.”

Mao Dai waved his hands, and said, “Farewell.”

However, he felt some slight pity after saying this, and he continued, “I initially wanted to betroth my daughter to you, but it’s a shame that you have a keen habit of causing trouble. I certainly won’t feel at ease if my daughter follows you.”

Ling Han grimaced upon hearing this, and he hurriedly quickened his pace. He genuinely didn’t want to be involved in any more intimate relationships. He already had enough lovers to deal with.

After walking for several days and finally leaving the range of influence of Dark Moon City, Ling Han let the Empress and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden out from the Black Tower. After all, he couldn’t keep them trapped inside all the time.

The three of them happily continued their journey.

After walking for a dozen or so days, they arrived at another city. After entering this city, they immediately boarded a large ship. This could save them heaps of time. Otherwise, they would only arrive at the Severing Mundane Pool when it was already about to open.

Ling Han and the Empress seized this opportunity to strengthen their comprehensions. There was only one year left, so if they couldn’t comprehend enough about their cultivation, they would need to wait for another 10,000,000 years. Or they could also go to another Mystery Realm to sever the mundane.

Because they had an abundant supply of Star Stones, they bought whatever Saint Pills they wanted. In their eyes, these Saint Pills were cheap anyway.

Ling Han started to refine alchemical pills in an almost wasteful manner. He cut out the most valuable portion of the Saint Pills which contained the comprehensions of heaven and earth, only leaving the portion that could elevate one’s Origin Power. Otherwise, refining these alchemical pills would take far too long.

He and the Empress took these alchemical pills every day—these were alchemical pills that could be eaten even after one reached the peak stage of the consummate level of the Genesis Tier. This was a process of accumulation. Advancing to the Severing Mundane Tier was hugely exhausting, so without enough Origin Power accumulated, one might end up completely draining themselves during the process. That would definitely be a tragedy.

The Empress had already entered the final stages of preparation, and all she needed to do was sever the mundane now. Meanwhile, Ling Han was still continuing to accumulate Origin Power. After one month on the ship, he finally reached the peak stage of the Genesis Tier as well.

10 billion heavenly bodies!

However, he didn’t stop here, and he continued to increase the number of heavenly bodies. This was the meaning of accumulation. Possessing more heavenly bodies wouldn’t raise his battle prowess after he advanced to the Severing Mundane Tier, but it could provide him with a huge reserve of Origin Power when he was in the process of advancing to the Severing Mundane Tier.

Another three months passed, and Ling Han finally disembarked from the ship with the Empress and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden.

They arrived at Moon Scattering City, one of the farthest cities under the Black Moon Sect’s rule. If they continued forward, they would be venturing into regions controlled by forces of Hundred Magnificence City’s Xiao Clan. Meanwhile, the Severing Mundane Pool was located 15,000 or so kilometers away from Moon Scattering City.

Theoretically speaking, the Severing Mundane Pool should have belonged inside the territory of the Black Moon Sect. However, because this was a border region, and because of the unique effects of this Mystery Realm, many people would especially travel over if they wanted to advance to the Severing Mundane Tier, regardless of whether they were from Hundred Magnificence City’s Xiao Clan or from the Fu Clan.

Of all the regions ruled by the Fu Clan, the Severing Mundane Pool was the best Mystery Realm for one to sever their mundane.

Right now, there was less than one year until the Severing Mundane Pool opened, so there were already countless Saint Kings gathered in Moon Scattering City. They were waiting to undergo the most important trial in their life.

If they successfully advanced, they would become elites of the Celestial Realm. At the same time, they would truly break free from the cycle of aging, sickness, and death. However, if they failed to advance, they would almost certainly sever their own life.

Moon Scattering City was brimming with people. Although this city was subordinate to the Black Moon Sect, many of the forces inside this city were still eternal enemies with each other. Thus, conflicts often broke out, and it was normal to see scenes of chaos or scores of corpses in the mountains.

Ling Han and his two wives were extremely low-key as they quietly cultivated and awaited the opening of the Severing Mundane Pool.

Another 10 months passed, and they left the city to travel to the Severing Mundane Pool.
