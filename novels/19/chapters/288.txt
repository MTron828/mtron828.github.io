Chapter 289: Stupefaction

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

Hu Niu wasn’t resigned to being left on the side, and insisted on going into the pill refining room. Ling Han didn’t mind letting her come in—as long as she didn’t help refine the pill, it didn’t count as breaking the rules anyways.

Quite a few people immediately shook their heads. Pill refining needed single-hearted devotion, so letting in a little girl inside who later might yell out and cause a slight distraction would definitely cause the furnace to explode.

Refining an Earth Grade medicinal pill, and once it failed... the thought of such a loss made everyone’s hearts bleed. However, the one refining the pill was Ling Han and he didn’t have any objections, so who would want mind his business?

Only Cheng Fei Jun revealed a smirk; his confidence increased.

“In principle, the pill refining limit is one day and one night, but it can be extended to two days,” Yun Xing Xian said. “What medicinal pill do you plan on refining?”

“Seven Turns Break Crisis Pill,” Ling Han said, waving his hand in passing as large amounts of medicinal ingredients were laid on the ground.

Since he specially came here to take the test for the Earth Grade, he naturally already prepared all the ingredients. The Rain Country’s resources were limited, and it would naturally be impossible to assemble all of them normally, but with his previous trip into the Devil Sky Mystery Realm, he’d obtained several stalks of spirit medicine, planting them in the Black Tower.

After so many days had passed, it just about reached the age it required as an ingredient. Thus, Ling Han matched these spirit medicines and found secondary materials, at last deciding on refining Seven Turns Break Crisis Pill, which was the only Earth Grade medicinal pill he could refine with the materials he had in hand.

“Seven Turns Break Crisis Pill!” the three alchemists cried out. “That’s something that can make the Flower Blossom Tier warriors escape a cultivation deviation crisis, even turning it into fortune, increasing the tier comprehension!”

The other alchemists naturally heard of it too, nodding their heads successively. Seven Turns Break Crisis Pill was a true low level Earth Grade medicinal pill, and its degree of preciousness at this level could rank at the very front.

The three Big Bosses probably didn’t have the ability to refine this sort of medicinal pill, right?

Cheng Fei Jun’s smirk was even more vibrant. Earlier, seeing that Ling Han actually prepared the materials, he was slightly shocked, but hearing that Ling Han was actually going to refine Seven Turns Break Crisis Pill, he was all too happy.

Was it possible?

Even if these three Bis Bosses refined it, 10% success rate would already be a miracle! A high level medicinal pill like this was packed up with huge volumes of ingredients, and behind each successful pill formation were countless wasted materials.

A mere youngster dared to say he was refining a Seven Turns Break Crisis Pill? Pah!

Not to mention, there was a little girl inside the pill refining room. With a glance, one could tell she wasn’t a quiet one; sticking to Ling Han’s arms in one moment, then lying on his back the next, and then sitting on his lap—how could one refine pills like this?

You really think you’re the god of alchemy, huh.

...Ling Han really was!

“Then will you begin now?” Long Yong Zhang asked Ling Han.

“I’ll begin now!” Ling Han nodded, waving his right hand, shutting the pill refining room’s door.

Yong Long Zhang nodded towards someone who immediately set a massive hourglass, starting the countdown.

He began to sort the ingredients.

Ling Han immediately began moving. Shua, shua, shua, he was like the moving clouds and flowing water, sorting and stripping away impurities. That strong rhythm gave people an extreme sense of beauty that all but intoxicated the alchemists.

“My goodness, sorting materials could be done like that!”

“I truly lived in vain for so many years!”

“That smoothness probably couldn’t be witnessed on those three lords, right?

“Shh!”

“It makes it completely impossible to believe that this is jut a seventeen-year-old youngster.”

Everyone cried out, convinced by Ling Han just like that.

That was natural; the Grandmaster of alchemy’s handiwork without such an effect instead would be weirder.

Even the three Earth Grade alchemists subconsciously began to stir. They secretly decided that even if Ling Han failed to become an Earth Grade alchemist, they would still take care of him. This youngster was too miraculous, and they definitely wanted to discuss methods on processing ingredients with him.

Only Zhu He Xin revealed a proud expression. ‘A bunch of country bumpkins, wait till later, when you all see young master Han extract the medicinal ingredients, maybe even ending up spitting out your tongue from surprise?’

Ling Han very quickly entered the purification phase.

Pu!

Suddenly, dozens of people spurted out, and those who didn’t stared agape.

“Do I have blurred vision? How come I see him purifying nine ingredients together?”

“I’ve also got blurred vision!”

“It’s not blurred vision, it’s real! He really is purifying nine ingredients together! My goodness, why haven’t the medicinal properties been destroyed? Even separated by a crystal wall, I can still be one hundred percent sure that the medicinal properties definitely aren’t lost by a single bit.”

“A freak! A freak!”

The three alchemy bigshots’ faces were twitching. If the sorting of materials was only having strong rhythm, then they were truly shocked now.

So purifying could be done like this?

They were all Earth Grade alchemists, viewing themselves highly, but now they all felt that they were schoolchildren who had just stepped into alchemy, developing new awareness about the basic movements.

They lived in vain for so many years!

Ling Han wouldn’t pay attention to everyone’s shock; after he completed the purification of each material, he shook his left hand as the Strange Fire came out of the Black Tower, adhering to his hand as a stunning flame lifted.

The formal pill refined began.

He had already crossed into the Gushing Spring Tier, and after so many days had passed, he reached the ninth layer of it; his activation and control of heat were naturally greatly increased, and his endurance of the heat increased by a whole lot.

“Strange Fire!”

“Truly one who’s cared for by the heavens!”

“Yes, otherwise no matter how genius he is, under his cultivation’s limitations, one in the Gushing Spring Tier can at most refine a medium level Black Grade medicinal pill.”

Seeing the Strange Fire, quite a few people’s gaze swept towards Cheng Fei Jun. This guy also had a Strange Fire that allowed him to refine high level Black Grade medicinal pill at the Gushing Spring Tier, and thus was crowned with the glory of an alchemy genius.

However, if Ling Han was successful in becoming an Earth Grade alchemist, then based on the promise, Cheng Fei Jun had to give his Strange Fire to Ling Han. As a result, his alchemy level would definitely drop by a level.

Today, one of these two young quasi-alchemy masters was definitely going to fall off the god’s altar. The difference was if Ling Han failed, Cheng Fei Jun would be unmoved, but if Ling Han succeeded, then a legend would be created.

A seventeen year old Earth Grade alchemist!

Thinking about it made people’s scalps numb. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Hu Niu acted spoiled for a while, but seeing that Ling Han paid no attention to her, she instantly became unhappy, touching her small stomach as she said, “Niu’s hungry!”

Ling Han nodded. With his left hand still refining, his right hand casually took out food ingredients prepared in the Black tower, raised a flame, set up a grill, and placed a piece of pork on top, starting to grill it.

“Pu! Pu! Pu!”

Everyone spurted out, and their eyes almost fell out as they gaped.

Are you really pill refining... how come that after refining for a while, you set up a grill? Just how hungry are you?
