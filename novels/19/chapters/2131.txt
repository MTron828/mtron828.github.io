Chapter 2132: Formation breaks

Ling Han began breaking through to Earth Soul.

Over the last 10,000 years, he had been focused on studying the Five Elements Source Powers, and under the time acceleration effects of the Black Tower, that time had been further extended to 10,000,000 years. In this process, he naturally gained a very deep, profound understanding of the essence of the Dao of Heaven and Earth.

Those were Source Powers of heaven and earth. It was very rare for even Celestial Kings to gain even one, so they were naturally wondrous.

The cultivation level barrier was very soon broken through. This was only a minor level. For a prodigy like Ling Han, it was naturally unable to cause any kind of difficulty.

Hong, long, long, tribulation clouds began gathering densely in the skies, and the heavenly tribulation came as promised.

At first, Ling Han wanted to use the heavenly tribulation to break free of the siege by the Four Seas Palace so he could go and visit his parents, Helian Xunxue, and the others. With the “boost” of heavenly tribulation, who would dare stop him? But upon further thought, he dismissed this idea.

The heavenly tribulation would only last half a day. They only had to follow him, and make their move after the heavenly tribulation dispersed. By then, what could he do?

Under tempering from the heavenly tribulation, Ling Han’s physique gained a certain amount of improvement. However, there was not much use now with just the heavenly tribulation alone. Ling Han would have to further exploit the profound secrets of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll.

He endured this heavenly tribulation very easily. Half a day later, he packed up and returned.

However, a storm was brewing inside the Roc Palace, and the core of the problem was him.

…The Roc Palace did not accept make disciples, nor did they entertain male guests. Having Ling Han here was clearly unjustified. Thus, a Seventh Heaven elder raised a suggestion, discussing the matter of expelling Ling Han from the Roc Palace.

‘What?!’

When Ling Han found out, he appeared incredibly stunned.

Things had already come so far, and some old women were actually still in the mood to discuss this problem?

Had their brains been kicked by a donkey?

However, his cultivation level was low, and he had no status, so no one would be concerned about his opinion—not many people knew that Ling Han was actually the heir of a Heavenly Venerate, just like not many people knew that “Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable” was actually the bestowed title of a Heavenly Venerate, and that was the same for Yuan Sheng.

Otherwise, the heir of a Heavenly Venerate was still very scary, though the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable had long since passed away.

In the end, it was Long Yuexi who had stepped out, and said that extreme times called for extreme measures, suppressing all disagreements.

As Ling Han saw it, this was definitely not a disturbance that was only directed at him—a group of Celestial Kings were discussing the going or staying of a Dividing Soul Tier behind closed doors? You got to be kidding. Even if they were presently trapped inside the Roc Palace, they were not as bored as that.

There were traitors within the Roc Palace. Ling Han had long since guessed this when they had been ambushed on the sea, and now with such an event happening, he definitely did not believe that it was a mere accident or coincidence.

However, Ling Han could not do much. Long Yuexi should have long since deduced that there was a traitor in the Palace. If she had not done anything to stay on guard, she would not have deserved to be a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

Ling Han also came to know that there was no Eighth Heaven Celestial King in the Roc Heaven. Thus, beneath Long Yuexi, there were two Seventh Heaven Celestial Kings that had the highest authority.

Long Yuexi could die at any moment. These two Seventh Heaven Celestial Kings were responsible for the duty of assisting, guiding, and protecting Hu Niu. They were also figures that possessed considerable power within the Roc Palace.

These two Celestial Kings were Elder Fuyun and Elder Sanhe. Elder Fuyun was the more radical of the two, and had a very strong thirst for power, while Elder Sanhe was completely focused on cultivation, and belonged to the type that was more unconcerned.

This time, it was Elder Fuyun that had brought up the matter of Ling Han’s expulsion from the Roc Palace.

As a great Seventh Heaven Celestial King, how could she bring herself to do it?

There was something off with this old woman.

Ling Han immediately concluded so internally, but the other party had high status and great power, so how could she be displaced merely with a few words from him? Of course, Hu Niu would definitely listen to him, but would the other people listen to Hu Niu?

Hong, long, long,?he felt a resounding boom sound in his ears, as if the heaven and earth had crumbled.

‘What’s going on?

“How dare you!!” Long Yuexi’s voice rang out, filled with fury.

“Hahaha, Fuyun Celestial King, well done!” Shang Zhiwei’s voice sounded as well. “From today onwards, you will be the Vice Imperial Empress of our Four Seas Palace.”

Instantly, Ling Han’s heart jolted.

He had just been thinking that there was something off with this old woman, but he had not thought that something would happen so fast.

The Great Mountain Protective Formation… had been opened!

Multiple battleships were seen appearing in the skies, casting dark shadows, just like casting a shadow on the hearts of the members of the Roc Palace.

“Why has the Great Mountain Protective Formation been unlocked?”

“Could it be that it was Elder Fuyun?”

“Nonsense, didn’t you hear Shang Zhiwei’s words?”

“I say, the Four Seas Palace only wants Yi Yun and the grand elder, so why should we put our lives on the line? Why don’t we just surrender to the Four Seas Palace?”

“That’s right, even if we don’t side with the Four Seas Palace, we can completely leave without any reservations. Why should we cling to a rock that is destined to sink like the Roc Palace and die alongside it?”

Everyone was conversing spiritedly. Some were incredibly stunned, while there were others that were advising people to surrender.

Ling Han heard all this, and finally understood that the meeting previously was only a pretense. Its purpose was to allow those that wished to surrender to have an exchange of words, to achieve some kind of agreement. And now, as Fuyun Celestial King had unlocked the Great Mountain Protective Formation, the others became lobbyists, speeding up the destruction of the Roc Palace.

“Long Yuexi, today will be the day of your death!” Shang Zhiwei’s figure appeared, standing proudly in the air, but her exquisitely beautiful figure was exuding an air of supreme dominance, like an ultimate empress.

“It is only a battle!” Long Yuexi appeared, similarly standing proudly in the air. She wielded a purple walking cane in her right hand. Though she looked aged and decrepit, the aura she exuded was no weaker than Shang Zhiwei’s. “It is not determined yet who will live or die!”

“You are already at the end of your line, and you still dare speak tough!” Shang Zhiwei said disdainfully. Now that the Heavenly Venerable Tier Great Formation had been opened, the Roc Palace was only a piece of cake in her eyes. “The others may be spared as long as you put down your weapons. The reincarnation of Tianyun must be captured, and this person…”

She extended a finger and tapped at the empty air, showing Ling Han’s image. “This boy must not be harmed. Whoever touches a hair on his head, I will consign you to eternal damnation!”

Everyone was immediately stunned. Wasn’t this the person who had fled into the Roc Palace not too long ago? Why had he now gotten a connection with Shang Zhiwei? She actually said that not a single hair on his head was to be touched? Could it be that this was her illegitimate son?

Though they were shocked, the members of the Four Seas Palace, at least, had to abide by her words strictly.

“Put down your weapons!

“Put down your weapons!

“Put down your weapons!”

The members of the Four Seas Palace all shouted. If they could win the battle without fighting, they naturally would not wish to risk their lives in battle. After all, there were not many battle maniacs like Ling Han. Most people cultivated because they desired status, power, and wealth. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Meanwhile, the members of the Roc Palace were at a loss. So should they fight or not?

The Great Mountain Protective Formation that was like a great wall had already been conquered, and the grand elder was definitely no match for Shang Zhiwei, either—otherwise they would not have stuck to a defensive strategy, being beaten on by their enemies all this while.

Then, if the result was destined to be their defeat, what would be the point of further battle?

Those that had long since borne the intent of betrayal immediately threw down their weapons. Now that they had started, a great many people who were indecisive immediately followed their lead, and put down their weapons. There was less than one-tenth of people that were willing to be loyal to the Roc Palace to the death.

Long Yuexi couldn’t help but sigh. Though she had stayed on guard against any betrayal in the ranks, she had never thought that it would be someone like Celestial King Fuyun. This was the strongest person next to herself, and she had also placed high hopes on the latter. When she died, the Roc Palace would be temporarily delegated under her leadership.

She raised her voice, and announced, “All disciples, put down your weapons. From this day onwards, the Roc Palace… is disbanded!”

This was cutting their losses. As long as Hu Niu could grow to become a Ninth Heaven Celestial King in the future, then the Roc Palace would be able to rise up again one day. Otherwise, there was no need for unnecessary sacrifice.
