3110 Trading for fruits

Ling Han knew that his strength had increased too quickly, so the toughness of his body could not keep up. Others should not have such a problem. For others, their physique was also slowly becoming stronger at the same time that their cultivation level increased, so there was nothing to worry about.

Ling Han went to where Sun Jianfang was. He did not dare to fully display his power, and only said that he had already opened up his second meridian, and was about to expand this meridian to its limit.

Of course, Sun Jianfang was overjoyed. After giving him some encouragement, he gave him another Meridian Guiding Fruit.

“This is the last Meridian Guiding Fruit,” he said.

The Ancient Dao Sect could harvest 10 Meridian Guiding Fruits in a year. Even if he was the sect master, it was impossible for him to give all of them to Ling Han to use.

“I understand.”

Ling Han left. He had already thought of a way to resolve the problem of the Meridian Guiding Fruit.

That day, he refined the Meridian Guiding Fruit into alchemical pills and went to the black market. He set up a stall and wrote a few words on the ground. “I have the Meridian Guiding Pill, and am willing to trade for the Meridian Guiding Fruit.”

When everyone saw this, they immediately surrounded him.

Who didn’t know that the Meridian Guiding Pill was more effective than the Meridian Guiding Fruit? It was obvious from the price. The market price of the Meridian Guiding Fruit was 100 jade seeds, and the price of the Meridian Guiding Pill exceeded this number.

Therefore, who wouldn’t want to refine the Meridian Guiding Fruit into alchemical pills? The problem was that no one could do it.

Now, seeing Ling Han offer such conditions, others could naturally guess that Ling Han definitely had a way to refine the Meridian Guiding Fruit into alchemical pills. This would allow him to make a huge profit. The key was that they themselves didn’t know how to do it. Then, faced with a choice between a Meridian Guiding Pill and a Meridian Guiding Fruit, how would they choose? Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

They would naturally choose the Meridian Guiding Pill.

Of course, no one would be foolish enough to bring the Meridian Guiding Fruit here. However, after a short while, people left and came back again to commence a trade of the Meridian Guiding Fruit.

“I have a condition,” one person said. “I know that you will definitely be able to refine the Meridian Guiding Pill. My condition is that after you refine it, you have to sell me another one.”

Ling Han thought for a moment, and said, “Alright.”

He had made a fortune, so he didn’t mind giving others some benefits. Besides, this didn’t break the rule that each person could only buy a single pill.

“Brother, Brother!” Nie Yang also came. This time, he was wearing a pig-headed mask. It seemed that he had a “showman” personality[1]. “I also have a Meridian Guiding Fruit here. Take it, but don’t forget about me if there are benefits!”

Ling Han smiled faintly. Nie Yang was definitely more knowledgeable about the ways of the world than the previous one. He had directly sold Ling Han a favor.

“Alright.” Ling Han nodded. He planned to give one to Nie Yang after refining the Meridian Guiding Fruit into alchemical pills.

Although he had brought seven Meridian Guiding Pills, in reality, only three people traded with him.

With rough calculations, the Ancient Dao Sect had 10 Meridian Guiding Fruits a year; three had been given to Ling Han by Sun Daofang, and three more had been traded to Ling Han. That meant that there were only four aside from those he had gotten. Perhaps the people with the Treasured Fruit had yet to receive the news, or perhaps the fruits had already been eaten.

Ling Han temporarily closed his stall. In any case, he had three more Meridian Guiding Fruits, so he could refine quite a few Meridian Guiding Pills.

After returning to his residence, he first went to refine pills. This time, he obtained 23 alchemical pills. His efficiency in refining pills could be said to have improved considerably.

“Young Master, Young Master!” Ling Han had just entered through the door when he saw Huan Xue welcoming him excitedly.

He couldn’t help but smile, and asked, “What is it? Is the sky about to collapse?”

Huan Xue was a little embarrassed that she had lost her composure. However, in the next moment, she became excited again, and said, “Young Master, I sensed my meridians!”

“Very good.” Ling Han nodded. He had seen this girl’s hard work, and he was also very happy.

However, Huan Xue’s expression immediately darkened, and she said apologetically, “Young Master, it’s all my fault for being too stupid. I have consumed all three Meridian Guiding Pills.”

Ling Han laughed loudly, waved his hand, and said, “It’s fine. Here, I’ll give you three more pills. You can take them after you’ve cultivated the level of One Meridian to the extreme.”

“Young Master…” Huan Xue was extremely excited. Even a proud prodigy like Li Changdan could only obtain one Meridian Guiding Fruit every two years.

And what about her?

She had already obtained six Meridian Guiding Pills in total.

Meridian Guiding Pills were much more precious than Meridian Guiding Fruits.

She was extremely moved, and really wanted to give her heart and soul to Ling Han.

“Since you’ve already sensed your meridians, report to the sect. From now on, you can become an official disciple of the sect,” Ling Han said in a low voice.

In this era, there were very few cultivators who could cultivate, so every one of them was very precious. As long as one could become a cultivator, their status would improve by leaps and bounds.

A beauty like Huan Xue could be bought with just one jade seed. However, if it was a cultivator, one might need 10 jade seeds just to hire them. The difference was like heaven and earth.

Plop! Huan Xue immediately knelt down and kowtowed continuously. “Young Master, Huan Xue will follow you for the rest of my life! I can’t repay your kindness even if I die a hundred times!”

There was no one in the world who treated her better than Ling Han. Furthermore, Ling Han had never asked for anything. This was what truly made her completely loyal to Ling Han.

She made up her mind. No matter what happened, she would always be Ling Han’s maid.

Ling Han smiled, and didn’t force her. He had once been an ultimate elite, so he naturally had a mentality that belonged to an ultimate elite. Since Huan Xue insisted, he naturally wouldn’t try to persuade her otherwise. What did this have to do with him?

After some thought, he decided to take responsibility since he had decided to nurture this maid.

Ling Han gave Huan Xue a Spirit Gathering Formation, and taught her how to use it.

This was very simple. She didn’t need any knowledge of formations. She just needed to set up the formation foundations and have enough jade seeds.

Huan Xue was naturally moved to tears again. Her tears flowed uncontrollably. There was only one thought in her mind—if Ling Han was in danger, she was willing to take his place.

Ling Han did not lack jade seeds for the time being, and he had also refined so many Meridian Guiding Pills. This was enough to trade for a large number of jade seeds, which would support his cultivation for a very long time.

He focused his attention on the Demonic Monkey Fists.

Every time he practiced this fist technique, he would gain a new appreciation. It was as if its power was limitless.

‘Brother Monkey said that he obtained this from a bloodline inheritance. Then, what kind of great elite had appeared among his ancestors?’ Ling Han thought to himself. The prerequisite for a bloodline inheritance was that the bloodline had once produced an extremely impressive figure. Only then could it fundamentally affect the bloodline.

‘Before this era, there was a martial arts civilization, but it disappeared for some reason.

‘In that case, Brother Monkey’s ancestors must have been from that era.

‘What a pity. Brother Monkey must know a lot about that era. He just doesn’t want to tell me.

‘That’s true. I’m too weak now. It’s not good for me to know some things.’

Ding dong, the doorbell rang.

Huan Xue hurriedly went to open the door. After a while, she led a young man over.

“Junior Brother Ling!” This young man smiled at Ling Han, and then handed over an invitation. “In a few days’ time, it will be Junior Sister He Miaoyin’s 18th birthday, and we’ll also celebrate the fact that Junior Sister He has broken through to Six Meridians as well. Junior Brother Ling is specially invited to attend.”
