Chapter 3421: Two-Star Spirit Tool

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

You dare to look down on me?

The Five Inscriptions elite snorted, and threw another punch at Ling Han. There was no change at all, and he was simply using speed and power to win.

In theory, as long as one’s speed was fast to the extreme, and power was strong to the extreme, there was indeed no need for any kind of technique. With a single punch, no one would be able to dodge or withstand it.

Unfortunately, his opponent was Ling Han.

Ling Han smiled and replied with a punch of his own.

Peng!

Their power collided, and the Five Inscriptions elite was instantly sent flying backward.

Ling Han’s raw power was naturally inferior to a Five Inscriptions elite, but he used overlapping layers of power and Frequency Attack, which allowed him to firmly gain the upper hand.

Being invincible even with a gap of a major tier in cultivation level was no joke. The Five Inscriptions elite slammed heavily into the palace wall. He looked at Ling Han, who was standing proudly, and felt a sense of anger and embarrassment.

He was actually outmatched?

“Obediently lie down!” Ling Han shouted lightly. The murderous aura fused with his spiritual power surged over, and instantly, the Five Inscriptions elite was scared stiff, his face covered with cold sweat.

This was really a fast-growing rookie. His willpower was too weak. If it was an Inscription Tier elite that had climbed up step by step with his own effort, he was sure that even if he would be affected, he wouldn’t be in such a miserable state.

After all, Ling Han was only an Extreme Bone Tier elite.

Ling Han shook his head. This was the consequence of taking a shortcut. However, he was originally just an ordinary person, yet now possessed the strength of an Inscription Tier elite. This could be considered reaching the heavens in a single step, and being comparable to the Four Great Generals and the others.

He withdrew his thoughts, and couldn’t be bothered to target this guy who was too lucky and arrogant. He searched around in the palace, and soon discovered something of value.

It was a sword that had been stabbed into a pillar, and was about six meters off

the ground.

Previously, the reason why the two sides were fighting so fiercely was probably because of this sword.

Ling Han leaped up, grabbed the sword hilt, and pulled it out with all his might.

Cold light trembled wildly. This sword had already been drawn, and there were veined patterns on it. It was very ancient.

The Five Inscriptions elite had already come back to his senses. When he saw the sword in Ling Han’s hand, he couldn’t help but feel envious. This sword should have been his.

Ling Han smiled calmly, and said, “Though you have the cultivation level of Five Inscriptions, you can only be considered a rookie in the cultivation world. Remember, in this world, the weak are prey to the strong. If you don’t have enough abilities, don’t hope for gains that you are not worthy of. Otherwise, you will only be harming yourself.

This was really a well-meant warning. If it was another person, it was highly possible that they would have already killed him.

“Go on.” Ling Han waved him off.

The Five Inscriptions elite gritted his teeth, turned and left.

Ling Han didn’t know if this person bore a grudge against him, and would still cause trouble for him in the future. He didn’t care at all. How could it be that someone that he had defeated could defeat him?

“Father, this is a Two Star Spirit Tool,” Second Baby said after looking at it for a while.

“Above the Celestial Path?” Ling Han asked.

“En.” Second Baby nodded, “There is absolutely no one that would assess the grade of a Spirit Tool that is below the Celestial Path.”

Great, at present, there were a great many Spirit Tools that had been fought over desperately, and in the civilization of the last era, they were actually trash that did not even have a rating.

Ling Han took out that broken sword and clashed it with this one. As a result, the broken sword broke again, and there was no doubt about it.

Second Baby glanced at it, and said, “This can just barely be considered

Mystery Realm Tier-level.”

Actually, Mystery Realm Tier was already quite powerful. Thus, even if it had been broken, the broken sword could still deliver a very terrifying Sword Qi. However, compared with the Celestial Tools above the Celestial Path, this was extremely weak.

Ling Han tried to activate this Spirit Tool. Weng, there was a faint light flickering on it. He slashed out with his sword, and instantly, Sword Qi swept out, turning into a roaring blood wolf that crashed towards the wall.

Pu, the Sword Qi crashed into the wall, leaving behind a shallow mark. Ling Han tried to fully awaken this Tool, but discovered that even if he poured all his power into it, it was useless. It was like pouring a cup of water on a burning cart of firewood; the gap was too wide.

It was very simple. His cultivation level was too low.

From this aspect, there was actually not much difference between this celestial weapon and the broken sword at present. In any case, he could not unleash its full might.

Ling Han looked left and right, and was very satisfied. This sword could accompany him all the way to the second stage of the Celestial Path.

“Put down your sword,” a calm voice rang out from behind Ling Han.

Yi, previously, someone told him to put down the Heavenly Pattern Jade, and this time, someone told him to put down his sword. Who had he offended?

Ling Han turned around, only to see nine people walking into the palace.

He had a slight impression of eight of them, and they were the ones who had exchanged blows with the lucky man who had attained Five Inscriptions. They had fled in a sorry state just then, and it was clear that they had asked for help.

This ninth person was actually quite young. He looked to be in his late twenties, dressed in black robes, exuding an extraordinary bearing.

“Yi, it’s not him.” Among the eight people from before, someone immediately shook his head.

“It really isn’t him.”

“However, the sword is still here.”

The eight of them all spoke at once.

The young man in black glanced at Ling Han again, and said, “Since you are not that person, leave your sword here, and I can spare your life.

Ling Han cracked a smile, “It seems like I should be thanking you?” The young man in black also smiled, “Indeed, I am a very amicable person. But if you don’t know what’s good for you, I will also become very not amicable.” “I would really like to take a look then,” Ling Han said.

“How dare you, do you know who our Young Master Gao is?” Among the group of eight, someone immediately rebuked Ling Han.

“If our Young Master Gao comes out, even Hong Tianbu can only stand by the sidelines,” another person said.

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh in spite of himself. What boastful words. Though there would be a battle between him and Hong Tianbu sooner or later, he still admired Hong Tianbu’s strength quite a bit. In a battle of equal cultivation levels, Ling Han was confident that he could win, but if there was a gap of a major tier between him and Hong Tianbu, his chances of winning would be very, very small.

In truth, if this kind of thought was known to others, there would definitely be a great many people saying that Ling Han was boasting shamelessly. That was Hong Tianbu, who was known as the freak that could suppress the heavens.

Not only did he think that he could defeat him at the same cultivation level, but he even had a slight chance of winning even though there was a difference of cultivation level of a major tier between them?

Hehe.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “Since he is so powerful, then I definitely have to take a look.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The black-robed young man looked at Ling Han for a while. After a while, he gave an ‘oh’, and asked, “You are Ling Han, right?”

“En?” Ling Han squinted his eyes.

“I’ve heard of you before. You’re known as the second Hong Tianbu,” Young Master Gao said with a shake of his head. “You’re nothing but a bunch of frogs at the bottom of a well. You’ve never seen any prodigy before, so you dare to arrogantly declare yourselves a freak who suppresses the heavens.”

“All right, I will let you know what a true freak is!

He took a step, and his foot landed on the ground. Instantly, the whole ground seemed to tremble. A frightening aura surged out of his body, and there was light surging in his body, as if there was some kind of treasure hidden within. An Inscription Tier inscribed the patterns of great dao on the organs inside his body..
