3122 Being humiliated instead

Ling Han naturally did not take it to heart. He had obtained a formation foundation, and was in a very good mood. As he whistled, he continued to search for other formation foundations.

After dozens of steps, he entered the fog-shrouded area again.

Ling Han slowed down. He studied it carefully. This fog had a strange power. He was clearly walking in a straight line, but as he walked, he actually circled back to the original spot.

It wasn’t that there was an overlap in space, but that his divine sense had unknowingly been affected.

‘If my divine sense is incomparably tenacious, this formation will definitely not be able to interfere with me. At most, it’ll just be a fog covering my eyes,’ Ling Han concluded. ‘Interesting, interesting.’

As he made a careful assessment, he soon found another spot to start digging.

He had experience this time, so he was naturally determined. After digging for about seven feet, he found the second formation foundations. After taking it away, the fog within a radius of 90 meters instantly dispersed.

Ding, ding, ding. He knocked on the two formation foundations, producing a crisp sound.

‘This is metal from the ancient era. It doesn’t exist in the modern world.

‘But why do I have a feeling that this is even sturdier than Earth Element Iron?’

Unfortunately, he didn’t have a sword with him. Otherwise, he could have used it to slash the item and see which one was sturdier.

Just as he was about to leave, he saw someone rushing toward him.

Rui Yuanliang.

Enemies were really bound to meet on a narrow road.

Rui Yuanliang had already neared him, and said balefully, “Enemies are really bound to meet on a narrow road.”

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “Do you know that stealing someone’s lines is a very bad behavior?”

Rui Yuanliang humphed. “You don’t know how to repent even on the brink of death. How pathetic!”

Ling Han cracked a smile, and said, “I heard that you were hung and beaten up. I wonder if your injuries have healed?”

“You…” Rui Yuanliang almost went mad with anger. Wasn’t this rubbing his nose in it? Besides, this was all Ling Han’s fault.

His chest heaved up and down a few times before he forcefully suppressed his anger, and said, “Go ahead and talk. When I trample you under my feet, you’ll regret angering me.”

Ling Han spread his hands, and said, “It seems like you and those people surnamed Tan were the ones who framed me, and you ended up humiliating yourself instead, right? Why are you blaming me now?”

“You still dare to say it!!” Rui Yuanliang roared as he charged over.

This really made him feel sullen. He had given Ling Han a Meridian Guiding Pill for nothing, while he himself had been hung at the gate and gotten whipped. He had completely lost face.

He wanted to kill someone.

Boom! A fist flew over, bringing with it a terrifying gale.

However, Rui Yuanliang revealed a shocked expression. He naturally understood the approximate level of his strength when he attacked.

3500 kg.

This was the power of one whose cultivation level had reached the peak of Five Meridians.

It was very normal. Ling Han’s cultivation was definitely weaker than his, so the great formation would lower his cultivation. However, because the disparity was too great, he was still one Meridian higher than Ling Han.

What did that mean?

Ling Han’s cultivation level should be at Four Meridians.

Hiss, a fellow who had been in the sect for less than two months had actually cultivated to Four Meridians?

However, with so many Meridian Guiding Pills in Ling Han’s possession, in addition to the Spirit Gathering Formation, it was not entirely impossible for him to reach Four Meridians in two months.

Rui Yuanliang was mad with jealousy. He had only eaten three Meridian Guiding Fruits. Compared to Ling Han, how wide was this gap?

Biased. Sun Jianfang was really too biased!

In that case, Rui Yuanliang would ruthlessly humiliate this fellow and make him lose all face. He would find an opportunity to kill him in the future.

In just an instant, so many thoughts crossed Rui Yuanliang’s mind.

Ling Han smiled faintly. The people of the Ancient Dao Sect basically cultivated the Four Directional Fists, and it was a simplified version at that. In front of him, it was simply full of flaws. Even if he didn’t cultivate the Demonic Monkey Fists, with his insight as an ultimate elite, he could easily pick out more than 10 of such flaws.

What he had lost was just power.

Ling Han kicked out. Peng!

His kick arrived first, and landed on Rui Yuanliang’s chest. Under the powerful impact, Rui Yuanliang was instantly kicked many meters up high before he fell hard on the ground.

Rui Yuanliang groaned and laid on the ground, unable to recover. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

This kick was really too hurtful.

He was about to get up, but just as he raised his head, he felt a foot step on his cheek and press him further to the ground.

It was naturally Ling Han’s.

He was so angry that he wanted to vomit blood. He was clearly the one who had suddenly discovered Ling Han and wanted to come over to take revenge, so how could he be thrashed by Ling Han instead?

This didn’t make sense.

How could the other party have seen through the flaw in his punch? Furthermore, his power was so great. Otherwise, he definitely wouldn’t have felt so terrible from just taking a kick.

“Did it feel good?” Ling Han asked with a smile.

Rui Yuanliang only wanted to kill, but he was being stepped on by Ling Han. What else could he do other than glare at him?

He was extremely humiliated. Although he was a live-in son-in-law and was often laughed at behind his back, who wouldn’t respectfully call him Young Master Rui in front of him?

How humiliating.

“Hehe.” Ling Han chuckled, and began to peel off Rui Yuanliang’s clothes too.

“Wh-what are you trying to do?” Rui Yuanliang asked in shock. It was indeed painful previously, and it made him feel ashamed. However, compared to taking off his pants, it had become a small matter.

“***!” Ling Han said viciously.

Rui Yuanliang almost fainted from fright. How could he have thought that Ling Han actually had such a fetish?

This great formation prohibited killing, but there didn’t seem to be anything forbidden about being ***, right?

He was scared to death. If he was really ***, would the Qi Clan still acknowledge him as their son-in-law?

He was finally afraid, and screamed repeatedly, “No…”

Ling Han snickered. He paid no attention to it, and continued to strip him.

Although Rui Yuanliang resisted desperately, how was he capable of resisting? Soon, he was stripped naked.

“No!!!” Rui Yuanliang screamed miserably like Yang Fei.

This was the effect that Ling Han wanted.

Peng! He threw a punch at Rui Yuanliang’s head.

At this moment, the great formation immediately took effect, and sent Rui Yuanliang out.

Thus, the people outside the formation were fortunate enough to see another naked man.

“That’s Rui Yuanliang!”

“Look at how miserable he looks. Could it be that he was *** too?”

“Heavens, could it be that there’s a pervert in the sect?”

Everyone only felt a sense of panic, and their a*ses faintly hurt at the thought.

“It’s over. Rui Yuanliang has embarrassed himself in public like this. I reckon that the Qi Clan will never want this son-in-law again.”

“That’s for sure. That young lady from the Qi Clan is famous for being… hehe, flirtatious. She could simply go with another man. How could she accept a husband who had bared his buttocks in public?”

“Senior Brother Rui is really spectacular in some aspects. No wonder he charmed Miss Qi.”

Rui Yuanliang heard all of this, and his hands couldn’t help but clench tightly. Although Ling Han didn’t kill him, and didn’t even severely injure him, he knew that all that he possessed had already been destroyed by Ling Han.

He swore in his heart that no matter what price he had to pay, he would kill Ling Han.

Then, he finally shed tears of humiliation.
