Chapter 1970: Extreme Shamelessness

Fei Yun felt extremely smug at this moment. He felt as if he had exacted revenge for everything.

Not long ago, Ling Han had used an iron spear to pierce his a*s, humiliating him before everyone. Now, he had snatched one of Ling Han’s precious treasures before everyone, viciously returning the favor.

This was amazing, far too amazing!

Hu Niu stood still and silently glared at Fei Yun. She was like an infuriated lioness, with her long black hair billowing in the air and flames sparking from her eyes.

Boom!

There was the sound of crashing waves as a colossal Roc soared out from behind her. With a flap of its wings and a swish of its tails, a symbol of the great dao materialized in the air. It was as if this symbol could suppress the heavens.

She was truly enraged at this moment. She was going to kill this despicable person at all costs.

He was far too deplorable, far too despicable, and far too shameless!

However, Fei Yun didn’t pay any heed to her. He was slightly weaker than Hu Niu, yet his battle prowess still ranked within the top 10. Thus, he wouldn’t be much weaker than her. At the very least, he could hold his own without being defeated too quickly.

“This is... this is... forged from Devouring Metal!” he exclaimed in excitement as he examined the Divine Demon Sword.

As long as it had enough Godly metal to devour, Devouring Metal would eventually evolve into Divine Metal. In fact, there were even rumors that the limit of Devouring Metal wasn’t simply Divine Metal. As long as it had enough Divine Metal to devour, it could even continue to evolve!

Of course, Divine Metal was extremely rare and valuable, so much so that even Celestial Kings would drool over them. As such, who would feed it Divine Metal?

In any case, it was without a doubt that the Divine Demon Sword could evolve to become a Celestial Tool.

‘I’ve struck it rich, I’ve truly struck it rich!’

Fei Yun roared with laughter. He felt extremely delighted, especially since he had snatched this Celestial Tool from an enemy’s hands. He was beside himself with joy.

“What? Devouring Metal?!” The other monarch tiers from the Wide Prosperity Heaven were also ecstatic upon hearing this. This was equivalent to obtaining a Celestial Tool!

No wonder Ling Han had killed that heaven soul monster with such ease. As it turned out, his weapon was a future Celestial Tool! Thus, it was naturally very powerful!

However, no one knew that this wasn’t because of the Divine Demon Sword. Of course, the Divine Demon Sword had indeed contributed greatly in piercing through the toad’s defenses. It was because of this that the juice of the poisonous fruit could enter the toad’s body.

In their eyes, however, it was the mighty power of the Divine Demon Sword that had killed the heaven soul monster.

They definitely had to fight for this weapon!

“Fei Yun, hand the sword over!”

“That’s right, hand it over! It belongs to our Wide Prosperity Heaven!”

“You can’t hog it for yourself!”

Everyone shouted for Fei Yun to hand the sword over. However, how could he? He would rather become the public enemy than hand the sword over.

“You all... deserve to die!” Hu Niu growled in a low voice. Her fury had already reached an extreme, and an indescribable aura started to erupt from her body. This was an aura that could crush all matter.

Fei Yun and the others were astonished upon seeing this. At this moment, Hu Niu reminded them of the freak, Yi. Even though there were so many of them, they still couldn’t help but feel a cold chill running down their spines. It was as if they had no chance of victory.

Ling Han had already recovered some of his energy, so he stood up, and said in a calm voice, “Do you people know? Greed can lead to one’s death.”

“Heh.” Everyone chuckled coldly upon hearing this. Was Ling Han joking? Following his logic, no one should fight for rare treasures? They should all stay at home and do nothing?

“If you insist on seeking death, then you only have yourself to blame,” Ling Han said. He lifted his finger slightly.

Whoosh!

There was a flash of light as the Divine Demon Sword suddenly started to move by itself, stabbing toward Fei Yun and the others.

Fei Yun was extremely startled by this. Only at this moment did he realize that this was still Ling Han’s weapon. Even though it had left the latter’s hands, the martial intent within it still hadn’t been erased yet. Thus, it could still be manipulated by Ling Han.

Fei Yun had been far too excited just then. This was his mortal enemy’s treasure, and it was more so forged from Devouring Metal. Thus, he had been over the moon with excitement, so much so that he had forgotten the basics. For example, erasing the martial intent from the weapon and replacing it with his own.

Of course, whether or not he could erase it was another matter altogether.

A burst of sword light slashed over, and Fei Yun hurriedly grabbed the hilt of the sword in an attempt to parry. After blocking this strike, he would immediately erase Ling Han’s martial intent and replace it with his own. He would assert his ownership over this sword.

However, as the burst of sword light slashed over, numerous symbols of the great dao started to materialize and pulsate, triggering a resonance with heaven and earth. This was an overwhelming power. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Even though Fei Yun had successfully deflected the attack and stopped it from striking his weak points, he had ultimately failed from blocking the attack completely. First of all, the attack from the Divine Demon Sword had been far too sudden, completely catching him off guard. Second of all, its power had been far too overwhelming. Thus, the attack still left a gash on his leg.

“Detestable!” Fei Yun roared in anger. This was extreme joy begetting sorrow. He hadn’t imagined that he would suffer a surprise attack from Ling Han.

He humphed, and said, “This sword is already in my hands, yet you still want to snatch it back? In your dreams!”

Even Celestial Kings would be enticed by such a precious treasure. Thus, how could he hand it over?

Ling Han shook his head upon hearing this. After being poisoned by the Red Spotted Green Bamboo, even treatment at the first possible moment might not save the victim. This was not to mention that Fei Yun was still blabbering on and taunting Ling Han.

Ling Han naturally wouldn’t warn him. He said in a calm voice, “The heavens want to harvest your life, so no one can prevent this from happening!”

“Absolute nonsense! I...” Fei Yun was just about to chide Ling Han, yet he suddenly felt that something was off. An indescribable power suddenly started to wreak havoc inside him, directly surging toward his divine sense. It was brimming with formidable corrosive power.

“You!” He pointed at Ling Han, and he was just about to say something else. However, he suddenly stopped speaking, and his entire body started to fall. Yet, before he could hit the ground, his body had already dissolved into liquid. Both his body and divine sense were annihilated.

‘What?!’

Everyone’s hair stood on ends. Fei Yun had only suffered a gash to his leg, and this wasn’t even a deep gash. In fact, it could only be considered as a scrape. Yet, this had actually killed him, a fifth severance monarch tier!

This was too terrifying.

With a wave of Ling Han’s right hand, the Divine Demon Sword immediately flew back to its owner.

Because Fei Yun’s death had been far too quick and eerie, not a single person dared to intercept the Divine Demon Sword. They were afraid that they might follow in Fei Yun’s miserable footsteps. They could only look on as the Divine Demon Sword returned to Ling Han’s hands.

Pa!

Ling Han caught the Divine Demon Sword and placed it into the Black Tower. He then said in a calm voice, “Fine, since you people want to disband the alliance, come over and fight!”

He still had yet to fully recover, yet his voice was filled with confidence and a domineering aura. This fired up the prodigies from the Calm Peace Heaven.

They would do battle! What was there to be afraid of?

“Come on, battle us!”

“See how we beat you bastards to death!”

The prodigies from the Calm Peace Heaven all roared in fury. This was largely because some prodigies from the Wide Prosperity Heaven were far too despicable. Not only had they been ungrateful toward Ling Han, but they had even fought over his weapon. This caused a flame of anger to burn in their chests.

Now, Ling Han’s words had comprehensively lit the fuse to their anger, causing them to unleash it with ferocity.

“Forget about it. We’re all members of the Celestial Realm, and... we still have a common enemy to fight. It’s best that we don’t engage in internal conflict and ruin the harmony,” Shu Yarong said.

“Ruin the harmony?” Ye Linfeng said in a baleful voice. “Celestial Maiden Shu, you also saw just then. Fei Yun died a miserable death right before our very eyes. Can we still coexist peacefully with the Calm Peace Heaven?”

“That’s right! Prodigies from the Wide Prosperity Heaven can’t die for nothing!”

“Moreover, that brat clearly possessed the ability to kill that monster, yet he purposefully hid his strength at the start. His actions led to the death of many prodigies from the Wide Prosperity Heaven! His intentions are absolutely wicked”

These people were truly resorting to arguments of twisted logic.

Shu Yarong frowned upon hearing this. She had a keen eye for the overall situation, yet there were some things that she couldn’t say. Thus, she was at a loss for how to persuade them.
