Chapter 2122: Do not trouble yourself on entertaining me

Go to the Liu Clan?

‘Why are you going to the Liu Clan? Haven’t you vented enough of your anger? Are you planning to commit mass killing at the Liu Clan?’

Ling Han glared. “If I tell you to lead the way, lead the way. Why are you spouting so much nonsense? Never mind.” He directly stretched out his hand, and lifted that Seventh Brother who was the leader. Then, he flicked out several streaks of energy, crippling the cultivation level of all the others.

This was the punishment that he had sentenced them to for disregarding human life.

Xiu, using Regulations of Space, his figure flashed and then reappeared, and he had already left millions and millions of miles behind him.

He had obtained the Spiritual Void Glass, and this Source Power of heaven and earth could allow him to possess innumerable doppelgangers in the vicinity of his body, as if countless mirrors had been placed. There would be thousands of images, and he could switch with any doppelganger he liked.

In battle, this was incredibly practical. With millions of doppelgangers, who would be able to catch any trace of his real self, and deliver a fatal strike? On the other hand, he could attack through whichever doppelganger he liked, and there was practically no gap in his attacks.

And added with a slight change, this could also be used in his movement technique.

True body, manifested body, true body, manifested body… Continuously switching from one to the other, he could practically advance a great distance without wasting any time every time a switch was made, being even faster than lightning.

‘If I added the Regulations of Lightning into the equation, could I become even faster?’ As Ling Han journeyed, he stroked his chin in thought.

A normal person would have to travel for three years to complete the journey from this place to Great Clouds City, but to Ling Han, it was only a matter of two to three steps. He had not even finished a thought, and a majestic great city emerged before him.

He stopped, and released his grip.

“Wa!” Seventh Brother immediately threw up, feeling like all his organs had been flipped and overturned to the point that they were about to rip out of his stomach.

He was only in the Genesis Tier, so how could his body sustain this kind of spatial movement?

Yet Ling Han did not feel the slightest sympathy. A person like him who disregarded human life deserved it.

He walked forwards, a thread of energy turning into a rope that bound Seventh Brother, dragging him with him.

“Halt!” WHen they arrived outside the city gates, Ling Han was stopped by the guards. “Entrance fee.”

“S-Seventh Brother!” One of the guards saw Seventh Brother who was being towed around by Ling Han, and immediately got a shock.

“What, Seventh Brother?!” Another guard looked towards Seventh Brother, his eyes flickering slightly.

The Liu Clan was a noble clan of Great Clouds City, and so was the Kong Clan. These two clans had joint control of Great Clouds City, and that applied to the entrance fee for entering the city. The clans were in charge of two city gates, respectively, and this place was the city gate that was under the control of the Liu Clan.

However, a great conflict had recently erupted between the Liu Clan and Kong Clan, and the Kong Clan was clearly enjoying the upper hand. It seemed like not only was the Liu Clan going to be defeated, it was even possible that they would completely withdraw from Great Clouds City.

Thus, these guards that were under the jurisdiction of the Liu Clan naturally had other thoughts. Should they change sides to the Kong Clan soon?

Then, they only had to apprehend Seventh Brother, and if they delivered him to the Kong Clan, then even if they could not get a great reward, it would be enough as a show of their stand.

At the very least, Seventh Brother was also a centurion of the Liu Clan’s troops[1].

However, they immediately discovered something off. That was because they saw that Seventh Brother seemed to be tied by an invisible rope. When Ling Han moved, he would move as well, like he was a dead pig being dragged around.

Hiss, they could not trifle with him.

They all shook their heads. To say nothing of snatching the hostage from Ling Han’s hands, they did not even collect city entrance fees from him, respectfully escorting Ling Han into the city.

After being guards for so many years, they had also acquired a considerable insight. There were some people that could not be trifled with.

Ling Han naturally did not object, and asked Seventh Brother, “Which direction?”

“There.” Seventh Brother had completely lost all temper, and pointed in a direction.

Ling Han used the Regulations of Space, and rapidly advanced.

After about 15 minutes, he stopped.

A town had appeared ahead—in a small world, this could completely be considered a massive city, but in the Celestial Realm, this was only a small town.

They had arrived at the Liu Clan.

However, there was a huge army surrounding the small town, and catapults were presently shooting out massive rocks that flew and blasted in the direction of the small town.

Tong!

The massive rocks had not even landed when a shield of light appeared above the small town and blocked them, and after every crash, the shield of light would tremble as multiple seals flickered.

Clearly, the Liu Clan was protected by a defense formation, and the Kong Clan was using the most primitive method to unravel their defenses—exhausting all the energy of the formation.

Ling Han only swept a passing glance and immediately understood. This formation was powered by human power, and at this moment, there were several hundred people that were inserting their Origin Power into this formation. A great many people had already paled, and they could not last much longer.

Sight indeed could not take a turn, but divine sense was like mercury being poured onto the ground, and could be everywhere.

Seventh Brother was dumbfounded in shock. He had just left Liu Clan three days ago, but in the blink of an eye, he had returned once more. Just how powerful was this man?

“Who are you?” In the outer circle of the town, a member of the Kong Clan discovered Ling Han, and immediately flew over in a leap, calling out towards him in loud rebuke.

“Someone here to watch the show. No need to trouble yourself to entertain me,” Ling Han said with a smile, not even stopping in his advance.

“Entertain your head!” Someone was more quick-tempered, and immediately pounced over, waving his saber at Ling Han.

Sigh!

Seventh Brother released a soundless sigh, as if he could already see how this person would end.

As expected, when the saber slashed onto Ling Han’s body with a bang, not only had it not managed to pierce through Ling Han’s defense, the force ricocheted back towards the attacker at an extraordinarily fast speed. With a?pu, the latter’s head was directly smashed into bits.

Ling Han did not feel any sympathy. If this person had been more merciful, and had not used his full force, he should have been able to easily disperse this blow that had bounced back towards him.

It was his own decision to leave no way out for others, which also announced his own death sentence.

“How dare you!”

“An elite!”

The members of the Kong Clan all exclaimed in shock, and after a momentary commotion, a person strode out. His face was square, and looked very dignified.

This was a Severing Mundane Tier, and he was only a third severance. However, everyone had a different destiny depending on their different origins. Some Severing Mundane Tiers could only lower themselves to becoming thieves and gangsters, while there would be some that would be posing around, putting on airs greater than even Ascending Origin Tier elites.

“Sir, the destruction of the Liu Clan is already a foregone conclusion, so why do you have to touch this pool of troubled water?” he asked calmly, his tone even. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Only a Genesis Tier had died, which naturally could not cause any stir of emotion in him.

The other party had to be a Severing Mundane Tier elite. If he was a fourth severance, and the Liu Clan had two such elites, the matter would not be settled easily.

Ling Han broke into a smile. “I already said that you do not have to trouble yourself to entertain me. That’s it.” He waved a hand dismissively, and continued onwards.

“Hehe, then let me first take a measure of you, sir!” That third severance grand elder moved, and grabbed at Ling Han’s shoulder.

If he could easily succeed, then he would kill Ling Han with the next blow.

To dare to interfere in the matters of the Kong Clan, the newcomer had to be tired of living!

And if the other’s strength was very powerful, no weaker than the elder’s, the latter would then advise the former to leave.

After all, it was a very troublesome matter to be targeted by a Severing Mundane grand elder. Unless he had the certainty that he could kill him definitely, he could not be easily offended. The Kong Clan was a big household, with innumerable clan members, and how many of them had attained Severing Mundane Tier?

Ling Han seemed to have completely failed to sense the approach of this blow. He did not stop moving, or even turn his head at all.

“You are seeking death!” That third severance grand elder’s killing intent instantly blazed. His hand was already less than an inch away from Ling Han’s back. He had absolute certainty that he could kill Ling Han.

‘Just die then!’

Without the slightest hesitation, he clawed out at Ling Han’s back.

“Ah…” A pained cry rang out.

[1] The rank is directly translated to centurion, which is an ancient military rank. It literally means that he is in charge of a troop of 100 men.
