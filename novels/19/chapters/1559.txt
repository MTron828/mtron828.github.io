1560 Massive waves

Ling Han stared blankly, and asked, “What is that?”

“Chaos Source Rock,” Small Tower replied.

It was that thing again.

Ling Han nodded, and said, “I will get it for you if I get the chance.”

“Not just a chance, but it is an absolute must for you to get it!” Small Tower declared solemnly. “This Chaos Source Rock is extremely large. I can sense the waves of Source Power from it even from so far away. If I can extract the power contained within, it would be greatly beneficial to my recovery.”

Ling Han thought for a moment, and asked, “Beneficial to what extent?”

“You can get one chance for a power boost,” Small Tower said calmly.

Ling Han’s eyes lit up. “How strong would it be?”

“You can defeat all below the Celestial King Tier!”

Gasp!

Ling Han revealed an expression of shock. Though he did not know in what level Celestial Kings were considered to be in the Celestial Realm, but to be able to lay claim to the name of Celestial King meant they could be considered kings in the Celestial Realm. If they were not at the top level, who would dare use this name?

“Right, I will definitely get it for you!” He made his decision. With this power boost, he would be able to sweep aside all opposition in one Forbidden Land—if all the Saints of the Forbidden Land had left, he would be able to conquer it completely.

“You are indeed thinking of nothing but personal gain, snob!” Small Tower retorted in disdain.

Ling Han was speechless. Would this proud tower be unable to sleep easy if it did not mock him at least once a day?

“Where is it?” he asked. He had long since learnt to ignore Small Tower’s poisonous tongue.

“At the top of the mountain in the middle of the ocean.”

Ling Han stared into the distance. The mountain peak that was initially only a few hundred meters tall had practically pierced through the clouds in this place. Even if he was an endlessly long distance from it, he could still vaguely see its outline.

“Despicable guy, we’re leaving!” Wu Jue’s voice rang out.

Ling Han looked over. Mo Li was already leading the group to cross the ocean. Not just them; the others were also crossing the ocean. There were 10 in each group, and they all drew out their precious tools that were capable of flight. There were ships, lotus flower stages, and bowls, but they were all flying in midair. Not one of them was travelling in the water.

He followed suit. With a leap, he had already arrived on the small boat that Mo Li was steering. This was a lone raft, and looked like it could only accommodate about 10-odd people. Whilst it was rapidly travelling, sharp winds blasted at them, causing them to feel as if their skin was being sliced by sharp knives.

Thankfully, as long as they activated their Origin Power as defense, this did not pose much of a threat. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Ling Han was uncaring. His physique was too strong, so even when the strong winds hit him, they were not the slightest bit of threat to him.

The flying raft pierced through the air, and the disciples and juniors of the 17 Demon Masters all formed a row. None stood in front of the others.

This seemed very calm and peaceful. Though the ocean was overwhelmingly huge, they would probably be able to reach the other side in about a few months’ time. Why was it said that a great many people did not even manage to cross the ocean?

A few hours soon passed. Though there would be occasionally a few waves rolling out in the ocean, it was still considerably peaceful.

“Hmm?”

Suddenly, Ling Han’s eyes snapped open. He stood up. He saw that there was a white line in the distance that was rapidly approaching them, and it was at an extraordinarily rapid pace at that.

“Despicable guy, what are you making a fuss for?” Wu Jue immediately demanded. He simply did not like Ling Han.

“A wave is here!” Yet Mo Li’s expression was one of utmost seriousness. “Make a formation, let’s withstand it together!”

Aside from Ling Han and Wu Jue, the others all looked solemn. It was clear that they had long since known what that was.

Ling Han sighed. Though he had been pulled in, he was still completely in the dark. He had absolutely no idea what the exact situation was in this Ocean Dragon Mountain Mystery Realm. At present, he only knew that there was a Chaos Source Rock. It was very big, and could be used to recover the Black Tower, allowing him to have a chance for a power boost, and being able to easily kill many great elites even from the Celestial Realm.

He did not dare be careless, either. If one dared relax his guard in a Mystery Realm, that was just courting death.

The white line was coming closer and closer. Ling Han could already clearly see that it was indeed a wave, but it was too frightening. It was 3,000 meters tall, and it was like a whole mountain was about to slam into them.

“Can’t we fly the flying raft above 3,000 meters?” he asked. It was not only them; the other flying Tools that the others were aboard did not rise up, either. Instead, they chose to confront the wave head-on.

“No!” Mo Li shook her head. “Above 3,000 meters, the strong winds are very frightening, and the precious Tool would immediately be destroyed.”

Ling Han nodded. He knew that there was definitely a reason that Mo Li and the others had done so; it was only that he did not know what that reason was.

Boom!

The massive wave was rolling out too quickly. In a mere instant, one could already hear a huge commotion. This was very inconceivable. It was clear that the massive wave was rolling out at a speed that had exceeded the full-speed dash of most Eternal River Tiers, yet the sound of it reached them first.

“Get ready!” Mo Li called out loudly. Everyone concentrated, and their power soared to the limit.

The massive wave slammed into them. Weng, the flying raft immediately released an ear-piercing noise. That was the sound of the material that was used to build the precious Tool currently sustaining a great pressure. Pa, pa, pa. Suddenly, three people were sent flying by the wave. Ling Han, being sharp-sighted and deft, forcibly pulled these three people back.

Peng, peng, peng. The flying raft sank into the wave’s “wall”. All of them were being struck by the wave. The defense of Origin Power of a large number of them was instantly obliterated. Then, their faces turned ashen as they coughed up copious amounts of blood.

However, though the wave’s wall was very thick, this wave was really rolling out too quickly. It was truly just the blink of the eye, and the wave had passed them.

Wu Jue and the others all slumped onto the ground. The little bottom was still fine, and did not sustain any injury. Ling Han had seen clearly that there was a flash of white light on this brat’s chest. It should’ve been a precious Tool that had activated and blocked the impact of the huge wave.

However, the others were not so lucky. A few of them broke some bones, and they were moaning there with pale faces.

“Oh no!” Mo Li’s expression was solemn. Her eternally wooden face was actually wearing a frown. “Our luck is not so good this time; we actually encountered the fiercest tides!”

“Then, I’m going back first. You guys go on ahead, work hard!” Wu Jue immediately declared. He still wanted to tempt the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden away from Ling Han’s side, yet did not know that she was presently together with Ling Han.

Mo Li humphed, and retorted, “The moment one enters this Mystery Realm, there is no way out. You can only wait for the three years to be up, and be naturally expelled from this Mystery Realm, so just give up the idea!”

“Ah!” Wu Jue slumped onto the ground, wanting to cry but having no tears.

Ling Han shook his head. He was really rendered speechless by this kid. Then, he asked Mo Li, “What’s going on with these waves?”

“In the past, the Demon Masters had come here, and deduced that there should have been a supreme great elite that had died in the ocean. Thus, it created waves in the ocean, and there are naturally shards of the Regulations that that great elite had grasped embedded within them. They possess frightening destructive power,” Mo Li said.

“Furthermore, we have just reached the ocean, so the power of the waves should be at their weakest, but based on my experience, the might of the waves now has already reached the level of travelling midway across the ocean in the past. This can be claimed to be one of the most frightening tides in history.”

When Chi Huangji and the others heard this, they were all very depressed. They had only managed to enter into this Ocean Dragon Mountain Mystery Realm with much difficulty, and to their great misfortune, they encountered a “year of calamity”. Whom could they voice the injustice to?

“Before the next wave hits, let’s quickly leave!” Mo Li thought for a moment. “Though the massive waves are frightening, the shards of Regulations of that great elite would also nurture natural treasures. The last time I entered, I saw a divine bamboo with nine segments. This time, it will probably be flowering and bearing fruit.”

It was not easy for bamboo to flower. Once it did, it meant that it was close to the end of its lifespan. At the conclusion of its life, a divine bamboo would pour all the essence that it had accumulated in its lifetime into the fruit that would be born after the flower bloomed.

This was a precious treasure, a Great Herb that even Demon Masters and Saints would be tempted by.
