Chapter 1919: The fifth severance!

In the mountains, Ling Han and the Empress were very far from each other as they prepared to greet the coming of the heavenly tribulation.

Thankfully, the Natural Peach Seals had taken effect, and concealed their destiny so that the violence of the heavenly tribulation suddenly declined to a weaker level. Though it had still far surpassed the heavenly tribulation for a normal fourth severance, and was in fact close to the heavenly tribulation for the Dividing Soul Tier, this was already within the capacity of tolerance for the both of them.

Though neither Ling Han nor the Empress were officially at the fifth severance, their strength was already close to Yang soul Tier.

Crack!

A sudden clap of thunder rang out, and hundreds of thousands meters long thunderbolts crashed down as if they intended to rip apart the heaven and earth itself.

Ling Han faced this calmly. Using the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, he shattered his Godly bones to accept being tempered by the heavenly tribulation. This had already become something that he would definitely do every time he endured a heavenly tribulation.

The Empress was not as much of a maniac as he was. She only formed nine doppelgangers, each and every one of them extremely graceful and exquisitely beautiful. With a wave of her delicate hand, they faced the most frightening and mightiest force in this world.

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

Ling Han was calm and carefree. His strength lay in his strong physique. Even if it was a Yang soul heavenly tribulation he was faced with now, with his present physique, he would only experience a few scrapes at most. If he had not taken the initiative to shatter his own Godly bones, he would’ve been completely capable of lying down, and enduring the heavenly tribulation without the slightest issue.

The Empress also did not have a very hard time. There were 10 of her to share the pressure. Though she did not have as easy a time as Ling Han, she did not look strained, either.

This was the benefit of the Natural Peach Seal, which was capable of fooling heaven and earth.

Ling Han couldn’t help but think that if there were enough Natural Peach Seals, the number of elites in this world would definitely increase a few times over.

This was not an exaggeration. Probably half among 100 people that endured the heavenly tribulation would die, and about half of those that survived would possibly suffer serious injury, and would not be able to advance to a higher cultivation level in their lifetime. At most, only about a quarter could possibly survive the heavenly tribulation.

“You’re overthinking things,” Small Tower piped up, its tone filled with pride.

“I don’t think I asked for your opinion.” Ling Han gritted his teeth. This Small Tower always liked to pour cold water on him. Just what good did doing that have for it?

Small Tower ignored him, and continued, “The first use of the Natural Peach Seal has the best effects, but just like continuously taking alchemical pills, the effects would weaken with each consequent use. Do you really think that heaven and earth can be deceived?”

Ling Han gave an oh—so that was the case.

“Even in great sects, the Natural Peach Seal is only used for the heavenly tribulation of the fifth severance. If one had to use the Natural Peach Seal in other heavenly tribulations, then this person would really be too weak. This would practically be a waste!” Small Tower declared with contempt.

“Though the Natural Peach Seal is formed from a Source Power of heaven and earth, and is capable of assimilating a cultivator to a certain extent so that heaven and earth would consider him as a part of it, and the might of the heavenly tribulation would naturally decrease sharply, it can succeed once, but not continuously. If one continued to use the Natural Peach Seal all the time, he would ultimately be seen through by heaven and earth. Then, all the might of heavenly tribulation from before would be compounded, and furthermore, it would increase more than 10 times over.”

“How could one possibly survive that?”

Ling Han was struck speechless, and complained uncontrollably. He was only sighing a bit, feeling slightly rueful. Why had Small Tower spouted a whole bunch? ‘Is it really appropriate for you to inject me with so much useless information?’

“I have a feeling that after you advance into the fifth severance, the ‘Black Tower’ will change greatly!” Small Tower’s tone suddenly changed—though it had always maintained the kind of tone that could drive one to die with fury, this time Ling Han could feel that there was a slight feeling of anticipation in its tone.

Coming from a Tool Spirit, this was a little inconceivable.

Both Ling Han and Small Tower had deliberately avoided the name “Tower of Three Realms”, and would not speak of it even while communicating through divine sense.

Ling Han faltered for a moment, and then asked, “Strange, I haven’t advanced into a new cultivation level, so why would there suddenly be change? And a great change at that.”

“The fifth severance, severing the heaven and earth, becoming your sole existence, you yourself are the heaven and earth, and you yourself are the universe!” Small Tower said slowly. This time, its tone had returned to normal. “Even a great many Celestial Kings were not able to attain the fifth severance. This is the true first step of advancing into the territory of supremacy.

“If you couldn’t attain the fifth severance, I would leave you when you advanced into the Dividing Soul Tier.

“That is because you would not be able to bear the mission that I have been bestowed with!”

This time, Small Tower was very direct with its words, and did not act secretive.

All of a sudden, Ling Han did not know what he felt.

Being with Small Tower for so many years, he was already accustomed to its existence. To suddenly hear that Small Tower would resolutely leave him, his feelings were complex.

Clearly, Small Tower had not truly accepted him as its master—in truth, Small Tower had never recognized him as its master.

From beginning to end, Small Tower had been constantly carrying out the will of the previous owner of the Black Tower, no, the owner of the Black Tower, and that was nurturing him. Its motive was very possibly to ensure that he was capable of dealing with a great danger that would come in the future. Even when it came to the right to know what it was, he could only gain it after advancing into the Celestial King Tier.

If you were incapable, then another would replace you!

Perhaps the fact that the Black Tower had appeared in the Lower Realm was because the Black Tower had abandoned the previous “choice”.

“Don’t let your imagination run wild,” Small Tower said. “From beginning to end, you have been the only heir of the Black Tower.”

“With you comforting me like this, I will only feel that you are doing it for show!” Ling Han said with a laugh. He had already recovered. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Whatever the case, the Black Tower had helped him countless times on his path of growth. It could be said that without the Black Tower, he might have attained massive achievements on the path of alchemy, but in cultivation, he would only be average or even less than that.

That was because he had not strengthened his foundations at all, and there had been absolutely no possibility that he could advance to a very high level.

Perhaps he would have already been refined by the Five Sects into a Realm Pill, and long since ceased to exist.

“Then just let me anticipate the great change of the Black Tower!” Ling Han restructured his Godly bones. Though the heavenly tribulation had not passed yet, the tempering of his Godly bones was already complete. His eyes shone extraordinarily bright, his right hand raised high.

He was going to deliver the fifth severance now.

Shua, his right hand descended. It was obviously just a strike at empty air, but when this slash fell, a strange light appeared, and then lit up the whole heaven and earth.

A roar of fury rang out through the skies and the earth, and it could not be discerned whether it came from human or beast, yet it caused one’s heart and spirit to tremble.

Clang, when the next bolt of lightning descended, its might had clearly increased considerably. It took the form of a divine spear, intending to erase Ling Han forcefully.

Under the fifth severance, even the Natural Peach Seal could no longer fully conceal Ling Han’s existence, and he drew a strong backlash from the Heavenly Dao.

Ling Han had a strange feeling. It was as if he had leaped out of the bounds of this heaven and earth.

In the past, he was assimilated within, as if he was just a drop of water in a mighty ocean. He was one of them, but now he had become a fish. Though he was still unable to leave this ocean behind, he could occasionally leap out of the water, and look at this world from a different angle.

Heavenly Dao was already far from him, but it seemed as if he could grasp it easier even now.

An enlightenment rose up in Ling Han. It was no wonder that a fifth severance would definitely become a Celestial King; so that was the case.

Weng, a light exuded from within his body. It was very gentle, but also very overbearing. This was not celestial light, but blazed even brighter than celestial light.

This was something that belonged solely to him... Light of Dao!

Severed from the heaven and earth, he was his own individual existence.

He was a drop of water in a huge ocean, yet could leap out of this great ocean. When he was strong enough, he himself could become an ocean!

Boom, all of a sudden, a strong wave rippled out in his body. The weak Light of Dao previously was immediately concealed, replaced by a strong brilliance.

Time!

Space!

Slaughter!

Three types of supreme Regulations rang out loudly in Ling Han’s body at the same time, but none could be grasped.

The remaining three floors of the Black Tower... unlocked simultaneously!
