3034 That’s the Reason?

Howl!

Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains’ eyes widened in disbelief.

He had actually been kicked in the balls!

He almost went crazy from anger. How could Ling Han be so impolite?

‘You’re an ultimate elite with Seventh-Tier battle prowess!

‘Not to mention Seventh Tier, even Celestial Kings shouldn’t use such an obscene technique… What other moves do you have? Monkey stealing peaches[1]?’

This was a great humiliation, a great humiliation.

Shatter Mountains cried out loudly. He was truly enraged to the extreme. He had never encountered such an opponent before.

Ling Han was too unconventional and disgusting.

“What’s the point of putting on such an expression? It’s not like they exploded!” Ling Han said nonchalantly.

“Bastardly brat, I’m going to shred your corpse into 10,000 pieces!” Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains roared. He began to counterattack with all his might. Weng! An ancient and vicissitudinous aura overflowed, and it was incomparably shocking.

‘Hmm?’

Ling Han was astounded. Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains’ power had actually increased by several times.

This was unbelievable.

This was because the number of Heavenly Venerable Seals that Shatter Mountains channeled had clearly not changed, and their grade was the same. They were still those first-grade seals. If they were replaced with other seals, his power would only decrease, not increase.

However, the current situation was not like that. Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains’ power had increased by several times even though it was supposed to be at its limit.

Some kind of secret technique?

However, after one had reached Seventh Tier, was there any secret technique that could increase one’s power?

Moreover, why did this aura give him a familiar feeling?

Before Ling Han could think carefully, Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains had already launched a powerful counterattack.

“That’s all there is to it!” Ling Han said disdainfully. The Power of Dimension in his body boiled. After comprehending the secret code of life, the lowest level of life had already been born in all of his dimensions.

Plants.

Although the power of a single plant was insignificant, there were too many of them. After all of them were gathered together, this was a power that couldn’t be ignored.

Boom! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Ling Han threw a punch, clashing head-on with Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains, and instantly forming a shock wave of energy. Peng, the energy wave dispersed, and Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains was sent flying at a speed faster than the energy wave spreading.

In terms of power, Ling Han could already crush his opponent.

“Old bastard, just see me beat you up!” Ling Han chased after him.

“Aren’t you very ruthless? Just go ahead and be ruthless some more!

“Haven’t you always been high and mighty? F*ck, I’ll just step on your face. Let’s see how you can still be arrogant!

“What bullsh*t Seventh Tier? So what if you’re in the Seventh Tier? You can only be trampled by me!”

Ling Han continuously kicked at Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains’ face, using so much force that his opponent’s face was even deformed. However, his Seventh Tier physique could not be damaged—so what if his face was deformed? He instantly recovered.

However, to Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains, this was an enormous humiliation.

“Brat!! Brat!!” Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains roared furiously. He finally threw everything aside. Weng, seven dimensions instantly channeled out of his body.

‘What?!’

Ling Han was shocked. No wonder he had felt that the aura emanating from the other party was somewhat familiar. It turned out that this was actually the Power of Dimension.

However, how could Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains possess seven dimensions?

As far as Ling Han knew, other than having one’s Dantian opened up by a Seventh Tier, anyone else could only accommodate one dimension within their body, and no one was an exception.

Uh, there were some.

For example, Ling Han and Feng Wuding.

This should be related to the Genesis World of the last era, or it could be the current era. It was very likely because of the dot of light in his body. Other than the secret code of life, there were also other secrets that he had not been able to crack.

However, how did Shatter Mountains manage it then?

If he had had seven dimensions, wouldn’t he have channeled them long ago?

‘Hang on!’

Ling Han’s gaze shifted. He discovered that out of these seven dimensions, only one had reached the level of a high-tier high-level dimension, which was also the limit. Without the opportunity to conquer the heavens and create the earth, it was impossible for a Seventh Tier to push the dimension in one’s body to transcendent level.

In that case, a Seventh Tier would possess the strength of at least 10 Seventh Tiers, so strong that they could crush all eras.

However, the problem was that the other six dimensions of Shatter Mountains had only reached the low-tier high-level dimension.

If Shatter Mountains had already cultivated these six additional dimensions, then after cultivating for countless epochs, shouldn’t he have long advanced these six dimensions to high-tier high-level dimensions?

If it was only recently that he had cultivated a new dimension, then there should only be one dimension below the level of high-tier high-level dimension.

Now, the six dimensions were all low-tier high-level dimensions. This meant that… Shatter Mountains had to have suddenly formed six dimensions not too long ago.

‘How was this possible?!’

“Heh, old thief, did you suddenly return from the Realm Battlefield because you wanted to cultivate these six dimensions?” Ling Han pointed at them.

“None of your business!” Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains shouted loudly, and his hands transformed into axes, slashing madly at Ling Han. With a swing of his arms, even the Void seemed to be about to be split into two, and it was incomparably terrifying.

“You’re asking for a beating!” Ling Han threw a punch over. Peng, Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains was sent flying again.

So what if there were six more dimensions?

These were only low-tier high-level dimensions, which was equivalent to having more than 60 Fifth Tiers helping out. To a Seventh Tier, what was this worth?

Even if they reached the level of high-tier high-level dimension, that would only be able to advance to the Sixth Tier… mm-hm, around 60 people with Sixth-Tier battle prowess joining forces, which could just barely match the early stage of the Seventh Tier.

Right now, Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains was completely unable to compete with Ling Han.

Ling Han chased after him, and continued to wave his fists. “Let me guess. It’s not just you, old bastard, but also Chong Yan and the others, who extremely abruptly returned from the Realm Battlefield. Could it be that this is the reason?

“However, if one can comprehend the secret technique to create dimensions, dimensions should still be born one by one. Furthermore, I don’t believe that five people could have grasped this ability at the same time.”

Peng, peng, peng, Ling Han’s fists rained down, beating Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains until he had no temper at all. Moreover, Ling Han wasn’t just using his fists—his feet weren’t idle, either, continuously kicking Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains’ balls.

Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains’ expression was incomparably ugly. Firstly, he had been beaten by Ling Han. This was too humiliating, and he was about to explode from anger. Secondly, it was because of Ling Han’s guess that his heart couldn’t help but palpitate.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Although the few of you old bastards are already standing at the peak of the world, creating dimensions is still something that you have nothing to do with. Therefore, you definitely didn’t comprehend anything, but rather obtained some sort of opportunity…”

He suddenly came to a halt as a bold guess surfaced in his mind.

“There were 100 dimensions in Feng Wuding’s body. Don’t tell me… you all got your dimensions from him!”

Kuang, Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains’ eyes flashed violently, and he opened his mouth to shout. There was the sound of thunder, and he spat out a purple Heavenly Spear, which slashed towards Ling Han.

With a clang, 39 layers of Ling Han’s defenses were actually knocked off, causing Ling Han to be slightly shocked. This ultimate move was indeed rather powerful, but unfortunately, it was still not enough to tear through his defenses.

“What? Did I hit the nail on the head?”

[1] This move is literally making a grab at someone’s balls, which I think can be imagined, literally.
