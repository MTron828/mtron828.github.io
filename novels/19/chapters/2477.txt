Chapter 2478: Celestial King 2480: Subduing a Celestial King

Pu!

The Divine Demon Sword carved a brilliant arc through the air before ruthlessly piercing Dongfang Rui’s skull.

Dongfang Rui’s eyes widened in shock. If he raised his eyes slightly, he could see the swaying sword that was embedded in his head.

Ling Han had controlled his power extremely well, with the sword only just piercing Dongfang Rui’s divine sense. In fact, the tip of the sword didn’t even come out the other side of his head. Thus, the sword swayed up and down, and it looked as if it might fall out at any moment.

Dongfang Rui reached up to grab the Divine Demon Sword, yet the energy in his body was draining at an alarming rate. At this moment, he was even weaker than a three-year-old infant.

“I know what you want to say,” Ling Han said as he walked over. He wore an apathetic expression as he continued, “I’m sure you want to threaten me by bringing out your father again. So, let me save you some energy. I’m not afraid of your father, and there will come a day when I drag him off his throne and beat him until he becomes a dead dog! Remember this. When your father enters the afterlife, ask him if he died like this!”

Dongfang Rui wanted to speak, yet when he opened his mouth, he couldn’t speak a word at all. He wanted to use his divine sense, yet his mind had already been pierced, so how could he do so?

He could only emit a gagging sound as the vitality rapidly drained from his body.

He couldn’t accept this. As a monarch star, as the son of a Heavenly Venerate, as someone who had been sealed for several epochs so he could compete for the flawless Celestial King, as someone who could become a Heavenly Venerate in the future… Now, however, he had been ruthlessly killed before he could even become a Celestial King.

If he had known that this would happen, he would have definitely chosen to become a Ninth Heaven Celestial King first. After all, he would still have a sliver of a chance to become a Heavenly Venerate. It was just that this chance would be much smaller than if he obtained the flawless Celestial Seed.

Now, however, everything was futile.

“I’ll… be… waiting… for… you…” Dongfang Rui said, drawing on the last ounce of his power. This was the culmination of his resentment and despair. He refused to die before he uttered these words.

This wasn’t a grand agreement or whatnot, but was instead the greatest desire in his mind. He wished for Ling Han to die quickly; he wished for Ling Han to enter the afterlife with him

......

Ling Han smiled, and said, “It’s more realistic to wait for your father. Farewell!”

He pulled back the Divine Demon Sword.

Pu!

A jet of blood sprayed into the air, after which Dongfang Rui fell limply to the floor. He was undoubtedly dead. However, his eyes were still wide open, showing his anger and despair. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Beside him, even Ji Wuming and Huo Furong had their mouths slightly open in astonishment. It was as if they could barely comprehend this.

That was the son of a Heavenly Venerate!

Not long ago, the Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate and the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable had only agreed to stop hunting Ling Han because of Heavenly Venerate Wu Le’s threat. If they dared to touch a single hair of Ling Han’s, Heavenly Venerate Wu Le would kill all of their descendants. Both Heavenly Venerates had children, so they were naturally afraid of this threat.

Now, however, Ling Han had killed Dongfang Rui. What could hold the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable back now?

However, after some careful thought, since Dongfang Rui could hunt Ling Han, why couldn’t Ling Han kill him in return?

Oh, so Dongfang Rui was immune to Heavenly Venerate Wu Le’s rage?

Ling Han wore a radiant smile. Heavenly Venerate Wu Le would naturally hold the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable back for him. In fact, even Zhou Heng would help him. This had been a battle between youths of the same generation, so life and death was their own responsibility. How could seniors interfere?

The two Second Heaven Celestial Kings both trembled in terror. They were filled with petrification. Ling Han had killed the son of a Heavenly Venerate without so much as blinking his eyes. What were they worth?

They exchanged a glance, and exclaimed, “Run!”

While Ling Han’s attention was elsewhere, they immediately made an attempt to flee.

“Since you’ve already come, why don’t you stay for a while longer?” Ling Han raised his hand, making a pressing motion at the two Celestial Kings.

The Regulations of Time rumbled forth, detrimentally affecting their speed.

The two Celestial Kings fled with all their might, yet they quickly discovered that they were moving as slow as a snail. In fact, even the falling leaves were moving faster than them.

‘This…!’

They were absolutely horrified. This was the Regulation of Time!

Was this youth the reincarnation of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King? He had only just advanced to the Celestial King Tier, so how did he possess such mastery over the Regulations?

Where had he found so much time to cultivate?

“We need to go all out!” the two Celestial Kings roared. Boundless power of Regulations surged from their bodies, instantly shattering the restriction of time. After all, at the Celestial King Tier, all Regulations were equal.

However, even though they shouted this, one of the Celestial Kings seized the opportunity to flee as the other continued to battle Ling Han.

“You…!” The battling Celestial King was enraged.

However, Ling Han wasn’t worried at all. He smiled at his opponent, and said, “Rest assured, I won’t let him escape.” He then flicked his right hand.

Xiu!

The Divine Demon Sword shot forward, slicing through the air at an impressive speed.

Pu!

The Divine Demon Sword instantly pierced the left shoulder of the fleeing Celestial King. Under the immense momentum, he was sent crashing to the ground, where he was ultimately impaled.

In fact, it was only because he had dodged in time that the sword had impaled his left shoulder. Otherwise, it would have directly pierced his heart, and the Divine Demon Sword would have at least consumed his blood essence.

“See, what did I tell you?” Ling Han mused to his struggling opponent.

The Celestial King trembled in terror. He felt like Ling Han wasn’t a human at all. Instead, he was a demon from head to toe. How could he be so powerful?

So be it if he was powerful. Most importantly, how was he so fearless? He was genuinely displaying no hesitation toward killing others.

A thought flashed through his mind, and he immediately fell to one knee, stammering, “I… I’m willing to submit to you, lord. I’m willing to fight alongside you, my lord!” He announced his surrender to Ling Han.

This was an inconceivable sight. A Second Heaven Celestial King was actually expressing his loyalty to a newly advanced Celestial King? This was utterly comical!

Ling Han reached over to pat the Celestial King’s shoulder.

The Celestial King was scared to death. He was afraid that Ling Han would suddenly attack and kill him. With each pat, his heart would shudder in fright. Fortunately, Ling Han didn’t attack him. However, he couldn’t relax at all, and cold sweat continued to flow down his body.

Ling Han finally retrieved his hand with a smile, saying, “Alright, you can follow me in the future. What’s your name?”

“Lord, this… I… this subordinate is called Fu Yuan.” The Celestial King had initially wanted to refer to himself as “this lord.” However, he realized this was far too arrogant, so he immediately changed to refer to himself as “I.” However, this also seemed inappropriate, so he settled for using the tone of a subordinate. After all, he was now a subordinate of Ling Han.

“Lord!” The Celestial King who had been impaled by the Divine Demon Sword also crawled up. However, he didn’t dare to remove the Divine Demon Sword. He ran up to Ling Han before dropping to one knee, saying, “This subordinate is called Cheng Tao. I’m also willing to serve my lord and offer up my measly strength.”

If the Dark Frost Celestial King saw this, he would definitely flare up in rage. Back then, Fu Yuan and Cheng Tao had only formed an alliance with him. Even though he had been the alliance leader, there had been no explicit hierarchy among them. Now, however, these two Celestial Kings were kneeling and announcing their servitude to Ling Han. This could naturally infuriate him to death.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “Very well. Offer me a wisp of your divine senses, and I’ll accept you as my underlings.”

The expressions of Fu Yuan and Cheng Fu changed drastically. Once they offered up their divine sense, even though their life wouldn’t be in the hands of Ling Han, Ling Han would be able to easily find them using their divine sense. They wouldn’t be able to hide anywhere. If Ling Han were ruthless enough, he could even shatter their divine senses and severely wound them.

However, at this moment, could they reject this offer?

If they did, death would be their only fate.

However, they didn’t want to die.
