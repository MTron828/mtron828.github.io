2782 Disciplining on Liu Shishuang’s Behalf

Liu Shishuang was also extremely displeased, saying, “My people never bow their heads to others.”

“Oh? Even if they’ve committed the gravest sin?” Ling Han asked calmly.

“Of course!” Liu Shishuang said with pride. “That’s your own misfortune and bad luck.”

With such leniency and protection, it was no wonder those two people had turned out like that.

!!

The two Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings were extremely smug. They had followed their older cousin since a young age, and made a significant amount of emotional investment. Thus, Liu Shishuang was also extremely protective of them. Otherwise, they couldn’t have advanced to the Ninth Heaven so quickly.

It was also because of this that they came with Liu Shishuang to the Realm Battlefield, regardless of how dangerous it was. They were confident that Liu Shishuang would definitely keep them safe and allow them to continue their lavish and wanton life.

In fact, they were also people with aspirations, and they felt like bullying normal people was far too boring and lacking in sense of achievement. Otherwise, as Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, where couldn’t they act smugly and freely?

Ling Han shook his head, saying, “By the looks of it, it’s not only the two of them who need a lesson!”

“Impudence!!” Liu Shishuang’s underlings all bellowed. In their eyes, Liu Shishuang was someone who couldn’t be slandered. In their countless battles, Liu Shishuang had saved them heaven knew how many times. This caused them to feel grateful and indebted, so they were all willing to become his underlings.

Liu Shishuang smiled, and said, “Ling Han, I’ve heard of you before. You once performed a miracle in the first spatial level. However, this isn’t the first level, and there are numerous people more powerful than you. You’re nothing in this level.”

“Oh? So what you’re trying to say is that you’re more powerful than me?” Ling Han mused. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Of course,” Liu Shishuang replied with pride.

“I don’t believe so!” Ling Han said as he strode forward, reaching out to grab Liu Shishuang.

“How audacious!” Liu Shishuang said with a humph. He also reached out to grab at Ling Han’s wrist.

Peng!

The two of them exchanged a blow, and Liu Shishuang’s expression instantly changed. It was as if his fingers had collided with an iron sheet as they were sent bouncing back. In fact, it was as if the bones in his fingers were about to shatter from the contact. This was an indescribably painful experience.

Even more shocking was the fact that Ling Han’s hand continued to shoot forward, grabbing at his neck.

“You’ve gone too far!!” Liu Shishuang roared. He could accept defeat, but having someone grab his neck would be utter humiliation! It would become a stain on his life forever! He couldn’t tolerate this.

Weng!

His chest lit up, transforming into a fuzzy symbol.

Time was against him, so it was already too late for him to unleash a Heavenly Venerate Technique. However, he could channel his Heavenly Venerable Seals with a single thought.

Boom!

A beam of light erupted from his chest, shooting at Ling Han.

“Hmph!” Ling Han turned his palm and made a slight knocking motion, immediately shattering the beam of light. Barely affected at all, his hand continued to aim at Liu Shishuang’s neck.

Liu Shishuang’s expression changed again. He hadn’t expected that even his Heavenly Venerable Seals would fail to block Ling Han. However, he had already unleashed all of his attacks at this moment, so he could only watch helplessly as Ling Han’s hand shot over and wrapped around his neck, lifting him up.

Gasp!

Everyone was transfixed with shock, their jaws on the ground.

That was a powerful elite ranked in the top 300 on the recent leaderboard! Yet, like with an eagle catching a chick, he had been easily captured by Ling Han with a single palm! He hadn’t been able to resist at all.

“Ling Han, you’re taking things too far!” Liu Shishuang bellowed. He was unwilling to suffer such humiliation.

Weng!

He summoned his Heavenly Venerate Tool, preparing to fight to the death.

“Too far your mom!” Ling Han replied. With a shake of his right hand, Liu Shishuang’s bones instantly collided with each other.

Pa, pa, pa!

Liu Shishuang’s bones were shattered, causing him to instantly lose his power and faint.

Meanwhile, having lost connection with its owner, the Heavenly Venerate Tool also dimmed, falling to the ground with a smack.

In this second spatial level, the Heavenly Venerates were mostly all newly promoted ones, so it was naturally impossible for everyone to own their own Heavenly Venerate Tool. Even though the Flaming Frost Realm was a transcendent dimension, it was still impossible for it to produce so much Devouring Metal.

The experienced Heavenly Venerates who had come from other dimensions naturally possessed their own Heavenly Venerate Tools. However, only a pitiful few newbie Heavenly Venerates enjoyed such a privilege.

Ling Han casually tossed Liu Shishuang aside before turning his gaze to the two Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. His eyes were ice-cold.

This was a battlefield where brave cultivators resisted the invasion of Hysteria; this was no playground for profligate youngsters. The existence of such people was a dishonor to those who had sacrificed themselves in this land.

The two Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings were so terrified that they involuntarily started to shake. This result was far beyond their expectation.

In the past, no matter how much trouble they caused, Liu Shishuang would always be there to resolve things for them. Moreover, they weren’t stupid, either, and they definitely wouldn’t provoke those who were ranked in the top 500 on the recent leaderboard or those who were related to them. Thus, they had never come across any issues.

Unexpectedly, however, they had hit a brick wall today.

“Wh-what do you want to do?” the two of them asked in a quaking voice. They couldn’t contain their fear.

Ling Han swung his hand.

Pa!

With a single slap, both of them collapsed to the ground, their jaws gone. Blood jetted into the air, painting a sanguine and brutal picture.

“Aaah…!!!” The two of them howled in agony. Since when had they ever suffered such pain before?

Upon seeing this, Fang Hongdian and the others all felt delight in their minds. They had been itching to pummel these two forever. However, because of their relationship with Liu Shishuang, their dreams to do so were nothing more than just that.

Now, however, Ling Han was turning this into a reality for them. The only downside was that Liu Shishuang had also been knocked unconscious by Ling Han. This made them feel extremely complicated, and they were unsure of how to face Ling Han.

After slapping the two Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings for a while, Ling Han directly destroyed their Celestial Seeds and turned them into cripples.

Dealing with such trash, he was already being lenient by letting them live.

“No!!!” The two of them were both conscious, so after discovering that they had been crippled, they couldn’t help but sob in inconsolable grief. Without their cultivation, how could they possibly block their Immortal’s Tribulation? They would definitely be killed by heaven and earth!

Ling Han ignored them as he returned to his original position beside Yuan Yinglong and the others.

At this moment, Yuan Yinglong and his underlings all looked at Ling Han with different expressions. It was as if they weren’t looking at a fellow Heavenly Venerate, but instead an elite from at least the third level.

...

“Let’s go.”

They set off, advancing against the flow of the black waterfall and into the sky.

This waterfall was far too long, and after flying for three entire days, they still had yet to see any signs of its peak. Only after flying for another five days did they finally arrive at the top of the waterfall.

Here, there was a massive hole in the mountain from which the boundless black water surged out. As if it were connected to a large world, they could see countless broken shards of worlds rushing out with the water.

On each side of the waterfall was a huge boulder where there were many people standing. These people were all brimming with a powerful and vast aura of dominance.

Most of them were Heavenly Venerates.

Ling Han and his companions also landed on the boulders.

Yuan Yinglong looked around, and he involuntarily sucked in a sharp breath. “Who would’ve thought? Not only has this mystery realm attracted many prodigies from the recent leaderboard, but it’s even attracted elites from the third and fourth levels.

“Over there,” he said as he pointed with his chin. “That person in the red robe is the renowned Shi Zhonghe from the fourth level. He bears the title ‘Nine Swords Demon Venerate,’ and he can kill any opponent within nine strikes of his sword.

“And over there, the person in the long green dress,” Yuan Yinglong continued. “She’s Shi Mengyu, also a prodigy from the fourth level. I think she’s also on the recent leaderboard, and she has the title ‘Jade Flame Heavenly Venerate.’

“Gasp! Far too many elites have come this time!”
