3054 So it’s you

‘Here he comes!’

Ling Han’s eyes suddenly lit up. He still didn’t reveal a trace of his aura, and only sat quietly.

A figure quietly appeared. He did not alert anyone, and only a powerful existence like Ling Han could sense his aura.

‘Hmm?’

When Ling Han saw this person’s appearance, he couldn’t help but reveal a look of surprise. In fact, he even had a feeling of disbelief.

It wasn’t him, but… her.

Extermination!

It was actually Extermination, the destroyer of the previous era, who was snatching people from him?

What was the purpose?

Ling Han didn’t beat around the bush. By now, there was no longer any need for him to do this anymore.

He stepped out. Boom! Power that surpassed the peak of Seventh Tier surged, incomparably terrifying.

Extermination was instantly alerted, and looked towards him. A trace of shock flashed across her beautiful face, as if she was also very surprised to see Ling Han here.

“Don’t you think it’s too much to take away my people without my permission?” Ling Han said calmly.

Extermination stood with her hands crossed behind her back, looking coldly at Ling Han, a hint of disdain at the corners of her mouth.

This was completely different from the Jue Huo who had called himself “Niu” in the past. Ling Han sighed. He still wanted to see the Jue Huo of the past, but now… this might no longer be possible.

“Don’t go against me!” Extermination said with baleful killing intent.

“Ha!” Ling Han laughed loudly. “You’re clearly the one who’s snatching my people, so how did it become me going against you? Who are you now? Jue Huo, Extermination, or who?”

“You don’t need to know this!” Extermination said. “Now, retreat immediately, or don’t blame me for being heartless!”

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “You were also the abductor in the Thousand Leaves Realm, right? If you hand the young man over, I’ll only beat you up.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“In your dreams,” Extermination said coldly, not taking Ling Han’s words to heart at all.

“Then you’re the one who’s asking for a beating!” Ling Han charged out. Peng! A heavy punch sent Extermination flying, and behind the Void split open behind her, and Extermination directly disappeared inside.

The destructive power of a Seventh-Tier battle was too great, much too great. This was only a low-level dimension, so how could it possibly withstand such torment? It would definitely be blasted apart.

“Huh?” Extermination looked surprised. “Your strength actually increased so quickly!”

“Thus, obediently hand him over!” Ling Han rushed over, his fists pounding furiously.

“No matter how strong you are, you are only in the Sixth Tier,” Extermination said disdainfully. With a wave of her hand, she brought with her an unparalleled power that pressed down on Ling Han.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

The two of them fought fiercely, turning the Void into a mess.

Extermination was the peerless fiend of the previous generation. Back then, she was someone that even Seventh Tier ultimate elites had to risk destroying the Genesis World to kill. This proved how terrifying she was.

However, Extermination was no longer the same as before.

Her physical body had been blasted apart, and her divine sense had also left her body. Now, a new consciousness had been born, causing her battle prowess to plummet, and she no longer possessed the terrifying abilities to crush all Seventh Tiers.

She was still very strong. After all, a starving camel was still bigger than a horse, so she was only slightly at a disadvantage when she clashed with Ling Han.

However, it was precisely because she was at a disadvantage that Extermination could not accept it.

How could a Sixth Tier be so strong?

However, Extermination still had her advantages. Her physique was not bad, and she was completely capable of fighting a battle of attrition with Ling Han.

However, this was something that Extermination could not tolerate.

Just how powerful had she been in the past?

“If I had known earlier, I wouldn’t have let you live until today!” she said hatefully.

Back then, she had had the chance to make a move on Ling Han. After all, when she had still been Jue Huo, Ling Han had almost never been on guard against her.

“So much nonsense!” Ling Han continued to attack. Since Jue Huo was unwilling to hand over the person he wanted, he could only beat her until she submitted.

Also, why was Extermination looking for the same target as him?

Could she also resonate with the light spots?

Wait, didn’t the World’s Will say that it had repaired Extermination’s body and given her another soul, allowing Extermination to stand against Hysteria now? In the future, she would have to join forces with Ling Han and combine the power of Yin and Yang into the eighth fundamental power to kill Hysteria.

What was the meaning of this now then?

Was it the World’s Will?

Correct. Since this Extermination was resurrected by the World’s Will and given a new spirit, the question was, how did the World’s Will give a new spirit? What was the essence of this spirit?

Also… the World’s Will said that it was about to dissipate and die, but there was a powerful body in front of it. Why didn’t it enter it and use it for itself?

Generally speaking, weak souls could not enter the bodies of elites, because the bodies of elites had a powerful repulsive force.

In that case, it was impossible to even enter, so how could it occupy her mind and take over her body?

However, if the World’s Will was really the World’s Will, then possessing the body of a Seventh Tier elite was not impossible.

Why would the World’s Will of the last era rather dissipate than possess this body?

Unless… it had already done so.

Ling Han’s eyes lit up, and he suddenly shouted, “So it’s you!”

“What do you mean by ‘it’s you’!” Extermination continued to bombard Ling Han with attacks, each and every one of them swift and fierce. She wanted to send Ling Han flying and then leave the Void to seize her target.

“At the core of the Genesis World of the last era, we’ve even met before. How could you forget about it just like that?” Ling Han said calmly.

Extermination’s eyes suddenly lit up, and an astonishing cold light shot out. Even her attack had lost its accuracy.

“It really is you!” Ling Han said with absolute certainty.

In fact, he wasn’t certain at all before. He was completely in a daze. Extermination probably didn’t expect his thoughts to jump from one aspect to another so quickly like this. In the end, it caused her to have an obvious reaction.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about!” Extermination said coldly.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “That’s meaningless. Now that we’ve spoken so much, do you think you can still fool me?”

All of a sudden, countless thoughts flashed through his mind.

The World’s Will had directed its own death. This way, no matter what it had said before, Ling Han would not doubt it—who would doubt a person who was about to die?

For example, it wanted Ling Han to cooperate with Extermination and convince Ling Han that only by joining forces with Extermination could they eliminate Hysteria.

In this way, Ling Han would think of ways to gain Extermination’s trust, and even in fact sacrifice some of his own benefits.

However, what the World’s Will did not expect was that Ling Han would actually discover a speck of light in his body… which was actually very coincidental. If Ling Han had not met Ning Haixin and become curious about her, how could he have drawn out his own secret?

Moreover, Wally was also involved. It could be said that the entire incident was a series of coincidences.

No matter how good the World’s Will was at scheming, it couldn’t have predicted such a thing, right?

From the looks of it, the World’s Core was probably fake as well. Otherwise, Hysteria wouldn’t be completely clueless about it.

In that case, Chong Yan and the others were also fooled.

Strange, this World’s Will had gone through so much trouble to deceive people, so what was it after?
