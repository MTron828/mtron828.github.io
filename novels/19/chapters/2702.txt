2703 Finding Du Shiyi

A wave of lava was rising, and then crashing towards them?

Ling Han frowned. This lava had originally been flowing calmly; how could it possibly suddenly rise up in a wave?

Previously, it was a fish that had caused trouble, sweeping out the lava to splash towards them, yet now it was a wave that was assailing them. If Ling Han was told this was a natural phenomenon, he wouldn’t believe it even if it killed him.

“Let’s retreat first.”

Ling Han grabbed Wally. Their figures rose and descended, escaping from the direction that the wave was attacking.

Yet it seemed like the wave had eyes of its own. It actually switched directions, and continued to rush towards them.

The large black dog wanted to evade again, but Ling Han shook his head. “Don’t dodge. Let’s fight!”

If they rose up, the waves of heat intertwining in the air were actually even hotter than where there wasn’t any lava.

Boom! The wave of lava reached them. Now that it had gotten close enough, they could see that there were actually fishes moving around in the wave.

This wave was actually caused by a great many fishes!

Ling Han humphed, and said, “I knew that was the case!” He clenched his hand into a fist, and threw a punch at the wave.

Peng!

The frightening force of the punch surged forwards. This was a Pseudo-Heavenly-Venerable-Tier attack.

The great wave immediately exploded into bits. There were at least 100 fire fishes inside, and they were all blasted into the skies. Some directly exploded into sparks, but the majority still fell back down, completely intact.

Ling Han stretched out a hand again, and he instantly grabbed three fire fishes.

He did not directly use his bare hand to grab them, because he could feel the waves of heat exuding from the fire fishes. They were hot enough to cause damage to even their defense.

“Haha, damn bug, just try and be arrogant again!” The large black dog laughed loudly. Faced with that wave from before, even a peak-stage Ninth Heaven Celestial King could only flee in a panic because the attacks he delivered would not be able to do anything to this kind of fiery wave at all. His power would be directly melted and destroyed by the Regulations of Fire.

But when a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate moved, the effects were immediately different.

Pa, pa, pa! The fire fishes all fell back into the lava. They discovered that some of their companions had fallen into enemy hands, and immediately launched another assault. With a flick of their tails, they splashed out the crimson lava at Ling Han.

Ling Han threw out another punch. Overwhelming power surged past, and peng, the lava was instantly sent flowing backwards. More than a dozen fire fish were crushed into bits.

These fire fishes finally became afraid. The survivors quickly fled with a wave of their tails.

“What exactly is this thing?” The large black dog approached to take a look.

Ling Han was also studying them. These three fire fishes were indeed formed by Regulations of Fire. Ling Han could achieve that as well—he only had to extract the Regulations of Fire—but it was much too difficult to make it so that they had intelligence. Probably only the heaven and earth had that kind of ability.

Outrageously bold, he tried to swallow one of the fire fishes in a single gulp. After entering his stomach, it became a ball of fire, threatening to burn and melt all his organs with its heat.

Ling Han forcefully suppressed it, using supreme might to grind out the Regulations of Fire bit by bit.

He sighed, and refined one of the fire fishes, yet did not gain anything from it at all.

“Forget it. Grandpa Dog doesn’t want to eat it.” The large black dog shook his head, and took a few steps back.

Ling Han destroyed the remaining two fire fishes. If it was just one or two of them, he naturally would have no fear, but if it was a whole school of fire fishes, even he would frown when numbers reached a certain extent. It was just like how a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate could be ganged up on by over 100 peak-stage Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings. If he did not quickly charge out of the siege, his fate would also be death.

“This really is a dangerous place.” Ling Han nodded. If it were not for the fact that he had Pseudo-Heavenly-Venerable-Tier strength, or if it had been any other Ninth Heaven Celestial King, they really could only have fled.

And they had just entered the vicinity of the volcano; who knew how many more dangers there lay within.

They continued onwards, their advance not very fast. This place was filled with traps as well. Just when you clearly saw a rock protruding, it would immediately explode and spurt out boiling lava when you stepped on it, and no one could guard against that.

Ling Han was still fine, but the large black dog had a much worse time, so it was always jumping around on two legs.

In the first place, this volcano was shockingly huge, and with how their speed was restrained, they could only search a small area in a whole day. Naturally, they were not so lucky to just happen to come upon Du Shiyi and the others. Furthermore, it was not definite that the three of them would be moving around together. If it was just one of them, it would be even more difficult to find them.

After a short period of rest, they continued their search on the next day.

Three days, four days… They searched endlessly, exploring this volcano bit by bit, but after over a dozen days, they had still only covered around 1% of the whole area, and found nothing.

They were very patient. Exploring this kind of dangerous location needed extreme caution in the first place.

There were not just fire fishes here. There were also other random creatures, like fire crabs, fire scorpions, and fire snakes. They were all formed from Regulations of Fire. Though they themselves were very weak, they had reached the pinnacle in terms of Regulations. Even when a peak-stage Ninth Heaven Celestial King attacked them, they could possibly kill their enemy yet wound themselves severely in the process.

Still, in front of Ling Han, a Celestial King who possessed power at the level of the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, they were all trash.

In the blink of an eye, half a year had passed. Ling Han and company had also explored around one-sixth of the total area here, but still could not find any clues.

Another two days later.

“Hmm?” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Huh?”

Practically at the same time, Ling Han and the large black dog pricked their ears, while Wally looked towards their left, two rays of green light shooting from his eyes.

Very quickly, they saw a person shooting over from a distance, but he was not running directly towards them. Clearly, he was not running over just because he had discovered the three of them.

He naturally could not run on a straight course. The floating rocks here had absolutely no pattern, so he was running on a serpentine course.

“Du Shiyi!” Ling Han exclaimed, slightly surprised. There had been no trace of him even after they had been searching for half a year, but they had now found him effortlessly.

However, he quickly frowned.

Du Shiyi was not alone; there was a chain of people that were in hot pursuit of him.

He was being hunted?

Ling Han’s eyes focused, and his killing intent involuntarily blazed wildly.

Among the people who were hunting down Du Shiyi, he recognized one of them.

…The Azure Ghost Celestial King, the big boss of Ghost King City at the Celestial King Graveyard.

He was actually here.

Previously, when Zhou Heng had swept through the Celestial King Graveyard, he had not found Desolate Moon, and those Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings had long since disappeared. Yet now, the Azure Ghost Celestial King had actually appeared here; what did that mean?

It was extremely possible that after Desolate Moon and those Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings left the Celestial King Graveyard, they had gone into hiding in this volcano.

This place was covered by supreme Regulations, so if a Heavenly Venerate did not come personally, it was impossible that they could see through to what was hidden beneath the cover of lava here.

Furthermore, this was a dangerous place for others, but if you had tens of thousands of Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings, how could it be that their combined force was still not enough to deal with those fire fish, fire scorpions, and so on?

After so many years passing, Desolate Moon had probably long since completed his mission, and the Azure Ghost Celestial King and the others had all advanced to the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier. Otherwise, with Du Shiyi’s strength, how could it be possible that he would be so terribly pursued by over a dozen Celestial Kings?

“Brother Du!” Ling Han shouted, and communicated with Du Shiyi via divine sense.

“Ling Han!” Du Shiyi was both stunned and delighted. He had not expected that he would encounter Ling Han here. However, he did not run in the direction of Ling Han. Instead, he took a turn, and communicated with him via divine sense as well. “These people are all influenced by Hysteria, and have lost their minds. However, their strength is astonishing, and they have already become Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates.

“Return immediately to the martial academy, and bring the news back. I will try my best to draw them away!”
