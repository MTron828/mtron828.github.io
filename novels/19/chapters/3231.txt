3232 The emergence of elites

‘Murder!’

The hall was silent.

Although Hu Qiu’s actions just now had been unbearable, and he had betrayed them under Ling Han’s threat, scolding the entire Hu Clan, these were two separate matters. He was ultimately still a descendant of the Hu Clan, but now, he had been killed by an outsider in the clan’s territory.

Who wouldn’t be worried?

Home should be the safest harbor, but now?

Also, this damn guy could have killed Hu Qiu with a casual punch, but he used the overlapping layers of power and turned Hu Qiu into minced meat. Was he deliberately showing off to them?

This was too despicable!

This was the Hu Clan, the Hu Clan of Huju City, one of the six major clans.

No one spoke, and Ling Han’s eyes were also slightly closed, his brain rapidly channeling.

His punch just now had directly shattered Hu Qiu’s bones and internal organs. An ordinary punch wouldn’t have such an effect even if it was superimposed with twenty overlapping layers of power.

Unless one’s power was several times greater than what it was now, one would not be able to achieve such an effect.

Why did he have to use so much strength and overlapping layers of power to kill a mere Hu Qiu?

This was what he wanted to verify.

How could such a strike possess such terrifying power?

That was because the waves of power formed a certain frequency, causing the destructive power to reach the limit.

Why did this happen?

Ling Han thought of a very simple analogy, and that was the swing.

If it was pushed randomly, the swing would keep swaying, but it wouldn’t flip over. However, if one found a frequency to push it, the swing might flip over. In fact, the strength used wouldn’t have to be very great.

Moreover, a bridge was sturdy and could withstand a lot of weight. Even if rows of cars drove across the bridge, it would not be a problem. However, if hundreds of people walked on the bridge at a fixed pace, the bridge might collapse.

Ling Han hadn’t used his full strength in that attack just now. Even if he had used ten overlapping layers of power, logically speaking, it should have only broken Hu Qiu’s bones at most.

However, because he had grasped the fixed frequency, Hu Qiu’s bones were shattered.

“With this frequency, I can fight an opponent that is stronger than me.”

“However, there must be a limit. The key is where the limit is.”

Ling Han had been thinking about this question ever since he returned from the Thousand Lotus Mountains. Now, he finally understood.

“Good! Good! Good!” Hu Ronghai stared at Ling Han. “From this moment on, the Hu Clan will not rest until you die. Even if a Heavenly King comes, he won’t be able to save you!”

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “You’re not a Heavenly King, so how would you know that you can’t save me? Besides, is the Hu Clan that strong?”

“Young man, you’re too arrogant!” Hu Ronghai said balefully.

Ling Han looked at him and shook his head. “You seem to have forgotten how your arms were broken?”

These words struck Hu Ronghai’s sore spot. The most injustice he had suffered was being crippled by Ling Han before he could even display his strongest abilities. This made him want to vomit blood just thinking about it.

“You’re destined to bleed here today!” he said fiercely.

“Oh, if you want to kill my soldier, why don’t you ask if I, Lian Xuerong, has agreed to it?” A cold but pleasant voice sounded. Lian Xuerong walked in from outside. She was still wearing black leather clothes, completely outlining her impressive figure.

Many people swallowed their saliva when they saw her.

In Huju City, there were many people who had designs on this sexy rose. However, Lian Xuerong was not only a Third Change Blood Transformation Tier cultivator, but also the Banner Lord of the Xuanqing Banner. Who would dare to compel a general of the Majestic Empire? Wouldn’t they be afraid of being beheaded?

“So it’s Banner Lord Lian. Excuse me for not coming out to welcome you.” Hu Ronghai smiled insincerely. He originally wanted to raise his hands in greeting, but he realized that his arms were broken. The expression on his face naturally became even more ferocious.

“You came at the right time!” He nodded. “This soldier of yours barged into my Hu Clan and killed someone in public. Banner Lord Lian, please apprehend him and hand him over to our Hu Clan to be dealt with.”

“Banner Lord Lian is the leader of the Xuanqing Banner. Isn’t the Xuanqing Banner meant to protect law-abiding citizens like us?” A Hu Clan member said sarcastically.

“Banner Lord Lian, please take down this murderer!”

“Banner Lord Lian, please make your move!”

The Hu Clan members said one after another.

“No, no!” Huan Xue quickly defended. “They kidnapped me here. Young Master barged in to save me. It really has nothing to do with Young Master.”

Meanwhile, Ling Han smiled, and said, “That’s what happened. My maidservant was kidnapped, and after my investigation, I discovered that it was done by the Hu Clan. In order to prevent the Hu Clan from sneaking her away, I didn’t report to the Banner Lord, and directly took action.”

“Nonsense. What kind of existence is my Hu Clan? Why would we do such a thing as abducting people?” Hu Ronghai snorted. “Little Ninth just took a fancy to his maidservant and bought her from him. However, this evil brat actually went back on his word. He came here to cause trouble on his wedding day and openly killed!”

“Banner Lord Lian, let me ask you, how should we deal with such an evil act?”

Tsk, tsk, tsk. He was really good at blaming others. He forcefully made a matter that was originally unreasonable sound reasonable and forcefully made the perpetrator sound like a victim.

Ling Han felt that he himself was still far from being shameless. Yes, there was still a lot of room for improvement.

Lian Xuerong said indifferently, “Alright, I’ll bring him back with me. After investigating the truth, I’ll naturally give the Hu Clan an explanation.”

These words clearly meant that she would be covering for Ling Han.

“Banner Lord Lian, don’t you think it’s too much?” Hu Ronghai said balefully. “Can’t you see that my Little Ninth’s corpse is still lying on the ground?”

Lian Xuerong glared at him. “I’m going to leave with my people now. Do you dare to stop me?”

Hu Ronghai was at a loss for words. Who didn’t know that Lian Xuerong had a fiery temper and was extremely protective? She really dared to act recklessly.

If it had been another time, he would not have been afraid to fight even if he was a minor cultivation level weaker. However, now that his arms were crippled, how could he possibly withstand a Third Change elite? Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Hehe, Banner Lord Lian is so impressive!” Another voice sounded. A white-haired old man walked into the hall. Although he looked extremely old, the blood and Qi in his body was at its peak. It was as if there was a ferocious creature hidden in his body that wanted to jump out and hurt people.

“Greetings, Grand Elder!” In an instant, all the members of the Hu Clan knelt on the ground, their confidence skyrocketing.

This was the Hu Clan’s Grand Elder, Hu Can, a Fourth Change Blood Transformation elite.

He single-handedly founded the Hu Clan and brought the Hu Clan to the position of one of the six major clans in Huju City. He was the spiritual pillar of the Hu Clan.

Hu Can waved his hand and said, “Get up.”

The Hu Clan members stood up one after another, all of them regaining their previous arrogance.

Grand Elder had already appeared. What other problems would there be?

Lian Xuerong’s willowy brows furrowed slightly. Hu Can was a Fourth Change elite, and his cultivation level was even higher than hers. If they really fought, the possibility of her losing was even higher.

However, with her protective personality, how could she back down?

“Clan Leader Hu!” She greeted him.
