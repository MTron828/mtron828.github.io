Chapter 1232: Ling Family’s Widow

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Kang Xiu Yuan’s expression was also cold.

Ling Han had indeed helped the Han Lin Pavilion immensely. However, even if it resulted in the Han Lin Pavilion’s immediate collapse, they definitely couldn’t let someone who had plagiarized their master remain in their store. This would be a sign of great disrespect to their master.

Ling Han laughed loudly. He was extremely satisfied with his disciples’ performance. However, he said, “Are you people trying to drive out your benefactor?”

“We’ll give you the necessary compensation,” Kang Xiu Yuan said coldly.

“Aren’t you afraid that I’ll join the Treasure Forest Pavilion?” Ling Han asked. “You two should know. If I join the Treasure Forest Pavilion, this store definitely won’t last 10 days. It’ll be about time to shut the store and call it a day.”

“Heh, I wonder if you’ve heard of this phrase—it’s better to die with honor than to survive with dishonor!” Yun Yong Wang said resolutely.

Ling Han clapped his hands, and said, “Is there really any need to take things so far? I simply made a claim.”

“Sir, it’s about time you left. We’ll send the compensation to your residence in a few days,” Kang Xiu Yuan said. His words made it clear that Ling Han wasn’t welcome anymore.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “I remember that was a cold winter’s day. I was outside a restaurant, and I discovered a freezing child sitting out the front. I ordered a bowl of noodles for him, and he started to follow me from that moment onward. He would follow me no matter where I went.”

Kang Xiu Yuan involuntarily shuddered. There was a look of disbelief in his eyes as he stared at the man in front of him.

That was how he and his master had met. He had been an orphan, and he had almost frozen to death. After receiving a bowl of noodles from Ling Han, he had started to follow him wherever he went. He had tried everything he could to become Ling Han’s follower.

In the end, Ling Han had been moved by his perseverance, and had finally taken him as a disciple. He hadn’t betrayed Ling Han’s hopes, either, and he had displayed an outstanding talent in alchemy. From that moment on, he began his journey as an alchemist.

He had never told this story to anyone else.

‘Don’t tell me... Don’t tell me...’

Ling Han turned to Yun Yong Wang, and said, “You were the young master of the Yun Clan. However, you were dumped by your fiancée, so you came to acknowledge me as your master. You wanted to learn martial arts so that you could return one day and give that woman two solid slaps. Unexpectedly, however, your alchemy talent far surpassed your cultivation talent. In the end, you didn’t become a cultivation elite, but instead became an alchemy grandmaster.

“Yong Wang, Master still remembers the robe that you once made for me. You made it a size too large, and you ended up being the butt of your three brothers’ jokes for a good half a year.”

“M-Master!” Yun Yong Wang involuntarily exclaimed. However, he immediately noticed that something was off. How could this person be his master?

Ling Han sighed, and said, “Master went to explore an ancient site, yet I ended up being killed. However, my soul managed to survive. 10,000 years later, I was reborn in the body of a youth.”

Yun Yong Wang and Kang Xiu Yuan exchanged a glance. They were extremely delighted, yet they also found this hard to believe.

One had to realize that the Reincarnation Flower was a precious treasure among precious treasures, even in the Immortal Realm. Only one Reincarnation Flower would blossom every 10 billion years! Yet, Ling Han was able to reincarnate in the Lower Realm? If that were true, his fortune was even better than that of a Saint.

‘Should we trust him?’

Ling Han chuckled, and then started to recount the bits and pieces from their hundreds of years together.

Yun Yong Wang and Kang Xiu Yuan became more and more astonished. Although these things weren’t secrets, nor were they secret techniques, they were events that only their master and his four disciples should have known. Now that they heard these events being recounted by Ling Han, they became more and more convinced that he was genuinely their master. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

In fact, the most important proof was actually his alchemy skill. Apart from their master, who else could possess such supreme alchemy talent?

If he were genuinely their master, advancing one level in just half a year... wasn’t impossible!

“Master!” Yun Yong Wang and Kang Xiu Yuan both kneeled down, tears streaming down their faces.

Ling Han’s heart also beat in excitement. He raised a hand, and said, “No need for such formalities. It’s been 10,000 years, and Master is pleased to see that you’re both safe and sound. I’m also pleased to see that you’ve both improved in cultivation and alchemy.”

“Master...” Tears continued to stream down Yun Yong Wang’s and Kang Xiu Yuan’s face. They were so emotional that they could barely speak.

“That’s right, where are your two brothers?” Ling Han asked.

Out of his four disciples, Chen Rui Jing was the eldest, Yun Yong Wang was second eldest, Kang Xiu Yuan was third eldest, and the flamboyant Jiang Yue Feng was the youngest.

Yun Yong Wang’s expression changed slightly, and it was as if he were in two minds about whether he should speak or not.

Ling Han noticed this, and he said, “I know there was some friction between you brothers. I guessed this when I saw the two Cold Spear Associations in the Lower Realm. What on earth happened?”

Yun Yong Wang and Kang Xiu Yuan exchanged a glance. Yun Yong Wang then said, “I’ll explain.”

He paused for a moment to collect his thoughts before saying, “A few hundred years after Master died...” He immediately stopped, and there there was an awkward expression on his face as he glanced at Ling Han.

“Don’t worry about it,” Ling Han said with a smile.

“The Five Sects quickly revealed their true colors. They wanted to sacrifice the entire world. At that time, the elites of the world all gathered together to oppose the despicable plan of the Five Sects. However, even though heaven and earth had changed, allowing more elites to appear, the Five Sects had a far greater amount of resources. Not only that, but they had support from the Immortal Realm. Although we managed to kill a few immortals, we were still emphatically defeated in the end.

“Meanwhile, the daughter of a powerful figure from the Heaven’s Sword Palace had come down to sightsee. However, she actually ended up falling in love with Fourth Brother.”

“Ah!” Ling Han couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise. That flamboyant Jiang Yue Feng had actually captured the heart of a noble beauty from the Immortal Realm? This was truly astonishing.

“Unexpectedly, Fourth Brother also fell in love with that woman. In fact, he even wanted us to follow him to the Immortal Realm. However, we naturally rejected him. It was during that time that... us four brothers fell out with each other,” Yun Yong Wang said.

“We had initially planned to fight to the death in the Lower Realm. However, Master’s wife— no, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden took us into the Immortal Realm. We didn’t dare to disobey her.”

Sure enough, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was already his wife in their minds. Her words were even more authoritative than his.

Ling Han shook his head. He hadn’t been able to defeat the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden at that time. Now, however... he could probably defeat her.

“Where is she now?” he asked. There was a hint of emotion in his voice.

“Although Master’s wife... Although the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was born in a small world, her bloodline was supremely powerful. She became a core disciple after returning to the Cloud Phoenix Sect, and she advanced to the Sun Moon Tier after just 3,000 years. Right now, she’s already reached the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier,” Kang Xiu Yuan replied.

“However, she was displeased with her sect’s actions, so she announced her retirement after making several great contributions to the sect. Moreover, she calls herself...”

He paused to look at Ling Han.

Ling Han couldn’t help but feel annoyed, and he said, “Brat, you dare to leave your master hanging?”

Although Kang Xiu Yuan had already lived for so many years, he still chuckled when he heard Ling Han call him a brat. Of course, in terms of relative age, a 10,000-year-old elite at the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier was indeed quite young.

“She calls herself the Ling Family’s Widow,” he said.

Ling Han stroked his chin. That savage woman was actually calling herself his wife! How immodest! However, he liked it!
