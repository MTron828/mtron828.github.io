2734 Evenly Matched

Wu Haoyang was quite surprised. This was because his grandfather, that Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate, had actually personally bestowed on him such power that allowed him to be fearless against all powerful enemies below the level of Second Tier Heavenly Venerate.

But now, a Ninth Heaven Celestial King actually had the ability to pose a threat to him.

“I didn’t expect that besides Lin Youlian, Xin Qihu, and myself, there would be a fourth person who mastered the fundamental power of the Genesis World before reaching the level of a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate,” Wu Haoyang said, but his arrogance remained.

If even Lin Youlian and Xin Qihu were people whom he wanted to surpass, then what would Ling Han be counted as?

!!

In a battle at the same level, Wu Haoyang was confident that he could crush any opponent.

“Come on, let me teach you what it means to be truly invincible!” Wu Haoyang made a move and blasted a shot towards Ling Han.

Ling Han was also filled with excitement. He had wanted to fight Wu Haoyang yesterday, but at that time, Wu Haoyang was battling against the “veterans,” and Ling Han felt it wasn’t appropriate to make a move. Subsequently, he was also persuaded by Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable and the others not to, so he decided to postpone it.

Now this fight was exactly what he wanted.

He fearlessly exchanged blows with Wu Haoyang.

Wu Haoyang used a Heavenly Venerate Technique, blasting out a mass of flames which superseded the power of the Regulations, such that even the Regulations of Fire itself might be burned to ashes.

Ling Han immediately felt that his body was going through scorching heat and extreme pain. The power of the Heavenly Venerate Technique was too great, especially when it was circulated and launched through the hands of a prodigy such as Wu Haoyang—it was totally the battle prowess of a First Tier Heavenly Venerate.

Ling Han circulated the Five Elements Lightning Technique, and started exchanging blows with Wu Haoyang.

This battle was akin to a spear fighting against a spear, both going all out by using their strongest attacks to defeat their opponent.

Of course, such a battle was indeed fierce, and even if a First Tier Heavenly Venerate was to step in, it would be impossible to stop them without using any powerful techniques.

After advancing into the Ninth Heaven, Ling Han’s duration of channeling the Heavenly Venerate Technique had been extended by a lot, while Wu Haoyang was at the same level as him, being equally talented, with almost the same duration of channeling the Heavenly Venerate Technique.

This kind of clash between the two was enough to last for an entire day.

However, after fighting for about half a day, both of them frowned; they had to admit that their opponent was freakish enough to contend against themselves, but the one-day battle was too short for them to determine who was going to be the winner.

However, both of them were arrogant and wanted to suppress one another. Naturally, neither one would stop, so they continued to fight.

Tu Shi and the others felt rueful. The one who could restrain Wu Haoyang was actually a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. To say nothing of them, even a First Tier Heavenly Venerate couldn’t do anything to Wu Haoyang, but the latter was actually being restrained by Ling Han.

Come to think of it, this was actually quite interesting.

Time was still slowly ticking away; the hourglass was almost empty.

Tu Shi and the others couldn’t care less about watching the battle anymore. They retreated one after another, grabbed a chair, and sat down.

Ling Han and Wu Haoyang gave a loud roar at the same time. While continuing to fight fiercely with one another, they dashed towards the last chair.

Both have regarded this chair as the key point to determine the outcome, and whoever grabbed it first would be considered to have the upper hand in this contest.

The speed of the two was so fast that they were already in front of the chair in the blink of an eye, but neither of them could sit down on it. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Ling Han could hurt Wu Haoyang, and Wu Haoyang could hurt him too. Who would dare to risk having to sustain an attack to just sit down?

Their attacks became fiercer and fiercer, and soon there were only three grains of sand left in the hourglass.

“Scram!” Wu Haoyang snarled, and shot out a punch, setting off boundless raging energy. There was an aura of Primal Chaos descending as he pushed his battle prowess to the pinnacle.

“You scram!” As Ling Han also punched out, the Nine Transformations Divine Scroll and the Five Elements Lightning Technique exploded together—he also went all out.

Peng!

Both of their bodies trembled at the same time, and then they were sent flying one after another.

There were two grains of sand left, but the two were still in midair.

Could it be that these two outstanding prodigies were going to be eliminated one after another? That would be really funny.

People outside were all thinking that depending on the situation, the two of them, Ling Han and Wu Haoyang, might not be able to make it back before the last grain of sand was exhausted. Moreover, even if they could come back in time, seeing that their battle prowess was so closely matched, they would still fight to suppress each other. Hence, no one could gain the upper hand.

That would still be a stalemate; no one could win, and they would still be eliminated together.

…Who asked them to fight each other to the death?

Xiu, xiu, the momentum of their retreat had been expended fully. They surged back, and rushed towards the last chair.

“That’s mine!” Wu Haoyang roared.

“In your dreams!” Ling Han sneered as his speed completely exploded.

As the last grain of sand fell, today’s contest came to an end, and those who had not grabbed a seat would be kicked out.

Who could it be?

Everyone’s eyes widened as there was a flash of light, and there was already one more person standing in front of them.

Wu Haoyang.

What about Ling Han?

There was no second flash of light to send out the second person.

Could it be?

One after another, they all looked at the projection of the Heavenly Venerate Tool. Who else could it be sitting on the last chair except Ling Han?

It was just that Ling Han was obviously uncomfortable as only the edge of his buttocks managed to touch the chair, and his sitting posture was indeed extremely awkward.

But no matter how unsightly he appeared, he stayed and was qualified to continue in the competition, while Wu Haoyang was ruthlessly eliminated.

“Ah!” Wu Haoyang roared, his eyes bursting with flames as he could not resign himself to the outcome. Obviously, he ought to be able to defeat all the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates with his strength, but now that he was eliminated in advance, how could he accept it?

“Ling… Han!!” he roared angrily.

Xiu, xiu, xiu, the group of five including Ling Han came out of the Heavenly Venerate Tool. They were the winners, and would be able to continue with the competition tomorrow.

Without saying another word, Wu Haoyang immediately rushed over to fight Ling Han again.

“Stop!” the First Tier Heavenly Venerate here reprimanded as he stretched out his hand to grab him.

“Do you think you can discipline me?” Wu Haoyang was extremely arrogant, and he didn’t give that Heavenly Venerate any face at all. His body transformed into a blazing light, and he was impenetrable by any force, just aiming his attacks at Ling Han.

That Heavenly Venerate was extremely angry, but he was only a First Tier Heavenly Venerate, so how could he do anything to the current Wu Haoyang? Just like everyone else, his moves were all useless, and he couldn’t touch even a single strand of hair on Wu Haoyang’s body.

“Wu Haoyang, you’ve gone too far!” that Heavenly Venerate shouted in a deep voice, feeling great embarrassment at the same time—he was a dignified Heavenly Venerate, after all.

“Gone too far?” Wu Haoyang paused. “Fine, I’ll deal with you first, let’s see who else dares to stop me!”

He no longer attacked Ling Han, but rushed towards that Heavenly Venerate.

This made everyone grit their teeth. ‘You are too crazy, you even dare to make a move against a Heavenly Venerate?’

“Impudence!!” That Heavenly Venerate finally became furious. He beckoned with his hand, and a Heavenly Venerate Tool promptly fell into his palm. It was an ancient mirror. With a light exclamation, he aimed the ancient mirror at Wu Haoyang, and a beam of light shot out immediately.

“Wu!” Wu Haoyang underestimated his opponent. He neither dodged nor avoided the shot at all, and was directly hit by the light, which caused him to fall down immediately, and he stumbled on his feet.

A First Tier Heavenly Venerate couldn’t hurt him, but that didn’t mean that the same was true for a Heavenly Venerate Tool.

That Heavenly Venerate took advantage of the success to deliver the next move. He came up towards Wu Haoyang in a single stride, and swung the ancient mirror at him like a hammer. Peng, there was a muffled sound as Wu Haoyang was hit by this blow as well, and directly fell to the ground.

This place suppressed the cultivation level. In fact, there was no difference in battle prowess between the First Tier Heavenly Venerate and Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate; the most would be that First Tier Heavenly Venerate was able to constantly channel a Heavenly Venerate Technique, and would definitely win against all Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates in a long, drawn-out battle.

However, Wu Haoyang originally would have nothing to fear. Who asked him to be so crazy? As a result, was hit by the Heavenly Venerate Tool, bringing about his instantaneous defeat.
