Chapter 2206: Won’t laugh?

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Cheng Qi suddenly felt a chill rise up from the depths of his heart, spreading to all his limbs and veins.

Hu Niu had dispersed his attack just by blowing a single breath. Though he was slightly surprised, he had not taken it too seriously, because that had been just a casual strike from him, but the last attack had been backed with his full power.

She had not used any kind of celestial technique, and had just simply dashed in front of him, her expression filled with curiosity. How could this not be terrifying?

To say nothing of him, the people at the gates were all dumbstruck.

This woman… Could it be that she was a wolf in sheep’s clothing?

Yet Hu Niu did not take it to heart at all. Her face was filled with curiosity. “You really won’t laugh? Then, wouldn’t that be too boring?”

“Laugh your head!” Cheng Qi roared furiously, suddenly raising his palm, and striking out at Hu Niu.

Pa, Hu Niu stretched out a hand, and caught Cheng Qi’s wrist. Displeased, she said, “You, Niu is asking a question, what kind of attitude is that? Are you displeased with Niu? If you’re displeased, just say it, or how would Niu know? Don’t think that you are so awesome just because you have a poker face. Niu can do it too!”

As expected, she put on a straight, blank expression, facing off against Cheng Qi.

The little girl had never admitted defeat to anyone, and was very intrigued by novelties. This was a little like Xiao Gu.

Cheng Qi really wanted to cry, but had no tears. His reaction was very normal, all right? However, this indescribably beautiful woman in front of him was clearly an unreasonable character. Furthermore, how could he bring himself to beg for mercy in full public like this?

“Let me warn you, this is the Saintly Origin Academy!” he exclaimed loudly, which could be considered a covert way of giving in.

“Niu knows where this is, of course. Why do you still have to tell Niu?” Hu Niu slanted her head to one side, and thought for a moment. Then, she couldn’t help but become angry. “What you mean is Niu is very stupid, that Niu doesn’t even know where this is?”

Cheng Qi couldn’t help but be completely dumbfounded. Those words could be comprehended in that manner?

‘What kind of brain do you f****** have?’

“Aiyo!” He had not even finished the thought when his face had sustained a punch, so painful that even his tears were streaming.?Peng, the shadowy fist flew towards him again. When the punch landed, he was directly dazed and completely out of his wits.

Hu Niu gripped the front of Cheng Qi’s robes like she was dragging a dead dog. Then, she swept a glance over the surrounding people, and asked viciously, “You all think that Niu is foolish?”

“Wu!” Everyone couldn’t help but shake their head. This little girl was presently a bringer of calamity, so it was best not to anger her.

“That’s right, Niu is very smart!” Hu Niu was immediately all smiles. She got angry very easily, but was also easily pleased.

Pa, she casually tossed Cheng Qi out. “Not even knowing how to laugh, so boring!”

“Brother!” Cheng Liang hurriedly ran over, helping to support his elder brother. Thankfully, Hu Niu had only punched him twice, and while Cheng Qi had been temporarily knocked out, his core had not been hurt. Thus, after Cheng Liang shook him a few times, Cheng Qi slowly regained consciousness.

“I can laugh!” Cheng Qi revealed a silly smile, his head slightly turning.

Right, he had been beaten silly, and he hadn’t gotten all his wits back yet.

“Yi, so ugly, no wonder you never smile!” Hu Niu shuddered, her expression filled with disgust.

“Brother, wake up!” Cheng Liang hurriedly tried to shake Cheng Qi’s shoulders as much as possible.

A few shakes later, Cheng Qi’s eyes finally cleared up. He was first enraged, then overcome with fear, and finally his face flushed bright red. To be embarrassed and show such a foolish side of himself at the academy gates was probably going to be an eternal stain on his reputation.

This grudge… was huge!

Without a second word, he directly ran towards the academy gates.

“Brother!” Cheng Liang hurriedly set off in pursuit, and right when he was about to enter, he turned his head, and said to Ling Han and his group, “If you have the guts, just wait right there!” Seeing Hu Niu raise her little fist, he hurriedly broke into a run.

Ling Han simply took out a table and chairs, and then brewed some tea. The four of them sat down, and began to sip tea. However, Hu Niu did not have that kind of elegant taste at all. Very soon, she took out fish, meat, and so on, and began wolfing down her food without care.

“I say, brother, so you have hidden talents! However, Cheng Qi has long since sided with Huang Yishan. He is a Heaven Soul monarch tier, so do you think you can still stand against him?” Another came out to inform him.

“That’s right. You had best leave quickly.”

“The Saintly Origin Academy is not a place for you to be impudent. All the prodigies of the entire Celestial Realm are here, so how could it be that you guys are going to defeat the whole world then?”

Though speaking such words were meant as a blow to Ling Han and his group, it was also a word of advice. However, some people were very mean, encouraging Ling Han and his group to continue to stay and fight.

Ling Han naturally would not mind the opinions of others. He merely smiled slightly, and sipped tea with the Rain Emperor and the Empress. As for Hu Niu… sigh, she would just continue to eat.

Not long after, someone came out of the academy again.

This time, it was not just two people, but over a dozen of them, and all of them were striding majestically, exuding a domineering air that vied for supremacy.

Monarch tier, monarch tier, monarch tier… They were all monarch tiers, except for Cheng Liang and Cheng Qi, of course.

Did these brothers have such strong connections that they could mobilize over a dozen monarch tiers?

Of course not. They returned to ask for Huang Yishan’s help, and when they asked their boss for help, it just so happened that Huang Yishan had invited over a dozen monarch tiers to discuss cultivation with him. When they heard of this matter, they all came out.

…The majority of them had merely come to watch the excitement.

Ling Han’s eyes swept over them, and a hint of smile involuntarily showed on his face. Among these over one dozen people, there were actually two that were his newly recruited lackeys, Gu Yushu and Dan Hao. They had both signed slavery contracts, promising to follow him for 10,000 years.

These two people naturally spotted Ling Han as well, and their cheeks involuntarily twitched. They were both prodigies of the present generation, noble and proud monarch tiers, so they naturally did not want others to know that they had become someone else’s followers, even if it was just for 10,000 years.

Huang Yishan strode out. There was no need for Cheng Qi and his brother to make introductions at all. Ling Han and his group were too arrogant, just simply setting up a table and sipping tea in front of the academy gates. Even a blind man would be dazzled by this kind of showy brilliance.

“I know what you want to say.” Before Huang Yishan had the chance to speak, Ling Han sipped some tea, then put down his tea cup, and said, “Isn’t it just going to be something like telling me to leave behind an arm or a leg, and then kneel down and apologize? Sigh, such stereotypical behavior. Could you try something new? If it goes on like this, the audience will get bored of this flavor.”

When they heard these words, the people in the surroundings all laughed, feeling that Ling Han was really outrageously bold, actually daring to be so insolent even in front of Huang Yishan.

Huang Yishan showed an expression that was both embarrassed and furious. He had truly planned to force Ling Han to kneel down in apology, and the latter would basically refuse, after which Huang Yishan could move, and then beat the opponent into kneeling on the ground, perfectly resolving this matter.

But Ling Han didn’t go by the rules, and said all this before he had the chance to. Then, even if he did beat Ling Han up, it would not be anything honorable, either.

“What a sharp tongue!” Huang Yishan said coldly.

“Er, Brother Huang…” Gu Yushu spoke up. “Harmony is to be prized in all situations, so why don’t we just stop here.”

‘Harmony is to be prized?’ Huang Yishan almost spluttered. ‘Who does not know that you, Gu Yushu, have been the proudest and most arrogant? If anyone has not greeted you respectfully enough, you would be angered beyond reason, determined to beat the offender up.

‘And now you are actually telling me that harmony is to be prized?

‘Have you lost your senses?’

“Hehe.” He chuckled coldly. If it was not for the fact that he was on amicable terms with Gu Yushu, he’d really want to slap the latter.. ‘F***, my lackey has been beaten up, and you are telling me that harmony is to be prized. Then what would that make me?’
