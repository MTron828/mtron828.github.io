Chapter 1259 Vicious Nature Revealed

Yan Jun and the five others exchanged a hesitant glance.

The behavior of this person was far too strange. Even if he were truly backing down, shouldn’t he have thrown the Realm Spirit Stones onto the ground and frantically run away?

‘Is he messing with us right now?

‘But there’s an elite at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier before him! Does he still dare to mess around?’

One of the youths walked over, and said, “Fine, hand them to me!”

There was a hint of ambition in his eyes. If he could personally bring these two Realm Spirit Stones back, his standing in the sect would definitely rise significantly.

The key was that Founder Mao was only one step away from advancing to the Heavenly Body Tier. If he could contribute to his advance, he would definitely be viewed in a new light by Founder Mao.

If he were held in high regard by a Heavenly Body Tier elite, just how incredible would that be?

After taking a step, he immediately took a second, and then a third. He arrived before Ling Han and grabbed at the two Realm Spirit Stones.

“Sigh!” Ling Han sighed as he slightly curled a finger.

Xiu!

A burst of Sword Qi instantly swept outward.

“Impudent!” the youth roared. He knew that Ling Han was very powerful, so much so that he could even suppress Yan Jun. However, his cultivation level had already reached the peak stage of the medium extreme, and he was more so a one-star genius. In other words, he was slightly stronger than Yan Jun.

Thus, Ling Han wouldn’t necessarily be able to defeat him even if he could defeat Yan Jun. Anyhow, even if Ling Han could defeat him, he would still have the ability to protect himself. It was because of thinking like this that he dared to step forward. Otherwise, what would he do if Ling Han was a stubborn fool who wanted to drag others down with him?

However, he was still surprised that Ling Han actually dared to attack him!

Although he was already mentally prepared for this, he still couldn’t help but feel furious upon seeing the burst of sword light sweeping toward him.

He raised a hand to block the sword light. ‘There’s a consummate level elite standing behind me right now, so you’re merely seeking death by attacking me. Just wait to be suppressed!’

However, the consummate level elder was shocked upon seeing Ling Han’s attack. He hurriedly reached over, and shouted, “Stop!”

It was already too late!

A burst of sword light slashed over.

Pu!

Blood sprayed through the air, and four of the youth’s fingers were instantly sliced off. They flew into the surroundings like flowers scattered by a divine maiden.

“Aaah!” The youth instantly started to wail in agony.

Ling Han activated the Star Plucking Step and evaded the elder’s counterattack at an incredible speed. He smiled, and said, “Ah, your fingers have been severed! How are you going to collect the Realm Spirit Stones now?”

“Brat, you’re really asking for death!” the elder said, a dark expression on his face.

This brat was surrounded, yet he still dared to resist stubbornly! He was seeking death!

Ling Han laughed, and said, “It’s still too early to say who’s going to live, and who’s going to die!”

“Young man, you’re far too arrogant!” the elder said with a humph. Streaks of divine patterns appeared as he grabbed at Ling Han, and his hand transformed into a ‘five finger mountain’ that descended from the sky.

This elder’s name was Qian Sen, and he was a higher-up of the Blazing Inferno Sect. Right now, Founder Mao genuinely had a chance to reach the Heavenly Body Tier. This naturally became the most important matter in the sect, and thus everyone ventured out to search for Realm Spirit Stones.

Being on the doorstep of the Heavenly Body Tier and actually advancing to the Heavenly Body Tier were two completely different matters. The Blazing Inferno Sect was only a small Sun Moon Tier force, so the appearance of a Heavenly Body Tier elite would definitely elevate the status of their sect.

In order to achieve this, the Blazing Inferno Sect was truly going all out to obtain Realm Spirit Stones.

Ling Han glared at the elder, and a burst of heaven’s might instantly surged from his body.

Weng!

The formidable might surged into the surroundings.

“What’s going on?!”

“Why did my power suddenly fall significantly?!”

“Heavens!”

Yan Jun and the others all cried out in astonishment. Even the descending hand of Qian Sen veered slightly off its path. However, this hand was far too large, so it didn’t matter even if it veered off. It was still bearing down on Ling Han.

Ling Han formed a fist and launched a punch at the “five finger mountain” in the sky. The power of his fist gathered and condensed into a dot.

Pu!

The “five finger mountain” crashed down, yet a streak of divine light soared into the sky. A hole had been blasted in the large hand. Through this hole, the dazzling light of a fist could be seen.

Qian Sen gave a muffled groan. Although the “five finger mountain” had been formed from his Origin Power, his hand had still suffered a slight backlash when the “five finger mountain” had been penetrated. A searing pain burned through his palm, leaving an angry red mark.

He was slightly stunned. The power of this young man was incredible—it was actually able to penetrate his defenses and injure his actual body!

Of course, this was partly because he had underestimated Ling Han as well. The area covered by his attack had been far too large, meaning his power was dispersed over a very large area. Even if he were hundreds or thousands of times more powerful than Ling Han, attacking in such a way would still yield very poor results.

On the other hand, if he had concentrated his power in a single point as Ling Han had, the effects of heaven’s might would have caused him to completely miss his target.

“Young man, you’re fairly impressive, huh?” he said in a menacing voice. Although he was praising Ling Han, the killing intent in his voice couldn’t be hidden.

Ling Han smiled modestly, and said, “My power is only so-so. There’s no need for you to praise me like this, old sir. You’ll only make me arrogant, which is a big no-no for young people.”

Qian Sen’s expression finally changed. Ling Han’s calm demeanor caused fury to well up in his mind.

“You’re seeking death!” He widened his left eye, which surprisingly transformed into a cave of blazing flames. He then reached a hand inside and retrieved a Divine Sword that was bathed in scorching flames. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Nurturing a God Tool with one’s own body would elevate the might of the God Tool to an extreme. However, doing this also came with a significant drawback. While growing, the God Tool would absorb its host’s blood essence, thereby affecting the host’s own advancement.

However, to people like Qian Sen—who was already at the peak stage of the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier and had no more room for advancement—consuming a bit of blood essence was no big deal. The consumed blood essence could be replenished after cultivating for a short while.

Qian Sen had obtained this Divine Sword 100 or so years ago. It was then that he had saved up enough to purchase a block of Level Eight Godly metal. He had gotten someone to forge it into a sword for him, and then he had placed it inside his body to nurture. Although it had only been a century or so, his Divine Sword had already reached the stage of Great Accomplishment.

With this Divine Sword in hand, he was confident that he could defeat most consummate level elites.

A suitable God Tool would aid a cultivator immensely.

“Scorching Flames Burn the Heart!” Qian Sen slashed his sword, and a ball of scorching flames transformed into a streak of light that pierced at Ling Han’s chest. Because of its devastating temperature, the streak of light caused ripples of distortion to appear in the air surrounding it. Then, these pockets of air all burst into flames.

This was utterly terrifying. To say nothing of touching these flames, just being consumed by the devastating heat waves that they emitted would be enough to wound elites at the early stage of the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier.

The others all retreated, afraid that they would be licked by the flames. If that were to happen, they would die before even knowing what had hit them.

However, Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh.

Perhaps he would’ve been slightly afraid if Qian Sen had used poisonous liquid or formidable weapons to attack him. After all, Qian Sen was an elite at the consummate level of the Sun Moon Tier. However, he had unleashed a flame-element attack... One had to remember that Ling Han had been burned by immortal flames before. It was also in the immortal flames that he had comprehended the secret technique, Rising From The Ashes.

If one wanted to defeat him with fire, their cultivation level needed to be at least one major tier above his.
