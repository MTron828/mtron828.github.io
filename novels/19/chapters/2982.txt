2983 Losers Need to Pay Up

If Ling Han’s physique was inferior, then he would choose not to battle against his opponents head-on. This was very simple logic.

However, after increasing the distance between himself and Xin Qinhu, his attacks using the weapons formed from his energy were naturally far weaker than before.

Meanwhile, Xin Qihu displayed his might and courage as a supreme prodigy. He charged through Ling Han’s attacks, and ferociously closed the distance between them.

Peng, peng, peng!

His palms were like battle axes as they slashed aside Ling Han’s relentless attacks.

Xin Qihu roared with laughter, and sneered, “Ling Han, your power is equivalent to mine, yet your physique is so much weaker. That being the case, how are you going to rival me?”

At this moment, he had already arrived before Ling Han.

“Relying on this!” Ling Han replied.

Boom!

Tens of thousands of dimensions materialized around him, illuminating the sky.

Xin Qihu was instantly affected, with his body shuddering slightly. With tens of thousands of medium-level dimensions—most of them nearing the high-level—bearing down on him, even his Seventh-Tier battle prowess couldn’t remain unaffected.

Ling Han seized this opportunity to charge over and throw a ferocious punch at his face.

Indeed, his act of retreating had only been a guise to appear weak.

Xin Qihu hurriedly crossed his arms before his face to block this strike.

Peng!

Xin Qihu was instantly sent flying by this forceful punch. However, he quickly replied with a dozen punches of his own, forcefully stopping his retreat.

“You truly are a freak!” Xin Qihu exclaimed. He could barely believe what he was seeing. He had battled against Feng Wuding before, and Feng Wuding had possessed 100 dimensions. Even though this had allowed Feng Wuding to suppress Xin Qihu, his advantage hadn’t been all that obvious. Xin Qihu had still had the ability to rival the other party. After all, he had an advantage in terms of cultivation level.

However, Ling Han possessed far too many dimensions—so many that Xin Qinhu was too embarrassed to summon his two dimensions and end up humiliating himself!

“Come again!” Ling Han roared with a soaring fighting spirit. The memory of Xin Qihu and Wu Haoyang rushing over to save him suddenly flashed past his mind. However, it was a shame that the three of them would most likely never fight side by side again.

The two of them continued to battle, and Xin Qihu started to feel a little apprehensive. However, he didn’t dare to get too close to Ling Han, either.

Different from the close-quarter battle before, they were now engaged in a long-range battle.

If they were facing different opponents, what would it matter that they were attacking from range? With Ling Han’s and Xin Qihu’s Seventh-Tier battle prowess, even Sixth Tier elites would be severely wounded if not instantly killed if they were to face these attacks.

However, the issue was that both of them possessed Seventh-Tier battle prowess. This caused the battle between them to appear ferocious, yet neither of them was actually able to wound the other.

This caused Ling Han to feel a slight sense of appreciation for his opponent’s talent. However, his dominant feeling was still one of unbridled fury.

‘This bloody bastard!’

“Ling Han!” someone suddenly roared in a cold voice.

Ling Han looked over, only to see Feng Wuding rushing over from the distance.

His face was filled with rage. In their most recent battle, their cultivation levels had been the same, yet he hadn’t been able to withstand a single strike from Ling Han. He couldn’t bring himself to accept this. This was like a thorn in his heart, and it had almost prevented him from advancing to the Fifth Tier.

He was going to seek revenge! Revenge!

“What are you shouting about? Piss off!” Ling Han roared. He ignored Xin Qihu and charged at Feng Wuding instead. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Unexpectedly, Xin Qihu didn’t give chase. Instead, he stood there with his arms crossed, and it was as if he were going to simply spectate.

Feng Wuding bellowed in fury before unleashing a punch. The four fundamental powers transformed into sabers, swords, axes, and polearms as they surged toward Ling Han.

‘Huh? This is Shatter Mountains’ technique.’

Ling Han was slightly astonished. This old bastard truly did take good care of Feng Wuding. He had even taught this secret technique to him!

However, what did this matter? Feng Wuding wasn’t the old bastard Shatter Mountains, after all.

Ling Han was unafraid as he faced this attack head-on. He channeled all of his seventh-grade seals, increasing his power by almost 2000-fold.

This was utterly terrifying. If the Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate didn’t channel his Heavenly Venerable Seals, even he would have to admit that he was no match for Ling Han.

Peng!

The four types of weapons immediately shattered, transforming into countless broken shards. Regardless of what Feng Wuding threw at Ling Han, all of his attacks would be obliterated before this absolute power.

Shock and surprise washed across Feng Wuding’s face. They were both at the Fifth Tier, and they both possessed a battle prowess at the Seventh Tier, so why was he still unable to rival Ling Han?

He hurriedly summoned 100 dimensions.

Weng, weng, weng!

The high-level dimensions rose one by one, all of them shrouded in a peculiar light as they radiated a terrifying pressure.

Even though Feng Wuding had summoned far fewer dimensions than Ling Han, this actually didn’t matter too much, since neither of them had reached the peak cultivation level yet. Instead, Feng Wuding was under far less pressure because he only needed to concentrate on cultivating 100 dimensions. As such, he could potentially cultivate each of these dimensions to a higher level. Of course, the prerequisite was that his dimensions could withstand reaching a higher level.

As he was the Son of Destiny of the Genesis World of the last era, it was clear that Feng Wuding possessed this ability.

His dimensions had become—or were infinitesimally close to becoming—high-level dimensions. With all 100 of them unleashed at once, the might that they radiated was indeed quite terrifying.

Ling Han humphed before also summoning 100 dimensions. There was no need for too many, as he simply needed to negate the pressure being exuded by Feng Wuding’s dimensions.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The two of them clashed, and Ling Han was no longer at a disadvantage in terms of his physique. Meanwhile, he was more so enjoying a huge advantage in terms of his power. This instantly caused Feng Wuding to question his life.

Why was it like this?

Why was he always suppressed by Ling Han? Was it going to remain this way forever?

Feng Wuding lost his confidence for the first time. His battle prowess had already reached the Seventh Tier at this moment, yet he was still no match for Ling Han. What in the world did he need to do to overcome this great opponent?

Losing his concentration for a moment, Feng Wuding was instantly struck by a powerful punch, which caused him to go flying back.

He battled against Ling Han time and time again, and he was defeated by Ling Han time and time again.

Feng Wuding forcefully stopped himself, his face filled with dejection and despondence. Was Ling Han his nemesis?

However, as a supreme prodigy who was second to only Ling Han, Feng Wuding quickly rediscovered his confidence again.

No, he could defeat Ling Han as long as he advanced to the Sixth Tier or the Seventh Tier before him. This was especially the case for the Seventh Tier.

Seventh Tier elites were indestructible and undying, with their physiques also being invincible. Thus, if he advanced to the Seventh Tier first, he could simply exhaust Ling Han to death.

There was a bright glimmer in his eyes, and he was instantly filled with a burning fighting spirit.

Ling Han hesitated for a moment. Should he kill this person?

After contemplating this for a brief moment, he decided to spare Feng Wuding.

This was a defeated foe, after all, so did Ling Han need to worry about him overtaking him in the future?

This was simply impossible, even if the person was Feng Wuding, a supreme prodigy who was second to only him.

“Piss off! And remember to keep your distance if you see me in the future. Otherwise, I’ll pummel you every time I see you!” Ling Han said.

He had decided against killing Feng Wuding because Hysteria was becoming increasingly powerful. Moreover, there was also the mysterious Extermination, so the Genesis World was in desperate need of more Seventh Tier elites.

Feng Wuding gritted his teeth and didn’t retort Ling Han. Since his strength was inferior, anything that he said would only bring more humiliation to himself.

“Oh, that’s right.” Ling Han waved his hand, and said, “The same rules as always. Give me all your treasures.”

He had almost forgotten that Feng Wuding was a wealth-delivering boy. How could he let him off the hook so easily?

Feng Wuding’s jaws dropped a little. ‘You still want to rob me?’

“Either you hand the treasures over yourself, or I’ll cripple you and then search for the treasures myself. It’s up to you,” Ling Han said casually, giving his opponent two options.

Feng Wuding gritted his teeth and waved a hand at Ling Han, instantly tossing a dozen or so Great Herbs over.
