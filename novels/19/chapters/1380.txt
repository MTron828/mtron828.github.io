Chapter 1381 Fighting Lin Zihong

The golden carp once again leaped out of the water, and spat out a black bubble as well.

Ling Han’s right hand grabbed out at empty air, and that giant hand of Origin Power also clenched. Boom, a powerful wave instantly rose up in the pool, slamming down onto that carp. Due to the powerful attack, the carp was suddenly sent flying. It opened its mouth and spat out a human being.

It was precisely the young man that it had swallowed before. The moment he appeared, he screamed in agony. Apparently, the majority of the flesh and blood on his body had been corroded by the carp’s stomach acid.

This carp would first directly swallow living humans, then digest them slowly with its stomach acid. It could be imagined how much agonizing pain this young man had sustained. Thankfully, as long as his spirit was not destroyed and his dantian was not ruined, no matter how serious his injuries, there was still a chance he could recover.

Seeing this scene, the six people on the poolside were all stunned, bowled over by Ling Han’s abilities.

He was too strong. It was merely an embodiment of Origin Power, and he easily defeated the carp with it. This was an overwhelming level of strength.

The six people immediately abandoned their thoughts of trying to snatch the Divine Lotus by force. Hurriedly, they turned and left, fearing that Ling Han would kill them off so that they would not leak out his secret.

“I never thought that this Ancient Dao Green Lotus would end up in the hands of an outsider like you.” A figure swept past, and Lin Zihong was standing by the side of the pool. Looking at him arrogantly, he declared, “Hand over the Divine Lotus!”

“Then what?” Ling Han asked calmly. He had provoked him time and time again; did he really think that he didn’t have a temper?

“And then...” It seemed like Lin Zihong had not expected that Ling Han would counter with a question like this, so he was initially blank before he declared, “And then, kneel on the ground, and give me 100 kowtows!”

Ling Han looked at the other party, and asked, “I don’t seem to have offended you, right?”

“Hehe, you actually dare bear designs on a woman that I have my eye on, and you still dare say you have not offended me?” Lin Zihong asked, smirking coldly. Only he and Ling Han were here, so he naturally did not bother to further conceal his inner thoughts.

Ling Han gave an ‘oh’, and said, “Going by that theory, you are determined to kill me then?”

“You won’t get off so easily!” Lin Zihong smirked. “I will first destroy your physical body, then slowly refine your divine sense, and let you die in an incredibly agonizing manner!”

Ling Han gave an ‘oh’, broke into a smile, and asked, “Since you are saying that, I can also boldly kill you without worries, and need not be concerned if I am too heavy-handed in my attack.”

“Haha, you are merely in the low extreme; how could you be a match for me?” Lin Zihong smiled proudly. “I am at the peak stage of the medium extreme, and furthermore, I am a three-star genius. Even if you are a four-star genius, and are at the peak stage of the low extreme, you are far from becoming a worthy match for me.”

He was so sure that Ling Han would definitely not be an equal match for him, and that was why he was acting so overbearing.

Ling Han murmured, “Since you are so confident in yourself, if you get your words thrown back at you later, you had better not cry!”

“Who asked you to have so little insight, daring attempt to snatch my woman!” Lin Zihong made a move, and grabbed out at Ling Han. His power rolled out and reached the height of the late stage of the high extreme. It was extremely frightening.

But the heaven and earth here was much sturdier than the outside world, and even if a Heavenly Body Tier attacked, there would not be any damage. Only slight ripples were created on the water surface.

Lin Zihong’s face was filled with contempt. He was confident enough that he could suppress Ling Han with a single strike. The gap in cultivation level between the two of them was really much too big.

Ling Han also brandished a fist out at Lin Zihong. Peng, the power of both sides clashed, and finally formed a massive impact that caused waves to erupt on the water surface as they rolled out unhindered and fiercely.

“Yi!?” Lin Zihong’s whole expression was filled with shock. Ling Han actually managed to parry this strike from him.

Not only had he parried it, it was done with much ease.

This was something he could not accept. The other was merely in the low extreme, so how could he possibly be this strong?

In terms of power, Ling Han was indeed no match for Lin Zihong. However, he had used Tide of the Ages. Though he had only released a slight bit of its might, it was enough to age the latter’s power to a level that he could hold up against.

“How could this be!” Lin Zihong could not accept it. “A mere low extreme cultivator, how could you possibly be capable of standing against me!”

“Ignorant fool!” Ling Han’s eyes became menacing. His killing intent had already been ignited.

“Humph!” Lin Zihong soon adjusted his way of thinking. So what if he could contend against him? He was the son of the clan patriarch of the Anyuan Branch. Though this branch had indeed declined, a starving camel was still bigger than a horse. His background was still incredibly astonishing, so how could it be matched by a “savage”?

He drew out a drum. It was very old and dilapidated, and it was visible that one corner of it was already broken. Images of battles were drawn on the body of the drum, vivid and lifelike, exuding the killing aura that was unique to the battlefield.

Tong!

He stretched out his hand and clapped onto the drum. Immediately, a low rumble was heard from the battle drum, and shot towards Ling Han’s chest like an arrow, causing his heart to involuntarily beat very rapidly for a while.

A sliver of blood seeped out of the corner of Ling Han’s lips. He shockingly discovered that a hole had actually been torn in his heart.

This was extremely astonishing.

With how astonishing his physique was, though the strength of his heart could not be compared to the sturdiness of his Godly bones, it had almost reached the extent of Level 10 Godly metal, and now it had actually ruptured.

This drum... was not so simple!

More importantly, Ling Han had been struck without his knowledge. He completely had not discovered where the attack had come from, and this was truly the most bizarre aspect of it; it could not be guarded against.

“Haha, you want to fight me, you are unqualified!” Lin Zihong smirked coldly, his eyes focused on Ling Han. He suddenly delivered a palm strike.

Pu!

This time, Ling Han spat out a mouthful of blood.

“Die!” Lin Zihong once again raised his hand, but just at this moment, Ling Han moved. He used the Star Plucking Step, and had crossed the distance of more than 20 meters in an instant.

Tong, the battle drum once again rang out loudly, but Ling Han was not the slightest bit affected.

“As expected.” Ling Han smiled. With the channeling of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, his heart had already recovered. “The drumbeat is shapeless, and cannot be avoided, but that is merely an object, after all. It needs to lock down on its target, so as long as I avoid being locked down by your divine sense, the battle drum would be able to do nothing against me.”

‘You monster!’

Lin Zihong was dumbfounded. He had actually found the loophole in his attack after being hit twice only; was he really human? Furthermore, this guy had sustained two consecutive hits from the drumbeats, and he actually just spat out a mouthful of blood. His heart, though, had not exploded. This was too ridiculous.

“It’s my turn!” Ling Han drew his sword. Weng, the Divine Demon Sword seemed to have been provoked, and without waiting for Ling Han to issue a command, it exuded divine light by itself, seeming to be extremely restless.

Ling Han simply let go, and the Divine Demon Sword instantly flew out, slashing out towards Lin Zihong.

To be more specific, it was slicing out at that battle drum.

Tong! Tong! Tong!

Lin Zihong hurriedly struck the battle drum. It was not only capable of killing living beings, it also had terrifying destructive effects on God Tools. The sound wave that could not be seen nor touched swept out towards the Divine Demon Sword.

This was the power of Regulations!

This battle drum had been forged by an old ancestor in the Eternal River Tier of the Anyuan Branch. It could only be stimulated by someone who was at least in the Heavenly Body Tier. It made use of the Regulations of sound waves to hurt one’s enemies, shapeless and formless, and it was one of the three precious treasures of the Anyuan Branch.

It was also because Lin Zihong was the single son of the present clan patriarch. If not, how could he possibly have been allowed to bring it out? Otherwise, what if they encountered an Eternal River Tier elite who snatched it away by force? Then the Anyuan Branch that had been initially declining would only become worse.

The Divine Demon Sword struck out, and was actually not affected in the slightest.
