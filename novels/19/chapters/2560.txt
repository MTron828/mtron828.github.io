Chapter 2561: First Battle

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The Tournament of Death was just as its name stated. Since its inception, countless Celestial Kings had already been killed. Indeed, the stadium in which it was held was the most renowned land of death in the entire city. At the same time, it was also its most popular spot.

Upon being consigned to this tournament, one would be in danger of death at all times. Thus, each person would become wild and savage. They would be filled with excitement upon seeing others bleeding and wounded, or even dead.

Moreover, the cultivation speed of these people was also especially quick. It was as if heaven and earth were compensating them. Those who had the potential to become a Celestial King would all ascend to the Celestial King Tier at an astonishing speed. Of course, there were also those who were less gifted, and they would quickly become stuck at the Mountain River Tier, Severing Mundane Tier, and so on.

Thus, even though Celestial Kings were killed all the time, the number of Celestial Kings always remained consistently high. Firstly, there were Celestial Kings who had been banished here from the outside world. Secondly, there were Celestial Kings who were indigenous to this land.

Ling Han sighed with emotion. Perhaps only transcendent dimensions could produce such an environment. Otherwise, even taking into account the Celestial Kings who were battling against the Foreign Realm, the Celestial Realm only had several tens of thousands of Celestial Kings. This was at most the same as the number in this city.

It would be foolish to underestimate the difficulty of winning 10 battles in a row and becoming the Blood Martial King. This was unfathomably difficult.

This was because winning the first five battles in a row would be easy. However, after reaching this number, the tournament officials would start to target such participants, sending out elites to hunt them down. In fact, in the final battle, they might even send out a Blood Martial King to battle against them.

Of course, the opposing Celestial Kings would be at the same cultivation level. At most, there would only be a gap of one minor tier between them. However, in such situations, one could choose to reject the battle and request a different opponent.

However, they could only do this a maximum of three times. Otherwise, their streak would be reset to zero.

Above the Blood Martial King, there was also the Hundred Victory Blood Martial King and the Thousand Victory Blood Martial King. These titles didn’t require a victory streak. Instead, they only required one to win 100 battles or 1000 battles, respectively.

In the Celestial King Graveyard, it wasn’t only Ghost King City that enjoyed this kind of Tournament of Death. Moreover, young masters like Tang Yuan would also take pride in having a Blood Martial King under their wing. They would oftentimes send their Blood Martial King to battle with the Blood Martial King of someone else.

Tang Yuan had already owned a Blood Martial King before. Moreover, this Blood Martial King had achieved 97 victories. However, as he was charging toward the title of Hundred Victory Blood Martial King, he had been targeted and killed by the force of another young master in the city. Tang Yuan had lost a lot of face because of this, and it also pushed him to have several fierce battles with that young master.

That young master was Lu Li, the son of another Ninth Heaven Celestial King of the city, Lu Gaoquan. That young master was also a depraved wretch, and he had poisoned the alcohol of Tang Yuan’s Blood Martial King, causing his battle prowess to fall dramatically. In the end, this Blood Martial King was unable to escape death.

These two young masters had already been at odds because of the conflict and animosity between their fathers. After this event, they became even more hostile, breaking into a fight each time they came across each other. It was just that no one else was killed.

As for Luo Yang and the others, they were also second-generation young masters. Their parents were either Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings or Seventh Heaven Celestial Kings, and these Celestial Kings were all underlings of Tang Yuan’s father, Tang Mingbo. Thus, they all treated Tang Yuan as their leader. This was an interest group where glory and humiliation were shared.

“Li Long, if you manage to kill the Blood Martial King of that bastard Lu Li, I’ll reward you with another Ascending Dragon Pill!” Tang Yuan shouted in a drunken stupor. He promised Ling Han even more rewards.

Ling Han replied with a faint smile. His Evolution Index had already reached 12, so did he really need any Ascending Dragon Pills?

However, he certainly wasn’t against obtaining some to examine.

Luo Yang and the others were extremely jealous. However, they immediately thought of the immense difficulty of becoming a Blood Martial King, and they immediately recalled the sly and sinister nature of Lu Li. Once he learned of Ling Han’s existence, he would definitely launch a deadly assault.

To say nothing of killing Lu Li’s Blood Martial King, becoming a Blood Martial King was already a profound challenge.

It was only a matter of time before Ling Han lost his head.

They all sneered in their minds. Would an Ascending Dragon Pill be so easy to obtain?

Ling Han didn’t return to the inn. After all, second-generation young masters like Tang Yuan also understood how to win over their underlings. He organized a courtyard for Ling Han, and he even sent over three beautiful maidservants to accompany him. However, they were naturally rejected by Ling Han.

Even though Tang Yuan was astonished by this—there was actually a man who wasn’t interested in beautiful women—this also caused him to hold Ling Han in higher regard. He was filled with anticipation.

Tang Yuan was a fairly powerful person in the city, so under his instructions, he disrupted the tournament’s original schedule and forcefully slid Ling Han in.

Three days later, Ling Han appeared in the stadium.

“Li Long, you need to win some honor for this young master!” Tang Yuan said to Ling Han in the resting area. “I’ve put a huge wager on you, so if you dare to lose, you either die in the arena, or I’ll personally kill you and hang your head on the flag in the stadium.”

After becoming sober, Tang Yuan immediately started to show his cruel and domineering side. Whoever disappointed him would be punished with death. This was his iron rule.

Ling Han felt a strong urge to kill Tang Yuan. However, he forcefully suppressed this urge. He promised himself that he would definitely kill this young master before he left the Celestial King Graveyard. Did Tang Yuan truly think that he could act with wanton freedom just because his father was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King?

Tang Yuan naturally couldn’t read Ling Han’s mind. Otherwise, he would definitely sentence Ling Han to death. Upon seeing Ling Han become speechless, he simply thought that Ling Han had been frightened by his threat. He involuntarily smiled in satisfaction.

“However, if you perform well, I won’t mistreat you, either. I’ll reward you with what you deserve!” His tone suddenly changed. After issuing a threat, he then hung a carrot before Ling Han.

Ling Han couldn’t be bothered responding. When the drums started to beat, he strode out of the resting area and into the arena.

Since this stadium allowed Celestial Kings to do battle, its defensive mechanisms were naturally extremely powerful. Otherwise, just a single blow from a Celestial King could obliterate this entire stadium.

Ling Han had already witnessed the toughness of the rock here. When he had struck Luo Yang, the latter had surprisingly come to a stop after smashing only a single rock. This was proof enough of their sturdy nature.

Was this done by the Heavenly Venerates to prevent the Celestial Kings here from escaping, and so the rocks and earth here were all extremely sturdy?

Ling Han’s mind ran wild. At this moment, his opponent appeared from the other end.

“On the black side, we have Li Long! This is a competitor personally chosen by Tang Yuan, Young Master Tang. He’s at the Third Heaven, but his strength is also unknown. Open your eyes, everyone, witness his strength for yourself!” the commentator said loudly. He was also a Celestial King. Even though he was only at the First Heaven, it wasn’t difficult for his voice to reach every corner of the stadium.

His commentary was also filled with passion and enthusiasm, and he instantly enlivened the atmosphere in the stadium, eliciting a series of shouts and whistles. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“On the red side, we have a familiar competitor!” the commentator continued. “Ebony, a prodigy from the Tanya Realm! He possesses a terrifying weapon, and he has the title of Demonic Saw Killer! He’s already won four battles in a row!

“Today, will Li Long end Ebony’s streak, or will Ebony add to his incredible run? If Ebony wins another battle, he’ll become a true challenger for the title of Blood Martial King!

“Is everyone… excited?!”

Boom!

Everyone shouted in delight and excitement. The audience consisted of all kinds of people, with males, females, old, and young. However, all of them were fervent with excitement, their screams loud and hysterical.

“Tang Yuan, is this your new pet?” a young man asked Tang Yuan in the VIP stands. His face was filled with contempt and disdain.
