Chapter 447: The Key was Snatched

Translator: _Dark_Angel_ Editor: Kurisu

Key!

When they heard this word, both Ling Han and Yan Tian Zhao stopped fighting simultaneously. They subconsciously thought that this was referring to the secret key that could open up the Sagittarius Palace Hall.

Indeed, the Clan Head of the Jiang Clan immediately stood up wearing an expression of shock and rage as he shouted, “How could that be possible? The key has been hidden so well, so how could someone have found it?”

“In reply to Clan Head!” the man answered with fear and trepidation. “That man used some kind of unknown secret technique to take control of Fourth Elder and had him personally take out the key which he handed over to that man. Then the latter escaped in a coffin.”

Rong Huan Xuan!

Ling Han was immediately certain that it was him. Though there were possibly other disciples of the Thousand Corpse Sect in Extreme Yang City, the only man who would dare to so publicly appear as a disciple of the Thousand Corpse Sect could only be Rong Huan Xuan.

With the Three Lives Corpse Casket, he could be as willful as he liked.

Without a word, Ling Han and Yan Tian Zhao both simply turned and left. With a few leaps, they had reached the highest point in the Great Arena. Their eyes swept over the surrounding area, and soon saw where the commotion was. They then respectively used their motion techniques and moved to pursue.

Since the key has been snatched, what point was there to continue participating in any Marriage Tournament?

Xiu . Hu Niu, too, used her extreme speed and joined the pursuit. She shot a look at Yan Tian Zhao, opened her mouth slightly and bared her snow-white teeth, seeming to be filled with battle spirit.

A hint of dread actually appeared in Yan Tian Zhao’s eyes, and he could not help but maintain a certain distance from Hu Niu.

The Asura Demon Emperor could possess Rong Huan Xuan, and Yan Tian Zhao was also suspected to be taken over by a godlike being, so if Hu Niu, too, had a terrifying godly spirit in her, it didn’t seem strange anymore.

However, Ling Han was still extremely doubtful. Was there such a god that was violent yet whose favorite activity was to eat and also play cute?

The origin of the little girl’s oddity was in her Spirit Base, and seemed to be completely different from Rong Huan Xuan and Yan Tian Zhao.

What a headache; there were really too many monsters in this lifetime.

Ling Han ignored it for the moment. The most important thing now was to cut Rong Huan Xuan off and snatch back the key.

Thankfully, though the defenses of the Three Lives Corpse Casket were extremely impressive, it was not too overwhelmingly quick. At least, the gap between Ling Han and Yan Tian Zhao and the casket was slowly decreasing. There was no need to mention Hu Niu with her terrifying speed. However, she did not go all out, and instead chose to stay by Ling Han’s side.

There was no shortage of the Flower Blossom Tier elites in Extreme Yang City, and though Ling Han had not seen any before, he believed that there were also ultimate elite cultivators of the Spiritual Infant Tier as well. Rong Huan Xuan dared to so boldly snatch away the key; how could they so calmly allow him to escape?

But at least until this moment, no Flower Blossom Tier cultivator had made a move yet.

It was understandable. If they snatched back the key in Extreme Yang City, there was a high chance they could ultimately be pressured into returning the key to the Jiang Clan. However, once it had left the city, that would considered to be in the wilderness. And if one obtained something in the wilderness, that naturally belonged to him, and there was no such thing as a lost item.

This was a hidden rule.

Thus, everyone was waiting. They were all waiting for Rong Huan Xuan to leave the city, and at that time, it would definitely tempt a large number of elite cultivators into acting. Flower Blossom Tier, or even Spiritual Infant Tier cultivators making a move would not be strange.

The Three Lives Corpse Casket cleared the way, and no one could stop it in its path.

It just took about ten over minutes, and Rong Huan Xuan exited the city. Instantly, multiple figures appeared, no longer enduring silently.

“Be careful; this casket is a treasure of the Thousand Corpse Sect and possesses extraordinary power!” someone reminded. He was a Flower Blossom Tier cultivator that had once appeared in the Dark Devil Forest and personally witnessed how terrifying the Three Lives Corpse Casket could be.

A considerable number of people nodded, but even more looked disdainful. Even if it was a Level Ten Spirit Tool, how much power it could display would still depend on who the user was.

“Since you all are so cowardly, then I shall humbly receive this key!” One of them made a move and delivered a palm strike in the direction of the Three Lives Corpse Casket.

‘Idiot.’ A large number of people thought.

Pa!

A palm struck onto the Three Lives Corpse Casket, and instantly, multiple patterns lit up on the lid of the casket that transformed into a floating army of skulls and shot out in the form of a spear at the man.

The man was greatly shocked, and hurriedly spread out his martial intent to form a layer of defense over his entire body. However, the spear simply pierced directly through his defenses. Pu

, it pierced through his head, and blood dripped from the tip of the spear.

His luck was not as good as that Flower Blossom Tier cultivator from the Dark Devil Forest; he was killed with a direct pierce through the head.

Pa , the army of skulls disappeared automatically, and when the body of the Flower Blossom Tier cultivator lost its support, it instantly fell down from the skies and onto the ground, causing the layer of dirt on the ground to be disturbed.

“Hahahaha, you actually gifted me with the body of a Flower Blossom Tier cultivator as material for my Corpse Soldier, thanks!” Rong Huan Xuan’s voice was heard from within the casket. The lid of the casket opened, an arm stretched out and quickly dragged the body of the Flower Blossom Tier cultivator inside. Peng , the lid of the coffin quickly closed back up again.

When they saw this scene, everyone was struck speechless. This casket was defying logic, so what could they do now?

Looks like Flower Blossom Tier cultivators were of no use, so the only other option was to have Spiritual Infant Tier cultivators make a move.

A powerful cultivator whose whole body was enshrouded in a purple-colored divine light appeared. An impressive aura emanated from him, and even Spiritual Pedestal Tier cultivators were forced to their knees in front of him, without the slightest ability to resist.

An elite cultivator of the Spiritual Infant Tier!

However, Ling Han, Hu Niu and Yan Tian Zhao were no ordinary people, and were not the slightest bit afraid that they would be oppressed by this terrifying aura. Furthermore, Rong Huan Xuan, being protected by the Three Lives Corpse Casket, was also unafraid. Moreover, this kind of aura was not invincible. As long as one was a ruler that had managed to form seven flashes of Qi, he would be qualified to resist, and could decrease the effects this kind of aura had. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“It’s Violet Point Elder!”

When they saw this powerful cultivator appear, all those Flower Blossom Tier cultivators gasped in surprise. Though they were all aware that this would draw the attention of Spiritual Infant Tier cultivators, when such an ultimate elite cultivator appeared, it still caused much commotion.

Indeed, even Spiritual Infant Tier elite cultivators would be moved by the inheritance inside the Twelve Heaven Mystery Realms—though Violet Point Elder might not be qualified to enter into the Mystery Realm, he had a great many disciples and grand-disciples. There definitely had to be one or two talented ones among them, and as long as they obtained the inheritance, wouldn’t that be equivalent to the Violet Point Elder obtaining it as well?

The Violet Point Elder’s figure descended, and began to press a palm onto the Three Lives Corpse Casket.

“Hahaha, stupid old man, are you here to seek death as well?” Rong Huan Xuan laughed loudly, appearing very arrogant and conceited.

This caused everyone much displeasure. He was merely a minor character in the Spiritual Pedestal Tier, and just because he had a Level Ten Spirit Tool, he dared to undermine them. This was also because there was a shortage of ultimate elite cultivators in the north region. Otherwise, if he dared to try the same thing in the middle state, even with such a turtle shell-like defense, the only conclusion would be him being dragged out and killed.

The Violet Point Elder pressed a palm onto the casket, and instantly, the Three Lives Corpse Casket reacted. Another skull soldier appeared and slashed towards him.

Peng, peng, peng . The both of them instantly broke out into a fierce battle. The Violet Point Elder was not at a disadvantage, but also did not manage to destroy the skull soldier, and a stalemate instantly ensued. But the skull soldier was only an attack formed by the Three Lives Corpse Casket. Even if it was destroyed, the Three Lives Corpse Casket needed only to form a second one. Would the Violet Point Elder be able to withstand such a rate of depletion of energy?

“Violet Elder Old Man, I’ll give you a hand!” Another Spiritual Infant Tier cultivator appeared, and he simply slashed out directly with his sword at the casket. Hong , a slash of Sword Qi took the form of a divine sword that was as long as a thousand feet, which ruthlessly sliced forth.

Peng , the divine sword sliced down on the casket, and instantly invoked multiple ripples of light and shadow.

“Wu!” Rong Huan Xuan called out in pain. Though he was not directly attacked, the vibration from the impact of the strike still caused him much pain.
