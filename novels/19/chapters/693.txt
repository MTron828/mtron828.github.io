Chapter 694: Xu Xiu Ran Comes out to Travel the World

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Henyee

Power of the nation, a double-edged sword.

If you governed a country so that it was peaceful and prosperous, the power of the nation would be positive energy, allowing your strength to skyrocket. However, if you were a tyrant that incited seething dissent of the people, the power of the nation would be negative energy, not only unable to bring about supplemental effects, but also bringing about a decrease in strength instead.

So, the five great sects didn’t use the power of the nation despite knowing its benefits, because when refining the Realm Pill, people would obviously be in dissension and disunity, which would cause a terrifying end, directly affecting the quality of the Realm Pill.

“Tanned brother, now do you wish to give this emperor a hand?” Ma Duo Bao said, full of smiles and somewhat anticipating the answer.

Those who jumped out of the river of destiny were too rarely seen, and there was also two of them, just as if by some mysterious and inexorable arrangement.

Ling Han contemplated, and said, “I’m still going back to the Restore Heaven Academy to strive to get more people to separate from under the control of the five great sects, and when the time is ripe, I’ll bring them to the Purple Moon Empire.”

“Good!” Ma Duo Bao clapped and laughed loudly, appearing extremely happy. “Then this emperor will bestow you the title of the ninth king!”

“Don’t!” Ling Han waved his hand hurriedly. “I’ve no interest, and want to worship a fatty like you even less. It’s better to just be a wild crane with no abode, free and unrestrained.”

Lunar King giggled, looked at Ling Han, and said, “This King likes people like you!”

“I don’t allow you to like Niu’s Ling Han!” Hu Niu was tight, immediately hugging Ling Han and glaring at Lunar King.

“Everyone, for everyone’s future, please lend This Emperor a hand,” Ma Duo Bao said solemnly.

Feng Po Yun and Ling Han both nodded, while Yi Shuang Shuang yawned, appearing unenthused and uninterested.

“Your Majesty, with the five great sects’ accumulation over ten millennia, Shattering Void Tier elites would be in the hundreds. Are there any countermeasures?” Ling Han asked.

Ma Duo Bao appeared full of confidence, and said, “Among This Emperor’s eight kings, each can rival ten alone. This emperor has no worries in this aspect. If there are two things that need worrying about, one is when the divine realm will act, and the second is those people that cultivated the Underworld’s mystic art!”

“The Thousand Corpse Sect also can’t be underestimated,” Ling Han said.

“No matter, without over ten millennia of accumulation, the Thousand Corpse Sect can only be said to be ordinary.” Ma Duo Bao didn’t care at all. “Come, come, come, drink, drink!”

Everyone drank wine, and no longer spoke about splitting open the sky.

Ling Han asked Small Tower on the inside, “My natal horoscope had been changed, was that your tampering?”

“There was no need for me to tamper with it. You’re a fusion of two souls, so the natal horoscope would naturally change,” Small Tower said insipidly. “Moreover, this world’s rules aren’t complete, and to change natal horoscope is easy as turning a palm. No need to be surprised.”

Not being surprised would be strange!

“There are many secrets you haven’t told me, right?” Ling Han suddenly said.

Small Tower was silent momentarily, and said, “When you need to know, you’ll naturally be told.”

Damn, this Spirit Tool was hiding things as expected!

Ling Han had no other way. Although he was Black Tower’s master, he still had to receive the support of Small Tower, or else he could only watch helplessly. This Divine Tool evidently didn’t acknowledge him completely, and, strictly speaking, he was now only borrowing it.

“You’re a great tool bullying its master, how treacherous and insubordinate!”

“Hehe!” Small Tower gave him face and at least laughed, but no longer paid attention to him.

Ling Han and Ma Duo Bao talked for a long while. He told Ma Duo Bao about the things he’d found out from Zi Xue Xian, and Ma Duo Bao also wasn’t stingy in sharing some things crucial to splitting the skies and utilizing the power of the nation. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Afterwards, Lunar King also lead and army into battle, speeding up Purple Moon Empire’s expansion’s pace.

This empire had conferred eight powerful kings in the distant past, and four had already been found, while the other four were buried who knew where underground. Since too much time had passed, just like how Ling Han couldn’t find Boundless Mountain, Ma Duo Bao finding his eight kings also wasn’t an easy thing.

More importantly, it wasn’t just ten millennia since the eight kings were buried, and the lay of the land had changed. Even if the burial locations at the time were found, the people might not even be discovered; or, perhaps they were buried several hundred miles into the ground due to earthquakes.

Ling Han set out along with Lunar King, and when he arrived at Purple Moon Empire’s border, he then turned to travel towards the Restore Heaven Academy.

Yi Shuang Shuang and Feng Po Yun fought a battle while Ling Han took advantage of it to slip away; however, this female devil probably wouldn’t give up.

Purple Moon Empire’s three kings were invincible in their path, and already took down about one-tenth of middle state’s area. In terms of territory alone, the Purple Moon Empire was entirely deserving of the number one force.

But in the world of martial arts, strong or not was not based on territory, but rather the amount and quality of elites.

The five great sect’s resistance also grew stronger. Heavenly Astral King’s advancement’s pace was already greatly affected, and now a great deal of time and a big price needed to be paid to take down a city. Moreover, it was unstable conquest; when they left after conquest, maybe the next moment the top of the city would change to a different flag.

In such an atmosphere, Ling Han returned to the Restore Heaven Academy.

When everyone saw Ling Han, everyone pointed their fingers at him, the fierce man who slayed Small Saber King. However, many people’s gazes weren’t filled with reverence, but rather rejoicing at someone’s misfortune.

When Ling Han saw “Li Big Mouth”, he finally knew why.

Xu Xiu Ran came out to travel the world!

He still hadn’t arrived at the Restore Heaven Academy, and was toughening himself along the way, challenging various reputable figures, amongst which was no lack of Deity Transformation Tier elites, but all were cut down with a single saber strike of his without any exception.

And this person’s cultivation... was shockingly still at the Spiritual Infant Tier!

Another freak had appeared.

Comparatively, Small Saber King was indeed very far off from him.

Xu Xiu Ran already had spoken that the moment he arrived at Restore Heaven Academy, it would be the day that Ling Han was beheaded.

Now, the five great sect’s disciples were all longing for Xu Xiu Ran to arrive to slay Ling Han so as to reestablish the five great sect’s prestige.

Hearing this, Ling Han simply smiled faintly. He was now open-minded, and the things he thought of were no longer about striving to prevail over others, but rather about the entire world, so how could he care about a mere Xu Xiu Ran.

However, this didn’t mean that Ling Han would let down his guard. He was simply too confident in himself, and in a fight on the same tier, how could he lose to anyone?

At this moment, a surprising piece of news spread from the frontlines: the Purple Moon Empire and the five great sect’s fierce battle shattered a fragment of heaven and earth, revealing the entrance to a historic site.

Now, the two armies temporarily decided on an armistice, dispatching experts into the historic site to search for the treasures inside.

Being able to make two completely incompatible forces lay down their weapons and enter a historic site to find treasures, what amazing treasures could be hidden inside?

After the news spread, Restore Heaven Academy’s students set out one after another towards the historic site.

Things like opportunities were of unrelated to strength, but hinged on one’s personal fortune.

Ling Han obviously also departed. As his tier became higher and higher, his need for worldly treasures was also greater and greater. The improvement of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll and the Nine Dragons Tyrant Body Art needed vast amounts of worldly treasures to support.

True treasured pills had to be refined, and he also needed even higher-ranking ingredients, which was what was lacking in the Black Tower at the moment.
