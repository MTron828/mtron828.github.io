Chapter 626: Borrowing the Carriage

Translator: Reverie_ Editor: Kurisu

Ling Han didn’t mind making way, but this coachman not only shouted at him, but actually lashed at them with a whip, appearing extremely arrogant and overbearing.

And this was only a coachman.

If the coachman was so unbridled and domineering, then what kind of person was the master?

Ling Han frowned, and pointed out with the index finger of his right hand, showing no anger. The finger touched the whip lightly, but this spirit snake-like whip was immediately as if it’d been hit where it hurt, withering all of a sudden.

“Impudence!” The coachman, who had a chilling gaze, raised the whip, and was about to lash at them once again.

“Want to go a second time?” Ling Han reached out, and snatched the whip that hadn’t been retrieved in time, pulling forcefully. “Ah...” The coachman was instantly sent flying, and the terrifying Origin Power damaged the carriage considerably through the whip.

The carriage immediately stopped, and the coachman also fell into the thicket on the sides, letting out groans.

“Ma Tong, why did the carriage stop?” From inside the carriage, a youngster’s voice sounded, somewhat displeased. “Have we already arrived?”

“Young Master, we’re almost there. However, a few arrogant ones blocked the road, so I tried to chase them away and was injured by one of them who attacked.” The coachman, who stood up with some difficulty, made bogus accusations.

“Hmph!” The carriage opened, and a lanky man disembarked. He was quite young, looking only around 24-25, and had divine light wound around his entire body, appearing extremely formidable. He, who looked full of pride, swept a glance at Ling Han and the other two, and the proud look he wore became even more intense.

“A bunch of country bumpkins that don’t even have a carriage, could you guys also possibly want to attend Fairy Yi Yun’s Banquet?” he asked.

“So what if we are?” Ling Han said indifferently.

“Letting you country bumpkins attend the banquet is absolutely humiliating me!” that youngster said coldly. “On top of the fact you guys harmed my coachman, if I don’t act to teach you guys a lesson, then how could this acceptable?”

As expected, like master, like servant. If he weren’t used to acting unbridled and domineering, why would that coachman attack to injure others without saying a word?

Ling Han cracked a smile, and said to Zhu Xuan Er, “Encountering such an arrogant person, shouldn’t he need a beating?”

“He should!” Zhu Xuan Er nodded with a smile. She obviously believed in Ling Han’s strength, and to say the least, even if they encountered a Shattering Void Tier expert, didn’t they have the Black Tower? Moreover, Feng Po Yun was Ling Han’s sworn brother! If Ling Han never acted unbridled and domineering with a mighty Shattering Void Tier watching his back, how were other people qualified to?

“Haha, This Young Master is truly curious where you country bumpkins crawled out from, without a carriage to ride and looking extremely arrogant. It really upsets This Young Master terribly!” That young man leapt off the carriage. He had a majestic gait, with a shockingly imposing presence.

“Don’t say that This Young Master bullied you guys. This Young Master’s name is Zuo Qiu Le Cheng,” he said loftily.

Ling Han laughed, and said, “Should I cooperate with you and reveal an expression of awe and veneration?”

“What, you’ve actually never heard of This Young Master’s name?” Zuo Qiu Le Cheng was startled, and his gaze instantly turned baleful. “Unforgivable, you’ve actually never heard This Young Master’s name!”

Xiu, he dashed out and attacked Ling Han. As he reached out with his right hand, silver light bound it with closely interwoven vein-like patterns, making it look as if it’d turned into a metal arm that kept enlarging, emitting a terrifying presence.

In all honesty, this person’s strength was truly impressive, and could be called the finest amongst the Flower Blossom Tier.

Unfortunately, he encountered Ling Han as his opponent.

Ling Han casually reached out and grabbed Zuo Qiue Le Cheng by the chest, forcibly lifting him up. As Zuo Qiu Le Cheng still looked full of disbelief, Ling lashed out repeatedly. Pa, pa, pa, sounds of slaps on the face could be heard.

“Damn, see if this bastard can’t be convinced with a beating!” the ruffian rabbit shouted on the side while waving his small front claws, wishing to charge up and strike violently.

Ling Han turned his head, and said, “Rabbit, speak more civilizedly, don’t lead the kid astray!”

“Hit him, beat this bastard to death!” Hu Niu also hooted.

The rabbit shrugged its shoulders as if to show that Uncle Rabbit wasn’t even leading the little girl astray. She had originally already been insanely violent—the teeth marks all over Uncle Rabbit’s butt proved it!

Ling Han casually threw Zuo Qiu Le Cheng to the side, and said, “This guy’s right. If we don’t go to the banquet on a carriage, it’ll feel like our status is instantly lowered by a level. Come, come, come, everyone get on the carriage.”

“You...” Zuo Qie Le Cheng was furious beyond belief. These three people were actually going to seize his carriage? Of course their status was going to be raised. This carriage was his family’s antique, a treasure passed down since several thousand years. At the time, it was Zuo Le’s ancestors’ war chariot when they were on a world expedition!

He was also frightened and puzzled. Ling Han was clearly at the Flower Blossom Tier as he was, but why could he not even match one of Ling Han’s moves?

Could such a guy be the biggest genius, qualified for direct entry into the Restore Heaven Academy?

But why hadn’t he ever heard of him before!

Under the terror and rage, he even forgot what an inconceivable thing it was for a rabbit to talk.

Zhu Xuan Er and Hu Niu gladly sat on the carriage. The rabbit wanted to get on it as well, but Ling Han threw it in front of the carriage, and the Ground Burst Wolf instantly barked and snapped its teeth at the rabbit.

“You’re freaking uncle!” The rabbit hurriedly took to its heels.

The Ground Burst Wolf chased, and the carriage was instantly pulled along, traveling swift forwards. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ling Han couldn’t help but laugh loudly, but more so felt it strange.

The rabbit’s strength obviously far surpassed that of the Ground Burst Wolf, which had just entered into Flower Blossom Tier. Emitting a little bit of coercive pressure, it could frighten the wits out of this beast wolf; however, it chose to run to amuse Hu Niu.

Could the rabbit know Hu Niu’s origins?

Otherwise, why would this ruffian rabbit treat Hu Niu so nicely, not retaliating when hit or insulted, and simply screaming in pain when bitten? And now, it pretended to be in a tight corner to amuse Hu Niu.

The pitiful Zuo Qiu Le Cheng, who was tossed by Ling Han, not only dirty but also with torn clothes, had to take out and change into a new pair of clothes from a spatial ring, bawling as he changed.

The carriage traveled swiftly. It wasn’t too far from the private manor here, so they arrived in a short while. Ling Han tightened the reins forcefully, and that Ground Burst Wolf’s expression became twisted, its teeth bared as it forcibly halted its movement.

It was still not resigned, wanting to turn to tear with its teeth, but Hu Niu jumped out and her feet landed right on its head. It was originally in a foul mood, and now, being stepped on the head, it immediately wanted to bite this damned small human to death. However, before it opened its mouth, it felt an extremely terrifying presence, instantly making it prostrate on the ground in fright, wagging its tail ingratiatingly.

This wasn’t a wolf anymore. It was clearly a stupid dog.

“Young Master Zuo Qiu— huh!?” Four sturdy guards and an old butler were welcoming the guests, and seeing the carriage arrive, they also came over. However, when they saw Ling Han and the other two walking out the carriage, they couldn’t help but feel it strange.

Wasn’t this Zuo Qiu Family’s war chariot?
