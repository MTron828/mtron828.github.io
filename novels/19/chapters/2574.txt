Chapter 2575: Killing Niu Da

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Niu Da was stunned at first. He had not thought that Ling Han would actually have held something back in such disadvantageous conditions as he had previously been in, and had not used such a powerful weapon like the Regulations of Time.

However, with Niu Da’s overwhelming power, he was also just slightly affected. Could this have any influence on the greater picture?

‘Furthermore, you are delivering yourself to me; that really is seeking death!

‘Could it be that you don’t know that I am from the Herculean Iron Bull Race?’

This name very clearly signified that not only did he have shockingly great power, he also had an extremely tough physique.

He stretched out his arms to wrap around Ling Han, wanting to use his frightening physique and power to forcefully crush Ling Han into mush.

“Human, you are really stupid, to actually deliver yourself right into my hands!” He smirked coldly. Though Ling Han’s physique was also very strong, he was sure that with his crushing hold, Ling Han definitely would only have all his bones shattered.

With a?pu, the tip of a blade stabbed out of Niu Da’s back.

The expression on Niu Da’s face instantly froze, and blood was also gushing from his mouth.

He released his arms as he stumbled. Then, he looked dumbly at that sword that did not have even the slightest mark of blood which Ling Han was holding in his grip.

This was a Celestial Tool!

He immediately realized it, but when he lowered his head to look at his own chest, there was already a bloody hole there.

Letting a Celestial Tool land a direct hit on a vital point, even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King would be dying.

He looked disbelievingly at Ling Han. Under such harsh conditions previously, this human had still not drawn his Celestial Tool. Otherwise, no matter what, he could have fought him to a tie. How could the might of a Celestial Tool be underestimated? 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The other was too good at enduring. He clearly had grasp of the Regulations of Time, yet did not use it, and all that was so that he could land a fatal blow on him with the Divine Sword.

Indeed, at the beginning, Niu Da would definitely have been on guard, and would not have allowed Ling Han to easily approach him, but now that the battle had reached this point, he had been confident that he’d known all of Ling Han’s trump cards, and that was why he had carelessly fallen for this.

It was no fault of his that he had been careless, but rather it was Ling Han who was really too good at enduring. This was a battle in which he could have died at any time.

Niu Da had not died a worthless death, but he was still resentful.

Ling Han withdrew his sword, and stated calmly, “Don’t worry. I will definitely not let you go to waste. Steamed cow’s head, braised beef, wine-simmered oxtail, I already have everything planned out.”

Pu, Niu Da spat out another mouthful of blood. It was not enough that he was killed; he still had to become a cooking ingredient and be eaten by Ling Han?

But life was already completely leaving his body. No matter how resentful he felt, he could only lie down on the ground, with his eyes staring wide, yet there was no longer any sign of life from him.

Ling Han moved quickly, and immediately stowed Niu Da’s body into his Spatial Celestial Tool. This was the spoils of his battle.

This was a great turn of events that no one had expected. All the spectators had still been cheering Niu Da on, and anticipating that they would see how Niu Da crushed Ling Han into mush, but who could have expected that such a great turnaround would happen?

The cheers instantly stopped. While it could not be considered a dead silence, it was also completely quiet. Only the sound of heavy breathing could be heard here and there as they looked dumbly at Ling Han, who was bathed entirely in blood.

Inconceivable! This was really too inconceivable.

Lu Li had initially been all smiles, yet now this smile had abruptly frozen. He appeared very awkward. Meanwhile, Tang Yuan and the others sighed in relief before they burst into laughter.

Great, this was really too great. Previously, they had been beaten down on so much, yet now this development was equivalent to having slapped Lu Li right in the face, causing them to feel such pleasure that even all the pores of their bodies had opened up in satisfaction.

“Humph!” Lu Li truly could not hold himself back, and slapped a hand on the armrest.

“Lu Li, this is the consequence of being too arrogant. As a person, no matter what you are doing, you should never forget yourself in your arrogance.” Tang Yuan laughed loudly. When else should he counterattack if not now? “Just wait, in a few days, I will have Li Long challenge your Blood Martial King.”

Lu Li stood up, turned around, and left with a wave of his sleeve.

“Hey, don’t go. Are you such a sore loser?” Tang Yuan continued to mock him.

Shua, a sword light swept past, and Tang Yuan was silenced abruptly. That was because the tip of a blade was already leveled at his throat, and the hilt of the sword was held in A’Yuan’s hand.

This man was capable of wounding even Yang Xiaoling, who was a Fourth Heaven Celestial King, with a single strike, what more Tang Yuan, who was only in the Second Heaven.

Tang Yuan immediately felt his limbs become icy. He did not dare to move the slightest bit, because he had already seen A’Yuan move once before. This kind of person had completely no concept of fear. If he wanted to use his background to make the other wary of him, that would be truly delusional of him.

“Tang Yuan, I’ll return those words to you!” Lu Li retorted coldly. “Otherwise, you will only be asking for your own humiliation.”

A’Yuan withdrew his sword, and followed quietly behind Lu Li, keeping close.

Not until the two of them had disappeared from sight did Tang Yuan finally collapse and sit on the ground. He felt cold sweat covering his whole back. Though there was an ocean of cheers around him, he could not hear any bit of it. All that was in his mind was that scene from before.

He had been so close to the gates of the netherworld. Now that he thought back to it, it still caused his heart to throb wildly, as if his heart was about to jump out of his throat.

In the arena.

Ling Han looked coldly at all the spectators that had already risen to their feet. Everyone had already digested the fact that Niu Da had died by his hand, and were beginning to cheer for him.

Here, the one who died was worth nothing, while the strong could gain supreme glory.

Ling Han stuck out a thumb, raised skywards.

This action immediately excited the crowds even more. A new Blood Martial King was paying them respect, cheering with them as well.

However, Ling Han slowly turned his hand down, his thumb pointing at the ground, which turned into a mockery of everyone.

The cheers instantly stopped. Everyone was looking at Ling Han, their eyes filled with rage.

‘What do you mean by that?’

Ling Han continued to provoke them. He gestured a slicing motion at his throat.

Instantly, booing rose up all around.

“Damn pig, you should be disemboweled!”

“I want to eat your brains!”

“Can anyone go down there and kill him? He’s actually so arrogant!”

All the spectators were enraged. Though there were indeed some unconventional Blood Martial Kings, there was definitely no precedent like Ling Han, who was provoking the spectators like this.

On the spectators’ seats, Tang Yuan was also very displeased. A powerful Blood Martial King was not just the simple matter of pride—the salary paid was also considerable with every battle they took part in.

But what was this salary determined by?

Popularity.

Even if you were just a Blood Martial King with a single win, as long as the spectators loved you, you could still get an astronomical salary, and in Ling Han’s case, if he was despised by the spectators, his salary would also be astonishingly low.

One of the things Tang Yuan hated the most, which could even be ranked in the top three, was losing money.

Humph, he would definitely teach Ling Han a lesson.

In the arena, Ling Han swept a glance around him, and said, “If anyone wants to die, just come on down. Foreign Races are even more welcome, as long as they are not the likes of rats or worms. I will definitely ensure you can be made full use of.”

When the spectators heard this, they were even more furious.

‘Are you treating us as cooking ingredients here?’

However, while sounds of displeasure rose up all around, no one came down to the arena. That was because one would have to be a Blood Martial King himself to challenge a Blood Martial King. They did not have the Yin River Celestial King backing them up, which would allow them to ignore the rules.

Ling Han did not do any other provoking actions. It was already enough.

He strode forwards, and entered into the passage of life. Then, he left the tournament ground, and returned to Tang Yuan’s courtyard.

He needed to digest this battle with Niu Da. It would definitely give him boundless appreciation.

A few days later, he came out of seclusion, and felt that his cultivation level had indeed increased greatly. The doors to the Fourth Heaven were already close at hand.

As expected, the fastest path to increasing his cultivation level was battle.

Tang Yuan held another celebratory banquet in Ling Han’s honor, but when the banquet had proceeded halfway, a person suddenly came over, and said that Yang Xiaoling was summoning Ling Han for an audience.
