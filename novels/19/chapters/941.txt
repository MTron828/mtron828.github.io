Chapter 942: A Gift from the Ninth King

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The Ninth King actually gave a gift to a man in public!

This practically caused the eyeballs of all the people from the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire to pop out of their sockets in shock. They only knew how inconceivable and unacceptable this scene was.

Aside from the Ninth King, who had appeared not many years ago, the other Eight Kings had all respectively joined the Imperial Court and been bestowed the title of king in the last million years. In truth, they had not made any bit of contribution to the empire, and it was all the decision of the empress who bestowed the title upon them.

Yet facts had proven that the empress truly had a keen eye.

After a long time, the Eight Kings had all advanced into the Heavenly Body Tier, though none knew exactly what level they had reached. Hence, when the Ninth King appeared, the citizens all naturally thought that it would not take too many centuries before this important person would also become a great elite of the Heavenly Body Tier.

However, the other Eight Kings and the empress all shared a common point, and that was being aloof to men and maintaining a distance from them.

So, in everyone’s head, the Ninth King should be no different.

Thus, when they saw the Ninth King personally come over to deliver a gift of an alchemical pill, it was naturally so astonishing that they were gaping with shock; no matter how much they puzzled over it, they could not believe it was possible.

Ling Han accepted the pill bottle, smiled, and said, “Thank you, Ninth King.”

He, on the other hand, was clear that the Ninth King was innocent and naive, simple to the extreme and without any schemes in her head at all. She did not have any romantic thoughts, either, and it was completely because he had helped the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire get the first place, which allowed the Ninth King to be praised by the empress. Now that she was happy, she wanted to express her gratitude.

It was that simple.

“All right, you’d better not die inside. We’ll see each other later.” The Ninth King waved, and, holding up her skirts, raced off again.

Lin You’s mouth was open wide enough for a fist to fit inside. After a long time, he finally punched Ling Han’s chest playfully, and teased, “Awesome guy, never thought that you managed to conquer the Ninth King, let alone without any previous sigs at all. Hiss, this time, probably no one would dare to make a move against you now.”

The Ninth King represented the will of the empress, so if she favored Ling Han, who would dare make a move against him?

Ling Han merely smiled, though he was shaking his head internally. How could things be as simple as that? Who would be able to find out who the culprit was after someone was killed in a Mystery Realm? How could the Ninth King possibly kill them all?

... If something happened to the Ninth King, perhaps the empress of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire would really massacre all those who entered to calm her rage, but she would definitely not go so far for him!

To speak more crudely, who did he think he was?

Ling Han put away the pill bottle. The Jade Sun Pill could save cultivators a year’s time of cultivation. It was negligible for any Immortal who had a very long lifespan, but for him, it was extremely useful.

Perhaps he would be able to reach the maximum limit of strength of 20 Stars after he had refined this alchemical pill.

He had nothing to do anyways, so he simply chose to consume the pill directly, and refine it here and now.

Who would dare make a move against him now?

In front of the eyes of so many, Ling Han was the safest. Anyone that dared to make a move now would be publicly declaring themselves an enemy of the Ninth King, and he believed that even the Left and Right Ministers and the Seven Great Generals would never dare to do such a thing.

Shui Yanyu could only watch with a muscle twitching in her cheek, stunned by how outrageously bold this man could be.

Ling Han consumed the alchemical pill, and immediately circulated the Six Techniques Return to One to absorb the medicinal effects inside the pill.

Spiritual Qi from the heavens and earth abruptly surged over in waves, almost becoming solid, and wrapped around Ling Han.

A Spirit Base that had six alignments absorbed Spiritual Qi that had six alignments, and became six pillars of Qi, their various colors vibrant and bright.

When they saw these pillars of Qi, quite a number of people was moved.

“What is there to be so amazed about? Isn’t it just stimulating Spiritual Qi?” someone said in a disdainful tone.

“There is nothing amazing about being able to stimulate Spiritual Qi that has six different alignments at the same time; even for someone that does not possess a natural Spirit Base, they could forge one out afterwards to create a perfect Spirit Base that has perfectly balanced six different alignments. But, the problem here is how could these pillars of Spiritual Qi be so wide!?”

“This is extremely astonishing. When I was in the Shattering Void Tier, the pillars of Spiritual Qi that I stimulated were only a hundredth of the width of his at most.”

Being thus reminded, whether it was those in the Shattering Void Tier or those in the Mountain River Tier, they all looked stunned. No wonder this person was absolutely invincible in the Shattering Void Tier. He had indeed cultivated Shattering Void Tier to a practically perfect level.

“Tsk, he is just invincible in the Shattering Void Tier. Once he enters into the Mountain River Tier, he’ll be trash.”

“That’s right. He has only just climbed up to the eighth floor, and is just a four-star genius. Even a two-star genius, once he has reached the peak of low extreme of the Mountain River Tier, would be able to dominate him easily.”

Some spoke in envious tones, but once they had said such words, even they themselves could not help but be dumbfounded.

Just barely entered into the low extreme of Mountain River Tier, and he would have battle prowess to match someone in the early stage of medium extreme of Mountain River Tier? How astonishing was that? “Just a four-star genius”? Did you know how many four-star geniuses there were in total in the whole Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire? And you dared to use the word ‘just’!

“Hehe, he only has the potential to become a four-star genius, it’s not set in stone!” In the end, those people justified their words.

Ling Han would naturally not take this idle gossip to heart. Under the effects of the alchemical pill, the Spiritual Qi formed pillars and surged madly into his body, endlessly transforming into his Origin Power.

His strength was rapidly improving, charging towards the maximum limit of 20 Stars. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Because he had been cultivating the Nine Dragons Tyrant Body Art all this while, added with the wealth of resources in the Immortal Realm, he, a mere Shattering Void Tier cultivator, naturally reached the peak of his Body Arts very soon, and the only thing he lacked was the level of Origin Power.

In truth, with how rich the resources were in the Immortal Realm, they could easily send a cultivator up to the level of 20 Stars of Shattering Void Tier of strength, but the problem was whether you personally would be able to bear this kind of strength.

If your Dantian was not big enough, and your Spiritual Sea not wide enough, how could you be able to accommodate so much Origin Power?

You would only be stuffed to the point of exploding.

This was like a man who was obviously filthy rich, yet he was ill, so he could not eat scrumptious delicacies, and could not touch his beautiful wife—what meaning was there in having this kind of wealth?

Ling Han cultivated the Six Techniques Return to One to open the final door and become capable of accommodating the maximum of 20 Stars of strength. When he came to this understanding, the only thing he lacked was time to “fill him up”.

Now that the Ninth King had gifted him a “Jade Sun Pill”, it just happened to fill in for this shortcoming of his.

Only after a day did Ling Han stop, his eyes snapping open as a smile pulled up the corners of his lips.

“Yi!” Shui Yanyu was astonished. “When you looked at me, I actually felt as if I was afraid to look you in the eye.”

Ling Han gave a laugh, and teased, “That’d be natural. Don’t you know that the husband’s duty is to guide the wife, so it is natural that you would fear me?”

Shui Yanyu mercilessly rolled her eyes at him, but was still extremely surprised. One had to know that she was in the Mountain River Tier, yet she was actually scared by the gaze of a minor cultivator in the Shattering Void Tier. What kind of logic was that?

Her heart tensed up suddenly, and she felt breathless. She asked, “You, could it be that you have pushed your strength up to 20 Stars?”

“Clever, as expected of my wife!” Ling Han praised.

Strength of 20 Stars!

Shui Yanyu’s whole head was filled with these words. She was so stunned that she forgot to criticize the way Ling Han was taking liberties with her.

She knew that Ling Han would definitely be able to reach strength of 20 Stars of Shattering Void Tier one day, but she had never imagined that it would’ve happened so quickly. She stared at Ling Han with eyes filled with astonishment; this man... would perhaps one day become a miracle that all others could only look up to and admire!
