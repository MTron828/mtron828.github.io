Chapter 900: Fine, As Long As You Pay

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

On his first day of entering the Scarlet Heaven Academy, a fat white cat came and put on airs to establish its authority.

Ling Han gave a sigh. ‘This isn’t a good start!’

After a good night’s rest, he went to attend class the next day. On this day, a teacher would come to explain to them some secrets regarding the cultivation of the Shattering Void Tier. On one hand, he had some interest in the subject, and on the other, he wanted to meet with Li Weiwei in order to discuss with her about doing business. Naturally, he wouldn’t be cutting classes.

He arrived neither too early nor too late. By the time that he had arrived, he saw that about one-third of the seats in the classroom had already been occupied.

The classroom was large enough to accommodate about 500 people. This batch of newly recruited students was less than 500, so the place was sufficient to accommodate all the new students.

“Senior Brother Ling!”

“Brother Ling!”

“Ling Han!”

Upon seeing Ling Han, quite a lot of people came up to greet him and appeared to be exceptionally warm. Only a minority of talented individuals showed indifferent expressions, apparently not willing to fawn over Ling Han.

This was something quite normal for everyone. A Four-star genius... how many were there in the entire Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire?

More importantly, the assessment of the White Star Tower included up to Five-star genius, which meant that Ling Han was qualified to climb to the highest level of martial arts.

Perhaps, he would be an elite of the Heavenly Body Tier a million years later.

Of course, given that a period of a million years was really long, innumerable changes could happen in between—perhaps Ling Han would have already died by then?

This was also the reason why some people held themselves to be above politics and worldly considerations. After all, at present, only Ling Han’s talent had been exhibited. There was no knowing how strong he would be in actual combat. If they had known that Ling Han had been equally matched against Xu Ran’s spirit, then a lot of people would likely change their minds immediately.

Ling Han just smiled and nodded his head in greeting towards everyone.

He had always been a person who would return the kindness of others tenfold, but if the other person were to walk all over or provoke him, he would absolutely show no mercy.

“Humph! Shameless!” The Luo Brothers came as well. Naturally, they wouldn’t be bothered to suck up to Ling Han; both brothers bore fiery gazes.

Who would have thought that an insignificant ant of a small world would actually seize first place in the assessment this time?

“Hahaha!” Luo Ba suddenly faced upwards and let out a few howls. Whom this was directed at was obvious.

“Senior Brother Luo, what do you mean by this?” someone asked.

Although Luo Ba was very strong, the strength of the Luo Clan wasn’t considered top-tier within the Imperial Capital, so someone was naturally bold enough to argue with him.

“I guess all of you still have no idea—this Ling Han, Senior Brother Ling, hehe, it was only but a few days ago that he flew up here from a small world!” Luo Ba unveiled a “big secret.”

“What!?” everyone cried out in surprise. He was an insignificant ant from a small world?

Suddenly, many people revealed expressions of disgust; how could they humble themselves to make the acquaintance of such a lowlife? Yet, there were also some people who expressed even more admiration—a person from a small world could actually be so amazing; it really wasn’t easy.

The attitudes of the students had undergone extreme polarization. This was a deeply rooted notion. Some people were of the view that a small world was too primitive and too backward, and showed extreme disdain.

“Ling Han!” Luo Ba couldn’t help but smile. He reached out, and said, “Did you forget what I said yesterday? Do you dare to spar with me?”

“Spar? What right do you have to spar with me? Are you even qualified to spar with me?” Although Ling Han wasn’t a vain person, he absolutely didn’t have a good impression of Luo Ba, and so wouldn’t give any face to the other party.

Luo Ba was so angry that he stomped his foot. He was one of the three great elites of the younger generation in the Imperial Capital. It couldn’t be that he wasn’t even qualified to spar with Ling Han, right? He forced down his boiling anger, and said, “I want to duel with you!”

“Fine, pay me an appearance fee. Otherwise, there’s nothing to discuss!” Ling Han said. “It’s not much, just give 10 True Origin Stones, but if I win, then you would have to compensate me another 100.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Pfft! Many people laughed out loud.

This Senior Brother Ling was a really shrewd person, even trying to make money out of a duel.

Luo Ba had wanted to agree at once, but quickly restrained himself. Although he was the leader of the younger generation of Luo Clan, it was slightly difficult for him to take out 10 True Origin Stones in one go.

The crucial point was, he might be able to take out 10 True Origin Stones, but what if he lost? 100 True Origin Stones was a very huge amount indeed—at least it was beyond his control.

Ling Han’s performance was quite amazing, so he had to consider the possibility of losing.

At first, it wasn’t a big deal. His ranking was below that of Ling Han, so no one would laugh at him even if he lost. But if he won, then he would be able to trample all over the glory surrounding Ling Han for getting first place. Yet now, with such a high stake, he dared not agree so easily.

Unless he could be certain of defeating Ling Han.

“Coward, do you intend to use this method to avoid a duel?” Luo Ba certainly wouldn’t lose on on his stand.

Ling Han waved his hand dismissively, saying, “Stop talking about such trivial matters. If you want to fight, I can accept your challenge, but there’s nothing to discuss if you don’t have True Origin Stones. Do you think that my time isn’t valuable like yours? Poor people without True Origin Stones should refrain from whining.”

Luo Ba was seething with so much anger that he almost agreed, but he still managed to forcibly restrain himself.

He had to be one hundred percent sure of gaining victory!

“Hahahaha!” Amidst the jingle-like laughter, two beautiful women were seen coming in from the door; one clothed in green robes, tender and charming, while the other appeared elegant like a fairy in flowing white robes.

Both women had their respective strengths. While their temperaments were completely different, both were charming all the same, causing others to be intoxicated with their beauty.

They were Li Weiwei and Ji Yun’er, two of the three great beauties of the Imperial Capital.

“Well said, Ling Han!” Li Weiwei came over and showed her support for Ling Han. “He is my man— ah!” She immediately realized her own mistake, and quickly corrected herself, adding, “No, no, no, he is a man of the Left Minister’s Residence, and my follower. If any of you dare to bully him, then you will stand as my enemy. You had better consider the consequences!”

Although there was no shortage of descendants of influential officials in the Scarlet Heaven Academy, was there anyone whose status was higher than that of the daughter of the Left Minister, at least in this batch?

Those who had felt disdain for Ling Han earlier humphed. Although they didn’t dare to confront Li Weiwei, they also certainly wouldn’t take to heart Li Weiwei’s words. After all, Ling Han only flew up here from a small world about ten days ago. He would be categorized as one with neither foundation nor backing—so what if they were to trample on him?

Ling Han looked at Li Weiwei and smiled. “How come you are suddenly so nice to me? I’m somewhat not used to it.”

“Tsk! Of course, I still detest you very much, blockhead. But you are my follower, and only I can bully you. If other people can also do that, then wouldn’t they be on the same level as me? Of course, that cannot be allowed!” Li Weiwei raised her chin proudly, revealing her porcelain neck, beautifully white and tender as a swan’s; its beauty was beyond one’s imagination.

Ling Han burst out laughing, not taking her words to heart, and said, “Drop by my place later, I have something to discuss with you.”

“Damn blockhead, don’t tell me that you have designs on me?” Li Weiwei suddenly looked alarmed. “Don’t think that you can make me sleep with you! In your dreams!”

Ling Han was dumbstruck. ‘This little girl is too open-minded. Also, what could she be thinking about all day?’
