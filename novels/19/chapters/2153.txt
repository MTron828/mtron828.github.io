Chapter 2154: Breaking through to Dividing Nine Souls

Lin Xuan roared, and forcibly chased away the fear in his heart.

Because he was now even greedier, and wanted to obtain everything that Ling Han had, and take it for himself, which would help him soar.

As he saw it, the reason why An Ran was stronger than him was merely because she had a master who was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. If he, too, could possess a secret treasure that was on the level of Ninth Heaven, he would definitely not be weaker than An Ran.

“Die!” he roared, and charged over.

Ling Han did not dodge or evade, and merely smiled at him, showing a mouthful of snow-white teeth.

‘F*ck!’

Lin Xuan was angered, and his spear struck quickly. The green dragon howled, exploding with endless might.

Kill, kill, kill, kill!

He wielded the spear in a piercing strike, and wanted to kill Ling Han with it.

Pu!

The piercing strike landed, yet Lin Xuan showed an expression of incomparable shock.

This piercing strike was actually blocked by that layer of light outside of Ling Han’s body, and caused his hands to go numb, and his entire body to shudder, as if every bit of muscle was about to fall off his body.

Ling Han moved, and delivered a slap right at his face.

Lin Xuan knew that Ling Han had a deadly strike like the Great Clash of Source Powers, so how could he possibly be unprepared? Immediately, he rapidly retreated with a bounce of his feet.

He had successfully evaded this strike, but his expression was very ugly.

If Ling Han had used the Great Clash of Source Powers, he naturally would not have taken it to heart, but the former had simply wanted to slap him. Just what kind of profound contempt was that?

But what was going on with this light? It was like the Heavenly Dao itself was showering sympathy and protection, causing him to shudder. He felt as if becoming enemies with Ling Han was opposing the heaven and earth.

Cultivating in this heaven and earth, how could he possibly defy the heavens?

This had to be a treasure that Ling Han had obtained inside the blood mist! It had to be!

His jealousy became even more pronounced. This should have been his, all of it was his.

“You’re quite fast at dodging,” Ling Han said with a laugh. Taking advantage of this time when the Heavenly Venerable Tier light had not disappeared, and his defenses were invincible, he rushed towards Lin Xuan. He did not have the intention to injure him, but just repeatedly delivered slaps at the latter’s face.

Lin Xuan exploded in fury. As the saying went, even in a battle, don’t aim for the face, but Ling Han was purposely targeting his face. Just what kind of humiliation was this? Most importantly, Ling Han was just a mere Dividing Soul Tier, and he actually dared to slap the face of a First Secret monarch tier like himself. If he did not kill Ling Han, how would he be able to face others in the future?

“What are you being so arrogant for? You just managed to luckily obtain a treasure,” Lin Xuan retorted in defiance.

“Thus, you can only envy from the sidelines,” Ling Han stated calmly. “Scrambling so closely behind me, aren’t you just jealous and coveting the treasure I possess? Too bad for you, it’s not yours!”

“I won’t believe that you can continuously channel this kind of treasure!” Lin Xuan declared fiercely. Though he could not do anything to Ling Han, neither could Ling Han do anything to him. After all, the gap in their cultivation levels was clear to see, and the battle could not be won just because Ling Han had invincible defenses.

The two men battled intensely.

In truth, this was just a farce. Ling Han wanted to slap Lin Xuan’s face, while Lin Xuan was just dodging here and there, not allowing himself to be slapped.

If this spread out, it would be practically comical. A Dividing Soul Tier was facing up to an Immortal Palace Tier, but it was actually the Immortal Palace Tier elite that was scrambling away from his blows!

One day, two days, three days… When half of the fourth day was up, the Heavenly Venerable Tier light on Ling Han suddenly and rapidly trembled, and then disappeared.

Time was up.

Both Ling Han and Lin Xuan faltered, and then Lin Xuan laughed loudly. “As expected, you are no longer able to activate that treasure! Ling Han, surrender your life!” He wielded his spear in a counterattack. This anger that he had suppressed for more than three days could finally be unleashed.

“Idiot,” Ling Han said casually, and then he already vanished inside the Black Tower with a flash.

This was not because he was avoiding the battle, but simply because he wanted to play around with Lin Xuan. When he next came out, he would become serious, and would kill the latter.

Lin Xuan’s piercing strike passed, yet completely missed his target.

‘Where is he?’

The man was shocked. Had his opponent used some kind of secret technique, and directly fled? That was not right. Lin Xuan had clearly not sensed any ripples in the Regulations of Space, so how could Ling Han have possibly fled? Or was it rather some kind of smokescreen?

But if it was just a smokescreen, how could Lin Xuan have only pierced empty space with his strike?

If it was only a smokescreen, it could only deceive the eyes and divine sense, but could not evade attack.

A Spatial God Tool? Impossible!

A Spatial God Tool was inferior to the strength of even One-Star Pseudo-Celestial Tool. With his strike, the resultant shock wave only had to scrape it a bit, and that Spatial God Tool would definitely have exploded. There would have been nowhere for Ling Han left to hide.

But when all other impossibilities had been excluded, the only remaining possibility was actually zero, and he was stumped at this.

‘He must have used some kind of Celestial King Tier method.’ Lin Xuan deduced. ‘If he had been able to escape, then he would not have needed to walk out of the blood mist previously, but would just simply have left directly.

‘Hence, he must have hidden in some corner in the vicinity.

‘If I thought that he had left, I would fall for his deception.

‘Hence, I will first pretend to leave, and then monitor from a distance. HIs cultivation level is beneath mine, so there is absolutely no way that he could discover that I am nearby.

‘Additionally, he chose to flee instead of standing against me, which means that this Celestial King Tier method can only be used to save his own life. Otherwise, why would he have needed to flee?’

Lin Xuan calmed his emotions, and formed connections for all that had happened until now, obtaining a deduction that he thought matched the truth the most.

With a tap of his feet, he went into the distance. He appeared to have given up and left, but in reality, he was waiting on the sidelines.

***

Within the Black Tower, Ling Han paid no regard to what Lin Xuan was thinking. He presently was going to cultivate Dividing Nine Souls, and solidify the foundations for the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

“Let me tell you a piece of good news.” Small Tower appeared, its body swaying slightly. “With the introduction of the Source Power of Time, the time acceleration effects of the Black Tower can be increased 100 times.”

“In other words, one day is equivalent to 100,000 days?” Ling Han was extremely pleasantly surprised.

“That’s right. Furthermore, that is still because the Source Power of Time is injured. When it has fully recovered, these acceleration effects could be further increased.” Small Tower gave Ling Han a greater hope.

Ling Han naturally was overjoyed. What he lacked the most was time. With enough time, he could catch up to those prodigies that had been established long ago, and could even ascend Dao and become a Celestial King a few epochs earlier than expected.

And now, when one year passed in the outside world, Ling Han could cultivate inside the Black Tower for 100,000 years. This was too useful.

He immediately sat down in a cross-legged position, and began cultivating.

Shang Zhiwei treated him like a son or nephew, and gave him copious amounts of cultivation resources. And she was also a mighty figure that had the right to know of the level of Heavenly Venerable Tier, so she naturally had an incredibly high opinion of Ling Han, and did not think that Heaven Soul would be the final point for Ling Han on this major tier.

Thus, the cultivation resources she gave Ling Han had far surpassed the norms, with her clearly wanting to help him to reach the level of Dividing Nine Souls.

Ling Han sighed softly. The more he gained from Shang Zhiwei, the more difficult his position would be in future.

But at this moment in time, he really could not refuse.

Forget about it, he should just cultivate first.

He cultivated inside the Black Tower, and this was different from being underneath the Reincarnation Tree, where the time acceleration effects could only take effect on the spiritual level. Instead, it was effective on his whole person.

One year, 10 years, 100 years, and Ling Han’s cultivation level began spiking madly. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

WIth the support of a great amount of resources, Ling Han’s accumulation of Origin Power exploded like a volcanic eruption, and there were nine Source Powers of heaven and earth within his body, leading to him experiencing absolutely no problems with the comprehension of Regulations.

This was a precious treasure that even a Celestial King would covet and could benefit from. Even if it was an idiot, his cultivation level would soar after obtaining this, what more when it was Ling Han.

9,000 years later, Ling Han cultivated to the peak stage of Heaven Soul, and began breaking through to the Dividing Five Souls level that a limited few had broken through to in history.

“Ji Wuming struck himself in the Severing Mundane Tier, and achieved the cultivation level of Ninth Heaven Celestial King. He is determined to break through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier, and is definitely capable of forming nine divided souls. I definitely cannot fall back behind him.”
