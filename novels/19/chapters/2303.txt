Chapter 2304 Vitality Index, Evolution Index

Translator: Henyee TranslationsEditor: Henyee Translations

“Be more specific. None of us can understand,” Ling Han said.

Wally’s patience was definitely an astonishing thing. He explained, “The Vitality Index is a comprehensive index that describes a living being’s power. It takes into account their life force, battle prowess, and so on.

Every 1000 points is a new level.”

He paused for a moment before continuing, “A Vitality Index of 2,584 is equivalent to a battle prowess at the Fifth Leaf of the Seventh Lotus.”

After hearing this explanation, everyone started to understand the concept. This was how the Dark Inverse Realm categorized battle prowess.

“Then what about the Evolution Index?”

“The Evolution Index represents a living being’s potential to evolve their level of being. The higher the index, the more likely one can reach a higher level of being.”

“Then is an index of eight high or low?” Bewitching Maiden Rou asked. After all, the previous index had been over 2000, yet this index had suddenly fallen to eight now. This made her extremely worried.

“The minimum possible Evolution Index is zero,” Wally explained. “This represents an impossibility to evolve any further. Meanwhile, the highest possible Evolution Index is 12. This represents the potential to reach the

highest level of being.”

In other words, even though an index of eight wasn’t high, it wasn’t low, either.

“Then what about Niu?” Hu Niu asked as she jumped forward. She was also extremely curious.

Green light beamed from Wally’s eyes again, scanning up and down Hu Niu’s body. After a while, he said, “Your Vitality Index is 2652, and your Evolution Index is 9. However, this number is variable, and it can possibly

reach 10.”

Ling Han was slightly surprised. Hu Niu’s potential was definitely greater than Bewitching Maiden Rou’s. This was without a doubt. Moreover, the variable quality that Wally mentioned was most likely due to the

imprint of the Celestial King that existed inside her body. This could help her soar to a higher level.

This person was truly impressive. Just by using his eyes to scan a person up and down, he could see all of their secrets.

Wally turned his gaze to the Empress. Green light beamed out once again.

“Her Vitality Index is 2650, and her Evolution Index is 9,” he said.

The Empress’ and Hu Niu’s battle prowess was almost identical, and their potential was also near-identical. It was only because Hu Niu possessed an extra imprint of a Celestial King that she had the potential to soar to

a greater height.

“What about me?”

“What about me?”

Many more people rushed over. They were all extremely curious about their indexes.

“You have a Vitality Index of 1682 and an Evolution Index of 8.

“You have a Vitality Index of 1357 and an Evolution Index of 7.

“You have a Vitality Index of…”

Those at the Severing Mundane Tier—or the Sixth Lotus, in other words—mostly had a Vitality Index of over 1000. Even Celestial Maiden Yunhe, a Fifth Severance monarch tier, only had an index of slightly over 2000.

Those at the Fourth Severance could only reach a maximum index of 1600.

In terms of the Evolution Index, emperor tiers would often receive an index of seven, while monarch tiers would receive an index of eight. Because it was impossible to become a monarch star at the Severing Mundane

Tier, one naturally couldn’t obtain an Evolution Index of nine or above.

“Don’t worry, the Evolution Index is only a reference,” Wally said. “It isn’t absolute. Moreover, one’s Vitality Index can also change, and this will in turn affect the Evolution Index.

“Just like her and her. In reality, their Evolution Indexes are already infinitesimally close to 10. It’s only a small bit off. Thus, it’s not impossible for their Evolution Indexes to eventually become 10,” Wally continued as he

pointed at Hu Niu and the Empress.

Ling Han nodded in understanding. Their battle prowess was already identical compared to monarch stars at the same cultivation level—if monarch stars could exist at this level. However, as long as they didn’t

cultivate a ninth divided soul, they would always be that little bit off.

“Then what about Ba?” everyone asked in curiosity. This person was far too powerful, so what kind of height would his Vitality Index and Evolution Index reach?

Wally scanned Ling Han up and down. After a while, he said, “Your Vitality Index is 3396, and your Evolution Index is 10.”

Gasp!

Everyone sucked in a sharp breath. He was only at the Seventh Lotus, yet he already possessed a Vitality Index of over 3000? Extrapolating from the numbers before, a Vitality Index of over 3000 would most likely

equate to being an Eighth Lotus cultivator. Moreover, every 100 points would correspond to one leaf of battle prowess. In other words, Ling Han’s true battle prowess was at the Third Leaf of the Eighth Lotus.

Also, an Evolution Index of 10!

This was far too astonishing. This signified that Ling Han was indeed as talented as a monarch star.

However, Ling Han frowned, and said, “You said that the maximum Evolution Index was 122”

Wally nodded, and replied, “The strongest living being that I’ve come across had an Evolution Index of 12. However, I can’t say for certain that no one can exceed this number.”

He was just as rigorous as always.

Everyone was rendered speechless. Ling Han was already so freakish, yet his Evolution Index still wasn’t the highest?

In that case, that person was definitely a prodigy from the Dark Inverse Realm. In fact, they might have even come from a more powerful dimension.

The level of one’s potential would definitely be affected by the overall environment of heaven and earth.

“Your specific Evolution Index should be 10.9. However, even if it’s only 0.1 off the next level, it can only be regarded as 10,” Wally said.

Everyone breathed a sigh of relief. If someone as freakish as Ling Han only had an Evolution Index of 10, then just how freakish would one need to be to have an Evolution Index of 12? This was simply unfathomable!

Ling Han was slightly disappointed by this result. He was already so powerful, yet his Evolution Index still hadn’t reached 11? However, after further thought, he had only comprehended the Regulations of two realms,

yet his battle prowess had already risen by so much. Then what would happen after he comprehended the Regulations of three realms, 10 realms, or even 100 realms? Just how powerful would he become?

The freaks who had obtained Evolution Indexes of 11 or even 12 were most likely people who had achieved just that.

With this in mind, Ling Han immediately felt much more at ease. He was now filled with motivation.

“Come with me,” Wally said as he continued to walk forward. The emotions of others wouldn’t affect him a single bit.

Everyone followed Wally, and with his glow to illuminate the path, their speed naturally increased by a considerable amount. After only four hours, the roof of the cavern started to become higher and higher. It was

seemingly boundless.

“The path to leave is just ahead of us,” Wally said as he pointed ahead. There was a soaring column of light there, and one could see the complex symbols that pulsated inside it.

Ling Han suddenly lashed out.

Pa, pa, pa!

Celestial Maiden Yunhe and the others were all knocked unconscious. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Wally turned to Ling Han, and asked, “Why?”

However, his voice was calm, and it was as if he wouldn’t pursue this topic even if Ling Han didn’t answer him.

“Your identity can’t be revealed to anyone,” Ling Han replied. “As such, their memories need to be erased.”

Wally didn’t say anything. However, his eyes continued to shoot beams of light, one bright and one dim. These beams of light interchanged, and after a while, he said, “According to my calculations, the people from this

realm detest me with a passion. If my identity is revealed, there’s a 99.99996 percent chance that I’ll be killed.”

Ling Han didn’t understand how Wally had arrived at this number. However, it was good that he understood the danger. After all, Ling Han was slightly troubled at this moment. How should he subtly erase Celestial

Maiden Yunhe and the others’ memories of Wally? For the moment, he didn’t want to kill these people yet.

“Is that why you four have disguised like this?” Wally asked. He glanced at Ling Han and the three women.

Ling Han was curious, and he asked, “How did you discover our true identity?”

One had to realize that they had practiced the Heaven Deceiving Technique. With this technique, even Ancestral Kings wouldn’t be able to see through their disguise if they didn’t look closely.

Wally’s voice was calm as he replied, “I reached this conclusion after performing many detailed calculations. The reliability of my conclusion is 93.58 percent.”

As he said this, his body surprisingly started to transform. Horns grew from his head, and a pair of bat wings protruded from his back. A tail also appeared on his lower back. His skin stopped glowing, and it instead took

ona red color. He looked just like a demon.

Ling Han shook his head, saying, “This kind of disguise isn’t very useful.”

When judging one’s identity, their external appearance was only secondary. The primary source of identification was their aura.

Wally cocked his head, saying, “I can perfectly imitate any living being. However, doing so will consume my Void Particle Energy. Unless it’s necessary, I can’t waste this energy.”

‘So be it,’ Ling Han said in his mind.

He then asked, “Is there an Ancestral King corpse here?”.
