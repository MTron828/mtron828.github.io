3234 Ling Han Has a Spirit Tool Too

Lian Xuerong wanted to meet the attack head-on, but Ling Han was one step ahead of her. He blocked her with his hand, and said, “Banner Lord, there’s no need for you to deal with this kind of trash. I’ll deal with him.”

“What high-sounding sentiments!” Hu Can snorted coldly and rushed over. “Both of you, come at me together. It’ll save me some energy.”

Lian Xuerong thought about it and took a few steps back.

Since Ling Han was so confident, let’s take a look at his strength first.

In any case, she had already sent someone to inform the City Lord Manor as soon as she received the news. She believed that in another half an hour or so, the City Lord would personally send Butler Mu over.

With an Extreme Bone Tier elite holding down the fort, the Hu Clan naturally wouldn’t dare to act recklessly.

“Little brat!” Hu Can sneered and pressed down with his palm.

Ling Han had no intention of fighting head-on. This was a super elite whose blood and Qi was boiling, and facing him head-on would definitely lead to death. He turned his body to the side, and then threw a punch.

Peng, power surged out, surpassing the speed of sound, turning into a huge fist.

“Petty tricks!” Hu Can sneered. He completely ignored Ling Han’s attack and directly charged over.

Bam! The force of the punch landed on his body, causing Hu Can’s body to tremble slightly before coming to a halt.

This time, Hu Can’s expression was a little awkward.

He had just said that it was a small trick and put on a disdainful expression, but in the blink of an eye, he had been stopped by this small trick. Wasn’t this a slap in the face?

However, Hu Can was more surprised. A Meridian Opening Tier cultivator could actually stop him. How was this possible?

The other party’s attack just now was at least 500,000 kilograms of strength.

Hu Can felt a little spooked. If he hadn’t been boiling with blood and Qi, his power would probably only be slightly stronger than Ling Han’s.

How could a mere Meridian Opening Tier cultivator possess such terrifying power?

If things were already like this now, what would happen in the future?

At first, he didn’t know what was going on. However, how could the Hu Clan be trampled on? Thus, he immediately flew into a rage. Earlier, when his third brother gave him the Spirit Tool, the former had also briefly explained what had happened.

He cursed Hu Qiu in his heart. Why did he have to provoke such a guy with limitless potential? If he let Ling Han leave today, then the Hu Clan would definitely be wiped out by Ling Han in the future.

Since what was done was done, he could only get rid of this brat and prevent future troubles.

“Die!” Hu Can activated his ultimate move. His left hand turned into the shape of a claw, and he continuously clawed at Ling Han. Xiu, xiu, xiu, the force continuously transformed, and one could only see huge claws pressing towards Ling Han, practically covering the sky and earth.

Ling Han was unable to fight it head-on, and could only dodge. Fortunately, the limit of his power release was also as far as 30 feet. While dodging, he could also counterattack, so he was not completely passive.

Lian Xuerong was shocked. Regardless of whether it was speed or power, Ling Han was completely not inferior to her. The only difference was that Ling Han was unable to boil his blood and Qi, which would allow his power to erupt by two to three times.

Hiss, Meridian Opening Tier could actually be so strong?

She couldn’t help but think of that white-robed, omnipotent genius in the Imperial Capital. He was also a freakish cultivator who could match a Blood Transformation cultivator while he himself was a Meridian Opening Tier, but could he reach the heights of a Third Change or Fifth Change cultivator?

Could it be that there was someone who could surpass that freakish person?

While she pondered, Ling Han and Hu Can had already exchanged many moves. He was naturally completely on the defensive, constantly dodging, and would only occasionally counterattack with one or two punches.

But even so, everyone was still shocked.

That was a Fifth Change elite making a move, and his blood and Qi was boiling as well. He was currently in his most powerful state of battle prowess.

Even this couldn’t kill Ling Han in a few moves?

Heavens, what kind of monster was this!

Ling Han was incomparably calm. He was not as relaxed as others thought he was. Facing a Fifth Change elite whose blood and Qi was boiling, he only needed to make the slightest mistake, and the result would be eternal damnation.

Hu Can’s strength was stronger than his, and his speed was faster than his. The only reason he was able to dodge his attacks time and time again was because Ling Han predicted the course of his attacks accurately. Otherwise, when Hu Can attacked, it would definitely be too late for him to dodge.

Ling Han was relying on his experience, but the other party’s speed was too fast. Ling Han had to capture the details of Hu Can’s every move, so the pressure was naturally incomparably great. In just two minutes, he had already overused his eyes. His eyes felt extremely sore, and his eyes were bloodshot.

However, he only needed to hold on for a few more minutes before Hu Can’s outburst period ended.

If it was a Fifth Change… it was not much stronger than him. He could completely deal with it.

Hu Can’s expression became uglier and uglier. Previously, he had fought a great battle with Lian Xuerong, and his blood and Qi had boiled. Then, he had waited for Hu Chaosheng to retrieve the Spirit Tool, and had wasted some more time. Thus, when he really fought with Ling Han, he actually only had about five minutes left for his power burst.

Now, he had used another two minutes, but it seemed like Ling Han could still hold on for a few more minutes.

He was unable to accept such an outcome. A Fifth Change elite’s blood and Qi boiled, yet he was still unable to take down a mere Meridian Opening Tier elite? Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

If word got out, he would become a joke. A huge joke.

Since that was the case, hmph!

Hu Can revealed a cold smile. Weng, the sword in his hand immediately lit up.

To be precise, the four symbols on the sword emitted a white light, making it look like a blade made of light. It would definitely be useful as a torch in the dark.

Shua, Hu Can slashed out with his sword, and a brilliant Sword Qi immediately slashed towards Ling Han. It was a full three meters long, and its speed was ridiculously fast. Even if Ling Han could predict the sweep of this sword, it was impossible for him to dodge it.

‘Go die!’

Hu Can sneered and heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. This young man was too terrifying. He definitely could not be allowed to mature any further.

“Ling Han!” Lian Xuerong cried out in alarm, and hurriedly brandished the whip in her hand. However, she was too far away, and the whip simply couldn’t reach him.

However, a smile appeared on Ling Han’s face. How could it be that when he clearly knew that the other party had a Spirit Tool in his hand, and would not be on guard?

He had already taken out the broken sword. He also raised his sword. Shua, the symbol shone slightly. Then, he shot out a Sword Qii that was only a foot long, greeting the wide and long flash of Sword Qi.

“Eh, a Spirit Tool?”

When everyone saw this, they said in their hearts.

Unexpectedly, this kid could actually obtain an incomparably precious Spirit Tool!

It had to be known that all the Spirit Tools came from the ancient sites of the previous civilization. Currently, no one could make Spirit Tools. Thus, Spirit Tools were extremely precious things. Even the Hu Clan only had one.

A Meridian Opening Tier brat actually had one too!

However, such a Spirit Tool?

Everyone shook their heads in their hearts. The sword was already broken. How much power could it still leave?

It was clear just by looking at the length of this Sword Qi. It was only a foot long. It was simply too weak.

Shua, the two flashes of Sword Qi collided. Silently, the three-metre-long flash of Sword Qi broke. Then, it began to spread and collapse from where it had been broken before completely disappearing.

On the other hand, the foot-long flash of Sword Qi continued to sweep forward.
