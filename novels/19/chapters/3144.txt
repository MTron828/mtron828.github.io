3145 Strong support

In this remote and desolate place, a Ten Meridians elite that looked to be in his twenties could actually appear?

“Young man, you’re really blowing your own trumpet.” Wang Feng laughed loudly. Naturally, he didn’t believe him at all.

Ling Han smiled faintly, “Then ask around, who was the one who had killed this python?”

Wang Feng faltered for a moment. This brat was so calm and composed. Could it be that he was really the one who had killed it?

“Bullsh!t!” Sima Rong hurriedly jumped out, “It was clearly me that had exhausted this Demonic Snake, and that was why you had the advantage!”

He knew what mission Lian Xuerong had, so he definitely couldn’t let her know about Ling Han’s freakish natural talent in cultivation. Otherwise, this brat would easily surpass him. This was something he definitely didn’t want to see.

“Such a vile character?” Lian Xuerong spoke up, the gaze she directed at Ling Han was filled with disdain.

“Milady, this is the truth!” Sun Jianfang said. It was clear that there were dangerous arrows aimed at him, but he was still willing to support Ling Han.

Ling Han looked at the old geezer, and couldn’t help but feel a sense of gratitude.

It was easy to add icing on the cake, but it was difficult to send coal in the snow[1]. Only at this moment would one be able to see who was the person who truly treated him well.

Lian Xuerong scoffed, and said, “Little Qi, step out.”

“Yes, Banner Lord!” A young man somersaulted, and leaped down from the battle ship. Peng, this battle ship was over thirty meters tall, and the force of his descent was still a little shocking, shaking the ground slightly.

This could only be considered a youth. He looked to be sixteen or seventeen years old, at most, and looked a little quirky in personality.

“You are Ten Meridians. Go and fight him,” Lian Xuerong said.

“Yes.” This young man bowed slightly towards Lian Xuerong, then walked towards Ling Han.

What, this young man was actually Ten Meridians?

Everyone was dumbfounded. If that was really the case, then this Dark North Nation was too terrifying, wasn’t it?

Originally, Gu Tang, Nie Huayun, and the others were still conflicted and unwilling to live under someone else’s power, but if they could open the door to the Twelve Meridians… they would all be tempted.

“My name is Zhao Qi.” The young man smiled at Ling Han, “You have to be careful. I will go all out. If you are boasting, you would only be killed by me.”

As expected, his cultivation level was Ten Meridians. Before his palm reached him, an invisible force had already reached him.

“Yi?” “En?” “Ya?”

Lian Xuerong, Wang Feng, and the others all exclaimed in shock. With such a clash, they naturally could see very clearly that Ling Han’s power had indeed reached Ten Meridians.

“Tsk, he’s clearly only a Nine Meridians elite, still unable to release his full power. However, his power has already reached the peak stage of Ten Meridians. This is impressive enough!”

“If he was in our city, he would probably be able to enter into the top ten, right?”

“Such a prodigy can actually appear in such a remote place, how rare!”

Wang Feng and the others whispered among themselves. In front of Lian Xuerong, they didn’t dare to be impudent at all. It was as if this wasn’t a seductive beauty with bone-deep beauty, but rather a powerful beast of the primitive age.

Lian Xuerong also nodded slightly. This kind of young man was truly outstanding, and could be called a prodigy.

Peng, peng, peng! Zhao Qi didn’t receive any new commands from Lian Xuerong, so he naturally wouldn’t step back. He dashed forward like a panther, launching fierce attacks at Ling Han. His attacks were erratic and unpredictable, and he could attack from all kinds of tricky angles. It was almost impossible to defend against.

Ling Han mainly focused on defense. A Nine Meridians was really at too much of a disadvantage against a Ten Meridians. Thankfully, a Ten Meridians could only release their power for around three feet or so. In other words, Zhao Qi had to be very close to him to be able to launch a threatening attack.

In this way, it also gave Ling Han the space to counterattack. It was only three feet. His legs exploded with full power, and he could rapidly approach, which similarly posed a great threat to Zhao Qi.

A Nine Meridians were truly battling against a Ten Meridians.

It wasn’t long before the two of them had already exchanged several dozen blows.

Lian Xuerong withdrew her gaze and looked at Sun Jianfang and the others. “Ten minutes is up. What’s your choice?”

“We are willing to surrender!” Gu Tang, He Guan, and the other elders immediately bowed. It was not just these few elders from the Ancient Dao Sect. The Divine Wind Sect, Blue Feather City, Netherworld Faction, and so on had all chosen to surrender, all those that were not Twelve Meridians.

If they followed this Dark North Nation, it seemed like their future would be bright. A Ten Meridians in his teens, a Twelve Meridians in his thirties… this was practically a myth.

Moreover, they were too strong. For example, Cao Cong and Meng Ruining were both Twelve Meridians, but in a one-on-one situation, they were completely no match!

Thus, it was better to be a smart person and go with the flow.

“What decision have you all made?” Lian Xuerong looked towards Sun Jianfang, Ji Yuanlong and the few others.

Sun Jianfang sighed internally. He had operated the Ancient Dao Sect for close to a hundred years, yet he was actually no match for one word from Lian Xuerong. This made him feel slightly disheartened.

His lifespan was nearing its end, so there was actually nothing he couldn’t let go of. However, the Ancient Dao Sect was connected to his blood and sweat, and he hoped that it could become even better in the future. That was why he held onto power and refused to let go. It was only when Ling Han appeared that he finally found someone he thought could help him shoulder his burden. He planned to step down after Ling Han advanced into Ten Meridians.

Unexpectedly, the change came so quickly.

“If I don’t surrender?” Sun Jianfang asked.

“All lands under the heavens belong to the Emperor,” Lian Xuerong said calmly.

Otherwise, you can leave. If you are not a citizen of the Dark North Nation, then you naturally do not have to abide by the laws of the Dark North Nation.

“Hehe, I would like to spar a few moves with Banner Lord Lian!” Sun Jianfang looked towards Lian Xuerong, fighting spirit blazing in his eyes.

“Wang Feng.” Lian Xuerong answered calmly.

“Yes, Banner Lord.” Wang Feng immediately stepped out. “If you want to fight with my Banner Lord, you have to get through me first!”

Old Venom, Meng Ruining, and the other Twelve Meridians elites all looked at Sun Jianfang. They naturally didn’t want to surrender the force that they had operated for so many years, but in front of absolute strength, what could they do?

Sun Jianfang smiled faintly. “You’re no match for me.”

“Haha, shameless boasting!” Wang Feng shouted loudly, and charged towards Sun Jianfang. His strength had reached 50,000kg, and he burst out with his full strength. As he rushed over, it was as if he was a herd of wild bulls running madly.

Sun Jianfang stood with his hands clasped behind his back. When Wang Feng was about 15 meters away from him, he waved his hand.

“Go!” Wang Feng also roared loudly. As he shot out a punch, the five overlapping layers of power were superimposed. Visibly, even the air itself was rippling, as if it was wrinkling.

He pushed this powerful force onwards.

Twelve Meridians could release their power to about six meters, so the present distance was still a little short of that.

Boom, Sun Jianfang shot out a palm strike, and Wang Feng was sent flying.
