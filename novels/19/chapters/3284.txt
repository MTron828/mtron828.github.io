Chapter 3285 - 3285: Improving the Oj Return Pill

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Niu Huaqing imparted all the formations knowledge he knew to Ling Han, and Ling Han also absorbed it completely. His ability to digest knowledge was astonishingly strong.

This made Niu Huaqing very happy. As a Master, he liked disciples like this the most.

However, he only imparted experience and understanding, and did not teach Ling Han the specifics of formations. As long as he grasped the basic knowledge thoroughly, setting up any formations would be a piece of cake.

Niu Huaqing only planned to teach Ling Han a set of formations, which would be used to defeat the General Vajra.

However, this set of formations had yet to be fully formed. Niu Huaqing had obtained inspiration from a broken ancient formation and modified it, calling it the 33 Layered Vajra Formation.

This was actually a pressure formation. It could suppress people up to 33 times, and one fold of pressure was equivalent to the full-strength attack of an Inscription Tier elite. With 33 layers overlapping, it was indeed terrifying.

“Back then, that Iron Lump could withstand the bombardment of ten times the level of Inscription Tier. After so many years, I’m afraid his resistance has improved. Therefore, I’ve also prepared thirty-three bombardments for him. It can definitely crush his tortoise shell and make him beg for mercy,” Niu Huaqing said confidently.

Ling Han had learned this formation, but he was temporarily unable to set it up.

Firstly, there were no suitable materials to create the formation foundations. Secondly, his Spiritual power had not reached the point where he could draw extremely effective formation patterns. Thirdly, even if he had the finished product, the strength of his Spiritual power was not enough to activate it.

Moreover, Niu Huaqing hadn’t fully researched this formation yet. Why did he pass it on to Ling Han so early? Actually, he wanted to discuss it with Ling Han. Niu Huaqing was quite confident in Ling Han’s comprehension ability.

However, Ling Han did not spend much effort on this. His current focus was to increase his cultivation level. To fight the General Vajra, that would have to wait until he advanced into the Extreme Bone Tier, right?

Therefore, there was no hurry.

Niu Huaqing also knew this, so he didn’t rush him, and only told Ling Han to practice diligently, and not to forget to participate in the competition of the Formation Association after the new year.

“Old geezer, that is a grand occasion in the world of formations. How can an outsider like me participate?” Ling Han ridiculed.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Of course. You can participate once you certify yourself as an Elementary Level Formation Master, right?” Niu Huaqing immediately retorted.

Uh, Ling Han sighed. He actually didn’t really want to go, because with the invisible halo of hatred on his head, he reckoned that going to the Formations Association would definitely cause trouble again.

It was annoying to keep doing this.

Niu Huaqing didn’t give Ling Han too much pressure. He quickly left the academy. Ling Han wondered if he was going to seek out his old lover to reminisce about the past.

Ling Han once again placed his focus on alchemy. This was currently his most profitable avenue, and whether it was cultivating mystical power, Body Arts, or formations, they all required a large amount of money as support.

He mainly concocted Blood Replenishing Pills and Qi Return Pills. These were the alchemical pills that Blood Transformation Tier cultivators used the most. In addition, he also concocted some Hundred Neutralization Pills and Berserk Pills. The Hundred Neutralization Pill could detoxify poisons, and the Berserk Pill could allow a second eruption.

He was very interested in the Berserk Pill. If he could neutralize the side effects of the medicinal power, a Blood Transformation Tier would erupt for more than 20 minutes.

The problem of the consumption of mystical power was also very easy to solve.

The solution was Qi Return Pills, and there were no side effects. It was just

that the amount of mystical power that was replenished with each pill was a little too little, especially for someone like Ling Han, whose mystical power was incomparably pure.

He had to improve the pill recipe. The recovery effect was too lousy.

Ling Han immediately immersed himself in it. Previously, he had been unable to do so because consuming the Qi Return Pill in the Meridian Opening Tier had no effect. This was completely different.

He savored it carefully and searched for a large number of medicinal ingredients, trying to find substitutes to increase the effect of the alchemical pills.

Three days later, he had a direction and began to experiment.

The medicinal ingredients were very expensive. Fortunately, he had some savings to begin with. In addition, Hu Yang had lost five million to him, so he did not have to worry about money for the time being.

On the other side, Huan Xue had also reached the peak of the Twelve Meridians.

Ling Han gave her a month’s time to sense a Hidden Meridian. If she could succeed, then she would continue to break through to reach twenty meridians. If she couldn’t, then there was no need to waste time. She would directly break through to the Blood Transformation Tier.

Another four days passed. After experiencing many failures, Ling Han finally succeeded in improving the Qi Return Pill, and its effects increased more than tenfold!

“Now, I basically don’t have to worry about running out of power.” Ling Han stored the alchemical pill into the Essence Nurturing Gourd. For the time being, he had no intention of selling the improved version of the Qi Return Pill. He had to satisfy his own needs first.

He still wanted to improve the Berserk Pill, but before he could start, he was visited by an esteemed guest.

Xuanyuan Dingguo.

This was General Xuanyuan’s 17th son. He was only 25 years old this year, and was already standing at the peak stage of the Blood Transformation Tier. He could advance into the Extreme Bone Tier at any time.

Why didn’t he break through?

He was still waiting for the son of the seventh son of the Xuanyuan Clan to enter the academy and take over his position to continue leading the Xuanyuan Gang.

Ling Han was very surprised. This General Xuanyuan was really good at having children. He should be more than a hundred years old now, which meant that Xuanyuan Dingguo had been born when he was at least in his eighties.

Thinking about it, it made sense. Due to the environment of heaven and earth, General Xuanyuan’s cultivation couldn’t advance even an inch now. What could he “do” when he was extremely bored?

Thus, even if Xuanyuan Dingguo suddenly had a younger brother at this time,

Ling Han wouldn’t find it strange. After all, an Inscription Tier should have around 200 years of lifespan, and General Xuanyuan was currently in his

prime.

.

“Brother Xuanyuan!” Ling Han cupped his hands in salute.

This time, Xuanyuan Dingguo came alone. He looked around the room, and couldn’t help but be surprised. He asked, “Ling Han, were you refining pills just now?”

“That’s right.” Ling Han nodded.

“You know how to refine pills?” Xuanyuan Dingguo asked in shock.

You’re already a f*cking martial arts prodigy, and you’re reputed to be the second Hong Tianbu. But now, you can even refine pills. How are others supposed to live?

However, it seemed that Hong Tianbu also had a side job. It was said that he also had shocking natural talent in formations.

Was this what a freakish genius was like?

Ling Han thought for a moment, and pretended to enter the bedroom. In reality, he took out a Qi Return Pill from the Essence Nurturing Gourd, then handed it over to Xuanyuan Dingguo, and said, “This is the Qi Return Pill I refined.’

Xuanyuan Dingguo didn’t pay much attention to it at first. After all, he had seen Qi Return Pills before. However, he soon revealed a surprised expression and said, “Huh, this Qi Return Pill seems a bit different.” It was different from what he had seen and consumed.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “You can try eating it.”

Xuanyuan Dingguo hesitated for a moment before popping the pill into his mouth.

He wasn’t afraid that Ling Han would harm him. If he did, this guy was really courting death.

In an instant, a look of pleasant surprise appeared on his face, and he asked, “Ling Han, how did the effects of this Qi Return Pill reach ten times greater?”

He looked at Ling Han as if he was looking at a monster..
