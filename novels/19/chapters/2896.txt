2897 Fighting Xin Qihu again

Ling Han no longer held back. He channeled the combination seals, and his power surged once again, reaching a level at which he could completely suppress his opponent. That black-robed Fifth Tier was unable to withstand it at all, and was violently blasted apart with just over a dozen punches.

Large amounts of life essence gushed into Ling Han’s body, causing him to shake his head. How could there be someone so stupid? Why did he have to come alone to court death?

Thinking about it again, this was normal. Who wouldn’t want to monopolize the treasures? However, who would have thought that Ling Han’s strength would be so great?

It was conceivable that there would be no shortage of such people. In the future, there would be an endless stream of them coming to court death.

Sure enough, just over 10 days later, Ling Han was targeted by another Fifth Tier. He didn’t say anything, and directly moved to suppress Ling Han; he was extremely domineering.

The Fifth Tier could indeed be so unreasonable, but unfortunately, his opponent was Ling Han.

Naturally, there was no need to mention what would happen to him. His only fate was death.

In a battle at the same cultivation level, the prerequisite for escaping was that one had to act quickly and not be entangled by the other party. Otherwise, one would only be blasted to pieces with a single strike.

Time continued to pass, and more and more Fourth Tiers and Fifth Tiers died in Ling Han’s hands. Naturally, people realized that something was wrong.

Although Ling Han was a little annoyed, the life essence of a Fifth Tier elite at this stage was too beneficial for him. After several thousand years, his cultivation had actually advanced to the middle stage of the Third Tier.

This was extremely astonishing progress. If he could continue like this, then Ling Han would only need around 10,000 years to reach the peak stage of the Third Tier and break through to the Fourth Tier. Not even Lin Youlian and Xin Qihu of the past could compare to him.

However, how could there be so many good things in the world? 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Moreover, there were only around 1,000 Fifth Tier Heavenly Venerates in total. Was he really going to kill all of them so that he could increase his cultivation level?

The following Fifth Tiers that made a move on Ling Han afterwards were not so stupid. All of them came in groups. Their numbers would range from as few as three or four to as many as six or seven of them, which caused Ling Han to have no choice but to feel wary, and he did not dare battle them to the death. He adopted the strategy of roaming around and fighting, and mining raw stones as he ran.

After more than 100,000 years, this dimension was almost empty as well. Ling Han decided to head towards the sixth dimension. Although the further down he went, the more difficult it would be, his limit was the Fifth Tier, so he should be able to go down two or three more dimensions.

The trio set off into the depths of the ground layer.

The environment here was even worse, and even Third Tiers would find it hard to endure. Fortunately, the Empress and Hu Niu both had Fourth-Tier battle prowess, and they could still enter the Celestial Guest Residence in the worst case. With the power of the Heavenly Venerate Tool and Ling Han’s protection, it should not be a problem for them to withstand Fifth-Tier attacks.

More than 10 years later, they finally arrived at the sixth dimension.

At this point, Ling Han was no longer thinking about why the dimensions here could be layered on top of each other, perhaps overlapping and overlapping endlessly.

What kind of power had created this?

It was impossible for him to figure it out. ‘Forget it, let’s go find the vein of ore.’

Undoubtedly, this dimension was even smaller, and it was severely damaged. In many places, one could directly see the Void. Terrifying energy storms rushed out, and they could easily strike Second Tiers to death. One had to be in the Third Tier to match them.

This was also why only Third Tier elites were qualified for inter-dimensional travel.

However, Third Tier was only the minimum requirement for inter-dimensional travel. Some energy storms were formed by a mixture of the six fundamental particles, which was equivalent to the blow from a Pseudo-Seventh Tier. That was truly terrifying. It should be that even Zhou Heng, Chu Hao, and the other Sixth Tiers would not dare to face this head-on.

What was even more dangerous was that the ground here was too fragile. No one knew which piece of land would suddenly shatter and spew out a terrifying energy storm that would strangle people to death.

Ling Han and the others were cautious. So what if Ling Han had Fifth-Tier battle prowess? They did not dare to be careless here.

This dimension seemed to have been destroyed, and the degree of destruction was astonishing. It was estimated to be only 1% of the size it used to be. However, dimensions were dimensions, after all. Even a low-level dimension like the Celestial Realm was incomparably huge, and there were still plenty of places to explore.

Needless to say, the environment here was extremely dangerous, but the output was also astonishing. Ling Han had already obtained three yellow Great Herb, and had even found two fifth-grade seals. Their value was extremely astonishing.

One day, Ling Han suddenly felt a strong throbbing in his heart. He abruptly raised his head to look at the sky, only to see a figure streak across the sky and stand above his head.

“I’ve finally found you!” this person said calmly, exuding a domineering aura.

Xin Qihu.

This pesky guy.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “I was just about to challenge you to a battle. You came just in time.”

“Hahaha, do you think you’re qualified to be presumptuous in front of me just because you’ve advanced to the Third Tier?” Xin Qihu shook his head. “You’re not worthy. You’re far from it.”

“When did you become the king of chatter? Come, make your move!” Ling Han’s fighting spirit was high. His first battle with Xin Qihu had ended with him fleeing in defeat, which made him very displeased.

“Humph, you still haven’t gotten rid of your bad mouth!” Xin Qihu delivered a palm strike. He clearly hadn’t used any secret techniques or Heavenly Venerable Seals, but this palm strike was still so overbearing and peerless that even Fifth Tier elites would shiver in fear.

This was… battle prowess at the peak stage of the Fifth Tier!

Now that Ling Han had a direct understanding, he immediately determined Xin Qihu’s strength.

He was unafraid. He activated a Heavenly Venerable Seal, raising his battle prowess to the peak stage of the Fifth Tier, and then threw a punch.

Peng!

The giant palm collided with the fist, forming a mushroom-shaped ball of energy that spread in all directions.

Fortunately, the Empress and Hu Niu were currently in the Celestial Guest Residence, so they didn’t have to worry about being affected by this power. Otherwise, they would still frown at this even with their cultivation levels.

“Heh, after advancing into the Third Tier, your strength has greatly improved!” Xin Qihu sneered. Xiu, his figure descended, and his palms struck out like battle axes, every blow ruthless, forcing Ling Han to have no choice but to use his full strength in order to match him.

As expected of the greatest prodigy of all eternity, how powerful.

Ling Han had killed even several Fifth Tiers, yet Xin Qihu was suppressing Ling Han as a Fourth Tier, and had not even used any Heavenly Venerable Seals. This battle prowess was truly formidable.

Ling Han did not feel that anything was wrong with this. If Xin Qihu did not have such strength, how could he possibly expect to become a Seventh Tier elite?

With his cultivation level of Third Tier, Ling Han could barely match this strongest prodigy who was in the Fourth Tier. If word got out, his reputation would definitely soar, and he would directly crush the three greatest prodigies of all eternity, enjoying the honor of being number one alone.

“Looks like I have to get a bit serious!” Xin Qihu finally channeled a Heavenly Venerable Seal, but it was only a ninth-grade seal. It clearly only increased his strength by five times, but it immediately gave him the upper hand.

Both of them were supreme prodigies, and their natural talent and techniques in battle were impeccable. In a situation where their power was equal, it was absolutely difficult for them to determine who was stronger. Thus, once Xin Qihu gained the upper hand in terms of power, he naturally suppressed Ling Han.

Ling Han parried a few moves, but was hit by a few consecutive palm strikes, causing all the bones in his body to feel like they were about to fall apart. He could only increase the stakes, channeling a sixth-grade seal to balance the power difference again.

With this, the two of them were evenly matched.
