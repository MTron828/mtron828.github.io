Chapter 2357: Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity’s Dao Translations

“Understood.” Ling Han nodded respectfully as well. He only wanted to feel the aura of a Heavenly Venerate, and was not concerned about whether he could be the 38th disciple or what his rank was among the other disciples.

“This is the knowledge that has come from my recent studies; I bestow it on you all.” The Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity flicked his fingers, and?xiu, xiu, xiu,?five streaks of light darted from his hands, sinking respectively into the foreheads of Ling Han and the others.

The five of them hurriedly bowed in gratitude once more, but the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity only waved a hand, and this sliver of divine sense instantly disappeared.

Ling Han checked himself, and discovered a sphere of light had appeared in his mind. With a light touch, millions of Regulations instantly flowed out, as if the heaven and earth itself had manifested and taken form.

If he used this to cultivate, it would mean half the work with twice the results.

Unfortunately, this was not effective for Ling Han.

Because he had the Origin Magic Cube, which was even more helpful for his cultivation.

However, this was still a treasure.

Why?

Because this contained the power of heaven and earth that the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity had cultivated!

The reason why a Heavenly Venerable Tier was so strong was because he had leaped out of the range of Regulations, and touched the essence of heaven and earth, becoming capable of directly using the power of heaven and earth.

And just now, when the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity bestowed it on the five of them, it was inevitable that he would also be gifting a bit of his own power to them. Though it was pitifully little, in essence, there was no difference.

The others would be completely unable to detect this kind of power. Even an Eighteenth Lotus Ancestral King could only detect it with great difficulty. Only a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate who had touched the power of heaven and earth before, and was close to comprehending the essence of the heaven and earth was capable of understanding it.

Coincidentally, Ling Han was one such existence. He had once been a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate, and even if his present strength and cultivation level had fallen from that level, his sensitivity for the power of heaven and earth was still there. Otherwise, he could not possibly have been able to extract Void Particle Energy.

‘This is the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity’s Dao!’ Ling Han thought. Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will never be defeated. Now that he had understood the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity’s Dao in advance, should the two of them clash in the future, he would be able to grab the key moment first—on the precondition that he himself had become a Heavenly Venerate as well.

“Huh?!”

Ling Han showed a hint of surprise, and was even stunned to the extreme.

In the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity’s power, he discovered several slivers of aura that belonged to the Celestial Realm.

‘How is this possible?!’

The Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity was an elite of the Foreign Realm, so how could he possibly extract the essence power of the Celestial Realm?

If it was said that the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity was actually an elite that originated from the Celestial Realm, there was clearly the aura of the heaven and earth of the Foreign Realm within his power, and was clearly dominant in his power at that.

Hiss, the old geezer was presently studying how to remove the restrictions of the heaven and earth of the Celestial Realm; was he already close to succeeding?

No, no, not being repressed by the heaven and earth was one thing, but possessing the power of another realm was another. Even the Dark Inverse Realm had only sent Wally and another super elite into this realm to steal the power of heaven and earth of the Foreign Realm after absorbing all the knowledge of the high-level dimension.

Ling Han was extremely curious. Could it be that the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity had gone to cultivate in the Celestial Realm, and had thus managed to comprehend the essence power of the Celestial Realm?

But the overall level of the Celestial Realm was lower, and a Heavenly Venerate would be immediately targeted the moment they appeared. Those like the Heavenly Venerates of the Foreign Realm would be further repressed. This was no joking matter. Otherwise, Ling Han did not believe that the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable was so strong that he was capable of facing off against everyone on his own when the nine great Heavenly Venerates attacked the Celestial Realm together.

It had to be that the heaven and earth of the Celestial Realm had repressed them, and that was why the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable had managed to perform a miracle.

But precisely because of this, it was really too inconceivable that the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity had managed to cultivate the power of heaven and earth of the Celestial Realm.

‘Hold on, I have overlooked an important clue!’

Ling Han recalled the human slaves on Divine Desolate Mountain. They were beings that had originated from the Celestial Realm. Could they be related to the fact that the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity had successfully comprehended this kind of power?

These beings were too insignificant. Logically, there was no way that they could help a Heavenly Venerate comprehend the power of heaven and earth of another realm, but judging from the present situation, what deduction would be more logical than this?

‘I will discuss it further with Wally later.’

“Junior Brothers and Junior Sister, congratulations, congratulations!” The moment the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity left, Zi Shuang and the others approached, offering congratulations to Ling Han and the others.

The Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity had taken 36 disciples previously, and 11 of them had already completed their training and become independent. Some were at the Two Realm Battlefield, resisting the invasion of the Dark Inverse Realm, some were part of the invading troops against the Celestial Realm, and some were roaming the world, longing to take the final step, and advance into the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

There were only 25 disciples presently here, and there were as many as 19 among them that were still at the Ninth Lotus. They were all disciples that the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity had taken in the last few billion years. Previously, the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity had been very careful in taking disciples. He had not demanded that they all had high natural talent, but they all had their unique traits, unlike now, when he would only take disciples that had astonishingly high natural talent.

These disciples all had their own secret schemes, especially those who were similarly at the Ninth Lotus. Everyone would soon become direct competitors. Though they were very cordial in their words, a storm was already brewing in secret.

Those like Feng Hailuan and Sihuang Yun were glaring coldly and angrily at Ling Han, making no effort to conceal their animosity.

Ling Han was in no mood to bother about them. After speaking a few casual words with them, he brought the three women back to his quarters, and then immediately related the doubts that he had.

The three women were naturally extremely stunned by this, and offered their own deductions on the identity of the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity. Could it be that he was a Heavenly Venerate that had betrayed the Celestial Realm?

Ling Han asked Wally, and the latter directly replied that he did not have enough information, and was thus unable to make his deductions.

Ling Han thought for a long time, and decided to first set this matter aside. Instead, he had to save the slaves here.

Whether these people needed Ling Han to save them was not important, because they had already been completely brainwashed. Helping to free them from the fate of being slaves would instead grain their hatred, but if their existence would help the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity to comprehend the power of heaven and earth of the Celestial Realm, then Ling Han was determined to take them away with him no matter what.

He waited for a few days, and secretly grasped the situation on Divine Desolate Mountain. He knew where these human slaves resided, and then all he had to do was wait—until that sliver of divine sense of the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity left.

If he did something in the presence of the divine sense of this Heavenly Venerate, he would definitely be caught red-handed.

If you tried hard, you were bound to succeed eventually. Three years later, the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity received a message from another Heavenly Venerate, and left to attend a conference of Heavenly Venerates. Ling Han finally found his chance.

In a single stroke, he had taken one-third of the human slaves, and when he was just about to take a few more in, he alerted an Ancestral King, so he could only hide himself in the Black Tower and retreat.

On the second day, a great commotion instantly arose on Divine Desolate Mountain.

Someone had actually barged into the place of enlightenment of a Heavenly Venerate, and kidnapped people!

The main body of the Heavenly Venerate Desolate Eternity naturally could not be disturbed, and his sliver of divine sense had already left. Thus, this matter could only be delegated to the two Ancestral Kings.

Originally, everything that happened here would be handled by Ancestral King Nahua. He had just broken through to Tenth Lotus 700 million years ago, and was now already a Twelfth Lotus existence, his advancement being astonishingly rapid.

Because he was a monarch tier, he would be able to reach the height of Thirteenth Lotus or Fourteenth Lotus with his own power even without the guidance of a Heavenly Venerate.

But because this matter was about the pride of the line of the Desolate Eternity, he invited Zhi Kong to join him, and the two great Ancestral Kings investigated this matter together.

This naturally produced zero results. The protective barrier around the mountain had not been damaged in the slightest, and they could not understand how this great thief had managed to barge in no matter how hard they thought.

More importantly, why had this great thief kidnapped so many of their human slaves?Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels
