“Binghe, you have already advanced to the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier. Just in time, the Realm Battlefield has also concocted several Seven Deaths Seven Explosions Pills, which would be extremely beneficial for your cultivation. I have already requested a spot for you. There is no need for you to continue cultivation in seclusion here. It is time for your name to be known throughout the whole world.”

In a canyon covered with ice and snow, an old, gray-haired man spoke to someone. His beard reached all the way to his chest, but his body looked like it was formed from light and shadow, and did not seem very real.

This was because this was not his actual body, but the form taken by a sliver of divine sense. His real body was still at the Realm Battlefield.

This was a supreme character because it wasn’t just anyone that could request an additional spot.

!!

“Yes, Master.”

Peng! A young man broke out of the ice and emerged. His upper body was bare, his skin as fair as snow and as smooth as jade, reflecting the light cast upon him and exuding a gem-like luster. He had a head of black locks that reached his waist, fluttering in the mountain winds, and also revealing his face.

Solemn, calm, and determined, as well as radiating an absolute confidence.

After the gray-haired elder made his remark, this sliver of divine sense also vanished, turning into countless shards and scattering.

This young man raised his head, looking at the skies. “From this day onwards, I, Tie Binghe, will become a legend that will be spread all around this world as it enters into my era!”

At the shores of a great ocean.

“Changjun, how many years have you been by my side?” a child that looked to be only six or seven years old asked. His arms were crossed behind his back, acting all aged and experienced.

Behind him, there was a tall, sturdy young man. All of his muscles stuck out strongly, as if they were rocks.

This young man’s surname was Qi, and his full name was Qi Changjun.

“In reply to Master, about 700,000,000 years,” Qi Changjun answered respectfully, and did not at all treat the other party lightly just because he looked like a child.

He knew that this was the mysterious technique that his master cultivated. Every time he experienced the cycle from infanthood to old age, his cultivation level would advance another step. By now, his master had already experienced this six times in total.

The Windy Clouds Heavenly Venerate, Sixth Tier!

This child in front of him was not the Windy Clouds Heavenly Venerate’s true body, either, but just a sliver of his divine sense.

The Windy Clouds Heavenly Venerate nodded. “In the blink of an eye, you have grown up from that little kid you were.”

“It is all thanks to the teachings of Master!” Qi Changjun said, his head lowered and his eyes filled with adoration.

Years ago, he had only been a little homeless beggar. How could he have possibly dared to imagine that there would be a day when he could become a dignified Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate?

“At the Realm Battlefield, several Seven Deaths Seven Explosions Pills have been concocted recently. This would be beneficial for you,” the Windy Clouds Heavenly Venerate said casually. “I have already requested a participation spot for you. Go, and there is no need for you to return here again. Kill the enemies at the Realm Battlefield so that you can break through to the Heavenly Venerable Tier as soon as you can.”

“Yes, Master.”

At the Tu Clan.

The Tu Clan was an established noble clan. Their grand elder was a Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate, and was strong enough to look down on the rest of the world.

“Seven Deaths Seven Explosions Pills have once again appeared? Haha, I, Tu Shi, will use this opportunity to appear, and it is also time that the rest of the world knows that aside from the Three Dragons of the Tu CLan, there is also a supreme ferocious tiger!”

A young man laughed loudly as he walked out of his mansion, soaring into the skies.

***

At the Zhu Clan.

This was also an established noble clan. A Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerate had once emerged from this clan, but this mighty figure had already fallen in the war against Hysteria. However, the Zhu Clan still had a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate, who was supporting the whole clan.

For the sake of that grand elder of the Zhu Clan who had passed, the various forces were still very willing to give the Zhu Clan some face. However, the more favors were used, the fewer there would be. After all, they could not keep using their grand elder as a card to garner compassion.

“Yan’er, your natural talent is outstanding. It is possible that your future accomplishments would surpass the grand elder’s. I hope that when you appear this time, you will be able to make your name known, and show the world the prestige of the Zhu Clan once more!” In the main hall, a gray-haired old man was presently talking to a young girl.

This young girl was as beautiful as peach flowers, but her expression was cold as ice. She nodded. “Please don’t worry, Seventh Granduncle. Yan’er will definitely not disappoint the hopes of the clan!”

“Very good, this time, you must make your way into the top three! And we have also used up all that remaining favors we had just to obtain this one spot for participation. In the future, we really will have to depend all on ourselves.”

“Yan’er understands.”

At Cloud Void Waterfall, the Wu Clan.

This was a dangerous area that was well-known in the Flaming Frost Realm. It was located in the boundless Star Sea. A waterfall flowed upside down from the starry skies, and should one look closer, they would realize that what was flowing here was not water, but rather Qi of Primal Chaos. Every streak of Qi was as heavy as a star, which was extremely terrifying.

The Wu Clan was located at Cloud Void Waterfall. Usually, not even lower-level Celestial Kings were worthy of entering.

This was one of the strongest clans of the Flaming Frost Realm, or even the entire Genesis World, because the grand elder of the Wu Clan was a Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerate!

“Hahahaha!” Following a loud laugh, a figure traversed out of Cloud Void Waterfall. His black hair fluttered wildly, and his eyes seemed capable of penetrating through the void like light, filled with dominance.

“I, Wu Haoyang, have finally come out of seclusion!

“Now, there is no one in the world that knows the great name of Wu Haoyang, but it will not take too long before this name is known everywhere in the world!

“Lin Youlian, Xin Qihu, it is not just the two of you that can communicate with the fundamental power of the Genesis World at the Ninth Heaven; I can too!

“I will definitely surpass the two of you, and trample both of you under my feet!

“In this tournament of the Realm Battlefield, this will be the first battle for me, Wu Haoyang!

“Mediocre fools, prepare to tremble before me!”

There were a total of 28 additional spots in this tournament. As a result, it had drawn out a great many young prodigies. Previously, they would either keep a low profile or bury themselves completely in cultivation without concern for anything else. Now, however, they all emerged like a swarm.

However, Ling Han was completely ignorant of all this. His daily routine was just cultivating and cultivating while waiting for the battles to begin.

When he had the time, he would pay a visit to the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, discussing the further evolution of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll.

Though the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll had the method to practice a Heavenly Venerate Technique, it could not help a Heavenly Venerate’s physique cultivate to the complete level of Devouring Metal. This was because of the limitations of the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable himself. At the time, he himself had just been a First Tier Heavenly Venerate.

Moreover, he had “died” early, so he did not have so much time.

To comprehend a cultivation technique, a prodigy might only need 10 to 100 years, but the time needed to create a whole new cultivation technique was incredibly extensive, and even after it was created, an extremely large amount of time would still be necessary to make adjustments.

Ling Han felt that it was unfortunate that he had not forcefully dragged Wally here as well. Otherwise, this grandmaster of analysis would definitely be very helpful.

Of course, discussion of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll would only be done during their free time. At the moment, for Ling Han, the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable, and the others, their top priority was still to advance their cultivation level.

A month’s time passed very quickly, and it was almost time for the tournament to begin.

The authorities called this tournament “Minor Skill Demonstration.”

Though the participants were basically all Pseudo-Heavenly Venerates, in the Realm Battlefield, even they could only be considered side characters, so it could indeed only be considered a Minor Skill Demonstration.

Ling Han went to draw his lot first, and then waited for the results.

His first opponent was Gou Yan, and their match was also arranged first. There was no other reason except for the fact that Ling Han was presently the number one on the recent leaderboard.

When everyone was done drawing their lots, the battles officially began.

First match, Ling Han versus Gou Yan.

The latter was a young man of slender, lanky build, with a pair of mismatched eyes, one golden and the other silver, exuding a devilish air.

He showed a smile towards Ling Han, but his smile contained a strong hint of mockery. “The number one of the recent leaderboard, hehe, your name is well-known!”
