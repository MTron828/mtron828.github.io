2975 Resolved with a single punch

Feng Wuding charged over murderously.

After so many years of accumulation, Feng Wuding had become even more terrifying. He had already transformed all 100 Powers of Dimension in his body into real dimensions and strengthened them to his current limit.

He went all out, and 10 seals shone as soon as he attacked, emitting endless pressure.

10 first-grade seals, and they were all combination seals, increasing his battle prowess by almost 600 times. Moreover, the 100 dimensions were all extremely close to the level of high-level dimensions, emitting a terrifying might that could suppress the heavens. Once such an ultimate move was used, perhaps 99% of Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates could only retreat, not daring to face it head-on.

The current Feng Wuding was brimming with confidence. He believed that he could definitely suppress Ling Han and obtain the first victory in the series of battles between the two of them.

Meanwhile, Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains did not make another move. The five of them Seventh Tiers seemed to have a special kind of affection for Feng Wuding. Thus, even though he clearly wanted to kill Ling Han as well, he was willing to fulfill Feng Wuding’s wish and use Ling Han’s defeat to establish Feng Wuding’s reputation as the number one prodigy.

Boom! With boundless killing intent and might, Feng Wuding had already appeared right in front of Ling Han.

The entire world was in an uproar. The battle prowess of the peak stage of the Sixth Tier was fully displayed, indescribably powerful.

Even supreme prodigies like Lin Youlian, Xin Qihu, Wu Haoyang, and Bai Mifan felt dazzled. This was truly too powerful. Feng Wuding’s original power was infinitely close to the peak of the Sixth Tier, and with the addition of 10 first-grade combination seals and the suppression of 100 dimensions, how could anyone block this?

Even if the four of them joined forces, they would only be barely qualified to fight back. They definitely wouldn’t be able to take it head-on. They would need to drag it out until Feng Wuding’s combination seals completed their energy release. Only then would they truly be able to fight him.

As expected of the Son of Destiny chosen by the Genesis World of the last era. He was too terrifying.

How could Ling Han block it?

Everyone’s gaze turned towards Ling Han, and their expressions were complicated.

On the one hand, they hoped that Ling Han could win. After all, Ling Han was the representative of their generation’s Genesis World. However, on the other hand, Ling Han seemed to be Hysteria’s subordinate, so it was absolutely inappropriate for them to hope that he could win.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and shook his head. At the present moment, was there anyone who could still be a match for him within the Sixth Tier?

That had to be a joke.

He raised his fist, and threw a punch at Feng Wuding. It was light and nonchalant, without a trace of anger.

Peng!

Feng Wuding’s attack was immediately blocked, and he was sent flying backward. Cracks immediately appeared on the 100 dimensions that were released, and they almost collapsed.

Wh-what!

Everyone’s eyes widened, unable to believe what they were seeing.

Even if they couldn’t believe it, they had no choice but to believe it when seeing Feng Wuding had turned into a rolling gourd and rolled several hundred meters on the ground before coming to a halt. Although he managed to get up, his body was covered in blood, while his skin and flesh were lacerated. He looked extremely miserable.

Looking at Ling Han’s extremely relaxed and skillful manner, it seemed that as long as he wanted to, he would be able to blast Feng Wuding into smithereens with just a little more force.

Such an assured manner?

Hiss.

Feng Wuding found this the most unacceptable. He had already fine-tuned himself to his optimal state, and considered himself to be the strongest beneath the Seventh Tier. However, when he was really up against Ling Han, he finally realized that Sixth-Tier battle prowess could still be this fierce.

He was filled with resentment. Since the heavens had given birth to him, Feng Wuding, why was there another Ling Han?

“Wuding, there’s no need to be discouraged,” the Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains said calmly. “This despicable brat is Hysteria’s subordinate, so it’s not surprising that he knows some strange techniques. As long as you cultivate diligently, once you advance to the Seventh Tier, you will be able to suppress even Hysteria. Why would you need to take it to heart about this small loss today?

“I’ll help you erase this internal demon!”

He made his move, and boom, his right hand stretched out, and boundless fundamental power condensed into a huge hand of the heavens that slapped towards Ling Han.

Even if Ling Han had the strongest battle prowess of the Sixth Tier, when faced with this attack from the Seventh Tier, his expression could only change.

Could he block it?

Ling Han didn’t know, if he were to unleash all of his seventh-grade seals, and then release all of his dimensions, perhaps he might be able to block the attack for a while. However, this price was too great. If the dimension was to collapse, it would have been fine as he could repair it over a period of time, but if some of them were to be completely annihilated, then they would disappear forever.

He couldn’t take it head-on.

Ling Han was just about to tear a rip into the Void and leave, but another large hand reached over and forcefully pressed down the large hand that Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains had struck out.

“Lin Luo, it’s you again!” Shatter Mountains Heavenly Venerate said menacingly. “You actually dare to protect Hysteria’s people. Are you trying to betray us?”

“Hehe, everyone knows what kind of person I am. Why would I be afraid of you slandering me?” Lin Luo’s voice sounded, but his true body did not appear. “Don’t forget that our mission is to stall Hysteria. Whoever can obtain the dimension core will depend on their own luck. You’ve already crossed the line!”

The Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains’s expression turned ugly. In their previous agreement, it was indeed as Lin Luo had said—the Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates would hold back Hysteria and create an opportunity for the others.

However, the problem was that he had previously thought that Feng Wuding had been invincible against anyone below Seventh Tier, so it naturally hadn’t mattered as the core of this dimension definitely would have belonged to Feng Wuding.

But now? VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Feng Wuding was actually not a match for a single punch from Ling Han, so how could Shatter Mountains leave?

If Ling Han was allowed to obtain the dimensional core and use it to advance to the Fifth Tier, and thereafter possess the battle prowess of Seventh Tier, then what would happen in the future?

‘Kill him. He must be killed.’

He sent out a signal and contacted Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan and the others, asking them to hold Lin Luo back.

Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates were immortal and indestructible, but they could be held back, or, in fact, even suppressed.

“Today, this despicable brat must die!” the Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains said, brazenly attacking again.

Lin Luo’s large hand still stretched out to block, but just as he reached out, a booming sound was heard. “Friend Lin, you should just watch from the sidelines!”

Boom! A third hand reached out, causing the heavens to tremble.

It was Heavenly Venerate Chong Yan.

Lin Luo’s large hand was blocked. To be able to advance to the Seventh Tier, which one of them wasn’t an emperor among prodigies, a prodigy among overlords; who would be weaker than the other?

Shatter Mountains’ large hand continued to swat at Ling Han, but right at this moment, the fourth person made his move. Peng, a fist smashed into Shatter Mountains’ large hand, shattering it.

A strike that could shatter a Seventh Tier’s attack? Then it had to have been a Seventh Tier who made such a move.

Who was it?

Bai Fan’s figure appeared. “Shatter Mountains, Chong Yan, both of you have crossed the line!”

“Crossed the line?” Heavenly Venerate Shatter Mountains laughed coldly. “How could we have crossed the line when we are eliminating traitors? On the other hand, it’s you all who are being too emotional. If this brat advances another step further, it will be too late for regrets.”

“There’s no need to waste your breath arguing with him. Attack.” A cold voice rang out. It was the Heavenly Venerate Big Dipper.

His figure appeared, followed by Heavenly Venerate Mysterious Feather and Heavenly Venerate Half Moon. The Seventh Tier Heavenly Venerates of the Genesis World of the last era had all completely shown up.

Lin Luo couldn’t help but fly into a rage. “You all really don’t have any sense of the bigger picture. You actually came all the way here. How can Brother Xin and the other two stop Hysteria?”

“It doesn’t matter. Killing this brat will only take an instant. It won’t be too late for us to go back,” Heavenly Venerate Big Dipper said indifferently, seemingly unconcerned.
