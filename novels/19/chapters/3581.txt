Chapter 3582: Acting skills off the charts

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The blade of the saber arrived. Ling Han casually snapped his fingers, and with a ding, the saber was sent flying.

The brawny man who had attacked screamed in agony. The web between his thumb and forefinger had been forcefully torn open, and blood was gushing out rapidly. This was an extraordinarily agonizing pain.

Ling Han showed no mercy. He tapped out another finger. Pu, a burst of energy shot out from an aperture and sank into the sturdy man’s eyes, instantly blasting his brain into mush.

The might of energy blasted from the aperture was slightly weaker, and against elites like Liu Huayun, it could only cause disturbance. However, not everyone was a one-star genius. The brawny man was only slightly stronger than the normal Mystery Realm Tier, and couldn’t even block an attack from Ling Han’s aperture.

Ling Han withdrew his finger, looking completely calm, as if he had only done something negligible.

However, quite a number of people in the vicinity saw this scene, and all of them were solemn.

A ruthless person had arrived.

None of them dared to provoke Ling Han. In any case, they hadn’t discovered where the Eighteen Claws of the Golden Eagle was yet, and it wasn’t time for the final battle yet.

Moreover, those who had the slightest bit of ability also believed that they could advance into the top 32, and could not possibly work too hard when competing for the cultivation technique. They would only obtain a ticket into the top 32 in advance,as well as a celestial technique. If they died for it, that would really be too wasteful.

Ling Han searched around on the mountaintop, but no one knew what the Eighteen Claws of the Golden Eagle looked like.

Inscribed on a stone slab? On a jade slab? Or drawn on a piece of paper or a piece of cloth?

Hence, this search was a little difficult. He had to keep his eyes open and search carefully.

Otherwise, this place having long since been crowded with so many people, wouldn’t it have already been found?

The battle was still continuing. Many people were thinking that since they had not found the celestial technique, they would just kill off the other competitors first. In any case, if they had killed most of them, they would still be able to guarantee that they would be able to enter into the round of 32.

Ling Han didn’t have the heart of a saint, so he didn’t step forward to stop the others. Since he had come to participate in the competition, he had to be prepared for this. After all, the others hadn’t used a knife to force anyone to ascend the mountain, so they could only accept their own fate.

Shouting filled the skies, and occasionally, there would be screams of agony. Some fled towards the foot of the mountain, not to find a place to hide, but rather to give up the game, and flee from the competition.

Ling Han ignored them. He had to find the celestial technique as soon as possible. That way, he would have more time to study it.

“Found it!” someone suddenly shouted.

Instantly, everyone’s eyes turned in that direction. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Underneath a massive boulder, there was a book that only had a corner exposed.

This should be the Eighteen Claws of the Golden Eagle!

The person who had called out had an expression of regret, as if he was regretting why he had called out. Wouldn’t it be better for him to silently make a fortune?

“Hahahaha, this is mine!” A figure flew over like a divine dragon, and delivered a palm strike at the rock, wanting to send the large rock flying, and take away the celestial technique that lay below.

“In your dreams!” Someone moved to stop him.

At this time, those that dared to make a move to snatch the celestial technique were naturally all elites. Ordinary people could only try their luck. If it really came to this kind of crucial moment, going up to snatch it would only be courting death.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

The fierce battle immediately began, and more and more elites joined in the fight. However, due to each other’s restrictions, no one was able to send the rock flying, and obtain the celestial technique that was beneath the rock.

Ling Han did not step forwards, because he remembered very clearly that when he had looked there previously, that book definitely did not exist.

Why had it suddenly appeared now?

Had that person really lost his composure due to his “surprise”?

Obviously not.

Ling Han caught sight of the person from before in the crowd, and very soon, he had located him. This was a young man of twenty-three or twenty-four years old. Previously, he still had a look of annoyance on his face, but now, he was sitting on a rock, a stalk of green grass in his mouth, leisurely watching the show.

As expected.

Ling Han walked over, leaned on a rock, and said, “Instigating such a great battle single-handedly, you must feel a great sense of accomplishment, right?” The young man smiled slightly, “What did you say? Why don’t I understand?” “You deliberately placed a book under a rock to trick others into discovering the celestial technique, which led to a bloody battle,” Ling Han said.

This time, the young man did not deny it. Instead, he asked, “How is it? My acting skills are very good, right?”

His acting skills were not all that impressive. It was just that he had a very good grasp of psychology, which instantly triggered a battle. Otherwise, if one thought about it carefully, there were actually quite a lot of flaws.

Ling Han told the truth, “Your acting is a little exaggerated, especially that display of annoyance at the end. That was a little over tge top.”

“En, en, I will definitely improve it next time.” The young man was quite modest, nodding repeatedly. Then, he stretched out his hand, “My name is Sima Huai, what about you?”

“Can Ye.” Ling Han also stretched out his hand.

Peng!

Right at this moment, someone finally took advantage of the chaos of the battle to shatter the rock, and picked up the book that was lying underneath.

He was extremely excited. Brandishing the book, he exclaimed, “I got it, I got it!”

Instantly, the attacks of the others all crashed towards him.

Though that person was extraordinary, he could not hold up to the combined attacks of so many strong opponents, and added with his extreme excitement and neglect of defense, he was instantly blasted into smithereens.

His expression was filled with disbelief. He had already obtained the celestial technique. Logically speaking, the members of the Primordial Sect should have appeared to receive him, so how could they just stand by and watch as he was killed?

He forcibly raised the book in his hand higher. As his eyes swept over it, he suddenly could not catch his breath, and died.

There were shockingly seven words written on it: “Analysis of Three Hundred Ancient Poems.”

‘Holy f*ck! I’ve been screwed over!’

That person’s eyes were wide open, revealing a strong defiance. He was definitely dying with remaining grievances.

The others naturally discovered this as well, and all of them were seething with anger. They had actually been tricked!

Shua, these people turned their heads at the same time, and looked towards Sima Huai.

Sima Huai’s acting skills instantly went off the charts. An expression of extreme terror appeared on his face, and he pointed at Ling Han and said, “Everyone, I was also forced! It was him. He told me to place that book under a rock, and to say that I had found the celestial technique.”

He was filled with righteous indignation, and put on the appearance of a victim.

F***, he could do that?

Ling Han was surprised. He had really underestimated Sima Huai’s desire to show off. He had a feeling that Sima Huai’s strength was extremely strong. Even if he could not sweep aside all those people, it would be very easy for him to carve out a path of survival.

However, he was just playing it on the spot, and screwed Ling Han over.

Ling Han shook his head. This kind of weirdo was really rare.

“It’s you?” Everyone set their eyes on Ling Han. Though they were still a little doubtful, they had already believed him seventy percent. That was because if Ling Han had no relation with Sima Huai, why would the two of them be standing so close to each other?

It was clear that the two of them were just watching the show.

Damn it, this was too despicable.

Ling Han smiled faintly, “If I said that it had nothing to do with this matter, you guys wouldn’t believe me either, right?”

“He admitted it. It really has nothing to do with me. I was forced,” Sima Huai immediately called out.

“Shut up!” A red-haired man shouted, then said with killing intent, “Why don’t we just kill both of them!”
