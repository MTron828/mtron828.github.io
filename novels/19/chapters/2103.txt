Chapter 2104: Adding Drama

Yang Xiao understood the situation. It was time for him to impress.

He was the first to step forward, afraid that Ling Han might seize this opportunity instead. If Ling Han stepped forward, how could he impress anyone? Even though these seven people all looked unfamiliar, just how many people were in the Vicious Bear Gang? Thus, it was only natural that he didn’t recognize all of them.

“What are you people trying to do?” he chided.

“What are we trying to do?” a young man asked with a wanton chuckle. He peered at the Empress and Hu Niu, and replied, “We’re obviously here to do these girls!”

“Hahahaha!” The six people behind him all roared with laughter.

“Good one, Young Master Bing!”

“Even a casual remark from Young Master Bing is golden. This is a remark that can go down through the ages!”

“Wonderful, wonderful!”

The six people fervently sucked up to Young Master Bing, causing him to feel extremely smug.

Ling Han was slightly astonished. Things seemed slightly off. He unleashed his divine sense, sending it far into the distance. A smile then spread across his face.

‘Interesting.’

He pushed aside any thought of stepping forward and using violence. At the same time, he faintly shook his head at the Empress and Hu Niu, gesturing for them to remain calm.

The Empress and the others had indeed felt the urge to lash out. This person actually dared to speak such vulgarity before them? How could they not be enraged?

However, since Ling Han had gestured for them to remain calm, there was definitely a reason for this.

They would endure this for a moment.

“Humph, you actually dare to harass innocent women in broad daylight? How truly audacious!” Yang Xiao said with an ice-cold expression. However, he couldn’t help but give them a thumbs-up in his mind. As expected of a gang of thugs. They didn’t need to act at all, since they were naturally thugs.

Young Master Bing’s expression suddenly darkened, and he mused, “You’re very arrogant, huh? You actually dare to utter nonsense before me?”

“Exactly! Do you know who Young Master Bing is?”

“His identity will scare you to death!”

“Forget about it. Just kill him and be done with it. After all, Young Master Bing has developed an interest in those beautiful women.”

“I’ll do it!”

A man stepped forward. He was dressed in gray, and his clothes looked extremely ordinary at first glance. Upon closer inspection, however, one would realize that his clothes weren’t ordinary at all. The soft glow of a formation pulsated, and this was definitely a treasured item of clothing.

“Brat, die!” the man roared as he threw a punch.

Yang Xiao felt even more grateful toward Xiong Si. His fourth brother was truly willing to invest. In fact, he had even prepared such valuable clothing for a mere thug! Their acting was far too realistic!

These thoughts flashed through his mind, yet he didn’t hesitate at all as he lashed out in response.

Peng, peng, peng!

An intense battle broke out, and it wasn’t long before Yang Xiao gained the upper hand. Moreover, this was an overwhelming advantage he had.

They were both at the fourth severance, yet Yang Xiao was a king tier, while his opponent was only an ordinary cultivator. Thus, the gulf between them quickly became evident.

Yang Xiao was feeling extremely smug at this moment. He was truly enjoying this performance.

Just look! How incredibly mighty he was!

Peng!

His palm strike struck the man in the chest, sending him stumbling backward. At the same time, he even gave a meaningful blink, seemingly saying, “Brother, your performance was fairly great. When you return, Fourth Brother will definitely reward you well.”

“Oof!” The man groaned as he retreated 30 steps before finally coming to a stop. There was a salty taste in his mouth, and when he wiped his hand across it, he saw blood.

“Gui Er, what’s wrong?” the others asked.

The man was enraged as he pointed at Yang Xiao, and shouted, “This person is a freak! He was making eyes at me!”

“What?!” The thugs behind Young Master Bing were all transfixed with shock. Making eyes at a man? Just how much of a freak was this person?

“Gui Er, he even touched your chest just then!” some exclaimed in alarm.

Gui Er’s face turned green with disgust as he clutched his chest.

‘Indeed! Why did he insist on striking my chest? There were so many other places he could have targeted!’

‘Freak?!’

Meanwhile, Yang Xiao was also feeling completely stumped. This wasn’t part of the plan! Why were they calling him a freak? What the f*ck? Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The Empress and the others finally came to a realization at this moment. They communicated with Ling Han using their divine sense, asking, “These people aren’t from the Vicious Bear Gang?”

“No, they’re not,” Ling Han replied with a shake of his head. “The people from the Vicious Bear Gang are still making their way over here, but I’ve already sent a divided soul over to cause some trouble for them. They won’t arrive any time soon.”

He had sent his Nine Heavens Flame divided soul over, and with its grasp of the Regulations of Time and the Regulations of Space, those Severing Mundane Tier thugs were guaranteed to be trapped there for a long time. Moreover, even though time would have slowed down for them, they wouldn’t realize it at all.

“So… these seven people are genuine thugs then?” Bewitching Maiden Rou asked in astonishment.

“Mm-hm.” Ling Han smiled as he nodded.

Things were getting a little interesting now.

“This person is fairly strong. We need to send Brother Jun over to deal with him.” The thugs all turned around to glance at a relatively short man. He looked to be in his thirties, and his appearance was extremely ordinary.

However, even Young Master Bing became slightly more respectful as he said, “Brother Jun, please deal with this person.”

The man nodded, and replied, “Since Young Master Bing has asked, I naturally have no reason to refuse.” He strode forward as he said this, and flashes of light appeared on all 10 of his fingers. Surprisingly, there was a ring on each of his fingers, and these rings were all as pitch-black as ink.

Yang Xiao suddenly tensed up. He could feel an overwhelming pressure exuding from this person.

He couldn’t explain what was going on. This was simply his intuition as a king tier.

‘F*ck! This is only a performance! Is there any need to be so serious?!’

“If you want to live, kneel down and beg for forgiveness,” Brother Jun said in a calm voice. He cracked his knuckles as he said this.

Yang Xiao wore an arrogant expression, and he immediately immersed himself in the performance again. “I, Yang Xiao, have never begged for forgiveness! Immediately apologize to my junior sister and the four ladies. Otherwise, I’ll have you understand the terror of my rage!”

“You’re seeking death!” Brother Jun said with a sneer.

Whoosh!

With a flash, he charged toward Yang Xiao.

‘Hmm? He’s only an ordinary fourth severance cultivator?’

Yang Xiao was slightly astonished. He had clearly felt overwhelming pressure from this person, so how was the latter only an ordinary fourth severance cultivator? Yang Xiao didn’t dare to be careless, and his hands immediately spread open as he unleashed a celestial technique.

Boom!

The power of Regulations surged, and the power of the great dao collided.

However, how could an ordinary fourth severance cultivator rival a king tier? Thus, it wasn’t long before Brother Jun was also pushed onto his back foot. However, Young Master Bing and the others didn’t appear worried about this at all. It was as if they held unwavering confidence in this Brother Jun.

Yang Xiao also found this to be understandable. His opponents were most likely putting on this demeanor to amplify the effects of their performance.

By the looks of it, he had indeed been overthinking things.

“This person… most likely possesses a Divine Fetus.”

“Poisonous Fetus,” the Empress added.

“Huh? Detestable!” Hu Niu said in disgust.

Poisonous Fetuses were also a type of Divine Fetus. However, they were an extremely unique type of Divine Fetus.

“Divine Fetuses can also come powerful or weak. His Divine Fetus is far too weak, so he can most likely only launch a single strike with it. Thus, he’s waiting for an opportunity,” Ling Han said as he observed the battle.

“Anyhow… it’s almost time for victory and defeat to be decided.”

Yang Xiao had already become impatient. After all, his might could only be highlighted if he achieved victory in two or three exchanges. So, why in the world were they dragging this battle on for so long?

He roared in fury as he abandoned his defenses, and lunged at Brother Jun.

After abandoning his defenses, his offensive power naturally rose by an explosive amount.

Boom!?He was like a tidal wave as he bore down on Brother Jun.

“Explode!” Brother Jun roared. He wasn’t fazed in the slightest. In fact, a faint smile spread across his face. This was a smile of extreme ridicule.

Pa, pa, pa, pa!

The rings on his fingers exploded, causing plumes of green smoke to flood the surroundings.

At this moment, Yang Xiao finally understood the source of his discomfort. This green smoke was definitely brimming with extreme poison that could instantly kill or severely wound him. In any case, he definitely had to avoid this green smoke.

‘F*ck! This is completely different from what we agreed on! How in the world are you people performing? Why are you randomly adding drama for yourself! Do you still want to stay in the gang or not?!’
