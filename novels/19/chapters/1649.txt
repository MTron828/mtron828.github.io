Chapter 1650: Yuan Tribe

Ling Han could not distinguish the exact cultivation levels of these three young men, but when the other party moved, he could determine his battle prowess.

Not cultivation level, but battle prowess.

That was because the cultivation technique this person cultivated was incredibly strange. It was not like the traditional type, and one could not use Heavenly Body Tier or Genesis Tier to call their cultivation levels. It could only be said that his battle prowess was comparable to Eternal River Tier.

It was just like... this young man had created a completely different system of cultivation!

This was quite amazing. Though creating a cultivation technique was very difficult, a top-grade prodigy would be able to accomplish this feat, but establishing a completely new system of cultivation would mean starting from zero, and making something out of nothing. This was a completely new innovation.

Of course, Ling Han definitely did not think that this young man had such a nature-defying ability, but rather it was his ancestors that had created a completely new system of cultivation, and he was only cultivating according to it.

In this ancient land that had been closed off from the outside world for who knew how many years, there had actually appeared a group of cultivators that cultivated a different system of cultivation!

...From the word “outsiders”, he knew that these three were the natives at this time. Furthermore, their battle prowess was comparable to the high extreme or the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier, which meant that this cultivation system was already very mature, and there were definitely Saint-level seniors present.

However, though creating a new system of cultivation was very impressive, in the end, everything still revolved around power.

How was Eternal River Tier-level battle prowess supposed to match a Saint? What more when even Ling Han could not clearly feel Xiao Gu’s strength. He only knew that the latter was very, very strong, and even he felt a wariness and reluctance to become enemies with Xiao Gu.

Peng!

The young man’s attack landed on Xiao Gu. Being able to hit his target was not because that young man was strong, but rather because Xiao Gu had not dodged or parried at all.

The thought processes of Xiao Gu were completely different from normal human beings’.

His expression was filled with curiosity, and he asked, “Yiyaya?” What he meant was ‘Why did you hit me? And using such a completely useless attack at that.’

Yet the young man was startled. He had not expected that Xiao Gu would be so strong that his attack was rendered completely ineffective. But he did not panic, and still proudly proclaimed, “Don’t make me bring our tribe elders, or your only path would be death! Hand over the precious medicine!”

The two young men beside him elbowed him, signaling him to look towards the three extraordinary beauties, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, Long Yushan, and Long Xiangyue.

That young man seemed to be their leader. As his eyes swept over them, his heart involuntarily throbbed wildly. These three women were all exquisitely beautiful, indescribably beautiful! Though he was cultivating a different system, his aesthetic tastes were no different from normal.

“And these three women, too, have to follow us back to the tribe!” he added.

Ling Han couldn’t help but sneer. Had these three people’s heads been kicked by a donkey? Three minor characters with merely Eternal River Tier battle prowess dared to have designs on a Saint? A thought flashed in his mind, and he said, “Then, we’ll all go and take a look at your tribe.”

“What gives you the right?” The young man in the lead slanted a look at Ling Han, a completely condescending expression on his face.

Ling Han stretched out his hand, and as his aura surged, pa, pa, pa, those three young men immediately knelt, their bodies sweating madly. They felt as if their hearts were about to burst.

“Lead the way,” Ling Han stated calmly. “If you blabber any more nonsense, I will begin to commit murder. In any case, I only need one of you to be alive to lead the way.”

All three of them trembled. They could clearly sense a frightening killing intent from Ling Han’s tone, and hurriedly nodded, beginning to lead the way ahead. However, they were sneering internally. ‘You all can be as arrogant as you like now, but when we enter the tribe, all the elites will mobilize, and that will be the time of your deaths!’

Ling Han saw their expressions clearly, and was completely indifferent. With his present strength, he would be unafraid even if he was faced with a peak stage Saint King. In the entire Ancient Realm, there was no longer any elite that could suppress him.

As they traveled, Ling Han asked the three of them about the situation here, and under his intimidating pressure, the three young men did not dare to lie.

They called themselves the Yuan Tribe, and resided in this area. It had been that way for generations, and they had already passed hundreds of billions of years, at least. It had been such a long time that even the Godly metal that recorded their history had already worn away, and their history could no longer be traced.

There were a considerable number of other tribes like them, and they were all distributed in the proximity of the great river. The nearer they were to the upper course, the stronger the tribe would be, and the Yuan Tribe was the weakest.

Of course, though they were the weakest, they were not all that weak, either. The tribal chief’s strength was at the level of peak stage Saint King, and the tribal elders were at the level of ordinary Saint Kings. Every tribe would have at least five such elites. It was not clear how many Saint Kings there were in the tribe in the uppermost course of the river, but the Yuan Tribe had five, and their close neighbor, the Cheng Tribe, similarly had five Saint Kings as well.

Why did they live along the river?

It was not for the sake of survival, but rather for the purpose of cultivation!

They had drunk water from that great river since their childhood. That would allow their rate of cultivation to soar, and they had already advanced into the Saint Tier in a short 100,000 years. If anyone heard that, they would be terrified to death!

...You can work hard on cultivation in the outside world, and after a few hundred million years, it was still possible that it was all wasted effort, and you would stay at the consummate level of the Eternal River Tier, unable to progress further. However, here you merely had to drink some water and cultivate for a while, and becoming a Saint Tier would be an easy feat.

However, this was only suited to them.

There had been outsiders before that had also taken water to drink, and the result was their bodies had directly exploded, which led to their deaths.

This was of no relation to cultivation level. That was because the babies born here were only in the Heaven Tier and Shattering Void Tier, yet they could still easily drink the river water. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Apparently, this still had to fit their unique system of cultivation.

The further up the river’s course, the more essence of great dao there was in the river water. Thus, there were frequent wars among the tribes. They all hoped to move to a location that was further up the river’s course so that their tribe could become stronger and stronger.

As they spoke, they had already arrived at the Yuan Tribe.

This was a massive primitive tribe. It was clearly incredibly huge, but there were no cities built. Instead, there were multiple tents that extended into the distance. Some were houses that had been built with wood. In any case, they were all very simple.

There really were a lot of people here, numbering in the millions, and they were all like these three young men, dressed in a strange attire and covered in black patterns all over their bodies. Aside from them, they could also see obvious outsiders there. When they walked among them, it was like there was a flag on each of them. They were all too obvious.

Apparently, this was the first station for outsiders.

And it was at this moment that the three young men suddenly called out in gibberish. Suddenly, the surrounding natives all surrounded them, all of them showing a powerful animosity.

A middle-aged man walked out of the crowd. His aura was very strong, and judging based on Ling Han’s experience, this person should have reached the Saint Tier, but he was only comparable to a Small Saint.

In this place, Saints were completely common. Simply walk around, and you would meet with Saints here and there.

This could be treated like a miniature version of the Celestial Realm. Furthermore, it had long since been severed from the Celestial Realm, and pushed into the cracks of the Ancient Realm. Even here, there were Saints everywhere. Then, when they went to the Celestial Realm, there really would be as many Saints as there were dogs.

The Notionless Saint’s and Long Yushan’s feeling of superiority as Saints was immediately battered to nothing.

“Let them go!” the middle-aged man declared coldly.

“Let, them, go!” Seeing so many new people, Xiao Gu was excited, and naturally began to imitate words again.

The middle-aged man cast a look on Xiao Gu, and showed a sliver of anger, but he did not take it to heart, and continued, “Now that you have entered our Yuan Tribe, you still dare to be arrogant?”

Xiao Gu repeated, “Now, that, you, have, entered, our, Yuan...”

‘Holy f*ck!’

“You’re looking for death!” The middle-aged man was furious, and shot out a palm strike at Xiao Gu.
