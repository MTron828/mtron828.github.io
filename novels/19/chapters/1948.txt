Chapter 1949: Counterfeit

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

However, it was useless regardless of how sincere Liu Jie was. This was because Ling Han was truly from the Calm Peace Heaven.

In fact, in Ling Han’s view, it was completely pointless to group people according to the Wide Prosperity Heaven or the Calm Peace Heaven. After all, the Source Power of heaven and earth would actively choose its own master. That being the case, why didn’t everyone cooperate to arrive before the Fiery Flame Lightning Strike Wood? Wouldn’t that be a better option?

In any case, it would be useless regardless of how much they competed.

However, it was a shame that no one would accept this proposal. This was a valuable treasure, so they naturally had to fight over it. Those who were powerful would make the rules.

Liu Jie felt that this was a shame. However, Ling Han was insistent on rejecting his proposal, and he even persisted with the excuse of being from the Calm Peace Heaven. This caused him to feel displeased and impatient, so he gave up on trying to persuade Ling Han any further.

According to his original plan, he had to pick five emperor tiers to team up with Liu Han and him. That way, they could form the Seven Star Dazzling Moon Formation. This formation would most likely be strong enough to rival the top monarch tiers of the Wide Prosperity Heaven.

After picking five emperor tiers, the banquet continued, and the conversation moved away from cultivation.

Meanwhile, Liu Han became more and more interested in Ling Han. There were few female monarch tiers, yet monarch tiers all had extremely high standards. They definitely wouldn’t be willing to marry a man inferior to them. Thus, they would only have a very, very small pool of people to choose from.

With her impression of Ling Han changed, Liu Han naturally felt that he was more and more likable. She wanted to become an intimate friend with him.

Of course, being an intimate friend and lovers were two completely different matters. However, for a monarch tier such as herself, her lover would definitely have to begin as an intimate friend.

“Celestial Maiden Liu Han, I’ve heard that one can only have the right to chase after you if they defeat you?” someone asked as they saw Liu Han exchanging whispers with Ling Han. They were feeling extremely jealous.

In any case, Liu Han had said this herself. If one couldn’t defeat her, then they wouldn’t have the right to chase after her. Thus, if Ling Han wanted to chase after Liu Han, he would need to defeat her first, no? Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

A look of displeasure spread across Liu Han’s face. Why was this person so annoying?

“At the same cultivation level, only few people in the world can defeat Celestial Maiden Liu!”

“No wonder Celestial Maiden Liu is still single even though she’s so stunningly beautiful.”

Many people were feeling extremely jealous, and they all spoke before Liu Han could say anything. They were intent on keeping Ling Han and Liu Han apart.

Ling Han simply smiled and continued to drink wine. He had only been speaking to Liu Han because she had been asking him about celestial techniques. He had also become interested, so he exchanged a few more words with Liu Han. He had no other thoughts.

These people... Couldn’t their minds be purer?

Liu Han’s expression darkened, and she suddenly blinked before revealing a beautiful smile. She turned to Ling Han, and said, “Brother Ling, why don’t you have a spar with me?”

Ling Han rubbed his nose. He wasn’t underestimating Liu Han, but with his current strength, Liu Han most likely didn’t have the right to spar with him. This wouldn’t be an equal battle, but instead a question of how many strikes she could block.

“Ugly sh*t, I’ll spar with you!” someone suddenly said. Ling Han looked over, only to see a youth striding over. He looked to be around 17 or 18, and he was as handsome as could be.

Ling Han had seen many handsome people before, yet the sum of them wasn’t even one-tenth as handsome as this person.

Moreover, this young man looked extremely androgynous. If he changed into female clothes, he would definitely become a stunning beauty who could intoxicate many people.

Coincidentally, Ling Han had seen this person in female clothes before.

This was no handsome young man. Instead, it was Hu Niu in disguise!

With the skills of Celestials, hiding one’s Adam’s apple and shrinking one’s breasts was as easy as could be. If they wanted to disguise themselves, it would definitely be hard to see through them. Of course, this was unless one could examine them with Origin Power. At that time, they would be unable to conceal the true structure of their body.

Ugly sh*t?

At least half of the people became enraged upon hearing this.

This person actually dared to call Liu Han ugly sh*t? Didn’t he know that she was the second most beautiful woman in the entire Wide Prosperity Heaven? Only Shu Yarong, the Holy Daughter of the Black Flame Sect, could suppress her in terms of beauty.

If Liu Han was ugly sh*t, then would there still be any beautiful women in the world?

However, upon seeing Hu Niu, this young man was truly as handsome as could be. Although men and women couldn’t be compared, everyone reached the same conclusion when glancing between Hu Niu and Liu Han. That was, Hu Niu was far prettier than Liu Han.

Liu Han furrowed her brows in anger. This person actually dared to call her ugly sh*t before Ling Han? She clenched her fists in anger. However, upon seeing Hu Niu, her heart couldn’t help but flutter. She became slightly flustered and intoxicated.

Both Hu Niu and the Empress were paramount beauties who could intoxicate the entire world. When disguised as men, they could similarly intoxicate all women.

Liu Han’s anger instantly vanished into thin air. Her heart thumped in her chest, and she could even feel a warm blush spreading across her face.

She had never believed in love at first sight. She more so didn’t view herself as someone who was attracted by outward appearances. Upon seeing Hu Niu, however, she couldn’t stop her heart from fluttering.

Regarding Ling Han, she only felt some slight admiration. Facing this young man, however, she truly loved him to death.

She nodded, and said, “Fine, let’s spar.” She gracefully walked over.

Hu Niu glared at this “ugly sh*t”. She actually dared to seduce her Ling Han! She would definitely smash her into pieces so that she could never seduce Ling Han again!

Xiu, xiu!

The two of them leaped into the air, standing 300 meters away from each other.

The more Liu Han looked at Hu Niu, the more her body became limp and heated. This young man didn’t appear mighty and strong. However, he was far too handsome. His eyes were extremely lively, and it was as if they could speak. Her heart fluttered and thumped against her chest.

She decided that she would definitely let Hu Niu win, regardless of how strong or weak “he” was.

She had uttered those words herself, so she definitely had to abide by them. However, who said that she couldn’t lose on purpose?

However, her expression instantly changed when she saw Hu Niu attack.

‘So powerful!’

This wasn’t a king tier or an emperor tier, but rather a monarch tier!

Not only was she astonished, but everyone else was also stupefied.

Monarch tiers were like lone stars above the highest of heavens. They were extremely few in number. Now, however? Ling Han had suddenly popped up, and now it was this handsome young man. Just what in the world was going on?

Had monarch tiers... become worthless?

Even though the fortune of heaven and earth had undergone a transformation in the Wide Prosperity Heaven, leading to a sharp rise in the number of prodigies, it still hadn’t reached such an incredible stage, right?

Liu Han hurriedly unleashed her full power to battle against Hu Niu. However, she immediately became flustered, and she fell into an absolute disadvantage.

It was clear that Liu Han wasn’t going easy on Hu Niu.

However, Hu Niu was far too powerful. A pair of Roc wings unfurled from her back, allowing her movements to be quicker than lightning. Meanwhile, there were large fish symbols on her arms, and these fish even had a single horn on their heads. They felt even nobler than divine dragons.

“Source Beast... Roc!” someone exclaimed in astonishment.

No wonder this young man was so indescribably powerful. As it turned out, he possessed the bloodline of the Roc, a king-tier Source Beast. In other words, he had practiced the Celestial King techniques of the Roc! According to rumors, king tier Celestial Beasts were at least at the eighth heaven. More heaven-defying ones could even reach the ninth heaven and peer down on the entire Celestial Realm.

Hu Niu became engrossed in the fight, and with a long cry, the projection of a large fish materialized behind her body. However, it had a pair of Roc wings, and it was radiating with an aura of primordial nature. She was like a paramount being from the primordial ages, and it was as if she could suppress all matter from past to present.

Boom!

With a shudder, Liu Han was immediately sent flying. Her beautiful face became pale, and her hair also became slightly disheveled.

A monarch tier was easily defeated just like that.
