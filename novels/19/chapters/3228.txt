3229 Causing a Havoc in the Hu Clan

“Halt!” The servant hurriedly moved to block Ling Han.

Ling Han made a grabbing motion with his hand, and the servant couldn’t resist at all as he was sent flying.

Shua, that servant crashed over, and just happened to hit that young man. Peng, the two of them instantly fell into a heap.

The youth hurriedly struggled to his feet, and continued to chase after Ling Han. However, after chasing for a few steps, he saw that Ling Han had already entered the main hall.

Elegant music played, and there were some guests in the hall. However, there weren’t many people, and there were no musicians either. Instead, it was played by the optical computer, and through the sound system, it spread throughout the entire hall.

The music was loud, so Ling Han didn’t attract anyone’s attention when he entered.

Ling Han walked around casually. The wedding hadn’t begun yet, and he didn’t see any groom or bride.

“Oi! Oi!” That youth had also followed him in. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

When he called out, he immediately attracted everyone’s attention.

“Yi, Little Seventeenth?” Quite a number of people looked surprised.

This young man’s name was Hu Bin, and he was the seventeeth oldest among the younger generation of the Hu Clan. Thus, the seniors of the Hu Clan all called him Little Seventeenth.

“What’s wrong?”

“Today is your Ninth Brother’s big day. Why are you making such a big fuss?”

“Ling, Ling Han!” Hu Bin’s eyes soon found Ling Han, and pointed at him.

Instantly, everyone’s eyes were focused on Ling Han.

“Sigh, it really is him.”

“What is the Deputy Captain of the Xuanqing Banner doing here at our Hu Clan?”

“Who let him in? Why didn’t anyone announce him?”

A middle-aged man walked over, and asked Ling Han, “Captain Ling, what can I do for you?”

He was still quite polite, and did not directly reprimand Ling Han for barging into the Hu Residence. This could be considered as giving Lian Xuerong some face.

Ling Han gave an ‘oh’, and said, “I have come to find my little female attendant.”

“Your maidservant?” The middle-aged man’s expression was filled with curiosity. His name was Hu Cheng, and he was a Twelve Meridians. He found it strange that Ling Han’s maidservant would come to their Hu Clan.

He smiled, “Deputy Captain Ling, you must have made a mistake. This is the Hu Residence, so why would your maid come here?”

“There’s no mistake. She’s right here.” Ling Han nodded.

Hu Cheng’s expression turned cold, and he said, “Captain Ling, you’ve gone too far!”

“Hand her over, and hand over the culprit, and I will leave immediately,” Ling Han said calmly.

Whether it was Hu Cheng or anyone else, every member of the Hu Clan was almost angered to death.

F***, you have come to the Hu Clan, and still dare to threaten us?

“Ling Han, you’ve gone too far!” Hu Cheng said darkly.

“Have I gone too far?” Ling Han chuckled, “You guys kidnapped my maid, and I came to find her, and you actually say that I have gone too far?”

“Stop spouting nonsense,” Hu Cheng shouted coldly.

Ling Han sat down on the chair and said, “Alright, then let’s wait and see.”

“The Hu Clan does not welcome you!” Hu Cheng shouted. He had initially wanted to make a move, but he recalled that Ling Han was the champion of the martial arts tournament, and even Tuoba Tianhuang was no match for him, what more him.

If he made a move, he would only be seeking his own humiliation.

“Come—” He wanted to call out for security, but when he thought about it, the guards in the residence were all Meridian Opening Tier elites. If they attacked together, would they still be a match for Ling Han?

Thus, if he wanted to suppress Ling Han, he could only ask the elites of the clan to move.

The problem here was, for a junior to take a concubine, and furthermore, it was his eighth concubine, what need was there for a Blood Transformation Tier elite to attend?

Then what could they do?

How could it be that they would allow this brat to behave atrociously here?

No, then what face would the Hu Clan have?

“Xiao Xu, go and get Third Uncle.” He hurriedly called a young man over, and whispered into his ear.

“Yes.” That person immediately nodded and left.

The Third Uncle that Hu Cheng spoke of was a veteran elite of the Hu Clan. His name was Hu Chaosheng, and he was an elite of the Blood Transformation Tier. This was naturally enough to suppress Ling Han.

“Let’s see how long you can continue to be smug!” Hu Cheng said coldly in his heart.

Ling Han sat upright. On the surface, he appeared very calm, but killing intent was already intertwined in his heart.

At first, he had thought that after dealing with Zhong Yangbi, Hu Qiu would behave himself. He had not thought that this guy would still dare to mess around. En, he had not chosen a good surname[1].

A short while later, Hu Chaosheng came.

There was an obvious look of displeasure on his face.

Someone actually came to the Hu Clan to cause trouble. This made him very angry, and what made him even angrier was the fact that the clan members actually could not deal with this intruder, and even needed him to make a move?

What trash!

He arrived at the main hall, and saw Ling Han with a single glance. Ling Han was presently sitting in an armchair, sipping tea leisurely.

“So you are Ling Han?” he asked Ling Han.

Ling Han glanced at him, and said, “Enough with the nonsense. Give me back my maid.”

“You have come to our Hu Clan, and still dare to boast shamelessly?” Hu Chaosheng’s eyes were cold, “Humph, I shall capture you first.”

He moved, grabbing out at Ling Han.

A mere Meridian Opening Tier cultivator was nothing but trash in front of a Blood Transformation Tier cultivator, even if he had opened a few of the legendary Hidden Meridians. This was the case even if he was only at the First Change.

“Third Elder has moved.”

“This time, that madman is definitely going to die.”

“Humph, who asked him to actually dare come to our Hu Clan!”

When everyone saw Hu Chaosheng move, they all looked proud.

Ling Han shook his head. He didn’t stand up, and simply threw a punch.

Peng!

Their fist and palm had not even come into contact, and the force that they had released had already clashed. Then, like a scarecrow, Hu Chaosheng was sent flying with a swoosh.

He landed on the ground. Peng! A chair was smashed into pieces, and he slid for a long distance before finally coming to a stop.

At this moment, everyone was gaping in shock.

What had they seen?

“Am I seeing things?”

“Someone please tell me that the one sent flying wasn’t Third Elder but that bastard Ling Han.”

“It seems like… the one who was sent flying is really our Third Elder!”

“I-impossible!”

“This is absolutely impossible!”

Everyone could not believe it. Their Third Elder that was like a god in their eyes had actually been defeated by Ling Han. Furthermore, he had been defeated in a single move.

This drove them crazy, and their worldview crumbled.

Ling Han said calmly, “I’m still very polite now. As long as you return my maidservant and hand over the culprit, I’ll take them away. Otherwise, heh.”

The members of the Hu Clan were all furious. You have come to the Hu Clan to cause trouble, and actually still dare to say such words?

“Go and invite Second Elder.”

“There’s also Grand Elder!”

“Also, go to the Xuanqing Banner to find Lian Xuerong. I want to ask her how she teaches her subordinates.”

Immediately, someone rushed out of the main hall, and went to seek out the Second Elder and the Grand Elder of the Hu Clan, as well as Lian Xuerong.

Ling Han was completely unconcerned. He was in the right in today’s matter. Even if the City Lord was invited, he was not afraid.

If you want to play, I’ll oblige.

“Groom and bride — yi!” The person in the back hall did not know that something had happened ahead of them, and was guiding the groom and bride out. When he saw the chaotic situation in the main hall, he was immediately dumbfounded.

Ling Han looked at the young man in the bright red wedding attire, and asked, “So you are Hu Qiu?”

“Ling Han?” Hu Qiu’s eyes involuntarily narrowed.

[1] When Ling Han said that he had not chosen a good surname, he meant that he still continued to mess around, which is written as è????￥, ‘hu lai’ in Chinese, the same surname as Hu Qiu.
