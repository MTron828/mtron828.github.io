Chapter 3545: Strong clash

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han charged over, brandishing his hammer in a barrage of attacks.

“A mere Inscription Tier cultivator, do you really think you can defeat me just because you have a Spirit Tool?” The person sneered, brandishing his spear and attacking like he was wielding a staff.

Peng!

The hammer smashed into the spear, and with a crisp sound, both of them took a few steps back.

Ling Han gritted his teeth. The gap in cultivation level was really too wide. Even if Ling Han had caught him off guard with a One Star Tool, his battle prowess had only been weakened by a little, and it was still enough to stand against him.

However, the other person was even more astonished. Logically speaking, he should have been able to insta-kill those at the level of Inscription Tier. Now, however, they were evenly matched.

This was a supreme freak.

“I can’t let you live!” the man said coldly. As he stabbed with his spear, he continued, “My name is Huang Zhiting. Remember this name; that is the person who will send you on your way to the afterlife!”

“Hehe, there are many people who want to kill me, but so far, no one has succeeded, and you will be no exception,” Ling Han said calmly. He raised the battle hammer again, and zi, another flash of lightning shot out.

However, this time, Huang Zhiting was prepared. With a flash, he dodged.

“Haha, you’ve used it on me once, and you still want to succeed?” Huang Zhiting sneered. He was a Mystery Realm Tier elite, and for someone to reach the Mystery Realm Tier at this age, he could be called a genius.

Ling Han smiled, and shot out a murderous aura attack.

Huang Zhiting’s figure immediately paused, and a dazed expression appeared on his face.

Right at this moment, Ling Han brandished the battle hammer again, firing out lightning.

Zi, this time, it naturally hit its target.

Ling Han charged over again, swinging his hammer.

Peng!

Huang Zhiting was, after all, a Mystery Realm Tier. He was extremely powerful, and at the most crucial moment, he raised his spear above his head and blocked the barrage of the battle hammer. Although this caused his figure to be pushed downwards, he was still able to block this strike, after all.

Even so, his expression was still incredibly ugly.

He had just said that the technique that he had used once was ineffective on him, and in the end, he was hit again. Wasn’t this a slap to his own face?

Ling Han cracked a smile, “How about it?”

Huang Zhiting’s face flushed red. What else could he say?

He simply raised his spear and stabbed at Ling Han. As long as he killed Ling Han to prevent him from leaking the secret, this scandal from moments ago would never leak out again.

Ling Han laughed loudly. It was still the murderous aura barrage combined with the battle hammer. It was obviously very simple, but when they were combined, it showed extraordinary effects.

The murderous aura attack was an ability that had been created when he reached Seventh Change. Even Mystery Realm Tier-level elites were unable to resist it. Even if they were already hit once, they would still be hit again. At most, the time they would be dazed would only be slightly shortened.

However, Ling Han only wanted this instant, which was quickly followed by another strike from the battle hammer. Huang Zhiting would be hit no matter what, and would only have the power to parry in vain.

At this rate, Huang Zhiting would be defeated sooner or later.

How could this be?

Huang Zhiting was speechless. This brat had only used those two moves over and over again, but they were incredibly effective, causing him to be hit time and time again.

Losing to an Inscription Tier?

What kind of joke was this? He would never be able to hold his head high again.

He gritted his teeth, and finally drew out his trump card. This was a chess piece.

Yi, could this toss also produce a horse, or a cannon?

Just as Ling Han was complaining, Huang Zhiting had already slapped the chess piece onto his body. Suddenly, multiple flashes of silver light flickered on his body, and a silver-colored metal materialized, turning into a suit of armor that protected his entire body.

Tsk, this move was really unexpected.

“Damn it, you actually forced me to use the Silver Scaled Battle Armor!” Huang Zhiting said with slight heartache. He had paid a great price to obtain this, and it was not a real Battle Armor, but rather a consumable item.

These silver metals were formed by stimulating high-level Energy of Metal, so there was a problem of a time limit. When enough time had passed, they would naturally disappear.

However, within the time limit, his defenses were the best among those at Mystery Realm Tier.

This was his greatest trump card. However, Ling Han still had the Ten Thousand Star Stone on him. If he expended this for the sake of this Divine Stone to build his Celestial Foundation, it would still be worth it.

“Die!” Huang Zhiting raised his spear and attacked. Silver light flashed like he was a god of war. At this moment, he was extremely confident.

Ling Han shot out a murderous aura attack. Though it was still effective, the time it was effective was shortened by a bit. Huang Zhiting came back to consciousness almost in an instant, yet took the initiative to take on the lightning shot out by the battle hammer head-on, and came out of it completely unscathed.

“Hahaha, despair!” Huang Zhiting laughed loudly. Brandishing his spear, he arrived, stabbing or sweeping, pushing his offensive to the extreme.

Ling Han was calm and unhurried as he activated his movement technique. His speed wasn’t inferior to a Mystery Realm Tier, and he didn’t need to worry about his life at all.

He wanted to see how long his opponent could maintain this state.

However, they weren’t the only ones on this mountain path, and it wasn’t long before people arrived.

Ling Han’s brow wrinkled into a frown. He did not continue the battle, and turned to leave.

“Stop running!” Huang Zhiting hurriedly set off in pursuit. He had already used his trump card. If he couldn’t capture Ling Han, then he would have suffered a great loss.

Unfortunately, his speed was about the same as Ling Han’s. At first, he could still maintain a distance, but once the mountain path became more complicated, his control over his movements was completely inferior to Ling Han’s, so he could only lower his speed.

Just when it looked like he was about to lose track of Ling Han, he hurriedly sped up. However, he crashed into the mountain wall, and his whole body bounced back. Thankfully, he had the protection of the Silver Battle Armor on him, or he would definitely be bleeding.

But in this way, it was even more impossible for him to catch up to Ling Han.

“Ling Han!” he roared at the sky. Firstly, he wanted to vent the anger in his heart, and secondly, he wanted to warn the others, so that even if he could not succeed, he could not allow Ling Han to have an easy time.

Tsk, this person’s mentality was really dark.

Ling Han’s figure streaked rapidly, slightly slower than the speed of sound, but he was still astonishingly fast.

On his way, he passed a few more people. Some did not recognize him, and some did, so they naturally began to hunt him down.

Ling Han did not linger in battle, and merely used speed to throw his opponent off his tail. On such a complicated mountain path, there were really not many people that could compete with him in speed.

Half a day later, the mountain path gradually became gentle again.

Ling Han didn’t dare to be careless. He took out the Void Beast hide and put it on.

Now that Hong Tianbu had joined them, this person was extremely cunning, and knew him very well. He would definitely make targeted arrangements for his Imminent Skyline, so he could no longer advance so brazenly. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The terrain ahead was open, allowing Mystery Realm Tiers to display their full speed. As long as there were enough people, they could completely stop him.

After all, Ling Han didn’t dare to use the Imminent Skyline indiscriminately in this place. What would he do if he crashed into the mountain wall? Or perhaps he would directly fall off the mountain?

He quietly ascended the mountain, his speed extremely slow. At this time, safety naturally came first.

He observed, and if he was to lay an ambush, where would he choose to do it?

“There.” He discovered a hidden area, then quietly hid himself there.

When he came close enough, he discovered movement.

…There were three people lying in ambush here, and they were all Mystery Realm Tier elites.

Three?

Ling Han frowned slightly. If there was only one, he would be able to deal with him regardless of whether he used the Heavenly Pattern Jade or the broken piece of the tombstone. However, it would be difficult to deal with three people. Using the broken piece of the tombstone would expose him within a short distance, which was extremely dangerous.

If he used the Heavenly Pattern Jade… he was afraid that someone would pick it up and he wouldn’t be able to retrieve it.

What to do?
