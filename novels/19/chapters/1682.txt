Chapter 1683: Capture all in one go

The Empress had gone on a rampage, while Ling Han was taking charge of the overall situation. His divine sense had spread out, and if any soldier encountered danger, he would strike out with the Lightning Sword Technique. It was indescribably fast, and as long as the opponent was not a Severing Mundane Tier, he would be able to save the person who was in danger.

As time passed, everyone realized this fact. The new soldiers all felt revitalized. This was equivalent to having their safety assured, so they naturally all became brave. On the other hand, the mountain bandits’ morale had declined greatly because they could not kill a single soldier of the Dark Moon Army, or even cause severe wounds, no matter what they did.

“Retreat! Retreat! Retreat!” the mountain bandit who looked to be their leader swiftly called out loudly, and he was the first to turn around and run.

However, under the Empress’s pursuit, who would be able to successfully flee?

Very soon, this group of mountain bandits were all eradicated, leaving behind only three survivors for the purpose of interrogation.

This was a full and complete victory, and there was not a single person who had suffered a serious injury on the side of the Dark Moon Army—merely a few who had sustained light injuries. If it had been an official troop, their military success might even not have been as excellent as theirs.

Thus, everyone felt incredibly invigorated. They naturally knew that the reason that they had been able to win so easily was because of Ling Han and the Empress. After this battle, their confidence had also returned.

...So what if they were those that remained after the best had been chosen? As long as their captain and his wife were there, what team could possibly be a match for them?

The strength of cultivators came through battles, and Ling Han had used this great victory to finally win the respect of all of his subordinates.

Ling Han interrogated each of the three mountain bandits individually. This was not the whole band of mountain bandits.

He had found out that the boss of the mountain bandits was named Jiang Wushang, and was extremely strong. In any case, the several deputies were no match for him at all. Additionally, the number of remaining mountain bandits was around 300 people.

Ling Han immediately decided that the majority of their team would rest here, while he and the Empress would charge into the mountain bandits’ lair, and eliminate all the mountain bandits.

His decision faced the objection of all his teammates. They all thought that this was too dangerous. Aside from an incredibly strong chief among the mountain bandits, there were also eight other deputy chiefs, and all of them were very powerful.

Furthermore, there were more than 30 peak stage Saint King-level mountain bandits, which had far exceeded the 10 that Wu Jing had said. It was too dangerous for just Ling Han and the Empress to barge into this kind of tigers’ den.

“Captain, the strength of this band of mountain bandits is far above what the information that we have gotten predicted. There is no need for us to be forceful. It would be better to bring this information back, and we would definitely be accorded merit and not faulted for it.”

“That’s right, Captain. You have to think it through carefully before you act.”

Everyone advised. By now, they were all sincerely siding with Ling Han. This captain and his wife were too fierce. Who knew, maybe after a few tens of thousands, or a few million years, they would become Severing Mundane Tiers, and their present day friendship would be too valuable by then.

Ling Han smiled, yet shook his head resolutely.

He was definitely going to the mountain bandits’ lair.

Why? It was very simple; how many traveling merchants had this band of mountain bandits robbed? Furthermore, all of them had been robbed completely, and they had accumulated a great volume of wealth in a short few years’ time. If he were to raid them now, then everything would be his. What benefits would merely reporting information bring him?

He and the Empress set out. The three mountain bandits had already confessed the exact location of the mountain bandits’ lair, so Ling Han and the Empress only had to travel according to the set route.

WIth their present strength, they no longer feared any kind of trap or ambush. No matter what tricks the mountain bandits had, they could suppress all of them.

The mountain path was difficult to walk, and if they chose to fly in the skies, the path would be covered by the dense forest, which would make it easy for them to lose their way. Thus, they spent slightly less than half a day’s time to finally arrive at the bandits’ stronghold.

...If they had not had the information that was given by those three mountain bandits, this place would’ve been really difficult to find. It was very covert. It was no wonder that even when large groups of traveling merchants hired a large number of elites to suppress them, it had been useless.

The entrance to this mountain bandits’ lair was especially secretive, and was between two rocks. One had to contract their build first to be able to squeeze in, and after they were through, they would immediately come up to a wide clearing.

A massive valley appeared in front of them, and there was a great tree growing in the middle of the valley. The tree’s huge crown had spread out, covering the whole valley completely. Thus, one would need a large amount of luck to discover the presence of this valley if he did not go through that previous passage.

When they appeared, they immediately drew the attention of all the mountain bandits.

“Yi, we have intruders!”

“I am about to die; how could this woman be so beautiful!”

Because only Ling Han was here, the Empress had removed her face veil, revealing her exquisite beauty, and true enough, this caused all the mountain bandits to stare besottedly at her. They didn’t even know who they were anymore.

Ling Han grinned menacingly. His fingers balled into a fist and then opened up again. Shua, he had shot out over a dozen flashes of Sword Qi. Pu, pu, pu. Immediately, 11 mountain bandits collapsed, their blood pooling onto the ground.

In the Celestial Realm, Genesis Tiers were not considered much at all. Thus, no matter how many of them died, it would not cause the heaven and earth to grieve over their loss—only when Celestial Kings died would it cause grief throughout the world.

This entrance had a total of 12 mountain bandits, and there was still a perverted grin on the face of the only mountain bandit that remained alive, yet he suddenly broke into cold shivers, and screamed in horror. He turned around and escaped, and as he ran, he released shouts of utmost terror, which instantly echoed throughout the entire valley.

Ling Han had deliberately left a survivor so that he could draw out all the mountain bandits.

He had not been merciful. This band of mountain bandits were too ruthless. They left no survivors every time they launched a raid. If any women fell into their hands, then their fate might as well have been death. They would suffer all kinds of torture before they would be killed.

There was no need to have mercy on these animals.

Very soon, mountain bandits came out of their stone and wooden huts one after another, every single one of them wielding weapons, and appearing incredibly fierce.

Those who would become mountain bandits were basically those that had broken the law in the city, or might have been good people before, but were forced into the thieves’ den by evil tyrants. However, after becoming mountain bandits, every single person here had buried their conscience, and did not shrink from committing any crime.

Even if they had originally been good people, they would still lose themselves amidst bloodshed and slaughter, and their psyche would be distorted. They thought that they had suffered injustice, and would seek their revenge on innocents.

“What a beautiful woman!” When they saw the Empress, every single mountain bandit was staring at her. The Empress’s beauty could conquer all, and even in a situation in which she was the enemy, her beauty was capable of making everyone feel carefree and relaxed.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “The wife is mine, so you guys need not think about it. Which of you is Jiang Wushang? Come out and receive your death!”

“Haha, a minor character like you thinks you can alert our boss?” A middle-aged man walked out. He was a deputy chief of the mountain bandits, and could be considered a big shot even among peak stage Saint Kings with his strength.

He had also been tempered through innumerable years. It was easy to advance into the Genesis Tier in the Celestial Realm, and it was also easy to reach the consummate level of the Genesis Tier. Then, they would have a long four billion years to temper their strength.

Though most people were unable to survive the increasingly frightening Immortal’s Tribulation, for those who could live more than two billion years, which of them did not possess incredibly strong abilities?

The intruders were merely two Great Saints, and they actually dared to come here and mess around?

“Haha, brat, have you come to present your wife as a gift?” As this deputy boss spoke, it also caused the other mountain bandits to erupt in loud laughter.

Pu! Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Suddenly, blood spurted from his chest, spraying into the mouths of a few mountain bandits beside him who were still laughing, and covering their faces. These people immediately stopped laughing as they watched this deputy boss of theirs slowly slide onto the ground with an expression of horror, a smile still present on his features.
