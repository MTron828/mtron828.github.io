Chapter 2109: Another World

Fortunately, Xiao Gu returned after two days.

He started to fervently speak after he returned, and it was as if he wanted to repeat everything that he had heard these past few days. This seriously exasperated Ling Han and the others. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

This was because all that he had heard were conversations between middle-aged women at the marketplace. Could you imagine a bone grumbling about the dear prices of vegetables at the market?

Anyhow, Ling Han had already destroyed the statue under the Vicious Bear Gang two days ago. It was like a totem, and it could provide its believers with power. Ling Han didn’t know how it worked.

“Xiao Gu, we were all waiting for you. Let’s go.”

“Xiao Gu, we were all waiting for you. Let’s go.”

Xiao Gu didn’t miss a single word. Mimicking Ling Han was his favorite thing to do.

“But the problem is… Where is the ancient battlefield?”

Lu Hairong had lived for quite long, and according to her knowledge, there were a total of three places that could be regarded as ancient battlefields. The closest one to them was in the Roc Heaven.

“According to legends, an earth-shattering battle took place there seven to eight epochs ago. Countless Celestial Kings were swept up in this battle, and it was truly as brutal as could be. The Roc, the first leader of the Roc Palace and one of the most powerful Immortal Beasts in the world, was also killed in this battle,” Lu Hairong said.

Just what kind of battle had that been? Even a Ninth Heaven Celestial King had been killed? Moreover, the Roc definitely wasn’t an ordinary Ninth Heaven Celestial King. Rather, it was a ruler among Celestial Kings, and it could be referred to as a super elite among Celestial Kings.

Was this related to the storm of darkness?

Ling Han was astonished, and he asked, “Since so many Celestial Kings were killed, that ancient battlefield is definitely a land of treasures. Why don’t people go there to search for treasures?”

To say nothing else, there was definitely a mountain of Celestial Tools, right?

Lu Hairong shook her head in response. She was extremely respectful toward Ling Han, and she replied, “This is because… no one knows where this ancient battlefield is! The chaotic battle between Celestial Kings warped space and time, and all of the future Celestial Kings suspect that this ancient battlefield has been pushed into a void that’s impossible to access.”

Ling Han, the Empress, and the others slowly nodded in understanding. Even a single Celestial King already possessed the power to crush heaven and earth, much less a battle of countless Celestial Kings. Moreover, there were even near-invincible Celestial Kings like the Roc.

“Then how can we find this ancient battlefield?” Ling Han asked with a frown.

Lu Hairong could only shake her head in response. In reality, the Roc Palace was also keen to find this ancient battlefield so they could search for the Roc and perfect some of their inheritances and retrieve some of their rare treasures.

Just how astonishing and valuable were the treasures of Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings? They could definitely resolve the difficulty that the Roc Palace was currently facing.

“I can find it,” Small Tower suddenly said.

Ling Han was astonished, and he asked, “How do you know its location?”

“Because… I was also on the battlefield at that time!” Small Tower said slowly.

Ling Han’s head instantly went numb. Small Tower had actually participated in the battle that had killed the Roc? He hurriedly asked, “How was this battle triggered? Who was fighting against whom? What happened in the end?”

“Where are all your questions coming from?” Small Tower said in annoyance.

“Can’t I be curious?” Ling Han asked with a smile. He was already accustomed to the proud Small Tower becoming angry.

Small Tower hesitated for a moment before saying, “Alright, since your cultivation has improved, and since you already know some things, it won’t hurt to reveal some secrets to you.”

“Really?” Ling Han asked in slight astonishment. He had thought that Small Tower would remain silent after ridiculing him.

“You’re already aware that there’s another force currently advocating a different cultivation system, and trying to overthrow this heaven and earth,” Small Tower said. It didn’t speak any nonsense, and it directly cut to the chase.

“Mm-hm,” Ling Han answered with a nod.

“In fact, the infiltration of this force already started a very long time ago,” Small Tower said in a calm voice. “They don’t belong to this world, and they’ve in fact come from another world. However, if you ask me where it is, my answer to you is this—I don’t know, either.

“In the beginning, there was only a single passageway between the two worlds. However, elites couldn’t cross this passageway, because it was far too unstable. Moreover, there was also the resistive power of the realm, meaning that elites couldn’t stay. Meanwhile, weaker cultivators couldn’t withstand the crushing power of the passageway at all. They would be killed in an instant.

“Oh, that’s right. By elites, I mean Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings.”

Ling Han had been listening quietly, yet upon hearing this, his jaw instantly dropped down. This standard for elites was far too high, no? Even casting one’s gaze across the entire Celestial Realm, few people could satisfy this criterion.

“In the beginning, none of the powerful beings of the Celestial Realm worried about this. However, this passageway slowly expanded, and it gradually became stable. Finally, on some day, even Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings and Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings could cross.

“However, before the Celestial Kings of our realm could figure out what was happening… countless elites had already charged over from the other side.

“At the start, our realm was taken by complete surprise, and countless beings were killed as a result. In fact, millions of Celestial Kings were killed.

“Only after several Heavenly Venerates interfered did the situation finally settle down.

“The most brutal of these battles occurred in none other than the Roc Heaven. Including the Roc, a total of 17 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings were killed. This greatly affected the vitality of the Celestial Realm. Even after eight epochs, this vitality still hasn’t recovered to the level that it once was at.

“However, this wasn’t the end. The elites from that realm continued to attack the passageway, and they yearned to beat the drums of war to invade our world again.

“They also had elites at the Heavenly Venerable Tier, and they continued to stabilize the passageway to allow even Heavenly Venerates to pass, not just the projections of Heavenly Venerates.

“From that point onwards, the battle between the two realms has never ceased.

“We call this… the storm of darkness.

“During this time, the force of darkness has come up with many methods in an attempt to overthrow our realm. They’ve infiltrated us with their own cultivation system, and this is one of the many methods. They want to destroy our world from its roots.

“Moreover, the deity that they believe in… is a Heavenly Venerate from the force of darkness!”

Ling Han was rendered completely speechless. As it turned out, this deity was genuinely a freakish being. Heavenly Venerates—these were beings who were transcendent above the Regulations of heaven and earth.

“Huh? Why aren’t you speaking?” Ling Han asked. He suddenly realized that Small Tower had stopped speaking.

Small Tower’s voice was extremely calm as it replied, “I’ve already told you everything that I need to tell you. As for the things that I can’t tell you, I won’t tell you even if you ask.”

‘Fine!’

However, Ling Han was already extremely satisfied. At the very least, he now knew who the enemy was.

The force of darkness, assailants from another world who were attempting to destroy the entire Celestial Realm.

“Why… are they doing this?” Ling Han asked. “Do they want to enslave us?”

“No,” Small Tower answered. Its voice was solemn and filled with seriousness as it continued, “This is a battle between two realms. If we lose, the other realm will engulf us. As for the beings of this realm… They’ll all disintegrate and turn into ashes. Even the traces of their memories will be extinguished, and it’ll be as if this realm never existed.”

Ling Han’s hair stood on ends. This wasn’t a matter of one or two people dying. Rather, this was a matter of their entire realm being wiped out of existence!

This couldn’t happen! This definitely couldn’t happen!

“Let’s go! We can’t let them obtain the Source Power of heaven and earth no matter what!”
