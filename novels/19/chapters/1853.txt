Chapter 1854: It really was not me drawing trouble

“Five times acceleration rate cultivation chamber?” The ticket vendor shook his head. “There’s none left. The last one has just been rented out.” As he said that, he cast a look at Ling Han.

Ling Han suddenly had a thought. Could it be that a melodramatic event was going to happen again?

That young man turned to look at Ling Han, and his expression was all smiles as he asked, “This brother, could you sublet this cultivation chamber to me? I can offer you 10% more Star Stones.”

Ling Han smiled. At first, he had thought that this guy would throw around his wealth, and use 10 times the Star Stones to crush him, yet the result was actually just an additional 10%.

However, precisely because of this, he could tell that this character was no profligate. Otherwise, this guy would definitely be the pettiest profligate in the world.

Ling Han shook his head, and said, “I do not wish to sublet it.”

That young man was very anxious, and determinedly kept on bargaining with him, hoping that Ling Han could agree, yet was tactfully refused. He did not threaten Ling Han and said what would happen to him if he did not oblige or something along those lines, though.

Ling Han was actually slightly proud. This time, no conflict had happened. This seemed to be the first time in history, right?

Not bad, this was a matter worth drinking to.

Seeing his expression, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden involuntarily covered her mouth and laughed. She naturally understood what Ling Han was thinking, but this husband of hers would actually be proud because of such a matter, which was proof enough of how astonishing his halo of trouble was.

“Zhu Jin, are you done?” A voice filled with loftiness rang out, and a young man walked over. He was clearly walking towards the other young man, but as he walked, his eyes passed over the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden, and he could no longer turn his gaze away.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden showed a hint of displeasure, and leaned her body slightly towards Ling Han, using Ling Han’s body to block the other’s gaze.

The first young man’s name was Zhu Jin. He showed a hint of awkwardness, and turning towards the other young man, said, “Young Master Yu, I’m really sorry. The last five times acceleration chamber has just been rented out.”

The young man that was called Young Master Yu cast a gaze full of suspicion at Zhu Jin, and asked, “Hey, you aren’t just trying to save money, and deliberately lying to me, are you?”

“How could I dare to!” Zhu Jin rubbed his forehead, but there was no sweat. “If Young Master Yu does not believe me, you can ask the staff here.”

The ticket vendor was cooperative. Though he did not recognize this Young Master Yu, he still said, “That’s right, Young Master Yu. The last five times acceleration rate cultivation chamber has been rented to this customer. Why don’t you rent a four times acceleration rate cultivation chamber instead? The actual effects are not much different.”

“Rubbish!” Young Master Yu immediately rebuked, the spit from his mouth almost splashing onto Zhu Jin’s face. “I, Liu Yu, will either not use any at all, or I will use the best! Otherwise, how would I be able to face others when I returned to Blue Eternity City?”

After blustering around for a while, his eyes focused on Ling Han. “You, hand over your cultivation chamber to me, and however much money you want, you can go and find that guy.” He pointed at Zhu Jin, a hint of pride in his expression.

This was shown deliberately for the benefit of Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. ‘How about it? I am awesome, right? I have a lackey that I can order around as I like, and he will give me money as long as I ask for it.’

Ling Han sighed. He had really thought that he could have a normal experience this time, and would not attract trouble, but reality proved that it was easy to dodge an open attack, but hard to guard against despicable people. He had again encountered a despicable character.

Zhu Jin got a scare. Though he was slightly well off, he definitely could not hold up to such an exorbitant demand. He hurriedly laughed, and said, “Please don’t joke around, Young Master Yu! My friend, do me a favor, all right, and I’ll give you 30% more of Star Stones!”

“Zhu Jin, how could you be so petty? Don’t make this beauty laugh at you, and don’t make me lose face!” Liu Yu humphed, appearing to be very displeased.

To bargain like this in front of a beauty; couldn’t you be a little more generous?

Zhu Jin grimaced. He was only the young master of a small clan, and he was deliberately escorting Liu Yu around this time to curry favor with him. That was because the Zhu Clan wanted to get some business from the Liu Clan.

But Liu Yu was putting on airs here in front of a beauty, and was just moving his mouth, while what Zhu Jin was paying was actual money. With how small the Zhu Clan was, how could they hold up to such exorbitant expense?

“Young Master Yu, the four times acceleration rate cultivation chambers really are not much different, and I can rent for a longer time too,” he said courteously to Liu Yu.

“Humph, then what about my pride?” Liu Yu’s expression was filled with arrogance. He was practically raising his head so high his nostrils were facing Zhu Jin. “Don’t forget, it is not just your Zhu Clan, there is still the Jin Clan, Ma Clan, and Cheng Clan, and they are all cordially entertaining me. If you can’t bear to part with a bit of money, there will be others who can!”

Zhu Jin could only grimace once more, and turned to Ling Han, and said, “Friend, I am really sorry, but could we negotiate a bit? I am willing to compensate you with double the amount.”

This time, he had really spent a lot of money. He could only pray that Ling Han had not rented for too long a period of time.

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden could not bear to see Liu Yu’s arrogance, and also sympathized with how Zhu Jin was acting so humble. Turning to Ling Han, she said, “Why don’t we just sublet it to him then.”

In any case, Ling Han had already applied for qualification to enter into the second level. He had come here only for the experience, so subletting and using a four times acceleration rate chamber instead would not have too much effect.

At first, there was definitely no way that Ling Han would give way for someone like Liu Yu, but with a soft plea from his wife like this—and Zhu Jin had been polite all this while too—his heart softened, and thus he said, “Fine then, I’ll let you have it.”

“Many thanks! Many thanks!” Zhu Jin hurriedly bowed extremely low, offering his grateful thanks.

Liu Yu saw this, and scoffed, saying, “So after bargaining for so long, you are just a greedy man. Pei, who do you think you are, to put on a pretense of reservedness in front of me! Brat, come here and kneel in thanks for allowing you to make a good profit!”

Ling Han had stretched out his hand halfway to hand over the seal, but when he heard this, he became furious, and suddenly withdrew his hand.

This time, it was definitely not his halo of trouble, but rather this kind of trash was indeed asking to be beaten.

‘So how cheap could you get?

‘I have already let you have the cultivation chamber, so you just proudly go since you already have the upper hand. But you insist on being cheap and asking for a beating, heh!’

Ling Han set his eyes on Liu Yu, and said, “Swallow the words that you have said!”

Yet Liu Yu was determined to cause trouble, though it was not because he disliked Ling Han, but rather for the sake of the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden.

Though the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden had not advanced into the Severing Mundane Tier, which decreased her charms, she was an exquisite beauty, after all. There were at most only 100 that could match her beauty in the whole Alchemy City.

This seemed to be a large number, but just how many people were there in a Four-Star City, and how many elites were there?

Liu Yu could only look up at any single one of them, swallow his saliva, and then let his imagination roam in his head.

But now? An exquisite beauty had actually appeared at the first level; what did this mean? He was completely qualified to pluck this beautiful bloom for himself!

Ling Han? Who did he think he was? Just a country bumpkin, and he thought he could contest with him over a woman.

Seeing Ling Han choose to confront him directly, Liu Yu was not angered, but rather pleased. With a comparison like this, only then would his superiority be presented clearly.

“Oh, you want me to apologize?” Liu Yu was very arrogant, slanting a sideways glance at Ling Han. “Just who do you think you are? What qualifies you for that?”DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
