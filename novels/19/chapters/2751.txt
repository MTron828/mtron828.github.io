2752 Attacked on All Sides

Ling Feifan was just about to reveal Ling Han’s identity, yet he suddenly felt a tremendous force rush over, causing his chest to ache. This forced him to swallow his words.

“Brother Lei, Brother Chen, Brother Zhao!” Ling Jianxue said with a serious expression. Three Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings had come in unison.

“I want to first congratulate Brother Ling on your son’s safe return,” Lei Bing said. “However, over 3000 others were captured with him, so why was he able to safely return by himself? This naturally requires an explanation.”

Ling Jianxue was boiling with anger, and he said, “Our family of three has been fighting here for several million years, and the contributions that we’ve made have been clear for everyone to see. Have we not even earned the most basic trust?”

“Heh, the human heart is a volatile beast. Who knows?” Chen Wangyun said apathetically. He didn’t give Ling Jianxue any help.

“So, please cooperate with us, Brother Ling. If we find no issues after questioning your son carefully, we’ll be willing to apologize to Brother Ling and your missus,” Zhao Beiyue said with a smile.

This was asking for Ling Jianxue and his wife to surrender without putting up a fight.

Ling Jianxue was even more enraged. Because of this one thing, the three of them were all going to be treated as criminals?

Once they were captured, their life and death would fall into the hands of others. As a cultivator, how could he allow this to happen?

“Since you’re all suspicious of us, this place is no longer suitable for us to remain,” Ling Jianxue said with a sigh. “Shuangshuang, let’s go.”

Whoosh!

Chen Shuangshuang immediately returned to Ling Jianxue’s side.

“You want to leave?” Shen Bo said in a baleful voice. “Perhaps you’re feeling guilty?”

“Shen Bo! Have some conscience when you speak!” Ling Jianxue said in a deep and solemn voice. He was truly angered at this moment.

“Facing traitors, what respect do we need to show?” Lei Bing said.

“Let’s leave!” Ling Jianxue said.

“Can you leave?” Zhao Beiyue said, stepping forward and unleashing an attack at Ling Jianxue and his wife. As for Ling Feifan and Ling Han, they were naturally ignored. After all, one was only a First Heaven Celestial King, and the other more so looked like a beggar. He didn’t look like an elite no matter how they looked at him.

Ling Jianxue faced the attack head-on.

Peng, peng, peng!

The two of them immediately launched into battle.

Ling Han purposefully didn’t interfere, as he wanted to observe his son’s current strength.

He immediately nodded in satisfaction. Ling Jianxue hadn’t wasted his time roaming so many dimensions. He had continually recultivated using each dimension’s unique Regulations, and this had allowed him to form an extremely stable foundation. He was only a step away from advancing to the Heavenly Venerable Tier.

Initially, Ling Jianxue’s talent wasn’t enough for him to advance to the Heavenly Venerable Tier. However, nothing in this world was a certainty, so through his perseverance and effort, he had ultimately transformed the impossible into possible.

As expected of his son.

Zhao Beiyue was no match for Ling Jianxue, and he immediately fell into a disadvantage after just a few exchanges. Upon seeing this, Lei Bing and Shen Bo both stepped forward to join the battle.

With a soft shout, Chen Shuangshuang also joined the battle, assisting her husband.

Chen Wangyun was unwilling to be left out, so he also joined in, turning the battle into a four-on-two.

This dimension naturally had more Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings than just Lei Bing and the others. Thus, as the battle dragged on, more and more Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings appeared. However, none of them joined the battle. Most of them had a strong sense of pride and dignity, rendering them unwilling to join forces with others.

Ling Han had intentions of training his son, so he also remained a spectator. Unless they faced perilous danger, he wouldn’t step forward to help them.

Ling Jianxue was truly an extraordinary cultivator. Even though he wasn’t as freakish as Ling Han, and even though he didn’t possess a Body Art, his foundations were truly far too stable. Thus, he was able to take on the four elites all by himself. Meanwhile, Chen Shuangshuang acted like an assassin as she danced around them. The cooperation between husband and wife was extremely strong.

They were two against four, yet not only were they not at a disadvantage, but they were even showing signs of winning.

However, three more Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings immediately stepped forward to oppose them, joining the ranks attacking Ling Jianxue and his wife.

At this moment, Ling Jianxue and his wife immediately showed signs of cracking, falling to a disadvantage.

“Brother Ling, why struggle in futility? As long as you obediently come with us, we won’t hurt the three of you. After all, we’ve seen your contributions with our own eyes,” Lei Bing said.

Ling Jianxue naturally wouldn’t believe his words. Was he trying to trick a three-year-old child?

He finally understood the concept of “outsiders necessarily have their ulterior motives.” However, it wasn’t him with ulterior motives, but rather that these people had never trusted him to begin with. To think that he had fought for them with such loyalty and vigor.

“Break free,” he said to Chen Shuangshuang through his divine sense. If they attracted the attention of a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate or a First Tier or Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, they would no longer have the opportunity to escape. Anyhow, they had a rare treasure on them that could help conceal their aura, so as long as they managed to lose their pursuers, even Heavenly Venerates wouldn’t be able to find them.

Chen Shuangshuang nodded in agreement, and the two of them suddenly unleashed their trump cards, immediately breaking free from their opponents.

It was incredibly difficult for Celestial Kings to kill fellow Celestial Kings, especially those at the same cultivation.

Right at this moment, they heard a cold humph that slammed down at them like a heavy hammer. Ling Jianxue and Chen Shuangshuang shuddered violently as they immediately crashed down from the sky.

This was the action of a Heavenly Venerate! Not a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate!

Black clouds gathered overhead, with a gigantic face appearing in its center. Like the thunder god, this person’s mouth stuck out, and their chin was like an ape’s.

“Our respects to Lord Vanishing Thunder!” everyone cried as they fell to their knees.

The Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate, a First Tier Heavenly Venerate.

However, four people remained standing—Ling Han and Ling Jianxue’s family of three.

“Impudence! You dare to remain standing before me!” the Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate said in displeasure. He was a newbie Heavenly Venerate, so he cared deeply about the rules and regulations of the cultivation world. This was especially the case when he saw those Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings—who were previously at the same cultivation as him—lowering their heads. This gave him a euphoric feeling.

Ling Jianxue remained silent, his expression cold. There was one thing about him that was very similar to Ling Han—he was also an extremely proud person. It was just that this pride was usually concealed under his warmth and friendliness.

“So what if I remain standing? Don’t regard yourself too highly! After all, didn’t you start off as a mere mortal as well?” Ling Feifan suddenly said.

Everyone was stunned upon hearing this.

A measly Celestial King actually dared to chide a Heavenly Venerate…? Was he seeking death?

The Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate had already been extremely displeased to begin with, so upon seeing Ling Feifan dare to retort him, he instantly exploded with killing intent. He was indeed a prodigy, but there was no rule saying that prodigies needed to be generous and open-minded.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He immediately lashed out.

Boom!

A large hand slammed down from the clouds, surrounded by a sea of blue lightning as it rushed toward Ling Feifan.

Heavenly Venerates didn’t need to have any reservations. If they saw something they didn’t like, they could immediately lash out to crush it.

Boom!

The large hand landed, with even heaven and earth shuddering under its might.

Ling Jianxue and Chen Shuangshuang both despaired. They were being suppressed by the might of the Heavenly Venerate, so how could they possibly rush over to help their child?

However, Ling Feifan remained fearless, and he remained glaring at the sky, refusing to bow his head.

He was naturally filled with confidence. Ling Han had defeated even Second Tier Heavenly Venerates, so what harm could a First Tier Heavenly Venerate cause?

Peng!

The large hand landed, yet it was blocked by another hand, rendering it unable to slam into the ground.

Everyone’s gaze was instantly drawn to Ling Han.

“This is… a Heavenly Venerate from the Martial Crystalline Realm!” they immediately exclaimed.

This dimension definitely didn’t have such a Heavenly Venerate. Moreover, he had arrived together with Ling Feifan from the Martial Crystalline Realm, so what else could he be but a Heavenly Venerate from that realm?

The Vanishing Thunder Heavenly Venerate faltered upon seeing this. However, he immediately sneered, and said, “Even if you’re a Second Tier Heavenly Venerate, you’ll still be nothing more than a First Tier Heavenly Venerate after arriving in this dimension. Taking into account the suppression from heaven and earth, you aren’t necessarily powerful enough to rival me.”

Second Tier Heavenly Venerates had definitely comprehended the unique power of a dimension and one of the fundamental powers of the Genesis World. However, after traveling to another dimension, they would no longer be able to wield the former power, the one cultivated during the First Tier.

Thus, after traveling to another dimension, Second Tier Heavenly Venerates could only be regarded as First Tier Heavenly Venerates.
