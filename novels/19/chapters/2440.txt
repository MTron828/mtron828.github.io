Chapter 2441: Son of Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable

Ji Wuming glanced at Ling Han before shaking his head, and replying, “What if I told you that the Severing Mundane Tier, Dividing Soul Tier, Celestial Path, and whatnot all didn’t exist before? These notions only appeared after the transformation of heaven and earth. How would you react?”

Ling Han’s mouth was slightly agape, and he said in astonishment, “I’ll probably react like this.”

Ji Wuming nodded, and said, “A long, long time ago, the Celestial Path didn’t exist.”

In other words, in Ji Wuming’s previous life—that was when he was the Nine Lights Ancient Buddha—there was no need to traverse the Celestial Path to become a Celestial King. Instead, they used another method to form their Celestial Seed.

Ling Han pondered over this. A while ago, he had discovered a damaged Celestial Tool on the Celestial Path. It had been left by the Karmic Life Heavenly Venerable’s mother. Combining this discovery with Ji Wuming’s words, it could be proved that the Celestial Path had once been a part of the Celestial Realm.

After the transformation of heaven and earth, this region had broken off from the Celestial Realm and transformed into a mystery realm. Afterward, Ascending Origin Tier elites who wanted to become Celestial Kings all needed to enter this mystery realm to form a Celestial Seed.

Ling Han mulled over this for a moment before saying, “It seems like heaven and earth is also playing a game of chess.”

In reality, heaven and earth were the most powerful. Regardless of how one cultivated, they couldn’t surpass the power of heaven and earth. Take, for example, the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable and the others. Their footsteps could only halt here. If they wanted to advance further, they would need the Celestial Realm to collapse.

In this realm, everyone was subject to the suppression of heaven and earth.

Right now, there was an intense battle between the Celestial Realm and the Foreign Realm. The heaven and earth of the Celestial Realm was naturally unwilling to collapse, yet it couldn’t directly interfere with the battle. Thus, it made some other arrangements such as accelerating the appearance of some rare opportunities. By doing so, it could nurture an increasing number of prodigies who could resist the invasion of the Foreign Realm.

However, there was also another possibility. Perhaps heaven and earth had already arranged things a long time ago. In fact, it might have arranged things several epochs ago, when the Celestial Path had first appeared!

“Heaven and earth… What in the world does it want to do?”

“Ling Han!” There was a loud roar as a handsome man strode over. His gait was like that of a dragon and a tiger, and he was like a paramount ruler as he walked over. A golden glow rose from his body, and it was as if people could only bow down before him.

Even though Ling Han had yet to fully recover, he wasn’t afraid of this person at all. He hadn’t exhausted his power of Regulations, so his battle prowess was still as fearsome as could be.

He remained silent as he looked toward the man.

“I’m Dongfang Rui!” the young man announced. His words surprisingly transformed into all kinds of Immortal Beast symbols, and this was truly an astonishing sight to behold.

“Oh, okay,” Ling Han replied with a nod. He then turned to Ji Wuming, and continued, “Brother Ji, what do you say?” He completely ignored Dongfang Rui.

“Ling Han!” Dongfang Rui roared in anger.

Boom!

The golden glow around him trembled, and he was much like a Sun God that was about to erupt.

Jia Lan stepped forward, and said, “Brother Dongfang, please calm down.” Her figure was shapely, and her appearance was also exquisite. She was extremely attractive.

“This island is filled with unknown dangers, so this is a time for cooperation and understanding,” Shi Chanzi also said.

Dongfang Rui was obstructed, and he didn’t use force on Jia Lan. Instead, he looked at Ling Han with a cold expression, and said, “I’ve heard many people speak about your arrogance lately. Sure enough, they were speaking the truth!”

Ling Han raised his brow, and said, “You’re dissatisfied?” Since this person was filled with hostility, was there any need for him to be respectful?

“Ha! Ha!” Dongfang Rui roared with contemptuous laughter. “When I was challenging the world, your ancestors were probably still languishing in a hole!”

Ling Han instantly came to a realization. “Oh, are you another descendent of some Ninth Heaven Celestial King? Did they seal you for several epochs, but forget to seal your toxic mouth for a while longer?”

‘This…!’

Dongfang Rui almost exploded in rage. How was this person so toxic?

His black hair stood on ends, and the golden glow around him transformed into a divine broadsword that pointed at Ling Han. It was ready to strike at any moment.

He was a monarch star, and he had more so become a Pseudo-Celestial King now. His Vitality Index was roughly around 4800, so his might would naturally be astonishing.

However, he suddenly suppressed his anger, and said in a solemn voice, “My father… is the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable!”

Ling Han was astonished. “The Sealed D*ck Heavenly Venerable actually has a son?” He looked Dongfang Rui up and down, and said, “Are you sure you’re not your neighbor’s son?”

Dongfang Rui was unable to hold back any longer. With a bellow, he charged at Ling Han with no regard for anything else. The golden glow around him pulsated, and it was as if it were breathing out golden sword after golden sword. This was an astounding scene.

This was as expected of a monarch star who had ruled during his time. He was unbelievably powerful.

However, Ling Han was unafraid. He had already surpassed the level of monarch star, and his Evolution Index had more so risen to 11. Even monarch stars could only gaze up at him. Without using his Body Art, and only relying on his power of Regulations, he could already reach a Vitality Index of 4900. This would provide him with a crushing advantage.

He pressed forward with his palm, instantly trapping Dongfang Rui. All of Dongfang Rui’s struggles were futile. There was a Vitality Index gap of 100 between them, and this was like the gulf between the emperor tier and the monarch tier.

Ling Han stepped forward, and he just was about to swing his palm at Dongfang Rui’s face.

“Humph!” Dongfang Rui’s eyes instantly narrowed in anger.

Whoosh!

A golden sword leaped out from between his brows, instantly unleashing a formidable might.

Celestial Tool!

The golden sword instantly shattered Ling Han’s spatial restriction, allowing Dongfang Rui to break free. With a furious roar, he slashed the sword down at Ling Han.

He was the son of a Heavenly Venerate, so possessing a Celestial Tool was as obvious as could be.

However, after stealing a few glances at the sword, Ling Han was astonished by what he discovered. This wasn’t a Celestial Tool.

This golden sword had indeed been forged from Divine Metal. However, its might was only equivalent to that of the Divine Demon Sword. It was only at the Ascending Origin Tier.

It was clear that Dongfang Rui was filled with ambition. He didn’t want to be protected by his father, and he wanted to forge a Celestial Tool for himself. Only so could he unleash the full might of the Celestial Tool.

Ling Han laughed loudly as he unsheathed his Divine Demon Sword.

Boom!

The two of them exchanged a strike. Like before, Dongfang Rui was blasted back again.

He was deeply astonished. He hadn’t imagined that Ling Han also possessed a Celestial Tool. Moreover, this Celestial Tool was the same as his. Ling Han was also trying to forge his own Celestial Tool!

Dongfang Rui’s disadvantage was too great, so it was futile regardless of how prodigious he was. He couldn’t turn the tables, and he could only defend with all his might. This was a completely one-sided battle.

Jia Lan, Shi Chanzi, and the other young man were all stunned. They knew that Ling Han was powerful, but they definitely hadn’t imagined that he was this powerful. He could crush those at the same cultivation level.

One had to realize that they were all monarch stars. In other words, there was no extra room to advance. Right now, however, Ling Han was clearly more powerful than them. How was this possible?

Only Ji Wuming’s eyes lit up. He was filled with fighting spirit.

“Piss off!” He immediately charged forward.

Peng!

He kicked Dongfang Rui aside, and a Divine Sword shot out from above his head. It was also forged from ordinary Divine Metal. It wasn’t a Celestial Tool.

Ling Han had seen his other Divine Sword before, the one that had been forged into a Celestial Tool. This, however, was a Divine Tool!

It was clear that those with great ambitions all refused to use the precious tools of others. Instead, they were intent on nurturing their own. Only so could they create something that suited them best.

This was the case even if it were a precious tool forged in their previous life. They would throw it away on a whim. Since they had decided to reincarnate and recultivate, they would need to cleanly sever everything from their previous life.

Sure enough, Ji Wuming was a person of great wisdom and great resolve.

Ling Han’s eyes also lit up. Dongfang Rui had actually been kicked aside by Ji Wuming. Even though there had been an element of surprise, this was still a clear reflection that Ji Wuming was more powerful than Dongfang Rui.

The opponent whom he held in the highest regard was none other than Ji Wuming. Seeing him become stronger, Ling Han couldn’t help but feel delighted.

“Come battle!” he said with loud laughter.

With a loud roar, Ji Wuming charged over with his sword. A boundless murderous aura soared into the air. In this life, he was much like a demon, completely abandoning the Buddhism that he had personally founded in his previous life.

He was a master of death, of punishment, and of attacking!
