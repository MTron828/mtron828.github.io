Chapter 3625: Love triangle

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Was this Zhao Fangyue, Miss Zhao?

Ung Han shouted, and as he gathered everyone over, he asked, “Miss Zhao?”

The woman turned around, revealing an exquisite face. However, it was a little too pale, without a trace of blood.

Ling Han smiled, and said, “I am Shen Hanyun’s friend. He has already obtained the Thousand Year Tree Heart. Your illness can be cured, and there is no need for you to have any lingering thoughts of death.”

Unexpectedly, this Miss Zhao actually did not have the slightest bit of joy. She merely cast a cold look at Ling Han, and then turned her face away, staring dumbly ahead of her.

Yi, could it be that it was the brain that had been injured?

Ling Han stroked his chin, appearing slightly surprised. There was something off with this reaction. Shouldn’t she be extremely happy now that she knew that her illness could be cured?

Was there something that he didn’t know?

Ling Han didn’t say anything either. In any case, the signal had already been sent, so he could just wait for Shen Hanyun to come.

In a short while, a figure flew over.

Ling Han was filled with envy. Foundation Building Tier cultivators could soar through the air, and this unrestrained and free feeling made his heart itch endlessly.

Fortunately, he wasn’t far from reaching the Foundation Building Tier. “Fangyue!” Shen Hanyun descended, and an expression of relief appeared on his face. He quickly walked over, and said softly, “The mountain winds here are strong, and you are not in good health. It would be best for you to return quickly.”

“Shen Hanyun, how many times have I told you? Don’t interfere with my matters!” Zhao Fangyue said coldly.

This was definitely not the tone that a lover would speak with.

Ling Han was astonished, yet he didn’t say anything. He had only come to collect the Wood Element Crystal, so he didn’t need to be concerned about other matters.

After a while, the little loli and the six babies also ran over.

“What’s going on?” Tang Yun’er’s expression was filled with curiosity. Her gossipy nature was clearly already burning fiercely.

Just how young was she? You already have the potential to become a chatterbox?

“See for yourself,” Ling Han said in a low voice.

On the other side, Shen Hanyun was coaxing Zhao Fangyue, but Zhao Fangyue wouldn’t listen no matter what. Instead, her attitude became worse and worse, almost chasing him away with a sword.

“AU right, I’ll leave. Don’t get agitated.” Shen Hanyun compromised. He took out the thousand-year Tree Heart, which was stored in a jade box, “This is a thousand-year Tree Heart, which can treat your chronic illness. I’ll leave it here.”

With that said, he signalled Ling Han and the others with his eyes, and left quietly.

Ling Han, Tang Yun’er, and the others were all a little stunned, but did not ask Instead, they followed him out of the valley. When they had exited the valley, Shen Hanyun took the initiative to explain.

It was a fact that he liked Zhao Fangyue, but that Miss Zhao did not like him.

A few years ago, before Shen Hanyue had even advanced into the Foundation Building Tier, he had travelled the world with his sword, and coincidentally encountered Zhao Fangyue and another man, Ma Teng. They felt like old friends at first sight, and very soon, they became good friends.

A melodramatic plot developed.. He and Ma Teng had both fallen in love with Zhao Fangyue, and Zhao Fangyue was in love with Ma Teng. However, this did not ruin the friendship between the three of them, and they continued to adventure and ajourney together.

Not too long after, a disease erupted in Zhao Fangyue’s body, and Shen Hanyun and Ma Teng went all over the world to find Spiritual Herbs for her.

They had heard that there might be a thousand-year-old treasured ginseng in the Sunken Sand Valley, so they had come to try their luck. In the end, their luck was ridiculously bad. Not only had they not obtained the thousand-year-old treasured ginseng, but Ma Teng had instead sunk into the quicksand, and his life force had been swallowed.

After this matter, Zhao Fangyue settled down in the vicinity of the Sunken Sand Valley, commemorating her beloved. Meanwhile, Shen Hanyun was still searching for treasured medicines everywhere, which led to the matter of entering the Ironwood Forest twice.

“So you have a one-sided love,” Tang Yun’er said frankly.

This damn child, did she even know how to speak properly? Weren’t you just rubbing salt into his wounds?

Ling Han hurriedly pulled the little loli over, laughed loudly, and asked,

“Brother Shen, what do you plan to do next?”

Shen Hanyun was a little dazed. Previously, he only had one goal in his life, and that was to find the Spiritual Herb and save Zhao Fangyue. Now that this goal was accomplished, there was only emptiness left in his heart.

She didn’t love him, so there was no way that she would be with him.

He was speechless. After a while, his eyes gradually became firm.

“I want to continue to travel the world, and become an outstanding swordsman,” he said.

This had always been his dream. It was only because of Zhao Fangyue’s sudden illness that he had been running around all these years. Now, he had finally let go of his romantic feelings, and regained his lofty aspirations.

Ling Han smiled faintly. He could clearly see that Shen Hanyun had not truly let go of Zhao Fangyue. It was only now that he needed another goal for himself to persevere. Otherwise, it was possible that he would become a walking corpse. “Brother Ling, how many Five Elements Crystals are you still missing?” Shen Hanyun suddenly asked.

Ling Han was a little surprised. ‘Why are you so concerned about this?’

However, he still answered, “Metal and Earth.”

Alright, I’ll help you gather these two types of essences first,” Shen Hanyun nodded.

“This makes me a little awkward,” Ling Han said with a smile. He naturally hoped that a powerful helper could shorten the time for him to obtain the Five Elements Crystals, but Shen Hanyun didn’t owe him anything now.

Shen Hanyun smiled, but his smile was completely devoid of humor, “I have nothing else to do now. Furthermore, I also need to change my mood.” He had not walked out of this unrequited romance, so he needed to do something else to divert his longing.

“All right.” Ling Han nodded.

Because Sixth Baby was still in Ironwood Forest, Ling Han found an excuse to split up with Shen Hanyun. They would meet back at the Golden Desert.

The Golden Desert was the land of Metal among the lands of Five Elements.

Ling Han and his group first arrived at the Ironwood Forest, and brought Sixth

Baby with them. Then, they flew towards the Golden Desert.

Fortunately, the little loli didn’t smash anyone this time. The two times previously had given Ling Han a psychological trauma.

Golden Desert did not mean that there was gold everywhere in the desert, but rather that the colour of this sand was the same as gold. At a glance, it seemed to be paved with golden sand, so bright that it could blind one’s eyes.

This desert was very large, and incredibly hot. There were very few plants that could grow and have live here. Thus, those who would come here were basically here for the essence of Metal. After collecting enough, they would be able to fuse it into a Metal Element Crystal.

Father, will you make us work for nothing again this time?” the babies all asked.

They had already wasted time twice in a row.

Ling Han didn’t know either. He stroked his chin, and said, “Probably not.”

His luck was not that good either, that he would always be able to get a fortuitous encounter.

“Alright, then we will trust Father again.” The babies nodded one after another.

They moved separately, and agreed to meet back here once every five days.

Ling Han still brought the problematic little loli with him as he walked into the desert. They had only taken a few steps, when they felt their mouths go dry. Not long after, a fire scorpion crawled out from a crack between the rocks and launched a sneak attack at Ling Han and Tang Yun’er. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The ending was naturally very tragic. It had been stomped to death by Ling Han.

Yet Ling Han gritted his teeth. This scorpion’s shell was so hard, that even his foot was slightly numb.
