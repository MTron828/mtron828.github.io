Chapter 2270: Slaughtering Celestial Kings

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han’s hand descended, and the Heavy Metal Celestial King quickly

stepped back.

Though he had spoken very uncaringly, it was unknown just how wary he was

of Ling Han. This was the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, and he definitely

could not oppose this power.

Ling Han charged forwards. At present, he was the strongest being on the

scene. Anyone’s life could be decided on his mere whim. However, he could also

understand the reasoning behind the majority wanting to put their own safety

first, and was not incited into wanting to unleash a great massacre. However,

he would definitely kill those few that had been the most vocal.

Using his celestial techniques, he bore down on the opponent.

A Ninth Heaven Celestial King stepped in, helping the Heavy Metal Celestial

King to resolve his crisis. Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings were pillars of support

for Clear Heaven Pass, and any one of them was an incredibly precious part of

local battle prowess. How could they just simply stand by and watch as one ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

died by Ling Han’s hand?

However, a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier was too strong. Even a powerful

Celestial King like the Imperial Void Celestial King could only flee in a panic,

and only managed to escape by fleeing with his full efforts. The other Celestial

Kings would not be qualified to do even that.

Thus, Ling Han struck the Heavy Metal Celestial King in a mere few moves

With a harsh stomp, this Ninth Heaven Celestial King had turned into a bloody

mush. Clang, a rain of blood descended from the heavens, and all life grieved

together.

This was too shocking. A mere Immortal Palace ‘Tier had actually killed a Ninth

Heaven Celestial King!

Everyone paled. Even if Ling Han had drawn on the power of the Black Tower,

this kind of battle accomplishment was still incredibly dazzling.

It could not be copied; just how many Heavenly Venerable Tier precious tools

were there in this world?

Hong Huang’s expression was dark. He had never imagined that Ling Han was

actually also the heir of a Heavenly Venerate, and was stronger than him at

that. Moreover, he had a Heavenly Venerable Tier precious Tool in his

possession!

He could not compare!

However, his expression did not change in the slightest. Instead, he only

moved his feet, planing to rapidly leave the palace and flee.

Ling Han had summoned his trump card, and it would defintiely draw the

three Heavenly Venerates over. Thus, he was undoubtedly going to die. Now,

Hong Huang naturally had to avoid his sharpness. Otherwise, if he was killed

by Ling Han, it would really not be worth it.

Ling Han suddenly appeared in front of him, and demanded in a cold tone,

“Where are you going

Hong Huang couldn’t help but pale. At first, he had planned to flee using the

opening created by the many Celestial Kings ganging up on Ling Han. He had

not thought that Ling Han would actually have an eye on him even in sucha

situation, causing his plan to fail.

“My master is the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable. Don’t seek your owm

death!” He did not panic, and issueda threat towards Ling Han.

Ling Han couldn’t help but smile. “Hong Huang, I thought you would not feel

afraid.

Hong Huang humphed. Anyone would feel afraid, but the way that people

handled fear was different. Some would kneel and beg for mercy, some would

analyze the situation calmly, and some would battle with courage.

His previous words were not humble, and it was also a real threat. What was

wrong with that?

“Ling Han, don’t cause harm to yourself” Hong Huang said calmly. “If you

leave now, there is still a sliver of hope. Otherwise.. your death is guaranteed!”

Ling Han cracked a grin, and said, “I beg to differ! Since he had already

anticipated that this kind of situation would happen, how could he possibly

have missed thinking of a way out?

He moved, and grabbed out at Hong Huang

“SCram” Hong Huang roared furiously. This word actually took solid form,

emanating an aura of supreme dominance.

It actually had a sliver of Heavenly Venerable Tier might!

This was a technique that the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable had planted

on him to use at the most dangerous moment to save himself. It could resolve

even the attack of a Ninth Heaven Celestial King

However, the person standing in front of him was no Ninth Heaven Celestial

King, but Ling Han, who was at the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier!

Weng, Ling Han’s hand descended, and with a blast, this word was shattered.

Practically without any pause, his giant hand descended resoundingly,

grabbing Hong Huang ina single stroke.

“Ling Han, do you dare battle me as an equal!” Hong Huang shouted loudly. He

was really defiant. He was a great Monarch Star, the disciple of a Heavenly

Venerate, with boundless future prospects laid out ahead of him. He definitely

would be able to enter the ranks of the strongest of the Celestial Realm.

“Battle your sister!” Ling Han ignored him, and turned to deliver a punch,

hitting a Nínth Heaven Celestial King that wanted to save Hong Huang. After

he sent out this punch, he bore down on him, planning to kill him witha single

stroke.

Even more Celestial Kings stepped out to stop him, but how could they possibly

be able to block Ling Han? Celestial blood spurted time and again as Celestial

Kings were killed by Ling Han’s hand. The heavens continuously rained down

blood without any pause.

Hong Huang’s expression became uglier and uglier. Ling Han was killing Ninth

Heaven Celestial Kings as easily as ifhe was slaughtering dogS, without any bit

of hesitation at all. In comparison, what was he worth?

If there were no accidents, he, too, would stop at the Ninth Heaven in future,

and that was a matter of many years later.

In this battle, it was almost like a hole was punched into Clear Heaven Pass

itself. Celestial Kings died by the dozens. They were those that had previously

been the most vocal, and wanted to hand Ling Han over to the Foreign Realm

to be dealt with.

Weng, a terrifying aura attacked, and a hole was ripped open in the skies. A

figure appeared, bearing an indescribably majestic aura.

Crack

The heaven and earth raged, pouring lightning on that person, as if the world

was about to end.

Even if this was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King, they would be hard-pressed

under pressure, but that man was completely at ease, and only acted as if this

lightning was merely a light shower of rain. Wherever his gaze passed, the

stars themselves were trembling, while winds and clouds were torn. This was

too extraordinary.

The Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable!

He was the first to appear.

“Master!” Hong Huang immediately called out, his tone filled with pleasant

surprise. As he saw it, the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable only had to

appear, and everything could be easily resolved. He naturally would not die

either.

“Let him go,” the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable said evenly, but his voice

was filled with a supreme intimidation, and even the Ninth Heaven Celestial

Kings would involuntarily obey his words.

This was a power that surpassed Regulations.

Yet Ling Han merely looked coldly at the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable,

and did not show a sliver of reverence. Even without the Black Tower, he, too,

had experienced power beyond Regulations. Though he had not been as strong

as the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable, qualitatively speaking, it was

similar in level.

He replied indifferently, “No!”

The Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable did not speak any further. Instead, he

stretched out a hand, and grabbed out at Ling Han. Boom, the moment he

moved, he arrived in front of Ling Han, and pressed his palm heavily down on

him.

Crack!

Lightning flashed once more in the heaven and earth. Innumerable lightning

giants formed. They were all at the Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier, and were

even boundlessly close to the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier, just like the

Imperial Void Celestial King. However, their number was overwhelmingly

great.

These lightning giants all lunged, unleashing a fierce assault on the Sealed

Emotion Heavenly Venerable.

This was equivalent to thousands of Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings; too

terrifying!

No wonder the Imperial Void Celestial King had previously said that the

Heavenly Venerates were hated by the heaven and earth, and could not move

they willed. Indeed, he only had to appear, and he would be pestered by the

divine lightning. The moment he made a move, he was targeted by the heaven

and earth, which manifested millions and millions of lightning Ninth Heaven

Celestial Kings to besiege him; this was extremely terrifying

Ling Han quickly retreated. The Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier only had the

additional label of Pseudo; how could that match a true Heavenly Venerable

Tier.

The Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable was unafraid of those lightning

giants, and did not even bother moving to parry their strikes. He merely

charged forwards. Peng, peng, peng, wherever he passed, all the lightning

vere smashed into bits and pieces, and could not cause the slightest bit

of harm to him at all.

His speed was too fast, and he caught up with Ling Han in an instant.

Ling Han laughed, and retorted, “So what if you are a Heavenly Venerate? You

are definitely not omnipotent!”

Pa, with a harsh twist of his hand, Hong Huang’s neck was instantly broken,

and under the barrage of the power of Regulation, Hong Huang’s mind also

exploded. He was completely and utterly dead.

The reason why Ling Han had not immediately killed Hong Huang was because

he had wanted to do this in front of the Sealed Emotion Heavenly Venerable so

that the latter would know that even if he was a Heavenly Venerate, he, too,

would have something that he could not accomplish.

With a casual toss, Hong Huang’s corpse was thrown aside. Then, with a flash,

Ling Han entered into the Black Tower. Xiu, the Black Tower exploded with its

full speed, shooting towards the neutral zone.

“Can you escape? Another cold voice rang out. The skies were torn apart, anda

supreme being with an astonishing aura walked out.

Jiuwu Heavenly Venerate!
