2887 Arrival of enemies

There were many people in the mountains, but no one spoke. The atmosphere seemed rather oppressive.

This was because there was a high chance that a huge battle would break out at any moment, and a major reshuffling of cards would occur. Many people would be eliminated in the battle, losing the right to touch this last vein of ore.

Sure enough, a few days later, the purge began, and elites led teams to chase off the lone elites.

After sweeping away these small fries, the remaining major factions would naturally fight to determine the ownership of the final and most precious vein of ore.

It was still relatively quiet where the Empress and Hu Niu were, but after half a month, there were still people who came over.

“Celestial Maidens, are you willing to join our Xuanwu Alliance?” Four people walked over together. Two of them were Fourth Tiers, while the other two were Third Tiers. This was an extremely powerful group.

“Not interested,” the Empress rejected him coldly without even opening her eyes.

“Then we have no choice but to ask the two of you to leave,” a Fourth Tier stated calmly.

“Does this place belong to you? What right do you have to chase me away?” Hu Niu immediately jumped up.

“It’s fine if you want to stay, but the two of you will have to be strong enough!” the Fourth Tier said.

“Don’t waste words on them; just chase them away,” another Fourth Tier said.

“Alright.” The first Fourth Tier nodded. He had a head full of gray hair, but his face was as young as a youth in his late teens. It was very strange.

He and the other red-robed Fourth Tier attacked at the same time, launching an attack at Hu Niu, while the other two Third Tiers joined forces to attack the Empress.

Two Fourth Tiers versus one Fourth Tier, two Third Tiers versus one Third Tier, both sides were a two-on-one battle. It was obvious that they had already made prior arrangements, and it was definite that two of them would be dealing with one each.

“Hahaha, Niu loves fighting the most!” Hu Niu laughed loudly. Her figure was incomparably agile, and she immediately charged towards the two Fourth Tiers.

The Empress, on the other hand, remained seated cross-legged. Only when the two Third Tiers arrived did she let out a soft exclamation and sent out a palm strike. Weng, a terrifying power surged, and a jade-like palm that was as large as the heavens appeared, pressing down on the two Third Tiers.

Reality proved that someone like her, who had condensed a number of Powers of Dimension to break through to the First Tier, would have a huge advantage in the early stage. However, because there was a limit to the Powers of Dimension, this advantage would also be continuously weakened as her cultivation level increased.

But even so, she was still far stronger than her peers of the same cultivation level. Even if she did really reach the Seventh Tier one day, she could still maintain a considerable advantage.

The Empress’s current cultivation level was the early stage of the Third Tier, but her battle prowess had directly soared to the peak stage of the Third Tier.

Hong, this palm of hers was too terrifying, enough to crush 99% of all Third Tiers.

“Not good!”

The two Third Tiers both cried out in alarm. They were both in the late stage of the Third Tier. Originally, they had the upper hand in terms of cultivation level, and now that it was a two-on-one fight, they should have a firm grasp of victory. However, they did not expect the Empress to actually be so freakish, which caused them to be completely unable to react in time.

Weng, weng! Seals lit up on their bodies, and they both channeled Heavenly Venerable Seals at the same time. Peng, peng! They each launched an attack to meet the Empress’s strike.

Shock waves rippled out. The two Third Tiers joined forces, and with the help of the Heavenly Venerable Seals, they finally withstood the Empress’s attack.

Their expressions couldn’t help but change. Although they had blocked this attack, the Empress had only done it casually, and hadn’t used her full strength at all. If she had also channeled the Heavenly Venerable Seals, how could they have withstood it?

Not good, there was an unexpected variable for their plans. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The Empress opened her eyes, her gaze filled with killing intent.

She actually hadn’t killed the enemy with a single strike?

Her pride had already been stimulated. With a humph, her figure flashed, and she took the initiative to charge towards the two Third Tiers. A Heavenly Venerable Seal was channeled by her, adding a terrifying power to her attacks, and her divine might was incomparably terrifying.

The two Third Tiers didn’t dare to take her assault head-on at all, and hurriedly retreated. If they took it head-on, they would probably be courting death.

“Lord Crimson Emperor!” They pleaded for help from the red-robed Fourth Tier.

“Interesting.” The red-robed Fourth Tier humphed lightly, then turned around, and sent a palm strike toward the Empress.

Hong, the might of Fourth Tier was incomparably terrifying.

Peng!

The Empress’s figure was forcefully stopped. One side had battle prowess of the peak of the Third Tier, while the other was in the middle stage of the Fourth Tier. The disparity between them was too great.

“Hahahaha, shameless woman, do you want Niu to help you?” Hu Niu clapped her hands and laughed. She had never liked the Empress, so why would she take the initiative to help?

The Empress didn’t say a word, avoiding the red-robed Fourth Tier and focusing on those two Third Tiers.

“Crimson Emperor, go and take down that Third Tier. I’ll handle things here,” the white-haired Fourth Tier said.

“Alright.” The red-robed Fourth Tier nodded. With such a casual attack, even if he could take down a peak-stage Third Tier, he would still have to expend some effort.

“Shameless!” Hu Niu shouted lightly, and intercepted the red-robed Fourth Tier.

“Little girl, you should take care of yourself first,” the white-haired Fourth Tier said with a smile. He pressed down with his palm, forcing Hu Niu to turn back and defend.

That was because he was also in the middle stage of the Fourth Tier, which was much stronger than Hu Niu.

“Niu’s angry now!” Hu Niu cried out, abruptly channeling a Heavenly Venerable Seal, and her battle prowess instantly soared.

This was a Heavenly Venerable Seal she had obtained from unearthing stones, and it increased her strength by more than 20 times.

In this way, her might instantly soared, and she broke through the blockade of the white-haired Fourth Tier, and joined forces with the Empress.

“White Hair, you can’t even stop an early-stage Fourth Tier?” The red-robed Fourth Tier looked at the white-haired Fourth Tier teasingly.

The white-haired Fourth Tier humphed, and similarly channeled a Heavenly Venerable Seal of his own, immediately raising his battle prowess.

Boom!

He had an advantage in terms of cultivation level, but his Heavenly Venerable Seal was inferior to Hu Niu’s, so their battle prowess was not much different.

However, everyone knew that Heavenly Venerable Seals could only release energy for two hours. At that time… Hu Niu’s battle prowess would rapidly decrease, and she would no longer be a match for him.

However, for now, Hu Niu was enough to restrain the two Fourth Tiers, allowing the Empress to free herself and suppress the two Third Tiers.

The two Third Tiers could only continuously dodge, relying on the two Fourth Tiers to strike out from time to time to help them out of their dilemma.

They were all incomparably ashamed and resentful. They had clearly come to suppress that Third Tier, but now they had become a burden. Fortunately, the time that Hu Niu could display her might was limited. As long as they dragged it out for another two hours, she would be powerless to continue.

Two hours passed very quickly. Just as the red-robed man and the white-haired man were preparing to counter with all their might, Hu Niu channeled the second seal, and there was not much decline to her battle prowess at all.

...

“What?!”

This shocked the red-robed man and the white-haired man greatly. How could Hu Niu still use a high-level Heavenly Venerable Seal?

Although it was only a seventh-grade Heavenly Venerable Seal, because eighth grade Heavenly Venerable Seals were already considered top-notch, seventh-grade Heavenly Venerable Seals were definitely far above average. One had to remember something here. Before these primitive dimensions were discovered, just how many Heavenly Venerable Seals were there in the world?

It was only now that there were more Heavenly Venerable Seals, but they were basically only of the ninth grade.

However, Hu Niu used two seventh-grade seals in a row. How could they not be shocked and envious?

If it weren’t for a certain someone having warned them in advance, they’d really want to kill Hu Niu and extract these two seventh-grade seals from her.

Fine, they would just have to last another two hours.
