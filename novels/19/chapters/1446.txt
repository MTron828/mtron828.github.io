Chapter 1447 Conclusion of the First Stage

Shan Jingyi arrived beside Nie Tiancheng at this moment, saying, “Couldn’t we have ended the battle earlier if we all attacked at once? Don’t forget, we’re a team! The most important thing is the overall benefit of the team!”Ding Ping and Jiuyao wanted to retort him, yet Ling Han tapped their shoulders, saying, “Fine, we’ll fight with the overall benefit of the team in mind next time. I’ll also participate in the battle.”

Shan Jingyi and Nie Tiancheng exchanged a glance, delight in their eyes because of the imminent success of their plan.

They wanted to target Ling Han, so they naturally needed to understand Ling Han’s strength first. After all, one could only ascertain victory if they understood their opponent. Moreover, since his two disciples were already so powerful, could Ling Han be any weaker than them?

Shan Jingyi and Nie Tiancheng didn’t want to dig themselves into a hole. If Ling Han were too powerful, they would choose to bide their time first.

Ling Han smiled faintly. He could easily guess the thoughts of Shan Jingyi and Nie Tiancheng.

When they came across another team, Ling Han indeed participated in the battle. He casually snapped his fingers, sending a wave of Sword Qi toward his opponents. This could be viewed as a relatively powerful technique. However, in terms of extraordinary qualities, Ling Han didn’t seem to show any.

The Notionless Saint couldn’t suppress his itch, so he also participated in the battle. However, he didn’t unleash his Saintly aura. This was his trump card, so he definitely wouldn’t use it until the most critical moments.

Only Empress Luan Xing didn’t participate in any of the battles. However, she was a charming beauty they all adored and admired, so who would step forward to criticize her?

2400 meters, 2700 meters, 2970 meters...

At this height, there were already very few teams remaining—only 100 or so. Although there were only 30 meters remaining to the peak of the valley, theoretically speaking, only five to six of the teams would be able to ascend to this height during this round of battles. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Everyone became even more alert and serious. Each of these 100 or so teams had risen up after defeating countless other teams. As such, which of these teams wasn’t extremely powerful?

If they were defeated by an even more powerful opponent, they would fall back down to the bottom of the valley. At that time, they would have to battle their way up again.

“Die!”

After a short pause, chaotic battles instantly broke out between the teams again.

Meanwhile, Ling Han and the others finally came across a powerful opponent. Without Empress Luan Xing participating, and without Ling Han unleashing his full power, the skirmish between their teams lasted for several long hours before a victor was finally determined.

They had defeated their opponents!

Ling Han’s team rose several more meters. However, glancing into the distance, Gu Daoyi’s two teams had already risen by many more meters. This was a sign of their overwhelming battle prowess.

Meanwhile, at this moment, the teams of the supreme king tiers finally separated themselves from the remaining king tiers.

“Zi Chenfeng!” the North Emperor exclaimed as he gazed at a team of seven in the distance. Among this team, there was a young man who surprisingly had flowing purple hair. There was also a pair of horns on his head, though it was difficult to tell what kind of horns these were. In any case, these horns didn’t affect his handsomeness in the least.

“I battled against him several thousand years ago. However, I was defeated in a single strike.”

Ling Han nodded upon hearing this, saying, “He’s reached the pinnacle level of the Heavenly Body Tier!” If they were at the same cultivation level, no one could defeat the North Emperor in a single strike.

“Long Xiangyue!” Nie Tiancheng exclaimed as he gazed at another location. His pupils contracted, and cold sweat surprisingly started to drip from his forehead.

That was a woman who possessed an incredibly attractive figure. She was dressed in a suit of golden scale armor and also wearing a helmet that was decorated with dragons. Her luscious hair was tied into a bun inside this helmet, and even from this distance, they could feel the might and vigor radiating from her. She was more so exuding an astonishing vitality and liveliness. It was as if she were a True Dragon in human form. Truly, her aura was far too astounding.

Moreover, she was alone with her sword. She hadn’t formed a team, nor did she have any followers. Her demeanor was one of independence and strength.

“Second in the World!” Shan Jingyi exclaimed in astonishment. This was another rank three king tier who was standing at the peak of the current generation of prodigies.

Ling Han glanced over. Second in the World definitely couldn’t be regarded as a handsome man. However, he was extremely large in stature, being at least a head taller than most other people. He was sturdily built, and his skin was a tanned copper color. His arm was dense with hair, and his face was more so covered by a thick beard. At a glance, he genuinely looked like a powerful bear standing on its hind legs.

Judging by appearance alone, this person didn’t look anything like a powerful king tier. He looked neither ethereal nor full of wisdom and vigor. If he were placed on some random street, anyone would think that he was the thug of the town.

However, contrary to expectations, it was someone like this who was a supreme king tier. The name Second in the World was enough to explain everything.

Second in the World wasn’t alone—there was a team of people behind him. Unexpectedly, this was a team of elegant and graceful women. Moreover, they were all as beautiful as flowers. This was a jarring sight, and they didn’t seem to fit together with Second in the World at all. To say nothing of beautiful flowers being placed with cow dung, this was still at least a case of beauties and a beast.

“Why isn’t Empress Luan Xing here?” the Stone Emperor murmured to himself. He hadn’t seen Empress Luan Xing before, and Ling Han and the others hadn’t introduced her to him, either. Thus, he was still looking around in search of her. However, he couldn’t find anyone who fitted the descriptions of the rumors.

The North Emperor and Nie Tiancheng were also searching for her. However, like the Stone Emperor, they were also completely baffled. Little did they realize that Empress Luan Xing had been beside them this entire time.

Xiu!

Long Xiangyue was the first to move, charging toward a team of 12. Once she defeated them, she would obtain 12 floating rocks and immediately rise to the peak.

“Humph! So what if you’re a rank three king tier? You’re by yourself, so there’s no chance that you’ll win!” The team of 12 immediately started to counterattack. They were all rank two king tiers, and they all possessed extremely powerful weapons. In fact, some of their weapons were no less valuable than Nie Tiancheng’s celestial peach branch or Shan Jingyi’s replica Six Elements Mountains.

Long Xiangyue slashed with her sword. This strike had a celestial’s elegance, exuding a profoundly ethereal aura.

Moreover, she was incredibly domineering, directly charging at them head-on. Her suit of scale armor started to glow, and it was as if her helmet had also become alive. It transformed into a genuine dragon head, unleashing a tremendous dragon might as it roared. Even the supreme king tiers could feel the boundless pressure exuding from this roar.

True Dragons—once they matured, they would already be Genesis Tier Saints. They possessed the most powerful bloodline in the Immortal Realm.

With just her sword, Long Xiangyue was still tremendously powerful, her relentless attacks quickly causing her opponents to become wounded and disheveled.

With an overwhelming might, she forcefully snatched the 12 floating rocks of her opponents. She then immediately rose upward, becoming the first person to reach the peak of the valley.

The image of an hourglass instantly materialized on the gigantic golden boulder hovering above the valley. Moreover, the sand within it had already started to flow.

Someone had finally broken through the first stage and charged into the second stage!

However, Long Xiangyue was unable to rise any higher. This was because there was no one else at the same level as her. Even if she lowered her position by six meters and the others raised theirs by six, that would still only make up 12 of the many meters between them.

She could only wait.

Meanwhile, the other teams also started to do battle. The countdown had already begun, so they could no longer take things slowly and steadily.

Among the king tiers who had come here, who didn’t yearn to ascend the giant golden boulder at the peak?

‘Charge!’

After a series of intense battles, the teams that possessed supreme king tiers all started to rise steadily, breaking through to the second stage one after another.

Upon reaching this stage, each team would naturally disband.

The cultivators could also see that as long as two people were together, the floating rocks beneath them would automatically begin to crumble. If they didn’t engage in battle, their only fate would be to “die together”. That being the case, teaming up would be a near-impossible task.

Nie Tiancheng and Shan Jingyi exchanged a glance before both of them suddenly lashed out, striking at the floating rock beneath Ling Han’s feet.

It was for this moment that they had endured him for so long!

They were already impatient to see the astonishment and shock on Ling Han’s face. That would definitely be a beautiful sight to behold.

However, Ling Han suddenly turned around, a strange smile tugging at the corners of his lips.
