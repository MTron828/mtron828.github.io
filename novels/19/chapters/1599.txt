Chapter 1600: Banishing technique

Ling Han travelled on the golden path. This was his first time journeying through this method, which was very refreshing to him.

However, after merely half a day, the power in his body disappeared, and he had no choice but to stop and draw out the Cloud Piercing Shuttle to continue his journey. And using the Cloud Piercing Shuttle to commence his galactic journey meant that he had no need to pay attention all the time as long as there were galactic coordinates in place.

He entered into the Black Tower, and called the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden and the Empress over. Now that he had something good, he naturally had to share it. The two women were his wives, so whatever he had, there naturally was a share that belonged to them as well.

However, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden was the first to shake her head. “I do not want to be distracted. My current target is to attempt to break through to a higher cultivation level, and if I also cultivated the Regulations of Space, it would not be a good thing for me.”

The Empress also shook her head, and said, “I haven’t completely grasped the celestial technique contained in my bloodline, and I have no wish to be greedy and never satisfied at this time, either. It is enough for you yourself to consume this Void Flower.”

“Why are the two of you acting so reserved with me?” Ling Han asked, smiling.

Skills would never be a burden, what more when it was the Regulations of Space.

The Empress smiled, and explained, “The Regulations of Space that one can grasp with one Void Flower are limited, and if it is shared among three, it is possible that none of the three will be able to grasp it. Thus, go ahead and consume it. Sister Feng’s target is breaking through to the Genesis Tier, while I am aiming for the pinnacle level of the Eternal River Tier. As for you, try your best to increase your abilities in a battle of equals as much as possible.”

Ling Han thought for a moment, and then replied, “All right. I think we would obtain more Void Flowers, Flame Flowers, or the like in future, so I will take this one first.”

“Hoho.” Small Tower made a timely appearance, and gave him a cold laugh.

Ling Han ignored it. The proud Tower seemed fonder and fonder of showing its presence recently. He arrived underneath the Reincarnation Tree, and plucked a petal of the Void Flower before he tossed it into his mouth.

This was an unusual object nurtured by the heaven and earth. Even the Black Tower had no means to cultivate it, or he could get a few hundred to over a thousand, and everyone by his side would be able to cultivate the Regulations of Space.

He chewed, and multicoloured light immediately surged in his mouth, multiple seals of great dao throbbing. Ling Han hurriedly closed his mouth tightly. If he opened his mouth at this time, it was definite that a great amount of the medicinal effects would escape, and that would really be a great loss.

He could not bother with chewing any more, and directly swallowed it into his stomach. Hong, these patterns of great dao flowed in his body, and finally appeared in his mind, forming an empty world.

A world, a sea of Regulations.

This world was not complete. Ling Han quickly ate another petal, and continued to patch up this world. He ate one petal after another, and did not even waste the stem. Finally, in his mind, there appeared a broken world, but compared to the beginning, it was considerably more complete.

He continued his comprehension. There was a time limit to the medicinal effects. If he could not grasp it for a long time, this world would disappear from his mind.

Space was a very, very large concept, and included a great many different branches, such as tearing open space, instant movement to another location, diverting attacks, and assimilating the items around oneself to vanish without a trace. They all similarly belonged to the Regulations of Space.

The Void Flower grew in the gaps between space, and was formed from absorbing the Regulations of heaven and earth, but exactly which Regulation of Space it would form was indefinite.

This would depend on one’s luck. Similar Regulations of Space would vary in strength and practical application.

What Ling Han most wanted was to be able to move objects, or even divert attacks. This was an incredibly powerful ability. If he didn’t have that, it would also be good if he could instantly teleport himself.

But his luck was not that good. The Regulations contained in this Void Flower were about creating a separate dimension, and the time was considerably short.

What use was that? To store items? But this space was not stable at all, and it could only be maintained for the time of a single breath. If he placed anything in, it very soon would fall back out.

Ling Han smiled bitterly. This ability was a little useless... hold on!

He paused suddenly. More importantly, could this space accommodate living creatures?

If it could, then it would be very useful.

‘When my enemy’s attack reached me, I would be able to dodge into this separate dimension, and calmly avoid this strike.’

Then, he would first have to grasp this Regulation, and only then would he be able to start experimenting to see whether it was possible to use it to store living creatures or not.

At this time, one day underneath the Reincarnation Tree was equivalent to 10 years. The medicinal effects of the Void Flower could continue for about three days, which also meant that he had about 30 years’ time to comprehend it.

He sat down in a cross-legged position, and did not release the slightest sign of aura, as if he himself was an old tree. This was because he had withdrawn all his energy, and completely poured it into comprehension of this Regulation.

Three days passed, but for Ling Han, it was a whole 30 years’ time spent comprehending the Regulation of Space.

He opened his eyes, and broke into a grin. He had already grasped these Regulations of Space. Unfortunately, the Regulations that this Void Flower contained were extremely limited in the first place.

“Let’s give it a try!” Ling Han exited the Black Tower, and then casually summoned out a wild hog. He pressed down his right hand, and this wild hog amazingly vanished.

It had been temporarily thrown into another dimension.

It had merely taken the time for a single breath. This wild hog appeared once more, and released frightened cries. The previous experience was much too frightening for it. It had suddenly been isolated in an unfamiliar space, almost terrified to death.

“It can accommodate living creatures, or I could not have been able to take it into the separate dimension,” Ling Han concluded. “Let’s try it out again.”

He threw the wild hog into the separate dimension again, and then shot out a punch at that spot with his full strength. After a single breath, the wild hog’s sharp cry was heard once more, and it was completely unharmed.

“As expected, it can be used to dodge attacks!” Ling Han exclaimed in delight.

“However, what extent can it reach?” He wanted to experiment again with the wild hog, but when he saw the hog looking at him with pitiful eyes, he couldn’t help but smile, and tossed it into the Black Tower. “On the basis of your merit, I will not eat you in future.”

He drew out a bowl, stored it away into the separate dimension, and then rapidly struck with the Divine Demon Sword.

Pa, the space was shattered, and that bowl naturally had been broken to bits.

“As expected. Faced with overwhelming power or higher level Regulations, this separate dimension is not safe, either.” Ling Han was grim. He pressed a hand on himself, and xiu, he had suddenly vanished, and then reappeared.

“Actually, when my opponent’s attack reaches me, I could also draw the attack into the separate dimension, and it would reach me a breath later. Even if it only slowed down by a single instant, it would be enough time for me to dodge.

“This Regulation of Space, I can call it... Banishing Technique!

“There should be even more uses to it, I can slowly develop it.

“Furthermore, my present cultivation level is too weak. When my power increases a little further, I will be able to slowly complete these incomplete Regulations. I can’t possibly form Regulations out of nothing, but with this base to refer to, there would be no problem.”

Ling Han exited the Black Tower. Sea Space Planet was already within sight.
