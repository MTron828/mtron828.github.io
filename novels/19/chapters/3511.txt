Chapter 3512: Summoned again

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The matter was really not very complicated. First, it was the destruction of a Royal Empire, and then it became a prison, and that was all.

Ling Han was rendered speechless for a moment. Though Brother Monkey had spoken very casually, but it was the destruction of a Royal Empire, so just how many people had died?

“Brother Monkey, just how strong is this Majestic Empire?” he couldn’t help but ask. After so many years, the prison had also been broken, so would that Majestic Empire make a comeback?

Brother Monkey laughed, “There are nine levels on the Celestial Path, and being able to be called a Majestic Empire, one must have an elite that is on the level of Sect Master. In other words, he is standing on the sixth level of Celestial Path, and is called the Minor Advanced Tier.”

“However, the Azure Dragon Majestic Empire still has an old monster that hasn’t died yet. He’s a Venerate at the fourth level. If it weren’t for that old guy, Old Sun wouldn’t have been suppressed!” The monkey’s expression was vicious, and he bared his teeth and glared at Ling Han, appearing extremely terrifying.

“He was the one who suppressed you?” Ling Han asked.

Brother Monkey nodded, “The old monster didn’t dare to kill Old Sun, so he could only suppress Old Sun. Originally, he wanted to suppress Old Sun for the rest of my life, but how could this heaven and earth be able to truly trap Old Sun? In these two thousand years, Old Sun’s strength improved every day, and after Old Sun escape, I will go to find that old monster and smash him into mush with a single staff strike!”

This Brother Monkey was really a bloodthirsty character. However, who would not be filled with resentment after being suppressed for more than two thousand years?

Ling Han was surprised, and said, “Brother Monkey, you should already be an elite of the level of Sect Master, yet that old monster doesn’t dare to kill you. Could it be that you have an even stronger senior?”

Brother Monkey was proud, “That is natural. In the past, Old Sun’s distant ancestor had stood at the peak of Celestial Path, and ruled the world on his own. He was invincible for an era, and now, his whereabouts are only unknown. That old monster naturally would not dare to kill Old Sun, fearing that when my ancestor returned, he would kill him with a single palm strike.” Peak stage of Celestial Path!

Ling Han couldn’t help but be dumbfounded. This Brother Monkey that had been crushed at the foot of the mountain, and his ancient ancestor had actually once been an invincible existence?

“Second Brother, there are a great many things that you should not know yet. The waters here are deep!” Brother Monkey gave him a warning first, to prevent Ling Han from pursuing the matter further, “Cultivate well. If you encounter anything that cannot be resolved, there is no harm in coming here.”

Ling Han knew that a Venerate Tier-level elite was needed to be able to suppress Brother Monkey, so his cultivation level must have reached Minor Advanced Tier, and he was a figure on the level of Sect Master.

He had also heard about it these few days. Even in the galaxy, Sect Master-level people were still top-notch elites, and could dominate over a planet. In the past, Brother Monkey was such an existence, but unfortunately, this had alerted a Venerate Tier.

Brother Monkey was filled with confidence. He was sure that he would be able to escape soon, and once he managed to escape, it meant that he had advanced into the level of Venerate Tier.

As a Venerate, he stood on the seventh step of Celestial Path, and there were pitifully few of them.

Two days later, Princess Bixiao finally woke up. She was overjoyed, and her bloodline had improved slightly, helping her reach the level of two-star genius.

She thanked Brother Monkey, and knew that all this was thanks to Ling Han. Thus, she deliberately pretended to be very intimate with Ling Han.

“Hey, you’re being very shameless like this,” Ling Han leaned over and whispered.

“If you dare expose me, I’ll tell Brother Monkey about you stealing my undergarments!” Princess Bixiao threatened.

Ling Han wore a strange expression. ‘Do you think Brother Monkey will blame me for being vulgar because of this?’

Brother Monkey’s way of thinking was different from ordinary people. Who knows, he may praise him for being sentimental.

However, when had this Demon Race princess become so “shameless”? Could it be that she had been influenced by him?

He laughed loudly, and said, “All right. I will not expose you, and will even cooperate with you.”

“How do we cooperate?” Princess Bixiao asked.

Ling Han stretched out a hand, and wrapped his arm around Princess Bixiao’s slender waist, “This is what a couple is.”

Princess Bixiao’s whole body was covered with goosebumps. At first, her body stiffened, but she immediately entered a berserk state. Boom, a Mystery Realm Tier’s strength was completely unleashed, and added with her two star battle prowess, she was completely capable of insta-killing 99% of Mystery Realm Tiers.

She delivered a palm strike at Ling Han, “Pervert, I am going to kill you!”

Ling Han touched the tiger’s bottom, and naturally began to run at the first instant. He said with a smile, “Bixiao darling, are you planning to murder your husband?”

One fled, while the other pursued, causing chaos in the Monkey Valley.

“Second King and Second Madam are really loving, showing off their affection so early in the morning,” one of the monkeys said.

“You’re not a dog, you’re a monkey.0”

“Eve been single for so long that I think I’m a dog…”

After all this commotion, Princess Bixiao finally suppressed her anger. This was the Monkey Valley, so even if Ling Han didn’t flee, would she be able to kill Ling Han?

The two of them stayed in the Monkey Valley for half a day. Unfortunately, Brother Monkey did not have any treasures to bestow on them at present. Ling Han did not mind this. Firstly, he valued relationships more, and secondly, hadn’t Brother Monkey been of great help to him?

He bade Brother Monkey farewell. He was sure that the two brothers would reunite outside in the near future.

The two of them set off, returning to the Imperial City. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Ling Han also asked Brother Monkey about the origins of that broken stone tablet, but Brother Monkey told him that this thing had a very strong Yin Qi. It was very possible that it was a tombstone, and that was why it had been tainted with an air of death.

However, even Brother Monkey admitted that the two and a half words on it were incredible. They were filled with Dao, and even he couldn’t write them out.

Thus, Ling Han did not throw away this broken stone tablet. Instead, he deliberately used a Spatial Spirit Tool to store this thing alone, to prevent it from contaminating other things.

They naturally couldn’t be so extravagant on their way back, using the golden bull as a mount. Thankfully, the warship was still waiting for them, and hadn’t been discovered by the members of the Highest Splendor Sect. They boarded the warship, and flew for three to four days before finally returning to the Imperial Capital.

Ling Han released the news through the Foreign Affairs Department that as the Highest Splendor Sect had disobeyed the emperor’s command, Gongsun Liang’s cultivation level was crippled as a warning to the world.

When the news spread out, the whole world was shaken.

And when this news was confirmed, it drew the wariness of countless forces. It should be known that even a Cauldron Forging Tier elite had an arm severed, so how unfathomable was the strength of the Foreign Affairs Department?

Not too long after, various parties arrived.

Within a day, the Foreign Affairs Department received a notice of submission from several dozen forces, and they were only waiting for the Foreign Affairs Department to send someone over to receive it.

This naturally made the Foreign Affairs Department run around in circles. Xuanyuan Dingguo, Lian Xuerong, Hu Er, and the others were all running around in circles. Even so, there was still far from enough manpower.

Under such circumstances, the Imperial Princes naturally began to make arrangements for their subordinates, hoping that they could interfere in the affairs of the Foreign Affairs Department and profit from it.

This was once again resolutely rejected by Ling Han. No matter how displeased the Imperial Princes were, he did not take it to heart at all.

Although Brother Monkey didn’t explain in detail, Ling Han guessed that he and Chen Fengyan definitely knew each other. That being the case, he was Brother Monkey’s sworn brother. In front of Chen Fengyan, there was no need for him to be humble, what more those Imperial Princes.

So what if you guys hate me to the core? If you have the ability, then tell Chen Fengyan to remove me.

Who would have thought that Chen Fengyan would actually issue an imperial decree, personally delivered by Zhu Qi, the chief eunuch, to invite Ling Han to meet him?
