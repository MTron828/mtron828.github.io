3093 Training fist technique

Ancient Dao Sect, Li Changdan’s courtyard.

“Senior Brother Li, something bad has happened. I heard that Lord Sect Master intends to make Ling Han the Dao Child.” A young man hurried in, his face full of anger.

Li Changdan was practicing his fist technique, but there was no change in his expression when he heard this. He continued to practice his punches, and said calmly, “Don’t panic. The sky hasn’t collapsed yet!”

“Why hasn’t it collapsed yet!?” the young man said anxiously, and started to panic. “Senior Brother Li, you should be the Dao Child of our sect, to continue the legacy of Lord Sect Master and travel the world to establish our reputation on behalf of our sect.

“Who does that Ling Han think he is? He is just an orphan that popped out from a rock. It is unknown if he’s even human. How can such a person be our Dao Child?

“Senior Brother Li, you started practicing martial arts at the age of 11. Now that you’re 21 years old, you’ve already opened nine meridians in your body. Even senior brothers who are much older than you usually only open six meridians.

“Once you open another meridian, you can even become an elder of the sect.

“That Ling Han can’t be compared to you even if he tries with all his might. If he is to become the Dao Child, I’ll be the first to disagree!”

The young man spoke angrily, as if it was his position as the Dao Child that Ling Han had stolen.

Li Changdan was still as calm as ever. As he swung his fist, a vigorous aura emanated from him, opening up nine meridians. Whether it was in the Ancient Dao Sect or anywhere else, he was qualified to be called an elite.

“Tongfeng, this is just a rumor. Besides, even Lord Sect Master can’t ignore everyone’s objections and rashly make someone the Dao Child,” he said indifferently.

The young man’s surname was Zheng, and his full name was Zheng Tongfeng. He was a year younger than Li Changdan, and had opened four meridians. His aptitude could only be said to be average.

He looked at Li Changdan, and gradually calmed down.

“But Senior Brother Li, everyone’s saying that if we let him do as he pleases, he might really be able to do as he wishes in the future.” He was still worried.

Li Changdan smiled. “Don’t worry, there’s still a long time. To be the Dao Child, he would naturally have to be able to withstand the trial. You can’t be a person with bad character.”

“Senior Brother Li, you mean…” Realization dawned on Zheng Tongfeng, and his words trailed off.

If one wanted to become the Dao Child, not only did he have to have natural talent in martial arts, but he also had to pass the test of morals. However, if Ling Han did something wrong, would he still have the qualifications to become the Dao Child?

“Hehe.” Li Changdan continued to punch. He had to open the 10th meridian as soon as possible so that he could truly gain a foothold in this great world. Otherwise, he would only be a small fry.

As for Ling Han?

“Humph!”

***

Ling Han first flipped through the fist manual. Although his current strength had fallen to rock bottom, his comprehension ability had not changed in the slightest. He had only flipped through the fist manual once, and he already understood it completely.

“It’s a pity that the martial arts I’ve mastered before can’t be applied at all, or else I won’t have to cultivate such rudimentary knowledge,” Ling Han muttered.

Although this was an extremely superficial fist technique, it was in accordance with certain Regulations of this world. After practicing it, one could strengthen their body and possess the power to shatter rocks and break pillars.

Ling Han began to practice in the courtyard.

With this training, he immediately realized that he had been biting off more than he could chew.

Understanding was one thing, but being able to do it was another.

This fist technique was very artful, and required one’s body to be twisted. Many of the moves violated the human body’s structure. If one forcefully twisted his body, not only would it hurt, but some angles would also be impossible to achieve.

In the past, that would not have been a big deal for Ling Han, as his body could’ve been twisted at will. Now, however, he was just an ordinary person. If he forcefully twisted his body, the result would be him breaking his own bones.

“I have to cultivate the toughness of my body first. Otherwise, I can’t cultivate this fist technique!” Ling Han said to himself. He began to train his toughness.

Pressing on his legs and bending his waist, he began the basic training.

When it came to practicing martial arts, Ling Han had always been very crazy. In order to start as soon as possible, he tormented himself as if his life depended on it. If someone else were to press down on his legs, it would be enough if he could do a split. Ling Han, however, almost bent his legs to the side of his ears.

If he wanted to do it, he had to do it to the best of his ability.

Fortunately, toughness was very easy to cultivate. After merely two days, Ling Han once again began to cultivate his fist technique.

After one round, Ling Han frowned. There were too many imperfections.

Again.

He corrected his mistakes over and over again until he was exhausted.

After resting for a night, Ling Han continued.

In terms of strengthening his foundations, he was a person who pursued perfection, almost to the point of being a maniac. He even got Huan Xue to get him a mirror and then told her to leave. He stripped down to his underpants, and practiced punching in front of the mirror, picking out all of his subtle flaws.

Under such crazy demands, he would completely master this fist technique in another day. It was as if he had practiced it for more than 10 years without any slacking off.

The sun had already set, but Ling Han did not stop. Since he had already mastered the fist technique, it was even more important for him to open his first meridian and restart his path of cultivation.

However, he couldn’t sense anything even after practicing dozens of times.

If he could not feel the existence of his meridians, how could he open them?

‘Could it be that I’m not suitable to practice martial arts here?’ Ling Han stopped, appearing rather puzzled.

He didn’t know where the Divine Stone came from, but he knew what was inside.

The prerequisite for him to walk out was that he had absorbed all the power there. How could that Divine Stone be ordinary?

Therefore, he had to be a prodigy.

‘I need the Meridian Guiding Fruit to open the path of martial arts?’ Ling Han frowned. ‘It’s late now. I’ll have a good rest and practice again tomorrow.’

The next morning, before the sun rose, Ling Han began to practice his fist techniques. However, just like last night, he still did not sense any meridians. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

‘I don’t believe it!’

Ling Han continued to practice his fist techniques. He was a stubborn person, and had once been an existence above the Seventh Tier. His willpower was like iron, so how could he easily give up?

A golden light appeared on the horizon. The sun was about to come out.

‘Huh?!’

Ling Han was suddenly startled. He realized that he had absorbed a faint trace of power, and it was slowly traversing his body.

This power rose from the bottom of his left foot, and spread all the way to his left side of his abdomen, then up the left side of his chest, past his neck, and stopped under his left eye.

‘I sensed it?’

He stopped, and this power immediately disappeared. However, Ling Han had a feeling that his body seemed to have become slightly stronger.

This was very weak, but Ling Han’s divine sense was extremely sharp. He could conclude that this was definitely not his imagination.

Hiss, this was very unbelievable. Not only did he discover the meridians, but he also directly guided the power to circulate in them?

According to Sun Jianfang, there were a total of 12 meridians in the human body. They were known as the 12 main meridians, and there were diagrams showing the circulation of power.

However, since there was a diagram, why were so many people still unable to open the path of cultivation?

That was because the meridians were not blood vessels or bones. Even if someone was cut open, they would not be able to see or touch them. The diagram only meant that the meridians were nearby, but one still needed to sense and explore them himself.
