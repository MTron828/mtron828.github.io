Chapter 1721: Biggest Fools

Ding Yaolong’s appearance instantly caused Han Lu to go on full alert. He didn’t dare to wantonly attack people anymore.

Although Ding Yaolong was only a fourth severance grand elder of a small clan, and although the celestial techniques that he possessed definitely couldn’t rival that of elites from three-star clans, his ability to reach the Severing Mundane Tier in such an environment proved the extraordinary nature of his talent. In fact, his talent was enough to surmount the gulf caused by his inferior celestial techniques.

This was a powerful opponent.

Han Lu looked at Ding Yaolong coldly. He felt like there was no need to speak any nonsense. If he couldn’t deal with this opponent, he would simply return to his clan to request help from Dividing Soul Tier elites. Once they came, could they not subdue a Severing Mundane Tier force?

“Brother Han, has there been some misunderstanding?” Ding Yaolong asked with a grave expression. As long as the Ding Clan was in the right, they wouldn’t need to be afraid of the Han Clan. Otherwise, was the Fu Clan a mere decoration? Would they allow other forces to provoke them so wantonly?

Internal battles within the clan were one matter, and being bullied and provoked by outside forces was another matter.

“Misunderstanding? Humph! Misunderstanding?!” Han Lu was also filled with rage.

‘All of your dirty schemes have been revealed, yet you’re still telling me this is a misunderstanding? Do you think I’m a stupid monkey? Misunderstand your mom!’

Ding Yaolong could also be considered as an extremely intelligent person. However, he was completely stumped as to why Han Lu was so furious at this moment. Even if someone were angry, it should have been him, no? Why was Han Lu so angry?

Anyhow, he was also angered at this moment. The memorial tablets of his ancestors had been destroyed, and this was a huge provocation!

“Brother Han, please do calm down. I’ll lead you out of Dark Moon City!”

Even if the Han Clan were in the wrong, Ding Yaolong still didn’t dare to target Han Lu. Thus, he could only ask him to leave the city so that he couldn’t kill more people.

“Hahaha!” Han Lu chuckled coldly, and said, “How audacious of your Ding Clan! You’re but a measly Severing Mundane Tier force, yet you actually dare to provoke the Han Clan! How incredibly admirable!”

He called them admirable, yet his face was burning with rage and disdain.

Ding Yaolong’s expression instantly darkened. ‘You’ve almost unearthed the graves of our ancestors, yet you’re still scolding us instead? Even if you’re from a three-star force, you still can’t wantonly pick on others like this!’

“Then I’ll have to offend you!” Ding Yaolong said as he lashed out. He was going to subdue Han Lu and expel him from Dark Moon City.

However, Han Lu naturally wouldn’t cower. He immediately rushed over to battle with Ding Yaolong.

They were both tremendously powerful fourth severance grand elders, though Ding Yaolong was slightly more powerful in terms of true strength. After all, if he were in a three-star force, he would be talented enough to reach the Dividing Soul Tier even if he weren’t talented enough to reach the Immortal Palace Tier.

They were both at the fourth severance, yet he was the more powerful of the two.

However, this was the ancestral shrine of the Ding Clan, and even though more than half of it had already been obliterated, many members of the Ding Clan were still present. Moreover, the surrounding lands were also part of the Ding Clan’s territory. As such, Ding Yaolong naturally didn’t dare to unleash his full power.

Meanwhile, Han Lu didn’t have any such worries. He simply needed to unleash his full battle prowess.

Their battle was intense, and even the fourth severance elites of the Long Clan and the Duan Clan were alarmed. They immediately rushed over to appease the situation.

This was Dark Moon City, after all, so the three clans were all in the same boat when it came to dealing with outsiders. Otherwise, the Black Moon Sect would also punish them later.

With the addition of these two elites, Han Lu was naturally no match for them anymore. Thus, he could only stop his attacks and retreat. His expression was cold as he gazed at the three fourth severance elites, and he said in a menacing voice, “Very well! All of you want to become enemies of the Han Clan, am I correct?”

“Brother Han, is there some unresolvable dispute?” the grand elder from the Long Clan asked patiently.

Han Lu pointed at Ding Yaolong, and replied, “Ask him!”

‘Ask me?’

Ding Yaolong was completely mystified. ‘You’ve already obliterated the ancestral shrine of my clan, yet you’re still telling them to ask me? How should I know why you’re acting like a madman?’

He flicked his sleeves, and said, “I don’t know anything. I only know that my Ding Clan was almost obliterated by you!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Han Lu was just about to say something, yet he suddenly became wild with rage upon seeing something in the corner of his eyes. His hand was shaking as he pointed at Ding Yaolong, and he shouted, “Very well! Very well! Very well! How courageous of you! How very courageous of you!”

What was going on?

Ding Yaolong and the elites from the Long Clan and the Duan Clan turned around, only to see a person and a large black dog standing far away in the distance. Apart from them, there was no one else.

Was there something wrong with this? Why was Han Lu shaking in anger?

However, how could Han Lu not be wild with anger?

Ling Han was the criminal who had “killed” Han Qi. Moreover, the detestable large black dog who had bitten his bum was actually standing beside Ling Han! What did this signify? This signified that everything was the fault of the Ding Clan!

How incredibly audacious! They actually dared to toy around with him and toy around with the Han Clan!

“Eat my attack!” Han Lu roared as he charged toward Ding Yaolong. His eyes were red with rage.

He was genuinely enraged at this moment.

How many years had he been renowned for? Yet, he had actually been bitten in the bum by the large black dog. Not only that, but his bum had even been exposed to so many people. This was utter humiliation!

Although Ding Yaolong was feeling baffled and incredibly wronged, he had no option but to block and engage in combat now that Han Lu was charging over and attacking as if his life depended on it. Meanwhile, the elites from the Long Clan and the Duan Clan continued to persuade them to stop. The scene was as chaotic as could be.

Mao Dai wore a strange expression as he watched on from afar.

This was because he was at least 80% sure that this had all been planned by Ling Han. However, regardless of how hard he wracked his brain, he still couldn’t figure out the cause and effect of everything. How had Ling Han redirected Han Lu’s hatred toward the Ding Clan?

Hang on... Why had Ling Han insisted on joining the Ding Clan? Was this the critical point?

Mao Dai suddenly came to a realization. The Han Clan had already looked for trouble with the Ding Clan several times. According to rumors, this was because the physical body of a member of the Han Clan had been destroyed while he was adventuring and training in the Ancient Realm. Moreover, the culprit was supposedly a member of the Ding Clan.

What if the culprit was Ling Han? If that were the case, then everything made perfect sense.

Of course, there were still several more specific problems to this theory. For example, how had Ling Han entered the Ancient Realm? One had to realize that only those at the Dividing Soul Tier and above could send people into the Ancient Realm.

Han Lu attacked wildly, yet he was ultimately unable to rival three opponents at the same cultivation level. The battle stopped once again. However, Han Lu was like a wounded beast who wanted to bite anyone he saw.

“Grand Elder!” Ding Song and Ding Shan called as they flew over. The battle had been far too intense just then, so they hadn’t dared to venture too close.

“What’s the matter?” Ding Yaolong asked coldly.

“Everything is because of that evil brat!” the two elites said as they pointed at Ling Han. In the beginning, they hadn’t realized this, either. However, upon seeing Ling Han and the large black dog standing together, they finally gained a rough idea of the current situation.

If the large black dog hadn’t attracted Han Lu over, would all of this have happened? Thinking about this carefully, Ling Han’s insistence on joining the Ding Clan was a comprehensive scheme from the very beginning.

“What?!” Ding Yaolong couldn’t help but exclaim in astonishment. The culprit behind everything was actually a measly Genesis Tier cultivator?

Han Lu was also puzzled upon hearing this. Ding Yaolong’s expression of astonishment wasn’t fake.

Moreover, how could a fourth severance grand elder be astonished so easily?

The four Severing Mundane Tier elites instantly turned their gazes toward Ling Han.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and said, “Han Lu, Ding Yaolong, congratulations on becoming the biggest fools in history.”
