Chapter 3263 - 3263: Big Dog

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han sensed an extremely powerful aura, very vaguely. It should be an Extreme Bone Tier, he thought to himself.

“Wait here first,” he said in a low voice.

The best thing about Huan Xue was that she would not ask further and only nodded obediently.

Ling Han spread out his body, and walked up the mountain. His footsteps were light, and he practically didn’t make the slightest sound. Not long after, he arrived at the top of the mountain.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

A loud snore could be heard. It sounded like thunder.

Ling Han’s footsteps became even slower. He knew that the Extreme Bone Tier was too powerful. Even though the other party was sleeping so soundly right now, he would immediately wake up if there was the slightest movement.

He stuck his head out to take a look, and couldn’t help but be surprised, because the existence that was snoring was actually a dog.

The fat dog’s entire body was almost round, and its fur was so black that it glowed, as if it had been smeared with oil.

This dog was very big, but it had not reached the size of a giant. At most, it was probably about the size of a buffalo.

Right now, it was sleeping soundly. Its tongue was sticking out, and as it breathed, there was actually a bubble from its nostrils that was continuously enlarging and shrinking, and one couldn’t help but wonder when this bubble would explode.

Could such a fat dog be an existence that was at least in the Extreme Bone Tier? If this was a female dog, could he let the large black dog seduce it?

This thought flashed through Ling Han’s mind, but he immediately broke into laughter. Even if the large black dog could be released, even if it was really a female dog, with the large black dog’s despicable attributes, which female dog would take a fancy to it? ‘Never mind.’

He surveyed again. ‘Hm?’

He found a tree beside this fat dog. This tree was very short, only half the height of a human, but it was growing very well. Its crown had grown into a hemispherical shape.

Most importantly, all the leaves on it were actually uniquely different.

Some were sword-like, some were shaped like knives, and some were shaped like spears. There were all kinds of them. In fact, when the wind blew, these leaves even let out clanging sounds, as if weapons were really colliding with each other.

Instinctively, Ling Han believed that it was a treasure tree, which was why there was a powerful demon dog guarding it.

The warning sign written below clearly indicated that the Imperial Capital Academy knew of the existence of this fat dog. Of course, it was impossible for them to miss this strange treasure tree.

Perhaps this demon dog was raised by the academy.

…Although the relationship between Demonic Beasts and humans was not very good, it was still possible for human elites to subdue Demonic Beasts as battle pets and use them to guard their homes.

The problem was that the guard dog was lying there, so how could he get closer?

Ling Han did not think that he could silently approach an Extreme Bone Tier demon dog without being discovered, even if the other party was still sleeping soundly.

‘I’ve got it.’

He returned and explained the plan to the little handmaiden.

“Young Master, isn’t this too dangerous?” Huan Xue’s face turned pale. That was an Extreme Bone Tier beast, and with just a single bite, Young Master could be killed.

“Don’t worry,” Ling Han reassured her.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Meanwhile, the little pink pig grinned coldly. It actually hoped that Ling Han would be eaten by a Demonic Beast.

Before it could gloat for too long, it felt a weight on its neck, and Ling Han had already picked it up.

“You’re coming with me.”

“Coo—” The lecherous pig let out a scream and naturally refused.

Ling Han ignored it. He first hid the Essence Nurturing Gourd in a hidden place, and then carried out a test. When he had run to a nearby spot, he communicated with the gourd mentally. Xiu, his body immediately disappeared from the spot.

If anyone saw this, they would definitely cry out in shock.

In reality, Ling Han had entered the inner space of the Essence Nurturing Gourd.

“Perverted pig, cooperate a little, or else I’ll leave you outside to be eaten by the dog,” Ling Han said to the perverted pig as he left the gourd.

It had not entered the gourd with him.

The lecherous pig nodded unwillingly. It wasn’t that it was afraid of being eaten by Demonic Beasts, but that it would be snatched away by the Demonic Beast. Where could it then find a beautiful sister?

“Done.”

Ling Han nodded. He had brought the lecherous pig along as a precaution. This could intimidate Demonic Beasts, although he didn’t know if it would be effective against large beasts in Extreme Bone Tier.

After making arrangements for Huan Xue, Ling Han prepared to take action.

His plan was very simple. That was to use his body as bait to attract that demon dog to chase after him, and Huan Xue would take the opportunity to pluck the leaves. Meanwhile, Ling Han would run to the vicinity of the Essence Nurturing Gourd and directly escape into it.

If the fat dog caught up to him in advance, he would threaten him with the lecherous pig. He hoped that this fat pig could show its might.

Xiu, he threw a rock and it hit the ground heavily, causing a loud sound.

The fat dog did not move at all. If not for the bubble at its nose, people would have suspected that it was dead.

“It’s fine if a pig is so lazy. After all, it’s a pig, but why would a dog be so lazy?” Ling Han muttered.

The lecherous pig was indignant and bared its fangs and brandished its claws at him. ‘You’re not allowed to look down on pigs like this!’

Again.

Ling Han threw another rock, and this time, he aimed directly at the demon hound.

Pa, the rock smashed over, but just as it touched the demon dog, it exploded into pieces.

Amazing!

Ling Han was shocked. The vital energy and blood of Blood Transformation Tier cultivators soared into the sky, almost tangible. This Extreme Bone Tier cultivator was even more impressive. The aura that seeped out of his body was already so terrifying that even rocks could be shattered. No wonder this demon dog was sleeping so soundly.

Could he just simply walk over and pick leaves?

Ling Han considered this alluring idea, and his feet couldn’t help but move, quietly approaching that big fat dog.

Great, this guy didn’t react at all.

Huan Xue was surprised as she watched from afar. This was different from the plan they had agreed on.

Ling Han was already less than three meters away from the fat dog, but the fat dog was still sleeping soundly, snoring like thunder.

‘Good. Keep it up, good dog.’

Ling Han walked to the side of the tree and observed carefully.

In an instant, he could determine that there were a total of 999 leaves on this tree, and every leaf was in the shape of a weapon. Some may be similarly sword-shaped, but there was also a variety such as short swords, long swords, curved swords, hook swords, and so on.

Ling Han had a misconception. Why did it seem like these leaves really would be able to grow into weapons?

What a curious tree.

Just as he was about to reach out and pluck a leaf to study, he suddenly realized that something was wrong.

‘Eh, where’s the snoring?’

He turned around abruptly, but was aghast because the fat dog had stood up at some point and was staring at him. When he turned around, it opened its mouth and stuck out a long tongue, drooling.

F*ck, how embarrassing.

Ling Han chuckled, and then suddenly attacked.

“Coo—” The lecherous pig let out a miserable cry, because it had been forcefully stuffed into the big dog’s mouth by Ling Han.

Then, Ling Han broke into a run. He activated his Shuttle Steps, and in an instant, he erupted with terrifying speed. Peng, a sonic boom exploded, forming a terrifying shockwave that caused the dog’s fur to flutter wildly.

The fat dog was stunned. This sort of change had also greatly exceeded its expectations. However, it immediately turned around and chased after Ling

Han.

“Coo!” The lecherous pig screamed.. It was still in the dog’s mouth!
