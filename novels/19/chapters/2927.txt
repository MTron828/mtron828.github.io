2928 Who Can Stop Me?

“Ling Han, as one of the greatest prodigies of all time, why are you bullying someone weaker?” A voice resounded, and in that instant everyone was on edge.

It was the Mystic Snake Heavenly Venerate, a Fifth Tier!

Ling Han narrowed his eyes at the middle-aged man slowly approaching with a smile as the crowd dispersed. The massive image of a snake over several hundred meters long hovered behind him. The sight of it was terrifying.

Boom!

!!

Without saying another word, Ling Han struck out with his fist, condensing his energy into a massive fist that hurtled towards the Mystic Snake Heavenly Venerate.

The Mystic Snake Heavenly Venerate was furious as he thought, ‘This is too much. How could you just attack without warning? Have you no dignity?

‘We both possess a Fifth Tier’s combat prowess and are almost at its peak, yet we’re still having to fight like we’re street thugs?’

Despite what he thought, he still had to meet Ling Han’s blow. As one of the nine strongest individuals of the alliance, he of all people could not back down.

Peng!

He managed to parry Ling Han’s punch, but quickly lost balance and fell back over 10 steps.

Everyone from the World Alliance was stunned by the turn of events.

The Mystic Snake Heavenly Venerate was a middle-stage Fifth Tier, and with neither side using any Heavenly Venerable Seals or secret techniques, and only fighting with their original strength, he had actually been pushed back. It was clear that Ling Han possessed abnormal strength for a Third Tier.

“You’ve gone too far!” the Mystic Snake Heavenly Venerate barked. Activating his Heavenly Venerable Seal, his power instantly surged by 40 times. Boom! His aura became even more formidable as the giant snake image behind him started to take on an almost physical appearance as though it was coming to life.

He charged out towards Ling Han, and punched with his right fist. Boom! The giant snake image also rushed forth viciously to bite down on Ling Han.

Weng! A seal was also shining on the giant snake, giving it an astonishing aura.

This was a secret technique, and it was where the Mystic Snake Heavenly Venerate got his name.

Ling Han was unperturbed. All secret techniques were just different applications of the same power. If one’s power was great enough, they could overcome anything.

Simple, direct, and overbearing.

Ling Han punched back in retaliation, activating his own Heavenly Venerable Seal simultaneously.

Peng!

As their fists collided, the Mystic Snake Heavenly Venerate spat out fresh blood, and was sent flying.

“A first-grade seal!” he yelled. His battle prowess wasn’t low, but the difference in their Heavenly Venerable Seals was too great.

Xiu! Ling Han rushed forth in pursuit of the Mystic Snake Heavenly Venerate. He was planning on completely putting down every single person from the World Alliance.

Peng, peng, peng! Ling Han launched successive punches, completely suppressing the Mystic Snake Heavenly Venerate. Soon, the latter was covered in injuries.

Everyone was completely flabbergasted. Initially, they had a lot of confidence in Feng Wuding. However, if even a Fifth Tier was suffering like this, was there anyone else who could stop Ling Han?

“Stop!” A deep voice resounded, and soon eight figures appeared.

These were the other eight Fifth Tiers from the World Alliance stationed here. When they say how badly the Mystic Snake Heavenly Venerate was getting beaten, they had to step in. Otherwise, the World Alliance was going to become a laughingstock.

The Mystic Snake Heavenly Venerate was relieved. If the nine of them were to join forces, they were sure to be able to take Ling Han down.

However, Ling Han pretended not to hear anything, and continued to pummel him. Peng, peng, peng! The Mystic Snake Heavenly Venerate continued to suffer massive injuries to the point where he couldn’t help but cry out in pain. It was utterly embarrassing.

“Ling Han, you’ve gone too far!” The other eight Fifth Tiers were furious and struck out simultaneously.

All those who could become Heavenly Venerates were prodigies in their own right. Moreover, reaching the Fifth Tier was not something anyone could do even if they had several epochs’ worth of time.

With nine such powerful individuals joining forces, even any Fifth Tier would probably feel frightened.

However, Ling Han was not worried. So what if there were nine of them?

He quickly activated a dimensional projection to suppress them.

After so many years, he had not only managed to develop all 13 dimensions, even his physique had improved further now because of his reaching late-stage Third Tier, and he was able to contain up to 19 different dimensions. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

He was confident he could take the Mystic Snake Heavenly Venerate and the rest by surprise and make them suffer if he were to release all 19 dimensions from the start. However, it was better not to reveal all his cards too early. It was more than enough to activate a single dimensional projection.

Even if it was just a projection, it was more than terrifying enough. The Mystic Snake Heavenly Venerate and the rest were all groaning, and looked to be in pain.

“Dimension suppression!”

“Destroy it!”

All nine Heavenly Venerates shouted as they joined forces. Peng, peng, peng! As they bombarded the projection with attacks, cracks quickly appeared on its surface, and it was ultimately destroyed.

However, Ling Han took advantage of the opening and launched another attack. Upon supplementing his Fists of Fury with the first-grade seal, his attack was nigh unstoppable. With a single punch, he sent one of the Fifth Tiers flying.

In the time it took for the dimensional projection to be destroyed, Ling Han had already sent five Heavenly Venerates flying.

Gasp!

Everyone from the World Alliance was flabbergasted. It was no wonder Ling Han was able to come and go as he pleased within Hysteria’s army base. His abilities were too powerful. Who among the Fifth Tier was able to stop him?

Could Feng Wuding do it?

They were all confident at first, but now they were beginning to doubt it.

Pa, pa, pa! The sound of clapping hands echoed as a golden-haired man walked over. Like an emperor, there was a boundless aura about him, giving him a presence that would make others prostrate themselves before him.

It was Feng Wuding, the strongest prodigy from the Genesis World of the last era.

“You’ve got some skills,” said Feng Wuding. With an indifferent expression, he continued, “Ling Han, you’ve finally come to challenge me!”

Challenge?

Bullsh*t, he was here to deliver a beating.

With the support of a first-grade seal, Ling Han’s battle prowess was terrifying. As indifferent as he might seem, not even Feng Wuding was able to stand idle against it.

He said angrily, “Don’t assume you’re the only one with a first-grade seal!”

An ancient and powerful aura began to circulate Feng Wuding as he activated his own first-grade seal, increasing his power by 80 times. He met Ling Han head-on, completely unafraid.

...

There was no arguing that Feng Wuding was an extraordinary existence in his own right.

A few hundred million years ago, he was still a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. Now, he had not only reached the Third Tier, but was at its peak, surpassing Ling Han in terms of cultivation level. Not to mention, he had the support of a first-grade seal. However, his battle prowess was still just roughly the same as Ling Han’s.

“What?!” Feng Wuding couldn’t accept what happened.

His cultivation level was slightly higher, but his power still ended up in a draw against Ling Han’s?

Impossible! Impossible!

He was the strongest prodigy in the Genesis World of the last era, and enjoyed the benefits entitled to that position all to himself. There was none who could compare to him. Yet, how was he unable to best Ling Han?

Even people like Lin Youlian and Xin Qihu could only overcome an opponent who was a single cultivation level higher than themselves, and they were called the greatest prodigies of all eternity. However, compared to him, they were just average prodigies.

How was Ling Han able to be this strong?

Could it be that he extracted too many Powers of Dimension, enabling him to gain the upper hand in strength?

This was not impossible. Normally, extracting the Power of Dimension from roughly 100 dimensions was enough for one to fight against a prodigy who had created a dimension within their body, even if they hadn’t reached the Third Tier. If they extracted upwards of 1,000 dimensions, they could even put up a fight against a Fifth Tier.

‘That must be the case.’
