Chapter 1125: Resisting

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Empress Luan Xing clearly knew this as well. She remained silent, yet a primitive and ancient aura radiated from her body. It was as if she were going to shatter the Notionless Saint’s seal and recover her powerful cultivation.

Several shadows of large snakes appeared behind her back, each of them larger than a mountain. No, they were even larger than heavenly bodies. It was as if they could open their jaws and swallow entire stars.

“Nine Snake! You’re actually from the Nine Snake Tribe!” the Notionless Saint suddenly shouted. There was surprise and excitement in his voice. “Hahaha! No wonder your aura felt so familiar. You’re actually from the fabled Nine Snake Tribe!

“Having this kind of bloodline, and with my teachings, my disciple will definitely become the number one elite in the world!”

‘Nine Snake Tribe?’

Ling Han felt extremely vexed. Judging by the Notionless Saint’s excitement, this Nine Snake Tribe was probably extremely powerful. However, he had never heard of this tribe before.

Empress Luan Xing was unmoved by his words. She simply continued to attack the restrictions on her body.

“Don’t waste your strength, young lady. Although you possess the bloodline of the Nine Snake Tribe, you’re still only at the Heavenly Body Tier. However, I’m already at the Genesis Tier! Those at the Genesis Tier are Saints, and the gulf between you and me is simply too large to overcome. I can suppress the sky with a single thought, so how can you dream of ever undoing my restrictions?”

Empress Luan Xing wasn’t willing to give up. She was a ruler, after all, so how could she go down without putting up a fight?

The Notionless Saint purposefully provoked Ling Han, saying, “Brat, what are standing there in a daze for? Hurry up and do her! You’re not attracted even though she’s such a beautiful woman? Are you a eunuch?”

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “Why is the eunuch worrying when the emperor is not 1 ?”

“F*ck!” The Notionless Saint was slightly ticked off. He was a mighty Saint, and if it weren’t for the fact that he only had a wisp of his soul left, and if it weren’t for the fact that he needed Ling Han to copulate with Empress Luan Xing, would he really swallow such abuse?

Ling Han looked at Empress Luan Xing, and said, “Don’t worry. Although I don’t dare to say that I only love one woman, I’m not someone who’ll get into a relationship with any woman that I come across.”

Empress Luan Xing felt slightly embarrassed and irritated. She had always enjoyed a much higher position than others, so when had she ever needed others to show sympathy or be charitable toward her? If her cultivation level hadn’t been suppressed, she would’ve been able to slice Ling Han into pieces with a casual strike.

However, there was nothing she could do about the current situation. She couldn’t free herself from the Notionless Saint’s restrictions, so she was truly at the mercy of Ling Han. If Ling Han forced himself onto her, all she could do was attempt to drag him down with her.

“Brat, you talk quite tough. However, how long can you last? Anyhow, I’m not in a hurry. I can simply spend tens or even hundreds of years waiting for you two,” the Notionless Saint said.

He stopped speaking after this, and it was as if he were truly going to ignore Ling Han and Empress Luan Xing.

One day, two days, three days... Time trickled by, and the only people in the ninth level were Ling Han and Empress Luan Xing—a lone man and a lone woman.

Ling Han had never thought that he was a good example of a moral person. However, as a man, there were things that he would do, and things that he wouldn’t do. No matter how attractive Empress Luan Xing was, he definitely wouldn’t force himself onto a “weak woman”.

This was a question of principles, and there was a bottom line that he would never traverse.

He simply cultivated every day. There was a Demonic Power Source in his body, and the life essence in this tomb was also extremely rich. Thus, the speed of his cultivation was definitely not slow.

It was a shame that he couldn’t enter the Black Tower. Otherwise, the speed of his improvement would be even quicker if he were able to comprehend dao under the Reincarnation Tree.

Even so, he was still able to stride ahead in leaps and bounds. The speed of his cultivation would definitely shock others.

10 days, 20 days, one month...

Ling Han and Empress Luan Xing both kept to themselves. Although they were in the same room, they pretty much hadn’t spoken a single word to each other.

‘Oh, my proud empress!’ Ling Han exclaimed in his mind.

How much self-control did he need not to lay his hands on her?

“Sh*tty senior! Sh*tty senior!” Ling Han shouted.

“Sh*tty brat, what did you call me?” the Notionless Saint said in an angry voice.

“You’re acting improperly even though you’re an old man. So, you’re naturally a sh*tty senior.” Ling Han smiled, and continued, “Say, sh*tty senior, where are the others?”

“Concentrate on being a good bridegroom,” the Notionless Saint said with a humph. “Why do you care about the others anyway?”

It was clear that he was extremely displeased. If it weren’t for the fact that he only had a wisp of his soul remaining, perhaps even he would be attracted to the Nine Snake woman.

“It looks like I won’t be able to leave any time soon. Help me tell my friends that they can leave first and not worry about me,” Ling Han said.

“Why do I have to act as your messenger?” the Notionless Saint said in displeasure. He had been a Saint before, yet he actually had to deliver a message for a junior now? This was way beneath him.

Ling Han laughed loudly, and said, “You’re the one who needs my help right now. Isn’t it only natural that you also help me do some trivial things? Anyhow, this is a matter between you and me, so why drag other unrelated people into the matter?”

“Sh*tty brat!” the Notionless Saint mumbled. “Fine, I’ll pass your message to that woman. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Who would’ve thought... You’re actually quite the loyal husband!”

Ling Han didn’t think that he was very loyal. He hadn’t forced himself onto Empress Luan Xing, because he simply would never force himself onto others. Moreover, what would he do in the future if he actually did force himself onto her?

Was Empress Luan Xing the kind of woman who would become weak and obedient after being raped by someone?

No way!

At that time, only one of them would be able to survive—although Empress Luan Xing wanted to kill him now, this wasn’t a conflict that couldn’t be resolved. However, if he ended up forcing himself onto her, their conflict would genuinely become one that would only conclude with the death of one of them.

The waiting game continued.

Another two months passed, and Ling Han reached the peak stage of the high extreme. His breaking through to the next cultivation level was imminent. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

This was the opportunity that he had been waiting for—summoning heavenly tribulation!

Heaven was boundless and earth was vast. Among them, heavenly tribulation was the greatest.

Heavenly tribulation wouldn’t affect unrelated people, yet this sealed-off space would definitely be shattered open. At that time, Ling Han would be able to find an opportunity to escape.

Anyhow, he hadn’t been able to comprehend dao under the Reincarnation Tree, so it had taken him the best part of a year to finally complete this final step.

Rumble...

Even Saints at the Genesis Tier couldn’t obstruct the overwhelming might of the heavenly tribulation. Thunderclouds materialized in the sky and started to deal their brutal punishment.

“Huh?” The Notionless Saint looked up in surprise, and said, “Sh*tty brat, what divine pill have you taken? Not even a year has passed, yet you’ve already gone from the late stage of the high extreme to the peak stage. In fact, you’re already ready to advance to the consummate level?”

Advancing from the late stage of the high extreme to the peak stage of the high extreme in under a year wasn’t too astonishing. After all, this could be achieved as long as one had enough natural treasures. However, was the Heavenly Dao something that could be comprehended so easily?

The Notionless Saint didn’t know about the Demonic Power Source in Ling Han’s body. Although there was only a shred of it remaining, it was still more than enough to help Ling Han break through to the peak stage of the Mountain River Tier.

“Haha, so that’s what you’re planning? You want to borrow the might of the heavenly tribulation to shatter this sealed-off space that I created?” The Notionless Saint chuckled giddily, and said, “Brat, you sure have underestimated me!”

Boom!

A bolt of lightning streaked toward Ling Han.

Ling Han prepared to deal with the heavenly tribulation. There was no other thought running through his mind at this moment, and he actively shattered the Godly bones in his body. He was going to accept the baptism of the heavenly tribulation.

“Hmm?” Empress Luan Xing retreated to the side to watch. Although divine lightning continued to thunder down, one wouldn’t be swept up in the heavenly tribulation as long as they didn’t actively launch an attack toward it. Of course, the heavenly tribulation would still extend its attacks toward her if Ling Han attacked her and she struck back.

‘Ling Han’s physique has clearly reached a toughness of Level Four Godly metal already, so how were his Godly bones shattered by the divine lightning so easily?’
