Chapter 2146: Alive

They were really seeing things!

Everyone showed an alert expression, and took a few steps back as they looked towards that corpse whose foot had been wounded. It was precisely this corpse that had released that unusual groan.

Teng, this corpse suddenly stood upright, its knees straight, looking incredibly bizarre.

This corpse said nothing, and immediately directed a bite at Yulan Fenghua.

Yulan Fenghua was just about to move when his face paled in shock. He hurriedly retreated because the other party was far stronger than himself.

“Humph!” Ai Kaifeng smirked coldly, and moved to parry the attack.

Peng!

This blow from him was too terrifying. The corpse was immediately sent flying from the force.?Peng, peng, peng,?it crashed through at least several hundred giant trees on its course, and only then did it finally stop. However, it had not sustained any injuries at all. Immediately, it charged back with a bounce like a sharp arrow.

“Yi!” This time, it was Ai Kaifeng that was looking surprised.

This corpse should have been only a First Secret king tier when it had been alive, and now that it was dead, its battle prowess would have become weaker. And he was a First Secret mystical power, and should logically have been able to destroy this corpse with a single blow.

Yet that was not what had happened. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

He had sent this corpse flying. It was completely no match for him, but its physique was astonishingly strong, and actually stayed undamaged!

Strange, very strange. There was something strange about everything in this place. It was obvious that they had been dead for only 200 years at most, yet the decomposition of the corpses had reached an extent as if they had been dead for several billion years. And now, though the person was dead, the strength of his physique was off the charts. The extent of strangeness could not be described.

That corpse charged towards them, its hands spread open. Its fingernails were long and sharp, and it turned and clawed out at Ai Kaifeng.

“Ignorance!” Ai Kaifeng smirked coldly. His strength was superior to the other by who knew how many times over, and it actually dared to attack him.

Peng, peng, peng.?Ai Kaifeng moved aggressively, and every blow sent that corpse flying and bouncing as if it was just a sandbag that was being beaten. But what incited fear was the fact that no matter how Ai Kaifeng attacked it, this corpse was still undamaged, as if it had been refined into Divine Metal.

Ling Han and the others were all wondering. Could it be that this person had focused on cultivating his physique when he had been alive? Otherwise, he had only been dead for a mere 200 years at most, so he couldn’t have turned into a zombie so fast, right?

But that was not definite, because this corpse seemed to have decomposed for several hundred billion years, so any kind of strange change would have been logical.

“It should be linked to the poison,” Ling Han deduced.

This poison could cause one to lose his reason, and commit mindless slaughter, but perhaps it could also have a great effect on the corpse after death, such that it would become indestructible.

“Can we capture him, and study him carefully?” Lin Xuan suggested.

Though they still held another victim of the poison captive, Bie Ziwen clearly could not be dissected for study, so they could only take this corpse for examination.

“Easy!” Ai Kaifeng declared proudly. The gap in battle prowess between both sides was like a gulf. It was one matter for him to be incapable of killing the other party, but it would be incredibly easy to capture it.

His hands danced, and multiple streaks of light flowed out from the tips of his fingers. Celestial light diffused, and an indescribable might exuded.

He had used a celestial technique, so his battle prowess was immediately different.

He aggressively suppressed it, and that corpse very soon lay subdued on the ground. It could only chaotically struggle with its arms, yet could not stand up at all.

“Ah!” Di Tongxin suddenly grabbed her head, her eyes shedding tears of blood.

“What’s wrong?” everyone hurriedly asked in shock.

“I used my divine sense to enter into this corpse, yet did not expect that there is an indescribable darkness lying within. The evil power has directly eradicated that sliver of my divine sense!” Di Tongxin’s pretty face was shockingly pale, and she looked endearingly pitiful.

So powerful?

Everyone was stunned. The battle prowess of this corpse was not all that strong, or it would not have been so easily subdued by Ai Kaifeng, but it was actually capable of eradicating a sliver of Di Tongxin’s divine sense? How was this to be believed?

But would Di Tongxin joke about this kind of matter?

“Strange!” everyone declared, but also became even more cautious. They did not dare to enter this corpse using their divine sense any longer, preferring to avoid suffering the same consequences that Di Tongxin had suffered.

Monarch tiers like them were destined to reach the highest cultivation level of the Celestial Path, so their spirit definitely had to be complete. Even if the slightest sliver was lost, it would still have a powerful influence on their future cultivation levels.

They wanted to cut open this corpse, but the battle previously had already proven that this corpse’s physique was incredibly tough, and it could not be damaged through brute force or Regulations. It was practically comparable to a Celestial Tool, so how were they supposed to deal with it?

But there had to be some kind of massive secret hidden behind this corpse. If the secret that could strengthen the physique to the extent of Divine Metal could be uncovered, just what kind of height could that boost their own battle prowess to?

When they thought about this, everyone’s breathing became slightly heavy.

Only Ling Han was completely unconcerned. He had cultivated the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, and the toughness of his physique was something that even a reincarnated Ninth Heaven Celestial King like Ji Wuming had to admit his inferiority in the face of. Naturally, he would not be envious of this kind of inhuman creature.

What he was curious about was whether this “corpse” was really dead or otherwise.

Ling Han drew out the Divine Demon Sword, boosted it with the Regulation of Slaughter and Metal, and then sliced at the corpse.

Zi, sparks erupted from the corpse, and it released a shrill, uncomfortable screech of friction, causing everyone to frown.

“What are you doing?” Ai Kaifeng immediately rebuked. At first, he was already very irritated, and Ling Han actually caused such an annoying noise. Was he looking for death?

Ling Han merely slanted a sideways glance at him, but did not speak. He disdained from giving any regard to this kind of idiot, who had much too high an opinion of himself, and was completely self-centered, thinking that everyone should listen to him.

‘Just go to hell.’

Seeing that Ling Han had actually ignored him, Ai Kaifeng immediately flew into a rage. They had just entered the Mystery Realm, and one of their companions had gone mad, so they could only subdue him forcefully. And now, they had encountered this kind of mystifying, bizarre happening, causing him to become easily angered and hot-tempered.

“Do you think I do not dare to touch you?” Ai Kaifeng threatened sinisterly. His strength was completely superior to Ling Han’s, and in terms of background, the Imperial Void Sect was also a Ninth Heaven Celestial King-level force, and the Sealed Emotion Palace that backed them was a Heavenly Venerable Tier-level force that had even surpassed Ninth Heaven Celestial King Tier!

Thus, he could be completely unreserved in his actions as long as he was just a little bit in the right.

“Hehe.” Ling Han only chuckled. He had used the Source Power of Slaughter, and four leaves fluttered lightly. They were obviously extremely fragile, seeming as if they could be blown over by just a breeze, yet could burst out with destructive power that was capable of slicing apart the dome of heaven.

He once more delivered a slash towards the corpse. He was sure that there would be extraordinary effects from this now because his own physique was the same. A direct attack would be completely ineffective, and one could only use the power of Regulation to slowly kill him.

“You’re looking for death!” Ai Kaifeng roared in fury. Not only did this brat completely ignore him, he even actually dared to disobey him, and still planned to mess around with that corpse. Wasn’t this just deliberately opposing him?

Even if he couldn’t kill Ling Han, he was determined to teach this guy a harsh lesson.

Boom, he moved aggressively, and shot out a punch. Like a God of Fire displaying his might, flames filled the skies.

Though An Ran was internally extremely displeased, since she had promised her respected master that she would take care of Ling Han, she could only suppress her own displeasure at this time. With a leap, she stood in front of Ling Han, and then stretched out her hand to parry the blow.

Peng!

Energy surged out madly, and the Regulations of the Great Dao clashed, bursting out with soaring flames and light. An Ran was completely unmoved, but Ai Kaifeng took a consecutive seven steps back as a streak of blood gushed from the palm of his hand.

“Holy Daughter An Ran, what is the meaning of this?” Ai Kaifeng demanded in displeasure, and felt a sliver of wariness as well. Though he was a monarch tier himself, An Ran was a monarch among monarchs, and possessed the strength to suppress him.
