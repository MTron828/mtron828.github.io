Chapter 1995: Gaining Yang Soul Stones

So strange.

With Hu Niu’s strength, at least a few thousand or tens of thousands of fish would have to die from this strike, but now, to say nothing of a single one dying, not even one had been wounded.

Ling Han replayed the previous scene in his mind, every single detail appearing to his mind’s eye. Involuntarily, a hint of surprise appeared in his expression because when this punch from Hu Niu landed, the whole surface of the ocean was bearing her strength, and it rapidly spread in all directions and toward the deepest depths of the ocean bed.

Hence, even if Hu Niu was a peak-stage fifth severance monarch tier, her punch had only created a water hole of 300 meters in diameter and about 90-odd meters in depth, but did not kill even a single fish.

Water was the gentlest.

Ling Han’s mind couldn’t help but wander. If water had this kind of unique trait, then could Regulations of Water be used in this manner as well?

“Waaaah, where’s Niu’s fish? Niu wants to eat fish!” Hu Niu howled in anger. In her eyes, breaking through to Yang Soul Tier could be done easily, but food was the most important thing. She wanted to eat every day and at all times.

“Let’s search again,” Ling Han said with a chuckle.

They continued their advance, and after only a while, another school of fish appeared ahead of them.

Using two fingers like he would a sword, xiu, Ling Han shot out a flash of sword light.

This strike seemed to be very casual, yet had drawn upon the sword intent of the Heaven Destroying Nine Swords, and had the Regulation of Slaughter as its base, so its destructive power was incredibly terrifying.

Weng, the sword light reached its target, but only created a boundless ripple on the ocean’s surface.

As for fish, still not one had died.

Hmm? Even the sharpness of Sword Qi was incapable of slicing into the great ocean?

“Looks like we would have to enter into the ocean to be able to kill these marine creatures,” Ling Han said. If they made a move on the surface of the ocean, the destructive power would be absorbed by the ocean. This whole ocean itself was like a shield.

The three women nodded. Everyone stepped through the water’s surface and entered into the ocean waters.

They continued their advance, and not long after, a massive school of fish appeared ahead of them again. Every fish was a myriad of colors and extremely beautiful.

The four of them moved at the same time, charging towards the school of fish.

This time, the ocean waters would no longer provide protection for the school of fish. Under the combined forces of four great elites, the school of fish was soon annihilated.

“Eat grilled fish! Eat grilled fish!” Hu Niu said happily.

It was rare that anyone could refuse her requests. Ling Han smiled, entered into the Black Tower with the three women, and began the barbeque.

To say nothing of Hu Niu, Ling Han was actually also a foodie himself. When he saw something new, he would definitely not be thinking of studying it, but would rather want to take a bite and have a taste.

Very soon, an aroma wafted out, and all four of them twitched their noses. Meanwhile, Hu Niu was even drooling while holding a pair of chopsticks in each hand. Clearly, she was going to use both hands, and eat to her heart’s content.

“Come on then.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The four of them began to share the food. They had only taken one bit, and felt like the fish melted directly in their mouth. It was so delicious that it could not be described.

“Delicious, really very delicious.”

“It is indeed very delicious.”

The four of them enjoyed the food very much, and after devouring all the fish, a small stone could be seen at the fish’s head. It was even smaller than a grain of rice.

This was the Yang Soul Stone.

They had eaten at least 100 fishes, but added together, the Yang Soul Stones were even smaller than a peanut.

To encase a divided soul, it would have to be a Yang Soul Stone that was at least the size of a fist. Furthermore, it had to be a single whole, and not an assorted bunch like this.

Though it could still be refined and purified, it itself was only as small as this. After refining, there would probably be nothing left. Even added together, there wouldn’t be much change, either.

Thus, a Yang Soul Stone of this size was only a piece of trash, without the slightest use at all.

“Continue.”

The four of them advanced. Though they had met quite a number of schools of fish, it only satisfied Hu Niu’s palate. The Yang Soul Stones that they had gained were all pitifully small.

In this one month, there was no change to the schools of fish they encountered, and they were all the same.

“Looks like it would be very difficult to get acceptable Yang Soul Stones near the ocean’s surface. We can only go deeper,” Ling Han said.

“Let’s go down, then.”

They swam towards the ocean bed, and after swimming for half a day, a massive octopus appeared in front of them. It was completely green and looked translucent. Every tentacle was as long as 300 meters, and its eight tentacles were spread out as it floated around in the ocean waters.

“This should be a big guy.” Ling Han charged out, and with a wave of his right hand, he sent out a strike of Slaughter.

Unlike the previous schools of fish that could only flee, this big guy immediately raised a tentacle to parry the incoming attack. The moment contact was made with the sword light, its tentacle was sliced off, and green blood immediately gushed out.

But the might of this strike from Ling Han had also been exhausted. The large octopus’s head throbbed, as if it was raging.

Shua, a long tentacle shot over, stimulating the Regulation of Water, its might soaring.

Ling Han laughed, and raised his fist to greet the incoming assault. He similarly stimulated the Regulation of Water. This was one of the three great Regulations that he had the greatest grasp over.

As they clashed, ripples surged out, but this great ocean was incredibly amazing. Every single drop of water could share the attack. Thus, only a slight shock wave surged out.

“Yin Soul Tier.” Ling Han made his judgement. “However, it’s stronger than ordinary Yin Soul Tier. It can extract the Regulation of Water inside this great ocean, and dispel the majority of force from any attack it sustains. Its own battle prowess, however, is not that strong.”

Fighting in this great ocean was equivalent to the large octopus having Ling Han’s physique. Thus, even if its battle prowess was not especially strong, wanting to kill it was still very difficult.

No matter how difficult it was, they still had to kill it.

The three women all moved. Bewitching Maiden Rou was only there minding her own business. How could a fourth severance emperor tier possibly be any match for this octopus?

Realization dawned on Ling Han. No wonder Dividing Soul Tier was so hard to break through to. Only monarch tiers would be able to handle an opponent like this giant octopus, but just how many monarch tiers would there be in any Heaven?

The majority would only be able to kill some tiny fish, and hope that many little drops could make an ocean.

If it was still not enough, that would mean that they had come for nothing. They would have to wait for the next time it opened.

This large octuopus was indeed very hard to kill, but Ling Han, the Empress, and Hu Niu had all cultivated the Regulation of Slaughter, and had grasped the Heaven Destroying Nine Swords. This destructive power was too powerful. The three of them working together had managed to slice the giant octopus into bits.

Hu Niu stowed the giant octopus away happily. This was a delicacy, and Ling Han had found a Yang Soul Stone that was about the size of a fist in the giant octopus’s head. It had a yellowish color.

“It can accomodate a divided soul.” Ling Han nodded, and laid the stone on the palm of his hand. With a slight tremble of his spirit, he instantly felt like his spirit was about to leave his body.

The Yang Soul Stone could be considered as a mind in a different sense of the word.

After countless years, everyone had naturally summed up the rules. The Yang Soul Stone that could successfully accommodate the divided soul had to be about the size of a fist at least. At the same time, it had to be yellowish in color—if this standard could not be met, then more Yang Soul Stones would have to be fused together for refining and purifying.

However, the larger the Yang Soul Stone was, the better. This directly influenced the strength that a cultivator would have in the Dividing Soul Tier. Hence, one had to be very careful, and there was completely no need to rush things and use the first one that could be used.

Ling Han stowed this Yang Soul Stone away. Their team battle prowess was too strong. They were completely capable of obtaining more, bigger, and purer Yang Soul Stones.

They continued downwards. Occasionally, they would encounter a marine creature like the giant octopus, and would only be able to take it down after a tough battle, so it’d provide a single Yang Soul Stone for them.

Ling Han also refined the Yang Soul Stones in a moment of free time. After he had fused 100 yellow Yang Soul Stones, the purified stone suddenly shrank drastically, and its color was inclining more towards green.

The more Yang Soul Stones he fused in, the greener the purified stone would be. When he had fused a total of 200 Yang Soul Stones, the purified stone had become pure green.

Its quality had improved again.
