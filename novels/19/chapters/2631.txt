Chapter 2632: Three Lightning Technique

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

After fighting intensely for three days, Zhang Tianyan died.

He had died a very meaningless death. Even if he had encountered the strongest Eighth Heaven Celestial King and had been outmatched, he would have been able to leave calmly. However, faced with Ling Han, he did not even have the chance to escape. He was forced to trade injury for injury, to the point that he died.

Pa, Ling Han also flopped onto the ground. His injuries in this battle were also very heavy. Previously, he had been battling on a single breath, and now that Zhang Tianyan was dead, he could not hold himself up any longer, either.

The Empress hurriedly delivered Ling Han into the Celestial Guest Residence. It was augmented with the Heaven Deceiving Technique, and even if it was a Ninth Heaven Celestial King that was carefully searching for it, he wouldn’t necessarily discover its presence. Furthermore, even if it was discovered, it was forged from Divine Metal. Breaking into the Celestial Guest Residence was not an easy task.

Ling Han recuperated from his injuries calmly. He had a premonition that he had profited greatly from this great battle. After his injuries were recovered, whether it was battle prowess or cultivation level, they would both increase to a greater level.

Time passed day after day, and new Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings arrived. They discovered the signs of battle that were left behind, but they did not discover the presence of the Celestial Guest Residence. They came and left soon after.

A whole three years later, Ling Han had finally recovered from his injuries completely.

“Not bad, I am close to reaching the late stage of the Fifth Heaven. This kind of battle that forces out my potential completely is indeed the fastest method to improve my cultivation level,” Ling Han murmured.

“Wife, let’s go. We should go and retrieve the third Mystical Power,” Ling Han said to the Empress.

The Empress nodded. The both of them stepped out of the Celestial Guest Residence. As for Bewitching Maiden Rou, she continued to stay inside. There was no way for her to enter into the lava.

Tong!?The couple leaped into the lava. They had both spread out a protective layer of Source Power. If it was an extremely short amount of time, the Source Power shield would still be able to hold up.

They arrived at the spot where ley lines converged, and studied it carefully.

The Empress’s defense was inferior to Ling Han’s, and she had to come out of the lava once in a short while. Only when she recovered to her prime condition would she enter once more.

Ling Han also shared his gains with the Empress. In this way, after about three years, they had finally confirmed all the details of the ley lines, and found the formation eye that was hidden within. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Down!”

They dived further, but they had no plans on leaving immediately this time.

They sat down where the formation eye was, and began to guide the power of the whole volcano so it would surge into their bodies.

Boom!?Fire and lightning wove together, surging madly towards them. However, this time, this power did not hurt them. Instead, it circulated inside their bodies, turning into their own power.

“Crimson Flame Windy Lightning!”

They had obtained the third secret technique. Extremely bright seals of great dao flashed in their mind.

Boom!?The whole volcano was erupting. Lava gushed out, and crimson lightning dazzled the eyes.

Some passed by, and discovered the unusual phenomena. However, they thought that this was a natural event. No matter how hard they thought, they could never have imagined that there were two people that were hiding here.

Close to another 3,000 years passed like that.

The lava of the volcano was no longer flowing. The lightning had also stopped because the power of Regulation inside had already been exhausted.

The crimson lava had coagulated and solidified, becoming red rocks, but they were still giving off steam.

Peng!

The rocks broke apart, and two human figures rushed out of them at practically the same time. It was Ling Han and the Empress

“Hahaha!” Ling Han turned and flopped onto the ground. He stretched out his right hand.?Boom!?Green, red, and black light blazed at the same time before fusing. Then, a streak of lightning intertwined, turning into a small sword, and then took the form of a saber, spear, and so on. Change happened as he willed it.

Not only had Ling Han grasped the Crimson Flame Windy Lightning, he had fused the three secret techniques together, and their might was even stronger now.

“Before I obtain all the Lightning of the Five Elements, this will be called… the Three Lightning Technique!”

“I have already advanced to the middle stage of the Fifth Heaven!” The Empress smiled. For Celestial Kings like them, there was nothing more pleasing than an increase in their cultivation level.

Ling Han nodded. “I am also just a step away from the peak stage.”

He was overjoyed as well. Once he advanced into the Sixth Heaven, he would be able to match a Ninth Heaven Celestial King.

“That last battle against Zhang Tianyan was already so difficult, and this man only had the aptitude of an emperor tier. If it had been a monarch tier, even if I had had the aid of the Divine Demon Sword, I still might not have been able to kill him.

“Previously, I had been too self-satisfied.

“However, even if I encounter a peak-stage Eighth Heaven Celestial King now, there is nothing for me to be afraid of.

“I am still short of two types of secret techniques!”

Both Ling Han and the Empress were filled with anticipation. After fusing the three secret techniques, they were even more aware of how strong this Heavenly Venerate Technique was, and wanted even more to grasp the remaining two secret techniques to form the most complete, flawless Heavenly Venerate Technique.

The two of them advanced hand in hand. Though there was great danger within this Ancient Tomb, they were already unafraid. Their battle prowess was close to reaching the Ninth Heaven, so they indeed had that kind of confidence.

Several days later, they arrived in front of a small lake. From afar, before they had even come close, they could already smell a refreshing fragrance.

“Celestial medicine!” The two of them exchanged a look, and exclaimed at the same time.

However, it was not just they who had discovered that there was a Celestial medicine here. The lake was surrounded by people who were Sixth Heaven Celestial Kings at least as they shone with streaks of peculiar light around them.

“Come, let’s go and take a look.”

They strode forwards.

“Mere Fifth Heaven Celestial Kings actually dare to come here?” A Celestial King discovered the two of them, and involuntarily smirked coldly, looking extremely disdainful. However, the gaze he directed at the Empress was filled with a bit of heat.

“Do not underestimate them. It is impossible for ordinary Fifth Heaven Celestial Kings to come here. Their battle prowess has to reach the Sixth Heaven at least!” someone beside him remarked.

“In other words… monarch stars!” The person from before immediately became serious.

There were pitifully few monarch tiers, and monarch stars were even rarer. Even in the Flaming Frost Realm that had gathered the prodigies of countless dimensions, there was definitely still a limited number of monarch stars.

This kind of prodigy would be qualified to become a Heavenly Venerate. Thus, unless they had committed an act that was wicked beyond redemption, it was impossible that they would be imprisoned in the Celestial King Graveyard. Their number really could be counted on the fingers of two hands.

“If one is not a ferocious dragon, better not cross the?river1. We had best not stand out,” everyone said.

No one was willing to be the first to become an idiot to challenge Ling Han and the Empress. What if their strength was heaven-defyingly powerful?

Ling Han and the Empress soared, standing in midair. In this way, their vision would not be obstructed. They could clearly see that there was a green duckweed growing in the center of the lake. Its leaves were as large as basins, and it had borne a pale golden fruit at this time.

The fruit’s fragrance wafted, spreading throughout the nearest 500 km.

“This is… Greenish Black Flowing Ripple Fruit!” Ling Han looked stunned. “Judging by how the fruit looks, it is already close to ripening. That could possibly happen anytime in the next few years.”

The Empress looked towards him, and he nodded. “It is Celestial medicine of the highest grade. You and I can share it between us, and it would be enough to push us both to the Sixth Heaven.”

“Then we must pluck it,” the Empress said.

A Celestial King dressed in green couldn’t help but say, “Haha, I say, the two of you are really speaking such big words!”

He looked to be an old man in his sixties, his skin tightly wrinkled. He did not look like a Sixth Heaven Celestial King at all.

“Do the two of you know just how many elites are fighting over this Celestial fruit?

“Lord Fu Zhiming! Lord Zuo Yuan! Lord He Yi! And…”

‘Yi!’

Ling Han was taken aback. He Yi? Wasn’t that Gu Heyi then?

They were here?

Haha, this was really traveling far and wide to look for you, only to find you easily.

“Where is He Yi?” Ling Han asked.

“Naturally, he will only appear once the celestial fruit has ripened. By then, all the lords would begin a battle of the strongest, and only the victor will obtain the celestial fruit!” that Celestial King in green replied.

“As for us? We can only absorb some of the fragrance of the celestial fruit at that time, and who knows, there may be a chance that it would loosen the barrier to our cultivation levels.

“As for other delusions, there is no need to even think about it.”
