2999 Wronged

Ling Han stood with his hands clasped behind his back, carrying a faint smile, and said, “You people have all offended me, yet you don’t even know who I am?”

“Stop acting and tell us who you are!” someone shouted harshly. In any case, there was a Third Tier in front of him, so he dared to do this.

Ling Han looked towards him, and casually raised his hand then pressed down.

Peng, that person turned into a mist of blood.

Calm and composed, there was not the slightest bit of anger. In fact, there was not the slightest bit of damage to the walls of the houses around him, but a Second Tier had practically died without emitting even a sound.

What kind of great power was this, and what kind of precise control over power was this?

Everyone was trembling. Though there was a Third Tier in front of them, from the look of things now, he might as well be completely just for show.

However, this person was far too audacious. He had publicly killed someone in their base! No matter who he was, he was definitely going to die!

That Third Tier regained his courage, and asked Ling Han, “Daring to commit murder, yet do you not dare to say who you are?”

However, only he himself knew just how anxious his heart was. His mind was completely ill at ease and unsettled.

Ling Han glanced at the Third Tier Heavenly Venerate. This was naturally the main culprit who had forced Ling Feifan into such a sorry state. However, after a glance, he didn’t pay any more attention to him. Instead, he asked, “You’re all Feng Wuding’s subordinates, right?”

These were all seeds from the Genesis World of the last era, and they could not possibly have had any kind of grudge with Ling Han. Then, there was only one possibility. That was because Feng Wuding hated Ling Han, and they also hated all those who were related to Ling Han.

…Ling Feifan was indeed very wronged.

“Since you know that we are Lord Feng’s men, you still dare to commit violence?” that Third Tier said. Though he was shouting a question, his voice was trembling, and there was nothing left of his domineering bearing.

However, when they spoke of Feng Wuding, everyone straightened their backs a bit. This name seemed to possess a mysterious power, giving them confidence.

Feng Wuding was the strongest prodigy of the Genesis World, the Son of Destiny, and when he was in the Fifth Tier, he already possessed the battle prowess of the Seventh Tier. There was no one in the world that could compare. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ling Han chuckled, and casually delivered a palm strike at that Third Tier. “Tell Feng Wuding to come and see me!”

The palm pressed down, and the Third Tier paled in shock. He hurriedly wanted to flee, but just as he moved, peng, his body had already turned into a mist of blood.

Seeing this scene, everyone was so shocked that their faces turned pale.

As it turned out, this person’s strength had surpassed the Third Tier.

“Run!”

It was unknown who was the first to exclaim this, and everyone started fleeing.

He delivered 21 consecutive palm strikes, and 21 Heavenly Venerates were killed. Only the First Tier Heavenly Venerate was still alive.

That person was so scared that his legs were shaking. He could no longer manage to run, as he felt a coldness fill his whole body.

How was he supposed to escape?

Yet Ling Han stopped. “Aren’t you going back to call Feng Wuding over?”

That First Tier came to his senses, and realized that Ling Han had actually spared him. After a moment of faltering, he hurriedly broke into a run and fled.

He was filled with the wild joy of having escaped death. He ran madly, and arrived at the Feng Alliance.

This was the base camp of the force that was subordinate to Feng Wuding. There were many people here, and practically all the seeds from the Genesis World of the last era were here. Because the last generation and the present generation had a generational gap, a line was naturally drawn between them.

However, there would always be some who would curry favor with those in power. It was not that there were no Heavenly Venerates of the Genesis World here. Because they were certain that Feng Wuding was the Son of Destiny, they had come to curry his favor.

Seeing how pale this First Tier was and how he was stumbling over, a Third Tier couldn’t help but ask smilingly, “Huang Feng, what’s going on? Why are you in such a panic, is the sky collapsing?”

Huang Feng was still slightly dazed, and he mumbled, “Dead, all of them are dead!”

That Third Tier could tell something was off, and his expression immediately darkened, and shouted at Huang Feng, “What’s going on?”

He had imbued the might of a Third Tier into his shout, and this was like a direct strike.

Huang Feng finally shuddered, and came back to his senses. His eyes involuntarily narrowed, and he was just about to speak. However, with a bang, his whole person turned into a shower of blood.

Because they had been too close, and added with the fact that he had not had his guard up, that Third Tier’s whole face was splattered with blood.

He couldn’t help but look shocked. Would a Heavenly Venerate explode for no reason?

That was not possible.

In other words, Huang Feng had been subjected to some kind of technique, and it had activated just now, leading to his death.

The question was, had Huang Feng been severely injured, and only now did he succumb to his injuries, or… had this trick been hidden all this while, right until it suddenly exploded just now?

“What’s going on?” More people ran over. They only saw the scene of Huang Feng’s body exploding, so some people’s eyes immediately turned towards that Third Tier.

…Just now, you were the closest to Huang Feng, so was it you who did it?

For a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate, killing a First Tier Heavenly Venerate was naturally as easy as a father beating his son.

Why would anyone suspect this Third Tier? It was very simple. This Third Tier did not come from the Genesis World of the last era, but rather was a Heavenly Venerate of the present generation who had come to cozy up to their powerful leader.

Thus, in the eyes of the Heavenly Venerates of the Genesis World from the last era, this kind of person was naturally inferior, and it would be difficult for him to win their trust.

‘You are quite courageous, aren’t you? Not only do you dare to commit a crime in the camp, you did it in the territory of the Feng Alliance at that.’

“Yi Long, are you the one who did it?” someone immediately shouted.

That Third Tier, Yi Long was deep in thought, and he was shocked.

That was because he recalled that previously, though Huang Feng’s face was pale, and he was staggering, that should be because he had suffered a massive blow to his spirit, but his body was still fine. He could still remember Huang Feng’s surging life essence.

In other words, someone had planted a technique in Huang Feng’s body, and it had suddenly exploded, taking his life.

Who had done this that even Huang Feng had not sensed it in the slightest?

It was absolutely impossible for a Second Tier to do so, but could a Third Tier do so?

It would be extremely difficult!

He shook his head internally because he himself was a Third Tier. He himself thought that it was easy to kill a First Tier, but to inject some kind of technique into him, and have it explode at the specified time, blasting a First Tier into a shower of blood, was impossible.

He nodded. It had to be a Fourth Tier, at least.

“It really was you!” When everyone saw how Yi Long was nodding his head, they were instantly outraged.

This guy was really bold to actually dare commit a crime here.

Only then did Yi Long finally come to his senses as if he had just woken up from a dream. He had actually, in a moment of confusion, admitted to a task that was completely not his doing.

This was nothing to joke about.

He hurriedly waved his hand, and said, “It wasn’t me. You guys have misunderstood, it wasn’t me!”

But everyone was very xenophobic in the first place, and had never considered Yi Long as one of their own. Previously, they had personally witnessed Yi Long nodding, and now he still wanted to deny it?

‘Do you think we’re all blind?’

“Capture him!” someone immediately shouted.

“Capture him!”

Everyone moved one after another. There was naturally no need to be merciful in capturing a traitor and murderer. They all went all out, beating Yi Long harshly.

Yi Long felt sullen to the point of wanting to throw up blood.
