Chapter 1306 Celestial Qi

Ao Ziyun ******* wanted to lose, and wanted to rush off the platform, yet Ling Han would keep blocking him. THe latter’s strength was much too powerful, and he could effectively block him.

How could he play around with him like that?

Ao Ziyun was almost close to tears. What grudge or enmity did they have between them? ‘I’ll hand over my placement to you, all right?’

“Oh, since you want to go down so much, I am not an unreasonable person, so I’ll send you off.” Ling Han suddenly shot out a foot, and delivered a kick right onto Ao Ziyun’s behind. Peng, this guy instantly fell off the platform.

At first, Ao Ziyun was at a loss, but he finally realized that Ling Han was finally willing to let him off. Involuntarily, he was ecstatic, but after a moment, his expression changed drastically.

There was only six or seven minutes before the time limit of three days.

...Which also meant that without waiting for him to issue another challenge, the time limit for three days would come.

“Ling Han, we are irreconcilable!” he roared furiously, his hatred boosted to the extreme.

“My ears are working very well, so there is no need for you to shout so loudly!” Ling Han waved a hand dismissively. He was naturally not going to take Ao Ziyun’s threat to heart.

Ao Ziyun raised his spear levelly, wanting nothing more than to rush onto the platform and fight another 300 battles with Ling Han. This time, he swore that he would use all his ultimate moves, even the forbidden great move that would reduce his lifespan, on Ling Han. Otherwise, he would definitely be unable to swallow this fury.

However, a mysterious power had imprisoned him, forcing him to be capable of only standing there. He was completely incapable of taking a step at all.

Weng, not long afterwards, a white light appeared from the nine platforms at the same time, enshrouding the platforms completely. This meant that those standing outside were no longer capable of ascending these platforms.

The time limit of three days had reached!

“Ah!” Ao Ziyun roared in fury at the heavens, but it was completely useless.

Boom!

On the platforms, multiple auras descended. They were all milky white in color, and would make one feel relaxed and carefree.

“This is Celestial Qi,” Small Tower suddenly spoke up.

“What!?” Ling Han exclaimed in surprise.

“Though it’s not much in the Celestial Realm, but in the Immortal Realm... you would be able to fill a hole in your Regulations and greatly increase your battle prowess,” Small Tower said.

A thought flashed in Ling Han’s head. If he wanted to break through into the Celestial Realm, he needed to grasp both powers of creating and destroying a world, and whether it was the Immortal Realm or the Netherworld, they were both incomplete in this aspect. Both only possessed a part of the Regulations.

Now, what this Celestial Qi was filling in... was it the Regulations of the Netherworld that he was missing?

If that was the case, then this Celestial Qi was really not the slightest bit valuable to the Celestial Realm, but to beings of the Immortal Realm and the Netherworld, this was a precious treasure. It would help them perfect their Regulations and truly cultivate to perfection.

The clash of the two Realms, or even the merging, was that truly the perfect world?

Innumerable thoughts streamed through Ling Han’s head, but he set everything aside at this time, and began to absorb the Celestial Qi to improve himself.

With the Demonic Power Source, he could only possess the aura of the Netherworld. It did not mean that he could grasp the Regulations of the Netherworld. Thus, he would take this chance to endlessly perfect himself and advance towards that perfect, flawless Dao.

Small Tower did not speak any further to avoid disturbing Ling Han.

All the pores on Ling Han’s body were fully opened as he absorbed this so-called “Celestial Qi”.

With the completion of his Regulations, there was actually a considerable boost to his cultivation level. It had boosted his peak stage of consummate level to perfection. At this point, if he did not break through to the pinnacle level, his cultivation level could not possibly be increased further. However, as the Regulations of the two Realms were perfected, his battle prowess was endlessly spiking.

The use of Regulations was initially a part of battle prowess, and following the increase of cultivation level, the importance of Regulations would become gradually greater and greater.

Ling Han’s power could surpass six stars, but his battle prowess was only about slightly over six stars, and that was because the Regulations he had grasped had not yet caught up.

The time was limited. He could not possibly cultivate each cultivation level to perfection again; he could only make as much use of whatever time he had as he could.

There was only three days.

Everyone was sitting in cross-legged positions. Not everyone knew what the “Celestial Qi” meant, but they obviously knew this was greatly beneficial to themselves. Naturally, they would absorb as much as they possibly could.

Time passed very quickly. Ling Han only felt as if his tendons, bones, blood, and flesh had all experienced a sliver of change. Though he could not really say what this change was, he understood that he was progressing in a better direction.

And even in the territory of Rising From The Ashes of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, Ling Han had gained new understanding.

He was certain that if he could continue to bathe in this Celestial Qi, the time that he needed to take to comprehend Rising From The Ashes would be shrunk in half!

Unfortunately, this was too precious, and he only had a mere three days’ time.

HIs Godly bones were increasingly crystalline. They were obviously forged from a material akin to gold, but if one looked closer, they were half-transparent and as translucent as crystal. They exuded streams of light, with dense divine patterns on them.

That was the manifestation of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll. However, aside from Ling Han, no one could understand what they actually meant.

Now that he had simultaneously grasped the Regulations of two Realms, even the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll had become stronger!

Weng, the light that enshrouded the platforms vanished, and the time limit of three days had arrived.

Ling Han wished to continue. The time of three days was far from enough for him to re-cultivate all his cultivation levels to perfection. Unfortunately, he could no longer continue. If he wanted to again be boosted by good fortune, he could only emerge victorious among the Nine Kings, and become the king among kings.

At this moment, he was filled with motivation, and his resolve was incomparably sturdy.

Xiu, xiu, xiu. The nine people on the platforms were all sent flying into the forest. The second round of battle was about to begin.

Ling Han first found the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden. Though she was also at the level of a top-grade prodigy, she was definitely not on the same level as the nine great king tiers. If she was targeted by any of them, it would mean big trouble for her.

After the two of them reunited, they turned to look at the mountain summit.

It was very simple to become the final king among kings. There was a platform on the mountaintop. Three days later, the person standing on top of that platform would be the final victor. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“I won’t join in on this, so I will wait for you here,” the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden said.

She knew that if she continued to follow Ling Han, it was inevitable that she would distract Ling Han.

Ling Han thought for a moment. Then, he nodded, and replied, “All right!”

The Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden tugged at him, and gave him a light hug. “Be careful!” She was deeply rueful. Based on her understanding, it should be she that was protecting Ling Han in their relationship, but now, it was Ling Han who was taking care of her instead, which was both an unfamiliar and sweet experience for her.

Ling Han though took the chance to embrace her slender waist and gave her a kiss, instantly causing this fierce woman to lose her wits. At first, she still wanted to resist, but very soon, she was completely kissed dizzy. Her slender body turned soft like water, and collapsed into Ling Han’s arms.

She was as tender as water, graceful and exquisite.

Ling Han’s heart throbbed, but his “young and inexperienced” body did not have the slightest reaction, and he gritted his teeth in irritation.

Rising From The Ashes... he had to complete learning it in the shortest time possible!

Ling Han strode forwards, and the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden saw him off from behind him, her eyes dazed.

The Mountain River Forest was not big, and the peak was only about 3,000 meters tall. It would not take too much time for even an ordinary person to climb to the peak of the mountain, what more when it was an Immortal. Very soon, Ling Han had arrived at the summit. At this time, the other seven had all reached their positions, but the battle had not started.

“You’re finally here!” Chi Huangji’s eyes lit up, while the red sun above his head suddenly doubled in size. His aura increased by a hundredfold. He laughed loudly. “All of you can attack together!”
