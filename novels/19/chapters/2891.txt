2892 You know Young Master Fei?

Even the White Flames Heavenly Venerate didn’t expect such an outcome, and turned pale with shock.

In a battle of a Third Tier against Fourth Tier, Ling Han actually still gained the upper hand?

They had to be seeing things!

The purple-robed Fourth Tier took a deep breath. “So you’re freakish to this extent! Not bad, not bad. Previously, it was indeed our juniors who were blind and only asking to be humiliated.”

Ling Han possessed the battle prowess of a Fourth Tier, which meant that he was a Fourth Tier Heavenly Venerate. If a Third Tier was disrespectful towards him, he would have deserved a beating. Just like how Ling Han was disrespectful to him just now, and how he hadn’t even hesitated to suppress him.

“However, it would be less easy to resolve the matter now!” he said calmly, but his tone was filled with killing intent.

How could he endure public humiliation like this, as if a Fourth Tier like him was actually no match for a Third Tier?

Weng, a blurry seal appeared on his forehead. His entire body also emitted a silver glow, and his aura surged.

With the enhancement of the Heavenly Venerable Seal, his battle prowess instantly increased by more than ten times.

It was an eighth-grade seal!

Although it was only an eighth-grade seal, Heavenly Venerable Seals were rare, and most of the Heavenly Venerable Seals contained in raw stones were of the ninth grade. As such, eighth-grade seals were very, very extraordinary.

He roared again. The spot between his brows split open, and a precious tower flew out. It had a total of 18 levels, and every level seemed like crystal, emanating the air of Primal Chaos. With a loud roar, he controlled the precious tower to make it descend down towards Ling Han.

The precious tower spun gently and enlarged continuously. As the air of Primal Chaos descended, it seemed to be even heavier than a whole dimension.

This was not impossible, because it had been forged by a Fourth Tier, so it was definitely no difficult task for it to destroy a low-level dimension with a single strike.

Ling Han smiled faintly, and pointed a finger.

Peng!

He was so nonchalant, but the purple-robed Fourth Tier’s precious tower immediately flew backwards, and his entire body was knocked back.

This time, everyone’s expression didn’t change. Instead, they were shocked to the core.

Not only did the purple-robed Fourth Tier use a Heavenly Venerable Seal, but he also took out a Heavenly Venerate Tool, and activated it with a secret technique. It could be said that he had fully unleashed his abilities.

But how did Ling Han respond?

He had only casually pointed out a finger, and the purple-robed Fourth Tier’s precious tool had already flown out of his hands, and his body had been sent flying. What kind of enormous difference in strength was this?

If Ling Han had been in the Fourth Tier, and the purple-robed man was in the Third Tier, this result would have been acceptable to everyone.

“Are you still continuing?” Ling Han said to the purple-robed Fourth Tier. The latter had already run back for the second time. Ling Han had shown mercy. He had only sent the other party flying, but had not seriously injured him.

The purple-robed Fourth Tier gritted his teeth, but he couldn’t say anything.

What could he say?

A Fourth Tier couldn’t even crush a Third Tier, yet he was easily defeated when he went all out. How could he still have the face to say anything? 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

However, he was still defiant. He felt that there was a limit to how much stronger Ling Han was compared to him. After all, he had not been injured either time.

Most importantly, Ling Han’s attitude was too displeasing. It was as if Purple Robe wasn’t a Heavenly Venerate, but just a random passerby.

“Young man, you are indeed freakish, and your battle prowess is astonishing.” The blue-robed Fourth Tier stepped forward. “However, being overly hard would make it easy to break. You are too arrogant, and it is unavoidable that you will offend many people. Moreover, have you heard of a saying?”

He paused for a moment. “Two fists are no match for four hands1!”

Ling Han laughed loudly, and wagged his finger. “I’ve only heard of this saying—a lion enters a flock of sheep2. In other words, you’re a bunch of trash. No matter how many of you there are, it’s useless. I can suppress all of you single-handedly.”

Being ridiculed by him in this manner, the five Fourth Tiers, including the White Flames Heavenly Venerate, revealed extremely furious expressions.

Too arrogant, too arrogant.

“Young man, it’s not a good thing to be too flashy,” the White Flames Heavenly Venerate said calmly. “Today, I’ll teach you a good lesson!”

The five Fourth Tiers all walked out together. Boom, they each channeled a Heavenly Venerable Seal, and Primal Chaos Qi poured out from their pores, and they transformed into five gods. Any one of them could suppress the heavens with a single hand.

Ling Han didn’t mind. His current target was already placed at the Fifth Tier. As for Fourth Tiers, to say nothing of five, even 100 of them might not be enough.

“Die!” The five Heavenly Venerates attacked in unison, suppressing Ling Han.

This was an incomparably terrifying power, enough to make any Fourth Tier’s expression change and force them to retreat.

Ling Han stretched out his finger again, and casually pointed out.

Peng, the five Heavenly Venerates immediately scattered as if flowers, completely unable to withstand a single blow.

Pa, pa, pa! The White Flames Heavenly Venerate and the others fell to the ground one after another. This time, Ling Han had used a lot of strength, causing all of them to cough up blood continuously.

‘This…!’

Those Third Tiers and Second Tiers all opened their mouths wide, and their eyes widened.

How was this possible?

How could they believe this?

Five Fourth Tier elites… were crushed like dried weeds, as if their opponent was not a Third Tier elite, but a Fifth Tier elite.

Fifth Tier!

They looked at Ling Han, and their bodies couldn’t help but tremble. Could it be that this person had tier-surpassing battle prowess of two cultivation levels?

However, advancing from the Fourth Tier to the Fifth Tier was a huge leap. There were very few people in the world who possessed Fifth-Tier battle prowess at Fourth Tier, not to mention that Ling Han was only a Third Tier.

Monster, an absolute monster.

Ling Han looked at the White Flames Heavenly Venerate. “I told you that I would remember you. One day, I’d settle scores with you, right?”

The White Flames Heavenly Venerate’s heart was in utter despair. This freakish person was definitely not human. He could possess the power of Fifth Tier at Third Tier. He said dejectedly, “That’s right.”

“Alright!” Ling Han threw a punch. Peng, the White Flames Heavenly Venerate was immediately blasted apart.

Back then, the other man had charged to their doors, wanting to kill Ling Han and extract the Heavenly Venerable Seals from him, and did not give him a way out, either. What right did he have now to ask Ling Han to show mercy?

...

Naturally, Ling Han had to kill him.

Ling Han then looked at the other four Fourth Tiers. As his gaze swept over them, their bodies trembled involuntarily.

“Sir, we are from the Xuanwu Alliance,” the purple-robed Fourth Tier said. At this time, he could only use his background to intimidate and scare Ling Han.

“Xuanwu Alliance?” Ling Han was astounded. Previously, it was he who had killed members of the Xuanwu Alliance, which meant that he did not even manage to participate in the fight for the last most valuable vein of ore. He could only retreat and find a place to enter into seclusion for his breakthrough.

Unexpectedly, as the saying went, “destiny will make enemies meet”; they met people from the Xuanwu Alliance here.

The Xuanwu Alliance was a Fifth-Tier force. Although it was still slightly inferior to a Sixth-Tier force, there were only about 100 Sixth-Tier forces in the world, and a Fifth-Tier force was already quite strong.

Seeing that Ling Han was hesitating, the purple-robed Fourth Tier and the others all revealed excited expressions, seeing a glimmer of hope.

Ling Han chuckled, and said, “What rank is Fei Baizhu’s father in the Xuanwu Alliance?”

“Lord Fei Wu?” The purple-robed Fourth Tier was stunned. He did not expect Ling Han to actually mention Fei Baizhu and his old man, but the hope in his heart became even stronger. It would be even better if the two of them had a friendship. “It was Lord Fei Wu and Lord Qi Xuan who established the Xuanwu Alliance together, and he is one of the two Alliance Leaders.”

He couldn’t help but ask, “Sir, do you know Young Master Fei?” He didn’t dare to say that Fei Baizhu was already dead, as he was afraid that Ling Han wouldn’t admit this friendship because of this.

“I know him; of course I know him,” Ling Han said with a smile. “I killed him with my own hands, so how could I not know him? You really like to joke.”

...

Pu! The purple-robed Fourth Tier and the others all spluttered.
