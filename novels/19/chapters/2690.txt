2691 Not enough!

“You…” Liu Qiyuan pointed at Ling Han, so furious that he could barely speak.

‘This is the Liu Clan, the Liu Clan, you bastard.’

Ling Han’s gaze became harsh. “The thing I hate the most is when others point their finger at me!”

With a bounce of his feet, peng, he burst out instantly at an astonishing speed, charging towards Liu Qiyuan.

Though Liu Qiyuan was very wary of Ling Han, it had not reached an extent that he did not dare to even battle him. For better or worse, he was also a Ninth Heaven Celestial King himself.

“Evil brat, don’t go too far!” he roared, each hand grabbing a streak of great dao, which he smashed towards Ling Han.

When one had reached the height of the Ninth Heaven, there was no need to use any kind of secret technique when fighting lower-level Celestial Kings. They only had to grab a streak of great dao and smash it into their opponent. This was the overwhelming power of a superior cultivation level, and was always successful.

Ling Han smirked. Body Art fused with Regulations, his every punch was filled with force, and he very soon suppressed Liu Qiyuan.

When those members of the Liu Clan saw this, they were all involuntarily captivated.

“He is only in the Eighth Heaven!”

“As an Eighth Heaven, he is already capable of suppressing Elder Qiyuan who is at peak-stage Ninth Heaven, then what about when he advances to the Ninth Heaven?”

“Would he then be able to suppress a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Heavens!”

They all grabbed their heads in disbelief. This was a scene that they dared not believe. The impact was really too great on them.

“Damn! Damn!” Liu Qiyuan roared in fury. Previously, he had only heard descriptions of Ling Han’s strength from the mouths of those Celestial Kings that had escaped to the Liu Clan. Now that he was facing him himself, he finally realized just how strong Ling Han could be.

He did not dare believe it. How could an Eighth Heaven Celestial King be so strong?

Liu Qiyuan unleashed his full battle prowess, but he could not turn the situation around at all. No matter how much he struggled, it was useless. He was still being suppressed by Ling Han.

“You have gone too far!!” he roared in fury, and drew his Celestial Tool.

This was an umbrella. The moment it was spread open, the initially clear sky immediately became dark and stormy. Zi, zi, zi! Lightning flashed, exuding a pressure of supreme might.

“Die!” Liu Qiyuan roared. Previously, more than 30 Celestial Kings had ganged up on Ling Han, but they had only wanted to capture him, and had not planned to take his life. In fact, they could not even inflict serious injury on him, so they naturally had not brought their Celestial Tools with them. But this time was different. Ling Han had already charged right up to their doors. Even if Liu Qiyuan killed Ling Han with his Celestial Tool, the martial academy would not say anything.

Clang! A bolt of lightning soared angrily, striking down on Ling Han.

Ling Han stretched out a hand to grab it. Peng! Sparks flashed, turning into countless seals shattering, and bringing with them some blood.

He had been injured.

After all, his Indestructible Celestial King Physique had only reached Great Accomplishment level, and he had not advanced to the level of Divine Metal yet. Taking on the might of a Celestial Tool with his bare hands still caused him slight injury.

It was a light injury; he had only bled a little.

Ling Han shook his head. If he reached the Ninth Heaven, with great dao wrapped around his hands, there was definitely no way he would be wounded by taking this strike head-on. Unless he was directly struck by a Celestial Tool. In that case, he would still be injured. He was only at the Eighth Heaven at present, but his battle prowess could suppress a Ninth-Heaven opponent. That was because of his domineering Body Art. In terms of Regulations, he naturally was still no match for a Ninth Heaven.

When they saw how Liu Qiyuan had summoned his Celestial Tool, and wounded Ling Han with a single strike, those people of the Liu Clan were all overjoyed, and they all erupted into loud cheers.

Liu Qiyuan also showed a hint of a smile. It looked like Ling Han was only so strong. He had previously been able to make such a great show of his vicious might only because he had a Celestial Tool, and the others had not.

“You want to compete with me in precious tools?” Ling Han grinned. “Are you sure you want to do that?”

“Humph, you have no idea about the power of our Liu Clan yet. Every single Ninth Heaven Celestial King would have a Celestial Tool, and if we unleash our might together, even a Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate would be no match for us!” Liu Qiyuan sneered. “You are only a mere Eighth Heaven Celestial King, after all, so how could you know the frightening power that our Liu Clan has accumulated through the epochs?”

Crack! Crack! Crack! Bolts of lightning struck madly.

Ling Han chuckled. This guy was really taking full advantage of the fact that he now had a slight upper hand. Did he really think that Celestial Tools were all that impressive?

“Then, let me give it a try.” With a loud battle cry, Ling Han rushed forwards.

Liu Qiyuan waved his Celestial Tool in a sweep towards Ling Han, wanting to use his domineering might to suppress Ling Han. As for killing him? It would be better to force Ling Han to concoct alchemical pills after he captured him. This would have to depend on the decision made after the higher-ups discussed the matter.

Shua! Cold light swept past.

Liu Qiyuan was instantly sent flying, and he shockingly discovered that a small cut had actually been left on the surface of his umbrella!

Ling Han’s hand held a rusted sword, and it practically looked like a shabby knife used to cut firewood1.

However, it was precisely this sword that was so rusty to the point of becoming scrap metal that had damaged his Celestial Tool in a single stroke.

“Th-this is!” Liu Qiyuan’s expression changed drastically. The Celestial Kings that had escaped had said that there seemed to be a supreme precious tool in Ling Han’s possession. Liu Qiyuan had always scoffed at this. How could it be that a puny Eighth Heaven Celestial King would have such a treasure? Yet now, he had no choice but to acknowledge this fact. If it was not a supreme precious tool, how could it possibly be so powerful?

“Still continuing the competition?” Ling Han smiled.

Liu Qiyuan could not speak. The Liu Clan naturally had a supreme precious tool as well, but it was always by the side of the grand elder of the Liu Clan, and accompanied him to the Realm Battlefield.

Faced with an elite whose battle prowess surpassed peak-stage Ninth Heaven, added with a supreme precious tool, how was he able to block this?

“Hehe, so Grandmaster Ling has arrived. Please forgive us for not coming out to receive you!” A loud laugh rang out, and 18 Ninth Heaven Celestial Kings appeared together.

This was the strongest power of the Liu Clan. Originally, they had been watching the battle secretly, but when they saw how Ling Han had drawn the Divine Demon Sword and unleashed its might, they naturally could no longer sit by and watch. Thus, they all walked out together.

Ling Han stood, sword in hand. “Enough with the nonsense. My request is very simple. Make reparations for my losses, and I will leave immediately.”

The present clan leader of the Liu Clan, Liu Yanghe, stepped out, and said, “Previously, we had been deceived by a villain, and that was why we had made a move on Grandmaster Ling. This is indeed our mistake…”

Hearing these words, every member of the Liu Clan felt their faces flush hotly.

This was a humiliation. Since the Liu Clan had been established, when had they ever suffered such a humiliation? They still had to apologize with a bowed head when someone had already charged right up to their doors?

But who asked the members of the Liu Clan to fail to live up to expectations? No other Pseudo-Heavenly Venerate had appeared from their midst throughout several epochs. Otherwise, how could they be so tragic?

Just look at the other noble clans. Take the Wang Clan for example. Their grand elder was a Third Tier Heavenly Venerate, and they had afterwards a prodigy by the name of Wang Ande, who had advanced to the Pseudo-Heavenly Venerable Tier after only cultivating tens of billions of years. He only had to take one more step, and becoming a true Heavenly Venerate was only a matter of time.

Why did the Liu Clan have no qualified successors then?

“We are willing to make reparations for Grandmaster Ling. Here are three pieces of Divine Metal; please accept them, Grandmaster Ling!” With a wave of Liu Yanghe’s hand, a beautiful woman immediately walked out, bearing a tray in her hands. There were three pieces of metal of different colors on the tray, but they were all exuding a stunning brilliance.

This garnered the envy of many junior descendants of the Liu Clan. Even Eighth Heaven Celestial Kings would be filled with envy. This was Divine Metal.

In the Liu Clan, one would only be bestowed with Divine Metal upon becoming a Ninth Heaven Celestial King. This was the rule.

Ling Han did not even glance at it. Waving a hand dismissively, he said, “It’s not enough!”

His life was just worth three pieces of Divine Metal? They had to be joking with him.

Every member of the Liu Clan was enraged. ‘What are you acting so pretentious for? If it was not for the fact that the grand elder of the Liu Clan is based at the Realm Battlefield, what right would you have to act arrogantly?’

“Ling Han, don’t go too far!” a Ninth Heaven Celestial King rebuked. “Our grand elder is standing guard at the Realm Battlefield, participating in the resistance against Hysteria’s invasion. It is because of his sacrifice that you were given room to grow, yet you are now committing violence in the Liu Clan. Do you even have any conscience?”

Ling Han laughed. “You are right. The grand elder of the Liu Clan is fighting against Hysteria. This kind of sacrifice and contribution is something I truly admire, but can this become the reason for you all to bully me, and use your superior status to humiliate me?”
