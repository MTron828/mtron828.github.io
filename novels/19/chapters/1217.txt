Chapter 1218: Fusing with the power of lightning

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Ling Han endured the heavenly tribulation, and tempered himself as he did so to increase his appreciation of the great dao.

The tribulation represented the strongest danger that the Dao of Heaven and Earth could present. If he could appreciate this kind of great dao, his own battle prowess would be increased greatly.

Ling Han was comprehending his own dao.

He had already grasped the basics of the Lightning Sword Technique, but this was more in name than in fact. It was only because this sword technique possessed the two traits of quickness and massive destructive ability, which was why he had named it the Lightning Sword Technique.

Only if he could also fuse it with the power of divine lightning would the Lightning Sword Technique not be just a mere name, but also a real entity.

How fast was the divine lightning? What if it could also possess this kind of unique trait?

Though Ling Han had been turned into dust, his divine sense was still firm. Under the tempering of the Indestructible Heaven’s Scroll, his spirit was incredibly firm. Even if it was separated from his form and had turned into a ball of light, no matter how the heavenly tribulation attacked, it was not damaged.

The strength of his spirit was actually in the level above the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier and below the medium extreme. Thus, it was naturally impossible that this power of lightning on the level of the early stage of the Sun Moon Tier would be able to hurt his spirit.

In the midst of the tribulation, he could experience the power of lightning very well, and understand it straight to its essence.

‘Unfortunately, the heavenly tribulation comes too rarely, and won’t last for too long, either,’ Ling Han thought. However, an idea immediately appeared to him. ‘Personally, I would only endure the heavenly tribulation just those few times on my own, but couldn’t I borrow the chance of others to endure the tribulation?

‘If I could control this lightning technique, then whether it is the sword technique or the movement technique, they will be greatly improved.’

Half a day later, all the thunderclouds dispersed. Ling Han channeled a drop of the Indestructible True Fluid, and his body immediately recovered completely. Furthermore, he felt that there was an apparent change in himself.

The Sun Moon Tier.

His power had increased at least a million from before he endured the tribulation!

‘True enough, this is a massive barrier. Once I have crossed over it, I originally could have power surpassing 10 stars, and now, only six stars is left behind.

‘To once more possess power surpassing 10 stars, I will have to cultivate to the pinnacle level of the Sun Moon Tier.’

However, only those who had reached the pinnacle level in the Mountain River Tier could possess six stars of power before Sun Moon Tier. Moreover, he would have to reach the peak stage of the pinnacle level of the Mountain River Tier.

If it was an ordinary Mountain River Tier, the most he would possess would be four stars of power. Only once he had cultivated to the pinnacle level would his power surpass four stars. Based on what he had achieved in the pinnacle level, his power would be in between four to six stars.

‘My present power is capable of matching the late stage of the medium extreme of the Sun Moon Tier. However, this is only in terms of pure power. In terms of the understanding of the Regulations of heaven and earth, I am still in the early stage of the low extreme of the Sun Moon Tier. Thus, even if I had another secret technique, my battle prowess would only be able to surpass six to seven stars.

‘Hence, the public all say that five-star geniuses only existed in legends. Though that is a bit exaggerated, it is also a very logical understanding. That is because there are really too few people who have cultivated to the pinnacle level.

“Huh?!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ling Han was startled, and asked, “Small Tower, why is there no change to the Black Tower?”

He had broken through a major tier already, so why did a new level not appear in the Black Tower so that his Five Elements would be complete?

“You have to advance by another tier.” Surprisingly, Small Tower gave him a clear answer this time.

“What!?” Ling Han almost jumped. “I have to reach the Heavenly Body Tier before I can unlock the fifth level? Wouldn’t that mean that by the time I reach the Genesis Tier, I would only be able to unlock the seventh level at most?”

“Wrong. When you reach the Genesis Tier, you will only be able to unlock the sixth level,” Small Tower said with complete seriousness.

Ling Han was stunned. “Then what about the remaining three levels? I will only be able to unlock them when I advance into the Celestial Realm?”

“Mm-hm!” Small Tower waved to and fro. This was its movement for nodding. “So, you have to cultivate as much as possible. When the Black Tower is fully unlocked, I will also be able to recover all my memories.”

Ling Han thought for a moment, and then said, “So, going by that logic, your memories have not been dispersed, but have rather been sealed.”

“Perhaps,” Small Tower said calmly. “Young man, work hard on cultivating! Just think, if you once again break through at the Genesis Tier, you will be able to enter into the Celestial Realm. And in my vague memories, those in the Celestial Realm should live eternally.”

“What!?” Ling Han was astonished. The elites of the Celestial Realm actually possessed unlimited lifespan? Then how powerful was this Celestial Realm?

Elites could continue cultivating for a billion, a hundred billion, a trillion years, and become stronger and stronger!

No wonder such a precious treasure like the Reincarnation Tree existed. Even Genesis Tiers could not wait for twelve trillion years, but the elites of the Celestial Realm could!

“However, you do not have to be discouraged. Though the lifespan of elites in the Celestial Realm is unlimited, there is still the Celestial Decline. If they cannot survive it, they, too, will be killed,” Small Tower said calmly. “An unlimited lifespan does not mean eternal indestructibility.”

Ling Han nodded. The original owner of the Black Tower should’ve been an elite of the Celestial Realm, yet he had still died.

“Young man, race towards the sun!” Small Tower exclaimed.

Ling Han was struck speechless. He discovered that this Tool Spirit displayed the trait of being two-faced more and more frequently.

He returned to the small town. Since he had already endured the heavenly tribulation, and crossed over into the Sun Moon Tier, then he should set out towards the Cloud Apex Planet.

However, Feng Po Yun and the others broke through one after the other, so Ling Han could only delay his plans for a while, waiting for this trend of breaking through to pass before setting out.

Feng Po Yun and Mu Rong Qing had both advanced into the medium extreme of the Mountain River Tier. Helian Tianyun was ahead of them by one cultivation level, and had advanced into the high extreme. Ding Ping’s progress was the most exaggerated—he had reached the consummate level.

If they told anyone about this, it would definitely scare them to death. It had only been a few short years, so how could they have advanced at such a frighteningly rapid pace?

However, to be honest, if they still were not able to attain such shocking advancement pace with Ling Han’s continuous supply of alchemical pills to help them accumulate Origin Power and the Reincarnation Tree to help them in the comprehension of Dao, what right would Feng Po Yun and the others have to call themselves prodigies?

Ling Han did not rest on his laurels, either. When they endured their heavenly tribulation, Ling Han would be by their side, freeloading on their tribulation.

In the eyes of others, this was practically a move to seek death. He could have done anything, yet he chose to freeload off the tribulation of others. But to Ling Han, he did not need to shatter his Godly bones to temper himself. Instead, he merely had to observe the power of the heavenly tribulation, so he naturally did not need to suffer the slightest bit. He merely had to study and observe the proceedings quietly.

After enduring four tribulations, Ling Han secluded himself beneath the Reincarnation Tree for three days. When he opened his eyes again, hiss, there was actually a flash of lightning flickering in them.

“In comparison to the lightning technique that I have grasped now, the Thunderclap Ninth Heaven is practically trash.” Ling Han shook his head. After all, the Thunderclap Ninth Heaven was only the lowest-grade cultivation technique of the Immortal Realm, whereas the heavenly tribulation was the embodiment of the Heavenly Dao. How could there be any comparison?

‘As my cultivation level becomes higher and higher, the heavenly tribulation that I have to endure will naturally become more and more powerful, and the power of lightning that I can control will also become stronger and stronger.

‘With heaven and earth as my master, and to create my own Dao.’

Ling Han’s gaze was determined. The path that he was about to walk was becoming clearer and clearer.

Since everyone had endured the heavenly tribulation, they could not possibly have a further breakthrough in a short term, so Ling Han decided to set out. However, he had not yet begun his journey when he surprisingly encountered a person who was there to see him off.

It was Empress Luan Xing!

Not her doppelganger, but her true self.

“You are leaving?” she asked. Her exquisite beauty was enshrouded in a Qi of chaos, while her tone was calm, and not the slightest bit of fluctuation could be discerned from her voice.

Since she was as strong as Heavenly Body Tier, she was naturally capable of controlling her own emotions very well.

Ling Han broke out in a smile, and said, “I was going to drop by Joint Peace Planet to bid you farewell on the way. I have not thought that you would come.”
