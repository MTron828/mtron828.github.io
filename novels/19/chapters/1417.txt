Chapter 1418 Sowing Discord

This young man... How many treasures did he possess?Everyone was stunned yet also incredibly curious. Of Ling Han’s two swords, it was clear that either of them could be categorized as a precious treasure. However, both these swords were now being wielded by the same person. This truly embarrassed the older-generation elites to death.After cultivating and adventuring for so long, they still couldn’t compare to a young man who had yet to turn 500 years old!

The Eternity Sky Emperor’s expression became serious as he felt his sword trembling in his hand. His Divine Sword had developed a spirit, and this trembling was the sign that the sword spirit was experiencing terror. This was terror induced by a higher-level being.

What kind of sword was that? Its might wasn’t great, and it was merely domineering in appearance, so why was it causing his Fire Dragon Sword to feel terror? The Fire Dragon Sword was a Divine Sword that had been continuously nurtured by generation after generation of elites of the Eternity Sky Majestic Empire. It had already developed a Tool Spirit, and when awakened, even he couldn’t parallel its might!

Yet, a God Tool such as this was actually experiencing terror because of a sword that wasn’t very high in level? This was far too strange!

Even an Eternal River Tier God Tool couldn’t induce such terror in his sword!

“Die!” The Jade Drop Emperor raised his spear as he charged at Ling Han. He could also sense the terror that had enveloped his Emerald Water Spear. Thus, he decided to attack immediately, seeking to kill Ling Han as soon as possible. Otherwise, the spirit of his Emerald Water Spear ran the risk of being petrified into dissipation!

Weng!

The Divine Demon Sword slashed downward by itself, heaven’s might suffusing into the surroundings and forcefully suppressing the Jade Drop Emperor’s battle prowess by two stars.

Under Ling Han’s nurturing, the Divine Demon Sword also possessed the complete power of heaven’s might. This was because it was forged from Divine Metal, allowing it to withstand and utilize this kind of martial intent. If it were forged from ordinary Godly metal, perhaps it would shatter itself to oblivion if it attempted to unleash heaven’s might.

It was a pity that the heaven’s might of the Divine Demon Sword couldn’t stack with the heaven’s might unleashed by Ling Han. This was because they came from the same source, the heaven’s might unleashed by the Divine Demon Sword originating from the martial intent that Ling Han had imbued within it. In other words, there was no difference between the heaven’s might that they unleashed.

The Jade Drop Emperor was astounded. His power had fallen drastically, by no less than one-hundred-fold!

He hurriedly stopped his attack. The immense drop in his power was a cause for great alarm. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Upon seeing the Jade Drop Emperor retreat, the Eternity Sky Emperor couldn’t help but frown. ‘What the hell are you doing?’

He humphed before wielding his sword and charging forward. However, he immediately experienced what the Jade Drop Emperor had just experienced. There was shock on his face as he ground to a halt. However, greed slowly spread across his face as he stared at the Divine Demon Sword hovering in the sky.

If he could obtain that sword, how much would his battle prowess increase by?

If others lost two stars of power, wouldn’t that be equivalent to him gaining two stars of power?

Gasp!

This sword was far too valuable! This sword could challenge the power of an entire nation!

Ling Han grinned, and said, “Jade Drop Emperor, why don’t we team up to kill the King of Curses first?”

‘What?’

The Jade Drop Emperor was confused by this sudden question. ‘Even if you’re trying to sow discord, this method is far too poor, don’t you think?’

“Even if you two manage to kill me, it’s still inevitable that you’ll have to battle each other in the end,” Ling Han continued. “However, let me ask you this. Are you confident that you can achieve victory over him?

“Definitely not!” Ling Han answered for the Jade Drop Emperor. “Thus, it’s in your best interests to team up with me first. You’ve seen it yourself. My sword has the ability to suppress the power of others. Given a power advantage of two stars, won’t killing the King of Curses be a walk in the park for you?

“We’ll kill the King of Curses first, and then you can kill me later. This won’t waste much of your time and is also incredibly beneficial, don’t you agree?”

‘He’s f*cking correct!’

At this moment, the Jade Drop Emperor was indeed swayed by Ling Han’s words. He could borrow Ling Han’s power to kill the Eternity Sky Emperor first. Then, even if his power were suppressed by two stars, he would still possess the ability to kill Ling Han. It wouldn’t be too difficult and would simply take a little longer than normal.

Moreover, at that time, there would be no other competition for the empress. In addition, the Eternity Sky Majestic Empire and Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire would both fall into his hands. He would become the paramount ruler, and he would also have a stunning beauty in his embrace. He would reach the pinnacle state of his life.

Ruling over the Joint Peace Planet and marrying Empress Luan Xing were the life goals of the Jade Drop Emperor. Right now, these goals were within arm’s reach. So, how could he not be tempted?

Seeing the hesitation on the Jade Drop Emperor’s face, the Eternity Sky Emperor hurriedly said, “Don’t fall for that brat’s trap! That brat is full of tricks, and he’s a boundless threat for both of us. It’s best that we dispose of him as soon as possible!”

He was genuinely worried at this moment. If the Jade Drop Emperor decided to turn against him, the power difference of two stars would undoubtedly lead to his death!

At that time, everything he had done and achieved would be gifted to the Jade Drop Emperor. Moreover, his name would be humiliated even after death. He would become the example of a fool, a story taught to future generations to help them avoid repeating the same mistakes.

Meanwhile, the Jade Drop Emperor’s heart was beating in excitement. This proposal was far too enticing. Moreover, it was definitely achievable. If he passed this opportunity, he would be relentlessly attacked by the Eternity Sky Majestic Empire even if he managed to capture Empress Luan Xing. He would never see another day of peace.

The Eternity Sky Emperor hurriedly waved a hand, and roared, “Everyone, charge! Kill that despicable brat!” As long as he captured Ling Han and obtained his Divine Sword, he would have heaps of time to kill the Jade Drop Emperor afterward.

After all, which of the emperors didn’t want to kill the other to marry the woman of their dreams?

However, Ling Han hadn’t offered the same proposal to him. Otherwise, he might have already charged over to attack the Jade Drop Emperor.

The Jade Drop Emperor’s mind whirred. He was also slightly worried about Ling Han’s bag of dirty tricks. After all, he seemed to possess a plethora of precious treasures and profound cultivation techniques. Who knew how many more trump cards he possessed? In the end, he also waved his hand and commanded his Heavenly Body Tier elites to attack Ling Han.

He definitely had to obtain that Divine Sword!

He transmitted a message using his divine sense before turning around to face off against the Eternity Sky Emperor.

However, neither of them dared to attack the other rashly. Right now, the key to this conflict lay with that Divine Sword. Whoever obtained that sword would obtain an absolute advantage.

Ling Han breathed a sigh of relief. His enticing words had finally rid him of his two greatest enemies.

However, the two Majestic Empires still had a total of seven elites at the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier. Dealing with these elites was still a great challenge.

In any case, facing seven elites was still better than facing nine elites, Ling Han comforted himself in his mind.

Weng!

The Divine Demon Sword shuddered slightly, continuing to unleash heaven’s might as it slashed toward the Heavenly Body Tier elites.

“Heh, come to my hands!” The Jade Drop Emperor suddenly reached over. He wasn’t attacking Ling Han simply because he wanted to snatch the Divine Demon Sword.

“In your dreams!” The Eternity Sky Emperor also reached over. He definitely wouldn’t allow the Jade Drop Emperor to obtain the Divine Sword.

The two emperors continued to struggle for the Divine Sword, both of them sabotaging each other’s attempts to obtain it. Although they were tied up in this competition, this also rendered the Divine Demon Sword unable to help Ling Han. It could only concentrate on its battle with the two emperors.

With the Divine Demon Sword gone, the Heavenly Body Tier elites instantly recovered their full power. They all breathed sighs of relief, their confidence immediately returning.

Ling Han cracked a smile. ‘You think only the Divine Demon Sword can suppress your cultivation?’

Weng!

He unleashed heaven’s might.

“What?!”

“Why has our power been suppressed again?”

“Strange! We’re clearly far away enough from that sword!”

The Heavenly Body Tier elites were all dumbfounded. Why had this wretched feeling returned again?

“It... It’s him!” someone exclaimed in a shaky voice as they pointed at Ling Han.

The remaining elites all turned around to gaze at Ling Han. They were instantly scared silly.

‘A human can actually possess this kind of power?

‘Are you f*cking cheating?!’

Ling Han wielded his wooden sword, and balefully said, “Today, I’m going to go on a killing spree!”

He charged forward, his figure as quick as lightning as he activated the Lightning Sword Technique and Tide of the Ages. It was as if he were a wolf among a herd of sheep as he swung his sword, each slash drawing blood.

Although the wooden sword wasn’t a Celestial Tool, it was still a deadly weapon from the Netherworld. Its quality was definitely astonishingly high. Even though it was severely damaged, rendering it unable to be awakened, it still possessed a terrifying destructive ability.

This was especially the case against living beings. As Ling Han slashed down, the wooden sword would unleash bursts of devastating murderous aura that could completely obliterate the vitality of living beings. Moreover, the wooden sword would also absorb the blood of its victims, causing its body to become increasingly crimson. The divine patterns on its body would also become increasingly clear and sinister as if a Demon Master were about to reincarnate and leap out from it at any moment.
