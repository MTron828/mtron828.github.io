2972 An unexpected discovery

Zhu Mang was also an Ascending Origin Tier!

Seeing this, everyone was dumbfounded.

Although everyone was speculating about the day that Zhu Mang would advance to the Ascending Origin Tier, this was only a guess, after all. Who knew how long it would take for it to be realized.

But now? Zhu Mang had actually burst out with Ascending-Origin-Tier power.

How was this possible?

!!

A battle of Ascending Origin Tier against Immortal Palace Tier was an absolutely one-sided battle. Even if Immortal Palace Tier elites were to gang up on an Ascending Origin Tier elite, there would have to be at least 100 of them to be able to match one Ascending Origin Tier. The problem was, there were fewer than 100 Immortal Palace Tier elites in Peaceful Leaf City, so why did Zhu Mang have to keep such a low profile?

Boom!

The attack reverberated, turning into ripples that surged in all directions, and causing everyone’s figure to sway. This was the aftermath of an Ascending-Origin-Tier collision, which still possessed extremely great destructive power.

“Who exactly are you?” Zhu Mang asked harshly.

Ling Han smiled faintly. “I should be the one asking you this question, right?”

Zhu Mang did not speak, and merely stared at Ling Han.

Ling Han shook his head, then raised his palm, and delivered another palm strike at Zhu Mang.

Boom, endless light circulated in Zhu Mang’s body, turning into streaks of celestial light. He roared loudly, and three streaks of iridescent light appeared around his body. A terrifying pressure swept out, and everyone felt a powerful reverence rise up from the depths of their hearts, kneeling involuntarily.

“C-Celestial King!” they murmured, their expressions dumbfounded.

Who would have thought that Zhu Mang was actually a Celestial King? Moreover, he was a Third Heaven Celestial King at that!

Peng! Receiving this attack head-on, Zhu Mang’s soaring aura instantly withered as if he had received a heavy blow.

Pu! He spat out a mouthful of blood.

What?!

Everyone was grabbing their head and exclaiming in shock. They had not yet come out of the shock of Zhu Mang being a Celestial King when they saw the scene of him being blasted and experiencing a great loss.

Hiss, that was a Third Heaven Celestial King!

Just how powerful was Ling Han?

Cheng Sisi looked at Ling Duanyun, the light in her eyes extremely bright, as if she had discovered an insurmountable treasure.

Ling Duanyun coincidentally looked over as well, yet his heart jolted. There was actually a complicated feeling that could not be described, and it was not happiness or joy.

Hong, long, long, heaven and earth shook. Thunderclouds rolled out, lightning flashing closely, yet did not strike down.

“Can’t bear it anymore?” Ling Han asked calmly. He crossed his arms behind his back and allowed Zhu Mang to raise his aura.

“Die!” Zhu Mang charged over, bringing with him rolling black Qi. His previously refined appearance had completely changed, and he looked like an evil god.

Ling Han stretched out his right hand and pressed down. It seemed to be done very casually, but it was like the heavens itself was pressing down. Pa, Zhu Mang sprawled out on the ground, his limbs spread out in the Chinese character for the word big[1], appearing to have no power to resist at all.

This was an absolutely one-sided suppression.

Everyone was rendered speechless. The ability displayed by Zhu Mang was getting stronger and stronger, and now he had even surpassed the Third Heaven of Celestial King Tier, but in front of Ling Han, it was completely useless.

Ling Han asked, “What is your purpose here?”

Zhu Mang was sprawled out on the ground, his eyes glaring hatefully at Ling Han. “So what if you beat me? You’re destined to die, hahahaha!” He laughed madly, appearing extremely crazy.

“It’s fine even if you don’t say. It’s very easy to guess,” Ling Han said calmly. “It’s nothing more than brainwashing people for Hysteria, and bringing calamity to all life.”

The first time he saw Zhu Mang, he discovered that there was an aura unique to Hysteria in his body. Celestial-King-Tier beings could not possibly deceive him.

Zhu Mang’s expression involuntarily changed drastically. He stared at Ling Han, and asked, “Who are you? Who exactly are you?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“The person who ultimately will bury Hysteria!” Ling Han suddenly moved. Pa, he killed Zhu Mang with a single slap.

Boom, heaven and earth grieved together. A Celestial King had died, and even the heavens were moved. However, there was an indescribable joy in everyone’s hearts, which was incredibly strange.

This was because Zhu Mang was not only a Celestial King, but also had certain factors of Hysteria, which caused the reactions of heaven and earth to be extremely strange.

Ling Han looked towards the horizon. From the look of things, though Hysteria was devouring the Flaming Frost Realm, its actions had not stopped as a result of that. It was still extremely active, and continuously moved in secret.

Even though Zhu Mang couldn’t withstand a single blow from Ling Han, he was still a Celestial King, after all. He was powerful enough to influence countless people. For example, look at Peaceful Leaf City—who knew how many people admired Zhu Mang and saw him as their idol.

When Zhu Mang gathered them with a holler, the masses who did not know the truth could very possibly be tricked.

This was only a Peaceful Leaf City. How many other cities like Peaceful Leaf City were there in the entire Profound Negative Realm?

Ling Han took a deep breath. He had not thought that what was only an impulsive decision would actually allow him to uncover a seed that Hysteria had planted.

A powerful sense of urgency rose up in his heart. It was clear that Hysteria was speeding up its invasion.

The Genesis World no longer had any high-level dimensions. If the Profound Negative Realm fell as well, Hysteria’s invasion would be unstoppable, and the Genesis World would also completely fall.

Seventh Tier, he needed Seventh-Tier strength.

Ling Han sighed internally. He felt that he should abandon everything else in order to be able to communicate with the fourth fundamental particle as soon as possible, but the present situation was so dangerous, so how could he relax?

By the looks of it, he had to place his hopes on the core of the Flaming Frost Realm.

It was very likely that this would allow a Sixth Tier elite to advance into the Seventh Tier. Then, if he obtained it, it should not be too difficult for him to advance to the Fifth Tier.

“S-Senior!”

“Milord!”

Everyone knelt on the ground. They were all looking at Ling Han in reverence. This man had destroyed a Celestial King Tier with a single gesture. He was inconceivably strong.

Ling Han pressed down his hand, erasing everyone’s short-term memory. At present, Ling Han still didn’t want to reveal his identity.

“Let’s go.”

He left with Ling Duanyun, and decided to nurture Ling Duanyun in a short period of time. At the very least, Ling Duanyun should be able to establish himself in Peaceful Leaf City. Then, Ling Han would leave, and he planned to obtain the core of the Flaming Frost Realm, while the task of searching for other members of the Ling Clan would be left to Ling Duanyun. Ling Han couldn’t do everything himself, after all.

Ling Duanyun began to cultivate like he had gone to hell. In the next 300 years, who knew how many layers of skin he had shed, but his strength had really been tempered. He had advanced to the Immortal Palace Tier, and his foundations were also incredibly sturdy.

Ling Han left. He first had to meet Zhou Heng, Chu Hao, and the others, and find out what exactly had happened to the Ling Clan all these years.

It was naturally impossible for ordinary people to know where the Sixth Tier Heavenly Venerates lived. Ling Han had also gone through a lot of trouble to finally find out where Zhou Heng was.

…It was enough to know where one of them was.

Ling Han didn’t have the Empress and Hu Niu travel with him. Instead, he headed to the Zhou Clan by himself. If anything happened, it would be extremely easy for him to leave.

The current encounter with the Ling Clan’s descendants caused a sliver of wariness to rise up in Ling Han, though he was more willing to believe in the character of Zhou Heng.

He didn’t hide his tracks. After arriving at the Zhou Clan, he released his aura and sent out a “notification.”
