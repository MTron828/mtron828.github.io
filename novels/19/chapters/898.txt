Chapter 899: The Cat That Mustn’t Be Trifled With

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“So powerful? What kind of cat is it?” Li Weiwei asked. She was the daughter of the Left Minister, so she was naturally bold, without much reverence towards Zhang Deman. She was not afraid that he would rebuke her.

Sure enough, Zhang Deman just smiled, and said, “I’m not sure what is so special about the cat, but its owner... hehe, that person would be our Lord Head.”

“Would that be Lord Yan Dongqi, Head of Northern Institution?” Li Weiwei asked again.

Zhang Deman shook his head in reply, saying, “No, it is Lord Fu—Fu Hui!”

At this moment, everyone’s expression was filled with awe. Even Li Weiwei was gaping slightly, revealing an expression full of reverence.

Fu Hui was the head of the Scarlet Heaven Academy, not the Northern Institution! He was an elite of the Heavenly Body Tier, but no one knew the details about his cultivation level, as this elite tended to spend most of his time cultivating in seclusion.

This was precisely the reason why the four major Institutions of the Scarlet Heaven Academy tended to do things their own way, giving rise to fierce competition amongst the Institutions.

The four main Institutions also had their respective heads, known as Heads of the Institution, but their cultivation level was at the perfection level of the Sun Moon Tier. Within the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire, they could be considered the top elites.

However, one shouldn’t look at it as if it was only a difference of one level between the Sun Moon Tier and Heavenly Body Tier—the gap of this one level was extremely large. Forget about the One-star or Two-star geniuses, even a Five-star genius wouldn’t be able to cross over and break through the barrier of such a level.

Even though Li Weiwei, Ma Xing, and others were super geniuses, none of them would dare to say that they could step into the Heavenly Body Tier in the future—even reaching the Sun Moon Tier would already be extremely difficult.

It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that among each batch of students recruited once every five years, about 90% of them could step into the Mountain River Tier. After all, those who were recruited were already geniuses themselves. However, only one-tenth of them could possibly reach the middle levels, while those who could attain major accomplishment would only be about 10%, and the rest that might be able to reach the level of perfection would be one in a thousand. At most, there would only be one in ten thousand who could step into the Sun Moon Tier.

However, how many students were recruited each time?

Therefore, it was considered quite normal not to have anyone reach the Sun Moon Tier in one or even in a few batches of students.

With such a comparison, one should know just how formidable those of the Heavenly Body Tier were.

“The white cat is the pet of Head Fu, who likes it very much. So, even if the white cat loosens its bowels on your head, you must endure it! In the past, someone had slapped the white cat. That person was then crippled by Lord Fu and expelled!” Zhang Deman said solemnly.

“Hey, could that’ve been the Seventh Young Master of the Ai Clan?” someone queried.

“His surname was indeed Ai; he was called Ai Song.” Zhang Deman nodded in response. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“The Ai Clan might not be a top-ranking clan, but it is also quite high-ranking among the second-class clans. Lord Fu actually didn’t even give them any face, hiss!”

“Never provoke the cat!”

Everyone gave a cold shudder. There was none who didn’t think that ‘since that cat mustn’t be provoked, and giving it a slap would face such miserable consequences, then if one was to grab a handful of its fur, what kind of miserable fate would await that person?’.

Most of the people would stay in the dormitory arranged by the Academy, but a small number of people merely strolled around the Academy, and would return to stay in their own homes at night. Descendants of influential officials, such as Li Weiwei, would naturally choose whether to come to the Academy or not depending on their mood.

Ling Han finally had his own home. The Scarlet Heaven Academy was massive. Everyone was given their own courtyard. Even though it wasn’t very big, there was a garden, a living room, and a bedroom. It could be said that even though it was small, it was completely furnished with all necessities.

He was very satisfied. After sitting for a while, he began to consider his next move.

Making money!

He had first defined a goal. Of course, it wouldn’t be gold and silver, but rather the True Origin Stones. It was the hard currency of the Immortal Realm, just like the gold and silver of the small world.

With money, one could buy all kinds of resources.

How to make money?

Ling Han stroked his chin. Subconsciously, he took out the food in the Black Tower and started cooking. A few days ago, when he was staying in the Left Minister’s Residence, he remained very low-key, cultivating in seclusion, but now, this place was his territory, so his mind suddenly relaxed a lot.

He had spent too much time with Hu Niu—he would also begin thinking about food when he had nothing else to do.

‘Alas, I wonder how Hu Niu, my parents, Helian Xun Xue, and my son are doing right now.

‘Hey, can the food in the Black Tower be taken out for sale?’

This ought to be feasible. The food in the Black Tower was so delicious that even the Immortals would drool over them. After all, the Immortals were only more powerful in strength, and weren’t pure-minded monks with scant desires.

Otherwise, why would there be so many strong people remaining in the position of power?

However, which restaurant would let the bills be settled with True Origin Stones? And if he wanted to deliver the food straight to the households of high-ranking officials or local tycoons, he would need to have the right connections.

‘That’s right!’ Ling Han clasped his hands together. ‘Isn’t Li Weiwei the right connection?’

If the daughter of the Left Minister wanted to do business, then who would not give her face? Anyway, the ingredients in the Black Tower didn’t need any capital, so even if the profits of the sales were to be divided equally with Li Weiwei, it wouldn’t matter much. After all, the one with the connection would be king.

Ling Han nodded. In addition, he could also concoct alchemical pills such as this Replenishing Spirit Pill, which would be extremely popular amongst those of the Shattering Void Tier and Mountain River Tier, and it would not be bought with gold or silver, but with True Origin Stones!

Alchemy was his old business, and he was the best at it. In his past life, there was no knowing how much he had earned from this trade. Even the proud and arrogant Sword Emperor and the Setting Sun Saber Emperor at that time also had to bow their heads to him.

This was also one way of doing it.

Letting Li Weiwei help in liaising with the customers was putting his life in the hands of another, after all. That kind of young miss... there was no knowing when she might change her mind. Meanwhile, concocting alchemical pills would be different. Once the pills had been refined, how could he possibly be afraid of not being able to sell them?

Yi, where was that barbequed meat that he had put on the grill?

Ling Han had just released the Gold-seeking Rat from the Black Tower. Now that he had brought this little guy, his talent was indeed very helpful. But when he turned around, the two pieces of meat on the grill that were nearly roasted had gone missing.

He couldn’t help but be surprised. That meat was practically stolen from right under his nose without him realizing it. The other party’s movement was extremely fast, and the actions were also very nimble; it was quite astonishing.

However, when his eyes swept across the vicinity, he almost choked.

On the wall of the courtyard, a fat white cat was seen having a hearty meal, and what its mouth was nibbling... was naturally the roasted meat that Ling Han was missing.

Zhang Deman’s words immediately flashed through Ling Han’s mind. ‘The big white cat!’

F*ck, it wouldn’t be such a coincidence, right?

Ling Han’s mouth slightly twitched. On his first day of entering the Academy, he had already met the legendary white cat that couldn’t be provoked? ‘This cat is so vile to steal things the moment it appears!’

The big white cat also realized that it had been “caught” by Ling Han, but it didn’t show any fear like a thief being caught in the act. Instead, it cried out ‘meow’ towards Ling Han—its voice wasn’t loud, but carried the hint of a tiger cub’s soft roar.

It nibbled at the meat again, bearing a vile expression as if saying, “Come and bite me if you dare.”

Ling Han felt a sudden urge to strike it, only to remember that it wasn’t without reason that the former senior brother disciple couldn’t help but hit this big white cat. He snorted, and said, “Little thief, I will forgo this one meal. I’ll consider it as my treat to you. However, don’t think you can steal again!”

This big white cat was merely in the Shattering Void Tier. Even if its body was agile and its speed was amazing, as long as Ling Han remained vigilant, he would definitely not let the other party succeed again.

“Meow!” The white cat cried out arrogantly, which meant ‘if I want to eat, then could you stop me?’ It picked up the rest of the meat and left abruptly with a leap.
