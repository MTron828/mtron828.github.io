3056 Another Discovery

For Seventh Tiers, there was no difference whether the attack they received was strong or weak. In any case, their physiques were indestructible, so who cared.

But what Extermination was doing now was breaking away from a fight, so the situation was different.

Originally, Ling Han could suppress her with a single strike, but the power was scattered now when he attacked her, and the impact she took was pitifully small. Naturally, it could no longer stop her, and she forcefully charged her way out.

‘Interesting,’ Ling Han thought to himself. He had set up 100 layers of energy shields on his body, layer by layer, to nullify the attacks he received. Even someone as powerful as Hysteria would not be able to injure him with a single strike.

Extermination now used another method to weaken the attack power she would sustain. This was also an excellent defensive method.

‘It can be used as a reference,’ Ling Han thought to himself. He had never been arrogant and conceited such that he would consider his methods the best.

When this battle was over, he would definitely ponder over Extermination’s defensive method. It was truly worth learning.

However, practically no damage would be inflicted on Extermination now, so there was naturally no way to stop her. She repeatedly managed to break away from the fight.

Ling Han could only leave the Void first and send away the person with the ball of light in his mind. This was the target of Extermination. If he sent him away, this trip would be considered a complete failure for Extermination.

She had even been tricked into revealing some information by Ling Han. Although she had not revealed her true identity, she had still exposed the first layer of her disguise.

“Ling Han!” Extermination shouted harshly. She did not have Ling Han’s ability to travel through dimensions. Once this person left the dimension, she could no longer track him, and he would completely vanish from her radar.

Ling Han dug his ears, and said nonchalantly, “There’s no need to be so loud. I’m not deaf.”

Extermination looked at him balefully, and shouted, “Hand him over!”

“Heh, don’t forget, you were the one who snatched my people first, and now you want me to hand over my own people to you. Who do you think you are?” Ling Han sneered. Could it be that you think you could make demands just because you were beautiful?

The Empress and Hu Niu were not inferior to her at all, so how could Ling Han be affected by her?

“Have you ever thought of the consequences of going against me?” Extermination said. “You can match me, but what about your family? I remember that you have several wives and children. Hmph.”

She was all alone, and could do whatever she wanted without any scruples.

Ling Han frowned, and killing intent instantly erupted from his eyes.

Originally, he only wanted to suppress Extermination. After all, she was no longer the great demon from back then, and he didn’t know who had possessed her. But now, the other party was actually using his own family to threaten him, and this caused Ling Han’s killing intent to rise.

“When I advance to the Seventh Tier, you will be the first I kill!” he said word by word.

Extermination could not help but be taken over by his aura. After being stunned for a moment, she laughed out loud. “I’m indestructible for eternity. Even the impact of the destruction of the Genesis World can’t kill me. What makes you think you can? Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“I’ll give you three days to consider.

“Three days later, if the person I want appears here, I’ll pretend that nothing happened. Otherwise… don’t blame me for starting a massacre!”

She turned around, and tore open a rip in space to leave.

Ling Han didn’t give chase. Even Hysteria couldn’t kill a Seventh Tier, so it was naturally even more impossible for him to do so. Furthermore, Extermination was far more powerful than Chong Yan and the others, and he couldn’t even suppress her.

This time, both sides suffered a little.

Ling Han hadn’t been able to get the target back[1], and Extermination hadn’t been able to take her target[2] away, either.

“I have to hurry.”

Ling Han continued to head to the next dimension, and then continuously shuttled back and forth. He wanted to find more people with balls of light in their minds, and completely analyze the secret code of life.

However, such people were truly too few and far between. After one round, Ling Han had gained nothing.

After returning to the Profound Negative Realm, Ling Han temporarily took a break and spent some time with his family.

The threat of Extermination was very real. She was alone, and she was immortal. She could do whatever she wanted without any scruples.

Thus, Ling Han began to move, and sent his entire family to a low-level dimension to temporarily settle down.

Unfortunately, the clan could not produce a second person with Seventh-Tier battle prowess, or else they would be able to share Ling Han’s burden.

Ling Xi and Fu Tianxing were still stuck at the Fourth Tier. This leap from the Fourth Tier to the Fifth Tier was too difficult. Even Ling Han had relied on a fragment of the dimensional core to breach the gap back then. Now, the only transcendent dimension in the world was the Profound Negative Realm, so how could it be shattered for them?

Ning Hai’s explosive burst could not be replicated. She was now in the Second Tier, and it could be said that she was far from the Seventh Tier.

Ling Han did not stop his research on the ball of light in his mind. He only analyzed the life code within it, but there was actually still more information, and there should be more secrets hidden within.

Perhaps this was also the reason why he was so impressive and awesome in alchemy. Ning Haixin, on the other hand, had a strong affinity because of this.

Since he couldn’t find a new secret code of life, he naturally couldn’t waste time. After all, there might be a huge treasure hidden there.

Ling Han immersed himself in such research day and night. Of course, he did not neglect to cultivate, but once he reached the Heavenly Venerable Tier, it was almost impossible for his cultivation level to advance rapidly.

Were there any more items like Great Herbs or dimensional cores?

No. He could only do it step by step.

Ling Han had already reached the final step. Thus, wanting to reach the peak stage of the Sixth Tier was an extremely difficult task, and to get from the peak stage of the Sixth Tier to the Seventh Tier was even more difficult.

After tens of thousands of years, Ling Han had gained nothing.

He thought for a moment, and gathered Ning Haixin, Ba Tai, Ma Chenggao, and company together. Since the resonance between the two of them could unravel the secret of the ball of light, what miracle would happen if more people resonated?

There were a total of eight people. They intertwined their divine senses, and lit up the ball of light in their minds.

Hong! Ling Han only felt his body tremble, and an intense pain instantly assaulted him.

“Ah…” Ning Haixin and the others covered their heads with their hands, and revealed pained expressions.

Ning Haixin was still fine, but Ba Tai, Ma Chenggao, and the others were all bleeding from all seven orifices. They had almost died.

This impact was too violent, and it directly assaulted the mind, as if it wanted to shatter it.

Ling Han was also shocked. Then, he thought back, and couldn’t help but reveal a look of joy.

When the eight lights resonated, he seemed to see a miniature version of the Genesis World. Within one of the dimensions, there were eight spots of light shining, and in the dimension 17 levels away, there was a weak spot of light flashing.

Was this the ninth person who had a ball of light in his mind?

Ling Han immediately moved out and arrived at this medium-level dimension. According to his memories, he narrowed down the scope, and then conscripted many Celestial-King-Tier forces to search for the person. Of course, they were using the testing device that he and Wally had created together to conduct their search.

However, even if the range was reduced, this was still a very, very large area. The number of living beings they had to search was in the hundreds of billions. How small was the probability of finding a specific person here—some being who was perhaps not even a human?

Ling Han didn’t lack patience. He waited and cultivated at the same time. In any case, he wasn’t wasting his time.
