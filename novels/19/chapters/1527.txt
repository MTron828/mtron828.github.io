Chapter 1528 Hidden Hand

Ling Han increased his speed. Half a day passed, and he finally managed to stuff all of the 100,000 True Origin Stones into Shi Gangyang’s belly. Right now, Shi Gangyang was completely unable to close his mouth. Meanwhile, his belly was so large that it was enough to astound anyone who saw it.

The outlines of the True Origin Stones could be clearly seen on his belly, and it would cause one to question whether or not his belly was about to explode. However, Eternal River Tier elites would have definitely cultivated their physique before—it was just a matter of how much they had done so. In any case, their bellies wouldn’t be forced to the point of bursting so easily.

Ling Han clapped his hands, extremely satisfied with his own work. Shi Gangyang’s appearance was extremely comical right now, with his gigantic belly completely disproportionate to his seemingly small limbs and head.

Ling Han then proceeded to take all of Shi Gangyang’s Spatial Spirit Tools. However, his expression instantly darkened. There were only a mere 17 pieces of Level 14 Godly metals inside these Spatial Spirit Tools, and the rest of the items were all True Origin Stones. There were several hundred million True Origin Stones in total. However, this was nothing compared to the Godly metal that he had given Lin Yuqi.

“You’re truly seeking death!” Ling Han raised his fists and dealt another vicious beating to Shi Gangyang.

When he was satisfied, he tossed Shi Gangyang aside, and said, “I’ll give you three days’ time to gather everything that belongs to me. If you can’t satisfy me...” He pondered for a moment before continuing, “I’ll find 100 boars to backdoor you!”

He strode away after issuing this threat.

Shi Gangyang shuddered upon hearing this. He wanted to immediately leave this dangerous place. However, his cultivation had been suppressed, so how could he escape?

Ling Han had only just left the Treasure Forest Pavilion when he heard a sweet voice say, “Oh, isn’t this Little Brother Han?”

‘Lin Yuqi!’

Ling Han wore a cold expression as he turned around, and he said, “You still dare to show yourself?”

“Why wouldn’t I dare? You’re not a man-eating tiger, are you? Should I be afraid of you eating me?” Lin Yuqi swayed her hips as she walked over, accentuating the curves of her shapely body. The passers-by couldn’t help but pinch their noses, afraid that they would get a nosebleed.

She tossed a spatial ring toward Ling Han as she said, “If I didn’t show myself, how would you get your belongings back?”

Ling Han caught the spatial ring and inspected it with his divine sense. There was a huge amount of Godly metal within it, ranging from Level 11 to Level 13. There were countless Godly metals of each level.

There was an aggrieved look on Lin Yuqi’s face, and she said, “I’ve been working hard for you this entire time. However, that bastard arrived half a year ago and forcefully took over my position. I’d kept a hidden hand, though, and it was because of this that I managed to retain most of your belongings. Moreover, most of the Level 14 Godly metal is still with me.”

Ling Han’s anger subsided upon receiving his Godly metal, and he asked, “What on earth happened?”

“That bastard is interested in me, and he came to this branch using the excuse of performing an inspection. However, he became greedy upon seeing me selling a piece of Godly metal every few days, so he forcefully took over my position,” Lin Yuqi explained. “Fortunately, I was able to install a few workers who are loyal to me. They would immediately notify me whenever you arrived.”

Ling Han nodded in understanding. He then pondered for a moment before walking back to the Treasure Forest Pavilion.

“Oi, oi, oi, what are you doing?” Lin Yuqi hurriedly ran over to block him. “I came here to meet you so I could avoid that bastard. Are you going to walk straight back into his trap?”

She naturally didn’t know that Ling Han was already powerful enough to easily suppress Shi Gangyang. Thus, she was afraid that Ling Han would go and recklessly argue with Shi Gangyang. Doing so would be like a sheep walking into the mouth of a tiger!

Ling Han didn’t reply, and he continued to stride toward the pharmacy.

How could Lin Yuqi block him? Thus, she had no option but to follow behind him. She would convince Shi Gangyang to let him off no matter what. After all, it was extremely likely that Ling Han would advance to the Genesis Tier in the future. Such a being couldn’t be offended.

However, her jaw involuntarily dropped when she followed Ling Han into the backyard of the pharmacy. There was a look of utter disbelief on her face.

‘W-w-what in the world?

‘That’s Shi Gangyang?

‘Yes, that’s indeed his face. However, his body is far too different! How has he become so obese?!’

Shi Gangyang was currently vomiting True Origin Stones. His cultivation had been sealed, so it was extremely difficult for him to remove the True Origin Stones from his body. Up until now, he had only managed to vomit up a dozen or so True Origin Stones. Upon seeing Ling Han arrive, he couldn’t help but shudder in fright.

‘Why has he come again?

‘Three days have already passed? That quickly?!’

Ling Han threw a punch. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Peng!

Shi Gangyang was instantly obliterated into pieces. True Origin Stones burst into the air.

Since he had already recovered his lost belongings, there was no reason to keep Shi Gangyang alive any longer. He had dared to steal so many of his belongings, so killing him would be the only way to quench his anger.

Lin Yuqi still had yet to come to her senses. She remained in a state of disbelief for a while longer before suddenly jumping up and exclaiming, “You actually killed Shi Gangyang?!”

“No need to thank me,” Ling Han said with a smile.

Lin Yuqi grabbed onto his sleeves, and said, “He was an Eternal River Tier elite! His death will be like an earthquake to the Treasure Forest Pavilion! Things definitely won’t end here!”

Ling Han smiled, and said, “No worries. Just spread this story. Say that he discovered a treasure storage, yet was killed by someone while exploring it.”

“You want me to lie?” Lin Yuqi said with a roll of her eyes.

“Don’t tell me you didn’t want him to die.”

“Fine, I also detested that annoying fly. However, I’m also not lying to you. Eternal River Tier elites are far too important to the Treasure Forest Pavilion, especially Shi Gangyang. He was only 100 million years old, and he possessed the potential to advance to the consummate level. Not only was he important to the Shi Clan, but he was also extremely important to the entire Treasure Forest Pavilion,” Lin Yuqi said solemnly.

Ling Han was unfazed by this, and he replied, “No matter. Just spread the news. By the time the Treasure Forest Pavilion figures it out and sends someone here, that’ll already be 40 or 50 years into the future.”

Right now, the only thing that he was short on was time. Just how powerful would he be in 40 to 50 years’ time?

Ling Han returned, and Lin Yuqi remained to clean up the mess. If she couldn’t regain authority after Shi Gangyang’s death, then that would simply be a reflection on how poor her abilities were.

After returning to the academy, Ling Han organized the Godly metals according to their level before retrieving his Divine Demon Sword to absorb them.

The quality of the Divine Demon Sword soared as the pieces of Godly metal were consumed one after another.

Level 12! Level 13!

The Divine Demon Sword advanced two levels in a row, yet it was still unable to reach Level 14. This was because there wasn’t enough Level 13 Godly metal.

Ling Han sent Ding Ping to request Lin Yuqi purchase more Level 13 Godly metal. However, she didn’t need to purchase too much. All he needed was another 20 pieces or so. However, the higher the level of the Godly metal, the more difficult it would be to obtain. This wasn’t something that could be done in just a few days’ time. It might take a year, or it might take several years.

Ling Han calmed his mind and prepared to break through to the medium extreme of the Eternal River Tier. Meanwhile, Empress Luan Xing had already advanced to the medium extreme. Right now, her Divine Fetus was even more powerful than what Gu Daoyi’s had been. She was cultivating with 10 bodies, after all, so it was only natural that her cultivation speed was incredible.

After receiving the inheritance of the three Phoenix Kings, the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Maiden’s cultivation also started to advance rapidly.

The benefits that she received wouldn’t be immediately evident. However, she would see her cultivation speed increase by 10,000-fold before advancing to the Genesis Tier. Thus, she had managed to advance to the medium extreme of the Heavenly Body Tier and then the high extreme not long after. Moreover, all of this was just in a few months’ time.

Meanwhile, the Rain Emperor and the Notionless Saint had also advanced to the Eternal River Tier thanks to the help of some Saintly medicine. However, Xu Ran was still unable to advance no matter what. His amount of talent was the only thing that was holding him back.

Peng!

One day, the tranquility of Ling Han’s life was finally broken. The gate of his courtyard was kicked open, revealing three unwelcome guests.
