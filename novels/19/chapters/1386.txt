Chapter 1387 Have You Seen My Dog?

The 100 or so Heavenly Body Tier elites all unleashed their most powerful attacks. To say nothing of the Netherworld, they would still crush this praying mantis even if it had come from the Immortal Realm. It actually dared to prevent them from retrieving the Godly medicine!

Numerous powerful God Tools were activated, all of them drawing on their user’s Origin Power or even lifespan as they unleashed devastating attacks. The formidable might of these attacks caused even Ling Han’s heart to palpitate in apprehension.

This praying mantis was incredibly close to reaching the Eternal River Tier.

A series of frenzied attacks rained down on the praying mantis. The 100 or so cultivators were all wielding Eternal River Tier God Tools, so even if they couldn’t unleash might at the Eternal River Tier, the attacks that they launched were still incredibly powerful. In any case, the praying mantis wasn’t at the Eternal River Tier, either!

Thus, it wasn’t long before the praying mantis was riddled with wounds. Its body was bathed in black-colored blood that evaporated into clouds of black aura. This black aura appeared extremely uncanny as it swirled in the air.

If this were the outside world, the behavior of both humans and Demonic Beasts would generally be the same. If they couldn’t defeat their enemies, they would simply turn around and flee. In this mystery realm, however, the Demonic Beasts were all a little stubborn. The praying mantis refused to retreat, instead fighting with all of its might.

In fact, it was still fairly threatening, managing to severely wound several people and obliterate their physical bodies. However, it had been unable to kill the cultivators in one strike. Thus, it had allowed their divine sense to escape. In any case, these people had already lost their chance to continue fighting for the Godly medicine.

The praying mantis managed to defend itself surprisingly well. A day passed, yet it still hadn’t been killed by the cultivators. The cultivators all wore grave expressions. They could only remain on the fifth level for a limited amount of time. After a short while, a portion of them would be booted out of the mystery realm, having reached the time limit assigned to them.

With them becoming weaker, it wasn’t impossible that the Demonic Beast would counterattack and regain the upper hand.

“Work together to defeat the Demonic Beast! Otherwise, none of us will obtain that Godly medicine!” someone shouted.

“Agreed!” the others shouted in agreement.

Although a single clan and a single branch would become incredibly powerful as a result of obtaining the Makara Flower, the overall strength and stability of the Treasure Forest Pavilion would also improve as a result. This was something that would benefit all of the four major clans.

The cultivators stopped working against each other. Instead, they formed a group formation to unleash the full potential of their battle prowess.

With this sudden shift in tactic, the already struggling praying mantis was instantly pushed beyond its limits. Under the frenzied torrent of attacks, it wasn’t long before its two blade-like forelegs were blasted off its body. Immediately afterward, a gaping hole was blasted out in the back of its head. This was a fatal blow. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The gigantic praying mantis crashed to the ground, its black blood flowing freely and releasing a sinister stench. With this black blood seeping into the earth, this desolate land even more so wouldn’t be able to produce any other Godly medicine.

However, following the death of the praying mantis, the alliance that had just been formed also crumbled in an instant. The cultivators descended into a melee again, everyone fighting to obtain the Makara Flower.

Ling Han had watched on this entire time, finding the battle incredibly boring. In the current situation, it would be tremendously difficult for him to sneak over and pluck the poisonous flower for himself. In any case, he wasn’t all that interested in obtaining the Makara Flower. As such, he decided to leave and explore somewhere else.

Right at this moment, however, an indescribable chill suddenly gripped at his heart. Cold sweat instantly formed on his forehead, trickling down his face like a stream.

A shadow had suddenly materialized on the ground, right next to his body!

Someone had actually sneaked up from behind him without him knowing?

Ling Han almost entered the Black Tower right away. However, he forcefully suppressed the urge to do so. If this person had wanted to attack him, they would have done so without allowing him to discover their existence. Even so, he still turned around extremely slowly and carefully.

During this process, Ling Han’s entire back was already drenched in sweat. He felt as if there were a boundless mountain weighing down on his back.

Ling Han knew that the person behind him was definitely powerful beyond belief. Otherwise, just the mere feeling of danger alone couldn’t cause him to feel such apprehension and pressure.

After a long time, he finally managed to turn around fully. In this instant, everything before him seemed eerily quiet. The battle below was still raging in its earth-shattering ways, yet it was as if he had gone completely deaf.

A person stood before him.

However... Was this truly a person?

This should have been an old man, with his beard already snow-white. However, in an uncanny twist, this old man didn’t have any eyeballs, with only two cavities remaining where his eyes should have been. His eye sockets were eerily black, and it was as if they could engulf all matter.

He was dressed in a faint-yellow dao robe that was brimming with an aura of ancient dao and immortality. However, because of his “eyes”, his entire appearance was indescribably unsettling.

Ling Han had already been drenched in sweat. However, upon seeing this old man, he now felt as if even his breath were going to stop.

This old man also saw Ling Han turn around, and he asked, “Where’s my dog? Have you seen my dog?”

If this were any other situation, Ling Han would definitely burst into laughter upon hearing this question. However, he was stunned to discover that this old man didn’t have any teeth, either!

No, no, no... Not only did he not have teeth, but he didn’t have a tongue or throat, either! He didn’t have anything!

Looking at the old man’s empty eye sockets again, a spine-chilling speculation suddenly flashed through Ling Han’s mind. ‘This old man... He isn’t a sheet of human skin, is he?!’

Even with his courage and bravery, this still caused goosebumps to form all over his body.

He forcefully composed himself, and replied, “This junior hasn’t seen Senior’s dog.”

“Oh, you haven’t seen it? Then I’ll ask someone else,” the old man said. He walked past Ling Han and calmly strode down the cliff, entering the valley below. He didn’t look very quick, yet he was actually able to cover several kilometers with a single stride.

He could penetrate through space!

Ling Han was stunned. However, when his gaze settled on the back of the old man’s head, he couldn’t help but feel even more stunned. This was because there was an extremely clear slit on the back of the old man’s head. He could clearly see that this old man was only a sheet of bloody skin!

‘What the hell is this?!’

This old man was only a sheet of skin, yet he could still run around like a normal person. Moreover, he possessed a tremendous power that could astonish even heaven and earth. Not only that, but his temperament was also strange. His question of “have you seen my dog” was like a joke, only that no one would ever find it funny. They would only feel a boundless chill run down their spine.

Meanwhile, the uninvited guest approached the elites that were locked in an intense battle down in the valley.

Han Tao was a rising star of the Han Clan. He had only cultivated of 900,000 or so years, yet he had already reached the consummate level of the Heavenly Body Tier! Of course, his cultivation speed was only so quick because he had received special nurturing from his clan. All of their investment was for this battle right now.

It was a shame that although he was talented and powerful, the other clans and branch families had also invested a great deal in their younger generation. As such, when it came to cultivation level, he didn’t possess any advantage over the others. This was the case even though he had brought the most valuable treasure of his clan along.

Just as he was feeling irritated and annoyed, a voice suddenly sounded from next to his ear, asking, “Where’s my dog? Have you seen my dog?”

‘Dog your mom!’

Han Tao was already feeling this sh*t at this moment. Now that someone was asking such a strange question next to his ear, he almost flared up in wild rage. However, he was a prodigy, after all, so he was instantly frightened still the very next instant. It was as if his blood had been frozen in his veins.

‘Who is this? They actually managed to approach me without me realizing?!’

He was astounded, and he couldn’t help but shiver in terror. He then slowly turned around, only to see a white-bearded old man who had bloody sockets for eyes. This was indescribably terrifying.

Even though he was a Heavenly Body Tier elite who had experienced countless dangers, he was still barely able to stop himself from calling out for his mother at this instant.

This wasn’t because he was weak, but rather because this old man was far too sinister. He was silently affecting his emotions. Just then, Ling Han had also gone weak at the knees in fright. This had nothing to do with one’s mental state, but had everything to do with this old man’s overwhelming power.
