Chapter 897: Eight Levels!

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Although Cheng Haofei was somewhat disappointed, he still appeared to be full of confidence.

He had passed through the first two stages of assessment on the seventh level, but did not manage to take on the 10 strikes from Xu Ran. This meant that he still had plenty of room for improvement. After all, his talent had been clearly exhibited there. As long as he were to engage in more battles or cultivate some secret technique, then his battle prowess would improve by leaps and bounds.

He remained completely unaware that there were two other people in the tower. Bearing an extremely confident smile, he faced everyone, intending to receive a tsunami of cheers, as well as the envious gazes of men and looks of adoration from women.

But, he was disappointed.

Almost everyone was looking up at the White Star Tower, and apparently didn’t realize his emergence as a super genius.

F*ck, what was going on?

‘Sh!t, what’s this situation?’ Cheng Haofei couldn’t stop a muscle in his cheek from twitching. This was a scenario that he had never expected; he nearly tripped over his own feet, and couldn’t help stumbling a few steps. Calming himself down, he walked back, feigning disinterest. In actual fact, though, he pricked up his ears to listen carefully.

It turned out that... there were two more people in the White Star Tower, and they had all passed through the previous six levels! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

What?! The appearance of Ma Xing aside, there were actually two other people who could be on equal level with himself?

As such, he probably couldn’t not even keep his second place, and could even have slipped out of the top three and fallen onto the fourth position.

F*ck! To hell with it!

Had he known earlier, he would have waited another five years. He did not believe that so many geniuses would emerge in the next five-year period. But now, he could only wait in the hopes that the other two in the tower were not that much of a genius compared to him—even if he couldn’t get first place, he could at least steadily remain in second place.

However, although everyone was concerned about the results of the remaining two, the higher-ups of the Northern Institution had already summoned Cheng Haofei. Of course, they had to get acquainted with such a genius, and probably reap some benefits, lest he might choose to directly renounce his enrollment into the Institution and enter the Eastern Institution five years later—they would then be chopped to pieces by the Head of the Northern Institution.

After a while, the seventh level of the tower glowed!

This time, everyone had gone numb with shock.

Passing through seven levels... what kind of notion was this?

Three-star Genius!

He wouldn’t be weaker than Ma Xing, truly not weak at all! It was necessary to know that Ma Xing had the potential to become a Three-star Genius by relying on King’s Qi. But now, another’s potential had jumped straight to Three-star level.

Moreover, cultivators could later cultivate King’s Qi—it wasn’t an advantage that naturally belonged to some people.

Who was it? Ultimately, who could it be?

Not long later, a woman in a fluttering white dress, with flowing black hair like a waterfall and exquisite appearance of a fairy, was seen walking out.

“Big Sister Yun!” Li Weiwei quickly ran over, and exclaimed, “Congratulations to Big Sister Yun for passing the seventh level of the tower. In the future, you will be stepping into the Immortal level as a Three-star Genius!”

The rest of the people nodded their heads in agreement. It didn’t take long for Ji Yun’er to appear after the seventh level of the tower had lit up. Obviously, she had to have passed through the seventh level, but lost at the eighth level, and thus retreated.

Oh, seventh level. Even for a magnificent and vast country like the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire, only one could emerge after thousands of years.

The pretty face of Ji Yun’er changed color, and she said, “I did not pass the seventh level. I lost at the third stage.”

“What?!” Li Weiwei exclaimed.

“What?!” the others also exclaimed.

It, it actually wasn’t Ji Yun’er!

How could that be!?

Li Weiwei held her head in her hands in dismay, and kept stomping her foot, saying, “Unbelievable! No, I don’t believe this! Really, it was that blockhead indeed! Arghh, I want to trample him to death!” It wasn’t that it had never crossed her mind that the person who had passed through the seventh level of the tower could be Ling Han, but such a thought only appeared for a moment before it vanished—who asked him be put together in comparison with Ji Yun’er?

But now, Ji Yun’er had already admitted upfront that she wasn’t the person who had passed through the seventh level of the tower. So, there was only one person left.

Ling Han!

A cultivator who had come from the Lower Realm, an insignificant ant who would not be held in any regard by anyone of the Immortal Realm.

Li Weiwei was finally convinced—how could an emperor who had broken history by splitting open the sky to come into the Immortal Realm be simple?

“Weiwei, do you know this person?” Ji Yun’er could immediately guessed, having observed the change in color on Li Weiwei’s face.

Li Weiwei nodded, and said, “He is a cultivator from a small world who had arrived here at the Immortal Realm about ten days ago.”

Ji Yun’er: “...”

A cultivator from a small world?

This was impossible. How could the cultivation environment of a small world compare with the Immortal Realm? Could the abundance of resources there be compared with that of the Immortal Realm? Could the elites there be compared with the Immortal Realm? Everything there was infinitely lagging behind, and it could be regarded as a barren land.

But it was a person who came from such a barren land that had accomplished an amazing feat—he passed through the seventh level of the tower!

This kind of aptitude could be ranked within the top ten in the entire Scarlet Heaven Academy.

The higher-ups of the Northern Institution were extremely excited. They gained much in this session of examination. Not only did three great geniuses came, but the performance of Ji Yun’er showed that she had the potential of being a Two-star Genius. In addition, three dark horses had appeared, and the one whose performance was the least of the lot also showed the potential of being a Two-star Genius. As for the other two, one possessed King’s Qi, while the other had the potential to become a Three-star Genius.

Northern Institution... would flourish!

However, this was yet to be the climax.

Mere moments later, the eighth level of the tower was illuminated.

“Goodness! I’m not mistaken, right? Had the moonlight suddenly become brighter, or is the eighth level really glowing?”

“It’s impossible that all of us also got it wrong... It is true that the eighth level of the tower has been lit!”

“Four... Four-star Genius!”

At this time, the higher-ups of the Northern Institution were all unable to sit still, and came out together to wait beneath the White Star Tower, itching to meet with this super genius.

Four-star genius—what kind of notion was this?

This empire’s Left and Right Ministers, as well as the Seven Generals were four-star Geniuses! What kind of beings were these nine people? They were the cornerstone of the Chaotic Stars Majestic Empire, practically standing at the summit of this planet.

Aside from shock, everyone was also looking forward to know whether the person inside the tower could pass through the ninth level and become what was known only in legends—a Five-star Genius.

“This freak!” Li Weiwei muttered to herself. Had she not seen it with her own eyes, she wouldn’t have believed that arrogant prick could actually become a Four-star Genius. When she thought of Ling Han, being arrogant and appearing full of confidence, she felt a kind of crazy urge to smash his face.

Inside the tower, the gateway to the ninth level had been opened, but Ling Han stopped in his tracks, saying to himself, “Should I go up to the ninth level? Forget it, I should be able to take the first place now. There’s no need to display my entire capacity for everyone’s knowledge.

“Now I am a Four-star genius, so the Academy will definitely focus on nurturing me. While a Four-star Genius is outstanding, the history of the Academy hasn’t been without the appearance of such geniuses.

“However, as for Five-star... perhaps it might not be a good thing.”

A Five-star Genius might even trigger the interference of the empress, so much so that she might even have him investigated thoroughly to find out his secret for being so powerful—how could someone from a small world be so powerful?

Honestly, if it wasn’t for the sake of getting the first place, Ling Han would actually prefer to stop after passing through the seventh level. However, being a Three-star Genius might not have been enough to suppress Ma Xing; meanwhile, being a Four-star Genius would definitely be more than enough to do so.

As he thought about it this way, he turned around without hesitation. He didn’t even go up to the ninth level.
